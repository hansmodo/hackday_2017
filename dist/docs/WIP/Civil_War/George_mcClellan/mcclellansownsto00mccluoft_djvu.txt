BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH 



GEORGE B. McCLELLAN 



\V. C. PRIME, LL.D. 



LIFE, SERVICES, AND CHARACTER 



OBORQE B. McCLELLAN. 



GEORGE BRINTON MCCLELLAN, son of George McClellan, M.D., and 
Elizabeth Brinton McClellan, was born in Philadelphia, Penn., Dec. 3, 
1826. His school education was in that city ; in 1841 and 1842 in the pre- 
paratory school attached to the University of Pennsylvania. He entered 
the Military Academy at West Point in 1842, graduating in 1846, when he 
was assigned to the Corps of Engineers as second lieutenant. In Sept. of 
the same year he went with the army to Mexico, where he served with dis- 
tinction during the war. He was breveted first I'^utenant for gallantry at 
Contreras and Churubusco, captain for Chapultepec. 

At the close of the Mexican war he commanded the engineer com- 
pany and brought it to West Point, where he served with it, acting also as 
assistant instructor of practical engineering until 1851. In that year he 
superintended the construction of Fort Delaware. In 1852 he accompa- 
nied Capt. R. B. Marcy on the Red river exploring expedition. In 1853 
and 1854 he was on duty in Washington Territory and Oregon, as an 
engineer officer, exploring a proposed route for the Pacific Railroad. 

In the spring of 1855 the government sent a commission of army 
officers to Europe, instructed to obtain and report information on military 
service in general, and the practical working of changes then recently 
made in military systems. 

The commission was specially instructed to give attention to the 
organization of armies, transports for men and horses, embarking and 
disembarking them, hospitals and ambulances, clothing and camp equip- 
age, arms and ammunition, fortifications and sea-coast defences, engineer- 
ing operations of a siege in all its branches, siege-trains, bridge-trains, 
boats, wagons in short, to study and report on the whole art of war in 
Europe. As the Crimean war was then in progress, and the British and 
French forces were besieging Sebastopol, this was an important point for 
the objects of the commission, which consisted of three officers Maj. R. 



2 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

Delafield, Maj. A. Mordecai, and Capt. G. B. McClellan. They proceed- 
ed to Europe in the spring of 1855, amply accredited to American repre- 
sentatives and the several governments on whose courtesy they would have 
to depend for opportunities of study and observation. 

The British government extended to them every possible courtesy. 
From the French and the Russian they could obtain no facilities. They 
were received in the Crimea with soldierly kindness by Gen. Simpson, who 
had succeeded Lord Raglan in command of the British forces. Here they 
had ample opportunity for the study of military operations on a grand 
scale. Leaving the Crimea in Nov., they pursued their duties in various 
European states. The list of military posts and fortresses which they 
examined is very long, abounding in names illustrious in the history of 
wars. McClellan's Report on the arms, equipments, and organization of 
" the three arms " was, says a distinguished soldier, "a model of concise- 
ness and accurate information, and added to his already brilliant reputa- 
tion." It may be noted as an interesting fact that the Secretary of War 
who issued the elaborate instructions to this commission, and selected its 
members for their special ability and fitness, was Jefferson Davis. Five 
years later, when he was at the head of a political and military rebellion, 
one of the commissioners utilized his experience and information in organ- 
izing and leading the armies of the Union for its suppression. 

In Jan , 1857, McClellan, then captain in the ist Cavalry, resigned his 
commission and accepted employment, first as chief-engineer, afterward as 
vice-president, of the Illinois Central Railroad Company. Later he became 
president of the Eastern Division of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad 
Company. 

On the 22d May, 1860, he married Ellen Mary Marcy, daughter of 
Capt. (afterward Gen.) Randolph B. Marcy, and established his residence 
at Cincinnati, O., where he was occupied in his business when the civil war 
began, and he offered his services to his country. 

No volunteer in the army made greater personal sacrifices. He was 
in the enjoyment of a large income ; his prospects in life were brilliant. 
Like all soldiers of the old army, he had led a wandering life, with no one 
place to call a home. He had now for the first time made for himself a 
place of rest with his young wife, in which they were gathering those per- 
sonal belongings which go so far to make life happy and rest delightful. 
The sacrifices of the soldier's wife are as great, often greater, than those of 
the husband. McClellan's wife was a soldier's daughter. The spirit of 
obedience to the call of duty ruled them both alike. No words can fitly 
express the perfectness of that love which was the light of both their lives. 
It was expressed in a few lines of his letters which I have suffered to 
appear in this volume; in a thousand passages and words which are 
omitted. 

His life from April, 1861, to Nov., 1862, forms the subject of this nar- 
rative, which I have entitled "McClellan's Own Story." 

He was commissioned major-general of volunteers in Ohio on the 2id 
April, 1861. 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 3 

On the I4th May he was made major-general in the United States 
army and placed in command of the Department of the Ohio. 

On the 26th May he issued a proclamation to the Union men of West- 
ern Virginia, and an address to his soldiers whom he led to what has been 
known as the Western Virginia campaign. On the 22d July, having freed 
Western Virginia from secessionists and preserved its people to the Union, 
he was summoned to Washington, and, arriving there on the 26th, was 
assigned to command the Division of the Potomac. 

He found Washington in a perilous condition. The defeat at Bull 
Run had demoralized the administration and the army. No one had 
formed any, the most vague, idea of what was to be done or how to 
do anything. Up to this time the administration had shared with the 
people of the North and an unconsidering press the opinion that the rebel- 
lion was but a mob, to be scattered in one or two free fights by impetuous, 
onsets of patriotic men. Now the shout, "On to Richmond," had been 
suddenly and appallingly hushed. Paralysis had followed. Not even 
Scott or McDowell, or any military adviser of the administration and 
people, had thought of making ordinary military provision for the defence 
of Washington against an enemy whose shell might at any moment shat- 
ter the dome of the Capitol. The military condition of the whole country, 
Western Virginia alone excepted, was chaotic. 

Probably there were other men in America as well fitted by natural 
ability and education for the great work in hand, but they did not appear. 
No other one has been indicated as the proper man for the occasion. That 
occasion demanded a calm foresight of the vast needs of the country in the 
coming, the then present, peril, the ability to provide for every one of 
them, and the expression is homely but precise the staying power to 
make the provision perfectly, calmly, completely, unmoved by the cries, 
however honest and anxious, of an alarmed people, equally unmoved 
by the criticisms of the envious and the clamors of the unprincipled. 

If the wisdom which sought the ablest military advice in that moment 
of alarm had been displayed throughout the war by entrusting to military 
knowledge and ability the conduct of campaigns and the direction and 
execution of the work of war, the expense of treasure and blood would 
have been vastly less, and the end would have been much more speedy. 
Instead of this, after McClellan had assured the safety of the capital, 
and the alarm of the civilians had subsided, they assumed the direction, 
interfered with and delayed military preparations, and undertook the 
specific management of campaigns and armies, while they took care that 
the delays and defeats which they caused should be charged on soldiers in 
the field. 

We who were then living can with the utmost difficulty carry our 
minds back to the conditions under which McClellan was called to save 
the capital and country. It is impossible for the present'generation to 
realize the blindness of the people or appreciate the previsi-on of the young 
general. We now look back to all that which he foresaw, foretold, and 
provided for. So intense had been popular feeling, that it .was regarded 



4 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

as treason to think or say that secession was in great strength, that the 
South would not be easily conquered. 

He was alone in the clear atmosphere, above the scene of physical and 
political warfare, and saw what others could not or would not see. Mr. 
Lincoln probably came nearer to accepting his views than any one else. 
From this time on the President reposed confidence in him ; and there is 
small reason for doubt that, but for the interference of politicians, Lincoln 
and McClellan would have brought the war to an end in the summer of 
1862. But Mr. Lincoln soon had two wars on his hands. He was at the 
head of the Union and at the head of a political party. Both were threat- 
ened with division. He desired to save both, probably believing that the 
unity of his party was essential to the saving of the country. In this view 
can be explained much which is otherwise inexplicable in his dealings 
with the general, to whom up to the very last he gave the most frank and 
full private assurances of his confidence. 

The " staying" powers of McClellan were the salvation of the Union. 
Alone in his outlook, he was alone in the execution of his great work. 
The fortification of Washington accomplished, and a sufficient force 
organized and disciplined for its defence, he directed his labors to the 
next great need an army. The people, the sovereigns, had not the remot- 
est conception of the meaning of the word "army." Very few sol- 
diers in this country had grasped the idea. No one but McClellan had 
observed that the able and educated soldiers of the South had long been 
organizing that vast machine which, once created, moves with irresistible 
force over all obstacles until met by another machine of like construction 
and greater power, or which is handled with greater skill. The Army of 
the Potomac grew like a vast engine constructed by a master-mind. Its 
history is the reward of the constructor, ample, and the only reward he 
ever received. 

There was one characteristic of McClellan's mind which some would 
regard as a defect, and which certainly placed him at a disadvantage in 
his relations with the men in Washington. He was slow to suspect evil 
of any man. This trait was exhibited in his private life, and he never 
wholly lost it. The philosophic reader will find interest in the indications 
afforded in his letters of his gradual awakening to the controlling presence 
in Washington of a class of men known as politicians. Soldiers, accus- 
tomed to honest service for definite purposes, imbued with high principles 
of honor, can with difficulty recognize the existence of men in public life 
who are willing to manage public interests for private or party gain. 

He knew the past history of his country by heart. He remembered 
the illustrious names and records of men whose high ambition had been 
to serve the people as statesmen, whom no one had ever thought to charge 
with personal or party motive in any of their acts as trustees and represen- 
tatives of the people. Was the day of such American senators and repre- 
sentatives gone by ? Was legislation henceforth to be for the perpetuation 
of hold on office, for the success of party, with the mere pretence of good 
to country ? Now that the general trust of governmental powers had 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 5 

become a specific trust of blood to be poured out and treasure to be 
expended for the salvation of the Union, it did not occur to him that any 
of the trustees could dream of using that treasure and blood for personal 
advantage. When men professed honest patriotism he believed them. 

Nor do the people themselves, in times of excitement, yield readily 
to the belief that among their leaders are some who are not honest and 
patriotic. But in calm retrospect they are generally more wise. It would 
not be difficult already to make a catalogue of names of men who were 
prominent in Washington and elsewhere during the war, who secured for 
the time the reputation of patriotic leaders of opinion and directors of 
events, whose memories have been allowed, as they deserved, to rot. 

All our history demonstrates how such men abound, and secure 
influence and power at every seat of government, municipal and general, 
wherever patronage is to be distributed and money to be expended. 
They are very ignorant indeed who imagine, that, in the greatest oppor- 
tunity for such men ever afforded in America, there were none of them 
at the front. They were legion. 

The history of the war is inextricably involved in the history of party 
politics. No one can understand the former without knowledge of the 
latter. Nor can the great services of McCiellan be in any way estimated, 
his marvellous steadfastness in duty, his herculean work in Washington, 
and his brilliant career at the head of the Army of the Potomac, without 
giving full value to the fact that from a short time after his arrival in 
Washington politicians formed an enemy in his rear often more formid- 
able to him and his army than the enemy in their front toward whom 
alone the eyes of the people were then directed. 

The Republican party which re-elected Mr. Lincoln in 1864 was not 
the same party, either in principles or in voters, which had elected him in 
1860. The Democratic party of later years is not in any aspect the party 
of Mr. Buchanan's time. Old issues were dead, annihilated by the fire 
on Fort Sumter. The Republican party-machinery existed, the machine 
politicians held it in hand, and ardent partisans throughout the country 
kept up a semblance of party distinction by denouncing all opponents as 
sympathizers with secession and traitors. But in the early summer of 
1861 there was but one party in the North, the party of the Union and 
Constitution. Here and there was a Southern sympathizer whose utter- 
ances furnished material for newspapers and orators to grow wild about, 
but the number of these was insignificant. The entire body of the North- 
ern people were united in one sentiment. And this enthusiastic unani- 
mity was the more wonderful because there had been a very widespread 
sympathy in the North with the doctrine of secession, on which the 
leaders of the South had based much expectation. This sympathy was 
not in one political party alone. Startling as the statement may be to 
some, the fact is easily demonstrated that there had been as many if not 
more secessionists among Northern Republicans than Democrats. There 
is no more trustworthy indication of a man's political opinions than the 
doctrines taught by the newspaper he takes regularly and reads reli- 



6 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

giously. One powerful Northern journal taught that the right of secession 
was as clear as the rights asserted in the Declaration of Independence, 
that a Union pinned together by bayonets was not worth having, that the 
erring sisters ought to be let go. This journal claimed and had 200,000 
subscribers, which implies at least a half million regular readers, a large 
part of whom accepted the doctrine of secession. There was a body of 
men in the North, of considerable numbers, known as the Abolitionists, 
who had steadily advocated disunion, their motto being, " The Consti- 
tution of the United States is a league with death and a covenant with 
hell." Many of them were voters with the Republican party. It is there- 
fore unquestionable that a considerable portion of the Republican party 
had been indoctrinated into a belief not only of the right but of the de- 
sirableness of the secession of the Southern States. That a considerable 
portion of the Democrats had held the same views no one doubts. But 
the challenge to arms was accepted by Republicans and Democrats with 
one voice and act. All sympathy with secession vanished, and it would 
be absurd now to deny that there were as many Democrats as Republicans 
among the volunteer soldiery of the war. 

Ihe people and the army thought of one subject only the suppres- 
sion of the rebellion, while politicians, Democrats as well as Republi- 
cans, looked to the spoils of present power and the means of confirming 
that power in future elections. 

Congress, at the moment of McClellan's arrival in Washington, as 
if to instruct him in his duty, expressed the unanimous sentiment of the 
North in a resolution which declared "that the present deplorable civil 
war has been forced upon the country by the disunionists of the Southern 
States, now in revolt against the constitutional government, and in arms 
around the capital ; that in this national emergency Congress, banishing 
all feeling of mere passion or resentment, will recollect only its duty to its 
country ; that this war is not waged, on our part, in any spirit of oppres- 
sion, nor for any purpose of conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of over- 
throwing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those 
States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and 
to preserve the Union, with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the 
several States unimpaired ; and as soon as these objects are accomplished 
the war ought to cease." 

McClellan accepted this instruction. It expressed his own views and 
those of every lover of his country in the North. 

But if this purpose were achieved in this way the Southern States, 
kept in the Union by a strong hand, would reappear in future elections 
as a solid South against the machine politicians who had gained power 
in 1860. If the white vote could be suppressed and the slaves be freed 
with the immediate right of suffrage, their vote might be controlled and 
a solid South secured for those who had given them the right of voting. 
But how could the people be led to favor this policy ? 

Various schemes were devised to accomplish the desired end. For 
a time efforts were made to induce the North to adopt a policy which 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 7 

Mr. Chase formulated in an interview with Mr. Wade of the Senate and 
Mr. Ashley of the House, Dec. n, 1861. 

Mr. Chase said (Warden, p. 390) that a State attempting to secede, the 
State government being placed in hostility to the Federal government, 
*' the State organization was forfeited, and it lapsed into the condition 
of a Territory" ; that " we could organize territorial courts, and, as soon 
as it became necessary, a territorial government"; that "those States 
could not properly be considered as States in the Union, but must be 
readmitted from time to time as Congress should provide." Mr. Wade 
and Mr. Ashley were understood to concur in this doctrine ; and, as 
matter of fact, it was given out as sound doctrine and was widely 
advocated in newspapers and at war-meetings engineered by politicians 
in various parts of the North. 

Mr. Chase was too good a lawyer not to recognize the absurdity of 
the doctrine as American law. It was pure secession doctrine at bot- 
tom, and subversive of the whole system of government in all the States. 
The firmness of conservative Republicans, and the adherence of Mr. 
Lincoln to the doctrine of the Congressional resolution, kept a large por- 
tion of the people from accepting it. Perhaps the greatest service which 
Mr. Lincoln rendered his country was in the sagacious manner in which 
he prevented this revolutionary doctrine from becoming the avowed 
policy of a party. Its success would have been more fatal to the Con 
stitution than the acknowledgment of the Southern Confederacy. 

The abolition of slavery as " a war measure" was proposed and advo- 
cated at the same time. This was more popular. But neither Mr. Lincoln 
nor any military authority could perceive its practical use as a weapon of 
war, and, although a tremendous pressure was brought to bear on the 
President, he steadily refused to issue "a bull against a comet." The 
political position was therefore complicated. The process of coalition, by 
which politicians who had been Democrats as well as Republicans came 
together and formed the radical wing of the Republican party, is worthy 
the study of every one interested in the history of popular government. A 
powerful combination was formed. It had no leader, for too many of its 
members were " every man for himself," while each was seeking one or 
another personal benefit. Its common purpose was to manage the war in 
such way as to secure control of the country in the elections in 1864 and 
afterwards. 

There was a body of noble, conservative, and patriotic men in the 
old Republican party strong enough to interpose many obstacles in the way 
of the radicals. The latter adopted the customary tactics of unscrupulous 
partisans in this county, and visited on all who opposed them storms of 
foul epithets and charges of sympathy with the rebellion. Mr. Lincoln 
was alternately praised and vilified. But no one of the radical coalition 
was his friend or desired his continuance at the head of the party. Some 
old Democratic politicians, recognizing good prospects of its success, 
joined the radical part)'. Congress in time yielded to its control. A com- 
mittee called The Committee on the Conduct of the War was created, to

be the machine of partisan politics, in control of the most unscrupulous 
leaders of the combination, who used it to good effect in the deception of 
the confiding people of the country. 

It is profoundly interesting, and there is something grotesque in it 
also, to observe how the shrewd and far-seeing Lincoln kept the headship 
of both elements, conservative and radical, prevented their often-threat- 
ened division into two parties, defeated each of the rival candidates for his 
office, and finally compelled his own renomination and their support in his 
re-election. 

To secure for their purposes the leader of the armies had been one of 
the first and most important objects of the radicals. If a victor he was 
morally certain to become the idol of the people. "What can we make 
out of McClellan?" was the question of all ; "What can I make out of 
McClellan?" was the question of each. Thus in that marvellous apoca- 
lypse, his private diary, Mr. Chase writes (Warden, p. 500) that a friend 
said to him, " Col. Key often expressed his regret that McClellan had not 
conferred with me and acted in concert with me. I replied that I thought 
if he had that the rebellion would be ended now." "I ... was quite 
willing he should repeat to McClellan what I had said." Undoubtedly had 
McClellan attached himself to Mr. Chase, or any other Presidential candi- 
date, in the manner suggested, he would have been supported by a power- 
ful political combination. But the bargains of politics were foreign to his 
work and nature. He was creating an army and using it for the people, 
not for himself ; certainly not for Mr. Chase or any other aspirant to 
position. 

The success of McClellan in 1862 would have been doubly fatal to 
the politicians. The old Union would have been restored and the general 
would command the political situation. Therefore McClellan must not be 
successful. His popularity must be destroyed. Whatever of falsehood 
could be invented must be published concerning him. His successes 
must be decried. Above all, he must not be allowed to win a decisive 
victory. Neither a quick ending of the war nor a victorious campaign by 
McClellan would enure to party success. 

The argument of personal rivalry and party requirement was pressed 
on Mr. Lincoln without success. However loyal McClellan was to his 
country, the Secretary of the Treasury said he urged his removal because 
" he was not loyal to the administration." 

As it began to be evident that Mr. Lincoln would not adopt the radi- 
cal policy, nor discharge McClellan and appoint some general suited to 
radical purposes, nor manage war matters with special regard to future 
partisan considerations, it became important to gain the War Department, 
and place in it a secretary who would do what the President would not. 
Thus the course of the war could be controlled, generals could be driven 
with reins, the President himself could be deceived, misled, to some 
extent managed. 

Mr. Edwin M. Stanton was selected, and Mr. Chase, with great adroit- 
ness, described by himself, induced Mr. Lincoln to appoint him as sue- 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 9 

cessor to Mr. Cameron. The religious emotion with which Mr. Chase 
recorded the success of this scheme indicates the view he had of its 
vital importance to the radical cause. 

Mr. Stanton was a lawyer of moderate abilities, a man of peculiar 
mental constitution. Without moral principle or sense of personal honor, 
ke was equally ready to change front in public politics and to betray pri- 
vate friendship, and was therefore eminently suited to the purposes for 
which he was selected by the men with whom he had formed a secret 
alliance. But he was as untrustworthy in that as in other associations, 
and at the very moment when Mr. Chase, confiding in him, was intriguing 
to bring him into the cabinet, he betrayed Mr. Chase's confidences and 
defeated his plans, for his own purposes. Those who knew him well were 
in the habit of describing him as one of those who "always kick down the 
ladder by which they have climbed." His ambition was unbounded and 
his self-reliance absolute. He did not depend, as do ordinary politicians, 
on a larger or smaller body of followers and political dependants. No one 
shared his aspirations, and none were to claim gratitude or reward in his 
successes. 

All times of great popular excitement and national peril bring into 
view remarkable characters. None more remarkable than his appears in 
the history of the civil war ; none will be a more interesting subject to 
the student of human nature. With opportunity to achieve greatness and 
win a people's gratitude such as few others had, he used it in such way 
that in the calm retrospect of a quarter of a century his countrymen look 
at him with sorrowful shame, and few name him with respect, except here 
and there a survivor of the alliance whose purposes he served. He was 
supposed to be energetic, but he was only spasmodic, and in his spasms 
of impulsive judgment and action committed errors costly beyond all mea- 
surement in the money of the treasury and the lives of soldiers. Himself 
honest in money matters, a host of plunderers fattened without check on 
the money provided by the people and scattered in his improvident and 
reckless management of the department. With the men and means 
lavishly placed at his disposal by the people, a War Secretary of sound 
sense, cool discretion, honest purpose, and the good judgment to accept 
military advice and instruction for military operations, would have con- 
ducted the war at an expense of hundreds where it was thousands of mil- 
lions. But Mr. Stanton's errors of self-reliance were aggravated by the 
fact that he not only had no military knowledge, but by his peculiar dispo- 
sition was incapacitated to receive military instruction. A very foolish 
letter which he published revealed his ignorance of the simplest principles 
on which success in war depends. His suspension of all recruiting at the 
moment of opening active operations in the field was a blunder unparal- 
leled in military history, as well as a crime. His inability to receive mili- 
tary instruction has singular illustration in a letter, recently made public,*

June 8, 1886. 



IO BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

which he wrote to a friend a few weeks after the siege of Yorktown. 
When McClellan entered on the Peninsular campaign his entire plan 
of campaign rested on his purpose to throw the ist corps in rear of 
Yorktown, turn that fortified position, and clear the way for a rapid ad- 
vance to Richmond. The withdrawal of the ist corps from his army 
at the very instant it was to have been thus utilized defeated the plan 
of campaign, rendered necessary the siege of Yorktown and the adop- 
tion of a new plan with a reduced army. Innumerable letters and de- 
spatches besides those given in McClellan's narrative made these facts 
clear to all, excepting the War Department. Mr. Stanton wrote in this 
private letter to a confidential friend: ''The force retained from his 
[McClellan's] expedition was not needed, and could not have been employed 
by him " ! 

One of his co-secretaries says that his hostility to McClellan began 
when he entered the cabinet. He was, indeed, but one of the organized 
enemy in the rear of the Army of the Potomac and their commander, but 
he was the executive of their plots as well as of his own. Professing 
always devoted personal attachment to and admiration of the general, he 
opened his private correspondence with his wife ; circulated with vindic- 
tive malice falsehoods and slanders, petty and great, to his injury ; mis- 
represented him to. and sought to embroil him wilh, the President ; and 
deliberately planned and executed the defeat of the Peninsular campaign. 
The accusation is most grave and terrible ; but it was made to him in per- 
son by the general of the army, and his reception of it was a confession 
of its awful truth. For at midnight, June 27-28, when McClellan found 
his army in the toils into which Mr. Stanton had led them and there aban- 
doned them, the general, anticipating his own possible death with thou- 
sands of the men he loved, sent a despatch to the secretary the like of 
which was never sent by commander in the field to superior at home. 
Every line was weighty, every word solemn. It was the free outpouring 
of a great soul conscious of the approach of death. There are no era- 
sures in the original draft which lies before me. It concluded with this 
denunciation : " If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no 
thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington. You have done yotir 
best to sacrifice this army," 

The secretary received the accusation in silence which was the con- 
fession of its truth. If it were not true, McClellan deserved, and would 
have received, quick punishment for the gross insubordination, and the 
country would have justified any imposed penalty. If Mr. Stanton had 
dared dispute its truth and appeal on the facts to the honest judgment of 
a court-martiai or the country, he would, of course, have done so. Not 
only did he fail to resent it, but he kept the despatch secret ; and when, 
some time later, it was laid before the Committee on the Conduct of the 
War, the concluding sentences above quoted were suppressed ! It appears 
thus mutilated in that mnss of worthless because falsified and untrust- 
worthy rubbish which forms a large part of the printed report of that com- 
mittee. The secretary's personal reply to the general was the affectionate

letter of July 3 professing his devotion. His practical reply was to go 
with Mr. Chase to the President and urge the sending of Gen. Pope to 
supersede McClellan. 

The soldiers of the Union went into the field everywhere with a mind 
of this sort to use them as it would. If conscience ever asserted itself in 
that strange mind, always alternating in passionate emotions of anger and 
fear, the set faces of a half-million dead soldiers must have haunted it 
waking and sleeping. 

While politicians were plotting McClellan was working. It is impos- 
sible to over-estimate the laborious character of the general's life. His 
whole soul was in his work ; his every energy and thought was given to it. 
He was always, while in Washington and while in the field, in the habit of 
seeing personally, as far as possible, to the execution of important orders. 
Out of countless illustrations of this which might be given, let one suffice. 
The lieutenant-colonel of that superb regiment, the ist Conn. Artillery, 
wrote to me from the works before Yorktown that, a little after midnight 
the previous rainy night, while the men were at work in the trenches, 
McClellan rode up, attended by a single orderly, sprang from his horse, 
inspected the work, gave some directions, remounted, and rode away. 
About three A.M. he reappeared as before, approved the work, gave fur- 
ther directions, and vanished. My correspondent met him at his head- 
quarters before seven A.M., and also met there a friend, whose regiment 
was stationed some miles away, who told him that the general had sur- 
prised them by a visit and inspection at about two A.M. The soldiers 
soon learned not to be surprised at his appearance among them anywhere, 
at any hour of day or night. 

He made Washington secure, he created the Army of the Potomac, 
he gathered the vast material for a war. Called to the chief command, he 
brought order out of chaos in all the armies ; he organized the first and 
only plan for the war in all the country ; he sent successful expeditions, 
with detailed orders, to North Carolina, New Orleans, and elsewhere, in 
pursuance of his comprehensive scheme, in which concerted action every- 
where was to be in direct relation to the chief act the taking of Rich- 
mond. On this plan the war went on after his retirement. When he was 
ready to wield the vast power he had created, he left Washington at the 
head of the Army of the Potomac to strike the decisive blow at Rich- 
mond. Instantly the operations of the enemy in the rear began. He was 
removed from the command-in-chief, and no successor appointed. All 
his comprehensive plan was shattered. The War Secretary, succeeding 
practically to the command, neglected even to carry out his orders for 
the completion of the defences of Washington. The subsequent defeat of 
Pope was directly chargeable to this neglect, and other like neglects led 
to other disasters. 

When he reached the Peninsula and met the enemy his army was sud- 
denly reduced by the withdrawal of one-third of its force. He had planned 
to turn Yorktown ; he now went over it. The country rang with the pre- 
concerted outcry which the politicians raised. The siege of Yorktown 



12 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

was denounced as slow. It occupied less than twenty days, and has no 
parallel for swiftness in the history of the. war. 

The plan of campaign having been overturned by the reduction of the 
army, the general formed a new plan and advanced rapidly on it. Again 
the War Department interfered and defeated it, ordering him to stretch 
his right to the north of Richmond to effect the junction of McDowell's 
corps, now promised, but to come overland. Again and again McDowell 
was coming, but never came. His advance was within sound of McClel- 
lan's cannon when he was finally withdrawn. Assuredly if the Secretary 
had deliberately planned the destruction of the army he would have given 
precisely the orders he did, and would have handled the ist corps exactly 
as he did handle it. No trap could have been better set by an enemy. 
Only the consummate generalship of McClellan and the heroism of the 
Army of the Potomac in the successful battles of the Seven Days saved it 
from the fate to which it had been consigned. 

The Army of the Potomac was recalled to Washington instead of 
being reinforced on the banks of the James. All the lives and all the 
agonies of the country which were expended in regaining that same posi- 
tion two years afterwards were wasted for the only purpose of getting rid 
of McClellan. 

There are many open questions in regard to the treatment which 
McClellan received from the power behind the throne in Washington, 
which will be answered only when more such records as Mr. Chase's 
private diary shall be discovered and published. Why was Gen. Halleck 
authorized to assure McClellan that he was recalled to Washington to take 
command of the combined forces, his own army and Gen. Pope's? Was 
there then, and continuously afterward, in the minds of Mr. Stanton and his 
associates, a fear of McClellan and the army? The charge was not infre- 
quently made that he intended to seize the government. The devotion of 
the army to him, with their indignation at his and their treatment by the 
War Department, might arouse apprehension in minds not noted for per- 
sonal courage. It is no secret that this fear prevailed in the War Depart- 
ment after Sept. 2, and especially when the final order was sent relieving 
McClellan. Possibly such apprehension had something to do with the 
holding out to the general the idea that he was to command the combined 
forces, and with the adoption of the plan of withdrawing the army from his 
command instead of relieving him. That the President had no part in this 
ultimate purpose can hardly be doubted. He honestly desired to see an 
army always between Washington and the enemy, nor did he or Mr. Stanton 
learn till years afterward, when Grant was south of Richmond, the military 
truth which McClellan reiterated, that the true defence of Washington 
was on the bank of the James river. 

It is hardly worth while now to say that if any such fears prevailed 
among the men in Washington it was because they could not realize the 
possible existence of such an upright, pure, and unselfish servant of his 
country as McClellan. He entertained no thought of anything to be 
done by him except duty. Absolutely obedient to orders, he accepted as 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 13 

his work whatever his superiors set before him. It was not till the fate 
of the country depended on his assuming power and exercising it with- 
out orders that, staking his life for the people, he led the army to South 
Mountain and Antietam. 

There is no passage in the history of any man who has ever lived 
more startling in the contrasts it presents than the story of McClellan's 
recall and return to Washington. The commander who had for months 
been the victim of political intrigues, baffled in every effort to serve his 
country, ordered against his judgment and protest hither and thither by 
ignorant and inimical superiors, the general loving and loved by a great 
army now removed from his command, sat, or paced to and fro, with a 
little group of staff officers and a few wounded veterans around him in his 
tent, listening in anxiety beyond words to the sound of distant cannon firing 
on his old troops, and was even compelled to ask the password for the 
night from the military governor of the small city in whose outskirts his 
tent was pitched. His personal enemies had triumphed. The war was 
now to be very long and very bloody. They had effected his disgrace. 
But a few hours changed the scene. The defeated army of the Union was 
rushing homeward in broken masses. An exultant enemy was marching 
on the capital. The War Secretary and the nominal general-in-chief, 
the trustees of the Union and the military heads of the squad of politicians 
who had brought about the disaster, had ordered the arsenal to be emptied 
and abandoned it was said also, to be burned. Frightened at the awful 
catastrophe they had caused, the politicians disappeared from sight and 
were not seen or heard by the people again until, with recovered breath, 
in assured safety, they reopened their attack on the general toward whom, 
for the time, all eyes in the land were directed as the only possible saviour 
of his country. 

The people, in the person of their President, who alone in Washington 
preserved sound judgment and a serene mind, went to the lately insulted 
and displaced general, and, with tears not unfitting the occasion (for his 
tears were the emotion of a betrayed and outraged nation), asked him to 
forget his wrongs and save the country. The falsehood was afterward 
circulated that he hesitated and sought to make conditions. He accepted 
the new responsibility instnntly, for every second was of priceless value. 
He saved the arsenal which cowardice would have destroyed. The wild 
scene of joy with which the army received him can never be the subject 
of the artist's pencil, for it was in the darkness of night, among the Vir- 
ginia forests, when the good horse of the general, accompanied by one 
faithful aide, the gallant Colburn, brought him at ihat tremendous pace 
the soldiers knew, to meet them retreating, gloomy as the black night that 
lay on the hills around them. But the wild shout of welcome that rolled 
from company to company and corps to corps was prophetic of South 
Mountain and Antietam 

Who shall say that the soldiers of the Army of the Potomac did not 
know that man, and that he did not merit their admiring love ? 

He gathered them in his hand. He made a new army of the defeated, 



14 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

disorganized, and decimated regiments of his own army and the Army of 
Virginia, reorganized it and supplied its pressing needs as it marched, 
followed and overtook the exultant enemy, flushed with success, in Mary- 
land, and in fifteen days after that night of disastrous retreat led his 
heroic troops to the victorious fields of South Mountain and Antietam. 

It is one of the settled truths of history that constant reiteration of a 
statement, however untrue, will impress many minds with its truthfulness. 
The impatience of the people afforded to the enemies of McClellan the 
opportunity to represent him as constitutionally slow. There are not a 
few who believe it. There was no foundation for the slur ; and any one 
who studies dates and informs himself of the actual time occupied by him 
in any of his work will be surprised at the currency which such a criticism 
obtained. He was calm and cool in judgment, never impulsive, but 
always as rapid in action as the circumstances required. If campaigns 
are to be compared, it is well to note that in the West Virginia and the 
Maryland campaigns he was his own master and director, while the 
Peninsular campaign was actually three several campaigns, so made by 
the interference of the War Department, and all three subject to that con- 
stant interference. 

The order of Aug. 30 had removed McClellan from the command of 
the Army of the Potomac. The order of Sept. 2 had only placed him in 
command of the fortifications of Washington. The history of this order 
is sufficiently discussed in a note on page 538, etc. He had, for the safety 
of the country and the preservation of the Union, assumed command and 
fought the battles of South Mountain and Antietam with "a halter around 
his neck." No change was made in his command after the battle of 
Antietam. The entire confidence with which he had received the orders 
of the President on the morning of Sept. 2 was characteristic. When 
asked afterward why he did not on that occasion ask written orders, he 
replied, with a smile, "It was no time for writing, and in fact I never 
thought of it." 

The President fully approved of his determination not to lead the 
army on an offensive campaign into Virginia without shoes, clothing, and 
supplies, and without horses for cavalry and transportation. The table 
which will be found on pages 632, 633 of this volume demonstrates 
beyond cavil both the necessities of the troops and the dates at which 
they were supplied. Without supplies, cavalry, or transportation, no 
general would have moved an hour sooner than he did. When ready 
he moved with his accustomed rapidity and skill. The movement 
accomplished his purpose. He had placed the enemy at a fatal disadvan- 
tage. If he were brought to battle there was no reasonable doubt that 
McClellan had so divided him that he would be beaten in detail. If he 
declined battle the Army of the Potomac had the inside track in a race 
to Richmond. In either event McClellan was about to win another and 
a decisive victory. 

Some one reported to the politicians in Washington the imminent 
danger of a great Union victory by the army under McClellan. Perhaps 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 15 

when time reveals correspondence it will be known who sent the intelli- 
gence. McClellan's despatches had communicated facts, not expecta- 
tions. There was no visible reason for interfering with him at this 
moment. But the final pressure now brought to bear on the President 
was successful. He issued a discretionary order to Gen. Halleck, who 
made haste to exercise the discretion at once, and Nov. 5, 1862, McClellan 
was ordered to turn over the command to Burnside and go to Trenton, 
N. J. He lies there now on a hill overlooking the Delaware. But he 
never received there, or elsewhere, order, thanks, or any recognition from 
the government of his country. 

Nor did he ever expect or desire it. To him, as to all pure minds, 
the ample compensation for labor and self-sacrifice was in the conscious- 
ness of duty done. He held himself in readiness to serve the cause 
should his services be needed, but they were not sought. 

In 1864 the political elements were still in a chaotic condition. Two 
parties had been evolved from the exciting conditions caused by the war 
and the ambitions of politicians. The great body of conservative men 
were practically unattached to either. The Democratic party nominated 
him for the Presidency. His reluctant acceptance of the nomination was 
a new service, not his smallest, to the Republic, concentrating the con- 
servative element in the country on a platform which he made for himself 
in his letter of acceptance, placing his supporters firmly on the principle 
of supporting the war and prosecuting it vigorously till the Union and 
Constitution should be established in safety. How many votes he received 
will never be known, for the " count " was in the hands of those who 
had not scrupled to defeat him in battles with the enemies of the Union. 
The soldiers' votes were effectually disposed of by the Secretary of War. 

He had not expected to be elected, and the result was a great relief 
to him. His earnest desire had always been to regain the enjoyments of 
home life, of which he had had so brief an experience. 

He resigned his commission as major-general in the army on the day 
of the Presidential election, Nov. 8, 1864, and immediately sought work 
as a civilian for the support of his family. 

But the bitterness of political enmity followed him into private life. 
His eminent abilities made his services desirable to many great cor- 
porations, and he was offered one and another position of honorable 
employment, such as he desired. In each case he ascertained that the 
offer was made by a majority over a minority who had strong prejudices 
against him and opposed his appointment. Acceptance was impossible 
to him under such circumstances. In Jan., 1865, he went to Europe with 
his family. His reasons were sad enough, expressed to me in a sentence 
I well remember : V I cannot find a place to earn my living here, and I 
am going to stay abroad till I am forgotten, then come back and find 
work, which I may get when these animosities have cooled down." 

But the people would not forget him. In 1868, when it was rumored 
that he was coming home, soldiers and citizens proposed to receive him 
with honors. He wrote emphatically protesting against any such demon- 



Z 6 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

stration, and after his return insisted on declining it. The demand of his 
old comrades and friends became so pressing that he at last consented to 
receive a procession on a designated evening a few days in advance, pro- 
vided it should be spontaneous, without previous advertisement in news- 
papers. He expected a few hundred old soldiers and friends, and an 
affair of a few minutes. Instead he received the most impressive ovation 
which has ever been given to a private citizen of this country, perhaps not 
excepting those in times of the highest political excitement. The vast 
and broad procession of men who honored him passed hour after hour in 
front of the balcony on which he stood, while fifty or a hundred thousand 
crowded the street and square to witness and share in the demonstration. 
At midnight that night he said to me : " Well, it is over now, and I hope 
I can be quiet hereafter." But an American with such a hold on the 
hearts of people cannot be quiet. 

There was no man in America, up to the day of his death, to whom so 
many of his fellow-citizens were attached by ties of affection and respect. 
There was what men call a magnetism about him which won all hearts. To 
politicians such a man, honest and unapproachable, is always a subject 
of apprehension. Party politicians, Democrats as well as Republicans, 
feared him as a possible rival or opponent. He received no favors 
from either, and to his death owed no gratitude to either party or any of 
their leaders. He was as carefully neglected by one as by the other, ex- 
cept when his great personal influence was wanted in a political campaign. 

He established his residence, known as Mayvvood, on Orange Moun- 
tain, in New Jersey, where he built a house, and brought around him 
treasures of literature and art, memorials of faithful friends, of far travel, 
of scenes in his life which were pleasant to remember. Conspicuous in 
his own room was a shining mass of the long black hair of the horse Dan 
Webster, faithful among the faithful on a score of battle-fields. 

In 1877 he was elected Governor of New Jersey. Had it been possi- 
ble for Democratic party politicians to control the nomination he would 
not have been selected. His administration was eminently successful, 
rich in benefit to the educational, industrial, and judicial systems of the 
State, and wholly free from partisanship. And here it may be aJded that 
his experience had taught him to recognize the party politician whenever 
he came in contact with one, and to estimate him at his precise worth. He 
had accepted the governorship, urged on him, as an opportunity of doing 
good service to his State ; but he was glad when the end of his term of 
office came. He had resolved to pass the remainder of his life as a pri- 
vate citizen. During its later years he went abroad several times, to 
Europe, Egypt, and the Holy Land, enjoying travel and study and the 
pleasure of warm social intercourse with many of the most distinguished 
soldiers, statesmen, and scholars of various countries, who were his cor- 
respondents and friends. His ample knowledge of modern languages 
made him at home in all countries, and enabled him to accumulate stores 
of information. He was thoroughly familiar with the progress of political 
as well as military thought and events in Europe and at home. 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. I 7 

In the autumn of 1885 he had several severe attacks of pain in the 
region of the heart. After one of these he yielded to the advice of his 
excellent physician and remained at home, resting for some days. On 
the afternoon of Oct. 28 he drove out with his daughter, and passed the 
evening in pleasant conversation with his family. Towards eleven o'clock, 
after the evening prayers which were the family custom, he went to his 
working-room, wrote for a brief time, and then went to bed, taking, as he 
generally did, a book, which he read for a while. A sharp attack of the 
same acute pain suddenly seized him. The physician summoned to his 
side administered remedies, but the agony continued. He left his bed for 
a large chair in which he sat. No expression of suffering escaped him. 
On the contrary, he spoke only cheerfully and pleasantly to the servants 
whom he was sorry to call up, and to his wife and daughter, to whom he 
once in a while addressed a bright word of affection. About three o'clock 
in the morning he looked towards Mrs. McClellan and said in a low voice 
to the physician, "Tell her I am better now." The next moment his head 
rested on the chair-back and the good soldier was gone. The rewards 
which are withheld here, whether by reason of the malice of enemies or 
the neglect of friends, are of no account there. 

His 'funeral was, in accordance with his own wishes often expressed, 
that of a private citizen. His body was brought to New York to my 
house, in which he had always been at home. While thousands of 
citizens filled the neighboring streets, he lay life-like, and around him 
stood a group of great men. The commanders of the opposing armies 
which had met at Yorktown and in the Peninsular campaign were both 
there one living, the other dead. Strong men, generals, old soldiers of 
many battle-fields, his comrades and his foes, looked at his calm face. I 
have never seen, never expect to see again, such a scene, so many stout 
men in tears. Such eyes shed tears only for the great and good. 

Then followed the simple services in the Madison Square Presbyte- 
rian Church, of which he had been a member until he became a ruling 
elder in the church at Orange. From the church he was carried to Tren- 
ton. Great throngs awaited the arrival of the train at the station and 
crowded the streets through which the procession passed for two miles. 
Thousands of silent mourners were assembled in the cemetery. His grave 
was in his private plot, on a hill overlooking the flow of the Delaware. A 
clergyman, one who loved him, said the last words of faith and hope as he 
was laid in the grave. So we buried him. 

Most public men live two lives the one that which the people see, 
the other that which none see unless it be a few intimate friends and com- 
panions of hours of freedom. McClellan, the soldier and patriot, is well 
known to the people, has been diversely judged by them according to the 
amount of correct information they have received, and according to those 
prejudices of political and other associations which affect all our opinions 
of public men of our own time. 

Whatever be their judgment of the soldier and statesman, few if any 



I 8 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

outside of the circle of his intimate friends have had any idea of the real 
man. Public men are too often measured by the familiar standards of 
public life. He was a man such as we seldom know. His experiences in 
life were varied. Educated as a soldier, he had devoted his life to his 
profession, and was one of the most accomplished military scholars of the 
world. His military library was large, in various languages, always 
increasing, every book thoroughly studied. He continued these studies 
faithfully to his death. Military operations in every part of the world 
commanded his close observation. He supplied himself with maps and 
all information in current literature, followed movements of armies, kept 
himself familiar with every phase of campaigns, whether in Europe, in 
Afghanistan, in Egypt, or in South Africa. 

While this was his professional study, he occupied himself with 
almost equally thorough study of subjects very remote from military 
matters. He was a general student of the literature of the world. He 
read freely most of the languages of Europe, and kept up with the pro- 
gress of thought and discussion in history, philosophy, and art. He was 
especially interested in archaeology, and, having all his life retained and 
used his knowledge of ancient languages, found abundant delight in read- 
ing archseologic publications and in following the work of explorers. In 
all departments of scholarly reading he was constant and unwearying, and 
he never forgot what he had once learned. Fitted by his attainments for 
the society of the learned, he had the marked characteristic of the true scho- 
lar the desire to know more, and therefore the habit of seeking instead 
of offering information. Few suspected his mastery of subjects on which 
he only asked questions when thrown in contact with recognized masters. 
In general conversation he more frequently sought information than gave 
it; but when drawn out to give it his expression was cortcise, vigorous, 
clear. His extended knowledge of ancient and modern languages made 
him master of his own. His public papers are models of pure style. 
His habit of writing was swift, and he never hesitated for the precise word 
to express the exact shade of meaning he intended. His despatch-books, 
containing the autograph originals of his despatches during the war, are 
marvels, since, with whatever haste he wrote, he wrote without erasure or 
alteration on subjects where each word was of vital importance. 

That his life was one of constant occupation may be judged from 
what has been said. He had no idle hours for those cannot be called 
idle which were given to social duties and the enjoyments of that home life 
whose beauty and happiness were perfect. His wife and children were 
his companions, and a perpetual sunshine was in the household. He was 
full of cheer, life, vigor, always ready for whatever would make any one 
of them happy. 

And this leads me to say that of all men I have ever known McClellan 
was the most unselfish. Neither in his public life nor in his private life 
did he ever seek anything for himself. He was constantly doing some- 
thing for some one else; always seeking to do good, confer pleasure, 
relieve sorrow, gratify a whim, do something for another. He had his own 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 1 9 

amusements, but in those he sought the good of others. He had devcrted 
a great deal of attention to ceramic art, and had collected many fine 
examples. He was an excellent judge of genuineness of specimens. But 
his love of " old china " was not for mere pleasure it was for historical 
and industrial considerations ; and New Jersey owes him a vastly larger 
debt than she knows for the great advance made in her pottery produc- 
tions through his special personal efforts while and after he was governor 
of that State. In his elegant home, with ample table furniture of old 
historic porcelains, gathered with admirable judgment and taste in his 
European trips, he was especially proud of, and fond of using and show- 
ing, beautiful services made at Trenton in potteries which he often visited, 
and to whose advancement he had, while governor and afterward, directed 
earnest attention. 

The personal affection which existed between McClellan and the sol- 
diers of the Army of the Potomac is historical. It grew with years on both 
sides. On his it was a marked trait of his character. He would make 
great sacrifices of his own pleasure and comfort to render a service to any 
one of them. They were a vast family, and not a few of them came to him 
for aid in distress. None came in vain. 

His charity was abundant. He sympathized with every one who was 
in trouble or sorrow ; and his sympathy was practical and useful, for his 
person and his purse were devoted to its uses. An Irish servant in a New 
York house saw her brother's name in the list of killed at Antietam, 
and started off forthwith to find his grave. When she came back she told 
her story to the family. She found her way to the battle-field, and after a 
while to the graves where some one told her the men of her brother's regi- 
ment were buried. It was a lonesome place above ground then, for the 
army had moved away. She was searching among the graves for a familiar 
name on the stakes, when she saw, riding down the road which passed at 
some distance from the burial place, what she called a lot of soldiers on 
horseback. When they came abreast of her the leader, who was a little 
in advance, called a halt, sprang to the ground, and walked across the 
open field to her. " What are you looking for, my good woman ?" he said. 
She told him. "What was your brother's regiment?" She answered. 
" You are only one of thousands who want to know to-day where their 
dead are lying here," he said. " I hope you will find your brother's 
grave. Don't mourn too much for him. He died a soldier's death." 
Then, turning, he called, "Orderly!" A soldier came. " Stay with this 
woman and help her find her brother's grave. Report to me this even- 
ing." And he went back, remounted, and the company rode on at a gal- 
lop. After a while the orderly found the grave, and she knelt there and 
prayed. Then she asked the soldier: "Who was that gentleman that 
told you to help me?" "That?" said the orderly. "Why, didn't you 
know him? That was ' Little Mac.' "God bless him ! I said," was 
the end of her story. Innumerable like prayers of grateful souls of 
men and women, with those words, "God bless him!" have "battered 
the gates of heaven." 



2Q BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

It is surely unnecessary to say that he was a gentleman in every sense 
of the word. In social life he was perfectly simple in his manner, wholly 
unaffected, always genial, having rare conversational powers with all 
classes of persons, devoutly respectful to ladies. This deference to the 
female sex was a marked characteristic. I note an illustration of it which 
I find in many of his private letters, some in this volume. When at the 
head of the army, and occupying a position only second to the President, 
he received thousands of visitors who came from mere curiosity, intro- 
duced by senators or others, to see the young general. In mentioning 
such visits he invariably says that he "was presented to the ladies" 
never uses what would have been a perfectly correct expression under the 
circumstances : *' the ladies were presented to me." 

In person McClellan was five feet nine inches tall, with great breadth 
of shoulders and solid, not superfluous, muscle. He measured forty-five 
inches around the chest. His physical strength in his younger life was 
very great. He seldom exerted it in later years. He contracted disease in 
the Mexican war which never wholly left him, and which doubtless some- 
what impaired his strength. But in 1863 I have seen him bend a quarter- 
dollar over the end of his thumb by pressure between the first and second 
finger of his hand. That same evening we were sitting together, three, 
one of whom was a distinguished officer who weighed over two hundred 
and fifty. " They tell me, general," said I, "that McClellan can throw 
you over his head." " So they say," was the somewhat uncertain response. 
McClellan sprang from his chair and crossed the room rapidly with hands 
stretched out to seize the giant. " Let me alone, general ! " he exclaimed 
" let me alone ! He can do it he has done it. He can toss me in his 
arms like a baby." To the very last day of his life his step was quick, 
firm, elastic, the expression of that uniform cheerfulness, buoyancy, and 
enjoyment of life which he possessed and which he always communicated 
to those around him. I think I shall be understood in saying that his ph)*- 
sical bearing was such that of all men he was the very last with whom 
those who knew him could connect any thought of death. 

I have left to the last to speak of the controlling featare of McClel- 
lan's character and life. His religion was deep, earnest, practical; not 
vague or ill-defined to himself or others, not obtrusive, but outspoken 
when occasion required, and, when outspoken, frank and hearty. For it 
was part and parcel of his soul. I must use brief words, and I seek to 
make them distinct, in defining his creed, which was clear as crystal, 
more 'Steadfast than the hills the faith once delivered to the saints in its 
pure simplicity. With his intellectual powers, which were of the highest, 
and with his heart, which was supremely gentle, as trustful all his life as 
any child's, he was servant and follower of Jesus Christ, in whom he 
believed as God, of God. 

In all his life, public and private, every purpose was formed, every 
ac< done in the light of that faith. It was this which not only produced in 
him that stainless purity of walk and conversation which all who knew him 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 21 

recognized, but also gave him strength for all the great works of a great 
life. It was this which created that magnetic power so often spoken of, 
won to him that marvellous devotion of his soldiers, made all who knew 
him regard him with affection, those who knew him best love him most. 

Out of the private correspondence which has come into my hands I 
have selected, and venture to make public here, two letters. These, better 
than anything I can say, will serve to open, for those who only knew him 
as a public man, a view of that inner life his real life which he lived 
among his familiar friends : 

" NEW YORK, Aug. 18, 1879. 

"Mv DEAR GENERAL: Passing through South Street I saw a magni- 
ficent yacht-like ship, apparently new, called the Gen. McClellan. You 
have probably seen her. If not, she deserves a visit. lam sure you are 
tired of being governor or anything else, for, no matter what the title be, 
the result is always the same work, work unceasingly. Now, suppose 
we gather our household gods and sail away in this good ship, until we 
come to ' the land where it is always afternoon ' ? This would be better 
than Orange Mountain or the salt sea of Long Island. 

" With kind regards to Mrs. McClellan, believe me, yours, 

" S. L. M. BARLOW. 

" Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

ORANGE, Sept. 3, 1879. 

MY DEAR SAM : Your welcome note of the iSth Aug. reached me when 
on the point of starting off for a trip from home. I was very glad to see 
those "leaning-back" characters once more. 

Some few years ago I saw near Mr. Alsop's office a ship named for 
me, probably the same you saw the other day. I fancy, Sam, that we will 
never reach that "land where it is always afternoon "in any ship built 
by mortal hands. Our fate is to work, and still to work, as long as there 
is any work left in us ; and I do not doubt that it is best. For I can't help 
thinking that, when we reach that other and far better land, we shall still 
have work to do throughout the long ages, only we will then see, as we 
go on, that it is all done for the Master and under His own eye ; and we 
will like it, and never grow weary of it, as we often do here when we don't 
clearly see to what end we are working, and our work brings us in contact 
with all sorts of men and things not pleasant to rub against. I suppose 
that the more we work here the better we shall be trained for that other 
work, which, after all, is the great end towards which we move, or ought 
to be moving. 

Well, I did not start out to sermonize, but somehow or other your 
letter started my thoughts in that direction. I would like to take the 
"belongings" and sail for that quiet land ; but we will have to wait some 
little time yet, and I suppose each one will reach it alone, and the first 
arrived wait for the others. 

I hear that Elsie is to leave you in October. Is it possible that time 
can fly so rapidly? Before many years May will perhaps leave us; and 
just now we are getting ready lo send Max to boarding-school an awful 
business, as you can tell from your own experience in sending Pete to 
Dr. Coit's. I think this scattering of children is the worst wrench we 
get down here ; but there is nothing to be done but do the best for 
them as we understand it, and to thank God that they don't and can't feel 
it as we do. 

What changes since we first crossed the Atlantic together how many 
years ago? Whe.t a mess in politics ! lam trying to take the least pos-

sible interest in such matters, as the only way to keep one's temper. Mrs. 
McClellan unites with me in love to Mrs. Barlow, Elsie, and yourself. 
And I am always your friend, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN. 
S. L. M. B. 

In editing this volume for the press I have tried to do that which my 
friend would approve. The discretion which he gave me was ample. I 
have exercised it by omissions, not by changes. Of course his work was 
unfinished when he left it. Living prepared for the call whenever it might 
come, serving God as he had served his country, always ready for what- 
ever command he might receive, it is nevertheless certain that, when the 
order came to go to duty in another life, he was not expecting it. 

In writing his memoirs he had made no haste to complete them. Pro- 
bably had he lived 10 extreme old age there would still have been much to 
be written. For years after the civil war he declined to write anything 
about it. He had no anxieties for himself and his own reputation. An 
abiding faith in time and the calm judgment of his country kept him from 
any care about the misstatements, misrepresentations, and falsehoods of 
which he, more perhaps than any American who had lived before him, 
excepting Washington, had been made the subject. Besides, he always 
gave less thought to himself and his own reputation than any man I ever 
knew or heard of. He was a man of very deep feeling, with the passions 
of all ardent souls ; but so absolute had become his habitual self-control 
and subjection of all passionate resentment, so complete the self-abne- 
gation which characterized him, 1 can affirm with certainty that he always 
felt more sorrow for the man who maligned him than for himself. Once 
when I showed him a slander, a pure fabrication, which had been pub- 
lished on the authority of Gen. Burnside, he read it, laid down the maga- 
zine with a quiet laugh, said, "Poor Burn! he didn't know what he 
was saying," and, after a few kindly words about his old friend, dropped 
the subject. In vain was he urged to publish the demonstrations he pos- 
sessed of the falsehood of this and similar attacks. 

His happiness in life consisted in what he was always doing for 
others, without thought of self. As he had never sought position, com- 
mand, or promotion, so he never asked his countrymen to give him honor 
or thanks. 

It was only when I urged on him that his children had a right to pos- 
sess his own story that he took the subject into consideration. Afterward, 
while in Europe, he began to write out personal reminiscences, which from 
time to time he continued after his return to America. A fire destroyed 
all his manuscript. In 1881 he resumed the work. He did not labor at it 
continuously, with intent to produce a book, but wrote as the humor seized 
him. 

His Report, made in 1863, but held back by the War Department for 
some months, had been full, accurate, and exhaustive. It was published 
in 1864. No statement in it has ever been controverted. This Report did 
not include any accounts of his personal relations to the civilians who 



BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 23 

directed the course of political events and misdirected military operations 
during the first two years of the war. These accounts he wrote, accom- 
panying them with letters, despatches, documents whatever might throw 
light on history. He rewrote and extended a large part of the military 
history which his Report had given in brief, and from time to time inserted 
pages of manuscript here and there in those parts of it which he had not 
rewritten. Thus as years passed he was extending and annotating a his- 
tory, at all times complete in itself as a narrative ; and, however long he 
had lived, would probably have enriched it from year to year with more 
and more of interesting material. His sudden death interrupted the pro- 
gress of his work. When I came to examine the collected and arranged 
papers which he entrusted to me, verbally while living, and by his last 
will, I found not only the narrative which I have styled MCCLELLAN'S 
OWN STORY, but sufficient illustrative and explanatory documents, letters, 
and despatches to form several volumes. 

He had not written with reference to publication. It was expressly 
for his children that he was preparing his memoirs, and there was a great 
deal in them which was intended solely for their eyes. A century hence 
every word, perhaps, might be interesting to those who enjoy personal 
memoirs, but, as a matter of course, it has been my duty to withhold such 
portions as I think he would not have published now. I have exercised 
my discretion in reserving for future publication much of the material he 
had arranged, which would now be valuable, and doubtless acceptable, 
but would have extended this volume to a series of two or three. All the 
foot-notes in the volume are mine. 

Another class of material came into my hands. McClellan had been 
married only a few months before the outbreak of the war. Not the least 
sacrifice which he made in entering the service was the breaking up of 
the home his first home in which he had found the first happiness of a 
laborious life. Sometimes during his public service Mrs. McClellan was 
able to be with him, especially while he was in Washington. When they 
were separated he found his only rest and refreshment in writing to her. 
To no other person in the world did he open his whole soul. The per- 
fection of their love, the absolute confidence which he reposed, and 
wisely reposed, in her, made his letters not only graphic accounts of daily 
events, great and small, but an exposure of his inmost feelings. I found 
among his papers some extracts from these letters, which he had made to 
aid him in writing his memoirs ; but the letters were supposed to have 
vanished in the fire. When they were discovered, carefully sealed for the 
one only person to whom they belonged, I asked for fuller extracts. I 
confess that I hesitated very much about giving an}' part of these letters, 
written in the most sacred confidence of life, to the public eye. Others 
advised that, as he belonged to his country, and innumerable citizens and 
soldiers loved him with devout affection, they could well be allowed, h.id 
indeed a right, to read portions of these letters which reveal McClellan 
the man, as his narrative shoavs McClellan the soldier. 

By far the larger portion of the letters, and of every letter, belongs 



24 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH. 

to that confidence which not even death affects. In determining what 
parts may and what may not be published I have been influenced by the 
wish to present to his fellow-citizens who honored him, and his soldiers 
who loved him, some of that view of his character which those nearest to 
him always had ; and I have done this with the guiding trust that he will 
approve what I have done when I again meet him.

MCCLELLAN'S OWN STORY 



November 8, 1881. 

The labor of years in the preparation of ?ny memoirs having 
been destroyed by fire, it remains to recommence the tedious work 
and replace the loss as best I may. Fortunately my original papers 
are preserved. I have no present intention of publishing anything 
during my lifetime, but desire to leave, for the use of my children, 
my own account of the great events in which it was my fortune to 
take part. Therefore, should I live to complete my work, it will 
probably be found too voluminous for publication, and I anticipate 
the necessity of a judicious pruning to fit it for the public use. 

I have thus far abstained from any public reply to the various 
criticisms and misrepresentations of which I have been the subject, 
and shall probably preserve the same attitude during the remainder 
of my life. Cert'ainly, up to within a brief period, party feeling 
has run so high that the pathway for the truth has been well-nigh 
closed, and too many have preferred to accept blindly whatever 
was most agreeable to their prejudices, rather than to examine 
facts. 

Moreover, during the civil war I never sought rank nor com- 
mand. Whatever of that nature came to mf came by force of cir- 
cumstances and with no effort of my own. In the performance of 
the duties thus thrown upon me, I can with a clear conscience say 
that I never thought of myself or of my own interests, but that I 
steadily pursued the course which commended itself to me as best 
serving the true interests of my country, and of the gallant troops 
whom I had the honor to command. 

I have, therefore, been able to maintain a calm front under 
abuse, and while far from claiming immunity from error have 
remained satisfied with the conviction that, after my death at least, 
my countrymen will recognize the fact that I loyally served my 
country in its darkest hour ; and that others, who during their 
lifetimes have been more favored than myself, would probably have 
done no better, imder the circumstances which surrounded me, when, 
twice at least, I saved the capital, once created atid once reorgan- 
ized a great army. 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



CHAPTER I. 

Causes of the war Principles of the Union State-rights and secession 
Slavery Immediate and gradual emancipation Douglas and Lin- 
coln War imminent The South responsible A slander refuted 
McClellan always for the Union Enters the service Made major- 
general of volunteers in Ohio. 

WHEN the occurrences at Fort Sumter in April, 1861, aroused 
the nation to some appreciation of the gravity of the situation, 
I was engaged , in civil life as president of the Eastern Division 
of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, having resigned my com- 
mission as a captain of cavalry in January, 1857. My residence 
was then in Cincinnati, and the fact that I had been in the army 
threw me in contact with the leading men of the State. My old 
army associations had placed me in intimate relations with many 
Southern men, and I had travelled much in the South, so that I 
was, perhaps, better prepared to weigh the situation than the ma- 
jority of Northern men. So strongly was I convinced that war 
would ensue that when, in the autumn of 1860, I leased a house 
in Cincinnati for the term of three years, I insisted upon a clause 
in the lease releasing me from the obligation in the event of war. 

The general current of events during the winter, and many 
special instances of outrage or insult offered to unoffending 
Northern travellers in the Southwest (coming to my knowledge 
as a railway official), reduced this impression to a certainty in 
my mind, even before the firing upon Sumter. 

After all that has been said and written upon the subject, I 
suppose none now doubt that slavery was the real knot of the 
question and the underlying cause of the war. It is now easy 
to perceive how the war might have been avoided if for two or

30 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

three generations back all the men of both sections had been 
eminently wise, calm, unselfish, and patriotic. But with men as 
they are, it would be difficult indeed to indicate how a perma- 
nent pacific solution could have been reached. It is no doubt 
true that events were precipitated, perhaps rendered inevitable, 
by the violent course of a comparatively small number of men, 
on both sides of the line, during the thirty years preceding the 
war. 

But it is the distinct lesson of history that this is always so ; 
that the great crises in the world's history are induced by the 
words and actions of a few earnest or violent men, who stir up 
the masses and induce them blindly to follow their lead, whether 
for good or evil. As a rule the masses of civilized men, if left to 
themselves, are not prone to disturb the existing order of things 
or to resort to violent measures, unless suffering under intense 
evils which come home to each man individually and affect 
either his personal safety or personal possessions and prosperity ; 
and even in such cases spontaneous uprisings of the masses are 
rare. 

In our own case the people of the two sections did not under- 
stand each other before the war, and probably neither section 
regarded the other as seriously in earnest. The wide difference 
existing in social organization and habits had much to do with 
this. 

In the South the habit of carrying, and using on slight pro- 
vocation, deadly weapons, the sparse settlement of the country, 
the idle and reckless habits of the majority of the illiterate 
whites, the self-assertion natural to the dominant race in a slave- 
holding country, all conspired to impress them with an ill-found- 
ed assumption of superior worth and courage over the indus- 
trious, peaceful, law-abiding Northerners. On the other hand, 
the men of the North had become somewhat habituated to the 
boastful assertions too common among the Southerners, and had 
learned to believe that no real purpose of using force lay con- 
cealed beneath their violent language. Both were mistaken. 
The Southerner, with all his gasconading, was earnest in his 
intention to fight to the last for slavery and the right of seces- 
sion. The peaceful Northerner, unaccustomed to personal war- 
fare and prone to submit his disputes to the regular ordeal of 
law, was ready to lay down his life for the cause of the Union. 



STATE RIGHTS AND SECESSION, 31 

More gallant foes never met on the field of battle than these 
men of the same race, who had so long lived under the ample 
folds of the same flag ; more desperate battles were never fought 
than those now about to occur. The military virtues of patriot- 
ism, patience, endurance, self-abnegation, and heroism were about 
to receive their most striking illustrations. 

In judging the motives of men at this great crisis it must be 
remembered that the vast majority of Southern men had been 
educated in the doctrine of secession and of extreme State-rights 
which is, that allegiance was due first to the State, next to the 
general government, and that the State when it entered the 
Union retained the right to withdraw at will ; while in the 
North the doctrine was generally held that allegiance to the 
general government was paramount and the Union indissolu- 
ble. The masses on each side were honest in their belief as 
to the justice of their cause. Their honesty and sincerity were 
proved by the sacrifices they made, by the earnestness with which 
so many devout Christians on both sides confidently relied upon 
the aid of God in their hour of trial, and by the readiness with 
which so many brave men laid down their lives on the field of 
battle. 

When the generation which took part in this contest shall 
have passed away, and the question can be regarded in the cold 
light of dispassionate historical and philosophical inquiry, it will 
be clearly seen that in this case also history has repeated itself, 
and that the truth lay midway between the extreme positions as- 
sumed by the controlling spirits at the time. The right of seces- 
sion would virtually have carried us back to the old Confederacy, 
which proved so weak from lack of cohesion between its parts 
and of the necessary force in the executive. The tendency of 
Northern Republicans was towards a centralized power, under 
which the autocracy of the States would disappear. 

It is impossible for any government to recognize the right of 
secession unless its assertion is supported by such overwhelming 
force as to render opposition entirely hopeless, and thus practi- 
cally convert rebellion into successful revolution. There can be 
no stability, no protection of person and property, no good gov- 
ernment, no power to put down disorder at home or to resist 
oppression from without, under any other principle. 

On the other hand, in a country so vast as ours, with such 



32 McCLELLAN^ S OWN STORY. 

great differences of topography and of climate, with a popula- 
tion so numerous and derived from such a variety of sources, 
and, in consequence of all this, such diversities of habits, local 
laws, and material interests, it is impossible for a centralized 
government to legislate satisfactorily for all the domestic con- 
cerns of the various parts of the Union. 

The only safe policy is that the general government be strictly 
confined to the general powers and duties vested in it by the old 
Constitution, while the individual States preserve all the sovereign 
rights and powers retained by them when the constitutional com- 
pact was formed. 

As a corollary from this I am convinced that no State can be 
deprived of any of these retained rights, powers, and duties with- 
out its own consent ; and that the power of amending the Consti- 
tution was intended to apply only to amendments affecting the 
manner of carrying into effect the original provisions of the Con- 
stitution, but not to enable the general government to seize new 
power at the expense of any unwilling State. 

A strict adherence in practice to this theory presents, in my 
opinion, the only possibility of the permanent maintenance of 
our Union throughout the long years of the future. 

The old Southern doctrine of extreme State-rights, including 
that of secession, would reduce the Union to a mere rope of 
sand, and would completely paralyze the general government, 
rendering it an object of just contempt at home and abroad. 

The doctrine of centralization, if carried to its legitimate 
conclusions, in substituting the legislation of the general govern- 
ment for that of the States in regard to the local and domestic 
affairs of the people, would soon cause so much discontent and 
suffering as to result in a resort to secession as the only practical 
remedy. And in this case the Union could only be maintained 
by the superior force of a strong military central government, 
thus rendering the Union valueless for its great object of secur- 
ing the liberties of the people. 

In the course of my narrative the fact will appear a fact well 
known to all who intelligently followed the events of the time 
that, at the beginning of the great civil war, the general govern- 
ment was powerless, both in the East and West, to maintain its 
rights and vindicate its authority, and that the means to accom- 
plish these vital ends were furnished by the individual States,

acting in their capacity as sovereigns. The history of that period 
is the best possible vindication of the Northern doctrine of State- 
rights. 

And no impartial observer of the events of the war can fail to 
see that all the subsequent violations of the Constitution and of 
the rights of the loyal States, by the general government, were 
not only wholly unnecessary but positively pernicious at the time. 
The safety of the republic at no time during the war required or 
justified any departure from the provisions of the Constitution. 
That great instrument was broad enough to cover even the neces- 
sities of that most eventful period. The loyalty of the great 
masses of the Northern people was so marked and so strong that 
they could be trusted far more than most of the selfish servants 
whom a minority had placed in power. The happiest condition 
of affairs for us would no doubt be found in a return to the situa- 
tion before the war, when the action of the general government, 
being strictly confined to its legitimate purposes, was so little felt 
by individual citizens that they almost forgot its existence, and 
were almost unaware that there was any other government in the 
land than those of the States and municipalities. 

Soon after my arrival in Washington in 1861 I had several 
interviews with prominent abolitionists of whom Senator Sum- 
ner was one on the subject of slavery. I invariably took the 
ground that I was thoroughly opposed to slavery, regarding it as 
a great evil, especially to the whites of the South, but that in my 
opinion no sweeping measure of emancipation should be carried 
out, unless accompanied by arrangements providing for the new 
relations between employers and employed, carefully guarding 
the rights and interests of both ; and that were such a measure 
framed to my satisfaction I would cordially support it. Mr. 
Sumner replied others also agreed with him that such points 
did not concern us, and that all that must be left to take care of 
itself. My reply was that no real statesman could ever contem- 
plate so sweeping and serious a measure as sudden and general 
emancipation without looking to the future and providing for its 
consequences ; that four and a half millions of uneducated slaves 
should not suddenly be manumitted without due precautions 
taken both to protect them and to guard against them ; that 
just there was the point where we differed radically and probably 
irreconcilably. 



34 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



My own view was that emancipation should be accomplished 
gradually, and that the negroes should be fitted for it by certain 
preparatory steps in the way of education, recognition of the 
rights of family and marriage, prohibition against selling them 
without their own consent, the freedom of those born after a 
certain date, etc. I was always prepared to make it one of the 
essential conditions of peace that slavery should be abolished 
within a fixed and reasonable period. Had the arrangements of 
the terms of peace been in my hands I should certainly have 
insisted on this. 

During the autumn of 1861, after arriving in Washington, I 
discontinued the practice of returning fugitive slaves to their 
owners. 

In Western Virginia, after Pegram's surrender, when I had 
been directed to parole the prisoners, I collected the large num- 
ber of negro slaves captured with their masters, and gave them 
their choice as to returning with the latter, remaining in camp 
under pay as laborers, or going North. With one or two excep- 
tions they decided to return with their masters. From that time 
forward I never returned a negro slave to his master, although 
many such requisitions were made on me. I followed the prin- 
ciple that there could be no slave in my camp. 

On the Peninsula I not only received all negroes who came to 
the camps, but (especially when on the James river) frequently 
sent out parties to bring in negroes, because I required them for 
certain work around the camps and depots too severe for white 
men in that climate. They were employed upon police work, 
loading and unloading transports, etc., and sometimes upon en- 
trenchments. They were fed and received some small wages. 
As a rule much strictness was necessary to make them work ; 
they supposed that in leaving their masters they left all labor 
behind them, and that they would be clothed, fed, and allowed 
to live in idleness in the North. That was their only idea of lib- 
erty. It was very clear that they were entirely unfit for sudden 
emancipation and the reception of the electoral franchise, and 
should have been gradually prepared for it. 

While on this subject I must say that, although I was a strong 
Democrat of the Stephen A. Douglas school, I had no personal 
political ambition. I knew nothing about "practical politics," 
had never even voted except for Douglas, and during the whole 



McCLELLAN'S POLITICS. 35 

period of my command I never did or wrote anything, or ab- 
stained from doing or writing anything, in view of its political 
effect upon myself. My ambition was fully gratified by the pos- 
session of the command of the army, and, so long as I held that, 
nothing would have induced me to give it up for the Presidency. 
Whenever I wrote anything of a political nature it was only with 
the hope of doing something towards the maintenance of those 
political principles which I honestly thought should control the 
conduct of the war. In fact, I sacrificed my own interests rather 
than acquiesce in what I thought wrong or impolitic. The Pre- 
sident and his advisers made a great mistake in supposing that I 
desired political advancement. 

Many of the Democratic leaders did me great harm by us- 
ing my name for party purposes without my knowledge or con- 
sent ; and, without intending it, probably did more than my 
armed enemies in the way of ruining my military career by 
giving the administration some reason to suppose that in the 
event of military success I might prove a dangerous political 
rival. 

Regarding, as I did, the restoration of the Union and preser- 
vation of the national life to be the great object of the war, I 
would, no doubt, have acquiesced in any honorable measure ab- 
solutely necessary to bring about the desired result, even to the 
forcible and general abolition of slavery, if found to be a mili- 
tary necessity. I recognized the fact that as the Confederate 
States had chosen to resort to the arbitrament of arms, they must 
abide by the logical consequences of the stern laws of war. But, 
as I always believed that we should fight to bring them back into 
the Union, and should treat them as members of the Union 
when so brought back, I held that it was a matter of sound policy 
to do nothing likely to render ultimate reconciliation and har- 
mony impossible, unless such a course were imperative to secure 
military success. Nor do I now believe that my ideas were quix- 
otic or impracticable. 

Since the war I have met many of my late antagonists, and 
have found none who entertained any personal enmity against 
me. While acknowledging, with Lee and other of their generals, 
that they feared me more than any of the Northern generals, and 
that I had struck them harder blows when in the full prime of 
their strength, they have all said that I fought them like a gen- 



^ 6 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

\j 

tleman and in an honorable way, and that they felt nothing but 
respect for me. 

I remember very well, when riding over the field of South 
Mountain, that, passing by a severely wounded Confederate offi- 
cer, I dismounted and spoke with him, asking whether I could do 
anything to relieve him. He was a lieutenant-colonel of a South 
Carolina regiment, and asked me if I was Gen. McClellan ; and 
when I said that I was Gen. McClellan, he grasped my hand 
and told me that he was perfectly willing to be wounded and 
a prisoner for the sake of taking by the hand one whom all the 
Confederates so honored and admired. Such things happened 
to me not unfrequently, and I confess that it gave me no little 
pleasure to find that my antagonists shared the feelings of my 
own men for me. 

To revert to politics for a moment : When residing in Chicago 
I knew Mr. Stephen A. Douglas quite well. During his cam- 
paign for the senatorship against Mr. Lincoln they were on one 
occasion to hold a joint discussion at Bloomington, and, as my 
business called me in that direction, I invited Mr. Douglas to 
accompany me in my private car. We started late in the even- 
ing, and Mr. Douglas brought with him a number of his political 
henchmen, with whom he was up all night. We reached Bloom- 
ington early in the afternoon of the next day, and about half an 
hour before arriving I warned Mr. Douglas, who had continued 
his amusements up to that time, not having slept at all. I dread- 
ed a failure in the discussion about to take place, for the Little 
Giant certainly had had no opportunity of thinking of the sub- 
ject of the debate, and did not seem to be in fit condition to carry 
it on. Not that he was intoxicated, but looking unkempt and 
sleepy. He, however, retired to my private cabin, and soon 
emerged perfectly fresh and ready for the work before him ; 
so much so that I thought his speech of that day his best dur- 
ing the campaign. 

Mr. Lincoln entertained a very high respect for Mr. Douglas's 
powers, and no doubt had the latter survived he would have 
exercised a great and most favorable influence upon Mr. Lin- 
coln, as well as upon the Democratic party of the North. His 
death was a severe blow to the country. He would, in all pro- 
bability, have been able to control the more flighty leaders of the 
Northwestern Democracy, and have kept the party in the eyes of 



CAUSE OF THE WAR. 37 

the world, as its masses really were, united in a hearty support of 
the war. 

While giving due weight to all said or done by the ultra aboli- 
tionists of the North, I hold the South directly accountable for 
the war. If the election of Mr. Lincoln meant a more deter- 
mined attack upon slavery, they of the South were responsible 
for the result, in consequence of their desertion of Mr. Douglas 
and the resulting rupture of the Democratic party. Even after 
that, if they had chosen to draw near the Northern Democrats 
again, seeking their remedy and protection within the Union, the 
Constitution, and the laws, they would have retained the right 
on their side. If left to their own cool judgment it is pro- 
bable that the majority of the Southern whites would have real- 
ized that slavery could not exist much longer, and that their wis- 
est course was to recognize that fact, consent that it should not 
be extended beyond its existing limits, and provide for its gradual 
extinction. But, for various reasons, more reckless counsels pre- 
vailed. The Southern States rallied to the support of their pecu- 
liar institution, declared it to be a holy ordinance, demanded 
that it might be extended over the Territories, and bitterly op- 
posed the idea that general manumission should be provided 
for in any form. Thus a state of feeling arose, more particu- 
larly in the South, which could only be quieted by the drastic 
methods of war. 

In the early part of 1861, as has already been stated, it be- 
came almost impossible for any Northern man to travel in the 
Southwest without being subjected to gross insults or to per- 
sonal maltreatment ; this conduct soon produced a counter irri- 
tation, and, as for myself, I confess that ere long I came to the 
conclusion that there was but one way to put an end to such 
proceedings, and that the sooner we entered upon that way the 
better it would be. When Sumter was fired upon there was no 
longer room for discussion, and the question was narrowed to the 
issue of the life of the Union and the honor of the flag. For 
men who thought as I did there was but one course open. 

It was clear that, even if a peaceable separation were ar- 
ranged, we would soon come to blows on some secondary issue, 
such as boundaries, the division of public property, the slavery 
question on the borders, the free navigation of the Mississippi, 
the territorial domain, etc., etc., and in that view it was better 



38 McCLELLAN' S OWN STORY. 

to throw everything else to one side and fight upon the main 
underlying issue the preservation of the Union and the obser- 
vance of the laws of the general government. 

It is perhaps hardly worth while to notice here any of those 
unfounded slanders which some papers uttered concerning me r- 
that is, the statement that at the outbreak of the war I entertained 
offers to enter the Southern service. I need only say that there 
was not the shadow of a foundation for this. The leading men 
on the Southern side knew perfectly well that of all men I would 
be the last to waver in my allegiance to the general government 
and its flag. 

At no period, either before or after the war broke out, did any 
one suggest to me, either directly or indirectly, the idea of my 
taking part with the South. No one ever made me any offer to 
join the rebel service ; no one ever suggested the possibility of 
my dreaming of espousing that side. I never, in any manner, in- 
timated to any one that it would be possible for me to take any 
other side than that of the general government and the Union, 
nor did such a thought ever pass through my mind. I always 
stated distinctly that, should the apprehended crisis arrive, I 
should stand by the Union and the general government. I make 
this record because there have been people so foolish as to 
believe the statements made by radical newspapers to the effect 
that I had offered my services to the secessionists. Those 
papers must have known their statements to be entirely false 
and void of foundation, when they made them for the sole pur- 
pose of serving party political ends. 

The secession of South Carolina, Dec. 20, 1860, was closely 
followed by that of six other States, and on the 8th of Feb., 
1 86 1, the Southern Confederacy was formally proclaimed and its 
president elected. But, without even awaiting the organization 
of the new Confederate government, the seceding States seized 
all the unprotected United States arsenals and fortifications with- 
in their limits, together with all the arms, stores, and munitions of 
war they contained. Forts Moultrie and Sumter in Charleston 
harbor, Fort Pickens at Pensacola, and the fortresses at Key 
West and Tortugas in Florida were about the only forts within 
the seceded States which remained in the possession of the gene- 
ral government. 

How soon the work of organizing and instructing troops be- 



NOR THERN AND SO U THERN PREPARA T10NS. 3 9 

gan in the South will appear from the fact that as early as the 
9th of Jan., 1861, an expedition for the relief of Fort Sumter was 
turned back by the fire of the Southern batteries near the en- 
trance of Charleston harbor. About the same time the navy- 
yard at Pensacola was occupied by an armed force under Bragg, 
and the works at the mouth of the Mississippi garrisoned. 

In brief, at least from the beginning of Jan., 1861, and pro- 
bably in many cases yet earlier, the work of organizing, arming, 
and instructing troops began throughout the seceded States, and 
not improbably in such of the slaveholding States also as had not 
yet formally joined the movement of secession. As early as Feb. 
1 8, Gen. Twiggs surrendered the forces under his command in 
Texas. 

Meanwhile neither the general government nor the Northern 
States were doing anything to counteract this movement and 
meet the impending storm. Not only were there no additional 
troops raised, no steps taken to organize and arm the militia 
and volunteers, but, so far as the general government was con- 
cerned, the authorities seemed to dread even the semblance of 
a movement to reinforce the few forts still in their possession. 
The little regular army, scattered over the vast area of the West, 
was left without orders, and not even concentrated for self-de- 
fence, much less brought in where its services might be available 
against the active forces of the secessionists, as common pru- 
dence would have suggested, as early as the passage of the South 
Carolina ordinance of secession. 

Such was the condition of affairs when Fort Sumter surren- 
dered on the i4th of April, 1861. The general government and 
the Northern States were utterly unprepared for war ; not a 
man enlisted, not a musket procured, not a cartridge made, not 
a piece of clothing or equipment provided, beyond those main- 
tained during a state of profound and apparently permanent 
peace. The Southern States for nearly four months had been 
actively preparing for the eventuality they intended to force on, 
and had made no little headway in the collection of material, 
the organization and instruction of troops. 

Moreover, on the breaking-out of hostilities they possessed 
another and very considerable advantage over the Northerners : 
that is to say, one of the results of the peculiar institution of the 
South was that the class of slaveholders, the highly educated 



40 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

whites, had always composed an aristocracy, which furnished the 
social and political leaders to whom the poor whites were, as 
a rule, accustomed to defer, so that when the time arrived to 
raise troops the aristocratic class furnished officers always accus- 
tomed to control, and the poor whites furnished the mass of the 
private soldiers, always habituated to that deference to their 
leaders which under the new circumstances rapidly passed into 
obedience. Discipline was thus very easily established among 
them. 

Among the Northern men there was little difficulty in estab- 
lishing discipline when the officers were intelligent gentlemen ; 
but, in the early part of the war particularly, it occurred that the 
officers were sometimes inferior in intelligence and education to 
the soldiers, and in these cases the establishment of discipline 
presented far greater difficulties. 

Here let me say that, given good officers, there are no men in 
the world who admit of a more thorough and effective discipline 
than the native-born Americans of the North. Their intelligence 
soon shows them the absolute necessity of discipline in an army, 
and its advantages to all concerned ; but the kind of discipline 
best adapted to them differs materially from that required by 
other races. Their fighting qualities are second to none in the 
world. 

When the catastrophe occurred the firing upon Fort Sum- 
ter the excitement in Cincinnati and along the Ohio river was 
naturally intense. The formation of regiments began at once, 
and all who had military knowledge or experience were eagerly 
sought for, myself among others. I did what I could in the way 
of giving advice to those who sought it, and in allaying the ex- 
citement in Cincinnati. About this time I received telegrams 
from friends in New York informing me that the governor of 
that State desired to avail himself of my services ; another from 
Gen. Robert Patterson, offering me the position of chief-en- 
gineer of the command of militia then organizing under his 
orders ; and one from Gov. Curtin, of Pennsylvania, offering me 
the command of the Pennsylvania Reserves, afterwards given to 
McCall. I promptly arranged my business affairs so as to admit 
of a short absence, and started for Pennsylvania to see what 
was best to be done. At the request of several gentlemen of 
Cincinnati I stopped at Columbus to give Gov. Dennison some 



COMMAND IN OHIO. * 41 

information about the condition of affairs in Cincinnati, intend- 
ing to remain only a few hours and then proceed to Harrisburg. 
According to the then existing laws of Ohio the command of 
the militia and volunteers called out must be given to general 
officers of the existing militia establishment. The legislature be- 
ing in session, the governor caused to be presented a bill permit- 
ting him to appoint, as major-general commanding, any resident 
of the State. This was intended for my benefit, was passed by 
both houses in a few hours, and the appointment offered to me 
the same day, the 23d of April, 1861. I at once accepted and 
without an hour's delay entered upon the performance of my 
duties, abandoning my intended trip to the East. 



CHAPTER II. 

Beginning of the war in the West Apathy at Washington Value of 
State governments Incidents in organizing Western army Ken- 
tucky Campaign in Western Virginia McClellan called to Wash- 
ington. 

AT the time of my appointment in Ohio we were cut off from 
direct communication with Washington in consequence of the 
unfortunate occurrences in Baltimore, and the attention of the 
national authorities was confined exclusively to the task of re- 
lieving the capital from danger and of securing its communica- 
tions with the loyal States. We in the West were therefore left 
for a long time without orders, advice, money, or supplies of any 
kind, and it was clear that the different States must take care of 
themselves and provide their own means of defence. 

At this critical juncture the value and vitality of the State 
governments was fully tested. Fortunately they proved equal to 
the emergency and saved the country. Any one who coolly and 
dispassionately reviews the occurrences of that exciting period 
must arrive at the conclusion that, in a country so large as ours, 
the safety of the nation imperatively demands the entire pre- 
servation of the rights and autonomy of the several States as 
secured by the original Constitution ; of course with the proviso 
that the vexed question of the right of secession has been for 
ever settled in the negative by the result of the civil war. The 
Eastern States were to a certain extent provided with arms, the 
material of war, and some tolerably organized and instructed 
militia regiments. Their prompt action saved the capital. 

The Western States were almost entirely without the means 
of defence, but the governors (cordially supported by the legis- 
latures) at once took steps to obtain by purchase and by con- 
tract, at home and abroad, the requisite arms, ammunition, 
clothing, camp equipage, etc. The supplies thus provided were 
often inferior in quality and insufficient in quantity, but they 
answered the purpose until better arrangements could be made. 



THE WEST UNPREPARED. 43 

In addition to the Ohio volunteers called for by the genera*, 
government, the governor placed under my command twelve or 
thirteen regiments of State troops ; and for several weeks I 
remained at Columbus, without a staff, working night and day 
at the organization of the entire Ohio contingent. 

The condition of affairs in the West was not satisfactory or 
reassuring. We were entirely unprepared for war. It was al- 
ready clear that Missouri was likely to be the scene of a serious 
struggle, and the attitude of Kentucky was very doubtful. The 
secessionists were gathering forces in Tennessee and upon the 
Mississippi river, as well as in Western Virginia, and many well- 
informed persons felt great anxiety in respect to the loyalty of 
large numbers of the inhabitants of southern Illinois, Indiana, 
and Ohio. In brief, our situation was difficult. We were sur- 
rounded by possible, or even probable, dangers ; were without 
organization, arms, supplies, money, officers. We had no idea 
of the policy which the general government intended to pur- 
sue ; we had no " head " to direct affairs. It fell to me, per- 
haps more than to any one person, to supply these pressing 
wants, and at this distance I may say that the task was not un- 
satisfactorily performed. 

My civil career ended at this time, for from the evening 
when I received the appointment as major-general of the Ohio 
Volunteers all my thoughts and efforts were directed to my 
military duties. I never again went to the office of the Ohio 
and Mississippi Railroad, unless it may have been for a few 
minutes when my advice was needed on matters of importance. 
The owners of the road refused to accept my resignation for 
many months, until it was certain that I was inextricably in- 
volved in military affairs ; but I drew no pay from them after I 
ceased to do the duty. The salary I gave up to re-enter the 
military service was ten thousand dollars per annum. 

On the night of my appointment as major-general in Ohio 
I wrote a letter to Gen. Scott (probably directed to the adju- 
tant-general) informing him of the fact, reporting for orders, 
giving all the details I possessed in regard to my command, the 
arms, etc., at my disposal, and asking for staff officers to assist 
me. This was sent by a special messenger, there being then no 
mail communication with Washington. Within a few days I sent 
by similar means another letter to the general, suggesting that 



44 MCCLELLAND OWN STORV. 

the Western States between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi 
be placed under one head ; stating that I intended bringing all 
the Ohio troops into one camp of instruction (Camp Dennison); 
asking for arms, funds, etc. ; urging the necessity of artillery and 
cavalry ; renewing the request for staff officers ; suggesting a 
plan, or rather plans, of Western campaigns. It is possible that 
some of the ideas here mentioned as being in the second letter 
may have been in the first, or in another letter written soon 
after ; for about this time I wrote several letters to the head- 
quarters at Washington. One movement that I suggested was 
in connection with the operations of the Eastern army then 
being assembled around Washington ; a movement up the val- 
ley of the Great Kanawha, and across the mountains upon Rich- 
mond or upon Staunton, as circumstances might render advisable. 
Another was a movement upon Nashville, and thence, in combi- 
nation with the Eastern army, upon Chattanooga, Atlanta, Mont- 
gomery, Savannah, etc., etc. The importance of Eastern Ten- 
nessee, and of the railroad from Memphis through Chattanooga 
and Knoxville, was very early impressed upon my mind, and at 
a very early date brought before the Washington authorities. 
Fortunately, or unfortunately, they were too busy to think of 
the West, and these letters received little or no attention, so that 
we were allowed to go on pretty much as we pleased, with such 
means as the States could get possession of. 

On the 1 3th of May, 1861, I received the order, dated May 
3, forming the Department of the Ohio consisting of the States 
of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois and giving the command to me. 
A short time afterwards were added to the department a small 
portion of Western Pennsylvania and that part of Western Vir- 
ginia north of the Great Kanawha and west of the Greenbriar 
rivers. I was still left without a single instructed staff officer. 

Capt. (afterwards Maj.-Gen.) Gordon Granger, U. S. Mount- 
ed Rifles, was sent to Ohio to muster in volunteers. I appoint- 
ed him division inspector, and repeatedly applied for him as 
a member of my staff ; but these requests were constantly 
refused, and he was not permitted to retain the post of inspec- 
tor. During the short time he was with me he rendered remark- 
able services. Capt. Lawrence Williams, loth U. S. Infantry, 
was soon after ordered to Ohio as a mustering officer, and my 
application for him as an aide-de-camp was granted. He con- 



ORGANIZATION IN THE WST. 45 

tinued with me during the Western Virginia campaign, and until 
a short period after my arrival in Washington, when with great 
difficulty I procured for him the appointment of major in the 
6th U. S. Cavalry. This much-abused officer always served 
me faithfully, and exhibited great gallantry in action. I was 
and am fully satisfied that he always behaved with thorough 
loyalty. 

Soon after this Gen. Harney and Col. McKinstry lent me 
Capt. Dickerson, A. A. Q. M. After much difficulty I succeed- 
ed in retaining him, and he proved to be a most valuable officer. 
Capt. Burns, A. C. S., happened to pass through Cincinnati un- 
employed, so that I detained him, and at last kept him perma- 
nently. Both this officer and Capt. Dickerson were more than 
once ordered away from me to less important functions, and it 
was with the utmost difficulty that I finally retained them. At 
a subsequent period, but before the Western Virginia campaign, 
Maj. Seth Williams was assigned to duty as adjutant-general of 
the department, Maj. R. B. Marcy as paymaster (subsequently 
assigned by me as chief of staff and inspector-general), Capt. 
Kingsbury as chief of ordnance. 

During the first organization of the department my great diffi- 
culty was encountered from the unwillingness of the Washington 
authorities to give me any staff officers. I do not think they had 
an idea beyond their own safety, and consequently that of Wash- 
ington ; except the Blairs, who were naturally much interested in 
the State of Missouri, and Mr. Chase. As will be seen hereafter, 
Kentucky and West Virginia received a very small share of the 
attention of the functionaries in Washington. 

In the course of May and June I made several tours of in- 
spection through my command. Cairo was visited at an early 
day, and after a thorough inspection I gave the necessary orders 
for its defence, as well as that of Bird's Point, which I also visit- 
ed. Cairo was then under the immediate command of Brig.-Gen. 
Prentiss, and, considering all the circumstances, the troops were 
in a remarkably satisfactory condition. The artillery, especially, 
had made very good progress under the instruction of Col. Wag- 
ner, a Hungarian officer, whom I had sent there for that object. 
I inspected also at Springfield (111.), Chicago, several points on 
the Illinois Central Railroad, several times at Indianapolis, Cleve- 
land, and Columbus. Maj. Marcy also inspected the points left 



46 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

unexamined by me. In connection with Gov. Dennison I had 
several meetings with the governors of the Northwestern States 
for the purpose of urging on military preparations. 

During the period that elapsed from my assignment to the 
command in Ohio until I commenced sending troops to West 
Virginia, my time was fully occupied in expediting the organiza- 
tion and instruction of the troops, and in endeavoring to provide 
for their food, armament, and equipment. The difficulties aris- 
ing from the apathy and contracted views of the authorities at 
Washington were very great, and could never have been over- 
come but for the zeal and intelligence of the governors of the 
Western States, foremost among whom was Gov. Dennison, of 
Ohio. It seemed that the Washington people had quite for- 
gotten the existence of the West ; certain it is that for a long 
time we were left entirely to our own resources, and it fre- 
quently became necessary to assume responsibilities not at all 
in accordance with the ordinary proprieties of a well-regulated 
service. 

Gen. Scott and the other military authorities all this time 
refused to allow the organization of cavalry and artillery for my 
command, being clear that neither of these arms of service would 
be needed ! With the exception of the " Michigan Battery " 
(Capt. Loomis), which was authorized by Gen. Wool during the 
time when communication with Washington was cut off, there 
was no battery in the United States service at my disposal for 
a long time. Upon my recommendation the governors of the 
States organized State batteries on their own responsibility. 
Finally three companies of the 4th U. S. Artillery, serving 
as infantry, arrived at Cincinnati en route to the East from 
Fort Randall. I at length received permission to retain them, 
and sent Capt. (afterwards Maj.-Gen.) George Getty, the com- 
mander of one of them, to Washington, with a letter for the 
general commanding, in which I repeated my wants in regard 
to artillery, and urged that the three companies should at once 
be mounted. The result was a tardy and reluctant consent that 
one of them, Capt. (afterwards Gen.) A. P. Howe's, should be 
mounted. But Gen. Scott expressed to Capt. Getty no little in- 
dignation that I should presume to make such a request, and, 
among other things, said : " I know more about artillery than 
Gen. McClellan does, and it is not for him to teach me." So 



GRANT S GOOD LUCK. 47 

tedious were the movements of the Ordnance Bureau that Capt. 
Howe's battery was not mounted until after I left for West Vir- 
ginia, and joined me there in a perfectly raw condition. Cav- 
alry was absolutely refused, but the governors of the States com- 
plied with my request and organized a few companies, which 
were finally mustered into the United States service and proved 
very useful. 

Soon after Gen. Patterson commenced his operations in the 
vicinity of Williamsport (when on the cars returning from Indi- 
anapolis, where I went to inspect some regiments of Indiana 
troops) I received from him a telegraphic despatch stating that 
he had largely superior forces in front of him, that he was in a 
critical condition and wanted assistance. I at once telegraphed 
and wrote to Gen. Scott what Gen. Patterson stated, and sug- 
gesting that I should move out, with all my disposable force, by 
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Piedmont and beyond, and 
thus, in connection with Gen. Patterson, clear out the Shenan- 
doah Valley. The reply to this was in substance, and as nearly 
as I remember in these very words : that " the region beyond 
Piedmont is not within Gen. McClellan's command. When his 
opinion is desired about matters there it will be asked for." 
After this encouraging reply I very carefully abstained from 
unnecessary communication with Washington. It may be re- 
marked that my suggestion was not uncalled for, but directly 
induced by Gen. Patterson's official despatch to me ; and, fur- 
ther, that if my suggestion had been adopted the result would 
have been that no " Bull Run No. i " would have been fought. 

I think it was during my absence on this very trip (to Indian- 
apolis) that Grant came to Cincinnati to ask me, as an old ac- 
quaintance, to give him employment, or a place on my staff. 
Marcy or Seth Williams saw him and told him that if he would 
await my return, doubtless I would do something for him ; but 
before I got back he was telegraphed that he could have a regi- 
ment in Illinois, and at once returned thither, so that I did not 
see him. This was his good luck ; for had I been there I would 
no doubt have given him a place on my staff, and he would 
probably have remained with me and shared my fate. 

Shortly before West Virginia was placed under my command 
(May 24) I received two identical despatches from Gen. Scott and 
the Secretary of War (Mr. Cameron) stating that it was under- 



48 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

stood that the rebels were collecting troops in that region, and 
asking me whether I could do anything to protect the Union men 
against them. I immediately replied that, if they desired it, I 
would clear West Virginia of the rebels. I received no reply 
whatever to this despatch, nor did I afterwards receive any other 
despatch or order from Washington that could be construed into 
an order or permission to operate in West Virginia. The move- 
ments that were subsequently made were initiated and conducted 
entirely on my own responsibility and of my own volition. 

A few weeks before I took the field in West Virginia, and 
while my headquarters were in Cincinnati, I received one morn- 
ing a telegram from Samuel Gill, an old graduate of West Point, 
and at that time superintendent of the Louisville and Lexington 
Railroad, stating that S. B. Buckner (afterwards the rebel gene- 
ral) wished to see me, and asking when I would be at home. 
I replied that I would see him that night. Accordingly the two 
(Buckner and Gill) reached my house about ten o'clock that 
evening. I received them alone, and we spent the night in con- 
versation about the condition of affairs in Kentucky. Buckner 
was at that time the commandant of the " State Guards," a militia 
organization in Kentucky, but neither numerous nor efficient. 
It was, however, the only organization existing there, and Buck- 
ner was in close relations with Gov. McGoffin was, in fact, his 
military adviser. Buckner brought me no letter or other cre- 
dentials from the governor, nor did he assume to be author- 
ized to make any arrangement in his name. The object of 
interview was simply that we, as old friends, should com- 
views and see if we could do any good ; thus I under- 
stood it. Buckner's main purpose seemed to be to ascertain 
what I should do in the event that Kentucky should be invad- 
ed by the secession forces then collecting under Gen. Pillow at 
various points in Tennessee near the Kentucky line. Buckner 
was very anxious that the Ohio and other Federal forces should 
respect the neutrality of Kentucky, and stated that he would do 
his best to preserve it, and drive Pillow out should he cross the 
boundary-line. I could assent to this only to the extent that 
I should be satisfied if the Kentuckians would immediately 
drive out any rebel force that might invade Kentucky, and con- 
tinued, almost in these very words : " You had better be very 
quick about it, Simon, for if I learn that the rebels are in Ken- 



TENNESSEE. 49 

tucky I will, with or without orders, drive them out without 
delay." 

I expressly told Buckner that I had no power to guarantee 
the neutrality of Kentucky, and that, although my command did 
not extend over it, I would not tolerate the presence of rebel 
troops in that State. Not many days afterwards I accidentally 
met Buckner again at Cairo, and had a conversation with him in 
the presence of John M. Douglass, of Chicago. Buckner had 
then just returned from a visit to Pillow, and he clearly showed 
by his conversation that he understood my determination at the 
first interview just as I have related it above. Among other 
things he said that he found Pillow (with whom he had had seri- 
ous personal quarrels before) sitting on a log ; and, referring to 
his (Pillow's) purpose of entering Kentucky, said to him that " if 
he did McClellan would be after him " ; to which, he said, Pil- 
low replied, " He is the very person I want to meet." It may 
be remarked that Gen. Pillow had reason to be inimical to me. 
Buckner's letter to Gov. McGoffin, subsequently published, stat- 
ing that in our first interview I had agreed to respect the neu- 
trality of Kentucky, gave an incorrect account of the case, which 
was as I have stated it. 

Before the necessity arose for action in West Virginia my 
views were turned towards Tennessee ; for from the beginning I 
saw the great importance of aiding the loyal men in the moun- 
tainous portion of that State, of holding the railways there, and 
of occupying in force the great projecting bastion formed by 
that district. I was satisfied that a firm hold there in force, and 
with secure communications to the Ohio river, would soon render 
the occupation of Richmond and Eastern Virginia impossible to 
the secessionists. Unhappily the state of affairs brought about 
by the first Bull Run rendered it impossible to act upon this 
theory when the direction of military movements came into my 
hands, nor did any of my subordinates in the West seize the im- 
portance of the idea, frequently as I presented it to them. Had 
not the general direction of the war been taken from my hands 
at the time I was about inaugurating the Peninsular campaign, I 
should then have carried out the movement upon East Ten- 
nessee and Atlanta. 

The plan of operations which Gen. Scott soon imparted to 
me confidentially was to occupy the summer and early fall in the 



50 McCLELLAK'S uWN STORY. 

equipment, discipline, and instruction of the three-years troops, 
who were to be collected in numerous small camps of instruction, 
and to form in the fall " an iron band of sixty thousand troops " 
to be placed under my command, who were to move down the 
valley of the Mississippi by roads parallel with that stream, their 
supplies following in boats on the river. I think that subsequent 
events proved that the occupation of the central mountain region 
at an early period of the war would have produced more rapid 
and decisive results than any movement down the Mississippi. 

While engaged in pushing forward the preparations of the 
troops, and doing all in my power to preserve the peace in Ken- 
tucky, events occurred which made it necessary for me to direct 
my attention more particularly to West Virginia. 

It may be repeated here that my movements in West Virginia 
were, from first to last, undertaken upon my own authority and 
of my own volition, and without any advice, orders, or instruc- 
tions from Washington or elsewhere. 

The proclamations I addressed to the inhabitants of West 
Virginia and to my troops were also entirely of my own volition. 
I had received no intimation of the policy intended to be pursued 
by the general government, and had no time to seek for instruc- 
tions. When, on the afternoon of May 26, I received at Camp 
Dennison confirmation of the movement of the secessionists to 
destroy the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and at once ordered 
by telegraph Kelly's and other regiments to remove from Wheel- 
ing and Parkersburg along the two branches of that railway, I 
wrote the proclamation and address of May 26 to the inhabi- 
tants of West Virginia and my troops, in my dining-room at Cin- 
cinnati, in the utmost haste, with the ladies of my family con- 
versing in the room, and without consulting any one. They were 
at once despatched by telegraph to Wheeling and Parkersburg, 
there to be printed. 

PROCLAMATION. 

HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, 

May 26, 1 86 1. 
To the Union Men of Western Virginia : 

VIRGINIANS : The general government has long enough en- 
dured the machinations of a few factious rebels in your midst. 
Armed traitors have in vain endeavored to deter you from ex- 



WESTERN VIRGINIA PROCLAMATION. 51 

pressing your loyalty at the polls. Having failed in this infamous 
attempt to deprive you of the exercise of your dearest rights, they 
now seek to inaugurate a reign of terror, and thus force you to 
yield to their schemes and submit to the yoke of the traitorous 
conspiracy dignified by the name of the Southern Confederacy. 
They are destroying the property of citizens of your State and 
ruining your magnificent railways. The general government has 
heretofore carefully abstained from sending troops across the 
Ohio, or even from posting them along its banks, although fre- 
quently urged to do so by many of your prominent citizens. It 
determined to await the result of the late election, desirous that 
no one might be able to say that the slightest effort had been 
made from this side to influence the free expression of your 
opinions, although the many agencies brought to bear upon 
you by the rebels were well known. You have now shown, 
under the most adverse circumstances, that the great mass of 
the people of Western Virginia are true and loyal to that bene- 
ficent government under which we and our fathers have lived so 
long. As soon as the result of the election was known the trai- 
tors commenced their work of destruction. The general govern- 
ment cannot close its ears to the demand you have made for as- 
sistance. I have ordered troops to cross the Ohio river. They 
come as your friends and brothers ; as enemies, only to the armed 
rebels who are preying upon you. Your homes, your families, 
and your property are safe under our protection. All your rights 
shall be religiously respected, notwithstanding all that has been 
said by the traitors to induce you to believe that our advent 
among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves. 
Understand one thing clearly : not only will we abstain from all 
such interference, but we will, on the contrary, with an iron hand 
crush any attempt at insurrection on their part. Now that we 
are in your midst, I call upon you to fly to arms and support the 
general government. Sever the connection that binds you to 
traitors ; proclaim to the world that the faith and loyalty so long 
boasted by the Old Dominion are still preserved in Western Vir- 
ginia, and that you remain true to the stars and stripes. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 
Maj.-Gen. U. S. A., commanding Dept. 



ADDRESS. 

HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO, 

CINCINNATI, May 26, 1861. 

SOLDIERS : You are ordered to cross the frontier and enter 
upon fhe soil of Virginia. 

Your mission is to restore peace and confidence, to protect 
the majesty of the law, and to rescue our brethren from the grasp

of armed traitors. You are to act in concert with Virginia 
troops and to support their advance. I place under the safe- 
guard of your honor the persons and property of the Virgin- 
ians. I know that you will respect their feelings and all their 
rights. 

Preserve the strictest discipline ; remember that each one of 
you holds in his keeping the honor of Ohio and the Union. If 
you are called upon to overcome armed opposition I know that 
your courage is equal to the task ; but remember that your only 
foes are the armed traitors, and show mercy even to them when 
they are in your power, for many of them are misguided. When, 
under your protection, the loyal men of Western Virginia have 
been enabled to organize and arm, they can protect themselves, 
and you can then return to your homes with the proud satisfac- 
tion of having saved a gallant people from destruction. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 
Maj.-Gen. U. S. A., Commanding. 



I, of course, sent copies to the President, with a letter explain- 
ing the necessity of my prompt action without waiting to consult 
with him. To this letter I never received any reply or acknow- 
ledgment ; nor did the President, or any of his civil or mili- 
tary advisers, ever inform me whether they approved or disap- 
proved the course I had taken. I must give to the Washington 
functionaries at least this much credit viz., that although they 
gave me no assistance or orders towards initiating the campaign, 
they never interfered with me after its commencement. And 
when they saw me in a fair way toward success they were much 
more ready to listen to my requisitions for supplies. But I must 
claim the credit, if credit there be, of having begun and carried 
on and finished this short campaign on my own resources and 
against every possible disadvantage. 

During my whole career in West Virginia, as well as before I 
went there, I was kept in complete ignorance of the intentions of 
the Washington people in regard to movements in the East. 

As I write this (Nov., 1883) I propose omitting for the pre- 
sent the story of the West Virginia campaign, but intend sup- 
plying it when my history of the Army of the Potomac is com- 
pleted. 

By the middle of July I had obtained complete possession of 
the country west of the mountains and north of the Kanawha, 
holding also the lower portion of the last-named valley, where 



WEST VIRGINIA CAMPAIGN'. 53 

Gen. J. D. Cox had been checked in his advance. I held the 
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as far as Cumberland, and covered 
all the roads leading into West Virginia from the Potomac as far 
south as those uniting about eighteen miles south of Beverly, and 
held the country north of the Kanawha by garrisons and moving 
columns. 

The time of the three-months regiments was now rapidly ex- 
piring, and my movements were stopped for a time by the neces- 
sity of reorganizing them and getting up the three-years regi- 
ments. 

My advance into West Virginia had been without orders and 
entirely of my own volition, to meet the necessities of the case, 
and all I knew about the movements in front of Washington was 
derived from the newspapers and private sources ; I received no 
official information of McDowell's intended movements, and had 
no communication from headquarters on the subject until Gen. 
McDowell was actually in contact with the enemy. Consequent- 
ly the projects I formed for operations, as soon as my command 
should be reorganized, were utterly independent of the state of 
affairs at Washington and based entirely upon my views of the 
condition of affairs in the West. 

I pushed the reorganization with the utmost energy, and pre- 
pared a light column of five Ohio regiments and the incomplete 
ist Virginia, with which I intended to march on the 22d or 23d 
of July, via Suttonsville, Somersville, and the Dogwood Ridge, to 
strike the Kanawha near Fayetteville Court-House, and there cut 
off the troops under Gens. Floyd and Wise, who were then in 
front of Cox, at and below Charleston. 

Having entirely cleared the Kanawha valley of Confederates, 
I intended to secure my left flank by the line of the Upper Kana- 
wha and New river, and to move upon Wytheville, in order to cut 
the line of railroad from Memphis to Lynchburg and to hold the 
country from New river to Abingdon. The objects I had in 
view were to cut the great east and west line of railroad, so 
as to deprive the Confederates of its use, and thence to employ 
the very circuitous route by Atlanta ; and to rally the Union men 
of the mountain region, to arm and embody them, and at least 
hold my own in that mountain region until prepared to advance 
in whatever direction might prove best for the general good. In 
a letter to Gen. Scott from Buckhannon, dated July 6, I stated 



54 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



my desire to move on Wytheville after clearing the country north 
of the Kanawha. 

Had my designs been carried out Gen. Lee's attempt to re- 
cover West Virginia would have been made (if at all attempted) 
under very different auspices, and with much more decisive re- 
sults in our favor. I am confident that I should have been in 
possession of Wytheville and the mountain region south of it in 
a very few weeks. 

In this brief campaign the telegraph was for the first time, 
I think, constructed as the army advanced, and proved of very 
great use to us ; it caused a very great saving of time and horse- 
flesh. 

On the evening of July 21, 1861, I first received intelligence 
of the advance of Gen. McDowell and the battle of Bull Run. I 
had received no intimation whatever in regard to the projected 
operations in the East, although I might have aided them very 
materially had I been asked to do so. The first telegram I 
received from Gen. Scott, early in the evening of the 2ist, was to 
the effect that McDowell was gaining a grand victory, had taken 
four redoubts on the enemy's left, and would soon defeat them 
utterly. Then came a despatch not quite so favorable ; finally a 
telegram stating that McDowell was utterly defeated, his army 
routed and, as a mere mob, streaming towards Washington. The 
despatch closed with a question as to whether I could do any- 
thing across the mountains to relieve McDowell and Washing- 
ton. 

I did not then know that Gen. Joe Johnston had left Win- 
chester and joined Beauregard, supposing that Gen. Patterson 
had retained him in the Shenandoah Valley. Therefore, after 
a half-hour's consideration, I proposed that I should move via 
Romney, unite with Patterson, and operate against Johnston in 
the Shenandoah Valley. I offered, however, to move on Staun- 
ton, if they preferred that movement in Washington, provided the 
three-months men (of whom my army was mainly composed) 
would consent to remain a few weeks longer. No reply ever 
came to these propositions ; and it may here be stated that none 
of the three-months men would consent to remain beyond the 
termination of their enlistments, to move either towards the Gau- 
ley or eastward. For the Gauley movement I had, however, 
enough three-years men disposable. 



TREATMENT OF PRISONERS. 55 

On the next day, the 226. of July, I received a despatch from 
the adjutant-general stating that the condition of public affairs 
rendered my immediate presence in Washington necessary, and 
directing me to turn over my command to the next in rank, who 
happened to be Gen. Rosecrans. 

I started next morning at daylight, rode on horseback sixty 
miles to the nearest railway station, and took the cars to Wheel- 
ing, where I found my wife awaiting me, and then proceeded to 
Washington, which I reached on the 26th of July, 1861. 

Immediately after the affair of Rich Mountain I was in- 
structed by Gen. Scott to release upon parole all the prisoners I 
had taken, with the exception of such as had left the United 
States service with the evident intention of joining that of the 
secessionists. 

Col. John Pegram and a surgeon (Dr. Campbell) were the 
only ones who came under the latter category ; and the order 
was promptly carried out in regard to the others. From the 
moment the prisoners came into my hands they were treated with 
the utmost kindness. The private baggage of the officers was 
restored to them whenever it could be found. The men, most 
of whom were starving when they surrendered, were at once fed ; 
the same care was extended to their wounded as to our own. All 
of them were unanimous in their gratitude for the treatment they 
received. The slaves taken in attendance upon officers were 
allowed their choice whether to go North, remain with us, or 
return to their masters. Nearly all chose the latter alternative. 
Among the prisoners was an entire company composed of stu- 
dents of the William and Mary University, commanded by the 
president. Many of these were mere boys, among whom some 
were severely wounded. These last I sent home to their parents, 
without awaiting orders from Washington. It was a singular fact 
that the wounded preferred the attendance of our surgeons to 
that of their own, saying that the former were more kind and 
attentive to them. I mention thus particularly my treatment 
of these prisoners for the reason that they were the first in con- 
siderable numbers taken during the war, and that the course 
I pursued ought to have been reciprocated by the secessionists. 
Their treatment of our officers and men captured so soon after- 
wards at Bull Run is, therefore, without excuse. Whatever hard- 
ships prisoners afterwards suffered on either side, the blame 



56 McCLELLAN'S OWN STOKY. 

of the initiation of ill-treatment must fall on the rebels and 
not on us. 

The successor of Gen. Garnett, Gen. Jackson (formerly U. S. 
Minister at Vienna), sent a flag of truce to thank me for the kind- 
ness I had extended to their wounded and unwounded officers 
and men. On subsequent occasions I received proofs of their 
appreciation of my course. Application was also made to me, 
under a flag, for the body of Gen. Garnett, which I agreed to 
deliver up ; but before my orders in the case could reach Graf- 
ton the corpse had been taken East by the father of his late 
wife. 

The successes just achieved in West Virginia by the troops 
under my command created great excitement through the loyal 
States. They were the only ones of importance achieved up to 
that time by the Union arms, and, since public attention had not 
been especially directed to that quarter, the people were all the 
more dazzled by the rapidity and brilliancy of the results. Al- 
though the telegram ordering me to the East contained no men- 
tion of the purpose in view, it was easy, under the circumstances, 
to divine it. I fully realized the importance and difficulty of the 
task to be imposed upon me, and naturally felt gratified by the 
proof of confidence the order afforded. Yet I felt great regret 
at leaving the West, for I should have been very glad to carry out 
the Kanawha and Wytheville movement, and thereby quiet affairs 
in that region before giving up the command. 

It would probably have been better for me personally had 
my promotion been delayed a year or more. Yet I do not know 
who could have organized the Army of the Potomac as I did ; 
and I have the consolation of knowing that, during the war, I 
never sought any commission or duty, but simply did my best in 
whatever position my superiors chose to place me. 



CHAPTER III. 

PRIVATE LETTERS OF GEN. MCCLELLAN TO HIS WIFE. 
[June 21 to July 21, 1861.] 

Marietta, June 21, 1861. I must snatch a few moments to 
write you. We got off at 11.30 yesterday morning, and had a 
continual ovation all along the road. At every station where we 
stopped crowds had assembled to see the " young general " : 
gray-headed old men and women, mothers holding up their 
children to take my hand, girls, boys, all sorts, cheering and 
crying, ,God bless you ! I never went through such a scene in my 
life, and never expect to go through such another one. You 
would have been surprised at the excitement. At Chillicothe 
the ladies had prepared a dinner, and I had to be trotted 
through. They gave me about twenty beautiful bouquets and 
almost killed me with kindness. The trouble will be to fill their 
expectations, they seem to be so high. I could hear them say, 
" He is our own general " ; " Look at him, how young he is " ; 
"He will thrash them"; "He'll do," etc., etc. ad infini- 
t u n i. . . . 

We reached here about three in the morning, and at once 
went on board the boat, where I got about three hours' sleep 
until we reached Parkersburg. I have been hard at work all 
day, for I found everything in great confusion. Came up here 
in a boat about an hour ago, and shall go back to Parkersburg 
in two or three hours. . . . We start from Parkersburg at six 
in the morning. With me go McCook's regiment (Qth Ohio), 
Mack's company (4th U. S. Artillery), the Sturgess Rifle Co., a 
battery of six guns (Loomis's), and one company of cavalry 
(Barker's Illinois). Two Indiana regiments leave in the morn- 
ing just after us. I shall have five additional regiments at Graf- 
ton to-morrow afternoon. I shall have some eighteen regiments, 
two batteries, two companies of cavalry at my disposal enough 
to thrash anything I find. I think the danger has been greatly 
exaggerated, and anticipate little or no chance of winning laurels. 



58 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

... A terrible storm is passing over us now ; thunder and light- 
ning terrible in the extreme. . . . 

Grafton, Sunday, June 23, 1861 . ... We did not reach 
here until about two in the morning, and I was tired out. . . . 
Everything here needs the hand of the master and is getting it 
fast. I shall hardly be able to move from here for a couple 
of days. . . . The weather is delightful here : we are well up in 
the hills and have the mountain air. . . . 

Graf ton, June 26, 1861. ... I am detained here by want 
of supplies now on the way, and which I hope to receive soon. 
... It is very difficult to learn anything definite about our 
friends in front of us. Sometimes I am half-inclined to doubt 
whether there are many of them ; then again it looks as if there 
were a good many. We shall soon see, however. I am pretty 
well tired out and shall be very glad to get on the march. 

What a row the papers have raised about the Buckner letter ! 
B. has represented a personal interview as an official treaty. . . . 

Captain Howe is at Clarksburg Guentler with him. Mack 
is here with us. ... I don't know exactly when I shall be able 
to leave here ; certainly not before to-morrow, and perhaps not 
until next day. . . . 

Graf ton, June 27. ... I shall be after the gentlemen pretty 
shortly. You must be under no apprehensions as to me or the 
result. I never worked so hard in my life before ; even take my 
meals in my own room. . . . 

Grafton, June 29. ... I am bothered half to death by 
delays in getting up supplies. Unless where I am in person, 
everything seems to go wrong. ... I expect in the course of an 
hour or two to get to Clarksburg will probably march twelve 
miles thence to-day with Howe's battery, Mack's and the Chi- 
cago companies, and one company of cavalry. I shall have a tele- 
graph line built to follow us up. Look on the maps and find 
Buckhannon and Beverly ; that is the direction of my march. I 
hope to thrash the infamous scamps before a week is over. All I 
fear is that I won't catch them. . . . What a strange performance 
that of Buckner's was ! Fortunately I have secured the testi- 
mony of Gill and Douglass (present at the Cairo interview) that 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 59 

Buckner has entirely misrepresented me. It has annoyed me 
much, but I hope to do such work here as will set criticism at 
defiance. . . . 

Clarksburg, June 30. . . . Again great delays here; will 
certainly get off by four A.M. to-morrow, and make a long march, 
probably twenty-eight miles. After the next march I shall have 
a large tent, borrowed from the Chicago Rifles ; your father and 
I will take that, make it reception-room, sleeping-apartment, 
mess-room, etc. . . . One thing takes up a great deal of time, 
yet I cannot avoid it : crowds of the country-people who have 
heard of me and read my proclamations come in from all di- 
rections to thank me, shake me by the hand, and look at their 
" liberator," " the general " ! Of course I have to see them 
and talk to them. Well, it is a proud and glorious thing to see 
a whole people here, simple and unsophisticated, looking up to 
me as their deliverer from tyranny. 

Camp 14 miles south of Clarksburg , July 2. . . . We start 
in a few moments to Buckhannon. I have with me two regi- 
ments, a battery, two cavalry companies, three detached compa- 
nies. Had several heavy rains yesterday. Rosecrans is at Buck- 
hannon. I doubt whether the rebels will fight ; it is possible they 
may, but I begin to think that my successes will be due to man- 
oeuvres, and that I shall have no brilliant victories to record. I 
would be glad to clear them out of West Virginia and liberate the 
country without bloodshed, if possible. The people are rejoiced 
to see us. 

Buckhannon, July 3. . . . We had a pleasant march of six- 
teen miles yesterday through a beautiful mountain region ! mag- 
nificent timber, lovely valleys running up from the main valley ; 
the people all out, waving their handkerchiefs and giving me 
plenty of bouquets and kind words. . . . 

We nearly froze to death last night. I retired, as I thought, 
at about midnight, intending to have a good night's sleep. 
About half an hour after I shut up my tent a colonel in 
command of a detachment some fifteen miles distant came 
to report, so I received him in bed, and fell asleep about six 
times during the three hours I was talking with him. Finally,

however, he left, and I alternately slept and froze until seven 
o'clock. This morning I sent Bates on an expedition and raked 
up a couple of horse-blankets, by the aid of which I hope here- 
after to be reasonably comfortable. 

I hope to get the trains up to-morrow and make a final start 
during the day. We have a good many to deal with. I ordered 
the Guthrie Grays to Philippi this P.M. to resist a stampede at- 
tack that Gen. Morris feared. 

Buckhannon, July 5, 1861. . . . Yesterday was a very busy 
day with me, reviewing troops all the morning and giving orders 
all day and pretty much all night. ... I realize now the dread- 
ful responsibility on me the lives of my men, the reputation of 
the country, and the success of our cause. The enemy are in 
front, and I shall probably move forward to-morrow, but not 
come in contact with them until about the next day. I shall 
feel my way and be very cautious, for I recognize the fact that 
everything requires success in first operations. You need not be 
at all alarmed as to the result; God is on our side. This is a 
beautiful country in which we now are a lovely valley surround- 
ed by mountains, well cultivated. The people hail our parties 
as deliverers wherever they go, and we meet with perfect ova- 
tions. Yesterday was very hot, and my head almost roasted as I 
stood bareheaded while the troops passed by in review. We 
have a nice little camp of our own here : Mack's and Steele's 
companies, Howe's battery next, two companies of cavalry, and 
two well-behaved Virginia companies. When we next go into 
camp we shall have the German regiment (9th Ohio), with us in 
camp. I intend having a picked brigade with me all the time. 

's regiment is on the march up from Clarksburg ; they sig- 
nalized their entrance into the country by breaking into and rob- 
bing a grocery-store at Webster ! The Guthrie Grays are at Phi- 
lippi ; they leave there to-day, and will be here to-morrow night, 
following us up in reserve, or perhaps overtaking us before we 
meet the enemy. . . . 

Buckhannon, July 7, 1861. I have been obliged to inflict 
some severe punishments, and I presume the papers of the 
Western Reserve will be hard down on me for disgracing some 
of their friends guilty of the small crime of "burglary. I believe

the army is beginning lo comprehend ihat they have a master 
over them who is stern in punishing and means what he says. I 
fear I shall have to have some of them shot or hung ; that may 
convince some of the particular individuals concerned that they 
are not in the right track exactly. ... I have not told you about 
our camp at this place. It is in a large grass-field on a hill a lit- 
tle out of town, a beautiful grove near by. Your father and I 
share the same tent, a very large round one, pitched under a 
tree. Seth has one near by an office ; Lawrence Williams an- 
other as office and mess-tent. Marcy, the two Williamses, Judge 
Key, and Lander mess with me. Poe and the rest of the young- 
sters are in tents near by. ... I had a very complimentary 
despatch from Gen. Scott last night. He said he was " charmed 
with my energy, movements, and success." Pretty well for the 
old man. I hope to deserve more of him in the future. 

Move at six to-morrow morning to overtake advanced guard, 
which consists of three regiments, a battery, and one company 
of cavalry. I take up headquarters escort and four regiments 
infantry ; three more follow next day. The large supply-train up 
and ready to move. Brig.-Gen. Garnett in command of enemy. 

July 10, Roaring Creek. We have occupied the important 
position on this line without loss. The enemy are in sight, and I 
am about sending out a strong armed reconnoissance to feel him 
and see what he is. I have been looking at their camps with my 
glass ; they are strongly entrenched, but I think I can come the 
Cerro Gordo over them. 

Telegram Rich Mountain, July 12, 1861. Have met with 
complete success ; captured the enemy's entire camp, guns, tents, 
wagons, etc. Many prisoners, among whom several officers. 
Enemy's loss severe, ours very small. No officers lost on our 
side. I turned the position. All well. 

July 12, Beverly. Have gained a decided victory at small 
cost, and move on to Huttonsville to-morrow in hope of seizing 
the mountain-pass near that point before it is occupied in force 
by the enemy. If that can be done I can soon clear up the rest 
of the business to be done out here, and return to see you for 
a time at least. 



62 McCLELLAN*S OWN STORY. 

I had an affecting interview to-day with a poor woman whom 
we liberated from prison, where she had been confined for three 
weeks by these scoundrels merely because she was a Union 
woman. I enclose a flower from a bouquet the poor thing 
gave me. 

Telegram July 13, 1861. Success complete. Enemy routed. 
Lost everything he had guns, tents, wagons, etc. Pegram was 
in command. We lost but 10 killed and 35 wounded. Garnett 
has abandoned his camp between this and Philippi, and is in full 
retreat into Eastern Virginia. I hope still to cut him off. All 
well. 

July 13, Huttonsville. Since you last heard from me I re- 
ceived from Pegram a proposition to surrender, which I granted. 
L. Williams went out with an escort of cavalry and received him. 
He surrendered, with another colonel, some 25 officers, and 560 
men. ... I do not think the enemy in front of us in the Cheat 
Mountain pass, but that they have fallen back in hot haste. If 
they have, I will drive them out to-morrow and occupy the pass. 
... It now appears we killed nearly 200 ; took almost 900. . . . 

The valley in which we are is one of the most beautiful I ever 
saw, and I am more than ever inclined to make my headquarters 
at Beverly and have you with me. Beverly is a quiet, old-fash- 
ioned town, in a lovely valley ; a beautiful stream running by it 
a perfectly pastoral scene, such as the old painters dreamed of 
but never realized. ... I find that the prisoners are beyond 
measure astonished at my humanity towards them. The bearer 
of the flag from Pegram reached me about five this morning. 
He had been two days without food. I at once gave him some 
breakfast, and shortly after gave him a drink of whiskey ; as he 
drank it he said : " I thank you, general ; I drink that I may 
never again be in rebellion against the general government." 

July 14, 1 86 1. I have released the doctor this morning of 
whom I told you. Also sent a lieutenant to carry back the body 
of his captain. Also those poor young boys of good family who 
had lost their limbs. I have tried to temper justice with mercy. 
I think these men will do me no harm, but that some mothers 
and sisters and wives will bless the name of your husband. . . . 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 63 

Started this morning with a strong advanced guard, supported 
by two regiments, to test the question as to whether the rebels 
were really fortified in the Cheat Mountain pass. I went pre- 
pared for another fight, but found that they had scampered. 
We picked up some of their plunder, but they have undoubtedly 
gone at least to Staunton. The pass was strong, and they might 
have given us an immense deal of trouble. I went with a few 
men to Cheat river, the other side of the mountain. .... I have 
made a very clear sweep of it. Never was more complete suc- 
cess gained with smaller sacrifice of life. Our prisoners will 
exceed one thousand. 

On my return I found a telegram from Gen. Scott, sent 
before he had received information as to the full results of 
my victory. It was : 

" The general-in-chief, and what is more the cabinet, includ- 
ing the President, are charmed with your activity, valor, and 
consequent success. We do not doubt that you will in due 
time sweep the rebels from West Virginia, but do not mean to 
precipitate you, as you are fast enough. 

"WlNFIELD SCOTT." 

. . . Our ride to-day was magnificent ; some of the most 
splendid mountain views I ever beheld. The mountain we 
crossed is fully three thousand feet above its base, and the 
lovely little valleys, the cleared farms, the long ranges of moun- 
tains in the distance, all made a varied scene that I cannot 
describe to you. At the mountain-top was a pretty little farm, 
neat as neat could be. A very old couple lived there, the old 
lady as rosy and cheerful as a cricket. It is sad that war should 
visit even such sequestered spots as that. 

Monday evening. After closing my letter last night a cou- 
rier arrived with the news that the troops I had sent in pursuit of 
Garnett had caught him, routed his army, captured his baggage, 
one gun, taken several prisoners, and that Garnett himself lay 
dead on the field of battle ! Such is the fate of traitors : one 
of their leaders a prisoner, the other killed ; their armies anni- 
hilated, their cause crushed in this region. . . . You ask what 
my plans are. Why, don't you know that my movements de- 
pend much on those of Monsieur 1'Ennemi ? I expect to hear 



64 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

in a few hours of the final extermination of the remnants of 
Garnett's army. Then I am almost hourly awaiting news of 
Cox's success in the Kanawha. Should Cox not be prompt 
enough I will go down there myself and bring the matter to 
a close. 

West Virginia being cleared of the enemy, I have then to 
reorganize and consolidate the army. The time of the three- 
months men is about expiring, and they form so large portion 
of my force that some delay will ensue. . . . 

Telegram July 15, Huttonsville. Garnett and whole concern, 
have retreated. None nearer than Staunton. Crossed Cheat 
Mountain to-day and returned. 

July 1 8, Beverly. I am awaiting news from the Kanawha 
which will determine my movements. I do not see now but 
that I can leave here in a couple of days ; but do not count 
upon it, as there are so many chances in war. 

July 19, 1 86 1. I enclose Bulletin No. 5, printed with our 
portable press. You see we have carried civilization with us in 
the shape of the printing-press and the telegraph institutions 
decidedly neglected in this part of the world heretofore, and, I 
fear, not likely to be paying institutions in this vicinity after we 
go. The good people here read but little and have but few 
ideas. Gen. Scott is decidedly flattering to me. I received from 
him yesterday a despatch beginning, " Your suggestion in respect 
to Staunton would be admirable, like your other conceptions 
and acts." I value that old man's praise very highly, and wrote 
him a short note last night telling him so. I enclose some scraps 
clipped off a dirty rebel flag captured at Rich Mountain. . . . 

Am engaged now in arranging to march home the three- 
months men to be reorganized, and in clearing up matters gene- 
rally. ... I suppose McDowell drove the enemy from Manassas 
Junction yesterday ; if so the way will be pretty well cleared for 
the present. If any decided movement is made towards Rich- 
mond I shall feel sure that they cannot intend to trouble my 
people here. 

July 21, Beverly. . . . Were you satisfied with the result? 






PRIVATE LETTERS. 65 

Nine guns taken, twelve colors, lots of prisoners, and all this 
done with so little loss on our side ! We found yesterday some 
more guns abandoned by Garnett, bringing the number taken 
up to nine. . . . Gen. Cox has been badly checked in the 
Kanawha ; one wounded colonel (Newton) taken prisoner, two 
others and a lieutenant-colonel (Neff) captured while amusing 
themselves by an insane expedition in advance of the pick- 
ets served them right ! Cox lost more men in getting a de- 
tachment thrashed than I did in routing two armies. The 
consequence is, I shall move down with a heavy column to 
take Mr. Wise in rear, and hope either to drive him out with- 
out a battle or to catch him with his whole force. It is ab- 
solutely necessary for me to go in person ; I have no one to 
whom I can entrust the operation. More than that, I don't 
feel sure that the men will fight very well under any one but 
myself ; they have confidence in me and will do anything that 
I put them at. I lose about fourteen regiments now whose term 
of service is about expiring, and am sorry to say that I have as 
yet found but few whose patriotism is sufficient to induce them 
to remain beyond their time. I expect to get away from here 
by day after to-morrow at latest. The march to the Kanawha 
will require about seven days. I hope to be able to start for 
Cincinnati in about two weeks from to-morrow. I expect the 
Guthrie Grays here to-day, and will take them with me to the 
Kanawha. 



CHAPTER IV. 

Arrival at Washington Reception by Gen. Scott and the President 
Condition of the capital Takes command of the Division of the 
Potomac State of the army Numbers, increase, and position of 
troops. 

I REACHED Washington late in the afternoon of Friday, 
July 26. I called on Gen. Scott that evening, and next morn- 
ing reported to the adjutant-general, who instructed me to call 
upon the President, by whom I was received cordially and in- 
formed that he had placed me in command of Washington and 
all the troops in its vicinity. He directed me to return to the 
White House at one o'clock to be present at a cabinet meeting. 
I called again on Gen. Scott, then commanding the army of 
the United States, and, after conversing with him for some time 
on the state of affairs, casually remarked that I must take my 
leave, as the President had desired me to attend a cabinet meet- 
ing at one o'clock. Upon this the general became quite indig- 
nant and said that it was highly improper that I should receive 
such an invitation to his exclusion, and insisted upon keeping 
me until too late to attend the meeting. He then instructed me 
to ride around the city immediately and send stragglers back to 
their regiments. The general appeared to know and think very 
little about the defensive condition of the city and its approach- 
es, and was more concerned about the disorganized condition 
of the stragglers in the city itself. I explained to the Presi- 
dent later in the day the cause of my apparent lack of courtesy, 
at which he seemed more amused than otherwise. 

After leaving the general I rode around the outskirts of the 
city on the Maryland side towards Tennallytown, Seventh Street, 
etc., and examined some of the camps, but did not devote myself 
individually to the police work of picking up drunken stragglers. 
I found no preparations whatever for defence, not even to the 
extent of putting the troops in military positions. Not a regi- 
ment was properly encamped, not a single avenue of approach 
guarded. All was chaos, and the streets, hotels, and bar-rooms

CONDITION OF WASHINGTON. 6? 

were filled with drunken officers and men absent from their 
regiments without leave a perfect pandemonium. Many had 
even gone to their homes, their flight from Bull Run often ter- 
minating in New York, or even in New Hampshire and Maine. 
There was really nothing to prevent a small cavalry force from 
riding into the city. A determined attack would doubtless have 
carried Arlington Heights and placed the city at the mercy of 
a battery of rifled guns. If the secessionists attached any value 
to the possession of Washington, they committed their greatest 
error in not following up the victory of Bull Run.* 

On the 25th had been issued the order constituting the 
Division of the Potomac and assigning me to its command. 
The division consisted of the Department of Northeast Vir- 
ginia, under McDowell, which comprised all the troops in front 
of Washington on the Pennsylvania bank of the river, and the 
Department of Washington, under Mansfield, which comprised 
all the troops in Washington and its vicinity on the Maryland 
side. Neither of these officers seemed pleased with the new 
arrangement, more particularly Mansfield. 

On the 2yth I assumed command and lost no time in ac- 
quainting myself with the situation and applying the proper 
remedies. On the next day, Sunday, I rode along the lines on 

*The defenceless condition of Washington on this very day was de- 
scribed by Mr. Edwin M. Stanton, afterwards Secretary of War in Mr. 
Lincoln's cabinet, in a private letter, historic and prophetic, to ex-Presi- 
dent Buchanan, as follows : 

"WASHINGTON, July 26, l86l. 

" DEAR SIR: . . . The dreadful disaster of Sunday can scarcely be 
mentioned. The imbecility of this administration culminated in that catas- 
trophe ; an irretrievable misfortune and national disgrace never to be for- 
gotten are to be added to the ruin of all peaceful pursuits and national 
bankruptcy as the result of Lincoln's ' running the machine ' for five 
months. ... It is not unlikely that some change in the War and Navy 
Departments may take place, but none beyond those two departments 
until Jeff Davis turns out the whole concern. The capture of Washington 
seems now to be inevitable ; during the whole of Monday and Tuesday it 
might have been taken without any resistance. The rout, overthrow, and 
demoralization of the whole army is complete. Even now I doubt whether 
any serious opposition to the entrance of the Confederate forces could be 
offered. While Lincoln, Scott, and the cabinet are disputing who is to 
blame, the city is unguarded and the enemy at hand. Gen. McClellan 
reached here last evening. But if he had the ability of Csesar, Alexander, 
or Napoleon, what can he accomplish? Will not Scott's jealousy, cabi- 
net intrigues, and Republican interference thwart him at every step? . . . 
" Yours truly, EDWIN M. STANTON." 



68 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the Virginia side, beginning at Gen. W. T. Sherman's position 
opposite Georgetown. I found Sherman somewhat nervous. He 
attempted to dissuade me from passing outside of his pickets, 
believing the enemy to be close at hand. As that was precise- 
ly what I wanted to know, however, I did ride some distance 
beyond the pickets and found no enemy. 

The condition of things on the Virginia side was not much 

better than on the other. The troops were on the river-banks 

, or on the high ground immediately overlooking them. Few were 

in condition to fight, and but little had 'been done in the way of 

entrenching the approaches. 

Fort Ellsworth, near Alexandria ; Forts Runyon and Allan, 
at the end of the Long Bridge ; Fort Corcoran, at the head 
of Aqueduct Bridge, with one or two small adjacent batteries, 
comprised all the works completed on the south side. A small 
battery at the Maryland end of the Chain Bridge was the only 
one on the Washington side of the river. Two or three small 
entrenchments had just been commenced on Arlington Heights. 
These detached works simply covered some of the principal 
direct approaches from the Virginia side, but in no sense formed 
part of any general defensive line. 

The condition of affairs which thus presented itself to me 
upon assuming command was one of extreme difficulty and 
fraught with great danger. The defeated army of McDowell 
could not properly be called an army it was only a collection 
of undisciplined, ill-officered, and uninstructed men, who were, 
as a rule, much demoralized by defeat and ready to run at the 
first shot. Positions from which the city could be commanded 
by the enemy's guns were open for their occupation. The troops 
were as insufficient in number as in quality. The period of 
service of many regiments had expired, or would do so in a few 
days. There was so little discipline that officers and men left 
their camps at their own will, and, as I have already stated, the 
city was full of drunken men in uniform. The executive w is 
demoralized ; an attack by the enemy was expected from hour to 
hour ; material of war did not exist in anything like sufficient 
quantities ; and, lastly, I was not supreme and unhampered, but 
often thwarted by the lieutenant-general. 

I may 'be permitted to say that my arrival was hailed with 
delight by .all, .except, perhaps, the two generals whom I super- 



SAFETY OF THE CAPITAL. 69 

seded ; and that the executive and the country soon passed from 
a state of abject despair to confidence, as will appear from the 
newspapers of the time. 

The first and most pressing demand upon me was the imme- 
diate safety of the capital and the government. This was pro- 
vided for by at once exacting the most rigid discipline and 
order ; by arresting all ignorant officers and men, and sending 
them back to their regiments ; by instituting and enforcing strict 
rules in regard to permission for leaving the camps ; by prohibit- 
ing civilians and others not on duty from crossing the river or 
visiting the camps without permits from headquarters ; by organ- 
izing permanent brigades under regular officers, and by placing 
the troops in good defensive positions. I threw them further out 
from the city, so as to have space in rear for manoeuvring, and 
selected positions which commanded the various avenues of ap- 
proach to the city and enabled the different brigades to afford 
reciprocal support. 

I lost no time in acquiring an accurate knowledge of the 
ground in all directions, and by frequent visits to the troops 
made them personally acquainted with me, while I learned all 
about them, their condition and their needs, and thus soon 
succeeded in inspiring full confidence and a good morale in 
place of the lamentable state of affairs which existed on my 
arrival. 

Thus I passed long days in the saddle and my nights in the 
office a very fatiguing life, but one which made my power felt 
everywhere and by every one. There were about one thousand 
regular infantry with McDowell at Arlington. These, with a 
regular battery and a squadron of regular cavalry, I at once 
brought to the city and employed as a provost-guard, with the 
most satisfactory results. It was through their discipline, steadi- 
ness, and devotion that order was so promptly established. The 
following order explains itself : 

General Order No. 2. 

HEADQUARTERS, DIVISION OF THE POTOMAC, 

WASHINGTON, July 30, 1861. 

The general commanding the division has with much regret 
observed that large numbers of officers and men stationed in the 
vicinity of Washington are in the habit of frequenting the streets 



7<D McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

i 

and hotels of the city. This practice is eminently prejudicial to 
good order and military discipline, ;md must at once be discon- 
tinued. The time and services of all persons connected with this 
division should be devoted to their appropriate duties with their 
respective commands. It is therefore directed that hereafter no 
officer or soldier be allowed to absent himself from his camp and 
visit Washington except for the performance of some public duty 
or for the transaction of important private business, for which 
purpose written permits will be given by the commanders of bri- 
gades. The permit will state the object of the visit. Brigade 
commanders will be held responsible for the strict execution of 
this order. Col. Andrew Porter, of the i6th U. S. Infantry, 
is detached for temporary duty as provost-marshal in Washing- 
ton, and will be obeyed and respected accordingly. Col. Porter 
will report in person at these headquarters for instructions. 
By command of Maj.-Gen. McClellan. 

(Signed) S. WILLIAMS, 

Asst. Adjt.-Gen. 

The effect of all this was that on the 4th of August I was able 
to write to one of my family : " I have Washington perfectly 
quiet now ; you would not know that there was a regiment here. 
I have restored order very completely already." 

In re-arranging the posts and organization of the troops I 
brought over to the Washington side of the river those regiments 
which had been most shaken and demoralized by the defeat of 
Bull Run, and retained them there, with the newly arriving regi- 
ments, until in fit condition to be trusted on the side towards the 
enemy. My report (made in 1863) gives in sufficient detail the 
measures taken to expedite the instruction, discipline, and equip- 
ment of the new regiments on the Washington side before assign- 
ing them to brigades in front of the enemy. I also proceeded at 
once to reorganize the various staff departments on a footing 
commensurate with the actual and future condition of affairs, and 
used every effort to hasten the arrival of new regiments, as well 
as the manufacture and purchase of war material of all kinds. 

Fortunately I had some excellent officers at my disposal and 
at once made use of them. 

At this period I committed one of my greatest errors that was 
in retaining Gen. McDowell on duty with the troops under my 
command. I knew that he had been a close student of military 
affairs, and thought that he possessed sufficient ability to be use- 
ful in a subordinate capacity. Moreover, I pitied him extremely, 



GENERAL Me DO WELL. Jl 

and thought that circumstances had as much to do with his 
failure at Bull Run as any want of ability and energy on his part. 
I knew that if I sent him away he would be ruined for life, and 
desired to give him an opportunity to retrieve his military repu- 
tation. I therefore left him in the nominal command on the Vir- 
ginia side of the river until the order forming the Army of the 
Potomac was issued ; he doing some little bureau work and re- 
taining a large staff, while I performed the real military labor 
demanded by the occasion. I was sadly deceived. He never 
v appreciated my motives, and felt no gratitude for my forbearance 
and kindness. Subsequent events proved that, although in some 
respects a very good bureau officer and a fair disciplinarian and 
drill-officer for a school of instruction, he lacked the qualities 
necessary for a commander in the field. After Pope's campaign 
it was not safe for McDowell to visit the camps of his troops ; 
the men declared that they would kill him. I have long been 
convinced that he intrigued against me to the utmost of his 
power. His conduct towards Fitz-John Porter on the second 
Bull Run ^ campaign, his testimony in the latter's trial, and sub- 
sequent rehearing in 1880, show what manner of man he was. 
In all human probability I should have been spared an infinite 
amount of trouble had I relieved him upon reaching Washington, 
and allowed him to sink at once into obscurity. 

When I resumed command it was clear that a prompt advance 
was wholly impracticable ; for, as I have already stated, the mass 
of the troops placed under me were utterly demoralized and 
destitute of organization, instruction, discipline, artillery, cavalry, 
transportation. I repeat that it was not worthy to be called an 
army. The request to bring with me, or cause to follow, a few 
of the victorious regiments from West Virginia was denied. As 
it was, nothing remained but to create an army and material as 
rapidly as possible from the very foundation. 

The result of the first Bull Run had changed the conditions 
of the problem and complicated them exceedingly. In West 
Virginia I had raw troops against raw troops ; my opponents 
had all the advantages of knowledge of the ground, strong posi- 
tions, and a country peculiarly adapted to the defensive. Yet I 
did not hesitate to attack, and gained complete success. I felt 
that against troops who had never been under fire and were not 
particularly well commanded the offensive offered great advan- 



72 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

tages, and also felt entire confidence in my ability to handle my 
men, many of whom had attained a certain rough kind of dis- 
cipline at Camp Dennison. But at Washington everything was 
different. The enemy not only had all the advantages of posi- 
tion, of entrenchments, of the morale resulting from success, 
but his discipline and drill were far better than our own. It 
would have been madness to renew the attempt until a com- 
plete change was made, for all the advantages of a sudden 
movement had been lost. The problem now was to attack vic- 
torious and finely drilled troops in entrenchment. I knew that 
this could be done only by well-organized and well-drilled troops, 
well supplied with artillery and other arms of service ; the future 
of the war proved the correctness of this view. I had, therefore, 
no choice but to create a real army and its material out of 
nothing. The contest had already assumed such a phase that 
large masses were necessary to decide it. To use such masses 
they must be organized and instructed. Perhaps even then a 
fiew thousand regulars would have decided the war. But we 
had them not ! 

Let those who criticise me for the delay in creating an army 
and its material point out an instance when so much has been 
done with the same means in so short a time. 

Not only was it necessary to organize, discipline, and drill 
the troops, but the immense labor of constructing the fortifica- 
tions required to secure the city in the absence of the army was 
also to be performed by the troops. Not only did this consume 
much time and greatly retard the preparation of the army for the 
field, but it tied down the troops to the line of the defences, and 
rendered it impossible to take up a more advanced position until 
the works were finished. 

Before my arrival no one had contemplated the complete for- 
tification of the city. I at once conceived the idea and carried it 
into effect ; for I saw immediately that the safety of the capital 
would always be a great clog on the movements of the army, un- 
less its security were amply guaranteed by strong entrenchments. 
I cannot speak in too high terms of the cheerfulness, zeal, and 
activity with which these raw troops performed this arduous and 
disagreeable labor. They gave thus early an earnest of what 
might be expected from them under more trying circumstances. 

The system adopted was that of detached earthworks. The 



PLAN OF FORTIFICATIONS. 73 

most important points were occupied by large bastioned forts 
closed at the gorge, with magazines, platforms, etc. ; the scarps 
and counterscarps often reveted with timber, the parapets usually 
sodded. The intermediate points were occupied by lunettes, re- 
doubts, batteries, etc., and in a few cases these were united by 
infantry parapets. The entire circumference of the city was thus 
protected. Towards Manassas the very important advanced 
points of Upton's and Munson's Hills were held by strong 
works, with some small batteries near by. This was the key 
to the approach in that direction. 

In weighing the magnitude of the task of organizing the 
Army of the Potomac it must be borne in mind that the defi- 
ciency of instructed officers was almost as great as that of 
well-instructed non-commissioned officers and soldiers. 

It is important to emphasize the condition of affairs at this 
juncture. If the enemy advanced in fair condition and reason- 
able force direct upon Washington, there were no means of pre- 
venting his occupation of Arlington Heights and the bombard- 
ment of the city. If he availed himself of the low water in the 
Potomac and crossed at or above the Great Falls, at the same 
time making a feint on the direct approaches, he could enter the 
city unopposed. For when I arrived there were neither entrench- 
ments nor troops in position on the Maryland side, and Banks's 
command, near Harper's Ferry, was so distant, so unorganized, 
demoralized, and unfit to march or fight, that it could exercise no 
influence on the result. 

Soon after my arrival I called upon Gen. McDowell, then in 
command of all the troops on the Virginia side, for a report as to 
the condition of his command. On the 3oth of July he reported 
as follows : 

" An inspection commenced yesterday by all the regular offi- 
cers who were available, and is still going on, of all the regiments 
in this department. When the reports are made I shall be able 
to give something more than a mere opinion as to their condition 
to take the field. In the absence of any precise information I 
should say that but few regiments, if any, are in such condition 
at this time. Those who were in the last movement are not yet 
recovered, and the others are raw. Such as they are, about 
twenty regiments could be set in motion in two or three days. 
But few would have any organization with which they would be 
at all acquainted, and would have but little confidence in them-

selves or each other. But one battery of artillery ready ; the 
others are refitting. The three companies of cavalry are a good 
deal run down. One New York regiment (Quimby's) is in a 
state of utter demoralization and asking to be discharged. In 
another (Bruin's) all the field officers tendered their resignation. 
An inspection of Quimby's, made by Major Wadsworth, seems to 
show that we have but one ultimatum to dissolve it as worthless. 
I shall be at your headquarters this P.M." 

On the 2d of August I received from Col. F. J. Porter, who 
had been on duty with Gen. Patterson, and continued with his 
successor, Gen. Banks, a letter from Sandy Hook, under date of 
the ist of Aug., from which I give the following extract : 

" That the government should not suffer by my withdrawal 
from this command, on the arrival of Gen. Banks I consented to 
remain, and had myself assigned to the position of acting in- 
spector-general, in order to accomplish what no one else here can 
a reorganization of this demoralized force. I think within a 
week I shall have placed it in excellent order for brigade com- 
manders to perfect. My occupation will then be gone, unless 
this force is to take the initiative and enter on an active cam- 
paign. If to be active, with confidence reposed in me, I can be 
of much use and render the country essential services. But can 
I do so in other positions and more satisfactory to myself ? 
Should the campaign turn out as the last, the odium which has 
been thrown unjustly upon Patterson will be reflected upon me 
and his other advisers. Time and orders from high authority 
will show he was right, and the country should be thankful. But 
I cannot bear another such, and see my companions, my juniors, 
rising to distinction and position, while I must plod alway in a 
beaten and sandy track. . . ." 

Every one in Washington realized the imminent danger of its 
capture, and none dreamed of a renewal of the attack upon 
Manassas under the circumstances and with the means at hand. 
They were but too well satisfied with the assurance that the mea- 
sures I took would secure order and preserve the capital from 
insult or capture. A new advance made soon after the first 
would, if unsuccessful, have been certainly followed by the 
prompt occupation of Washington by the enemy. Until the 
new army was in such condition as to make success certain, it 
would have been unpardonable folly to advance without leaving 
Washington so well entrenched and garrisoned as to afford a safe 
retreat to the entire army if repulsed. This was impracticable 



METHOD OF MAKING RETURNS. 75 

when I assumed command, and the Confederates, while receiv- 
ing large accessions of force, lost no time in constructing strong 
entrenchments at Centreville, Manassas, etc. 

There was so much misunderstanding and there were so many 
misrepresentations during the war as to the effective strength of 
the Army of the Potomac that it is necessary to explain briefly 
the manner in which the returns were made up. 

They showed 

ist. The number of officers and men " present for duty." 

2d. The number of officers and men " present sick." 

3d. The number of officers and men " present in arrest." 

4th. The total present, this being the sum of the three pre- 
ceding items. 

5th. The number absent. 

6th. The total present and absent, made up by taking the 
sum of items 4th and 5th. 

It is, of course, clear that the first item comprises all the offi- 
cers and men who are effective for the immediate work of the 
army, yet either through ignorance, or to injure me by exagger- 
ating the force at my disposal often the " total present," often 
the " aggregate present and absent," was given, by those occupy- 
ing official positions, as the effective strength of the Army of the 
Potomac. In the latter case this sometimes involved an exag- 
geration of over sixty per cent. ; as, for example, on July 10, 
1862, the total present for duty was 89,549, while the aggregate 
present and absent was 144,886. 

Nor, as our returns were made during the first two years of 
the war, were the numbers given as " present for duty " by any 
means a true measure of the effective force, because one of the 
instructions for making out the returns was that " all officers and 
enlisted men present on extra or daily duty will be borne in the 
column of ' present for duty.' " Therefore there were includ- 
ed among the " present for duty " all camp, train, and special 
guards, all men detailed for duty as teamsters, laborers, and other- 
wise, in the headquarters, commissary, engineer, medical, and 
ordnance departments ; all orderlies, cooks, officers' servants in 
short, those who form no part of the fighting strength of an army, 
and who in every European and other service, except our own, 
are borne in a separate column as present on special extra or 
daily duty, so that the column of " present for duty " then gives 



76 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the actual available fighting force. After careful study, and with 
ample means to reach accurate results, Gen. A. A. Humphreys 
estimates the number of extra-duty officers and men, not includ- 
ing camp-guards, orderlies, cooks, etc., etc., who were not in the 
ranks of the Army of the Potomac at all on the 2oth of June, 
1862, to be from 17,000 to 18,000 out of 105,000, or about one- 
sixth. This is, doubtless, very near the truth, and not above it ; 
so that, as the Confederates reported only the officers and men in 
ranks as present for duty, there must always be deducted from 
the " present for duty " strength of the Army of the Potomac 
during the first two years of the war about one-sixth to make a 
fair comparison with the enemy. But, allowing for camp-guards 
and officers' servants, etc., a deduction of one-fifth at least should 
be made. 

On the ist of Aug., 1861, I had, according to the returns, 
less than 50,000 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, 650 artillerists with 30 
guns, present. Bearing in mind what has just been stated, and 
making the proper deduction for the sick, in arrest, and on extra 
duty, it appears that there were certainly not more than 37,000 
infantry in the ranks. The term of service of many of these 
regiments was about expiring, and they were gradually replaced 
by perfectly raw new regiments. On the ipth of Aug. I had 
less than 42,000 effective of all arms, such as they were ; and the 
most necessary defences still required about a week to enable 
them to resist assaults with tolerable certainty. On the 2oth of 
Aug. I had 80 guns and less than 1,200 cavalry. On the 25th 
of Aug. I had about 50,000 effective of all arms and perhaps 
100 guns. The return for Aug. 31, 1861, shows that, exclud- 
ing Gen. Dix's command, there was an " aggregate present " of 
76,415 of all arms. This comprised Banks's command near Har- 
per's Ferry and above, and Stone's corps of observation at Pooles- 
ville. It Jncluded the sick, those under arrest, and all extra-duty 
men. Making the proper deduction on these accounts, the effec- 
tive force, including Banks's and Stone's, is reduced to 58,680 
officers and men of all arms ; many of these being still unfit for 
service through lack of discipline and instruction, unserviceable 
arms, etc. This is just about the number of effectives reported 
by the Confederates as composing Johnston's command. 

After providing, even very insufficiently, for watching the 
Potomac and guarding the communication with Baltimore, there

would not have been left more than 45,000 effectives for the gar- 
rison of Washington and active operation. Certainly not 10,000 
of these troops were in any condition to make an offensive move- 
ment, nor were they sufficient in numbers to furnish an active 
column which would give the slightest hope of success after mak- 
ing even a small provision for the safety of the capital. 

On the i5th of Oct., 1861, the troops under my 

command " present for duty " numbered . . 133,200

.tions to Philadelphia, and the immediate 
approaches to Baltimore, including An- 
napolis. In view of the strong secessionist 
feeling in his district it would have been 
dangerous to leave him with less than . 10,000 

The upper Potomac, from Washington to Cum- 
berland, a distance of more than one hun-

mand of all the armies of the United States, far less free to dis- 
regard the administration. Had I been chief of the state the 
conditions of the problem would have been very different. In 
that case, with the discipline, instruction, and armament suffi- 
ciently advanced which was not the fact I would not have 
hesitated to throw Banks on Winchester with 15,000 men, to act 
on the left flank of the enemy at Manassas, and, reducing the 
garrison of Washington to 10,000 men, advance on Manassas 
with 60,000 men ; that would have been the best that could have 
been done, and in that event 10,000 must have watched the line 
of the Occoquan, leaving 50,000 available for the attack on Man :

Up to the beginning of November, and still later, many of 
the infantry were insufficiently drilled and disciplined, and they 
were to a considerable extent armed with unserviceable weapons. 
Few of the cavalry were completely armed, and most of the vol- 
unteer cavalry were still very inefficient. The artillery numbered 
228 guns, but many of the batteries were still entirely unfit to 
take the field. Transportation was still lacking for any extended 
movements.

On the 27th of Aug., when I assumed command of the 
Division of the Potomac, Gen. Banks had just been relieved by 
Gen. Dix in the command of the Department of Maryland, and 
in his turn relieved Gen. Patterson whose term of service ex- 
pired on that day in the command of the Department of the 
Shenandoah. On the ist of Aug. Gen. Banks's headquarters 
were at Sandy Hook, in the immediate vicinity of Harper's 
Ferry. In consequence of the expiration of service of the three- 
months regiments this command was in a state of disorganiza- 
tion for the moment. 

As the geographical Division of the Potomac extended along 
that river somewhat beyond the Monocacy, and it fell within 
my province to guard that part of the river, within two or three 
days after assuming command I organized a brigade of four 
regiments, under Gen. C. P. Stone, and ordered him to the 
vicinity of Poolesville to observe and guard the Potomac be- 
tween the Great Falls and the limits of Gen. Banks's command. 
On the 2d of Aug. the seven regiments of the Pennsylvania 
Reserve Corps, then arrived, were organized as a brigade under 
Gen. G. A. McCall, and ordered to Tennallytown to guard the 
important roads meeting at that point, and to observe the river 
as far as the Great Falls. At this place the brigade was in 
position to support Stone and the troops at the Chain Bridge, 
and, in case of necessity, would rapidly move by the Aqueduct 
Bridge to support the troops at Fort Corcoran and Arlington 
Heights. On the ist the two regiments at the Chain Bridge 
were placed under the command of Col. W. F. Smith, and with- 
in three days his command was increased to four regiments of 
infantry, one battery, and one company of cavalry. At the same 
time Couch's brigade was posted at the Toll-Gate on the Sev- 
enth Street road, where the Milkhouse Ford and Blagden's Mill 



SO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

roads intersect it. Hooker's brigade was posted on the Bla- 
densburg road, near the position afterwards entrenched. Gen. 
W. T. Sherman's brigade, reinforced by three regiments of in- 
fantry, with one battery and one company of regular cavalry, 
occupied Fort Corcoran, at the head of the Georgetown Aque- 
duct Bridge. Gens. Hunter's and Keyes's brigades held the 
Arlington Heights. Col. Richardson's brigade was posted in 
advance of the Long Bridge, with one regiment in Fort Run- 
yon. Near this were a couple of light batteries under Col. H. 
J. Hunt, ready to move whenever required. Col. Blenker's bri- 
gade was in advance of Roach's Mills, in the valley of Four- 
Mile Run. Gens. Franklin's and Heintzelman's brigades were 
in front of Alexandria, in the vicinity of the Seminary. Kear- 
ny's brigade was at Cloud's Mills, on the Annandale turnpike. 
One regiment was stationed at Fort Ellsworth, immediately in 
front of Alexandria. 

I had thus provided against all eventualities as well as the 
means in my possession permitted. If the enemy confined him- 
self to a direct advance the probable points of attack were held 
by eight brigades, so posted that they could render mutual as- 
sistance, if all were not simultaneously assailed in force, while 
the brigades of McCall, Couch, and Hooker could move by 
good roads to support them ; Hooker having about five miles 
to march to the Long Bridge, Couch about six to the Long 
Bridge, the Aqueduct, or to the Chain Bridge, and McCall hav- 
ing a little over three miles to the Chain Bridge or the Aque- 
duct, or about six miles to the Long Bridge. 

If the enemy crossed the Potomac for the purpose of attack- 
ing on the Maryland side, Stone was in position to fall back on 
McCall or Couch after retarding their passage of the river ; so 
that there would have been four brigades, with good communi- 
cation to either flank, in readiness to oppose them, while troops 
could have been brought from the Virginia side to their support. 

In the city were the few regulars acting as a provost-guard, 
and ready to be thrown wherever their services might be re- 
quired. 

On the 5th of Aug. the first three regiments of the Ex- 
celsior Brigade and the 79th New York were formed into a 
provisional brigade and posted in the suburbs of Washington ; 
they were soon moved south of the Anacostia to the vicinity of 



FORMATION OF DIVISIONS. 8l 

Uniontown. On the yth McCall received a battery of regular 
artillery ; and on the pth Kearny and Sherman each received 
another company of volunteer cavalry, and on the same day 
King's brigade of three regiments was formed, and posted on 
Meridian Hill. Three days afterwards it was increased by two 
regiments. On the loth a battery was sent to Stone, and a 
second one to McCall, who received another regiment on the 
1 2th. 

The formation of divisions was thus : 

Aug. 24, 1 86 1 : McDowell's division, consisting of Keyes's 
and Wadsworth's brigades. King's brigade was added on Oct. 5. 

About the same date />., within two or three days after the 
formation of the Army of the Potomac the troops under Gen. 
Banks were organized as a division. 

Aug. 28, 1 86 1 : Franklin's division, consisting of Kearny's 
and Franklin's old brigade. A third brigade added Sept. 4. 

Aug. 30, 1 86 1 : F. J. Porter's division, consisting of two bri- 
gades. A third brigade added Sept. 27. 

Sept. 12, 1 86 1 : Stone's division, consisting of two brigades, 
Lander's and Peck's. Baker's brigade was added towards the 
end of the month or early in October. 

Sept. 14, 1 86 1 : Buell's division, consisting of Couch's and 
Graham's brigades. A third brigade added early in October. 

Sept. 1 6, 1 86 1 : McCall's division ; on the 25th of that month 
he received the last two regiments of the Pennsylvania Reserves, 
so that his division consisted of thirteen regiments in three bri- 
gades, under Meade, J. F. Reynolds, and Ord. 

Sept. 28, 1 86 1 : W. F. Smith's division, consisting of the Ver- 
mont brigade (afterwards Brooks's), J. J. Stevens's and Han- 
cock's brigades. 

Oct. 5, 1 86 1 : Heintzelman's division, consisting of Richard- 
son's, Sedgwick's, and Jameson's brigades. 

Oct. n, 1861 : Hooker's division, consisting of his own (after- 
wards Naglee's) brigade and Sickles's brigade. In November 
a third brigade (Starr's New Jersey) was added. 

Oct. 12, 1 86 1 : Blenker's division, consisting of Stahl's and 
Steinwehr's brigades. A third brigade added during the winter. 

Nov. 25, 1 86 1 : Sumner's division, consisting of Howard's, 
Meagher's, and French's brigades. 

Dec. 6, 1 86 1 : Casey's division, consisting of three brigades. 



CHAPTER V. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[Jufy 27 to Sept. 30, 1 86 1.] 

July 27, 1 86 1, Washington, D. C. I have been assigned to 
the command of a division composed of the departments of 
northeastern Virginia (that under McDowell) and that of Wash- 
ington (now under Mansfield). Neither of them like it much, 
especially Mansfield ; but I think they must ere long become 
accustomed to it, as there is no help for it. ... I find myself 
in a new and strange position here : President, cabinet, Gen. 
Scott, and all deferring to me. By some strange operation of 
magic I seem to have become the power of the land. 

I see already the main causes of our recent failure ; I am 
sure that I can remedy these, and am confident that I can lead 
these armies of men to victory once more. I start to-morrow 
very early on a tour through the lines on the other side of the 
river. It will occupy me all day long, and a rather fatiguing 
ride it will be, but I will be able to make up my mind as to the 
state of things. Refused invitations to dine to-day from Gen. 
Scott and four secretaries ; had too many things to attend to. ... 

I will endeavor to enclose with this the " thanks of Congress," 
which please preserve. I feel very proud of it. Gen. Scott 
objected to it on the ground that it ought to be accompanied 
by a gold medal. I cheerfully acquiesce in the thanks by them- 
selves, hoping to win the medal by some other action, and the 
sword by some other fait a" eclat. 

July 30, Washington. . . . Had to work until nearly three 
this morning. ... I am getting my ideas pretty well arranged in 
regard to the strength of my army ; it will be a very large one. 
I have been employed in trying to get the right kind of general 
officers. . . . Have been working this morning at a bill allowing 
me to appoint as many aides as I please from civil life and from 
the army. . . . 

I went to the Senate to get it through, and was quite over- 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 83 

whelmed by the congratulations I received and the respect with 
which I was treated. I suppose half a dozen of the oldest made 
the remark I am becoming so much used to : " Why, how young 
you look, and yet an old soldier ! " It seems to strike every- 
body that I am very young. They give me my way in every- 
thing, full swing and unbounded confidence. All tell me that I 
am held responsible for the fate of the nation, and that all its 
resources shall be placed at my disposal. It is an immense task 
that I have on my hands, but I believe I can accomplish it. ... 
When I was in the Senate chamber to-day and found those old 
men flocking around me ; when I afterwards stood in the library, 
looking over the Capitol of our great nation, and saw the crowd 
gathering around to stare at me, I began to feel how great the 
task committed to me. Oh ! how sincerely I pray to God that 
I may be endowed with the wisdom and courage necessary to 
accomplish the work. Who would have thought, when we were 
married, that I should so soon be called upon to save my 
country ? 

Aug. 2. Rode over the river, looked at some of the works, 
and inspected three or four regiments ; worked at organizing 
brigades just got through with that. I handed to the President 
to-night a carefully considered plan for conducting the war on 
a large scale. ... I shall carry this thing on en grand and 
crush the rebels in one campaign. I flatter myself that Beau- 
regard has gained his last victory. We need success and must 
have it. I will leave nothing undone to gain it. Gen. Scott has 
been trying to work a traverse to have made inspector-gene- 
ral of my army and of the army. I respectfully declined the 
favor. . . . 

I have on the staff Seth Williams as adjutant-general ; Barnard 
as chief-engineer ; Van Vliet, chief-quartermaster ; H. F. Clarke, 
chief-commissary; Barry, chief of artillery; Meade will be se- 
nior topographer ; Ur. Tripler, medical director. I have applied 
for Kingsbury as chief of ordnance, and for Armstrong and 
Sweitzer as aides-de-camp. I dine with the President to-morrow, 
where I presume I shall meet Prince Napoleon. . . . You would 
laugh if you could see the scores of queer letters I receive in 
these days. I am sorry to say I do not answer any of them ; I 
do no writing myself, except to you. ... I was in the saddle 



84 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

nearly twelve hours yesterday. -I broke down your father and 
sent Seth home half an hour since, neither of them having been 
out all to-day. 

Aug. 4. I dined at the President's yesterday. I suppose 
some forty were present Prince Napoleon and his staff, French 
minister, English ditto, cabinet, some senators, Gen. Scott, and 
myself. The dinner was not especially interesting ; rather long, 
and rather tedious, as such things generally are. I was placed 
between Col. Pisani, one of the prince's aides, who spoke no 

English, and a member of the legation who labored under 

the delusion that he spoke our native tongue with fluency. I 
had some long talks with the prince, who speaks English very 
much as the Frenchmen do in the old English comedies. He 
is an intelligent man. ... It made me feel a little strangely when 
I went in to the President's last evening with the old general 
leaning on me ; I could see that many marked the contrast. 
... I have Washington perfectly quiet now. You would not 
know that there was a regiment here. I have restored order very 
completely already. 

Aug. 8. . . . Rose early to-day (having retired at three 
A.M.), and was pestered to death with senators, etc., and a row 
with Gen. Scott until about four o'clock ; then crossed the river 
and rode beyond and along the line of pickets for some distance. 
Came back and had a long interview with Seward about my 
" pronunciamiento " against Gen. Scott's policy. ... I have 
scarcely slept one moment for the last three nights, knowing well 
that the enemy intend some movement and fully recognizing our 
own weakness. If Beauregard does not attack to-night I shall 
look upon it as a dispensation of Providence. He ought to do 
it. Every day strengthens me. I am leaving nothing undone 
to increase our force ; but the old general always comes in 
the way. He understands nothing, appreciates nothing. 

Aug. . On Sunday, instead of going to church, was sent 
for by the President immediately after breakfast, and kept busy 
until midnight, when I returned from a long ride too tired to talk 
even. Yesterday in the saddle from ten to five, and then per- 
secuted until after midnight. To-day the President sent for me 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 85 

before I was up ; have been at work ever since, and soon start 
out to receive a brigade and some batteries. 

Aug. 9, 1861, i A.M. I have had a busy day: started from 
here at seven in the morning, and was in the saddle until about 
nine this evening; rode over the advanced position on the other 
side of the river, was soundly drenched in a hard rain, and have 
been busy ever since my return. Things are improving daily. 
I received three new regiments to-day; fitted out one new battery 
yesterday, another to-day, two to-morrow, about five day after. 
Within four days I hope to have at least 21 batteries say 124 
field-guns 18 companies of cavalry, and some 70 regiments of 
infantry. Gen. Scott is the great obstacle. He will not com- 
prehend the danger. I have to fight my way against him. To- 
morrow the question will probably be decided by giving me 
absolute control independently of him. I suppose it will result 
in enmity on his part against me ; but I have no choice. The 
people call upon me to save the country. I must save it, and 
cannot respect anything that is in the way. 

I receive letter after letter, have conversation after conversa- 
tion, calling on me to save the nation, alluding to the presidency, 
dictatorship, etc. As I hope one day to be united with you 
for ever in heaven, I have no such aspiration. I would cheerfully 
take the dictatorship and agree to lay down my life when the 
country is saved. I am not spoiled by my unexpected new posi- 
tion. I feel sure that God will give me the strength and wisdom 
to preserve this great nation ; but I tell you, who share all my 
thoughts, that I have no selfish feeling in this matter. I feel that 
God has placed a great work in my hands. I have not sought 
it. I know how weak I am, but I know that I mean to do right, 
and I believe that God will help me and give me the wisdom I 
do not possess. Pray for me, that I may be able to accomplish 
my task, the greatest, perhaps, that any poor, weak mortal ever 
had to do. ... God grant that I may bring this war to an end 
and be permitted to spend the rest of my days quietly with 
you ! 

I met the prince (Napoleon) at Alexandria to-day and came 
up with him. He says that Beauregard's head is turned ; that 
Joe Johnston is quiet and sad, and that he spoke to him in very 
kind terms of me. 



86 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Aug. 12. . . . Every day shows some progress. If Beau- 
regard will give me another week or ten days I will feel quite 
comfortable again. I have been anxious, especially as the old 
man and I do not get along very well together. 

Aug. 13. I am living in Com. Wilkes's house, the northwest 
corner of Jackson Square, close by where you used to visit Secre- 
tary Marcy's family. It is a very nice house. I occupy the 
three front rooms on the second story ; Van Vliet the room in 
rear of mine ; Judge Key behind him ; Colburn the story above. 
I receive the staff every morning until ten and every evening at 
nine. Quite a levee it makes, and a rather fine-looking set they 
are. Kingsbury arrived last night. Did I tell you that Hudson 
is one of my regular aides ? 

Aug. 14. Rode to McCall's camp, out to the line of pickets, 
and followed that to the Aqueduct Bridge, thence home by W. F. 
Smith's camp ; got home at ten P.M. 

Midnight, \$th. ... I am almost tired out ; I cannot get 
one minute's rest during the day, and sleep with one eye open 
at night, looking out sharply for Beauregard, who, I think, has 
some notion of making a dash in this direction. Gen. Scott is 
the most dangerous antagonist I have. Our ideas are so widely 
different that it is impossible for us to work together much 
longer tant pour cela. My day has been spent much as usual. 
. . . Rose at 6.30 ; did any reasonable amount of business, 
among which may be classed quelling a couple of mutinies among 
the volunteers ; started on my usual ride at 4.30, came home at 
nine ; have been hard at work ever since. As to my mutinous 
friends, I have ordered sixty-three of the 2d Maine regiment to 
be sent as prisoners to the Dry Tortugas, there to serve out the 
rest of the war as prisoners at hard labor. I reduced the others 
(79th N. Y.) by sending out a battalion, battery, and squadron of 
regulars to take care of them. The gentlemen at once laid down 
their arms, and I have the ringleaders in irons. They will be 
tried and probably shot to-morrow. An example is necessary to 
bring these people up to the mark ; and if they will not fight and 
do their duty from honorable motives, I intend to coerce them 
and let them see what they have to expect if they pretend to 






PRIVATE LETTERS. 7 

rebel. I deprived the 79th of their colors, and have them down- 
stairs, not to be returned to them until they have earned them 
again by good behavior. The great trouble is the want of officers 
of regiments. We have good material, but no officers. 

Aug. 14, 1 86 1. I was so occupied yesterday that I could 
not write. Profs. Mahan and Bache at breakfast. Then came 
the usual levee. Then Burnside turned up, and I had to listen to 
h'is explanation of some slanders against him ; then some naval 
officers ; then I don't know how many others before dinner. 
After dinner I rode out until about nine, when I found the Presi- 
dent had been to see me and wanted me at the White House. 
After I got through there I went to see Montgomery Blair on 
business. Then, on my return, found some more of the cabinet, 
McDowell, etc.,- so that it was after midnight when I got to my 
room, completely fatigued. So my days and nights pass, a steady 
course of conversations and orders all day. Except when I get 
out for a ride, no relief for mind or body. 

Washington, i6//7. ... I am here in a terrible place : the 
enemy have from three to four times my force ; the President, the 
old general, cannot or will not see the true state of affairs. Most 
of my troops are demoralized by the defeat at Bull Run ; some 
regiments even mutinous. I have probably stopped that ; but 
you see my position is not pleasant. ... I have, I believe, made 
the best possible disposition of the few men under my command ; 
will quietly await events, and, if the enemy attacks, will try to 
make my movements as rapid and desperate as may be. If my 
men will only fight I think I can thrash him, notwithstanding the 
disparity of numbers. As it is, I trust to God to give success to 
our arms, though He is not wont to aid those who refuse to aid 
themselves. ... I am weary of all this. I have no ambition in 
the present affairs ; only wish to save my country, and find the 
incapables around me will not permit it. They sit on the verge 
of the precipice, and cannot realize what they see. Their reply 
to everything is, " Impossible ! Impossible ! " They think nothing 
possible which is against their wishes. 

Aug. 1 6, 6 P.M. . . . Gen. Scott is at last opening his eyes 
to the fact that I am right and that we are in imminent danger. 



88 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Providence is aiding me by heavy rains, which are swelling the 
Potomac, which may be impassable for a week ; if so we are 
saved. If Beauregard comes down upon us soon I have every- 
thing ready to make a manoeuvre which will be decisive. Give 
me two weeks and I will defy Beauregard ; in a week the chances 
will be at least even. 

Aug. 1 8. My command is at last extended, so that I take 
in Banks in the Shenandoah and Dix at Baltimore. . . . Trie 
true reason why I did not bring you here was that I did not deem 
it safe. We may have to fight a battle under the defences of 
Washington within a week, and I did not care to have you ex- 
posed to the chances. If Beauregard does not attack within two 
days he has lost every chance of success. If by the time you 
receive this letter you have not heard of a battle through the tele- 
graph you may be easy and contented. 

Aug. 19. ... If this week passes without a battle, and 
reinforcements come in, I shall feel sure that the dangerous point 
is turned. 

6 P.M. I have been inspecting the defences over the river and 
find them quite strong. We are becoming stronger in our posi- 
tion every day, and I hope for large reinforcements this week. 

Aug. 20. ... If Beauregard does not attack this week he 
is foolish. He has given me infinite advantages, and you may be 
sure I have not neglected the opportunity. Every day adds to 
the strength of my defences, to the perfection of the organiza- 
tion, and some little to our forces. I have now about 80 field- 
guns (there were but 49 at Bull Run), and by Saturday will have 
112. There were only some 400 cavalry at Bull Run; I now 
have about 1,200, and by the close of the week will have some 
3,000. I am gaining rapidly in every way. I can now defend 
Washington with almost perfect certainty. When I came here it 
could have been taken with the utmost ease. In a week I ought 
to be perfectly safe and be prepared to defend all Maryland ; in 
another week to advance our position. 

. . . The men were very enthusiastic and looked well. My 
old State will come out handsomely. I have been much vexed 
to-night by sundry troublesome things ; the only comfort has been 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 89 

your father's arrival, which is a great relief to me. I like to see 
that cool, steady head near me. 

Aug. 23. . . . Yesterday I rode to Alexandria and re- 
viewed four brigades that is, seventeen regiments. . . . Beau- 
regard has missed his chance, and I have gained what I most 
needed time ! . . . 

I do not live at all ; merely exist, worked and worried half to 
death. I have no privacy, no leisure, no relaxation, except in 
reading your letters and writing to you. We take our meals at 
Wormley's, a colored gentleman who keeps a restaurant just 
around the corner in I Street. I take breakfast there pretty 
regularly; sometimes have it sent over here. As to dinner, it 
takes its chances, and generally gets no chance at all, as it is often 
ten o'clock when I get back from my ride, and I have nothing to 
eat all day. . . . 

Aug. 25. Yesterday started at nine A.M., rode over Long 
Bridge and reviewed Richardson's brigade, then v/ent three miles 
further and at twelve reviewed Blenker's brigade at Roach's 
Mills, then rode some ten miles looking for a position in which 
to fight a battle to cover Alexandria should it be attacked. I 
found one which satisfies me entirely. I then returned to Fort 
Runyon, near the head of Long Bridge, and reviewed the 2ist 
New York, after which reviewed four batteries of light artillery. 
. . . This morning telegram from other side announcing enemy 
advancing in force. Started off aides and put the wires at work ; 
when fairly started alarm proved false. . . . Friend Beauregard 
has allowed the chance to escape him. I have now some 65,000 
effective men ; will have 75,000 by end of week. Last week he 
certainly had double our force. I feel sure that the dangerous 
moment has passed. 

26/7*. . . . Reviewed Sherman's command (seven regiments) 
near Fort Corcoran ; then McDowell's (eight regiments) at the 
race-course ; then rode to the ground in front of Alexandria 
twelve hours in saddle. 

Aug. 31. Drove out yesterday as far as McCall's camp, and 
to-day down over the river for several hours. Have not yet ven- 



90 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

tured on horseback again ; may try it to-morrow. . . . Our de- 
fences are becoming very strong now, and the army is increas- 
ing in efficiency and numbers quite rapidly. I think Beaure- 
gard has abandoned the idea of crossing the river above us, 
and I learned to-day again that my movements had entirely dis- 
concerted their plans and that they did not know what to do. 
They are suffering much from sickness, and I fancy are not 
in the best possible condition. If they venture to attack us here 
they will have an awful time of it. I do not think they will 
dare to attack. We are now ready for them. The news from 
every quarter to-night is favorable. All goes well. 

Sept. 4, 1 86 1. I took an early dinner, and then mounted the 
bay, Sturgis's horse, and rode to McCall's camp at Tennallytown. 
Sweitzer and Colburn went with me, as usual when hard riding is 
expected ; also the ordinary escort of a sergeant and ten dra- 
goons. . . . Learned that the firing at Great Falls amounted to 
little, and that the orders I had before given to send another regi- 
ment and another battery were sufficient. Then rode to Little 
Falls (Chain Bridge) and went along the whole picket-line. 

Sept. . . . . Had my dinner just after writing the above, 
and then rode to review a brigade and 32 guns away over beyond 
the Capitol. Just as I got through Seth rode up with a message 
to the effect that the enemy were in force near Smith (W. F.) I 
rode rapidly home, changed my horse, and rode out to Smith's 
camp. I determined at once to throw Smith across the river, and 
went over with his brigade myself till I saw him in position, and 
then came back at 1.30 pretty well tired out. 

Sept. 6. Rode along pickets from Corcoran to Chain Bridge. 
Found everything in good condition and ready for a battle. If 
B. attacks now he will inevitably be defeated with terrible loss. 
... I feel now perfectly secure against an attack ; the next thing 
will be to attack him. 

Sept. 8. What a shame that any one should spread such a 
wicked rumor in regard to my being killed ! I beg to assure you 
that I have not been killed a single time since I reached Wash- 
ington. So don't believe any such absurd rumors. How lucky 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 9! 

that you did not hear the report until after you received the tele- 
gram! I had another bouquet this morning, one from the " Lady 
President." Mr. Lincoln came this morning to ask me to par- 
don a man that I had ordered to be shot, suggesting that I could 
give as a reason in the order that it was by request of the " Lady 
President." 

Sept. . Inspected works from Corcoran to Albany ; re- 
viewed McDowell's division and another brigade ; condition of 
troops excellent. Received proceedings of court-martial sentenc- 
ing a dozen men to death ; too severe and unjust. 

Sept. 27. ... He (the President) sent a carriage for me to 
meet him and the cabinet at Gen. Scott's office. Before we got 
through the general "raised a row with me." I kept cool. In 
the course of the conversation he very strongly intimated that we 
were no longer friends. I said nothing, merely looked at him 
and bowed. He tried to avoid me when we left, but I walked 
square up to him, looked him fully in the eye, extended my hand, 
and said, " Good-morning, Gen. Scott." He had to take my hand, 
and so we parted. As he threw down the glove and I took it up, 
I presume war is declared. So be it. I have one strong point 
that I do not care one iota for my present position. 

Sept. . I started early in the day to be present at the pre- 
sentation of colors to McCall's division by Gov. Curtin. It was 
long and fatiguing. I then rode over the Chain Bridge and back 
by Fort Corcoran. When I returned I had a great deal of tedious 
work to do and fell asleep in the midst of it. This morning I 
have had a siege with the Sanitary Committee, and don't think I 
will ride out to-day. How did you learn that Buckner and Smith 
have joined the rebel army ? I can hardly believe it. You have 
no idea how the men brighten up now when I go among them. 
I can see every eye glisten. Yesterday they nearly pulled me to 
pieces in one regiment. You never heard such yelling. Did I 
tell you that Lawrence Williams has been promoted and leaves 
my staff ? I do not in the least doubt his loyalty. I enclose a 
card just received from "A. Lincoln" ; it shows too much defer- 
ence to be seen outside. 

No date. The enemy were stampeded this morning, and while 



92 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

they were in terror I rapidly occupied all their positions and had 
the satisfaction of going out with our advance and seeing the last 
of their cavalry. 

No date (Sept. 30 ?) A most unhappy thing occurred last, 
night among some of W. F. Smith's raw regiments. They three 
times mistook each other for the enemy and fired into each 
other. At least six were killed and several wounded, besides two 
horses were killed. It is dangerous to make night-marches on 
that account ; but Smith's march was delayed by causes I could 
not foresee, and it was necessary to advance at all hazards. The 
manoeuvring in advance by our flanks alarmed the enemy, whose' 
centre at Munson's and Upton's was much advanced. As soon 
as our pickets informed me that he had fallen back I rushed for- 
ward and seized those very important points. We now hold them 
in strength and have at once proceeded to fortify them. The 
moral effect of this advance will be great, and it will have a bad 
influence on the troops of the enemy. They can no longer say 
that they are flaunting their dirty little flag in my face, and I hope 
they have taken their last look at Washington. . . . 



CHAPTER VI. 

The defence of Washington Growth of an army Foresight of the magni- 
tude of the war Memorandum to the President Letter to Secretary 
Cameron. 

REFERENCE to any good map will show that Washington is 
situated on the point of confluence of the main Potomac with the 
Anacostia, or eastern branch thereof. The ground occupied by 
the city is low, though by no means flat, and is commanded from 
all directions by heights within the easy range of even modern 
field-artillery. 

Moral and political considerations alike rendered it necessary 
to retain the seat of government in Washington, although its 
situation was the most unfavorable that could be conceived 
under the circumstances of the case. So far as military opera- 
tions were concerned, it would have been well could the capi- 
tal have been removed to New York ; but this was impossible. 
The defence of the capital, containing, as it did, the execu- 
tive and legislative, the archives of the government, the public 
buildings, the honor and prestige of the nation, and, as time 
moved on, vast amounts of military supplies, was a matter of 
vital importance, and it was necessary to protect it not only 
from capture, but also against insult. To accomplish this with- 
out fortifications would have required an army of great strength, 
so large as to detract fatally from the efficiency of the active 
armies. It was, therefore, absolutely necessary to resort to for- 
tifications, and circumstances required that they should be of a 
temporary nature. 

As I have already stated, I found the capital entirely de- 
fenceless, and at once determined upon the system to be pur- 
sued. 

During the months of August and September the work of 
organization and fortification proceeded as rapidly as circum- 
stances permitted. Naturally there were frequent reports as to 
the movements of the enemy in advance ; sometimes of intended 

93 



94 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

crossings below Alexandria, sometimes above the city. In the 
early part of August, when we were so entirely open to attack, 
these reports gave me no little uneasiness. And even after we 
had reached a point of comparative security, so far as the safety 
of Washington was concerned, the probable effects of an inroad- 
in any form into Maryland rendered it necessary to be constant- 
ly on the alert and take every precaution to prevent a crossing 
of the river. As soon as Gen. Banks came under my command, 
Aug. 20, 1 86 1, I directed him to cross to the eastern bank of 
the Monocacy, leaving one regiment to observe the Potomac 
above Harper's Ferry, and another to watch it from the latter 
place to the mouth of the Monocacy, and to put his main body 
not far from Hyattstown ; thus placing him in position to oppose 
any attempt at crossing the river above Harper's Ferry, while his 
junction with the force at Washington would be secure of the ene- 
my's crossing below the Monocacy. In his former position, at 
Sandy Hook, he was too far from Washington. He was ordered 
to move his surplus and heavy stores from Frederick to Balti- 
more or Washington, and his surplus transportation to the latter 
place ; to oppose any passage of the Potomac by the enemy, pro- 
vided it would not involve his separation from the main army ; 
also to support Stone when necessary, and, if forced back by 
superior numbers, to retreat on Rockville. He was also in- 
structed to protect the railroad as well as practicable without 
making too heavy detachments. 

Up to this period, and until about the beginning of Septem- 
ber, there was reason to apprehend some attack of the enemy ; 
at all events, reports to that effect frequently arrived, and we 
were not for some time in condition to offer successful resist- 
ance. 

It must never be forgotten that at this period the spirit of 
secession was active and bitter in many parts of Maryland. 
Baltimore had given too full proof of the feeling of a large 
part of its inhabitants of all classes ; in the northern and west- 
ern counties there were many secessionists, though the Union 
party was also strong ; but in the southern and southeastern 
counties the Union people were very few. In this condition 
of affairs, with our communications and lines of supply all pass- 
ing through Maryland, it was too dangerous to even allow small 
portions of the enemy to cross the river, and it was therefore 



POSITION OF FORCES. 95 

necessary to employ much larger numbers of troops on the fron- 
tier, on the line of communication, and in observation through 
the State than would have been the case if Pennsylvania, for 
example, had been the frontier State. 

Before the middle of August Gen. Smith's pickets were thrown 
across the river at the Chain Bridge. On the 3d of Sept., while 
reviewing troops east of the Capitol, I received despatches to 
the effect that the enemy had appeared in force opposite the 
Chain Bridge and towards Great Falls ; also that they were pro- 
bably on the point of advancing along their whole line. After 
giving the necessary orders at other points I rode to Gen. 
Smith's headquarters at the Chain Bridge, and determined to 
move his brigade across the river during the night and to en- 
trench a position on the Virginia side as the surest method of 
saving the bridge. I ordered up King's brigade and a battery 
to support him, and directed the cavalry and reserve artillery 
and other troops in the city to be held in readiness to move 
up if necessary. McCall was also ordered to send an addi- 
tional regiment and two more guns to Great Falls, and to hold 
the rest of his command in readiness to move either towards 
Great Falls or the Chain Bridge, as circumstances might require. 
Early during the night Smith crossed and at once commenced 
the construction of Forts Maury and Ethan Allen positions 
which I had already examined. 

On the 28th of Sept. Smith's division marched out to Falls 
Church, which movement, in connection with an advance of a 
part of Franklin's division on the Leesburg pike, of McDowell's 
on Ball's cross-roads and Upton's Hill, and of Porter's on Hall's 
Hill, determined the evacuation of Munson's, Upton's, and Tay- 
lor's hills by the enemy's outposts, who had now seen the last of 
Washington until Early's raid in 1864. 

Taylor's, Perkins's, Upton's, and Munson's hills were occupied 
by a brigade of McDowell's division, who at once commenced 
work upon the necessary fortifications. The occupation of this 
point was of great importance, as it gave ample room in rear for 
moving the troops in any direction, and, in the event of my decid- 
ing to attack Centreville, would enable me to reach that place in 
one march from the outposts. Immediately after the occupation 
of this new position the camp of Porter's division was moved 
forward to Hall's and Munson's hills, in easy supporting dis- 



96 McCLELLAN^ S OWN STORY. 

tance ; a few days later Smith's division was moved to Marshall's 
Hill. To support this movement McCall's division was, on the 
9th of Oct., brought to the Virginia side to Langley's, and a few 
days later to Prospect Hill. He was replaced at Tennallytown 
by a brigade of Buell's division. 

On the 5th of Oct. Heintzelman's division was formed, and 
posted at Fort Lyon, south of Alexandria, forming the left of 
our line on the Virginia side. During the months of September 
and October Sickles's brigade, posted on the south side of the 
eastern branch, sent frequent reconnoissances into lower Mary- 
land. 

Early in November Hooker's division was organized and 
moved to the vicinity of Budd's Ferry to observe the enemy, 
who were active in that direction, and to prevent, as far as 
possible, the crossing of the river by emissaries of the enemy. 
So that early in November the positions of the command were 
as follows : 

On the right McCall's division at Prospect Hill ; Smith's 
division at Mackall's Hill, holding Lewinsville by an advanced 
guard ; Porter's division at Minor's and Hall's hills ; McDowell 
at Arlington, with one brigade at Munson's Hill, etc.; Blenker's 
division at Hunter's Chapel ; Franklin at the Theological Semi- 
nary ; Heintzelman at Fort Lyon. There were thus on the Vir- 
ginia side seven divisions, so posted as to cover every avenue of 
approach, and able to afford assistance to every point that could 
be attacked, and, moreover, in position to advance on Centre- 
ville if necessary. On the north of Washington, Buell's division 
held Tennallytown and the other important points (supported 
by Casey's provisional brigades), the reserve artillery and the 
cavalry depots ; while Stone's division at Poolesville, and Banks's 
division at Darnestown, observed the upper river and were in 
position to retire upon Washington if attacked by superior forces. 
Hooker was in the vicinity of Budd's Ferry. By the 3oth of 
Sept. several of the principal works were pretty well advanced, 
but a great deal still remained to be done to complete the 
system. 

I shall refer elsewhere to the inconveniences resulting from 
the position of Washington and the nature of the frontier formed 
by the Potomac ; in this place it will suffice to say that as the 
Potomac is often fordable, and many of the inhabitants on the 



THE REGULAR ARMY. 97 

Maryland side were favorable to the enemy, it was a very neces- 
sary and difficult task to guard it properly. 

In view of its exposed position and immense political import- 
ance it was impossible to allow Washington to be endangered ; 
so that a garrison was always necessary, and all that could be 
done was to make the fortifications so strong that a compara- 
tively small garrison would suffice. After the experience of the 
first Bull Run the executive would never consent to leave Wash- 
ington without a large garrison. 

At this juncture it would have been wise to adopt a definite 
policy with regard to the regular army viz., either virtually 
break it up, as a temporary measure, and distribute its members 
among the staff and regiments of the volunteer organization, thus 
giving the volunteers all possible benefit from the discipline and 
instruction of the regulars, or to fill the regular regiments to their 
full capacity and employ them as a reserve at critical junctures. 
I could not secure the adoption of either plan, and a middle 
course was followed which resulted less favorably than either of 
the plans indicated ; but it must be said that, even as things were, 
the regulars were in every way of immense benefit to the service. 
As a general rule the officers (and, of course, the non-commis- 
sioned officers) of the volunteer regiments were entirely ignorant 
of their duties, and many were unfitted, from their education, 
moral character, or mental deficiences, for ever acquiring the 
requisite efficiency. 

These latter were weeded out by courts-martial and boards 
of examination, while the others were instructed part passu as 
they instructed their men. The small number of regular officers 
available rendered it impossible to furnish all the staff officers 
from among them ; so that a regiment was very fortunate if its 
colonel was a regular officer, and a brigade was lucky to have 
a regular as its commander. The generals were usually, and 
colonels always, obliged to appoint their staff officers from civil 
life, and instruct them as best they could. It speaks wonders for 
the intelligence and military aptitude of our people that so much 
was well done in this way on both sides. Many of these raw 
civilians, who were men of pride, intelligence, and education, soon 
became excellent officers ; though these very men most keenly 
regretted their lack of a good military education in early life. 

The frequent reviews I held at Washington were not at all for 



98 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

the benefit of the public, nor yet for the purpose of examining 
the individual condition of the men, although I did much of that 
even on these occasions for a general with a quick eye can see 
things when riding at a gallop which would seem impossible to 
a civilian. But they were to accustom the regiments to move- 
together and see each other, to give the troops an idea of their 
own strength, to infuse esprit de corps and mutual emulation, 
and to acquaint myself with the capacity of the general officers. 
These reviews also had a good effect in accustoming the troops 
to see me, although they saw so much of me in their camps and 
on the picket-lines that this was of minor importance. With new 
troops frequent reviews are of the greatest utility and produce 
the most excellent effect. Those I held did much towards mak- 
ing the Army of the Potomac what it became. 

Some persons, who ought to have known better, have sup- 
posed that in organizing the Army of the Potomac I set too 
high a model before me and consumed unnecessary time in striv- 
ing to form an army of regulars. This was an unjustifiable error 
on their part. I should, of course, have been glad to bring that 
army to the condition of regulars, but no one knew better than 
myself that, with the means at my command, that would have 
been impossible within any reasonable or permissible time. 

What I strove for and accomplished was to bring about such 
a condition of discipline and instruction that the army could be 
handled on the march and on the field of battle, and that orders 
could be reasonably well carried out. No one cognizant of the 
circumstances and possessed of any knowledge of military affairs 
can honestly believe that I bestowed unnecessary time and labor 
upon the organization and instruction of that army whose cour- 
age, discipline, and efficiency finally brought the war to a close. 

In spite of all the clamor to the contrary, the time spent in the 
camps of instruction in front of Washington was well bestowed, 
and produced the most important and valuable results. Not a 
day of it was wasted. The fortifications then erected, both di- 
rectly and indirectly, saved the capital more than once in the 
course of the war, and enabled the army to manoeuvre freely and 
independently. The organization and discipline then acquired, 
and so much improved during the campaign of the Peninsula 
which converted the men into veterans, enabled the army to pass 
gloriously through the many sanguinary conflicts and harassing 



MUTINY. 99 

campaigns that proved necessary to terminate the war. They 
learned to gain victories and to withstand defeat. No other army 
we possessed could have met and defeated the Confederate Army 
of Northern Virginia. And, with all the courage, energy, and 
intelligence of the Army of the Potomac, it probably would not 
have been equal to that most difficult task without the advantage 
it enjoyed during its sojourn in the camps around Washington. 
Early in August more or less trouble and discontent appeared 
among some of the regiments in relation to their term of service. 
In fact, many of those who enlisted during the first excitement 
had no expectation of engaging for a long war, and, when they 
found the three-months regiments returning home in large num- 
bers, became much dissatisfied. In two cases this culminated 
in open mutiny on the part of large numbers of the officers and 
men. In the case of one regiment I brought them to order by 
directing the transportation of sixty-three of the number as pri- 
soners to the Dry Tortugas, to labor there during the remainder 
of the war. In the case of the other the following order was 
issued : 

Special Order No. 27. 

HEADQUARTERS, DIVISION OF THE POTOMAC, 

WASHINGTON, Aug. 14, 1861. 

The general commanding this division learns with the utmost 
pain that decided insubordination, if not open mutiny, has been 
displayed by a large portion of the 79th regiment of N. Y. 
Volunteers. The general commanding does not desire, at this 
time, to enter into any statement of the alleged grievances of this 
regiment, further than to say that he has examined into them 
and finds that they are frivolous and unfounded. This conduct 
is disgraceful in the extreme, both as soldiers and citizens, to all 
concerned in it. Those who have participated in this shameful 
affair have utterly disgraced themselves ; they are unworthy of 
the sympathy of their fellow-soldiers, and in acting such a part 
at a time when the services of every true man are required by the 
nation they have rendered themselves liable to the suspicion that 
motives of the basest cowardice have controlled their conduct. 
This regiment has chosen to make the issue, and the command- 
ing general is prepared to meet it. The regiment is ordered to 
return at once to its duty. All members of the regiment, whether 
officers or privates, who do not forthwith, on this order being 
read to them, return to duty will be required to lay down their 
arms and will be placed in arrest, and, refusing to do so, they 



IOO McCLELLAN'S OWN STuRY. 

will be fired upon. Of those who obey the order and return to 
their duty the mutinous ringleaders will alone be punished. 

The regiment will be deprived of its colors, which will not 
be returned until its members have shown by their conduct in 
camp that they have learned the first duty of soldiers obe- 
dience and have proved on the field of battle that they are not 
wanting in courage. A copy of this order, with the names of the 
officers and men implicated, will be sent to the governor of New 
York, to be filed among the State archives. 

(Signed) GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

The execution of this order was entrusted to Col. A. Porter, 
who took with him a battalion, a squadron, and a battery of 
regulars. They were drawn up in front of the mutineers, who 
promptly submitted. The ringleaders were placed in irons and 
the rest marched over to the Virginia side. In the course of a 
couple of months I was able to return their colors to this regi- 
ment as a reward for good conduct in camp and in several skir- 
mishes. The regiment afterwards accompanied Sherman's expe- 
dition to Carolina and did good service. I think the trouble 
arose rather from poor officers than from the men. 

As an additional means of preserving discipline, and to guard 
the camps from the presence of spies, the following order was 
issued : 

General Order No. 4. 

HEADQUARTERS, DIVISION OF THE POTOMAC, 
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16, 1861. 

All passes, safe-conducts, and permits heretofore given to 
enter or go beyond the lines of the United States army on the 
Virginia side of the Potomac are to be deemed revoked, and 
all such passes will emanate only from the War Department, the 
headquarters of the United States army or of this division, or 
from the provost-marshal at Washington. Similar passes will 
be required to cross the river by bridge or boat into Virginia. 
A strict military surveillance will be exercised within the lines 
of the army on the northern side of the Potomac, and upon 
all the avenues of every kind, by land and water, leading to and 
from the city of Washington, as well over persons holding passes 
as all others. Passes will not be required at or within the lines 
of the army north of the Potomac, but disloyal or suspected per- 
sons will be liable to arrest and detention until discharged by 
competent authority ; and contraband articles will be seized. 

Officers and soldiers of the army will obtain passes as here- 



MEMORANDUM. 1OI 

tofore ordered. All complaints of improper seizures or searches 
made, or purporting to be made, under military authority will be 
received by the proper brigade commanders or provost-marshals, 
who will at once investigate the same, and in each instance make 
report to these headquarters. 

By command of Maj.-Gen. McClellan. 

(Signed) S. WILLIAMS, 

Asst. Adjt.-Gen. 

In describing the steps taken toward the creation of the Army 
of the Potomac it will be well to begin with the Memorandum of 
A.ug. 2, 1861, submitted to the President at his request. In my 
Report the date is erroneously given as of the 4th. This paper 
was necessarily prepared in great haste, as my time was fully oc- 
cupied both by day and night with the incessant labors incident 
to my assumption of the command and the dangerous condition 
of affairs. 

MEMORANDUM. 

The object of the present war differs from those in which 
nations are usually engaged, mainly in this : that the purpose of 
ordinary war is to conquer a peace and make a treaty on advan- 
tageous terms ; in this contest it has become necessary to crush 
a population sufficiently numerous, intelligent, and warlike to 
constitute a nation. We have not only to defeat their armed 
and organized forces in the field, but to display such an over- 
whelming strength as will convince all our antagonists, especially 
those of the governing, aristocratic class, of the utter impossibil- 
ity of resistance. Our late reverses make this course imperative. 
Had we been successful in the recent battle (Manassas) it is pos- 
sible that we might have been spared the labor and expense of a 
great effort ; now we have no alternative. Their success will 
enable the political leaders of the rebels to convince the mass of 
their people that we are inferior to them in force and courage, 
and to command all their resources. The contest began with a 
class, now it is with a people ; our military success can alone 
restore the former issue. 

By thoroughly defeating their armies, taking their strong 
places, and pursuing a rigidly protective policy as to private 
property and unarmed persons, and a lenient course as to pri- 
vate soldiers, we may well hope for a permanent restoration of a 
peaceful Union. But in the first instance the authority of the 
government must be supported by overwhelming physical force. 

Our foreign relations and financial credit also imperatively 
demand that the military action of the government should be 
prompt and irresistible. 



IO2 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

The rebels have chosen Virginia as their battle-field, and it 
seems proper for us to make the first great struggle there. But 
while thus directing our main efforts, it is necessary to diminish 
the resistance there offered us by movements on other points 
both by land and water. 

Without entering at present into details, I would advise that 
a strong movement be made on the Mississippi, and that the 
rebels be driven out of Missouri. 

As soon as it becomes perfectly clear that Kentucky is cor- 
dially united with us, I would advise a movement through that 
State into Eastern Tennessee for the purpose of assisting the 
Union men of that region and of seizing the railroads leading 
from Memphis to the East. 

The possession of those roads by us, in connection with the 
movement on the Mississippi, would go far towards determining 
the evacuation of Virginia by the rebels. In the meantime all 
the passes into Western Virginia from the East should be securely 
guarded, but I would advise no movement from that quarter 
towards Richmond, unless the political condition of Kentucky 
renders it impossible or inexpedient for us to make the move- 
ment upon Eastern Tennessee through that State. Every effort 
should, however, be made to organize^ equip, and arm as many 
troops as possible in Western Virginia, in order to render the 
Ohio and Indiana regiments available for other operations. 

At as early a day as practicable it would be well to protect 
and reopen the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Baltimore and 
Fort Monroe should be occupied by garrisons sufficient to retain 
them in our possession. 

The importance of Harper's Ferry and the line of the Poto- 
mac in the direction of Leesburg will be very materially dimin- 
ished so soon as our force in this vicinity becomes organized, 
strong, and efficient, because no capable general will cross the 
river north of this city when we have a strong army here ready 
to cut off his retreat. 

To revert to the West, it is probable that no very large addi- 
tions to the troops now in Missouri will be necessary to secure 
that State. 

I presume that the force required for the movement down the 
Mississippi will be determined by its commander and the Presi- 
dent. If Kentucky assumes the right position not more than 
20,000 will be needed, together with those that can be raised in 
that State and Eastern Tennessee to secure the latter region and 
its railroads, as well as ultimately to occupy Nashville. 

The Western Virginia troops, with not more than five to ten 
thousand from Ohio and Indiana, should, under proper manage- 
ment, suffice for its protection. 

When we have reorganized our main army here 10,000 men 
ought to be enough to protect the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad 



MEMORANDUM. 1 03 

and the Potomac ; 5,000 will garrison Baltimore, 3,000 Fort 
Monroe, and not more than 20,000 will be necessary at the 
utmost for the defence of Washington. 

For the main army of operations I urge the following com- 
position : 

250 regiments of infantry, say, .... 225,000 men. 

100 field-batteries, 600 guns, .... 15,000 

28 regiments of cavalry, ..... 25,500 

5 regiments engineer troops, . . . . 7>5oo 

Total, 273,000 " 

The force must be supplied with the necessary engineer and 
pontoon trains, and with transportation for everything save tents. 
Its general line of operations should be so directed that water- 
transportation can be availed of from point to point by means of 
the ocean and the rivers emptying into it. An essential feature 
of the plan of operations will be the employment of a strong 
naval force to protect the movement of a fleet of transports 
intended to convey a considerable body of troops from point 
to point of the enemy's sea-coast, thus either creating diver- 
sions and rendering it necessary for them to detach largely from 
their main body in order to protect such of their cities as may 
be threatened, or else landing and forming establishments on 
their coast at any favorable places that opportunity might offer. 
This naval force should. also co-operate with the main army in 
its efforts to seize the important seaboard towns of the rebels. 

It cannot be ignored that the construction of railroads has 
introduced a new and very important element into war, by the 
great facilities thus given for concentrating at particular posi- 
tions large masses of troops from remote sections, and by creat- 
ing new strategic points and lines of operations. 

It is intended to overcome this difficulty by the partial ope- 
rations suggested, and such other as the particular case may 
require. We must endeavor to seize places on the railways in 
the rear of the enemy's points of concentration, and we must 
threaten their seaboard cities, in order that each State may be 
forced, by the necessity of its own defence, to diminish its contin- 
gent to the Confederate army. 

The proposed movement down the Mississippi will produce 
important results in this connection. That advance and the 
progress of the main army at the East will materially assist 
each other by diminishing the resistance to be encountered 
by each. 

The tendency of the Mississippi movement upon all questions 
connected with cotton is too well understood by the President 
and cabinet to need any illustration from me. 

There is another independent movement that has often been 



104 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

suggested and which has always recommended itself to my 
judgment. I refer to a movement from Kansas and Nebraska 
through the Indian Territory upon Red river and Western Texas 
for the purpose of protecting and developing the latent Union 
and free-State sentiment well known to predominate in Western 
Texas, and which, like a similar sentiment in Western Virginia, 
will, if protected, ultimately organize that section into a free 
State. How far it will be possible to support this movement by an 
advance through New Mexico from California is a matter which 
I have not sufficiently examined to be able to express a decided 
opinion. If at all practicable, it is eminently desirable, as bring- 
ing into play the resources and warlike qualities of the Pacific 
States, as well as identifying them with our cause and connecting 
the bond of union between them and the general government. 

If it is not departing too far from my province, I will venture 
to suggest the policy of an ultimate alliance and cordial under- 
standing with Mexico ; their sympathies and interests are with 
us, their antipathies exclusively against our enemies and their 
institutions. I think it would not be difficult to obtain from the 
Mexican government the right to use, at least during the present 
contest, the road from Guaymas to New Mexico ; this conces- 
sion would very materially reduce the obstacles of the column 
moving from the Pacific. A similar permission to use their terri- 
tory for the passage of troops between the Panuco and the Rio 
Grande would enable us to throw a column of troops by a good 
road from Tampico, or some of the small harbors north of it, 
upon and across the Rio Grande, without risk and scarcely firing 
a shot. 

To what extent, if any, it would be desirable to take into ser- 
vice and employ Mexican soldiers is a question entirely political, 
on which I do not venture to offer an opinion. 

The force I have recommended is large ; the expense is great. 
It is possible that a smaller force might accomplish the object in 
view, but I understand it to be the purpose of this great nation to 
re-establish the power of its government and restore peace to its 
citizens in the shortest possible time. 

The question to be decided is simply this : Shall we crush the 
rebellion at one blow, terminate the war in one campaign, or shall 
we leave it as a legacy for our descendants ? 

When the extent of the possible line of operations is con- 
sidered, the force asked for for the main army under my com- 
mand cannot be regarded as unduly large ; every mile we 
advance carries us further from our base of operations and 
renders detachments necessary to cover our communications, 
while the enemy will be constantly concentrating as he falls 
back. I propose, with the force which I have requested, not 
only to drive the enemy out of Virginia and occupy Richmond, 
but to occupy Charleston, Savannah, Montgomery, Pensacola, 



RETROSPECTIVE. 105 

Mobile, and New Orleans ; in other words, to move into the 
heart of the enemy's country and crush the rebellion in its 
very heart. 

By seizing and repairing the railroads as we advance the diffi- 
culties of transportation will be materially diminished. It is per- 
haps unnecessary to state that, in addition to the forces named in 
this memorandum, strong reserves should be formed, ready to 
supply any losses that may occur. 

In conclusion, I would submit that the exigencies of the 
treasury may be lessened by making only partial payments to 
our troops when in the enemy's country, and by giving the obli- 
gations of the United States for such supplies as may there be 
obtained. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. 

In the light of the experience of the twenty-two years which 
have elapsed since this Memorandum was so hastily prepared, 
and after full consideration of all the events of the long and 
bloody war which followed it, I still hold to the soundness of the 
views it expressed. Had the measures recommended been car- 
ried into effect the war would have been closed in less than one- 
half the time and with infinite saving of blood and treasure. So 
far as I know, it was the first general plan of operations proposed 
upon a scale adequate to the case. It recognized the importance 
of railways as a new element in strategy ; it emphasized the vital 
importance of the railway system leading from Memphis to the 
East ; it marked out the advantages to be derived from coast 
expeditions ; it stated the part to be played upon the Mississippi ; 
it foreshadowed the marches upon Atlanta and the sea-coast ; it 
called for a force which the future proved to be fully within our 
means, and which would have crushed the rebellion in one or two 
campaigns. 

In this connection I would refer to the letters written by me 
to Gen. Scott from Columbus in April and May of 1861. 

The following was received Sept. 7 and answered Sept. 8 : 

" GENERAL : It is evident that we are or* the eve of a great 
battle one that may decide the fate of the country. Its success 
must depend on you and the means that may be placed at your 
disposal. Impressed with this belief, and anxious to aid you 
with all the power of my department, I will be glad if you will 
inform me how I can do so. Very truly yours, 

" yth Sept., 1861. SIMON CAMERON. 

" MAJ.-GEN. MCCLELLAN.'* 



io6 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 8, 1861. 

Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War : 

SIR : Your note of to-day is received. I concur in your 
views as to the exigency of the present occasion. I appreciate 
and cordially thank you for your offers of support, and will avail 
myself of them to the fullest extent demanded by the interests of 
the country. The force of all arms within the immediate vicinity 
of Washington is nearly 85,000 men. The effective portion of 
this force is more than sufficient to resist with certain success any 
attacks on our works upon the other side of the river. By calling 
in the commands of Gens. Banks and Stone it will probably be 
sufficient to defend the city of Washington from whatever direc- 
tion it may be assailed. It is well understood that, although the 
ultimate design of the enemy is to possess himself of the city of 
Washington, his first efforts will be directed towards Baltimore, 
with the intention of cutting our line of communication and sup- 
plies, as well as to arouse an insurrection in Maryland. To 
accomplish this he will no doubt show a certain portion of his 
force in front of our positions on the other side of the Potomac, 
in order to engage our attention there and induce us to leave a 
large portion of our force for the defence of those positions. He 
will probably also make demonstrations in the vicinity of Acquia 
Creek, Mathias Point, and the Occoquan, in order still further to 
induce us to disseminate our forces. His main and real move- 
ment will doubtless be to cross the Potomac between Washington 
and Point of Rocks, probably not far from Seneca Mills, and most 
likely at more points than one. His hope will be so to engage 
our attention by the diversions already named as to enable him 
to move with a large force direct and unopposed on Baltimore. 
I see no reason to doubt the possibility of his attempting this 
with a column of at least 100,000 effective troops. If he has only 
130,000 under arms, he can make all the diversions I have men- 
tioned with his raw and badly organized troops, leaving 100,000 
effective men for his real movement. As I am now situated I 
can by no possibility bring to bear against this column more than 
70,000, and probably not over 60,000, effective troops. 

In regard to the composition of our active army, it must be 
borne in mind that the very important arms of cavalry and artil- 
lery had been almost entirely neglected until I assumed command 
of this army, and that consequently the troops of these arms, 
although greatly increased in numbers, are comparatively raw 
and inexperienced, most of the cavalry not being yet armed or 
equipped. In making the foregoing estimate of numbers I have 
reduced the enemy's force below what is regarded by the War 
Department and other official circles as its real strength, and 
have taken the reverse course as to our own. Our situation. 



LETTER TO MR. CAMERON. 

then, is simply this : if the commander-in-chief of the enemy 
follows the simplest dictates of the military art we must meet 
him with greatly inferior forces. To render success possible the 
divisions of our army must be more ably led and commanded 
than those of the enemy. The fate of the nation and the suc- 
cess of the cause in which we are engaged must be mainly 
decided by the issue of the next battle to be fought by the 
army now under my command. I therefore feel that the inte- 
rests of the nation demand that the ablest soldiers in the service 
should be on duty with the Army of the Potomac, and that, con- 
tenting ourselves with remaining on the defensive for the present 
at all other points, this army should at once be reinforced by 
all the effective troops that the East and West and North can 
furnish. In view of these facts I respectfully urge that all the 
available troops in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and at 
least ten thousand Illinois troops (there being fifteen thousand 
there unarmed), and all those of the Eastern and Northern States, 
be at once directed to report to me for duty. I beg leave to 
repeat the opinion I have heretofore expressed : that the Army 
of the Potomac should number not less than three hundred thou- 
sand men in order to insure complete success and an early termi- 
nation of the war. I also request that Brig.-Gens. Don Carlos 
Buell and J. F. Reynolds both appointed upon my recommenda- 
tion and for the purpose of serving with me be at once assigned 
to duty with this army ; also that no general officer appointed 
upon my recommendation shall be assigned away from this army 
without my consent ; that I shall have full control of all officers 
and troops within this department.; and that no one, whatever 
his rank may be, shall give any orders respecting my command 
without my being first consulted. Otherwise it is evident that 
I cannot be responsible for the success of our arms. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. U. S. A. 



CHAPTER VII. 

Organization of the army What an army is Infantry, artillery, cavalry, 
engineer troops The staff and its departments Details of the crea- 
tion of the Army of the Potomac. 

THE organized armies of modern times consist of two well- 
defined parts : the fighting force, or " line," and " the staff," 
which directs, inspects, and supplies the former. The line is 
made up of infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineer troops. 

As INFANTRY can move wherever a man can set his foot, can 
fight on all kinds of ground, gives the most destructive fire of all 
the arms, and is the least expensive and most easily instructed, 
it constitutes the great bulk of all large armies, and is decidedly 
the most important. 

With equally good generals, that army which has the best 
infantry is pretty sure to win, for no reasonable superiority in 
the other arms of service can compensate for marked inferiority 
in the infantry. 

The essential qualities of good infantry are : the ability to 
make long marches, with their full equipment, without strag- 
gling ; accuracy of fire ; confidence in their ability to use the 
bayonet for this will prevent their breaking upon the very near 
approach of a hostile line coolness, intelligence, determination, 
and mutual confidence in attacking or receiving an attack ; the 
ability to reform rapidly after a successful attack, and to rally 
when driven back, either after a repulsed attack or when obliged 
to retreat from a defensive position ; the power of enduring fa- 
tigue, exposure, and hunger. 

Next in importance is the ARTILLERY, whose work it is to 
open the way for, and cover the movements of, the other arms by 
destroying the enemy's defences at long range, silencing his artil- 
lery, and demoralizing his infantry ; or, at short ranges, to crush 
them by a rapid fire of case and shrapnel. It is also a part of its* 
duty to cover the retreat of beaten infantry, and to assist in the 
operations of detached bodies of cavalry. 

108 



ARMY ORGANIZATION. 

There is thus heavy artillery, whose business it is to handle 
siege-guns and those used in permanent defences, and field-artil- 
lery, who accompany an army in the field. Field-artillery is 
made up of three kinds viz., the mounted batteries, whose can- 
noneers usually march on foot, but during rapid movements ride 
upon the carriages and caissons, and which serve with the regi- 
ment, division, and army corps ; the horse-batteries, whose can- 
noneers are provided with saddle-horses, and which are especially 
intended for service with the cavalry ; and the batteries of posi- 
tion, consisting of the heaviest field-guns, intended especially for 
action against the enemy's material defences. 

The field-guns, at the period of which I write, were generally 
provided in the ratio of at least two and a half guns to each 
thousand infantry, and three or four guns to each thousand 
cavalry, the exact proportion depending somewhat on the na- 
ture of the field of war and the quality of the troops. With 
raw troops a somewhat larger proportion is necessary than with 
veterans. 

The technical information necessary for the artillery officers 
and men renders it difficult to improvise thoroughly efficient 
artillery. 

The CAVALRY is an indispensable part of every army. It not 
only takes part, as occasion demands, in general battles, but, with 
a due proportion of horse-artillery, is capable of independent 
action, even at long distances from the main body of the army. 
Upon it devolves to a great extent the duty of observing and dis- 
covering the positions, movements, and strength of the enemy, as 
well as masking those of its own army. It is capable of making 
extensive inroads into the enemy's country, and is usually em- 
ployed to threaten and attack his communications, supply-trains, 
etc. The modern improvements in firearms have certainly af- 
fected the employment of cavalry on the field of battle against 
infantry and artillery, but have not lessened the importance of its 
other duties. Nor is it probable that the number of these arms 
will in the future be materially diminished. The employment of 
breech-loading small arms has added very much to the strength 
of cavalry, and it is certain that in future wars large bodies of 
cavalry will be employed as mounted infantry. That is, they will 
use their horses to move rapidly to the point of action, and fight 
on foot. Under ordinary circumstances it has usually been re- 



IIO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

garded as advisable to furnish" cavalry to the extent of one-sixth 
to one-eighth of the infantry force. 

To render cavalry efficient it is necessary that the officers and 
men should be of a superior order of intelligence, and that they 
should fully understand the care of their horses, which should 
be active and enduring. Officers and men should be excellent 
horsemen, skilful in the use of their weapons, and thoroughly 
instructed in the work of reconnoissance. It is really much 
more difficult to form reliable cavalry at short notice than to 
instruct artillery and infantry. 

It is the duty of ENGINEER TROOPS to conduct siege opera- 
tions ; to supervise and construct temporary defences and the 
works for their attack ; to construct, repair, and destroy bridges 
of all kinds, fords, roads, etc. The repair and destruction of rail- 
ways should also be under their direction. The performance of 
these duties requires a superior order of men, skilled in some 
mechanical trade, and needs careful instruction. In ordinary 
cases the engineer troops should number about one-fortieth of 
the infantry. 

To direct the movements and supply the wants of the com- 
batants is the business of THE STAFF, which in modern armies is 
a complicated and extensive organization. It includes : 

\st. The Adjutant- General 's Department. 

This department issues, in the name of the commander, all 
orders relating to the discipline, instruction, movements, and 
supply of the troops, whether directly to the fighting organiza- 
tion or to the other staff corps ; and through it pass to the 
commander all written reports on such subjects. It has direct 
charge of all returns relating to the force and condition of the 
command, and to it all such returns are directed. 

zd. The Inspector-General's Department. 

To this department is committed the work of ascertaining by 
rigid and careful inspection the exact condition of the various 
elements comprising the command; verifying returns and re- 
ports ; ascertaining the exact state of discipline, instruction, 
morale, and general efficiency ; the number present for duty ; 
the observation of sanitary rules ; the quantity and condition 
of transportation, arms, ammunition, equipment, clothing, food, 



ARMY ORGANIZATION. Ill 

medical stores, etc. As so much depends upon the faithful and 
intelligent discharge of these very important duties, it is abso- 
lutely necessary that the officers of this corps should be tho- 
roughly instructed soldiers of long experience, the highest integ- 
rity, the greatest intelligence, with great industry and method in 
the performance of these duties. 

$d. Aides-de-Camp. 

These constitute the personal staff of the general to whom 
they are attached. They carry his orders and watch over their 
execution. They should be thorough soldiers, of great activity, 
intelligence, and devotion. 

4//z. The Engineers. 

In our service the conduct of reconnoissances falls chiefly 
upon them ; the selection of positions, especially for defence ; 
the conduct of all siege operations, and the construction of all 
field-works, temporary defences, bridges, roads, etc. 

On the part of these officers the most thorough knowledge of 
the highest branches of the profession, accurate judgment of 
ground, and great intelligence are required. They cannot suc- 
cessfully be improvised. 

$th. The Quartermaster s Department. 

Upon this department devolves the purchase of horses for all 
military purposes, the providing of all means of transportation, 
ambulances, litters, the supply of clothing, camp equipage, cook- 
ing utensils, the forage for animals, the conduct of supply-trains, 
and, in fact, providing all material that is not especially assigned 
to some other department. 

6th. The Commissary Department. 

It is the duty of this department to provide and have ready 
for issue at the proper time and place all articles of food required 
by the army. The task of this department is often very difficult 
and of the greatest possible importance, for upon its proper per- 
formance the success of the army depends. 

7th. The Medical Department. 
Upon this department devolves the general charge of the 



ii2 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

sanitary condition of troops in camps and on the march ; the 
care of the sick and wounded ; the use of ambulances and lit- 
ters ; the providing of medical stores and comforts ; the installa- 
tion and direction of all military hospitals. 

8t/i. The Ordnance Corps. 

This corps furnishes all arms, ammunition, artillery carriages 
and harness, cavalry equipment, and makes in the field all re- 
pairs which cannot be executed by the armorers and mechanics 
of the regiments of the line. 

gth. The Pay Department. 
Its duty is to pay the troops at proper times. 

loth. The Department of Military Justice. 

It has the supervision of all proceedings by court-martial, 
military commission^ etc. 

nth. The Signal Corps. 

It is in charge of the various systems of communicating 
intelligence by signals, telegraph, balloons, etc. 

In large armies, with numerous staff corps charged with such 
manifold and important duties, it has been found necessary to 
establish the position of CHIEF OF STAFF, who might supervise 
and co-ordinate the various branches, and thus relieve the com- 
manding general from a multiplicity of detail. This office, 
found in all European armies, had never been established in 
our own. I soon found it necessary for v the Army of the Poto- 
mac. The officer holding such a confidential relation with his 
commander should always be a man possessing the latter's entire 
confidence. I therefore selected for this place Col. R. B. Marcy, 
inspector-general of the army, whose rank was also superior to 
that of all the staff officers on duty with the Army of the 
Potomac. 

My orders for the movements and fighting of the troops 
were generally issued through the chief of staff. 

One of my earliest measures was the formation of perma- 
nent BRIGADES of infantry. The new levies of infantry, upon 
their arrival in Washington, were formed into provisional bri- 
gades and placed in camps in the suburbs on the Maryland

side of the river, for equipment, instruction, and discipline. As 
soon as regiments were in fit condition for transfer to the forces 
across the Potomac they were assigned to the brigades serv- 
ing there. Brig.-Gen. F. J. Porter was at first assigned to the 
charge of the provisional brigades. Brig.-Gen. A. E. Burnside 
was the next officer assigned this duty, from which, however, 
he was soon relieved by Brig.-Gen. Casey, who continued in 
charge of the newly arriving regiments until the Army of the Po- 
tomac departed for the Peninsula, in March, 1862. The newly 
arriving artillery troops reported to Brig.-Gen. William F. Bar- 
ry, the chief of artillery, and the cavalry to Brig.-Gen. George 
Stoneman, the chief of cavalry, and were also retained on the 
Maryland side until their equipment and armament were essen- 
tially completed and some rudimentary instruction obtained. 

A few days after reaching Washington Gen. Scott asked 
me what I intended to do in the way of organization. I re- 
plied that I wished the force under my command to be organ- 
ized as and denominated an army instead of a geographical 
division ; that I should first form brigades, then divisions, and, 
when in the field, army corps. My reason for postponing the 
formation of the latter was that with untried general officers it 
would be too dangerous an experiment to appoint any to such 
high and important commands without first proving them in 
actual campaign and in battle. 

He objected to all I proposed, save the brigade formation, 
saying that under our system and regulations it would be im- 
possible to administer the affairs of an "army," and that the 
retention of the system and nomenclature of geographical divi- 
sions and departments was an absolute necessity ; he also object- 
ed to the formation of divisions as unnecessary, for the reason 
that in Mexico he had only brigades. 

I called to his attention the fact that, all the world over, fight- 
ing forces were organized as armies ; that I had done so in West 
Virginia ; and that his force in Mexico was a very small affair 
in comparison with that soon to be collected in front of Wash- 
ington. He did not change his views. So I quietly went to 
work in my own way. The result was that on the 2oth of Aug. 
the order constituting the ARMY OF THE POTOMAC was issued ; 
and in. addition to the two departments originally under my 
command, the troops in the Shenandoah, Maryland, and Dela- 



114 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

ware were also included in the Army of the Potomac, the old 
departments being broken up and merged in the newly created 
army. Thus I had command of all the troops on the line of 
the Potomac and as far to the rear as Baltimore and Fort 
Delaware. 

During the first days of August I procured the passage 
of an act authorizing the appointment of additional aides-de- 
camp to general officers ; these might be taken from civil life 
or from the army, and were to be of no higher grade than that 
of colonel. I used this law not only to furnish the requisite 
number of actual aides-de-camp, but also to give additional 
pay and rank in the regular army to officers whose duty made 
such a step necessary. For instance, I gave to Maj. Barry, chief 
of artillery, and to Maj. H. J. Hunt, commanding the reserve 
artillery, the grade of colonel ; to Van Vliet and Clarke the 
same. When the organization of the brigades was well estab- 
lished, and the troops somewhat disciplined and instructed, 
divisions of three brigades each were gradually formed. 

I intended to compose each division of three infantry bri- 
gades of four regiments each, four batteries, and one regiment 
of cavalry, which would have given a nominal strength of 12,000 
infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 24 guns, or an effective of about 
10,000 infantry, 700 cavalry, and 24 guns. It was determined to 
collect whatever regular infantry could be obtained to form the 
nucleus of a reserve. The measures taken for recruiting these 
regiments were so insufficient and the results so meagre that 
as late as the 3oth of April, 1862, there were only 4,600 men 
in the 71 companies, regular infantry, on duty with the Army 
of the Potomac. These, together with the 5th and loth N. Y. 
Volunteers, finally formed part of the 5th corps as a division 
under Brig.-Gen. Sykes, 3d U. S. Infantry. 

The creation of an adequate ARTILLERY establishment for an 
army of so large proportions was a formidable undertaking ; and 
had it not been that the country possessed in the regular service 
a body of accomplished and energetic artillery officers, the task 
would have been almost hopeless. 

The charge of organizing this most important arm was con- 
fided to Maj. (afterwards Brig.-Gen.) William F. Barry, chief of 
artillery, whose industry and zeal achieved the best results The 
following principles were adopted as the basis of organization : 



ARMY ORGANIZA TION. \ \ 5 

1. That the proportion of artillery should be in the proportion 
of at least two and one-half pieces to 1,000 men, to be expanded, 
if possible, to three pieces to 1,000 men. 

2. That the proportion of rifled guns should be restricted to 
the system of the United States ordnance department ; and of 
Parrott and the " smooth-bores " (with the exception of a few 
howitzers for special service) to be exclusively the i2-pounder 
gun, of the model of 1857, variously called the "gun-howitzer," 
the " light twelve-pounder," or the " Napoleon." 

3. That each field-battery should, if practicable, be composed 
of six guns, and none to be less than four guns, and in all cases 
the guns of each battery should be of uniform calibre. 

4. That the field-batteries were to be assigned to divisions, and 
not to brigades, and in the proportion of four to each division, 
of which one was to be a battery of regulars, the remainder of 
volunteers, the captain of the regular battery to be the com- 
mandant of artillery of the division. In the event of several divi- 
sions constituting an army corps, at least one-half of the divi- 
sional artillery was to constitute the reserve artillery of the corps. 

5. That the artillery reserve of the whole army should consist 
of 100 guns, and should comprise, besides a sufficient number of 
light " mounted batteries," all the guns of position, and, until the 
cavalry were massed, all the horse-artillery. 

6. That the amount of ammunition to accompany field-bat- 
teries was not to be less than 400 rounds per gun. 

7. A siege-train of 50 pieces. This was subsequently ex- 
panded, for special service at the siege of Yorktown, to very 
nearly 100 pieces, and comprised the unusual calibres and enor- 
mously heavy weight of metal of two 2oo-pounders, five 100- 
pounders, and ten 1 3-inch sea-coast mortars. 

As has been before stated, the whole of the field-artillery of the 
Army of the Potomac, July 28, 1861, was comprised of 9 imper- 
fectly equipped batteries of 30 guns, 650 men, and 400 horses. 
In March, 1862, when the whole army took the field, it consisted 
of 92 batteries of 520 guns, 12,500 men, and 11,000 horses, fully 
equipped and in readiness for active field service ; of the whole 
force 30 batteries were regulars and 62 batteries volunteers. 
During the short period of seven months all of this immense 
amount of material was manufactured or purchased, and issued 
by the ordnance department and placed in the hands of the artil- 



II 6 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

lery troops after their arrival in Washington. About one-fourth 
of all the volunteer batteries brought with them from their 
respective States a few guns and carriages, but they were nearly 
all of such peculiar calibre as to lack uniformity with the more 
modern and more serviceable ordnance with which the other bat- 
teries were armed, and they therefore had to be withdrawn and 
replaced by more suitable material. While about one-sixth came 
supplied with horses and harness, less than one-tenth were appa- 
rently fully equipped for service when they reported ; and every 
one even of these required the supply of many deficiencies of 
material, and very extensive instruction in the theory and practice 
of their special arm. 

The operations on the Peninsula by the Army of the Potomac 
commenced with a full field-artillery force of 49 batteries of 274 
guns. To this must be added the field-artillery of Franklin's 
division of McDowell's corps, which joined a few days before 
the capture of Yorktown, but was not disembarked from its 
transports for service until after the battle of Williamsburg, and 
the field-artillery of McCall's division of McDowell's corps (4 
batteries, 22 guns), which joined in June, a few days before the 
battle of Mechanicsville (June 26, 1862), making a grand total of 
field-artillery at any time with the army of the peninsula of 
57 batteries of 318 guns. 

When there were so many newly organized volunteer field- 
batteries, many of whom received their first and only instruction 
in the entrenched camps covering Washington during the three or 
four inclement months of the winter of 1861-62, there was, of 
course, much to be improved. Many of the volunteer batteries, 
however, evinced such zeal and intelligence, and availed them- 
selves so industriously of the instructions of the regular officers, 
their commanders, and the example of the regular batteries, their 
associates, that they made rapid progress and attained a degree 
of proficiency highly creditable. 

Gen. Barry served as chief of artillery with the Army of the 
Potomac until the close of the Peninsular campaign; he performed 
his duties with great zeal, patience, and ability. The artillery 
reserve was originally commanded by Col. H. J. Hunt, who gave 
up the command only when appointed chief of artillery in place 
of Gen. Barry. The artillery reserve was then commanded by 
Col. George W. Getty, an excellent officer, 



ARM Y ORGANIZA TION. I I 7 

Gen. Hunt retained the position of chief of artillery until 
the close of the war. I regarded him as the best living com- 
mander of field-artillery. He was a man of the utmost coolness 
in danger, thoroughly versed in his profession, an admirable 
organizer, a soldier of a very high order. As I write this (July, 
1882) Hunt is likely to be retired as a colonel a man whose 
services in any other army would have been rewarded by titles, 
high rank, and ample pension. He is one of the most marked 
instances within my knowledge of the highest merit and services 
passed over unacknowledged and unrewarded. 

Hunt's merits consisted not only in organizing his command 
to the best advantage, but in using it on the field of battle with 
the utmost skill and power. The services of this most distin- 
guished officer in reorganizing and refitting the batteries prior to 
and after Antietam, his gallant and skilful conduct on that field, 
at Malvern, and in fact during the whole Peninsular campaign, 
merit the highest encomiums in my power to bestow. 

The country in which operations were to be conducted was so 
obstructed by forests as to present few favorable opportunities for 
the employment of long-range artillery. I therefore desired to 
compose the artillery two-thirds of the Napoleon gun a light 12- 
pounder and one-third of rifled guns. But the facilities for the 
construction of army guns were so limited, while those for iron 
guns were comparatively so great, that in the first armament it 
was impossible to observe these proportions, so that when the 
army took the field less than one-third were Napoleon guns, and 
it was only during the reorganization for the Antietam campaign 
that it was possible to approach the proportions originally fixed 
upon. Our experience in battle proved the correctness of these 
views. The shrapnel and canister from the Napoleons was always 
most destructive to the hostile infantry at close range. We sel- 
dom saw the enemy at long range in large bodies. 

On the 2oth of Aug., 1861, I had 80 guns. The returns of 
Oct. 15 show that there were 27 batteries of divisional artillery. 
Of these 17 were regulars and 10 volunteers, and, as several had 
only 4 guns, there were not more than 140 guns in all, and of 
these the rifled guns composed a good deal more than two-thirds. 

Including Banks and Dix, there were 33 batteries, of which 19 
regulars and 14 volunteers, making not over 168 guns in all, to a 
force of 143,647 present on Oct. 15, and out of these guns must 



I 1 8 Me CLELLA N ' S WN S TOR Y. 

be provided those required for the garrisons of Washington and 
Baltimore, and the defences of the line of the Potomac. 

In regard to the 140 guns, they belonged to a force of about 
120,000 men, and out of the number would come those required 
for the garrison of Washington and the defences of the Potomac. 

It was not until after this date that artillery material and 
equipment flowed in with any considerable rapidity, so that, even 
disregarding the question of instruction, it was not until after the 
season for active operations had passed that a sufficient, number 
of equipped batteries were disposable to finish the requisite 
reserve and divisional artillery. The mass of the artillery was not 
in condition to move until the following April, and even then 
several of the volunteer batteries were deficient in instruction. 

The difficulties attending the organization of a suitable CAV- 
ALRY FORCE were very great, and it cannot be said that they were 
ever satisfactorily overcome. 

The newly arriving regiments reported to Gen. Stoneman, the 
chief of cavalry, and, as with the artillery and infantry, were, as 
far as circumstances would permit, retained for a certain time on 
the north bank of the Potomac. There was at first a total lack 
of equipment for the cavalry, and it was very long before this 
difficulty was removed. So great was the lack of cavalry arms 
that I was obliged to organize Rush's regiment (6th Penn.) as 
lancers, it being impossible to provide other weapons. 

Many of the officers and men were quite ignorant of the 
management of horses, and could not even ride well. More- 
over, there was too little appreciation on the part of the govern- 
ment of the necessity and advantages of that arm of service. 
With the cavalry, as with the other arms of service, every effort 
was made to weed out inefficient and incompetent officers by 
means of courts-martial and boards of examination. 

As rapidly as possible every cavalry soldier was armed with a 
sabre and revolver, and at least two squadrons in each regiment 
with the carbine.* 

It was intended to assign at least one regiment of cavalry to 
each infantry division so long as the division organization was 
the highest, and, when army corps should be formed, to attach 

* On the margin of his manuscript Gen. McClellan has written, " Here 
note experience in West Virginia," 



A RM y ORGANIZA TfOtf. 1 I Q 

a strong brigade of cavalry to its headquarters, leaving with the 
division only enough for the necessary duty ; also to form a gene- 
ral cavalry reserve. On the i5th of Oct. there were serving with 
the Army of the Potomac, including General Banks's command, 
one regiment and two companies of regular cavalry, and eleven 
regiments of volunteer cavalry. When the army took the field 
there were on its rolls four regiments and two companies of regu- 
lar cavalry, eighteen regiments and five companies of volunteer 
cavalry, besides four regiments yet unprovided with horses. 

Of these there went to the Peninsula the regulars and four 
regiments and five companies of volunteers, making eight regi- 
ments and seven companies ; and there remained with Gen. Banks 
and at Washington twenty-one regiments, besides the four unpro- 
vided with horses. Circumstances beyond my control rendered 
it impossible for me to carry out my views as to the cavalry, and 
it was entirely against my wishes and judgment that I was left in 
the field with so small a force of this arm. Of the field force one 
regiment of regulars were necessarily employed on provost duty, 
and two companies of regulars and one of volunteers at head- 
quarters, leaving only three regiments of regulars and four regi- 
ments and four companies of volunteers, certainly not over four 
thousand men at most, to do all the cavalry and mounted orderly 
duty for the army of eleven divisions a force so ridiculously 
insufficient, less than one-fourth of what it should have been, as 
to render it strange that the enemy contented themselves with 
riding around our lines only once on the Peninsula. 

As there were but three weak companies of ENGINEER TROOPS 
available, I did the best in my power to supply the deficiency by 
detailing as volunteer engineer troops the i5th and 5oth N. Y. 
Volunteers, which comprised an unusual number of sailors and 
mechanics in their ranks. These were formed into an engineer 
brigade, and placed under the command, first of Col. B. S. Alex- 
ander, U. S. Corps of Engineers, and finally under that of Col. 
D. V. Woodbury, of the same corps. These regiments rendered 
good service as engineer troops, and at length became admirable 
pontoniers, as their services under fire more than once testified. 

We had no bridge trains whatever, for the remains of the 
India-rubber pontoon trains constructed for the Mexican war 
were of no possible use. Therefore I gave directions for the con- 
struction of trains on the model of the latest French bridge. 



I2O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Capt. Duane, commanding the battalion of regular engineer 
troops, was charged with this duty, as well as the preparation 
of the other engineer trains. Capt. Duane performed this duty, 
as he did all that was assigned to him, in the most satisfactory 
manner. He on all occasions proved himself an admirable sol r 
dier and most excellent engineer. 

As already stated, I found it necessary to create the office of 
CHIEF OF STAFF, and selected Col. R. B. Marcy for the place. 

, One of the greatest defects in our military system is the lack 
of a thoroughly instructed STAFF CORPS, from which should be 
furnished chief of staff of armies, army corps and divisions, adju- 
tant-general, and aides-de-camp and recruiting officers. Perhaps 
the greatest difficulty that I encountered in the work of creating 
the Army of the Potomac arose from the scarcity of thoroughly 
instructed staff officers, and I must frankly state that every day I 
myself felt the disadvantages under which I personally labored 
from the want of that thorough theoretical and practical educa- 
tion received by the officers of the German general staff. 

Under our system of government, and in the circumstances 
which surround us, it is perhaps impossible, certainly very im- 
probable, that this most vital point can ever be satisfactorily 
covered. Political and personal considerations now control so 
completely the appointment to places in the various branches 
of the staff that the chances are against their being filled by the 
most competent men. In fact, judging from the experience of 
the past few years, it is almost a certainty that incompetent men 
will be selected for these most important positions. Inefficiency 
and waste must surely result from our present system, even in 
times of peace ; but in the event of our being thrown into col- 
lision with a well-organized European army, the results will be 
disastrous. Should we ever have a Secretary of War who under- 
stands his business and possesses the full support of the admin- 
istration and of Congress, the work may be done. But even if 
commenced in the right way, the danger would be that in the 
course of time presidents would appoint to the corps political 
or personal favorites, unless the law so hedged in the corps that 
appointments could only be made upon the recommendation of 
the chief of the corps and a board of its officers after a proper 
test of their qualifications. I am very sure that every general 
officer who served in the late war will agree with me that his 



THE STAFF. 121 

labors would have been immensely lightened and the efficiency 
of his command very much increased if he could have had a 
competent staff at his disposal. 

In comparison with the difficulties of the work that fell to 
my lot the task of a general officer of the German army seems 
mere child's play. None of the officers at my disposal had ever 
seen large armies or the operations of war on a grand scale. 
Those who came from West Point had a good education, so far 
as the theory of war was concerned. That was a great advan- 
tage, but by no means all that was required. Those whom I 
selected were usually comparatively young men, and, under my 
direction, soon grasped the situation ; but one very great obsta- 
cle arose from the incompetence of many of the permanent heads 
of departments, who found it very difficult to get out of the ruts 
in which they had been accustomed to move. To pass suddenly 
from the small scale on which the affairs of an army of 10,000 
men in time of peace had been conducted, to that required for 
an army of half a million in the midst of a desperate war, was no 
easy task. 

I have dwelt somewhat at length on this subject in order to 
accentuate the difficulties of the position, and to show that the 
time consumed in organizing the Army of the Potomac was far 
from unreasonable. 

During the war many improvements were made in the details 
of the administration of the staff corps ; but unfortunately no 
change whatever has been made in the organization of the va- 
rious departments, and their only gain by the war is in the 
personal experience of the officers who served therein. When 
they have passed away there will be little or no trace left of the 
experience of the war. 

Our own experience, and that of other armies, agree in 
determining the necessity for an efficient and able staff. To 
obtain this our staff establishment should be based on correct 
principles, and extended to be adequate to the necessities of the 
service, and should include a system of staff and line education. 

Moreover, the officers of the staff should be required occa- 
sionally to serve with troops as officers of the line, and when the 
turn of each comes for promotion it should be determined not 
only whether he is fit for promotion, but whether he is fit to 
remain in the corps.

The affairs of the ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT, while 
I commanded the Army of the Potomac, were conducted by 
Brig.-Gen. S. Williams, assisted by Lieut.-Col. James A. Hardie, 
aide-de-camp. Their management of the department during the 
organization of the army in the fall and winter of 1861 and dur- 
ing its subsequent operations in the field was excellent. 

They were, during the entire period, assisted by Capt. Rich- 
ard B. Irwin, aide-de-camp, and during the organization of the* 
army by the following-named officers : Capts. Joseph Kirkland, 
Arthur McClellan, M. T. McMahon, William P. Mason, and 
William F. Diddle, aides-de-camp. 



McCLELLAN'S STAFF. 123 

My PERSONAL STAFF, when we embarked for the Peninsula, 
consisted of Col. Thomas M. Key, additional aide-de-camp ; 
Col. E. H. Wright, additional aide-de-camp and major 6th 
U. S. Cavalry ; Col. T. T. Gantt, additional aide-de-camp ; Col. 
J. J. Astor, Jr., volunteer aide-de-camp ; Lieut. -Col. A. V. Col- 
burn, additional aide-de-camp and captain adjutant-general's 
department ; Lieut.-Col. N. B. Sweitzer, additional aide-de-camp 
and captain ist U. S. Cavalry ; Lieut.-Col. Edward McK. Hud- 
son, additional aide-de-camp and captain i4th U. S. Infantry ; 
Lieut.-Col. Paul Von Radowitz, additional aide-de-camp ; Maj. 
H. Von Hammerstein, additional aide-de-camp ; Maj. W. W. 
Russell, U. S. Marine Corps ; Maj. F. Le Compte, of the Swiss 
army, volunteer aide-de-camp ; Capts. Joseph Kirkland, Arthur 
McClellan, L. P. d'Orleans, R. d'Orleans, M. T. McMahon, Wil- 
liam P. Mason, Jr., William F. Biddle, and E. A. Raymond, 
additional aides-de-camp. 

Of these officers, Col. Gantt performed the duty of judge- 
advocate-general ; Maj. Le Compte was a spectator ; Capts. Kirk- 
land, McClellan, McMahon, Mason, and Biddle were on duty 
in the adjutant-general's office ; Capt. Raymond with the chief 
of staff ; Capt. McMahon was assigned to the personal staff of 
Brig. -Gen. Franklin, and Capts. Kirkland and Mason to that of 
Brig.-Gen. F. J. Porter, during the siege of Yorktown. They 
remained subsequently with those general officers. Maj. Le 
Compte left the army during the siege of Yorktown ; Cols. 
Gantt and Astor, Maj. Russell, Capts. L. P. d'Orleans, R. d'Or- 
leans, and Raymond at the close of the Peninsular campaign. 

To this number I am tempted to add the Prince de Join- 
ville, who constantly accompanied me through the trying cam- 
paign of the Peninsula, and frequently rendered important ser- 
vices. 

Soon after we reached the Chickahominy I took as one of my 
aides Lieut. G. A. Custer, 5th U. S. Cavalry, as a reward for an 
act of daring gallantry. This was the beginning of the distin- 
guished career of one of the most gallant soldiers of the army 
and an admirable cavalry leader. Before the termination of the 
Peninsular campaign Capts. W. S. Abert and Charles R. Lowell, 
of the 6th U. S. Cavalry, joined my staff as aides-de-camp, and 
remained with me until I was relieved from the command of the 
Army of the Potomac. All of these officers served me with great 



t24 MCCLELLAND OWN STORY. 

gallantry and devotion ; they were ever ready to execute any ser- 
vice, no matter how dangerous, difficult, or fatiguing. 

The duties of the INSPECTOR-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT, dur- 
ing the whole period of my command of the Army of the Poto- 
mac, were performed by Col. D. B. Sackett, assisted by Majs. N, 
H. Davis and Roger Jones, of the inspector-general's corps. 
The value of the services rendered by these officers merits all 
the commendation that I can bestow. No duty was ever slighted 
by them and no labor too great for them. Their reports were 
always full, satisfactory, and thoroughly to be relied upon. Nor 
did they confine themselves to the mere routine work of their 
duties, but on the field of battle rendered most valuable services 
as aides-de-camp under heavy fire. 

When I assumed command of the Division of the Potomac I 
found Maj. J. G. Barnard, U. S. Engineers subsequently briga- 
dier-general of volunteers occupying the position of chief-engi- 
neer of McDowell's command. I continued him in the same 
office, and at once gave the necessary instructions for the com- 
pletion of the defences of the capital and for the entire reor- 
ganization of the department. 

Under his direction the entire system of defences was carried 
into execution. This was completed before the army departed 
for Fort Monroe, and is a sufficient evidence of the skill of the 
engineers and the diligent labor of the troops. 

The ENGINEER DEPARTMENT presented the following organ- 
ization when the army moved for the Peninsula : 

Brig.-Gen. J. G. Barnard, chief-engineer ; First Lieut. H. C.

army had been collected, consisting of bateaux, with the anchors

and flooring material (French model), trestles, and engineers' 
tools, with the necessary wagons for their transportation. 

The small number of officers of this corps available rendered 
it impracticable to detail engineers permanently at the headquar- 
ters of corps and divisions. The companies of regular engi- 
neers never had their proper number of officers, and it was nec- 
essary, as a rule, to follow the principle of detailing engineer 
officers temporarily whenever their services were required. Con- 
stantly during the construction of the defences of Washington, 
and during the subsequent campaigns, we suffered great inconve- 
nience and delay from the want of a sufficient number of officers 
of engineers. 

To the corps of TOPOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS was entrusted 
the collection of topographical information and the preparation 
of campaign maps. Until a short time previous to the depar- 
ture of the army for Fort Monroe, Lieut.-Col. John W. Macomb 
was in charge of this department and prepared a large amount 
of valuable material. He was succeeded by Brig.-Gen. A. A. 
Humphreys, who retained the position throughout the Peninsu- 
lar campaign. These officers were assisted by Lieuts. O. G. 
Wagner, N. Bowen, John M. Wilson, and James H. Wilson, 
topographical engineers. This number, although the greatest 
available, was so small that much of the duty of the depart- 
ment devolved upon parties furnished by Prof. Bache, Superin- 
tendent of the Coast Survey, and other gentlemen from civil life. 

Owing to the entire absence of reliable topographical maps, 
the labors of this corps were difficult and arduous in the extreme. 
Notwithstanding the energy and ability displayed by Gen. Hum- 
phreys, Lieut.-Col. Macomb, and their subordinates, who fre- 
quently obtained the necessary information under fire, the 
movements of the army were sometimes unavoidably delayed 
by the difficulty of obtaining knowledge of the country in ad- 
vance. The result of their labors was the preparation of an 
excellent series of maps, which were invaluable to the armies 
afterwards traversing the same ground. 

During the campaign it was impossible to draw a distinct 
line of demarcation between the duties of the two corps of engi- 
neers, so that the labors of reconnoissances of roads, of lines of 
entrenchments, of fields for battle, and of the position of the 
enemy, as well as the construction of siege and defensive works, 



126 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

were habitually performed by details from either corps, as the 
convenience of the service demanded. 

I desire to express my high appreciation of the skill, gal- 
lantry, and devotion displayed by the officers of both corps of 
engineers under the most trying circumstances. 

During the Maryland campaign I united the two corps under 
Capt. J. C. Duane, U. S. Engineers, and found great advan- 
tages from the arrangement. The permanent union of the two 
corps, since made, was no doubt a wise measure. 

Surgeon Charles S. Tripler and Surgeon Jonathan Letterman 
in turn performed the duties of medical director of the Army of 
the Potomac, the former from Aug. 12, 1861, until July i, 1862, 
and the latter after that date. The difficulties to be overcome 
in organizing and making effective the MEDICAL DEPARTMENT 
were very great, arising principally from the inexperience of the 
regimental medical officers, many of whom were physicians taken 
suddenly from civil life, who, according to Surgeon Tripler, 
"had to be instructed in their duties from the very alphabet," 
and from the ignorance of the line officers as to their relations 
with the medical officers, which gave rise to confusion and con- 
flict of authority. Boards of examination were instituted, by 
which many ignorant officers were removed ; and by the suc- 
cessive exertions of Surgeons Tripler and Letterman the medi- 
cal corps was brought to a very high degree of efficiency. With 
regard to the sanitary condition of the army while on the Poto- 
mac, Dr. Tripler said that the records showed a constantly 
increasing immunity from disease. "In Oct. and Nov., 1861, 
with an army averaging 130,000 men, we had 7,932 cases 
of fever of all sorts ; of these about 1,000 were reported 
as cases of typhoid fever. I know that errors of diagnosis 
were frequently committed, and therefore this must be con- 
sidered as the limit of typhoid cases. If any army in the 
world can show such a record as this I do not know when or 
where it was assembled." From Sept., 1861, to Feb., 1862, 
while the army was increasing, the number of sick decreased 
from 7 per cent, to 6.18 per cent. Of these the men sick in 
the regimental and general hospitals were less than one-half ; 
the remainder were slight cases, under treatment in quarters, 
" During this time, so far as rumor was concerned, the army 
was being decimated by disease every month.'* Of the sani- 



HEALTH OF THE ARMY. \2J 

tary condition of the army during the Peninsular campaign, up 
to its arrival at Harrison's Landing, Dr. Tripler says : " Dur- 
ing this campaign the army was favored with excellent health. 
No epidemic disease appeared. Those scourges of modern ar- 
mies, dysentery, typhus, cholera, were almost unknown. We 
had some typhoid fever and more malarial fevers, but even 
these never prevailed to such an extent as to create any alarm. 
The sick-reports were sometimes larger than we cared to have 
them ; but the great majority of the cases reported were such 
as did not threaten life or permanent disability. I regret that 
I have not before me the retained copies of the monthly reports, 
so that I might give accurate statistics. I have endeavored to 
recover them, but have been unsuccessful. My recollection is 
that the whole sick-report never exceeded eight per cent, of the 
force, and this including all sorts of cases, the trivial as well as 
the severe. The Army of the Potomac must be conceded to 
have been the most healthy army in the service of the United 
States." 

The service, labors, and privations of the troops during the 
Seven Days' Battles had, of course, a great effect on the health 
of the army after it reached Harrison's Landing, increasing the 
number of sick to about twenty p5r cent, of the whole force. 

The nature of the military operations had also unavoidably 
placed the medical department in a very unsatisfactory condi- 
tion. Supplies had been almost entirely exhausted or neces- 
sarily abandoned ; hospital tents abandoned or destroyed ; and 
the medical officers were deficient in numbers and broken down 
by fatigue. 

All the remarkable energy and ability of Surgeon Letterman 
were required to restore the efficiency of his department ; but 
before we left Harrison's Landing he had succeeded in fitting 
it out thoroughly with the supplies it required, and the health 
of the army was vastly improved by the sanitary measures which 
were enforced at his suggestion. 

The great haste with which the army was removed from the 
Peninsula made it necessary to leave at Fort Monroe, to be for- 
warded afterwards, nearly all the baggage and transportation, 
including medical stores and ambulances, all the vessels being 
required to transport the troops themselves and their ammuni- 
tion, When the Army of the Potomac returned to Washington 



128 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

after Gen. Pope's campaign, and the medical department came 
once more under Surgeon Letterman's control, he found it in a 
deplorable condition. The officers were worn out by the labors 
they had performed, and the few supplies that had been brought 
from the Peninsula had been exhausted or abandoned, so that 
the work of reorganization and resupplying had to be again per- 
formed, and this while the army was moving rapidly and almost 
in the face of the enemy. That it was successfully accom- 
plished is shown by the care and attention which the wounded 
received after the battles of South Mountain and Antietam. 

Among the improvements introduced into his department by 
Surgeon Letterman, the principal are the organization of an am- 
bulance corps, the system of field-hospitals, and the method of 
supplying by brigades, all of which were instituted during the 
Maryland campaign, and found so efficient that they remained 
unchanged until the close of the war, and were to a great extent 
adopted by the other armies of the United States. 

On assuming command of the troops in and around Wash- 
ington I appointed Capt. S. Van Vliet, assistant quartermaster 
(afterwards brigadier-general), CHIEF QUARTERMASTER to my 
command, and gave him the necessary instructions for organiz- 
ing his department and colfecting the supplies requisite for the 
large army then called for. 

The disaster at Manassas had but recently occurred, and the 
army was quite destitute of quartermaster's stores. Gen. Van 
Vliet, with great energy and zeal, set himself about the task of 
furnishing the supplies immediately necessary, and preparing to 
obtain the still larger amounts which would be required by the 
new troops which were moving in large numbers towards the 
capital. The principal depot for supplies in the city of Wash- 
ington was under charge of Col. D. H. Rucker, assistant quarter- 
master, who ably performed his duties. Lieut.-Col. R. Ingalls, 
assistant quartermaster, was placed in charge of the department 
on the south side of the Potomac. I directed a large depot for 
transportation to be established at Perry ville, on the left bank 
of the Susquehanna, a point equally accessible by rail and water. 
Capt. C. G. Sawtelle, assistant quartermaster, was detailed to 
organize the camp, and performed his duties to my entire satis- 
faction. Capt. J. J. Dana, assistant quartermaster, had imme- 
diate charge of the transportation in and about Washington, as 



ARMY ORGANIZATION. 129 

well as of the large number of horses purchased for the use of 
the artillery and cavalry. The principal difficulties which Gen. 
Van Vliet had to encounter arose from the inexperience of the 
majority of the officers of his department in the new regiments 
and brigades. 

The necessity of attending personally to minor details ren- 
dered his duties arduous and harassing in the extreme. All 
obstacles, however, were surmounted by the untiring industry 
of the chief quartermaster and his immediate subordinates, and 
when the army was prepared to move the organization of the 
department was found to be admirable. 

When it was determined to move the army to the Peninsula 
the duties of providing water transportation were devolved by 
the Secretary of War upon his assistant, the Hon. John Tucker. 
The vessels were ordered to Alexandria, and Lieut.-Col. Ingalls 
was placed in immediate charge of the embarkation of the troops, 
transportation, and material of every description. Operations of 
this nature, on so extensive a scale, had no parallel in the history 
of our country. 

The arrangements of Lieut.-Col. Ingalls were perfected with 
remarkable skill and energy, and the army and its material were 
embarked and transported to Fortress Monroe in a very short 
space of time and entirely without loss. 

During the operations on the .Peninsula, until the arrival of 
troops at Harrison's Landing, Gen. Van Vliet retained the posi- 
tion of chief quartermaster, and maintained the thorough organi- 
zation and efficiency of his department. The principal depots 
of supplies were under the immediate charge of Lieut-Cols. 
Ingalls and Sawtelle. 

On the roth of July, 1862, Gen. Van Vliet having requested 
to be relieved from duty with the Army of the Potomac, I 
appointed Lieut.-Col. Ingalls chief quartermaster, and he con- 
tinued to discharge the duties of that office during the remain- 
der of the Peninsular and the Maryland campaigns in a manner 
which fully sustained the high reputation he had previously 
acquired. 

The immense amount of labor accomplished, often under the 
most difficult circumstances, the admirable system under which 
the duties of the department were performed, and the entire suc- 
cess which attended the efforts to supply so large an army, reflect 



130 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the highest credit upon the officers upon whom these onerous 
duties devolved. 

On the ist of Aug., 1861, Col. H. F. Clarke, commissary of 
subsistence, joined my staff, and at once entered upon his duties 
as CHIEF COMMISSARY of the Army of the Potomac. In order to 
realize the responsibilities pertaining to this office, as well as to 
form a proper estimate of the vast amount of labor which must 
necessarily devolve upon its occupant, it is only necessary to con- 
sider the unprepared state of the country to engage in a war of 
such magnitude, and the lack of practical knowledge on the part 
of the officers with reference to supplying and subsisting a large, 
and at that time unorganized, army. Yet, notwithstanding the' 
existence of these great obstacles, the manner in which the duties 
of the commissary department were discharged was such as to 
merit and call forth the commendation of the entire army. 

During the stay of the Army of the Potomac in the vicinity 
of Washington, prior to the Peninsular campaign, its subsistence 
was drawn chiefly from the depots which had been established 
by the commissary department at Washington, Alexandria, Forts 
Corcoran and Runyon. In the important task of designating and 
establishing depots of supplies Col. Clarke was ably seconded by 
his assistants, Col. Amos Beckwith, C. S., U. S. A.; Lieut-Col. 
George Bell, C. S., U. S. A.; Lieut.-Col. A. P. Porter, C. S., 
U. S. A.; Capt. Thomas Wilson, C. S., U. S. A.; Capt. Brown- 
ell Granger, C. S., U. S. Volunteers ; Capt. W. H. Bell, C. S., 
U. S. A.; Capt. J. H. Woodward, C. S., U. S. Volunteers; and 
Capt. W. R. Murphy, C. S., U. S. 'Volunteers. 

A full knowledge of the highly creditable manner in which 
each and all of the above-mentioned officers discharged their 
duties was given in the detailed report of Col. Clarke. The 
remarks and suggestions contained in his report afford valuable 
rules for the future guidance of the subsistence department in 
supplying armies in the field. The success of the subsistence 
department of the Army of the Potomac was in a great measure 
attributable to the fact that the subsistence department at Wash- 
ington made ample provision for sending supplies to the Penin- 
sula, and that it always exercised the most intelligent foresight. 
It moreover gave its advice and countenance to the officers 
charged with its duties and reputation in the field, and those 
officers, I am happy to say, worked with it and together in per- 



ARMY ORGANIZATION. 

feet harmony for the public good. During the entire period that 
I was in command of the Army of the Potomac there was no 
instance within my knowledge where the troops were with- 
out their rations from any fault of the officers of this depart- 
ment. 

I am quite within bounds when I say that no one could have 
performed his vitally important duties more satisfactorily than 
did Gen. Clarke. He never caused me the slightest anxiety, and 
I soon learned that he would always carry out my wishes, were 
it in the power of man to do so. A stranger to all petty intrigue, 
a brave and able officer, a modest man intent only upon the 
proper performance of his duty, he has never received the reward 
and appreciation his invaluable services merited. He held the 
post of chief-commissary of the Army of the Potomac until the 
close of the war, discharging his duty to the entire satisfaction 
of its successive commanders. Yet he was overslaughed in favor 
of an inferior who had never held a post of great importance, and 
whose only claim was the personal friendship of the President 
who committed the injustice. As I write (Sept., 1882) he has 
just received the grade of colonel in the ordinary course of pro- 
motion, and will ere long be retired with that grade, his only 
reward having been the empty brevet of major-general. 

The ORDNANCE DEPARTMENT, that very important branch 
of the service, was placed under the charge of Capt. C. P. Kings- 
bury, ordnance corps, colonel and aide-de-camp. Great diffi- 
culty existed in the proper organization of the department for the 
want of a sufficient number of suitable officers to perform the 
duties at the various headquarters and depots of supply. But 
far greater obstacles had to be surmounted, from the fact that 
the supply of small arms was totally inadequate to the demands 
of a large army, and a vast proportion of those furnished were 
of such inferior quality as to be unsatisfactory to the troops and 
condemned by the;r officers. The supply of artillery was more 
abundant, but of great variety. Rifled ordnance was just coming 
into use for the first time in this country, and the description 
of gun and kind of projectile which would prove most effective, 
and should, therefore, be adopted, was a mere matter of theory. 
To obviate these difficulties large quantities of small arms of for- 
eign manufacture were contracted for ; private enterprise in the 
construction of arms *and ammunition was encouraged ; and by 



132 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the time the army was ordered to move to the Peninsula the 
amount of ordnance and ordnance stores was ample. 

But it was not until the close of 1861, too late for active 
operations, that the infantry were reasonably well provided with 
serviceable arms ; and even after that the calibres were too 
numerous, and many arms really unfit for service. The artillery 
material, likewise, arrived in insufficient quantities until the early 
part of 1862. I mention these facts, not as in any way reflecting 
upon the ordnance department, which accomplished all that was 
in the power of men to do, but as showing the actual difficulties 
of the situation. Much also had been done to bring the qual- 
ity, both of arms and ammunition, up to the proper standard. 
Boards of officers were in session continually during the autumn 
and winter of 1861 to test the relative merits of new arms and 
projectiles. 

The reports of these boards, confirmed by subsequent expe- 
rience in the field, have done much to establish the respective 
claims of different inventors and manufacturers. During the 
campaigns of the Peninsula and Maryland the officers connected 
with the department were zealous and energetic, and kept the 
troops well supplied, notwithstanding the perplexing and arduous 
nature of their duties. One great source of perplexity was the 
fact that it had been necessary to issue arms of all varieties and 
calibres, giving an equal diversity in the kinds of ammunition 
required. Untiring watchfulness was therefore incumbent upon 
the officers in charge to prevent confusion and improper distri- 
bution of cartridges. Col. Kingsbury discharged the duties of 
his office with great efficiency until July, 1862, when his health 
required that he should be relieved. First Lieut. Thomas G. 
Baylor, ordnance corps, succeeded him, and performed his duty 
during the remainder of the Peninsular and Maryland campaigns 
with marked ability and success. 

Immediately after I was placed in command of the Division 
of the Potomac I appointed Col. Andrew Porter, i6th Regiment 
Infantry, PROVOST-MARSHAL of Washington. All the available 
regular infantry, a battery, and a squadron of cavalry were placed 
under his command, and by his energetic action he soon correct- 
ed the serious evils which existed, and restored order in the city. 

When the army was about to take the field Gen. Porter was 
appointed provost-marshal-general of the Army of the Potomac, 



ARMY ORGANIZATION. 133 

and held that most important position until the end of the Pen- 
insular campaign, when sickness, contracted in the untiring dis- 
charge of his duties, compelled him to ask to be relieved from 
the position he had so ably and energetically filled. 

The provost marshal-general's department had the charge of a 
class of duties which had not before, in our service, been defined 
and grouped under the management of a special department. 
The following subjects indicate the sphere of this department : 

Suppression of marauding and depredations, and of all brawls 
and disturbances, preservation of good order, and suppression of 
disturbances beyond the limits of the camps. 

Prevention of straggling on the march. 

Suppression of gambling-houses, drinking-houses or bar-rooms, 
and brothels. 

Regulation of hotels, taverns, markets, and places of public 
amusement. 

Searches, seizures, and arrests. Execution of sentences of 
general courts-martial involving imprisonment or capital punish- 
ment. Enforcement of orders prohibiting the sale of intoxicating 
liquors, whether by tradesmen or sutlers, and of orders respecting 
passes. 

Deserters from the enemy. 

Prisoners of war taken from the enemy. 

Countersigning safeguards. 

Passes to citizens within the lines and for purposes of trade. 

Complaints of citizens as to the conduct of the soldiers. 

Gen. Porter was assisted by the following named officers : 

Maj. W. H. Wood, iyth U. S. Infantry ; Capt. James McMillan, 
acting assistant adjutant-general, 2d U. S. Infantry ; Capt. W. T. 
Gentry, iyth U. S. Infantry; Capt. J. W. Forsyth, i8th U. S. 
Infantry; Lieut. J. W. Jones, i2th U. S. Infantry; Lieut. C. F. 
Trowb ridge, i6th U. S. Infantry ; and Lieut. C. D. Mehaffey, ist 
U. S. Infantry. 

The provost-guard was composed of the 2d U. S. Cavalry, 
Maj. Pleasonton, and a battalion of the 8th and iyth U. S. Infan- 
try, Maj. Willard. After Gen. Porter was relieved Maj. Wood 
was in charge of this department until after the battle of Antie- 
tam, when Brig.-Gen. Patrick was appointed provost-marshal- 
general. 

When the army took the field, for the purpose of securing 



134 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

order and regularity in the camp of headquarters, and facilitating 
its movements, the office of COMMANDANT OF GENERAL HEAD- 
QUARTERS was created, and assigned to Maj. G. O. Haller, yth 
U. S. Infantry. Six companies of infantry were placed under 
his orders for guard and police duty. 

From Aug., 1861, the position of JUDGE-ADVOCATE was held 
by Col. Thomas T. Gantt, aide-de-camp, until compelled by ill- 
health to retire, at Harrison's Landing, in Aug., 1862. His 
reviews of the decisions of courts-martial during this period 
were of great utility in correcting the practice in military courts, 
diffusing true notions of discipline and subordination, and set- 
ting before the army a high standard of soldierly honor. Upon 
the retirement of Col. Gantt the duties of judge-advocate were 
ably performed by Col. Thomas M. Key, aide-de-camp. 

The method of conveying intelligence and orders invented 
and introduced into the service by Maj. Albert J. Myer, signal 
officer U. S. Army, was first practically tested in large operations 
during the organization of the Army of the Potomac. Under 
the direction of Maj. Myer a SIGNAL CORPS was formed by 
detailing officers and men from the different regiments of volun- 
teers, and instructing them in the use of the flags by day and 
torches by night. 

The chief signal officer was indefatigable in his exertions to 
render his corps effective, and it soon became available for 
service in every division of the army. In addition to the flags 
and torches Maj. Myer introduced a portable insulated telegraph- 
wire, which could be readily laid from point to point, and which 
could be used under the same general system. In front of Wash- 
ington and on the lower Potomac, at any point within our lines 
not reached by the military telegraph, the great usefulness of this 
system of signals was made manifest. But it was not until after 
the arrival of the army upon the Peninsula, and during the siege 
and battles of that and the Maryland campaigns, that the great 
benefits to be derived from it on the field and under fire were 
fully appreciated. 

There was scarcely any action or skirmish in which the signal 
corps did not render important services. Often under heavy fire 
of artillery, and not unfrequently while exposed to musketry, the 
officers and men of this corps gave information of the move- 
ments of the enemy, and transmitted directions for the evolu- 



ARMY ORGANIZATION. 

tions of our own troops. The weak point in the signal corps as 
then constituted was that its officers were not trained soldiers, 
and therefore their judgment could not always be relied upon. 

The TELEGRAPHIC OPERATIONS of the Army of the Potomac 
were superintended by Maj. Thomas J. Eckert, and under the 
immediate direction of Mr. Caldvvell, who was, with a corps of 
operators, attached to my headquarters during the entire cam- 
paigns upon the Peninsula and in Maryland. 

The services of this corps were arduous and efficient. Under 
the admirable arrangements of Maj. Eckert they were constantly 
provided with all the material for constructing new lines, whic\ 
were rapidly established whenever the army changed position, 
and it was not unfrequently the case that the operatives worked 
under fire from the enemy's guns ; yet they invariably performed 
all the duties required of them with great alacrity and cheerful- 
ness, and it was seldom that I was without the means of direct 
telegraphic communication with the War Department and with 
the corps commanders. 

From the organization of the Army of the Potomac up to 
Nov. i, 1862, including the Peninsular and Maryland campaigns, 
upwards of twelve hundred (1,200) miles of military telegraph 
line had been constructed in connection with the operations of 
the army, and the number of operatives and builders employed 
was about two hundred (200). , 

To Prof. Lowe, the intelligent and enterprising aeronaut, who 
had the management of the BALLOONS, I was indebted for infor- 
mation obtained during his ascensions. In a clear atmosphere, 
and in a country not too much obstructed by woods, balloon 
reconnoissances made by intelligent officers are often of consid- 
erable value. 

I more than once took occasion to recommend the members 
of my staff, both general and personal, for promotion and reward. 
I once more record their names in the history of the Army 
of the Potomac as gallant soldiers, to whom their country owes 
a debt of gratitude, still unpaid, for the courage, ability, and 
untiring zeal they displayed during the eventful campaigns in 
which they bore so prominent a part.

IT is a great mistake to suppose that I had the cordial support 
of Gen. Scott ; the contrary was too much the case. While in the 
West I failed to obtain from him the assistance needed, and when 
I reached Washington I soon found that he was unnecessarily 
jealous of me. On the very day of my arrival he interfered, as 
already described, to prevent my keeping an appointment with 
the President, because he was not invited to be present. He 
directed me to ride around the streets of Washington and see 
that the drunken men were picked up, which I naturally did not 
do 1 He opposed the bill for increasing the number of aides, on 
the ground that he had only two in Mexico. Soon after assum- 
ing the command I saw the absolute necessity of giving a name 
to the mass of troops under my command, in order to 'inspire 
them with esprit de corps ; I therefore proposed to call my 
command "The Army of the Potomac." Gen. Scott objected 
most strenuously to this step, saying that the routine of service 
could be carried on only under the " department " system, etc. 
I persisted, and finally had my own way in the matter in spite 
of the opposition. I also told him that I proposed to organize 
brigades at first; then, when that organization was fairly estab- 
lished, to forrn divisions ; and finally, after everything was well 
arranged and I could be sure of selecting the right commanders 
probably after having been in the field for a time to form army 
corps. 

The general objected to this also, insisting that no higher 
organization than that of brigade was necessary ; that it was 
impossible to organize the troops under my command as an 
army ! Consequently, when the proper time arrived, I organized 
the divisions without further discussion of the matter. 

Gen. Scott was no longer himself when the war broke out. 
The weight of years and great bodily suffering pressed heavily * 
upon him, and really rendered him incapable of performing the 



STANTON AND HALLECK. 137 

duties of his station. For some time before he retired he was 
simply an obstacle, and a very serious one, in the way of active 
work. He did not wish me to succeed him as general-in-chief, 
but desired that place for Halleck, and long withheld his retire- 
ment that Halleck might arrive East and fall heir to his place. 

Speaking of Halleck, a day or two before he arrived in Wash- 
ington Stanton came to caution me against trusting Halleck, 
who was, he said, probably the greatest scoundrel and most 
barefaced villain in America ; he said that he was totally des- 
titute of principle, and that in the Almaden Quicksilver case he 
had convicted Halleck of perjury in open court. When Halleck 
arrived he came to caution me against Stanton, repeating almost 
precisely the same words that Stanton had employed. 

I made a note of this fact soon after its occurrence, and 
lately, Dec. 4, 1883, I saw for the first time, on page 833, vol. 
viii., series i, " Official Records of the War of the Rebellion," 
Gen. E. A. Hitchcock's letter to Halleck, in which the former 
transmits a message from Stanton on the very same subject. 
This is eminently characteristic of Stanton, who would say one 
thing to a man's face and just the reverse behind his back.* 

Of all men whom I have encountered in high position Hal- 
leck was the most hopelessly stupid. It was more difficult to get 
an idea through his head than can be conceived by any one who 
never made the attempt. I do not think he ever had a correct 
military idea from beginning to end. 

I left Gen. Hunter in nominal command of his brigade, 
because he bore an excellent reputation in the old army and 
had been wounded ; I have never met him personally. He did 
not assume command of the brigade, for as soon as he recovered 
from his wound the President appointed him major-general of 
volunteers, that he might go to Illinois and, in the words of 
Mr. Lincoln, "be a sort of father to them out there." 

* The following is an extract from the letter of Gen. E. A. Hitchcock 
to Gen. H. W. Halleck, dated Washington, March 22, 1862 : 

" I then bid the secretary (Stanton) good-evening and left him, but he 
called me back, and added that if I was going to write to you he wished 
to convey his respects, and his future confidence in your ability and 
patriotism, explaining that he had been employed against you in the mine 
case in California, and that his partner had some difficulty or controversy 
with you of a somewhat personal nature, but that, for his part, he had 
taken no interest in it, and had never had any other than the highest 
respect for you, and he hoped you would not imagine that he ever had." 



138 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Heintzelman also received a brigade ; he, too, had been 
wounded at Bull Run, and bore a good reputation in the old 
army. He was a very brave man and an excellent officer. 

W. T. Sherman was almost immediately taken from me to 
accompany Robert Anderson to Kentucky. I had a high opin- 
ion of him and parted from him with regret. 

Philip Kearny received a brigade; but, though he stood 
high as a remarkably daring man and good cavalry captain in 
the Mexican war, I had not sufficient confidence in his brains 
to give him one of the first divisions. I have since sometimes 
thought that I would have done well had I given him command 
of the cavalry. 

Sumner was in California when I assumed command ; he 
returned not long before we took the field, and at once received 
a division. He was an old and tried officer ; perfectly honest ; 
as brave as a man could be ; conscientious and laborious. In 
many respects he was a model soldier. He was a man for whom 
I had a very high regard, and for his memory I have the great- 
est respect. He was a very valuable man, and his soldierly 
example was of the highest value in a new army. A nation is 
fortunate that possesses many such soldiers as was Edwin V. 
Sumner. 

Franklin was one of the best officers I had ; very powerful. 
He was a man not only of excellent judgment, but of a remark- 
ably high order of intellectual ability. He was often badly 
treated, and seldom received the credit he deserved. His mo- 
ral character was of the highest, and he was in all respects an 
admirable corps commander ; more than that, he would have 
commanded an army well. The only reason why I did not send 
him to relieve Sherman, instead of Buell, was that I could not 
spare such a man from the Army of the Potomac. 

Blenker I found, and retained, in command of the Germans. 
Born in Bavaria, it was said he had served in Greece as a non- 
commissioned officer, and subsequently as a colonel or general 
officer in the revolutionary army of Baden in 1848. He was in 
many respects an excellent soldier ; had his command in excel- 
lent drill, was very fond of display, but did not, or could not, 
always restrain his men from plundering. Had he remained 
with me I think that he and his division would have done good 
service, and that they would have been kept under good dis-

cipline. It would be difficult to find a more soldierly-looking 
set of men than he had under his command. Of his subordinate 
officers the best was Gen. Stahl, a Hungarian, who had served 
with distinction under Georgei. His real name, I believe, was 
Count Serbiani. 

Richardson was in command of a regiment of Michigan 
volunteers when I went to Washington ; I at once gave him a 
brigade. He was an officer of the old army, " bull-headed," 
brave, a good disciplinarian. He received his mortal wound at 
Antietam. 

To Stone I gave a detached brigade on the upper Potomac 
ground with which he was familiar. He was a most charming 
and amiable gentleman ; honest, brave, a good soldier, though 
occasionally carried away by his chivalrous ideas. He was very 
unfortunate, and was as far as possible from meriting the sad 
fate and cruel treatment he met with. 

I found Couch in command of a regiment, and soon gave 
him a brigade. He was an honest, faithful, and laborious man, 
a brave, modest, and valuable officer. 

Fitz-John Porter was on duty with Gen. Patterson, as adju- 
tant-general, when I assumed command. As soon as possible I 
had him made a brigadier-general and gave him the command 
vacated by W. T. Sherman. Take him for all in all, he was 
probably the best general officer I had under me. He had 
excellent ability, sound judgment, and all the instincts of a sol- 
dier. He was perfectly familiar with all the details of his duty, 
an excellent organizer and administrative officer, and one of the 
most conscientious and laborious men I ever knew. I never 
found it necessary to do more than give him general instructions, 
for it was certain that all details would be cared for and nothing 
neglected. I always knew that an order given to him would be 
fully carried out, were it morally and physically possible. He 
was one of the coolest and most imperturbable men in danger 
whom I ever knew like all his race. I shall have occasion to 
revert to him hereafter, and will now only add that he was treat- 
ed with the grossest injustice chiefly, I fear, because of his devo- 
tion to me. 

Buell was in California, a lieutenant-colonel of the adju- 
tant-general's department. I had him appointed a brigadier- 
general and sent for him at once. He possessed a very high 



140 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

reputation in the Mexican war, and I found him to be an admir- 
able soldier in every regard. 

To Sedgwick I gave a brigade. Not knowing him well, I 
did not at first appreciate his high qualities, but soon discov- 
ered them and gave him the first vacant division that origi- 
nally commanded by Stone. He was one of the best and most 
modest soldiers we had. Possessing excellent ability and judg- 
ment, the highest bravery, great skill in handling troops, won- 
derful powers in instructing and disciplining men, as well as in 
gaining their love, respect, and confidence, he was withal so mod- 
est and unobtrusive that it was necessary to be thrown closely 
in contact with him to appreciate him. He was thoroughly un- 
selfish, honest, and true as steel. His conduct during the battle 
of Chancellorsville in storming the works on Marie's Heights, 
and afterwards holding his own against tremendous odds, was 
a remarkable and most brilliant feat of arms. 

Hancock received a brigade early in the formation of the 
Army of the Potomac. He was a man of the most chivalrous 
courage, and of a superb presence, especially in action ; he had 
a wonderfully quick and correct eye for ground and for hand- 
ling troops ; his judgment was good, and it would be difficult 
to find a better corps commander. 

John Reynolds was commandant of the corps of cadets when 
the war broke out. He gained a high reputation in the Mexican 
war as an officer of light artillery, and was among the first whom 
I caused to be appointed brigadier-general. He was a splendid 
soldier and performed admirably every duty assigned to him. 
Constantly improving, he was, when killed at Gettysburg, with 
Meade and Sedgwick, the best officer then with the Army of 
the Potomac. He was remarkably brave and intelligent, an 
honest, true gentleman. 

Meade was also one of my early appointments as brigadier- 
general. He was an excellent officer ; cool, brave, and intelli- 
gent ; he always did his duty admirably, and was an honest 
man. As commander of an army he was far superior to either 
Hooker or Burnside. 

Col. Ingalls was, in my experience, unequalled as a chief- 
quartermaster in the field. 

When first assigned to the command in the Department of 
the Ohio, I applied for Fitz-John Porter as my adjutant-gene- 



BLENKEtfS CAMP. 

ral, but he was already on duty with Gen. Patterson in the 
same capacity, and could not be spared. Soon afterwards I 
obtained Maj. Seth Williams, who had been on duty with Gen. 
Harney at St. Louis, and he remained with me as my adjutant- 
general until I was finally relieved from the command of the 
Army of the Potomac. I never met with a better bureau officer, 
perhaps never with so good a one. He thoroughly understood 
the working of the adjutant-general's department, was indefa- 
tigable in the performance of his duty, made many and valu- 
able suggestions as to the system of returns, reports, etc., and 
thus exerted a great influence in bringing about the excellent 
organization of the Army of the Potomac. He was thoroughly 
honest and a gentleman ; he was, if anything, too modest, for 
he would probably have accomplished more had he possessed 
more self-reliance. He won universal regard by his kind and 
considerate manner towards those with whom he was officially 
brought in contact. I never knew a more laborious and con- 
scientious man. 

During the autumn of 1861, as already stated, I spent my 
days chiefly in the saddle, rarely returning from my rides until 
late at night. Most of the night and the morning hours were 
given up to office-work. 

Of course I rode everywhere and saw everything. Not an 
entrenchment was commenced unless I had at least approved 
its site ; many I located myself. Not a camp that I did not 
examine, not a picket-line that I did not visit and cross, so 
that almost every man in the army saw me at one time or 
another, and most of them became familiar with my face. And 
there was no part of the ground near Washington that I did 
not know thoroughly. 

The most entertaining of my duties were those which some- 
times led me to Blenker's camp, whither Franklin was always 
glad to accompany me to see the " circus," or " opera," as he 
usually called the performance. As soon as we were sighted 
Blenker would have the " officer's call " blown to assemble his 
polyglot collection, with their uniform as varied and brilliant 
as the colors of the rainbow. Wrapped in his scarlet-lined 
cloak, his group of officers ranged around him, he would re- 
ceive us with the most formal and polished courtesy. Being 
a very handsome and soldierly-looking man himself, and there 



142 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

being many equally so among his surroundings, the tableau was 
always very effective, and presented a striking contrast to the 
matter-of-fact way in which things were managed in the other 
divisions. 

In a few minutes he would shout, " Ordinanz nurnero eins ! '' 
whereupon champagne would be brought in great profusion, 
the bands would play, sometimes songs be sung. It was said, 
I know not how truly, that Blenker had been a non-commis- 
sioned officer in the German contingent serving under King 
,Otho of Greece. 

His division was very peculiar. So far as "the pride, pomp, 
and circumstance of glorious war " were concerned, it certainly 
outshone all the others. Their drill and bearing were also 
excellent ; for all the officers, and probably all the men, had 
served in Europe. I have always regretted that the division 
was finally taken from me and sent to Fremont. The officers 
and men were all strongly attached to me ; I could control 
them as no one else could, and they would have done good 
service had they remained in Sumner's corps. The regiments 
were all foreign and mostly of Germans ; but the most remark- 
able of all was the Garibaldi regiment. Its colonel, D'Utassy, 
was a Hungarian, and was said to have been a rider in Fran- 
coni's Circus, and terminated his public American career in 
the Albany Penitentiary. His men were from all known and 
unknown lands, from all possible and impossible armies : Zou- 
aves from Algiers, men of the " Foreign Legion," Zephyrs, Cos- 
sacks, Garibaldians of the deepest dye, English deserters, Se- 
poys, Turcos, Croats, Swiss, beer drinkers from Bavaria, stout 
men from North Germany, and no doubt Chinese, Esquimaux, 
and detachments from the army of the Grand Duchess of 
Gerolstein. 

Such a mixture was probably never before seen under any 
flag, unless, perhaps, in such bands as Hoik's Jagers of the 
Thirty Years' War or the free lances of the middle ages. 

I well remember that in returning one night from beyond 
the picket-lines I encountered an outpost of the Garibaldians. 
In reply to their challenge I tried English, French, Spanish, 
Italian, German, Indian, a little Russian and Turkish ; * all in 

* It is proper to say that this is doubtless a simple statement of fact. 



FOREIGN OFFICERS. 143 

vain, for nothing at my disposal made the slightest impression 
upon them, and I inferred that they were perhaps gipsies or 
Esquimaux or Chinese. 

Mr. Seward's policy of making ours " a people's war," as he 
expressed it, by drumming up officers from all parts of the world, 
sometimes produced strange results and brought us rare speci- 
mens of the class vulgarly known as "hard cases." Most of the 
officers thus obtained had left their own armies for the armies' 
good, although there were admirable and honorable exceptions, 
such as Stahl, Willich, Rosencranz, Cesnola, and some others. 
Few were of the slightest use to us, and I think the reason why 
the German regiments so seldom turned out well was that their 
officers were so often men without character. 

Soon after Gen. Scott retired I received a letter from the 
Hungarian Klapka informing me that he had been approached 
by some of Mr. Seward's agents to get him into our army, and 
saying that he thought it best to come to a direct understanding 
with myself as to terms, etc. He said that he would require 
a bonus of $100,000 in cash and a salary of $25,000 per annum ; 
that on his first arrival he would consent to serve as my chief 
of staff for a short time until he acquired the language, and that 
he would then take my place of general commanding-in-chief. 
He failed to state what provision he would make for me, that 
probably to depend upon the impression I made upon him. 

I immediately took the letter to Mr. Lincoln, who was made 
very angry by it, and, taking possession of the letter, said that 
he would see that I should not be troubled in that way again. 

Cluseret afterwards Minister of War under the Commune 
brought me a letter of introduction from Garibaldi, recommend- 
ing him in the highest terms as a soldier, man of honor, etc. I 
did not like his appearance and declined his services ; but with- 
out my knowledge or consent Stanton appointed him a colonel 
on my staff. I still declined to have anything to do with him, 
and he was sent to the Mountain Department, as chief of staff, I 
think. 

On the recommendation of the Prussian minister I took upon 

Gen. McClellan was able to converse freely in most of the languages 
named, including two dialects of North American Indian, and had suffi- 
cient practical knowledge of all of them (as well as others) to make him 
independent of an interpreter. W. C. P. 



144 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

my staff, as aides-de-camp, two German officers whose subse- 
quent histories were peculiar and suggestive. One was a member 
of a very noble family, whose father had held high official rank 
in his native land, the son having been a lieutenant in the Guard 
Cavalry. He was one of the handsomest young fellows I have 
ever seen, polished to the last degree, and a splendid soldier. He 
remained with me during my command, and always performed 
difficult and dangerous duties in the best possible manner. He 
remained with the army on staff-duty after I was relieved. 

Being in Germany when the Austro-Prussian war broke out, 
I determined to call upon the War Minister and advise him to 
recall the officer in question, as an admirable soldier whose 
experience in our war would be valuable ; for I had been led 
to believe that his original separation from his own army had 
been caused by some trivial breach of discipline. Within a 
few days I learned that he had been dismissed our service. The 
last I heard of this poor fellow for one cannot help feeling 
sorry for the waste of such excellent gifts was that he made 
his living as croupier in a gambling-den. 

The other was of an old military family ; his father had been 
a general, and I had met his brothers and cousins as officers in 
the Austrian army. He also was an admirable and most use- 
ful aide in difficult times. After I left the field he became 
lieutenant-colonel, and probably colonel, of a regiment, and did 
good service. At the close of the war, failing to be retained, 
he enlisted in a regular cavalry regiment, hoping to be examined 
and promoted to a commission ; but his habits were against him. 
At last, in carrying the mail during the winter between the posts 
on the plains, his feet were frozen and, I think, amputated. 
Finally his family sent for him, and he returned home to die. 

Of a different order were the French princes who formed 
part of my military family from Sept. 20, 1861, to the close of 
the Seven Days. They served as captains, declining any higher 
rank, though they had fully earned promotion before the close 
of their connection with the army. They served precisely as the 
other aides, taking their full share of all duty, whether agreeable 
or disagreeable, dangerous or the reverse. They were fine young 
fellows and good soldiers, and deserved high credit in every 
way. 

Their uncle, the Prince de Joinville, who accompanied them 



THE FRENCH PRINCES. 

as a Mentor, held no official position, but our relations were 
always confidential and most agreeable. The Due de Chartres 
had received a military education at the military school at Turin; 
the Comte de Paris had only received instruction in military 
matters from his tutors. They had their separate establishment, 
being accompanied by a physician and a captain of chasseurs-a- 
pied. The latter was an immense man, who could never, under 
any circumstances, be persuaded to mount a horse : he always 
made the march on foot. 

Their little establishment was usually the jolliest in camp, 
and it was often a great relief to me, when burdened with care, 
to listen to the laughter and gayety that resounded from their 
tents. They managed their affairs so well that they were re- 
spected and liked by all with whom they came in contact. The 
Prince de Joinville sketched admirably and possessed a most 
keen sense of the ridiculous, so that his sketch-book was an 
inexhaustible source of amusement, because everything ludicrous 
that struck his fancy on the march was sure to find a place there. 
He was a man of far more than ordinary ability and of excellent 
judgment. His deafness was, of course, a disadvantage to him, 
but his admirable qualities were so marked that I became warm- 
ly attached to him, as, in fact, I did to all the three, and I have 
good reason to know that the feeling was mutual. 

Whatever may have been the peculiarities of Louis Philippe 
during his later life, it is very certain that in his youth, as the 
Due de Chartres, he was a brave, dashing, and excellent soldier. 
His sons, especially the Dues d'Orleans, d'Aumale, Montpensier, 
and the Prince de Joinville, showed the same characteristics in 
Algiers and elsewhere ; and I may be permitted to say that my 
personal experience with the three members of the family who 
served with me was such that there could be no doubt as to their 
courage, energy, and military spirit. The course pursued by the 
Prince de Joinville and the Due de Chartres during the fatal 
invasion of France by the Germans was in perfect harmony with 
this. Both sought service, under assumed names, in the darkest 
and most dangerous hours of their country's trial. The duke 
served for some months as Capt. Robert le Fort, and under that 
name, his identity being known to few if any beyond his closest 
personal friends, gained promotion and distinction by his gal- 
lantry and intelligence. 



146 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Should the Comte de Paris ever reach the throne of France 
as is more than probable I am sure that he will prove to be a 
wise, honest, and firm constitutional king, and that the honor and 
prosperity of France will be safer in his hands and those of his 
soldierly family than for many years past. 

Information from various sources received in Aug. and Sept., 
1 86 1, convinced the government that there was serious danger of 
the secession of Maryland. 

The secessionists possessed about two-thirds of each branch 
of the State legislature, and the general government had what it 
regarded as good reasons for believing that a secret, extra, and 
illegal session of the legislature was about to be convened at 
Frederick on the iyth of Sept. in order to pass an ordinance of 
secession. It was understood that this action was to be sup- 
ported by an advance of the Southern army across the Potomac 
an advance which the Army of the Potomac was not yet in a 
condition to desire. Even an abortive attempt to carry out this 
design would have involved great civil confusion and military 
inconvenience. It was impossible to permit the secession of 
Maryland, intervening, as it did, between the capital and the 
loyal States, and commanding all our lines of supply and rein- 
forcement. I do not know how the government obtained the 
information on which they reached their conclusions. I do 
not know how reliable it was. I only know that at the time it 
seemed more than probable, and that ordinary prudence required 
that it should be regarded as certain. So that when I received 
the orders for the arrest of the most active members of the legis- 
lature, for the purpose of preventing the intended meeting and 
the passage of the act of secession, I gave that order a most full 
and hearty support as a measure of undoubted military necessity. 

On the loth of Sept. Hon. Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, 
instructed Gen. Banks to prevent the passage of any act of seces- 
sion by the Maryland legislature, directing him to arrest all or 
any number of the members, if necessary, but in any event to do 
the work effectively. 

On the same day the Secretary of War instructed Gen. Dix to 
arrest six conspicuous and active secessionists of Baltimore, three 
of whom were members of the legislature. They were to be sent 
to Fort Monroe, their papers seized and examined. A special 
agent was sent to take immediate charge of the arrests. 



MARYLAND LEGISLATURE. 147 

On the loth of Sept. Gen. Dix sent to Secretary Seward and 
myself marked lists of the legislature. In his letters he strongly 
approved of the intended arrests, and advised that those arrested 
should be sent to New York harbor by a special steamer. 

The total number of arrests made was about sixteen, and the 
result was the thorough upsetting of whatever plans the seces- 
sionists of Maryland may have entertained. It is needless to say 
that the arrested parties were ultimately released, and were kindly 
treated while imprisoned. Their arrest^ was a military necessity, 
and they had no cause of complaint. In fact, they might with 
justice have received much more severe treatment than they did. 

On the 28th of Oct. I received from the chief of the Secret 
Service a report in reference to the elections to be held in Mary- 
land, on the 6th of Nov., for governor, members of the State legis- 
lature, etc. In this report he states that he had information of a 
general apprehension among the Union citizens of the southern 
part of the State of a serious interference with their rights of suf- 
frage by the disunion citizens of that district on the occasion of 
the election ; that it was said that several hundred persons, who 
had left that part of Maryland with the avowed purpose of aid- 
ing the secessionist cause by taking up arms or otherwise, had 
recently returned to their homes, as was supposed, for the pur- 
pose of controlling the State election ; also, that it had been 
reported to him that a large quantity of arms were concealed 
in a designated locality for use in endeavoring to control the 
election by the disunionists. 

I laid this report immediately before the President, who 
caused the following endorsement (also issued separately in the 
form of an order) to be made upon it : 

" DEPARTMENT OF STATE, 
"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28, 1861. 
" Maj.-Gen. George B. McClellan, etc., etc., etc. : 

" The President desires that Gen. McClellan will direct such 
disposition of the military force as will guard effectually against 
invasion of the peace and order of Maryland during the election, 
and for this purpose he is authorized to suspend the habeas cor- 
pus and make arrests of traitors and their confederates in his 
discretion. 

"(Signed) WILLIAM H. SEWARD." 

To carry out these instructions the necessary orders were 



148 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

issued to Gens. Banks, Stone, and Hooker. I give a copy of 
the order issued to Gen. Banks ; the others were the same, 
mutatis mutandis : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

Oct. 29, 1861. 
To Maj.-Gen. N. P. Banks, Commanding Division at Muddy 

Branch, Md. : 

GENERAL : There is an apprehension among Union citizens in 
many parts of Maryland t)f an attempt at interference with the 
rights of suffrage by disunion citizens on the occasion of the elec- 
tion to take place on the 6th of Nov. next. In order to prevent 
this the major-general commanding directs that you send detach- 
ments of a sufficient number of men to the different points in 
your vicinity where the elections are to be held, to protect the 
Union voters and see that no disunionists are allowed to intimi- 
date them or in any way interfere with their rights. He also 
desires you to arrest and hold in confinement till after the elec- 
tion all disunionists who are known to have returned from Vir- 
ginia recently and who show themselves at the polls, and to guard 
effectually against any invasion of the peace and order of the 
election. 

For the purpose of carrying out these instructions you are 
authorized to suspend the habeas corpus. Gen. Stone has received 
similar instructions to these. You will please confer with him as 
to the particular points that each shall take control of. 
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff 



CHAPTER IX 

Conspiracy of the politicians Edwin M. Stanton Interview at the 
President's office Salmon P. Chase Relations with Mr. Lincoln 
Anecdotes President's military orders Reduction of army. 

I HAVE already stated in a general way what occurred 
between myself and some of the radical leaders shortly after 
I reached Washington. They then saw clearly that it would 
riot be possible to make a party tool of me, and soon concluded 
that it was their policy to ruin me if possible. 

It had been clearly stated by Congress and the general 
government that the s;>le object of the war was the preserva- 
tion of the Union and the prevention of the secession of the 
Southern States.* We fought to keep them in the Union, and 
the practically unanimous sentiment of the army, as well as of 
the mass of the people, was at that time strongly in favor of 
confining the war to that object. Although the Free-Soil ele- 
ment was strong in the North, the Abolitionists proper were 
weak, and a declaration of their true purposes would have 
seriously interfered with the progress of the war. A clear indi- 
cation of the correctness of this statement lies in the fact that 
the executive never disowned my proclamation to the West Vir- 
ginians nor the policy I pursued in reference to Kentucky. 

The real object of the radical leaders was not the restoration 
of the Union, but the permanent ascendency of their party, and 
to this they were ready to sacrifice the Union, if necessary. 

* A few days before the arrival of McClellan in Washington Congress 
had stated the purposes of the war in a resolution : 

"That the present deplorable civil war has been forced upon the 
country by the disunionists of the Southern States, now in revolt against 
the constitutional government, and in arms around the capital ; that in 
this national emergency Congress, banishing all feeling of mere passion 
or resentment, will recollect only its duty to its country ; that this war is 
not waged, on our part, in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of 
conquest or subjugation, nor purpose of overthrowing or interfering with 
the rights or established institutions of those States, but to defend and 
maintain the supremacv of the Constitution and to preserve the Union, 
with all the dignity, equality, and rights of the several States unimpaired ; 
and as soon as these objects are accomplished the war ought to cease."

I5O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

They committed a grave error in supposing me to be politi- 
cally ambitious and in thinking that I looked forward to military 
success as a means of reaching the presidential chair. At the 
same time they knew that if I achieved marked success my 
influence would necessarily be very great throughout the coun- 
try an influence which I should certainly have used for the 
good of the whole country, and not for that of any party at the 
nation's expense. 

They therefore determined to ruin me in any event and by 
any means : first by endeavoring to force me into premature 
movements, knowing that a failure would probably end my mili- 
tary career; afterwards by withholding the means necessary to 
achieve success. 

That they were not honest is proved by the fact that, having 
failed to force me to advance at a time when an advance would 
have been madness, they withheld the means of success when I 
was in contact with the enemy, and finally relieved me from 
command when the game was in my hands. They determined 
that I should not succeed, and carried out their determinations 
only too well and at a fearful sacrifice of blood, time, and 
treasure. In the East alone it is quite safe to say that we 
unnecessarily lost more than a quarter of a million in killed, 
wounded, and prisoners in consequence of my being withdrawn 
from the Peninsula and not properly supported. Taking both 
East and West, and counting the losses also by disease, I do not 
doubt that more than half a million of men were sacrificed 
unnecessarily for the sake of insuring the success of a politi- 
cal party. 

I do not base my assertions as to the motives of the radical 
leaders upon mere surmises, but upon facts that have frequently 
come to my knowledge during the war and since. For instance, 
Maj. Charles Davies, once professor of mathematics at West 
Point, told me, and at a different time told Gen. Jos. E. John- 
ston, the following story : 

He said that during the very early part of the Peninsular 
campaign he was one of a commission sent from New York to 
urge more vigorous action in supporting me. They called upon 
the President, and found Mr. Stanton with him. In reply to 
their statement of the purpose of their visit Mr. Stanton stated 
that the great end and aim of the war was to abolish slavery. 



EDWIN M. STANTON. 151 

To end the war before the nation was ready for that would be a 
failure. The war must be prolonged, and conducted so as to 
achieve that. That the people of the North were riot yet ready 
to accept that view, and that it would not answer to permit me 
to succeed until the people had been worked up to the proper 
pitch on that question. That the war would not be finished 
until that result was reached, and that, therefore, it was not 
their policy to strengthen Gen. McClellan so as to insure his 
success. 

I have heard, from the best authority, many instances in 
which the same views were expressed by other prominent radi- 
cal leaders. Under date of April 7, 1862, Gen. Franklin, in a 
letter informing me of the circumstances attending the with- 
holding of McDowell's corps, of which his division formed part, 
writes: "McDowell told me that it was intended as a blow at 
you. That Stanton had said that you intended to work by 
strategy and not by fighting ; that all of the opponents of the 
policy of the administration centred around you in other 
words, that you had political aspirations. There was no friend 
of yours present to contradict these statements, of course." 

As a further proof that the administration did not intend the 
Peninsular campaign to be successful may be cited the fact that 
on the 3d of April, 1862, ten days after I left Washington to 
assume command in the field, there was issued General Order 
No. 33, closing all the recruiting depots for the volunteers and 
stopping all recruiting. It is hardly credible that the members 
of the administration were ignorant of the fact that an army in 
the field must meet with some losses under the most favorable 
circumstances, and that to stop all supplies of men at such a 
juncture is the most unpardonable of follies. 

From the light that has since been thrown on Stanton's 
character I am satisfied that from an early date he was in 
this treasonable conspiracy, and that his course in ingratiat- 
ing himself with me, and pretending to be my friend before 
he was in office, was only a part of his long system of treachery. 

Judge Black's papers in the Galaxy showed the character of 
the man ; and it is somewhat singular that the judge began the 
papers for the purpose of vindicating Stanton, but that as he 
proceeded he became enlightened as to what the man really was. 

I had never seen Mr. Stanton, and probably had not even 



152 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

heard of him, before reaching Washington in 1861. Not many 
weeks after arriving I was introduced to him as a safe adviser on 
legal points. From that moment he did his best to ingratiate 
himself with me, and professed the warmest friendship and devo- 
tion. I had no reason to suspect his sincerity, and therefore 
believed him to be what he professed. The most disagreeable 
thing about him was the extreme virulence with which he abused 
the President, the administration, and the Republican party. 
He carried this to such an extent that I was often shocked by it. 

He never spoke of the President in any other way than as 
the " original gorilla," and often said that Du Chaillu was a fool 
to wander all the way to Africa in search of what he could so 
easily have found at Springfield, Illinois. Nothing could be more 
bitter than his words and manner always were when speaking of 
the administration and the Republican party. He never gave 
them credit for honesty or patriotism, and very seldom for any 
ability. 

At some time during the autumn of 1861 Secretary Cameron 
made quite an abolition speech to some newly arrived regiment. 
Next day Stanton urged me to arrest him for inciting to insubor- 
dination. He often advocated the propriety of my seizing the 
government and taking affairs into my own hands. 

As he always expressed himself in favor of putting down the 
rebellion at any cost, I always regarded these extreme views as 
the ebullitions of an intense and patriotic nature, and sometimes 
wasted more or less time in endeavoring to bring him to more 
moderate views, never dreaming that all the while this man was 
in close communication with the very men whom he so violently 
abused. His purpose was to endeavor to climb upon my shoul- 
ders and then throw me down. 

Several weeks before Mr. Cameron was finally removed from 
the War Department it came to my knowledge that a committee 
of New York bankers were urging upon Secretary Chase the 
removal of Mr. Cameron. I interfered, and by my action with 
the President no doubt saved him. The fact is that, so far as 
purely military matters were concerned, Mr. Cameron had not at 
all interfered with me, but gave me full support. He, so far as I 
knew, occupied himself solely with contracts and political affairs. 
The only difficulty I ever had with him and I do not think that 
this point had arisen before the time in question, at all events 



EDWIN M. STAN TON. 153 

to a very considerable degree was that I could not always dis- 
pose of arms and supplies as I thought the good of the service 
demanded. For instance, it often happened, especially toward 
the close of his administration, that when a shipment of unusu- 
ally good arms arrived from Europe, and I wished them for the 
Army of the Potomac, I found that they had been promised to 
some political friend who might be engaged in raising a pros- 
pective regiment in some remote State, and I could not get 
them. So with regard to other articles of equipment, and to 
batteries and regiments which I desired for the Army of the 
Potomac. As I had no idea who might be selected in Mr. Came- 
ron's place, and as he supported me in purely military matters, I 
objected to his removal and saved him. He was made aware of 
this at the time. 

Finally, one day when I returned to my house from my day's 
work and was dressing for dinner, a lady of my family told me 
that Col. Key, one of my aides, had just been there to inform me 
that Mr. Cameron had resigned and that Mr. Stanton was ap- 
pointed in his place. This was the first intimation that I had of 
the matter. Before I had finished my toilet Mr. Stanton's card 
came up, and as soon as possible I went down to see him. He 
told me that he had been appointed Secretary of War, and that 
his name had been sent to the Senate for confirmation, and that 
he had called to confer with me as to his acceptance. He said 
that acceptance would involve very great personal sacrifices on 
his part, and that the only possible inducement would be that he 
might have it in his power to aid me in the work of putting down 
the rebellion; that he was willing to devote all his time, intellect, 
and energy to my assistance, and that together we could soon 
bring the war to an end. If I wished him to accept he would 
do so, but only on my account ; that he had come to know my 
wishes and determine accordingly. I told him that I hoped he 
would accept the position. 

Soon after Mr. Stanton became Secretary of War it became 
clear that, without any reason known to me, our relations had 
completely changed. Instead of using his new position to assist 
me he threw every obstacle in my way, and did all in his power 
to create difficulty and distrust between the President and myself. 
I soon found it impossible to gain access to him. Before he 
was in office he constantly ran after me and professed the most 



154 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

ardent friendship ; as soon as he became Secretary of War his 
whole manner changed, and I could no longer find the oppor- 
tunity to transact even the ordinary current business of the office 
with him. It is now very clear to me that, far from being, as he 
had always represented himself to me, in direct and violent oppo- ' 
sition to the radicals, he was really in secret alliance with them, 
and that he and they were alike unwilling that I should be suc- 
cessful. No other theory can possibly account for his and their 
course, and on that theory everything becomes clear and easily 
explained. 

Had I been successful in my first campaign the rebellion . 
would perhaps have been terminated without the immediate abo- 
lition of slavery. To gain their ends with the President they 
played upon his apprehensions for the safety of Washington 
growing out of his complete ignorance of war as well as upon 
his personal aspirations. I believe that the leaders of the radical 
branch of the Republican party preferred political control in one 
section of a divided country to being in the minority in a restored 
Union. 

Not only did these people desire the abolition of slavery, but 
its abolition in such a manner and under such circumstances that 
the slaves would at once be endowed with the electoral franchise, 
while the intelligent white man of the South should be deprived 
of it, and permanent control thus be secured through the votes of 
the ignorant slaves, composing so large a portion of the popula- 
tion of the seceded States. 

Influenced by these motives, they succeeded but too well in 
sowing the seeds of distrust in Mr. Lincoln's mind, so that, even 
before I actually commenced the Peninsular campaign, I had 
lost that cordial support of the executive which was necessary to 
attain success. It may be said that under these circumstances 
it was my duty to resign my command. But I had become 
warmly attached to the soldiers, who already had learned to love 
me well ; all my pride was wrapped up in the army that I had 
created, and I knew of no commander at all likely to be assigned 
to it in my place who would be competent to conduct its opera- 
tions. 

Nor did I at that time fully realize the length to which these 
men were prepared to go in carrying out their schemes. For 
instance, I did not suspect, until the orders reached me, that 






COMMENCEMENT OF DIFFICULTIES. 155 

Fort Monroe and the ist corps would be withdrawn from my 
control ; and when those orders arrived they found me too far 
committed to permit me to withdraw with honor. With the 
troops under fire it did not become me to offer my resigna- 
tion. 

The difficulties of my position in Washington commenced 
when I was first confined to my bed with typhoid fever in 
December and January (1861 and 1862) for some three weeks, 
and culminated soon after Mr. Stanton became Secretary of War. 
Up to this time there had been no serious difficulty ; there were 
slight murmurs of impatience at the delay in moving, but all 
sensible and well-informed men saw the impossibility of enter- 
ing upon a campaign at that season, and no party was as yet 
openly formed against me. 

My malady was supposed to be more serious than it really 
was ; for, although very weak and ill, my strong constitution 
enabled me to retain a clear intellect during the most trying 
part of the illness, so that I daily transacted business and gave 
the necessary orders, never for a moment abandoning the direc- 
tion of affairs. As is often the case with such diseases, I some- 
times passed days and nights without sleeping, and it more than 
once happened that the President called while I was asleep after 
such intervals of wakefulness, and, being denied admittance, his 
anxiety induced him to think that my disease was very acute 
and would terminate fatally. The radical leaders skilfully availed 
themselves of the state of affairs to drive in an entering wedge. 
They represented to the President that as I kept my own counsels 
and was not in the habit of consulting or advising with others, 
but acted entirely on my own judgment, no one but myself 
knew the exact condition of the army, its state of prepara- 
tion, or the designs I had in view ; that, should my malady 
terminate suddenly and fatally, great confusion would ensue, 
and that it was necessary to provide against such an emer- 
gency by causing a secret examinatioji to be made immedi- 
ately. My first inkling of this came through Mr. Stanton, not 
yet Secretary of War, who said to me : " They are counting on 
your death, and are already dividing among themselves your mili- 
tary goods and chattels." 

The fact was that, although I was in the habit of acting solely 
on my own judgment, and never told more of my intentions than 



156 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

was absolutely necessary, I always consulted freely with the chiefs 
of the staff departments, each of whom knew the exact condition 
of affairs in his own department and could give to any properly 
authorized person all necessary explanations. So that a secret 
examination was not only unnecessary, but could not produce as 
good results as the honest, direct way of coming to me and direct- 
ing me to instruct my staff to explain the state of affairs to the 
President or Secretary of War. Gens. McDowell, Franklin, and, 
I think, Meigs were entrusted by the President with this busi- 
ness. 

McDowell, who was probably at the bottom of the affair, 
undertook it con amore t hoping to succeed me in command. 
Franklin was unwilling to touch it, and simply acted under 
orders. This information reached me when the crisis of my 
malady was over, and learning also through Mr. Stanton that 
a grand conclave was to assemble without my knowledge, I mus- 
tered strength enough on Sunday morning (Jan. 12, 1862) to be 
driven to the White House, where my unexpected appearance 
caused very much the effect of a shell in a powder-magazine. It 
was very clear from the manner of those I met there that there 
was something of which they were ashamed. 

I made no allusion to what I knew, nor was anything said to 
me on the subject. But I took advantage of the occasion to 
explain to the President in a general and casual way what my 
intentions were ; and before I left he told me that there was to be 
a meeting at the White House next day, and invited me to attend, 
but made no reference to the object of the meeting. At the 
designated hour I went to the President's office and there met 
a party consisting of the President, Secretaries Seward, Chase, 
and Blair, Gens. McDowell, Franklin, and Meigs. I do not think 
that the Secretary of War (Mr. Cameron) was present. I sat by 
Secretary Blair and Gen. Meigs, and entered into conversation 
with them upon topics of general interest having no possible 
bearing upon any subject that could be brought before the meet- 
ing. Meanwhile there was a good deal of whispering among the 
others, in which I do not think Franklin took any special part. 
Finally McDowell said he wished to explain to me the part he 
had in the examination, which had commenced, into the state of 
the army. 

Exactly what he said has escaped my memory, except that he 



SALMON P. CHASE. 157 

disclaimed any purpose hostile to me, and based what had been 
done on the ground of the supposed critical nature of my ill- 
ness. I stopped the explanation by saying that as I was now 
again restored to health the case had changed, and that, as the 
examination must now cease, further explanations were unneces- 
sary. Franklin then said a few words clearing himself of any 
improper motives, which was needless, as I could not suspect him 
of anything wrong. I then quietly resumed my conversation with 
Blair and Meigs, awaiting further developments. 

The whispering then recommenced, especially between the 
President and Secretary Chase ; when at length the latter (Chase) 
spoke aloud, for the benefit of all assembled, in a very excited 
tone and manner, saying that he understood the purpose of the 
meeting to be that Gen. McClellan should then and there explain 
his military plans in detail, that they might be submitted to the 
approval or disapproval of the gentlemen present. The uncalled- 
for violence of his manner surprised me, but I determined to 
avail myself of it by keeping perfectly cool myself, and contented 
myself with remarking what was entirely true that the purpose 
he expressed was entirely new to me ; that I did not recognize the 
Secretary of the Treasury as in any manner my official superior, 
and that I denied his right to question me upon the military 
affairs committed to my charge ; that in the President and Sec- 
retary of War alone did I recognize the right to interrogate me. 
I then quietly resumed my conversation with Blair and Meigs, 
taking no further notice of Mr. Chase. 

I must again state that this meeting had been arranged when 
I was supposed to be too ill to attend, and that the original and 
real purpose was not as Mr. Chase stated it, but " to dispose 
of the military goods and chattels " of the sick man so inoppor- 
tunely restored to life. Mr. Chase's disappointment at this sud- 
den frustration of his schemes accounts, I suppose, for his anger. 
In another connection I have already stated that some weeks 
before the date of this meeting I had given Mr. Chase a sketch 
of the proposed Urbana movement, and that he was much pleased 
with it. Here I need only say in addition that I did this entire- 
ly of my own volition, for the purpose indicated, and that Mr. 
Swinton is entirely mistaken in stating that it was by direction 
of the President. Mr. Chase knew at the time that the Presi- 
dent had no knowledge of my intention of talking to him about 



158 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY, 

my plans. At this previous interview Mr. Chase seemed very 
grateful for the confidence I reposed in him and for my thought- 
fulness in thus seeking to relieve his mind in his troubles. I pre- 
sume the after-thought, and the object of the intrigues, cut short 
by my recovery, was to take advantage of this plan by having it 
carried into effect by McDowell. In no other way can I account 
for the uncalled-for irritation displayed. This impression is 
strengthened by other circumstances which will appear as I 
proceed with my story. 

To return to the meeting. After I had thus disposed of the 
Secretary of the Treasury he resumed his whispering with the 
President, who, after the lapse of some minutes, said : " Well, 
Gen. McClellan, I think you had better tell us what your plans 
are " or words to that effect. 

To this I replied, in substance, that if the President had con- 
fidence in me it was not right or necessary to entrust my designs 
to the judgment of others, but that if his confidence was so slight 
as to require my opinions to be fortified by those of other persons 
it would be wiser to replace me by some one fully possessing his 
confidence ; that no general commanding an army would willingly 
submit his plans to the judgment of such an assembly, in which 
some were incompetent to form a valuable opinion, and others 
incapable of keeping a secret, so that anything made known to 
them would soon spread over Washington and become known to 
the enemy. I also reminded the President that he and the Sec- 
retary of the Treasury knew in general terms what my designs 
were. Finally, I declined giving any further information to the 
meeting, unless the President gave me the order in writing and 
assumed the responsibility of the results. 

This was probably an unexpected denouement. The President 
was not willing to assume the responsibility ; and, after a little 
more whispering between him and Mr. Chase, Mr. Seward arose, 
buttoned his coat, and laughingly said, " Well, Mr. President, I 
think the meeting had better break up. I don't see that we are 
likely to make much out of Gen. McClellan." With that the 
meeting adjourned. I do not think that Mr. Seward took any 
special part in the affair, and believe that he was on my side. 
Mr. Chase still continued his whispered conversation with the 
President. I waited until that had ceased, then walked up to the 
President, begged him not to allow himself to be acted upon by 






STANTON WAR SECRETARY. 159 

improper influences, but still to trust me, and said that if he 
would leave military affairs to me I would be responsible that I 
would bring matters to a successful issue and free him from all 
his troubles. 

The radicals never again lost their influence with the Presi- 
dent, and henceforth directed all their efforts to prevent my 
achieving success. After this time Secretary Chase worked with 
them and became my enemy. 

One of their next steps was to secure the removal of Mr. 
Cameron, in order to replace him by Mr. Stanton, who, while pre- 
tending to be my friend, was secretly allied with them, and no 
doubt made use of his pretended friendship for me to secure 
his appointment ; for I have no reason to doubt the sincerity of 
the President's assertion that he had appointed him because 
he thought it would be agreeable to me.* 

* Note by the Editor. The question will naturally be asked, How 
came it about that Mr Edwin M. Stanton, then a pronounced and violent 
opponent of the President and the administration, knew of this secret pro- 
ceeding, which was concealed from all but a few confidential friends of the 
President and three soldiers under orders of secrecy? Also, how came it 
that a few days after this Mr. Stanton was brought into Mr. Lincoln's cabi- 
net ? These questions were unanswerable until the publication of the pri- 
vate papers of Secretary Chase, which shed ample light on them. Why Mr. 
Stanton revealed Mr. Chase's secret to McClelian, and enabled the latter to 
defeat the plot, can be conjectured. Willing to be made War Secretary by 
Mr. Chase's intrigues, he may not have been so willing to have McDowell, 
or any other general closely allied to Mr. Chase, placed in command of the 
army. 

On the very day on which Gen. McClelian made use of Mr. Stanton's 
information, and left his bed to visit the President, Mr. Chase devoted 
himself to concentrating the plans for bringing Mr. Stanton into the cabi- 
net. He regarded it as a matter of the highest importance, and his 
account, in his private diary for that day, of his method of using Secretary 
Cameron and Seward to accomplish his end forms a very extraordinary 
intermingling of piety and politics, as follows (see Warden's "Account, 
etc., of S. P. Chase," p. 400) : 

" January 12, 1862. At church this morning. Wished much to join 
in communion, but felt myself too subject to temptation to sin. After 
church went to see Cameron by appointment ; but being obliged to meet 
the President, etc., at one, could only excuse myself. At President's 
found Gens. McDowell, Franklin, and Meigs, and Seward and Blair. 
Meigs decided against dividing forces and in favor of battle in front. 
President said McClellan's health was much improved, and thought it 
best to adjourn until to-morrow, and have all then present attend with 
McC. at three. Home, and talk and reading. Dinner. Cameron came 



l6o McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

My relations with Mr. Lincoln were generally very pleasant, 
and I seldom had trouble with him when we could meet face to 
face. The difficulty always arose behind my back. I believe 
that he liked me personally, and certainly he was always much 
influenced by me when we were together. During the early part 
of my command in Washington he often consulted with me before 
taking important steps or appointing general officers. 

He appointed Hunter a major-general without consulting me, 
and a day or two afterwards explained that he did so " because 
the people of Illinois seemed to want somebody to be a sort of 
father to them, and he thought Hunter would answer that pur- 
pose." 

in. . . . We talked of his going to Russia, and Stanton as successor, and 
he proposed I sh mid again <ee the President. 

" I first proposed seeing Seward, to which he assented. . . . He and I 
drove to Willard's, where I left him, and went myself to Seward's. I told 
him at once what was in my mind that I thought the President and Came- 
ron were both willing that C. should go to Russia. He seemed to receive 
the matter as new, except so far as suggested by me last night. Wanted 
to know who would succeed Cameron. I said Holt and Stanton had been 
named ; that I feared Holt might embarrass us on the slavery question, and 
might not prove quite equal to the emergency; that Stanton was a good 
lawyer and full of energy, but I could not, of course, judge him as an 
executive officer as well as he (S) could, for he knew him when he was in 
Buchanan's cabinet. Seward replied that he saw much of him then ; that 
he was of great force, full of expedients, and thoroughly loyal. 

" Finally he agreed to the whole thing, and promised to go with me to 
talk with the President about it to-morrow. Just at this point Cameron 
came in with a letter from the President proposing his nomination to 
Russia in the morning ! He was quite offended, supposing the letter 
intended as a dismissal, and therefore discourteous. We both assured 
him it could not be so. . . . We went off together, I taking him to his house. 

" Before parting I told him what had pa sed between me and Seward 
concerning Stanton, with which he was gratified. I advised him to go 
to the President in the morning, express his thanks for the consideration 
with which his wishes, made known through me as well as by himself 
orally, had been treated, and tell him frankly how desirable it was to him 
that his successor should be a Pennsylvanian and should be Stanton. 

" I said I thought that his wish, supported, as it would be, by Seward 
and myself, would certainly be gratified, and told him that the President 
had already mentioned Stanton in a way which indicated that no objection 
on his part would be made. I said also that if he wished I would see 
Seward, and would go to the President, after he had left him, and urge the 
point. He asked, why not come in when we (he) should be there, and I 
assented to this. We parted, and I came home. 

" A day which may have and seemingly must have great bearing on 
affairs. Oh ! that my heart and life were so pure and right before God 
that I might not hurt our great cause. 

"I fear Mr. Seward may think Cameron's coming into his house pre- 
arranged, and that I was not dealing frankly. I feel satisfied, however, 
that I have actrd right and with just deference to all concerned, and have 
in no respect deviated from the truth." 



MR. LfNCOLN. l6l 

When he appointed, as general officers, some of the released 
prisoners from the first Bull Run, he afterwards explained to me 
that he did it as a recompense for their sufferings, unaware, no 
doubt, that in other armies they would have been brought before 
some tribunal to explain their capture. 

Soon after arriving in Washington the President one day 
sent for me to ask my opinion of Hooker, who was urged for 
appointment as a brigadier-general of volunteers, and stated 
that he wished me to regard the conversation as strictly confi- 
dential. I told him that Hooker had been a good soldier in 
Mexico, but that common report stated that he had fallen in 
California ; but that I had no personal knowledge of this, and 
I advised him to consult with officers who were in California 
with Hooker. He, however, gave him the appointment a few 
days later. Remembering that this conversation was sought by 
the President and that he desired me to regard it as confiden- 
tial, it was with no little surprise that I learned, after Antietam, 
that Hooker had been informed of the conversation, except of 
its confidential nature and that it was sought by the President. 

As before stated, when Stanton was made Secretary of War 
I knew nothing of the matter until the nomination had already 
gone to the Senate. Next day the President came to my house 
to apologize for not consulting me on the subject. He said that 
he knew Stanton to be a friend of mine and assumed that I 
would be glad to have him Secretary of War, and that he feared 
that if he told me beforehand " some of those fellows " would 
say that I had dragooned him into it. 

The evening before the order appeared finally relieving me 
from the command of the Army of the Potomac, the elder Mr. 
Frank Blair drove to the Soldiers' Home to dissuade the Presi- 
dent from relieving me, rumors being current that such a thing 
was in contemplation. After a long conversation Mr. Blair left 
with the distinct understanding that I was not to be relieved. 
Next morning the order appeared in the papers, and when Mr. 
Blair met the President in the course of the day the latter said : 
" Well, Mr. Blair, I was obliged to play shut-pan with you last 
night." Mr. Blair was my authority for this. 

Officially my association with the President was very close 
until the severe attack of illness in December, 1861. I was 
often sent for to attend formal and informal cabinet meetings, 



1 62 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

and at all hours whenever the President desired to consult with 
me on any subject ; and he often came to my house, frequently 
late at night, to learn the last news before retiring. His fame as 
a narrator of anecdotes was fully deserved, and he always had 
something apropos on the spur of the moment. 

Late one night, when he was at my house, I received a tele- 
gram from an officer commanding a regiment on the upper 
Potomac. The despatch related some very desperate fighting 
that had been done during the day, describing in magniloquent 
terms the severe nature of the contest, fierce bayonet-charges, 
etc., and terminated with a very small list of killed and wounded, 
quite out of proportion with his description of the struggle. 

The President quietly listened to my reading of the tele- 
gram, and then said that it reminded him of a notorious liar, 
who attained such a reputation as an exaggerator that he finally 
instructed his servant to stop him, when his tongue was running 
too rapidly, by pulling his coat or touching his feet. One day 
the master was relating wonders he had seen in Europe, and 
described a building which was about a mile long and a half- 
mile high. Just then the servant's heel came down on the nar- 
rator's toes, and he stopped abruptly. One of the listeners 
asked how broad this remarkable building might be ; the nar- 
rator modestly replied, " About a foot ! " 

I think he enjoyed these things quite as much as his lis- 
teners. 

Long before the war, when vice-president of the Illinois Cen- 
tral Railroad Company, I knew Mr. Lincoln, for he was one of 
the counsel of the company. More than once I have been with 
him in out-of-the-way county-seats where some important case 
was being tried, and, in the lack of sleeping accommodations, 
have spent the night in front of a stove listening to the unceas- 
ing flow of anecdotes from his lips. He was never at a loss, and 
I could never quite make up my mind how many of them he 
had really heard before, and how many he invented on the spur 
of the moment. His stories were seldom refined, but were al- 
ways to the point. 

The President ignored all questions of weather, state of 
roads, and preparation, and gave orders impossible of execu- 
tion. About the middle of Feb., 1862, the President having 
reluctantly consented to abandon his plan of operation for that 



THE PRESIDENT'S WAR ORDERS. 163 

suggested by me, preparations were begun for the collection of 
the necessary water transportation. On the 2yth of that month 
Mr. John Tucker, of Philadelphia, Assistant Secretary of War, 
was placed in charge of the procuring of the requisite steamers, 
etc., and performed his task with wonderful skill and energy. 
The President's War Order of March 8, 1862, "that any move- 
ment as aforesaid, en route for a new base of operations, which 
may be ordered by the geueral-in-chief, and which may be in- 
tended to move upon the Chesapeake Bay, shall begin to move 
upon the bay as early as the i8th March instant, and the 
general-in-chief shall be responsible that it moves as early as 
that day," was extraordinary, in view of the fact that the fur- 
nishing of transports was in no manner under my control, arid 
that the beginning of the movement must necessarily depend 
upon their arrival. 

When the operation by the lower Chesapeake was finally 
decided upon and approved by the corps commanders, it was 
distinctly understood that the movement would be made by 
the complete four corps, consisting of twelve divisions, plus the 
reserve artillery, engineer brigade, regular infantry and cavalry, 
and several cavalry regiments not assigned to the corps, and 
that I was authorized to form a division of 10,000 men from the 
troops in and near Fort Monroe and attach it to the active army. 
Moreover, we were assured of the active co-operation of the 
navy in reducing the batteries at Yorktown and Gloucester. 

As my story progresses it will appear that I was deprived 
of five out of the thirteen infantry divisions, with their batteries, 
and of nine regiments of cavalry, and that I never received the 
co-operation of the navy in reducing the batteries at Yorktown 
and Gloucester. 

On the 1 5th of March the aggregate present and absent 
under my command was about 233,578, taking as a basis the 
return of March i ; the number present for duty, including all 
extra-duty men, guards, etc., etc., was 203,213. Of these I pur- 
posed to leave behind, in Baltimore, Washington, and the Shen- 
andoah, an aggregate of 66,552, brought up by new arrivals to 
about 77,401 at the close of March, or, deducting Gen. Dix's 
command, 65,621, equal to about 57,091 present for duty, with 
the convalescent hospitals at hand to draw upon. 

Now, the estimate made of the necessary garrison of Wash- 



164 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

ington by the chiefs of engineers and artillery on the 24th of 
Oct., 1 86 1, was a little less than 34,000 men, including reserves, 
so that a force of a little over 23,000 men would have been left 
for the Shenandoah Valley much more than enough under the 
circumstances, if properly handled. 

I thus expected to take with me to the Peninsula a force of 
146,122 present for duty, to be increased by a division of 10,000 
formed from the troops at Fort Monroe a total of about 156,- 
ooo men. 

But the ist corps, Blenker's division, the expected Fort Mon- 
roe division, the cavalry, etc. (afterwards taken away), amounted 
to about 63,000 for duty, and reduced my paper force to 93,000, 
which, in consequence of leaving behind many men unfit for the 
field, was actually reduced to 85,000, not much more than one- 
half of what I expected. Making the proper deduction for extra- 
duty men, etc., there remained only about 70,000 effectives. 

Moreover, on the second day after I left Washington an order 
was issued breaking up all the recruiting rendezvous for volun- 
teers, and thus abruptly stopping all recruiting at the very time it 
was most necessary. 

I will anticipate somewhat the sequence of events, and state 
the manner in which these reductions of force were accom- 
plished. 

A few days before sailing for Fort Monroe I met the Presi- 
dent, by his appointment, on a steamer at Alexandria. He 
informed me that he was most strongly pressed to remove Blen- 
ker's German division from my command and assign it to Fre- 
mont, who had just been placed in command of the Mountain 
Department. He suggested several reasons against the proposed 
removal of the division, to all of which I assented. He then said 
that he had promised to talk to me about it, that he had fulfilled 
his promise, and that he would not deprive me of the division. 

On the 3ist of March, a few hours before I sailed, I was 
much surprised by the receipt of the following letter: 

" EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, March 31, 1862. 
" Maj.-Gen. McClellan : 

" MY DEAR SIR : This morning I felt constrained to order 
Blenker's division to Fremont ; and I write this to assure you 
that I did so with great pain, understanding that you would -wish 



THE PRESIDENT'S WAR ORDERS. 165 

it otherwise. If you could know the full pressure of the case 
I am confident that you would justify it, even beyond a mere 
acknowledgment that the commander-in-chief may order what he 
pleases. Yours very truly, 

" A. LINCOLN." 



To this it might be replied that the commander-in-chief has 
no right to order what he pleases ; he can only order what he is 
convinced is right. And the President had already assured me 
that he knew this thing to be wrong, and had informed me that 
the pressure was only a political one to swell Fremont's com- 
mand. 

I replied that I regretted the order and could ill-afford to 
lose 10,000 troops who had been counted upon in arranging the 
plan of campaign. In a conversation the same day I repeated 
this, and added my regret that any other than military considera- 
tions and necessities had been allowed to govern his decision. 

He then assured me that he would allow no other troops to 
be withdrawn from my command. 

Before I left for the field Fort Monroe and its dependencies 
had been placed under my command, and I was authorized to 
form a division of 10,000 men from the troops stationed there 
and add it to the Army of the Potomac, placing it under Mans- 
field. I arrived at Fort Monroe on the afternoon of the 2d of 
April, and on the 3d received a telegraphic order withdrawing 
Fort Monroe from my command and forbidding me to remove 
any of Gen. Ord's troops without his sanction. No reason has 
ever been given for this step, and I was thus not only deprived 
of 10,000 more troops, but also of the control of my immediate 
base of operations and supplies. 

On the afternoon of the 5th, the right and left wings of the 
army being under fire from Yorktown and the works on the line 
of the Warwick, I received the following telegram : 

"ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, April 4, 1862. 
" Gen. McClellan : 

"By direction of the President, General McDowell's army 
corps has been detached from the forces under your immediate 
command, and the general is ordered to report to the Secretary 
of War. Letter by mail. 

" L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General" 



1 66 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

In addition to the forces already enumerated, at least nine 
regiments of cavalry were withheld from me, and the order of 
April 3, discontinuing recruiting for the volunteers, rendered it 
impossible for me to make good the inevitable losses from disease 
and battle. 

The effect of these changes will appear as I resume the nar- 
rative of events. 



CHAPTER X. 

PRIVATE LETTERS, 
[Oct. i, 1 86 1, to March 12, 1862.] 

Oct. , 1 86 1. Yesterday rode to Chain Bridge, thence to 
Upton's Hill, and did not get back until after dark. ... I 
can't tell you how disgusted I am becoming with these wretched 
politicians. 

Oct. . . . . The enemy made some demonstrations up 
the river this morning, which prevented me from crossing the 
river until 1.30 ; then I rode to Munson's Hill, etc., and found 
everything going on well. We shall be ready by to-morrow to 
fight a battle there, if the enemy should choose to attack ; and 
I don't think they will care to run the risk. I presume I 
shall have to go after them when I get ready ; but this getting 
ready is slow work with such an administration. I wish I were 
well out of it. ... We almost expected a little row up the river 
yesterday, but it amounted to nothing. The enemy fired 112 
shots with artillery at our people at Great Falls, slightly grazing 
one man's arm and wounding a horse slightly. Fine shooting 
that ! They must learn to do better if they hope to accomplish 
anything. Some of our men have been behaving most atro- 
ciously lately in burning houses ; some eighteen have been 
burned in the last two or three days. I will issue an order 
to-day informing them that I will hang or shoot any found guilty 
of it, as well as any guards who permit it. Such things disgrace 
us and our cause. Our new position in advance is a fine one. 
It throws our camps into a fine, healthy country, with excel- 
lent drill-grounds and everything fresh and clean an infinite 
improvement over our old places, where the men had been stuck 
down close to the river for months. It removes them also further 
from the city, so they will be less liable to temptation. 

Oct. 2 (?) . . . Gen. Gibson's funeral takes place this morn-

1 68 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

ing. I am becoming daily more disgusted with this administra- 
tion -perfectly sick of it. If I could with honor resign I would 
quit the whole concern to-morrow ; but so long as I can be of 
any real use to the nation in its trouble I will make the sacrifice. 
No one seems able to comprehend my real feeling that I have 
no ambitious feelings to gratify, and only wish to serve my coun- 
try in its trouble, and, when this weary war is over, to return to 
my wife. . . . 

Oct. 6. ... I am quite sure that we shall spend some time 
here together after your recovery. Preparations are slow, and 
I have an infinite deal to do before my army is really ready to 
fight a great battle. Washington may now be looked upon as 
quite safe. They cannot attack it in front. My flanks are also 
safe, or soon will be. Then I shall take my own time to make 
an army that will be sure of success. . . . Gen. Scott did try to 
send some of my troops to Kentucky, but did not succeed. They 
shall not take any from here, if I can help it. The real fight- 
ing must be here : that in Kentucky will be a mere bagatelle. 
You need not be at all alarmed by any apprehensions you hear 
expressed. I have endeavored to treat Gen. Scott with the. 
utmost respect, but it is of no avail. ... I do not expect to 
fight a battle near Washington ; probably none will be fought 
until I advance, and that I will not do until I am fully ready. 
My plans depend upon circumstances. So soon as I feel that 
my army is well organized and well disciplined, and strong 
enough, I will advance and force the rebels to a battle in a field 
of my own selection. 

A long time must yet elapse before I can do this, and I 
expect all the newspapers to abuse me for delay ; but I will 
not mind that. 

No date. ... I must ride much every day, for my army 
covers much space. It is necessary for me to see as much as 
I can every day, and, more than that, to let the men see me and 
gain confidence in me. ... I started out about three this after- 
noon and returned at ten ; rode down to the vicinity of Alex- 
andria, and on my return (en route] received a despatch to the 
effect that the rebels at 6.30 this morning were breaking up 
their camps at Manassas whether to attack or retreat I do not 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 169 

yet know. If they attack they will in all probability be beaten, 
and the attack ought to take place to-morrow. I have made 
every possible preparation and feel ready for them. . . . 

Oct. 9. ... I have a long ride to take to-day ; will proba- 
bly advance our right some three or four miles by way of getting 
more elbow-room and crowding G. W. up a trifle. The more 
room I get the more I want, until by and by I suppose I shall 
be so insatiable as to think I cannot do with less than the whole 
State of Virginia. The storm has entirely changed the weather, 
and I am afraid may affect the health of the men for a few 
days ; for it is now cold and wet. The review of yesterday 
passed off very well ; it was a superb display, by far the fin- 
est ever seen on this continent, and rarely equalled anywhere. 
There were 104 guns in the review (a number greater than Lau- 
riston's famous battery at Wagram) and 5,500 cavalry. The 
ground was wet, so I did not venture to let them pass at a trot 
or gallop ; they passed only at a walk. ... I was tired out last 
night. My horse was young and wild, and nearly pulled my 
arm off. The cheering of the men made him perfectly frantic, 
and, as I had to keep my cap in my right hand, I had only my 
left to manage him. 

Oct. (10 ?). I have just time to write a very few lines before 
starting out. Yesterday I threw forward our right some four 
miles, but the enemy were not accommodating enough to give 
us a chance at them, so I took up a new position there and 
reinforced it by sending McCall over to that side. I am now 
going over again to satisfy myself as to the state of affairs, 
and perhaps edge up another mile or so, according to circum- 
stances. When I returned yesterday, after a long ride, I was 
obliged to attend a meeting of the cabinet at eight P.M., and was 
bored and annoyed. There are some of the greatest geese in 
the cabinet I have ever seen enough to tax the patience of 
Job. . , . 

Oct. (n ?). . . . I rode all over our new positions yesterday 
to make some little changes and correct errors, as well as to 
learn the ground more thoroughly myself. It rained most of 
the day, which did not add to the pleasure of the trip. Secesh 



I JO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

keeps quiet, wonderfully so. I presume he wants to draw me 
on to Manassas to repeat the Bull Run operation ; but I sha'n't 
go until ready. I may occupy Vienna in a few days, especially 
if he does not show himself in force ; but I am very well con- 
tented with our present positions, as places where we can drill 
and discipline the troops to great advantage. We have the men 
now in a fine open country, high and healthy, good clean fresh 
and green camp-grounds, and the morale of an advance. 

Oct. 14. What do you think I received as a present yester- 
day ? Some poor woman away up in the middle of New York 
sent me half a dozen pair of woollen socks I beg pardon, I see 
it is from Pennsylvania, not New York. I enclose the note. 

Oct. 1 6. . . . Just received a telegram to the effect that the 
rebels had attacked a small force we have in Harper's Ferry, and 
had been handsomely repulsed with the loss of quite a number 
of men and one gun. ... In front of us the enemy remain 
quiet, with the exception of occasional picket-firing. 

Oct. . ... I am firmly determined to force the issue with 
Gen. Scott. A very few days will determine whether his policy 
or mine is to prevail. He is for inaction and the defensive ; he 
endeavors to cripple me in every way ; yet I see that the news- 
papers begin to accuse me of want of energy. He has even com- 
plained to the War Department of my making the advance of 
the last few days. Hereafter the truth will be shown. 

Oct. 16. I have just been interrupted here by the President 
and Secretary Seward, who ha<J nothing very particular to say, 
except some stories to tell, which were, as usual, very perti- 
nent, and some pretty good. I never in my life met any one 
so full of anecdote as our friend. He is never at a loss for a 
story apropos of any known subject or incident. 

Oct. 19. Gen. Scott proposes to retire in favor of Halleck. 
The President and cabinet have determined to accept his retire- 
ment, but not in favor of Halleck. . . . The enemy have fallen 
back on Manassas, probably to draw me into the old error. I 
hope to make them abandon Leesburg to-morrow. 



PRIVA TE LETTERS. I ; I 

Oct. 20 or 21. ... I yesterday advanced a division to 
Dranesville, some ten miles beyond its old place, and feel 
obliged to take advantage of the opportunity to make numerous 
reconnoissances to obtain information as to the country, which 
is very beautiful at Dranesville, where I was yesterday. The 
weather is delightful. The enemy has fallen back to Centre- 
ville and Manassas, expecting us to attack there. My object in 
moving to Dranesville yesterday and remaining there to-day was 
to force them to evacuate Leesburg, which I think they did last 
night. 

Oct. 24. Have ridden more than forty miles to-day, and have 
been perfectly run down ever since I returned. 

Oct. 25. . . . How weary I am of all this business ! Care 
after care, blunder after blunder, trick upon trick. I am well- 
nigh tired of the world, and, were it not for you, would be fully 
so. That affair of Leesburg on Monday last was a horrible 
butchery. The men fought nobly, but were penned up by a 
vastly superior force in a place where they had no retreat. The 
whole thing took place some forty miles from here, without my 
orders or knowledge. It was entirely unauthorized by me, and 
I am in no manner responsible for it. 

Col. Baker, who was killed, was in command, and violated 
all military rules and precautions. Instead of meeting the ene- 
my with double their force and a good ferry behind him, he 
was outnumbered three to one and had no means of retreat. 
Cogswell is a prisoner ; he behaved very handsomely. Ray- 
mond Lee is also taken. I found things in great confusion when 
I arrived there. In a very short time order and confidence were 
restored. During the night I withdrew everything and every- 
body to this side ot the river, which, in truth, they should never 
have left. 

Oct. 26, 1.15 A.M. For the last three hours I have been at 
Montgomery Blair's, talking with Senators Wade, Trumbull, and 
Chandler about war matters. They will make a desperate effort 
to-morrow to have Gen. Scott retired at once ; until that is 
accomplished I can effect but little good. He is ever in my way, 
and I am sure does not desire effective action. I want to get 



172 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

through with the war as rapidly as possible. ... I go out soon 
after breakfast to review Porter's division, about five miles from 
here. 

Oct. 30. I know you will be astonished, but it is true, that 
I went this evening to a fandango. The regulars just in from 
Utah gave a little soiree to the other regulars ; music, a little 
dancing, and some supper. I went there intending to remain 
ten minutes, and did stay fully an hour and a half. I met Mrs. 
Andrew Porter, Mrs. Palmer and her mother, Mrs. Hancock, and 
several other army ladies. It was very pleasant to get among old 
acquaintances once more. 

Oct. 31. . . . You remember my wounded friend Col. 
Kelly, whom we met at Wheeling ? He has just done a very 
pretty thing at Romney thrashed the enemy severely, taken all 
their guns, etc. I am very glad to hear it. ... " Our George " 
they have taken it into their heads to call me. I ought to take 
good care of these men, for I believe they love me from the 
bottom of their hearts ; I can see it in their faces when I pass 
among them. I presume the Scott war will culminate this week. 
Whatever it may be, I will try to do my duty to the army and to 
the country, with God's help and a single eye to the right. I 
hope that I may succeed. I appreciate all the difficulties in my 
path : the impatience of the people, the venality and bad faith of 
the politicians, the gross neglect that has occurred in obtaining 
arms, clothing, etc. ; and, above all, I feel in my inmost soul how 
small is my ability in comparison with the gigantic dimensions of 
the task, and that, even if I had the greatest intellect that was 
ever given to man, the result remains in the hands of God. I 
do not feel that I am an instrument worthy of the great task, but 
I do feel that I did not seek it. It was thrust upon me. I was 
called to it ; my previous life seems to have been unwittingly 
directed to this great end ; and I know that God can accomplish 
the greatest results with the weakest instruments therein lies 
my hope. I feel, too, that, much as we in the North have erred, 
the rebels have been far worse than we. 

No date. I have just returned from a ride over the river, 
where I went pretty late, to seek refuge in Fitz Porter's camp. 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



173 



You would have laughed if you could have seen me dodge off. 
I quietly told the duke to get our horses saddled, and then we 
slipped off without escort or orderlies, and trotted away for Fitz- 
John's camp, where we had a quiet talk over the camp-fire. . . . 
I saw yesterday Gen. Scott's letter asking to be placed on the 
retired list and saying nothing about Halleck. The offer was 
to be accepted last night, and they propose to make me at once 
commander-in-chief of the army. I cannot get up any especial 
feeling about it. I feel the vast responsibility it imposes upon 
me. I feel a sense of relief at the prospect of having my own 
way untrammelled, but I cannot discover in my own heart one 
symptom of gratified vanity or ambition. 

Nov. 2, 1.30 A.M. I have been at work, with scarcely one 
minute's rest, ever since I arose yesterday morning nearly eight- 
een hours. I find " the army " just about as much disorganized 
as was the Army of the Potomac when I assumed command ; 
everything at sixes and sevens ; no system, no order, perfect 
chaos. I can and will reduce it to order. I will soon have it 
working smoothly. 

Nov. 3. I have already been up once this morning that was 
at four o'clock to escort Gen. Scott to the depot. It was pitch- 
dark and a pouring rain ; but with most of my staff and a 
squadron of cavalry I saw the old man off. He was very polite 
to me ; sent various kind messages to you and the baby ; so we 
parted. The old man said that his sensations were very peculiar 
in leaving Washington and active life. I can easily understand 
them ; and it may be that at some distant day I, too, shall totter 
away from Washington, a worn-out soldier, with naught to do 
but make my peace with God. The sight of this morning was a 
lesson to me which I hope not soon to forget. I saw there the 
end of a long, active, and ambitious life, the end of the career of 
the first soldier of his nation ; and it was a feeble old man scarce 
able to walk ; hardly any one there to see him off but his suc- 
cessor. Should I ever become vainglorious and ambitious, re- 
mind me of that spectacle. I pray every night and every 
morning that I may become neither vain nor ambitious, that I 
may be neither depressed by disaster nor elated by success, and 
that I may keep one single object in view the good of my 



174 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

country. At last I am the " major-general commanding the 
army." I do not feel in the least elated, for I do feel the 
responsibility of the position. And I feel the need of some 
support. I trust that God will aid me. 

Nov. . ... A deputation of thirty waited on me and 
presented me with that sword from the city of Philadelphia. It 
is certainly a very fine one. I listened meekly to a speech and 
replied in my usual way i.e., in very few words. I then had a 
collation I abominate the word, it is so steamboaty in the back 
parlor. Wormley did himself credit on the occasion, and got it 
up very well indeed. The President came in during the proceed- 
ings. . . . After that I came back and received quite a number 
of congratulatory calls ; then went to dine with Andrew Porter, 
where I had a very pleasant time Andrew and his wife, her 
brother, her sister-in-law, Seth, and myself. 

Nov. 7. I am very glad to learn that my order changed Gen. 
Scott's feelings entirely, and that he now says I am the best 
man and the best general that ever existed. 

No date. Yesterday I was so busily engaged in getting 
Halleck off to Missouri and Buell to Kentucky that I had but 
little time to look about me. 

Nov. 10. Yesterday worked at the office until noon and then 
started to review Porter's division. Got soaked and had a chill : 
all right this morning. Before breakfast, the President and 
Seward came in. 

Nov. n, 1-30 A.M. Went to Chase's at eight P.M. to meet 
some New York financiers ; left them in good spirits. Have 
just finished Halleck's instructions. 

Nov. , 1 86 1. You will have heard the glorious news from 
Port Royal. Our navy has covered itself with glory and cannot 
receive too much credit. The thing was superbly done and the 
chivalry well thrashed. They left in such haste that officers for- 
got even to carry away their swords. But one white man was 
found in Beaufort, and he drunk ! The negroes came flocking 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



175 



down to the river with their bundles in their hands, ready to take 
passage. There is something inexpressibly mouinful to me in 
that those poor, helpless, ignorant beings, with the wide world 
and its uncertainties before them ; the poor serf, with his little 
bundle, ready to launch his boat on the wide ocean of life he 
knows so little of. When I think of some of the features of 
slavery I cannot help shuddering. Just think for one moment, 
and try to realize that at the will of some brutal master you and 
I might be separated for ever ! It is horrible ; and when the day 
of adjustment comes I will, if successful, throw my sword into 
the scale to force an improvement in the condition of these poor 
blacks. I do think that some of the rights of humanity ought 
to be secured to the negroes. There should be no power to 
separate families, and the right of marriage ought to be secured 
to them. . . . 

Nov. 12, Last night the German division gave a grand torch- 
light procession and serenade. What little I saw of it was very 
fine, but I had to attend a pseudo cabinet meeting while it was 
in progress, so that I saw by no means the whole of it. Quite a 
party came here to see the performance. 

Nov. 17. ... I find that to-day is not to be a day of rest 
for me. This unfortunate affair of Mason and Slidell has come 
up, and I shall be obliged to devote the day to endeavoring to 
get our government to take the only prompt and honorable 
course of avoiding a war with England and France. ... It is 
sickening in the extreme, and makes me feel heavy at heart, 
when I see the weakness and unfitness of the poor beings who 
control the destinies of this great country. How I wish that 
God had permitted me to live quietly and unknown with you ! 
But His will be done ! I will do my best, try to preserve an 
honest mind, do my duty as best I may, and will ever continue 
to pray that He will give me that wisdom, courage, and strength 
that are so necessary to me now, and so little of which I possess. 

The outside world envy me, no doubt. They do not know 
the weight of care that presses on me. ... I will try again to 
write a few lines before I go to Stanton's to ascertain what the 
law of nations is on this Slidell and Mason seizure. ... I went 
to the White House shortly after tea. I then went to the Prince 



176 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

de Joinville's. We went up-stairs and had a long, confidential 
talk upon politics. The prince is a noble character, one whom 
I shall be glad to have you know well. He bears adversity so 
well and so uncomplainingly. I admire him more than almost 
any one I have ever met with. He is true as steel ; like all deaf 
men, very reflective ; says but little, and that always to the point. 
. . . After I left the prince's I went to Seward's, where I found 
the President again. . . . The President is honest and means 
well. As I parted from him on Seward's steps he said that it 
had been suggested to him that it was no more safe for me than 
for him to walk out at night without some attendant. I told 
him that I felt no fear ; that no one would take the trouble to 
interfere with me. On which he deigned to remark that they 
would probably give more for my scalp at Richmond than for 
his. . . . 

Nov. . . . . Went to the Prince de Joinville's, where I 
found Barry, Dahlgren, and the family. If it would at all com- 
fort you I might do what I have never done carry a pistol in 
my pocket, especially as I received two days since a lamb-like 
present of four revolvers of different sizes, bringing my private 
armory up to something like eleven pistols of various dimen- 
sions. What more can be asked of any one ? 

Nov. . Some infatuated individual sent me, a day or two 
ago, a " McClellan Polka." What in the world did he expect me 
to do with it ? Not to whistle or dance it, I hope. 

Nov. . ... I have been at work all day nearly on a let- 
ter to the Secretary of War (Cameron) in regard to future mili- 
tary operations. I have not been at home for some three hours, 
but am concealed at Stanton's to dodge all enemies in shape of 
" browsing " Presidents, etc. . . . 

i A.M. I am pretty thoroughly tired out. The paper is a 
very important one, as it is intended to place on record that I 
have left nothing undone to make this army what it ought to be, 
and that the necessity for delay has not been my fault. I have 
a set of men to deal with unscrupulous and false ; if possible 
they will throw whatever blame there is on my shoulders, and I 
do not intend to be sacrificed by such people. I still trust that 
the all-wise Creator does not intend our destruction, and that in 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 177 

His own good time He will free the nation from the men who 
curse it, and will restore us to His favor. I know that as a 
nation we have grievously sinned ; but I trust there is a limit to 
His wrath, and that ere long we will begin to experience His 

mercy I cannot guess at my movements, for they are not 

within my control. I cannot move without more means, and I 
do not possess the power to control those means. 

The people think me all-powerful. Never was there a greater 
mistake. I am thwarted and deceived by these incapables at 
every turn. 

I am doing all I can to get ready to move before winter sets 
in, but it now begins to look as if we were condemned to a win- 
ter of inactivity. If it is so the fault will not be mine ; there 
will be that consolation for my conscience, even if the world at 
large never knows it. ... 

I have one great comfort in all this that is, that I did not 
seek this position, as you well know ; and I still trust that God 
will support me and bear me out. He could not have placed me 
here for nothing. . . . 

Nov. 25. . . . After dinner yesterday rode over the river. 
I came back after dark in a driving snow-storm. ... It has 
cleared off since last night, and is quite cold to-day. It was a 
very disagreeable ride last night dark as pitch, roads bad, and 
the snow driving hard 

Nov. 27. . . . Went to a grave consultation at Secretary 
Chase's in regard to the reopening of the Baltimore and Ohio 
Railroad. . . . 

After the review of the regulars I went down to the river 
to see the volunteer pontoniers throw a bridge-train. I went 
through the usual routine of being presented to an infinite num- 
ber of ladies. Made a close inspection of the camp and of the 
men, and then returned. 

Nov. 30, 1 86 1. I was hard at work until half-past four, 
when I came back to dinner. Gen. Banks dined with me. 
When he left I had several business calls. At eight all the 
officers of the 4th Infantry, just returned from California, came 
to pay their respects. When they left I went to Com. Goldsbo- 
rough, where he, Fox, Prof. Bache, and myself remained in

serious consultation about naval and military movements until 
after midnight. 

Sandy Hook, near Harper s Ferry, Monday A.M., Feb. 27, 
1862. . . . Here I still am. I crossed the river as soon as 
the bridge was finished, and watched the troops pass. It was 
a magnificent spectacle, one of the grandest I ever saw. As 
soon as my horse and escort got over I rode out to the line of 
pickets and saw for myself that everything was right and ready 
for an attack. The position is a superb one. I got over about 
12 guns and 8,000 infantry before dark ; also a squadron of cav- 
alry. I heard in the afternoon a rumor that G. W. Smith was 
expected at Winchester with 15,000 men. Although I did not 
fully credit it, I nevertheless took all the military precautions 
necessary, and felt perfectly secure during the night. The ene- 
my are not now in sight, but I have sent out cavalry patrols that 
may bring in intelligence of value. It was after dark and 
raining hard when I recrossed the bridge. The narrow road 
was so completely blocked up that it was a very difficult matter 
to make one's way among tfce wagons. It rained hard and was 
very cold during the night. . . . Slept in a car ; I was up most 
of the night, telegraphing, etc. This morning it is blowing a 
hurricane, but the bridge stands well thus far. Burns's brigade 
came up during the night. I left them in the cars and crossed 
them this morning early. The wagons have gone over ; a regi- 
ment of cavalry is now crossing, another battery will follow, and 
I will have everything well cleared up before the arrival of Aber- 
crombie's brigade, which should be here by two o'clock. I will 
get it over before dark, also the heavy artillery and regular cav- 
alry, if it arrives. I hope to be able to occupy Charleston to- 
morrow and get Lander to Martinsburg. It will then require 
but a short time to finish matters here. The roads on the other 
side are good ; the country more open than near Washington. 
You have no idea how the wind is howling now a perfect tor- 
nado ; it makes the crossing of the river very difficult, and inter- 
feres with everything. I am anxious about our bridge. . . . 

Fairfax Court- House, March n, 1862. . . . None of our 
wagons came up until after I rode out this morning, so we got 
along as best we could last night. Some one lent me some blan-

kets, and somebody else a cot, so I was very well off. To-night 
I have my own bed. I started at about nine this morning and 
rode first to Centreville. We found there quite a formidable 
series of works, which would have been somewhat uncomfort- 
able for new troops to carry by storm. Thence I rode over hor- 
rid roads to the celebrated Manassas, which we found also 
abandoned. Thence to the battle-field of last July, and over 
pretty much the whole of it. Thence home via Stone Bridge 
and Centreville, reaching here about half-past eight. I rode 
Kentuck to-day, and as he was fretful he fatigued me very 
much, so that it is impossible for me to go to Washington 
to-night, notwithstanding your father's pressing telegram. I 
regret that the rascals are after me again. I had been foolish 
enough to hope that when I went into the field they would give 
me some rest, but it seems otherwise. Perhaps I should have 
expected it. If I can get out of this scrape you will never 
catch me in the power of such a set again. The idea of per- 
secuting a man behind his back ! I suppose they are now 
relieved from the pressure of their fears by the retreat of the 
enemy, and that they will increase in virulence. Well, enough 
of that ; it is bad enough for me to be bothered in that way 
without annoying you with it. The country which we passed 
to-day was very desolate. I think Manassas is the most deso- 
late and forbidding spot I ever beheld. They have not de- 
stroyed many of their winter-quarters, which are very well 
built and comfortable far more so than I expected to see 
them. From the great number of camps scattered about it is 
evident that they had a very large force here. They must 
have left in a great hurry, for they abandoned a great deal 
of baggage, tents, stores, ammunition, caissons, wagons, etc. 
It seems that the order was given very suddenly. They left 
on Sunday, except a rear-guard. It is said by " intelligent 
contrabands " and others that the men were very much dis- 
gusted and disheartened. . . . 



CHAPTER XI 

Events in and around Washington Ball's Bluff Harper's Ferry Stan- 
ton's trick Enemy's batteries on the Potomac. 

ON the Qth of Oct. McCall's division marched from Tennally- 
town to Langley, on the Virginia side of the Potomac. This 
addition to the forces already there enabled me to push recon- 
noissances more actively ; and as it was particularly desirable 
to obtain accurate information in regard to the topography of 
the country in front of our right, Gen. McCall was ordered to 
move on the i9th as far as Dranesville to cover the work of 
the topographical engineers directed to prepare maps of that 
region. On the 2oth Gen. Smith pushed out strong parties to 
Freedom Hill, Vienna, Flint Hill, Peacock Hill, etc., with a 
similar object. 

From his destination Gen. McCall sent the following 
despatch : 

"DRANESVILLE, Oct. 19, 1861, 6.30 P.M. 
" To Gen. McClellan : 

" I arrived here this morning. All is quiet. No enemy seen. 
Country for one mile beyond Difficult creek broken and woody. 
Bad country to manoeuvre. Nothing but skirmishing could be 
done by infantry. Artillery could not leave the road. One mile 
beyond Difficult creek the country becomes open ; some pretty 
battle-fields. Country high. I shall bivouac here to-night. 
Park is with me. 

" (Signed) GEO. A. McCALL." 

He remained near Dranesville during the whole of the 2oth, 
covering the operations of the topographical engineers. On the 
morning of the 2ist he sent me the following despatch: 

" CAMP NEAR DRANESVILLE, VA., 

Oct. 21, 1861, 6.30 A.M. 
" Maj.-Gen. Geo. B. McClellan: 

" GENERAL : In a couple of hours we shall have completed the 
plane-table survey to the ground I first occupied one and one-

half miles in front, and, by odometer or by observation, all the 
cross-roads this side of the point where we met Gen. Smith's par- 
ties, from the Alexandria pike to the L. and H. R. R., and the 
more northern ones from the pike to the river. 

" On the return march the plane-table will be at work on the 
Leesburg and Georgetown pike, and the side-roads to the river 
will be examined. . . . 

" Very respectfully, 

" GEO. A. McCALL, 

" Brig. -Gen" 

On the 1 2th of Oct. Gen. Stone telegraphed that he thought 
the enemy were entrenching between Conrad's Ferry and Lees- 
burg, about one mile from the town. In the morning of the 
i3th he telegraphed that the enemy had strengthened their force 
opposite Harrison's island by one or two regiments from below, 
and that much work was going on in the way of new batteries 
and lines, and strengthening old ones. At night on the same 
day he telegraphed that work had been done at Smart's Hill, 
that the pickets near Mason's island were largely reinforced, 
and that he anticipated an early attempt by the enemy to secure 
Mason's or Harrison's island, perhaps both, but probably the 
latter, commanded, as it was, by the bluffs on their side. 

On the 1 5th he telegraphed that there was considerable 
movement between the river and Leesburg apparently prepa- 
rations for resistance rather than attack. On the i8th, at 10.45 
P.M., he telegraphed that the enemy's pickets were withdrawn 
from most of the posts in our front ; that he had sent an officer 
over the river within two miles of Leesburg the same evening, 
and that he should push the reconnoissances farther the follow- 
ing day, if all remained favorable. 

Such was the state of affairs when, on the morning of the 
2oth, I received the following telegram from Gen. Banks's head- 
quarters : 

"DARNESTOWN, Oct. 20, 1861. 

" SIR : The signal station at Sugar Loaf telegraphs that the 
enemy have moved away from Leesburg. All quiet here. 

" R. M. COPELAND, 
" Gen. MARCY. Assist. Adj.-Gen" 

Whereupon I sent to Gen. Stone, at Poolesville, the following 
telegram : 



1 82 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

CAMP GRIFFIN, Oct. 20, 1861. 

Gen. McClellan desires me to inform you that Gen. McCall 
occupied Dranesville yesterday, and is still there. Will send out 
heavy reconnoissances to-day in all directions from that point. 
The general desires that you will keep a good look-out upon 
Leesburg, to see if this movement has the effect to drive them 
away. Perhaps a slight demonstration on your part would have 
the effect to move them. 

A, V. COLBURN, 

Assist. Adj. -Gen. 
Brig.-Gen. C. P. STONE, PoolesviUe. 

Deeming it possible that Gen. McCall's movement to Dranes- 
ville, together with the subsequent reconnoissances, might have 
the effect of inducing the enemy to abandon Leesburg, and the 
despatch from Sugar Loaf appearing to confirm this view, I 
wished Gen. Stone who had only a line of pickets on the river, 
the mass of his troops being out of sight of, and beyond range 
from, the Virginia bank to make some display of an intention 
to cross, and also to watch the enemy more closely than usual. 
I did not direct him to cross, nor did I intend that he should 
cross the river in force for the purpose of fighting. 

The above despatch was sent on the 2oth, and reached Gen. 
Stone as early as eleven A.M. of that day. I expected him to 
accomplish all that was intended on the same day ; and this he 
did, as will be seen from the following despatch, received at my 
headquarters in Washington from PoolesviUe on the evening of 

Oct. 20 : 



" Made a feint of crossing at this place this afternoon, and 
at the same time started a reconnoitring party towards Lees- 
burg from Harrison's island. The enemy's pickets retired to 
entrenchments. Report of reconnoitring party not yet received. 
I have means of crossing one hundred and twenty-five men once 
in ten minutes at each of two points. River falling slowly. 

' C. P. STONE, 

" Brig.-Gen. 
" Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

As it was not foreseen or expected that Gen. McCall would 
be needed to co-operate with Gen. Stone in any way, he had been 
directed to fall back from Dranesville to his original camp, near 
Prospect Hill, as soon as the required reconnoissances were com- 
pleted. 



BALLS BLUFF. 183 

Accordingly he left Dranesville, on his return, at about 8.30 
A.M. of the 2ist, reaching his old camp at about one P.M. 

In the meantime I was surprised to hear from Gen. Stone 
that a portion of his troops were engaged on the Virginia side 
of the river, and at once sent instructions to Gen. McCall to 
remain at Dranesville, if he had not left before the order reached 
him. 

The order did not reach him until his return to his camp at 
Prospect Hill. He was then ordered to rest his men, and hold 
his division in readiness to return to Dranesville at a moment's 
notice, should it become necessary. Similar instructions were 
given to other divisions during the afternoon. 

The first intimation I received from Gen. Stone of the real 
nature of his movements was in a telegram, as follows : 

" EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 11.10 A.M. 

" The enemy have been engaged opposite Harrison's island; 
our men are behaving admirably. 

" C. P. STONE, 

" Brig. -Gen. 
" Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

At two P.M. Gen. Banks's adjutant-general sent the follow- 
ing : 

" DARNESTOWN, Oct. 21, 1861, 2 P.M. 

" Gen. Stone safely crossed the river this morning. Some 
engagements have taken place on the other side of the river 
how important is not known. 

" R. M. COPELAND, 
"Act. Assist. Adjt.-Gen. 
"Gen. R. B. MARCY." 

Gen. Stone sent the following despatches : 

" EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 1861, 2 P.M. 
" There has been sharp firing on the right of our line, and 
our troops appear to be advancing there under Baker. The left, 
under Gorman, has advanced its skirmishers nearly one mile, 
and, if the movement continues successful, will turn the enemy's 
right. 

" C. P. STONE, 

" Brig.-Gen. 
"To Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 



184 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

" EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 1861, 2.20 P.M. 
" To Gen. Marcy : 

" We cross at Edward's Ferry in flat-boats these which we 
have built, capacity forty-five men each and in one canal-boat, 
capacity two hundred men ; at Harrison's island in four flat- 
boats and four row-boats. There is a road from Seneca to 
Edward's Ferry, and from Edward's Ferry to Leesburg ; also 
a road from opposite Seneca to the Leesburg road. The mount- 
ed men will be held in readiness. Firing pretty heavy on our 
right. . . . 

" C. P. STONE 



This was in reply to an inquiry as to his means of crossing 
and the roads, also directing him to hold mounted men ready to 
transmit frequent reports. 

" EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 1861, 4 P.M. 
" Nearly all my force is across the river. Baker on the right, 
Gorman on the left. Right sharply engaged. 

"C. P. STONE, 

"Brig-Gen. 
" To Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

"EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 1861, 6 P.M. 
" Have called on Banks for a brigade, and he has ordered up 
Hamilton's. I think it would be well to send up a division on 
the other side of the river. I think they have been reinforced. 

" C. P. STONE, 

" Brig. -Gen" 

The nearest division on the Virginia side (McCall's) was 
more than twenty miles from the scene of action, so that it could 
not have arrived before noon of the 22d too late to be of any 
service. Moreover, its line of march would have passed not 
more than eleven or twelve miles from the enemy's position at 
Centreville, and it would thus have been exposed to be cut off, 
unless supported by a general movement of the Army of the 
Potomac, which there was nothing to justify, according to the 
information at that time (6.30 P.M.) in my possession. The 
orders I had already sent to Banks seemed best adapted to the 
case, as the event proved. 



BALL'S BLUFF. 185 

"EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 1861, 6.45 P.M. 
" To Maj.-Gen. McClellan : 

" Col Baker has been killed at the head of his brigade, I go 
to the right at once. 

"C. P. STONE, 

"JBHg.-Gen" 

Gen. Stone was evidently misinformed, as Col. Baker had only 
one battalion of his brigade with him. 

" EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, 1861, 9.30 P.M. 
" To Gen. McClellan : 

" I am occupied in preventing further disaster, and try to 
get into a position to redeem. We have lost some of our best 
commanders Baker dead, Coggswell a prisoner or secreted. 
The wounded are being carefully and rapidly removed, and 
Gorman's wing is being cautiously withdrawn. Any advance 
from Dranesville must be made cautiously. All was reported 
going well up to Baker's death, but in the confusion following 
that the right wing was outflanked. In a few hours I shall, 
unless a night-attack is made, be in the same position as last 
night, save the loss of many good men. 

" C. P. STONE, 

"jBrig.-Gen." 

Although not fully informed of the state of affairs, I had, 
during the afternoon, as a precautionary measure, ordered Gen. 
Banks to send one brigade to the support of the troops at Harri- 
son's island, and to move with the other two to Seneca Mills, 
ready to support Gen. Stone, if necessary. The 9.30 P.M. de- 
spatch of Gen. Stone did not give me entire understanding of 
the state of the case. 

Aware of the difficulties and perhaps fatal consequences of 
attempting to recross such a river as the Potomac after a repulse, 
and from these telegrams supposing his whole force to be on the 
Virginia side, I sent the following telegram : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF POTOMAC, 

Oct. 21, 1861, 10.30 P.M. 
To Gen. C. P. Stone, Edward's Ferry : 

Entrench yourself on the Virginia side and await reinforce- 
ments, if necessary. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 



1 86 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY, 

Shortly after the following: 

To Gen. C, P. Stone : 

Hold your position on the Virginia side of the Potomac at 
all hazards. Gen. Banks will support you, with one brigade at 
Harrison's island and the other two at Seneca. Lander will be 
with you at daylight. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

P.S. Change the disposition of Gen. Banks's division, if you 
think it necessary, so as to send two brigades to Harrison's 
island instead of one. 



About the same time I sent the following : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

Oct. 21, 1861, 10.45 P.M. 
To Gen. N. P. Banks : 

Push forward your command as rapidly as possible, and put 
as many men over the river to reinforce Gen. Stone as you can 
before daylight. Gen. Stone is directed to hold his command on 
the Virginia side of the Potomac at all hazards, and informed that 
you will support him. You will assume command when you join 
Gen. Stone. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

The following despatches were next received : 

"EDWARD'S FERRY, Oct. 21, n P.M. 
" To Maj.-Gen. McClellan: 

" We hold the ground half a mile back of Edward's Ferry on 
Virginia shore. Harrison's island has parts of thirteen com- 
panies, only seven hundred (700) men, and will soon be rein- 
forced by one hundred fresh men, besides what support Hamil- 
ton brings. I cover the shore opposite this with guns, and am 
disposing others to help the defence of Harrison's. I think the 
men will fight well. Entrenchments ordered this morning. 

"C. P. STONE, 

" Brig. -Gen." , 

"HEADQUARTERS, SENECA MILLS, 

Oct. 21, ii P.M. 
" To Gen. McClellan : 

" Arrived here at nine and a half o'clock. Gen. Stone tele-

graphs for whole division immediately. Col. Baker is killed, and 
some trouble exists on his right. We go at once. 

" N. P. BANKS, 
' ' Maj. - Gen. Com ma tiding Division . ' ' 

Hamilton's brigade arrived at midnight, and Gen. Banks with 
the remainder of his division reached Edward's Ferry at three 
A.M. of the 22d. He found Gen. Stone on the Maryland side, and 
reported that he ascertained that at no time had more than one- 
third of his (Gen. Stone's) troops crossed. Assuming command, 
and consulting with the generals present, he telegraphed me the 
facts, and received a reply directing him to send over men enough 
to hold the opposite side, with orders to entrench themselves ; 
all of which was done. During the afternoon there was a skir- 
mish, in the course of which Gen. Lander was wounded. 

Meanwhile Gen. Banks had collected all the canal-boats to 
be found, in order to increase the means of transportation. I 
reached Edward's Ferry during the evening of the 226. and 
assumed command. Passing through Poolesville, I first learned 
the actual condition of affairs and the details of what had 
occurred, and sent the following : 

POOLESVILLE, Oct. 22, 5.30 P.M. 
To President Lincoln : 

From what I learn here the affair of yesterday was a more 
serious disaster than I had supposed. Our loss in prisoners and 
killed was severe. I leave at once for Edward's Ferry. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 

The following extract from the evidence of Gen. Stone before 
the "Committee on the Conduct of the f War" on the 5th of Jan., 
1862, will throw further light on this occurrence : 

Gen. Stone says he received the order from my headquarters 
to make a slight demonstration at about eleven o'clock A.M. on the 
2oth, and that, in obedience to that order, he made the demon- 
stration on the evening of the same day. 

In regard to the reconnoissance on the 2ist, which resulted in 
the battle of Ball's Bluff, he was asked the following questions : 

Question. " Did this reconnoissance originate with yourself, or 
had you orders from the general-in-chief to make it ? " 



I 88 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

To which he replied : " It originated with myself the recon- 
noissance." 

Question. " The order did not proceed from Gen. McClel- 
lan ? " 

Answer. " I was directed the day before to make a demon- 
stration ; that demonstration was made the day previous." 

Question. " Did you receive an order from the general-in- 
chief to make the reconnoissance ? " 

Answer. " No, sir." 

Making a personal examination on the 23d, I found that the 
position on the Virginia side at Edward's Ferry was not a ten- 
able one, but did not think it wise to withdraw the troops by 
daylight. I therefore caused more artillery to be placed in posi- 
tion on the Maryland side to cover the approaches to the ground 
held by us, and crossed the few additional troops that the high 
wind permitted us to get over, so as to be as secure as possible 
against any attack during the day. 

Up to six o'clock I kept my intention secret, all supposing 
that I intended to advance on Leesburg. My object was not to 
discourage the command in the event of their being attacked. 
At six o'clock I sent to Gen. Stone, then on the Virginia side 
of the river, the detailed instructions for the withdrawal of the 
troops during the night. Before nightfall all the precautions 
were taken to secure an orderly and quiet passage of the troops 
and guns. 

The movement was commenced soon after dark, under the 
personal supervision of Gen. Stone, who received the order for 
the withdrawal at 7.15 P.M. By four A.M. of the 24th everything 
had reached the Maryland shore in safety. A few days after- 
wards I received information, which seemed to be authentic, to 
the effect that large bodies of the enemy had been ordered from 
Manassas to Leesburg to cut off our troops on the Virginia side. 
Their timely withdrawal probably prevented a still more serious 
disaster. Gen. Stone's report of this battle and his testimony 
before the Committee on the Conduct of the War furnish fur- 
ther details. 

Gen. Banks's division deserves great credit for its rapid night- 
march to the relief of General Stone. On the 24th the total 
loss in killed, wounded, and missing was reported as 680, with 
stragglers constantly coming in. 



BALL'S BLUFF. . 189 

The true story of the affair of Ball's Bluff is, in brief, as fol- 
lows : 

One of Gen. Stone's officers, Capt. Philbrick, of the i5th 
Mass., thought that he had discovered a camp of the enemy 
about one mile beyond Harrison's island in the direction of 
Leesburg. Having completed the feint of crossing made in the 
course of the 2oth, Gen. Stone at 10.30 P.M. of the same day 
issued his orders for the surprise of the supposed camp at day- 
break of the 2 1 st. Col. Devens, of the i5th Mass., was entrusted 
with the duty, with four companies of his regiment. Col. Lee, of 
the 20th Mass., was directed to replace Col. Devens in Harrison's 
island with four companies of his own regiment, one of which 
was to pass over to the Virginia shore and hold the heights there 
to cover Col. Devens's return. Col. Devens was directed to 
"attack the camp at daybreak, and, having routed, to pursue 
them as far as he deems prudent, and to destroy the camp, if 
practicable, before returning." " He will make all the observa- 
tions possible on the country, will, under all circumstances, keep 
his command well in hand, and not sacrifice this to any supposed 
advantages of rapid pursuit. Having accomplished this duty, 
Col. Devens will return to his present position, unless he shall see 
one on the Virginia side near the river which he can undoubtedly 
hold until reinforced, and one which can be successfully held 
against largely superior numbers. In which case he will hold on 
and report." 

In obedience to these orders Col. Devens crossed about mid- 
night with five companies (instead of four), numbering about 300 
men, and halted until daybreak in an open field near the bluffs 
bordering the shore. While there he was joined by Col. Lee with 
100 men of the 2oth Mass., who halted here to cover his return. 

At daybreak he advanced about a mile towards Leesburg, and 
then discovered that the supposed camp did not exist. After 
examining the vicinity and discovering no traces of the enemy, 
he determined not to return at once, but at about half-past six 
A.M. sent a non-commissioned officer to report to Gen. Stone 
that he thought he could remain where he was until reinforced. 
At about seven o'clock a company of hostile riflemen were ob- 
served on the right, and a slight skirmish ensued. A company of 
cavalry being soon observed on the left, the skirmishers were 
drawn back to the woods, and, after waiting half an hour for 



IQO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

attack, the command was withdrawn to the position held by Col. 
Lee ; but, after again scouting the woods, Col. Devens returned 
to his advanced position. About eight o'clock the messenger 
returned from Gen. Stone with orders for Col. Devens to remain 
where he was, and that he would be reinforced. The messenger 
was again sent back to report the skirmish that had taken place. 
Col. Devens then threw out skirmishers and awaited reinforce- 
ments. At about ten o'clock the messenger again returned with 
the information that Col. Baker would soon arrive with his bri- 
gade and take command. Between nine and eleven Col. Devens 
was joined by Lieut.-Col. Learned with the remainder of the 
1 5th, bringing up his command to 28 officers and 625 men. 

About midday Col. Devens learned that the enemy were 
gathering on his left, and about half-past twelve or one he was 
strongly attacked ; and as he was in great danger of being out- 
flanked, and no reinforcements had arrived, at about a quarter- 
past two he fell back to the bluff, where he found Col. Baker, 
who directed him to take the right of the position he proposed to 
occupy ; the centre and left being composed of about 300 men of 
the 2oth Mass., under Col. Lee, and a battalion of the California 
regiment about 600 strong. Two howitzers and a 6-pounder 
were also in line. 

At about three o'clock the enemy attacked in force, the 
weight of his attack being on our centre and left. At about 
four our artillery was silenced, and Col. Devens was ordered to 
send two of his companies to support the left of our line ; shortly 
after he learned that Col. Baker had been killed. Col. Coggswell 
then assumed command, and, after a vain attempt to cut his way 
through to Edward's Ferry, was obliged to give the order to 
retreat to the river-bank and direct the men to save themselves 
as best they could. 

I have gone thus much into detail because at the time I was 
much criticised and blamed for this unfortunate affair, while I 
was in no sense responsible for it. 

Early in 1862 it was determined to attempt the reopening of 
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as far eastward from Cumber- 
land as circumstances would justify. 

Gen. F. W. Lander was ordered to cover this operation from 
Cumberland towards Hancock, and on the 5th of Jan. reached 
Hancock en route to his destination. He found Jackson on the 



GENERAL LANDER. 

opposite bank of the Potomac, tearing up rails, etc. Shortly 
after his arrival Lander was summoned by Jackson to surrender ; 
this, of course, was a mere act of bravado, for it is not probable 
that Jackson had the slightest intention of crossing the river. 
The enemy fired a few shells into Hancock, doing little or no 
damage. Gen. Banks sent reinforcements to Hancock under 
Gen. Williams, who remained in that vicinity for some time. 
Jackson now moved towards Bloomery Gap and Romney, whither 
Lander was ordered to go. The force at Romney being insuffi- 
cient to hold the place and its communications, Lander was 
instructed to fall back to the mouth of Patterson's creek, where 
he awaited the arrival of reinforcements now on the way to him. 

Finding it difficult to procure supplies, and not venturing to 
attack Lander in his position, Jackson fell back from Romney to 
Unger's Store with the mass of his force about the 23d of Jan. 
About the 5th of Feb. Lander obliged him to evacuate Romney 
entirely. 

Lander now moved his headquarters to the Paw Paw Tunnel, 
from which position he covered the reconstruction of the Balti- 
more and Ohio Railroad, which was reopened from the west to 
Hancock on the i4th of Feb. On the i3th he made a very dash- 
ing attack upon a party of the enemy at Bloomery Gap, taking 
several prisoners and dispersing the rest. 

Notwithstanding the severe illness from which he suffered, 
Lander remained at Paw Paw, covering the railroad and keeping 
the country clear of the enemy, until the 28th of Feb., when he 
was ordered to move to Bunker Hill to co-operate with Gen. 
Banks, then at Charlestown, covering the rebuilding of the rail- 
road as he advanced. While engaged in preparing to execute 
this order his disease assumed a more violent form, and on the 
2d of March this gallant officer breathed his last. On some 
occasions during this brief campaign I was obliged to check 
Lander rather abruptly for attempting to assume control over 
troops not under his command, and for endeavoring to initiate 
some very rash movements when the great risk could not be coun- 
terbalanced by the very faint chances of success. These errors 
arose partly from inexperience, and also, no doubt, from the 
effects of the malady which so soon terminated his life. 

These occurrences did not change my feeling towards him, 
and I doubt whether they influenced his for me. 



192 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

I had often observed to the President and to members of the 
cabinet that the reconstruction of this railway could not be under- 
taken until we were in a condition to fight a battle to secure it. 
I regarded the possession of Winchester and Strasburg as neces- 
sary to cover the railway in the rear, and it was not till the month 
of February that I felt prepared to accomplish this very desirable 
but not vital purpose. 

The whole of Banks's division and two brigades of Sedgwick's 
division were thrown across the river at Harper's Ferry, leaving 
one brigade of Sedgwick's division to observe and guard the 
Potomac from Great Falls to the mouth of the Monocacy. A 
sufficient number of troops of all arms were held in readiness 
in the vicinity of Washington, either to march via Leesburg or 
to move by rail to Harper's Ferry, should this become necessary 
in carrying out the objects in view. 

The subjoined Notes from a communication subsequently 
addressed to the War Department will sufficiently explain the 
conduct of these operations : 

NOTES. 

When I started for Harper's Ferry I plainly stated to the 
President and Secretary of War that the chief object of the ope- 
ration would be to open the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad by 
crossing the river in force at Harper's Ferry ; that I had col- 
lected the material for making a permanent bridge by means of 
canal-boats ; that, from the nature of the river, it was doubtful 
whether such a bridge could be constructed ; that if it could 
not I would at least occupy the ground in front of Harper's 
Ferry, in order to cover the rebuilding of the railroad bridge ; 
and finally, when the communications were perfectly secure, 
move on Winchester. 

When I arrived at the place I found the bateau bridge 
nearly completed ; the holding-ground proved better than had 
been anticipated ; the weather was favorable, there being no 
wind. I at once crossed over the two brigades which had 
arrived, and took steps to hurry up the other two, belonging 
respectively to Banks's and Sedgwick's divisions. The difficulty 
of crossing supplies had not then become apparent. That night 
I telegraphed for a regiment of regular cavalry and four bat- 
teries of heavy artillery to come up the next day (Thursday), 
besides directing Keyes's division of infantry to be moved up 
on Friday. 

Next morning the attempt was made to pass the canal-boats 



HARPER'S FERRY. 



193 



through the lift-lock, in order to commence at once the con- 
struction of a permanent bridge. It was then .found for the 
first time that the lock was too small to permit the passage of 
the boats, it having been built for a class of boats running on 
the Shenandoah canal, and too narrow by some four or six 
inches for the canal-boats. The lift-locks, above and below, 
are all large enough for the ordinary boats. I had seen them at 
Edward's Ferry thus used. It had always been represented to 
the engineers by the military railroad employees and others that 
the lock was large enough, and, the difference being too small 
to be detected by the eye, no one had thought of measuring it or 
suspected any difficulty. I thus suddenly found myself unable 
to build the permanent bridge. A violent gale had arisen, which 
threatened the safety of our only means of communication ; the 
narrow approach to the bridge was so crowded and clogged with 
wagons that it was very clear chat, under existing circumstances, 
nothing more could be done than to cross over the baggage 
and supplies of the two brigades. Of these, instead of being 
able to cross both during the morning, the last arrived only in 
time to go over just before dark. It was evident that the troops 
under orders would only be in the way, should they arrive, and 
that it would not be possible to subsist them for a rapid march 
on Winchester. It was therefore deemed necessary to counter- 
mand the order, content ourselves with covering the reopen- 
ing of the railroad for the present, and in the meantime use 
every exertion to establish, as promptly as possible, depots of 
forage and subsistence on the Virginia side to supply the troops 
and enable them to move on Winchester independently of the 
bridge. The next day (Friday) I sent a strong reconnoissance 
to Charlestown, and, under its protection, went there myself. 
I then determined to hold that place, and to move the troops 
composing Lander's and Williams's commands at once on Mar- 
tinsburg and Bunker Hill, thus effectually covering the recon- 
struction of the railroad. 

Having done this, and taken all the steps in my power 
to insure the rapid transmission of supplies over the river, I 
returned to this city, well satisfied with what had been accom- 
plished. While up the river I learned that the President was 
dissatisfied with the state of affairs ; but, on my return here, 
understood from the Secretary of War that upon learning the 
whole state of the case the President was fully satisfied. I con- 
tented myself, therefore, with giving to the secretary a brief 
statement, about as I have written it here ; he did not even 
require that much of me. He was busy ; I troubled him as 
little as possible, and immediately went to work at other impor- 
tant affairs. 

The design aimed at was entirely accomplished, and the 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

railroad was in running order before I started for the Penin- 
sula. As a demonstration against his left flank this movement 
had much to do with the enemy's evacuation of his position at 
Manassas on the 8th and Qth of March ; and I should state 
that I made the movement unwillingly, because I anticipated 
precisely that effect, and did not wish them to move from 
Manassas until I had fairly commenced the movement to the 
lower Chesapeake. But the pressure was so strong that I could 
not resist it ; and this was no doubt the best and easiest way 
to force the navigation of the lower Potomac, which the admin- 
istration laid so much stress upon. They had neither the cour- 
age nor the military insight to understand the effect of the plan 
I desired to carry out. 

Immediately upon my return from Harper's Ferry I called 
upon the secretary and handed him the memorandum referred 
to in the "Notes" just given, expressing a desire to explain the 
matter personally to the President. The secretary said that 
the President now understood the whole affair, but that he would 
hand him my memorandum. He told me, a day or two after- 
wards, that he had done so, and that the President was entirely 
satisfied with my conduct, and desired me not to mention the 
subject to the President. I was foolish enough to believe him, 
and acted accordingly. The following telegrams will aid in giv- 
ing the true state of the case : 

''WASHINGTON, Feb. 28, 1862. 
" Gen. McClellan : 

" What do you propose to do with the troops that have 
crossed the Potomac ? 

"E. M. STANTON, 

" Sec. of War." 

To this I replied : 

SANDY HOOK, Feb. 28, 1862. 
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Sec. of War: 

Your despatch received. I propose to occupy Charlestown 
and Bunker Hill, so as to cover the rebuilding of the railway, 
while I throw over the supplies necessary for an advance in 
force. I have quite men enough to accomplish this. I could 
not at present supply more. 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 



HARPER'S FERRY. 



195 



On the same day I telegraphed to the President as follows : 

It is impossible for many days to do more than supply the 
troops now here and at Charlestown. We could not supply a 
movement to Winchester for many days, and had I more troops 
here they would have been at a loss for food on the Virginia 
side. I know that I have acted wisely and that you will cheer- 
fully agree with me when I explain. I have arranged to estab- 
lish depots on that side, so we can do what we please. I have 
secured opening road. 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.- Gen. Commanding. 

On the same day I telegraphed to Gen. Lander as follows : 

We hold Charlestown. As soon as possible please occupy 
Bunker Hill and communicate with Banks at Charlestown. Scout 
well towards Winchester. Push the repairs of the railway 
rapidly. Get free of this business. I want you with me in 
another direction. 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 

It was a part of Mr. Stanton's policy only too well carried 
out to prevent frequent personal interviews between the Presi- 
dent and myself ; he was thus enabled to say one thing to the 
President and exactly the opposite to me. A few days later, on 
the 8th of March, the President sent for me at an early hour in 
the morning, about half-past seven, and I found him in his office. 
He appeared much concerned about something, and soon said 
that he wished to talk with me about "a very ugly matter." I 
asked what it was ; and, as he still hesitated, I said that the 
sooner and more directly such things were approached the better. 

He then referred to the Harper's Ferry affair (the boats being 
too wide for the lift-locks, etc.), upon which I found that the 
secretary had deceived me when he said that the President was 
satisfied. I told him what had passed between the secretary and 
myself (as related above), at which he was much surprised. He 
told me that he had never heard of my memorandum or of any 
explanation on my part. I then gave him my statement of the 
matter, with which he expressed himself entirely satisfied. 

He then adverted to the more serious or ugly matter, and 
now the effects of the intrigues by which he had been sur- 
rounded became apparent. He said that it had been repre- 



196 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

sented to him (and he certainly conveyed to me the distinct 
impression that he regarded these representations as well found- 
ed) that my plan of campaign (which was to leave Washington 
under the protection of a sufficient garrison, its numerous 
well-built and well-armed fortifications, and the command of 
Banks, then in the Shenandoah Valley, and to throw the whole 
active army suddenly by water from Annapolis and Alexandria 
to the forts on James river, and thence by the shortest route 
upon Richmond) was conceived with the traitorous intent of 
removing its defenders from Washington, and thus giving over 
to the enemy the capital and the government, thus left defence- 
less. 

It is difficult to understand that a man of Mr. Lincoln's intel- 
ligence could give ear to such abominable nonsense. I was 
seated when he said this, concluding with the remark that it did 
look to him much like treason. Upon this I arose, and, in a 
manner perhaps not altogether decorous towards the chief magis- 
trate, desired that he should retract the expression, telling him 
that I could permit no one to couple the word treason with my 
name. He was much agitated, and at once disclaimed any idea 
of considering me a traitor, and said that he merely repeated 
what others had said, and that he did not believe a word of 
it. I suggested caution in the use of language, and again said 
that I would permit no doubt to be thrown upon my intentions ; 
whereupon he again apologized and disclaimed any purpose of 
impugning my motives. 

I then informed him that I had called a meeting of the gene- 
rals of division for that day with reference to the proposed attack 
upon the enemy's Potomac batteries, and suggested that my plan 
should be laid before them in order that he might be satisfied. 
This was done, and I heard no more of treason in that con- 
nection. 

Before leaving this subject I will call attention to the fact 
that my official report contained the statement that the secretary 
had assured me of the President's approval of my action when I 
returned from the upper Potomac, and that this assertion was 
never denied. Moreover, no other statement made in the memo- 
randum was ever denied or objected to either by the President or 
the secretary ; and that memorandum shows very clearly that 
there was no ground of dissatisfaction with my conduct, but that 






BATTERIES ON THE POTOMAC. 



197 



I did precisely what I told them I should do under given cir- 
cumstances. 

In my official report I have given all necessary information 
as to the reasons which prevented an attack upon the enemy's 
batteries on the Potomac. I will here repeat only that careful 
reconnoissances and a full consideration of the matter led to the 
inevitable conclusion that although we might, at a greater or less 
sacrifice of life, carry and destroy, any particular battery, we 
could prevent the construction of permanent batteries and the 
employment of rifled field-batteries only by a general movement 
of the army to drive the enemy entirely behind the Rappahan- 
nock and flapidan, after a general action ; and that it would 
then be necessary to hold the lines of those rivers in force or 
continue the campaign by the overland route. 

I did not regard the inconvenience resulting from the pre- 
sence of the enemy's batteries on the Potomac as sufficiently 
great to justify the direct efforts necessary to dislodge them, 
especially since it was absolutely certain that they would evacu- 
ate all their positions as soon as they became aware of the move- 
ment to the James and York rivers. 

It was therefore with the greatest reluctance that I made the 
arrangements required to carry out the positive orders of the 
government, and it was with great satisfaction that I found 
myself relieved from the necessity of making what I knew to be 
a false and unnecessary movement. 

When the enemy abandoned his position on the 8th and pth 
of March, the roads were still in such a condition as to make the 
proposed movement upon the batteries impracticable. Before 
this time I had strongly and repeatedly urged upon the Navy 
Department the propriety of hastening the completion of the 
Monitor, that she might be sent to the Potomac to try her hand 
upon the batteries on its banks. As the reason for this I urged 
that it was well to try her qualities under fire, when necessary 
repairs and alterations could readily be made, rather than to 
send her immediately to New Orleans, as had been intended. 
It is a little singular that the effect of my urgency was to hasten 
her completion, so that she arrived in Hampton Roads in season 
to check the operations of the Merrimac. 



CHAPTER XII. 

Review of the situation McClellan succeeds Scott in command of all the 
armies Their condition ; general disorganization ; no plan for the 
war McClellan's plans for the whole war Simultaneous movements 
throughout the country Orders to Burnside for North Carolina expe- 
dition ; to Halleck and Buell for operations in the West ; to Butler 
for the New Orleans expedition Halleck and Grant Correspon- 
dence of McClellan and Grant. 

I DO not know that any one worthy of attention has ques- 
tioned the manner in which was performed the task of convert- 
ing the unorganized, defeated, and dispirited remains of Mc- 
Dowell's Bull Run command into the Army of the Potomac 
an army which so long bore on its bayonets the life and honor 
of the nation. 

Everything was to be done. An army was to be created 
ab initio out of nothing. Raw material there was, but it was 
completely raw, and was to be fashioned into shape. Private 
soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, regiments, brigades, 
divisions, army corps, armies, with all their staff corps, were to 
be organized and instructed, not merely on paper, but in effec- 
tive reality. 

Small arms, field-guns, siege and garrison artillery, ammuni- 
tion, equipments, camp-equipage, bridges, ambulances, baggage 
and supply trains, tents, clothing all these wonderful instru- 
ments and impedimenta of a modern army were to be fabricat- 
ed ; and not only fabricated, but so made that it would be pos- 
sible to use them : so strong as to withstand a heavy strain, so 
light that they could be handled. It added to the difficulty of 
the task that no army approaching in magnitude that now re- 
quired had ever existed on this continent, so that our own expe- 
rience was not of much avail in the crisis so suddenly upon us. 

In fact, one of the greatest obstacles I encountered at this 
time was the difficulty of drawing some of the heads of depart- 
ments out of the old ruts, and convincing them that what was 

eminently appropriate for five or ten thousand men was often 

198 






WORK TO BE DONE. 



199 



an absurdity or impossibility for ten or twenty times those num- 
bers. Besides all this and going on pan passu with it all was 
the irresistible and pressing necessity of so fortifying Washing- 
ton as to provide for its immediate and future safety ; so that 
the active army of operations should not necessarily be tied 
down to it as its base of operations and be unable to uncover 
it without endangering its security. 

More yet than this, the work was to be done in the face of a 
victorious enemy, whose outposts were within rifle-shot of our 
own and in sight of the capital ; the only communications of 
the army and the government passing, as far as to the Sus- 
quehanna, through a people of very doubtful loyalty. 

Moreover, the government was utterly ignorant of military 
affairs and incapable of judging the necessities of the situation ; 
too often actuated by mere motives of partisan expediency in- 
stead of patriotic resolve. The people, also, were ignorant of 
war, and sure to be urged to clamorous and senseless impatience 
by a partisan press. 

Finally, I was not only unsupported, but sometimes thwarted 
by Gen. Scott, whose views often differed from my own. Under 
these circumstances I had only my own unwavering sense of 
right to sustain me. In spite of all threats and clamors I 
quietly persevered in the course I knew to be necessary for 
the safety of the nation, regardless of the result to my per- 
sonal fortunes. 

The work was accomplished, and I know of no case in his- 
tory where so great a task was so thoroughly performed in so 
brief a period. 

It certainly was not- till late in Nov., 1861, that the Army of 
the Potomac was in any condition to move, nor even then were 
they capable of assaulting entrenched positions. By that time 
the roads had ceased to be practicable for the movement of 
armies, and the experience of subsequent years proved that 
no large operations could be advantageously conducted in that 
region during the winter season. 

Any success gained at that time in front of Washington could 
not have been followed up, and a victory would have given us 
the barren possession of the field of battle, with a longer and 
more difficult line of supply during the rest of the winter. If 
the Army of the Potomac had been in condition to move before 



2OO McCLELLAJ\TS OWN STORY. 

winter, such an operation would not have accorded with the 
general plan I had determined upon after succeeding Gen. 
Scott as general in command of the armies. 

On Nov. i, 1 86 1, the following private letter was received 
from the President : 

" Private. 

" EXECUTIVE MANSION, 

Nov. i, 1861. 
"Maj.-Gen. Geo. B. McClellan : 

" MY DEAR SIR : Lieut.-Gen. Scott having been, upon his own 
application, placed on the list of retired officers, with his advice, 
and the concurrence of the entire cabinet, I have designated you 
to command the whole army, You will, therefore, assume this 
enlarged duty at once, conferring with me so far as necessary. 
" Yours truly, 

" A. LINCOLN. 

"P.S. For the present let Gen. Wool's command be excepted. 

"A. L." 

Immediately after succeeding Gen. Scott in the chief com- 
mand of all the armies of the United States I arranged in my 
own mind the general plans for the operations of the ensuing year. 
I soon ascertained that more remained to be done in the West 
than in the East to bring the armies to a state of efficiency, and to 
that end did all in my power during the autumn and winter. 

Until my own sphere of command and responsibility was 
extended from the Army of the Potomac to all the armies, I 
supposed that some general plan of operations existed, but now 
learned that there was none such, and that utter disorganization 
and want of preparation pervaded the Western armies. I had 
supposed that they were nearly, if not quite, in condition to act, 
but found that I was mistaken. 

Even if the Army of the Potomac had been in condition to 
undertake a campaign in the autumn of 1861, the backward state 
of affairs in the West would have made it unwise to do so ; for on 
no sound military principle could it be regarded as proper to 
operate on one line alone while all was quiescent on the others, 
as such a course would have enabled the enemy to concentrate 
everything on the one active army. Again, if, within a week or 
two of the first Bull Run, it had been possible to advance and 
defeat the Confederate army at Manassas, the moral effect might

have justified the attempt, even were it impossible to follow up 
the victory ; but after the lapse of some months it would have 
been foolish to advance unless prepared to follow up a victory 
and enter upon a campaign productive of definite results. 

Early in Sept., 1861, Gens. W. T. Sherman and G. H. Thomas 
had been taken from my command and ordered to report to Gen, 
Robert Anderson, just placed in command of Kentucky. Before 
many weeks Anderson was relieved, in consequence of failing 
health, and Sherman succeeded to his duties. 

In October he became very much depressed and took an 
exceedingly gloomy view of the situation. He called for 200,000 
men a force entirely out of the power of the government to sup- 
ply at that time. On the 2d of Nov. he requested me to order 
Halleck, Buell, Stevens, and some officers of experience to Ken- 
tucky, stating that the importance of his department was beyond 
all estimate. 

On the 3d, after giving in detail the position of the troops, 
about 25,000, he says : " Our forces are too small to do good 
and too large to sacrifice." 

On the 4th he telegraphed to me : " The publication of Adj.- 
Gen. Thomas's report impairs my influence. I insist upon being 
relieved to your army, my old brigade. Please answer." 

On the 6th he telegraphed me : "... If Simon Buckner 
crosses Green river by the practicable fords, of which there 
are many at wide marks, may get in McCook's rear. Look at 
map between camp and Louisville. Two roads, one by Bards- 
town and other by mouth of Salt river. The great danger is in 
stripping Ohio and Indiana of troops and putting them on this 
side with no retreat. The enemy also threatens the lower river 
at Owensboro, where I have nothing but unorganized volun- 
teers." 

I have not a copy of the telegram, but my memory is clear 
that he also asked permission to fall back across the Ohio to 
prevent being cut off. 

I knew the condition of affairs well enough to be satisfied not 
only that there was no danger that the enemy would cross the 
Ohio river, but also that, if he were mad enough to do so, he 
would never get back, and believed that the State could be held 
with the troops then in it. Therefore I gladly and promptly 
acquiesced in Sherman's request to be relieved, and sent Buell 



2O2 McCLELLAK'S OWN STORY. 

to replace him, ordering Sherman to report to Halleck for duty. 
On Buell's arrival he found a complete state of disorganization ; 
not only so, but that nothing was being done to mend the matter, 
and no steps being taken to prepare the troops for the field. A 
total lack of system prevailed, and everything was allowed to run 
on as best it could. The new commander at once made himself 
felt, and justified the propriety of his appointment by the skill 
and energy with which he devoted himself to the task of bring- 
ing order and efficiency out of chaos and helplessness. Buell 
found no difficulty in holding his own in Kentucky, and drove 
the enemy out of Kentucky and out of the capital of Tennessee 
as soon as he had received and organized the reinforcements, 
which were provided as rapidly as possible, and which Sherman 
would have received in due course ; and, having accomplished 
the first part of his task, still found means to rescue Grant and 
Sherman from defeat at Shiloh with the army he had so recently 
created. 

In my letters of instruction to Gen. Buell, Nov. 7 and 12, 
1 86 1 (hereafter given), I advised his remaining on the defen- 
sive for the moment, on the direct line to Nashville, and that he 
should throw the mass of his forces, by rapid marches via Cum- 
berland Gap or Walker's Gap, on Knoxville, in order to occupy 
the railroad at that point to prevent its use by the Confederates, 
and to rally to us the loyal citizens of that region. Buell found 
it impossible to carry out these instructions, on account of the 
unprepared condition of the troops, the state of the roads, and 
lack of means of transportation. 

About the same time I sent Halleck to Missouri to relieve 
Gen. Fremont in the command of that department. I instructed 
him to fortify and garrison some important points in the interior, 
and to concentrate the mass of his troops on or near the Missis- 
sippi for such ulterior operations as might prove necessary. 

I determined to expedite the preparations of the Western 
armies as much as possible during the winter, and as early as 
practicable in the spring throw them forward ; commencing their 
advance so much earlier than that of the Army of the Potomac 
as to engage all the Confederate Western forces on their own 
ground, and thus prevent them from reinforcing their army in 
front of Richmond. 

As early as the beginning of Dec., 1861, I had determined not 



NORTH CAROLINA COAST. 203 

to follow the line of operations leading by land from Washing- 
ton to Richmond, but to conduct a sufficient force by water to 
Urbana, and thence by a rapid march to West Point, hoping thus 
to cut off the garrison of Yorktown and all the Confederates in 
the Peninsula ; then, using the James river as a line of supply, to 
move the entire Army of the Potomac across that river to the 
rear of Richmond. 

In pursuance of this plan I did not propose disturbing the 
Confederate forces at Manassas and Centreville, but, while steadi- 
ly pushing forward the fortifications of Washington and the in- 
struction and organization of the Army of the Potomac, I 
desired to hold them there to the last moment, and especially 
until the Urbana movement was well in process of execution. 

There was no possible military reason for disturbing them, 
and it best answered my purposes to keep them where they were. 
I was not apprehensive of any attack by them after the first few 
weeks. Their presence served to keep my men on the qui vive. 
The skirmishes which necessarily occurred gave experience of 
fire and taught watchfulness. They covered no ground in front 
of Richmond furnishing supplies needed by either party. They 
had the longest and most difficult line of supply that they could 
have. 

Early in December this plan was so far matured that, finding 
Secretary Chase seriously troubled in his financial operations by 
the uncertainty as to military operations, I went one day to his 
private office in the Treasury building and of my own volition 
confidentially laid my plans before him. He was delighted, said 
it was a most brilliant conception, and thanked me most cordially 
for the confidence I had thus reposed in him. 

Meanwhile the preparations for operations on the lower At- 
lantic and Gulf coasts were progressing slowly but satisfactorily. 
Early in January Gen. Burnside received his final instructions for 
the expedition to the coast of North Carolina. The general pur- 
poses of this expedition were to control the navigation of the 
sounds on the North Carolina coast, thus cutting off the supplies 
of Norfolk by water, and at the same time covering the left flank 
of the main army when operating against Richmond by the line 
of James river, the reduction of New Berne, Beaufort, and 
Wilmington, which would give us the double advantage of pre- 
venting blockade-running at those points and of enabling us 



2O4 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

to threaten or attack the railways near the coast, upon which 
Richmond largely depended for supplies. All of these objects 
were promptly accomplished except the capture of Wilmington. 
Had I remained in chief command I should have proceeded to 
its capture as soon as practicable after the fall of Fort Macon, 
which took place April 26, 1862. 

Towards the end of Feb., 1862, I also gave Gen. Butler his 
final instructions for the capture of New Orleans. This was 
accomplished, chiefly by the gallant action of the naval forces, 
about the ist of May. Gen. Butler was ordered to secure all the 
approaches to New Orleans and open his communications with 
the column coming down the Mississippi. This being accom- 
plished, Mobile, Pensacola, Galveston, etc., were to be attacked 
and occupied in turn. 

About the middle of February I instructed Gen. T. W. Sher- 
man to undertake the siege of Fort Pulaski and to occupy Fer- 
nandina, also directing him to study the problem of the reduc- 
tion of Charleston and its defences. 

By means of these various expeditions, carried out to their 
legitimate consequences, I hoped, without the employment of any 
very large land force, to occupy the important harbors on the 
coast, in order to reduce blockade-running to a minimum, and 
thus essentially cut off the very valuable assistance the Confede- 
rates, in return for their cotton, received from abroad in the 
way of arms, ammunition, clothing, and other necessary supplies 
which their own country produced either not at all or in wholly 
insufficient quantities. In addition to this most vital purpose, 
the possession of these important points on the coast would 
enable us to interfere seriously with the use of all railroads near 
the sea, give us new bases of operation from which either to 
make independent expeditions inland or to furnish new and short 
lines of supply to any main army moving parallel with the coast, 
while at the same time considerable numbers of the Confederate 
forces were occupied in watching them. 

The following letters, and a subsequent paper addressed to 
the Secretary of War, sufficiently indicate the nature of those 
combinations : 



COAST EXPEDITION. 205 

TO THE SECRETARY OF WAR. 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6, 1861. 

SIR : I have the honor to suggest the following proposition, 
with the request that the necessary authority be at once given me 
to carry it out : To organize a force of two brigades of five regi- 
ments each, of New England men, for the general service, but 
particularly adapted to coast service ; the officers and men to be 
sufficiently conversant with boat-service to manage steamers, sail- 
ing-vessels, launches, barges, surf-boats, floating batteries, etc. 
To charter or buy for the command a sufficient number of pro- 
pellers or tug-boats for transportation of men and supplies, the 
machinery of which should be amply protected by timber ; the 
vessels to have permanent, experienced officers from the mer- 
chant service, but to be manned by details from the command. 
A naval officer to be attached to the staff of the commanding 
officer. The flank companies of each regiment to be armed with 
Dahlgren boat-guns, and carbines with waterproof cartridges ; 
the other companies to have such arms as I may hereafter desig- 
nate ; to be uniformed and equipped as the Rhode Island regi- 
ments are. Launches and floating batteries with timber para- 
pets of sufficient capacity to land or bring into action the entire 
force. 

The entire management and organization of the force to be 
under my control, and to form an integral part of the Army 
of the Potomac. 

The immediate object of this force is for operations in the 
inlets of Chesapeake bay and the Potomac. By enabling me thus 
to land troops at points where they are needed, this force can 
also be used in conjunction with a naval force operating against 
points on the sea-coast. This coast division to be commanded 
by a general officer of my selection ; the regiments to be organ- 
ized as other land forces ; the disbursements for vessels, etc., to 
be made by the proper department of the army upon the requi- 
sitions of the general commanding the division, with my approval. 

I think the entire force can be organized in thirty days ; and 
by no means the least of the advantages of this proposition is the 
fact that it will call into the service a class of men who would 
not otherwise enter the army. 

You will immediately perceive that the object of this force is 
to follow along the coast and up the inlets and rivers the move- 
ments of the main army when it advances. 

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

G. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 
Hon. SIMON CAMERON, 

Secretary of War. 



2O6 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Owing chiefly to the difficulty in procuring the requisite ves- 
sels and adapting them to the special purposes contemplated, this 
expedition was not ready for service until Jan., 1862. Then in 
the chief command, I deemed it best to send it to North Caro- 
lina, with the design indicated in the following letter : 

TO GEN. BURNSIDE. 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7, 1862. 

GENERAL : In accordance with verbal instructions heretofore 
given you, you will, after uniting with Flag-officer Goldsborough 
at Fort Monroe, proceed under his convoy to Hatteras inlet, 
where you will, in connection with him, take the most prompt 
measures for crossing the fleet over the Bulkhead into the waters 
of the sound. Under the accompanying general order constitut- 
ing the Department of North Carolina, you will assume command 
of the garrison at Hatteras inlet, and make such dispositions in 
regard to that place as your ulterior operations may render nec- 
essary, always being careful to provide for the safety of that very 
important station in any contingency. 

Your first point of attack will be Roanoke island and its 
dependencies. It is presumed that the navy can reduce the 
batteries on the marshes and cover the landing of your troops on 
the main island, by which, in connection with a rapid movement 
of the gunboats to the northern extremity as soon as the marsh- 
battery is reduced, it may be hoped to capture the entire garrison 
of the place. Having occupied the island and its dependencies, 
you will at once proceed to the erection of the batteries and 
defences necessary to hold the position with a small force. 
Should the flag-officer require any assistance in seizing or hold- 
ing the debouches of the canal from Norfolk, you will please 
afford it to him. 

The commodore and yourself having completed your arrange- 
ments in regard to Roanoke island and the waters north of it, you 
will please at once make a descent on New Berne, having gained 
possession of which and the railroad passing through it, you will 
at once throw a sufficient force upon Beaufort and take the steps 
necessary to reduce Fort Macon and open that port. When you 
seize New Berne you will endeavor to seize the railroad as far west 
as Goldsborough, should circumstances favor such a movement. 
The temper of the people, the rebel force at hand, etc., will go 
far towards determining the question as to how far west the rail- 
road can be safely occupied and held. Should circumstances 
render it advisable to seize and hold Raleigh, the main north and 
south line of railroad passing through Goldsborough should be so 
effectually destroyed for considerable distances north and south 



ORDERS TO GEN. HALLECK. 



207 



of that point as to render it impossible for the rebels to use it to 
your disadvantage. A great point would be gained, in any event, 
by the effectual destruction of the Wilmington and Weldon Rail- 
road. 

I would advise great caution in moving so far into the interior 
as upon Raleigh. Having accomplished the objects mentioned, 
the next point of interest would probably be Wilmington, the 
reduction of which may require that additional means shall be 
afforded you. I would urge great caution in regard to proclama- 
tions. In no case would I go beyond a moderate joint proclama- 
tion with the naval commander, which should say as little as pos- 
sible about politics or the negro ; merely state that the true issue 
for which we are fighting is the preservation of the Union and 
upholding the laws of the general government, and stating that 
all who conduct themselves properly will, as far as possible, be 
protected in their persons and property. 

You will please report your operations as often as an oppor- 
tunity offers itself. 

With my best wishes for your success, I am, etc., etc., 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 
Maj. - Gen. Commanding -in- Chief. 

Brig.-Gen. A. E. BURNSIDE, 

Commanding Expedition* 

The following letters of instruction were sent to Gens. Hal- 
leek, Buell, Sherman, and Butler ; and I also communicated ver- 
bally to these officers my views in full regarding the field of 
operations assigned to each, and gave them their instructions as 
much in detail as was necessary at that time : 



TO GEN. HALLECK. 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. n, 1861. 

GENERAL : In assigning you to the command of the Depart- 
ment of Missouri it is probably unnecessary for me to state that 
I have entrusted to you a duty which requires the utmost tact 
and decision. 

You have not merely the ordinary duties of a military com- 
mander to perform, but the far more difficult task of reducing 
chaos to order, of changing probably the majority of u& person- 
nel of the staff of the department, and of reducing to a point of 
economy consistent with the interests and necessities of the 
State a system of reckless expenditure and fraud perhaps un- 
heard of before in the history of the world. 

You will find in your department many general and staff 



208 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

officers holding illegal commissions and appointments not recog- 
ized or approved by the President or Secretary of War. You 
will please at once inform these gentlemen of the nullity of their 
appointment, and see that no pay or allowances are issued to 
them until such time as commissions may be authorized by the 
President or Secretary of War. 

If any of them give the slightest trouble, you will at once 
arrest them and send them, under guard, out of the limits of 
your department, informing them that if they return they will be 
placed in close confinement. You will please examine into the 
legality of the organization of the troops serving in the depart- 
ment. When you find any illegal, unusual, or improper organiza- 
tions, you will give to the officers and men an opportunity to 
enter the legal military establishment under general laws and 
orders from the War Department, reporting in full to these 
headquarters any officer or organization that may decline. 

You will please cause competent and reliable staff officers to 
examine all existing contracts immediately, and suspend all pay- 
ments upon them until you receive the report in each case. 
Where there is the slightest doubt as to the propriety of the 
contract you will be good enough to refer the matter, with full 
explanation, to these headquarters, stating in each case what 
would be a fair compensation for the services or materials 
rendered under the contract. Discontinue at once the recep- 
tion of material or services under any doubtful contract. Arrest 
and bring to prompt trial all officers who have in any way vio- 
lated their duty to the government. In regard to the political 
conduct of affairs, you will please labor to impress upon the 
inhabitants of Missouri and the adjacent States that we are 
fighting solely for the integrity of the Union, to uphold the 
power of our national government, and to restore to the nation 
the blessings of peace and good order. 

With respect to military operations, it is probable, from the 
best information in my possession, that the interests of the gov- 
ernment will be best served by fortifying and holding in conside- 
rable strength Rolla, Sedalia, and other interior points, keeping 
strong patrols constantly moving from the terminal stations, and 
concentrating the mass of the troops on or near the Mississippi, 
prepared for such ulterior operations as the public interests may 
demand. 

I would be glad to have you make as soon as possible a per- 
sonal inspection of all the important points in your department, 
and report the result to me. I cannot too strongly impress upon 
you the absolute necessity of keeping me constantly advised of 
the strength, condition, and location of your troops, together with 
all facts that will enable me to maintain that general direction of 
the armies of the United States which it is my purpose to exer- 
cise. I trust to you to maintain thorough organization, disci-

pline, and economy throughout your department. Please inform 
me as soon as possible of everything relating to the gunboats now 
in process of construction, as well as those completed. 

The militia force authorized to be raised by the State of Mis- 
souri for its defence will be under your orders. 
I am, general, etc., etc., 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 
Maj.-Gen. Commanding U. S. A. 
Maj.-Gen. H. W. HALLECK, U. S. A., 

Commanding Department of Missouri. 

TO GEN. BUELL. 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7, 1861. 

GENERAL : In giving you instructions for your guidance in 
command of the Department of the Ohio I do not design to 
fetter you. I merely wish to express plainly the general ideas 
which occur to me in relation to the conduct of operations there. 
That portion of Kentucky west of the Cumberland river is by its 
position so closely related to the States of Illinois and Missouri 
that it has seemed best to attach it to the Department of Mis- 
souri. Your operations there, in Kentucky, will be confined to 
that portion of the State east of the Cumberland river. I trust 
I need not repeat to you that I regard the importance of the ter- 
ritory committed to your care as second only to that occupied 
by the army under my immediate command. It is absolutely 
necessary that we shall hold all the State of Kentucky ; not only 
that, but that the majority of its inhabitants shall be warmly in 
favor of our cause, it being that which best subserves their inte- 
rests. It is possible that the conduct of our political affairs in 
Kentucky is more important than that of our military operations. 
I certainly cannot overestimate the importance of the former. 
You will please constantly to bear in mind the precise issue for 
which we are fighting ; that issue is the preservation of the Union 
and the restoration of the full authority of the general govern- 
ment over all portions of our territory. We shall most readily 
suppress this rebellion and restore the authority of the govern- 
ment by religiously respecting the constitutional rights of all. I 
know that I express the feelings and opinion of the President 
when I say that we are fighting only to preserve the integrity of 
the Union and the constitutional authority of the general gov- 
ernment. 

The inhabitants of Kentucky may rely upon it that their 
domestic institutions will in no manner be interfered with, and 
that they will receive at our hands every constitutional protec- 
tion. I have only to repeat that you will in all respects care- 
fully regard the local institutions of the region in which you 



2 1 o MCCLELLAND s o WN STOR v. 

command, allowing nothing but the dictates of military necessity 
to cause you to depart from the spirit of these instructions. 

So much in regard to political considerations. The military 
problem would be a simple one could it be entirely separated 
from political influences ; such is not the case. Were the popu- 
lation among which you are to operate wholly or generally hos- 
tile, it is probable that Nashville should be your first and princi- 
pal objective point. It so happens that a large majority of the 
inhabitants of Eastern Tennessee are in favor of the Union ; it 
therefore seems proper that you should remain on the defensive 
on the line from Louisville to Nashville, while you throw the 
mass of your forces, by rapid marches by Cumberland Gap or 
Walker's Gap, on Knoxville, in order to occupy the railroad at 
that point, and thus enable the loyal citizens of Eastern Tennes- 
see to rise, while you at the same time cut off the railway com- 
munication between Eastern Virginia and the Mississippi. It will 
be prudent to fortify the pass before leaving it in your rear. 

Brig.-Gen. D. C. BUELL. 

TO GEN. BUELL. 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 12, 1861. 

GENERAL: Upon assuming command of the department I 
will be glad to have you make as soon as possible a careful 
report of the condition and situation of your troops, and of the 
military and political condition of your command. The main 
point to which I desire to call your attention is the necessity of 
entering Eastern Tennessee as soon as it can be done with rea- 
sonable chances of success, and I hope that you will, with the 
least possible delay, organize a column for that purpose, suffi- 
ciently guarding at the same time the main avenues by which 
the rebels may invade Kentucky. Our conversations on the sub- 
ject of military operations have been so full, and my confidence 
in your judgment is so great, that I will not dwell further upon 
the subject, except to urge upon you the necessity of keeping 
me fully informed as to the state of affairs, both military and 
political, and your movements. In regard to political matters, 
bear in mind that we are fighting only to preserve the integrity of 
the Union and to uphold the power of the general government ; 
as far as military necessity will permit, religiously respect the 
constitutional rights of all. Preserve the strictest discipline 
among the troops, and, while employing the utmost energy in 
military movements, be careful so to treat the unarmed inhabi- 
tants as to contract, not widen, the breach existing between us 
and the rebels. 

I mean by this that it is the desire of the government to 
avoid unnecessary irritation by causeless arrests and persecution 



ORDERS TO GEN. SHERMAN. 2 I I 

of individuals. Where there is good reason to believe that per- 
sons are actually giving aid, comfort, or information to the ene- 
my, it is, of course, necessary to arrest them ; but I have always 
found that it is the tendency of subordinates to make vexatious 
arrests on mere suspicion. You will find it well to direct that 
no arrest shall be made except by your order or that of your 
generals, unless in extraordinary cases, always holding the party 
making the arrest responsible for the propriety of his course. It 
should be our constant aim to make it apparent to all that their 
property, their comfort, and their personal safety will be best pre- 
served by adhering to the cause of the Union. 

If the military suggestions I have made in this letter prove to 
have been founded on erroneous data, you are, of course, per- 
fectly free to change the plans of operations. 

Brig.-Gen. D. C. BUELL, 

Commanding Department of the Ohio. 

TO GEN. T. W. SHERMAN. 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14, 1862. 

GENERAL : Your despatches in regard to the occupation of 
Dafuskie island, etc., were received to-day. I saw also to-day, 
for the first time, your requisition for a siege-train for Savannah. 

After giving the subject all the consideration in my power 
I am forced to the conclusion that, under present circumstances, 
the siege and capture of Savannah do not promise results com- 
mensurate with the sacrifices necessary. When I learned that it 
was possible for the gunboats to reach the Savannah river above 
Fort Pulaski, two operations suggested themselves to my mind as 
its immediate results : 

First. The capture of Savannah by a coup de main, the 
result of an instantaneous advance and attack by the army and 
navy. 

The time for this has passed, and your letter indicates that 
you are not accountable for the failure to seize the propitious 
moment, but that, on the contrary, you perceived its advantages. 

Second. To isolate Fort Pulaski, cut off its supplies, and at 
least facilitate its reduction by a bombardment. 

Although we have a long delay to deplore, the second course 
still remains open to us ; and I strongly advise the close blockade 
of Pulaski, and its bombardment as soon as the 1 3-inch mortars 
and heavy guns reach you. I am confident you can thus reduce 
it. With Pulaski you gain all that is really essential : you obtain 
complete control of the harbor, you relieve the blockading fleet, 
and render the main body of your force disposable for other 
operations. 

I do not consider the possession of Savannah worth a siege 



212 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

after Pulaski is in our hands. But the possession of Pulaski is 
of the first importance. The expedition to Fernandina is well, 
and I shall be glad to learn that it is ours. 

But, after all, the greatest moral effect would be produced by 
the reduction of Charleston and its defences. There the rebel- 
lion had its birth ; there the unnatural hatred of our government . 
is most intense ; there is the centre of the boasted power and 
courage of the rebels. 

To gain Fort Sumter and hold Charleston is a task well 
worthy of our greatest efforts and considerable sacrifices. That 
is the problem I would be glad to have you study. Some time 
must elapse before we can be in all respects ready to accomplish 
that purpose. Fleets are en route and armies in motion which 
have certain preliminary objects to accomplish before we are 
ready to take Charleston in hand. But the time will before long 
arrive when I shall be prepared to make that movement. In the 
meantime it is my advice and wish that no attempt be made 
upon Savannah, unless it can be carried with certainty by a coup 
de main. 

Please concentrate your attention and forces upon Pulaski 
and Fernandina. St. Augustine might as well be taken by way 
of an interlude while awaiting the preparations for Charleston. 
Success attends us everywhere at present. 
Very truly yours, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

Gen. T. W. SHERMAN, 

Commanding at Port Royal, etc. 

TO GEN. BUTLER. 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23, 1862. 

GENERAL : You are assigned to the command of the land 
forces destined to co-operate with the navy in the attacks upon 
New Orleans. You will use every means to keep your destina- 
tion a profound secret, even from your staff officers, with the 
exception of your chief of staff and Lieut. Weitzell, of the engi- 
neers. The force at your disposal will consist of the first thirteen 
regiments named in your memorandum handed to me in person, 
the 2ist Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and 6th Michigan (old and good 
regiments from Baltimore). 

The 2ist Indiana, 4th Wisconsin, and 6th Michigan will await 
your orders at Fort Monroe. 

Two companies of the 2ist Indiana are well drilled as heavy 
artillery. The cavalry force already en route for Ship island will 
be sufficient for your purposes. 

After full consultation with officers well acquainted with the. 



ORDERS TO GEN, BUTLER. 



213 



country in which it is proposed to operate, I have arrived at the 
conclusion that two (2) light batteries fully equipped, and one 
(i) without horses, will be all that are necessary. 

This will make your force about 14,400 infantry, 275 cavalry, 
580 artillery ; total, 15,255 men. The commanding general of 
the Department of Key West is authorized to loan you, tem- 
porarily, two regiments, Fort Pickens can probably give you 
another, which will bring your force to nearly 18,000. 

The object of your expedition is one of vital importance the 
capture of New Orleans. The route selected is up the Missis- 
sippi river, and the first obstacle to be encountered (perhaps the 
only one) is in the resistance offered by Forts St. Philip and 
Jackson. It is expected that the navy can reduce these works ; 
in that case you will, after their capture, leave a sufficient garri- 
son in them to render them perfectly secure ; and it is recom- 
mended that, on the upward passage, a few heavy guns and some 
troops be left at the pilot station (at the forks of the river) to 
cover a retreat in the event of a disaster. These troops and guns 
will, of course, be removed as soon as the forts are captured. 

Should the navy fail to reduce the works you will land your 
forces and siege-train, and endeavor to breach the works, silence 
their fire, and carry them by assault. 

The next resistance will be near the English Bend, where 
there are some earthen batteries. Here it may be necessary for 
you to land your troops and co-operate with the naval attack, 
although it is more than probable that the navy unassisted can 
accomplish the result. If these works are taken the city of New 
Orleans necessarily falls. In that event it will probably be best 
to occupy Algiers with the mass- of your troops, also the eastern 
bank of the river above the city. It may be necessary to place 
some troops in the city to preserve order ; but if there appears to 
be sufficient Union sentiment to control the city, it may be best 
for purposes of discipline to keep your men out of the city. 

After obtaining possession of New Orleans it will be neces- 
sary to reduce all the works guarding its approaches from the 
east, and particularly to gain the Manchac pass. 

Baton Rouge, Berwick bay, and Fort Livingston will next 
claim your attention. 

A feint on Galveston may facilitate the objects we have in 
view. I need not call your attention to the necessity of gaining 
possession of all the rolling stock you can on the different rail- 
ways, and of obtaining control of the roads themselves. The 
occupation of Baton Rouge by a combined naval and land force 
should be accomplished as soon as possible after you have gained 
New Orleans. Then endeavor to open your communication with 
the northern column by the Mississippi, always bearing in mind 
the necessity of occupying Jackson, Mississippi, as soon as you 
Qiin safely do so, either after or before you have effected the 



214 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

junction. Allow nothing to divert you from obtaining full 
possession of all the approaches to New Orleans. When that 
object is accomplished to its fullest extent it will be necessary to 
make a combined attack on Mobile, in order to gain possession 
of the harbor and works, as well as to control the railway ter- 
minus at the city. In regard to this I will send more detailed, 
instructions as the operations of the northern column develop 
themselves. 

I may briefly state that the general objects of the expedition 
are, first, the reduction of New Orleans and all its approaches ; 
then Mobile and its defences ; then Pensacola, Galveston, etc. 
It is probable that by the time New Orleans is reduced it will be 
in the power of the government to reinforce the land forces 
sufficiently to accomplish all these objects. In the meantime 
you will please give all the assistance in your power to the army 
and navy commanders in your vicinity, never losing sight of the 
fact that the great object to be achieved is the capture and firm 
retention of New Orleans. 
I am, etc., 

GEO. B. McCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding U. S. Army. 
Maj.-Gen. B. F. BUTLER, 

U. S. Volunteers. 

The plan indicated in the above letters comprehended in its 
scope the operations of all the armies of the Union, the Army of 
the Potomac as well. It was my intention, for reasons easy to be 
seen, that its various parts should be carried out simultaneously, 
or nearly so, and in co-operation along the whole line. If this 
plan was wise and events have failed to prove that it was not 
then it is unnecessary to defend any delay which would have 
enabled the Army of the Potomac to perform its share in the 
execution of the whole work. 

The operations in the West began early in February, and soon 
resulted in the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson and the 
capture of Nashville. Shiloh took place on the 6th and yth of 
April. It was not until May 21 that Corinth was evacuated. 

I have already alluded to the very unsatisfactory condition in 
which Buell found his command, but he very soon satisfied him- 
self that there was no apprehension of a dangerous offensive 
movement by the enemy, and steadily went to work to organize 
and discipline his troops. I gave him all the support and assist- 
ance in my power, sending him as much in the way of troops, 
arms, and supplies as the resources of the government and the 



GENERAL BUELL. 21$ 

necessities of other points permitted. He displayed very high 
qualities as an organizer, and mastered the strategical ques- 
tions with marked ability; and I am satisfied that one of the very 
best things I did when in command was sending him to Ken- 
tucky. 

About the time he went there, and for some months thereafter, 
immense pressure was brought to bear upon the government to do 
something at once for the relief of the Union men in East Ten- 
nessee. I was fully impressed by the necessity for doing this, 
and constantly urged Buell to send a column to that region, even 
at the expense of remaining temporarily on the defensive in front 
of Bowling Green. But Buell found it impossible to do so, in 
consequence of the disorganization which prevailed, the lack of 
transportation and supplies, and the impracticable condition of the 
roads in the fall and winter. My confidence in Buell's judgment 
and knowledge of the circumstances was such that I reluctantly 
acquiesced. I still regret that it was impossible to carry out this 
intention, for the effect of the occupation of Knoxville at that 
time would have been of the first importance. But I have no 
doubt as to the propriety of Buell's decision. He was so true 
and loyal a soldier that no mere obstacles would have deterred 
him from carrying out my clearly expressed wishes. He was the 
best judge as to the possibility of the expedition, and I have no 
doubt that he was right. Before the close of November Buell 
and I discussed the propriety of a movement up the Cumberland 
and Tennessee rivers, and concluded that it should form a neces- 
sary part of the plan of offensive operations. This was so self- 
evident a proposition that I had long thought of it, but I am not 
sure whether the actual suggestion to carry it practically into 
effect came first from Buell or myself very likely from Buell ; 
certainly it did not originate with Halleck or any of his surround- 
ings. I will for the moment leave this subject, simply stating 
that by the 26th of Feb. Nashville was in our hands, and by the 
3d of March Columbus, Kentucky. In the course of these ope- 
rations Halleck delivered himself of several prophetic statements 
in regard to " good strategy," each of which proved to be ridicu- 
lous. 

On the morning of Sunday, March 2, 1862, desiring to give 
orders for the further movements of Buell's and Halleck's com- 
mands, I went to the military telegraph -office then in the head- 



216 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

quarters of the Army of the Potomac at the corner of Pennsyl- 
vania avenue and Jackson square and caused communication to 
be cut off from all wires except those leading to Halleck's head- 
quarters at St. Louis and Buell's at Nashville. I then called 
Buell and Halleck to their respective offices, and asked for a full, 
report of the condition of affairs, number, position, and condi- 
tion of their troops, that of the enemy, etc. Buell promptly 
gave me the information needed. Halleck replied the same 
day : 

"... I have had no communication with Gen. Grant for 
more than a week. He left his command without my authority 
and went to Nashville. His army seems to be as much demoral- 
ized by the victory of Fort Donelson as was that of the Potomac 
by the defeat of Bull Run. It is hard . to censure a successful 
general immediately after a victory, but I think he richly deserves 
it. I can get no returns, no reports, no information of any kind 
from him. Satisfied with his victory, he sits down and enjoys it 
without any regard to the future. I am worn out and tired with 
this neglect and inefficiency. C. F. Smith is almost the only 
officer equal to the emergency." 

To this I replied : 

Your despatch of last evening received. The success of our 
cause demands that proceedings such as Grant's should be at 
once checked. Generals must observe discipline as well as pri- 
vate soldiers. Do not hesitate to arrest him at once, if the good 
of the service requires it, and place C. F. Smith in command. 
You are at liberty to regard this as a positive order, if it will 
smooth your way. I appreciate the difficulties you have to 
encounter, and will be glad to relieve you from trouble as far 
as possible. 

On the 4th Halleck telegraphed me : 

" A rumor has just reached me that since the taking of Fort 
Donelson Grant has resumed his former bad habits. If so, it 
will account for his repeated neglect of my often-repeated orders. 
I do not deem it advisable to arrest him at present, but have 
placed Gen. Smith in command of the expedition up the Ten- 
nessee. I think Smith will restore order and discipline. . . ." 

On the 6th Halleck telegraphed to Grant : 

" Gen. McClellan directs that you report to me daily the num- 



GRANT AND HALLECK. 21 J 

her and position of the forces under your command. Your 
neglect of repeated orders to report the strength of your command 
has created great dissatisfaction and seriously interfered with mili- 
tary plans. Your going to Nashville without authority, and when 
your presence with your troops was of the greatest importance, 
was a matter of serious complaint at Washington, so much so 
that I was advised to arrest you on your return." 

On the 3ist of March Halleck informed Grant : 

" Gen. McClellan directed me to place Gen. Smith in com- 
mand of the expedition until you were ordered to join it." 

On the loth of March the adjutant-general of the army, by 
direction of the President, required from Halleck a report as to 
Grant's unauthorized visit to Nashville and as to his general con- 
duct. On the 1 5th Halleck replied that Grant had gone to Nash- 
ville to communicate with Buell, that his motives were proper, 
and advised that no further proceedings be had in the case. 

Now to the story which prompts me to insert these despatches. 
More than a year after the events in question Franklin wrote to 
me that on meeting Grant at Memphis, or some such point on 
the Mississippi, Grant asked what had made me hostile to him. 
Franklin replied that he knew that I was not hostile but very 
friendly to him. Grant then said that that could not be so, for, 
without any reason, I had ordered Halleck to relieve him from 
command and arrest him soon after Fort Donelson, and that 
Halleck had interfered to save him. I took no steps to unde- 
ceive Grant, trusting to time to elucidate the question. 

In the latter part of 1866, while I was in Europe, Gen. Grant, 
through one of his staff, communicated with Gen. Marcy in regard 
to papers missing from the files of the office of general-in-chief 
during my tenure of the place. 

In searching my papers Gen. Marcy found my retained copy 
of the despatch of March 2 from Halleck in which he reports 
Grant's unauthorized absence, etc. This he forwarded to Gen. 
Grant, who was thus for the first time informed of the truth. 
This despatch and my reply had, with many others, disappeared 
from the files in the office. So with regard to my correspon- 
dence as general-in-chief. 

The military telegraph-office was first established by me, and 
was located, as already stated, in the headquarters of the Army 



2i8 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

of the Potomac. While I was absent from Washington for a 
couple of days in March the Secretary of War, without any inti- 
mation to me, caused the entire office, with all the telegraphic 
records, to be removed to the War Department. 

I was relieved from the general command of the army while 
with the front near Manassas (March n), and never re-entered 
the office of commanding general in the War Department. All 
the papers there were taken possession of by the Secretary of 
War, and he and Halleck are alone responsible for any gaps in 
the files. 

Some one abstracted the telegrams above alluded to. As to 
Halleck's conduct with regard to Grant, no comment by me is 
necessary. The facts speak for themselves. 

[In this connection see " Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant," 
vol. i. pp. 324-8 ; also, North American Review y Dec., 1885. 
The following correspondence between Gens. Grant and McClel- 
lan is appended by the editor :] 

HOTEL BYRON, VILLENEUVE, Nov. 24, 1866. 
Gen. U. S. Grant, Commanding U. S. Army : 

GENERAL : In a letter received yesterday from Gen. Marcy 
he says : " I had a note yesterday from a member of Gen. Grant's 
staff, in which he says it has been officially reported to the gene- 
ral that he (McClellan) had retained in his possession certain 
records pertaining to the headquarters of the army which were 
loaned to him while preparing his report in 1862-3." 

I desire to state that I have not knowingly retained or caused 
to be withheld any document whatever, whether important or 
unimportant, belonging to the headquarters of the army or to 
any other department of the government. 

When my report was completed I caused all the original sub- 
ordinate reports and all other documents belonging to the gov- 
ernment to be boxed up, and sent them to the adjutant-general 
of the army in Washington, I think at the same time with my 
report. My recollection is that they were sent by the hands 
of my aide-de-camp, Capt. A. McClellan. I do not think it pos- 
sible that any document can have been overlooked, because in 
examining my papers subsequently my attention would in all 
probability have been attracted to it, and, as a matter of course, 
I would at once have forwarded it to Washington. I shall be 
under especial obligations to you, general, if you will cause me 
to be informed what documents are alluded to in the report 
referred to, also by whom the report was made to you. 

To such a general statement as that made to Gen. Marcy

at least as it has reached me I can only return a general reply, 
as I have already done. 

Desiring the favor of an early reply, directed to the care of

I am, general, very truly yours,

VEVAY, SWITZERLAND, 
Dec. 26, 1866. 

MY DEAR GENERAL : Yours of the loth inst. reached me yes- 
terday, and I now fully understand what is wanted. 

When called to the command of the United States armies in 
1 86 1 I left unchanged the organization of the Army of the Poto- 
mac and its headquarters, and in no manner merged them with 
those of the headquarters of the United States army the staff 
for each being distinct, except with regard to my personal aides- 
de-camp. Thus Gen. Marcy, the chief of staff of the Army of 
the Potomac, had nothing to do with the headquarters of the 
army of the United States. Gen. S. Williams was adjutant-gene- 
ral of the Army of the Potomac, while Gen. L. Thomas was my 
adjutant-general in my capacity as commander of the United 
States army, etc. The papers and records of the two offices were 
entirely distinct. I had in the War Department building two 
rooms for my office as commanding general of the United States 
army, and thither Gen. Thomas brought to me all papers and 
matters requiring my action, received my orders thereon, carried 
back the papers to his own office, where they should be found, 
together with the orders and letters issued by him thereon in 
conformity with my instructions. You will the more readily 
comprehend the state of affairs when I remind you that my 



22O McCLELLAN'S OWtf STORY. 

predecessor, Gen. Scott, had an office first in New York, after- 
wards in Washington entirely distinct from that of the adjutant- 
general of the United States army, where he had his own adju- 
tant-general and entirely distinct records ; the adjutant-general 
of the United States army being then simply the adjutant-gene- 
ral of the Secretary of War. I changed the arrangement, dis- 
pensed with the machinery of a separate office, and merged all 
the routine service and records of the command-in-chief with 
those of the adjutant-general's office. The only papers, to the 
best of my recollection, kept in my office were the retained 
copies of my own letters on subjects of an important nature 
requiring more or less secrecy, such as letters of instruction in 
regard to military movements. As the telegraph was much used, 
these letters were not numerous. Col. A. V. Colburn had charge 
of these letters, and I am not sure whether they were copied into 
books or simply filed. I kept nothing for myself but the original 
rough drafts, either in my own handwriting or that of the aides to 
whom they were dictated. All written reports received went 
finally to the adjutant-general's office or that of the Secretary of 
War ; none were retained in my office, which was, after all, sim- 
ply a place for the transaction of business, and not a place of 
record. When I left Washington in March, 1862, to accompany 
the Army of the Potomac on its march towards Manassas, I was 
still the commanding general of the United States army, had no 
reason whatever to suppose that any change was contemplated 
by the President, left at a few hours' notice, and expected to 
return in a few days, preparatory to the final movement to the 
Peninsula. I therefore made no special arrangements in regard 
to my office in the War Department, and left everything as it 
happened to be, all my personal aides accompanying me. Two 
or three days after, while at Fairfax Court-House, I, to my com- 
plete surprise, received through the newspapers the orders reliev- 
ing me from the command of the United States army, and never 
afterwards entered the office in Washington. I was informed 
that it was immediately taken possession of by the War Depart- 
ment for its own uses, and have no knowledge of what disposi- 
tion was made of the papers, etc., found there, further than that 
it was about the same time stated to me that the War Depart- 
ment had taken possession of everything in the office, as the 
functions of commanding general were assumed by the secretary. 
All telegraphic despatches of any importance were sent and re- 
ceived in cipher, and were handed to me translated ; the work 
of deciphering, and the reverse, being executed in the telegraph- 
office. My recollection is that the cipher copies, at least, were 
recorded in books, which were kept in the chief telegraph-office ; 
these books were never in my personal possession. This chief 
office, originally organized under my direction, was in the build- 
ing occupied as the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac. 



GRANT AND HALLECK. 221 

on Pennsylvania avenue and Jackson square. Soon after the 
accession of the present Secretary of War to office, and during 
uiy absence from the city on duty for two or three days, the 
entire establishment, with all its records, apparatus, and per- 
sonnel, was removed to the War Department building, without my 
knowledge, by order of the Secretary of War ; and from that 
time I ceased to have the slightest control over it. When I 
returned to the city I found the removal accomplished, which 
was the first intimation I had of it. In that office should be 
found copies of all the messages that passed through it. With 
regard to the books containing the original duplicates of my mes- 
sages sent, I have now no means of knowing what ones were left 
in my War Department office when it passed from my posses- 
sion. I do not think there are any in my possession (among 
my papers in the United States) except that sent to you by 
Gen. Marcy. As that was simply my private memorandum, I 
would be glad to have it returned to Gen. Marcy when you have 
done with it. I was not aware that the telegrams of Feb. and 
March, 1862, from Gen. Halleck were among my papers. I have 
requested Gen. Marcy to forward to you whatever copies of tele- 
grams, etc., he may find. From his letter to me I think that he 
has examined all my papers, for all that I know of are at Orange. 
I will do my best to aid him in making a thorough search. When 
I return to the United States probably in the course of a few 
months I will most cheerfully aid you, in any possible way, to 
carry out your wishes; but I am at present inclined to think that 
a close search in Washington will be productive of much better 
results than one conducted elsewhere. 

I must apologize for inflicting so long a letter upon you, and 
am, my dear general, 

Sincerely your friend, 

GEO. B. McCLELLAN.

Commanding U. S. Armies. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

Evacuation of Manassas Army corps McClellan removed from chief 
command President's military orders Plan of advance on Rich- 
mond Derangement of all plans by the administration. 

THE organization of army corps directed by the President's 
order of March 8, 1862, was the work of the President and Sec- 
retary of War, probably urged by McDowell. It was issued 
without consulting me and against my judgment, for from the 
beginning it had been my intention to postpone the formation 
of army corps until service in the field had indicated what gene- 
ral officers were best fitted to exercise those most important com- 
mands. The mistakes of an incompetent division commander 
may be rectified, but those of a corps commander are likely to 
be fatal. The President designated the senior general officers to 
command the corps. The day after this order was issued we 
received information, that seemed reliable, of the evacuation of 
Manassas. The President and Secretary were with me at the 
time, and fully approved my determination of going to Porter's 
headquarters, where I could receive information more readily 
and be better prepared to act as circumstances might require, 
whether to move in pursuit or not. I at once sent Averill 
with a brigade of cavalry to verify the news and do what he 
could against the enemy's rear-guard ; but Gen. Johnston had, 
as usual, masked his retreat so well that nothing could be 
effected. 

In the course of the evening I determined to move the whole 
army forward, partly with the hope that I might be able to take 
advantage of some accident and bring Johnston to battle under 
favorable circumstances, but also to break up Jhe camps, give 
the troops a little experience in marching and bivouac before 
finally leaving the old base of supplies, to test the transporta- 
tion arrangements and get rid of impedimenta, and thus prepare 
things for the movement to the Peninsula. It also seemed pro- 
bable that this advance, in connection with the recent move on 
Harper's Ferry and Charleston, would tend to make Johnston 



A A' MY COXPS. 223 

more uncertain as to my real intentions. In the course of the 
evening I telegraphed to the Secretary of War: 

" In the arrangements for the advance of to-rnorrow it is 
impossible to carry into effect the arrangements for the forma- 
tion of army corps. I am obliged to take groups as I find them, 
and to move them by divisions. I respectfully ask a suspension 
of the order directing it until the present movement be over." 

To this the secretary made the following singular reply : 

" I think it is the duty of every officer to obey the Presi- 
dent's orders. Nor can I see any reason why you should not 
obey them in the present instance ; I must therefore decline 
to suspend them." 

To this I at once replied at one A.M.: 

" You have entirely misunderstood me, and the idea I in- 
tended to convey was simply that I could not, under the pres- 
sure of the new aspect of affairs, immediately carry out the 
President's order as to the formation of army corps. It is abso- 
lutely necessary that I should at once move divisions as they 
stand. If you require me to suspend movements until army 
corps can be formed, I will do so, but I regard it as a military 
necessity that the divisions should move to the front at once 
without waiting for the formation of army corps. If it is your 
order to wait until the corps can be formed, I will, of course, 
wait. I will comply with the President's order as soon as pos- 
sible. I intended to do so to-morrow, but circumstances have 
changed. If you desire it I will at once countermand all the 
orders I have given for arx advance until the formation of army 
corps is completed. I have only to add that the order I have 
given to-night to advance early in the morning was dictated 
solely by the present condition of affairs. If the leave to sus- 
pend the order be granted there will be no unreasonable delay 
in the formation of army corps. I await your reply here, that, 
if you so direct, I may countermand my orders at once. Please 
reply at once." 

To this the secretary replied : 

" I do not understand the President's order as restraining 
you from any military movement, by divisions or otherwise, that 
circumstances in your judgment may render expedient, and I 
certainly do not wish to delay or change any movement what- 



224 McCLELLAtrS OWN STORY. 

ever that you have made or desire to make. I only wish to 
avoid giving any sanction to a suspension of a policy which the 
President has ordered to be pursued ; but if you think that the 
terms of the order as it stands would operate to retard or in any 
way restrain movements that circumstances require to be made 
before the army corps are formed, I will assume the responsi- 
bility of suspending the order for that purpose, and authorize 
you to make any movement, by division or otherwise, to your 
own judgment, without stopping to form the army corps. My 
desire is that you should exercise every power that you think 
present circumstances require to be exercised without delay, but 
I want that you and I should not seem to be desirous of oppos- 
ing any order of the President without necessity. I say, there- 
fore, move just as you think best now, and let the other matter 
stand until it can be done without impeding movements." 

To this I replied at 2.40 A.M.: 

Your reply received. The troops are in motion. I thank 
you for your despatch : it relieves me much, and you will be 
convinced that I have not asked too much of you. 

It was only by throwing the responsibility of delay upon the 
secretary that he withdrew his quite unnecessary opposition. 
My order for the formation of the corps was given on the i3th, 
as soon as circumstances permitted. 

McDowell was very anxious to have the reserve artillery, the 
cavalry, and the regular infantry attached to his corps ; for- 
tunately, I kept them by themselves, or I should, no doubt, have 
lost them as well as McDowell's own corps. 

On the loth I reached Fairfax Court-House and established 
headquarters there. It was now evident, from the information 
received, that it would be impossible to reach the enemy within 
a reasonable distance from Washington. The various divisions 
were therefore halted where they stood, at convenient distances 
from headquarters, and the preparations pushed for embarking 
for the Peninsula. I threw forward Sumner with two divisions 
and Stoneman with a cavalry command to proceed as far as the 
Rapidan and Rappahannock, to secure the crossings and still 
further deceive the enemy as to my intentions. 

While here I learned through the public newspapers that I 
was displaced in the command of the United States armies. It 
may be well to state that no one in authority had ever expressed 






REMOVAL FROM CHIEF COMMAND. 22$ 

to me the slightest disapprobation of my action in that capacity, 
nor had I received any information of a purpose to change my 
position. 

President's War Order, No. 3. 

" EXECUTIVE MANSION, WASHINGTON, 
"March u, 1862. 

" Maj.-Gen. McClellan having personally taken the field at the 
head of the Army of the Potomac, until otherwise ordered he is 
relieved from the command of the other military departments, he 
retaining command of the Department of the Potomac. 

" Ordered, further, That the departments now under the respec- 
tive commands of Gens. Halleck and Hunter, together with so 
much of that under Gen. Buell as lies west of a north and south 
line indefinitely drawn through Knoxville, Tennessee, be consoli- 
dated and designated the Department of the Mississippi ; and 
that, until otherwise ordered, Maj.-Gen. Halleck have command 
of said department. 

" Ordered, also, That the country west of the Department of

military department to be called the Mountain Department, and 
that the same be commanded by Maj.-Gen. Fremont. 

" That all the commanders of departments, after the receipt of 
this order by them, respectively report severally and directly to 
the Secretary of War, and that prompt, full, and frequent reports 
will be expected of all and each of them. 

"ABRAHAM LINCOLN." 

The intelligence took me entirely by surprise, and the order 
proved to be one of the steps taken to tie my hands in order 
to secure the failure of the approaching campaign. Elsewhere I 
state the effect of this change in altering the condition of affairs, 
and breaking that unity of action which it was my purpose to 
enforce in the operations of the different armies in the field, as 
well as its effect upon operations in Virginia. 

Though unaware of the President's intention to remove me 
from the position of general-in-chief, I cheerfully acceded to the 
disposition he saw fit to make of my services, and so informed 
him in a note on the i2th of March : 

Unofficial. 

FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, 

March 12, 1862. 
His Excellency A. Lincoln, President: 

MY PEAR SIR ; I have just seen Gov, Dennison, who has

detailed to me the conversation he held with you yesterday 
and to-day. 

I beg to say that I cordially endorse all he has said to you in 
my behalf, and that I thank you most sincerely for the official con- 
fidence and kind personal feelings you entertain for me. 

I believe I said to you some weeks since, in connection with 
some Western matters, that no feeling of self-interest or ambition 
should ever prevent me from devoting myself to your service. I 
am glad to have the opportunity to prove it, and you will find 
that, under present circumstances, I shall work just as cheerfully 
as before, and that no consideration of self will in any man- 
ner interfere with the discharge of my public duties. Again 
thanking you for the official and personal kindness you have so 
often evinced towards me, 

I am, most sincerely your friend, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN. 



While at Fairfax Court-House an order arrived assigning Gen. 
Wadsworth to the command of Washington. The secretary had 
spoken to me on the subject some days before, whereupon I 
objected to the selection for the reason that Gen. Wadsworth 
was not a soldier by training. I said that one of the very best 
soldiers in the army was necessary for the command of Washing- 
ton, which was next in importance to the command of the Army 
of the Potomac an officer fully posted in all the details of the 
profession ; and that, much as I should dislike sparing him, I 
would give up Franklin for the place. The secretary replied 
that Wadsworth had been selected because it was necessary, for 
political reasons, to conciliate the agricultural interests of New 
York, and that it was useless to discuss the matter, because it 
would in no event be changed. 

When Gen. Wadsworth parted from me at Fairfax he pro- 
fessed the greatest devotion and friendship for me, but at once 
bscame an enemy, probably because Stanton informed him of the 
objections I had made to his appointment, without giving him the 
real grounds of my opposition. 

My memorandum of Aug. 2, 1861, shows that even then I 
regarded Virginia as the most important portion of the immense 
theatre of operations. Gen. Scott differed from me, and thought 
the valley of the Mississippi more vital. While fully recognizing 
the importance and necessity of operations in the valley of the 
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and of coast expe- 



PLANS A GA INS T RICHMOND. 

ditions, I always held the eastern line to be the true theatre of 
decisive operations. 

If I had been retained in chief command, untrammelled as 
to time and means, I should, in the early spring of 1862, have 
pushed with all energy the operations against Wilmington, 
Charleston, and New Orleans, as well as in the Mississippi, 
Tennessee, and Cumberland valleys, and against the Knox- 
ville and Lynchburg Railroad, via Cumberland Gap, and early 
in May have thrown the Army of the Potomac to the James 
river with a strength of over 150,000 for duty. I intended to 
transport by water to Urbana, on the lower Rappahannock, four 
divisions of infantry with their batteries, the regular infantry, one 
bridge-train, a few squadrons of cavalry, and a small number of 
wagons ; with them to push by a forced march to the vicinity 
of West Point, and then cross the Mattapony and Pamunkey 
rivers, thus compelling the evacuation of Yorktown, and per- 
haps cutting off Magruder's force in the Peninsula. Meanwhile 
the reserve artillery, the remaining cavalry, bridge-trains, and 
necessary wagons were to be concentrated in the vicinity of 
Point Lookout, and, simultaneously with the landing at Urbana, 
ferried across the Potomac on North river ferry-boats, marched 
to the Rappahannock the movement covered by an infantry 
force near Heathsville then ferried over the Rappahannock 
and moved rapidly to unite with the force first landed. Prior 
to the evacuation of Yorktown the remaining portions of the 
army would have been landed at Urbana, and, subsequently 
to that, at West Point or on the James, as circumstances 
required. 

As soon as the leading divisions of infantry crossed the 
Pamunkey they would have moved on Richmond, covered by 
cavalry on both flanks. My letters of Feb. 3 and March 19, 
1862, to the Secretary of War, show that, under certain circum- 
stances, I contemplated crossing the James river and attacking 
Richmond from the south. 

The fears of the administration and their inability to compre- 
hend the merits of the scheme, or else the determination that I 
should not succeed in the approaching campaign, induced them 
to prohibit me from carrying out the Urbana movement. They 
gave me the choice between the direct overland route via Manas- 
sas, and the route with Fort Monroe as a base. Of course I 



228 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

selected the latter. My report gives all the most important cor- 
respondence on this subject, and the arguments I used in support 
of the plan of campaign which commended itself to my judg- 
ment. 

Let me here call attention to the President's orders of Jan. 27 
and Jan. 31, 1862, and his letter to me of Feb. 3, answered in 
mine of the same day to the Secretary of War : 

President's General War Order, No. i.

States against the insurgent forces. That especially the army 
at and about Fortress Monroe, the Army of the Potomac, the 
Army of Western Virginia, the army near Munfordville, Ken- 
tucky, the army and flotilla at Cairo, and a naval force in the 
Gulf of Mexico be ready to move on that day. 

" That all other forces, both land and naval, with their 
respective commanders, obey existing orders for the time, and 
be ready to obey additional orders when duly given.

The order of Jan. 31, 1862, was as follows : 

President's Special War Order, No. i. 

" EXECUTIVE MANSION, 
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 31, 1862. 

" Ordered, That all the disposable force of the Army of the 
Potomac, after providing safely for the defence of Washington, 
be formed into an expedition for the immediate object of seizing 
and occupying a point upon the railroad southwestward of what 
is known as Manassas Junction, all details to be in the discretion 
of the commander-in-chief, and the expedition to move before or 
on the 22d day of Feb. next. 

"ABRAHAM LINCOLN." 

I asked his excellency whether this order was to be regarded 
as final, or whether I could be permitted to submit in writing my 






MR. LINCOLN'S PLAN. 229 

objections to his plan and my reasons for preferring my own. 
Permission was accorded, and I therefore prepared the letter to 
the Secretary of War which is given below. 

Before this had been submitted to the President he addressed 
me the following note : 

" EXECUTIVE MANSION, 
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 3, 1862. 

" MY DEAR SIR : You and I have distinct and different plans 
for a movement of the Army of the Potomac : yours to be done 
by the Chesapeake, up the Rappahannock to Urbana, and across 
land to the terminus of the railroad on the York river ; mine to 
move directly to a point on the railroad southwest of Manassas. 

" If you will give satisfactory answers to the following ques- 
tions I shall gladly yield my plan to yours : 

" i st. Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure 
of time and money than mine ? 

" 2d. Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than 
mine ? 

" 3d. Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than 
mine ? 

" 4th. In fact, would it not be less valuable in this : that it 
would break no great line of the enemy's communications, while 
mine would? 

"5th. In case of disaster would not a retreat be more diffi- 
cult by your plan than mine ? 
" Yours truly, 

"ABRAHAM LINCOLN. 

"Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

These questions were substantially answered by the following 
letter of the same date to the Secretary of War : 

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 3, 1862. 

SIR : I ask your indulgence for the following papers, rendered 
necessary by circumstances. 

I assumed command of the troops in the vicinity of Washing- 
ton on Saturday, July 27, 1861, six days after the battle of Bull 
Run. 

I found no army to command a mere collection of regi- 
ments cowering on the banks of the Potomac, some perfectly 
raw, others dispirited by the recent defeat. 

Nothing of any consequence had been done to secure the 
southern approaches to the capital by means of defensive works ; 
nothing whatever had been undertaken to defend the avenues to 
the city on the northern side of the Potomac. 



230 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

The troops were not only undisciplined, imdrilled, and dis- 
pirited ; they were not even placed in military positions. The 
city was almost in a condition to have been taken by a dash of a 
regiment of cavalry. 

Without one day's delay I undertook the difficult task as- 
signed to me. That task the honorable secretary knows was 
given to me without solicitation or foreknowledge. How far I 
have accomplished it will best be shown by the past and the 
present. 

The capital is secure against attack ; the extensive fortifica- 
tions erected by the labor of our troops enable a small garrison 
to hold it against a numerous army; the enemy have been held in 
check ; the State of Maryland is securely in our possession, the 
detached counties of Virginia are again within the pale of our 
laws, and all apprehension of trouble in Delaware is at an end ; 
the enemy are confined to the positions they occupied before the 
disaster of the 2ist July. More than all this, I have now under 
my command a well-drilled and reliable army, to which the des- 
tinies of the country may be confidently committed, This army 
is young and untried in battle, but it is animated by the highest 
spirit and is capable of great deeds. 

That so much has been accomplished and such an army 
created in so short a time from nothing will hereafter be regard- 
ed as one of the highest glories of the administration and the 
nation. 

Many weeks I may say many months ago this Army of the 
Potomac was fully in condition to repel any attack ; but there is 
a vast difference between that and the efficiency required to 
enable troops to attack successfully an army elated by victory 
and entrenched in a position long since selected, studied, and 
fortified. 

In the earliest papers I submitted to the President I asked for 
an effective and movable force far exceeding the aggregate now 
on the banks of the Potomac. I have not the force I asked 
for. 

Even when in a subordinate position I always looked beyond 
the operations of the Army of the Potomac. I was never satis- 
fied in my own mind with a barren victory, but looked to com- 
bined and decisive operations. 

When I was placed in command of the armies of the United 
States I immediately turned my attention to the whole field of 
operations, regarding the Army of the Potomac as only one, 
while the most important, of the masses under my command. 

I confess that I did not then appreciate the total absence of 
a general plan which had before existed, nor did I know that 
utter disorganization and want of preparation pervaded the West- 
ern armies. 

I took it for granted that they were nearly, if not quite, in 



McCLELLAN'S PLANS. 



2 3 T 



condition to move towards the fulfilment of my plans. I acknow- 
ledge that I made a great mistake. 

I sent at once, with the approval of the executive, officers I 
considered competent to command in Kentucky and Missouri. 
Their instructions looked to prompt movements. I soon found 
that the labor of creation and organization had to be performed 
there ; transportation, arms, clothing, artillery, discipline all 
were wanting. These things required time to procure them. 

The generals in command have done their work most credi- 
tably, but we are still delayed. I had hoped that a general ad- 
vance could be made during the good weather of December ; I 
was mistaken. 

My wish was to gain possession of the Eastern Tennessee 
Railroad as a preliminary movement, then to follow it up imme- 
diately by an attack on Nashville and Richmond, as nearly at the 
same time as possible. 

I have ever regarded our true policy as being that of fully 
preparing ourselves, and then seeking for the most decisive 
results. I do not wish to waste life in useless battles, but prefer 
to strike at the heart. 

Two bases of operations seem to present themselves for the 
advance of the Army of the Potomac : 

ist. That of Washington its present position involving a 
direct attack upon the entrenched positions of the enemy at 
Centreville, Manassas, etc., or else a movement to turn one or 
both flanks of those positions, or a combination of the two 
plans. 

The relative force of the two armies will not justify an attack 
on both flanks ; an attack on his left flank alone involves a long 
line of wagon communication, and cannot prevent him from col- 
lecting for the decisive battle all the detachments now on his 
extreme right and left. 

Should we attack his right flank by the line of the Occoquan, 
and a crossing of the Potomac below that river and near his 
batteries, we could perhaps prevent the junction of the enemy's 
right with his centre (we might destroy the former) ; we would 
remove the obstructions to the navigation of the Potomac, reduce 
the length of wagon transportation by establishing new depots at 
the nearest points of the Potomac, and strike more directly his 
main railway communication. 

The fords of the Occoquan below the mouth of the Bull Run 
are watched by the rebels ; batteries are said to be placed on the 
heights in the rear (concealed by the woods), and the arrange- 
ment of his troops is such that he can oppose some considerable 
resistance to a passage of that stream. Information has just been 
received to the effect that the enemy are entrenching a line of 
heights extending from the vicinity of Sangster's (Union Mills) 
towards Evansport. Early in January Spriggs's ford was occu- 



232 MCCLELLAND OWN STORY. 

pied by General Rhodes with 3,600 men and eight (8) guns ; 
there are strong reasons for believing that Davis's ford is occu- 
pied. These circumstances indicate or prove that the enemy 
anticipates the movement in question, and is prepared to resist it. 
Assuming for the present that this operation is determined upon, 
it may be well to examine briefly its probable progress. In the 
present state of affairs our column (for the movement of so large 
a force must be made in several columns, at least five or six) can 
reach the Accotink without danger ; during the march thence to 
the Occoquan our right flank becomes exposed to an attack from 
Fairfax Station, Sangster's, and Union Mills. This danger must 
be met by occupying in some force either the two first-named 
places, or, better, the point of junction of the roads leading thence 
to the village of Occoquan ; this occupation must be continued 
so long as we continue to draw supplies by the roads from this 
city, or until a battle is won. 

The crossing of the Occoquan should be made at all the fords 
from Wolf's Run to the mouth, the points of crossing not being 
necessarily confined to the fords themselves. Should the enemy 
occupy this line in force we must, with what assistance the 
flotilla can afford, endeavor to force the passage near the mouth, 
thus forcing the enemy to abandon the whole line or be taken in 
flank himself. 

Having gained the line of the Occoquan, it would be neces- 
sary to throw a column by the shortest route to Dumfries, partly 
to force the enemy to abandon his batteries on the Potomac, 
partly to cover our left flank against an attack from the direction 
of Acquia, and, lastly, to establish our communications with the 
river by the best roads, and thus give us new depots. The enemy 
would by this time have occupied the line of the Occoquan above 
Bull Run, holding Brentsville in force, and perhaps extending his 
lines somewhat further to the southwest. 

Our next step would then be to prevent the enemy from cross- 
ing the Occoquan between Bull Run and Broad Run, to fall upon 
our right flank while moving on Brentsville. This might be 
effected by occupying Bacon Race church and the cross-roads 
near the mouth of Bull Run, or still more effectually by moving 
to the fords themselves and preventing him from debouching on 
our side. 

These operations would possibly be resisted, and it would 
require some time to effect them, as, nearly at the same time as 
possible, we should gain the fords necessary to our purposes above 
Broad Run. Having secured our right flank, it would become 
necessary to carry Brentsville at any cost, for we could not leave 
it between the right flank and the main body. The final move- 
ment on the railroad must be determined by circumstances exist- 
ing at the time. 

This brief sketch brings out in bold relief the great advan- 



McCLELLAN'S PLANS. 233 

tage possessed by the enemy in the strong central position he 
occupies, with roads diverging in every direction, and a strong 
line of defence enabling him to remain on the defensive, with a 
small force on one flank, while he concentrates everything on the 
other for a decisive action. 

Should we place a portion of our force in front of Centre- 
ville, while the rest crosses the Occoquan, we commit the error of 
dividing our army by a very difficult obstacle, and by a distance 
too great to enable the two parts to support each other, should 
either be attacked by the masses of the enemy while the other is 
held in check. 

I should perhaps have dwelt more decidedly on the fact that 
the force left near Sangster's must be allowed to remain some- 
where on that side of the Occoquan until the decisive battle is 
over, so as to cover our retreat in the event of disaster, unless it 
should be decided to select and entrench a new base somewhere 
near Dumfries a proceeding involving much time. 

After the passage of the Occoquan by the main army this 
covering force could be drawn into a more central and less 
exposed position say Brimstone Hill or nearer the Occoquan. 
In this latitude the weather will for a considerable period be very 
uncertain, and a movement commenced in force on roads in 
tolerably firm condition will be liable, almost certain, to be much 
delayed by rains and snow. It will, therefore, be next to impos- 
sible to surprise the enemy or take him at a disadvantage by 
rapid manoeuvres. Our slow progress will enable him to divine 
our purposes and take his measures accordingly. The probabil- 
ity is, from the best information we possess, that the enemy has 
improved the roads leading to his lines of defence, while we have 
to work as we advance. 

Bearing in mind what has been said, and the present unprece- 
dented and impassable condition of the roads, it will be evident 
that no precise period can be fixed upon for the movement on 
this line. Nor can its duration be closely calculated ; it seems 
certain that many weeks may elapse before it is possible to com- 
mence the march. Assuming the success of this operation, and 
the defeat of the enemy as certain, the question at once arises as 
to the importance of the results gained. I think these results 
would be confined to the possession of the field of battle, the 
evacuation of the line of the upper Potomac by the enemy, and 
the moral effect of the victory important results, it is true, but 
not decisive of the war, nor securing the destruction of the 
enemy's main army, for he could fall back upon other positions 
and fight us" again and again, should the condition of his troops 
permit. If he is in no condition to fight us again out of the 
range of the entrenchments at Richmond, we would find it a very 
difficult and tedious matter to follow him up there, for he would 
destroy his railroad bridges and otherwise impede our progress 



234 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

through a region where the roads are as bad as they well can be, 
and we would probably find ourselves forced at last to change 
the whole theatre of war, or to seek a shorter land route to Rich- 
mond, with a smaller available force and at an expenditure of 
much more time, than were we to adopt the short line at once. 
We would also have forced the enemy to concentrate his forces 
and perfect his defensive measures at the very points where it is 
desirable to strike him when least prepared. 

2d. The second base of operations available for the Army of 
the Potomac is that of the lower Chesapeake bay, which affords 
the shortest possible land route to Richmond and strikes direct- 
ly at the heart of the enemy's power in the east. 

The roads in that region are passable at all seasons of the 
year. 

The country now alluded to is much more favorable for 
offensive operations than that in front of Washington (which is 
very unfavorable): much more level, more cleared land, the woods 
less dense, the soil more sandy, and the spring some two or three 
weeks earlier. A movement in force on that line obliges the 
enemy to abandon his entrenched position at Manassas, in order 
to hasten to cover Richmond and Norfolk. He must do this ; 
for should he permit us to occupy Richmond his destruction can 
be averted only by entirely defeating us in a battle in which he 
must be the assailant. This movement, if successful, gives us the 
capital, the communications, the supplies of the rebels ; Norfolk 
would fall ; all the waters of the Chesapeake would be ours ; all 
Virginia would be in our power, and the enemy forced to abandon 
Tennessee and North Carolina. The alternative presented to the 
enemy would be, to beat us in a position selected by ourselves, 
disperse, or pass beneath the Caudine Forks. 

Should we be beaten in a battle we have a perfectly secure 
retreat down the Peninsula upon Fort Monroe, with our flanks 
perfectly covered by the fleet. 

During the whole movement our left flank is covered by the 
water. Our right is secure, for the reason that the enemy is too 
distant to reach us in time ; he can only oppose us in front. 
We bring our fleet into full play. 

After a successful battle our position would be Burnside 
forming our left ; Norfolk held securely ; our centre connecting 
Burnside with Buell, both by Raleigh and Lynchburg ; Buell in 
Eastern Tennessee and North Alabama ; Halleck at Nashville 
and Memphis. 

The next movement would be to connect with Sherman on 
the left by reducing Wilmington and Charleston ; to advance 
our centre into South Carolina and Georgia ; to push Buell either 
towards Montgomery or to unite with the main army in Georgia ; 
to throw Halleck southward to meet the naval expedition from 
New Orleans. 



McCLELLAN'S PLANS. 2^5 

We should then be in a condition to reduce at our leisure all 
the Southern seaports ; to occupy all the avenues of communica- 
tion ; to use the great outlet of the Mississippi ; to re-establish 
our government and arms in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas ; to 
force the slaves to labor for our subsistence instead of that of 
the rebels ; to bid defiance to all foreign interference. Such is 
the object I have ever had in view ; this is the general plan 
which I hope to accomplish. 

For many long months I have labored to prepare the Army of 
the Potomac to play its part in the programme ; from the day 
when I was placed in command of all our armies I have exerted 
myself to place all the other armies in such a condition that they, 
too, could perform their allotted duties. 

Should it be determined to operate from the lower Chesa- 
peake, the point of landing which promises the most brilliant 
result is Urbana, on the lower Rappahannock. This point is 
easily reached by vessels of heavy draught ; it is neither occupied 
nor observed by the enemy ; it is but one march from West 
Point, the key of that region, and thence but two marches to 
Richmond. A rapid movement from Urbana would probably 
cut off Magruder in the Peninsula and enable us to occupy 
Richmond before it could be strongly reinforced. Should we 
fail in that we could, with the co-operation of the navy, cross the 
James and throw ourselves in rear of Richmond, thus forcing the 
enemy to come out and attack us, fur his position would be 
untenable with us on the southern bank of the river. 

Should circumstances render it not advisable to land at 
Urbana we can use Mobjack bay ; or, the worst coming to 
the worst, we can take Fort Monroe as a base and operate with 
complete security, although with less celerity and brilliancy of 
results, up the Peninsula. 

To reach whatever point may be selected as a base, a large 
amount of cheap water transportation must be collected, consist- 
ing mainly of canal-boats, barges, wood-boats, schooners, etc., 
towed by small steamers, all of a very different character from 
those required for all previous expeditions. This can certainly 
be accomplished within thirty days from the time the order is 
given. I propose, as the best possible plan that can, in my judg- 
ment, be adopted, to select Urbana as a landing-place for the 
first detachments ; to transport by water four divisions of in- 
fantry with their batteries, the regular infantry, a few wagons, one 
bridge-train, and a few squadrons of cavalry, making the vicinity 
of Hooker's position the place of embarkation for as many as 
possible ; to move the regular cavalry and reserve artillery, the 
remaining bridge-trains and wagons, to a point somewhere near 
Cape Lookout, then ferry them over the river by means of North 
river ferry-boats, march them over to the Rappahannock (cover- 
ing the movement by an infantry force near Heathsville), and 



236 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

to cross the Rappahannock in a similar way. The expense and 
difficulty of the movement will then be very much diminished 
(a saving of transportation of about 10,000 horses) and the result 
none the less certain. 

The concentration of the cavalry, etc., on the lower counties 
of Maryland can be effected without exciting suspicion, and the 
movement made without delay from that cause. 

This movement, if adopted, will not at all expose the city of 
Washington to danger. 

The total force to be thrown upon the new line would be, 
according to circumstances, from 110,000 to 140,000. I hope to 
use the latter number by bringing fresh troops into Washington 
and still leaving it quite safe. I fully realize that in all projects 
offered time will probably be the most valuable consideration. 
It is my decided opinion that, in that point of view, the second 
plan should be adopted. It is possible, nay, highly probable, 
that the weather and state of the roads may be such as to delay 
the direct movement from Washington, with its unsatisfactory 
results and great risks, far beyond the time required to complete 
the second plan. In the first case we can fix no definite time for 
an advance. The roads have gone from bad to worse. Nothing 
like their present condition was ever known here before ; they 
are impassable at present. We are entirely at the mercy of the 
weather. It is by no means certain that we can beat them at 
Manassas. On the other line I regard success as certain by all 
the chances of war. We demoralize the enemy by forcing him 
to abandon his prepared position for one which we have chosen, 
in which all is in our favor, and where success must produce 
immense results. 

My judgment, as a general, is clearly in favor of this project. 
Nothing is certain in war, but all the chances are in favor of 
this movement. So much am I in favor of the southern line of 
operations that I would prefer the move from Fortress Monroe 
as a base, as a certain though less brilliant movement than that 
from Urbana, to an attack upon Manassas. 

I know that his excellency the President, you, arid I all agree 
in our wishes ; and that these wishes are, to bring this war to a 
close as promptly as the means in our possession will permit. I 
believe that the mass of the people have entire confidence in us 
I am sure of it. Let us, then, look only to the great result to be 
accomplished, and disregard everything else. 

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 

Hon. E. M. STANTON, 

Secretary of War. 

This letter must have produced some effect upon the mind of 



TRANSPORTS. 237 

the President, since the execution of his order was not required, 
although it was not revoked as formally as it had been issued. 
Many verbal conferences ensued, in which, among other things, 
it was determined to collect as many canal-boats as possible, 
with a view to employ them largely in the transportation of the 
army to the lower Chesapeake. The idea was at one time enter- 
tained by the President to use them in forming a bridge across 
the Potomac near Liverpool Point, in order to throw the army 
over at that point ; but this was subsequently abandoned. It was 
also found by experience that it would require much time to pre- 
pare the canal-boats for use in transportation to the extent that 
had been anticipated. 

Finally, on the 2;th of Feb., 1862, the Secretary of War, by 
the authority of the President, instructed Mr. John Tucker, 
Assistant Secretary of War, to procure at once the necessary 
steamers and sailing craft to transport the Army of the Poto- 
mac to its new field of operations. 

The following extract from the report of Mr. Tucker, dated 
April 5, will show the nature and progress of this well-executed 
service : 



"I was called to Washington by telegraph, on lyth Jan. last, 
by Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott. I was informed 
that Maj.-Gen. McClellan wished to see me. From him I learned 
that he desired to know if transportation on smooth water could 
be obtained to move at one -time, for a short distance, about 
50,000 troops, 10,000 horses, 1,000 wagons, 13 batteries, and the 
usual equipment of such an army. He frankly stated to me that 
he had always supposed such a movement entirely feasible until 
two experienced quartermasters had recently reported it imprac- 
ticable, in their judgment. A few days afterwards I reported 
to Gen. McClellan that I was entirely confident the transports 
could be commanded, and stated the mode by which his object 
could be accomplished. A week or two afterwards I had the 
honor of an interview with the President and Gen. McClellan, 
when the subject was further discussed, and especially as to the 
time required. 

" I expressed the opinion that as the movement of the horses 
and wagons would have to be made chiefly by schooners and 
barges, that as each schooner would require to be properly fitted 
for the protection of the horses, and furnished with a supply of 
water and forage, and each transport for the troops provided 
with water, I did not deem it prudent to assume that such an 



238 McCLELLAN'S OWN STO&Y. 

expedition could start within thirty days from the time the order 
was given. 

" The President and Gen. McClellan both urgently stated the 
vast importance of an earlier movement. I replied that if favor- 
able winds prevailed, and there was great despatch in loading, 
the time might be materially diminished. 

" On the i4th Feb. you (Secretary of War) advertised for 
transports of various descriptions, inviting bids on the 2yth Feb. 
I was informed that the proposed movement by water was de- 
cided upon. That evening the quartermaster-general was in- 
formed of the decision. Directions were given to secure the 
transportation ; any assistance was tendered. He promptly de- 
tailed to this duty two most efficient assistants in his department. 
Col. Rufus Ingalls was stationed at Annapolis, where it was then 
proposed to embark the troops, and Capt. Henry C. Hodges was 
directed to meet me in Philadelphia to attend to chartering 
the vessels. With these arrangements I left Washington on the 
28th Feb. 

" I beg to hand herewith a statement, prepared by Capt. 
Hodges, of the vessels chartered, which exhibits the prices paid 
and parties from whom they were taken : 

113 steamers, at an average price per day, $215 10 

1 88 schooners, " 24 45 

88 barges, 14 27 

" In thirty-seven days from the time I received the order in 
Washington (and most of it was accomplished in thirty days), 
these vessels transported from Perryville, Alexandria, and Wash- 
ington to Fort Monroe (the place of departure having been 
changed, which caused delay) 121,500 men, 14,592 animals, 1,150 
wagons, 44 batteries, 74 ambulances, besides pontoon bridges, 
telegraph materials, and the enormous quantity of equipage, etc., 
required for an army of such magnitude. The only loss of which 
I have heard is eight mules and nine barges, which latter went 
ashore in a gale within a few miles of Fort Monroe, the cargoes 
being saved. With this trifling exception not the slightest acci- 
dent has occurred, to my knowledge. 

" I respectfully, but confidently, submit that, for economy 
and celerity of movement, this expedition is without a parallel on 
record. 

"JOHN TUCKER, 
" Assistant Secretary of War" 

The same order which confined my command to the Depart- 



DEFENCE OF THE CAPITAL. 239 

ment of the Potomac placed Buell under Halleck, and created 
the Mountain Department, extending from the western limits of 
the Department of the Potomac to the eastern boundary of Hal- 
leek's command.* 

The Department of the Potomac then included all that part 
of Virginia east of the Alleghanies and north of the James river, 
with the exception of Fortress Monroe and the country within 
sixty miles thereof ; also the District of Columbia and the States 
of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. During 
the latter part of March, as I have already stated, Fortress Monroe 
and its dependencies were added to my command (but the order 
was countermanded on the 3d of April). Thus, when about to 
start for the Peninsula it was my duty to provide for the security 
of Washington and the Shenandoahf Valley, and all operations in 
that region were under my direction. 

It was very clear to me that the enemy did not abandon their 
positions on the Potomac and near Manassas without some good 
reason. I knew that they could not intend to return immediate- 
ly, that they would never undertake the assault of the works 
around Washington, and that from the moment the operations 
by the lower Chesapeake were developed they would be tied 
down to the vicinity of Richmond so long as the Army of the 
Potomac remained anywhere near the James river. All they 
could attempt would be a raid in the Shenandoah. I therefore 

* The following memoranda were found lying with the manuscript at 
this point : 

MEMORANDA. On the 5th of March there were no transports of 
importance at Annapolis, some at Perryville and Washington, and many 
engaged and fitting up in New York. 

On March 12 there were at Alexandria transports for 15,000 infantry 
and one squadron, but they were not coaled or ready to receive the troops. 
The pontoon trains and engineers' tools were loaded up. 

March 17 the leading division Hamilton's embarked. 

March 20 there were eight to ten horse-transports at the wharves of 
Alexandria and as many more at anchor. Artillery-transports ready at the 
wharves. 

March 21 Porter's artillery in Alexandria, but no sufficient accommo- 
dation for the horses and no arrangement of vessels for infantry and 
artillery. 

March 22 Porter's division moved off in splendid style and well pro- 
vided ; reached Fortress Monroe on the 23d. 

March 23 Only 150 horses fit for artillery in Alexandria depot ; 300 
expected next day. 

March 24 Many new regiments arriving from the North. No ad- 
ditional transportation. Hunt and Averill can embark.

regarded a full garrison for Washington and 20,000 men for 
the Shenandoah as more than enough under existing circum- 
stances. 

The instructions I gave on the i6th of March were to the 
effect that Manassas Junction should be strongly entrenched, 
using the enemy's works as far as possible, and that Gen. Banks 
should put the mass of his forces there, with grand guards at 
Warrenton or Warrenton Junction, and, if possible, as far out as 
the Rappahannock ; the country to be thoroughly scouted by 
cavalry, the railway from Washington to Manassas and thence to 
Strasburg to be at once repaired and put in running order, all 
the bridges to be protected by block-houses ; as soon as the 
railway was in operation a brigade of infantry with two batteries 
to be strongly entrenched at or near the point where the railroad 
crosses the Shenandoah ; Chester Gap to be also occupied by an 
infantry detachment well entrenched ; two regiments of cavalry 
to be added to this brigade to scour the valley thoroughly. 
Under this arrangement the immediate approaches to Washing- 
ton would be covered by a strong force well entrenched, and 
able to fall back upon the city if overpowered ; while if the 
enemy advanced down the Shenandoah the force entrenched at 
Strasburg would be able to hold him in check until assistance 
could reach them by rail from Manassas. If these measures had 
been carried into effect Jackson's subsequent advance down the 
Shenandoah would have been impracticable ; but, unfortunately, 
as soon as I started for the Peninsula this region was with- 
drawn from my command, and my instructions were wholly 
disregarded. 

Again, with Manassas entrenched as I directed, Pope would 
have had a secure base of operations from which to manoeuvre, 
and the result of his campaign might have been very different. 
Certainly, if I had resumed command at Manassas instead of 
within the defences of Washington, Lee would not have ven- 
tured to cross the Potomac. 

On the ist of April, in view of what had occurred meanwhile, 
I temporarily changed the arrangements to the extent of leaving 
Banks in the Shenandoah. I placed Abercrombie in command 
at Warrenton and Manassas, under Banks's general orders, with 
7,780 men at the former and 10,859 men at the latter place, and 
1 8,coo men in Washington, so that if Abercrombie was obliged io

retire upon Washington there would be concentrated there 36,639 
men, besides 1,350 on the lower Potomac and 35,467 under 
Banks in the Shenandoah. 

In the event of an advance of the enemy in force in the Shen- 
andoah Valley, Banks could have withdrawn to his aid at least 
10,000 men from Abercrombie's command, or, in the reverse case, 
could have gone to the latter's assistance with at least 30,000 
men, leaving his Strasburg entrenchments well guarded. Had I 
remained in command I would have seen to it that the entrench- 
ments referred to were promptly executed. 

To say that the force I left behind me was, under the circum- 
stances of the case, insufficient is an untruth which proves either 
complete ignorance or wilful malevolence. The quality of the 
troops I left was amply good for the purposes in view. 

The administration actually retained about 134,000 for the 
defence of Washington, leaving me but 85,000 for operations. 

Gen. Wadsworth received clear instructions as to his duties. 
On the 4th of April the Valley of the Shenandoah was formed 
into a department under Gen. Banks, while the Department of 
the Rappahannock was constituted for McDowell. This depart- 
ment embraced " that portion of Virginia east of the Blue Ridge 
and west of the Potomac and the Fredericksburg and Rich- 
mond Railroad, including the District of Columbia and the 
country between the Potomac and the Patuxent." 

Thus, instead of operating with an army ot 156,000 men 
under my immediate command, with control of all the forces, 
supplies, and operations from the Atlantic to the Alleghanies and 
from the North Carolina line to New York, I was reduced to 
85,000 men and a little strip of ground bounded on the west by 
the railroad from Fredericksburg to Richmond, on the south by 
the James from Richmond to the mouth of the Appomattox, on 
the east by a curved line running from the mouth of the Appo- 
mattox to a point on the Chickahominy between Long's and Bot- 
tom's bridges, thence to the White House on the Pamunkey, 
thence through King and Queen Court-House to a point on the 
Rappahannock about ten miles above Urbana, and thence to the 
mouth of the Potomac, the northern boundary being the Poto- 
mac from the mouth of Acquia creek downward. My bases of 
operations at Washington and Fortress Monroe were both re- 
moved from my control, and I remained simply with my 85,000 



242 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

men, and not even the ground they occupied until I passed 
beyond White House. 

Add to this consideration that I had now only too good rea- 
son to feel assured that the administration, and especially the 
Secretary of War, were inimical to me and did not desire my sue-, 
cess, and some conception may be formed of the weight upon my 
mind at a time when whatever hopefulness and vigor I possessed 
were fully needed to overcome the difficulties in my path.

HALLECK TO McCLELLAN. 

"Sx. Louis, March 10, 8 P.M. 

" GEN. MCCLELLAN : Reserves intended for Gen. Curtis will 
now be drawn in as rapidly as possible and sent to the Tennessee 
river. I purpose going there in a few days. That is now the 
great strategic line of the Western campaign, and I am surprised 
that Gen. Buell should hesitate to reinforce me. He was too late 
at Fort Donelson, as Gen. Hunter has been in Arkansas. I am 
obliged to make my calculations independent of both. Believe 
me, general, you make a serious mistake in having three inde- 
pendent commands in the West. There never will and never 
can be any co-operation at the critical moment ; all military his- 
tory proves it. You will regret your decision against me on this- 
point. Your friendship for individuals has influenced your judg- 
ment. Be it so. I shall soon fight a great battle on the Tennes- 
see river, unsupported it seems ; but if successful it will settle. 
the campaign in the West. 

"H. W. HALLECK, 



By the time this reached me I was no longer the general-in- 
chief. It may suffice to say that I had never been intimate with; 
Buell, and that my friendship for him grew out of my admiration 
for his excellent character and high soldierly qualities. I regard- 
ed him as a far better soldier than Halleck, and the subsequent 
course of events did not modify my views. If I had placed any 
one in command of all the operations in the West it would have 
been Buell and not Halleck. I could not then place Buell in 
that position, and was consequently obliged to do the best I 
could with a divided command.

Unofficial letter. 

ROANOKE ISLAND, March 5, 1862. 
MY DEAR MAC. : My official report will be short to-day, as 

18 243 



244 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

nothing of importance has transpired since my last. It is due to 
me to say confidentially to you that we are waiting on the naval 
ammunition, our supplies having arrived some time since in suf- 
ficient quantities to move. I am embarking my men as fast as 
possible. All Reno's brigade is on board, half of Parke's, and 
half of Foster's ; and I hope to get them all on board to-morrow-, 
leaving Col. Hawkins, with three regiments, in command of the 
island. I hope to get off to-morrow night, and will move at once 
upon New Berne ; but I am not sure of it, as we cannot calculate 
upon more than one good day in the week. But we are getting 
used to storms, so that we don't mind them. How we have 
escaped with so little loss of life is to me a miracle. I feel 
thankful enough. 

During our delay here I came very near moving upon [ille- 
gible], making my headquarters there, and rushing some columns 
up to burn the bridges on the Black Water, Nottoway, and Men- 
heim, and then rush with my entire force upon Weldon and Gas- 
ton. But it is a risky move with my small force, and your orders 
are to go to New Berne. The same move can be made after we 
get New Berne (if we succeed), if you will send me men enough 
say double the force. I feel sure that I can cut the enemy's 
communications at Weldon and Gaston with an additional force 
of even two regiments. In case you decide to send them you 
must not hesitate to send any division you like, as I am quite 
willing to serve under any other officer. You know, Mac., what 
I want, and that is peace and quietness at home. If I succeed 
in taking New Berne and Fort Macon I shall at once return t> 
this place, unless otherwise ordered by you. I shall send off 
another mail very soon. If we move in the interior we will 
need more wagons say 150 and teams. Please let me know 
fully as to your wishes, and I'll follow them out to the letter. 

" It must be a great gratification to you to see all your plans 
in all parts of the army succeed. Hold on, old fellow, and don't 
let the politicians drive you. You know old Davy Crockett's 
saying : * Be sure you're right, then go ahead.' ... I have two 
parties out to burn the bridges over the Trent at New Berne and 
the Tar at Washington, the result of which I hoped to report by 
this mail, but the bad weather has doubtless delayed them.

" NEW BERNE, May 5, 1862. 

" MY DEAR MAC. : We're now in a state of ' stand still.* 
Fort Macon has been reduced, and I am ordering Parke up to 
this place with his men. We have more sickness than I like to 
acknowledge ; but we are improving, and are not weak now. If 
you want us to do anything within our strength we'll do it. 
Don't fail to command me. . . . When you start the rebels 
from Yorktown please let me know at once, and I'll give them 
a kick in the flank that will make them see stars. 

" Stick to them, old fellow, and don't allow the politicians to 
get you into a controversy. You have acted wisely, and you'll 
come out all right. In God is our trust. Tell me what to do, 
and I'll try to do it. ... You know as well as I that it is easier 
to turn a flank than force a front. God bless you ! 
" Your old friend, 

"BURNSIDE." 

MEMORANDA. 

Supposing Burnside's force 15,000: 

In event of movement on [illegible*], etc., would probably 
have to leave at least 5,000 in New Berne, 1,000 as railway 
guards, 1,000 Beaufort and Fort Macon, 500 Hatteras Inlet, 
1,000 Roanoke 8,500 in all, leaving not over 6,000 or 6,500 
for active operations ; too small to do much good. While by 
operating on Goldsborough would have to leave, say, 1,000 at 
Roanoke, 500 Beaufort, 1,000 New Berne, leaving 12,500 avail- 
able in the field. 

I would therefore think that a cautious yet bold advance on 
Goldsborough as soon as transportation arrives would produce 
a better effect than anything else that can be done, and would 
have the effect to neutralize a large portion of the enemy's force.

"WASHINGTON, March 19, 1862, 
2.30 P.M. 

" DEAR GENERAL : Fox didn't like the propeller plan ; thinks 
the channel could not be effectually obstructed in that way. I 1 
told him you and I both objected to the other (landing plan), 
which I consider an exact parallel to the expedition of Hooker's 
to capture the Potomac batteries, and where he would have got 
captured himself ; or, more truly, to the last plan, to make a 
campaign merely to take batteries as preliminary to a campaign. 
I just saw Stanton, and was most gratified by what he said. It 
was : ' Gen. McClellan has no firmer friend than myself ; but I 
may not be where I am long.' 'I think Gen. McClellan ought 
not to move till he is fully ready.' 

" I told him that the Mystic would be in Hampton Roads in 
ten days, and then we could certainly control the Merrimac and 
have a big steamer or two for Yorktown. He repeated : ' He 
ought not to put a man afloat till he is ready.' 
" In great haste,

" STEAMSHIP Minnesota, 3 P.M., 
' Thursday, March 20, 1862. 
" Gen. G. B. McClellan : 

" DEAR GENERAL : Woodbury left day before yesterday. I 
wonder I did not hear of him yesterday in town. I had an inter- 
view with Gen. Wool this morning. He was very friendly, and 
said he would do everything ; but it is a great drawback, this 
having two commanders. For instance, there are several bridges 
over Back river that ought to be rebuilt. General Wool said that 
he was going out to-day to direct one on the principal road to 
be rebuilt, but Houston told me that they expected Hamilton's 
division to do such things. Now, Hamilton is perfectly igno- 
rant of localities, and his division in the confusion of arrival. 
If Wool's force is to co-operate it is a great misfortune that it 
can't be ordered what to do. That letter expressing readiness to 
do everything amounts to nothing. Houston is here getting in- 
formation, but I have not had time to see what he has done. 

" Now for Goldsborough. He is very much in favor of rein- 
forcing Burnside and taking Norfolk from the Chowan and Cur- 
rituck ; but if this is not done his ideas are essentially coincident 
with yours landing on Back bay or York river or the Poquosin, 
at the same time with an advance from here, carrying Yorktown, 
then marching on Richmond, and then taking Norfolk. 



GEN. BARNARD'S LETTERS. 247 

" He is opposed and pronounces impracticable the operation 
proposed by Fox on Seweli's Point, and also considers any opera- 
tion on Norfolk from here impracticable while the Merrimac is 
extant He says he is responsible to the country for keeping 
down the Merrimac, and has perfect confidence that he can do 
it, but cannot spare from here anything except the following : 

" Victoria two eight-inch guns and one thirty-two-pound 
Parrott .; 

" Anacostia, Freeborn, Island Belle Potomac fleet ; 

" Octoroon not yet arrived ; Fox calls her a regular gunboat 
of four guns ; 

" Currituck merchant steamer like the Potomac gunboats, I 
suppose ; 

" Daylight merchant steamer like the Potomac gunboats, I 
suppose ; and two regular gunboats the Chocorua, not yet ar- 
rived, and the Penobscot, here these two carrying each two 
eleven-inch guns. 

" He says he can't furnish vessels to attack Yorktown simul- 
taneously, but he thinks what you propose is easily done ; that 
the vessels he mentions are fully adequate to cover a landing, 
and that, with a landing and an advance from here, Yorktown 
will fall. 

" He recommends and it may be a good idea a landing in 
the Severn simultaneously, taking Gloucester in the rear, and 
from there battering Yorktown. Yorktown and Gloucester taken, 
the small gunboats, regular and irregular, will be enough to com- 
mand the navigation of the York river. He thinks, and Gen. 
Wool thinks, that the whole attention of the enemy is concen- 
trated on Norfolk ; that they are reinforcing that place and 
increasing their batteries day and night, and that Magruder is 
not reinforced. Wool thinks that some troops passed over from 
north to south side of James river recently to reinforce Huger. 

" This is all I can write now. I must stay a little longer to 
get some definite information about the places where we propose 
to land. There are 20,000 available men (nearly) here now (in- 
cluding Wool's, Mansfield's, etc.), and 20,000 men for the land- 
ing ought to be enough for the first operations

BARNARD TO COLBURN, A. A. G. 

"WASHINGTON, March 23, 10 P.M. 
" Col. A. V. Colburn, A. A. G. : 

" I have endeavored to get some plan arranged and means 
procured for the most important part of our enterprise viz., a 
landing. The only means we have now are the bateaux. These 



248 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

I had intended to go with Capt. Duane's command and with 
McDowell's corps. I learned to-day that the Annapolis bateaux 
had been ordered to Fortress Monroe. The trestles or the india- 
rubber or the canvas boats will answer for crossing the creeks, 
and all the bateaux should be with the landing corps McDow- 
ell's. To-day I had a consultation with McDowell, and it was. 
decided to place the whole matter of providing means of landing 
under Gen. Woodbury, and to put temporarily Capt. Duane under 
his command ; to have the necessary scows, canal-boats, etc., pre- 
pared immediately ; and the bateaux are to form an essential part 
of the means. The orders have been issued by Gen. McDowell 
for that purpose. Unless the arrangements are made now it is 
out of the question to think of landing any considerable force as 
a tactical or strategical operation. One company of Duane's 
command might go with the land forces to put down trestle- 
bridges perhaps two companies ; but he himself and all the 
bateaux should go with McDowell, and Woodbury will fur- 
nish the additional men necessary and see to the getting-up of 
arrangements. Answer as soon as possible.

" Col. A. V. Colburn, A. A. G. : 

" The general's telegram received. Gen. Woodbury will go to 
headquarters to-day and concert matters so that there shall be no 
misunderstanding. The streams on the Peninsula are narrow 
where crossed by the road forty to eighty feet wide and the 
Newport News road requires no bridges. It is desirable to 
know for the constant uncertainty about this has embarrassed 
us whether Capt. Duane or any portion of his command is to 
leave before McDowell's corps ; if so, how much of it, and 
when. Let me know when to join headquarters. . . .

"WASHINGTON, March 13. 
" Gen. McClellan : 

" The Monitor is more than a match for the Merrtmac, but 
she might be disabled in the next encounter. I cannot advise so 
great dependence to be placed upon her. Burnside and Golds- 
borough are very strong for the Chowan river route to Norfolk, 
and 1 brought up maps, explanations, etc. It turns everything, 
and is only twenty-seven miles to Norfolk by two good roads. 
Burnside will have New Berne this week. The Merrimac must 
go into dock for repairs. The Monitor may, and I think will, 
destroy the Merrimac in the next fight ; but this is hope, not 
certainty.

" Assist. Sec. Navy. 

" P. S. In my opinion the Merrimac does not intend to pass 
by Fort Monroe. I am also of the opinion that we shall take her

it has now become necessary that its commander should have 
the entire control of affairs around Fortress Monroe. I would 
respectfully suggest that the simplest method of effecting this 
would be to merge the Department of Virginia with that of the 
Potomac, the name of which might properly be changed to that 
of the Department of the Chesapeake. In carrying this into

of the Department of Virginia be assigned to some other com-

Your telegram of yesterday morning received only last night. 
I hope the movement on Big Bethel was well considered in view 
of my wish not to prematurely develop our plan to the enemy. 
If the destruction of their batteries, and your subsequent return, 
confirms the idea that we are after Norfolk, all is well, except the 
mere fact of falling back. If this reaches you in time it would 
be well to hold the position of Big Bethel, if its occupation by 
the enemy can give us any trouble. You, on the ground, can 
best judge of this.

CHAPTER XV. 

The Peninsular campaign Landing at Fortress Monroe That place 
removed from his command Secretary Stanton stops all recruiting 
Advance on Richmond -Columns under fire First corps withdrawn 
from the army. 

IN the course of description of the operations preliminary to 
the siege of Yorktown, attention is necessarily directed to the 
erroneous maps in our possession, and on which certain orders 
were based. This was but a single instance among many. In 
fact, it may be broadly stated that we had no military m-aps of 
any value. This was one of our greatest difficulties, and always 
seriously interfered with our movements in the early part of the 
war. When in presence of the enemy it was necessary to recon- 
noitre under fire, the accidents of the ground being entirely un- 
known to us. 

It was a peculiar feature of our staff departments before the 
war that no measures were taken to collect topographical informa- 
tion about our own or any neighboring country. I do not know to 
what extent this has now been rectified, but there certainly should 
be some bureau charged with the collection and arrangement of 
topographical and statistical information in regard to our own and 
adjacent countries. It is true that the Confederates were no bet- 
ter off for correct maps than ourselves, but they possessed the 
inestimable advantage of operating on their own ground, which 
they knew perfectly well ; they had plenty of good guides ; and 
as they usually conducted a defensive campaign, they had plenty 
of time to construct maps and acquaint themselves thoroughly 
with the ground in the interests of active operations. Moreover, 
the white people, at least, were usually in their favor and acted 
as scouts, guides, and spies. Even when the negroes were favor- 
able to us they seldom possessed the intelligence required to give 
any value to their information. They rarely knew more of the 
country than the plantations on which they had passed their 
lives, could give no accurate or intelligible description of roads 
or accidents of the ground, and their estimates of numbers were 

253 



254 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

almost always ridiculously inaccurate. If a negro were asked 
how many Confederates he had seen at a certain point his answer 
was very likely to be : "I dunno, massa, but I guess about a 
million." 

I went on board the steamer Commodore on the afternoon of 
the ist of April, off Alexandria, and remained at anchor until an 
early hour next morning, being engaged all night in giving the 
necessary orders for the conduct of affairs in front of Washing- 
ton, the movements of troops, supplies, etc. 

I reached Fort Monroe on the afternoon of the 2d, still under 
the delusion that I should have an active army of 146,000 and 
the full control of my base of operations, and that I should 
receive efficient support from the navy. 

According to the best information in our possession in regard 
to the Peninsula, our main road extended from Fortress Monroe, 
through Hampton and Big Bethel, to Yorktown ; while another 
existed from Newport News, nearly parallel with the James 
river, and passing through Warwick Court-House to the Half- 
way House, where it met the main road from Yorktown to 
Williamsburg. Both of these roads between Yorktown and the 
point of the Peninsula were intersected by many streams, and 
we had information to the effect that many of these crossings 
as, for example, Big Bethel, Young's Mill, Howard's bridge, 
Cockletown, etc. were strongly entrenched and would be obsti- 
nately defended. 

Our information seemed also to be clear that the Warwick 
river ran alongside of the Newport News road, which crossed only 
an insignificant branch, and that it presented no obstacle to a 
march on the Halfway House in rear of Yorktown. 

After the Fort Monroe movement was decided upon my first 
intention was to inaugurate the operation by despatching the ist 
corps in mass to the Sand-Box, three or four miles south of 
Yorktown, in order to turn all the entrenched crossings referred 
to, and receive a base of supplies as near as possible to York- 
town ; or else, should the condition of affairs at the moment ren- 
der it desirable, to land it on the Gloucester side of the York 
river at the mouth of the Severn, and throw it upon West Point. 
But transports arrived so slowly, and the pressure of the adminis- 
tration for a movement was so strong and unreasonable, that I 
felt obliged to embark the troops by divisions as fast as trans- 



256 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

ports arrived, and then determined to hold the ist corps to the 
last, and land it as a unit whenever the state of affairs promised 
the best results. A few hours after I had determined to act 
upon this determination McDowell telegraphed me from Wash- 
ington, suggesting that the troops should be embarked by divi* 
sions, according to convenience, instead of awaiting the arrival of 
sufficient transports to move his whole corps. Soon after this I 
was more than once informed that Gen. McDowell and others in 
Washington had instanced this decision to embark the troops by 
divisions as a proof that I had disobeyed the President's order as 
to the formation of army corps, and that I intended to throw 
obstacles in the way of its fulfilment. 

Considerable delay occurred in the arrival of the sailing trans- 
ports for horses, in consequence of an order being given, without 
my knowledge, for the steamers to come to Alexandria without 
them. 

The first division which had embarked was Hamilton's, 
formerly Heintzelman's, of the 3d corps, which sailed on the 
iyth of March; it was followed by Gen. F. J. Porter's division 
of the same corps on the 22d of March. Gen. Heintzelman 
accompanied Porter's division, and was instructed to get his 
corps in condition for an advance without delay. He was also 
ordered to encamp his two divisions some three or four miles out 
from Fort Monroe, in good defensive position, and to push out 
strong reconnoissances to ascertain the position and the strength 
of the enemy, without going so far out as to destroy the impres- 
sion that our movements might be intended against Norfolk. 

On the 27th he sent Porter towards Big Bethel and Howard's 
bridge, and Smith towards Young's Mill, on the James river 
road. 

Porter occupied Big Bethel and pushed one brigade four 
miles further, sending skirmishers on to Howard's bridge, where 
they saw entrenchments occupied. Deserters reported Magruder 
at the place with 800 men. Smith went as far as Watt's Creek, 
where he found no entrenchments, and gained information that 
the enemy held Young's Mill in strong force. Both divisions 
returned to their camps after completing the reconnoissance. 
Heintzelman reported that, from the best information, Magru- 
der had from 15,000 to 20,000 men, and gave not the slightest 
indication that he thought he could take or invest Yorktown. 



A D VANCE TO WARD RICHMOND. 257 

On the 3d of April there were of my command in the vicin- 
ity of Fort Monroe the 3d Penn. Cavalry, the 2d, 5th, and a 
part of the ist U. S. Cavalry, a part of the reserve artillery, 
two divisions each of the 3d and 4th corps ready to move, one 
division of the 2d corps, Sykes's brigade of U. S. Infantry. 
Casey's division of the 4th corps was at Newport News, but 
totally unprovided with transportation. Richardson's division 
of the 2d corps and Hooker's of the 3d had not yet arrived. 
The troops ready to advance numbered about 53,000 men and 
100 guns less than 45,000 effectives. The amount of wagon- 
transportation arrived was altogether insufficient for a long move- 
ment, and it became necessary to advance in order to establish 
new depots on the shore more to the front. It was evident that 
to await any considerable accession of force and transportation 
would involve a delay of many days ; I therefore determined to 
advance on the 4th of April. 

The following telegram of April 3 to Mr. Stanton requires no 
explanation : 

I expect to move from here to-morrow morning on Yorktown, 
where a force of some 15,000 of the rebels are in an entrenched 
position, and I think it quite probable they will attempt to resist 
us. No appearance of the Merrimac as yet. Commodore Golds- 
borough is quite confident he can sink her when she comes out. 

Before I left Washington an order had been issued by the 
War Department placing Fort Monroe and its dependencies 
under my control, and authorizing me to draw from the troops 
under Gen. Wool a division of about 10,000 men, which was to 
be assigned to the ist corps. 

During the night of the 3d I received a telegram from the 
adjutant-general of the army stating that, by the President's 
order, I was deprived of all control over Gen. Wool and the 
troops under his command, and forbidden to detach any of his 
troops without his sanction. 

This order left me without any base of operations under my 
own control. 

On my arrival at Fortress Monroe I was informed that the 
enemy had been very active for some days past in crossing troops 
over the James river on the line of communication between York- 
town and Norfolk. Reports were conflicting as to the direction 



258 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

of this movement, but in any event it seemed proper under the 
circumstances to move on Yorktown as promptly as possible with 
the troops in hand, in order to invest the place before further 
reinforcements and supplies could reach it. 

On the same day, on the very eve of the advance of the Army 
of the Potomac into the enemy's country, with the certainty of 
heavy losses by battle and disease, was issued the order putting 
a complete stop to the recruiting service for the volunteers and 
breaking up all the recruiting stations : 

General Order No. 33. 

"ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, U. S. A., 
" WASHINGTON, April 3, 1862. 

" III. The recruiting service for volunteers will be discon- 
tinued in every State from this date. The officers detached on 
the Volunteer Recruiting Service will join their regiments with- 
out delay, taking with them the parties and recruits at their re- 
spective stations. 

" The superintendents of the Volunteer Recruiting Service 
will disband their parties and close their offices, after having 
taken the necessary steps to carry out these orders. The public 
property belonging to the Volunteer Recruiting Service will be 
sold to the best advantage possible, and the proceeds credited to 
the fund for cbllecting, drilling, and organizing volunteers. 
" By order of the Secretary of War. 

" L. THOMAS, 
"Adj.-Gen. U. S. A." 

Common sense and the experience of all wars prove that 
when an army takes the field every possible effort should be 
made at home to collect recruits and establish depots, whence 
the inevitable daily losses may be made good with instructed 
men as fast as they occur, so that the fighting force may be kept 
up to their normal strength. Failure to do this proves either a 
desire for the failure of the campaign or entire incompetence. 
Between the horns of this dilemma the friends of Mr. Stanton 
must take their choice. 

During the preceding autumn I advocated a system of draft- 
ing, but was not listened to. Had it been adopted at that time, 
when recruiting was rapid and easy, it could have been estab- 
lished and well regulated without difficulty and without any 
shock to the country. The system as finally adopted was as 
bad as bad could be, and cannot be defended. It was unneces- 



RECRUITING STOPPED. 259 

sary to disturb all the relations of society and the business inte- 
rests of the country, and the numbers called out were absurdly 
large. 

The numbers of troops on foot in April, 1862, in the various 
parts of the country, were ample for the suppression of the rebel- 
lion, if they had been properly handled and their numbers made 
good by a constant stream of recruits poured into the old regi- 
ments, so as to keep them always at their full strength. Instead 
of this, spasmodic calls for large numbers of men were made, and 
the general rule was to organize them into new regiments, often 
allowing the invaluable old regiments to die out. This system 
was infinitely more expensive, but gave the opportunity to pro- 
mote personal or political favorites. The new regiments required 
a long time to make them serviceable, while the same men placed 
in the old regiments, under experienced officers and surrounded 
by veterans, would in a few days become efficient soldiers. 
Another grave defect of this system was the destructive effects 
on the esprit de corps of the old officers and men an invaluable 
adjunct in war. 

Out of these wholesale drafts grew the system of substitutes 
and bounties, which cost so many unnecessary millions to the 
country, and so seriously affected the quality of the troops in the 
latter years of the war. 

Never in the whole history of nations was anything more 
absurdly and recklessly managed than the whole system of re- 
cruiting, drafting, and organization under the regime of Secretary 
Stanton. When his actions are coolly criticised, apart from the 
influence of party feeling, his administration will be regarded as 
unparalleled in history for blunders and ignorant self-assertion. 
He unnecessarily prolonged the war at least two years, and at 
least tripled its cost in blood and treasure. 

The movement was made by the two roads already men- 
tioned : the two divisions of the 4th corps from Newport News 
via Warwick Court-House ; the two divisions of the 3d, sup- 
ported by Sedgwick's division of the 2d corps, Sykes's brigade, 
and the reserve artillery, by the road from Hampton and Big 
Bethel to Yorktown. The advance on Big Bethel would turn 
the works at Young's Mill .and open the way for the 4th corps ; 
while, in turn, the advance of the latter corps on Warwick Court- 
House would turn the works at Howard's bridge and Ship Point, 



2 6O McCLELLAN'S O WN 3TOR Y. 

and open the road of the right column to the immediate vicinity 
of Yorktown. 

Smith's division (4th corps) encamped on the 4th of April at 
Young's Mill, with one brigade in advance on the road from Big 
Bethel to Warwick ; Couch's division on Fisher's creek. 

Porter, on the same day, occupied Cockletown with Morell's 
division and a battery, his pickets a mile in advance near Pavis's 
house ; the other brigades of the division less than two miles in 
rear of Morell. Averill's cavalry found the Ship Point batteries 
abandoned. They were strong and well constructed, with deep 
wet ditches ; they had platforms and magazine for siege-guns, all 
the guns withdrawn ; there were excellent quarters for three regi- 
ments of ten companies each. Hamilton's division encamped 
about two miles in rear of Howard's creek. The reserve cav- 
alry, artillery, and infantry bivouacked with headquarters at Big 
Bethel. Gen. Heintzelman learned during the evening that there 
were no batteries between Porter and Yorktown ; that Yorktown 
was strongly fortified ; that its garrison until recently consisted 
of 10,000 men, but was then increased to 20,000 or 25,000 ; 
that there were more troops at Williamsburg, and batteries about 
two miles south of it, and that reinforcements were said to have 
come from Richmond. Gen. Heintzelman concluded that the 
enemy had no idea of abandoning Yorktown. During the same 
afternoon Gen. Keyes, commanding the left column, received 
information that from 5,000 to 8,000 of the enemy were strongly 
entrenched at Lee's Mill. Still ignorant of the true course of the 
Warwick and of its relations to the entrenchments at Lee's Mill, 
and alive to the necessity of preventing further reinforcements to 
the garrison at Yorktown, I, on the evening of the 4th, ordered 
the movements for the 5th as follows : 

Smith's division to move at six A.M. via Warwick Court-House 
to the Halfway House on the Yorktown and Williamsburg road ; 
Couch's division to move at the same hour and close up on 
Smith at the Halfway House ; any positions of the enemy met 
with on the way to be carried by assault without delay ; on 
reaching the Halfway House the corps to occupy the narrow 
dividing ridge at that point, so as to prevent the escape or rein- 
forcement of the garrison of Yorktown. 

Porter's division to close up on its advanced guard at six 
A.M., and move forward to an intersection of roads about two 



' ADVANCE MOVEMENTS. 26 1 

and three-quarter miles from Yorktovvn, there to halt and send 
out reconnoitring parties, to cover the reconnoissances of the 
engineer officers, etc. 

Hamilton's division to move at the same hour and close up 
on Porter. Sedgwick, temporarily attached to headquarters, to 
move with the reserves to Dr. Pavis's house, where the road to 
Lee's Mill diverged, and there await orders. 

If Heintzelman found it possible to assault the works at York- 
town immediately, the reserves were in position to support him ; 
if he found an assault impracticable, and Keyes needed assist- 
ance in carrying out his orders, the reserves were in position to 
move at once to his support. If Keyes had succeeded in passing 
Lee's Mill and reaching the Halfway House, I should at once 
have gone to his support with all the reserves and one of Heintz- 
elman's divisions, thus holding the key-point of the operation 
with four divisions of infantry, the brigade of regulars, the cav- 
alry and artillery reserves. 

In consequence of the heavy rains the roads were very bad 
and the troops moved with difficulty, so that little of Keyes's 
artillery and none of the ammunition, forage, and provision trains 
could be brought up. Heintzelman early in the day came under 
the artillery-fire of the works of Yorktown, and soon saw that an 
assault was impracticable. Keyes also found himself brought to 
a halt by the artillery-fire of the Lee's Mill works, and discov- 
ered that they were covered by the Warwick river, rendering 
any attempt at assault utterly out of the question. 

It was at this moment, with the leading division of each 
column under a hot artillery-fire, and the skirmishers of the 3d 
corps engaged, being myself with Porter's division, that I received 
the telegram informing me of the withdrawal of the ist corps 
(McDowell's) from my command: 

"ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, 

"April 4, 1862. 
" Gen. McClellan : 

" By directions of the President Gen. McDowell's army corps 
has been detached from the force under your immediate com- 
mand, and the general is ordered to report to the Secretary of 
War ; letter by mail. 

" L. THOMAS, 

" Adj.-Gcn" 



CHAPTER XVI. 

Effects of reduction of the army Overthrow of the campaign New 
campaign with reduced army Siege of Yorktown. 

SOON after receiving the telegram I sent the following to the 
Secretary of War, dated April 5 : 

The enemy are in large force along our front, and apparently 
intend making a determined resistance. A reconnoissance just 
made by Gen. Barnard shows that their line of works extends 
across the entire Peninsula from Yorktown to Warwick river. 
Many of them are -formidable. Deserters say that they are being 
reinforced daily from Richmond and from Norfolk. Under the 
circumstances I beg that you will reconsider the order detaching 
the ist corps from my command. 

In my deliberate judgment the success of our cause will be 
imperilled by so greatly reducing my force when it is actually 
under the fire of the enemy and active operations have com- 
menced. Two of my divisions have been under fire of artillery 
during most of the day. I am now of the opinion that I shall 
have to fight all the available force of the rebels not far from 
here. Do not force me to do so with diminished ranks ; but 
whatever your decision may be, I will leave nothing undone to 
obtain success. 

If you cannot leave me the whole of the ist corps, I urgently 
ask, as a military necessity, that I may not lose Franklin and his 
division. 

On the same day, at ten P.M., I sent the following to Sec- 
retary Stanton : 

Since Gen. Woodbury's brigade of volunteer engineer troops 
was only temporarily attached to the ist corps for special service, 
and is much needed here, I have directed Gen. Woodbury to 
bring it here at once. Their services are indispensable. 

The following letter was written during the evening of April 5 : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF POTOMAC, 
CAMP NEAR YORKTOWN, April 5, 1862. 

Brig. -Gen. L. Thomas, Adj. -Gen. U. S. A. : 

GENERAL : I have now a distinct knowledge of the general 
position of the enemy in my front. His left is in Yorktown ; his 



EFFECTS OF REDUCTION OF ARMY. 263 

line thence extends along and in rear of the Warwick river to its 
mouth. That stream is an obstacle of great magnitude. It is 
fordable at only one point (so far as I yet know) below its head, 
which is near Yorktown ; is for several miles unfordable, and 
has generally a very marshy valley. His batteries and entrench- 
ments render this line an exceedingly formidable one, entirely 
too much so (so far as I now understand it) to be carried by a 
simple assault. I shall employ to-morrow in reconnoissances, 
repairing roads, establishing a depot at Ship's Point, and in 
bringing up supplies. 

Porter, the head of the right column, has moved as close 
upon the town as the enemy's guns will permit ; he is encamped 
there, supported by Hamilton's division. Porter has been under 
fire all the afternoon. But five men killed. His rifled field- 
guns and sharpshooters have caused some loss to the enemy. 
Keyes, with two divisions, is in front of Lee's Mill, where the 
road from Newport News to Williamsburg crosses Warwick river. 
He has been engaged in an artillery combat of several hours' 
duration, losing some five killed. At Lee's Mill we have a 
causeway covered by formidable batteries. The information 
obtained at Fort Monroe in regard to the topography of the 
country and the position and strength of the enemy has been 
unreliable. He is in strong force and very strong position. If 
the reconnoissances of to-morrow verify the observations of 
to-day, we shall be obliged to use much heavy artillery before 
we can force their lines and isolate the garrison of Yorktown. 
I omitted to state that I hold the reserves in a central position 
until I can learn more of the condition of affairs. The present 
aspect of affairs renders it exceedingly unfortunate that the ist 
corps has been detached from my command. It is no longer in 
my power to make a movement from the Severn river upon 
Gloucester and West Point. I am reduced to a front attack 
upon a very strong line. I still hope that the order detaching 
the ist corps may be reconsidered. I do not feel that without 
it I have force sufficient to accomplish the objects I have pro- 
posed in this campaign with that certainty, rapidity, and com- 
pleteness which I had hoped to obtain. The departments will, 
I trust, realize that more caution will be needed on my part 
after having been so unexpectedly deprived of so very large a 
portion of my force when actually having my troops under fire. 
I have frankly stated what I now consider to be the strength of 
the enemy's position ; the reconnoissances of to-morrow may 
modify my opinion. Whatever the facts may be, I shall make 
the best use I can of the force at my disposal, determined to gain 
my point as completely and as rapidly as may be. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen, Commanding. 



264 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

P. S. All my movements up to this evening were predicated 
upon the expectation that no more troops would be detached 
from my command. I have involved my troops in actual con- 
flict upon that supposition, and calculating upon the prompt 
arrival of the ist corps as a part of the programme. It has just 
occurred to me to say that the maps of the Peninsula I sent to 
the President and secretary are perfectly unreliable ; the roads 
are wrong, and the Warwick river crosses the Newport News 
and Williamsburg road some three miles above Warwick Court- 
House, which latter place is about one mile from the road. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. 

This, then, was the situation in which I found myself on the 
evening of April 5 : Flag-Officer Goldsborough had informed me 
that it was not in his power to control the navigation of the 
James river so as to enable me to use it as a line of supply, or 
to cross it, or even to cover my left flank ; nor could he, as he 
thought, furnish any vessels to attack the batteries of Yorktown 
and Gloucester, or to run by them in the dark and thus cut off 
the supplies of the enerny by water and control their land-com- 
munication. I was thus deprived of the co-operation of the 
navy and left to my own resources. 

I had been deprived of five infantry divisions, and out of the 
four left to me there were present at the front five divisions of 
volunteer regiments, the weak brigade of regulars, Hunt's artil- 
lery reserve, and a small cavalry force. 

Owing to the lack of wagons Casey did not reach Young's 
Mill until the i6th. Richardson's division reached the front 
on the same day. Hooker's division commenced arriving at 
Ship's Point on the loth. The roads were so bad and wagons 
so few that it was with the utmost difficulty supplies could be 
brought up, and the field-artillery moved with great difficulty. 
Even the headquarters wagons could not get up, and I slept in 
a deserted hut with my saddle-blanket for a bed. 

My telegram of April 7 to the President shows that only 
53,000 men had joined me, so that I had not more than 44,000 
effectives, and found myself in front of a position which ap- 
parently could not be carried by assault. The force was too 
small to attempt any movement to turn Gloucester without the 
assistance of the navy, and I was obliged to abandon the plan 
of rapid turning movements which I had intended to carry out. 



WA SUING TON INTERFERENCE. 265 

All that could be done was to halt where \ve were, and by 
close reconnoissances ascertain whether there were any weak 
points which we could assault, or, failing in that, determine 
what could be effected with the aid of siege-artillery to cover 
the attack. 

Next day, April 6, I sent the following telegram to his 
excellency the President : 

The order forming new departments, if rigidly enforced, 
deprives me of the power of ordering up wagons and troops 
absolutely necessary to enable me to advance to Richmond. I 
have by no means the transportation I must have to move my 
army even a few miles. I respectfully request I may not be 
placed in this position, but that my orders for wagons, trains, 
and ammunition, and other material that I have prepared and 
necessarily left behind me, as well as Woodbury's brigade, may 
at once be complied with. The enemy is strong in my front, and 
I have a most serious task before me, in the fulfilment of which 
I need all the aid the government can give me. I again repeat 
the urgent request that Gen. Franklin and his division may be 
restored to my command. 

I received the following reply from Secretary Stanton : 

" The President directs me to say that your despatch to him 
has been received. Gen. Simmer's corps is on the road to you 
and will go forward as fast as possible. Franklin's division is 
now on the advance towards Manassas. There is no means of 
transportation here to send it forward in time to be of service in 
your present optrations. Telegraph frequently, and all in the 
power of the government shall be done to sustain you as occasion 
may require." 

And this from the President : 

" Yours of eleven A.M. to-day received. Secretary of War 
informs me that the forwarding of transportation, ammunition, 
and Woodbury's brigade under your order has not and will not 
be interfered with. You now have over one hundred thousand 
troops with you, independent of Gen. Wool's command. I think 
you had better break the enemy's line from Yorktown to War- 
wick river at once. This will probably use time as advantageous- 
ly as you can. 

"A. LINCOLN, 

"President." 



266 McCLELLAN*S OWN STORY. 

To this I replied, April 7, to the President : 

Your telegram of yesterday received. In reply I have the 
honor to state that my entire force for duty only amounts to 
about eighty-five thousand (85,000) men. Gen. Wool's com- 
mand, as you will observe from the accompanying order, has 
been taken out of my control, although he has most cheerfully 
co-operated with me. The only use that can be made of his 
command is to protect my communications in rear of this point. 
At this time only fifty-three thousand (53,000) men have joined 
me, but they are coming up as rapidly as my means of transpor- 
tation will permit. Please refer to my despatch to the Secretary 
of War of to-night for the details of our present situation. 

I find on the back of my retained copy of this despatch the 
following memorandum made at the time by myself ' 

Return of March 31, 1862, shows men present for duty 171,602 

Deduct ist corps, infantry and artillery, . 32,119

85,792 85,792 

85,810 

Officers, about 3,900. 
Total absent from whole command, 23,796. 

As this memorandum was a calculation to ascertain only the 
number of troops left under my command, it did not take into 
consideration all the troops left behind which did not compose 
parts of the total of 171,602 for duty. My letters of April i, 
show that many more were left in addition to those mentioned 
in this memorandum. 

The telegram referred to in my despatch to the President was 
the following, of April 7, to Secretary Stanton : 

Your telegram of yesterday arrived here while I was absent 
examining the enemy's right, which I did pretty closely. . . . 
The whole line of the Warwick, which really heads within a 
mile of Yorktown, is strongly defended by detached redoubts 
and other fortifications, armed with heavy and light guns. The 
approaches, except at Yorktown, are covered by the Warwick, 
over which there is but one, or at most two, passages, both of 



REDUCTION OF FORCE. 26 J 

which are covered by strong batteries. It will be necessary to 
resort to the use of heavy guns and some siege operations before 
we assault. All the prisoners state that Gen. J. E. Johnston 
arrived at Yorktown yesterday with strong reinforcements. It 
seems clear that I shall have the whole force of the enemy on my 
hands probably not less than (100,000) one hundred thousand 
men, and possibly more. In consequence of the loss of Blenker's 
division and the ist corps my force is possibly less than that of 
the enemy, while they have all the advantage of position. 

I am under great obligations to you for the offer that the 
whole force and material of the government will be as fully and 
as speedily under my command as heretofore, or as if the new 
departments had not been created. 

Since my arrangements were made for this campaign at least 
(50,000) fifty thousand men have been taken from my command. 
Since my despatch of the 5th instant five divisions have been in 
close observation of the enemy, and frequently exchanging shots. 
When my present command all joins I shall have about (85,000) 
eighty-five thousand men for duty, from which a large force must 
be taken for guards, scouts, etc. With this army I could assault 
the enemy's works, and perhaps carry them. But were I in pos- 
session of their entrenchments, and assailed by double my num- 
bers, I should have no fears as to the result. 

Under the circumstances that have been developed since we 
arrived here, I feel fully impressed with the conviction that here 
is to be fought the great battle that is to decide the existing con- 
test. I shall, of course, commence the attack as soon as I can 
get up my siege-train, and shall do all in my power to carry ; the 
enemy's works ; but to do this with a reasonable degree of cer- 
tainty requires, in my judgment, that I should, if possible, have 
at least the whole of the ist corps to land upon the Severn river 
and attack Gloucester in the rear. 

My present strength will not admit of a detachment sufficient 
for this purpose without materially impairing the efficiency of 
this column. Flag-Officer Goldsborough thinks the works too 
strong for his available vessels unless I can turn Gloucester. I 
send by mail copies of his letter and one of the commander of 
the gunboats here. 

Gen. Keyes, commanding 4th army corps, after the examina- 
tion of the enemy's defences on the left, addressed the following 
letter to the Hon. Ira Harris, U. S. Senate, and gave me a copy. 
It describes the situation at that time in some respects so well 
that I introduce it here : 

" HEADQUARTERS, 4TH CORPS, 
"WARWICK COURT-HOUSE, VA., April 7, 1862. 
" MY DEAR SENATOR : The plan of campaign on this line was 



268 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

made with the distinct understanding that/0&r army corps should 
be employed, and that the navy should co-operate in the taking 
of Yorktown, and also (as I understood it) support us on our left 
by moving gunboats up James river. 

"To-day I have learned that the ist corps, which by the 
President's order was to embrace four divisions, and one division 
(Blenker's) of the 2d corps, have been withdrawn altogether from 
this line of operations and from the Army of the Potomac. At 
the same time, as I am informed, the navy has not the means to 
attack Yorktown, and is afraid to send gunboats up James river 
for fear of the Merrimac. 

" The above plan of campaign was adopted unanimously by 
Maj.-Gen. McDowell and Brig.-Gens. Sumner, Heintzelman, and 
Keyes, and was concurred in by Maj.-Gen. McClellan, who first 
proposed Urbana as our base. 

"This army being reduced by forty-five thousand troops, 
some of them among the best in the service, and without the 
support of the navy, the plan to which we are reduced bears 
scarcely any resemblance to the one I voted for. 

"I command the James river column, and I left my camp 
near Newport News the morning of the 4th instant. I only suc- 
ceeded in getting my artillery ashore the afternoon of the day 
before, and one of my divisions had not all arrived in camp the 
day I left, and for the want of transportation has not yet joined 
me. So you will observe that not a day was lost in the advance, 
and in fact we marched so quickly and so rapidly that many of 
our animals were twenty-four and forty-eight hours without a 
ration of forage. But, notwithstanding the rapidity of our ad- 
vance, we were stopped by a line of defence nine or ten miles 
long, strongly fortified by breastworks, erected nearly the whole 
distance behind a stream or succession of ponds, nowhere ford- 
able, one terminus being Yorktown and the other ending in the 
James river, which is commanded by the enemy's gunboats. 
Yorktown is fortified all around with bastioned works, and on 
the water-side it and Gloucester ar'e so strong that the navy are 
afraid to attack either. 

" The approaches on one side are generally through low, 
swampy, or thickly wooded ground, over roads which we are 
obliged to repair or to make before we can get forward our car- 
riages. The enemy is in great force, and is constantly receiving 
reinforcements from the two rivers. The line in front of us is 
therefore one of the strongest ever opposed to an invading force 
in any country. 

" You will, then, ask why I advocated such a line for our ope- 
rations ? My reasons are few but, I think, good. 

" With proper assistance from the navy we could take York- 
town, and then with gunboats on both rivers we could beat any 
force opposed to us on Warwick river, because the shot and shell 



LETTER OF GEN. KEYES. 269 

from the gunboats would nearly overlap across the Peninsula ; so 
that if the enemy should retreat and retreat he must he would 
have a long way to go without rail or steam transportation, and 
every soul of his army must fall into our hands or be destroyed. 
Another reason for my supporting the new base and plan 
was that this line, it was expected, would furnish water-transpor- 
tation nearly to Richmond. 

" Now, supposing we succeed in breaking through the line in 
front of us, what can we do next ? The roads are very bad, and 
if the enemy retains command of James river, and we do not 
first reduce Yorktown, it would be impossible for us to subsist 
this army three marches beyond where it is now. As the roads 
are at present, it is with the utmost difficulty that we can subsist 
it in the position it now occupies. 

" You will see, therefore, by what I have said, that the force 
originally intended for the capture of Richmond should be all 
sent forward. If I thought the four army corps necessary when 
I supposed the navy would co-operate, and when I judged of the 
obstacles to be encountered by what I learned from maps and 
the opinions of officers long stationed at Fort Monroe, and from 
all other sources, how much more should I think the full comple- 
ment of troops requisite now that the navy cannot co-operate, 
and now that the strength of the enemy's lines and the number 
of his guns and men prove to be almost immeasurably greater 
than I had been led to expect ! The line in front of us, in the 
opinion of all the military men here who are at all competent to 
judge, is one of the strongest in the world, and the force of the 
enemy capable of being increased beyond the numbers we now 
have to oppose to him. Independently of the strength of the 
lines in front of us, and of the force of the enemy behind them, 
we cannot advance until we get command of either York river or 
James river. The efficient co-operation of the navy is, therefore, 
absolutely essential, and so I considered it when I voted to 
change our base from the Potomac to Fort Monroe. 

" An iron-clad boat must attack Yorktown ; and if several 
strong gunboats could be sent up James river also, our success 
will be certain and complete, and the rebellion will soon be put 
down. 

" On the other hand, we must butt against the enemy's works 
with heavy artillery and a great waste of time, life, and material. 

" If we break through and advance, both our flanks will be 
assailed from two great water-courses in the hands of the enemy ; 
our supplies would give out> and the enemy, equal, if not supe- 
rior, in numbers, would, with the other advantages, beat and 
destroy this army. 

"The greatest master of the art of war has said that * if you 
would invade a country successfully, you must have one line of 
operations and one army, under one general.' But what is our 



270 McCLELLAN 'S OWN STORY. 

condition ? The State of Virginia is made to constitute the com- 
mand, in part or wholly, of some six generals, viz. : Fremont, 
Banks, McDowell, Wool, Burnside, and McClellan, besides the 
scrap, over the Chesapeake, in the care of Dix. 

" The great battle of the war is to come off here. If we win 
it the rebellion will be crushed. If we lose it the consequences 
will be more horrible than I care to foretell. The plan of cam- 
paign I voted for, if carried out with the means proposed, will 
certainly succeed. If any part of the means proposed are with- 
held or diverted, I deem it due to myself to say that our success 
will be uncertain. 

" It is no doubt agreeable to the commander of the ist corps 
to have a separate department, and, as this letter advocates his 
return to Gen. McClellan's command, it is proper to state that I 
am not at all influenced by personal regard or dislike to any of 
my seniors in rank. If I were to credit all the opinions which 
have been poured into my ears, I must believe that, in regard to 
my present fine command, I owe much to Gen. McDowell and 
nothing to Gen. McClellan. But I have disregarded all such offi- 
ciousness, and I have from last July to the present day supported 
Gen. McClellan and obeyed all his orders with as hearty a good- 
will as though he had been my brother or the friend to whom I 
owed most. I shall continue to do so to the last and so long as 
he is my commander, and I am not desirous to displace him, and 
would not if I could. He left Washington with the understand- 
ing that he was to execute a definite plan of campaign with cer- 
tain prescribed means. The plan was good and the means suf- 
ficient, and, without modification, the enterprise was certain of 
success. But, with the reduction of force and means, the plan is 
entirely changed, and is now a bad plan, with means insufficient 
for certain success. 

" Do not look upon this communication as the offspring of 
despondency. I never despond ; and when you see me working 
the hardest you may be sure that fortune is frowning upon me. 
I am working now to my utmost. 

" Please show this letter to the President, and I should like 
also that Mr. Stanton should know its contents. Do me the 
honor to write to me as soon as you can, and believe me, with 
perfect respect, 

" Your most obedient servant, 

"E. D. KEYES, 
" Brig. -Gen. Commanding tfh Army Corps. 

" Hon. IRA HARRIS, 

"U. S. Senate." 

The reconnoissances of the 6th and ;th and following days, 
pushed with great vigor and with some loss, confirmed the 
impressions gained on the 5th. I verified all these reconnois- 



272 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

sances in person, going everywhere beyond our lines of pickets, 
and resuming my old trade of reconnoitring officer, so anxious 
was I to find a practicable point of attack. In fact, during the 
whole siege I exposed myself more in this way th.m was proper 
for a general commanding an army ; but I had had far more 
personal experience in sieges than any of those under my com- 
mand, and trusted more to my own knowledge and experience 
than I then could to theirs. 

It was found that the Warwick valley headed within two thou- 
sand yards of the enceinte of Yorktown, and within half that dis- 
tance of the White Redoubt, or Fort Magruder, a strong work, 
essentially a part of the main works at Yorktown, which were so 
strong having ditches from eight to ten feet deep, and more 
than fifteen feet wide at the top and so heavily armed with siege 
and garrison guns, as to render an assault hopeless. The inter- 
val between Yorktown and the Warwick was occupied by strong 
works, and all the open ground in front, as well as the direct 
approaches to the town itself, so thoroughly swept by the direct 
fire of more than fifty guns of the heaviest calibres then known 
as to render it an act of madness to assault without first silencing 
the fire of the enemy's artillery. From its head to Lee's Mill the 
Warwick was flooded by means of artificial inundations, which 
rendered it unfordable. The dams constructed for this purpose 
were all covered by strong works so situated as to be unassailable 
until their artillery-fire was reduced. Below Lee's Mill the river 
was a tidal stream, not fordable at any stage of the tide. That 
portion, moreover, was controlled by the fire of the Confederate 
gunboats in the James river. The valley of the Warwick was 
generally low and swampy, the approaches to the dams were 
through dense forests and deep swamps, and every precaution 
had been taken by the enemy, in the way of felling timber and 
constructing works, to make a crossing as difficult as possible. 

In his report of the 6th of May, immediately after the 
occupation of Yorktown, Gen. Barnard, chief-engineer of the 
Army of the Potomac, says : 

" They (referring to the groups of works covering the War- 
wick), are far more extensive than may be supposed from the 
mention of them I make, and every kind of obstruction which the 
country affords, such as abattis, marsh, inundation, etc., was skil- 
fully used. The line is certainly one of the most extensive 




273 



274 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

known to modern times. The country on both sides the War- 
wick from near Yorktown down is a dense forest with few clear- 
ings. It was swampy, and the roads impassable during the heavy 
rains we have constantly had, except where our own labors had 
corduroyed them. If we could have broken the enemy's line 
across the isthmus we could have invested Yorktown, and it 
must, with its garrison, have soon fallen into our hands. It was 
not deemed practicable, considering the strength of that line and 
the difficulty of handling our forces (owing to the impracticable 
character of the country), to do so. If we could take Yorktown 
or drive the enemy out of that place, the enemy's line was no 
longer tenable. This we could do by siege operations. It was 
deemed too hazardous to attempt the reduction of the place by 
assault. The operations of the siege required extensive prepara- 
tions. 

" I regret that there is not time and means to prepare a com- 
plete plan of this enormous system of defences. They should 
form part of the record of the operations of the Army of the 
Potomac. . The forcing of such a line with so little loss is in itself 
an exploit, less brilliant, perhaps, but more worthy of study, than 
would have been a murderous assault, even had it proved suc- 
cessful." 

I need only add to this that Gen. Barnard never expressed to 
me any opinion that an assault was practicable upon any part of 
the enemy's defences. From his first reconnoissances he was 
decidedly of the opinion that the use of heavy guns was neces- 
sary. More than this, I never, at the time, heard of any contrary 
opinion from any one, and, so far as I know, there was entire 
unanimity on the part of the general officers and chiefs of staff 
departments that the course pursued was the only one prac- 
ticable under the circumstances. 

From Lee's Mill a line of works extended to the enemy's rear 
to Skiff's creek, so that if we had forced the passage of the War- 
wick below that point we would have found a new line of 
defence in front of us, completely covering the enemy's com- 
munications. 

During the progress of these reconnoissances every effort was 
made to bring up supplies and ammunition. A violent storm 
beginning on the 6th, and continuing without cessation for three 
or four days, almost entirely interrupted the water-communica- 
tion between Fortress Monroe and Ship Point, and made the 
already bad roads terrible beyond description. In those days 
I more than once thought of a reply made to me by an old gen- 






BAD ROADS. 



eral of Cossacks, who had served in all the Russian campaigns 
against Napoleon. I had asked how the roads were in those 
days, to which he replied : " My son, the roads are always bad 
in war." 

It was not until the loth that we were able to establish a new 
depot on Cheeseman's creek, which shortened the haul about 
three miles. The rains continued almost incessantly, and it was 
necessary not only to detail large working parties to unload sup- 
plies, but details of some thousands of men were required to 
corduroy the roads, as the only means of enabling us to get up 
supplies. . 

As illustrating the condition of things, I insert the following 
despatch from Mr. John Tucker, Assistant Secretary of War, dat- 
ed near Yorktown, April 10, to Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary 
of War : 

" I reached Gen. McClellan's headquarters at seven this even- 
ing, having had an accident to the steamer on the way from 
Fortress Monroe to Ship Point. I was five hours on horseback 
(making about five miles), the roads being almost impassable and 
so entirely occupied with army wagons I frequently had to leave 
the road and take to the woods. The severe storm at Fortress 
Monroe prevented transports from leaving for several days. The 
facilities for landing at Ship Point are very poor, and for several 
days it must have been next to impossible to move artillery over 
such roads. I learn that twelve thousand men are engaged in 
repairing and building new roads. The difficulties of transpor- 
tation have been so great that some of the cavalry horses had 
to be sent back to keep them from starving. I will report my 
observations of army movements to-morrow, but I see an earnest 
determination to lose no time in attacking the enemy. 

"JOHN TUCKER, 
" Assistant Secretary of War." 

The following telegram was sent as indicated, on April 10, to 
Brig. -Gen. Thomas, adjutant-general : 

I examined the works on enemy's left very carefully to-day. 
They are very strong, the approaches difficult ; enemy in force 
and confident. Water-batteries at York and Gloucester said to 
be much increased ; have not seen them myself. Have not yet 
received reports of engineer officers. I go to-morrow to examine 
our left. Sharp firing on our right for some time to-day while I 
was there ; no harm done, although their shells burst handsomely. 



2/6 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Am receiving supplies from Ship Point, repairing roads, getting 
up siege artillery, etc. 

It seems now almost certain that we must use mortars and 
heavy guns freely before assaulting. The naval officers urge an 
attack in rear of Gloucester ; I think they are right, but am now 
too weak to attempt it, unless new circumstances come to my 
knowledge. The affair will be protracted in consequence of the 
diminution of my force. 

The following was sent to Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of 
War, on April 8 : 

Weather terrible; raining heavily last twenty-eight hours; 
roads and camps in awful condition ; very little firing to-day. 
Reconnoissances being continued under disadvantageous circum- 
stances. Gen. Sumner has arrived. Most of Richardson's divi- 
sion at Ship Point. I cannot move it from there in present con- 
dition of roads until I get more wagons. I need more force to 
make the attack on Gloucester. 

To Brig.-Gen. L. Thomas on April 9 : 

Weather still execrable ; country covered with water ; roads 
terrible. It is with the utmost difficulty that I can supply the 
troops. We are doing an immense deal of work on the roads. 
Cannot land siege-train until wind moderates. Reconnoissances 
being pushed and point of attack pretty well determined. Rebels 
have thrown ten-inch and twelve-inch shells yesterday and to- 
day without effect. I have now placed all the troops in bivouac 
just out of shell-range, holding all our advanced positions with 
strong detachments well sheltered. I shall not lose an unneces- 
sary hour in placing our heavy guns in battery, and will assault at 
the earliest practicable moment. The conduct of the troops is 
excellent. 

At this time I received the following letter from the Presi- 
dent : 

"WASHINGTON, April 9, 1862. 

" MY DEAR SIR : Your despatches complaining that you are 
not properly sustained, while they do not offend me, do pain me 
very much. 

" Blenker's division was withdrawn from you before you left 
here, and you know the pressure under which I did it, and, as I 
thought, acquiesced in it certainly not without reluctance. 

" After you left I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorgan- 
ized men, without a single field-battery, were all you designed 



LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT. 

to be left for the defence of Washington and Manassas Junction, 
and part of this even was to go to Gen. Hooker's old position. 
Gen. Banks's corps, once designed for Manassas Junction, was 
diverted and tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg, 
and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac 
and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. This presented, or would 
present when McDowell and Sumner should be gone, a great 
temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahannock 
and sack Washington. My implicit order that Washington should, 
by the judgment of all the commanders of army corps, be left 
entirely secure, had been neglected. It was precisely this that 
drove me to detain McDowell. 

" I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to 
leave Banks at Manassas Junction ; but when that arrangement 
was broken up, and nothing was substituted for it, of course I 
was constrained to substitute something for it myself. And allow 
me to ask, Do you really think I should permit the line from 
Richmond via Manassas Junction to this city to be entirely 
open, except what resistance could be presented by less than 
20,000 unorganized troops ? This is a question which the coun- 
try will not allow me to evade. 

" There is a curious mystery about the number of troops now 
with you. When I telegraphed you on the 6th, saying you had 
over a hundred thousand with you, I had just obtained from the 
Secretary of War a statement, taken, as he said, from your own 
returns, making 108,000 then with you and en route to you. You 
now say you will have but 85,000 when all en route to you shall 
have reached you. How can the discrepancy of 23,000 be ac- 
counted for ? 

" As to Gen. Wool's command, I understand it is doing for 
you precisely what a like number of your own would have to do 
if that command was away. 

" I suppose the whole force which has gone forward for you is 
with you by this time. And if so, I think it is the precise time 
for you to strike a blow. By delay the enemy will relatively gain 
upon you that is, he will gain faster by fortifications and rein- 
forcements than you can by reinforcements alone. And once 
more let me tell you, it is indispensable to you that you strike a 
blow. I am powerless to help this. You will do me the justice 
to remember I always insisted that going down the bay in search 
of a field, instead of fighting at or near Manassas, was only shift- 
ing, and not surmounting, a difficulty ; that we would find the 
same enemy and the same or equal entrenchments at either 
place. The country will not fail to note, is now noting, that the 
present hesitation to move upon an entrenched enemy is but the 
story of Manassas repeated. 

" I beg to assure you that I have never written you or spoken 
to you in greater kindness of feeling than now, nor with a fuller 



278 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

purpose to sustain you, so far as, in my most anxious judgment, 
I consistently can. But you must act. 

" Yours very truly, 

"A. LINCOLN." 

The portions of this letter referring to the arrangements for 
the defence of Washington and the Shenandoah have already been 
fully answered and need not be alluded to again in this place. 

As regards the discrepancy of 23,000 men, it is sufficient to 
say that my estimate was made from the actual latest returns of 
the men present for duty, and was correct. I have no doubt 
that the number furnished the President was the aggregate pre- 
sent and absent a convenient mistake not unfrequently made 
by the Secretary of War. 

The number I gave was correct ; that furnished the President 
was incorrect. 

In regard to the employment of Wool's command, the authori- 
ties in Washington failed to perceive the irony of my remark in 
my telegram of April 7, to the effect that the only use that 
could be made of his command was to protect my communica- 
tions in rear of the point I then occupied. There were no com- 
munications to protect beyond Ship Point, and there was no 
possibility of the roads to Fortress Monroe being troubled by the 
enemy. Wool's troops were of no possible use to me beyond 
holding Fortress Monroe, and would have been of very great 
use if the surplus had been incorporated with the Army of the 
Potomac. 

The whole force sent forward had not joined me at the 
date of this letter ; it was not until seven days later that Casey, 
Hooker, and Richardson reached the front line ; they could not 
be brought up earlier. I have already shown the impossibility 
of attacking earlier or otherwise than we actually did. 

When in front of Sebastopol in 1855 I asked Gen. Martim- 
prey, chief of staff of the French army in the Crimea, how he 
found that the cable worked which connected the Crimean with 
the European lines of telegraph. He said that it worked admi- 
rably from the Crimea to Paris, but very badly in the opposite 
direction ; and by way of explanation related the following anec- 
dote : He said that immediately after the failure of the assault 
of June, 1855, the emperor telegraphed Pelissier to renew the 
assault immediately. Pelissier replied that it was impossible 



IMP A TIENCE. 279 

without certain preliminary preparations which required several 
weeks. The emperor repeated the peremptory order to attack 
at once. Pelissier repeated his reply. After one or two more 
interchanges of similar messages Pelissier telegraphed : " I will 
not renew the attack until ready ; if you wish it done, come and 
do it yourself." That ended the matter. 

Referring for a moment to the President's despatch of April 
6, it is well to recall the facts that at that time, instead of 100,000 
men, I had after deducting guards and working parties much 
less than 40,000 for attack, and that the portion of the enemy's 
lines which he thought I had better break through at once was 
about the strongest of the whole, except, perhaps, the town itself. 

The impatience displayed at that time, after so greatly reduc- 
ing my force, is in remarkable contrast with the patience which 
permitted Grant to occupy months in front of the lines of Peters- 
burg, far inferior in strength to those of Yorktown. 

On the 22d of March I had prepared the following : 

CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM. 

For the operations against Yorktown, Richmond, etc., where 
we will probably find extensive earthworks heavily garrisoned, we 
shall require the means of overwhelming them by a vertical fire of 
shells. 

I should therefore be glad to have disposable at Fortress 
Monroe : 

I. i st. 20 lo-inch mortars complete. 

2d. 20 8-inch mortars complete. 
II. 20 8-inch siege-howitzers. 

III. 20 4^-inch wrought-iron siege-guns. 

IV. 40 2o-pounder Parrotts. 
V. - 24-pounder siege-guns. 

The 2o-pounder Parrotts with the batteries will, of course, be 
counted as available. 

I do not know the number of 4^-inch guns available ; if not 
so many as I have indicated, something else should be substituted. 
I wish Gen. Barry and Col. Kingsbury to consult with Gen. 
Marcy, to make such suggestions as occur to them, and ascertain 
at once to what extent this memorandum can be filled. It is 
possible we cannot count upon the navy to reduce Yorktown by 
their independent efforts ; we must therefore be prepared to do it 
by our own means. There are said to be at Yorktown from 27 
to 32 heavy guns, at Gloucester 14 Columbiads. The probable 
armament of Yorktown, when exterior guns are drawn in, will be 



280 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

from 40 to 50 heavy guns, from 24-pounders to 8-inch and per- 
haps lo-inch Columbiads." 

Before leaving Washington I detailed Col. Robert Tyler's ist 
Conn, regiment as heavy artillery, and placed the siege-train in 
their charge ; it will be seen, as the narrative proceeds, how 
admirably this splendid regiment performed their most important 
duties at all times and under the most trying circumstances. 

As soon as it became clear that no aid was to be had from the 
navy, and that we must reduce Yorktown by a front attack, I 
took steps to increase the number of heavy guns and mortars to 
the extent shown by the statement of batteries given hereafter. 
The number of officers of the corps of engineers and of the 
topographical engineers at my disposal was so small that it was 
necessary to supplement them by civilian employees kindly fur- 
nished by Prof. Bache, of the U. S. Coast Survey, and by details 
from the line. These civilian employees vied with the officers of 
the army in the courage, devotion, and intelligence with which 
they performed the dangerous and important duties devolving 
upon them. There were but twelve officers of the engineers, in- 
cluding four on duty with the three companies of engineer troops, 
and six of the topographical engineers. These officers at once 
proceeded to ascertain by close reconnoissances the nature and 
strength of the enemy's defences and the character of the ground, 
in order to determine the points of attack and the nature of the 
necessary works of attack. Meanwhile the troops were occupied 
in constructing roads to the depots. Gen. Sumner reached the 
front on the 9th of April, and was placed in command of the left 
wing, consisting of his own and the 4th corps. He was in front 
of the line of the Warwick, while the 3d corps was charged with 
the operations against Yorktown itself. The following despatch 
to Secretary Stanton shows the condition of affairs at its date, 
April 1 1 : 

The reconnoissances of to-day prove that it is necessary to 
invest and attack Gloucester Point. Give me Franklin's and 
McCall's divisions under command of Franklin, and I will at 
once undertake it. If circumstances of which I am not aware 
make it impossible for you to send me two divisions to carry out 
the final plan of campaign, I will run the risk and hold myself 
responsible for the results if you will give me Franklin's division. 



LETTER OF F. P. BLAIR. 28 1 

If you still confide in my judgment I entreat that you will grant 
this request. The fate of our cause depends upon it. Although 
willing, under the pressure of necessity, to carry this through 
with Franklin alone, I wish it to be distinctly understood that 
I think two divisions necessary. Franklin and his division are 
indispensable to me. Gen. Barnard concurs in this view. I have 
determined upon the point of attack, and am at this moment 
engaged in fixing the position of the batteries. 

The same day the following reached me : 

" By direction of the President, Franklin's division has been 
ordered to march back te Alexandria and immediately embark 
for Fortress Monroe. 

" L. THOMAS, 

"Adj.-Gen." 

I replied to the secretary : " I am delighted with Franklin's 
orders, and beg to thank you." 

I insert the following letter from my venerable friend, Francis 
P. Blair, as an indication of the state of feeling at the time : 

"WASHINGTON, April 12, 1862. 
" Maj.-Gen. G. B. McClellan: 

" MY DEAR SIR : There is a prodigious cry of ' On to Rich- 
mond ! ' among the carpet-knights of our city, who will not shed 
their blood to get there. I am one of those who wish to see you 
lead a triumph in the capital of the Old Dominion, but am not so 
eager as to hazard it by hurrying on too fast. The veterans of 
Waterloo filled the trenches of Gen. Jackson at New Orleans 
with their bodies and their blood. If you can accomplish your 
object of reaching Richmond by a slower process than storming 
redoubts and batteries in earthworks, the country will applaud

My retained copy of the following letter is not dated, but it 
must have been written somewhere about the 2oth of April : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

BEFORE YORKTOWN. 
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War : 

SIR: I received to-day a note from Assistant Secretary Watson 



282 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

enclosing an extract from a letter the author of which is not 
mentioned. I send a copy of the extract with this. I hope 
that a copy has also been sent to Gen. McDowell, whom it 
concerns more nearly, perhaps, than it does me. 

At the risk of being thought obtrusive I will venture upon 
some remarks which perhaps my position does not justify me in, 
making, but which I beg to assure you are induced solely by my 
intense desire for the success of the government in this struggle. 

You will, I hope, pardon me if I allude to the past, not in a 
captious spirit, but merely so far as may be necessary to explain 
my own course and my views as to the future. 

From the beginning I had intended, so far as I might have 
the power to carry out my own views, to abandon the line of 
Manassas as the line of advance. I ever regarded it as an 
improper one ; my wish was to adopt a new line, based upon 
the waters of the lower Chesapeake. I always expected to meet 
with strong opposition on this line, the strongest that the rebels 
could offer, but I was well aware that upon overcoming this 
opposition the result would be decisive and pregnant with great 
results. 

Circumstances, among which I will now only mention the 
uncertainty as to the power of the Merrimac, have compelled 
me to adopt the present line, as probably safer, though far less 
brilliant, than that by Urbana. When the movement was com- 
menced I counted upon an active and disposable force of nearly 
150,000 men, and intended to throw a strong column upon West 
Point either by York river or, if that proved impracticable, by a 
march from the mouth of the Severn, expecting to turn in that 
manner all the defences of the Peninsula. Circumstances have 
proved that I was right, and that my intended movements would 
have produced the desired results. 

After the transfer of troops had commenced from Alexandria 
to Fort Monroe, but before I started in person, the division of 
Blenker was detached from my command a loss of near 10,000 
men. As soon as the mass of my troops were fairly started I 
embarked myself. Upon reaching Fort Monroe I learned that 
the rebels were being rapidly reinforced from Norfolk and Rich- 
mond. I therefore determined to lose no time in making the 
effort to invest Yorktown, without waiting for the arrival of the 
divisions of Hooker and Richardson and the ist corps, intend- 
ing to employ the ist corps in mass to move upon West Point, 
reinforcing it as circumstances might render necessary. 

The advance was made on the morning of the second day 
after I reached Fort Monroe. When the troops reached the 
immediate vicinity of Yorktown the true nature of the enemy's 
position was for the first time developed. While my men were 
under fire I learned that the ist corps was removed from my 
command. No warning had been given me of this, nor was any 



LETTER TO SECRETARY STAN TON. 283 

reason then assigned. I should also have mentioned that the 
evening before I left Fort Monroe I received a telegraphic 
despatch from the War Department informing me that the 
order placing Fort Monroe and its dependent troops under 
my command was rescinded. No reason was given for this, 
nor has it been to this day. I confess that I have no right to 
know the reason. This order deprived me of the support of 
another division which I had been authorized to form for active 
operations from among the troops near Fort Monroe. 

Thus when I came under fire I found myself weaker by five 
divisions than I had expected when the movement commenced. 
It is more than probable that no general was ever placed in such 
a position before. 

Finding myself thus unexpectedly weakened, and with a 
powerful enemy strongly entrenched in my front, I was com- 
pelled to change my plans and become cautious. Could I have 
retained my original force I confidently believe that I would now 
have been in front of Richmond instead of where I now am. 
The probability is that that city would now have been in our 
possession. 

But the question now is in regard to the present and the 
future rather than the past. 

The enemy, by the destruction of the bridges of the Rappa- 
hannock, has deprived himself of the means of a rapid advance 
on Washington. Lee will never venture upon a bold movement 
on a large scale. 

The troops I left for the defence of Washington, as I fully 
explained to you in the letter I wrote the day I sailed, are ample 
for its protection. 

Our true policy is to concentrate our troops on the fewest 
possible lines of attack ; we have now too many, and an enter- 
prising enemy could strike us a severe blow. 

I have every reason to believe that the main portion of the 
rebel forces are in my front. They are not " drawing off " their 
troops from Yorktown. 

Give me McCall's division and I will undertake a movement 
on West Point which will shake them out of Yorktown. As it is, 
I will win, but I must not be blamed if success is delayed. I do 
not feel that I am answerable for the delay of victory. 

I do not feel authorized to venture upon any suggestions as 
to the disposition of the troops in other departments, but content 
myself with stating the least that I regard as essential to prompt 
success here. If circumstances render it impossible to give what 
I ask, I still feel sure of success, but more time will be required 
to achieve the result. 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

CEO. B. McCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 



284 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

The affair known as the one-gun battery is explained by the 
following instructions and statement : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

CAMP WINFIELD SCOTT, April 15, 1862. 
Brig. -Gen. IV. F. Smith, Commanding Division : 

SIR : You will please advance to-morrow morning to stop the 
work now being carried on by the enemy near and in rear of the 
"one-gun battery." This can probably be most readily accom- 
plished by throwing sharpshooters well forward to the edge of 
the stream, leaving in front of the work a clear interval through 
which four to six guns can shell the working parties and adja- 
cent woods. Your flank towards Lee's Mill should be carefully 
watched, also towards Wynn's Mill, communicating with Gen. 
Gorman, who will have orders to prevent an attack upon your 
right flank from Wynn's Mill. It is probable that by placing 
your guns near the burned chimneys, as well under cover as 
possible, they will accomplish the result. 

If the enemy are driven entirely away, advance cautiously a 
few skirmishers across the dam to penetrate the woods and ascer- 
tain whether there is any clearing near at hand where you can 
hold your own. In this event cross over and send for immediate 
assistance, which will be promptly afforded. If you find the 
position across the stream dangerous and untenable, cut the 
dam. 

In any event exercise the utmost caution before crossing the 
stream. The great object is to stop the work, and merely to 
take advantage after that of any opportunity that may offer itself 
to push the advantage. I should prefer stopping the work and 
attacking when our preparations elsewhere are more advanced. 
I would prefer making the attack at the one-gun battery a part 
of a more general plan involving the use of batteries against 
Lee's Mill and other contiguous points. From the statement of 
Capt. Hope (had since I wrote the foregoing) I imagine a posi- 
tion can be found on the road at a distance of some twelve 
hundred yards, whence their works can be shelled with i ex- 
pound Parrotts and probably spherical case from the Napo- 
leon guns. I would be glad to learn that the work is stopped 
and the enemy taught a lesson. 

Please inform Gen. Gorman of your instructions, and inform 
me as early as possible of your arrangements. 
Very truly yours, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

P.S. I send this direct to you for the reason that it is too late 
to communicate it through the commander of the 4th army corps 



THE ONE-GUN BA TTER Y. 285 

and give time to execute the movement at a sufficiently early 
hour. 

Upon reflection I think it will, under present circumstances, 
be wiser to confine the operation to forcing the enemy to discon- 
tinue work. 

In compliance with these instructions Gen. Smith placed two 
brigades and three batteries on his left to guard against any 
attack from Lee's Mill, and commenced operations with his 
remaining brigade and battery. He posted Mott's battery op- 
posite the dam at a distance of about eleven hundred yards 
from the works, sent in one regiment through the woods on the 
right with instructions to open fire on any working parties they 
might observe, another regiment on the left with similar orders, 
and held the remaining three regiments in reserve. As soon as 
our infantry opened fire the enemy replied with shell, upon which 
Mott opened and kept up a sharp fire for about an hour until 
he silenced the enemy. 

About three o'clock Gen. Smith had placed eighteen guns in 
position about five hundred yards from the works, supported 
on either flank by Brooks's Vermont brigade, Hancock's being 
brought up in support. Our guns then opened, the enemy 
replying for some time with rapidity ; when their fire slack- 
ened Smith ordered four companies of the 3d Vermont to cross 
the dam and feel the enemy. On arriving at the crest of the 
work they were met by the enemy in force, who had lain se- 
creted, and were forced to retire with a loss of about 20 killed 
and wounded, after having held the work for some minutes. 

. Later in the day, after I had left the ground, another recon- 
noissance was made, under cover of the artillery-fire, by the 4th 
Vermont on the right, the 5th and 6th on the left, but it was 
found impracticable to push further than to the dam, which 
ground was held. During the night strong entrenchments were 
thrown up, on the right for four guns within three hundred yards 
of the work, on the left one with eight embrasures, and in the 
centre one with four embrasures, the last two within five hun- 
dred yards' range. This reconnoissance was conducted with skill 
and great gallantry, the Vermont troops thus early giving earnest 
of the high qualities they so often displayed during all the 
war. 

The losses in killed, wounded, and missing amounted to about 



286 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

150. The objects of the operation were completely achieved : 
we prevented further work at this point, prevented the enemy 
from using the crossing, and ascertained that the line could not 
be broken there without further preparation in the way of artil- 
lery, etc. 

The general plan of operations determined upon was to 
establish batteries of heavy guns and mortars bearing upon 
Yorktown and Gloucester, their water-batteries, a line of works 
between Yorktown and the Warwick river, Wynn's Mill, and 
the " one-gun battery " about a mile lower down the War- 
wick. 

The general order regulating the details of the siege opera- 
tions, as well as the instructions issued by Gen. Fitz-John Porter, 
who, on the 26th of April, was assigned to duty as director of the 
siege, are for the present omitted. I issued all orders relating 
to the siege through him, making him commandant of the siege 
operations, and at the same time chief of staff for that especial 
work. Under the circumstances of the case some such arrange- 
ment was necessary to relieve me of too much personal labor, and 
it worked admirably. 

Ground was broken on the night of the iyth of April upon 
batteries i, 2, and 3, it being only at that date that the neces- 
sary roads and bridges were completed and the requisite mate- 
rial collected. The first parallel was commenced on the morn- 
ing of the 25th. 

The work was pushed with so much energy that by the night 
of May 3 all the batteries were completed and nearly all armed ; 
the armament would have been completed on the night of the 
5th, and fire opened the next morning. 

In all sixteen batteries were constructed, their full armament 
being two 2oo-pounder rifled guns, twelve loo-pounder rifled, 
ten i3-inch mortars, twenty-five lo-inch mortars, seven 8-inch 
mortars, twelve 4j-inch rifled siege-guns, twelve 30-pounder 
rifled guns, thirty-two 2o-pounder rifled guns, and two 8-inch 
siege-howitzers, being 114 heavy guns and mortars in all. 

In order to conceal our purposes and complete the work with 
the least possible exposure, none of the batteries were opened, 
except No. i, which on the 30th of April opened with excellent 
effect upon the wharves of Yorktown and Gloucester, in order 
to prevent the landing of supplies and men. 



PLAN OF ASSAULT. 287 

It was intended to open with all the 114 guns and mortars at 
once, in order to create the greatest possible moral and physical 
effect. 

Towards the close of the siege it was apparent that the works 
at Gloucester could not be carried by assault from the rear with- 
out some preliminary work in the way of reducing the fire of 
their batteries on the land side a matter requiring a good deal 
of time, and force greater than a single division. 

With the force at my disposal it was impossible to reinforce 
Franklin for that purpose, and I determined, late on the 2d of 
May, to disembark that division and move it to the front, in order 
to employ all my force in the assault about to be given, and thus 
render the result as sure as human foresight could make it. On 
the 3d, then, Franklin's division was disembarked, and was to 
have moved to the front on the 4th. 

As soon as the fire of the water-batteries was silenced the 
gunboats, reinforced by the Galena under the gallant John Rodg- 
ers, were to run by and take up a position in rear, whence they 
could get a nearer fire on the defences and control the road 
leading from Yorktown to Williamsburg. 

When this was effected, the artillery of the land defences 
silenced, and the garrison demoralized by the shell-fire, the 
columns of assault were to advance from the nearest cover. 

The principal assault was to have been upon the line between 
the Warwick and Yorktown, a column being ready to assault the 
latter if the effect of the batteries justified it. The enfilading and 
two counter batteries were prepared against Wynn's Mill, which, 
with the dam next above it, would also have been assaulted at 
the same time with the main attack. 

The counter batteries against Wynn's Mill enfiladed the 
lines stretching thence towards the " one-gun " battery, against 
which latter a mortar battery was also prepared ; under cover of 
these and the fire of the field-batteries an assault was also to be 
made on the " one-gun " battery. Under cover of the field-guns 
of the 4th corps a feint was to be made upon Lee's Mill, to be 
converted into a real attack if the effect of the operations at other 
points opened the way thereto. 

The fire of our batteries would probably have enabled us 
to assault about noon. As the enemy were practically with- 
out bomb-proof shelters, the fire of our forty-two mortars, ten 



288 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

of which were 1 3-inch and twenty-five lo-inch, should in five 
or six hours have blown up their magazines and rendered the 
works untenable for the garrisons. As many of their guns, all in 
the water-batteries, were en barbette, the fire of our seventy-two 
heavy guns should in the same space of time have dismounted 
most of their guns ; and as the mortars could well continue their 
fire until the assaulting columns had reached the immediate 
vicinity of the works, the success of the assault, with very little 
loss, was reasonably certain. 

In order to diminish the risk to the gunboats as much as 
possible, I proposed to Flag-Officer Goldsborough and to Capt. 
Smith, commanding the gunboats, that the gunboats and the 
Galena should run the batteries the night after we opened fire. 
If the effect of our fire had equalled our expectations so as to 
justify an assault during the first day's firing, I am very sure that 
Capt. Smith would have run by the batteries in broad daylight, 
without awaiting the cover of darkness. I have no doubt what- 
ever that at the latest the dawn of the second day would have 
seen the gunboats in the rear of the defences, and the assault 
delivered with entire success and without any heavy loss on our 
side. 

Gen. Johnston told me in Washington, during the winter of 
1882 and 1883, that one of his strong objections to holding York- 
town was his apprehension that the gunboats would force the bat- 
teries at night and thus render the position untenable. Other 
Confederate general officers serving there have told me that in 
their opinion, at the time, the gunboats could easily have effected 
this on any dark night. 

Early in the morning of the 4th of May it was found that 
the enemy had during the night evacuated all his positions, very 
wisely preferring to avoid the experiment of withstanding a bom- 
bardment and assault. We captured in the works, including 
Gloucester, seventy-seven guns and mortars, supplied with the 
ordinary complements, and seventy-six rounds of ammunition to 
each. 

The captured pieces were as follows : one lo-inch Columbiad, 
thirteen 9-inch Dahlgren guns, sixteen 8-inch Columbiads, two 
y-inch heavy guns, one 6^-inch rifle, one 4^-inch rifle, one 
2 T 8 y-inch rifle, two rifled 32-pounders, one 8-inch siege-howitzer, 
three 64-pounders, eight 42-pounders, seventeen 32-pounders, four 






STRENGTH OF YORKTOWN. 289 

24-pounders, one 42-pound carronade, two 8-inch mortars, two 
i2-pounders, one 6-pounder. 

They had evidently removed such guns as they could, prob- 
ably light guns. 

I have been much criticised for not assaulting Yorktown im- 
mediately. Perhaps the point has been made clear enough, but 
at the risk of repetition I will say something more on the subject. 

Before starting from Fortress Monroe the best information in 
our possession clearly indicated that the Warwick river ran nearly 
parallel with the James, instead of heading at Yorktown, and it 
seemed certain that the road from Newport News to Williams- 
burg did not cross that stream, at least any important branch of 
it, and that it presented no obstacle to an advance. Upon these 
data were predicated the orders of April 4 (for the march of the 
next day, the 5th), according to which Heintzelman was to move 
into position close to Yorktown, while Keyes was to take up a 
position in rear of Yorktown at the Halfway House ; Keyes was 
also ordered to attack and carry whatever he found in front of 
him. Now, let it be observed that at all points (on the right, 
centre, and left) we found the enemy's works fully garrisoned and 
provided with artillery, and that Keyes and his general officers 
reported that they found the position in their front so strong and 
so well provided with troops and artillery that it was impossible 
to assault with any hope of success. The same state of things 
was clearly the case in front of the right column, where I was. 
Now, it is very certain that the only thing to be done was to 
make close reconnoissances of the enemy's position, in order to 
discover a vulnerable point. This course was followed, and the 
unanimous opinion of all was that certain preliminary siege ope- 
rations were necessary. I assert without fear of contradiction 
that no one at that time thought an assault possible ; moreover, 
that when we saw the works abandoned by the enemy it re- 
mained the conviction of all that, with the raw troops we had, 
an assault would have resulted in simply an useless butchery 
with no hope of success. The statements made long afterwards 
by such men as Barnard were simply ex-post-facto opinions, got- 
ten up for political purposes, and never could have been really 
entertained by them. The only fault to be found with the ope- 
rations at Yorktown is in regard to the slowness with which 
some of the engineer officers operated. I was often obliged to 



2 go McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

make just such reconnoissances as I did at Vera Cruz (when a 
brevet second lieutenant of engineers) to expedite matters. Had 
Duane been chief-engineer, operations would have progressed 
much more rapidly. The co-operation of the navy amounted to 
little or nothing. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

Despatches and letters relating to subjects treated in the foregoing and 
following chapters. 

" APRIL 6, Sunday, 4 P.M. 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : I have received your favor of this 
date by Col. Key, and hasten to say that I have already written 
you via Shipping Point in reply, giving my reason for not hav- 
ing joined you. The time you proposed to proceed with me had 
elapsed, and particularly the difficulties of my leaving my vessel 
owing to the want of officers of experience to take care of her. 

" I have explained in my note of to-day, and have repeated to 
Col. Key, the greatly increased strength of the fortifications as 
seen from this position. The forts at Gloucester are very formid- 
able indeed, and the water-batteries of Yorktown have evidently 
been increased in dimensions within a few days, as indicated by 
the new earth. 

" As I pointed out to you in our interview, the works to be 
most apprehended (though they all are too formidable for our 
vessels, or three or four times their numbers and class) are the 
guns in mask about one-quarter to one-half of a mile this side 
of Yorktown, which position I point out to Col. Key. 

" The enemy are still on Gloucester Point how strong I can- 
not say. So long as he holds that formidable work (or, indeed, 
upper and lower work) we surely cannot command the York 
river. All the gunboats of the navy would fail to take it, but 
would be destroyed in the attempt. Yet I will not hesitate to 
try the experiment, if required to do so, with this force, however 
inadequate. 

" I have explained to Col. Key that if you turn the masked 
work, which I fired on to-day and received its fire in return, the 
guns would command the next water-battery, which is about one- 
fifth of a mile from it towards Yorktown, as it appears from this 
ship. 

" With those two batteries carried, this force might approach 
near enough to shell Yorktown at long range, but nothing more. 
These vessels of this class are not calculated for closer or heavier 
work. 

" As I could not go in time to reach you to-day, as requested, 
I sent, after despatching my letter to you, the second in rank, 
Lieut.-Com. Clitz, to confer with you. And now, with Col. Key,

"Wachusett, April 10, 1862. 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : Enclosed is the report upon the 
landing from this part of the river at ' Sand-Box/ where it was 
intended to land troops. Capt. Nicholson says he found a good 
picket-guard house for cavalry, stables, etc., within the Box, 
and some cattle near Too's Point. A steamer also penetrated 
a mile up Back creek to-day which is within the Sand-Box, and 
whose entrance is to the eastward of Too's Point, as shown by 
the chart, and over which is good eight feet to within one and 
a half miles of Wormsley's creek. 

" It has been observed to-day that large numbers of infantry 
have been transported from Yorktown to Gloucester Point. And 
this afternoon a number of what seemed to be laborers with 
entrenching tools went to the same point ; we conclude either 
to strengthen the works there or to throw up works opposite to 
and within long rifle-range of this anchorage. I have been 
expecting some such movement, and wondering why they did 
not try it from some point back from the beach so far that 
our guns (shell) could not reach them. It cannot be prevented 
by us.

NEAR YORKTOWN, April 8, 1862. 

MY DEAR FLAG-OFFICER : Your kind letter received. From 
the information received thus far I am inclined to think that the 
" masked battery " on the river-bank below Yorktown is not in 
existence, but that the gun fired upon Missroom was upon the 
advanced bastion of the place itself. Porter thinks that he has 
found a place from which we can enfilade their water-batteries. 



LETTERS AND DESPATCHES. 293 

I go there in a few minutes to look at it. Should it prove to be 
so, we can enable the gunboats to take an effective part in the 
contest. The weather is infamous (has been raining hard for the 
last eighteen hours, and still continues), the roads are horrid, and 
we have the devil's own time about supplies. 

I have made strong representations as to the withdrawal of 
the ist corps, which has forced me to abandon the turning move- 
ment, and hope that the President may be induced to change his 
order. . . . The position of the enemy is immensely strong, but 
we are learning more of it every hour. Our men behave splen- 
didly brave and patient as men can be. ...

"YORK RIVER, April 17, 1862. 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : In accordance with your request to 
have shell thrown into Yorktown yesterday, the Sebago (side- 
wheel) was ordered on that service, she being the only vessel here 
provided with a long-range rifle. 

" Her fire was returned by two guns of equal range from 
the enemy with surprising accuracy. One shell passed directly 
between the ' smoke-stack ' and mainmast, a few feet above her 
deck, and another within a few feet of the wheel-house, throwing 
the water over the vessel, and both within a short distance of her 
boilers and machinery, which are altogether exposed. Had she 
been crippled the attempt to withdraw her might, and probably 
would, have caused the sacrifice of other vessels also. 

" The Sebago is the vessel capable of rendering the most 
important service in covering the landing of troops, and I submit 
whether it would not be advisable to defer any attempt to throw 
shell in Yorktown till night, while she can operate on Gloucester 
with impunity at any time. She draws six feet of water. A sin- 
gle shot in the midship section of that vessel especially, or indeed 
of either of these gunboats, disables if it do not destroy her. 

" Would it not be possible for your cannon to dismount those 
two rifles with which the enemy fired at the Sebago yesterday ? 



294 McCLELLAN* S OWN STORY. 

They will inflict much damage on our people when Gloucester is 
held by them, as well as on our vessels. 

"The Sebago threw shells into Gloucester last night three 
several times. I am advised that another light-draught steamer, 
similar to the Sebago, is to come here. We cannot have the 
accuracy of fire from a vessel that the enemy exhibited yester-' 
day.

I asked for the Parrott guns from Washington for the reason 
that some expected had been two weeks, nearly, on the way and 
could not be heard from. They arrived last night. My arrange-

saved by getting others from Washington. My object was to 
hasten, not procrastinate. All is being done that human labor 
can accomplish.

I regret to learn that Col. Campbell, 5th Penn. Cavalry, has 
been placed in arrest by Maj.-Gen. McDowell for endeavoring to 
comply with my positive order to him to report with his regiment 
for duty at this place. This regiment was never assigned to Gen.

McDowell's army corps, but was detailed by me to Gen. Keyes's 
corps. I, of course, expected it to follow me as soon as transpor- 
tation could be provided, and am not a little surprised to learn 
that my instructions have been interfered with and my force 
diminished by the action of the commanding officer of the De- 
partment of the Rappahannock, in violation of G. O. No. 29;

der these circumstances I beg the immediate interposition of 
the War Department to relieve from arrest a meritorious officer, 
against whom there appears to be no complaint save that of 
obedience to the orders of his rightful superior. I also ask that 
the regiment, as well as the ist N. J., Col. Wyndham, may be

" MY DEAR GENERAL : The carriage on board the Sebago is 
weak. Two carriage-makers are coming to us from Washington ; 
I fear not in time. I am promised, if she comes in time, a 
steamer with zoo-pounder rifle. 

" The Corwin has no battery but a 2o-pounder and two sixes, 
being only a surveying-craft. 

" When you commence attack the loo-pounder rifle can assist 
from the beginning. But I fear our stock of ammunition, espe- 
cially shell and ' thirty ' fuses, will fail us soon. 

" I have failed to get what I have asked for from Hampton 
Roads. Can you loan us some loo-pounder shell and some more 
' thirty ' fuses for the Sebago ? She has only about thirty-six 
fuses of that kind now. Our stock at Hampton Roads was sent 
to North Carolina. 

" Please see the despatch I have just sent to Com. Poor. I 
sent a steamer to land your mortars at two A.M., with tackle.

CAMP WINFIELD SCOTT, May 4, 1862. 
Brig. -Gen. Heintzelman, Commanding $d Corps : 

I have received information from Gen. Smith that the enemy 
are still in front of him in some force of infantry and cavalry. 
Gen. Stoneman has been ordered to move as rapidly as possible 
to the Halfway House, and to take possession of the cross-road 
near that place, to cut off this command, and also to send a 
strong reconnoissance towards Blen's wharf. 

I wish Hooker to follow this movement with the utmost 
rapidity. When he reaches the point where the road branches 
off near the Halfway House, to leave a portion of his force 
there, and with the rest to gain the Lee's Mill and Williamsburg 
road, so as to support Stoneman and aid him in cutting off the 
retreat of the enemy. The division should move simply with its 
ambulances and some reserve ammunition, with not more than 
two days' rations. Should further information from Smith ren- 
der it necessary to move Kearny's division also, I would be glad 
to have you take control of the entire movement. Smith is in 
possession of their works, and the enemy referred to are some 
distance in rear of them how far I do not yet know.

had a few men injured by the bursting of shells left by the

"6 P.M., Sunday, May 4, 1862. 
" Gen. R. B. Marcy : 

" I have just arrived here, and find Gens. Sumner and Smith 
here. We will soon have three divisions, and are preparing to 
attack the rebels, who are entrenched in our front with two 
pieces of artillery, a regiment or so of cavalry, four or five regi- 
ments of infantry. Our cavalry have been repulsed with a loss 
of near 40 men and horses killed and wounded. We will soon 
carry the works. The infantry are only halting a moment to 
take a bite and rest.

The following is a fragment of a letter of instructions sent to 
Gen. Sumner on the morning of the 4th, when he went to assume 
command on the left ; and the condition of affairs then was that 
the enemy's infantry and cavalry were reported by Smith to be 
about one and one-half miles in his front in force. I had 
ordered Stoneman, supported by Hooker, to gain the Half- 
way House by a rapid march, and thus cut off the retreat 
of this force in front of Smith. Sumner was ordered to repair 
the bridges over the Warwick, etc., as quickly as possible, and 
then to 



3OO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

"Cross the stream with the 5th Cavalry, Smith's and Couch's 
divisions, and Casey's if necessary. It is possible that Sedgwick's 
and Richardson's divisions may be needed to reinforce the right. 
Please hold them subject to the general's orders for that purpose. 
Should you be informed that they are not needed here you will 
be at liberty to substitute one of them for Couch's or Casey's- 
division. It is hoped to get Stoneman's command in rear of the 
enemy before you attack. Watch the enemy closely with your 
cavalry, and should he retreat attack him without further instruc- 
tions. The gunboats have gone up the York river, and Frank- 
lin's, and perhaps one other division, will follow up to-day. As 
soon as the bridges are finished you can cross your command 
and bring them into position, but do not attack unless the enemy 
retreat or you receive orders from me. 

"A. V. COLBURN, 

"A. A. G." 

It is unnecessary to say that the object of forbidding an 
attack unless the enemy retreated was to enable Stoneman to get 
in their rear and thus cut off the entire command. 

After the orders to Stoneman, Sumner, and Heintzelman had 
been issued and were being carried out I received the following : 

"HEADQUARTERS, SMITH'S DIVISION, May 4. 
" Gen. McCkllan : 

" Gen. Hancock is in front, and, from what I have learned, 
presume it is nothing but the rear-guard. I will obey his orders 
as far as engaging them is concerned. The enemy is one and a 
half miles in front, and it is probably nothing but cavalry cover- 
ing the retreat. 

" W. F. SMITH, 

" Brig.-Gen." 

" HEADQUARTERS, SMITH'S DIVISION, 

" May 5, 10.30 P.M. 
" Gen. McClellan : 

" There is a direct road from here to Williamsburg behind the 
big fort. If you send a good man to command, and these men 
don't leave to-night, we can capture them all in the morning and 
be at Williamsburg by eight o'clock. If they don't leave to-night 
they will give us a big fight in the morning, and we shall whip 
them. 

" Don't risk yourself any more, or your commanders, and 
don't send Richardson to command this column. As far as I 
can see it is open country for cavalry, but the rain has made the 
ground soft. I have more troops or shall have with Brooks

than I need to defend myself, but it is my earnest opinion that 
your advance up the James should be this way. 

"W. F. SMITH." 

On the back of a pencil-sketch of the ground is the following: 

" Two companies garrison each fort. Fort Magruder is the 
far one from here one and a quarter miles ; second fort occu- 
pied ; third fort, near York, is yet unfinished. They seem to be 
quiet now. Please order Brooks and Ayres to me in the morn- 
ing at daylight. I have plenty of troops, but wish our own. 

"W. F. S." 

" MOUNT ZION CHURCH, 

"Mays, 3 P.M. 
" Gen. McClellan : 

" Owing to delays in the troops coming forward, I have come 
down here to hasten their march, by direction of Gen. Sumner. 
Within the last thirty minutes he has sent me two messengers to 
say that the enemy was gaining ground on him. I fear nothing 
except a panic amongst our troops, for I am certain we are vastly 
superior in strength to the enemy. I went myself with a brigade 
of my corps, which took possession of two works on the left of 
the enemy. I convinced myself that the enemy commenced his 
audacious attack upon us to cover a retreat, but, finding that he 
forces us back, he may convert his feint into something more 
serious than was at first intended. It may be advisable, if you 
have troops to spare, to set some of them in motion for this 
point ; but, above all, come yourself. 

" The rear of Gen. Kearny has just passed this point on his 
way to reinforce Gen. Hooker, and the head of his column has 
probably reached the scene of action ; and the firing has ceased 
for the last ten minutes. 

" I write this note because the badness of the road, prevent- 
ing the rapid concentration of troops, makes me anxious to take 
precaution against the possibility of reverses. As the roads must 
soon become absolutely impassable for supplies, our troops must 
starve unless you can send provisions by boats to skirt the shore, 
and to be put ashore in small boats. Our position is accessible 
to York river. The men can live on bread and bacon. 
" In haste, your obedient servant, 

"E. D. KEYES,

"P.S. An officer from Gen. Hooker's division reports this 
moment that three of his batteries have been taken by the pieces

" MY DEAR GENERAL : I did the best I could after getting your

dale's) to occupy the front of York. The roads were horrible 
and blocked up by wagons, so that they were impassable. The 
brigade reached York. I sent some of Hunt's batteries ; they 
got there and halted. The remainder I kept ready to march 
at two o'clock, or as soon as light enough. All are rested and 
fresh. Sykes's and my other brigades are in camp, also Blake. 
Franklin, I think, got off. I hope you have got order out of 
chaos. Capt. Norton says Ingalls told him he had received an 
order from the secretary to fit out a sea expedition, which would 
derange his plans considerably. A telegram can always reach me 
from York. We are ready to move quickly. I have directed 
Martindale to camp at York.

rapidly as possible and join Franklin. The artillery of the divi- 
sions Franklin, Sedgwick, and Porter will proceed by water with 
the least possible delay to join their divisions, also Franklin's

teries will move to Brick House landing by water. I will give 
orders in regard to the rest of Hunt's batteries, the regular infan-

Please send me last news from Franklin, and, if necessary, 
send a fast special boat to learn state of affairs, and communi- 
cate on return with signal party at Queen's creek, as well as via 
Yorktown by telegraph. The orders for Sumner and Richard-

without special orders from me : this is imperative. 

How soon can the artillery of Franklin, Sedgwick, and Por-

will transports be ready for the regular infantry and Richard- 
son ? How soon can water-transportation be furnished for 
Duane and his train ? For Woodbury and his trains ? How 
soon for Gregg and Rush ? How many wagons has Van Vliet 
in reserve for general purposes ? If you send steamer to Frank-

here a couple of hours ago, and will try to communicate with 
him via Hockaday's Spring this evening. I start Smith's divi-

they belong to a Texan regiment, are very intelligent, but lie,

another creek, leaving a small opening through which the road

about seven o'clock, our pickets were driven in on our left flank, 
and that after skirmishing for about two hours the action became 
quite sharp at the right extremity of that flank. Our reserves 
were driven in several times, but returned to their position each 
time with ardor. Finally we held the position which we had 
taken in the morning, and at several points of the line advanced 
our position. 

" Wherever we advanced the enemy was found in rifle-pits. 
The day has been a success, and but for the extreme want of 
forage and provisions, owing to the deficiency of transportation 
and the difficulty of landing, we might have followed it up. As 
it is, I congratulate myself that we have maintained our position. 
Gen. Newton's command was most severely engaged, and his 
conduct and that of Gen. Slocum, who had charge respectively 
of the left and right wings, was admirable. All of the officers 
and men behaved admirably, and with transportation and forage 
we could move on to-morrow. 

" I respectfully request that instructions may be given to send 
up forage and transportation immediately, as we are entirely tied

stood the attack of greatly superior numbers, with very heavy 
loss. Kearny's arrived in time to restore the fortunes of the day, 
and came most gallantly into action. I shall probably have occa- 
sion to call attention to other commands, and do not wish to do 
injustice to them by mentioning them now. If I had had the full 
information I now have in regard to the troops above-named

[April i to May 5, 1862.] 

Steamer "Commodore" April i, 1862, Potomac River, 4.15 
P.M. As soon as possible after reaching Alexandria I got the 
Commodore under way and " put off." I did not feel safe until 
I could fairly see Alexandria behind us. I have brought a tug 
with us to take back despatches from Budd's Ferry, where I 
shall stop a few hours for the purpose of winding up everything. 
I found that if I remained at Alexandria I would be annoyed 
very much, and perhaps be sent for from Washington. . . . 
Officially speaking, I feel very glad to get away from that sink 
of iniquity. . . . 

8 P.M. I have just returned from- a trip in one of the naval 
vessels with Capt. Seymour to take a look at the rebel batteries 
(recently abandoned) at Shipping Point, etc. They were pretty 
formidable, and it would have given us no little trouble to take 
possession of them had they held firm. It makes only the more 
evident the propriety of my movements, by which Manassas was 
forced to be evacuated and these batteries with it. The trip 
was quite interesting. . . . 

Steamer " Commodore" April 3, Hampton Roads, 1.30 P.M. 
... I have been up to my eyes in business since my arrival. 
We reached here about four yesterday P.M.; ran into the wharf 
and unloaded the horses, then went out and anchored. Marcy 
and I at once took a tug and ran out to the flag-ship Minne- 
sota to see Goldsborough, where we remained until about nine, 
taking tea with him. 

On our return we found Gen. Heintzelman, soon followed 
by Porter and Smith, all of whom remained here all night. I 
sat up very late arranging movements, and had my hands full. 
I have been hard at work all the morning, and not yet on shore. 
Dine with Gen. Wool to-day at four, and go thence to our camp.

We move to-morrow A.M. Three divisions take the direct road 
to Yorktown, and will encamp at Howard's Bridge. Two take 
the James River road and go to Young's Mill. The reserve 
goes to Big Bethel, where my headquarters will be to-morrow 
night. 

My great trouble is in the want of wagons a terrible draw- 
back ; but I cannot wait for them. I hope to get possession, 
before to-morrow night, of a new landing-place some seven 
or eight miles from Yorktown, which will help us very much. 
It is probable that we shall have some fighting to-morrow ; not 
serious, but we may have the opportunity of drubbing Magruder. 
The harbor here is very crowded ; facilities for landing are bad. 
I hope to get possession of Yorktown day after to-morrow. 
Shall then arrange to make the York river my line of supplies. 
The great battle will be (I think) near Richmond, as I have 
always hoped and thought. I see my way very clearly, and, 
with my trains once ready, will move rapidly. , . .

guard five miles from Yorktown. Some slight skirmishing to- 
day. Our people driving rebels. Hope to invest Yorktown 
to-morrow. All well and in good spirits. 

Big Bethel, April 5, 2 A.M. ... Have just got through with 
the orders for to-morrow ; have been working very hard, and 
have sent off officers and orderlies in every direction. I feel sure 
of to-morrow. I have, I think, provided against every contin- 
gency, and shall have the men well in hand if we fight to-morrow. 
... I saw yesterday a wonderfully cool performance. Three 
of our men had gone close down to the enemy's position after 
a sheep, which they killed, skinned, and started off with. They 
were, of course, fired at frequently, and in the course of their 
travels a 1 2-pound shot struck directly by them. They qui- 
etly picked up the shot, held on to the sheep, and brought 
the shot to me, yet warm. I never saw so cool and gallant 
a set of men ; they do not seem to know what fear is. 

Near Yorktown, April 6, i A.M. ... I find the enemy in 
strong force and in a very strong position, but will drive him 
out. Fitz-John is in the advance on the right, Baldy on the

left ; they are doing splendidly. Their divisions have been 
under fire all the afternoon ; have lost only about five killed 
in each, and have punished secesh badly. Thus far it has been 
altogether an artillery affair. 

While listening this t P.M. to the sound of the guns I received 
an order detaching McDowell's corps from my command. It 
is the most infamous thing that history has recorded. I have 
made such representations as will probably induce a revoca- 
tion of the order, or at least save Franklin to me. The idea 
of depriving a general of 35,000 troops when actually under 
fire! 

To-morrow night I can tell you exactly what I intend doing. 
We have no baggage to-night, our wagons being detained by the 
bad roads. I have taken possession of a hut in a deserted 
secesh camp ; found a table therein, and sleep on a horse- 
blanket, if I find time to " retire." Colburn is copying a long 
letter ; Seth, standing by the fire, looking very sleepy. He 
wakes up and sends his kindest regards, in which Colburn asks 
to participate. I am sorry to say that your father is snoring 
loudly in a corner. 

April 6, 1.40 P.M. ... Did not get to bed until 3.30, and 
then my bed was a rather rough one, as our wagons did not 
arrive. Things quiet to-day ; very little firing ; our people are 
pushing their reconnoissances and getting up supplies. I shall 
take the place, but may be some time in effecting it. . . . 

April 8, 8 A.M. Raining hard all night, and still continues 
to do so. Am now encamped about five miles from Yorktown ; 
have been here two or three days. Have now visited both the 
right and left, and, in spite of the heavy rain, must ride to Ship 
Point and our right immediately after breakfast. All I care 
for about the rain is the health and comfort of the men. They 
are more fond of me than ever ; more enthusiastic than I 
deserve ; wherever I go it seems to inspire the fullest confi- 
dence. . . . 

I have raised an awful row about McDowell's corps. The 
President very coolly telegraphed me yesterday that he thought 
I had better break the enemy's lines at once ! I was much 
tempted to reply that he had better come and do it himself.

April 9, near Yorktown, 8 A.M. . . . Last night returned 
late and was fully occupied with reports of reconnoissances, 
etc., until very late. 

It rained nearly every moment yesterday, all the night before, 
all last night, but has now stopped, though likely to commence 
again at any moment. It is execrable weather; everything knee- 
deep in mud ; roads infamous : but we will get through it. I 
have had great difficulty in arranging about supplies so few 
wngons and such bad roads. Rode down to Ship Point yester- 
day morning. . . . 

9 A.M. Interrupted and unable to finish. Have been both- 
ered all the evening, but am getting things straightened out. 
. . . Start for the Point in a few minutes. . . . 

April 10, 10 P.M. Have had a pretty long ride to-day. Sec- 
retary Fox spent last night with me. As soon as he had gone I 
rode to Porter's camp, thence to the river-bank to meet Capt. 
Missroom, commanding the gunboats. Have had an excellent 
view of the water defences of Yorktown, as well as of Glouces- 
ter. The enemy is very strong and is adding to his works and 
the number of his men. I could see them coming in on schoon- 
ers. But as my heavy guns are not yet landed, and the navy 
do not feel strong enough to go at them, I can only hurry for- 
ward our preparations and trust that the more they have the 
more I shall catch. . . . 

Yesterday I also spent on the right, taking, under cover of the 
heavy rain, a pretty good look at the ground in front of York and 
its defences. I got back about dark, pretty wet and tired out. 
. . . To-morrow we move headquarters to a much better and 
more convenient camp further to the front. . . . The present 
camp is a little too far from the scene of the most important 
operations. 

April ii. I am just recovering from a terrible scare. Early 
this morning I was awakened by a despatch from Fitz-John's 
headquarters stating that Fitz had made an ascension in the 
balloon this morning, and that the balloon had broken away 
and come to the ground some three miles southwest, which would 
be within the enemy's lines. You can imagine how I felt. I at 
once sent off to the various pickets to find out what they knejv and

McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



try to do something to save him, but the order had no sooner 
gone than in walks Mr. Fitz just as cool as usual. He had 
luckily come down near my own camp after actually passing over 
that of the enemy. You may rest assured of one thing : you 
won't catch me in the confounded balloon, nor will I allow any 
other generals to go up in it. ... 

Don't worry about the wretches ; they have done nearly their 
worst, and can't do much more. I am sure that I will win in the 
end, in spite of all their rascality. History will present a sad 
record of these traitors who are willing to sacrifice the country 
and its army for personal spite and personal aims. The people 
will soon understand the whole matter. 

April 14, ii P.M., Camp Winfield Scott. ... I believe I 
now know who instigated the attack upon me and the country. 
... So Fox told you all about our troubles. They were severe 
for some time, but we are pretty well over the worst of them. . . . 
I do not expect to lose many men, but to do the work mainly 
with artillery, and so avoid much loss of life. Several brave 
fellows have already gone to their long home, but not a large 
number. 

I can't tell you how soon I will attack, as it will depend upon 
the rapidity with which certain preliminary work can be done and 
the heavy guns brought up. I do not fear a repulse. I shall 
not quit the camps until I do so to continue the march on 
Richmond. If I am repulsed once, will try it again, and keep 
it up until we succeed. But I do not anticipate a repulse ; am 
confident of success. ... I received to-day a very kind letter 
from old Mr. Blair, which I enclose for you to keep for me. . . . 
Remained at home this morning, doing office-work, but rode out 
all the afternoon; rode to the front and took another look at 
seeesh. . . . 

8.30 A.M., i$th. Am about starting for the gunboats, which 
are anchored near here, to take a better look at the opposite 
shore. ... It is raining a little this morning not much more 
than a drizzle. . . . 

April 1 8, 1.15 A.M. . . . About a half-hour ago the accus- 
tomed intermittent sound of artillery was varied in its monotony 






PRIVA TE LETTERS. 3 I i 

by a very heavy and continued rattle of musketry, with the ac- 
companiment of a very respectable firing of artillery. I started 
at once for the telegraph-office, and endeavored in vain for some 
ten or fifteen minutes to arouse the operators at the stations in 
the direction of the firing. So I ordered twenty of the escort 
to saddle up, and started off Hudson, Sweitzer, and the Due de 
Chartres to learn the state of the case. The firing has ceased 
now for some minutes, and I am still ignorant as to its where- 
abouts and cause. Of course I must remain up until I know 
what it is. I had had Arthur, Wright, Hammerstein, Radowitz, 
and the Comte de Paris, as well as Colburn, also up, with some 
of the escort ready to move or carry orders, as the case may 
be, but just now told them to lie down until I sent for them. It 
is a beautiful moonlight night, clear and pleasant almost too 
much so for sleeping. . . . Poor Wagner, of the Topogs, lost an 
arm this afternoon by the bursting of a shell ; he is doing well, 
however. 

Merrill was severely but not dangerously wounded in the arm 
yesterday. In Smith's affair yesterday we lost, I fear, nearly 
200 killed and wounded. The object I proposed had been fully 
accomplished with the loss of about 20, when, after I left the 
ground, a movement was made in direct violation of my orders, 
by which the remainder of the loss was uselessly incurred. I 
do not yet know the details nor who is responsible. We have 
a severe task before us, but we will gain a brilliant success. . . . 
Colburn is my stand-by so true and faithful. Many of my aides 
are excellent. No general ever labored under greater disadvan- 
tages, but I will carry it through in spite of everything. I hope 
Franklin will be here to-morrow or next day. I will then invest 
Gloucester and attack it at the same time I do York. When the 
Galena arrives I will cause it to pass the batteries, take them in 
reverse, and cut off the enemy's communications by York river. 
As I write I hear our guns constantly sounding and the bursting 
of shells in Secession. 

9 P.M. The firing of last night was caused by the attempt of 
a part of the enemy to cross the stream in Smith's front. They 
were repulsed at once ; tried it later, and were again driven back. 

April 19, 10.30 P.M. . . . To-day it has been very quiet ; 
our batteries have merely fired enough to keep the enemy en- 



312 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

tirely silent at his works in front of Smith and at Wynn's Mill. 
Last night we commenced a battery, at Farnholdt's house, for 
five loo-pounder Parrotts and one 2oo-pounder Parrott ; also 
one for fifteen heavy guns about two thousand yards from the 
enemy's main defences; another for six and one for five close by. 
Another for six was armed to-day, and kept down the enemy's 
fire at Wynn's Mill. To-morrow evening we commence batteries 
for thirteen mortars. About Monday night we will construct the 
first parallel and several other batteries in exposed positions, leav- 
ing those already commenced to cover the work and render it 
more safe. We shall soon be raining down a terrible tempest 
on this devoted place. To-day the enemy sent a flag of truce 
to Smith, asking a suspension of hostilities to bury the killed of 
the 1 6th. The officer who met with Sweitzer acknowledged that 
their loss was very severe and the bearing of our men admirable. 
I received to-day a letter from Burnside, which I enclose. . . . 

Franklin arrived yesterday and spent the night in my tent. 
He is at Ship Point to-night ; I expect his division to-morrow. 
. . . Don't be at all discouraged ; all is going well. I know 
exactly what I am about. I can't go " with a rush " over strong 
posts. I must use heavy guns and silence their fire ; all that 
takes much time, and I have not been longer than the usual 
time for such things much less than the usual, in truth. . . . 

I can't tell you when Yorktown is to be attacked, for it 
depends on circumstances that I cannot control. It shall be 
attacked the first moment I can do it successfully. But I don't 
intend to hurry it ; I cannot afford to fail. I may have the 
opportunity of carrying the place next week, or may be delayed 
a couple of weeks ; much, of course, depends on the rapid- 
ity with which the heavy guns and ammunition arrive. Never 

mind what such people as say ; they are beneath contempt. 

... I will put in a leaf of holly from the bower some of the 
men have made in front of my tent to-day. They have made 
quite an artistic thing of it holly and pine ; it adds much, too, 
to my comfort, as k renders the tent more private and cool. 

April 20, 7.30 A.M. ... It has been raining more or less 
all night, and if it were not for the men I would enjoy the rain, 
for I rather like to hear it patter on the tent. 

I have a fire in my stove this morning, so it is quite com-

fortable. My tent is the same the aides use for an office ; it has 
a floor of pine boughs a carpet of boughs, I suppose I ought to 
say a table in the middle, a desk in one corner, my bed in an- 
other, my saddle in another, a wood-pile, etc., in the last. I have 
a splendid two-legged washstand which Charles's mechanical 
ingenuity devised. Then I have a clothes-rack, consisting of a 
sapling with the stumps of the branches projecting. So you see 
I am living quite en prince. 

April 21. Yesterday was rather unpleasant; rained a good 
deal. To-day about the same ; not raining much yet, but a kind 
of drizzle. Had a letter yesterday from Francis B. Cutting, of 
New York, hoping that I would not allow these treacherous 
hounds to drive me from my path. Have just replied to it. 

April 22, 11.15 P - M - The enemy has been blazing 
away a good deal to-day, but hurt nothing, however ; he tried his 
best at a skirmish with some of Smith's men this morning, but 
was repulsed with loss. It is said that some of his troops were 
blacks. I do not, however, give full credit to this. It seems 
too improbable to be true. The navy have been firing this morn- 
ing at long range. 

April 23, 7 A.M. . . . Some few shots fired already, but not 
many : secesh don't mean to get up very early. I am rather 
anxious to hear the result of last night's work ; for I am in hopes 
that I can get all the batteries that have been commenced well 
aimed to-night, so that the first parallel may be commenced at 
once. The weather has cleared off beautifully again, so that I 
am in strong hopes we shall have no more rain for some time. 
You have no idea of the effect of a couple of days' rain in this 
country ; roads, camps, etc., become impassable. . . . 

11.30 P.M. . . . Have been working hard all day, but not 
in the saddle ; it has been head-work in my tent to-day. I am 
getting on splendidly with my " slow preparations." The prince 
is delighted and thinks my work gigantic. I do believe that I 
am avoiding the fault of the Allies at Sebastopol, and quietly pre- 
paring the way for great success. I have brought forty heavy 
guns in battery ; to-morrow night I hope to have twelve new guns 
and five to ten heavy mortars in battery. I begin in the morning 



314 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the redoubts to cover the flank of the first parallel, which will be 
constructed to-morrow night. I will not open fire unless the 
enemy annoys us, hoping to get all the guns in battery and the 
trenches well advanced before meeting with serious opposition. 
We have done much more than they suspect. Have ordered a 
forced reconnoissance of a dangerous point in the morning ; it 
may cost several lives, but I have taken all possible precautions, 
and hope to gain the information necessary with but little loss. 
There is no other choice than to run the risk. . . . Everything is 
as quiet now as if there were no enemy within a hundred miles of 
us. The Galena, under Rodgers, will be here by day after to- 
morrow. 

April 26. Again raining, and has been all the morning. 
Grover carried a redoubt of the rebels most handsomely this 
morning. It was one from which they had it in their power to 
annoy the left of our parallels, and it was an object to get rid 
of it. The work was handsomely done ; the work carried by 
assault, and then so much destroyed that it can be of no further 
use to the rebels. Fifteen prisoners were taken in the affair. 
We lost three killed, one mortally and about ten others slightly 
wounded ; have not all the details yet. We got eight immense 
mortars up by water last night ; but a canal-boat loaded with 
empty shells ran aground in sight of secesh, who has been blaz- 
ing away at them ; sent one shot through. He has stopped firing 
now, probably because he cannot see on account of the rain. 
To-night we complete the first parallel, which will be nearly four 
thousand yards long : an immense work. From the manner in 
which our men pitched into the little redoubt this morning it is 
clear that the morale is on our side. The men found quite a 
deep and broad ditch in front of the affair, but over it they went 
without a moment's hesitation ! 

April 27, midnight. . . . Was engaged with Barnard, Por- 
ter, etc., until about one, when I rode to the trenches. Then, of 
course, had to walk ; a good deal was muddy, so it was tiresome. 
Went over the whole extent and saw everything with care. The 
enemy have fired a good deal to-day, but the men are now so well 
covered that no one has been hurt to-day. Commenced to-day 
batteries for fifteen lo-inch mortars, and to-night another battery 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 315 

for heavy guns ; another for ten mortars to-morrow morning ; an 
extension of the parallel on the left commenced to-night. By 
to-morrow night the parallel shall be finished in all its details, as 
well as the two covering redoubts on the left. Some time day 
after to-morrow I hope to have thirty-five mortars in battery. 
To-morrow night will open a tuyau in advance leading to a new 
gun-battery fast getting ready to blow secesh up. He will have 
a bad time of it when we open. Have news this evening via 
Richmond that New Orleans is in our possession. I presume it 
is true. So the work goes bravely on. . . . Yesterday made Fitz 
Porter "Director of the Siege" a novel title, but made necessary 
by the circumstances of the case. I give all my orders relating 
to the siege through him, making him at the same time comman- 
dant of the siege operations and a chief of staff for that portion 
of the work. This new arrangement will save me much trouble, 
and relieve my mind greatly, and save much time. In going over 
the line of trenches yesterday I found so many blunders com- 
mitted that I was very thankful to put Porter on duty at once. 
. . . The good fellow (Colburn) never leaves me ; wherever I 
ride he sticks close after me. He is one of the very best men 
I ever knew, so thoroughly honest and reliable. His judgment 
is excellent and he is perfectly untiring. Day and night are about 
the same to him, and he will start out on a long ride at midnight 
in a pitch-dark or rainy night with as much good-humor as at 
midday. " Kentuck " (horse) is still at Fort Monroe sick ; will 
rejoin in a few days, I hope. Marsh is with him, and I am some- 
times half-wicked enough to suspect that Marsh finds Fort Mon- 
roe more comfortable than camp would be. 



April 28, 11.45 P - M - Rode out this P.M., and went over 
most of the ground from right to left. Commenced some new 
work still more to the front to-night ; as it was exposed and dan- 
gerous, and required noiseless and rapid working, I as usual gave 
it to the regulars to do. Have this moment heard that although 
the rebels have been firing a great deal (there goes another gun), 
they have wounded but one man ; the men should be well cov- 
ered by this time, so I fancy the work is safe. I have also (there 
goes another gun) ordered a lot of rifle-pits for sharpshooters 
to be pushed out well to the front ; we will, I hope, gain a 
good deal of ground to-night. Am getting on nicely. Will have 



3i6 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

some more batteries ready for their guns by to-morrow P.M., and 
will very shortly be able to open on secesh. He tried to annoy 
one of our working parties this morning with a couple of guns ; 
I sent out a field-battery and silenced him after four rounds. 

8 A.M. Colburn came back from the trenches after midnight, 
and reported all going on well ; the regulars had covered them- 
selves well by that time, and the fire of the enemy had only 
wounded one man, and that not badly. Glitz was in command 
of the working party last night. To-day weather good ; will not 
rain. Hope to make good progress this morning. Good deal 
of firing going on now. 

April 30, A.M. Had a quiet night ; very little firing ; drove 
them out of an orchard whence they had been annoying us, and 
pushed them still further in towards their works. A good deal 
of firing on their part yesterday ; did very little harm, killing 
some three and wounding four or five of our people. Scarcely 
a gun fired to-day as yet ; we are working like horses and will 
soon be ready to open. It will be a tremendous affair when we 
do begin, and will, I hope, make short work of it. ... Have 
put the regulars on the exposed portions of the work, they work 
so much better. A raw, disagreeable day ; I fear it will rain 
unless it snows ; wind from east. . . . 

10.30 P.M. After I got through my morning work went down 
to see the opening of Battery No. i. It worked handsomely ; 
drove all the rebel schooners away from the wharf, and made a 
general scatteration. The effect was excellent. Shall not open 
the general fire for some four days I hope on Monday A.M. 

Next morning (May i). Another wet, drizzly, uncomfortable 
sort of a day. Good deal of firing during the night. I shall be 
very glad when we are really ready to open fire, and then finish 
this confounded affair. I am tired of public life ; and even now, 
when I am doing the best I can for my country in the field, I 
know that my enemies are pursuing me more remorselessly than 
ever, and " kind friends " are constantly making themselves 
agreeable by informing me of the pleasant predicament in which 
I am the rebels on one side, and the abolitionists and other 
scoundrels on the other. I believe in my heart and conscience, 
however, that I am walking ^on the ridge between the two gulfs, 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 317 

and that all I have to do is to try to keep the path of honor and 
truth, and that God will bring me safely through. At all events 
I am willing to leave the matter in His hands, and will be con- 
tent with the decision of the Almighty. 

May 3, 12.30 A.M. After the hot firing of to-day everything 
is so unusually still that I am a little suspicious that our friends 
may intend a sortie ; so I have taken all the steps necessary to 
be ready for them, and am sitting up for a while to await devel- 
opments. I feel much better satisfied when they are firing than 
when they are silent. To-day they have wasted about a thousand 
rounds and have done us no harm worth speaking of, except 
(Irish) bursting one of their own guns. We are now nearly 
ready to open ; shall begin, I think, on Monday morning, cer- 
tainly by Tuesday. If all works well it is not impossible that we 
shall have Yorktown by Wednesday or Thursday. The task is 
a difficult one, yet I am sure we have taken the right way to 
accomplish our purpose, and that we will soon win. I fear that 
we are to have another storm to-night. We want no more rain, 
but will m.ake the best of it if it comes. Had plenty of work to 
do at home all the morning, and in the afternoon rode down to 
" Shield's House " to meet the new commander of the flotilla, 
Capt. Smith. ... I don't half like the perfect quietness which 
reigns now. I have given orders to take advantage of it and 
push our approaches as far forward as possible. It don't seem 
natural. It looks like a sortie or an evacuation. If either, I hope 
it may be the former. I do not want these rascals to get away 
from me without a sound drubbing, which they richly deserve 
and will be sure to get if they remain. ... I feel that the fate 
of a nation depends upon me, and I feel that I have not one 
single friend at the seat of government. Any day may bring an 
order relieving me from command. If they will simply let me 
alone I feel sure of success ; but will they do it ? 

May 5, 9.30 A.M. . . . You will have learned ere this that 
Yorktown is ours. It is a place of immense strength, and was 
very heavily armed. It so happened that our preparation for the 
attack was equally formidable, so that Lee, Johnston, and Davis 
confessed that they could not hold the place. They evacuated 
it in a great hurry, leaving their heavy guns, baggage, etc. I sent 



318 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the cavalry after them at once, and our advance is now engaged 
with them at Williamsburg. The weather is infamous ; it has 
been raining all night, and is still raining heavily ; no signs of 
stopping ; roads awful. I hope to get to West Point to-day, 
although the weather has delayed us terribly. It could not well 
be worse, but we will get through nevertheless. The villains 
(secesh) have scattered torpedoes everywhere by springs, wells, 
etc. It is the most murderous and barbarous thing I ever 
heard of. 



CHAPTER XIX. 

Confederate retreat Pursuit towards Williamsburg Battle of Williams- 
burg The horse Dan Webster. 

IT appears that Gen. Johnston, the Confederate commander, 
regarded the position of Yorktown and the Warwick as easily 
held against a simple assault, but as untenable against siege ope- 
rations, or when we could pass up the York or James rivers ; 
therefore he withdrew as soon as satisfied that we were on the 
point of using our heavy guns. 

He directed the movement to commence at dusk on the 4th 
of May, Magruder's command to move by the Lee's Mill road, 
to 'halt at the junction of roads on the Yorktown side of Wil- 
liamsburg, and occupy the line of fortifications ; Longstreet's 
division to follow Magruder's ; D. H. Hill's and G. W. Smith's 
divisions to march by the Yorktown road. Longstreet, Hill, and 
Smith were to pass through Williamsburg, Smith halting on the 
Barhamsville road far enough out to leave room for the other 
troops between himself and the town. It was expected that 
Magruder and Hill would clear the way to enable Longstreet 
and Smith to start at nine P.M., so that the whole army could 
reach Williamsburg soon after midnight ; but it was sunrise of 
the 5th before Smith's road was clear, and his rear reached 
the fortifications near Williamsburg about noon. He found 
that the fortifications were unoccupied ; and as skirmishing was 
taking place about two miles back, he halted a small body whom 
he found between the works and Williamsburg, and reported the 
state of affairs to Gen. Johnston, who ordered back McLaws's 
brigade and Stuart's cavalry. 

Early in the morning of the 4th of May, the moment I learned 
that our troops were in possession of Yorktown and the line of 
the Warwick, I ordered Gen. Stoneman in pursuit with all the 
available force of cavalry and horse-artillery, supported by infan- 
try, on both the Lee's Mill and Yorktown roads to Williamsburg. 

319 



32O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

The next, and by far the most important, step was to throw 
Franklin's division, supported promptly and strongly, as rapidly 
as possible up the York river by water, to land on its right bank 
opposite West Point, in order to take in reverse whatever works 
might exist between that point and Yorktown, and to cut off, if 
possible, the enemy's trains and troops still south of the mouth of 
the Pamunkey. 

While keeping steadily in view Stoneman's operations and his 
proper support, I at once turned my attention to expediting the 
movement up the York river by water. The weather was so bad 
and the wharf facilities at Yorktown so deficient that it was very 
difficult to bring order out of chaos, and Franklin's division did 
not reach its destination until the 6th of May. 

On the morning of the 4th, then, Stoneman moved out of 
Yorktown with four batteries of horse-artillery, the ist and 6th 
U. S. Cavalry, the 8th 111. Cavalry, and Barker's squadron of 
111. cavalry. Hooker's division was ordered to move as rap- 
idly as possible by the same road in support, and Heintzelman 
was ordered to hold himself in readiness to follow with Kearny's 
division if necessary. 

Smith having reported the enemy's infantry and cavalry in 
force about one and a half miles in rear of Lee's Mill, Stoneman 
was ordered to cut off their retreat in the vicinity of the Half- 
way House. At the same time Sumner, in command of the left, 
was ordered to restore the bridges over the Warwick and place 
Smith's and Couch's divisions of the 4th corps, and Casey's if 
necessary, in front of the reported hostile force, endeavoring to 
hold them where they were until Stoneman could gain their line 
of retreat ; but attacking if they fell back. His pursuit was to 
be by the Lee's Mill road, with Smith leading. The remaining 
divisions those of Porter, Sedgwick, Richardson, and Sykes 
were held in readiness to support either Keyes, Heintzelman, or 
Franklin, as might prove most advantageous. Stoneman was 
thus ordered not only to pursue and harass the enemy's rear- 
guard, but also to endeavor to cut off those on the Lee's 
Mill road in front of Sumner. 

About six miles from Yorktown Stoneman came upon the 
enemy's pickets ; two miles further on he came up with their 
rear-guard, a regiment of cavalry, posted on the further bank 
of a difficult ravine. Gibson's battery soon drove them out of 



WILLIAM SB URG. 3 2 I 

this position. At this point he sent Gen. Emory, with Benson's 
battery, the 3d Penn., and Barker's squadron, across to the 
Lee's Mill road to cut off the force in front of Sumner, who 
was supposed to be advancing by that road. With the remainder 
of his force Stoneman pushed on as rapidly as safety permitted 
to occupy the junction of the Yorktown and Lee's Mill roads, 
about two miles south of Williamsburg. Before detaching Emo- 
ry, Stoneman had communicated with Sumner's advanced guard, 
and had also learned that Hooker was close behind on the York- 
town road. Gen. P. St. G. Cooke, commanding the advanced 
guard, consisting of a section of Gibson's battery and a part of 
the ist U. S. Cavalry, upon debouching from the wood found 
himself at the junction of the two roads immediately in front 
of a strong earthwork (Fort Magruder) flanked by redoubts, 
and in presence of a strong rear-guard, consisting of a regi- 
ment of cavalry, one battery, and three regiments of infantry. 
With his small force Cooke made immediate dispositions to 
attack, and Stoneman hastened up the remainder of the ist 
Cavalry and of Gibson's battery. 

The cleared ground available for the operations of cavalry 
and artillery was here so limited that only about three hundred 
cavalry and one battery could be brought into action. Foresee- 
ing that he must soon retreat unless promptly supported by the 
infantry some two miles in rear at last accounts Stoneman 
formed the remainder of his force in a clearing half a mile 
in rear, in order to cover the withdrawal of his advanced 
guard when that became necessary, and sent to hurry up the 
infantry. With great difficulty, so deep was the mud and so 
thick the abattis, Gibson got his battery in position, and Col. 
W. A. Grier formed his regiment (ist U. S.) to support it. 
Meanwhile the enemy, strongly reinforced from his main body, 
had thrown himself into the abandoned works, and several regi- 
ments of infantry were seen moving in a direction threatening 
to turn Stoneman's right, on which he directed Maj. L. Williams, 
commanding the 6th U. S. Cavalry, to make a demonstration 
through the woods on the right in order to check the enemy 
until the infantry could arrive. 

The fire of Fort Magruder upon Cooke's command was pro- 
ducing serious effects, and the 6th Cavalry had come upon a 
strong force of infantry and cavalry, and was saved from destruc- 



322 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

tion by a gallant charge made by Capt. Saunders, commanding 
the rear squadron, during the withdrawal of the regiment. 

Col. Grier had made two brilliant charges ; men and horses 
were falling rapidly, and the enemy was receiving reinforcements 
every moment. After having held the position for about three- 
quarters of an hour Stoneman learned that Hooker could not 
get up for two hours. Under these circumstances, having done 
all in his power to hold his position, he fell back upon the clear- 
ing already occupied by his reserves, prepared to hold it to the 
utmost. He at least held the enemy to their works, and gave us 
the opportunity of fighting the battle of the next day. 

As already stated, Gen. Emory was detached at the Halfway 
House, and on reaching the Lee's Mill road encountered an 
equal force of the enemy, whom he drove back on the Lee's Mill 
road, whence they escaped by a circuitous route along the banks 
of the James. Their escape was accounted for by the fact that 
Emory could not follow them without abandoning the road he 
was ordered to hold, and leaving his battery there unprotected, 
as he had no infantry. Smith's advance reached Skiff's creek at 
about 11.30, to find the bridge in flames and the road impassable. 
He therefore, by direction of Gen. Sumner, moved across to the 
Yorktown road, and, following it, reached Stoneman's position at 
about 5.30 o'clock, Gen. Sumner arriving with him and assum- 
ing command of all the troops at the front. 

Hooker's division had encountered Smith's filing into the 
Yorktown road, and was obliged to halt for some three or four 
hours until it had passed. Subsequently, on its arrival at Chesa- 
peake Church, Gen. Heintzelman turned it off by a cross-road 
into the Lee's Mill road, thus changing places with Smith. 
Marching part of the night, he came in sight of Fort Magruder 
early on the 5th. As soon as Smith reached the front his divi- 
sion was deployed and directed by Gen. Sumner to attack the 
works in front of him ; but confusion arising in the dense for- 
est, and darkness coming on, the attempt was deferred to the next 
day. 

The troops bivouacked in the woods, and a heavy rain began, 
which lasted till the morning of the 6th, and made the roads, 
already terribly cut up by the enemy's troops and trains, almost 
impassable. Early in the evening of the 4th I learned that 
Smith had reached the front, and that at six P.M. two more divi-

sions would soon be ready, and were only waiting to rest the 
men and let them take a little food before attacking ; and that 
the works would soon be carried, as they were then reported to 
be held only by a rear-guard of a regiment of cavalry, two guns, 
and four or five regiments of infantry. 

I therefore pushed with redoubled energy the arrangements 
to throw a force by water to the mouth of the Pamunkey, and 
had not the slightest reason to suppose that my presence was at 
all necessary at the front. 

The position is about four miles in extent, the right resting 
on College creek, and the left on Queen's creek ; nearly three- 
fourths of its front being covered by tributaries of these two 
creeks, upon which there are ponds. 

The ground between the heads of the boundary streams is a 
cultivated plain, across which a line of detached works had been 
constructed, consisting of Fort Magruder, a large work in the 
centre with a bastion front, and twelve other redoubts and epaul- 
ments for field-guns. 

The parapet of Fort Magruder is about six feet high and 
nine feet thick ; the ditch nine feet wide and nine feet deep, 
filled with water. The length of the interior crest is about six 
hundred yards. The redoubts have strong profiles, but are of 
small dimensions, having faces of about forty yards. The woods 
in front of the position were felled, and the open ground in front 
of the works was dotted with numerous rifle-pits. 

The roads leading from the lower part of the Peninsula 
towards Williamsburg, one along the York river (the Yorktown 
road) and the other along the James (the Lee's Mill road), unite 
between the heads of the tributary streams a short distance in 
front of Fort Magruder, by which they are commanded, and 
debouch from the woods just before uniting. A branch from 
the James river road leaves it about one and three-fourths of a 
mile below Fort Magruder and unites with the road from Allen's 
landing to Williamsburg, which crosses the tributary of College 
creek over a dam at the outlet of the pond, and passes just in 
rear of the line of works, being commanded by the three re- 
doubts on the right of the line. At about the same distance 
from Fort Magruder a branch leaves the York river road and 
crosses the tributary of Queen's creek on a dam, and, passing 
over the position and through the woods in its rear, finally enters 



324 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Williamsburg. This road was commanded by redoubts on the 
left of the line of works. 

On the morning of the 5th the position of our troops was 
as follows : On the extreme left, Emory, holding the road to 
Allen's farm ; next, on his right, Hooker's division ; next, in 
the centre, Stoneman, holding the main road ; on his right 
Smith's division. Kearny, Couch, and Casey were still in rear, 
having bivouacked where the night overtook them. Couch and 
Casey were ordered to march at daylight to support Smith ; 
at about nine o'clock Kearny was ordered up in support of 
Hooker. 

The battle of Williamsburg was an accident, brought about 
by the rapid pursuit of our troops. The enemy were very 
anxious to get beyond West Point before we could reach it by 
water. Late in the afternoon of the 4th Gen. G. W. Smith was 
ordered to march at 2.30 A.M. of the 5th, and place his position 
north of Barhamsville to check any attempt on the Confederate 
line of retreat from the upper York river. Longstreet and Hill 
were to follow Smith on the Barhamsville road for about six 
miles, and then turn off at the Burned Tavern and take the 
Charles City road to Richmond via Long bridge. Magruder was 
to move by New Kent Court-House and Bottom bridge. From 
Barhamsville Smith was to follow Magruder. Smith commanded 
the troops on' the New Kent Court-House road, Longstreet those 
on the Charles City road. The rain made the roads so bad that 
when we caught up with their rear-guard they were forced to 
reinforce it from their main body, and hold the works as long 
as possible, in order to enable their trains to escape. 

On the afternoon of the 4th Longstreet's division, six bri- 
gades, had halted near Williamsburg, four brigades at or in rear 
of the line of works, two brigades, Wilcox and Colston, on the 
Richmond side. About seven next morning Wilcox was ordered 
to return to the line of works and report to Gen. Anderson. Wil- 
cox was placed on the right and about one thousand yards in 
front of Fort Magruder, and at the time held the right of the 
Confederate line, posted in the pine-woods with occasional clear- 
ings. He supposed that there was nothing but cavalry in his 
front, but, sending two companies into the woods, they captured 
three of our infantry soldiers ; whereupon he sent in a Missis- 
sippi regiment, deployed as skirmishers, with orders to advance 



BATTLE OF WILLIAMSBURG. 325 

until forced to halt, and to find out what was in front. Up to 
this time there had been merely a dropping fire of skirmishers, 
giving the impression that the woods were held by dismounted 
cavalry ; but now heavy firing followed, and the report came 
back to Wilcox that three United States brigades were there in 
position. These brigades composed Hooker's division. And all 
this must have taken place between nine and ten A.M. 

Wilcox immediately sent for reinforcements, and the rest of 
Longstreet's division gradually came up to his support, mostly 
being placed on his right, Gen. Richard Anderson finally tak- 
ing command. Early in the afternoon, being apprehensive for 
his right, Anderson again attacked, took five guns of Webber's 
battery, and brought Hooker to a standstill, inflicting heavy 
losses. 

Between three and four o'clock Kearny reached the front. 
He had received the order to advance at nine o'clock, but, from 
the condition of the roads and their being blocked with troops, 
with all his energy and exertions he was unable to reach Hooker 
until the time mentioned. He at once relieved Hooker's ex- 
hausted troops, and, promptly attacking, drove back the enemy 
at every point. Hooker's losses were severe, and when I next 
saw him, a day or two afterwards, he was much depressed and 
thought that he had accomplished nothing, so much so that I 
felt it necessary to encourage him. It was not until some time 
afterwards that he came to the conclusion that he had accom- 
plished a brilliant feat of arms. 

Emory had been left to guard the road leading to Allen's 
farm, near the James. Being informed on the morning of the 
5th that the enemy's right could be turned, he called upon Gen. 
Heintzelman for infantry to enable him to make the attempt. 
Late in the afternoon one of Kearny's brigades and two bat- 
teries were sent to him for that purpose, " but that was found 
impracticable from the nature of the locality, the lateness of the 
evening, and the want of a guide." 

While all this was going on on our left Sumner reconnoitred 
the position in the centre and on our right. Finding that one 
of the redoubts on the Confederate left was unoccupied, he, 
at about eleven o'clock, ordered Hancock's brigade, of Smith's 
division, to cross by a dam at the foot of one of the large ponds 
and take possession of it. This he did with five regiments of 



326 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the division, and, finding the next redoubt also unoccupied, he 
promptly seized it, and sent for reinforcements to enable him 
to advance further and take the next redoubt, which command- 
ed the plain between his position and Fort Magruder, and would 
have enabled him to take in reverse and cut the communica- 
tion of the troops engaged with Gens. Hooker and Kearny. 

The enemy soon began to show himself in strength before 
him, and, as his rear and right flank were somewhat exposed, he 
repeated his request for reinforcements. Gen. Smith was twice 
ordered to join him with the rest of his division, but each time 
the order was countermanded at the moment of execution, Gen. 
Sumner not being willing to weaken the centre. At length, in 
reply to Gen. Hancock's repeated messages for more troops, 
Gen. Sumner sent him an order to fall back to his first posi- 
tion, the execution of which Gen. Hancock deferred as long as 
possible, being unwilling to give up the advantage already 
gained, and fearing to expose his command by such a move- 
ment. 

As the head of Couch's division did not arrive until one 
o'clock, it was entirely proper for Gen. Sumner to hesitate about 
weakening his centre until that hour. The remaining brigades 
of Couch followed the first immediately, Casey arriving early 
in the afternoon. Couch's ist brigade, Peck's, was deployed on 
Hooker's right, and promptly repulsed the attack made upon it, 
thus affording Hooker sensible relief. Soon after it was relieved 
by the other two brigades, who remained undisturbed. 

As already stated, as soon as our troops were in possession of 
the enemy's works, on the morning of the 4th, I gave the neces- 
sary orders for the pursuit, and, when all that was accomplished, 
drove into Yorktown in an ambulance. The enemy had made 
a free distribution of torpedoes in the roads, within the works, 
and in places where our men would be apt to go for instance, 
near wells and springs, telegraph-offices, and store-houses s 
that some of our men were killed. To place mines or torpedoes 
in the path of assaulting columns is admissible under the cus- 
toms of war, but such use of them as was made here is bar- 
barous in the extreme. When I entered Yorktown our progress 
was much delayed by the caution made necessary by the pre- 
sence of these torpedoes. I at once ordered that they should 
be discovered and removed by the Confederate prisoners. They 



" THA T DE VIL DAK." 327 

objected very strenuously, but were forced to do the work. After 
Williamsburg one of the Confederate surgeons, sent in to offer 
to take care of their wounded in our hands, told me that these 
torpedoes were planted at the close of the evacuation, and men- 
tioned the name of an officer whom he saw engaged in this 
work. 

As soon as we had possession of Yorktown the gunboats 
started up the York river to ascertain whether the transports 
with Franklin's division could safely ascend, and to capture any 
of the enemy's transports they could find. 

If the condition of affairs near Williamsburg justified it, I 
intended going to West Point by water myself. Early on the 
5th I sent Col. Sweitzer and Maj. Hammerstein, of my staff, to 
the front, to keep me informed of the condition of affairs and 
the progress of events. I went to Yorktown to expedite the 
movement by water, and to provide for the transportation of 
supplies to the troops in advance. 

Until about one P.M. I learned nothing indicating that the 
affair at Williamsburg was more than a simple attack upon a 
rear-guard, but at that hour I received intelligence that the 
state of the contest was unfavorable and that my presence was 
urgently required. Sedgwick's division was then held ready to 
embark in support of Franklin. But I ordered him to move 
beyond Yorktown a short distance, ready to move to the front 
if ordered. Porter and Richardson were also instructed to be 
ready to obey whatever orders they might receive. 

I returned at once to my camp to give these and other nec- 
essary orders, and, remaining there only a few minutes, started 
with half a dozen aides and a few orderlies for the front. The 
distance was more than fourteen miles, over terrible roads, much 
obstructed by trains ; but as I had my most trustworthy horse, 
Dan Webster, I made better progress than was agreeable to the 
escort, most of whom had been left behind when I reached the 
field of battle. 

Dan was one of those horses that could trot all day long at 
i\ very rapid gait which kept all other horses at a gallop. I 
think it was on this ride that he earned from the aides the 
title of " that Devil Dan " a name which he justified on 
many another long and desperate ride before I gave up the 
command of the Army of the Potomac. 



328 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Dan was the best horse I ever had ; he never was ill for an 
hour, never fatigued, never disturbed under fire, and never lost 
his equanimity or his dignity, except on one occasion. That 
was when we abandoned the position at Harrison's Bar un- 
der the orders to return to Washington. From a very natural 
feeling I remained there until all the trains and troops had left, 
and, sending forward all the escort and staff, remained alone in 
the works for a little time, my mind full of the fatal conse- 
quences of the order I was forced to carry into execution. At 
length I mounted and rode out to join the escort ; as I passed 
through the abandoned works Dan, for the first time in his life, 
gave vent to his feelings by a series of most vicious plunges and 
kicks. It was possible that the flies, who had enjoyed a whole 
army to feed upon, concentrated all their energies upon Dan ; 
but I have always more than suspected that, in his quiet way, 
Dan understood the condition of affairs much better than the 
authorities at Washington, and merely wished to inform me in 
his own impressive manner that he fully agreed with my views 
as to the folly of abandoning the position, and that he, at least, 
had full confidence in his master. 

Dan and I never quarrelled, and the dear old fellow sur- 
vived the war for many years, dying at a ripe old age in 1879. 
No matter how long we might be parted once for nearly four 
years he always recognized me the moment we met again, 
and in his own way showed his pleasure at seeing me. Even 
on the day of his death, which was a painless one from old 
age, whenever I entered his stall he tried to rise and greet 
me, but, unable to do that, would lean his head against me and 
lick my hand. No soldier ever had a more faithful or better 
horse than I had in Dan Webster. 

Riding through mud and water, often obliged to turn into 
the woods, but never slackening the pace when the road permit- 
ted, I reached the front between four and five o'clock. I found 
everything in a state of chaos and depression. Even the pri- 
vate soldiers saw clearly that, with force enough in hand to gain 
a victory, we, the pursuers, were on the defensive and content 
with repulsing attacks, and that there was no plan of action, 
no directing head. The front line was formed along the nearer 
edge of the woods, and the rest massed inactive in the clear- 
ings. The troops were weary and discouraged ; but my pre- 



33O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

sence at once restored their confidence, and, as they recognized 
me passing rapidly through their ranks, their wild and joyful 
cheers told the enemy, as well as our own people, that some- 
thing unusual had occurred, and that the period of uncertainty 
and inaction was at an end. 

I at once gathered the general officers around me, called 
upon them for a brief statement of affairs, and promptly made 
up my mind as to what should be done. This occurred in the 
clearing, close to the Whittaker House. I found that, owing 
to some marshy ground, there was no direct communication 
with the two divisions under Heintzelman on our left ; the 
troops forming the front of our centre were on the hither edge 
of the woods intervening between us and the enemy, and no 
one knew whether the enemy were in the woods, and, if so, 
in what force. Hancock, with his unsupported brigade, was 
still in possession of the abandoned works on the enemy's left ; 
one of Smith's remaining brigades was in line on our right 
centre, the other and Casey's division massed in rear ; two of 
Couch's brigades formed the centre, with one in reserve. 

I ordered a party to move in to the left to reopen com- 
munication with Heintzelman. Just then heavy firing began 
at Hancock's position, which was two miles from the nearest 
support, and, grasping at once the fact that he held the key of 
the field of battle, I ordered Smith, who was chafing like a 
caged lion, to move as rapidly as possible to Hancock's support 
with his two remaining brigades and Naglee's. Within five 
minutes of the time I reached the field Smith was off as 
rapidly as his men could move ; Naglee, with his brigade of 
Casey's division, following the leading regiment of Smith's 
division. As soon as the head of Smith's column started I 
ordered the centre to advance into the woods and gain the 
more distant edge, driving out any of the enemy who might be 
there. This was promptly done, and I rode in with them, and 
into the cleared ground in front, in close view of the enemy's 
works. There were none of the enemy in the woods, but they 
held the works in considerable force. 

Their position was so strong that when my reconnoissance 
was completed I did not think proper to attack without mak- 
ing arrangements to use our artillery and carefully arrange our 
columns of attack. 






GEN. HANCOCK. 331 

I therefore returned to the Whittaker House, quickly gave 
orders for the proper posting of the troops in the centre, and 
started rapidly for Hancock's position. A little before reaching 
the dam by which he had crossed I met the column of prison- 
ers whom he had just taken. 

Before Gens. Smith and Naglee could reach the field of Gen. 
Hancock's operations, although they moved with great rapidity, 
he had been confronted by a superior force. Feigning to retreat 
slowly, he awaited their onset, and then turned upon them, and, 
after some terrific volleys of musketry, he charged them with 
the bayonet, routing and dispersing their whole force, killing, 
wounding, and capturing from 500 to 600 men, he himself los- 
ing only 31 men. 

This was one of the most brilliant engagements of the war, 
and Gen. Hancock merited the highest praise for the soldierly 
qualities displayed and his perfect appreciation of the vital 
importance of his position. 

Hancock's command consisted of the 5th Wis., 6th Me., 
and 49th Penn. regiments of volunteers of his own brigade, 
and the yth Me. and 30th N. Y. of Davidson's brigade. 
Keeping on to Hancock's brigade, I remained there long 
enough to thank them for their gallant conduct, to appre- 
ciate the importance of the position and the value of the suc- 
cess gained. I sent some of the approaching reinforcements 
to occupy a dangerous mass of woods on the right, and, there 
being no indication of any new attack by the enemy, I left 
as soon as Smith arrived with sufficient troops to render the 
position perfectly secure. By the time Smith's troops all arrived 
and were properly posted it was too dark to attempt any new 
operations until the next morning. 

It was raining heavily and nearly dark when I returned to 
the Whittaker House, so that nothing more could be done than 
to arrange for security during the night and a prompt resump- 
tion of operations in the morning. All the troops slept on the 
muddy field, in the rain, with what protection their shelter-tents 
gave them, and many without food. I was not much better off, 
for, with the exception of a piece of biscuit for breakfast on 
the morning of the 6th, I had nothing to eat from the early 
morning of the 5th until late in the day on the 6th. The night 
was a horrible one. The little Whittaker House was crowded 



33 2 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

with several general officers and their staffs, so that sleep or 
rest was impossible. It rained hard, and I passed much of the 
evening among the men, by way of encouraging them, who 
think little of hardship when their general shares it with them. 

It was unfortunate that the absolute necessity of expediting 
the movement of troops and supplies up the York river detained 
me so long at Yorktown, and that I did not receive earlier infor- 
mation of the necessity for my presence at the front. All the 
reports, up to those that took me so rapidly to the field, 
represented the affair as simply one against an ordinary rear- 
guard, and with good reason I expected every moment to learn 
that the enemy was defeated and his works occupied, as the 
troops on the field of battle were more than enough for the 
purpose. Could I have arrived at one o'clock it is very certain 
that Smith, supported by Couch and afterwards by Casey, would 
have at once debouched from Hancock's ground, and have cut 
off the retreat of the greater part of the troops engaged against 
Hooker. Up to the time of Couch's arrival it would probably 
have been imprudent to move the whole of Smith's division in 
support of Hancock, but the moment the head of Couch's 
column appeared near the front it was proper to push Smith 
forward as rapidly as possible. In fact, Hooker's repulse was 
of no consequence, except for the loss of life it involved, and 
his falling back somewhat would only facilitate the decisive 
advance by our right. When I reached the field the command- 
ing generals gave me the impression that, far from our having 
a simple rear-guard to deal with, the enemy was present in very- 
heavy force. Therefore, to guard against all eventualities, I 
sent back orders to Porter to occupy Yorktown, and to Sedg- 
wick and Richardson to advance by land in the morning. 

During the night Heintzelman reported to me that Hooker's 
division had suffered so much that it could not be relied on for 
the next day, and that Kearny could do no more than hold his 
own unless reinforced. But, after fully considering the state of 
affairs during the evening, I was so confident of the advantage to 
be derived from Smith's possession of the decisive point that I 
determined to carry on our operations with the force then in 
hand, even were the enemy superior in numbers. If the enemy 
held their ground and were not superior in numbers, it was cer- 
tain that an advance by Smith and Casey, with the cavalry, direct 



WILUAMSBURG OCCUPIED. 333 

on Williamsburg, supported by Couch as the centre was cleared, 
would cut off all the troops in front of Heintzelman. Even if 
the enemy proved to be superior in numbers this advance would 
no doubt cause them to withdraw their right and thus enable 
Hooker and Kearny to come into line on Smith's left, and I 
ceuld perfectly well hold my own and keep the enemy in posi- 
tion while the movement to West Point was being carried out. 
Therefore, during the night, I countermanded the orders to Sedg- 
wick and Richardson, and directed them to return to Yorktown 
and, together with Porter, embark as rapidly as possible in sup- 
port of Franklin. 

Early on the morning of the 6th it was found that the enemy 
had abandoned his positions during the night ; we at once occu- 
pied them and the town of Williamsburg, which was filled with 
the enemy's wounded, for whose assistance eighteen of the Con- 
federate surgeons were sent by Gen. J. E. Johnston, the Con- 
federate commander. 



CHAPTER XX.

north of Richmond Fatal to the campaign Movements on this line. 

IT became clear that we had been opposed by only a portion 
of the Confederate army, at first by a single rear-guard, which 
was subsequently considerably reinforced by troops brought back 
during the first night and the next day to hold the works as long 
as possible and enable their trains to escape. Longstreet's and 
D. H. Hill's divisions, more than half their army, were engaged. 
Their losses were heavy, and we captured eight guns and many 
caissons and wagons, which the deep mud prevented them from 
carrying off. 

Wilcox's Confederate brigade, having received no orders, 
found itself at half-past ten P.M. of the 5th entirely alone, and 
moved back beyond Williamsburg, being the last to leave the 
field. It has been stated that G. W. Smith had 'been ordered 
to move at half -past two A.M. of the 5th and take a position 
north of Barhamsville. He moved at the hour designated, just 
as a heavy rain commenced. The roads soon became axle-deep 
in mud, and extraordinary efforts were required to get the wagons 
along. Late in the afternoon, when the head of the column had 
nearly reached Barhamsville, Smith received an order from Gen. 
Johnston to suspend the movement, as a heavy attack had been 
made on the fortifications at Williamsburg, in which Longstreet's 
and D. H. Hill's divisions had been engaged. On the two fol- 
lowing days Gen. Johnston, learning of Franklin's disembarka- 
tion at Brick House, concentrated the greater part of his army 
near Barhamsville. 

It has already been stated that Franklin's division was dis- 
embarked on the 3d of May to take part in the approaching 
assault of Yorktown. Gen. Franklin passed the night of the 3d 
at general headquarters, his division remaining at Cheeseman's 
landing. As soon as the evacuation was known I instructed him 
to re-embark his division immediately and bring it by water to 

334 



FRANKLIN'S ADVANCE. 



335 



Yorktown, where he would receive further orders. He at once 
returned to it and commenced the work, which he carried on 
with all possible speed, completing it about one o'clock on 
the 5th. The embarkation was much delayed by the atrocious 
weather ; by the facts that all the ordinary means for loading and 
unloading were fully occupied with putting supplies ashore for 
the rest of the army, so that Gen. Franklin was obliged to impro- 
vise his own means ; that forage and provision for several days 
had to be reloaded ; but most of all by the difficulty of re-embark- 
ing the artillery, all the carriages of which had to be unlimbered 
and floated out on rafts and then hoisted upon the transports. 
Gen. Franklin's letter explains this subject in detail, and I need 
only say that the delay was unavoidable and that Gen. Franklin 
did not lose an unnecessary moment in carrying his order into 
effect : 

"HARTFORD, Feb. 8, 1884. 
" Gen. G. B. McClellan, New York : 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : It so happens that I have just had 
a correspondence with Howard about the West Point landing in 
May, 1862, and, as it covers the greater part of the ground indi- 
cated in your letter of the 5th inst., I enclose it with this. 

" The long time taken to re-embark my division at Poquosin, 
or Cheeseman's creek, was due 

" ist. To the weather, which, you will remember, was atro- 
cious ; 

" 2d. To the fact that such landing facilities as were at hand 
were fully occupied with gettirfg supplies ashore for the army at 
Yorktown, leaving me to my own crude devices for getting things 
aboard ; and, 

" 3d. To the absolute necessity there was for unlimbering all 
artillery vehicles, in order to pack them in the limited deck- 
space of the transports that were available. 

" This loading the artillery was the great cause of delay. 
Getting the carriages on to the transports was a tedious and 
exasperatihgly slow process. They had to be floated on rafts 
from the shore to the transports and then lifted several feet to 
the deck. I do not now remember how the horses were got 
aboard, but I know that everything was done as quickly as it 
could be done. 

" Then, too, the provisions and forage for several days had 
to be reloaded in the infantry transports a tedious process 
under the circumstances. Towing the artillery transports was a 
very slow process. These transports were each made of two canal 
barges placed about as far apart as the width of beam of a single 




336 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

barge, the whole space being decked over, thus. They had been 

so arranged for the landing 
that it was contemplated I was 
to make when I first arrived. 
They made excellent transports 
for a short run in smooth 
water, but they would hot 
steer and were heart-break- 
ing to tow. So we finally started for Yorktown, when another 
unlooked-for delay occurred by the grounding of many of the 
transports, which were of all draughts of water. I stayed by 
until I saw that all would get off, and then started for Yorktown, 
where I met you in the afternoon and received my instructions. 
Of course, after arriving at West Point, the landing was slow, 
although not nearly so slow as the loading. The infantry and 
artillery were got off during the night, and a line was formed 
which was rectified and strengthened after daylight. I returned 
to my headquarters boat to hurry off the transports, which were 
very slow in moving, and while I was engaged in this business 
an attack was made on Newton's brigade. I hurried ashore and 
found that a sharp attack had been made, by Hampton's brigade, 
I think. They drove Newton out of the woods at first, but the 
brigade soon retook its position, driving the enemy back ; and as 
the gunboats were in position to shell the woods in front of our 
line, a few shots from them drove the enemy off and ended the 
fight. Both lines, however, remained within musket-shot of each 
other until well on in the afternoon, when the transports returned, 
bringing Sedgwick's division, I think it was. As my orders only 
directed me to hold my position, and as my right flank was 
necessarily in the air and ought to have been turned by the 
enemy, I was in no condition to .have advanced into the interior, 
and, in fact, under your orders I had no business to make the 
attempt. 

" Truly your friend, 

"WM. B. FRANKLIN." 

The flotilla experienced great difficulty in reaching Yorktown, 
which it effected about four o'clock on the 5th. Meanwhile Gen. 
Franklin, when the greatest difficulties had been overcome, pre- 
ceded it, and must have reached Yorktown before one o'clock, 
where he received his final instructions from me. 

When the flotilla arrived Gen. Franklin visited Com. Miss- 
room on his flagship and informed him that he was ready to 
start. The commodore replied that he would not consent to 
go up the river on a night as dark as that approaching (it was 
then raining in torrents), and the joint expedition, therefore, 



FRANKLIN AT WEST POINT. 337 

waited until next morning. The commodore was entirely cor- 
rect in this decision to await the morning, for I have not the 
slightest doubt that the result of an effort to move on such a 
night would have been the loss of many transports and lives, and 
the disorganization of the whole expedition. 

The flotilla started at daybreak of the 6th ; the infantry trans- 
ports arrived off West Point about noon, and the landing com- 
menced at once. The artillery transports did not arrive until 
nearly night, and were unloaded without wharves during the 
night and early in the morning of the yth. The process of 
landing was necessarily slow, but not so much so as that of 
loading up. 

At about seven A.M. of the 7th the pickets of Newton's 
brigade, forming the left of the line, were driven in, but soon 
regained the ground. 

Skirmishing continued for a couple of hours, when a sharp 
attack was made by Whiting's division ; this was repulsed, and 
everything then became quiet, our people having regained their 
original positions, and at some points having made considerable 
advances. 

Franklin's orders were simply to hold his position until rein- 
forced sufficiently to justify an advance. That this was a wise 
decision is shown by the fact that G. W. Smith witnessed the dis- 
embarkation, and, refraining from opposing it, suggested to Gen. 
Johnston to take measures to cut him off if he advanced beyond 
the protection of the gunboats. G. W. Smith's entire division, 
much stronger than Franklin's, was in his front, and soon after 
the greater part of the Confederate army, ready to overwhelm 
Franklin had he advanced. 

By the time Sedgwick's division was in position to support 
him, the morning of the 8th, the enemy's rear had passed on 
towards Richmond ; but Franklin's movement had fully served 
its purpose in clearing our front to the banks of the Chicka- 
hominy. 

On my way into Williamsburg on the morning of the 6th I 
passed a cluster of barracks, and, seeing some men lying in them, 
I dismounted to see who they were. They were filled with our 
own and the enemy's wounded. The first man I spoke to was 
one of ours. I asked him who the men around him were. " Oh ! 
that's a secesh ; that is one of our men ; that's a secesh," and so 



33 8 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

on. In reply to my question as to how they had been treated 
by the enemy he said : "Just like their own men." Here were 
these poor fellows lying together in perfect amity who had met 
in mortal combat the day before. 

The College and other large buildings in Williamsburg were 
crowded with wounded, almost all Confederates. While in one 
of the larger hospitals one of my aides came to me and said that 
a wounded Confederate desired to speak to me. I went there 
and found a wounded private soldier belonging to a Virginia 
regiment, an intelligent, honest-looking man, who said that he 
had been deputed by his comrades to beg me to spare their 
lives. I told him that I did not understand him, whereupon he 
repeated his petition, and I again said that I could not imagine 
what he meant. He then said that they had been told that we 
Northern men had come down there to destroy and slay, and 
that our intention was to kill all the prisoners, wounded and 
unwounded alike ; but that they had been told that I had 
treated kindly the prisoners I had taken in West Virginia the 
year before, and thought that perhaps I might be induced to 
spare their lives. I then relieved his mind by telling him that, 
although I was perhaps the most brutal among the Northern 
generals, I would treat them precisely as I did my own wounded. 

The poor fellows stretched on the floor around him followed 
the conversation with keen interest, and I saw by the expression 
of their faces that they felt much relieved when my final answer 
came. I was told, after the battle of Fair Oaks, that when the 
Confederates were for a time in possession of the camp of Casey's 
division Gen. Roger Pryor went around among the wounded, 
giving them whiskey and water, and that he told them it was a 
repayment of the kindness with which their wounded were treated 
at Williamsburg. 

During the forenoon of the 6th Confederate surgeons came in 
(as before stated), under a flag of truce, to offer their services in 
tending their own wounded. I entertained them as well as could 
be done without baggage or supplies, and found them to be very 
agreeable gentlemen. Their services were not needed. 

Having gained possession of Williamsburg, the first thing to 
be done was to get up supplies for the troops, to care for the 
wounded, to hasten supports to Franklin by water, and to force 
the pursuit by land in order to open direct communication with 



PURSUIT. 339 

Franklin, or to bring the enemy to battle if he halted south 
of the mouth of the Pamunkey. The frightful condition of the 
roads rendered the supply question very difficult, but by repair- 
ing the nearest landings on the York river, and by the energy 
of the quartermaster's department, that task was soon accom- 
plished. 

So great were the difficulties of land-transportation that even 
the headquarters wagons did not reach Williamsburg until the 
forenoon of the Qth, up to which time I was absolutely without 
baggage of any kind. Sedgwick's division reached Franklin dur- 
ing the yth ; one brigade of Porter's division got off from York- 
town by water on the afternoon of the yth, the rest on the 8th, 
without cavalry or artillery ; two brigades of Richardson's divi- 
sion got off on the nth, the remaining brigade on the i2th. The 
regular infantry, Duane's engineer battalion, and the light bat- 
teries of the reserve artillery marched from Yorktown on the 8th. 

Immediately upon our arrival in Williamsburg Gen. Averill 
was sent forward with a cavalry force to push the enemy's rear- 
guard. He found several guns abandoned, and captured a num- 
ber of stragglers. But the roads were so bad and his supplies so 
scanty that he was obliged to return after marching a few miles. 
On the next day, the yth, Stoneman moved with the advanced 
guard, consisting of the cavalry, horse-batteries, and two regi- 
ments of infantry, the 2d R. I. and the 98th Penn. 

At ten A.M. his artillery and cavalry had reached a point only 
two and a half to three miles from Williamsburg ; the infantry 
had not yet joined him. At half-past one P.M. he had come up 
with the enemy's rear-guard, at about six miles from Williams- 
burg, and while here he heard heavy firing in the direction of 
Franklin's position. Stoneman's infantry joined him here, com- 
ing up at the double-quick. 

He encamped for the night at a church about ten miles from 
Williamsburg, having been delayed by the condition of the roads 
and the necessity of procuring and cooking meat for the infan- 
try, who were almost in a famished condition. 

At nine A.M. of the 8th he had reached a point fourteen miles 
from Williamsburg. At half-past three P.M. he reached with his 
main body Hockaday's Springs, about six miles and a half from 
Franklin's position, and there learned that his advanced guard 
had communicated with Franklin's pickets. 



340 MCCLELLAND OWN sro&y. 

Stoneman learned here that a Confederate force of ten regi- 
ments of infantry, one battery, and some cavalry had encamped 
the night before at Hockaday's Springs, and left that morning 
via Diascund Bridge, and that the enemy were in full retreat 
upon the Chickahominy. He sent cavalry in pursuit to harass 
the enemy until dark. This detachment found the enemy at 
dark strongly posted at New Kent Court-House, and, in accord- 
ance with instructions, then returned to the main body of the 
advanced guard. 

On the pth Stoneman occupied and held the junction of the 
West Point and Williamsburg roads, about three miles from New 
Kent Court-House. The occupation of this place occurred as 
the result of a brisk skirmish in which a portion of the 6th U. S. 
Cavalry, under Maj. Williams, and Robinson's battery took part ; 
one squadron of the 6th, under the personal command of Maj. 
Williams, made two very handsome charges. 

On the loth Stoneman sent Farnsworth's 8th 111. Cavalry 
some six miles beyond New Kent Court-House, and with his 
main body moved to Cumberland, leaving New Kent Court- 
House occupied by two New Jersey regiments and four guns 
from Franklin's division. 

On the nth he sent Maj. Williams with six companies of 
cavalry to occupy the railroad-crossing at White House and 
scout the surrounding country. He was again delayed on the 
nth by the necessity of awaiting provisions from Franklin. 
Stoneman says : " The men have had no sugar or coffee since 
leaving Williamsburg, and but a very limited amount of hard 
bread and pork. We have lived principally on fresh meat, 
sometimes without salt, for the past week ; but I have not heard 
a complaint or murmur." 

D. R. Jones's division constituted the rear-guard of the ene- 
my. It consisted of ten regiments of infantry, sixteen pieces of 
artillery, and the ist Va. Cavalry. The rear of the rear-guard 
consisted of one regiment of infantry, three pieces of artillery, 
and three squadrons, with which they would check us at every 
difficult place and then leave. Owing to the peculiar nature of 
the country, admirably adapted for the operations of an active 
and vigorous rear-guard, which we had in our front, we could 
get but one chance to attack him and make it tell this at 
Slatesville / from which he was driven with loss. Three miles 



MOVEMENT OP ARMY. 341 

from Slatesville, at New Kent Court-House, the whole division 
was drawn up in line of battle, and I thought it expedient to 
retain with me the New Jersey brigade (two regiments and four 
guns) and Farnsworth's cavalry. 

As soon as a reasonable amount of supplies were received and 
the roads improved somewhat I resumed the movement by land 
from Williamsburg. Smith's division marched on the afternoon 
of the 8th, Couch, Casey, and Kearny on the morning of the pth. 
The reserves came up to Williamsburg on the morning of the same 
day. During the night of the Qth headquarters were four miles in 
front of Williamsburg with the regulars, the other four divisions 
just mentioned in advance, Hooker still at Williamsburg. 

On the evening of the roth headquarters were at Roper's 
Church, nineteen miles beyond Williamsburg, in easy communi- 
cation with Franklin ; the regulars, Smith, Couch, Casey, and 
Kearny near headquarters. We now began to draw supplies 
from Elthan. 

Headquarters remained at Roper's Church until the morning 
of the 1 3th, while the troops were moving in such a manner that 
at the close of that day the disposition was as follows : head- 
quarters, with the divisions of Porter, Franklin, Sykes (regulars), 
and the artillery reserves, at Cumberland, now a temporary depot ; 
Couch and Casey at New Kent Court-House ; Hooker and Kear- 
ny near Roper's Church ; Richardson and Sedgwick near El- 
than. Gen. Van Alen was left, with a small force, as military 
governor of Yorktown ; Col. Campbell with his regiment, the 5th 
Pa. Cavalry, at Williamsburg. 

On the i4th and i5th it rained heavily and continuously, and 
somewhat on the i6th. On the i5th and i6th the divisions of 
Porter, Franklin, and Smith were with great difficulty advanced 
to White House. The roads were so bad, narrow, and infrequent 
as to render the movements of large masses very slow and diffi- 
cult ; so much so that in the movement to White House on the 
1 5th and i6th it required forty-eight hours to move two divisions 
and their trains five miles. 

On the 1 6th headquarters advanced to White House ; and on 
that day and the next Sykes and the reserve artillery moved up 
to the same point with no little difficulty, and a permanent depot 
was established. The weather changed on the night of the i6th, 
so that the lyth and i8th were clear, warm days. 



AfcCLELLAN'S OWtf STORY. 

The i yth and iSth were occupied, while the roads were dry- 
ing, in closing up all the troops and trains, with the final pre- 
parations to advance, and in numerous and extensive reconnois- 
sances pushed in all directions. 

It was at this moment, May 18, 1862, that, in consequence 
of my earnest representations, the President authorized me to 
organize two provisional army corps, the 5th and 6th, which 
soon became permanent corps, and the organization of the Army 
of the Potomac was now as follows : 

2d Corps Gen. Sumner. Consisting of the divisions Sedg- 

wick and Richardson. 
3d Corps Gen. Heintzelman. Consisting of the divisions 

Kearny and Hooker. 
4th Corps Gen. Keyes. Consisting of the divisions Couch and 

Casey. 
5th Corps Gen. Fitz-John Porter. Consisting of the divisions 

Morell, Sykes, and Hunt's reserve artillery. 
6th Corps Gen. Franklin. Consisting of the divisions W. F. 

Smith and Slocum. 

The organization of the cavalry remained unchanged, and, as 
no new regiments were assigned to the Army of the Potomac 
except Col. Campbell's, which remained at Williamsburg, we suf- 
fered very much during the subsequent operations from the glar- 
ing deficiency of the cavalry force in point of numbers. 

On the 1 8th of May headquarters were at White House ; the 
advanced guard held the country nearly to the Chickahominy 
and well to the north of the railway. The 5th and 6th corps 
were at White House ; the 2d, 3d, and 4th corps were near New 
Kent Court-House. 

The enemy had withdrawn across the Chickahominy, having 
his main force between New bridge and Richmond. Bottom's, 
Long, and Jones's bridges were merely watched by small cavalry 
patrols, and there were no indications even of this with regard 
to the last two. 

The necessity of following the enemy until he was fairly 
across the Chickahominy, and the question of supplies, had natu- 
rally brought the Army of the Potomac into the positions just 
described, for the James river was not open until the i2th, when 
the Merrimac was destroyed. 

The question was now to be decided as to the ultimate line 
of operations of the army. 



THE JAMES RIVER. 343 

Two courses were to be considered : first, to abandon the 
line of the York, cross the Chickahominy in the lower part of its 
course, gain the James, and adopt that as the line of supply ; 
second, to use the railroad from West Point to Richmond as the 
line of supply, which would oblige us to cross the Chickahominy 
somewhere north of White Oak Swamp. The army was perfectly 
placed to adopt either course. 

Masking the movement by the advanced guard, the army 
could easily have crossed the Chickahominy by Jones's bridge, 
and at Coles's ferry and Barret's ferry by pontoon bridges, while 
the advanced guard, and probably one or two corps, could have 
followed the movement by Long bridge and undercover of the 
White Oak Swamp, and the army would have been concentrated 
at Malvern Hill, ready either to advance upon Richmond by the 
roads near the left bank of the James, or to cross that river and 
place itself between Richmond and Petersburg. 

With all the aid of the gunboats and water-transportation 
I am sure that I could have occupied Petersburg and placed the 
army in position between that place and Richmond, so that the 
enemy would have been obliged to abandon his capital or to 
come out to attack in a position of my own choosing, where, 
with the whole army concentrated, success would not have 
been doubtful and Richmond would have been the prize of 
victory. 

Moreover, the water line of transportation would have insured 
the prompt and safe arrival of the ist corps, or such other rein- 
forcements as might have been sent to me. 

It is needless to state that the army was well placed to fol- 
low the second line of operations indicated. 

Up to the 1 8th my repeated and urgent demands for rein- 
forcements by water had been met in such a way as to render it 
probable that if the ist corps were ordered up to my support 
at all, the overland route would be selected by the authorities 
in Washington. Among other despatches calling for reinforce- 
ments I sent the following : 



CAMP AT CUMBERLAND, May 14, 1862. 

I have more than twice telegraphed to the Secretary of War, 
stating that, in my opinion, the enemy were concentrating all 
their available force to fight this army in front of Richmond, and 



344 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

that such ought to be their policy. I have received no reply 
whatever to any of these telegrams. I beg leave to repeat their 
substance to your excellency, and to ask that kind consideration 
which you have ever accorded to my representations and views. 
All my information from every source accessible to me estab- 
lishes the fixed purpose of the rebels to defend Richmond against 
this army by offering us battle with all the troops they can col- 
lect from east, west, and south, and my own opinion is con- 
firmed by that of all my commanders whom I have been able 
to consult. 

Casualties, sickness, garrisons, and guards have much weak- 
ened my force, and will continue to do so. I cannot bring 
into actual battle against the enemy more than 80,000 men 
at the utmost, and with them I must attack in position, probably 
entrenched, a much larger force, perhaps double my numbers. 
It is possible that Richmond may be abandoned without a serious 
struggle ; but the enemy are actually in great strength between 
here and there, and it would be unwise, and even insane, for me 
to calculate upon anything but a stubborn and desperate resist- 
ance. If they should abandon Richmond it may well be that 
it is done with the purpose of making the stand at some place in 
Virginia south or west of there, and we should be in condition 
to press them without delay. The Confederate leaders must 
employ their utmost efforts against this army in Virginia, and 
they will be supported by the whole body of their military offi- 
cers, among whom there may be said to be no Union feeling, 
as there is also very little among the higher class of citizens in 
the seceding States. 

I have found no fighting men left in this Peninsula. All are 
in the ranks of the opposing foe. 

Even if more troops than I now have should prove unneces- 
sary for purposes of military occupation, our greatest display of 
imposing force in the capital of the rebel government will have 
the best moral effect. I most respectfully and earnestly urge 
upon your excellency that the opportunity has come for striking 
a fatal blow at the enemies of the Constitution, and I beg that 
you will cause this army to be reinforced without delay by all the 
disposable troops of the government. I ask for every man that 
the War Department can send me. Sent by water they will soon 
reach me. Any commander of the reinforcements whom your 
excellency may designate will be acceptable to me, whatever 
expression I may have heretofore addressed to you on that 
subject. 

I will fight the enemy, whatever their force may be, with what- 
ever force I may have ; and I firmly believe that we shall beat 
them, but our triumph should be made decisive and complete. 
The soldiers of this army love their government, and will fight 
well in its support, You may rely upon them. They have con- 



STANTOATS FA TAL ORDER.

ficlcnce in me as their general, and in you as their President. 
Strong reinforcements will at least save the lives of many of 
them. The greater our force the more perfect will be our com- 
binations and the less our loss. 

For obvious reasons I beg you to give immediate considera- 
tion to this communication, and to inform me fully at the earliest 
moment of your final determination. 

CEO. B. McCLELLAN, 

Major- General. 
His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 

President of the United States. 



To which, on the i8th of May, I received this reply : 

"WASHINGTON, May 18, 2 P.M. 

" GENERAL : Your despatch to the President, asking rein- 
forcements, has been received and carefully considered. 

" The President is not willing to uncover the capital entirely ; 
and it is believed that, even if this were prudent, it would require 
more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the 
Rappahannock by the way of the Potomac and York river than 
by a land march. In order, therefore, to increase the strength of 
the attack upon Richmond at the earliest moment, Gen. Mc- 
Dowell has been ordered to march upon that city by the short- 
est route. 

" He is ordered, keeping himself always in position to save 
the capital from all possible attack, so to operate as to put his 
left wing in communication with your right wing, and you are 
instructed to co-operate so as to establish this communication as 
soon as possible, by extending your right wing to the north of 
Richmond. 

" It is believed that this communication can be safely estab- 
lished either north or south of the Pamunkey river. 

" In any event you will be able to prevent the main body of 
the enemy's forces from leaving Richmond and falling in over- 
whelming force upon Gen. McDowell. He will move with be- 
tween thirty-five (35) and forty thousand (40,000) men. 

" A copy of the instructions to Gen. McDowell are with this. 
The specific task assigned to his command has been to provide 
against any danger to the capital of the nation. 

" At your earnest call for reinforcements he is sent forward 
to co-operate in the reduction of Richmond, but charged, in 
attempting this, not to uncover the city of Washington, and you 
will give no order, either before or after your junction, which can 
put him out of position to cover this city. You and he will com- 
municate with each other, by telegraph or otherwise, as frequently 



346 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

as may be necessary for sufficient co-operation. When Gen. 
McDowell is in position on your right his supplies must be 
drawn from West Point, and you will instruct your staff-officers 
to be prepared to supply him by that route. 

" The President desires that Gen. McDowell retain the com- 
mand of the Department of the Rappahannock and of the forces 
with which he moves forward. 

" By order of the President. 

"EDWIN M. STANTON, 

" Secretary of War. 

" Maj.-Gen. GEO. B. MCCLELLAN." 

This order rendered it impossible for me to use the James 
river as a line of operations, forced me to establish our depots 
on the Pamunkey, and to approach Richmond from the north. 

Herein lay the failure of the campaign. 

The order obliged me to extend and expose my right in order 
to secure the junction. As it was impossible to get at Richmond 
and the enemy's army covering it without crossing the Chicka- 
hominy, I was obliged to divide the Army of the Potomac into 
two parts, separated by that stream. As the order for Gen. 
McDowell's advance was soon suspended, I incurred great risk, 
of which the enemy finally took advantage and frustrated the 
plan of campaign. 

Had Gen. McDowell joined me by water I could have 
approached Richmond by the James, and thus have avoided 
the delays and losses incurred in bridging the Chickahominy, 
and could have had the army united in one body instead of 
being necessarily divided by that stream. 

McDowell's movement by water would not have jeopardized 
Washington in the slightest degree. There were troops enough 
without him to hold the works against anything that the enemy 
could have sent against them, and the more they sent the easier 
would my task have been in front of Richmond. But Jackson's 
movement was merely a feint, and if McDowell had joined me 
on the James the enemy would have drawn in every available 
man from every quarter to make head against me. A little of 
the nerve at Washington which the Romans displayed during 
the campaign against Hannibal would have settled the fate of 
Richmond in very few weeks. 

The following telegram was received at headquarters, Army 
of the Potomac, May 24, 1862 : 



MCDOWELL COMING. 



" HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF RAPPAHANNOCK, 

OPPOSITE FRKDKRICKSBURG, May 22, 1862. 

" Maj.-Gcn. G. B. McClcllan: 

" I have received the orders of the President to move with 
the army under my command and co-operate with yours in the 
reduction of Richmond, and also a copy of his instructions to 
you in relation to that co-operation. Maj.-Gen. Shields will join 
me to-day. 

" As far (soon) as the necessary preparations for the march 
can be completed, which I think will be by the twenty-fourth 
(24th) inst., we shall set forth as (in) the general direction 
ordered. There is in front of us to impede our advance the 
secession Army of the Rappahannock, so called, under the com- 
mand of Joseph R. Anderson, of the Tredegar Iron-: Works. 

" His force is from 12,000 to 15,000 men, mostly South 
Carolina and Georgia troops. We shall engage this force on 
our first day's march, as they are within from six to eight 
miles of us, posted on and to the right and left of the Frede- 
ricksburg and Richmond Railroad, and in a position of con- 
siderable strength. It is my purpose to try and turn this posi- 
tion by throwing a force on their left flank, and cut off their 
opportunity of receiving any reinforcements from the direction 
of Gordonsville, and at the same time endeavor to save the rail- 
road bridges. If this can be done another channel of supply 
can be had for the forces going against Richmond that cannot 
fail to give great relief to the quartermaster's and commissary 
departments of your army, and thus facilitate your operations. 
We cannot rely on this at first, because they now occupy the 
line, and, I am told, are prepared to destroy the bridges if they 
are forced to fall back. I beg to ask to what extent can I rely 
on co-operation from you in my present movement in the way 
of your cutting off the retreat of the enemy upon Richmond, 
where they would add 12,000 to the forces against you, and 
in saving the railroad bridge across the Pamunkey, and to what 
point on the Pamunkey can you extend your right to join me, and 
to what point can you cause supplies to be placed for my com- 
mand, and by what date can I count on finding them ready for 
me? I shall require subsistence for thirty-eight thousand (38,000) 
men, and forage for eleven thousand (11,000) animals. 

" IRWIN MCDOWELL, 

11 Maj.-Gen" 

The following is a copy of the instructions to Gen. McDowell: 

" WAR DEPARTMENT,

you will move upon Richmond by the general route of the Rich- 
mond and Fredericksburg Railroad, co-operating with the forces 
under Gen. McClellan, now threatening Richmond from the line 
of the Pamunkey and York rivers. 

"While seeking to establish as soon as possible a commu- 
nication between your left wing and the right wing of Gen. 
McClellan, you will hold yourself always in such position as to 
cover the capital of the nation against a sudden dash of any 
large body of the rebel forces. 

" Gen. McClellan will be furnished with a copy of these 
instructions, and will be directed to hold himself in readiness 
to establish communication with your left wing, and to prevent 
the main body of the enemy's army from leaving Richmond and 
throwing itself upon your column before a junction of the two 
armies is effected. 

" A copy of his instructions in regard to the employment of 
your force is annexed. 

" By order of the President. 

" EDWIN M. STANTON, 

" Secretary of War. 

" Gen. MCDOWELL, 

" Commanding Department of Rappahannock" 

Having some doubts, from the wording of the foregoing 
orders, as to the extent of my authority over the troops of Gen. 
McDowell, and as to the time when I might anticipate his 
arrival, on the 2ist of May I sent this despatch to President 
Lincoln : 

MAY 21, 1862, n P.M. 

Your despatch of yesterday respecting our situation and the 
batteries of Fort Darling was received while I was absent with 
the advance, where I have been all this day. I have communi- 
cated personally with Capt. Goldsborough, and by letter with 
Capt. Smith. The vessels can do nothing without co-operation 
on land, which I will not be in condition to afford for several days. 
Circumstances must determine the propriety of a land-attack. 

It rained again last night, and rain on this soil soon makes 
the roads incredibly bad for army transportation. I personally 
crossed the Chickahominy to-day at Bottom's bridge ford, and 
went a mile beyond, the enemy being about half a mile in front. 
I have three regiments on the other bank guarding the rebuild- 
ing of the bridge. Reyes's corps is on the New Kent road, 
near Bottom's bridge. Heintzelman is on the same road, within 
supporting distance. Sumner is on the railroad, connecting right 
with left. Stoneman, with advanced guard, is within one mile of 
New bridge. Franklin, with two divisions, is about two miles 






MCDOWELLS CORPS COMING. 349 

this side of Stoneman. Porter's division, with the reserves of 
infantry and artillery, is within supporting distance. Head- 
quarters will probably be at Cold Harbor to-morrow, one mile 
this side of Franklin. All the bridges over the Chickahominy 
are destroyed. The enemy are in force on every road leading to 
Richmond, within a mile or two west of the stream. Their main 
body is on the road from New bridge, encamped along it for 
four or five miles, spreading over the open ground on both sides. 
Johnson's headquarters are about two miles beyond the bridge. 

All accounts report their numbers as greatly exceeding our 
own. The position of the rebel forces, the declaration of the 
Confederate authorities, the resolutions of the Virginia legisla- 
ture, the action of the city government, the conduct of the citi- 
zens, and all other sources of information accessible to me, give 
positive assurance that our approach to Richmond involves a 
desperate battle between the opposing armies. 

All our divisions are moving towards the foe. I shall acj- 
vance steadily and carefully, and attack them according to my 
best judgment, and in such manner as to employ my greatest 
force. 

I regret the state of things as to Gen. McDowell's command. 
We must beat the enemy in front of Richmond. One division 
added to this army for that effort would do more to protect 
Washington than his whole force can possibly do anywhere else 
in the field. The rebels are concentrating from all points for 
the two battles at Richmond and Corinth. I would still, most 
respectfully, suggest the policy of our concentrating here by 
movements on water. I have heard nothing as to the proba- 
bilities of the contemplated junction of McDowell's force with 
mine. I have no idea when he can start, what are his means 
of transportation, or when he may be expected to reach this 
vicinity. I fear there is little hope that he can join me over- 
land in time for the coming battle. Delays on my part will be 
dangerous. I fear sickness and demoralization. This region is 
unhealthy for Northern men, and, unless kept moving, I fear that 
our soldiers may become discouraged. At present our numbers 
are weakening from disease, but our men remain in good heart. 

I regret also the configuration of the Department of the Rap- 
pahannock. It includes a portion even of the city of Richmond. 
I think that my own department should embrace the entire field 
of military operations designed for the capture and occupation of 
that city. 

Again, I agree with your excellency that one bad general is 
better than two good ones. 

I am not sure that I fully comprehend your orders of the 
i yth instant addressed to myself and Gen. McDowell. If a 
junction is effected before we occupy Richmond it must neces- 
sarily be east of the railroad to Fredericksburg and within my 



350 MCCLELLAND s OWN- sroxv. 

department. This fact, my superior rank, and the express lan- 
guage of the sixty-second Article of War will place his command 
under my orders, unless it is otherwise specially directed by your 
excellency ; and I consider that he will be under my command, 
except that I am not to detach any portion of his forces, or give 
any orders which can put him out of position to cover Washing- 
ton. If I err in my construction I desire to be at once set right. 
Frankness compels me to say, anxious as I am for an increase of 
force, that the march of McDowell's column upon Richmond by 
the shortest route will, in my opinion, uncover Washington, as to 
any interposition by it, as completely as its movement by water. 
The enemy cannot advance by Fredericksburg on Washington. 

Should they attempt a movement which to me seems utterly 
improbable, their route would be by Gordonsville and Manassas. 
I desire that the extent of my authority over McDowell may be 
clearly defined, lest misunderstandings and conflicting views may 
produce some of those injurious results which a divided com- 
mand has so often caused. I would respectfully suggest that 
this danger can only be surely guarded against by explicitly 
placing Gen. McDowell under my orders in the ordinary way, 
and holding me strictly responsible for the closest observance 
of your instructions. I hope, Mr. President, that it is not neces- 
sary for me to assure you that your instructions would be ob- 
served in the utmost good faith, and that I have no personal 
feelings which could influence me to disregard them in any par- 
ticular. 

I believe that there is a great struggle before this army, but 
I am neither dismayed nor discouraged. I wish to strengthen its 
force as much as I can, but in any event I shall fight it with all 
the skill, caution, and determination that I possess, and I trust 
that the result may either obtain for me the permanent con- 
fidence of my government or that it may close my career. 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 
His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 

President of the United States. 

On the 24th I received the following reply : 

" MAY 24, 1862 (from Washington, 24th). 
" I left Gen. McDowell's camp at dark last evening. Shields's 
command is there, but it is so worn that he cannot move before 
Monday morning, the twenty-sixth (26th). We have so thinned 
our line to get troops for other places that it was broken yester- 
day at Front Royal, with a probable loss to us of one (i) regi- 
ment infantry, two (2) companies cavalry, putting Gen. Banks in 
some peril. 



NOT COMING. 351 

u The enemy's forces, under Gen. Anderson, now opposing 
Gen. McDowell's advance have, as their line of supply and 
retreat, the road to Richmond. 

" If, in conjunction with McDowell's movement against An- 
derson, you could send a force from your right to cut off the 
enemy's supplies from Richmond, preserve the railroad bridges 
across the two (2) forks of the Pamunkey, and intercept the 
enemy's retreat, you will prevent the army now opposed to you 
from receiving an accession of numbers of nearly fifteen thou- 
sand (15,000) men ; and if you succeed in saving the bridges 
you will secure a line of railroad for supplies in addition to the 
one you now have. Can you not do this almost as well as not 
while you are building the Chickahominy bridges ? McDowell 
and Shields both say they can, and positively will, move Monday 
morning. / wish you to move cautiously and safely. 

" You will have command of McDowell, after he joins you, 
precisely as you indicated in your long despatch to us of the 
twenty-first (2ist). 

" A. LINCOLN, 

"President." 

This information, that McDowell's corps would march for 
Fredericksburg on the following Monday (the 26th), and that 
he would be under my command, as indicated in my telegram 
of the 2ist, was cheering news, and I now felt confident that we 
would on his arrival be sufficiently strong to overpower the large 
army confronting us. 

At a later hour on the same day I received the following : 

" MAY 24, 1862 (from Washington, 4 P.M.) 
" In consequence of Gen. Banks's critical position I have 
been compelled to suspend Gen. McDowell's movements to join 
you. The enemy are making a desperate push upon Harper's 
Ferry, and we are trying to throw Gen. Fremont's force and 
part of Gen. McDowell's in their rear. 

"A. LINCOLN, 

"President" 
" Maj.-Gen. GEO. B. MCCLELLAN." 

From which it will be seen that I could not expect Gen. 
McDowell to join me in time to participate in immediate opera- 
tions in front of Richmond, and on the same evening I replied to 
the President that I would make my calculations accordingly. 



CHAPTER XXI. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[May 6 to May 18, 1862.] 

Williamsburg, May 6, 1862. I telegraphed you this morn- 
ing that we had gained a battle. Every hour its importance is 
proved to be greater. On Sunday I sent Stoneman in pursuit 
with the cavalry and four batteries of horse-artillery. He was 
supported by the divisions of Hooker, Smith, Couch, Casey, and 
Kearny, most of which arrived on the ground only yesterday. 
Unfortunately I did not go with the advance myself, being 
obliged to remain to get Franklin and Sedgwick started up the 
river for West Point. Yesterday I received pressing private mes- 
sages from Smith and others begging me to go to the front. I 
started with half a dozen aides and some fifteen orderlies, and 
found things in a bad state. Hancock was engaged with a vastly 
inferior force some two miles from any support. Hooker fought 
nearly all day without assistance, and the mass of the troops were 
crowded together where they were useless. I found everybody 
discouraged, officers and men ; our troops in wrong positions, 
on the wrong side of the woods ; no system, no co-operation, 
no orders given, roads blocked up. As soon as I came upon 
the field the men cheered like fiends, and I saw at once that 
I could save the day. I immediately reinforced Hancock and 
arranged to support Hooker, advanced the whole line across 
the woods, filled up the gaps, and got everything in hand for 
whatever might occur. The result was that the enemy saw that 
he was gone if he remained in his position, and scampered during 
the night. His works were very strong, but his loss was very 
heavy. The roads are in such condition that it is impossible to 
pursue except with a few cavalry. It is with the utmost difficulty 
that I can feed the men, many of whom have had nothing to eat 
for twenty-four hours and more. I had no dinner yesterday, no 
supper ; a cracker for breakfast, and no dinner yet, I have no 
baggage ; was out in the rain all day and until late at night ; slept 

352 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 353 

in my clothes and boots, and could not even wash my face and 
hands. I, however, expect my ambulance up pretty soon, when I 
hope for better things. I have been through the hospitals, where 
are many of our own men and of the rebels. One Virginian sent 
for me this morning and told me that I was the only general from 
whom they expected any humanity. I corrected this mistake. 
This is a beautiful little town ; several very old houses and 
churches, pretty gardens. I have taken possession of a very 
fine house which Joe Johnston occupied as his headquarters. 
It has a lovely flower-garden and conservatory. If you were 
here I should be much inclined to spend some weeks here. G. W. 
was one of the whipped community, also Joe Johnston, Cadmus 
Wilcox, A. P. Hill, D. H. Hill, Longstreet, Jeb Stuart, Early 
(badly wounded) ; and many others that we know. We have all 
their wounded ; eight guns so far. In short, we have given them 
a tremendous thrashing, and I am not at all ashamed of the con- 
duct of the Army of the Potomac. 

Telegram Williamsburg, May 6, 1862, n P.M. The battle 
of Williamsburg has proved a brilliant victory. None of your 
friends injured, though our loss considerable. That of the ene- 
my severe. The Quaker army is doing very well. Hancock 
was superb yesterday. 

Williamsburg, May 6, midnight. . . . Am very tired ; had 
but little sleep last night, and have not had my clothes off ; 
besides, was pretty well wet last night. I have not a particle of 
baggage with me ; nothing but a buffalo-robe and horse-blanket, 
not even a hair-brush or tooth-brush. . . . 



Monday, i P.M. (8//). ... I hope to get Smith's division 
off this afternoon, followed by others in the morning. Stoneman 
is some fifteen miles in advance, and will, I hope, communicate 
with Franklin to-night, although I am not yet sure that the enemy 
may not still be between the two. I shall start to-morrow morn- 
ing and overtake Smith. I have ordered up headquarters and 
the accompanying paraphernalia at once, so I hope to get within 
a few miles of my tooth-brush in a day or two. It is not very 
pleasant, this going entirely without baggage, but it could not be 
helped. I find that the results of my operations are beginning to 



354 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

be apparent. The rebels are evacuating Norfolk, I learn. Your 
two letters of Sunday and Monday reached me last night. It 
would have been easy for me to have sacrificed 10,000 lives in 
taking Yorktown, and I presume the world would have thought 
it more brilliant. I am content with what I have done. TJie 
battle of Williamsburg was more bloody. Had I reached the field 
three hours earlier I could have gained far greater results and 
have saved a thousand lives. It is, perhaps, well as it is, for 
officers and men feel that I saved the day. . . . 

I don't know where the next battle will occur; I presume 
on the line of the Chickahominy, or it may be to-morrow in 
effecting a junction with Franklin. It may suit the views of 
the masses better, as being more bloody. / hope not, and will 
make it as little so as possible. . . . 

Williamsburg, May 9, 2 P.M. ... I have moved four 
divisions already. The reserves have arrived. My wagons 
have arrived, and in an hour or two I will move myself. . . . 
I rather think that we have a very severe battle to fight before 
reaching Richmond, but the men are just in the humor for it. 
. . . Carpet-bag has at last arrived. 

Camp No. i, May 9, 8.30 P.M. We are fairly started on the 
march again ; my camp is only about four miles from Williams- 
burg. The road was so much blocked up with wagons that I did 
not start till late. Smith, Couch, Casey, and Kearny are all in 
front of me, the regulars close by. To-morrow headquarters 
start at five A.M., and will pass all but Smith, encamping with or 
just in rear of him. I hope to see Franklin to-morrow night and 
learn more of the enemy. . . . The secesh prisoners strongly 
protested against being obliged to remove the torpedoes at York- 
town, but without avail, for they had to do it. I think they may 
be more careful next time. I heard this afternoon from Stone- 
man that they (secesh) had murdered some of our men after they 
were taken prisoners. I have given orders to hold all their people 
we have responsible for it. If it is confirmed to-morrow I will 
send a flag to Joe Johnston and quietly inform him that I will 
hang two of his officers for every one of our men thus murdered ; 
and I will carry the threat into execution. I will pay them in 
their own coin, if they wish to carry on war in that manner. I 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 355 

hope there is some mistake about the murders, for I do not wish 
to make reprisals. It is a sad business at best. . . . 

May 10, Saturday ', 11.45 P.M., camp 19 miles from Wil- 
liamsburg. . . . Am encamped now at an old wooden church, 
and am in easy communication with Franklin, Porter, etc. Fitz 
came over to see me this afternoon, and I go over to see him and 
Franklin to-morrow. To-morrow being Sunday, I give the men 
a rest, merely closing up some of the troops in rear. I begin to 
find some Union sentiment in this country. ... I expect to fight 
a very severe battle on the Chickahominy, but feel no doubt as 
to the result. I saw the effect of my presence the other day in 
front of Williamsburg. The men behaved superbly, and will do 
better, if possible, next time. To-morrow I will get up supplies, 
reorganize, arrange details, and get ready for the great fight, feel- 
ing that I shall lose nothing by respecting Sunday as far as I can. 1 
Secesh is gathering all he can in front of me. So much the bet- 
ter. I have implicit confidence in my men, and they have in me. 
What more can I ask? . . . 

Sunday, 8 A.M. (same letter as last]. ... As I told you last 
night, I am giving my men some rest to-day. They need it 
much, for they have for some time been living on long marches, 
short rations, and rainy bivouacs. . . . M'y cavalry were within 
six miles of the upper Chickahominy yesterday. Norfolk is in 
our possession, the result of my movements. . . . 

May 12, Monday P.M. (same letter). . . . While I write the 
2d Dragoons' band is serenading, and about fifty others are play- 
ing tattoo at various distances a grand sound in this lovely 
moonlight night. My camp is at an old frame church in a grove. 
I differ from most of the generals in preferring a tent to a house. 
I hope not to sleep in a house again until I see you. . . . Are 
you satisfied now with my bloodless victories ? Even the Aboli- 
tionists seem to be coming round ; judging, at least, from the very 
handsome resolutions offered by Mr. Lovejoy in the 'House. I 
look upon that resolution as one of the most complimentary 
I know of, and that, too, offered by my bitterest persecutors. 
But the union of civic merit with military success is what pleases 
me most ; to have it recognized that I have saved the lives of my 



356 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

men and won success by my own efforts is to me the height of 
glory. I hope that the result in front of Richmond will cause 
still greater satisfaction to the country. I still hope that the 
God who has been so good to me will continue to smile upon our 
cause, and enable me to bring this war to a speedy close, so that 
I may at last have the rest I want so much. ... I do need rest. 
You know I have had but little in my life. But the will of God 
be done ! What is given me to do I will try to do with all my 
might. ... I think one more battle here will finish the work. I 
expect a great one, but feel that confidence in my men and that 
trust in God which makes me very sanguine as to the result. 
They will fight me in front of Richmond, I am confident. Defeat 
there is certain destruction to them, and I think will prove the 
ruin of their wretched cause. They are concentrating everything 
for the last death-struggle. My government, alas! is not giving 
me any aid. But I will do the best I can with what I have, and 
trust to God's mercy and the courage of my men for the result. 
. . . We march in the morning to Cumberland, gradually draw- 
ing nearer to Richmond. 

May 15, Cumberland, 2.30 P.M. Another wet, horrid day ! It 
rained a little yesterday morning, more in the afternoon, much 
during the night, and has been amusing itself in the same manner 
very persistently all day. I had expected to move headquarters 
to White House to-day ; but this weather has put the roads in 
such condition that I cannot do more than get Franklin and Por- 
ter there to-day. Headquarters cavalry and Hunt will move 
there to-morrow ; perhaps one or two other divisions as well. 
We had quite a visitation yesterday in the shape of Secretary 
Seward, Gideon Welles, Mr. Bates, F. Seward, Dahlgren, Mrs. 
Goldsborough and one of her daughters, Mrs. F. Seward, and 
some other ladies whose names I did not catch. I went on 
board their boat ; then had some ambulances harnessed up and 
took them around camps. We are just about twenty-five miles 
from Richmond here, the advance considerably nearer. I don't 
yet know what to make of the rebels. I do not see how they can 
possibly abandon Virginia and Richmond without a battle ; nor 
do I understand why they abandoned and destroyed Norfolk and 
the Merrimac, unless they also intended to abandon all of Vir- 
ginia. There is a puzzle there somewhere which will soon be 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 357 

solved. ... I am heartily tired of this life I am leading always 
some little absurd thing being done by those gentry in Washing- 
ton. I am every day more and more tired of public life, and 
earnestly pray that I may soon be able to throw down my sword 
and live once more as a private gentleman. ... I confess I find 
it difficult to judge whether the war will soon be at an end or 
not. I think that the blows the rebels are now receiving and 
have lately received ought to break them up ; but one can do 
no more than speculate. Yes, I can imagine peace and quietness 
reigning once more in this land of ours. It is just that I am 
fighting for ! . . . Still raining hard and dismally ; an awful time 
for the men ; the only comfort is that they all have plenty to 
eat. 

9 P.M. (same day). . . . Have received to-day the official 
copy of the resolutions of the House. I learn that the Aboli- 
tionists begin to think that I am not such a wretch after all, or 
else that it is best to say so. 

It was all a humbug about my being struck by a piece of a 
shell at Williamsburg. That reminds me of a joke some of the 
youngsters played upon - - at Yorktown. They sent him to 
see an immense " shell " that had fallen in our headquarters 
camp. He found a large 0)tf/ir-shell. . . . 

I send you a photograph which I have just received from 
Gen. Blume, chief of artillery in the Prussian army. I knew him 
abroad, and the old gentleman writes to me occasionally. 

Telegram May 16, 1862, White House. Have just arrived 
over horrid roads. No further movement possible until they 
improve. This house is where Washington's courtship took 
place and where he resided when first married. I do not per* 
mit it to be occupied by any one, nor the grounds around. It is 
a beautiful spot directly on the banks of the Pamunkey. All well 
and in fine spirits. Hope to get our baggage up by water, other- 
wise will fare badly to-night. 

May 1 6, 11.30 P.M., White House. ... I rode over a horrid 
road to this place this morning ; spent some time at Washington's 
house, or at least his wife's, and afterwards rode to the front, vis- 
iting in the course of my ride the old church (St. Peter's) where 
he was married. It is an old brick church with a rather preten- 



358 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

tious tower, more remarkable for its situation than for anything 
else The situation is very fine, on a commanding hill. A tab- 
let in the interior records the death of some one in 1690. As 
I happened to be there alone for a few moments, I could not 
help kneeling at the chancel and praying that I might serve my 
country as truly as he did. . . . 

May 17, 8.30 A.M. (same letter). . . . We have a change in 
the weather. It is clear and very hot, so I presume the roads 
will improve much to-day. I am pushing on the advanced 
guard and reconnoissances in various directions. We gain 
some ground every day ; but our progress has been slow on 
account of the execrable nature of the roads, as well as their 
extreme narrowness and fewness in number, making it a very 
difficult matter to move large masses of men with any rapidity 
or convenience. I expect to have our advanced parties near 
enough to Bottom's bridge to-day to ascertain whether the 
enemy is there in much force or not, and by to-morrow or next 
day to obtain similar information about the other bridges all of 
which, by the bye, are burned, I believe. But the river is ford- 
able, so the difficulty is not insuperable by any means. It is very 
difficult to divine whether secesh will fight a great battle in front 
of Richmond or not ; I still think they ought to, but there are 
some circumstances which look somewhat as if they would evacu- 
ate. Time only will show, and the trial cannot be long deferred. 
I am very sorry that we could not have advanced more rapidly ; 
my only consolation is that it has been impossible. Just think 
of its requiring forty-eight hours to move two divisions with 
their trains five miles! Nothing could be much worse than that. 
The fastest way to move is never to move in wet weather. 

Midnight. ... I am now at this present moment involved 
in a great many different orders for parties to move out at day- 
break on reconnoissances. . . . 

May 18, Sunday, 6 P.M., White House. . . . We leave here 
in the morning. Porter and Franklin march at four and eight 
A.M., headquarters at seven. We will go to Tunstall's, or per- 
haps a little beyond it, and will now soon close up on the Chicka- 
hominy and find out what secesh is doing. I think he will fight 
us there, or between that and Richmond ; and if he is badly

thrashed (as I trust he will be), incline to believe that he will 
begin to cry peccavi and say that he has enough of it, especially 
if Halleck beats him at Corinth. . . . 

Midnight {same letter], ... I start early in the morning. 
. . Those hounds in Washington are after me again. 



CHAPTER XXII. 

White House The Chickahominy river Bridges Battle of Hanovet 
Court-House Porter's victory Neglect at Washington McDowell's 
retention useless. 

WHITE HOUSE was a very fine plantation belonging to Mrs. 
Gen. Lee. It was the residence of Mrs. Custis when she was 
married to Washington. The ceremony took place in St. Peter's 
Church, a lonely old building beautifully placed on a command- 
ing hill. I observed within it a tablet commemorating a death 
which took place in 1690. Finding one's self alone within that 
historic building, it was a natural impulse to invoke the aid of 
God to enable me to serve the country as unselfishly and truly 
as did the great man who had often worshipped there. 

The residence at White House was not the original building 
of the time of Washington that had been destroyed by fire ; but 
the existing one was constructed on the same foundations. 

I neither occupied it myself nor permitted any others to do 
so, but placed a guard to preserve it. For this natural act of 
respect for the memory of the greatest man our country has pro- 
duced I was most violently attacked and maligned by the ex- 
treme radicals. I am willing that posterity shall judge between 
them and myself. 

On the i pth headquarters and the 5th and 6th corps ad- 
vanced to Tunstall's Station, six miles from White House. The 
rain recommenced on this day, and through it I rode to Bot- 
tom's bridge and made a short reconnoissance. The enemy were 
there, but not in great force. The advanced guard was near 
New bridge. 

The camp at Tunstall's was the most beautiful we occupied 
during the campaign. Headquarters were on the summit of a 
hill, commanding a superb view in all directions The country 
was highly cultivated, being covered with fine plantations. To- 
wards Richmond large masses of troops were bivouacked, while 
towards the Pamunkey there were no signs of an army. The 
contrast between war and peace was vivid and most impressive. 

360 



WHITE HOUSE. 361 

At night when the countless bivouac-fires were lighted the scene 
was grand and brilliant beyond descripiion. But he must have 
been devoid of feeling who could regard this magnificent spec- 
tacle without a sentiment of most sincere regret that human mad- 
ness and folly should have made it necessary to march armies 
through this fair and peaceful land. The Army of the Poto- 
mac was mainly composed of good men, who took up arms from 
the noblest motives ; and I doubt whether any troops ever did so 
little needless damage in a hostile country. But at best a large

army leaves a wide -swath in its rear, and cannot move without 
leaving the marks of its passage. 

On the 2oth it again rained heavily. On the evening of the 
2ist the army was posted as follows : 

The advanced guard within a mile of New bridge ; the 6th 
corps three miles from New bridge, with the 5th corps at 
supporting distance in its rear ; the 2d corps on the railway, 
about three miles from the Chickahominy, connecting the right 



362 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

with the left ; the 4th corps on the New Kent road, near Bot- 
tom's bridge, having three regiments across the stream cover- 
ing the rebuilding of the bridge ; the 3d corps within easy sup- 
porting distance of the 4th corps. 

On the 22d headquarters were advanced to Cold Harbor, and 
on the 26th the railway was in operation as far as the Chicka- 
hominy, and the railway bridge across the stream nearly com- 
pleted. 

The Chickahominy river rises some fifteen miles to the north- 
ward of Richmond, and unites with the James about forty miles 
below that city. Our operations embraced the part of the river 
between Meadow's and Bottom's bridges, covering the approaches 
to Richmond from the east. In this vicinity the river, in its 
ordinary stage, is about forty feet wide, fringed with a dense 
growth of heavy forest trees, and bordered by low, marshy bot- 
tom-lands varying from half a mile to a mile in width. 

Within the limits above-mentioned the firm ground lying 
above high-water mark seldom approaches the river on either 
bank, and no place was found, within this section, where the 
high ground came near the stream on both banks. 

It was subject to frequent, sudden, and great variations in the 
volume of water, and a single violent rain-storm of brief dura- 
tion would cause a rise of water which overflowed the bottom- 
lands on both sides, and for many days made the river absolutely 
impassable without bridges. 

When our light troops approached the river on the 2oth of 
May it was found that all the bridges had been destroyed by 
the enemy on our approach, except that at Mechanicsville, and 
it became necessary not only to rebuild the old bridges, but 
also to construct several additional ones. The west bank of 
the river, opposite New, Mechanicsville, and Meadow bridges, 
was bordered by high bluffs, which afforded the enemy com- 
manding positions on which to establish his batteries, to enfilade 
the approaches by the principal roads leading to Richmond on 
our right, and to prevent the reconstruction of these impor- 
tant bridges. We were thus obliged to select other less ex- 
posed points for our crossings. 

Had the ist corps effected its promised junction we might 
have turned the head-waters of the Chickahominy and attacked 
Richmond from the north and northwest, while we preserved our 



MCDOWELL EXPECTED. 363 

line of supply from West Point ; but with the force actually at 
my disposal such an attempt would simply have exposed the 
Army of the Potomac to destruction in detail, and the total loss 
of its communications. It is hardly necessary to say that the 
country in which we operated could supply nothing for the wants 
of the army, and that were our communications with the depots 
cut and held by the enemy nothing but starvation awaited us. 

When we arrived opposite Bottom's bridge on the 2oth the 
enemy was there in only small force, and, as it was of the utmost 
importance to secure a lodgment on the right bank before he 
could concentrate his forces and resist the passage of the stream, 
I ordered Casey's division of the 4th corps to ford the river at 
once and occupy the heights on the further bank. This was 
promptly done, and reconnoissances were immediately pushed 
forward, while instant steps were taken to rebuild the bridge. 
The troops were directed to throw up defences to secure our 
left flank, and the 3d corps was moved up in support. 

Meanwhile our centre and right were advanced to the river, 
and on the 24th Mechanicsville was carried, the enemy being 
driven out by our artillery and forced across the bridge, which 
they destroyed. Gen. Naglee, of Casey's division of the 4th 
corps, on the same day dislodged a force of the enemy from the 
vicinity of Seven Pines, and the advance of our left secured a 
strong position near that place. All the information obtained 
from negroes, deserters, prisoners, and spies indicated that the 
enemy occupied in force all the approaches to Richmond from 
the east, and that he intended to dispute every step of our 
advance beyond the Chickahominy on our left, and to resist the 
passage of the stream opposite our right. That their army was 
superior to ours in numbers seemed certain. Strong entrench- 
ments had been constructed around the city. Up to this time I 
had every reason to expect that McDowell would commence his 
march from Fredericksburg on the morning of the 26th, and it 
was only during the evening of the 24th that I received from 
the President the telegram, already given, announcing the sus- 
pension of his movement. 

So far, then, as immediate operations were concerned, it only 
remained for me to make the best use of the forces at my dis- 
posal, and to avail myself of all possible artificial auxiliaries, to 
compensate as far as possible for the inadequacy of numbers. 



364 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

I concurred fully with the President in his injunction, contained 
in his telegram of the 24th, that it was necessary, with my limited 
force, to move "cautiously and safely." 

In view of the peculiar character of the Chickahoininy, and 
the liability to sudden inundations, it became necessary to con- 
struct eleven bridges, all long and difficult, with extensive log- 
way approaches, and often built under fire. 

It will be remembered that the order for the co-operation of 
McDowell was only suspended, not revoked ; and, therefore, I 
could not abandon the northern approach and my communica- 
tions with West Point. To cover these communications, and be 
prepared to effect the junction with the ist corps when it ad- 
vanced, it was necessary to retain a portion of the army on the 
left bank of the Chickahominy, and I could not make any serious 
movement with the forces on the right bank until the commu- 
nications between the two parts of the army were firmly and 
securely established by strong and sufficiently numerous bridges. 

As the entrenchments around Richmond were strong and 
heavily garrisoned, it would have been an act of madness and 
folly had I temporarily abandoned my communications and 
thrown the entire army across the stream, trusting to the chan- 
ces of carrying the place by assault before the troops had ex- 
hausted the supplies carried with them. 

I was not responsible for the fact that I was obliged to select 
a faulty and dangerous plan as the least objectionable of those 
from which I could choose. 

On the 24th a very spirited and successful reconnoissance 
took place near New bridge, which first brought Lieut, (after- 
wards Gen.) Custer to my notice. His commanding officers 
commended him highly for his conduct, and I sent for him to 
thank him. He was then a slim, long-haired boy, carelessly 
dressed. I thanked him for his gallantry, and asked what 
I could do for him. He replied very modestly that he had 
nothing to ask, and evidently did not suppose that he had done 
anything to deserve extraordinary reward. I then asked if he 
would like to serve on my personal staff as an aide-de-camp. 
Upon this he brightened up, and assured me that he would re- 
gard such service as the most gratifying he could perform ; and 
I at once gave the necessary orders. He continued on my staff 
until I was relieved from the command. 



GEN. CUSTER. 365 

In those days Custer was simply a reckless, gallant boy, unde- 
terred by fatigue, unconscious of fear ; but his head was always 
clear in danger, and he always brought me clear and intelligible 
reports of what he saw when under the heaviest fire. I became 
much attached to him. In the later days of the war, when he 
commanded cavalry troops, he displayed a degree of prudence 
and good sense, in conducting the most dangerous expeditions, 
that surprised many who thought they knew him well. 

In the battle of the Rosebud, against the Sioux, where he lost 
his life and the whole of his immediate command was destroyed^ 
no one survived to tell the story of the disaster. On that fatal 
day he simply repeated the tactics that he had so often success- 
fully used against large bodies of Indians ; and it is probable 
that he was deceived as to the strength and fighting capacity 
of his opponents, and that, from his want of knowledge of the 
details of the ground where the tragedy occurred, he was sud- 
denly surrounded by overwhelming masses of well-armed war- 
riors, against whom the heroic efforts of his command wasted 
themselves in vain. 

Those who accused him of reckless rashness would, perhaps, 
have been the first to accuse him of timidity if he had not at- 
tacked, and thus allowed the enemy to escape unhurt. He died 
as he had lived, a gallant soldier ; and his whole career was such 
as to force me to believe that he had good reasons for acting as 
he did. 

With the exception of the 25th, it rained heavily every day 
from the 22d to the battle of Fair Oaks, and during the day and 
night of the 3oth an unusually violent storm occurred, accom- 
panied by torrents of rain. The valley of the Chickahominy was 
flooded more than ever ; all work on the bridges was suspended, 
and they became well-nigh impracticable. 

The enemy seized the occasion and determined to attack the 
part of the army that had crossed the Chickahominy, when it 
would be very difficult or impossible to support it. Exposure 
and fatigue had brought upon me a violent attack of illness, 
which confined me to my bed on the 3oth and the morning of 
the 3 1 st. I left my bed to go to the field of battle as soon as 
I was satisfied of the importance of the crisis. Two corps, the 
3d and the 4th, were across the Chickahominy, three on the 
left bank. 



366 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

The 4th corps was in position near Fair Oaks and Seven 
Pines. Kearny's division of the 3d corps was on and near 
the railroad in advance of Savage's Station. Hooker's division 
was on the left, near White Oak Swamp. The 2d corps was on 
the left bank of the Chickahominy, at and near the Grapevine 
bridge, in position to support either wing of the army. 

The 5th and the 6th corps were also on the left bank, be- 
tween Mechanicsville and New bridge. 

Having been informed late on the 24th that McDowell's 
advance was suspended, I caused work upon the bridges to be 
commenced immediately and pushed forward with the greatest 
vigor ; but heavy rains continued to fall from day to day, which 
flooded the valley and raised the water to a greater height than 
had been known for twenty years. 

The bridges first made, together with their approaches, which 
were not arranged for such unprecedented high water, were car- 
ried away or rendered impassable. It thus became necessary, 
with immense labor, to build others much larger, more elevated 
and 'Stable. Our men worked in the water, exposed to the fire 
of the enemy from the opposite bank. 

On the 25th of May I received the following telegram : 

" Your despatch received. Gen. Banks was at Strasburg with 
about six thousand (6,000) men, Shields having been taken from 
him to swell a column for McDowell to aid you at Richmond, 
and the rest of his force scattered at various places. On the 
23d a rebel force of from 7,000 to 10,000 fell upon one regi- 
ment and two companies guarding the bridge at Front Royal, 
destroying it entirely ; crossed the Shenandoah, and on the 24th 
yesterday pushed on to get north of Banks on the road to 
Winchester. Gen. Banks ran a race with them, beating them into 
Winchester yesterday evening. This morning a battle ensued 
between the two forces, in which Gen. Banks was beaten back 
into full retreat towards Martinsburg, and probably is broken 
up into a total rout. Geary, on the Manassas Gap Railroad, 
just now reports that Jackson is now near Front Royal with 
10,000 troops, following up and supporting, as I understand, the 
force now pursuing Banks. Also, that another force of 10,000 
is near Orleans, following on in the same direction. Stripped 
bare, as we are here, I will do all we can to prevent them cross- 
ing the Potomac at Harper's Ferry or above. McDowell has 
about 20,000 of his forces moving back to the vicinity of Front 
Royal, and Fremont, who was at Franklin, is moving to Har- 
risonburg ; both these movements intended to get in the ene- 
.ny's rear. 



SCARE AT WASHINGTON. 367 

"One more of McDowell's brigades is ordered through here 
to Harper's Ferry ; the rest of his forces remain for the present 
at Fredericksburg. We are sending such regiments and dribs 
from here and Baltimore as we can spare to Harper's Ferry, 
supplying their places in some sort, calling in militia from the 
adjacent States. We also have eighteen cannon on the road 
to Harper's Ferry, of which arm there is not a single one at 
that point. This is now our situation. 

" If McDowell's force was now beyond our reach we should 
be entirely helpless. Apprehensions of something like this, and 
no unwillingness to sustain you, has always been my reason for 
withholding McDowell's forces from you. 

" Please understand this, and do the best you can with the 
forces you have. 

" A. LINCOLN, 

" President:' 

On the 25th the following was also received : 

" The enemy is moving north in sufficient force to drive 
Gen. Banks before him ; precisely in what force we cannot tell. 
He is also threatening Leesburg, and Geary on the Manassas 
Gap Railroad, from both north and south ; in precisely what 
force we cannot tell. I think the movement is a general and 
concerted one, such as would not be if he was acting upon the 
purpose of a very desperate defence of Richmond. I think the 
time is near when you must either attack Richmond or give up 
the job and come to the defence of Washington. Let me hear 
from you instantly. 

" A. LINCOLN, 

"'President" 

To which I replied as follows : 

Telegram received. Independently of it, the time is very 
near when I shall attack Richmond. The object of the move- 
ment is probably to prevent reinforcements being sent to me. 
All the information obtained from balloons, deserters, prisoners, 
and contrabands agrees in the statement that the mass of the 
rebel troops are still in the immediate vicinity of Richmond, 
ready to defend it. I have no knowledge of Banks's position 
and force, nor what there is at Manassas ; therefore cannot form 
a definite opinion as to the force against him. 

I have two corps across Chickahominy, within six miles of 
Richmond ; the others on this side at other crossings within 
same distance, and ready to cross when bridges are completed. 

On the 26th I received the following : 

" We have Gen. Banks's official report. He has saved his 



368 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

army and baggage, and has made a safe retreat to the river, and 
is probably safe at Williamsport. He reports the attacking force 
at fifteen thousand (15,000). 

"A. LINCOLN, 

"President." 



Also the following : 

" Can you not cut the Acquia Creek Railroad ? Also, what 
impression have you as to entrenched works for you to contend 
with in front of Richmond ? Can you get near enough to throw 
shells into the city ? 

" A. LINCOLN, 

" President." 

On the same day I sent the following : 



Have cut the Virginia Central Road in three places between 
Hanover Court-House and the Chickahominy. Will try to cut 
the other. I do not think Richmond entrenchments formidable ; 
but am not certain. Hope very soon to be within shelling dis- 
tance. Have railroad in operation from White House to Chicka- 
hominy. Hope to have Chickahominy bridge repaired to-night. 
Nothing of interest to-day. 

The interruption of the railroad here referred to was effected 
by the command of Brig.-Gen. Stoneman, and was intended to 
prevent the enemy from drawing supplies by that route or from 
sending reinforcements to Anderson or Jackson. At ten A.M. 
I telegraphed to the President : 

I am glad to know affairs are not so bad as might have 
been. I would earnestly call your attention to my instructions 
to Gen. Banks of March 16, to Gen. Wadsworth of same date, 
and to my letter of April i to the adjutant-general. I cannot 
but think that a prompt return to the principles there laid down 
would relieve all probability of danger. I will forward copies 
by mail. I beg to urge the importance of Manassas and Front 
Royal in contradistinction to Fredericksburg. 



On the same day I received intelligence that a very con- 
siderable force of the enemy was in the vicinity of Hanover 
Court-House, to the right and rear of our army, thus threaten- 
ing our communications, and in a position either to reinforce 



MCDOWELL. 369 

Jackson or to impede McDowell's junction, should he finally 
move to unite with us. On the same day I also received infor- 
mation from Gen. McDowell, through the Secretary of War, 
that the enemy had fallen back from Fredericksburg towards 
Richmond, and that Gen. McDowell's advance was eight miles 
south of the Rappahannock. 

" WASHINGTON, May 26, 1862. 
"Gen. McClellan: 

" Following despatch received late last night : 

" ' Falmouth, i$th To Hon. E. M. Stanton : I have just ex- 
amined a lieutenant, three sergeants, and a corporal who came 
in from the army as deserters this morning. They are, with the 
exception of one Frenchman, from the North, pressed into ser- 
vice. They are all men of fine intelligence. The lieutenant 
and the sergeants, who came from the same battery, are positive 
the army has fallen back to Richmond. The first order was 
to go at 1.30 P.M. to Hanover Junction, they having heard of 
McClellan 's right wing being at Hanover Court-House and hav- 
ing destroyed the railroad to Gordonsville at that place, which 
made them fear for their communications. 

* This was suddenly revoked, and an order was read on 
parade directing the command back to Richmond to take part in 
the great battle now about to take place there. Two other men 
thought that the force was going to join Jackson, who was going 
to get in the rear of my army, and was going into Maryland. 
This was only surmise ; the order for Richmond was written 
and published. My advance is eight miles beyond Fredericks- 
burg. I hope soon to be able to tell you more precisely where 
the enemy is. One thing is certain : that, whether they left here 
to join Jackson or not, they have not done so yet, and that all 
the grand masses Geary reports must have come from some 
other place than here. They left here by stealth, and with dread 
of being attacked. They went at night, and for a distance by 
railroad. They thought 1 had sixty thousand men. (Signed) 
IRWIN MCDOWELL.' 

** E. M. STANTON, 

" Secretary of War" 

It was thus imperative to dislodge or defeat this force, inde- 
pendently even of the wishes of the President as expressed in 
his telegram of the 26th. I entrusted this task to Brig.-Gen. 
Fitz-John Porter, commanding the 5th corps, with orders to 
move at daybreak on the 27th. 



37O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Through a heavy rain and over bad roads that officer moved 
his command as follows : 

Brig.-Gen. W. H. Emory led the advance with the 5th and 
6th regiments U. S. Cavalry and Benson's horse-battery of the 2d 
U. S. Artillery, taking the road from New bridge via Mechanics- 
ville to Hanover Court-House. 

Gen. Morell's division, composed of the brigades of Martin- 
dale, Butterfield, and McQuade, with Berdan's regiment of sharp- 
shooters and three batteries under Capt. Charles Griffin, 5th 
U. S. Artillery, followed on the same road. 

Col. G. K. Warren, commanding a provisional brigade com- 
posed of the 5th and i3th N. Y., the ist Conn. Artillery acting 
as infantry, the 6th Penn. Cavalry, and Weeden's R. I. Battery, 
moved from his station at Old Church by a road running to 
Hanover Court-House, parallel to the Pamunkey. 

After a fatiguing march of fourteen miles through the mud 
and rain, Gen. Emory at noon reached a point about two miles 
from Hanover Court-House, where the road forks to Ashland, 
and found a portion of the enemy formed in line across the Han- 
over Court-House road. 

Gen. Emory had, before this, been joined by the 25th N. Y. 
(of Martindale's brigade) and Berdan's sharpshooters ; these 
regiments were deployed with a section of Benson's battery, and 
advanced slowly towards the enemy until reinforced by Gen. 
Butterfield with four regiments of his brigade, when the enemy 
was charged and quickly routed, one of his guns being captured 
by the i;th N. Y., under Col. Lansing, after having been dis- 
abled by the fire of Benson's battery. The firing here lasted 
about an hour. The cavalry and Benson's battery were immedi- 
ately ordered in pursuit, followed by Morell's infantry and artil- 
lery, with the exception of Martindale's brigade. Warren's bri- 
gade, having been delayed by repairing bridges, etc., now arrived, 
too late to participate in this affair ; a portion of this command 
was sent to the Pamunkey to destroy bridges, and captured quite a 
number of prisoners ; the remainder followed Morell's division. In 
the meantime Gen. Martindale, with the few remaining regiments 
of his brigade and a section of artillery, advanced on the Ashland 
road, and found a force of the enemy's infantry, cavalry, and artil- 
lery in position near Beake's Station on the Virginia Central Rail- 
road ; he soon forced them to retire towards Ashland. 



HA NO VER CO UR T-HO USE. 3 7 I 

The 25th N. Y. having been ordered to rejoin him, Gen. Mar- 
tindale was directed to form his brigade and move up the railroad 
to rejoin the rest of the command at Hanover Court-House. 

He sent one regiment up the railroad, but remained with the 
2d Me., afterwards joined by the 25th N. Y., to guard the rear 
of the main column. 

The enemy soon returned to attack Gen. Martindale, who at 
once formed the 2d Me., 25th N. Y,, and a portion of the 44th 
N. Y., with one section of Martin's battery, on the New bridge 
road, facing his own position of the morning, and then held his 
ground for an hour against large odds until reinforced. 

Gen. Porter was at Hanover Court-House, near the head of 
his column, when he learned that the rear had been attacked 
by a large force. He at once faced the whole column about, 
recalled the cavalry sent in pursuit towards Ashland, moved 
the i3th and i4th N. Y. and Griffin's battery direct to Martin- 
dale's assistance, pushed the gth Mass, and 62d Penn., of Mc- 
Quade's brigade, through the woods on the right (our origi- 
nal left), and attacked the flank of the enemy, while Butterfield, 
with the 83d Penn. and i6th Mich., hastened towards the scene 
of action by the railroad and through the woods, further to 
the right, and completed the rout of the enemy. During the 
remainder of this and the following day our cavalry was active 
in the pursuit, taking a number of prisoners. 

Capt. Harrison, of the 5th U. S. Cavalry, with a single com- 
pany, brought in as prisoners two entire companies of infantry 
with their arms and ammunition. A part of Rush's lancers also 
captured an entire company with their arms. 

The immediate results of these affairs were some 200 of the 
enemy's dead buried by our troops, 730 prisoners sent to the 
rear, one 1 2-pound howitzer, one caisson, a large number of 
small arms, and 2 railroad trains captured. 

Our loss amounted to 53 killed, 344 wounded and missing. 

Their camp at Hanover Court-House was taken and de- 
stroyed. 

Having reason to believe that Gen. Anderson, with a strong 
force, was still at Ashland, I ordered Gen. Sykes's division of 
regulars to move on the 28th from New bridge towards Hanover 
Court- House, to be in position to support Gen. Porter. They 
reached a point within three miles of Hanover Court-House, and 



372 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

remained there until the evening of the 29th, when they returned 
to their original camp. 

On the 28th Gen. Stoneman's command of cavalry, horse 
artillery, and two regiments of infantry were also placed under 
Gen. Porter's orders. 

On the same day I visited Hanover Court-House, whence I 
sent the following despatch to the Secretary of War : 

MAY>28, 2 P.M. 

Porter's action of yesterday was truly a glorious victory ; too 
much credit cannot be given to his magnificent division and its 
accomplished leader. The rout of the rebels was complete ; not 
a defeat, but a complete rout. Prisoners are constantly com- 
ing in ; two companies have this moment arrived with excel- 
lent arms. 

There is no doubt that the enemy are concentrating every- 
thing on Richmond. I will do my best to cut off Jackson, but 
am doubtful whether I can. 

It is the policy and duty of the government to send me by 
water all the well-drilled troops available. I am confident that 
Washington is in no danger. Engines and cars in large numbers 
have been sent up to bring down Jackson's command. 

I may not be able to cut them off, but will try ; we have cut 
all but the Fredericksburg and Richmond Railroad. The real 
issue is in the battle about to be fought in front of Richmond. 
All our available troops should be collected here not raw regi- 
ments, but the well-drilled troops. It cannot be ignored that 
a desperate battle is before us ; if any regiments of good troops 
remain unemployed it will be an irreparable fault committed. 

Having ascertained the state of affairs, instructions were 
given for the operations of the following day. 

On the 28th a party under Maj. Williams, 6th U. S. Cavalry, 
destroyed the common road bridges over the Pamunkey, and 
Virginia Central Railroad bridge over the South Anna. 

On the 29th he destroyed the Fredericksburg and Richmond 
Railroad bridge over the South Anna, and the turnpike bridge 
over the same stream. 

On the same day, and mainly to cover the movement of Maj. 
Williams, Gen. Emory moved a column of cavalry towards Ash- 
land from Hanover Court-House. The advance of this column, 
under Capt. Chambliss, 5th U. S. Cavalry, entered Ashland, driv- 
ing out a party of the enemy, destroyed the railroad bridge over 
Stony creek, broke up the railroad and telegraph. 



HANOVER COURT-HOUSE. 373 

Another column of all arms, under Col. Warren, was sent 
on the same day by the direct road to Ashland, and entered it 
shortly after Gen. Emory's column had retired, capturing a small 
party there. 

Gen. Stoneman on the same day moved on Ashland by 
Leach's Station, covering well the movements of the other col- 
umns. 

The objects of the expedition having been accomplished, 
and it being certain that the ist corps would not join us at 
once, Gen. Porter withdrew his command to their camps with 
the main army on the evening of the 2pth. 

On the night of the 27th and 28th I sent the following 
despatch to the Secretary of War: 

Porter has gained two complete victories over superior forces, 
yet I feel obliged to move in the morning with reinforcements 
to secure the complete destruction of the rebels in that quarter. 
In doing so I run some risk here, but I cannot help it. The ene- 
my are even in greater force than I had supposed. I will do all 
that quick movements can accomplish, but you must send me all 
the troops you can, and leave to me full latitude as to choice of 
commanders. It is absolutely necessary to destroy the rebels 
near Hanover Court-House before I can advance. 

In reply to which I received the following from the Presi- 
dent : 

"WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862. 

" I am very glad of Gen. F. J. Porter's victory ; still, if it was 
a total rout of the enemy, I am puzzled to know why the Rich- 
mond and Fredericksburg Railroad was not seized again, as you 
say you have all the railroads but the Richmond and Fredericks- 
burg. I am puzzled to see how, lacking that, you can have any, 
except the scrap from Richmond to West Point. The scrap of 
the Virginia Central from Richmond to Hanover Junction, with- 
out more, is simply nothing. That the whole of the enemy is 
concentrating on Richmond I think cannot be certainly known 
to you or me. Saxton, at Harper's Ferry, informs us that large 
forces, supposed to be Jackson's and Ewell's, forced his advance 
from Charlestown to-day. Gen. King telegraphs us from Frede- 
ricksburg that contrabands give certain information that 15,000 
left Hanover Junction Monday morning to reinforce Jackson. 
I am painfully impressed with the importance of the struggle 
before you, and shall aid you all I can consistently with my 
view of due regard to all points." 



374 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

In regard to this telegram of the President it may be re- 
marked that it would have been dangerous and foolish in the 
extreme to leave Porter at Ashland and Hanover Court-House 
to hold the railways. I knew that McDowell would not advance 
for some time, if at all. I could not reinforce Porter sufficiently 
to enable him to remain in his advanced position without draw- 
ing so largely from the main army as to endanger its safety and 
reduce it to inaction. Moreover, there was no object in running 
this risk. I had broken the direct line of communication be- 
tween Richmond and Jackson ; had cleared the front of Freder- 
icksburg, so that McDowell could advance unopposed, and had 
relieved my own right flank and rear from immediate danger. 

At 6 P.M. of the 2 pth I telegraphed the Secretary of War : 

Gen. Porter has gained information that Gen. Anderson left 
his position in vicinity of Fredericksburg at four A.M. Sunday 
with the following troops: ist S. C., Col. Hamilton ; one battal- 
ion S. C. Rifles, 34th and 38th N. C., 45th Ga., i2th, i3th, and 
i4th S. C., 3d La., two batteries of four guns each namely, 
Letcher's Va. and Mclntosh's S. C. batteries. Gen. Anderson 
and his command passed Ashland yesterday evening en route for 
Richmond, leaving men behind to destroy bridges over the tele- 
graph road which they travelled. This information is reliable. 
It is also positively certain that Branch's command was from 
Gordonsville, bound for Richmond, whither they have now gone. 

It may be regarded as positive, I think, that there is no rebel 
force between Fredericksburg and Junction. 

The following was also sent on the same day by Gen. Marcy : 

" A detachment from Gen. F. J. Porter's command, under 
Maj. Williams, 6th Cavalry, destroyed the South Anna railroad 
bridge at about nine A.M. to-day ; a large quantity of Confederate 
public property was also destroyed at Ashland this morning." 

In reply to which the following was received from the Pre- 
sident : 

" Your despatch as to the South Anna and Ashland being 
seized by our forces this morning is received. Understanding 
these points to be on the Richmond and Fredericksburg Rail- 
road, I heartily congratulate the country, and thank Gen. Mc- 
Clellan and his army for their seizure." 

On the 3oth I sent the following to Secretary Stanton : 



McDOWELL'S WA Y CLEAR. 



375 



From the tone of your despatches and the President's I do 
not think that you at all appreciate the value and magnitude 
of Porter's victory. It has entirely relieved my right flank, 
which was seriously threatened ; routed and demoralized a con- 
siderable portion of the rebel forces; taken over 750 prison- 
ers ; killed and wounded large numbers ; one gun, many small 
arms, and much baggage taken. It was one of the handsomest 
things in the war, both in itself and in its results. Porter has 
returned, and "my army is again well in hand. Another day 
will make the probable field of battle passable for artillery. It is 
quite certain that there is nothing in front of McDowell at 
Fredericksburg. I regard the burning of South Anna bridges as 
the least important result of Porter's movement. 

The results of this brilliant operation of Gen. Porter were the 
dispersal of Gen. Branch's division and the clearing of our right 
flank and rear. It was rendered impossible for the enemy to 
communicate by rail with Fredericksburg, or with Jackson via 
Gordonsville, except by the very circuitous route of Lynchburg, 
and the road was left entirely open for the advance of McDowell 
had he been permitted to join the Army of the Potomac. His 
withdrawal towards Front Royal was, in my judgment, a serious 
and fatal error ; he could do no good in that direction, while, 
had he been permitted to carry out the orders of May 17, the 
united forces would have driven the enemy within the imme- 
diate entrenchments of Richmond before Jackson could have 
returned to its succor, and probably would have gained posses- 
sion promptly of that place. 

It is very clear that the arrangements I directed in March 
and on the ist of April for the defence of Washington and the 
Shenandoah would have proved ample to check Jackson without 
delaying the advance of McDowell. The total disregard of these 
instructions led to the actual condition of affairs. 

On the 25th of May McDowell's advance was eight miles 
beyond Fredericksburg. If he had marched on the 26th, as 
first ordered, he would have found no enemy in his front until 
he reached the South Anna, on the 27th or early on the 28th. 
For his telegram of the 25th shows that they had hastily fallen 
back during the night of the 24th and 25th, and Porter found 
them at Hanover Court-House and Ashland on the 2/th ; so 
that, as things were, Porter's division alone would have insured 
McDowell's junction with the Army of the Potomac without the 
slightest difficulty. 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Had McDowell advanced, however, my own movements would 
naturally have been modified. 

I would have placed the 3d corps in position to hold Bot- 
tom's bridge and the railroad bridge, and to guard our left and 
communications with West Point. The 4th corps would have 
been placed near New Cold Harbor, with one division a couple 
of miles to the westward to watch the crossings of the Chicka- 
hominy from Grapevine bridge to Beaver Dam creek, ready to 
support either the 4th or the 2d corps, as might be necessary. 

The 2d corps near Mechanicsville, to hold the crossing oppo- 
site thereto and that at Meadow bridge, and prepared to move 
instantly to the support of the 5th and 6th corps. 

The 6th corps through Atlee's Station to the Fredericksburg 
and Richmond turnpike, to occupy the Virginia Central Railroad 
and Winston's bridge, and, leaving a sufficient force to hold that 
point, to move either direct upon the line of the Fredericksburg 
and Richmond Railroad south of Ashland, or to support the 5th 
corps in the direction of Hanover Court-House, as circumstances 
might have required. 

The 5th corps would have followed the line of march which 
Morell's division pursued on the 27th, sending a detached bri- 
gade direct from Old Church to Hanover Court-House; and hav- 
ing reached the Central Railroad and the Fredericksburg turn- 
pike about four miles south of Hanover Court-House, the mass 
of the corps would either have moved on Hanover Court-House 
or in conjunction with the 6th corps on Ashland, as the move- 
ments of the enemy might have required. Thus our old posi- 
tions would have been securely held, McDowell's junction would 
have been secured in spite of any movements of the enemy, and 
the chances would have been in favor of our destroying any force 
of the enemy between the Chickahominy and the South Anna. 

The moment these objects were accomplished the 5th and 
6th corps would have returned to the vicinity of Mechanics- 
ville. It would then have been easy for McDowell to advance 
by the Fredericksburg turnpike far enough to turn the bat- 
teries covering the Mechanicsville crossings, so that the two 
armies could unite on the right bank of the Chickahominy, and 
the capture of Richmond could have been accomplished long 
before Jackson could return to reinforce the garrison. 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

Operations on the Chickahominy Battle of Fair Oaks McDowell's 
corps is coming Still stretching the right wing Floods of the 
Chickahominy Movement on Old Tavern. 

ON the 2oth of May a reconnoissance had been ordered on 
the south side of the Chickahominy towards James river. This 
was accomplished by Brig. -Gen. H. M. Naglee, who crossed his 
brigade near Bottom's bridge and pushed forward to within 
two miles of James river without serious resistance or finding 
the enemy in force. The rest of the 4th corps, commanded 
by Gen. E. D. Keyes, crossed the Chickahominy on the 23d 
of May. 

On the 24th, 25th, and 26th a very gallant reconnoissance 
was pushed by Gen. Naglee, with his brigade, beyond the Seven 
Pines, and on the 25th the 4th corps was ordered to take up and 
fortify a position in the vicinity of the Seven Pines. The order 
was at once obeyed, a strong line of rifle-pits opened, and an 
abatis constructed a little in the rear of the point where the nine- 
mile road comes into the Williamsburg road. 

On the same day Gen. Heintzelman was ordered to cross with 
his corps (the 3d) and take a position two miles in advance of 
Bottom's bridge, watching the crossing of White Oak Swamp, and 
covering the left and the rear of the left wing of the army. Being 
the senior officer on that side of the river, he was placed in com- 
mand of both corps and ordered to hold the Seven Pines at all 
hazards, but not to withdraw the troops from the crossings of 
White Oak Swamp unless in an emergency. 

On the 28th Gen. Keyes was ordered to advance Casey's divi- 
sion to Fair Oaks, on the Williamsburg road, some three-quarters 
of a mile in front of the Seven Pines, leaving Gen. Couch's divi- 
sion at the line of rifle-pits. A new line of rifle-pits and a small 
redoubt for six field-guns were commenced, and much of the 
timber in front of this line was felled on the two days following. 
The picket-line was established, reaching from the Chickahominy 
to White Oak Swamp. 

377 



378 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

On the 3oth Gen. Heintzelman, representing that the advance 
had met with strong opposition in taking up their position, and 
that he considered the point a critical one, requested and ob- 
tained authority to make such a disposition of his troops as he 
saw fit to meet the emergency. He immediately advanced two 
brigades of Kearny's division about three-fourths of a mile in 
front of Savage's Station, thus placing them within supporting 
distance of Casey's division, which held the advance of the 
4th corps. 

On the 3oth the troops on the south side of the Chicka- 
hominy were in position as follows : Casey's division on the 
right of the Williamsburg road, at right angles to it, the centre 
at Fair Oaks ; Couch's division at the Seven Pines ; Kearny's 
division on the railroad, from near Savage's Station towards the 
bridge ; Hooker's division on the borders of White Oak Swamp. 
Constant skirmishing had been kept up between our pickets and 
those of the enemy. While these lines were being taken up and 
strengthened large bodies of Confederate troops were seen imme- 
diately to the front and right of Casey's position. 

During the day and night of the 3oth of May a very violent 
storm occurred. The rain falling in torrents rendered work 
on the rifle-pits and bridges impracticable, made the roads 
almost impassable, and threatened the destruction of the bridges 
over the Chickahominy. 

The enemy, perceiving the unfavorable position in which we 
were placed, and the possibility of destroying that part of our 
army which was apparently cut off from the main body by the 
rapidly rising stream, threw an overwhelming force (grand divi- 
sions of Gens. D. H. Hill, Huger, Longstreet, and G. W. Smith) 
upon the position occupied by Casey's division. 

It appears from the official reports of Gen. Keyes and his 
subordinate commanders that at ten o'clock A.M. on the 3ist of 
May an aide-de-camp of Gen. J. E. Johnston was captured by 
Gen. Naglee's pickets. But little information as to the move- 
ments of the enemy was obtained from him, but his presence 
so near our lines excited suspicion and caused increased vigi- 
lance, cind the troops were ordered by Gen. Keyes to be under 
arms at eleven o'clock. Between eleven and twelve o'clock it 
was reported to Gen. Casey that the enemy were approaching 
in considerable force on the Williamaburg road. At this time 






FAIR OAKS. 379 

Casey's division was disposed as follows : Naglee's brigade 
extending from the Williamsburg road to the Garnett field, 
having one regiment across the railroad ; Gen. Wessells's bri- 
gade in the rifle-pits, and Gen. Palmer's in the rear of Gen. 
Wessells's ; one battery of artillery in advance with Gen. Naglee ; 
one battery in rear of rifle-pits to the right of the redoubt ; one 
battery in rear of the redoubt, and another battery unharnessed 
in the redoubt. Gen. Couch's division, holding the second line, 
had Gen. Abercrombie's brigade on the right, along the nine- 
mile road, with two regiments and one battery across the rail- 
road near Fair Oaks Station ; Gen. Peck's brigade on the right 
and Gen. Devens's in the centre. 

On the approach of the enemy Gen. Casey sent forward one 
of Gen. Palmer's regiments to support the picket-line ; but this 
regiment gave way without making much, if any, resistance. 
Heavy firing at once commenced, and the pickets were driven 
in. Gen. Keyes ordered Gen. Couch to move Gen. Peck's bri- 
gade to occupy the ground on the left of the Williamsburg road, 
which had not before been occupied by our forces, and thus to 
support Gen. Casey's left, where the first attack was the most 
severe. The enemy now came on in heavy force, attacking Gen. 
Casey simultaneously in front and on both flanks. Gen. Keyes 
sent to Gen. Heintzelman for reinforcements, but the messenger 
was delayed, so that orders were not sent to Gens. Kearny and 
Hooker until nearly three o'clock, and it was nearly five P.M. 
when Gens. Jameson's and Berry's brigades of Gen. Kearny's 
division arrived on the field. Gen. Birney was ordered up the 
railroad, but by Gen. Kearny's order halted his brigade before 
arriving at the scene of action. Orders were also despatched 
for Gen. Hooker to move up from White Oak Swamp, and he 
arrived after dark at Savage's Station. 

As soon as the firing was heard at headquarters orders were 
sent to Gen. Sumner to get his command under arms and be 
ready to move at a moment's warning. His corps, consisting of 
Gens. Richardson's and Sedgwick's divisions, was encamped on 
the north side of the Chickahominy some six miles above Bot- 
tom's bridge. Each division had thrown a bridge over the 
stream opposite to its own position. 

At one o'clock Gen. Sumner moved the two divisions to their 

respective bridges, with instructions to halt and await further 

29 



380 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

orders. At two o'clock orders were sent from headquarters to 
cross these divisions without delay and push them rapidly to 
Gen. Heintzelman's support. This order was received and com- 
municated at half-past two, and the passage was immediately 
commenced. In the meantime Gen. Naglee's brigade, with the 
batteries of Gen. Casey's division, which Gen. Naglee directed, 
struggled gallantly to maintain the redoubt and rifle-pits against 
the overwhelming masses of the enemy. They were reinforced 
by a regiment from Gen. Peck's brigade. The artillery, under 
command of Col. G. D. Bailey, ist N. Y. Artillery, and after- 
wards of Gen. Naglee, did good execution on the advancing 
column. The left of this position was, however, soon turned, 
and a sharp cross-fire opened upon the gunners and men in the 
rifle-pits. Col. Bailey, Maj. Van Valkenberg, and Adj. Ramsey, 
of the same regiment, were killed ; some of the guns in the 
redoubt were taken, and the whole line was driven back upon the 
position occupied by Gen. Couch. The brigades of Gens. Wes- 
sells and Palmer, with the reinforcements which had been sent 
them from Gen. Couch, had also been driven from the field with 
heavy loss, and the whole position occupied by Gen. Casey's 
division was taken by the enemy. 

Previous to this time Gen. Keyes ordered Gen. Couch to 
advance two regiments to relieve the pressure upon Gen. Casey's 
right flank. In making this movement Gen. Couch discovered 
large masses of the enemy pushing towards our right and cross- 
ing -the railroad, as well as a heavy column which had been held 
in reserve and which was now making its way towards Fair Oaks 
station. Gen. Couch at once engaged this column with two regi- 
ments ; but, though reinforced by two additional regiments, he 
was overpowered, and the enemy pushed between him and the 
main body of his division. With these four regiments and one 
battery Gen. Couch fell back about half a mile towards the 
Grapevine bridge, where, hearing that Gen. Sumner had crossed, 
he formed line of battle facing Fair Oaks Station and prepared 
to hold the position. 

Gens. Berry's and Jameson's brigades had by this time arrived 
in front of the Seven Pines. Gen. Berry was ordered to take 
possession of the woods on the left and push forward so as to 
have a flank- fire on the enemy's lines. This movement was 
executed brilliantly, Gen. Berry pushing his regiments forward

through the woods until their rifles commanded the left of the 
camp and works occupied by Gen. Casey's division in the morn- 
ing. Their fire on the pursuing columns of the enemy was very 
destructive, and assisted materially in checking the pursuit in 
that part of the field. He held his position in these woods 
against several attacks of superior numbers, and after dark, 
being cut off by the enemy from the main body, he fell back 
towards White Oak Swamp, and by a circuit brought his men 
into our lines in good order. 

Gen. Jameson, with two regiments (the other two of his bri- 
gade having been detached one to Gen. Peck and one to Gen. 
Birney), moved rapidly to the front on the left of the Williams- 
burg road, and succeeded for a time in keeping the abatis clear 
of the enemy. But large numbers of the enemy pressing past 
the right of his line, he too was forced to retreat through the 
woods towards White Oak Swamp, and in that way gained camp 
under cover of night. 

Brig.-Gen. Devens, who had held the centre of Gen. Couch's 
division, had made repeated and gallant efforts to regain por- 
tions of the ground lost in front, but each time was driven back, 
and finally withdrew behind the rifle-pits near Seven Pines. 

Meantime Gen. Sumner had arrived with the advance of his 
corps, Gen. Sedgwick's division, at the point held by Gen. Couch 
with four regiments and one battery. The roads leading from 
the bridge were so miry that it was only by the greatest exertion 
Gen. Sedgwick had been able to get one of his batteries to the 
front. 

The leading regiment (ist Minn., Col. Sully) was immediately 
deployed to the right of Couch to protect the flank, and the rest 
of the division formed in line of battle, Kirby's battery near the 
centre in an angle of the woods. One of Gen. Couch's regi- 
ments was sent to open communication with Gen. Heintzelman. 
No sooner were these dispositions made than the enemy came in 
strong force and opened a heavy fire along the line. He made 
several charges, but was each time repulsed with great loss by the 
steady fire of the infantry and the splendid practice of the bat- 
tery. After sustaining the enemy's fire for a considerable time 
Gen. Sumner ordered five regiments (the 34th N. Y., Col. Sinter ; 
82d N. Y., Lieut.-Col. Hudson; i5th Mass., Lieut.-Col. Kimball; 
2oth Mass., Col. Lee ; yth Mich., Maj. Richardson the three

former of Gen. Gorman's brigade, the two latter of Gen. Dana's 
brigade) to advance and charge with the bayonet. This charge 
was executed in the most brilliant manner. Our troops, spring- 
ing over two fences which were between them and the enemy, 
rushed upon his lines and drove him in confusion from that part 
of the field. Darkness now ended the battle for that day. 

During the night dispositions were made for its early renewal. 
Gen. Couch's division, and so much of Gen. Casey's as could be 
collected together, with Gen. Kearny's, occupied the rifle-pits 
near Seven Pines. Gen. Peck, in falling back on the left, had 
succeeded late in the afternoon in rallying a considerable number 
of stragglers, and was taking them once more into the action, 
when he was ordered back to the entrenched camp by Gen. 
Kearny. Gen. Hooker brought up his division about dark, hav- 
ing been delayed by the heaviness of the roads and the throng of 
fugitives from the field, through whom the colonel of the leading 
regiment (Starr) reports he " was obliged to force his way with 
the bayonet." This division bivouacked for the night in rear of 
the right of the rifle-pits on the other side of the railroad. Gen. 
Richardson's division also came upon the field about sunset. He 
had attempted the passage of the Chickahominy by the bridge 
opposite his own camp, but it was so far destroyed that he was 
forced to move Gens. Howard and Meagher's brigades, with all 
his artillery, around by Gen. Sedgwick's bridge, while Gen. 
French's brigade with the utmost difficulty crossed by the 
other. Gen. Sedgwick's division, with the regiments under 
Gen. Couch, held about the same position as when the fight 
ceased, and Gen. Richardson on his arrival was ordered to 
place his division on the left to connect with Gen. Kearny. 
Gen. French's brigade was posted along the railroad, and Gens. 
Howard's and Meagher's brigades in second and third lines. All 
his artillery had been left behind, it being impossible to move it 
forward through the deep mud as rapidly as the infantry pushed 
towards the field, but during the night the three batteries of the 
division were brought to the front. 

About five o'clock on the morning of the ist of June skir- 
mishers and some cavalry of the enemy were discovered in front 
of Gen. Richardson's division. Capt. Pettit's battery (B, ist 
N. Y.), having come upon the ground, threw a few shells among 
them, when they dispersed. There was a wide interval between 



FAIR OAKS. 383 

Gen. Richardson and Gen. Kearny. To close this Gen. Rich- 
ardson's line was extended to the left and his first line moved 
over the railroad. Scarcely had they gained the position when 
the enemy, appearing in large force from the woods in front, 
opened a heavy fire of musketry at short range along the whole 
line. He approached very rapidly, with columns of attack formed 
on two roads which crossed the railroad. These columns were 
supported by infantry in line of battle on each side, cutting Gen. 
French's line. He threw out no skirmishers, but appeared deter- 
mined to carry all before him by one crushing blow. For nearly 
an hour the first line of Gen. Richardson's division stood and 
returned the fire, the lines of the enemy being reinforced and 
relieved time after time, till finally Gen. Howard was ordered 
with his brigade to go to Gen. French's assistance. He led his 
men gallantly to the front, and in a few minutes the fire of the 
enemy ceased and his whole line fell back on that part of the 
field. On the opening of the firing in the morning Gen. Hooker 
pushed forward on the railroad with two regiments (5th and 6th 
N. J.), followed by Gen. Sickles's brigade. It was found impos- 
sible to move the artillery of this division from its position on 
account of the mud. On coming near the woods, which were 
held by the enemy in force, Gen. Hooker found Gen. Birney's bri- 
gade, Col. J. Hobart Ward in command, in line of battle.' He sent 
back to hasten Gen. Sickles's brigade, but ascertained that it had 
been turned off to the left by Gen. Heintzelman to meet a column 
advancing in that direction. He at once made the attack with the 
two New Jersey regiments, calling upon Col. Ward to support 
him with Gen. Birney's brigade. This was well done, our troops 
advancing into the woods under a heavy fire, and pushing the 
enemy before them for more than an hour of hard fighting. A 
charge with the bayonet was then ordered by Gen. Hooker with 
the 5th and 6th N. J., 3d Me., and 38th and 4oth N. Y., and the 
enemy fled in confusion, throwing down arms and even clothing 
in his flight. Gen. Sickles, having been ordered to the left, 
formed line of battle on both sides of the Williamsburg road and 
advanced under a sharp fire from the enemy, deployed in the 
woods in front of him. After a brisk interchange of musketry- 
fire while crossing the open ground, the Excelsior Brigade dashed 
into the timber with the bayonet and put the enemy to flight. 
On the right the enemy opened fire after half an hour's cessa- 



384 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY, 

tion, which was promptly responded to by Gen. Richardson's 
division. Again the most vigorous efforts were made to break 
our line, and again they were frustrated by the steady courage of 
our troops. In about an hour Gen. Richardson's whole line 
advanced, pouring in their fire at close range, which threw the 
line of the enemy back in some confusion. This was followed 
up by a bayonet-charge, led by Gen. French in person, with the 
57th and 66th N. Y., supported by two regiments sent by Gen. 
Heintzelman, the yist and 73d N. Y., which turned the confu- 
sion of the enemy into precipitate flight. One gun captured 
the previous day was retaken. 

Our troops pushed forward as far as the lines held by them 
on the 3ist before the attack. On the battle-field there were 
found many of our own and the Confederate wounded, arms, 
caissons, wagons, subsistence stores, and forage, abandoned by 
the enemy in his rout. The state of the roads and impossibility 
of manoeuvring artillery prevented further pursuit. On the next 
morning a reconnoissance was sent forward, which pressed back 
the pickets of the enemy to within five miles of Richmond ; but 
again the impossibility of forcing even a few batteries forward 
precluded our holding permanently this position. The lines 
held previous to the battle were therefore resumed. 

On the 3ist, when the battle of Fair Oaks commenced, we 
had two of our bridges nearly completed ; but the rising waters 
flooded the log-way approaches and made them almost impass- 
able, so that it was only by the greatest efforts that Gen. Sumner 
crossed his corps and participated in that hard-fought engage- 
ment. The bridges became totally useless after this corps had 
passed, and others on a more permanent plan were commenced. 

On my way to headquarters, after the battle of Fair Oaks, 
I attempted to cross the bridge where Gen. Sumner had taken 
over his corps on the day previous. At the time Gen. Sumner 
crossed this was the only available bridge above Bottom's 
bridge. I found the approach from the right bank for some 
four hundred yards submerged to the depth of several feet, 
and, on reaching the place where the bridge had been, I found 
a great part of it carried away, so that I could not get my horse 
over, and was obliged to send him to Bottom's bridge, six miles 
below, as the only practicable crossing. 

The approaches to New and Mechanicsville bridges were 



Me DO WELL A GA IN PROMISED. 385 

also overflowed, and both of them were enfiladed by the ene- 
my's batteries established upon commanding heights on the 
opposite side. These batteries were supported by strong forces 
of the enemy, having numerous rifle-pits in their front, which 
would have made it necessary, even had the approaches been 
in the best possible condition, to have fought a sanguinary bat- 
tle, with but little prospect of success, before a passage could 
have been secured. 

The only available means, therefore, of uniting our forces 
at Fair Oaks for an advance on Richmond soon after the bat- 
tle was to march the troops from Mechanicsville and other points , 
on the left bank of the Chickahominy down to Bottom's bridge, 
and thence over the Williamsburg road to the position near Fair 
Oaks, a distance of about twenty-three miles. In the condition 
of the roads at that time this march could not have been made 
with artillery in less than two days, by which time the enemy 
would have been secure within his entrenchments around Rich- 
mond. In short, the idea of uniting the two wings of the army 
in time to make a vigorous pursuit of the enemy, with the pros- 
pect of overtaking him before he reached Richmond, only five 
miles distant from the field of battle, is simply absurd, and was, 
I presume, never for a moment seriously entertained by any one 
connected with the Army of the Potomac. An advance involv- 
ing the separation of the two wings by the impassable Chicka- 
hominy would have exposed each to defeat in detail. There- 
fore I held the position already gained, and completed our 
crossings as rapidly as possible. 

In the meantime the troops at Fair Oaks were directed to 
strengthen their positions by a strong line of entrenchments, 
which protected them while the bridges were being built, gave 
security to the trains, liberated a larger fighting force, and 
offered a safer retreat in the event of disaster. 

On June 2 the Secretary of War telegraphed : " The indica- 
tions are that Fremont or McDowell will fight Jackson to-day, 
and as soon as he is disposed of another large body of troops 
will be at your service." 

On the 3d the President telegraphed : " With these continu- 
ous rains I am very anxious about the Chickahominy so close 
in your rear, and crossing your line of communication. Please 
look to it." 



386 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

To which I replied : " Your despatch of five P.M. just re- 
ceived. As the Chickahominy has been almost the only obsta- 
cle in my way for several days, your excellency may rest assured 
that it has not been overlooked. Every effort has been made, 
and will continue to be, to perfect the communications across 
it." 

My views of the condition of our army on the 4th were 
explained to the President as follows : 

Terrible rain-storm during the night and morning ; not yet 
cleared off. Chickahominy flooded ; bridges in bad condition. 
Are still hard at work at them. I have taken every possible 
step to insure the security of the corps on the right bank, but I 
cannot reinforce them here until my bridges are all safe, as my 
force is too small to insure my right and rear, should the enemy 
attack in that direction, as they may probably attempt. I have 
to be very cautious now. Our loss in the late battle will probably 
exceed (5,000) five thousand. I have not yet full returns. On 
account of the effect it might have on our own men and the 
enemy, I request that you will regard this information as con- 
fidential for a few days. I am satisfied that the loss of the 
enemy was very considerably greater ; they were terribly pun- 
ished. I mention these facts now merely to show you that the 
Army of the Potomac has had serious work, and that no child's 
play is before it. 

You must make your calculations on the supposition that 
I have been correct from the beginning in asserting that the 
serious opposition was to be made here. 

And to the Secretary of War on the same day : 

June 4. Please inform me at once what reinforcements, 
if any, I can count upon having at Fortress Monroe or White 
House within the next three days, and when each regiment may 
be expected to arrive. It is of the utmost importance that I 
should know this immediately. The losses in the battle of the 
3ist and ist will amount to (7,000) seven thousand. Regard 
this as confidential for the present. 

If I can have five new regiments for Fort Monroe and its 
dependencies, I can draw three more old regiments from there 
safely. I can well dispose of four more raw regiments on my 
communications. I can well dispose of from fifteen to twenty 
well-drilled regiments among the old brigades in bringing them 
up to their original effective strength. Recruits are especially 
necessary for the regular and volunteer batteries of artillery, as 
well as for the regular and volunteer regiments of infantry. 
After the losses in our last battle I trust that I will no longer 






REINFORCEMENTS PROMISED. 387 

be regarded as an alarmist. I believe we have at least one more 
desperate battle to fight. 

On the 5th the Secretary telegraphed me : 

" I will send you five (5) new regiments as fast as transporta- 
tion can take them ; the first to start to-morrow from Baltimore. 
I intend sending you a part of McDowell's force as soon as 
it can return from its trip to Front Royal, probably as many 
as you want. The order to ship the new regiments to Fort 
Monroe has already been given. I suppose that they may be 
sent directly to the fort. Please advise me if this be as you 
desire." 

On the yth of June I telegraphed as follows : 

In reply to your despatch of two P.M. to-day, I have the 
honor to state that the Chickahominy river has risen so as to 
flood the entire bottoms to the depth of three and four feet. I 
am pushing forward the bridges in spite of this, and the men 
are working night and day, up to their waists in water, to com- 
plete them. 

The whole face of the country is a perfect bog, entirely 
impassable for artillery, or even cavalry, except directly in the 
narrow roads, which renders any general movement, either of 
this or the rebel army, entirely out of the question until we have 
more favorable weather. 

I am glad to learn that you are pressing forward reinforce- 
ments so vigorously. 

I shall be in perfect readiness to move forward and take 
Richmond the moment McCall reaches here and the ground 
will admit the passage of artillery. I have advanced my pickets 
about a mile to-day, driving off the rebel pickets and securing 
a very advantageous position. 

The rebels have several batteries established, commanding 
the debouches from two of our bridges, and fire upon our work- 
ing parties continually ; but as yet they have killed but very few 
of our men. 

As I did not think it probable that any reinforcements would 
be sent me in time for the advance on Richmond, I stated in the 
foregoing despatch that I should be ready to move when Gen. 
McCall's division joined me ; but I did not intend to be under- 
stood by this that no more reinforcements were wanted, as will 
be seen from the following despatch : 

June 10. I have again information that Beauregard has ar- 



388 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

rived, and that some of his troops are to follow him. No great 
reliance perhaps none whatever can be attached to this ; but 
it is possible, and ought to be their policy. 

I am completely checked by the weather. The roads and 
fields are literally impassable for artillery, almost so for infantry. 
The Chickahominy is in a dreadful state ; we have another rain- 
storm on our hands. 

I shall attack as soon as the weather and ground will permit ; 
but there will be a delay, the extent of which no one can foresee, 
for the season is altogether abnormal. 

In view of these circumstances, I present for your considera- 
tion the propriety of detaching largely from Halleck's army to 
strengthen this ; for it would seem that Halleck has now no 
large organized force in front of him, while we have. If this 
cannot be done, or even in connection with it, allow me to sug- 
gest the movement of a heavy column from Dalton upon Atlanta. 
If but the one can be done it would better conform to military 
principles to strengthen this army. And even although the rein- 
forcements might not arrive in season to take part in the attack 
upon Richmond, the moral effect would be great, and they would 
furnish valuable assistance in ulterior movements. 

I wish to be distinctly understood that, whenever the weather 
permits, I will attack with whatever force I may have, although a 
larger force would enable me to gain much more decisive results. 

I would be glad to have McCall's infantry sent forward by 
water at once, without waiting for his artillery and cavalry. 

If Gen. Prim returns via Washington, please converse with 
him as to the condition of affairs here. 



Our work upon the bridges continued to be pushed forward 
vigorously until the 2oth, during which time it rained almost every 
day, and the exposure of the men caused much sickness. 

On the nth the Secretary of War telegraphed : 



" Your despatch of three-thirty (3.30) yesterday has been 
received. I am fully impressed with the difficulties mentioned, 
and which no art or skill can avoid, but only endure, and am 
striving to the uttermost to render you every aid in the power of 
the government. . . . McCall's force was reported yesterday as 
having embarked and on its way to join you. It is intended to 
send the residue of McDowell's force also to join you as speedily 
as possible. 

" Fremont had a hard fight, day before yesterday, with Jack- 
son's force at Union Church, eight miles from Harrisonburg. 
He claims the victory, but was pretty badly handled. It is clear 
that a strong force is operating with Jackson for the purpose of 



MR. STAN TON'S AFFECTION. 389 

detaining the forces here from you. I am urging as fast as pos- 
sible the new levies. 

" Be assured, general, that there never has been a moment 
when my desire has been otherwise than to. aid you with my 
whole heart, mind, and strength, since the hour we first met ; 
and whatever others may say for their own purposes, you have 
never had, and never can have, any one more truly your friend, 
or more anxious to support you, or more joyful than I shall be at 
the success which I have no doubt will soon be achieved by your 
arms." 

On the 1 2th and i3th Gen. McCall's division arrived. 

On the 1 3th of June two squadrons of the 5th U. S. Cavalry, 
under the command of Capt. Royall, stationed near Hanover Old 
Church, were attacked and overpowered by a force of the enemy's 
cavalry numbering about 1,500 men, with four guns. They 
pushed on towards our depots, but at some distance from our 
main body, and, though pursued very cleverly, made the circuit 
of the army, repassing the Chickahominy at Long bridge. The 
burning of two schooners laden with forage and fourteen govern- 
ment wagons, the destruction of some sutlers' stores, the killing 
of several of the guard and teamsters at Garlick's landing, some 
little damage done at Timstall's Station, and a little eclat, were 
the precise results of this expedition. 

On the 1 4th I telegraphed to the Secretary of War : 

June 14, midnight. All quiet in every direction. The stam- 
pede of last night has passed away. Weather now very favor- 
able. I hope two days more will make the ground practicable. 
I shall advance as soon as the bridges are completed and the 
ground fit for artillery to move. At the same time I would be 
glad to have whatever troops can be sent to me. I can use 
several new regiments to advantage. 

It ought to be distinctly understood that McDowell and his 
troops are completely under my control. I received a telegram 
from him requesting that McCall's division might be placed so as 
to join him immediately on his arrival. 

That request does not breathe the proper spirit. Whatever 
troops come to me must be disposed of so as to do the most good. 
I do not feel that, in such circumstances as those in which I am 
now placed, Gen. McDowell should wish the general interests to 
be sacrificed for the purpose of increasing his command. 

If I cannot fully control all his troops I want none of them, 
but would prefer to fight the battle with what I have, and let 
others be responsible for the results. 



3QO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

The department lines should not be allowed to interfere with 
me ; but Gen. McD., and all other troops sent to me, should 
be placed completely at my disposal, to do with them as I think 
best. In no other way can they be of assistance to me. I 
therefore request that I may have entire and full control. The 
stake at issue is too great to allow personal considerations to be 
entertained ; you know that I have none. 

On the 2oth I telegraphed to the President : 

There is not the slightest reason to suppose that the enemy 
intends evacuating Richmond ; he is daily increasing his de- 
fences. I find him everywhere in force, and every reconnois- 
sance costs many lives, yet I am obliged to feel my way, foot 
by foot, at whatever cost, so great are the difficulties of the 
country ; by to-morrow night the defensive works covering our 
position on this side of the Chickahominy should be completed. 
I am forced to this by my inferiority in numbers, so that I may 
bring the greatest possible numbers into action and secure the 
army against the consequences of unforeseen disaster. 

All the information I could obtain, previous to the 24th of 
June, regarding the movements of Gen. Jackson led to the be- 
lief that he was at Gordonsville, where he was receiving rein- 
forcements from Richmond via Lynchburg and Staunton ; but 
what his purposes were did not appear until the date specified, 
when a young man, very intelligent but of suspicious appear- 
ance, was brought in by our scouts from the direction of Han- 
over Court-House. He at first stated that he was an escaped pri- 
soner from Col. Kenley's Maryland regiment, captured at Front 
Royal, but finally confessed himself to be a deserter from Jack- 
son's command, which he left near Gordonsville on the 2ist. 
Jackson's troops were then, as he said, moving to Frederick's 
Hall, along the Virginia Central Railroad, for the purpose of 
attacking my rear on the 28th. I immediately despatched two 
trusty negroes to proceed along the railroad and ascertain the 
truth of the statement. They were unable, however, to get 
beyond Hanover Court-House, where they encountered the ene- 
my's pickets, and were forced to turn back without obtaining 
the desired information. On that day I sent the following 
despatch to Secretary Stanton : 

June 24. A very peculiar case of desertion has just occurred 
from the enemy. The party states that he left Jackson, Whit- 



STONEWALL JACKSON. 391 

ing, and Ewell (fifteen brigades) at Gordonsville on the 2ist ; 
that they were moving to Frederick's Hall, and that it was in- 
tended to attack my rear on the 28th. I would be glad to learn, 
at your earliest convenience, the most exact information you have 
as to the position and movements of Jackson, as well as the 
sources from which your information is derived, that I may the 
better compare it with what I have. 

G. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. 

The following is his reply : 

"June 25. We have no definite information as to the num- 
bers or position of Jackson's force. Gen. King yesterday re- 
ported a deserter's statement that Jackson's force was, nine days 
ago, 40,000 men. Some reports place 10,000 rebels under Jack- 
son at Gordonsville ; others, that his force is at Port Republic, 
Harrisonburg, and Luray. Fremont yesterday reported rumors 
that Western Virginia was threatened, and Gen. Kelley that 
Ewell was advancing to New creek, where Fremont has his 
depots. The last telegram from Fremont contradicts this ru- 
mor. The last telegram from Banks says the enemy's pickets 
are strong in advance at Luray ; the people decline to give any 
information as to his whereabouts. Within the last two (2) 
days the evidence is strong that for some purpose the enemy is 
circulating rumors of Jackson's advance in various directions, 
with a view to conceal the real point of attack. Neither Mc- 
Dowell, who is at Manassas, nor Banks and Fremont, who 
are at Middletown, appear to have any accurate knowledge of 
the subject. A letter transmitted to the department yesterday, 
purported to be dated Gordonsville on the fourteenth (i4th) 
instant, stated that the actual attack was designed for Washing- 
ton and Baltimore as soon as you attacked Richmond, but that 
the report was to be circulated that Jackson had gone to Rich- 
mond, in order to mislead. This letter looked very much like 
a blind, and induces me to suspect that Jackson's real movement 
now is towards Richmond. It came from Alexandria, and is 
certainly designed, like the numerous rumors put afloat, to mis- 
lead. I think, therefore, that while the warning of the deserter 
to you may also be a blind, that it could not safely be disre- 
garded. I will transmit to you any further information on this 
subject that may be received here." 

On the 25th, our bridges and entrenchments being at last 
completed, an advance of our picket-line of the left was ordered, 
preparatory to a general forward movement. 

Immediately in front of the most advanced redoubt on the 



3Q2 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Williamsburg road was a large, open field ; beyond that a 
swampy belt of timber, some five hundred yards wide, which 
had been disputed ground for many days. Further in advance 
was an open field, crossed by the Williamsburg road and the 
railroad, and commanded by a redoubt and rifle-pits of the 
enemy. 

It was decided to push our lines to the other side of these 
woods, in order to enable us to ascertain the nature of the 
ground, and to place Gens. Heintzelman and Sumner in posi- 
tion to support the attack intended to be made on the Old 
Tavern, on the 26th or 271)1, by Gen. Franklin, by assailing that 
position in the rear. 

Between eight and nine o'clock on the morning of the 25th 
the advance was begun by Gen. Heintzelman's corps. The ene- 
my were found to be in strong force all along the line, and con- 
tested the advance stubbornly, but by sunset our object was 
accomplished. 

The following telegram was sent to the Secretary of War on 
the same day : 

25/7*, 6.15 P.M. I have just returned from the field, and 
found your despatch in regard to Jackson. 

Several contrabands just in give information confirming sup- 
position that Jackson's advance is at or near Hanover Court- 
House, and that Beauregard arrived with strong reinforcements 
in Richmond yesterday. 

I incline to think that Jackson will attack my right and rear. 
The rebel force is stated at two hundred thousand, including 
Jackson and Beauregard. I shall have to contend against vastly 
superior odds if these reports be true. But this army will do 
all in the power of men to hold their position and repulse any 
attack. 

I regret my great inferiority in numbers, but feel that I am 
in no way responsible for it, as I have not failed to represent 
repeatedly the necessity of reinforcements ; that this was the 
decisive point, and that all the available means of the govern- 
ment should be concentrated here. I will do all that a general 
can do with the splendid army I have the honor to command, 
and, if it is destroyed by overwhelming numbers, can at least 
die with it and share its fate. 

But if the result of the action, which will probably occur 
to-morrow or within a short time, is a disaster, the responsi- 
bility cannot be thrown on my shoulders ; it must rest where it 
belongs. 



JACKSON APPROACHING. 393 

Since I commenced this I have received additional intelli- 
gence confirming the supposition in regard to Jackson's move- 
ments and Beauregard's arrival. I shall probably be attacked 
to-morrow, and now go to the other side of the Chickahominy 
to arrange for the defence on that side. 

I feel that there is no use in my again asking for rein- 
forcements. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[May 20 to June 26, 1862.] 

May 20, 12.30 A.M., Tunstatfs Station. ... I moved head- 
quarters and four divisions here to-day, about six miles from, the 
White House. I rode myself to Bottom's bridge in the rain, 
and made a short reconnoissance of it. Found the enemy there, 
though not in great force. The engineers will make a close 
examination to-morrow morning, driving the enemy's pickets. 
The advanced guard also is near New bridge. We are gradu- 
ally drawing near the rascals. I think they intend to fight us 
in front of Richmond ; if they do it will be a decisive battle. 
Our camp here is one of the most beautiful I ever saw. The 
country is lovely, and the view from the high hill on which are 
headquarters is really magnificent. This evening, when the 
bivouac-fires were lighted, the scene was grand beyond descrip- 
tion. There are some very fine plantations in this vicinity. 
What fools their owners are to submit themselves to the neces- 
sity of being overrun and devastated ! An army leaves a wide 
swath in its rear, but my men are generally behaving very well. 

May 21, 1.30 A.M., Tunstatfs Station. . . . Headquarters 
will move to-morrow some seven or eight miles more to the 
front. . . 

Wednesday morning (same letter). . . . Porter's troops have 
been marching past for a couple of hours, and the rumbling of 
wagons has been going on for some time. . . . 

A little later. I have just learned that some of our troops 
have succeeded in crossing the Chickahominy at Bottom's 
bridge. . . . 

May 22, 6.30 P.M., camp near Chickahominy. ... I have

just returned from a ride to the front, where I have taken a 
good look at the rebel lines. I suppose I must have ridden 
some thitty miles or less to-day. 

Some one just brought me a bouquet of wild white flowers 
a negro at that. I clutched it most eagerly, as reminding me of 
one who two years ago became my wife. It is on the table in 
front of me as I write ; in a tin tumbler, to be sure, but none 
the less pure and white. 

May 23, P.M. (continuation of same letter). Soon after I 
finished the last page I was taken quite sick, and continued so 
most of the night. I have remained in my tent all. day, feeling 
quite miserable, but will be all right and able to ride out in the 
morning. . . . The occurrences of. the next few days are quite 
uncertain. I have secured one passage of the Chickahominy, 
and hope to get two more to-morrow. I have been within six 
miles of the rebel capital, and our balloonists have been watch- 
ing it all day. The intentions of the enemy are still doubtful. 
I go on prepared to fight a hard battle, but I confess that the 
indications are not now that he will fight. Unless he has some 
deep-laid scheme that I do not fathom, he is giving up great 
advantages in not opposing me on the line of the Chickahominy. 
He could give me a great deal of trouble and make it cost me 
hundreds or thousands of lives. . . . God knows that I am sick 
of this civil war, although no feeling of the kind unsteadies my 
hand or ever makes me hesitate or waver. It is a cruel necessity. 
I am very glad that the President has come out as he did about 
Hunter's order. ... If I succeed in getting the two additional 
passages of the river to-morrow I will move next day. In fact, 
I hope to have a strong advanced guard within a couple of miles 
of Richmond to-morrow evening. Then I shall be able to ex- 
amine the enemy's position and arrange for the battle. I will not 
fight on Sunday if I can help it. If I am obliged to do so I will 
still have faith that God will defend the right, and trust that we 
have the right on our side. How freely I shall breathe when my 
long task of months is over and Richmond is ours ! I know the 
uncertainty of all human events. I know that God may even 
now deem best to crush all the high hopes of the nation and this 
army. I will do the best I can to insure success, and will do my 
best to be contented, with whatever result God sees fit to ter- 



396 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

minate our efforts. I am here on the eve of one of the great 
historic battles of the world one of those crises in a nation's 
life that occur but seldom. Far more than my fate is involved 
in the issue. I have done the best I could ; I have tried to serve 
my country honestly and faithfully. All I can now do is to com- 
mit myself to the hands of God and pray that the country may 
not be punished for my sins and shortcomings. 

1 1 P.M. . . . Have had some skirmishes and cannonading 
to-day. Successful in all. 

May 25, Sunday, 3.30 P.M., Cold Harbor. . . . Have been 
rather under the weather the last three days. Had to ride out 
in the rain yesterday, and was kept up very late last night, so I 
was not so well as I might have been this morning. ... It 
cleared off about sunset yesterday, and to-day has been bright 
and pleasant, drying up the roads rapidly. They have been so 
cut and bad as to prevent any movements in force or with 
rapidity. Fortunately the ground dries rapidly here, and will 
soon be in such condition that we can move anywhere. I have 
this moment received a despatch from the President, who is ter- 
ribly scared about Washington, and talks about the necessity of 
my returning in order to save it. Heaven save a country gov- 
erned by such counsels ! I must reply to his telegram, and finish 
this by and by. ... I feel much better this afternoon quite 
myself again. ... If I should find Washington life as bad after 
the war as it was when I was there, I don't think I could be 
induced to remain in the army after peace. 

10 P.M. (same letter). It seems, from some later despatches 
I have received, that Banks has been soundly thrashed, and 
that they are terribly alarmed in Washington. A scare will do 
them good, and may bring them to their senses. ... I have a 
fire in my tent to-night. 

May 26, 8 P.M., camp near New bridge. . . . We broke up 
the last camp about two and moved to this place, which is quite 
on the banks of the Chickahominy and very near New bridge. 
It, of course, commenced raining about an hour after we started ; 
but as it was not a very heavy rain, we got on very well. ... I 
have been troubled by the old Mexican complaint, brought on, 
I suppose, by exposure to the wet, but I am really substantially

well again. . . . Fitz starts off in the morning on a trip that will 
take a day to go and one to return ; the object being to cut off 
and disperse a force of the enemy threatening my right, and rear, 
also to destroy the railroad bridges. When this is done I will 
feel very comfortable in that direction, and shall be quite ready 
to attack. My men are in such excellent condition and such 
good spirits that I cannot doubt the result. The people here 
have not much Union feeling, but are becoming heartily tired of 
the war, especially as they now feel its evils in their midst a 
fate from which I pray that God may deliver our own Northern 
States. My camp is about four and a half to five miles from 
Richmond. . . . Had the instructions I left for Banks and 
VVadsworth been complied with we should have been spared the 
shame of Banks's stampede. ... I feared last night that I would 
be ordered back for the defence of Washington ! 

May 27, 11.45 P.M. ... I sent Fitz-John out this morning 
to " pick up " a large force of the enemy who were threaten- 
ing my right and rear, also to burn the bridges of the two 
railways of the South Anna. The old fellow has done splen- 
didly. Thrashed 13,000 badly, and I am momentarily expect- 
ing to hear the details of his second attack. We are getting on 
splendidly. I am quietly clearing out everything that could 
threaten my rear and communications, providing against the 
contingency of disaster, and so arranging as to make my whole 
force available in the approaching battle. The only fear is that 
Joe's heart may fail him. . . . 

New bridge, May 29, 8 P.M. ... I rode some forty-odd 
miles yesterday, got wet, had nothing to eat all day, and returned 
to camp about two o'clock this morning, noble old Dan tak- 
ing me through most splendidly. Found myself quite sick this 
morning my old Mexican enemy. I had been fighting against 
it for several days with more or less success. But this morning 
I gave up and sent for the doctor, in whose hands I placed 
myself. . . . Feel a great deal better to-night ; the pain gone 
and my head clearer. . . . Fitz did his work nobly, as I ex- 
pected. I rode to his battle-field yesterday and several miles 
beyond it. The railroad bridge across the South Anna was 
burned yesterday and to day, thus effectually cutting off rail- 



398 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

road communication between Richmond and the North. Law- 
rence Williams arranged both affairs very handsomely. The 
country around Hanover Court-House is very beautiful. . . . 

June 2, 8 P.M., New bridge. It has been impossible for me 
to write to you for the last two or three days. I was quite sick 
on Friday and Saturday ; on the last day rose from my bed and 
went to the field of battle ; remained on horseback most of the 
time until Sunday evening. I came back perfectly worn out and 
exhausted ; lay down at once, and, though I could not sleep 
much I got some rest. I think to-night will bring me quite up 
again ; I am not anxious. The Chickahominy is now falling, 
and I hope we can complete the bridges to-morrow. I can do 
nothing more until that is accomplished. The enemy attacked 
on Saturday and Sunday with great ferocity and determination ; 
their first attack alone was successful. Casey's division broke. 
As the other divisions came up they checked the enemy, and we 
gradually got the better of him ; he was badly handled before 
night. On Sunday morning he renewed the attack and was 
everywhere repulsed in disorder and with heavy loss. We had 
regained all the ground lost, and more, last night ; to-day we are 
considerably in advance of the field of battle. It is certain that 
we have gained a glorious victory ; I only regret that the rascals 
were smart enough to attack when the condition of the Chicka- 
hominy was such that I could not throw over the rest of the 
troops to follow up the success ; but the weather now seems 
settled, and I hope the river will be low enough to-morrow to 
enable me to cross. I am tired of the sickening sight of the 
battle-field, with its mangled corpses and poor suffering wound- 
ed ! Victory has no charms for me when purchased at such cost. 
I shall be only too glad when all is over and I can return where 
I best love to be. . . . Your father is quite well ; so are all the 
staff. I don't think any of your friends were hurt in the battle ; 
several colonels killed and some wounded. 

June 3, 10 A.M., New bridge. . . . There has been some 
heavy cannonading within the last hour, and I learned that the 
enemy were advancing on Sumner. I am awaiting further news 
before going to the front ; in the meantime working hard at 
the bridges over the confounded Chickahominy. We may have 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 399 

another fight at any hour now ; I can't tell when or where. I 
expect some 5,500 troops from Fortress Monroe to-night, which 
will go some ways towards replacing my losses ; hope that one 
regiment arrived last night. If the enemy will give me time to 
get these fresh troops in line I will be obliged to them exceed- 
ingly ; I am none too strong, I can assure you. But all will go 
well. . . . 

June 5, 9 A.M. ( Thursday), New bridge. We have had a ter- 
rible time during the last few days : torrents of rain constantly 
falling ; ground a sea of mud ; the Chickahominy a booming 
river ; bridges swept away ; the railroad pretty much used up 
in short, about all the troubles that armies fall heir to, except 
defeat ! But I am so grateful that God gave us the victory that 
I will not complain of minor evils. The enemy must have been 
very badly whipped not to have renewed his attack under the 
very favorable circumstances of the last few days. 

P.M". Have been, as usual, interrupted. . . . The enemy has 
opened from two or three batteries, and is blazing away upon our 
working parties at the bridges ; some of our heavy batteries have 
opened upon him, and will, I hope, soon silence them. I feel 
much better to-day, and if secesh will permit me to remain quiet 
until to-morrow morning I am sure that I shall be quite well. 
My head feels clearer to-day, and I feel generally better, though 
somewhat weak. My report of the battle (telegraphic) was in- 
correctly printed in some respects in the papers, and, of course, 
raises a tempest in a teapot. I never saw so much selfishness 
and petty feeling in my life as I have seen developed during this 
unhappy war. . . . This camp-life in the mud is becoming tedi- 
ous ; yet here I am tied up, the confounded river running like 
mad, and no present chance of crossing the rest of the troops, 
although we are doing all that can be done. . . . The artillery 
still keeps up its firing. I must send again for news. . . . 

June 6. . . . The bad weather still continues, horrid in the 
extreme. ... It seems that Joe Johnston was seriously, if not 
dangerously, wounded in the last battle. I had occasion to write 
him some letters to-day which ought to be answered, so I can 
probably tell by the reply how it really is. ... I am receiving 



4OO MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

reinforcements now which will soon repair our losses and enable 
me to act with freedom of motion. . . . 

10 P.M. . . . Have been, as usual, very quiet to-day, lying 
down almost all the time, and leaving my tent scarcely at all. 
... It has at last cleared up, and for some days, I think. . . . 
It is now quite certain that Joe Johnston was severely wounded 
last Saturday now said to be in the shoulder by a rifle-ball. I 
think there is very little doubt that it is so. That places Smith, 
G. W., in command. I have drawn nine regiments from Fort 
Monroe the first use I made of the command given me of that 
place ; the last of them will be up to-morrow. These will go far 
towards filling our ranks. The losses in the late battle were 
about 5,500 ; of course we have lost many by disease. I am pro- 
mised either McCall's or King's division in a very few days. If 
I learn to-morrow that they will surely be here in three or four 
days I will wait for them, as it would make the result certain and 
less bloody. I can't afford to have any more men killed than 
can be avoided. . . . 

June 7, 8.30 A.M. (same letter). . . . The sun is struggling 
very hard this morning with the clouds ; thus far the latter has 
rather the better of him, but I hope the old fellow will persevere 
and beat them out in an hour or two. I presume the mystery of 
the two telegraphic messages has been cleared up before this. I 
said that none of your acquaintances were killed. The operator 
must have been unmanned by excitement, for my official de- 
spatches were terribly bungled in many ways. One of the two 
similar despatches must have been sent on the operator's own 
account. I think I sent you but two altogether that day. Did 
not that solution occur to you ? 

June 8, 1862. Gen. Prim and staff, some nine or ten in 
number, have arrived. They went direct to the battle-field from 
the railway, so I will be spared until evening, when I shall be in 
for it. How Charles will make out I cannot imagine. It is a 
terrible nuisance to take care of these parties in camp. They 
always come entirely unprovided, and it puts every one to great 
inconvenience to take care of them. I had sense enough, when I 
went to the Crimea; to take tents, messing apparatus, servants,

horses, etc., so that I was perfectly independent. But none of 
these foreigners seem to follow so good an example. . . . 

I had occasion day before yesterday to send a letter to Joe 
Johnston in reply to a request of us for permission to send in 
and get the bodies of a couple of generals and half a dozen 
colonels supposed to be killed. An answer came yesterday 
apologizing for the delay in replying to my communication 
(which involved other matters), and also apologizing for some of 
his people firing at Sweitzer, who carried the flag of truce. Well, 
whom do you think the letter came from ? From no one else 
than A. P. Hill, major-general commanding the Light Division. 
... I hope we shall have clear weather for a few days, so that 
it will be possible to move and use artillery, as well as to get it 
over the river. You have no idea of the state of the ground 
now ; just as much as a horse can do to make his way ! We have 
pretty quiet times ; a little artillery-firing and picket-skirmishing 
by way of breaking the monotony voila tout ! I suppose both 
sides are gathering for the great battle. I have received ten 
regiments since the battle, nine of which from Fort Monroe, 
one from Baltimore ; and one from Washington will arrive to- 
night. I am also promised McCall's division at once. If the 
promise is kept I shall be quite strong again. . . . Am much 
better to-day quite myself. 

June 9. ... A large dose of Spaniards yesterday. Gen. 
Prim and staff arrived and are quartered on us, some seven in 
all a rather inconvenient addition to the mess. On the other 
hand, however, they are very gentlemanly and a very nice set of 
people. Gen. Prim speaks only French and Spanish. He is 
a dark-faced, black-haired, bright, young-looking man of forty- 
five. I like him much. His chief of staff, Gen. Milans, is a per- 
fect old trump, who speaks English and looks for all the world 
like a French marquis of the stage. His hair and beard are iron 
gray ; his moustache of the most approved pattern of the Span- 
ish cavaliers of old ; a cane suspended to his button-hole ; red 
pants tucked in high boots ; a loose green coat covered with 
silver embroidery ; the funniest little hat imaginable on the 
whole a most peculiar picture, such as I never saw before. They 
are delighted with what they have seen (I hear the funny little 
fellow's voice now : " G'd-mornin', sir ; hope yo* well "), fully

appreciate the great difficulties under which we have been labor- 
ing, and will do much, I think, towards giving a just idea in 
Europe of the difficulties we have to contend against in this 
most singular of all campaigns. ... I had a telegram from 
McDowell last evening stating that he was ordered down here 
with his command, and assuring me that he received the order 
with great satisfaction. The secretary and President are becom- 
ing quite amiable of late ; I am afraid that I am a little cross to 
them, and that I do not quite appreciate their sincerity and good 
feeling. " Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes" How glad I will be 
to get rid of the whole lot ! I had another letter from our friend 
A. P. H. yesterday in reply to mine to Joe Johnston ; so I am 
now confident that Joe is badly wounded. In my reply sent this 
morning I ignore Hill entirely, and address mine to the " Com- 
manding General, etc.," so G. W. will have to come out this 
time. I hope to arrange for a general exchange of prisoners, 
and thus relieve our poor fellows who have been so long con- 
fined. I must do secesh the justice to say that they now treat 
our wounded and prisoners as well as they can. . . . 

June 10, 7.30 A.M. ... It is again raining hard, and has 
been for several hours ! I feel almost discouraged that is, I 
would do so did I not feel that it must all be for the best, and 
that God has some great purpose in view through all this. It is 
certain that there has not been for years and years such a season ; 
it does not come by chance. I am quite checked by it. First, 
the Chickahominy is so swollen and the valley so covered with 
water that I cannot establish safe communications over it ; then, 
again, the ground is so muddy that we cannot use our artillery : 
the guns sink up to their axle-trees. I regret all this extremely, 
but take comfort from the thought that God will not leave so 
great a struggle as this to mere chance. If He ever interferes 
with the destinies of men and nations, this would seem to be a fit 
occasion for it. So whenever I feel discouraged by adverse cir- 
cumstances I do my best to fall back on this great source of con- 
fidence, and always find that it gives me strength to bear up 
against anything that may occur. I do not see how any one can 
fill such a position as I do without being constantly forced to 
think of higher things and the Supreme Being. The great 
responsibility, the feeling of personal weakness and incompe-

tency, of entire dependence on the will of God, the thousand 
circumstances entirely beyond our control that may defeat our 
best-laid plans, the sight of poor human suffering all these 
things will force the mind to seek rest above. ... I feel quite 
well to-day, by far better than at any time before. I think that 
if I can stand the test of this rainy day all must be right. I 
will not go out while it rains, if I can help it. ... The Span- 
iards are still here, and I fear will remain some time, unless this 
rain drives them off. Prim is very well, but it is a nuisance to 
be obliged to be polite when one's head is full of more impor- 
tant things. . . . Still raining very hard. I don't know what 
will become of us ! 

June n, New bridge, A.M. . . . Am very well to-day, and 
the weather is good. . . . Will start in half an hour or so for the 
other side of the river. It threatens rain again, so that I do not 
believe I can make the entire tour probably only on Smith and 
Sumner ; do the rest to-morrow. Besides, I do not care to ride 
too far to-day, as I have not been on horseback before since 
the day of the battle. I must be careful, for it would be utter 
destruction to this army were I to be disabled so as not to be 
able to take command. 

Burnside left yesterday ; thinks there is a great deal of Union 
feeling in North Carolina, and that our gaining possession of 
Richmond will at once bring North Carolina back into the 
Union. ... I half-doubt whether there is much Union feeling 
south of North Carolina. . . . McCall's division has commenced 
arriving ; some of them reached the White House last night. 
This relieves me very much. 

June 12, 8 A.M., New bridge. . . . Am about to break up 
this camp and move over the Chickahominy to Dr. Trent's 
house ; to the vicinity, at least, for I abominate houses when on 
the field. In addition have to take a farewell ride some seven 
or eight miles up this side of the river to look again at the 
ground and give the last instructions to Porter and Franklin for 
their guidance on this side of the river. I took quite a ride yes- 
terday, the first since the battle, and got through with it nicely. 
I am about as nearly well now as I expect to be in this climate ; 
bright and strong enough to fight a much better battle than any 



404 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

yet. I had a wonderful telegram from the Secretary of War last 
night ; he declares that he is and ever has been my best friend ! 

June 14, camp at Dr. Trent's, Saturday A.M. . . . Your 
letters reached me yesterday morning just as I was starting .out 
on a hot ride around the lines. Did not return until late, and 
then they got up a stampede on the other side of the Chicka- 
hominy which kept me busy until bed-time. Some of the enemy's 
cavalry got in to the railroad, cut the telegraph-wires, and burned 
some wagons. I do not know particulars yet, but the cavalry 
and some infantry are out after them, and will, I hope, repay 
secesh for his impudence. As it is, the telegraph is broken and 
may not be re-established for several hours. ... It is terribly 
hot, so much so that one can hardly exist. I was up before six 
this morning, and even then found it overpowering ; the sun 
bakes down. I have the best possible place for a camp, right 
on the summit of a high hill, under the shade of a couple of large 
walnut-trees, but the trouble this morning is that no air whatever 
is stirring. Am quite well now ; took a long ride in the hot sun 
yesterday and did not feel it very much ; am not quite strong 
yet, and have to be a little careful. . . . Yesterday morning 
secesh commenced a very warm fire of artillery quite early, but 
killed only one man. By and by, however, Smith got some 
of his sharpshooters near their guns, drove off the gunners and 
kept them off all day, so that there was no more firing. There 
has been none to-day. I learn that the enemy moved away 
their guns during the night ; this is probably true. A couple 
of days more of this weather will dry the roads and fields so as 
to render them practicable and enable me to try it again. I 
am heartily tired of inactivity, and shall be only too glad to 
settle this matter, have the battle, and get through with our 
work. . . . Senator Rice was here this morning. . . . 

June 15, 10.15 P.M., Camp Lincoln. . . . We have had 
several skirmishes. The rebels have attacked our pickets on 
several points, but were everywhere beaten back with the loss of 
several killed and a respectable number of prisoners. . . . 

The worst interruption of all was a " party " of ladies and 

gentlemen that had no more sense than to insist upon 

coming up here, Senator and a lot of others. All of whom 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



405 



I was really glad to see, although this was no place for them. 
I am sorry to say that when I heard of their arrival I " swore " 
a little internally, and sent Russell flying out of my tent, declar- 
ing that I would not see any of them. But soon afterwards 

Senator came here, and he was so kind and friendly that 

I was at once mollified. I talked with him some time, and he 
went back to Van Vliet's tent. I then gave to Averill my 
orders for a surprise-party to-morrow, to repay secesh for his 
raid of day before yesterday. Then went over to call on Mrs. 

. There I was in for it. I was presented to all the ladies, 

listened to Mrs. 's version of her trip to Richmond, and very 

rapidly beat a retreat, giving business as an excuse. Charles 
got up a lunch for the party, a rainstorm coming on in the 
meanwhile. When they were nearly through I took Averill 
over and talked with them for a while. Then they adjourned 
to my tent. The two dear old mesdames were just as good as 
they could be ; can I say more ? When they left they asked 
me to give them sprigs from the bower in front of my tent, so 
I send you one, too. ... I do not think our rain of to-day 
will do much harm. The chances now are that I will make 
the first advance on Tuesday or Wednesday. By that time I 
think the ground will be fit for the movements of artillery and 
that all our bridges will be completed. I think the rebels will 
make a desperate fight, but I feel sure that we will gain our 
point. Look on the maps I sent you a day or two ago, and 
find " Old Tavern," on the road from New bridge to Richmond; 
it is in that vicinity that the next battle will be fought. I 
think that they see it in that light, and that they are fully pre- 
pared to make a desperate resistance. I shall make the first 
battle mainly an artillery combat. As soon as I gain posses- 
sion of the " Old Tavern " I will push them in upon Richmond 
and behind their works ; then I will bring up my heavy guns, 
shell the city, and carry it by assault. I speak very confidently, 
but if you could see the faces of the troops as I ride among 
them you would share my confidence. They will do anything 
I tell them to do. I could not help laughing when, on the 
day of the last battle, I was riding along in front, a man jumped 
out in an interval of the cheering and addressed me quite famil- 
iarly, saying : " Halloo, George ! how are you ? You are the 
only one of the whole crowd of generals that is worth a ." 



406 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

I won't fill up the last word, but the whole command shouted, 
"That's so!" ... I think there is scarcely a man in this whole 
army who would not give his life for me, and willingly do 
whatever I ask. I have tried them more than once, and when- 
ever I am near they never fail me. The next battle will doubt- 
less be a desperate one, but I think that I can so use our 
artillery as to make the loss of life on our side comparatively 
small. . . . 



June 17, 4 P.M. The weather yesterday and to-day has been 
splendid. It is clear and bright, but a delightfully cool breeze 
has been blowing constantly. The roads and fields are drying 
beautifully. The river is falling rapidly ; our bridges are nearly 
finished, and we shall soon be on the move. 



Camp at Trent's House, June 21, 1862, 10 A.M. . . . We 
have had good weather for the last few days, and have been 
improving it as best we could. Both parties are active, but the 
nature of the country is such as to make our progress difficult in 
the extreme. I hope to knock secesh out of Old Tavern and its 
vicinity within a couple of days ; shall try it, at all events. ... I 
see the Abolitionists have got a new dodge in my behalf the 
White House business! In the first place, I never saw Col. Lee 
in my life, and, of course, never made any arrangement with 
him. The house was guarded simply from motives of respect 
for the memory of Washington, which I thought would be appre- 
ciated by every honest person in the country. The adjacent 
property has been freely used for all necessary purposes. The 
house has never been needed for a hospital, and would not ac- 
commodate over thirty or forty persons anyhow. The " spring " 
alluded to is one of a great many. There are plenty there, and 
this one is prohibited only because access to it brings people too 
near the house. I was not even sure that it was guarded, and do 
not even now know whether it is anything more than the guard 
placed over all springs near camps to prevent them from being 
misused by the men. So you have the truth of the White House 
story, all of which was in the possession of the secretary some 
ten days ago. I yesterday sent Tripler down to investigate the 
whole matter, and when I receive his report will nail the lie 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



407 



to the counter. wrote a letter to the secretary, in which 

he repeats the spring story as of his own knowledge ; that is, he 
asserts it as a fact! One thing is certain: I will some day or 
other repay some of these people with interest, and make them 
feel ashamed of themselves, if there is such a thing in their com- 
position, which I rather doubt. I can't tell you how sick I am of 
this kind of life. I suppose it is the " cross " that it is my lot to 
bear, and that I should not repine. I know it is wrong, and I do 
my best to bear everything contentedly ; but sometimes the old, 
impatient spirit will break out and I lose my temper. But I will 
keep on trying to do my best. ... 

June 22, Sunday, 3 P.M. ... By an arrival from Washing- 
ton to-day I learn that Stanton and Chase have fallen out ; that 
McDowell has deserted his friend C. and taken to S.! Alas! 
poor country that should have such rulers. I tremble for my 
country when I think of these things ; but still can trust that 
God in His infinite wisdom will not punish us as we deserve, 
but will in His own good time bring order out of chaos and 
restore peace to this unhappy country. His will be done, what- 
ever it may be ! I am as anxious as any human being can be to 
finish this war. Yet when I see such insane folly behind me I 
feel that the final salvation of the country demands the utmost 
prudence on my part, and that I must not run the slightest risk 
of disaster, for if anything happened to this army our cause 
would be lost. I got up some heavy guns to-day, and hope 
to give secesh a preliminary pounding to-morrow and to make 
one good step next day. The rascals are very strong, and out- 
number me very considerably ; they are well entrenched also, 
and have all the advantages of position, so I must be prudent ; 
but I will yet succeed, notwithstanding all they do and leave 
undone in Washington to prevent it. I would not have on my 
conscience what those men have for all the world. I am sorry 
that I shall lose the dear old Prince de Joinville in a few days ; 
he is obliged to return to Europe. Gen. Prim has sent me his 
photograph. . . . 

It is quite hot this afternoon. ... It is almost time for our 
evening skirmish. Secesh has been very quiet to-day ; scarcely 
fired a shot. I am very glad of it, as it has enabled me to give 
my men a good, quiet rest for Sunday. 



408 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

June 23, 3 P.M. I am delighted that you are so much pleased 
at Orange. It must be a lovely place from your description. 
Will the doctor invite me to pay you a visit there, do you think ? 
How do you occupy yourself? Or are you contented just to 
rest and be quiet ? That is my idea of happiness now rest with 
you and the baby. We have had rather an exciting day of it. 
The enemy has been making some rather mysterious movements, 
and I have taken advantage of them to push forward our pickets 
considerably on the left. I don't yet know exactly what it means, 
but so far it has been of advantage to us, and you may be sure 
that I won't be caught in any trap. We have had a sharp thun- 
der-shower this afternoon, and it will be of benefit by cooling 
and clearing the air. There has not been rain enough to do 
any harm yet. 



10.30 P.M. . . . You may be sure that no man in this army 
is so anxious as its general to finish the campaign. Every poor 
fellow that is killed or wounded almost haunts me ! My only 
consolation is that I have honestly done my best to save as many 
lives as possible, and that many others might have done less 
towards it. 

I have had a rather anxious day, the movements of the enemy 
being mysterious ; but I have gained something, and am ready for 
any eventuality, I think. I have a kind of presentiment that to- 
morrow will bring forth something what, I do not know. We 
will see when the time arrives. I expect to be able to take a 
decisive step in advance day after to-morrow, and, if I succeed, 
will gain a couple of miles towards Richmond. It now looks to 
me as if the operations would resolve themselves into a series of 
partial attacks rather than a general battle. 

24t/i, 10 A.M. I was interrupted just here by some stampede 
telegrams that kept me up until 1.30 or 2 this morning. In the 
meantime a terrible storm came up and blew this unhappy sheet 
into the mud and rain. I send it as it is, however, as a slight 
specimen of the "sacred soil," also because I am about starting 
out on a ride, from which I am not likely to return before, the 
mail leaves camp. Nothing; of interest this morning ; all quiet ; 
weather cloudy, and may rain to-day again. 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



409 



Telegram June 26, 1862. . . . Did not write yesterday; 
was on the battle-field all day. Have been up and in the saddle 
all night, and do not expect to be able to write more than a line 
to-day. Will probably be up all night again. . . . Our affair 
yesterday perfectly successful. 



CHAPTER XXV. 

Beginning of the Seven Days McDowell coming, but not yet Me- 
Clellan resolves on flank movement to the James river Prepara- 
tions Battle of Gaines's Mill The movement goes on McClellan 
charges Stanton with intent to sacrifice the army. 

ON the 26th, the day upon which I had decided as the time 
for our final advance, the enemy attacked our right in strong 
force, and turned my attention to the protection of our com- 
munications and depots of supply. 

The event was a bitter confirmation of the military judg- 
ment which had been reiterated to my superiors from the incep- 
tion and through the progress of the Peninsular campaign. 

I notified the Secretary of War in the following despatch : 

12 M. I have just heard that our advanced cavalry pickets 
on the left bank of Chickahominy are being driven in. It is 
probably Jackson's advanced guard. If this be true you may 
not hear from me for some days, as my communications will 
probably be cut off. The case is perhaps a difficult one, but I 
shall resort to desperate measures, and will do my best to out- 
manoeuvre, outwit, and outfight the enemy. Do not believe 
reports of disaster, and do not be discouraged if you learn that 
my communications are cut off, and even Yorktown in possession 
of the enemy. Hope for the best, and I will not deceive the 
hopes you formerly placed in me. 

On the same day I received the following despatches from 
the Secretary of War : 

" 6 P.M. Arrangements are being made as rapidly as possiblt 
to send you five thousand (5,000) men as fast as they can 
brought from Manassas to Alexandria and embarked, which cai 
be done sooner than to wait for transportation at Fredericksburg. 
They will be followed by more, if needed. McDowell, Banks, 
and Fremont's force will be consolidated as the Army of Virginia, 
and will operate promptly in your aid by land. Nothing will be 
spared to sustain you, and I have undoubting faith in your suc- 
cess. Keep me advised fully of your condition." 

" 1 1. 20 P.M. Your telegram of 6.15 has just been received. 



PRRPARA TIONS ON JAMES RIVER. 41 I 

The circumstances that have hitherto rendered it impossible for 
the government to send you any more reinforcements than has 
been done, have been so distinctly stated to you by the President 
that it is needless for me to repeat them, 

" Every effort has been made by the President and myself to 
strengthen you. King's division has reached Falmouth ; Shields's 
division and Ricketts's division are at Manassas. The President 
designs to send a part of that force to aid you as speedily as it 
can be done." 

The following was sent at 2.30 P.M.: 

Your despatch and that of the President received. Jackson 
is driving in my pickets, etc., on the other side of the Chicka- 
hominy. It is impossible to tell where reinforcements ought to 
go, as I am yet unable to predict result of approaching battle. 
It will probably be better that they should go to Fort Monroe, 
and thence according to state of affairs when they arrive. 

It is not probable that I can maintain telegraphic com- 
munication more than an hour or two longer. 

But 5,000 of the reinforcements spoken of in these communi- 
cations came to the Army of the Potomac, and these reached 
us at Harrison's Bar after the Seven Days. 

In anticipation of a speedy advance on Richmond, to provide 
for the contingency of our communications with the depot at the 
White House being severed by the enemy, and at the same time 
to be prepared for a change of the base of our operations to 
James river, if circumstances should render it advisable, I had 
made arrangements more than a week previous (on the i8th) to 
have transports with supplies of provisions and forage, under a 
convoy of gunboats, sent up James river. They reached Har- 
rison's Landing in time to be available for the army on its arrival 
at that point. Events soon proved this change of base to be, 
though most hazardous and difficult, the only prudent course. 

Early on the 25th Gen. Porter was instructed to send out 
reconnoitring parties towards Hanover Court-House to discover 
the position and force of the enemy, and to destroy the bridges 
on the Tolopotamy as far as possible. 

Up to the 26th of June the operations against Richmond 
had been conducted along the roads leading to it from the east 
and northeast. The superiority of the James river route, as 
a line of attack and supply, is too obvious to need exposition. 



412 McCLELLAN'S OWX STORY 

My own opinion on that subject had been early given. The 
dissipation of all hope of the co-operation by land of Gen. 
McDowell's forces, deemed to be occupied in the defence of 
Washington, their inability to hold or defeat Ja,ckson, disclosed 
an opportunity to the enemy, and a new danger to my right, 
and to the long line of supplies from the White House to the 
Chickahominy, and forced an immediate change of base across 
the Peninsula. To that end, from the evening of the 26th, every 
energy of the army was bent. 

Such a change of base, in the presence of a p nverful enemy, 
is one of the most difficult undertakings in war, but I was con- 
fident in the valor and discipline of my brave army, and knew 
that it could be trusted equally to retreat or advance, and to 
fight the series of battles now inevitable, whether retreating from 
victories or marching through defeats ; and, in short, I had no 
doubt whatever of its ability, even against superior numbers, to 
fight its way through to the James, and get a position whence a 
successful advance upon Richmond would be again possible. 
Their superb conduct through the next seven days justified my 
faith. 

On the same day (26th) Gen. Van Vliet, chief-quartermaster 
of the Army of the Potomac, by my orders telegraphed to Col. 
Ingalls, quartermaster at the White House, as follows : 

" Run the cars to the last moment, and load them with provi- 
sions and ammunition. Load every wagon you have with sub- 
sistence, and send them to Savage's Station by way of Bottom's 
bridge. If you are obliged to abandon White House burn every- 
thing that you cannot get off. You must throw all our supplies 
up the James river as soon as possible, and accompany them 
yourself with all your force. It will be of vast importance to 
establish our depots on James river without delay, if we abandon 
White House. I will keep you advised of every movement so 
long as the wires work ; after that you must exercise your own 
judgment." 

All these commands were obeyed. On the 26th orders were 
sent to all the corps commanders on the right bank of the 
Chickahominy to be prepared to send as many troops as they 
could spare on the following day to the left bank of the river. 
Gen. Franklin received instructions to hold Gen. Slocum's divi- 
sion in readinesr by daybreak of the 27th, and, if heavy firing 



414 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

should at that time be heard in the direction of Gen. Porter, to 
move at once to his assistance without further orders. 

At noon on the 26th the approach of the enemy, who had 
crossed above Meadow bridge, was discovered by the advanced 
pickets at that point, and at 12.30 P.M. they were attacked and 
driven in. All the pickets were now called in, and the regiment 
and battery at Mechanicsville withdrawn. 

Meade's brigade was ordered up as a reserve in rear of the 
line, and shortly after Martindale's and Griffin's brigades, of 
Morell's division, were moved forward and deployed on the right 
of McCall's division, towards Shady Grove church, to cover that 
flank. Neither of these three brigades, however, were warmly 
engaged, though two of Griffin's regiments relieved a portion of 
Reynolds's line just at the close of the action. 

The position of our troops was a strong one, extending along 
the left bank of Beaver Dam creek, the left resting on the Chicka- 
hominy and the right in thick woods beyond the upper road from 
Mechanicsville to Cold Harbor The lower or river road crossed 
the creek at Ellison's Mill. Seymour's brigade held the left of 
the line from the Chickahominy to beyond the mill, partly in 
woods and partly in clear ground, and Reynolds's the right, prin- 
cipally in the woods and covering the upper road. The artillery 
occupied positions commanding the roads and the open ground 
across the creek. 

Timber had been felled, rifle-pits dug, and the position gene- 
rally prepared with a care that greatly contributed to the success 
of the day. The passage of the creek was difficult along the 
whole front, and impracticable for artillery, except by the two 
roads where the main efforts of the enemy were directed. 

At three P.M. he formed his line of battle, rapidly advanced 
his skirmishers, and soon attacked our whole line, making at the 
same time a determined attempt to force the passage of the 
upper road, which was successfully resisted by Gen. Reynolds. 
After a severe struggle he was forced to retire with very heavy 
loss. 

A rapid artillery-fire, with desultory skirmishing, was main- 
tained along the whole front, while the enemy massed his troops 
for another effort at the lower road about two hours later, which 
was likewise repulsed by Gen. Seymour with heavy slaughter. 

The firing ceased and the enemy retired about nine P.M., the

action having lasted six hours, with entire success to our arms. 
But few, if any, of Jackson's troops were engaged on this day. 
The portion of the enemy encountered were chiefly from the 
troops on the right bank of the river, who crossed near Meadow 
bridge and at Mechanicsville. 

The information in my possession soon after the close of this 
action convinced me that Jackson was really approaching in large 
force. The position on Beaver Dam creek, although so success- 
fully defended, had its right flank too much in the air and was 
too far from the main army to make it available to retain it 
longer. I therefore determined to send the heavy guns at 
Hogan's and Gaines's houses over the Chickahominy during the 
night, with as many of the wagons of the 5th corps as possible, 
and to withdraw the corps itself to a position stretching around 
the bridges, where its flanks would be reasonably secure and it 
would be within supporting distance of the main army. Gen. 
Porter carried out my orders to that effect. 

It was not advisable at that time, even had it been practi- 
cable, to withdraw the 5th corps to the right bank of the Chicka- 
hominy. Such a movement would have exposed the rear of the 
army, placed as between two fires, and enabled Jackson's fresh 
troops to interrupt the movement to James river by crossing the 
Chickahominy in the vicinity of Jones's bridge before we could 
reach Malvern Hill with our trains. I determined then to resist 
Jackson with the 5th corps, reinforced by all our disposable 
troops in the new position near the bridge-heads, in order to 
cover the withdrawal of the trains and heavy guns, and to give 
time for the arrangements to secure the adoption of the James 
river as our line of supplies in lieu of the Pamunkey. 

The greater part of the heavy guns and wagons having been 
removed to the right bank of the Chickahominy, the delicate 
operation of withdrawing the troops from Beaver Dam creek 
was commenced shortly before daylight and successfully exe- 
cuted. 

Meade's and Griffin's brigades were the first to leave the 
ground. Seymour's brigade covered the rear, with the horse- 
batteries of Capts. Robertson and Tidball ; but the withdrawal 
was so skilful and gradual, and the repulse of the preceding day 
so complete, that, although the enemy followed the retreat closely 
and some skirmishing occurred, he did not appear in front of the 



4-1 6 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

new line in force till about noon of the 27th, when we were pre- 
pared to receive him. 

About this time Gen. Porter, believing that Gen. Stoneman 
would be cut off from him, sent him orders to fall back on the 
White House and afterwards rejoin the army as best he could. , 

On the morning of the 2yth of June, during the withdrawal of 
his troops from Mechanicsville to the selected position already 
mentioned, Gen. Porter telegraphed as follows : 

" I hope to do without aid, though 1 request that Franklin or 
some other command be held ready to reinforce me. The enemy 
are so close that I expect to be hard pressed in front. I hope to 
have a portion in position to cover the retreat. This is a deli- 
cate movement, but, relying on the good qualities of the com- 
manders of divisions and brigades, I expect to get back and hold 
the new line." 

This shows how closely Porter's retreat was followed. 

Notwithstanding all the efforts used during the entire night 
to remove the heavy gwns and wagons, some of the siege-guns 
were still in position at Gaines's house after sunrise, and were 
finally hauled off by hand. The new position of the 5th corps 
was about an arc of a circle, covering the approaches to the 
bridges which connected our right wing with the troops on the 
opposite side of the river. 

Morell's division held the left of the line in a strip of woods 
on the left bank of the Gaines's Mill stream, resting its left flank 
on the descent to the Chickahominy, which was swept by our 
artillery on both sides of the river, and extending into open 
ground on the right towards New Cold Harbor. In this line 
Gen. Butterfield's brigade held the extreme left ; Gen. Martin- 
dale's joined his right, and Gen. Griffin, still further to the 
right, joined the left of Gen. Sykes's division, which, partly in 
woods and partly in open ground, extended in rear of Cold 
Harbor. 

Each brigade had in reserve two of its own regiments ; 
McCall's division, having been engaged on the day before, was 
formed in a second line in rear of the first ; Meade's brigade 
on the left, near the Chickahominy ; Reynolds's brigade on the 
right, covering the approaches from Cold Harbor and Despatch 
Station to Sumner's bridge, and Seymour's in reserve to the 



THE SEVEN DAYS. 417 

second line still further in rear. Gen. P. St. G. Cooke, with 
five companies of the 5th Regular Cavalry, two squadrons of 
the ist Regular Cavalry, and three squadrons of the ist Penn. 
Cavalry (lancers), were posted behind a hill in rear of the posi- 
tion, and near the Chickahominy, to aid in watching the left flank 
and defending the slope to the river. 

The troops were all in position by noon, with the artillery 
on the commanding ground, and in the intervals between the 
divisions and brigades. Besides the division batteries there 
were Robertson's and Tidball's horse-batteries from the artil- 
lery reserve ; the latter posted on the right of Sykes's division, 
and the former on the extreme left of the line, in the valley of 
the Chickahominy. 

Shortly after noon the enemy was discovered approaching 
in force, and it soon became evident that the entire position 
was to be attacked. His skirmishers advanced rapidly, and 
soon the fire became heavy along our whole front. At two P.M. 
Gen. Porter asked for reinforcements. Slocum's division of the 
6th corps was ordered to cross to the left bank of the river by 
Alexander's bridge, and proceed to his support. 

Gen. Porter's first call for reinforcements, through Gen. Bar- 
nard, did not reach me, nor his demand for more axes through 
the same officer. By three P.M. the engagement had become so 
severe, and the enemy were so greatly superior in numbers, that 
the entire second line and reserves had been moved forward 
to sustain the first line against repeated and desperate assaults 
along the whole front. 

At 3.30 Slocum's division reached the field, and was imme- 
diately brought into action at the weak points of our line. 

On the left the contest was for the strip of woods running 
almost at right angles to the Chickahominy, in front of Adams's 
house, or between that and Gaines's house. The enemy several 
times charged up to this wood, but were each time driven back 
with heavy loss. The regulars of Sykes's division, on the right, 
also repulsed several strong attacks. 

But our own loss under the tremendous fire of such greatly 
superior numbers was very severe, and the troops, most of whom 
had been under arms more than two days, were rapidly becom- 
ing exhausted by the masses of fresh men constantly brought 
against them. 



41 8 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

When Gen. Slocum's division arrived on the ground it 
increased Gen. Porter's force to some 35,000, who were proba- 
bly contending against about 70,000 of the enemy. The line 
was severely pressed in several points ; and as its being pierced 
at any one would have been fatal, it was unavoidable for Gen. 
Porter, who was required to hold his position until night, to 
divide Slocum's division, and send parts of it, even single regi- 
ments, to the points most threatened. 

About five P.M., Gen. Porter having reported his position as 
critical, French's and Meagher's brigades, of Richardson's divi- 
sion (3d corps), were ordered to cross to his support. The 
enemy attacked again in great force at six P.M., but failed to 
break our lines, though our loss was very heavy. 

About seven P.M. they threw fresh troops against Gen. Porter 
with still greater fury, and finally gained the woods held by our 
left. This reverse, aided by the confusion that followed an 
unsuccessful charge by five companies of the 5th Cavalry, and 
followed, as it was, by more determined assaults on the remain- 
der of our lines, now outflanked, caused a general retreat from 
our position to the hill in rear overlooking the bridge. 

French's and Meagher's brigades now appeared, driving 
before them the stragglers who were thronging towards the 
bridge. 

These brigades advanced boldly to the front, and by their 
example,' as well as by the steadiness of their bearing, reani- 
mated our own troops and warned the enemy that reinforce- 
ments had arrived. It was now dusk. The enemy, already 
repulsed several times with terrible slaughter, and hearing the 
shouts of the fresh troops, failed to follow up their advantage. 
This gave an opportunity to rally our men behind the brigades 
of Gens. French and Meagher, and they again advanced up the 
hill, ready to repulse another attack. During the night our 
thin and exhausted regiments were all withdrawn in safety, and 
by the following morning all had reached the other side of the 
stream. The regular infantry formed the rear-guard, and about 
six o'clock on the morning of the 28th crossed the river, destroy- 
ing the bridge behind them. 

Although we were finally forced from our first line after the 
enemy had been repeatedly driven back, yet the objects sought 
for had been obtained. The enemy was held at bay. Our 



THE SE YEN DA VS. 419 

siege-guns and material were saved, and the right wing had 
now joined the main body of the army. 

The number of guns captured by the enemy at this battle 
was twenty-two, three of which were lost by being run off the 
bridge during the final withdrawal. 

Great credit is due for the efficiency and bravery with which 
this important arm of the service (the artillery) was fought, and 
it was not until the last successful charge of the enemy that the 
cannoneers were driven from their pieces or struck down and 
the guns captured. Dietrich's, Kauerhem's, and Grimm's batter- 
ies took position during the engagement in the front of Gen. 
Smith's line on the right bank of the stream, and, with a battery 
of siege-guns served by the ist Conn. Artillery, helped to drive 
back the enemy in front of Gen. Porter. 

So threatening were the movements of the enemy on both 
banks of the Chickahominy that it was impossible to decide 
until the afternoon where the real attack would be made. Large 
forces of infantry were seen during the day near the Old Tavern, 
on Franklin's right, and threatening demonstrations were fre- 
quently made along the entire line on this side of the river, 
which rendered it necessary to hold a considerable force in posi- 
tion to meet them. 

On the 26th a circular had been sent to the corps command- 
ers on the right bank of the river, asking them how many of their 
troops could be spared to reinforce Gen. Porter after retaining 
sufficient to hold their positions for twenty-four hours. 

Gen. Heintzelman replied : 

" I think I can hold the entrenchments with four brigades for 
twenty-four hours. That would leave two brigades disposable 
for service on the other side of the river, but the men are so 
tired and worn out that I fear they would not be in a condition 
to fight after making a march of any distance. . . ." 

Telegrams from Gen. Heintzelman on the 25th and 26th had 
indicated that the enemy was in large force in front of Gens. 
Hooker and Kearny, and on the Charles City road (Longstreet, 
Hill, and Huger), and Gen. Heintzelman expressed the opinion 
on the night of the 25th that he could not hold his advanced 
position without reinforcements. 

Gen. Keyes telegraphed : 



42O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

"As to how many men will be able to hold this position for 
twenty-four hours, I must answer, All I have, if the enemy is as 
strong as ever in front, it having at all times appeared to me that 
our forces on this flank are small enough." 

On the morning of the 2yth the following despatch was sent 
to Gen. Sumner : " Gen. Smith just reports that ' six or eight 
regiments have moved down to the woods in front of Gen. Sum- 
ner.' " At eleven o'clock A.M. Gen. Sumner telegraphed : *' The 
enemy threatens an attack on my right near Smith." At 12.30 
P.M. he telegraphed : " Sharp shelling on both sides." At 2.45 
P.M.: " Sharp musketry-firing in front of Burns. We are replying 
with artillery and infantry. The man on the look-out reports 
some troops drawn up in line of battle about opposite my right 
and Smith's left ; the number cannot be made out." 

In accordance with orders given on the night of the 26th, 
Gen. Slocum's division commenced crossing the river, to support 
Gen. Porter, soon after daybreak on the morning of the 2jth ; 
but, as the firing in front of Gen. Porter ceased, the movement 
was suspended. At two P.M. Gen. Porter called for reinforce- 
ments. I ordered them at once, and at 3.25 P.M. sent him the 
following : 

" Slocum is now crossing Alexander's bridge with his whole 
command. Enemy has commenced an infantry attack on Smith's 
left. I have ordered down Sumner's and Heintzelman's re- 
serves, and you can count on the whole of Slocum's. Go on 
as you have begun." 

During the day the following despatches were received, which 
will show the condition of affairs on the right bank of the Chicka- 
hominy : 

Gen. Franklin telegraphed : " Gen. Smith thinks the enemy 
are massing heavy columns in the clearings to the right of James 
Garnett's house and on the other side of the river opposite 
it. Three regiments are reported to be moving from Sumner's 
to Smith's front. The arrangements are very good made by 
Smith." 

Afterwards he telegraphed : " The enemy has begun an at- 
tack on Smith's left with infantry. I know no details." After- 
wards the following : " The enemy has opened on Smith from a 



THE SEVEN DAYS. 



421 



battery of three pieces to the right of the White House. Our 
shells are bursting well, and Smith thinks Sumner will soon have 
a cross-fire upon them that will silence them." 

Afterwards (at 5.50 P.M.) the following was sent to Gen. 
Keyes : " Please send one brigade of Couch's division to these 
headquarters without a moment's delay. A staff officer will be 
here to direct the brigade where to go." 

Subsequently the following was sent to Gens. Sumner and 
Franklin : " Is there any sign of the enemy being in force in 
your front ? Can you spare any more force to be sent to Gen. 
Porter ? Answer at once." 

At 5.15 P.M. the following was received from Gen. Franklin : 
" I do not think it prudent to take any more troops from here at 
present." 

Gen. Sumner replied : " If the general desires to trust the 
defence of my position to my front line alone, I can send French 
with three regiments and Meagher, with his brigade, to the right ; 
everything is so uncertain that I think it would be hazardous to 
do it." 

These two brigades were sent to reinforce Gen. Porter, as has 
been observed. 

At 5.25 P.M. I sent the following to Gen. Franklin : 



Porter is hard pressed ; it is not a question of prudence, but 
of possibilities. Can you possibly maintain your position until 
dark with two brigades ? I have ordered eight regiments of 
Sumner's to support Porter ; one brigade of Couch's to this 
place. 

Heintzelman's reserve to go in rear of Sumner. If possible, 
send a brigade to support Porter. It should follow the regiments 
ordered from Sumner. 



At 7.35 P.M. the following was sent to Gen. Sumner : " If it is 
possible, send another brigade to reinforce Gen. Smith; it is said 
three heavy columns of infantry are moving on him." 

From the foregoing despatches it will be seen that all dispos- 
able troops were sent from the right bank of the river to rein- 
force Gen. Porter, and that the corps commanders were left with 
smaller forces to hold their positions than they deemed adequate. 
To have done more, even though Porter's reverse had been pre- 



422 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

vented, would have had the still more disastrous result of imper- 
illing the whole movement across the Peninsula. 

The operations of this day proved the numerical superiority 
of the enemy, and made it evident that while he had a large army 
on the left bank of the Chickahominy, which had already turned 
our right and was in position to intercept the communications 
with our depot at the White House, he was also in large force 
between our army and Richmond. I therefore effected a junction 
of our forces. 

This might probably have been executed on either side of the 
Chickahominy, and if the concentration had been effected on the 
left bank it is possible we might, with our entire force, have de- 
feated the enemy there ; but at that time they held the roads lead- 
ing to the White House, so that it would have been impossible to 
have sent forward supply-trains in advance of the army in that 
direction, and the guarding of those trains would have seriously 
embarrassed our operations in the battle we would have been 
compelled to fight, if concentrated on that bank of the river. 
Moreover, we would at once have been followed by the enemy's 
forces upon the Richmond side of the river operating upon our 
rear ; and if, in the chances of war, we had been ourselves de- 
feated in the effort, we would have been forced to fall back to 
the White House, and probably to Fort Monroe ; and, as both 
our flanks and rear would then have been entirely exposed, our 
entire supply-train, if not the greater part of the army itself, 
might have been lost. 

The movements of the enemy showed that they expected 
this, and, as they themselves acknowledged, they were prepared 
to cut off our retreat in that direction. 

I therefore concentrated all our forces on the right bank of 
the river. 

During the night of the 26th and morning of the 2yth all 
our wagons, heavy guns, etc., were gathered there. 

It may be asked why, after the concentration of our forces 
on the right bank of the Chickahominy, with a large part of the 
enemy drawn away from Richmond upon the opposite side, I did 
not, instead of striking for James river, fifteen miles below that 
place, at once march directly on Richmond. 

It will be remembered that at this juncture the enemy was 
on our rear, and there was every reason to believe that he would 



THE SEVEN DAYS. 423 

sever our communications with the supply-depot at the White 
House. 

We had on hand but a limited amount of rations, and if we 
had advanced directly on Richmond it would have required 
considerable time to carry the strong works around that place, 
during which our men would have been destitute of food ; and 
even if Richmond had fallen before our arms the enemy could 
still have occupied our supply communications between that 
place and the gunboats, and turned the disaster into victory. 
If, on the other hand, the enemy had concentrated all his forces 
at Richmond during the progress of our attack, and we had been 
defeated, we must in all probability have lost our trains before 
reaching the flotilla. 

The battles which continued day after day in the progress 
of our flank movement to the James, with the exception of the 
one at Gaines's Mill, were successes to our arms, and the closing 
engagement at Malvern Hill was the most decisive of all. 

On the evening of the 2jih of June I assembled the corps 
commanders at my headquarters, and informed them of the plan, 
its reasons, and my choice of route and method of execution. 

Gen. Keyes was directed to move his corps, with its artillery 
and baggage, across the White Oak Swamp bridge, and to seize 
strong positions on the opposite side of the swamp, to cover the 
passage of the other troops and trains. 

This order was executed on the 28th by noon. Before day- 
break on the 28th I went to Savage's Station, and remained there 
during the day and night, directing the withdrawal of the trains 
and supplies of the army. 

Orders were given to the different commanders to load their 
wagons with ammunition and provisions, and the necessary bag- 
gage of the officers and men, and to destroy all property which 
could not be transported with the army. Orders were also 
given to leave with those of the sick and wounded who could 
not be transported a proper complement of surgeons and atten- 
dants, with a bountiful supply of rations and medical stores. 

The large herd of 2,500 beef cattle was, by the chief com- 
missary, Col. Clark, transferred to the James river without loss. 

On the morning of the 28th, while Gen. Franklin was with- 
drawing his command from Golding's farm, the enemy opened 
upon Gen. Smith's division from Garnett's Hill, from the valtey 



424 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

above, and from Gaines's Hill on the opposite side of the Chicka- 
hominy, and shortly afterwards two Georgia regiments attempted 
to carry the works about to be evacuated, but this attack was 
repulsed by the 23d N. Y., and the 49th Penn. Volunteers on 
picket, and a section of Mott's battery. 

Porter's corps was moved across White Oak Swamp during 
the day and night, and took up positions covering the roads lead- 
ing from Richmond towards White Oak Swamp and Long bridge. 
McCall's division was ordered, on the night of the 28th, to move 
across the swamp and take a proper position to assist in covering 
the remaining troops and trains. 

During the same night the corps of Sumner and Heintzel- 
man and the division of Smith were ordered to an interior line, 
the left resting on Keyes's old entrenchments and curving to 
the right so as to cover Savage's Station. 

General Slocum's division, of Franklin's corps, was ordered to 
Savage's Station in reserve. 

They were ordered to hold this position until dark of the 29th, 
in order to cover the withdrawal of the trains, and then to fall 
back across the swamp and unite with the remainder of the army. 

On the 28th I sent the following to the Secretary of War : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
SAVAGE'S STATION, June 28, 1862, 12.20 A.M. 
Hon. E. M. Stanton, Secretary of War : 

I now know the full history of the day. On this side of the 
river (the right bank) we repulsed several strong attacks. On the 
left bank our men did all that men could do, all that soldiers 
could accomplish, but they were overwhelmed by vastly superior 
numbers, even after I brought my last reserves into action. The 
loss on both sides is terrible. I believe it will prove to be the 
most desperate battle of the war. The sad remnants of my men 
behave as men. Those battalions who fought most bravely and 
suffered most are still in the best order. My regulars were 
superb, and I count upon what are left to turn another battle in 
company with their gallant comrades of the volunteers. Had I 
twenty thousand (20,000), or even ten thousand (10,000), fresh 
troops to use to-morrow, I could take Richmond ; but I have 
not a man in reserve, and shall be glad to cover my retreat and 
save the material and personnel of the army. 



McCLELLAN TO STANTON. 



425 



If we have lost the day we have yet preserved our honor, and 
no one need blush for the Army of the Potomac. I have lost 
this battle because my force was too small. 

I again repeat that I am not responsible for this, and I say 
it with the earnestness of a general who feels in his heart the 
loss of every brave man who has been needlessly sacrificed 
to-day. I still hope to retrieve our fortunes ; but to do this the 
government must view the matter in the same earnest light that 
I do. You must send me very large reinforcements, and send 
them at once. I shall draw back to this side of the Chicka- 
hominy, and think I can withdraw all our material. Please 
understand that in this battle we have lost nothing but men, 
and those the best we have. 

In addition to what I have already said, I only wish to say 
to the President that I think he is wrong in regarding me as 
ungenerous when I said that my force was too weak. I merely 
intimated a truth which to-day has been too plainly proved. 
If, at this instant, I could dispose of ten thousand (10,000) fresh 
men, I could gain the victory to-morrow. 

I know that a few thousand more men would have changed 
this battle from a defeat to a victory. As it is, the government 
must not and cannot hold me responsible for the result. 

I feel too earnestly to-night. I have seen too many dead and 
wounded comrades to feel otherwise than that the government 
has not sustained this army. If you do not do so now the game 
is lost. 

If I save this army now, I tell you plainly that I owe no 
thanks to you or to any other persons in Washington. 

You have done your best to sacrifice this army. 

G. B. McCLELLAN.

White Oak Swamp Charles City cross-roads Glendale Malvern 
Hill The army at Harrison's Landing. 

THE headquarters camp at Savage's Station was broken up 
early on the morning of the 2 9th and moved across White Oak 
Swamp. As the essential part of this day's operation was the 
passage of the trains across the swamp, and their protection 
against attack from the direction of New Market and Rich- 
mond, as well as the immediate and secure establishment of our 
communications with the gunboats, I passed the day in examin- 
ing the ground, directing the posting of troops, and securing the 
uninterrupted movement of the trains. 

In the afternoon I instructed Gen. Keyes to move during the 
night to James river and occupy a defensive position near Mal- 
vern Hill, to secure our extreme left flank. 

Gen. F. J. Porter was ordered to follow him and prolong the 
line towards the right. The trains were to be pushed on towards 
James river in rear of these corps, and placed under the protec- 
tion of the gunboats as they arrived. 

A sharp skirmish with the enemy's cavalry early this day on 
the Quaker road showed that his efforts were about to be directed 
towards impeding our progress to the river, and rendered my pre- 
sence in that quarter necessary. 

The difficulty was not at all with the movement of the troops, 
but with the immense trains, that were to be moved virtually by 
a single road and required the whole army for their protection. 
With the exception of the cavalry affair on the Quaker road, we 
were not troubled during this day south of the swamp, but there 
was severe fighting north of it. 

Gen. Sumner vacated his works at Fair Oaks on June 29, 
at daylight, and marched his command to Orchard Station, halt- 
ing at Allen's field, between Orchard and Savage's Stations. 

The divisions of Richardson and Sedgwick were formed on 

426 



THE SEVEN DAYS. 427 

the right of the railroad, facing towards Richmond, Richardson 
holding the right, and Sedgwick joining the right of Heintzel- 
man's corps. The first line of Richardson's division was held by 
Gen. French, Gen. Caldwell supporting in the second. A log 
building in front of Richardson's division was held by Col. 
Brooks with one regiment (53d Penn. Volunteers), with Haz- 
zard's battery on an elevated piece of ground a little in rear of 
Col. Brooks's command. 

At nine A.M. the enemy commenced a furious attack on the 
right of Gen. Sedgwick, but were repulsed. The left of Gen. 
Richardson was next attacked, the enemy attempting in vain to 
carry the position of Col. Brooks. Capt. Hazzard's battery, and 
Pettit's battery, which afterwards replaced it, were served with 
great effect, while the 53d Penn. kept up a steady fire on the 
advancing enemy, compelling them at last to retire in disorder. 
The enemy renewed the attack three times, but were as often 
repulsed. 

Gen. Slocum arrived at Savage's Station at an early hour 
on the 2Qth, and was ordered to cross White Oak Swamp and 
relieve Gen. Keyes's corps. As soon as Gen. Keyes was thus 
relieved he moved towards James river, which he reached in 
safety, with all his artillery and baggage, early on the morning 
of the 3oth, and took up a position below Turkey creek bridge. 

During the morning Gen. Franklin heard that the enemy, 
after having repaired the bridges, was crossing the Chickaho- 
miny in large force and advancing towards Savage's Station. 
He communicated this information to Gen. Sumner, at Allen's 
farm, and moved Smith's division to Savage's Station. A little 
after noon Gen. Sumner united his forces with those of Gen. 
Franklin and assumed command. 

I had ordered Gen. Heintzelman, with his corps, to hold the 
Williamsburg road until dark, at a point where were several field- 
works, and a skirt of timber between these works and the rail- 
road. 

Through a misunderstanding of his orders, and being con- 
vinced that the troops of Sumner and Franklin at Savage's Sta- 
tion were ample for the purpose in view, Heintzelman withdrew 
his troops during the afternoon, crossed the swamp at Brackett's 
ford, and reached the Charles City road with the rear of his 
column at ten P.M. 



428 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

On reaching Savage's Station Sumner's and Franklin's com- 
mands were drawn up in line of battle in the large open field to 
the left of the railroad, the left resting on the edge of the woods 
and the right extending down to the railroad. Gen. Brooks, 
with his brigade, held the wood to the left of the field, where he 
did excellent service, receiving a wound, but retaining his com- 
mand. 

Gen. Hancock's brigade was thrown into the woods on the 
right and front. At four P.M. the enemy commenced his attack 
in large force by the Williamsburg road. It was gallantly met 
by Gen. Burns's brigade, supported and reinforced by two lines 
in reserve, and finally by the N. Y. 69th, Hazzard's and Pettit's 
batteries again doing good service. Osborn's and Bramhall's 
batteries also took part effectively in this action, which was con- 
tinued with great obstinacy until between eight and nine P.M., 
when the enemy were driven from the field. 

Immediately after the battle the orders were repeated for all 
the troops to fall back and cross White Oak Swamp, which was 
accomplished during the night in good order. By midnight all 
the troops were on the road to White Oak Swamp bridge, Gen. 
French, with his brigade, acting as rear-guard, and at five A.M. 
on the 3oth all had crossed and the bridge was destroyed. 

On the afternoon of the 2Qth I gave to the corps comman- 
ders their instructions for the operations of the following day. 
Porter's corps was to move forward to James river, and, with 
the corps of Gen. Keyes, to occupy a position at or near Tur- 
key Bend, on a line perpendicular to the river, thus covering 
the Charles City road to Richmond, opening communication 
with the gunboats, and covering the passage of the supply- 
trains, which were pushed forward as rapidly as possible upon 
Haxall's plantation. The remaining corps were pressed onward, 
and posted so as to guard the approaches from Richmond, as 
well as the crossings of the White Oak Swamp over which the 
army had passed. Gen. Franklin was ordered to hold the pas- 
sage of White Oak Swamp bridge, and cover the withdrawal 
of the trains from that point. His command consisted of his 
own corps, with Gen. Richardson's division and Gen. Naglee's 
brigade, placed under his orders for the occasion. Gen. Slo- 
cum's division was on the right of the Charles City road. 

On the morning of the 3oth I again gave to the corps com- 



THE SEVEN DAYS. 429 

manders within reach instructions for posting their troops. I 
found that, notwithstanding all the efforts of my personal staff 
and other officers, the roads were blocked by wagons, and there 
was great difficulty in keeping the trains in motion. 

The engineer officers whom I had sent forward on the 28th 
to reconnoitre the roads had neither returned nor sent me any 
reports or guides. Gens. Keyes and Porter had been delayed 
one by losing the road, and the other by repairing an old road 
and had not been able to send any information. We then knew 
of but one road for the movement of the troops and our im- 
mense trains. 

It was therefore necessary to post the troops in advance of 
this road as well as our limited knowledge of the ground per- 
mitted, so as to cover the movement of the trains in the rear. 

I then examined the whole line from the swamp to the left, 
giving final instructions for the posting of the troops and the 
obstruction of the roads towards Richmond, and all corps com- 
manders were directed to hold their positions until the trains 
had passed, after which a more concentrated position was to 
be taken up near James river. 

Our force was too small to occupy and hold the entire line 
from the White Oak Swamp to the river, exposed, as it was, to 
be taken in reverse by a movement across the lower part of the 
swamp, or across the Chickahominy below the swamp. More- 
over, the troops were then greatly exhausted, and required rest 
in a more secure position. 

I extended my examinations of the country as far as Hax- 
all's, looking at all the approaches to Malvern, which position I 
perceived to be the key to our operations in this quarter, and 
was thus enabled to expedite very considerably the passage of 
the trains and to rectify the positions of the troops. 

Everything being then quiet, I sent aids to the different corps 
commanders to inform them what I had done on the left, and 
to bring me information of the condition of affairs on the right. 
I returned from Malvern to Haxall's, and, having made arrange- 
ments for instant communication from Malvern by signals, went 
on board of Com. Rodgers's gunboat, lying near, to confer with 
him in reference to the condition of our supply-vessels and the 
state of things on the river. It was his opinion that it would 
be necessary for the army to fall back to a position below City 



430 MfCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Point, as the channel there was so near the southern shore that 
it would not be possible to bring up the transports, should the 
enemy occupy it. Harrison's Landing was, in his opinion, the 
nearest suitable point. Upon the termination of this interview 
I returned to Malvern Hill, and remained there until shortly 
before daylight. 

On the morning of the 3oth Gen. Sumner was ordered to 
march with Sedgwick's division to Glendale (" Nelson's farm "). 
Gen. McCall's division (Pennsylvania reserves) was halted dur- 
ing the morning on the New Market road, just in advance of 
the point where the road turns off to Quaker church. This 
line was formed perpendicularly to the New Market road, 
with Meade's brigade on the right, Seymour's on the left, and 
Reynolds's brigade, commanded by Col. S. G. Simmons, of the 
5th Penn., in reserve ; Randall's regular battery on the right, 
Kern's and Cooper's batteries opposite the centre, and Die- 
trich's and Kauerhem's batteries of the artillery reserve on the 
left all in front of the infantry line. The country in Gen. 
McCall's front was an open field, intersected towards the right 
by the New Market road and a small strip of timber parallel 
to it ; the open front was about eight hundred yards, its depth 
about one thousand yards. 

On the morning of the 3oth Gen. Heintzelman ordered the 
bridge at Brackett's ford to be destroyed, and trees to be felled 
across that road and the Charles City road. Gen. Slocum's 
division was to extend to the Charles City road ; Gen. Kear- 
ny's left to connect with Gen. Slocum's left ; Gen. McCall's 
position was to the left of the Long bridge road, in connection 
with Gen. Kearny's left ; Gen. Hooker was on the left of Gen. 
McCall. Between twelve and one o'clock the enemy opened a 
fierce cannonade upon the divisions of Smith and Richardson 
and Naglee's brigade at White Oak Swamp bridge. This artil- 
lery-fire was continued by the enemy through the day, and 
crossed some infantry below our position. Richardson's divi- 
sion suffered severely. Captain Ayres directed our artillery wit 
great effect. Capt. Hazzard's battery, after losing many a 
noneers, and Capt. Hazzard being mortally wounded, was coi 
pelled to retire. It was replaced by Pettit's battery, which pai 
dally silenced the enemy's guns. 

Gen. Franklin held his position until after dark, repeatedl]

driving back the enemy in their attempts to cross the White 
Oak Swamp. 

At two o'clock in the day the enemy were reported advanc- 
ing in force by the Charles City road, and at half-past two 
o'clock the attack was made down the road on Gen. Slocum's 
left, but was checked by his artillery. After this the enemy, 
in large force, comprising the divisions of Longstreet and A. P. 
Hill, attacked Gen. McCall, whose division, after severe fight- 
ing, was compelled to retire. 

Gen. McCall, in his report of the battle, says : 

" About half-past two my pickets were driven in by a strong 
advance, after some skirmishing, without loss on our part. 

" At three o'clock the enemy sent forward a regiment on the 
left centre and another on the right centre to feel for a weak 
point. They were under cover of a shower of shells and boldly 
advanced, but were both driven back on the left by the i2th 
regiment, and on the right by the jih regiment. 

" For nearly two hours the battle raged hotly here. . . . 
At last the enemy was compelled to retire before the well- 
directed musketry-fire of the reserves. The German batteries 
were driven to the rear, but I rode up and sent them back. It 
was, however, of little avail, and they were soon after abandoned 
by the cannoneers. . . . 

" The batteries in front of the centre were boldly charged 
upon, but the enemy was speedily forced back. . . . 

" Soon after this a most determined charge was made on 
Randall's battery by a full brigade, advancing in wedge-shape, 
without order, but in perfect recklessness. Somewhat similar 
charges had, I have stated, been previously made on Cooper's 
and Kern's batteries by single regiments, without success, they 
having recoiled before the storm of canister hurled against them. 
A like result was anticipated by Randall's battery, and the 4th 
regiment was requested not to fire until the battery had done 
with them. 

" Its gallant commander did not doubt his ability to repel the 
attack, and his guns did, indeed, mow down the advancing host ; 
but still the gaps were closed, and the enemy came in upon a run 
to the very muzzles of his guns. 

" It was a perfect torrent of men, and they were in his battery 
before the guns could be removed. Two guns that were, indeed, 
successfully limbered had their horses killed and wounded, and 
were overturned on the spot, and the enemy, dashing past, drove 
the greater part of the 4th regiment before them. 

" The left company (B), nevertheless, stood its ground, with 
its captain, Fred. A. Conrad, as did likewise certain men of other 



432 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

companies. I had ridden into the regiment and endeavored to 
check them, but with only partial success. . . . 

" There was no running. But my division, reduced by the 
previous battles to less than six thousand (6,000), had to contend 
with the divisions of Longstreet and A. P. Hill, considered two 
of the strongest and best among many of the Confederate army, 
numbering that day 18,000 or 20,000 men, and it was reluctantly 
compelled to give way before heavier force accumulated upon 
them. . . ." 

Gen. Heintzelman states that about five o'clock P.M. Gen. 
McCall's division was attacked in large force, evidently the prin- 
cipal attack ; that in less than an hour the division gave way, 
and adds : 

"Gen. Hooker, being on his left, by moving to his right 
repulsed the rebels in the handsomest manner with great slaugh- 
ter. Gen. Sumner, who was with Gen. Sedgwick in McCall's 
rear, also greatly aided with his artillery and infantry in driv- 
ing back the enemy. They now renewed their attack with vig- 
or on Gen. Kearny's left, and were again repulsed with heavy 
loss. . . . 

" This attack commenced about four P.M., and was pushed by 
heavy masses with the utmost determination and vigor. Capt. 
Thompson's battery, directed with great precision, firing double 
charges, swept them back. The whole open space, two hundred 
paces wide, was rilled with the enemy ; each repulse brought 
fresh troops. The third attack was only repulsed by the rapid 
volleys and determined charge of the 63d Penn., Col. Hays, and 
half of the 37th N. Y. Volunteers." 

Gen. McCall's troops soon began to emerge from the woods 
into the open field. Several batteries were in position and began 
to fire into the woods over the heads of our men in front. Capt. 
De Russy's battery was placed on the right of Gen. Sumner's 
artillery, with orders to shell the woods. Gen. Burns's brigade 
was then advanced to meet the enemy, and soon drove him back. 
Other troops began to return from the White Oak Swamp. Late 
in the day, at the call of Gen. Kearny, Gen. Taylor's ist N. J. 
brigade, Slocum's division, was sent to occupy a portion of Gen. 
McCall's deserted position, a battery accompanying the brigade. 
They soon drove back the enemy, who shortly after gave up the 
attack, contenting themselves with keeping up a desultory firing 
till late at night. Between twelve and one o'clock at night Gen. 
Heintzelman commenced to withdraw his corps, and soon after 



THE SEVEN DAYS. 433 

daylight both of his divisions, with Gen. Slocum's division and a 
portion of Gen. Sumner's command, reached Malvern Hill. 

On the morning of the 3oth Gen. Sumner, in obedience to 
orders, had moved promptly to Glendale, and upon a call from 
Gen. Franklin for reinforcements sent him two brigades, which 
returned in time to participate and render good service in the 
battle near Glendale. Gen. Sumner says of this battle : 

" The battle of Glendale was the most severe action since the 
battle of Fair Oaks. About three o'clock P.M. the action com- 
menced, and after a furious contest, lasting till after dark, the 
enemy was routed at all points and driven from the field." 

The rear of the supply-trains and the reserve artillery of the 
army reached Malvern Hill about four P.M. At about this time 
the enemy began to appear in Gen. Porter's front, and at five 
o'clock advanced in large force against his left flank, posting 
artillery under cover of a skirt of timber, with a view to engage 
our force on Malvern Hill, while with his infantry and some artil- 
lery he attacked Col. Warren's brigade. A concentrated fire of 
about thirty guns was brought to bear on the enemy, which, with 
the infantry-fire of Col. Warren's command, compelled him to 
retreat, leaving two guns in the hands of Col. Warren. The gun- 
boats rendered most efficient aid at this time, and helped to drive 
back the enemy. 

It was very late at night before my aides returned to give me 
the results of the day's fighting along the whole line and the true 
position of affairs. While waiting to hear from Gen. Franklin, 
before sending orders to Gens. Sumner and Heintzelman, I 
received a message from the latter that Gen. Franklin was fall- 
ing back ; whereupon I sent Col. Colburn, of my staff, with orders 
to verify this, and, if it were true, to order in Gens. Sumner and 
Heintzelman at once. He had not gone far when he met two 
officers sent from Gen. Franklin's headquarters with the informa- 
tion that he was falling back. Orders were then sent to Gens. 
Sumner and Heintzelman to fall back also, and definite instruc- 
tions were given as to the movement which was to commence on 
the right. The orders met these troops already en route to Mal- 
vern. Instructions were also sent to Gen. Franklin as to the 
route he was to follow. 

Gen. Barnard then received full instructions for posting the 
troops as they arrived. 



434 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

I then returned to Haxall's, and again left for Malvern soon 
after daybreak. Accompanied by several general officers, I once 
more made the entire circuit of the position, and then returned 
to Haxall's, whence I went with Com. Rodgers to select the final 
location for the army and its depots. I returned to Malvern 
before the serious fighting commenced, and after riding along 
the lines, and seeing most cause to feel anxious about the right, 
remained in that vicinity. 

The position selected for resisting the further advance of the 
enemy on the ist of July was with the left and centre of our 
lines resting on Malvern Hill, while the right curved backwards 
through a wooded country towards a point below Haxall's, on 
James river. Malvern Hill is an elevated plateau about a mile 
and a half by three-fourths of a mile in area, well cleared of tim- 
ber, and with several converging roads running over it. In front 
are numerous defensible ravines, and the ground slopes gradually 
towards the north and east to the woodland, giving clear ranges 
for artillery in those directions. Towards the northwest the 
plateau falls off more abruptly into a ravine which extends to 
James river. From the position of the enemy his most obvious 
lines of attack would come from the direction of Richmond and 
White Oak Swamp, and would almost of necessity strike us upon 
our left wing. Here, therefore, the lines were strengthened by 
massing the troops and collecting the principal part of the artil- 
lery. Porter's corps held the left of the line (Sykes's division on 
the left, Morell's on the right), with the artillery of his two 
divisions advantageously posted, and the artillery of the reserve 
so disposed on the high ground that a concentrated fire of some 
sixty guns could be brought to bear on any point in his front or 
left. Col. Tyler also had, with great exertion, succeeded in get- 
ting ten of his siege-guns in position on the highest point of 
the hill. 

Couch's division was placed on the right of Porter ; next 
came Kearny and Hooker ; next Sedgwick and Richardson ; 
next Smith and Slocum ; then the remainder of Keyes's corps, 
extending by a backward curve nearly to the river. The Penn- 
sylvania reserve corps was held in reserve, and stationed behind 
Porter's and Couch's position. One brigade of Porter's was 
thrown to the left on the low ground to protect that flank from 
any movement direct from the Richmond road. The line was 



436 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

very strong along the whole front of the open plateau, but from 
thence to the extreme right the troops were more deployed. This 
formation was imperative, as an attack would probably be made 
upon our left. The right was rendered as secure as possible by 
slashing the timber and by barricading the roads. Com. Rgdg- 
ers, commanding, the flotilla on James river, placed his gunboats 
so as to protect our flank and to command the approaches from 
Richmond. 

Between nine and ten A.M. the enemy commenced feeling 
along our whole left wing, with his artillery and skirmishers, as 
far to the right as Hooker's division. 

About two o'clock a column of the enemy was observed 
moving towards our right, within the skirt of woods in front 
of Heintzelman's corps, but beyond the range of our artillery. 
Arrangements were at once made to meet the anticipated attack 
in that quarter; but, though the column was long, occupying 
more than two hours in passing, it disappeared and was not 
again heard of. The presumption is that it retired by the rear, 
and participated in the attack afterwards made on our left. 

About three P.M. a heavy fire of artillery opened on Kearny's 
left and Couch's division, speedily followed up by a brisk attack 
of infantry on Couch's front. The artillery was replied to with 
good effect by our own, and the infantry of Couch's division 
remained lying on the ground until the advancing column was 
within short musket-range, when they sprang to their feet and 
poured in a deadly volley which entirely broke the attacking 
force and drove them in disorder back over their own ground. 
This advantage was followed up until we had advanced the 
right of our line some seven or eight hundred yards, and rested 
upon a thick clump of trees, giving us a stronger position and a 
better fire. 

Shortly after four o'clock the firing ceased along the whole 
front, but no disposition was evinced on the part of the enemy 
to withdraw from the field. Caldwell's brigade, having been 
detached from Richardson's division, was stationed upon Couch's 
right by Gen. Porter, to whom he had been ordered to report. 
The whole line was surveyed by the general, and everything 
held in readiness to meet the coming attack. At six o'clock 
the enemy suddenly opened upon Couch and Porter with the 
whole strength of his artillery, and at once began pushing for- 



MALVERN HILL. 



437 



ward his columns of attack to carry the hill. Brigade after 
brigade, formed under cover of the woods, started at a run to 
cross the open space and charge our batteries, but the heavy fire 
of our guns, with the cool and steady volleys of our infantry, 
in every case sent them reeling back to shelter and covered 
the ground with their dead and wounded. In several instances 
our infantry withheld their fire until the attacking column, 
which rushed through the storm of canister and shell from our 
artillery, had reached within a few yards of our lines. They 
then poured in a single volley and dashed forward with the 
bayonet, capturing prisoners and colors, and driving the routed 
columns in confusion from the field. 

About seven o'clock, as fresh troops were accumulating in 
front of Porter and Couch, Meagher and Sickles were sent with 
their brigades, as soon as it was considered prudent to withdraw 
any portion of Sumner's and Heintzelman's troops, to rein- 
force that part of the line and hold the position. These bri- 
gades relieved such regiments of Porter's corps and Couch's 
division as had expended their ammunition, and batteries from 
the reserve were pushed forward to replace those whose boxes 
were empty. Until dark the enemy persisted in his efforts to 
take the position so tenaciously defended ; but, despite his 
vastly superior numbers, his repeated and desperate attacks 
were repulsed with fearful loss, and darkness ended the battle 
of Malvern Hill, though it was not until after nine o'clock that 
the artillery ceased its fire. The result was complete victory. 

During the whole battle Com. Rodgers added greatly to the 
discomfiture of the enemy by throwing shell among his reserves 
and advancing columns. 

It was necessary to fall back still further, in order to reach 
a point where our supplies could be brought to us with certainty. 
As before stated, in the opinion of Com. Rodgers, commanding 
the gunboat flotilla, this could only be done below City Point ; 
concurring in his opinion, I selected Harrison's Bar as the new- 
position of the army. The exhaustion of our supplies of food, 
forage, and ammunition made it imperative to reach the trans- 
ports immediately. 

The greater portion of the transportation of the army having 
been started for Harrison's Landing during the night of the 3oth 
of June and ist of July, the order for the movement of the 



438 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

troops was at once issued upon the final repulse of the enemy 
at Malvern Hill. The order prescribed a movement by the left 
and rear, m Gen. Keyes's corps to cover the manoeuvre. It was 
not carried out in detail as regards the divisions on the left, the 
roads being somewhat blocked by the rear of our trains. Por- 
ter and Couch were not able to move out as early as had been 
anticipated, and Porter found it necessary to place a rear- 
guard between his command and the enemy. Col. Averill, of 
the 3d Penn. Cavalry, was entrusted with this delicate duty. 
He had under his command his own regiment and Lieut. -Col. 
Buchanan's brigade of regular infantry and one battery. By a 
judicious use of the resources at his command he deceived the 
enemy so as to cover the withdrawal of the left wing without 
being attacked, remaining himself on the previous day's battle- 
field until about seven o'clock of the 2d of July. Meantime 
Gen. Keyes, having received his orders, commenced vigorous 
preparations for covering the movement of the entire army and 
protecting the trains. It being evident that the immense num- 
ber of wagons and artillery-carriages pertaining to the army 
could not move with celerity along a single road, Gen. Keyes 
took advantage of every accident of the ground to open new 
avenues and to facilitate the movement. He made preparations 
for obstructing the roads after the army had passed, so as to 
prevent any rapid pursuit, destroying effectually Turkey bridge, 
on the main road, and rendering other roads and approaches 
temporarily impassable by felling trees across them. He kept 
the trains well closed up, and directed the march so that the 
troops could move on each side of the roads, not obstructing the 
passage, but being in good position to repel an attack from any 
quarter. His dispositions were so successful that, to use his own 
words, "I do not think more vehicles or more public property 
were abandoned on the march from Turkey bridge than would 
have been left, in the same state of the roads, if the army had 
been moving towards the enemy instead of away from him. And 
when it is understood that the carriages and teams belonging to 
this army, stretched out in one line, would extend not far from 
forty miles, the energy and caution necessary for their safe with- 
drawal from the presence of an enemy vastly superior in num- 
bers will be appreciated." The last of the wagons did n< 
reach the site selected at Harrison's Bar until after dark on th<

^d of July, and the rear-guard did not move into their camp 
until everything was secure. The enemy followed up with a 
small force, and on the 3d threw a few shells at the rear-guard, 
but were quickly dispersed by our batteries and the fire of the 
gunboats. 

Great credit must be awarded to Gen. Keyes for the skill and 
energy which characterized his performance of the important 
and delicate duties entrusted to his charge. 

High praise is also due to the officers and men of the ist 
Conn. Artillery, Col. Tyler, for the manner in which they with- 
drew all the heavy guns during the Seven Days and from Mal- 
vern Hill. Owing to the crowded state of the roads the teams 
could not be brought within a couple of miles of the position, 
but these energetic soldiers removed the guns by hand for that 
distance, leaving nothing behind. 

So long as life lasts the survivors of those glorious days will 
remember with quickened pulse the attitude of that army when 
it reached the goal for which it had striven with such trans- 
cendent heroism. Exhausted, depleted in numbers, bleeding at 
every pore, but still proud and defiant, and strong in the con- 
sciousness of a great feat of arms heroically accomplished, it 
stood ready to renew the struggle with undirninished ardor when- 
ever its commander should give the word. It was one of those 
magnificent episodes which dignify a nation's history and are fit 
subjects for the grandest efforts of the poet and the painter.* 

This movement was now successfully accomplished, and the 
Army of the Potomac was at last in position on its true line of 
operations, with its trains intact, no guns lost save those taken in 
battle when the artillerists had proved their heroism and devo- 
tion by standing to their guns until the enemy's infantry were in 
their midst. 

During the Seven Days the Army of the Potomac consisted 
of 143 regiments of infantry, 55 batteries, and less than 8 regi- 
ments of cavalry all told. The opposing Confederate army con-

ing lying as he left it, the paragraph above, commencing with the words, 
" So long as life lasts," appeared to be the last work of his pen. The last 
words he wrote were thus this final expression of his admiration for the 
Army of the Potomac. I have thought fit to insert them here. 



44O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

sisted of 187 regiments of infantry, 79 batteries, and 14 regiments 
of cavalry. The losses of the two armies from June 25 to July 2 
were : 

Killed. Wounded. Missing. Total. 

Confederate Army, 2,823 13,703 3,223 19,749 
Army of the Potomac, 1,734 8,062 6,053 15,849 

The Confederate losses in killed and wounded alone were greater 
than the total losses of the Army of the Potomac in killed, 
wounded, and missing. 

No praise can be too great for the officers and men who 
passed through these seven days of battle, enduring fatigue with- 
out a murmur, successfully meeting and repelling every attack 
made upon them, always in the right place at the right time, and 
emerging from the fiery ordeal a compact army of veterans, equal 
to any task that brave and disciplined men can be called upon 
to undertake. They needed now only a few days of well-earned 
repose, a renewal of ammunition and supplies, and reinforce- 
ments to fill the gaps made in their ranks by so many desperate 
encounters, to be prepared to advance again, with entire con- 
fidence, to meet their worthy antagonists in other battles. It 
was, however, decided by the authorities at Washington, against 
my earnest, remonstrances, to abandon the position on the James, 
and the campaign. The Army of the Potomac was accordingly 
withdrawn. 

It was not until two years later that it again found itself under 
its last commander at substantially the same point on the bank 
of the James. It was as evident in 1862 as in 1865 that there 
was the true defence of Washington, and that it was on the banks 
of the James that the fate of the Union was to be decided

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[June 26 to Aug. 23, 1862.] 

June 26, 2 P.M., Trent's. . . . Yesterday I wished to advance 
our picket-line, and met with a good deal of opposition. We 
succeeded fully, however, and gained the point with but little 
loss. The enemy fought pretty hard, but our men did better. 
I was out there all day taking a personal direction of affairs, and 
remained until about 5.30 P.M., when I returned to camp, and met 
on my way the news that Stonewall Jackson was on his way to 
attack my right and rear. I rode over to Porter's soon after I 
reached camp, and returned about 2.30 A.M. At three I started 
off again and went to the front, where an attack was expected by 
some. Finding all quiet, I rode all along the lines and returned 
here. You may imagine that I am rather tired out. I think that 
Jackson will attempt to attack our rear. . . . 

Have just received the positive information that Jackson is 
fn route to take us in rear. You probably will not hear for 
some days ; but do not be at all worried. . . .

that God will smile upon my efforts and give our arms success. 
You will hear that we are pursued, annihilated, etc. Do not

So far we have repulsed them everywhere. I expect wire to be 
cut any moment. All well and very busy. Cannot write to- 
day. 

Telegram McClellarfs Headquarters, June 27. Have, had 
a terrible fight against vastly superior numbers. Have generally 
held our own, and we may thank God that the Army of the Poto- 
mac has not lost its honor. It is impossible as yet to tell what 
the result is. I am well, but tired out ; no sleep for two nights, 
and none to-night. God bless you ! 

Telegram McClellans Headquarters, June 28. We are all 
well to-night. I fear your uncle has been seriously hurt in the 
terrible fight of yesterday. They have outnumbered us every- 
where, but we have not lost our honor. This army has acted 
magnificently. I thank my friends in Washington for our re- 
pulse. 

June 29, 3 P.M., in the field. I send you only a line to say 
that I still think God is with us. We have fought a terrible 
battle against overwhelming numbers. We held our own, and 
history will show that I have done all that man can do. ... 


June 30, 7 P.M., Turkey bridge. Well, but worn out ; no sleep 

for many days. We have been fighting for many days, and are 
still at it. ... We have fought every day for five days. . . . 

July i, HaxalVs Plantation. . . . The whole army is here ; 
worn out and war-worn, after a week of daily battles. I have still 
very great confidence in them, and they in me. The dear fel-

feel prouder of them than ever. 

July 2, ... Berkley, James river. ... I have only energy 
enough left to scrawl you a few lines to say that I have the whole 
army here, with all its material and guns. We are all worn out 
and haggard. . . . My men need repose, and I hope will be 
allowed to enjoy it to-morrow. . . . Your poor uncle was killed 
at the battle of Gaines's Mills on Friday last. We are well, but 
very tired. . . .

July 2, n P.M. I will now take a few moments from the rest 
which i really need, and write at least a few words. . . . We have 
had a terrible time. On Wednesday the serious work commenced. 
I commenced driving the enemy on our left, and, by hard fight- 
ing, gained my point. Before that affair was over I received news 
that Jackson was -probably about to attack my right. I gal- 
loped back to camp, took a fresh horse, and went over to Por- 
ter's camp, where I remained all night making the best arrange- 
ments I could, and returned about daybreak to look out for the 
left. On Thursday afternoon Jackson began his attack on Mc- 
Call, who was supported by Porter. Jackson being repulsed, I 
went over there in the afternoon and remained until two or three 
A.M. I was satisfied that Jackson would have force enough next 
morning to turn Porter's right, so I removed all the wagons, 
heavy guns, etc., during the night, and caused Porter to fall 
back to a point nearer the force on the other side of the Chicka- 
hominy. This was most handsomely effected, all our material 
being saved. The next day Porter was attacked in his new posi- 
tion by the whole force of Jackson, Longstreet, Ewell, Hill, and 
Whiting. I sent what supports I could, but was at the same 
time attacked on my own front, and could only spare seven 
brigades. With these we held our own at all points after most 
desperate fighting. It was on this day that your poor uncle 
[Col. Rossell] was killed, gallantly leading his regiment. He 
was struck in the breast, and died in a few hours. Glitz fell 
that day also. John Reynolds was taken prisoner. I was 
forced that night to withdraw Porter's force to my side of the 
Chickahominy, and therefrom to make a very dangerous and 
difficult movement to reach the James river. I must say good- 
night now, for I am very tired, and may require all my ener- 
gies to-morrow. 

July 4, Berkley. . . . You will understand before this 
reaches you the glorious yet fearful events which have prevent- 
ed me from writing. We have fine weather to-day, which is 
drying the ground rapidly. I was quite stampeded yesterday 
just before your father left. A report came to me that the ene- 
my were advancing in overwhelming numbers, and that none 
of my orders for placing the troops in position and reorganiz- 
ing them had been carried out. I at once rode through the 



444 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

camps, clear in front of them, to let them see that there was 
no danger. They began to cheer as usual, and called out that 
they were all right and would fall to the last man " for Little 
Mac " ! I saw where the trouble was, halted all the commands, 
looked at the ground, and made up my mind what the true' posi- 
tion was. Started Smith at a double-quick to seize the key- 
point, followed by a battery of horse-artillery at a gallop. They 
went up most beautifully, opened on the enemy, drove him off 
after eighteen rounds, and finally held the place. I pushed Slo- 
cum's division up in support, hurried off Heintzelman's corps 
to take its position on Franklin's left, supported by Keyes still 
further to the left, and came back to camp a little before dark 
with a light heart for the first time in many days. I am ready 
for an attack now ; give me twenty-four hours even, and I will 
defy all secession. The movement has been a magnificent one ; 
I have saved all our material, have fought every day for a week, 
and marched every night. You can't tell how nervous I became ; 
everything seemed like the opening of artillery, and I had no 
rest, no peace, except when in front with my men. The duties 
of my position are such as often to make it necessary for me to 
remain in the rear. It is an awful thing. 

I have re established the playing of bands, beating the calls, 
etc., by way of keeping the men in good spirits, and have or- 
dered the national salute to be fired to-day at noon from the 
camp of each corps. I have some more official letters to write, 
so I must close this, and must soon start to ride around the 
lines. 

July , Monday, 7.30 A.M. I have had a good, refreshing 
night's sleep. . . . We are to have another very hot day ; it 
is already apparent. I am writing in my shirt-sleeves and with 
tent-walls raised, etc. . . . Our army has not been repulsed ; 
we fought every day against greatly superior numbers, and 
were obliged to retire at night to new positions that we could 
hold against fresh troops. The army behaved magnificently ; 
nothing could have been finer than its conduct. . . . 

July 8. . . . The day is insufferably hot, intense, so much 
so that I have suspended all work on the part of the men. 
have written a strong, frank letter to the President, which I

send by your father. If he acts upon it the country will be 
saved. I will send you a copy to-morrow, as well as of the 
other important letters which I wish you to keep as my record. 
They will show, with the others you have, that I was true to 
my country, that I understood the state of affairs long ago, and 
that had my advice been followed we should not have been in 
our present difficulties. ... I have done the best I could. God 
has disposed of events as to Him seemed best. I submit to 
His decrees with perfect cheerfulness, and as sure as He rules 
I believe that all will yet be for the best. . . . 

Midnight. Everything is quiet now ; none awake save the 
sentinels. I am alone with you and the Almighty, whose good 
and powerful hand has saved me and my army. The terrible 
moments I have undergone of late I regard as a part of the 
cross I have to bear,- and, with God's help, will endure to the 
end when my task is finished. I place myself in His hands, 
and with a sincere heart say His will be done. Oh ! how 
ardently I pray for rest. Rest with you. I care not where, 
only that I may be alone with you. We are to have service 
at headquarters to-morrow morning, and I will endeavor to 
have it every Sunday hereafter.* 

July 9, 9.30 P.M., Berkley. I telegraphed you briefly this 

* The following order will be read with interest in this connection : 

General Orders \ No. 7. 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6, 1861. 

The major-general commanding desires and requests that in future 
there may be a more perfect respect for the Sabbath on the part of his 
command. 

We are fighting in a holy cause, and should endeavor to deserve the 
benign favor of the Creator. 

Unless in the case of an attack by the enemy, or some other extreme 
military necessity, it is commended to commanding officers that all work 
shall be suspended on the Sabbath ; that no unnecessary movements shall 
be made on that day ; that the men shall, as far as possible, be permitted 
to rest from their labors ; that they shall attend divine service after the 
customary Sunday morning inspection, and that officers and men shall 
alike use their influence to insure the utmost decorum and quiet on that 
day. The general commanding regards this as no idle form ; one day's 
rest in seven is necessary to men and animals ; more than this, the obser- 
vance of the holy day of the God of Mercy and of Battles is our sacred 
duty.

afternoon that I thought Secesh had retired. This opinion 
seems to be fully confirmed, at least to the extent of his having 
fallen back a certain distance. He is not within six or seven 
miles of us even with his cavalry, and considerably further 
with his infantry. I am not sorry, on the whole, that he has 
gone, for the reason that it will enable my men to rest tran- 
quilly just what they need. I do not expect to receive many 
reinforcements for some time. Even Burnside's men are halted 
at Fortress Monroe by order of the President. His excellency 
was here yesterday and left this morning. He found the army 
anything but demoralized or dispirited ; in excellent spirits. I 
do not know to what extent he has profited by his visit ; not 
much, I fear. I will enclose with this a copy of a letter I 
handed him, which I would be glad to have you preserve care- 
fully as a very important record. . . . My camp is now imme- 
diately on the banks of the James river, in the woods. . . . 



7 A.M. (loM). . . . Rose a little before six. ... I do not 
know what paltry trick the administration will play next. . . . 
I have honestly done the best / could. I shall leave it to others 
to decide whether that was the best that could have been done, 
and, if they find any one who can do better, am perfectly will- 
ing to step aside and give way. I would not for worlds go 
through that horrid work again, when, with my heart full of 
care, I had to meet everybody with a cheerful smile and look 
as light-hearted as though nothing were at stake. . . . 

Telegram Berkley, July 10, 1862. We are all very well and 
in good spirits. Secesh has gone off and left us for the present. 
Clitz is certainly in Richmond, recovering from his wounds. If 
properly supported I will yet take Richmond. Am not in the 
least discouraged ; am in better health than for many months. 
Your father returned to Washington two days ago. 

July 12. I am sure that God will bring us together again 
in this world ; but, whether so or not, we will try so to live that 
we may be reunited in that world where we can be happy for 
ever and never again be parted. ... In this weary world I 
have seen but little happiness save what I have enjoyed with 
you. How very happy our first year of married life was, when

we were together ! So the baby has more teeth ! I suppose 
when I come back I shall find her handling a knife and fork. 
When will she begin to say a word or two ? I hope she will 
not begin to do much before I come home. I want to have the 
fun and satisfaction of watching her progress in life and the 
development of her accomplishments. ... I enclose with this 
a letter from Stanton and my reply, which I want you to pre- 
serve very carefully with my other " archives," as it may be 
important. . . . 

July 13, Sunday, 7.45 A.M. I have ordered all labor sus- 
pended to-day to give the men a chance to think of all they 
have gone through. We are to have service to-day by the 
chaplain of Gregg's regiment Penn. cavalry. Next Sunday I 
think I will invite Mr. Neal to preach for us, provided there is 
any attendance to-day. 

I enclose this in an envelope with some letters I send you ; 
one from Bishop Mcllvaine, which will gratify you, I know ; 
another from some poor fellow in Indiana who has named his 
child after me. If you choose to send out some little present 
to it, well and good. 

1.30 P.M. . . . Had service this morning by the chaplain of 
Gregg's regiment, the Rev. Mr. Egan, an Episcopal clergyman 
of Philadelphia. . . . There never was such an army ; but there 
have been plenty of better generals. When I spoke about being 
repulsed I meant our failure to take Richmond. In no battle 
were we repulsed. We always at least held our own on the field, 
if we did not beat them. ... I still hope to get to Richmond this 
summer, unless the government commits some extraordinarily 
idiotic act ; but I have no faith in the administration, and shall 
cut loose from public life the very moment my country can dis- 
pense with my services. Don't be alarmed about the climate. 
It is not at all bad yet, and we are resting splendidly. The men 
look better every day. So you want to know how I feel about 
Stanton, and what I think of him now ? I will tell you with the 
most perfect frankness. I think ... I may do the man injus- 
tice. God grant that I may be wrong ! For I hate to think that 
humanity can sink so low. But my opinion is just as I have told 
you. He has deceived me once ; he never will again. Are you 
satisfied now, lady mine ? I ever will hereafter trust your judg- 



448 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

ment about men. Your woman's tact and your pure heart make 
you a better judge than my dull apprehension. I remember 
what you thought of Stanton when you first saw him. I thought 
you were wrong. I now know you were right. Enough of the 
creature ! 

Since I reached here I have received about 8,500 or 9,000 
fresh troops. My losses in the battles will not be over 12,000. 
Burnside has 8,000 (about) at Fortress Monroe, where he was 
detained by order of the President. He has been in Washington 
and will probably be here himself to-night, when I will know 
the views of the President. The probability is that I will attack 
again very soon as soon as some losses are supplied. I also 
wish first to get off all the sick and wounded. 

11.30 P.M. Have just been at work dictating my report of 
the recent operations ; got as far as bringing Porter back across 

the Chickahominy. . . . Please reply to Mr. and say that I 

thank him and feel deeply grateful for his trust and kind feeling, 
and that I am glad to say that there is no reason for despon- 
dency on account of my present position. I flatter myself that 
this army is a greater thorn in the side of the rebellion than ever, 
and I most certainly (with God's blessing) intend to take Rich- 
mond with it. ... I trust that we have passed through our 
darkest time, and that God will smile upon us and give us 
victory. . . . 

July 15, 7.30 A.M. ... I was amused at a couple of tele- 
grams yesterday urging me to the offensive as if I were unwill- 
ing to take it myself ! It is so easy for people to give advice 
it costs nothing ! But it is a little more difficult for poor me to 
create men and means, and to wipe out by mere wishes the forces 
of the enemy. I confess that I sometimes become provoked. 

... I had quite an adventure in a small way last night that 
was rather ludicrous. I yesterday sent a flag of truce after some 
wounded men, Sweitzer going on the boat. Well, it appears 
that he and the doctor on board, between them, allowed a young 
English nobleman to come down with them, and Raymond was 
discreet enough to bring him up to headquarters, and was 
apparently quite proud of his prize ; wished me to see him. 
Upon inquiry I found that he came from Richmond, had no 
papers or passports, save a pass from the secesh Secretary of

War, and acknowledged that he had surreptitiously slipped into 
Richmond a couple of weeks ago. This was a pretty kettle of 
fish. I did not like to hang the young rascal for a spy, for fear 
of getting up a row with England. I determined he should not 
go through ; so I this morning sent him back to Secessia, and told 
him to try it again at his peril. The young man was exceedingly 
disgusted, and has, I presume, by this time come to the conclu- 
sion that the fact of being an Englishman is not everywhere a 
sufficient passport. 

July 17, A.M. Gens. Dix and Burnside are both here. . . . 
Burnside is very well, and, if the President permits, will bring me 
large (respectably) reinforcements. . . . Am quite well to-day ; 
a little disgusted at the stupidity of the people in Washington. 
You need not be at all alarmed as to my being deceived by them. 
I know that they are ready to sacrifice me at any moment. I 
shall not be at all surprised to have some other general made 
commander of the whole army, or even to be superseded here. 

7 P.M. . . . You ask me when I expect to reach Richmond 
and whether I shall act on the offensive this summer. I am at 
the mercy of the government. After the first 9,000 or 10,000 men 
sent to me they have withheld all further reinforcements. Burn- 
side is halted at Fortress Monroe. With his own troops and 
those of Hunter he can bring me some 20,000 troops ; but I 
have no idea of the intentions of the government. If I am rein- 
forced to that extent I will try it again with the least possible 
delay. I am not at all in favor of baking on the banks of this 
river, but am anxious to bring matters to an issue. . . . You 
need not be at all alarmed lest any of these people flatter me 
into the belief that they are my friends. It's mighty little 
flattery or comfort I get out of any of them in these days, I 
assure you. . . . 

So you like my letter to the President ? I feel that I did my 
duty in writing it, though I apprehend it will do no good what- 
ever ; but it clears my conscience to have spoken plainly at such 
a time. You do not feel one bit more bitterly towards those peo- 
ple than I do. I do not say much about it, but I fear they have 
done all that cowardice and folly can do to ruin our poor coun- 
try, and the blind people seem not to see it. It makes my blood 
boil when I think of it. I cannot resign so long as the fate of 



45O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the Army of the Potomac is entrusted to my care. I owe a great 
duty to this noble set of men, and that is the only feeling that 
retains me. I fear that my day of usefulness to the country is 
past at least under this administration. I hope and trust that 
God will watch over, guide, and protect me. I accept most 
resignedly all He has brought upon me. Perhaps I have really 
brought it on myself ; for while striving conscientiously to do my 
best, it may well be that I have made great mistakes that my 
vanity does not permit me to perceive. When I see so much 
.self-blindness around me I cannot arrogate to myself greater 
clearness of vision and self-examination. I did have a terrible 
time during that week, for I stood alone, without any one to help 
me. I felt that on me rested everything, and I felt how weak a 
thing poor, mortal, erring man is ! I felt it sincerely, and shall 
never, I trust, forget the lesson ; it will last me to my dying 
day. ... I am very well now, perfectly well, and ready for any 
amount of fatigue that can be imagined. 

July 18, 7.45 A.M. . . . We are to have another very hot 
day, I fancy ; no air stirring, and the atmosphere close and 
murky. I don't at all wish to spend the summer on the 
banks of this river ; we will fry or bake ! If our dear govern- 
ment will show some faint indication of brains or courage we 
can finish the work in a short time. ... I am so sorry that poor 
Prince is going blind. It is a great pity. I flattered myself that 
when I became a poor blind soldier, a second Belisarius, Prince 
would probably lead me about. 

9 P.M. I am inclined now to think that the President will 
make Halleck commander of the army, and that the first pretext 
will be seized to supersede me in command of this army. Their 
game seems to be to withhold reinforcements, and then to relieve 
me for not advancing, well knowing that I have not the means to 
do so. If they supersede me in the command of the Army of the 
Potomac I will resign my commission at once. If they appoint 
Halleck commanding general I will remain in command of this 
army as long as they will allow me to, provided the army is in 
danger and likely to play an active part. I cannot remain as a 
subordinate in the army I once commanded any longer than the 
interests of my own Army of the Potomac require. I owe no 
gratitude to any but my own soldiers here ; none to the govern-

ment or to the country. I have done my best for the country ; 
I expect nothing in return ; they are my debtors, not I theirs. 
... If things come to pass as I anticipate I shall leave the ser- 
vice with a sad heart for my country, but a light one for myself. 
But one thing keeps me at my work love for my country and 
my army. Surely no general had ever better cause to love his 
men than I have tD love mine. 

Confidential To William H. Aspinwall, Esq. Berkley, July 

19, 1862. 

MY DEAR MR. ASPINWALL: I again find myself in a position 
such that I may ere long have to tax your friendship for me. I 
have reason to believe that Gen. Halleck is to be made com- 
mander-in-chief of the army, and, if I am not mistaken, I think I 
detect the premonitory symptoms of still further changes. I can 
get no replies from Washington to any of my despatches. Burn- 
side and his troops are taken out of my hands. I receive no rein- 
forcements, and no hope of them is held out to me. The game 
apparently is to deprive me of the means of moving, and then to 
cut my head off for not advancing. In other words, it is my 
opinion that I will be removed from the command of this army 
in a short time. The present feeling is, I think, merely a con- 
tinuation of the inveterate persecution that has pursued me since 
I landed on the Peninsula weakening my command so as to ren- 
der it inadequate to accomplish the end in view, and then to hold 
me responsible for the result. I am quite weary of this. If I am 
superseded in the command of the Army of the Potomac I shall 
resign my commission in the service, feeling that I can no longer 
be of use ; on the contrary, only in the way. 

Looking forward to that event, my main object in writing to 
you is to ask you to be kind enough to cast your eyes about you 
to see whether there is anything I can do in New York to earn a 
respectable support for my family. I have no exaggerated ideas 
or expectations. All I wish is some comparatively quiet pursuit, 
for I really need rest. Pretty much everything I had has been 
sacrificed in consequence of my re-entering the service, and when 
I leave it I must commence anew and work for my support. 
That I am quite willing to do. 

I know that I need not apologize for troubling you in regard 



452 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

to this matter. Please regard this as confidential, except with 
Mr. Alsop and Mr. Bartlett. 

I am, my dear sir, most sincerely your friend, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN. 

July 20, A.M. . . . Went on the hospital-steamer to see Glitz 
yesterday. He is doing very well. ... I saw all the officers and 
men on board, and tried to cheer them up. The visit seemed to 
do them a great deal of good, and it would have done you good 
to see how the poor, suffering fellows brightened up when they 
saw me. . . . T wonder whether the baby will know me. I fear 
that she will be afraid of me and won't come to me. Would not 
that be mortifying ? I hope the dear little thing will take to me 
kindly. I should feel terribly if she should refuse to have any- 
thing to do with me. Bless her sweet little ladyship! She must 
be a great comfort to you ; and we will be happier than any kings 
and queens on earth, if we three are permitted to be together 
again, and that before May changes much. I want so much to 
see her again while she is a baby, before she begins to talk and 
walk and be human. . . . 

P.M. Which despatch of mine to Stanton do you allude to ? 
The telegraphic one in which I told him that if I saved the army 
I owed no thanks to any one in Washington, and that he had 
done his best to sacrifice my army? It was pretty frank and 
quite true. Of course they will never forgive me for that. I 
knew it when I wrote it ; but as I thought it possible that it 
might be the last I ever wrote, it seemed better to have it exactly 
true. The President, of course, has not replied to my letter, and 
never will. His reply may be, however, to avail himself of the 
first opportunity to cut my head off. I see it reported in this 
evening's papers that Halleck is to be the new general-in-chief. 
Now let them take the next step and relieve me, and I shall once 
more be a free man. . . . 

Later. ... I believe it is now certain that Halleck is com- 
mander-in-chief. I have information this evening from Washing- 
ton, from private sources, which seems to render it quite certain. 
You will have to cease directing your letters to me as command- 
ing United States army, and let the address be, "Commanding 
the Army of the Potomac " quite as proud a title as the other, 
at all events. I shall have to remove the three stars from my 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



453 



shoulders and put up with two. Eh bien ! it is all for the best, 
I doubt not. I hope Halleck will have a more pleasant time in 
his new position than I did when I held it. This, of course, fixes 
the future for us. I cannot remain permanently in the army 
after this slight. I must, of course, stick to this army so long 
as I am necessary to it. ... I have tried to do my best, honestly 
and faithfully, for my country. That I have to a certain extent 
failed I do not believe to be my fault, though my self-conceit 
probably blinds me to many errors that others see. But one use- 
ful lesson I have learned to despise earthly honors and popular 
favor as vanities. I am content. I have not disgraced my name, 
nor will my child be ashamed of her father. Thank God for 
that ! I shall try to get something to do which will make you 
comfortable ; and it will be most pleasant and in the best taste 
for me that we should lead hereafter a rather quiet and retired 
life. It will not do to parade the tattered remnants of my 
departed honors to the gaze of the world. Let us try to live 
for each other and our child, and to prepare for the great change 
that sooner or later must overtake us all. I have had enoogh of 
earthly honors and place. I believe I can give up all and retire 
to privacy once more, a better man than when we gave up our 
dear little home with wild ideas of serving the country. I feel 
that I have paid all that I owe her. I am sick and weary of all 
this business. I am tired of serving fools. God help my coun- 
try ! He alone can save it. It is grating to have to serve under 
the orders of a man whom I know by experience to be my infe- 
rior. But so let it be. God's will be done ! All will turn out 
for the best. My trust is in God, and I cheerfully submit to His 
will. . . . 

July 22, 7.30 A.M. . . . While I think of it, be very careful 
what you telegraph, and tell your father the same thing. I have 
the proof that the secretary reads all my private telegrams. If 
he has read my private letters to you also his ears must have 
tingled somewhat. I am about doing a thing to-day which will, 
I suppose, cause the abolitionists and my other friends to drive 
the last nail in my official coffin. You know that our sick and 
wounded in Richmond are suffering terribly for want of proper 
food, medicines, and hospital supplies. I have ordered a boat- 
load of all such things lemons, tea, sugar, brandy, underclothing, 



454 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

lint, bandages, chloroform, quinine, ice, etc., etc.-*-to be sent up 
to Gen. Lee to-day, to be used at his discretion for the sick and 
wounded of both armies. I know he would not, and could not, 
receive them for our men alone, therefore I can only do it in the 
way I propose, and trust to his honor to apply them properlyr 
half and half. I presume I will be accused now of double-dyed 
treason giving aid and comfort to the enemy, etc. What do 
you think of it ? Am I right or wrong ? . . . I see that the Pope 
bubble is likely to be suddenly collapsed. Stonewall Jackson is 
after him, and the young man who wanted to teach me the art of 
war will in less than a week either be in full retreat or badly 
whipped. He will begin to learn the value of " entrenchments, 
lines of communication and of retreat, bases of supply," etc. 

July 22. It is a lovely afternoon, bright and sunny, a pleasant 
breeze blowing, and everything charming to the eye. The old 
river looks beautiful to-day, as bright as when John Smith, Esq., 
and my dusky ancestress, Madam Pocahontas Rolfe, nte Pow- 
hatan,' paddled her canoe and children somewhere in this vici- 
nity. If it were not for the accompaniments and present sur- 
roundings it would delight me beyond measure to have you here 
to see the scenery and some of the fine old residences which 
stud its banks. The men of two or three generations ago must 
have lived in great state and comfort here. I suspect they had a 
pretty good time, interrupted only by the chills and fever, bad 
luck in gambling and horse-racing, and the trouble of providing 
for their woolly-headed dependants. 

July 23. . . . There is now no doubt about Halleck being 
made commander-in-chief. The other change will, I feel sure, 
follow in a very few days, perhaps a week. . . . 

Popularity, Nell, is a humbug. What good has been done to 
me or to the country by my " popularity " in the North ? It has 
not prevented my enemies from withholding all support from 
me ; it did not hinder them from almost ruining my army ; it 
brings me not a man ; it will not be worth a breath of air to 
prevent Halleck being put in my place. 

July 24. . . . Your father arrived this evening. . . . 
Took a long ride in the sun to-day. . . . Our men look better 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



455 



than ever ; like real veterans now tough, brown, and fearless. 
. . I hear nothing yet from Washington, and must confess that 
I am as indifferent as possible to what they do. If they rein- 
force me I am ready to fight harder than ever, and will give 
Secesh a sharp rub for his capital. If they make it necessary 
for me to resign I am quite ready to do so. ... I presume I 
shall learn something to-morrow about the destination of Burn- 
side. I can then enable you to guess how matters will go. I 
am yet in complete ignorance, being no longer taken into the 
confidence of the "powers that be." . . . You ask me whether 
my self-respect will permit me to remain longer in the service 
after Halleck's appointment ? It will permit me to remain only 
so long as the welfare of the Army of the Potomac demands 
no longer. Don't mind these things ; I bide my time. Whatever 
God sends me, be it defeat and loss of rank, or be it success and 
honor, I will cheerfully submit to. May God help me in this ! 

July 25. . . . Started out early in the morning to review 
Porter's corps, and spent several hours at it in the hot sun. 
Then I went to visit the wounded from Richmond. Then I 
heard that Halleck was here, and was obliged to return to see 
"my master." I think Halleck will support me and give me the 
means to take Richmond. ... I am not to be relieved from the 
command of this army at least that does not seem to be the 
present intention. . . . 

July 26, 9 P.M. . . . From nine this morning until 6.30 this 
evening I have been among the sick and wounded. More than 
a thousand came from Richmond last night and were in the 
steamer. I saw every one of the poor fellows ; talked to them 
all ; heard their sorrows ; tried to cheer them up, and feel 
that I have done my duty towards them. If you could have 
seen how the poor, maimed, brave fellows, some at the point of 
death, brightened up when they saw me and caught my hand, it 
would have repaid you for much of our common grief and 
anxiety. It has been the most harrowing day I ever passed, yet 
a proud one for me, too. I realized how these men love and 
respect me, and I trust that many a poor fellow will sleep more 
soundly and feel more happily to-night for my visit to them. It 
makes them feel that they are not forgotten or neglected when 



456 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



their general comes to see them and console them. My men love 
me very much. What a terrible responsibility this imposes upon 
me ! I pray that God will give me strength to bear it and the 
wisdom to do what is best. It is an awful load that is imposed 
upon me by the trust and affection of these poor fellows. ..." 

July 27. ... I can't tell you how glad I am that I went 
to see all those poor wounded men yesterday. Another batch 
will come to-night, and I will, if possible, go to see all of them 
to-morrow morning. I regard it as a duty I owe the poor fel- 
lows rather a hard one to perform, but still one that cannot 
be neglected. . . . You ask me whether I advised the Pre- 
sident to appoint Halleck. The letter of which I sent you a 
copy is all that ever passed on the subject, either directly or 
indirectly ; not another word than is there written. We never 
conversed on the subject ; I was never informed of his views or 
intentions, and even now have not been officially informed of the 
appointment. I only know it through the newspapers. In all 
these things the President and those around him have acted so 
as to make the matter as offensive as possible. . . . Fitz Porter 
has stuck through it all most nobly. He is all that I thought 
him, and more. Nothing has depressed him ; he is always 
cheerful, active, and ready. 

July 28, 9.15 A.M. . . . Some 500 wounded came down 
last night, and this morning I am going out to the boats to see 
them. I have collected an armful of papers to give the poor 
fellows. . . . 

9.30 P.M. . . . Am very tired, for I saw and talked to 
every one of the wounded men to day, being occupied all day 
at it. Between the closeness of the cabins and being on my 
feet so long I am quite weary. . . . 

I enclose with this some " Lines" a poor wounded fellow 
handed me yesterday and begged me to accept ; they were 
written while he was lying wounded and under fire. I don't 
know that the poetry possesses any peculiar merit, but the 
incident is interesting. My friend was of the Hibernian per- 
suasion. Queer fellows those Irish are. There is a vein of 
humor in everything they do, even when suffering from wounds 
and sickness. I sometimes can hardly keep from laughing 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



457 



when talking with some poor fellow who is desperately wounded 
so strangely and peculiarly do they describe things. ... I 
think I will go to the general hospital to-day and see how 
those poor fellows are getting on. ... I am still " on my back" 
awaiting a decision from Washington. Burnside is still kept 
from me. I am getting no reinforcements, and presume that 
Burnside will be ordered to Washington the first thing I 
know. Then I shall be in a pretty predicament too strong 
to remain here and too weak to advance. . . . 

P.M. . ... I hear nothing as yet from Washington, and 
begin to believe that they intend and hope that I and my army 
may melt away under the hot sun. . . . Secesh is very quiet 
of late scarcely even a cavalry skirmish. He is almost too 
quiet for good, and must be after some mischief. May be we 
will have a visit from Merrimac No. 2. What a row it would 
create among the transports ! I am in hopes that I will receive 
orders of some kind from Washington this evening. I am get- 
ting dreadfully tired of doing nothing. I begin to feel the want 
of a little quiet excitement. I could rest at home away from 
my men, but the idea of remaining quietly in camp, with an 
army about me and an active enemy at some mischief or 
other, is a very different thing. 

10.30 P.M. . . . Nothing to-night from Washington, so that 
I am yet completely in the dark as to the intentions of our benign 
government. 

July 29. What do you think I have been doing for the last 
half-hour? Guess, guess! ! I have been sewing on buttons and 
patching my woollen shirts. I have waited in vain for Charles 
to do anything of the kind, or to have it done, and have been 
nearly scratched to pieces by the numberless pins that were 
necessary to keep myself together. So I dove into the pocket of 
my carpet-bag, and, to my intense delight, found a needle and a 
spool of sewing-silk. Off came my shirt, and at it I went con 
amore. I was so delighted with the result of that operation that 
I pulled out of my trunk a clean one that I had been casting 
sheep's eyes at but found too ragged to wear. That I fixed up, 
and I am now as grand as any king, with two shirts to my name 
that I can wear. My friend Charles has no idea of the advan- 
tages of mending clothes, and, as he has a very short memory, it 



45 8 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

is not of much use to tell him. So you see " how the mighty 
are fallen" the general of a hundred thousand men sewing on 
buttons and mending his own clothes. It carried me back to 
the unhappy days of my miserable bachelorhood. Thank Hea- 
ven that that epoch of my existence is past and gone ! ... By 
the way, did I tell you of that gorgeous smoking-cap that was 
sent to me the other day ? I must take the first opportunity 
to send it home ; it is entirely too magnificent for camp, and I 
fear too much so for me under any circumstances. Should I 
take a fancy to go to a fancy-ball as the Doge of Venice or 
the King of Persia, it might make a first-rate head-dress, but 
would hardly do for anything short of that. We might make 
a look at it a standing reward for the baby whenever she is 
particularly good. I have no doubt it would make her open 
her eyes. 

July 30, 10.15 P.M. Another day elapsed and nothing from 
Washington. I have positive information to-day that the com- 
mand of this army was pressed upon Burnside, and that he per- 
emptorily refused it. I learn that Meigs is very anxious for it ; 
much good may it do him ! I still think, from all that comes 
to me, that the chances are at least that I will be superseded. 
. . . We are relieved to-day by a little excitement. The gun- 
boats reported that six rebel gunboats (including Mr. Merrimac 
No. 2) were on the way down. So we were for some hours con- 
siderably brightened up by the prospect of seeing a shindy ; but 
it turned out to be a false report. ... I see, among other lies, 
that the papers say that the enemy drove off five hundred of 
our beef cattle the other day a lie out of whole cloth. ... I 
am sorry to say that I learn that too much faith must not be 
rested in Halleck. I hope it is not so, but will be very careful 
how far I trust him, or any other man in these days. He has 
done me no good yet. 

July 31. . . . This morning I visited the general hospital 
not far from here, and went through it all, finding the patients 
comfortable and all improving in health. They are nearly all in 
hospital-tents and are well provided for ; in truth, they are about 
as well off as they could be away from home, and many of them 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 



459 



doubtless better off than they would be there. I find the men 
more contented than the officers. I confess that the men enlist 
my sympathies much more warmly than the officers. They are 
so patient and devoted. They have generally entered the ser- 
vice, too, from higher and more unselfish motives. Poor fellows ! 
I can never willingly break the link that unites me to them, and 
shall always be very proud of them and of their love for me, 
even if it is not decreed by Providence that I am to lead them 
to Richmond. After the long time that has elapsed without 
my hearing anything from Washington I can hardly hope to 
learn anything by to-day's mail ; but I assure you that we are 
all becoming very impatient at the long delay here, so unneces- 
sary, as it seems to us. I commenced turning over a new leaf 
to-day ; that is, neither writing nor telegraphing to Washington, 
and have about determined to draw back into my shell until the 
oracle deigns to speak. I have said all I well can ; I have told 
them about all I think and know ; have pointed out to them what 
I regard as the general effects of the course I fear they are likely 
to adopt. Words can no further go. By saying more, and repeat- 
ing what has been already said, I should only render myself 
ridiculous and a bore. So I will be silent, and if they send me 
the order I dread (that of withdrawing this army) I will make 
one last, desperate appeal, and then let matters take their course,, 
confident that I have honestly endeavored to do the best I could,, 
although I may not have done as well as others could. There is 
a great consolation in feeling that one has tried to do right and 
not been actuated by selfish motives. Of the last I know that I 
am free, and would say so were I now on my death-bed. . . . 
Don't feel at all discouraged. If I have to begin the world anew 
and work as hard as ever, it is doubtless all for the best. When 
I return to civil life I shall have the consolation of knowing that 
I am working for you and the baby. I don't know what rest is, 
and probably never shall ; but as long as God gives me health 
and strength, and my mind remains clear, it is better that I 
should work. I am not so fond of it but that I should like to 
rest ; but if that cannot be, I will do my best and try to do my 
duty ever. ... I told you the result of the interview with Hal- 
leek ; thus far practically nothing. Not a word have I heard 
from Washington since his return there. I shall not write or 
telegraph another word until I hear from them, unless something 



4^0 McCLELLAATS OWN STORY. 

of great importance occurs. I shall stand on what is left of 
my dignity now! 

i A.M. ... As I was just about comfortably asleep, 
about three-quarters of an hour ago, I was awakened by a tre- 
mendous shelling. The rascals opened on us with field-guns 
from the other side of the river, and kept up a tremendous fire. 
It is now pretty much over, but still going on ; no shells have 
burst nearer than three hundred or four hundred yards from my 
camp. It took me about five minutes to awaken Marcy ; he did 
not hear a single shot. . . . Still some firing now heavy again ; 
gunboats at work they were very slow in getting ready. A 
queer thing this, writing a letter to my wife, at this time of night, 
to the music of shells ! I fear they must have done some harm. 
Now they are quiet again ; there goes a whopper from the gun- 
boats ! Queer times these ! 

1.30 A.M. Pretty quiet now ; only an occasional shot, appa- 
rently from the gunboats there goes one ! Now another ! Marcy 
and I have just been discussing (another) people in Washington, 
and conclude that they are "a mighty trifling set." Indeed, it is 
evry criminal to leave me thus without one word of information 
as to their plans and purposes. If any lives have been lost 
to-night the guilt (another shot) is on their shoulders, for I told 
them that I desired to occupy with Burnside's troops the very 
point whence this firing has come to-night (another shot) ; but 
I begin to believe that they wish this army to be destroyed. . . . 
2.45. Tired of waiting for Hammerstein's return with the 
news of the damage done. . . . Well, he has just returned. It 
was so dark that no one could tell what the damage was ; one 
man at Fitz Porter's headquarters had his leg shot off ; no ves- 
sels set on fire ; the camps all quiet. 

Aug. i, midnight. . . . Everything quiet since I went 
bed last night ; not a shot fired. We had ten men killed, tweb 
wounded, half a dozen horses killed ; vessels not hurt a bit. 
One shell did fall in my camp. Fitz Porter caught the most of 
the storm, but had only one man killed. This afternoon I sent 
a party across the river to where most of the firing came from, 
to cut down some timber that obstructs the view and burn some 
houses that the enemy had been using as observatories and 
to screen their pickets ; it was all done successfully without 



PRIVATE LETTERS, 461 

opposition. It turned out, as I supposed, that the guns used 
were field-guns, with which they ran away as soon as they found 
the gunboats and our own guns were getting troublesome. . . . 
I had a very friendly letter from Halleck this morning. . . . 

Aug. 2. . . . Circumstances have made it unavoidable for 
me to send out two important expeditions and a large working 
party, although it is Sunday. One of the expeditions goes to 
Malvern, the other on the south side of the James river. ... I 
had quite an interesting visit on the other side to-day. The 
place we burned up yesterday was a very handsome one. It was 
a rather hard case to be obliged to do it, but it could not be 
avoided. . . . 

I had (as usual) not a single word from Washington to-day 
from any one, nor anything from Burnside. If the latter is 
really under orders for the Rappahannock there is something 
very strange in his failure to communicate with me, not even 
giving me the slightest hint of it ; therefore I am disposed to 
discredit Com. Wilkes's report, and to think that he must be mis- 
taken in regard to it. ... If he is ordered to the Rappahannock 
I believe that this army will be withdrawn from here. . . . When 
you contrast the policy I urge in my letter to the President with 
that of Congress and of Mr. Pope, you can readily agree with 
me that there can be little natural confidence between the gov- 
ernment and myself. We are the antipodes of each other ; and 
it is more than probable that they will take the earliest oppor- 
tunity to relieve me from command and get me out of sight. I 
shall endeavor to pursue the plain path of duty. As I have often 
told you, my mind is prepared to endure anything that a man of 
honor can. But I shall consult my own sense of right and my 
own judgment, not deferring to that of others when my own con- 
victions are strong. There are some things to which I cannot 
submit and to which nothing can induce me to yield. . . . 

7.30 A.M., Aug. 3 (same letter). . . . One of my expeditions 
of last night failed : had to come back because the guides lost 
the way ; will try it again to-night or to-morrow. The other one 
not yet heard from, but has, I hope, met with better luck than 
the first. ... Everything quiet during the night ; no firing and 
no stampede of any kind. . . . 



462 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Berkley, Aug. 4, 6.30 P.M. ... I was off on the other side 
of the river all day yesterday, where I had a hot and fatiguing 
tramp on foot, besides getting a little damp in the rain. Our 
enterprises on that side of the river were, quite successful. I 
found a splendid position to cover that bank, so as to enable us 
to cross the army if necessary, as well as to prevent any more 
midnight serenades like that of last week. I now hold the other 
shore with a sufficient number of troops to prevent a surprise. 
Averill went out with three squadrons, met and thrashed an 
entire regiment, drove them to and through their camp, which 
he captured and leisurely destroyed, thus rendering the i3th Va. 
Cavalry exceedingly uncomfortable last night, for all their tents,, 
provisions, cooking utensils, and baggage were effectually burned 
up. He got some prisoners and sabred a respectable number, 
having only two wounded himself. The 5th Regular Cavalry and 
the 3d Penn. Cavalry did the work. . . . 

11.30 P.M. I had a note from Burnside this evening. He 
has been ordered to the Rappahannock, and has, I presume, 
started. Not one word have I heard on that subject from Wash- 
ington. Halleck has begun to show the cloven foot already. . . . 
I have a large expedition out to-night a couple of divisions of 
infantry and some 2,000 cavalry to try to catch the secesh who 
are at Malvern Hill. Shall not hear from them before to-morrow 
noon. Colburn has gone with them. . . . 

7 A.M. Pretty sharp cannonading has been going on in my 
front this morning Hooker's command at Malvern ; they are 
still cracking away pretty sharply. Have not heard details, but 
will ride out in that direction. . . . 

Aug. 5, Malvern Hill, i P.M. (to Gen. Marcy). . . . Hooker 
has been entirely successful in driving off the enemy ; took 
about one hundred prisoners, killed and wounded several. The 
mass escaped under cover of a thick fog. Hooker's dispositions 
were admirable, and nothing but the fog prevented complete 
success. We have lost three killed and eleven wounded, among 
the latter two officers. I shall retain the command here to-night. 
Keep all things ready to move out should we be attacked. I shall 
not return before dark, and may remain all night ; will send in 
for my blankets and ambulance if I stay. I am now starting to 
look over the ground. I have sent a party to communicate with 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 463 

Averill, directing him to take post to-night near Nelson's farm. 
Will send in again as soon as I return from my ride. Excuse 
the illegibility of this, as it is written on horseback, and the 
flies trouble Dan. The enemy in strong force at New Market. 
Better send a special despatch to Halleck and tell him that I 
hate to give up this position. Secesh is under cover, and, though 
he is in strong force, I can beat him if they will give me rein- 
forcements. Send this to Nell if I do not get back in time for 
mail. 

Aug. 7, ii P.M. ... I have been so situated for the last 
two days that I could not write to you. Spent night before last 
at Malvern, and had no means of writing. I came in from there 
yesterday, and was up nearly all night giving orders and securing 
reports in regard to the abandonment of the position. . . . Was 
not very well off at Malvern. My ambulance lost the road, came 
near being bagged by the enemy, and did not make its appear- 
ance until late next day, so I had nothing. I got some coffee 
and some bread from one of the companies, used my saddle- 
blanket and saddle for a bed, and got through the night without 
mishap. 

Aug. 8, Berkley. I can't convey any idea of the heat to-day. 
It has been intense ; not a breath of air stirring. . . . Received 
some reports from Pleasonton that the enemy are pressing him 
hard near Malvern Hill, and gave the necessary orders. ... I am 
in strong hopes that the enemy will be foolish enough to drive 
Pleasonton in and attack me in this position. I have ordered P. 
to draw them on, if possible, and if they come in sight will try to 
keep my men concealed and do my best to induce them to attack 
me. Should they be so foolish as to do that I will surely beat 
them and follow them up to Richmond ; but I fear they are too 
smart for that. I can hardly hope for so much good luck. If it 
is a possible thing to humbug them into an attack I will do it. I 
will issue to-morrow an order giving my comments on Mr. John 
Pope. I will strike square in the teeth of all his infamous 
orders, and give directly the reverse instructions to my army: 
forbid all pillaging and stealing, and take the highest Christian 
ground for the conduct of the war. Let the government gainsay 
it if they dare. I am willing to fall in such a cause. I will not 



464 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

permit this army to degenerate into a mob of thieves, nor will I 
return these men of mine to their families as a set of wicked and 
demoralized robbers. I will never have that sin on my con- 
science. ... I have received my orders from Halleck ; I can- 
not tell you what they are, but if you will bear in mind what I 
have already written to you, you can readily guess them when 
I say that they are as bad as they can be, and that I regard them 
as almost fatal to our cause. I have remonstrated as warmly as 
I know how to do, but to no avail. My only hope is that I can 
induce the enemy to attack me. I shall, of course, obey the 
orders, unless the enemy give me a very good opening, which I 
should at once avail myself of. I have learned through private 
sources that they have not yet determined how to dispose of me 
personally. Their game is to force me to resign ; mine will be to 
force them to place me on leave of absence, so that when they 
begin to reap the whirlwind that they have sown I may still be 
in position to do something to save my country. With all their 
faults, I do love my countrymen, and if I can save them I will 
yet do so. ... 

I had another letter from Halleck to-night. I strongly bus- 
pect him. 

Aug. . . . . Shortly after that a wind-storm set in with 
great violence ; it knocked over my desk and broke it. The desk 
fell on the table and broke one leaf off ; it broke my " monkey " 
(did you know I had a menagerie ?), * scattered my papers to 
the four corners of the tent, and brought all the orderlies in 
with a terrific rush. Finally they righted and gathered every- 
thing together, so that I am now comfortable again, except 
damages and the flies. The gust has cooled the air, however, 
so we are gainers. No rain has fallen here, but the wind is from 
our dear old North, and is therefore doubly pleasant to me. 
The fact is, I don't like the South ; it is entirely too hot to suit 
me, and I am sure I don't envy the possessors of it in the least 
I wish you could see what a business I am doing, as I write, ii 
the way of spearing flies ; every time, nearly, that I dip the pei 
in the inkstand out comes a defunct fly. I am so glad y<

visited that hospital. I thank you for it from the bottom of my 
heart. I know it did them infinite good, and I am sure that 
you will never meet one of the Army of the Potomac without 
a kind word and your brightest smile. 

Aug. 10, 8 A.M. . . . Halleck is turning out just like the 
rest of the herd. The affair is rapidly developing itself, and I 
see more clearly every day their settled purpose to force me to 
resign. I am trying to keep my temper. I have no idea that 
I will be with this army more than two or three weeks longer, 
and should not be surprised any day or hour to get my " walk- 
ing-papers." . . . 

4. P.M. . . . The absurdity of Halleck's course in ordering 
the army away from here is that it cannot possibly reach Wash- 
ington in time to do any good, but will necessarily be too late. 
I am sorry to say that I am forced to the conclusion that H. is 
very dull and very incompetent. Alas, poor country ! I hope 
to be ready to-morrow afternoon to move forward in the direc- 
tion of Richmond. I will try to catch or thrash Longstreet, and 
then, if the chance offers, follow in to Richmond while they are 
lamming away at Pope. It is in some respects a desperate step, 
but it is the best I can do for the nation just now, and I would 
rather even be defeated than retreat without an effort to relieve 
Washington in the only way at all possible. If I fail, why well 
and good. I will fall back. If I win I shall have saved my 
country, and will then gracefully retire to private life. ... I 
am getting the sick away quite rapidly now, but they are in large 
numbers, and it is at best a slow process. The heavy baggage 
is all being stored on board ship, so that in whatever direction 
we move we will be comparatively unencumbered. I shall send 
off all that I have, except a carpet-bag and pair of blankets, 
change my large tent for a " wall-tent," and go about as light 
as any of them. I half apprehend that they will be too quick 
for me in Washington, and relieve me before I have the chance 
of making the dash. If so, well and good. I am satisfied that 
the dolts in Washington are bent on my destruction, if it is pos- 
sible for them to accomplish it. ... 

Midnight. ... I received a very harsh and unjust tele- 
gram from Halleck this morning, and a very friendly private 
letter from the same individual blows hot and cold. I replied 



466 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

to his telegram, closing by quietly remarking : " The present 
moment is probably not the proper one for me to refer to the 
unnecessarily harsh and unjust tone of your telegrams of late. 
It will, however, make no difference in my official action." 
Under the circumstances I feel compelled to give up the idea 
of my intended attack upon Richmond, and must retrace my 
steps. Halleck writes that all the forces in Virginia, including 
Pope, Burnside, etc., are to be placed under my command ; I 
doubt it. They are committing a fatal error in withdrawing me 
trom here, and the future will show it. I think the result of 
their machination will be that Pope will be badly thrashed within 
ten days, and that they will be very glad to turn over the redemp- 
tion of their affairs to me. . . . 

Aug. ii. I am free to chat with you for a few minutes, at 
least until the impetuous Hatter rushes in and asks " the 
general to be good enough to come to breakfast." Our break- 
fasts are not very splendid or tempting just now ; probably a 
little ham or beefsteak, coffee, bread and butter ; never any ice 
for breakfast that is, very seldom, if ever ; and hot as blazes. 
In this climate one needs cool and light food, fruit, etc.; but 
we don't get much of that sort of thing. 

. . . Have been hard at work all day, and expect to keep at 
it until I get this army away from Fortress Monroe, unless my 
head is chopped off in the meantime a circumstance I am in 
the daily expectation of occurring, and can't say that I much 
dread. ... I presume Pope is having his hands quite full to- 
day ; is probably being hard pressed by Jackson. I cannot help 
him in time, as I have not the means of transportation ; but I 
foresee that the government will try to throw upon me the blame 
of their own delays and blunders. So be it. I have learned to 
endure, and shall continue to as long as the good of the country 
requires that I shall do so ; but not one moment longer than 
that. 

P.M. . . . You see that Halleck has done otherwise than 
to reinforce me ; quite the reverse. Burnside is at Acquia. I 
strongly suspect that one reason for their not imparting their 
plans to me is that they have very few to impart ; they are drift- 
ing, not steering the poor Ship of State, and I fear they will be 
wrecked ere long. ... If they do read our letters in Washington 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 467 

they must feel one ear tingle occasionally ! . . . You need not 
dread any engagement at present. The " powers " won't let 
me go after the enemy, and I am quite sure they won't be 
kind enough to come after me. It is scarcely possible that 
we can have anything more than a mere affair of rear-guards. 
I don't think now that will occur ; so make your mind quite 
easy. . . . 

Cherrystone Inlet, Aug. 14, 2 A.M. Left camp yesterday 
morning at seven o'clock in a gunboat to go to the telegraph- 
station at Jamestown island, so that I could talk with Halleck 
with less loss of time. On arriving there I found that the wires 
were not working through, and went straight on to Fortress 
Monroe, arriving there about 8.30 P.M. There I ascertained 
that the cable to this place was broken, so I took a steamer 
and came over here, arriving at eleven P.M. Halleck came to 
the Washington office about one and a half or two hours ago ; 
I have sent him several telegrams, and his first reply is just 
arriving in cipher. I presume I am in for sitting up all night. 
The steamer is about two miles from here ; came that distance 
in a row-boat. This is an abandoned secesh city, consisting of 
one house in the wilderness ; so I am not likely to be disturbed. 
Porter, Ingalls, Colburn, and Key are with me. They are all 
sound asleep, so I have no one to distract my attention. I must 
confess, however, that as I went to bed very late last night, and 
have had no slee,p since the morning, I am rather sleepy myself ; 
but I can't just now indulge in the luxury. 

3.30 A.M. . . . We have just got back to the steamer, and 
I am getting under way to return to Fort Monroe, where I go 
direct to camp in a fast boat. My communication with Halleck 
was unsatisfactory in the extreme. He did not even behave 
with common politeness ; he is a Men mauvais sujet he is not 
a gentleman. ... I am writing by a dim light, and confess 
that I am very tired and very much disgusted. I fear that I 
am very mad, and think I have a perfect right to be so. ... 
Every day convinces me more and more that it is the in- 
tention of Halleck and the government to drive me off, and 
I begin to feel that I cannot preserve my self-respect and 
remain in the service much longer. I think the crisis will soon 
arrive. 



468 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

Berkley, Aug. 14. Returned about noon. On my way down 
I stopped at the site of the old settlement of Jamestown. There 
is nothing left of it but the brick tower of the church and the 
churchyard. The oldest tombstone I could decipher was of 1698. 
I saw one of a poor young wife, only sixteen years and eleven 
months. I plucked a couple of poor little flowers from the site 
of the church and enclose them in this, only to show you that 
you are sometimes in my thoughts. . . . Porter's corps starts 
this evening, Franklin in the morning, the remaining three 
to-morrow and next day. Headquarters will remain here until 
nearly the last. We are going, not to Richmond, but to Fort 
Monroe, I am ashamed to say ! ... It is a terrible blow to 
me, but I have done all that could be done to prevent it, with- 
out success, so I must submit as best I can and carry it out. 
I shall, of course, conduct the march to Fortress Monroe and 
attend to the embarkation thence ; my mind is pretty much 
made up to try hard to break off at that point. 

Aug. 17, 3 P.M., Barrett's Ferry , Chickahominy. ... I have 
the greater part of the army now over, and if we are not dis- 
turbed for six hours more all will be well. I have abandoned 
neither men nor material, and the " retreat" has been conducted 
in the most orderly manner, and is a perfect success, so far as so 
disgusting an operation can be. I learn that all the troops in 
Virginia are to be placed under my command. Burnside came 
down to assure me from Halleck that he (H.) is really my friend 
qu'il soit ! ... I hope to get everything over to-night, and 
will be at my old headquarters at Williamsburg to-morrow even- 
ing ; next day at Yorktown. If all is then quiet I will go thence 
by water to Fortress Monroe and complete the arrangements for 
embarking. ... I took a savage satisfaction in being the last 
to leave my camp at Berkley yesterday ! . . . 

Aug. 1 8, P.M., Williamsburg. . . . Am pretty well tired 
out, for I have been much in the saddle lately, besides having 
slept very little. ... I crossed the Chickahominy yesterday 
and remained there to-day until all the troops had crossed and 
moved several miles in advance. When I left, the bridge was 
taken up and nothing but a few worthless stragglers left behind. 
They will all be brought over to-night, I think ; though, so far 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 469 

as they are concerned individually, I would much prefer that 
secesh should capture them all. I have made a remarkably suc- 
cessful retreat ; left absolutely- nothing behind. Secesh can't 
find one dollar's worth of property if he hunts a year for it. I 
have not seen the enemy since we started, and I rather doubt 
whether he knows where we are rrow. ... It will take a long 
time to embark this army and have it ready for action on the 
banks of the Potomac. . . . The men all know that I am not 
responsible. I have remained constantly with the rear-guard ; 
was the very last one to leave our camp at Berkley; remained 
on the Chickahominy until the bridge was removed, and still 
have the proud satisfaction of hearing the cheers of the men as 
I pass, seeing their faces brighten up. ... Strange as it may 
seem, they have not, I think, lost one particle of confidence in 
me, and love me just as much as ever. Pleasonton has done 
splendidly. I placed him in command of the rear-guard of the 
main column, and nothing could have been better than his per- 
formance ; he is really a fine officer, cool, collected, and intelli- 
gent. ... I have felt every moment that I was conducting a 
false movement, and which was altogether against my own judg- 
ment and that of the army. I have done it without demoralizing 
the army. . . . 

Fortress Monroe, Aug. 20, A.M. Arrived here yesterday 
afternoon. The " retreat " is successfully accomplished and the 
troops have commenced embarking ; a good many have left 
already. 

Aug. 21, 4 P.M. {Fort Monroe). Have just returned from an 
examination of this fort and the Rip Raps. . . . The whole of 
Porter's corps got off last night. Heintzelman from Yorktown 
to-day. Franklin commences to embark here and at Newport 
News to-morrow. Sumner will reach here to-morrow and com- 
mence embarking as soon as transports are ready, probably in a 
couple of days. I do not know what they intend doing with me. 
I still think they will place me on the shelf or do something dis- 
agreeable to get me out of the way. I shall be glad of any- 
thing that severs my connection with such a set. ... I have 
had nothing from Washington to-day. As they do not see fit 
to give me any information either as to their intentions or 



47O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

their situation, I shall ask no more questions, nor will I make 
any more suggestions. They may go to the deuce in their own 
way, and I think are moving in that direction with sufficient 
rapidity to gratify secesh exceedingly. . . . 

Met with a terrible misfortune to-day. In entering the ambu- 
lance I tore the last uniform coat I had, except that one an inch 
thick, which I cannot well wear in this hot weather. So I am in 
citizen's dress. I shall be in a terrible predicament for citizen's 
clothes when I come home, and will have to remain perdu in the 
daytime until I get some clothes to wear, for it will not do for me 
to appear in uniform. 

8 P.M. Just received a telegram from Halleck stating that 
Pope and Burnside are very hard pressed, urging me to push 
forward reinforcements and to come myself as soon as I possibly 
can! I am going to the Fortress now to hurry on my arrange- 
ments; shall put headquarters on board a vessel to-morrow morn- 
ing, and probably go myself in a fast boat to-morrow afternoon. 
Now they are in trouble they seem to want the " Quaker," the 
"procrastinator," the "coward," and the "traitor"! Bien, my 
ambulance is ready and I must go. 

Aug. 22, 10 A.M. ... I did not get back from the Fort 
until some time after midnight, and too tired to write. ... I shall 
go to the Fort pretty soon, and as soon as the tents are dry move 
everything on board the vessels, so that I shall be ready to start at 
a moment's notice. I have two corps off and away. ... I think 
they are all pretty well scared in Washington, and probably with 
good reason. I am confident that the disposition to be made of 
me will depend entirely upon the state of their nerves in Wash- 
ington. If they feel safe there I will, no doubt, be shelved ; per- 
haps placed in command here vice Gen. Dix. I don't care what 
they do ; would not object to being kept here for a while, 
because I could soon get things in such condition that I could 
have you here with me. . . . Their sending for me to go to 
Washington only indicates a temporary alarm. If they are at all 
reassured you will see that they will soon get rid of me. I shall 
be only too happy to get back to quiet life again ; for I am truly 
and heartily sick of the troubles I have had, and am not fond of 
being a target for the abuse and slander of all the rascals in the 
country. Well, we will continue to trust in God and feel certain 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 471 

that all is for the best. It is often difficult to understand the 
ways of Providence; but I have faith enough to believe that 
nothing is done without some great purpose. . . . 

Aug. 23, 9.30 P.M., Steamer " City of Hudson'' I am off at 
last and on the way to Acquia. 

We are pounding along up the Potomac now, and, as the 
boat is a fast one, are passing everything we find. . . . We will 
reach Acquia some time after midnight. Early in the morning I 
will telegraph to Halleck informing him of my arrival and asking 
for orders. I have no idea what they will be, nor do I know 
what has been happening on the Rappahannock yesterday and 
to-day. I take it for granted that my orders will be as disagree- 
able as it is possible to make them, unless Pope is beaten, in 
which case they will want me to save Washington again. No- 
thing but their fears will induce them to give me any command 
of importance or to treat me otherwise than with discourtesy.

"MY DEAR MAC : I've just arrived from Washington and have 
not time to get ready to go up this morning, but will to-morrow. 
I've much to say to you and am very anxious to see you. . . . 
The President has ordered me to remain here for the present, 
and when I asked him how long he said five or six days. I 
don't know what it means ; but I do know, my dear Mac, that

" MY DEAR MAC : I'm laid up with a lame leg, and besides 
am much worried at the decision they have chosen to make in 
regard to your army. From the moment I reached Washington 
I feared it would be so, and I am of the opinion that your 
engineers had much to do with bringing about the determina- 
tion. When the conclusion was arrived at I was the only one 
who advocated your forward movement. I speak now as if a 
positive decision had been arrived at, which I do not know, and 
you, of course, do ; my present orders indicate it. But you know 
what they are, and all about it, so I will accept it as something 
that is ordered for the best. Let us continue to give our undi- 
vided support to the cause, and all will be well. It looks dark 
sometimes, but a just God will order everything for the best. 
We can't expect to have it all as we wish. I'm off for my desti-

HALLECK TO McCLELLAN. 

Unofficial. 

"WASHINGTON, July 30, 1862. 

" Maj.-Gen. G. B. McClellan, Commanding, etc., Army of the 
Potomac : 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : You are probably aware that I hold 
my present position contrary to my own wishes, and that I did 
everything in my power to avoid coming to Washington. But 
after declining several invitations from the President I received 
the order of the nth instant, which left me no option. 

" I have always had strong personal objections to mingling 
in the politico-military affairs of Washington. I never liked the 
place, and I like it still less at the present time. But, aside from 
personal feelings, I really believed that I could be much more 
useful in the West than here. I had acquired some reputation 
there, but here I could hope for none, and I greatly feared that, 
whatever I might do, I should receive more abuse than thanks. 
There seemed to be a disposition in the public press here to cry 
down any one who attempted to serve the country instead of 
party. This was particularly the case with you, as I understand, 
and I could not doubt that it would be in a few weeks the case 
with me. Under these circumstances I could not see how I 
could be of much use here. Nevertheless, being ordered, I was 
obliged to come. 

" In whatever has occurred heretofore you have had my full 
approbation and cordial support. There was no one in the army 
under whom I could serve with greater pleasure. And I now 
ask of you that same support and co-operation, and that same 
free interchange of opinion, as in former days. If we should 
disagree in opinion I know that we will do so honestly and 
without unkind feelings. The country demands of us that we 
act together and with cordiality. I believe that we can and will 
do so. Indeed, we must do so if we expect to put down this 
rebellion. If we permit personal jealousies to interfere for a 



474 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

single moment with our operations we shall not only injure the 
cause but ruin ourselves. But I am satisfied that neither of us 
will do this, that we will work together with all our might to 
bring the war to an early termination. 

" I have written to you frankly, assuring you of my friendship 
and confidence, believing that my letter would be received with 
the same kind feelings in which it is written. 
"Yours truly, 

" H. W. HALLECK." 



HALLECK TO McCLELLAN. 

" HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 

"WASHINGTON, Aug. 7, 1862. 
" Maj.-Gen. McClellan, Berkley : 

"MY DEAR GENERAL: Your private letter of the ist instant 
was received a day or two ago, but I have been too busy to 
answer it sooner. 

" If you still wish it I will order Barnard here ; but I cannot 
give you another engineer officer (unless you will take Benham), 
for you already have a larger proportion than any one else. I 
had most of the time in the West only two, and you, with no 
larger force, have a dozen engineer officers. 

" I fully agree with you in regard to the manner in which the 
war should be conducted, and I believe the present policy of the 
President to be conservative. I think some of Gen. Pope's orders 
very injudicious, and have so advised him ; but as I understand 
they were shown to the President before they were issued, I felt 
unwilling to ask him to countermand them. An oath of alle- 
giance taken through force is not binding, and to put over the 
lines those who do not take it is only adding numbers to the 
rebel army. What he has made the general rule should only be 
the exceptions, and I have so advised him. 

" I deeply regret that you cannot agree with me as to the 
necessity of reuniting the old Army of the Potomac. I, how- 
ever, have taken the responsibility of doing so, and am willing to 
risk my reputation on it. As I told you when at your camp, it is 
my intention that you shall command all the troops in Virginia 
as soon as we can get them together, and with the army thus 
concentrated I am certain that you can take Richmond. 



STANTON TO McCLELLAN. 



475 



" I must beg of you, general, to hurry along this movement ; 
your reputation as well as mine may be involved in its rapid exe- 
cution. I cannot regard Pope and Burnside as safe until you 
reinforce them. Moreover, I wish them to be under your imme- 
diate command, for reasons which it is not necessary to specify. 
As things now are, with separate commands, there will be no con- 
cert of action, and we daily risk being attacked and defeated in 
detail. 

<s I would write you more fully, but nearly all my time is 
occupied with the new drafts and enlistments. They are doing 
well, but several weeks must elapse before we can get the troops 
into the field. 

"Bragg seems to be concentrating a large force against Buell, 
and the latter is asking for reinforcements. When he will reach 
Chattanooga is a problem I am unable to solve.*

lead you on to victory.* 

" Yours truly, 

"EDWIN M. STANTON." 

GEN. McCLELLAN TO SECRETARY STANTON. 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
CAMP NEAR HARRISON'S LANDING, VA., July 8, 1862. 

DEAR SIR : Your letter of the 5th instant by Gen. Marcy 
has made a deep impression on my mind. Let me, in the first 
place, express my sympathy with you in the sickness of your 
child, which I trust may not prove fatal. 

I shall be better understood by you, and our friendly rela- 
tions will become more fixed, if I am permitted to recur briefly 
to the past. 

When you were appointed Secretary of War I considered you 
my intimate friend and confidential adviser. Of all men in the 
nation you were my choice for that position. 

It was the unquestionable prerogative of the President to 
determine the military policy of the administration and to se- 
lect the commanders who should carry out the measures of the 
government. To any action of this nature I could, of course, 
take no personal exception. 

But from the time you took office your official conduct 
towards me as commander-in-chief of the army of the United 
States, and afterwards as commander of the Army of the Poto- 
mac, was marked by repeated acts done in such manner as to 
be deeply offensive to my feelings and calculated to affect me 
injuriously in public estimation. 

After commencing the present campaign your concurrence 
in the withholding of a large portion of my force, so essential 
to the success of my plans, led me to believe that your mind 
was warped by a bitter personal prejudice against me. 

Your letter compels me to believe that I have been mistaken 
in regard to your real feelings and opinions, and that your con- 
duct, so unaccountable to my own fallible judgment, must have

proceeded from views and motives which I did not understand. 
I have made this frank statement because I thought that it 
would best accord with the spirit of your communication. 

It is with a feeling of great relief that I now say to you that 
I shall at once resume on my part the same cordial confidence 
which once characterized our intercourse. 

You have more than once told me that together we could 
save this country. It is yet not too late to do so. 

To accomplish this there must be between us the most entire 
harmony of thought and action, and such I offer you. 

The crisis through which we are passing is a terrible one. 

I have briefly given in a confidential letter to the President 
my views (please ask to see it) as to the policy which ought to 
govern this contest on our part. 

You and I during last summer so often talked over the whole 
subject that I have only expressed the opinions then agreed upon 
between us. 

The nation will support no other policy. None other will 
call forth its energies in time to save our cause. For none other 
will our armies continue to fight. 

I have been perfectly frank with you. Let no cloud hereafter 
arise between us. 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

Hon. E. M. STANTON, 

Secretary of War. 

Note by the Editor. There is no more sorrowful page in the story 
of men and of peoples than this, in which it becomes necessary, for the 
truth of history, to bring together the evidence of a war secretary's pri- 
vate treason to the general in the field, fighting his country's battles. It 
is unnecessary to draw on the countless sources of private evidence which 
exist, since the testimony of Secretaries Chase and Welles, and Postmaster- 
General Blair, his associates in Mr. Lincoln's cabinet, suffice, without 
extending the miserable record of Mr. Stanton's falsehood and shame, to 
show his continuous personal hostility to Gen. McClellan from the time 
of his entering the cabinet in January, at the precise date of writing the 
above telegram and letter of July 5, and during the rest of McClellan's 
campaigns. 

Mr. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy in the cabinet with Mr. 
Stanton, in his work, "Lincoln and Seward," New York, 1874, says : 



HOSTILITY OF STAN TON. 479 

(P. iqo) "With the change in the War Department in Jan., 1862, 
came the hostility of Secretary Stanton to McClellan, then general-in-chief." 

(P. 191) "This unwise letter [the Harrison's Bar letter] and the 
reverses of the army, with the active hostility of Stanton, brought Hal- 
leek, a vastly inferior man, to Washington. . . . On coming to Washing- 
ton, Pope, who was ardent and, I think, courageous, though not always 
discreet, very naturally fell into the views of Secretary Stanton, who 
improved every opportunity to denounce McClellan and his hesitating policy. 
Pope also reciprocated the commendations bestowed on him by Halleck, 
by uniting with Stanton and Gen. Scott in advising that McClellan should 
be superseded and Halleck placed in charge of military affairs at Wash- 
ington. This, combined with the movements and the disasters before 
Richmond, and his own imprudent letter, enabled Stanton to get rid of 
McClellan at headquarters. 

(P. 193) " But Pope was defeated, and the army, sadly demoralized, 
came retreating to the Potomac. The War Department, and especially 
Stanton and Halleck, became greatly alarmed. On the 3oth August, in 
the midst of these disasters, and before the result had reached us, though 
most damaging information in regard to McClellan, who lingered at Alex- 
andria, was current, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Chase, called upon 
me with a protest, signed by himself and Stanton, denouncing the conduct 
of McClellan and demanding his immediate dismissal. Two other mem- 
bers were ready to append their names after mine. I declined to sign 
the paper, which was in the handwriting of Stanton ; not that I did not 
disapprove of the course of the general, but because the combination was 
improper and disrespectful to the President. ... I had doubted the wis- 
dom of recalling the Army of the Potomac from Richmond, therein dif- 
fering from Chase and Stanton. The object in bringing that army back to 
Washington, in order to start a new march overland and regain the abandoned 
position, I did not ttnderstand, unless it was to get rid of McClellan.^ . . 
The President never knew, of this paper, but was not unaware off the 
popular feeling against that officer, in which he .sympathized, and of the 
sentiments of the members of the cabinet, aggravated by the hostility 
and strong if not exaggerated rumors sent otit by the Secretary of War. 
Both Stanton and Halleck were, however, filled with apprehensions 
beyond others, as the army of stragglers and broken battalions, on the 
last of August and first of September, came rushing toward Washing- 
ton." 

Mr. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury in the same cabinet, writ- 
ing shortly after Sept. 2, 1862, says : 

"From the day the President told me McClellan was beaten, and I 
saw his despatches announcing his retreat towards the James river, 
I never entertained a doubt of the necessity of withdrawing the army 
altogether, if it was to remain under his command, and I expressed this 
opinion at once to the President. The military men said that to attempt 
to withdraw the army would involve the loss of all its material, ammu- 
nition, guns, provisions, and stores." 

Mr. Chase then refers to the visit of Gen. Marcy at Washington (on 
which occasion Mr. Stanton's letter of July 5 was written), and what Gen. 
Marcy had said, and continues : 

"The danger of withdrawal ; the impossibility of strengthening the 
army for an advance on Richmond from the position to which it had 
retreated ; the certainty that no vigorous effort would be made by 



McCLELLAN*S QWX 



McClellan, by unexpected blows south of the James, to retrieve the disas- 
ters north of it ; the possibility of the loss of the entire army convinced 
me, and convinced the Secretary of War, that the command of the Army of 
the Potomac should be given to some more active officer. We proposed 
to the President to send Pope to the James, and give Mitchell the command 
of the army in front of Washington, which . . . had been placed under 
Pope. The President was not prepared for anything so decisive, and 
sent for Halleck and made him commander-in-chief " (Schuckers's ' Li'fe, 
etc., of S. P. Chase," p. 447). 

After Pope's defeat Mr. Chase says : 

"The President . . . himself gave the command of the fortifications 
and the troops for the defence of Washington to McClellan. It was 
against my protest and that of the Secretary of War " (ibid. p. 450). 

Aug. 29 Mr. Chase writes : 

" The Secretary of War called on me in reference to Gen. McClellan. 
He has long believed, and so have I, that Gen. McClellan ought not to 
be trusted with the command of any army of the Union, and the events 
of the last few days have greatly strengthened our judgment. We 
called on ... Gen. Halleck and remonstrated against Gen. McClellan 
commanding. Secretary wrote and presented to Gen. H. a call for a 
report touching McC.'s disobedience of orders and consequent delay of 
support to Army of Virginia ; Gen. H. promised answer to-morrow morn- 
ing " (Warden's " Account, etc., of S. P. Chase," p. 456). 

On Aug. 30 Mr. Chase states that he and Mr. Stanton prepared and 
signed a paper expressing their judgment of McClellan (ibid. p. 456). 

Sept. i Mr. Chase sfates : " On suggestion of Judge Bates, the remon- 
strance against McClellan, which had been previously signed by Smith, 
was modified ; and, having been further slightly altered on my suggestion, 
was signed by Stanton, Bates, and myself, and afterward by Smith. 
Welles declined to sign it, on the ground that it might seem unfriendly 
to the President, though this was the exact reverse of its intent. He said 
he agreed in opinion, and was willing to express it personally. This deter- 
mined us to await the cabinet meeting to morrow" (ibid. p. 458). 

The testimony of Postmaster-General Blair will be found further on 
in connection with accounts of the cabinet meeting on Sept. 2, as given 
by Secretaries Chase and Welles. When Mr. Stanton had succeeded, as 
he supposed, in depriving McClellan of command by his ironical order 
of Aug. 30, and when the peril of the capital and country led Mr. Lin- 
coln on Sept. 2 to appeal to McClellan to save them, Mr. Stanton openly 
declared, says Mr. Blair, that he would rather see the capital lost than 
McClellan restored to command. 



CHAPTER XXIX. 

The army at Harrison's Bar Indecision at Washington The Harrison's 
Bar letter Army ordered home Protests of McClellan On the 
bank of the James river the fate of the Union should be decided 
Transportation not provided Withdrawal of ihe army Transfer to 
front of Washington. 

WHEN the troops reached the James the first want of the men 
was something to eat and drink, and the next a bath in the river. 
As I rode among the men they would cry to me for their supper, 
and upon my assuring them that they should have it they would 
give their usual cheers and be perfectly content. For two or 
three days after we reached Harrison's Bar the banks of the river 
were crowded all day long with the men bathing. 

It should be understood that in time of action every army 
reduces itself into two of unequal strength one, the fighting 
men, who stick by their colors as long as life and strength last, 
and are ever ready to meet the enemy ; the other consisting of 
the weaker men, and those prone to straggle, and those not too 
fond of unnecessary combat. The better the discipline of the 
army, the larger the first category, and vice versa. It must be 
confessed that the contingent of stragglers was pretty large on 
our arrival at the James, but after a day or two all had rejoined 
their colors and were ready for work again. 

A very few days sufficed to give the men the necessary rest, 
and the army was then in condition to make any movement 
justified by its numbers, and was in an admirable position for 
an offensive movement. It was at last upon its true line of 
operations, which I had been unable to adopt at an earlier day 
in consequence of the Secretary of War's peremptory order of 
the 1 8th of May requiring the right wing to be extended to the 
north of Richmond in order to establish communication with 
Gen. McDowell. Gen. McDowell was then under orders to 
advance from Fredericksburg, but never came, because, in spite 
of his earnest protest, these orders were countermanded from 



482 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Washington, and he was sent upon a fruitless expedition towards 
the Shenandoah instead of being permitted to join me, as he 
could have done, at the time of the affair of Hanover Court- 
House. 

I urged in vain that the Army of the Potomac should remain 
on the line of the James, and that it should resume the offensive 
as soon as reinforced to the full extent of the means in possession 
of the government. Had the Army of the Potomac been per- 
mitted to remain on the line of the James I would have crossed 
to the south bank of that river, and, while engaging Lee's atten- 
tion in front of Malvern, have made a rapid movement in force 
on Petersburg, having gained which I would have operated 
against Richmond and its communications from the west, hav- 
ing already gained those from the south. 

Subsequent events proved that Lee did not move northward 
from Richmond with his army until assured that the Army of the 
Potomac was actually on its way to Fort Monroe, and they also 
found that, so long as the Army of the Potomac was on the James, 
Washington and Maryland would have been entirely safe under 
the protection of the fortifications and a comparatively small part 
of the troops then in that vicinity ; so that Burnside's troops and 
a large part of the Union Army of Virginia might, with entire pro- 
priety, have been sent by water to join the army under my com- 
mand, which with detachments from the West could easily have 
been brought up to more than 100,000 men disposable on the 
actual field of battle. 

In spite of my most pressing and oft-repeated entreaties, the 
order was insisted upon for the abandonment of the Peninsula 
line and the return of the Army of the Potomac to Washington 
in order to support Gen. Pope, who was in no danger so long as 
the Army of the Potomac remained on the James. With a heavy 
heart I relinquished the position gained at the cost of so much 
time and blood. 

As an evidence of my good faith in opposing this movement 
it should be mentioned that Gen. Halleck had assured me, ver- 
bally and in writing, that I was to command all the troops in 
front of Washington, including those of Gens. Burnside and 
Pope a promise which was not carried into effect. 

On the ist of July I received the following from the Presi- 
dent : 



GEN. BARNARD'S VIEWS. 483 

" It is impossible to reinforce you for your present emergency. 
If we had a million of men we could not get them to give you 
in time. We have not the men to send. If you are not strong 
enough to face the enemy you must find a place of security and 
wait, rest, and repair. 

" Maintain your ground if you can, but save the army at all 
events, even if you fall back to Fort Monroe. We still have 
strength enough in the country, and will bring it out." 

In a despatch from the President to me on the 2d of July he 
says : 

" If you think you are not strong enough to take Richmond 
just now, I do not ask you to. Try just now to save the army 
material and personnel, and I will strengthen it for the offensive 
again as fast as I can. 

" The governors of eighteen (18) States offer me a new levy 
of 300,000, which I accept." 

On the 2d of July the following was received from Gen. 
Barnard : 

Private. 

" HEADQUARTERS, July 2, 1862. 

"DEAR GENERAL: It seems to me the only salvation is for 
this army to be ready promptly to reassume the offensive. 

" For this we must immediately push our forces further for- 
ward, or we are bagged. Besides being able to shell us out, the 
enemy will entrench us in, and, shutting us up here with a small 
force, be off for Washington. 

"The fresh troops (how many?) now here or on the river 
ought to enable us to push out at once and to assume an offen- 
sive as soon as our old army can be rested. 

" But we need large reinforcements. The state of affairs is 
concealed in Washington to hide their own blunders, and the 
country will not respond to the crisis unless it is known. We 
need 200,000 more men to fill up the ranks and form new regi- 
ments. 

" A large part of Halleck's force, all that can be withdrawn, 
should come from the West. 

" There is no use in writing. Should you not send at once 
an officer who will not be afraid to speak ? And though such 
a messenger does not open his lips except to Lincoln and 
Stanton, the public will soon know that there is something con- 
cealed. It should be done by all means. 

" To-day we must get ourselves enough out to save being 



484 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY, 

shut in. There is no use in entrenching a line of no real utility, 
and what Duane can do to-day will only wear out his men for 
nothing. 

" It is troops alone that can help us to-day. By to-morrow 
we will be able to know where to entrench. 

" We must have fresh troops immediately in large numbers, 
and I would, if necessary, abandon Norfolk and New Berne to get 
them, and all the useless coast of South Carolina and Georgia, 
holding only Fort Pulaski. 

" Pensacola is of no use, but I suppose may be held with few 
troops. 

" Yours, etc., 

" J. G. BARNARD." 

On the 3d of July the following was received from the Presi- 
dent : 

". . . Yours of 5.30 yesterday is just received. I am satisfied 
that yourself, officers, and men have done the best you could. 
All accounts say better fighting was never done. Ten thousand 
thanks for it. . . ." 

On the 4th I sent the following to the President : 

July 4, 1862. 

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch 
of the 2d instant. 

I shall make a stand at this place, and endeavor to give my 
men the repose they so much require. 

After sending my communication on Tuesday the enemy 
attacked the left of our lines, and a fierce battle ensued, lasting 
until night ; they were repulsed with great slaughter. Had their 
attack succeeded, the consequences would have been disastrous 
in the extreme. This closed the hard fighting which had con- 
tinued from the afternoon of the 26th ultimo, in a daily series of 
engagements wholly unparalleled on this continent for determi- 
nation and slaughter on both sides. 

The mutual loss in killed and wounded is enormous ; that 
of the enemy certainly greatest. * On Tuesday morning, the ist, 
our army commenced its movement from Haxall's to this point, 
our line of defence there being too extended to be maintained by 
our weakened forces. Our train was immense, and about four 
P.M. on the 2d a heavy storm of rain began, which continued 
during the entire day and until the forenoon of yesterday. 

The roads became horrible. Troops, artillery, and wagons 
moved on steadily, and our whole army, men and material was 
finally brought safe into this camp. 



POSITION OF THE ARMY. 485 

The last of the wagons reached here at noon yesterday. The 
exhaustion was very great, but the army preserved its morale, 
and would have repelled any attack which the enemy was in 
condition to make. 

We now occupy a line of heights about two miles from the 
James, a plain extending from there to the river ; our front is 
about three miles long. These heights command our whole posi- 
tion, and must be maintained. The gunboats can render valu- 
able support upon both flanks. If the enemy attack us in front 
we must hold our ground as we best may and at whatever cost. 

Our positions can be carried only by overwhelming numbers. 
The spirit of the army is excellent ; stragglers are finding their 
regiments, and the soldiers exhibit the best results of discipline. 
Our position is by no means impregnable, especially as a morass 
extends on this side of the high ground from our centre to the 
James on our right. The enemy may attack in vast numbers, 
and if so our front will be the scene of a desperate battle, which, 
if lost, will be decisive. Our army is fearfully weakened by 
killed, wounded, and prisoners. 

I cannot now approximate to any statement of our losses, but 
we were not beaten in any conflict. 

The enemy were unable, by their utmost efforts, to drive us 
from any field. Never did such a change of base, involving 
a retrograde movement, and under incessant attacks from a most 
determined and vastly more numerous foe, partake so little of 
disorder. We have lost no guns except 25 on the field of battle, 
21 of which were lost by the giving way of McCall's division 
under the onset of superior numbers. 

Our communications by the James river are not secure. 
There are points where the enemy can establish themselves with 
cannon or musketry and command the river, and where it is not 
certain that our gunboats can drive them out. In case of this, or 
in case our front is broken, I will still make every effort to pre- 
serve at least the personnel of the army ; and the events of the 
last few days leave no question that the troops will do all that 
their country can ask. Send such reinforcements as you can ; 
I will do what I can. We are shipping our wounded and sick, 
and landing supplies. The Navy Department should co-operate 
with us to the extent of its resources. Com. Rodgers is doing 
all in his power in the kindesj; and most efficient manner. 

When all the circumstances of the case are known it will be 
acknowledged by all competent judges that the movement just 
completed by this army is unparalleled in the annals of war. 
Under the most difficult circumstances we have preserved our 
trains, our guns, our material, and, above all, our honor. 

To which I received the following reply from the Presi- 
dent : 



486 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

" A thousand thanks for the relief your two despatches of 
twelve and one P.M. yesterday gave me. Be assured the heroism 
and skill of yourself, officers, and men is and for ever will be 
appreciated. 

" If you can hold your present position we shall hive the 
enemy yet." 

The following letter was received from his Excellency the 
President : 

"J u ty 4- I understand your position, as stated in your let- 
ter, and by Gen. Marcy. To reinforce you so as to enable you 
to resume the offensive within a month, or even six weeks, is 
impossible. In addition to that arrived and now arriving from 
the Potomac (about 10,000, I suppose), and about 10,000 I hope 
you will have from Burnside very soon, and about 5,000 from 
Hunter a little later, I do not see how I can send you another 
man within a month. Under these circumstances the defensive, 
for the present, must be your only care. Save the army first, 
where you are if you can, and, secondly, by removal if you 
must. You, on the ground, must be the judge as to which you 
will attempt, and of the means for effecting it. I but give it as 
my opinion that, with the aid of the gunboats and the reinforce- 
ments mentioned above, you can hold your present position, 
provided, and so long as, you can keep the James river open 
below you. If you are not tolerably confident you can keep the 
James river open, you had better remove as soon as possible. I 
do not remember that you have expressed any apprehension as 
to the danger of having your communication cut on the river 
below you, yet I do not suppose it can have escaped your atten- 
tion. 

" P.S. If at any time you feel able to take the offensive, you 
are not restrained from doing so." 

The following telegram was sent on the yth to the President : 

As boat is starting, I have only time to acknowledge receipt 
of despatch by Gen. Marcy. Enemy have not attacked. My 
position is very strong, and daily becoming more so. If not 
attacked to-day I shall laugh at them. I have been anxious 
about my communications. Had long consultation about it with 
Flag-Officer Goldsborough last night ; he is confident he can 
keep river open. He should have all gunboats possible. Will 
see him again this morning. My men in splendid spirits, and 
anxious to try it again. 

Alarm yourself as little as possible about me, and don't lose 
confidence in this army. 



THE PIARRISON'S BAR LETTER. 487 

While general-in-chief, and directing the operations of all 
our armies in the field, I had become deeply impressed with the 
importance of adopting and carrying out certain views regarding 
the conduct of the war which, in my judgment, were essential to 
its objects and its success. 

During an active campaign of three months in the enemy's 
country these were so fully confirmed that I conceived it a duty, 
in the critical position we then occupied, not to withhold a can- 
did expression of the more important of these views from the 
commander-in-chief, whom the Constitution places at the head 
of the armies and navies, as well as of the government, of the 
nation. 

Mr. Lincoln visited me at Harrison's Bar. I handed him 
myself, on board of the steamer in which he came, the letter of 
July 7, 1862. He read it in my presence, but made no com- 
ments upon it, merely saying, when he had finished it, that he 
was obliged to me for it, or words to that effect. I do not 
think that he alluded further to it during his visit, or at any 
time after that. 



THE HARRISON'S BAR LETTER. 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
CAMP NEAR HARRISON'S LANDING, VA., July 7, 1862. 

MR. PRESIDENT: You have been fully informed that the rebel 
army is in the front, with the purpose of overwhelming us by 
attacking our positions or reducing us by blocking our river 
communications. I cannot but regard our condition as critical, 
and I earnestly desire, in view of possible contingencies, to lay 
before your excellency, for your private consideration, my gene- 
ral views concerning the existing state of the rebellion, although 
they do not strictly relate to the situation of this army or strictly 
come within the scope of my official duties. These views amount 
to convictions, and are deeply impressed upon my mind and 
heart. Our cause must never be abandoned ; it is the cause of 
free institutions and self-government. The Constitution and the 
Union must be preserved, whatever may be the cost in time, 
treasure, and blood. If secession is successful other dissolutions 
are clearly to be seen in the future. Let neither military disas- 
ter, political faction, nor foreign war shake your settled purpose 
to enforce the equal operation of the laws of the United States 
upon the people of every State. 

The time has come when the government must determine 



488 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

upon a civil and military policy covering the whole ground of 
our national trouble. 

The responsibility of determining, declaring, and supporting 
such civil and military policy, and of directing the whole course 
of national affairs in regard to the rebellion, must now be assumed 
and exercised by you, or our cause will be lost. The Constitution 
gives you power sufficient even for the present terrible exigency. 

This rebellion has assumed the character of war ; as such it 
should be regarded, and it should be conducted upon the high- 
est principles known to Christian civilization. It should not be a 
war looking to the subjugation of the people of any State in any 
event. It should not be at all a war upon population, but against 
armed forces and political organizations. Neither confiscation of 
property, political executions of persons, territorial organization 
of States, or forcible abolition of slavery should be contemplated 
for a moment. In prosecuting the war all private property and 
unarmed persons should be strictly protected, subject only to the 
necessity of military operations. All private property taken for 
military use should be paid or receipted for ; pillage and waste 
should be treated as high crimes ; all unnecessary trespass stern- 
ly prohibited, and offensive demeanor by the military towards 
citizens promptly rebuked. Military arrests should not be tole- 
rated, except in places where active hostilities exist, and oaths 
not required by enactments constitutionally made should be nei- 
ther demanded nor received. Military government should be 
confined to the preservation of public order and the protection 
of political rights. Military power should not be allowed to 
interfere with the relations of servitude, either by supporting or 
impairing the authority of the master, except for repressing dis- 
order, as in other cases. Slaves contraband under the act of 
Congress, seeking military protection, should receive it. The 
right of the government to appropriate permanently to its own 
service claims to slave labor should be asserted, and the right 
of the owner to compensation therefor should be recognized. 

This principle might be extended, upon grounds of military 
necessity and security, to all the slaves within a particular State, 
thus working manumission in such State ; and in Missouri, per- 
haps in Western Virginia also, and possibly even in Maryland, the 
expediency of such a measure is only a question of time. 

A system of policy thus constitutional and conservative, and 
pervaded by the influences of Christianity and freedom, would 
receive the support of almost all truly loyal men, would deeply 
impress the rebel masses and all foreign nations, and it might be 
humbly hoped that it would commend itself to the favor of the 
Almighty. 

Unless the principles governing the future conduct of our 
struggle shall be made known and approved, the effort to obtain 
requisite forces will be almost hopeless. A declaration of radical 



THE HARRISON'S BAR LETTER. 489 

views, especially upon slavery, will rapidly disintegrate our pre- 
sent armies. The policy of the government must be supported 
by concentrations of military power. The national forces should 
not be dispersed in expeditions, posts of occupation, and nume- 
rous armies, but should be mainly collected into masses and 
brought to bear upon the armies of the Confederate States. 
Those armies thoroughly defeated, the political structure which 
they support would soon cease to exist. 

In carrying out any system of policy which you may form you 
will require a commander-in-chief of the army, one who possesses 
your confidence, understands your views, and who is competent 
to execute your orders by directing the military forces of the 
nation to the accomplishment of the objects by you proposed. 
I do not ask that place for myself. I am willing to serve you 
in such position as you may assign me, and I will do so as faith- 
fully as ever subordinate served superior. 

I may be on the brink of eternity ; and as I hope forgiveness 
from my Maker, I have written this letter with sincerity towards 
you and from love for my country.* 

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

His Excellency A. LINCOLN, 

President. 



* Note by the Editor. It has been frequently intimated that this letter 
was written, in consultation with friends at the North, as a political docu- 
ment. It was the misfortune of McClellan that civilians at Washington, 
judging him in their own lights, could not conceive it possible that he or 
any man could render honest, unselfish service to country and cause without 
some concealed purpose of benefit to himself. Pure devotion to duty, with- 
out thought of self, is incomprehensible to the average politician. I think 
it proper to say, therefore, that no one of McClellan's most intimate personal 
friends at the North knew even of the existence of this letter until rumors 
about it came from members of Mr. Lincoln's cabinet. None of them saw 
it until after the general was finally relieved from command. Meantime it 
had been discussed thoroughly by those to whom the President showed it , 
and it cannot be doubted that a general inability to appreciate the sincere 
motives in which it was written did much to determine the future conduct 
of the administration towards McClellan. Mr. Chase, with startling inno- 
cence of mind, avows (Warden, p. 440) that on July 22 he urged Mr. Lin- 
coln to remove McClellan, on the ground "that I did not regard Gen. 
McClellan as loyal to the administrat'on, although I did not question his 
general loyalty to the country" This is the confession of a motive in the 
conduct of a great war which is universally regarded as infamous. It is 
an avowal that the controlling consideration of such leaders as Mr. Chase, 
in the use of the blood and treasure of the people, was the supremacy of 



4QO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

I telegraphed the President on the nth: "We are very strong 
here now, so far as defensive is concerned. Hope you will soon 
make us strong enough to advance and try it again. All in fine 
spirits." 

Telegrams were sent to the President on the i2th, lyth, and 
1 8th: 

\2th. I am more and more convinced that this army ought 
not to be withdrawn from here, but promptly reinforced and 
thrown again upon Richmond. If we have a little more than 
half a chance we can take it. I dread the effects of any retreat 
upon the morale of the men. 

17^. I have consulted fully with Gen. Burnside, and would 
commend to your favorable consideration the general's plan for 
bringing (7) seven additional regiments from North Carolina, by 
leaving New Berne to the care of the gunboats. It appears mani- 
festly to be our policy to concentrate here everything we can pos- 
sibly spare from less important points, to make sure of crushing 
the enemy at Richmond, which seems clearly to be the most 
important point in rebeldom. Nothing should be left to chance 
here. I would recommend that Gen. Burnside, with all his 
troops, be ordered to this army, to enable it to assume the offen- 
sive as soon as possible. 



z. Am anxious to have determination of government, 
that no time may be lost in preparing for it. Hours are very 
precious now, and perfect unity of action necessary. 

The following was telegraphed to Gen. Halleck on the 28th : 

My opinion is more and more firm that here is the defence of 
Washington, and that I should be at once reinforced by all avail- 
able troops to enable me to advance. Retreat would be disas- 
trous to the army and the cause. I am confident of that. 

On the 3oth to Gen. Halleck : 

I hope that it may soon be decided what is to be done by this 
army, and that the decision may be to reinforce it at once. We 
are losing much valuable time, and that at a moment when energy 
and decision are sadly needed. 

party, and not tne success of country. Neither the President nor Gen. 
McClellan had any such impure ideas. And it is beyond doubt that the 
radical difference between his own views and those of the self-seeking men 
who surrounded him led Mr. Lincoln to the despairing state of mind in 
which, a few weeks later, he desired to resign. 



HALLECK'S ORDERS. 491 

About half an hour after midnight on the morning of Aug. i 
the enemy brought some light batteries to Coggins's Point and the 
Coles House, on the right bank of James river directly opposite 
Harrison's Landing, and opened a heavy fire upon our shipping 
and encampments. It was continued rapidly for about thirty 
minutes, when they were driven back by the fire of our guns. 

To prevent another demonstration of this character, and to 
insure a debouch on the south bank of the James, it became 
necessary to occupy Coggins's Point, which was done on the 3d, 
and the enemy driven back towards Petersburg. 

On the ist of Aug. I received the following despatches from 
Gen. Halleck : 

"Washington, July 30, 1862, 8 P.M. A despatch just received 
from Gen. Pope says that deserters report that the enemy is 
moving south of James river, and that the force in Richmond is 
very small. I suggest that he be pressed in that direction, so as 
to ascertain the facts of the case." 

" Washington, July 30, 1862, 8 P.M. In order to enable you 
to move in any direction it is necessary to relieve you of your 
sick. The surgeon-general has therefore been directed to make 
arrangements for them at other places, and the quartermaster- 
general to provide transportation. I hope you will send them 
away as quickly as possible, and advise me of their removal." 

It is clear that the general-in-chief attached some weight to 
the report received from Gen. Pope, and I was justified in sup- 
posing that the order in regard to removing the sick contemplat- 
ed an offensive movement rather than a retreat, as I had no other 
data than the telegrams just given from which to form an opinion 
as to the intentions of the government. The following telegram 
from him strengthened me in that belief : 

" Washington, July 31, 1862, 10 A.M. Gen. Pope again tele- 
graphs that the enemy is reported to be evacuating Richmond, 
and falling back on Danville and Lynchburg. 

" H. W. HALLECK, 

"Maj.-Gen." 

In occupying Coggins's Point I was influenced by the neces- 
sity of possessing a secure debouch on the south of the James, 
in order to enable me to move on the communications of Rich- 

37 



492 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

mond in that direction, as well as to prevent a repetition of mid- 
night cannonades. 

To carry out Gen. Halleck's first order, of July 30, it was 
necessary first to gain possession of Malvern Hill, which was 
occupied by the enemy, apparently in some little force, and con- 
trolled the direct approach to Richmond. Its temporary occupa- 
tion at least was equally necessary in the event of a movement 
upon Petersburg, or even the abandonment of the Peninsula. 
Gen. Hooker, with his own division and Pleasonton's cavalry, 
was therefore directed to gain possession of Malvern Hill on the 
night of the 2d of Aug. 

He failed to do so on account of the incompetency of guides. 

On the 4th Gen. Hooker was reinforced by Gen. Sedgwick's 
division, and, having obtained a knowledge of the roads, he suc- 
ceeded in turning Malvern Hill and driving the enemy back 
towards Richmond. 

The following is my report of this affair at the time : 

'Malvern Hill, Aug. 5, 1862, i P.M. Gen. Hooker at 5.30 
this morning attacked a very considerable force of infantry and 
artillery stationed at this place, and carried it handsomely, driv- 
ing the enemy towards New Market, which is four miles distant, 
and where it is said they have a large force. We have captured 
100 prisoners, killed and wounded several, with a loss on our part 
of only three killed and eleven wounded ; among the latter two 
ofncers. 

I shall probably remain here to-night, ready to act as circum- 
stances may require after the return of my cavalry reconnois- 
sances. 

The mass of the enemy escaped under the cover of a dense 
fog ; but our cavalry are still in pursuit, and I trust may succeed 
in capturing many more. 

This is a very advantageous position to cover an advance on 
Richmond, and only fourteen and three-quarter miles distant ; 
and I feel confident that, with reinforcements, I would march 
this army there in five days. 

I this instant learn that several brigades of the enemy are 
four miles from here on the Quaker road, and I have taken steps 
to prepare to meet them. 

Gen. Hooker's dispositions were admirable, and his officers 
and men displayed their usual gallantry. 

On the same day I telegraphed to Gen. Halleck : 

Our troops have advanced twelve miles in one direction 



HALLECK'S ORDERS. 



493 



and seventeen in another towards Richmond to-day. We have 
secured a strong position at Coggins's Point, opposite our quar- 
termaster's depot, which will effectually prevent the rebels from 
using artillery hereafter against our camps. 

I learn this evening that there is a force of 20,000 men about 
six miles back from this point, on the south bank of the river ; 
what their object is I do not know, but will keep a sharp lookout 
on their movements. 

I am sending off sick as rapidly as our transports will take 
them. I am also doing everything in my power to carry out 
your orders to push reconnoissances towards the rebel capital, 
and hope soon to find out whether the reports regarding the 
abandonment of that place are true. 

To the despatch of one P.M., Aug. 5, the following answer 
was received Aug. 6 : 

" I have no reinforcements to send you. 

"H. W. HALLECK, 

"Maj.-Gen." 

And soon after the following, also from Gen. Halleck : 

" You will immediately send a regiment of cavalry and seve- 
ral batteries of artillery to Burnside's command at Acquia creek. 
It is reported that Jackson is moving north with a very large 
force." 

On the 4th I had received Gen. Halleck's order of the 3d 
(which appears below), directing me to withdraw the army to 
Acquia, and on the same day sent an earnest protest against it. 

A few hours before this Gen. Hooker had informed me that 
his cavalry pickets reported large bodies of the enemy advanc- 
ing and driving them in, and that he would probably be attacked 
at daybreak. Under these circumstances I had determined to 
support him ; but as I could not get the whole army in position 
until the next afternoon, I concluded, upon the receipt of the 
above telegram from the general-in-chief, to withdraw Gen. 
Hooker, that there might be the least possible delay in con- 
forming to Gen. Halleck's orders. I therefore sent to Gen. 
Hooker : 

. . . Under advices I have received from Washington, I 
think it necessary for you to abandon the position to-night, get- 
ting everything away before daylight. 



494 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Five batteries, with their horses and equipments complete, 
were embarked on the yth and 8th. Simultaneously with Gen. 
Hooker's operations upon Malvern I despatched a cavalry force 
under Col. Averill towards Savage's Station to ascertain if the 
enemy were making any movements towards our left flank. He 
found a rebel cavalry regiment near the White Oak Swamp 
bridge, and completely routed it, pursuing well towards Sav- 
age's Station. 

These important preliminary operations assisted my prepara- 
tions for the removal of the army to Acquia creek, and the 
sending off our sick and supplies was pushed both day and night 
as rapidly as the means of transportation permitted. 

On the subject of the withdrawal of the army from Harri- 
son's Landing the following correspondence passed between 
the general-in-chief and myself while the reconnoissances to- 
wards Richmond were in progress. 

On the 2d of Aug. I received the following from Gen. Hal- 
leek : 

" You have not answered my telegram [of July 30, 8 P.M.] 
about the removal of your sick. Remove them as rapidly as 
possible, and telegraph me when they will be out of your way. 
The President wishes an answer as early as possible." 

To which I sent this reply : 

3</, ii P.M. Your telegram of (2d) second is received. The 
answer [to despatch of July 30] was sent this morning. We 
have about 12,500 sick, of whom perhaps 4,000 might make 
easy marches. We have here the means to transport 1,200, and 
will embark to-morrow that number of the worst cases. With 
all the means at the disposal of the medical director the re- 
mainder could be shipped in from seven to ten days. It is 
impossible for me to decide what cases to send off, unless I 
know what is to be done with this army. 

Were the disastrous measures of a retreat adopted all the 
sick who cannot march and fight should be despatched by water. 
Should the army advance many of the sick could be of service 
at the depots. If it is to remain here any length of time, the 
question assumes still a different phase. 

Until I am informed what is to be done I cannot act under- 
standingly or for the good of the service. If I am kept longer 
in ignorance of what is to be effected I cannot be expected to 
accomplish the object in view. In the meantime I will do all 
in my power to carry out what I conceive to be your wishes. 



THE ARMY RECALLED. 



495 



The moment I received the instructions for removing the sick 
I at once gave the necessary directions for carrying them out. 

With the small amount of transportation at hand the removal 
of the severe cases alone would necessarily take several days, 
and, in the meantime, I desired information to determine what I 
should do with the others. 

The order required me to send them away as quickly as pos- 
sible, and to notify the general-in-chief when they were removed. 

Previous to the receipt of the despatch of the 2d of Aug., not 
having been advised of what the army under my command was 
expected to do, or which way it was to move, if it moved at all, 
I sent the following despatch to Gen. Halleck : 

Berkley, Aug. 3. I hear of sea-steamers at Fort Monroe ; 
are they for removing my sick ? If so, to what extent am I 
required to go in sending them off ? There are not many who 
need go. 

As I am not in any way informed of the intentions of the 
government in regard to this army, I am unable to judge what 
proportion of the sick should leave here, and must ask for specific 
orders. 

If the army was to retreat to Fort Monroe it was important 
that it should be unencumbered with any sick, wounded, or other 
men who might at all interfere with its mobility ; but if the object 
was to operate directly on Richmond from the position we then 
occupied, there were many cases of slight sickness which would 
speedily be cured and the patients returned to duty. 

As the service of every man would be important in the event 
of a forward offensive movement, I considered it to be of the 
utmost consequence that I should know what was to be done. 
It was to ascertain this that I sent the despatch of eleven P.M. on 
the 3d, before receiving the following telegram from Gen. Hal- 
leck : 

" Washington, Aug. 3, 1862, 7.45 P.M. I have waited most 
anxiously to learn the result of your forced reconnoissance 
towards Richmond, and also whether all your sick have been 
sent away, and I can get no answer to my telegram. 

" It is determined to withdraw your army from the Peninsula 
to Acquia creek. You will take immediate measures to effect 
this, covering the movement the best you can. 



496 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

" Its . real object and withdrawal should be concealed even 
from your own officers. 

"Your material and transportation should be removed first. 
You will assume control of all the means of transportation within 
your reach, and apply to the naval forces for all the assistance 
they can render you. You will consult freely with the com- 
mander of Ihese forces. The entire execution of the movement 
is left to your discretion and judgment. 

" You will leave such forces as you may deem proper at Fcrt 
Monroe, Norfolk, and other places, which we must occupy." 

I proceeded to obey this order with all possible rapidity, 
firmly impressed, however, with the conviction that the with- 
drawal of the Army of the Potomac from Harrison's Landing, 
where its communications had, by the co-operation of the gun- 
boats, been rendered perfectly secure, would at that time have 
the most disastrous effect upon our cause. 

I did not, as the commander of that army, allow the occasion 
to pass without distinctly setting forth my views upon the sub- 
ject to the authorities in the following telegram : 

Aug. 4. Your telegram of last evening is received. I must 
confess that it has caused me the greatest pain I ever experi- 
enced, for I am convinced that the order to withdraw this 
army to Acquia creek will prove disastrous to our cause. 

I fear it will be a fatal blow. 

Several days are necessary to complete the preparations for 
so important a movement as this ; and while they are in progress 
I beg that careful consideration may be given to my statements. 

This army is now in excellent discipline and condition. We 
hold a debouch on both banks of the James river, so that we are 
free to act in any direction, and, with the assistance of the gun- 
boats, I consider our communications as now secure. We are 
twenty-five miles from Richmond, and are not likely to meet the 
enemy in force sufficient to fight a battle until we have marched 
fifteen to eighteen miles, which brings us practically within ten 
miles of Richmond. Our longest line of land-transportation 
would be from this point twenty-five miles ; but with the aid of 
the gunboats we can supply the army by water, during its ad- 
vance, certainly to within twelve miles of Richmond. 

At Acquia creek we would be seventy-five miles from Rich- 
mond, with land-transportation all the way. 



ON THE BANKS OF THE JAMES. 497 

From here to Fort Monroe is a march of about seventy miles; 
for I regard it as impracticable to withdraw this army and its 
material except by land. 

The result of the movement would thus be a march of one 
hundred and forty-five miles to reach a point now only twenty- 
five miles distant, and to deprive ourselves entirely of the power- 
ful aid of the gunboats and water-transportation. Add to this 
the certain demoralization of this army which would ensue, the 
terribly depressing effect upon the people of the North, and the 
strong probability that it would influence foreign powers to 
recognize our adversaries, and there appear to me sufficient rea- 
sons to make it my imperative duty to urge, in the strongest 
terms afforded by our language, that this order may be rescinded, 
and that, far from recalling this army, it be promptly reinforced 
to enable it to resume the offensive. 

It may be said that there are no reinforcements available. I 
point to Burnside's force, to that of Pope not necessary to main- 
tain a strict defensive in front of Washington and Harper's Ferry 
to those portions of the Army of the West not required for a 
strict defensive there. Here, directly in front of this army, is the 
heart of the rebellion ; it is here that all our resources should be 
collected to strike the blow which will determine the fate of the 
nation. All points of secondary importance elsewhere should be 
abandoned and every available man brought here ; a decid- 
ed victory here, and the military strength of the rebellion is 
crushed, it matters not what partial reverses we may meet with 
elsewhere. 

Here is the true defence of Washington ; it is here, on the 
banks of the James, that the fate of the Union should be de- 
cided. 

Clear in my convictions of right, strong in the consciousness 
that I have ever been, and still am, actuated solely by love of 
my country, knowing that no ambitious or selfish motives have 
influenced me from the commencement of this war, I do now 
what I never did in my life before I entreat that this order may 
be rescinded. 

If my counsel does not prevail I will, with a sad heart, obey 
your orders to the utmost of my power, directing to the move- 
ment, which I clearly foresee will be one of the utmost delicacy 
and difficulty, whatever skill I may possess. 



498 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Whatever the result may be and may God grant that I am 
mistaken in my forebodings I shall at least have the internal 
satisfaction that I have written and spoken frankly, and have 
sought to do the best in my power to avert disaster from my 
country. 

G. B. McCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 
Maj.-Gen. H. W. HALLECK, 

Commanding U. S. Army. 

Soon after sending this telegram I received the following from 
Gen. Halleck in reply to mine of eleven P.M. of the 3d : 

" My telegram to you of yesterday will satisfy you in regard 
to future operations ; it was expected that you would have sent 
off your sick, as directed, without waiting to know what were 
or would be the intentions of the government respecting future 
movements. 

" The President expects that the instructions which were sent 
you yesterday, with his approval, will be carried out with all pos- 
sible despatch and caution. The quartermaster-general is send- 
ing to Fort Monroe all the transportation he can collect." 

To which the following is 'my reply : 

Your telegram of yesterday received, and is being carried out 
as promptly as possible. With the means at my command no 
human power could have moved the sick in the time you say 
you expected them to be moved. . . . 

My efforts for bringing about a change of policy were unsuc- 
cessful. On the yth I received the following telegram from Gen. 
Halleck : 

" You will immediately report the number of sick sent off 
since you received my order ; the number still to be shipped, and 
the amount of transportation at your disposal ; that is, the num- 
ber of persons that can be carried on all the vessels which by my 
order you were authorized to control." 

To which I made this reply: 

Aug. 7. In reply to your despatch of 10 A.M. to-day I report 
the number of sick sent off since I received your order as fol- 
lows : 3,740, including some that are embarked to-night and will 



TRANSPORTS WANTED. 499 

leave to-morrow morning. The number still to be shipped is, as 
nearly as can be ascertained, 5,700. 

The embarkation of five batteries of artillery, with their 
horses, wagons, etc., required most of our available boats, 
except the ferry-boats. All the transports that can ascend to 
this place have been ordered up : they will be here to-morrow 
evening. Col. Ingalls reports to me that there are no transports 
now available for cavalry, and will not be for two or three days. 
As soon as they can be obtained I shall send off the ist N. Y. 
Cavalry. 

After the transports with sick and wounded have returned, 
including some heavy-draught steamers at Fort Monroe that 
cannot come to this point, we can transport 25,000 men at a 
time. We have some propellers here, but they are laden with 
commissary supplies and are not available. 

The transports now employed in transporting sick and wound- 
ed will carry 12,000 well infantry soldiers. Those at Fort Mon- 
roe, and of too heavy draught to come here, will carry 8,000 or 
10,000 infantry. Several of the largest steamers have been used 
for transporting prisoners of war, and have only become available 
for the sick to-day. 

The report of my chief -quartermaster upon the subject is as 
follows : 



" HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
"OFFICE OF CHIEF-QUARTERMASTER, 

"HARRISON'S LANDING, August 7, 1862. 

" GENERAL : I have the honor to return the papers herewith 
which you sent me, with the following remarks : 

" We are embarking five batteries of artillery, with their 
horses, baggage, etc., which requires the detailing of most of our 
available boats, except the ferry-boats. The medical department 
has ten or twelve of our largest transport vessels, which, if dis- 
posable, could carry 12,000 men. Besides, there are some heavy- 
draught steamers at Fort Monroe that cannot come to this point, 
but which can carry 8,000 or 10,000 infantry. 

" I have ordered all up here that can ascend to this depot. 
They will be here to-morrow evening. As it now is, after the 
details already made we cannot transport from this place more 
than 5,000 infantry. 

" There are no transports now available for cavalry. From 
and after to-morrow, if the vessels arrive, I could transport 
10,000 infantry. In two or three days a regiment of cavalry can 
be sent, if required. If you wait, and ship from Yorktown or 
Fort Monroe after the sick and wounded transports are at 
my disposal, we can transport 25,000 at a time. The number 



500 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

that can be transported is contingent on circumstances referred 
to. 

" Most of the propellers here are laden with commissary or 
other supplies, and most of the tugs are necessary to tow off sail- 
craft also laden with supplies. 

" I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant, 

"RUFUS INGALLS, 

" Chief -Quartermaster. 
" Gen. R. B. MARCY, 

" Chief of Staff r 

On the Qth I received this despatch from Gen. Halleck : 

" I am of the opinion that the enemy is massing his forces in 
front of Gens. Pope and Burnside, and that he expects to crush 
them and move forward to the Potomac. 

" You must send reinforcements instantly to Acquia creek. 

" Considering the amount of transportation at your disposal, 
your delay is not satisfactory. You must move with all possible 
celerity." 

To which I sent the following reply: 

Telegram of yesterday received. The batteries sent to Burn- 
side took the last available transport yesterday morning. Enough 
have since arrived to ship one regiment of cavalry to-day. The 
sick are being embarked as rapidly as possible. There has been 
no unnecessary delay, as you assert not an hour's but every- 
thing has been and is being pushed as rapidly as possible to carry 
out your orders. 

The following report, made on the same day by the officer 
then in charge of the transports, exposes the injustice of the 
remark in the despatch of the general-in-chief, that, " considering 
the amount of transportation at your disposal, your delay is not 
satisfactory ": 

"ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE, 

"ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

"HARRISON'S LANDING, VIRGINIA, Aug. 10, 1862. 
" Col. Ingalls, being himself ill, has requested me to telegraph 
to you concerning the state and capacity of the transports now 
here. On the night of the 8th I despatched eleven steamers, 
principally small ones, and six schooners, with five batteries of 
heavy horse-artillery, none of which have yet returned. 

" Requisition is made this morning for transportation of 1,000 
cavalry to Acquia creek. All the schooners that had been char- 



HALLECK'S INJUSTICE. 501 

tered for carrying horses have been long since discharged or 
changed into freight-vessels. 

" A large proportion of the steamers now here are still loaded 
with stores, or are in the floating hospital service engaged in 
removing the sick. To transport the 1,000 cavalry to-day will 
take all the available steamers now here not engaged in the ser- 
vice of the harbor. These steamers could take a large number 
of infantry, but are not well adapted to the carrying of horses, 
and much space is thus lost. Several steamers are expected 
here to-day, and we are unloading schooners rapidly ; most of 
these are not chartered, but are being taken for the service 
required, at same rates of pay as other chartered schooners. If 
you could cause a more speedy return of the steamers sent away 
from here it would facilitate matters. 

" C. G. SAWTELLE, 
" Capt. and Assist. Quartermaster, commanding Depot." 

Our wharf facilities at Harrison's Landing were very limited, 
admitting but few vessels at one time. These were continually 
in use as long as there were disposable vessels, and the officers of 
the medical and quartermaster's departments, with all their avail- 
able forces, were incessantly occupied, day and night, in embark- 
ing and sending off the sick men, troops, and material. 

Notwithstanding the repeated representations I made to the 
general-in-chief that such were the facts, on the loth I received 
the following from Gen. Halleck : 

" The enemy is crossing the Rapidan in large force. They 
are fighting Gen. Pope to-day ; there must be no further delay 
in your movements. That which has already occurred was 
entirely unexpected and must be satisfactorily explained. Let 
not a moment's time be lost, and telegraph me daily what pro- 
gress you have made in executing the order to transfer your 
troops." 

To which I sent this reply : 

Your despatch of to-day is received. I assure you again that 
there has not been any unnecessary delay in carrying out your 
orders. You are probably laboring under some great mistake as 
to the amount of transportation available here. I have pushed 
matters to the utmost in getting off our sick and the troops you 
ordered to Burnside. 

Col. Ingalls has more than once informed the quartermaster- 
general of the condition of our water-transportation. From the 



5<D2 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

fact that you directed me to keep the order secret I took it for 
granted that you would take the steps necessary to provide the 
requisite transportation. A large number of transports for all 
arms of service and for wagons should at once be sent to 
Yorktown and Fort Monroe. I shall be ready to move the 
whole army by land the moment the sick are disposed of. 
You may be sure that not an hour's delay will occur that can 
be avoided. I fear you do not realize the difficulty of the 
operation proposed. The regiment of cavalry for Burnside has 
been in course of embarkation to-day and to-night. Ten steam- 
ers were required for the purpose. 1,258 sick loaded to-day and 
to-night. Our means exhausted, except one vessel returning to 
Fort Monroe in the morning, which will take some 500 cases of 
slight sickness. 

The present moment is probably not the proper one for me 
to refer to the unnecessarily harsh and unjust tone of your tele- 
grams of late. It will, however, make no difference in my official 
action. 

On the nth this report was made : 

The embarkation of 850 cavalry and one brigade of infantry 
will be completed by two o'clock in the morning ; 500 sick were 
embarked to-day ; another vessel arrived to-night, and 600 more 
sick are now being embarked. I still have some 4,000 sick to 
dispose of. You have been grossly misled as to the amount of 
transportation at my disposal. Vessels loaded to their utmost 
capacity with stores, and others indispensable for service here, 
have been reported to you as available for carrying sick and well. 
I am sending off all that can be unloaded at Fort Monroe, to have 
them return here. I repeat that I have lost no time in carrying 
out your orders. 

On the 1 2th I received the following from Gen. Halleck : 

" The quartermaster-general informs me that nearly every 
available steam-vessel in the country is now under your control. 
... It was supposed that 8,000 or 10,000 of your men could be 
transported daily. In addition to steamers there is a large fleet 
of sailing-vessels which could be used as transports. The bulk 
of your material on shore, it was thought, could be sent to Fort 
Monroe covered by that part of the army which could not get 
water-transportation. Such were the views of the government 
here. Perhaps we were misinformed as to the facts; if so, the 
delay could be explained. Nothing in my telegram was inten- 
tionally harsh or unjust ; but the delay was so unexpected that 
an explanation was required. There has been and is the most 



A TELEGRAPHIC INTERVIEW. 503 

urgent necessity for despatch, and not a single moment must be 
lost in getting additional troops in front of Washington." 

I telegraphed the following reply at eleven P.M.: 

Your despatch of noon to-day received. It is positively the 
fact that no more men could have embarked hence than have 
gone, and that no unnecessary delay has occurred. . . . 

I am sure that you have been misinformed as to the avail- 
ability of vessels on hand. We cannot use heavily loaded supply- 
vessels for troops or animals ; and such constitute the mass of 
those here, which have been represented to you as capable of 
transporting this army. . . . 

There shall be no unnecessary delay, but I cannot manufac- 
ture vessels. I state these difficulties from experience, and be- 
cause it appears to me that we have been lately working at cross- 
purposes, because you have not been properly informed by those 
around you, who ought to know the inherent difficulties of such 
an undertaking. It is not possible for any one to place this army 
where you wish it, ready to move, in less than a month. 

If Washington is in danger now this army can scarcely arrive 
in time to save it ; it is in much better position to do so from 
here than from Acquia. 

" Our material can only be saved by using the whole army to 
cover it if we are pressed. If sensibly weakened by detachments 
the result might be the loss of much material and many men. I 
will be at the telegraph-office to-morrow morning. 

It will be seen by the concluding paragraph of the foregoing 
despatch that in order to have a more direct, speedy, and full 
explanation of the condition of affairs in the army than I could 
by sending a single despatch by steamer to the nearest tele- 
graph-office at Jamestown island, some seventy miles distant, 
and waiting ten hours for a reply, I proposed to go in person 
to the office. This I did. 

On my arrival at Jamestown island there was an interrup- 
tion in the electric current, which rendered it necessary for me 
to continue on to Fort Monroe, and across the Chesapeake bay 
to Cherry Stone inlet, on the " Eastern Shore," where I arrived 
late in the evening, and immediately sent the two annexed 
despatches : 



, 11.30 P.M. Please come to office ; wish to talk to you. 
What news from Pope ?

you ; found cable broken and came here. Please read my long 
telegram [of Aug. 1 2, 1 1 P.M.] All quiet at camp. Enemy burned 
wharves at City Point yesterday. No rebel pickets within eight 
(8) miles of Coggins's Point yesterday. 

Richmond prisoners state that large force with guns left 
Richmond northward on Sunday. 

To which the following reply was received : 

" 1.40 A.M. I have read your despatch. There is no change 
of plans. You will send up your troops as rapidly as possible. 
There is no difficulty in landing them. According to your own 
accounts there is now no difficulty in withdrawing your forces. 
Do so with all possible rapidity. 

"H. W. HALLECK, 

" Maj.-Gcn." 

Before I had time to decipher and reply to this despatch, the 
telegraph operator in Washington informed me that Gen. Hal- 
leek had gone out of the office immediately after writing this 
despatch, without leaving any intimation of the fact for me or 
waiting for any further information as to the object of my jour- 
ney across the bay. As there was no possibility of other com- 
munication with him at that time, I sent the following despatch 
and returned to Harrison's Landing : 

1.40 A.M. Your orders will be obeyed. I return at once. 
I had hoped to have had a longer and fuller conversation with 
you, after travelling so far for the purpose. 

On the 1 4th and i5th, and before we had been able to 
embark all our sick men, two army corps were put in motion 
towards Fort Monroe. This was reported in the annexed 
despatch : 

Aug. 1 6, n P.M. Movement has commenced by land and 
water. All sick will be away to-morrow night. Everything 
being done to carry out your orders. I don't like Jackson's 
movements ; he will suddenly appear where least expected. 
Will telegraph fully and understandingly in the morning. 

The phrase " movement has commenced," it need not be 
remarked, referred obviously to the movement of the main 
army after completing the necessary preliminary movements 
of the sick, etc. 



MOVEMENT TO FORTRESS MONROE. 505 

The perversion of the term to which the general-in-chief saw 
fit to give currency, in a letter to the Secretary of War, should 
have been here rendered impossible by the despatches which 
precede this of the i4th, which show that the movement really 
began immediately after the receipt of the order of Aug. 4.* 

After the commencement of the movement it was continued 
with the utmost rapidity until all the troops and material were 
en route, both by land and water, on the morning of the i6th. 

Late in the afternoon of that day, when the last man had dis- 
appeared from the deserted camps, I followed with my personal 
staff in the track of the grand Army of the Potomac, bidding 
farewell to the scene still covered with the marks of its presence, 
and to be for ever memorable in history as the vicinity of its 
most brilliant exploits. 

Previous to the departure of the troops I had directed Capt. 
Duane, of the engineer corps, to proceed to Barrett's Ferry, 
near the mouth of the Chickahominy, and throw across the 
river at that point a pontoon-bridge. This was executed 
promptly and satisfactorily, under the cover of gunboats, and 
an excellent bridge of about 2,000 feet in length was ready for 
the first arrival of troops. The greater part of the army, with 
its artillery, wagon-trains, etc., crossed it rapidly, and in perfect 
order and safety, so that on the night of the i;th everything 
was across the Chickahominy, except the rear-guard, which 
crossed early on the morning of the i8th, when the pontoon- 
bridge was immediately removed. 

Gen. Porter's corps, which was the first to march from Har- 
rison's Landing, had been pushed forward rapidly, and on the 
i6th reached Williamsburg, where I had directed him to halt 
until the entire army was across the Chickahominy. 

On his arrival at Williamsburg, however, he received an inter- 
cepted letter, which led to the belief that Gen. Pope would 
have to contend against a very heavy force then in his front. 
Gen. Porter, therefore, very properly took the responsibility of 
continuing his march directly on to Newport News, which place 
he reached on the morning of the i8th of August, having marched 

* In a letter to the Secretary of War, Aug. 30, 1862, Gen Halleck 
said : "It will be seen from my telegraphic correspondence that Gen. 
McClellan protested against the movement, and that it was not actually 
commenced till the I4th inst." 



506 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

his corps sixty miles in the short period of three days and one 
night, halting one day at the crossing of the Chickahominy. 

The embarkation of this corps commenced as soon as trans- 
ports were ready, and on the 2oth it had all sailed for Acquia 
creek from Barrett's Ferry. 

On the 1 8th and igth our march was continued to Williams- 
burg and Yorktown, and on the 2oth the remainder of the army 
was ready to embark at Yorktown, Fortress Monroe, and New- 
port News. 

From the commencement to the termination of this most 
arduous campaign the Army of the Potomac always evinced 
the most perfect subordination, zeal, and alacrity in the per- 
formance of all the duties required of it. 

The amount of severe labor accomplished by this army in the 
construction of entrenchments, roads, bridges, etc., was enor- 
mous ; yet all the work was performed with the most gratifying 
cheerfulness and devotion to the interests of the service. 

DiAing the campaign ten severely contested and sanguinary 
battles had been fought, besides numerous smaller engagements, 
in which the troops exhibited the most determined enthusiasm 
and bravery. They submitted to exposure, sickness, and even 
death, without a murmur. Indeed, they had become veterans in 
their country's cause and richly deserved the warm commenda- 
tion of the government. 

It was in view of these facts that this seemed to me an ap- 
propriate occasion for the general-in-chief to give, in general 
orders, some appreciative expression of the services of the army 
while upon the Peninsula. Accordingly, on the i8th I sent him 
the following despatch : 



HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
Aug. 18, 1862, n P.M. 

Please say a kind word to my army that I can repeat to them 
in general orders in regard to their conduct at Yorktown, Wil- 
liamsburg, West Point, Hanover Court-House, and on the 
Chickahominy, as well as in regard to the Seven Days and the 
recent retreat. 

No one has ever said anything to cheer them but myself. 
Say nothing about me. Merely give my men and officers credit 
for what they have done. It will do you much good, and will 
strengthen you much with them, if you issue a handsome order 



COME YOURSELF. 



507 



to them in regard to what they have accomplished. They de- 
serve it. 

G. B. McCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. 
Maj.-Gen. HALLECK, 

Washington, D. C. 

As no reply was received to this communication, and no 
order was issued by the general-in-chief, I conclude that the 
suggestion did not meet with his approbation. 

All the personnel and material of the army had been trans- 
ferred from Harrison's Landing to the different points of em- 
barkation in the very brief period of five days without the slight- 
est loss or damage. Porter's troops sailed from Newport News 
on the 1 9th and 2oth. Heintzelman's corps sailed from York- 
town on the 2 1 st. On that day I received the following tele- 
gram from the general-in-chief : 

" Leave such garrisons in Fortress Monroe, Yorktown, etc., 
as you may deem proper. They will be replaced by new troops 
as rapidly as possible. 

" The forces of Burnside and Pope are hard pushed, and 
require aid as rapidly as you can send it. Come yourself as 
soon as you can. . . ."

CHAPTER XXX. 

The army reaches Alexandria ; sent forward to Pope Pope's campaign 
McClellan's work at Alexandria The last man sent forward 
Stanton's ironical order McClellan commands a hundred men 
Halleck in despair McClellan's volunteer services. 

ON the evening of Aug. 23 I sailed with my staff for Acquia 
creek, where I arrived at daylight on the following morning, 
reporting to Gen. Halleck as follows : 

Acquia creek, Aug. 24, 1862. I have reached here, and re- 
spectfully report for orders. 

I also telegraphed as follows to Gen. Halleck : 

Morell's scouts report Rappahannock Station burned an 1 
abandoned by Pope without any notice to Morell or Sykes. This 
was telegraphed you some hours ago. Reynolds, Reno, and 
Stevens are supposed to be with Pope, as nothing can be heard 
of them to-day. Morell and Sykes are near Morrisville Post- 
office, watching the lower fords of Rappahannock, with no 
troops between there and Rappahannock Station, which is re- 
ported abandoned by Pope. 

Please inform me immediately exactly where Pope is and 
what doing ; until I know that, I cannot regulate Porter's move- 
ments. He is much exposed now, and decided measures should 
be taken at once. Until I know what my command and posi- 
tion are to be, and whether you still intend to place me in the 
command indicated in your first letter to me, and orally through 
Gen. Burnside at the Chickahominy, I cannot decide where I 
can be of most use. If your determination is unchanged I 
ought to go to Alexandria at once. Please define my position 
and duties. 

To which I received the following reply from Gen. Halleck : 

" Aug. 24. You ask me for information which I cannot give. 
I do not know either where Gen. Pope is or where the enemy 
in force is. These are matters which I have all day been most 
anxious to ascertain." 

On the 26th I received the following from Gen. Halleck : 

508 



ALEXANDRIA. 



509 



" There is reason to believe that the enemy is moving a large 
force into the Shenandoah Valley. Reconnoissances will soon 
determine. Gen. Heintzelman's corps was ordered to report to 
Gen. Pope, and Kearny's will probably be sent to-day against 
the enemy's flank. Don't draw any troops down the Rappahan- 
nock at present ; we shall probably want them all in the direction 
of the Shenandoah. Perhaps you had better leave Gen. Burn- 
side in charge at Acquia creek and come to Alexandria, as very 
great irregularities are reported there. Gen. Franklin's corps 
will march as soon as it receives transportation." 

On receipt of this I immediately sailed for Alexandria, and 
reported as follows to Gen. Halleck : 

Aug. 27, 8 A.M. I arrived here last night, and have taken 
measures to ascertain the state of affairs here, and that proper 
remedies may be applied. Just received a rumor that railway 
bridge over Bull Bun was burned last night. 

Aug. 27, 9.40 A.M. The town is quiet, although quite full of 
soldiers, who are said to be chiefly convalescents. 

The affairs of the quartermaster's department are reported as 
going on well. 

It is said that the Bull Run bridge will be repaired by to-mor- 
row. The disembarkation of Sumner's corps commenced at 
Acquia yesterday afternoon. I found that he could reach Rap- 
pahannock Station earlier that way than from here. 

? 

On the same day I received the following from Gen. Hal- 
leck : 

"Aug. 27. Telegrams from Gen. Porter to Gen. Burnside, 
just received, say that Banks is at Fayetteville ; McDowell, Si- 
gel, and Ricketts near Warrenton ; Reno on his right. Porter 
is marching on Warrenton Junction to reinforce Pope. Nothing 
said of Heintzelman. Porter reports a general battle imminent. 
Franklin's corps should move out by forced marches, carrying 
three or four days' provisions, and to be supplied, as far as pos- 
sible, by railroad. Perhaps you may prefer some other road than 
to Centreville. Col. Haupt has just telegraphed about sending 
out troops. Please see him and give him your directions. 
There has been some serious neglect to guard the railroad, 
which should be immediately remedied." 

I replied as follows : 

Aug. 27, 10 A.M. Telegram this moment received. I have 



5IO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

sent orders to Franklin to prepare to march with his corps at 
once, and to repair here in person to inform me as to his means 
of transportation. 

Kearny was yesterday at Rappahannock Station ; Porter at 
Bealeton, Kellip, Barnell's, etc. Sumner will commence reach- 
ing Falmouth to-day. Williams's Mass. Cavalry will be mostly 
at Falmouth to-day. 

I loaned Burnside my personal escort (one squadron 4th 
regulars), to scout down Rappahannock. 

I have sent for Couch's division to come at once. As fast as 
I gain any information I will forward it, although you may 
already have it. 

I also received the following telegrams from Gen. Halleck : 

"Aug. 27. Direct Gen. Casey to furnish you about 5,000 of 
the new troops under his command. 

" Take entire direction of the sending-out of the troops from 
Alexandria. 

" Determine questions of priority in transportation and the 
places they shall occupy. Pope's headquarters are near Warren- 
ton Junction, but I cannot ascertain the present position of 
his troops." 

"Aug. 27. I can get no satisfactory information from the 
front, either of the enemy or of our troops. There seems to have 
been great neglect and carelessness about Manassas. Franklin's 
corps should march in that direction as soon as possible. A 
competent officer should be sent out to take direction of affairs 
in that vicinity." 

Upon the receipt of these I immediately sent the following 
telegram to Gens. Heintzelman and Porter : 

Alexandria, Aug. 27, 1862, 10.30 A.M. Where are you, and 
what is state of affairs ? What troops in your front, right, and 
left ? Sumner is now landing at Acquia. Where is Pope's left, 
and what of enemy ? Enemy burned Bull Run bridge last night 
with cavalry force. 

Maj.-Gen. HEINTZELMAN, Warrenton. 

Maj.-Gen. PORTER, Bealeton. 

P.S. If these general officers are not at the places named, 
nearest operator will please have message forwarded. 

I also telegraphed to the general-in-chief the following de- 
spatches : 



POPE'S CAMPAIGN. 5 I I 

Aug. 27, 10.50 A.M. I have sent all the information I possess 
to Burnside, instructing him to look out well for his right flank, 
between the Rappahannock and Potomac, and to send no trains 
to Porter without an escort. I fear the cavalry who dashed at 
Bull Run last night may trouble Burnside a little. I have sent 
to communicate with Porter and Heintzelman via Falmouth, 
and hope to give you some definite information in a few hours. 
I shall land the next cavalry I get hold of here, and send it out 
to keep open the communication between Pope and Porter, also 
to watch vicinity of Manassas. Please send me a number of 
copies of the best maps of present field of operations. I can 
use fifty to advantage. 

Aug. 27, 11.20 A.M. In view of Burnside's despatch, just 
received, would it not be advisable to throw the mass of Sum- 
ner's corps here, to move out with Franklin to Centreville or 
vicinity ? If a decisive battle is fought at Warrenton, a disas- 
ter would leave any troops on lower Rappahannock in a dan- 
gerous position. 

They would do better service in front of Washington.' 

Alexandria, Aug. 27, 12 M. I have just learned th'rough Gen. 
Woodbury that it was stated in your office last night that it 
was very strange that, with (20,000) twenty thousand men here, 
I did not prevent the raid upon Manassas. This induces me to 
ask whether your remark in your telegram to-day, that there 
had been great neglect about Manassas, was intended to apply 
to me. I cannot suppose it was, knowing, as you do, that I 
arrived here without information and with no instructions be- 
yond pushing the landing of my troops. The bridge was burned 
before my arrival ; I knew nothing of it until this morning. I 
ask as a matter of justice that you will prevent your staff from 
making statements which do me such gross injustice at a time 
when the most cordial co-operation is required. 

Aug. 27, 12.5 P.M. My aide has just returned from Gen. 
Franklin's camp ; reports that Gens. Franklin, Smith, and Slo- 
cum are all in Washington. He gave the order to the next in 
rank to place the corps in readiness to move at once. I learn 
that heavy firing has been heard this morning at Centreville, 
and have sent to ascertain the truth. I can find no cavalry 
to send out on the roads. Are the works garrisoned and ready 
for defence ? 

Aug. 27, 12.20 P.M. What bridges exist over Bull Run? 
Have steps been taken to construct bridges for the advance 
of troops to reinforce Pope, or to enable him to retreat if in 
trouble ? 



5 12 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

There should be two gunboats at Acquia creek at once. 
Shall I push the rest of Sumner's corps here, or is Pope so 
strong as to be reasonably certain of success? I have sent to 
inspect the works near here and their garrisons. 

As soon as I can find Gen. Casey, or some other command- 
ing officer, I will see to the railway, etc. It would be well to 
have them report to me, as I do not know where they are. ' I 
am trying to find them, and will lose no time in carrying out 
your orders. Would like to see Burnside. 

Aug. 27, 1.15 P.M. Franklin's artillery have no horses, ex- 
cept for (4) four guns without caissons. I can pick up no 
cavalry. In view of these facts, will it not be well to push 
Sumner's corps here by water as rapidly as possible, to make 
immediate arrangements for placing the works in front of Wash- 
ington in an efficient condition of defence ? I have no means 
of knowing the enemy's force between Pope and ourselves. 

Can Franklin, without his artillery or cavalry, effect any use- 
ful purpose in front ? 

Should not Burnside take steps at once to evacuate Fal- 
mouth and Acquia, at the same time covering the retreat of 
any of Pope's troops who may fall back in that direction ? 

I do not see that we have force enough in hand to form a 
connection with Pope, whose exact position we do not know. 
Are we safe in the direction of the valley ? 

Aug. 27, 1.35 P.M. I learn that Taylor's brigade, sent this 
morning to Bull Run bridge, is either cut to pieces or cap- 
tured ; that the force against them had many guns and about 
(5,000) five thousand infantry, receiving reinforcements every 
minute ; also, that Gainesville is in possession of the enemy. 
Please send some cavalry out towards Dranesville via Chain 
bridge, to watch Lewinsville and Dranesville, and go as far 
as they can. If you will give me even one squadron of good 
cavalry here I will ascertain the state of the case. I think our 
policy now is to make these works perfectly safe, and mobilize 
a couple of corps as soon as possible, but not to advance them 
until they can have their artillery and cavalry. I have sent for 
Col. Tyler to place his artillerymen in the works. 

Is Fort Marcy securely held ? 

Aug. 27, 2.30 P.M. Sumner has been ordered to send here 
all of his corps that are within reach. Orders have been sent 
to Couch to come here from Yorktown with the least possible 
delay. But one squadron of my cavalry has arrived ; that will 
be disembarked at once and sent to the front. 

If there is any cavalry in Washington it should be ordered 
to report to me at once. 



POPE'S CAMPAIGN. 513 

I still think that we should first provide for the immediate 
defence of Washington on both sides of the Potomac. 

I am not responsible for the past, and cannot be for the 
future unless I receive authority to dispose of the available 
troops according to my judgment. Please inform me at once 
what my position is. I do not wish to act in the dark. 

Aug. 27, 6 P.M. I have just received the copy of a despatch 
from Gen. Pope to you, dated ten A.M. this morning, in which he 
says : " All forces now sent forward should be sent to my right 
at Gainesville." 

I now have at my disposal here about (10,000) ten thousand 
men of Franklin's corps, about (2,800) twenty-eight hundred of 
Gen. Tyler's brigade, and Col. Tyler's ist Conn. Artillery, which 
I recommend should be held in hand for the defence of Wash- 
ington. 

If you wish me to order any part of this force to the front, it 
is in readiness to march at a moment's notice to any point you 
may indicate. 

In view of the existing state of things in our front, I have 
deemed it best to order Gen. Casey to hold his men for York- 
town in readiness to move, but not to send them off till further 
orders. 

On the 28th I telegraphed as follows to Gen. Halleck : 

Aug. 28, 4.10 P.M. Gen. Franklin is with me here. I will 
know in a few minutes the condition of artillery and cavalry. 

We are not yet in Condition to move ; may be by to-morrow 
morning. 

Pope must cut through to-day or adopt the plan I suggested. 
I have ordered troops to garrison the works at Upton's Hill. 
They must be held at any cost. As soon as I can see the way to 
spare them I will send a corps of good troops there. It is the 
key to Washington, which cannot be seriously menaced as long 
as it is held. 

I received the following from the general-in-chief : 

II Aug. 28, 1862. I think you had better place Sumner's 
corps, as it arrives, near the guns, and particularly at the Chain 
bridge. 

" The principal thing to be feared now is a cavalry raid into 
this city, especially in the night-time. 

" Use Cox's and Tyler's brigades and the new troops for the 
same object, if you need them. 

" Porter writes to Burnside from Bristoe, 9.30 A.M. yesterday, 



514 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

that Pope's forces were then moving on Manassas, and that Burn- 
side would soon hear of them by way of Alexandria. 

" Gen. Cullum has gone to Harper's Ferry, and I have only a 
single regular officer for duty in the office. 

" Please send some of your officers to-day to see that every 
precaution is taken at the forts against a raid, also at the bridge. 
Please answer." 

On the 29th the following despatch was telegraphed to Gen. 
Halleck : 



Aug. 29, 10.30 A.M. Franklin's corps is in motion ; started 
about (6) six A.M. I can give him but two squadrons of cavalry. 
I propose moving Gen. Cox to Upton's Hill, to hold that 
important point with its works, and to push cavalry scouts to 
Vienna via Freedom Hill and Hunter's Lane. Cox has (2) two 
squadrons of cavalry. Please answer at once whether this meets 
your approval. I have directed Woodbury, with the engineer bri- 
gade, to hold Fort Lyon. Sumner detached last night two regi- 
ments to vicinity of Forts Ethan Allen and Marcy. Meagher's 
brigade is still at Acquia. If he moves in support of Franklin 
it leaves us without any reliable troops in and near Washington. 
Yet Franklin is too weak alone. What shall be done ? No more 
cavalry arrived ; have but (3) three squadrons. Franklin has 
but (40) forty rounds of ammunition, and no wagons to move 
more. I do not think Franklin is in condition to accomplish 
much if he meets with serious resistance. I should not have 
moved him but for your pressing order of last night. What have 
you from Vienna and Dranesville ? 

To which the following is a reply from Gen. Halleck : 

"Aug. 29, 12 M. Upton's Hill arrangement all right. We 
must send wagons and ammunition to Franklin as fast as they 
arrive. 

" Meagher's brigade ordered up yesterday. Fitz-Hugh Lee 
was, it is said on good authority, in Alexandria on Sunday last 
for three hours. I have nothing from Dranesville." 

On the same day the following was received from his Excel- 
lency the President : 

" Washington, Aug. 29, 1862, 2.30 P.M. What news from 
direction of Manassas Junction ? What generally ? 

" A. LINCOLN. 
" Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 



FRANKLIN'S CORPS. 515 

To which I replied as follows : 

Aug. 29, 1862, 2.45 P.M. The last news I received from the 
direction of Manassas was from stragglers, to the effect that the 
enemy were evacuating Centreville and retiring towards Tho- 
roughfare Gap. This by no means reliable. 

I am clear that one of two courses should be adopted : ist, to 
concentrate all our available forces to open communications with 
Pope ; 2d, to leave Pope to get out of his scrape, and at once use 
all our means to make the capital perfectly safe. 

No middle ground will now answer. Tell me what you wish 
me to do, and I will do all in my power to accomplish it. I wish 
to know what my orders and authority are. I ask for nothing, 
but will obey whatever orders you give. I only ask a prompt 
decision, that I may at once give the necessary orders. It will 
not do to delay longer. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen* 

A. LINCOLN, President. 

And copy to Gen. Halleck. 

To which the following is a reply : 

" Washington, Aug. 29, 1862, 4.10 P.M. Yours of to-day just 
received. I think your first alternative, to wit, " to concentrate 
all our available forces to open communication with Pope," is the 
right one, but I wish not to control. That I now leave to Gen. 
Halleck, aided by your counsels. 

" A. LINCOLN. 

" Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

It had been officially reported to me from Washington that 
the enemy, in strong force, was moving through Vienna in the 
direction of the Chain bridge, and had a large force in Vienna. 
This report, in connection with the despatch of the general-in- 
chief on the 28th, before noted, induced me to direct Franklin to 
halt his command near Annandale until it could be determined, 
by reconnoissances to Vienna and towards Manassas, whether 
these reports were true. Gen. Cox was ordered to send his small 
cavalry force from Upton's Hill towards Vienna and Dranesville 
in one direction, and towards Fairfax Court-House in the other, 
and Franklin to push his two squadrons as far towards Manassas 
as possible, in order to ascertain the true position of the enemy. 

With the enemy in force at Vienna and towards Lewinsville, 
it would have been very injudicious to have pushed Franklin's 



516 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

small force beyond Annandale. It must be remembered that at 
that time we were cut off from direct communication with Gen. 
Pope ; that the enemy was, by the last accounts, at Manassas in 
strong force, and that Franklin had only from 10,000 to 11,000 
men, with an entirely insufficient force of cavalry and artillery. 

In order to represent this condition of affairs in its proper 
light to the general-in-chief, and to obtain definite instructions 
from him, I telegraphed to him as follows : 

Aug. 29, 12 M. Have ordered most of the (i2th) Twelfth 
Penn. Cavalry to report to Gen. Barnard for scouting duty 
towards Rockville, Poolesville, etc. 

If you apprehend a raid of cavalry on your side of river, I 
had better send a brigade or two of Sumner's to near Tennally- 
town, where, with two or three old regiments in Forts Allen and 
Marcy, they can watch both Chain bridge and Tennallytown. 

Would it meet your views to post the rest of Sumner's corps, 
between Arlington and Fort Corcoran, whence they can either 
support Cox, Franklin, or Chain bridge, and even Tennallytown ? 

Franklin has only between (10,000) ten thousand and (11,000) 
eleven thousand for duty. 

How far do you wish this force to advance ? 

Also the following : 

Aug. 29, i P.M. I anxiously await reply to my last despatch 
in regard to Sumner. Wish to give the order at once. 

Please authorize me to attach new regiments permanently to 
my old brigades. I can do much good to old and new troops in 
that way. I shall endeavor to hold a line in advance of Forts 
Allen and Marcy, at least with strong advanced guards. I wish 
to hold the line through Prospect Hill, Mackall's, Minor's, and 
Hall's Hills. This will give us timely warning. Shall I do as 
seems best to me with all the troops in this vicinity, including 
Franklin, who I really think ought not, under present circum- 
stances, to advance beyond Annandale ? 

On the same day I received a despatch from the general-in- 
chief, in which he asks me why I halted Franklin in Annandale, 
to which I replied as follows : 

Aug. 29, 10.30 A.M. By referring to my telegrams of 10.30 
A.M., 12 M., and i P.M., together with your reply of 2.48 P.M.,, 
you will see why Franklin's corps halted at Annandale. His, 
small cavalry force all I had to give him was ordered to push . 
on as far as possible towards Manassas. 



FRANK LI WS CORPS. 517 

It was not safe for Franklin to move beyond Annandale, 
under the circumstances, until we knew what was at Vienna. 

Gen. Franklin remained here until about one P.M., endeavor- 
ing to arrange for supplies for his command. I am responsible 
for both these circumstances, and do not see that either was in 
disobedience to your orders. 

Please give distinct orders in reference to Franklin's move- 
ments of to-morrow. I have sent to Col. Haupt to push out 
construction and supply trains as soon as possible. 

Gen. Tyler to furnish the necessary guards. 

I have directed Gen. Banks's supply-trains to start out to- 
night at least as far as Annandale, with an escort from Gen. 
Tyler. 

In regard to to-morrow's movements I desire definite instruc- 
tions, as it is not agreeable to me to be accused of disobeying 
orders when I have simply exercised the discretion you com- 
mitted to me. 

On the same evening I sent the following despatches to Gen. 
Halleck : 

Aug. 29, 10 P.M. Not hearing from you, I have sent orders 
to Gen. Franklin to place himself in communication with Gen. 
Pope as soon as possible, and at the same time cover the transit 
of Pope's supplies. 

Orders have been given for railway and wagon trains to move 
to Pope with least possible delay. 

I am having inspections made of all the forts around the city 
by members of my staff, with instructions to give all requisite 
orders. 

I inspected Worth and Ward myself this evening; found them 
in good order. 

Reports, so far as heard from, are favorable as to condition of 
works. 

Aug. 29, 10 P.M. Your despatch received. Franklin's corps 
has been ordered to march at six o'clock to-morrow morning. 
Sumner has about 14,000 infantry, without cavalry or artillery, 
here. Cox's brigade of four regiments is here, with two bat- 
teries of artillery. Men of two regiments, much fatigued, came 
in to-day. Tyler's brigade of three new regiments, but little 
drilled, is also here ; all these troops will be ordered to hold 
themselves ready to march to-morrow morning, and all except 
Franklin's to await further orders. 

If you wish any of them to move towards Manassas, please 
inform me. 

Col. Wagner, 2d N. Y. Artillery, has just come in from the 



518 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

front. He reports strong infantry and cavalry force of rebels 
near Fairfax Court-House ; reports rumors from various sources 
that Lee and Stuart, with large forces, are at Manassas ; that the 
enemy, with 120,000 men, intend advancing on the forts near 
Arlington and Chain bridge, with a view of attacking Washington 
and Baltimore. 

Gen. Barnard telegraphs me to-night that the length of the 
line of fortifications on this side of the Potomac requires 2,000 
additional artillerymen, and additional troops to defend intervals, 
according to circumstances ; at all events, he says an old regi- 
ment should be added to the force at Chain bridge, and a few 
regiments distributed along the lines to give confidence to our 
new troops. I agree with him fully, and think our fortifications 
along the upper part of our line on this side the river very unsafe 
with their present garrisons, and the movements of the enemy 
seem to indicate an attack upon those works. 

Aug. 30, 11.30 A.M. Your telegram of 9 A.M. received. Ever 
since Gen. Franklin received notice that he was to march from 
Alexandria he has been endeavoring to get transportation from 
the quartermaster at Alexandria, but he has uniformly been told 
that there was none disposable, and his command marched with- 
out wagons. After the departure of his corps he procured twenty 
wagons, to carry some extra ammunition, by unloading Banks's 
supply-train. 

Gen. Sumner endeavored, by application upon the quarter- 
master's department, to get wagons to carry his reserve ammuni- 
tion, but without success, and was obliged to march with what he 
could carry in his cartridge-boxes. 

I have this morning directed that all my headquarters wagons 
that are landed be at once loaded with ammunition for Sumner 
and Franklin ; but they will not go far towards supplying the 
deficiency. 

Eighty-five wagons were got together by the quartermasters 
last night, loaded with subsistence, and sent forward at one A.M. 
with an escort via Annandale. Every effort has been made to 
carry out your orders promptly. The great difficulty seems to 
consist in the fact that the greater part of the transportation on 
hand at Alexandria and Washington has been needed for current 
supplies of the garrisons. Such is the state of the case as repre- 
sented to me by the quartermasters, and it appears to be true. 

I take it for granted that this has not been properly explained 
to you. 

On the morning of the 3oth heavy artillery-firing was heard in 
the direction of Fairfax Court-House, which I reported to the 
general-in-chief : 



VOLUNTEER SERVICE. 



519 



Aug. 30, 9.15 A.M. Heavy artillery firing is now in progress 
in direction of Fairfax Court-House; there has been a good deal 
of it for two or three hours. I hear it so distinctly that I should 
judge it to be this side of Fairfax. Have not yet been able to 
ascertain the cause. It seems that the garrisons in the works on 
north side of Potomac are altogether too small. 

At eight A.M. the following was sent to Gen. J. G. Barnard in 
Washington : 

Aug. 30, 8 A.M. I yesterday sent nearly a regiment of cav- 
alry to report to you for scouting on north bank of Potomac. 
Three brigades of Sumner's are on both sides of Chain bridge, 
and thence to Tennallytown. The rest of this corps near Arling- 
ton and Corcoran. I have nothing in hand here at all not a 
man. You had better ask for some more raw troops on north 
side. 

At 8. 20 A.M. the following was sent to Gen. Burnside at 
Falmouth : 

Aug. 30, 8.20 A.M. Telegram of midnight received. Use 
your discretion about the cavalry. I have only three squadrons,, 
two of which with Franklin. I expect some to-day. Do not 
strip yourself of anything. Your information about Pope sub- 
stantially confirmed from this side. His troops are at Centre- 
ville. Supplies have gone to him by rail and by wagon. Secesh 
has missed his first coup. We will soon see what his second is to- 
be. 

At eleven A.M. the following telegram was sent to Gen. Hal- 
leek : 

Aug. 30, ii A.M. Have ordered Sumner to leave (i) one 
brigade in vicinity of Chain bridge, and to move the rest via 
Columbia pike on Annandale and Fairfax Court-House. 

Is this the route you wish them to take ? He and Franklin 
are both instructed to join Pope as promptly as possible. 

Shall Couch move out also when he arrives ? 

On the same day I received the following from Gen. Hal- 
leek : 

"Aug. 30, 1.45 P.M. Ammunition, and particularly for artil- 
lery, must be immediately sent forward to Centreville for Gen. 
Pope. It must be done with all possible despatch." 



520 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

To which this reply was made : 

Aug. 30, 2.10 P.M. I know nothing of the calibres of Pope's 
artillery. All I can do is to direct my ordnance officer to load 
up all the wagons sent to him. I have already sent all my head- 
quarters wagons. You will have to see that wagons are sent from 
Washington. I can do nothing more than give the order that 
every available wagon in Alexandria shall be loaded at once. 

The order to the brigade of Sumner that I directed to remain 
near Chain bridge and Tennallytown should go from your head- 
quarters to save time. I understand you to intend it also to 
move. I have no sharpshooters except the guard around my 
camp. I have sent off every man but those, and will now send 
them with the train, as you direct. I will also send my only 
remaining squadron of cavalry with Gen. Sumner. I can do no 
more. You now have every man of the Army of the Potomac 
who is within my reach. 

The War Department now issued the following order: 

"WAR DEPARTMENT, Aug. 30, 1862. 

" The following are the commanders of the armies operating 
in Virginia : 

" Gen. Burnside commands his own corps, except those that 
have been temporarily detached and assigned to Gen. Pope. 

" Gen. McClellan commands that portion of the Army of the 
Potomac that has not been sent forward to Gen. Pope's com- 
mand. 

" Gen. Pope commands the Army of Virginia and all the 
forces temporarily attached to it. 

"All the forces are under the command of Maj.-Gen. Hal- 
leek, general-in-chief. 

"E. D. TOWNSEND, 

"Assist. Adj.-Gen." 

I was informed by Col. Townsend that the above order was 
published by order of the Secretary of War. The following 
despatch was sent to Gen. Barnard at Washington the same 
day : 

Aug. 30, 3.20 P.M. Your telegram to Gen. Williams received. 
Of course everything is under your charge as usual. Upon arriv- 
ing here and finding the state of things uncertain in my front, I 
took all the means in my power to place affairs in a safe con- 
dition. At the request of Gen. Halleck I sent some of my staff 
officers to inspect the works. I have placed Tyler's regiment in 
garrison near here, and ordered the (i4th) Fourteenth Mass, to 



SENIOR GENERAL OFFICER. 521 

duty again as heavy artillery. I have merely used my authority 
as the senior general officer for duty to assist you, having failed 
to find you. The whole of Sumner's corps has been ordered to 
the front by Gen. Halleck. Couch's division will take the same 
direction as soon as it arrives. I am now sending off my camp- 
guard and escort the last I can do. Tyler will, of course, be 
under your orders so long as he remains in the works. 

I have no more troops to give you, and, as I have no com- 
mand nor any position, I shall not regard it as my duty to take 
any further steps in regard to the works, except that I shall 
always be glad to confer with you in regard to any point about 
which you may be in doubt. I shall try to see Gen. Cox at 
Upton's Hill to-day or to-morrow. I think he ranks you, but his 
command was the only one available for the purpose. 

The following were sent to Gen. Halleck the same after- 
noon : 

Aug. 30, 5.15 P.M. Despatch just received from Gen. Cox, at 
Upton's Hill, reports that his cavalry have been to Fairfax Court- 
House, Vienna, Freedom Hill, and Lewinsville, and found all 
quiet and no enemy heard of in immediate neighborhood. Has 
a party out to go to Dranesville, if practicable. States that at 
four P.M. Lieut.-Col. Fowler, of i4th Brooklyn, passed him 
in an ambulance, wounded, who states that the fighting was 
north of Little River pike, between it and Thoroughfare Gap. 
Longstreet had passed through the Gap, which was subsequently 
partially obstructed by our troops, so that it would hardly be 
practicable as a retreat for artillery. Reports general result of 
fighting in our favor, but cannot give particulars. 

Gen. Cox states that firing at four P.M. was more rapid and 
continuous than before. I still hear it. 

Aug. 30, 7.45 P.M. I am glad to report the arrival of Col. 
Gregg with about (450) four hundred and fifty of his regiment, 
the (8th) Eighth Penn. Cavalry. Col. Gregg will disembark 
during the night and lose no time in getting his men ready to 
march. More of Gen. Couch's division have arrived. I have 
ordered them to disembark during the night. Have you any 
special orders for Gregg? Couch's .infantry are almost [too] 
good to use as railway guards. It is an excellent division of vet- 
erans. Will you permit new troops to be used for the purpose ? 

At 10.30 P.M. the following telegram was sent to Gen. Hal- 
leck : 

Aug. 30, 10.30 P.M. I have sent to the front all my troops,

524 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

with the exception of Couch's division, and have given the orders 
necessary to insure its being disposed of as you directed. I 
hourly expect the return of one of my aides, who will give 
authentic news from the field of battle. 

I cannot express to you the pain and mortification I have 
experienced to-day in listening to the distant sound of the firing 
of my men. As I can be of no further use here, I respectfully 
ask that, if there is a probability of the conflict being renewed 
to-morrow, I may be permitted to go to the scene of battle with 
my staff, merely to be with my own men, if nothing more ; they 
will fight none the worse for my being with them. If it is not 
deemed best to entrust me with the command even of my own 
army, I simply ask to be permitted to share their fate on the field 
of battle. 

Please reply to this to-night. 

I have been engaged for the last few hours in doing what I 
can to make arrangements for the wounded. I have started out 
all the ambulances now landed. 

As I have sent my escort to the front, I would be glad to 
take some of Gregg's cavalry with me, if allowed to go. 

To which, on the following day, I received this answer : 

"Aug. 31, 9.18 A.M. I have just seen your telegram of 11.5 
last night. The substance was stated to me when received, but 
I did not know that you asked for a reply immediately. I can- 
not answer without seeing the President, as Gen. Pope is in com- 
mand, by his orders, of the department. 

" I think Couch's division should go forward as rapidly as 
possible and find the battle-field." 

On the same day the following was received from Gen. Hal- 
leek : 

"Aug. 31, 12.45 P - M - The subsistence department are mak- 
ing Fairfax Station their principal depot. It should be well 
guarded. The officer in charge should be directed to secure the 
depot by abatis against cavalry. As many as possible of the new 
regiments should be prepared to take the field. Perhaps some 
more should be sent to the vicinity of Chain bridge." 

At 2.30 P.M. the following despatch was telegraphed to Gen. 
Halleck : 

Aug. 31, 2.30 P.M. Maj. Haller is at Fairfax Station with 
my provost and headquarters guard and other troops. I have 



HALLECK TIRED OUT. 525 

requested (4) four more companies to be sent at once, and the 
precautions you direct to be taken. 

Under the War Department order of yesterday I have no 
control over anything except my staff, some one hundred men in 
my camp here, and the few remaining near Fort Monroe. I have 
no control over the new regiments do not know where they are, 
or anything about them, except those near here. Their com- 
manding officers and those of the works are not under me. 

Where I have seen evils existing under my eye I have cor- 
rected them. I think it is the business of Gen. Casey to prepare 
the new regiments for the field, and a matter between him and 
Gen. Barnard to order others to the vicinity of Chain bridge. 
Neither of them is under my command, and by the War Depart- 
ment order I have no right to give them orders. 

To which the following was the answer from Gen. Halleck : 

" Aug. 31, 10.7 P.M. Since receiving your despatch relating 
to command, I have not been able to answer any not of absolute 
necessity. I have not seen the order as published, but will write 
to you in the morning. You will retain the command of every- 
thing in this vicinity not temporarily belonging to Pope's army in 
the field. 

" I beg of you to assist me in this crisis with your ability and 
experience. I am entirely tired out." 

The following reply was sent to Gen. Halleck that night : 

Aug. 31, 10.25 P - M - I am ready to afford you any assistance 
in my power, but you will readily perceive how difficult an unde- 
fined position such as I now hold must be. 

At what hour in the morning can I see you alone, either at 
your own house or the office ? 

At 7.30 P.M. the following was sent to Gen. Halleck : 

Aug. 31, 7.30 P.M. Having been informed that there were 
some twenty thousand stragglers from Pope's army between this 
and Centreville, all of Gregg's cavalry have been sent to endeavor 
to drive them back to their regiments. Two hundred of 8th 111. 
Cavalry will be ready in the morning, and two hundred and fifty 
more as soon as disembarked. The armament of Forts Buffalo 
and Ramsay is very incomplete. 

At 11.30 P.M. I telegraphed the following to Gen. Halleck : 
Aug. 31, 11.30 P.M. The squadron of 2d Regular Cavalry 



526 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

that I sent with Gen. Sumner was captured to-day about two 
P.M. some three miles from Fairfax Court-House, beyond it on 
the Little River pike, by Fitz-Hugh Lee with 3,000 cavalry and 
three light batteries. 

I have conversed with the first sergeant, who says that when 
he last saw them they were within a mile of Fairfax. Pope had 
no troops on that road, this squadron getting there by mistake. 
There is nothing of ours on the right of Centreville but Sum- 
ner's corps. There was much artillery-firing during the day. A 
rebel major told the sergeant that the rebels had driven in our 
entire left to-day. He says the road is filled with wagons and 
stragglers coming towards Alexandria. 

It is clear from the sergeant's account that we were badly 
beaten yesterday, and that Pope's right is entirely exposed. 

I recommend that no more of Couch's division be sent to the 
front, that Burnside be brought here as soon as practicable, and 
that everything available this side of Fairfax be drawn in at once, 
including the mass of the troops on the railroad. I apprehend 
that the enemy will or have by this time occupied Fairfax Court- 
House and cut off Pope entirely, unless he falls back to-night 
via Sangster's and Fairfax Station. 

I think these orders should be sent at once. I have no con- 
fidence in the dispositions made as I gather them. To speak 
frankly and the occasion requires it there appears to be a 
total absence of brains, and I fear the total destruction of the 
army. I have some cavalry here that can carry out any orders 
you may have to send. The occasion is grave, and demands 
grave measures. The question is the salvation of the country. 
I learn that our loss yesterday amounted to 15,000. We cannot 
afford such losses without an object. 

It is my deliberate opinion that the interests of the nation 
demand that Pope should fall back to-night, if possible, and not 
one moment is to be lost. 

I will use all the cavalry I have to watch our right. Please 
answer at once. I feel confident that you can rely upon the 
information I give you. 

I shall be up all night, and ready to obey any orders you give 
me. 

To which this reply was received from Gen. Halleck : 

"Sept. i, 1.30 A.M. Burnside was ordered up very early yes- 
terday morning. Retain remainder of Couch's forces, and make 
arrangements to stop all retreating troops in line of works, or 
where you can best establish an entire line of defence. My 
news from Pope was up to four P.M.; he was then all right. I 
must wait for more definite information before I can order a 
retreat, as the falling back on the line of works must necessarily

be directed in case of a serious disaster. Give me all additional 
news that is reliable. 

" I shall be up all night, and ready to act as circumstances 
may require. I am fully aware of the gravity of the crisis, and 
have been for weeks." 

It will be seen from what has preceded that I lost no time in 
moving the Army of the Potomac from the Peninsula to the sup- 
port of the Army of Virginia ; that I spared no effort to hasten 
the embarkation of the troops at Fort Monroe, Newport News, 
and Yorktown, remaining at Fort Monroe myself until the mass 
of the army had sailed ; and that after my arrival at Alexandria 
I left nothing in my power undone to forward supplies and rein- 
forcements to Gen. Pope. I sent with the troops that moved all 
the cavalry I could get hold of even my personal escort was 
sent out upon the line of the railway as a guard, with the provost 
and camp-guard at headquarters retaining less than 100 men, 
many of whom were orderlies, invalids, members of bands, etc. 
All the headquarters teams that arrived were sent out with sup- 
plies and ammunition, none being retained even to move the 
headquarters camp. The squadron that habitually served as my 
personal escort was left at Falmouth with Gen. Burnside, as he 
was deficient in cavalry. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[Aug. 24 to Sept. 2, 1862.] 

Aitg. 24, Sunday, 9.30 A.M., Acquia creek. We reached here 
during the night. Sent a despatch about six to Halleck, inform- 
ing him that I had arrived here and awaited orders ; also sent 
one to Burnside. ... I have no reply as yet to my despatches, 
and am not at all impatient. I learn that all my troops are 
ordered to Alexandria for embarkation, so I presume they will 
be merged in Pope's army. If this is the case I will (if I find it 
proper) try for a leave of absence. ... I learn nothing whatever 
of the state of affairs, not even whether Pope is still falling back 
or whether there has been any fighting. So I suppose it is all 
right. I fancy that Pope is in retreat, though this is only a 
guess of mine, without anything to base it on. I don't see how I 
can remain in the service if placed under Pope ; it would be too 
great a disgrace, and I can hardly think that Halleck would per- 
mit it to be offered me. ... I expect Porter and Burnside here 
in a few minutes, and then will know something of the state of 
affairs, I hope. This is a wretched place, utterly unfit for the 
landing and supplying of a large body of troops. They have at 
last found it out, though H. insisted upon it that there were 
ample facilities here for all purposes. . . . 

12.15 P - M - I nave se en Burnside and Porter, and gained 
some information from them. I have not one word yet from 
Washington, and am quietly waiting here for something to turn 
up. I presume they are discussing me now, to see whether they 
can get along without me. . . . They will suffer a terrible defeat 
if the present state of affairs continues. I know that with God's 
help I can save them. . . . 

Aug. 25, i P.M. . . ..Was at Falmouth pretty much all 

night. . . . 

528 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 529 

Aug. 27, A.M., Alexandria. We arrived here last night. 
Rose early ; reported to Washington that I had arrived, and am 
waiting for something to turn up. It seems that some 500 of 
the enemy's cavalry made a dash last night and burned the Bull 
Run railroad bridge. I fear this will cause much inconvenience, 
as the troops in front are mainly dependent on the railroad for 
supplies. My troops are getting pretty well into position : Por- 
ter between Fredericksburg and the Rappahannock Station ; 
Heintzelman at Rappahannock Station ; Franklin near this 
place ; Sumner landing at Acquia creek. I have heard nothing 
new to-day, and don't know what is going on in front ; am ter- 
ribly ignorant of the state of affairs, and therefore somewhat 
anxious to know. ... I find all going on well enough here. 
Davis has just returned from selecting a camp for headquar- 
ters ; he has picked out a place between the Seminary (our old 
camp) and the river, about one-half or three-quarters of a mile 
from the Seminary. I shall go into my tent this time and not 
trouble a house. With the exception of the two or three days I 
passed at Williamsburg on our upward march, and one night at 
Fort Monroe, I have not slept in a house since I left you. I 
know nothing definite yet in regard to my fate. . . . 

10.30. Have been again interrupted by telegrams requiring 
replies. Halleck is in a disagreeable situation : can get no infor- 
mation from the front, either as to our own troops or the enemy. 
I shall do all I can to help him loyally and will trouble him as 
little as possible, but render all the assistance in my power with- 
out regard to myself or my own position. . . . Our affairs here 
are much tangled up, and I opine that in a day or two your old 
husband will be called upon to unravel them. In the meantime 
I shall be very patient, do to the best of my ability whatever I 
am called upon to do, and wait my time. I hope to have my 
part of the work pretty well straightened out to-day. In that 
case I shall move up to Washington this evening. . . . Have just 
heard that it is probable that a general engagement will be fought 
to-day or to-morrow near Warrenton. . . . 

Aug. 28, 9.30 A.M., steamer "Ariel" \ am just about starting 
back for Alexandria. I came up here (Washington) last night; 
reached Halleck's house about midnight, and remained talking 
with him until three. ... I have a great deal of hard work 



530 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

before me now, but will do my best to perform it. I find Hal- 
leck well disposed ; he has had much to contend against. I shall 
keep as clear as possible of the President and cabinet ; endeavor 
to do what must be done with Halleck alone ; so I shall get on 
better. Pope is in a bad way ; his communication with Wash- 
ington cut off, and I have not yet the force at hand to relieve 
him. He has nearly all the troops of my army that have ar- 
rived. I hope to hear better news when I reach Alexandria. 

Aug. 29, 3 P.M. ... I was awake all last night, and have 
not had one moment until now to write to you. I have a ter- 
rible task on my hands now perfect imbecility to correct. No 
means to act with, no authority, yet determined, if possible, to 
save the country and the capital. I find the soldiers all cling- 
ing to me ; yet I am not permitted to go to the post of danger ! 
Two of my corps will either save Pope or be sacrificed for the 
country. I do not know whether I shall be permitted to save 
the capital or not. I have just telegraphed very plainly to the 
President and Halleck what I think ought to be done. I ex- 
pect merely a contemptuous silence. ... I am heart-sick with 
the folly and ignorance I see around me. God grant that I may 
never pass through such a scene again ! . . . 

9.30 P.M. . . Late yesterday afternoon a violent gale arose 
and blew over my tent, soaking everything I had, including this 
note and myself. ... I have been terribly busy since reaching 
here ; not a moment have I had to myself. I found everything 
in the most terrible confusion apparently inextricably so ; but 
affairs are now better. The works on this side of the river are 
in condition for defence. ... I see the evening paper states 
that I have been placed in command of all the troops in Vir- 
ginia. This is not so. I have no command at present that is 
to say, I have none of the Army of the Potomac with me, and 
have merely " turned in " on my own account to straighten out 
whatever I catch hold of. By to-morrow evening I hope to 
have the works, etc., in fair condition of defence. . . . Pope has 
been in a tight place, but from the news received this evening I 
think the danger is pretty much over. To-morrow will tell the 
story. I am terribly crippled by the want of cavalry. None of 
mine have arrived except three small squadrons. I hope for 
more to-night. There was a terrible scare in Washington last

night. A rumor got out that Lee was advancing rapidly on the 
Chain bridge with 150,000 men. And such a stampede ! I did 
not get five minutes' consecutive sleep all night, so thick were 
the telegrams. ... I have seen neither the President nor the 
secretary since I arrived here ; have been only once to Wash- 
ington, and hope to see very little of the place. I abominate 
it terribly. ... I have no faith in any one here, and expect to 
be turned loose the moment their alarm is over. I expect I 
got into a row with Halleck to-night. He sent me a telegram 
I did not like, and I told him so very plainly. He is not a 
refined person at all, and probably says rough things when he 
don't mean them. . . . 

Aug. 30, 8 A.M. . . . Was awakened last night by a few 
scattering shots that, no doubt, came from some of those very 
raw troops that are about here. Shall start soon after breakfast 
and ride to Upton's Hill, thence to the Chain bridge and along 
the line of forts. I want to see all on this side of the river to- 
day, if I can. No one in Washington appears to know the condi- 
tion of matters, and I have a fancy for finding them out for my- 
self. If I once get matters reasonably straight I shall not trouble 
myself much more. What I am doing now is rather a vol- 
unteer affair not exactly my business ; but you know that I 
have a way of attending to most other things than my own 
affairs. . . . 

1.30 P.M., camp near Alexandria. ... I expected to start 
out on a long ride, but have thus far been detained by various 
matters which have kept me very busy. . . . There has been 
heavy firing going on all day long somewhere beyond Bull Run. 
I have sent up every man I have, pushed everything, and am 
left here on the flat of my back without any command whatever. 
It is dreadful to listen to this cannonading and not be able to 
take any part in it. But such is my fate. . . . 

9.15 P.M. ... I feel too blue and disgusted to write any 
more now, so I will smoke a cigar and try to get into a better 
humor. They have taken all my troops from me ! I have even 
sent off my personal escort and camp-guard, and am here with 
a few orderlies and the aides. I have been listening to the 
sound of a great battle in the distance. My men engaged in 
it and I away ! I never felt worse in my life. 



532 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Sunday (31^), 9.30 A.M. . . . There was a severe battle yes- 
terday, and almost exactly on the old Bull Run battle-ground. 
Pope sent in accounts during the day that he was getting on 
splendidly, driving the enemy all day, gaming a glorious victory, 
etc., etc. About three this morning Hammerstein returned from 
the field (where I had sent him to procure information), and told 
me that we were badly whipped, McDowell's and Sigel's corps 
broken, the corps of my own army that were present (Porter and 
Heintzelman) badly cut up but in perfect order. Banks was not 
engaged. Franklin had arrived and was in position at Centre- 
ville. Sumner must have got up by this time. Couch's division 
is about starting. It is probable that the enemy are too much 
fatigued to renew the attack this morning, perhaps not at all to- 
day ; so that time may be given to our people to make such 
arrangements as will enable them to hold their own. I tele- 
graphed last evening asking permission to be with my troops ; 
received a reply about half an hour ago from Halleck that he 
would have to consult the President first ! If they refuse to let 
me go out I think I shall feel obliged to insist upon a leave, or 
something of the kind, the moment the question of the existing 
battle is settled. I feel like a fool here, sucking my thumbs and 
doing nothing but what ought to be done by junior officers. I 
leave it all in the hands of the Almighty. I will try to do my 
best in the position that may be assigned to me, and be as patient 
as I can. . . . 

10.45. ... I feel in that state of excitement and anxiety 
that I can hardly keep still for a moment. I learn from Ham- 
merstein that the men in front are all anxious for me to be with 
them. It is too cruel ! 

12.30 P.M. A short time since I saw the order defining com- 
mands. Mine is that part of the Army of the Potomac not sent 
to Pope. As all is sent there, I am left in command of nothing 
a command I feel fully competent to exercise, and to which I can 
do full justice. I am going to write a quiet, moderate letter to 

Mr. presently, explaining to him the exact state of the case, 

without comment, so that my friends in New York may know all. 
. . . Everything is too uncertain and unsafe around Washington 
at present for you to dream of going there. As a matter of self- 
respect, I cannot go there. ... I do not regard Washington as 
safe against the rebels. If I can quietly slip over there I will

send your silver off. There is an order forbidding any one 
going there without permission from the War Department, and 
I do not care to ask them for so slight a favor as that. . . . 

Sept. i, Washington, 2 P.M. I have only time to tell you that 
I have been placed in command of Washington and all the garri- 
sons, etc., in the vicinity, to do the best I can with it. The 
decisive battle will be fought to-day near Fairfax Court-House. 
My headquarters are to be in town. If the squall passes over, 
and Washington is a safe place, you shall come on to see me, if 
I can't get off to see you. . . . 



CHAPTER XXXII. 

Recalled to save the capital Pope defeated The President appeals to< 
McClellan He accepts command Alarm in Washington Enthu- 
siasm of the army The capital safe The order of Sept. 2 Hal- 
leek's testimony Stormy cabinet meeting. 

LATE at night of Aug. 31, 1 think, Maj. Hammerstein one of 
my aides, whom I had sent to the front to bring me news as to 
the real state of affairs returned, bringing a despatch from Pope, 
which was to be sent to Halleck by telegraph. The information 
Hammerstein brought proved that Pope's despatch was false 
throughout. 

On the ist of Sept. I met Gen. Halleck at his office in Wash- 
ington, who by verbal order directed me to take charge of 
Washington and its defences, but expressly prohibited me 
from exercising any control over the active troops under Gen. 
Pope. 

At this interview I told him what I had every reason to know 
to be the true state of affairs. He doubted the accuracy of my 
information and believed the statements of Pope. I then told 
him that he ought to go to the front in person and see what the 
true condition of affairs was. He said that he was so much 
occupied with office-duty that it was impossible for him to leave. 
I told him that there could be no duty so important for the 
general-in-chief of the armies as to know the condition of the 
chief army of the country, then actually fighting for the defence 
of the capital, and that his first duty was to go out and see for 
himself how matters stood, and, if need be, assume command in 
person. He merely repeated his reply, and I urged him as 
strongly as possible to follow my advice. He still refused, and 
I then urged him to send out his chief of staff, Gen. Cullum, who 
just then entered the room, but Cullum said that he could not 
go. Then I asked that Kelton, his adjutant-general, might be 
sent. Kelton cheerfully offered to go, and it was determined 
that he should start immediately. I took Kelton to one side and 

534 



RECALLED TO SAVE THE CAPITAL, 



535 






advised him not to content himself with merely seeing Pope, but 
also to make it a point to converse freely with the general officers 
and learn their individual opinions. Next morning while I was 
at breakfast, about 7 or 7.30 o'clock, the President and Gen. Hal- 
leek came to my house. 

The President informed me that Col. Kelton had returned 
and represented the condition of affairs as much worse than I 
had stated to Halleck on the previous day ; that there were 
30,000 stragglers on the roads ; that the army was entirely de- 
feated and falling back to Washington in confusion. He then 
said that he regarded Washington as lost, and asked me if I 
would, under the circumstances, as a favor to him, resume com- 
mand and do the best that could be done. 

Without one moment's hesitation, and without making any 
conditions whatever, I at once said that I would accept the com- 
mand and would stake my life that I would save the city. Both 
the President and Halleck again asserted that it was impossible to 
save the city, and I repeated my firm conviction that I could and 
would save it. They then left, the President verbally placing me 
in entire command of the city and of the troops falling back 
upon it from the front. 

He instructed me to take steps at once to stop and collect the 
stragglers, to place the works in a proper state of defence, and 
to go out to meet and take command of the army when it ap- 
proached the vicinity of the works ; then to put the troops in the 
T)est position for defence committing everything to my hands. 
The President left me with many thanks and showing much 
feeling. 

I immediately went to work, collected my staff, and started 
them in all directions with the necessary orders to the different 
fortifications ; some to the front with orders for the disposition 
of such corps as they met, others to see to the prompt forwarding 
of ammunition and supplies to meet the retreating troops. 

In the course of the morning I signed a requisition for small 
arms and ammunition upon the commandant of the arsenal. 
After a time it was brought back to me with the statement that 
it could not be filled for the reason that the contents of the 
arsenal were all being put, or about being put, on board ship for 
transportation to New York, or some safe place, in accordance 
with the orders of the Secretary of War and general-in-chief, in 



536 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

order to save the stores from the enemy. I at once started out 
and succeeded in having the order countermanded. At the same 
time there was a war-steamer anchored off the White House, with 
steam up, ready to take off the President, cabinet, etc., at a 
moment's notice. 

The only published order ever issued in regard to the extent 
of my command after my interview with the President on the 
morning of the 2d was the following : * 

"WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, 

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 1862. 

" Maj.-Gen. McClellan will have command of the fortifications 
of Washington and of all the troops for the defence of the capital; 
"By order of Maj.-Gen. Halleck.. 

" E. D. TOWNSEND, 

"Assist. Adj.-Genr 

I sent an aide to Gen. Pope with the following letter : 

HEADQUARTERS, WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 1862. 
Maj.-Gen. John Pope, Commanding Army of Virginia : 

GENERAL : Gen. Halleck instructed me to repeat to you the 
order he sent this morning to withdraw your army to Washing- 
ton without unnecessary delay. He feared that his messenger 
might miss you, and desired to take this double precaution. 

In order to bring troops upon ground with which they are 
already familiar, it would be best to move Porter's corps upon 
Upton's Hill, that it may occupy Hall's Hill, etc.; McDowell's to 
Upton's Hill ; Franklin's to the works in front of Alexandria ; 
Heintzelman's to the same vicinity ; Couch to Fort Corcoran, or, 
if practicable, to the Chain bridge ; Sumner either to Fort Albany 
or to Alexandria, as may be most convenient. 

In haste, general, very truly yours, 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. U. S. A. 

In a very short time I had made all the requisite prepara- 
tions and was about to start to the front in person to assume 
command as far out as possible, when a message came to me 
from Gen. Halleck informing me that it was the President's 
order that I should not assume command until the troops had 
reached the immediate vicinity of the fortifications. 

* See note A at end of this chapter. 



JOY OF THE ARMY. 537 

I therefore waited until the afternoon, when I rode out to the 
most advanced of the detached works covering the capital. 

I had with me Colburn, Key, and some other aides, with 
a small cavalry escort, and rode at once to Munson's Hill. 
About the time I reached there the infantry of King's division 
of McDowell's corps commenced arriving, and I halted them 
and ordered them into position. Very soon within twenty 
minutes a regiment of cavalry appeared, marching by twos, 
and sandwiched in the midst were Pope and McDowell with 
their staff officers. I never saw a more helpless-looking head- 
quarters. About this time rather heavy artillery-firing was heard 
in the distance. When these generals rode up to me and the 
ordinary salutations had passed, I inquired what that artillery- 
firing was. Pope replied that it was no doubt that of the enemy 
against Sumner, who formed the rear-guard and was to march 
by the Vienna and Langley road. He also intimated that 
Sumner was probably in a dilemma. He could give me no 
information of any importance in relation to the whereabouts 
of the different corps, except in a most indefinite way ; had 
evidently not troubled his head in the slightest about the move- 
ments of his army in retreat, and had coolly preceded the troops, 
leaving them to get out of the scrape as best they could. He 
and McDowell both asked my permission to go on to Wash- 
ington, to which I assented, remarking at the same time that 
/ was going to that artillery-firing. They then took leave and 
started for Washington. I have never since seen Pope. 

Immediately I despatched all my aides and orderlies with 
instructions to the troops coming in by the Alexandria and 
Central roads, retaining only Colburn with me. I borrowed 
three orderlies from some cavalry at hand, and, accompanied 
by them and Colburn, started across country as rapidly as pos- 
sible to reach the Langley road. By the time I reached that 
road the firing had ceased, with the exception of perhaps a 
dropping shot occasionally. It was after dark I think there 
was moonlight by the time I met the first troops, which were, 
I think, of Morell's division, 5th corps ; Porter had gone on a 
little while before to make arrangements for the bivouac of his 
troops. J was at once recognized by the men, upon which there 
was great cheering and excitement ; but when I came to the 
regular division (Sykes's) the scene was the most touching I had 



538 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

up to that time experienced. The cheers in front had attracted 
their attention, and I have been told since by many that the men 
.at once pricked up their ears and said that it could only be 
for " Little Mac." As soon as I came to them the poor fellows 
broke through all restraints, rushed from the ranks and crowded 
around me, shouting, yelling, shedding tears, thanking God that 
they were with me again, and begging me to lead them back to 
battle. It was a wonderful scene, and proved that I had the 
hearts of these men.* 

I next met Sigel's corps, and soon satisfied myself that 
Sumner was pursuing his march unmolested, so I sent on to 
inform him that I was in command, and gave him instructions 
.as to his march. I then returned by the Chain bridge road, 
having first given Sigel his orders ; and at a little house beyond 
Langley I found Porter, with whom I spent some time, and at 
length reached Washington at an early hour in the morning. 
Before the day broke the troops were all in position to repulse 
attack, and Washington was safe. 

* See note B. 

A. Note by the Editor. This order of Sept. 2, 1862, was the last order 
ever issued to Gen. McClellan giving him any command. He seems 
never to have known that it actually appeared in two forms within twenty- 
four hours, first as an order from the President by direction of the Secre- 
tary of War, second as a simple order of Gen. Halleck. The history of its 
origin and modification is obscure. The purposes of Secretary Stanton 
and Gen. Halleck in its issue and the change of its form must be left to 
conjecture, with what light can be thrown on it from the events of the time. 
When these events are seen in close relation every honest mind must be 
filled with amazement at the duplicity with which McClellan was sur- 
rounded. 

The War Department had occupied itself in giving out what Secretary 
Welles called "exaggerated rumors," but which were pure fabrications, 
designed to convince the public that McClellan had been the cause of 
Pope's defeat by delay in forwarding reinforcements. Mr. Stanton and 
Gen. Halleck had assumed the responsibility of recalling the Army of the 
Potomac from before Richmond, thus releasing the enemy to fall on Pope. 
Every military and common-sense consideration had been violated. The 
paramount purpose was to take the army away from McClellan, since they 
had been unable to persuade Mr. Lincoln to take McClellan from the 
army. McClellan had been ordered to return, for the purpose, as he was 
told, of taking the command of all the forces of Pope and his own troops 
^combined. 

Having ordered the withdrawal of the Army of the Potomac, Halleck 



HALLECK'S TESTIMONY. 539 

and Stanton had made the fearful error of not providing transportation for 
it, and, when aware of their blunder, threw the blame on McClellan. He 
arrived at Alexandria on the 26th Aug., under Halleck's direct command, 
who assumed the responsibility of everything, and declined to give Mc- 
Clellan any specific position. From day to day the country was informed, 
by telegrams inspired at the War Department, that McClellan was delay- 
ing the advance of troops to Pope. Meantime McClellan, doing his own 
work, was also doing Halleck's work for him as a pure volunteer, while 
the latter was in a hopeless condition of mind, semi-paralyzed. The work 
done by McClellan was herculean, in sending forward his own troops, 
in volunteer inspection and adjustment of the defences of Washington, 
in aiding and advising Halleck, who was powerless. The despatches in 
chapter xxx., which indicate all this, are but a small portion of McCk-1- 
lan's orders and despatches, during the five days after his arrival at Alex- 
andria, which he left as part of his memoirs. I have exercised the dis- 
cretion given me and reserved the remainder of these for future publica- 
tion, leaving here only such and so many as will outline what the general 
did from Aug. 26 to Aug. 31. If no one else saw, it is clear from Mr. 
Lincoln's despatches to McClellan, and his acts on Sept. 2, that he saw 
and knew what Halleck did not do, and what McClellan was doing, in 
those eventful days. 

Gen. Halleck had written to McClellan on the Peninsula, asking frank 
co-operation. McClellan had promised it heartily, and now gave it gal- 
lantly. Ignoring this, and seeking with others to throw on McClellan 
all the responsibilities of the five days, Gen. Halleck, testifying before the 
Committee on the Conduct of the War, stated that McClellan was placed 
in command of the fortifications of Washington and all the troops for its 
defence on the day he arrived at Alexandria, and that the order of Sept. 2 
was only the reduction to writing of that command. The following is 
Halleck's testimony: 

"On his [Gen. McClellan's] arrival at Alexandria he was told to take 
immediate command of all the troops in and about Washington, in addi- 
tion to those which properly belonged to the Army of the Potomac. Some 
days after he had been verbally directed to take such command he asked 
for a formal order, which was issued from the adjutant-general's office. 
The order issued from the adjutant-general's office was after Gen. Pope's 
army commenced falling back, and was dated Sept. 2, but Gen. McClellan 
had been in command ever since his arrival in Alexandria. He arrived at 
Alexandria on the 26th of Aug. The formal order was issued that he 
might have no difficulty with Gen. Pope's forces; that they might not 
question his authority." 

That this testimony of Gen. Halleck was distinctly false is now de- 
monstrated beyond any dispute by the publication of his own correspond- 
ence with McClellan during the period Aug. 26 to Aug. 31, and by other 
proofs. It is charity to Gen. Halleck to suppose that his mind and mem- 
ory were muddled by the fearful catastrophe he and Secretary Stanton 
had brought on the army and country, so that, when before the committee, 
he had forgotten the countless facts which prove his statement untrue. 
40 



540 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

From the 26th to the soth Aug. his despatches to McClellan recognized that 
officer as in command of his own Army of the Potomac. On the 24th 
McClellan, arrived at Acquia, had telegraphed him : " Until I know what 
my command and position are to be, and whether you still intend to place 
me in the command indicated in your first letter to me, and orally through 
Gen. Burnside at the Chickahominy, I cannot decide where I can be of 
most use. If your determination is unchanged I ought to go to Alex- 
andria at once. Please define my position and duties." Halleck made no 
reply to this ; and from what followed it is evident that he had no inten- 
tion of giving McClellan any command, it being his and Mr. Stanton's plan 
to order all of the Army of the Potomac, piece by piece, away from 
McClellan's command, and discharge him. 

On the 27th Halleck telegraphed McClellan : "Take entire direction 
of the sending out troops from Alexandria." 

On the same day McClellan telegraphed Halleck : " Please inform me 
at once what my position is. I do not wish to act in the dark." To this 
Halleck made no reply. 

On the 29th McClellan telegraphed both the President and Gen. Hal- 
leck : " Tell me what you wish me to do, and I will do all in my power 
to accomplish it. I wish to know what my orders and authority are. 
I ask for nothing, but will obey whatever orders you give. I only 
ask a prompt decision." To this he received no reply, except that 
the President, replying to another part of the same despatch, said: "I 
wish not to control. That I leave to Gen. Halleck, aided by your coun- 
sels." 

The unexplained and embarrassing position in which Halleck kept 
McClellan at this time is illustrated by many despatches which are omit- 
ted from the present volume. Thus, on the 2gth of Aug. Gen. S. Wil- 
liams, A. A. G. at McClellan's camp near Alexandria, telegraphed Brig.- 
Gen. James S. Wadsworth, military governor of Washington : " It is impor- 
tant that these headquarters should receive the countersign issued to the 
guards at the Long bridge. I was stopped late night before last, return- 
ing to camp, and compelled to go to your office foi the countersign. 
Lieut.-Col. Colburn, going to the city last night on important business 
requiring despatch, was stopped at this end of the bridge and had to go 
back to Fort Albany. On both occasions the officers of the guards, though 
aware of our positions, said they had no discretion." 

On the 30th, Assist. Adj.-Gen. Williams telegraphs Gen. Wadsworth : 
" In the absence of orders defining the limits of his command Gen. 
McClellan issues a countersign to-day to the troops of the Army of the 
Potomac in this vicinity. It is ' Malvern.' If yours is different he will be 
obliged to you to communicate it, and also to instruct the guards at the 
Long bridge to recognize ours. Do you know what command furnishes 
the guard for the Virginia end of the Long bridge?" 

A duplicate of the first part of this same despatch was sent the same 
day to Gen. John P. Slough, military governor of Alexandria, where Gen. 
McClellan's own headquarters then were. Obviously McClellan was not 



McCLELLAN'S COMMAND. 54 [ 

at this time " in command of all the troops in and about Washington,'' 
Gen. Halleck's testimony that he was notwithstanding. 

On the 3Oth Gen. McClellan telegraphed Gen. Barnard, who was in 
command of the military defences of Washington : "I have no more 
troops to give you, and, as I have no command nor any position, I shall 
not regard it as my duty to take any further steps in regard to the works." 

On the same day McClellan telegraphed Halleck : " You now have 
every man of the Army of the Potomac who is within my reach." This 
despatch announced to Gen. Halleck and Mr. Stanton the completion of 
their purpose in recalling the Army of the Potomac namely, to remove 
it from McClellan's command. Their response was' now prompt ; and 
McClellan received the first reply to his repeated requests to know what 
his position was, in these-words : "Gen. McClellan commands that por- 
tion of the Army of the Potomac that has not been sent forward to Gen. 
Pope's command." McClellan's command was thus reduced to less than 
a hundred men, many of whom were maimed or sick soldiers, around 
his tent at Alexandria. Secretary Stanton himself issued this order, 
which was, of course, intended to be insulting to McClellan, and which 
was received with much exultation in Washington by those who had de- 
sired McClellan's dismissal. At this moment it was believed in Wash- 
ington that Pope was victorious and McClellan finally crushed. Of course, 
when McClellan's command was thus denned by this order, in terms whose 
exactness was intended to be contemptuous, he was not in command of 
any fortifications or any troops for the defence of anything. 

On the night of the 3Oth McClellan made a vain appeal to Halleck to 
be allowed to go to the front and be with his troops in battle. 

On the afternoon of the 3ist, in reply to an order from Halleck, Mc- 
Clellan telegraphed him : " Under the War Department order of yesterday 
I have no control over anything except my staff, some one hundred men 
in my camp here, and the few remaining near Fort Monroe. I have no 
control over the new regiments. . . . Their commanding officers, and 
those of the works, are not under me." 

At ten P.M. of the 3ist Halleck replied to this : "I have not seen the 
order as published " (implying that he had seen it in Stanton's draft form), 
and adds: " You will retain command of everything in this vicinity not 
temporarily to be Pope's army in the field. I beg of you to assist me in 
this crisis with your ability and experience. I am entirely tired out." 

This indefinite despatch was the first hint of any order placing McClel- 
lan in command of the fortifications. On the same day McClellan had 
telegraphed to Gens. Wadsworth, Barnard, and Slough : " Gen. McClel- 
lan commands so few troops that he declines issuing a countersign, but 
he will be obliged if you will furnish him daily with yours, as he may 
have occasion to send to Washington during the night." 

At 10.25 P.M., on receipt of Halleck's despairing telegram, McClellan 
replied : " I am ready to afford you any assistance in my power, but you 
will readily perceive how difficult an undefined position such as I now 
hold must be. At what hour in the morning can I see you alone?" 



542 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

On the morning of Sept. i McClellan went up from Alexandria to 
Washington, and now Halleck verbally placed him in charge of the de- 
fences of Washington, but expressly forbade him to exercise any con- 
trol tover the troops of the Army of the Potomac or the Army of Vir- 
ginia. 

The untruthfulness of Gen. Halleck's testimony before the Committee 
on the Conduct of the War is thus demonstrated. He, and he alone, was in 
command and responsible from Aug. 26 to Sept. I. 

Gen. Halleck's verbal orders to Gen. McClellan on Sept. i gave the 
latter no control over the active army. Halleck was now encouraged about 
Pope, and discredited McClellan's bad news from the front. 

Pope had telegraphed that he had fought a terrific battle, which lasted 
from daylight to dark, ' by which time the enemy was driven from the field, 
which we now occupy." " The enemy is still in our front, but badly used 
up." "We have made great captures, but I am not able yet to form an 
idea of their extent." The urgency of McClellan, who discredited Pope's 
statements, alone induced Halleck to send Col. Kelton to the front for 
information. The return of that officer in the night of Sept. 1-2 revealed 
the truth, which brought terror to Washington. 

Without dwelling on the condition of alarm into which the War 
Department was now plunged, it is important to note that it continued 
certainly till Sept. 8, when Mr. Hiram Barney, Collector of the Port of 
New York, told Mr. Chase "that Stanton and Wadsworth had advised him 
to leave for New York this evening, as communication with Baltimore 
might be cut off before to-morrow" (Warden, p. 415). Secretary Welles 
says Stanton and Halleck were " filled with apprehensions beyond others." 
They gave up the capital as lost, and issued orders to empty the arsenal 
preparatory to the occupation of Washington by the enemy. 

Early in the morning of Sept. 2 the President, accompanied by Gen. 
Halleck, went to Gen. McClellan's house, and found him alone. They 
told him the capital was lost. The President asked him if " under the 
circumstances" (to wit. the recent treatment of Stanton and Halleck, and 
the insulting general order of Aug. 30) he would "resume command and 
do the best that could be done." The instant acceptance of this vast 
responsibility by McClellan puts at rest a falsehood published on the 
authority of Gen. Burnside, that McClellan proposed to make conditions, 
took time to consider, and finally only yielded to the persuasions of 
others in accepting the command. This story was a pure fabrication one 
of thousands which were directed against McClellan, and which a deluded 
public widely accepted as true. 

Gen. McClellan has contented himself with a brief account of this 
remarkable interview, in which Mr. Lincoln, with deep emotion, threw 
himself and the salvation of the capital and the Union on the general 
whom his subordinates had cajoled, slandered, deceived, and represent- 
ed to the people as disgraced. The terms of the trust reposed in him 
were unlimited. The simple words "resume command" were ample. 
Two honest minds were in contact, and each trusted the other. Mr. Lin- 



MR. LINCOLN'S TRUST. 543 

coin then intended to give to McClellan discretionary powers over military 
matters, and neither of them stopped to choose words. 

Gen. McClellan went swiftly to work. Gen. Halleck went to inform 
Secretary Stanton of the overthrow of their plans by the recall of McClel- 
lan to command. 

It may here be noted that Mr. Chase was in error when, on Sept. 19, 
he said (Warden, p. 480) that Halleck's telegram of Aug. 31, asking 
McClellan to help him, " announced Halleck's surrender to McClellan." 
While Mr. Chase was right enough in thus confessing the existence of a 
war against McClellan, he might well have spared his criticisms, since it 
will appear in the progress of McClellan's narrative that Halleck main- 
tained the war with much vigorous disregard of truth, to the end which 
was sought. The events of Sept. 2, which must be pursued, amply attest 
his position in the conflict, which now became more serious when the 
President appeared to stand firmly for McClellan. 

Hitherto no one has appreciated the state of mind of Mr. Lincoln at 
this appalling moment, when he realized the condition into which he and 
the country had been brought by the conspiracy of Mr. Stanton and his 
associate politicians against the army and its commander. Mr. Lincoln 
was a sagacious man. He knew thoroughly the character of the men who 
were around him ; had always known it. He had felt the importance of 
avoiding an open rupture with Congress, which was under the control of 
the extreme radical wing of the party. He had yielded much to this con- 
sideration. 

Now, when he heard from Mr. Stanton and Gen. Halleck that the 
capital was lost, and that they had issued orders for the abandonment of 
the arsenal and flight of the administration, he scouted their attempts to 
transfer their responsibility for the catastrophe to McClellan, and went at 
once to the general, with unbounded confidence in him. The quiet assur- 
ances he received from the man who had never deceived him relieved his 
apprehensions of the loss of the capital, and he went away better prepared 
to meet his cabinet, who were expecting the enemy around and in the city. 
He still shrank from an open rupture with Mr. Chase, Mr. Stanton, the 
majority of the Committee on the Conduct of the War, and Congress 
which had become subservient to their leadership. He had hitherto pre- 
vented a division of the party, which was always imminent. Doubtless 
his avowed principle of " not swapping horses while crossing a stream " 
influenced him to his present determination to go on with the same cabinet 
officers in council and the same general in command. 

But when he left McClellan, the simple, loyal soldier and servant of 
the people, he had to face men of a very different character. The cabinet 
meeting which now followed was in many respects the most remarkable 
ever held in Washington. Mr. Lincoln entered it knowing his men. He 
knew that Mr. Chase and Mr. Stanton were Presidential candidates, guid- 
ing, each in his own peculiar way, their official conduct and acts as his 
rivals for the next nomination. He was perfectly aware that in this criti- 
cal time they were ready to throw on him all the responsibility of the 



544 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

impending ruin, the loss of the capital, if that were to be, the end of the 
Union itself which might possibly follow. That they would seek to save 
their own reputations at any cost to his was a matter of course with such 
men. He had this advantage in meeting them, that McClellan's confi- 
dence had reassured him, while they were still in a state of wild alarm. 

Believing the loss of Washington and Maryland inevitable, and anti- 
cipating the judgment of the people of the North, they forgot all respect 
for their chief and became insolent in their treatment of him. Stanton 
reproached him with giving personal orders to McClellan, creating confu- 
sion, making neither Halleck nor McClellan responsible, and then dis- 
avowed any responsibility of the War Department for the position. Chase 
told him that any engineer officer would have done as well as the general 
he had selected, and boldly added that by placing McClellan in command 
he had given the capital to the enemy. 

It was plain that the two Presidential candidates in the cabinet had 
determined on their course to assure the country that Mr. Lincoln was 
alone responsible for the ruin they believed inevitable. 

The President retained his dignity and maintained at first a calm atti- 
tude. He had been accustomed for months to the nagging policy of the 
secretaries ; but it now became so personal and bitter that he was at last 
driven to the exclamation, never before or since uttered by a President of 
the United States, that he would gladly resign his high office. 

The history of this tempestuous cabinet meeting forms an important 
part of the history of the war, and throws strong light on the story of 
McClellan and the Army of the Potomac. 

In his private diary (Warden, p. 459) Mr. Chase thus describes it : 

" The Secretary of War came in. In answer to some inquiry the fact 
was stated by the President or the secretary that McClellan had been 
placed in command of the forces to defend the capital or rather, to use 
the President's own words, 'he had set him to putting these troops into 
the fortifications about Washington,' believing that he could do that thing 
better than any other man. 

" I remarked that this could be done equally well by the engineer who 
constructed the forts. . . . 

" The Secretary of War said that no one was now responsible for the 
defence of the capital ; that the order to McClellan was given by the 
President direct to McClellan, and that Gen. Halleck considered himself 
relieved from responsibility, although he acquiesced and approved the 
order ; that McClellan could now shield himself, should anything go 
wrong, under Halleck, while Halleck could and would disclaim all 
responsibility for the order given. 

"The President thought Gen. Halleck as much responsible as before, 
and repeated that the whole scope of the order was simply to direct 
McClellan to put the troops into the fortifications and command them for 
the defence of Washington. 

" I remarked . . . that I could not but feel that giving command to 
him was equivalent to giving Washington to the rebels. This and more I 
said. . . . 

"The President said it distressed him exceedingly to find himself 
differing on such a point from the Secretary of War and the Secretary of 
the Treasury; that he would gladly resign his place ; but that he could not 



THE CABINET MEETING. 545 

see who could do the work wanted as well as McClellan. I named 
Hooker, or Sumner, or Burnside, either of whom would do the work better." 

Mr. Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy, in his book, "Lincoln 
and Seward," New York, 1874, page 194, says : 

" At the stated cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the 2d of Sept , while the 
whole community was stirred up and in confusion, and affairs were grow- 
ing beyond anything that had previously occurred, Stanton entered the 
council-room a few moments in advance of Mr. Lincoln, and said, with 
great excitement, he had just learned from Gen. Halleck that the Presi- 
dent had placed McClellan in command of the forces in Washington. 
The information was surprising, and, in view of the prevailing excitement 
against that officer, alarming. The President soon came in, and, in answer 
t& an inquiry from Mr. Chase, confirmed what Stanton had stated. Gene- 
ral regret was expressed, and Stanton, with some feeling, remarked that 
no order to that effect had issued from the War Department. The Presi- 
dent, calmly but with some emphasis, said the order was his, and he 
would be responsible for it to the country. . . . Before separating the 
Secretary of the Treasury expressed his apprehension that the reinstate- 
ment of McClellan would prove a national calamity." 

Mr. Montgomery Blair, Postmaster-General, in private letters, from 
which, now in the hands of the editor, the following extracts are taken, 
says : 

Under date April 22, 1870: "The bitterness of Stanton on the rein- 
statement of McClellan you can scarcely conceive. He preferred to see 
the capital fall. . . . McClellan was bound to go when the emergency was 
past, and Halleck and Stanton- furnished a pretence." 

Under date April 3, 1879: "The folly and disregard of public inte- 
rests thus exhibited would be incredible but that the authors of this intrigue, 
Messrs. Stanton and Chase, when the result of it came, and I proposed the 
restoration of McClellan to command, and to prevent the completion of 
ruin by the fall of this capital, actually declared that they would prefer the 
loss of the capital to the restoration of McClellan to command. Yet these are 
the men who have been accounted by a large portion of our countrymen as 
the civil heroes of the war, whilst McClellan, who saved the capital, was 
dismissed. ..." 

Whatever changes of mind Mr. Lincoln subsequently underwent may 
with probability be attributed to the causes already indicated his personal 
confidence in McClellan on one hand, and his desire to avoid a rupture 
with the radical wing of his party on the other hand. His adherence at 
this moment to his adopted plan, in face of the violence of the secretaries, 
was a notable exhibition of firmness. 

Meantime McClellan, heedless of the renewed war in his rear, devoted 
his attention to the enemy in front. But when, acting on the trust imposed 
by the President, he was about to go out to meet the retreating army, Hal- 
leck stopped him with the information that the President had limited his 
command to the fortifications. Under all the circumstances we may take 
leave to doubt whether any such order came from the President. It was 



546 McCLELLAN 'S OWN STORY. 

contradictory to the spirit of the morning interview, and merciless to an 
army pursued by a victorious enemy. 

At some time during the early part of the day the order of Sept. 2 was 
prepared by Gen. Halleck and telegraphed throughout the country in the 
following form : 

" HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 

" ADJUTANT GENERAL'S OFFICE, 

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 1862. 

" By direction of the President, Maj.-Gen. McClellan will have com- 
mand of the fortifications of Washington and of all the troops for the 
defence of the capital. 

" By order of the Secretary of War. 

"E. D. TOWNSEND, 

"A. A. Gen" 

It will be remembered that Mr. Stanton had declared with " some 
feeling," as Mr. Welles puts it, that no such order had issued from the 
War Department. But this order had issued, as from the Secretary of 
War. 

Later in the day, and of course after Gen. Halleck's interview with 
Secretary Stanton, it reappeared in the form following : 

" WAR DEPARTMENT, 
" ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, 

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 2, 1862. 

"Maj.-Gen. McClellan will have command of the fortifications of 
Washington and of all the troops for the defence of the capital. 
" By order of Maj.-Gen. Halleck. 

"E. D. TOWNSEND, 

" A.A. Gen." 

The history of its origin and modification is certainly obscure. Little 
light is thrown on it by the following, which is an extract from an official 
letter from the adjutant-general's office, dated March i, 1886, and signed 
J. C. Kelton, Assist. Adj. -Gen. Col. Kelton was the officer on Gen. Hal- 
leck's staff who had brought the intelligence of the condition of Gen. 
Pope's command on the morning of Sept. 2. It is therefore clear that 
the first draft of the order was made that morning ; but whether before 
or after Gen. Halleck had consulted with Mr. Stanton does not appear. 
Col. Kelton says : 

" It appears from the records that a draft of General Order No. 122 
was written by Col. J. C. Kelton, then assistant adjutant-general, head- 
quarters of the army, Sept. 2, 1862, with request that Col. E. D. Townsend 
number and issue the same, and have it published in the Stat. The gene- 
ral order was prepared accordingly by Col. E. D. Townsend, Assist. Adj.- 
Gen., and, having been submitted to Gen. Halleck, was the same day 
returned by Col. Kelton to Col. Townsend, amended w it now stands." 

Whether McClellan, when he received Halleck's message forbidding 



RECEPTION BY THE ARMY. 547 

him to go beyond the fortifications, recognized an intent to interfere 
between him and the President's unlimited trust we cannot know. He 
obeyed the instruction. But when in the afternoon, at Upton's Hill, the 
farthest-out fortification, he met Pope and McDowell leading the retreat 
into Washington, and heard the sound of artillery-firing on the Army of 
the Potomac, abandoned to their fate without a commander, he left the 
fortifications and the orders of Gen. Halleck behind him, and crossed 
country to the sound of the enemy's cannon. 

From that time he acted on his own judgment, as seemed to him best 
for the country, and, "with the halter around his neck," led the army on 
the swiftest and most brilliant campaign in its history, to the victories of 
South Mountain and Antietam. 

The order of Sept. 2 remained in force thereafter. It perhaps 
explains some differences between the reports of officers in the field and 
those in Washington in regard to supplies, as all horses, ammunition, 
and supplies furnished to troops in and around Washington could pro- 
perly be charged and reported as furnished to McClellan's command. 

It is not probable that Mr. Lincoln's attention was ever called to the 
existence of this order. For it is a remarkable fact that, when he finally 
consented to displace McClellan, he gave the order that he "be relieved 
from the command of the Army of the Potomac " a command which 
Gen. McClellan had not held by any authority since Aug. 30. 

B. Capt. William H. Powell, of the 4th Regular Infantry, in a letter 
to the Century, dated Fort Omaha, Neb., March 12, 1885, thus describes 
this scene [Century, January, 1886, p. 473] : 

" About four o'clock on the next afternoon, from a prominent point, 
we descried in the distance the dome of the Capitol. We would be there at 
least in time to defend it. Darkness came upon us, and still we marched. 
As the night wore on we found at each halt that it was more and more 
difficult to arouse the men from the sleep they would fall into apparently 
as soon as they touched the ground. During one of these halts, while 
Col. Buchanan, the brigade commander, was resting a little off the road, 
some distance in advance of the head of the column, it being starlight, two 
horsemen came down the road towards us. I thought I observed a familiar 
form, and, turning to Col. Buchanan, said : 

" 'Colonel, if I did not know that Gen. McClellan had been relieved 
of all command, I should say that he was one of that party,' adding imme- 
diately, ' I do really believe it is he !' 

"'Nonsense !' said the colonel; ' what would Gen. McClellan be doing 
out in this lonely place, at this time of night, without an escort ?' 

"The two horsemen passed on to where the column of troops was 
lying, standing, or sitting, as pleased each individual, and were lost in the 
shadowy gloom. But a few moments had elapsed, however, when Capt. 
John D. Wilkins, of the 3d Infantry (now colonel of the 5th), came running 
towards Col. Buchanan, crying out : 

" ' Colonel ! Colonel ! Gen. McClellan is here ! ' 

" The enlisted men caught the sound Whoever was awake aroused 
his neighbor. Eyes were rubbed, and those tired fellows, as the news 
passed down the column, jumped to their feet and sent up such a hurrah 
as the Army of the Potomac had never heard before. Shout upon shout 



548 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



went out into the stillness of the night ; and, as it was taken up along 
the road and repeated by regiment, brigade, division, and corps, we could 
hear the roar dying aw;iy in the distance. The effect of this man's presence 
upon the Army of the Potomac in sunshine or rain, in darkness or in day- 
light, in victory or defeat was ever electrical, and too wonderful to make 
it worth while attempting to give a reason for it. Just two weeks from 
this time this defeated army, under the leadership of McClellan, won the 
battles of South Mountain and Antietam, and had to march ten days out of 
the two weeks in order to do it." 



CHAPTER XXXIII. 

Maryland invaded McClellan not to command in the field Halleck 
declines advice about Harper's Ferry The North in danger McClel- 
lan assumes command The halter around his neck McClellan unre- 
strained Marching, and reorganizing the army on the march Har- 
per's Ferry lost McClellan relieves it, but Miles surrenders Frank- 
lin'.s victory at Crampton's Gap. 

NEXT day I rode to the front of Alexandria, and was engaged 
in rectifying the positions of the troops and giving orders nec- 
essary to secure the issuing of the necessary supplies, etc. 

On the 3d the enemy had disappeared from the front of 
Washington, and the information which I received induced me 
to believe that he intended to cross the upper Potomac into 
Maryland. This materially changed the aspect of affairs and 
enlarged the sphere of operations ; for, in case of a crossing 
in force, an active campaign would be necessary to cover Balti- 
more, prevent the invasion of Pennsylvania, and clear Mary- 
land. 

I therefore, on the 3d, ordered the 2d and i2th corps to Ten- 
nallytown, and the Qth corps to a point on the Seventh street 
road near Washington, and sent such cavalry as was available to 
the fords near Poolesville, to watch and impede the enemy in any 
attempt to cross in that vicinity. 

As soon as this was done I reported the fact to Gen. Halleck, 
who asked what general I had placed in command of those three 
corps. I replied that I had made no such detail, as I should 
take command in person if the enemy appeared in that direction. 
He then said that my command included only the defences of 
Washington, and did not extend to any active column that might 
be moved out beyond the line of works ; that no decision had 
yet been made as to the commander of the active army. He 
repeated the same thing on more than one occasion before the 
final advance to South Mountain and Antietam took place. 

Before I went to the front Secretary Seward came to my

55O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

quarters one evening and asked my opinion of the condition of 
affairs at Harper's Ferry, remarking that he was not at ease on 
the subject. Harper's Ferry was not at that time in any sense 
under my control, but I told Mr. Seward that I regarded the 
arrangements there as exceedingly dangerous ; that in my opinion 
the proper course was to abandon the position and unite the gar- 
rison (ten thousand men, about) to the main army of operations, 
for the reason that its presence at Harper's Ferry would not hin- 
der the enemy from crossing the Potomac ; that if we were 
unsuccessful in the approaching battle Harper's Ferry would be 
of no use to us, and its garrison necessarily lost ; that if we were 
successful w r e would immediately recover the post without any 
difficulty, while the addition of 10,000 men to the active army 
would be an important factor in insuring success. I added 
that if it were determined to hold the position the existing 
arrangements were all wrong, as it w r ould be easy for the enemy 
to surround and capture the garrison, and that the garrison 
ought, at least, to be withdrawn to the Maryland Heights, where 
they could resist attack until relieved. 

The secretary was much impressed by what I said, and asked 
me to accompany him to Gen. Halleck and repeat my statement 
to him. I acquiesced, and we went together to Gen. Halleck's 
quarters, where we found that he had retired for the night. But 
he received us in his bed-room, when, after a preliminary expla- 
nation by the secretary as to the interview being at his request, I 
said to Halleck precisely what I had stated to Mr. Seward. 

Halleck received my statement with ill-concealed contempt ; 
said that everything was all right as it was ; that my views were 
entirely erroneous, etc., and ' soon bowed us out, leaving matters 
at Harper's Ferry precisely as they were. 

On Sept. 5 the 2d and i2th corps were moved to Rockville, 
and Couch's division (the only one of the 4th corps that had 
been brought from the Peninsula) to Offutt's cross-roads. 

On the 6th the ist and Qth corps were ordered to Leesburg ; 
the 6th corps and Sykes's division of the 5th corps to Tennally- 
town. 

On the 7th the 6th corps was advanced to Rockville, to 
which place my headquarters were moved on the same day. 

All the necessary arrangements for the defence of the city 
under the new condition of things had been made, and Gen. 



McCLELLAN ASSUMES COMMAND. 551 

Banks was left in command, having received his instructions 
from me. 

As the time had now arrived for the army to advance, and I 
had received no orders to take command of it, but had been 
expressly told that the assignment of a commander had not been 
decided, I determined to solve the question for myself, and when 
I moved out from Washington with my staff and personal escort 
I left my card, with P. P. C. written upon it, at the White House, 
War Office, and Secretary Seward's house, and went on my way. 

I was afterwards accused of assuming command without 
authority, for nefarious purposes, and, in fact, fought the bat- 
tles of South Mountain and Antietam with a halter around my 
neck ; for if the Army of the Potomac had been defeated and I 
had survived I would, no doubt, have been tried for assuming 
authority without orders, and, in the state of feeling which so 
unjustly condemned the innocent and most meritorious Gen. 
F. J. Porter, I would probably have been condemned to death. 
I was fully aware of the risk I ran, but the path of duty was 
clear and I tried to follow it. 

It was absolutely necessary that Lee's army should be met, 
and, in the state of affairs I have briefly described, there could 
be no hesitation on my part as to doing it promptly. 

Very few in the Army of the Potomac doubted the favorable 
result of the next collision with the Confederate army, but in 
other quarters not a little doubt prevailed, and the desire for 
very rapid movements, so loudly expressed after the result was 
gained, did not make itself heard during the movements preced- 
ing the battles ; quite the contrary was the case, as I was more 
than once cautioned that I was moving too rashly and exposing 
the capital to an attack from the Virginia side. 

As is well known, the result of Gen. Pope's operations had 
not been favorable, and when I finally resumed command of the 
troops in and around Washington they were weary, disheartened, 
their organization impaired, their clothing, ammunition, and sup- 
plies in a pitiable condition. 

The Army of the Potom'ac was thoroughly exhausted and 
depleted by its desperate fighting and severe marches in the 
unhealthy regions of the Chickahominy and afterwards during 
the second Bull Run campaign. Its trains, administration ser- 
vices, and supplies were disorganized or lacking, in consequence 



552 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

of the rapidity and manner of its removal from the Peninsula, 
as well as from the nature of its operations during the second 
Bull Run campaign. In the departure from the Peninsula, 
trains, supplies, cavalry, and artillery were often necessarily left 
at Fort Monroe and Yorktown for lack of vessels, as the impor- 
tant point was to move the infantry divisions as rapidly as possi- 
ble to the support of Gen. Pope. The divisions of the Army of 
Virginia were also exhausted and weakened, and their trains and 
supplies disorganized and deficient by the movements in which 
they had been engaged.* 

Had Gen. Lee remained in front of Washington it would have 
been the part of wisdom to hold our own army quiet until its 
pressing wants were fully supplied, its organization restored, and 
its ranks filled with recruits in brief, prepared for a campaign. 
But as the enemy maintained the offensive and crossed the upper 
Potomac to threaten or invade Pennsylvania, it became necessary 
to meet him at any cost, notwithstanding the condition of the 
troops ; to put a stop to the invasion, save Baltimore and Wash- 
ington, and throw him back across the Potomac. 

Nothing but sheer necessity justified the advance of the Army 
of the Potomac to South Mountain and Antietam in its then con- 
dition, and it is to the eternal honor of the brave men who com- 
posed it that under such adverse circumstances they gained those 
victories ; for the work of supply and reorganization was continued 

* The " Army of Virginia," which had been under the command of 
Gen. Pope, ceased to exist on the 2d of Sept., 1862, by force of circum- 
stances, and, so far as appears, without any order issued. The following 
correspondence is the only known record : 

" ARLINGTON. Sept. 5, 12.05 P-M. 
" Maj.-Gen. Halleck, G.n. -in-Chief : 

" I have just received an order from Gen. McClellan to have my com- 
mand in readiness to march with three days' rations, and further details of 
the march. What is my command, and where is it? McClellan has scat- 
tered it about in all directions, and has not informed me of the position of 
a single regiment. Am I to take the field, and under McClellan's orders? 

" JNO. POPE, 



"WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 5, 1862. 
' ' Maj. - Gen . Pope, A rlington : 

" The armies of the Potomac and Virginia being consolidated, you 
will report. for orders to the Secretary of War. 

" H. W. HALLECK, 

" Gen. -in- Chief." 



MARYLAND CAMPAIGN. 553 

as best we might while on the march, and after the close of the 
battles so much remained to be done to place the army in condi- 
tion for a campaign that the delay which ensued was absolutely 
unavoidable, and the army could not have entered upon a new 
campaign one day earlier than it did. 

The purpose of advancing from Washington was simply to 
meet the necessities of the moment by frustrating Lee's invasion 
of the Northern States, and, when that was accomplished, to push 
with the utmost rapidity the work of reorganization and supply, 
so that a new campaign might be promptly inaugurated with the 
army in condition to prosecute it to a successful termination with- 
out intermission. 

The advance from Washington was covered by the cavalry, 
under Gen. Pleasonton, pushed as far to the front as possible, 
and soon in constant contact with the enemy's cavalry, with 
whom several well-conducted and successful affairs occurred. 

Partly in order to move men freely and rapidly, partly in 
consequence of the lack of accurate information as to the exact 
position and intention of Lee's army, the troops advanced by 
three main roads : that near the Potomac by Offutt's cross- 
roads and the mouth of the Seneca, that by Rockville to Frede- 
rick, and that by Brookeville and Urbana to New Market. We 
were then in condition to act according to the development of 
the enemy's plans, and to concentrate rapidly in any position. If 
Lee threatened our left flank by moving down the river road or 
by crossing the Potomac at any of the forks from Coon's Ferry 
upward, there were enough troops on the river road to hold him 
in check until the rest of the army could move over to support 
them ; if Lee took up a position behind the Seneca near Frede- 
rick, the whole army could be rapidly concentrated in that direc- 
tion to attack him in force; if he moved upon Baltimore the 
entire army could rapidly be thrown in his rear and his retreat 
cut off ; if he moved by Gettysburg or Chambersburg upon York 
or Carlisle we were equally in position to throw ourselves in his 
rear. 

The first thing was to gain accurate information as to Lee's 
movements, and meanwhile to push the work of supply and 
reorganization as rapidly as possible. 

Gen. Lee and I knew each other well in the days before the 
war. We had served together in Mexico and commanded against 



554 McCLELLAN^ S OWN STORY. 

each other in the Peninsula. I had the highest respect for his 
ability as a commander, and knew that he was not a general to 
be trifled with or carelessly afforded an opportunity of striking a 
fatal blow. Each of us naturally regarded his own army as the 
better, but each entertained the highest respect for the endur- 
ance, courage, and fighting qualities of the opposing army ; and 
this feeling extended to the officers and men. It was perfectly 
natural under these circumstances that both of us should exer- 
cise a certain amount of caution : I in my endeavors to ascertain 
Lee's strength, position, and intentions before I struck the final 
blow ; he to abstain from any extended movements of invasion, 
and to hold his army well in hand until he could be satisfied 
as to the condition of the Army of the Potomac after its second 
Bull Run campaign, and as to the intentions of its commander. 

The right wing, consisting of the ist and 9th corps, under the 
command of Maj.-Gen. Burnside, moved on Frederick ; the ist 
corps via Brookeville, Cooksville, and Ridgeville, and the Qth 
corps via Damascus and New Market. 

The 2d and i2th corps, forming the centre, under the com- 
mand of Gen. Sumner, moved on Frederick ; the former via 
Clarksburg and Urbana, the i2th corps on a lateral road between 
Urbana and New Market, thus maintaining the communication 
with the right wing and covering the direct road from Frederick 
to Washington. The 6th corps, under the command of Gen. 
Franklin, moved to Buckeystown via Darnestown, Dawsonville, 
and Barnesville, covering the road from the mouth of the Mono- 
cacy to Rockville, and being in a position to connect with and 
support the centre, should it have been necessary (as was sup- 
posed) to force the line of the Monocacy. 

Couch's division moved by the river road, covering that 
approach, watching the fords of the Potomac, and ultimately 
following and supporting the 6th corps. 

The following extracts from telegrams received by me after 
my departure from Washington will show how little was known 
there about the enemy's movements, and the fears which were 
entertained for the safety of the capital. On the gth of Sept. 
Gen. Halleck telegraphed me as follows : 

" Until we can get better advices about the numbers of the 
enemy at Dranesville, I think we must be very cautious about 



HALLECK ANXIOUS. 



555 



stripping too much the forts on the Virginia side. It may be 
the enemy's object to draw off the mass of our forces and then 
attempt to attack from the Virginia side of the Potomac. Think 
of this." 

Again, on the nth of Sept., Gen. Halleck telegraphed me as 
follows : 

" Why not order forward Keyes or Sigel ? I think the main 
force of the enemy is in your front. More troops can be spared 
from here." 

This despatch, as published by the Committee on the Con- 
duct of the War, and furnished by the general-in-chief, reads as 
follows : 

" Why not order forward Porter's corps or Sigel's ? If the 
main force of the enemy is in your front, more troops can be 
spared from here." 

I remark that the original despatch, as received by me from 
the telegraph operator, is in the words quoted above : " / think 
the main force of the enemy" etc. 

In accordance with this suggestion I asked, on the same day, 
that all the troops that could be spared should at once be sent to 
reinforce me ; but none came. 

On the 1 2th I received the following telegram from his Excel- 
lency the President : " Governor Curtin telegraphs me : ' I have 
advices that Jackson is crossing the Potomac at Williamsport, 
and probably the whole rebel army will be drawn from Mary- 
land.' " The President adds : " Receiving nothing from Har- 
per's Ferry or Martinsburg to-day, and positive information from 
Wheeling that the line is cut, corroborates the idea that the 
enemy is recrossing the Potomac. Please do not let him get off 
without being hurt." 

On the 1 3th Gen. Halleck telegraphed as follows : " Until you 
know more certainly the enemy's force south of the Potomac you 
are wrong in thus uncovering the capital. I am of the opinion 
that the enemy will send a small column towards Pennsylvania 
to draw your forces in that direction, then suddenly move on 
Washington with the forces south of the Potomac and those he 
may cross over." Again, on the i4th, Gen. Halleck telegraphed 
41 



55^ McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

me that " scouts report a large force still on the Virginia side of 
the Potomac. If so I fear you are exposing your left and rear." 
Again, as late as the i6th, after we had the most positive evi- 
dence that Lee's entire army was in front of us, I received the 
following from him : 

" Yours of seven A.M. is this moment received. As you give 
me no information in regard to the position of your forces, 
except that at Sharpsburg, of course I cannot advise. I think, 
however, you will find that the whole force of the enemy in your 
front has crossed the river. I fear now more than ever that they 
will recross at Harper's Ferry or below, and turn your left, thus 
cutting you off from Washington. This has appeared to me to 
be a part of their plan, and hence my anxiety on the subject. 
A heavy rain might prevent it." 

The importance of moving with all due caution, so as not to 
uncover the national capital until the enemy's position and plans 
were developed, was, I believe, fully appreciated by me ; and as 
my troops extended from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to 
the Potomac, with the extreme left flank moving along that 
stream, and with strong pickets left in rear to watch and guard 
all the available fords, I did not regard my left or rear as in 
any degree exposed. But it appears from the foregoing tele- 
grams that the general-in-chief was of a different opinion, and 
that my movements were, in his judgment, too precipitate, not 
only for the safety of Washington, but also for the security of 
my left and rear. 

The precise nature of these daily injunctions against a pre- 
cipitate advance may now be perceived. The general-in-chief, 
in his testimony before the Committee on the Conduct of the 
War, says : 

" In respect to Gen. McClellan going too fast, or too far from 
Washington, there can be found no such telegram from me to 
him. He has mistaken the meaning of the telegrams I sent 
him. I telegraphed him that he was going too far, not from 
Washington, but from the Potomac, leaving Gen. Lee the oppor- 
tunity to come down the Potomac and get between him and 
Washington. I thought Gen. McClellan should keep more on 
the Potomac, and press forward his left rather than his right, so 
as the more readily to relieve Harper's Ferry." 

As I can find no telegram from the general-in-chief recom- 



MARYLAND CAMPAIGN. 557 

mending me to keep my left flank nearer the Potomac, I am 
compelled to believe that when he gave this testimony he had 
forgotten the purport of the telegrams above quoted, and had 
also ceased to remember the fact, well known to him at the time, 
that my left, from the time I left Washington, always rested on 
the Potomac, and that my centre was continually in position to 
reinforce the left or right, as occasion might require. Had I 
advanced my left flank along the Potomac more rapidly than the 
other columns marched upon the roads to the right, I should 
have thrown that flank out of supporting distance of the other 
troops and greatly exposed it ; and if I had marched the entire 
army in one column along the banks of the river, instead of 
upon five different parallel roads, the column, with its trains, 
would have extended about fifty miles, and the enemy might 
have defeated the advance before the rear could have reached 
the scene of action. Moreover, such a movement would have 
uncovered the communications with Baltimore and Washington 
on our right, and exposed our left and rear. 

I presume it will be admitted by every military man that it 
was necessary to move the army in such order that it could at 
any time be concentrated for battle, and I am of opinion that 
this object could not have been accomplished in any other way 
than the one employed. Any other disposition of our forces 
would have subjected them to defeat in detached fragments. 

On the loth of Sept. I received from my scouts information 
which rendered it quite probable that Gen. Lee's army was in 
the vicinity of Frederick, but whether his intention was to move 
towards Baltimore or Pennsylvania was not then known. 

On the nth I ordered Gen. Burnside to push a strong recon- 
noissance across the National Road and the Baltimore and Ohio 
Railroad towards New Market, and, if he learned that the enemy 
had moved towards Hagerstown, to press on rapidly to Frederick, 
keeping his troops constantly ready to meet the enemy in force. 
A corresponding movement of all the troops in the centre and 
on the left was ordered in the direction of Urbana and Pooles- 
ville. 

On the 1 2th a portion of the right wing entered Frederick, 
after a brisk skirmish at the outskirts of the city and in the 
streets. On the i3th the main bodies of the right wing and 
centre passed through Frederick. 



558 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

In the report of a military commission, of which Maj.-Gen. 
D. Hunter was president, which convened at Washington for 
the purpose of investigating the conduct of certain officers in 
connection with the surrender of Harper's Ferry, I find the 
following : 

" The commission has remarked freely on Col. Miles, an old 
officer, who has been killed in the service of his country, and 
it cannot, from any motives of delicacy, refrain from censuring 
those in high command when it thinks such censure deserved. 

" The general-in-chief has testified that Gen. McClellan, after 
having received orders to repel the enemy invading the State of 
Maryland, marched only six miles per day, on an average, when 
pursuing this invading enemy. 

" The general-in-chief also testifies that, in his opinion, he 
could and should have relieved and protected Harper's Ferry ; 
and in this opinion the commission fully concur." 

This commission, in its investigations, never called upon me, 
nor upon any officer of my staff, nor, so far as I know, upon any 
officer of the Army of the Potomac able to give an intelligent 
statement of the movements of that army. But another para- 
graph in the same report makes testimony from such sources 
quite superfluous. It is as follows : 

" By a reference to the evidence it will be seen that at the 
very moment Col. Ford abandoned Maryland Heights his little 
army was in reality relieved by Gens. Franklin's and Sumner's 
corps at Crampton's Gap, within seven miles of his position." 

The corps of Gens. Franklin and Sumner were a part of the 
army which I at that time had the honor to command, and they 
were acting under my orders at Crampton's Gap and elsewhere ; 
and if, as the commission states, Col. Ford's " little army was in 
reality relieved " by those officers, it was relieved by me. 

I had, on the morning of the loth, sent the following despatch 
in relation to the command at Harper's Ferry to Gen. Halleck : 

Sept. 10, 9.45 A.M. Col. Miles is at or near Harper's Ferry, as 
I understand, with 9,000 troops. He can do nothing where he 
is, but could be of great service if ordered to join me. I suggest 
that he be ordered to join me by the most practicable route. 

To this I received the following reply from Gen. Halleck : 






HARPER'S FERRY. 



559 



"There is no way for Col. Miles to join you at present ; his 
only chance is to defend his works till you can open communica- 
tion with him." 



It seems necessary, for a distinct understanding of this mat- 
ter, to state that I was directed on the i2th to assume com- 
mand of the garrison of Harper's Ferry as soon as I should open 
communications with that place, and that when I received this 
order all communication from the direction in which I was 
approaching was cut off. Up to that time, however, Col. Miles 
could, in my opinion, have marched his command into Pennsyl- 
vania by crossing the Potomac at Williamsport or above ; and 
this opinion was confirmed by the fact that Col. Davis marched 
the cavalry part of Col. Miles's command from Harper's Ferry 
on the 1 4th, taking the main road to Hagerstown, and he en- 
countered no enemy except a small picket near the mouth of 
the Antietam. 

Before I left Washington, and when there certainly could 
have been no enemy to prevent the withdrawal of the forces of 
Col. Miles, I recommended to the proper authorities that the 
garrison of Harper's Ferry should be withdrawn via Hagers- 
town, to aid in covering the Cumberland valley ; or that, taking 
up the pontoon bridge and obstructing the railroad bridge, it 
should fall back to the Maryland Heights and there hold out 
to the last. 

In this position it ought to have maintained itself for many 
days. It was not deemed proper to adopt either of these sug- 
gestions ; and when the matter was left to my discretion it was 
too late for me to do anything but endeavor to relieve the gar- 
rison. I accordingly directed artillery to be fired by our advance 
at frequent intervals as a signal that relief was at hand. This 
was done, and, as I afterwards learned, the reports of the cannon 
were distinctly heard at Harper's Ferry. It was confidently 
expected that Col. Miles would hold out until we had carried 
the mountain-passes and were in condition to send a detachment 
to his relief. The left was therefore ordered to move through 
Crampton's Pass in front of Burkittsville, while the centre and 
right marched upon Turner's Pass in front of Middletown. 

It may be asked, by those who are not acquainted with the 
topography of the country in the vicinity of Harper's Ferry, why 



560 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Franklin, instead of marching his column over the circuitous 
road from Jefferson via Burkittsville and Brownsville, was not 
ordered to move along the direct turnpike to Knoxville, and 
thence up the river to Harper's Ferry. 

It was for the reason that I had received information that 
the enemy were anticipating our approach in that direction, 
and had established batteries on the south side of the Potomac 
which commanded all the approaches to Knoxville. Moreover, 
the road from that point winds directly along the river-bank at 
the foot of a precipitous mountain, where there was no oppor- 
tunity of forming in line of battle, and where the enemy could 
have placed batteries on both sides of the river to enfilade our 
narrow approaching columns. 

The approach through Crampton's Pass, which debouches 
into Pleasant Valley in rear of Maryland Heights, was the only 
one which afforded any reasonable prospect of carrying that for- 
midable position ; at the same time the troops upon that road 
were in better relation to the main body of our forces. 

On the morning of the i4th a verbal message reached me 
from Col. Miles, which was the first authentic intelligence I had 
received as to the condition of things at Harper's Ferry. The 
messenger informed me that on the preceding afternoon Mary- 
land Heights had been abandoned by our troops after repelling 
an attack of the rebels, and that Col. Miles's entire force was 
concentrated at Harper's Ferry, the Maryland, Loudon, and 
Bolivar Heights having been abandoned by him and occupied 
by the enemy. The messenger also stated that there was no 
apparent reason for the abandonment of the Maryland Heights, 
and that Col. Miles instructed him to say that he could hold out 
with certainty two days longer. 

I directed him to make his way back, if possible, with the 
information that I was approaching rapidly and felt confident I 
could relieve the place. 

On the same afternoon I wrote the following letter to Col. 
Miles, and despatched three copies by three different couriers on 
different routes. I did not, however, learn that any of these 
men succeeded in reaching Harper's Ferry : 

MlDDLETOWN, Sept. 14, 1862. 

COLONEL : The army is being rapidly concentrated here. 



FRANKLIN'S ADVANCE. 561 

We are now attacking the pass on the Hagerstown road over the 
Blue Ridge. A column is about attacking the Burkittsville and 
Boonsborough Pass. You may count on our making every effort 
to relieve you. You may rely upon my speedily accomplishing 
that object. Hold out to the last extremity. If it is possible, 
reoccupy the Maryland Heights with your whole force. If you 
can do that I will certainly be able to relieve you. As the 
Catoctin valley is in our possession, you can safely cross the 
river at Berlin or its vicinity, so far as opposition on this side of 
the river is concerned. Hold out to the last. 

GEORGE B. MCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 
Col. D. S. MILES. 

On the previous day I had sent Gen. Franklin the following 
instructions : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
CAMP NEAR FREDERICK, Sept. 13, 1862, 6.20 P.M. 
GENERAL : I have now full information as to movements and 
intentions of the enemy. Jackson has crossed the upper Poto- 
mac to capture the garrison at Martinsburg and cut off Miles's 
retreat towards the west. A division on the south side of the 
Potomac was to carry Loudon Heights and cut off his retreat in 
that direction. McLaws, with his own command and the division 
of R. H. Anderson, was to move by Boonsborough and Rohrers- 
ville to carry the Maryland Heights. The signal officers inform 
me that he is now in Pleasant Valley. The firing shows that 
Miles still holds out. Longstreet was to move to Boonsborough, 
and there halt with the reserve corps ; D. H. Hill to form the 
rear-guard ; Stuart's cavalry to bring up stragglers, etc. We 
have cleared out all the cavalry this side of the mountains and 
north of us. The last I heard from Pleasonton he occupied 
Middletown, after several sharp skirmishes. A division of Burn- 
side's command started several hours ago to support him. The 
whole of Burnside's command, including Hooker's corps, march 
this evening and early to-morrow morning, followed by the corps 
of Sumner and Banks, and Sykes's division, upon Boonsborough 
to carry that position. Couch has been ordered to concentrate 
his division and join you as rapidly as possible. Without wait- 
ing for the whole of that division to join, you will move at 
daybreak in the morning by Jefferson and Burkittsville upon the 
road to Rohrersville. I have reliable information that the moun- 
tain-pass by this road is practicable for artillery and wagons. If 
this pass is not occupied by the enemy in force, seize it as soon 
as practicable, and debouch upon Rohrersville in order to cut off 
the retreat of or destroy McLaws's command. If you find this 



562 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

pass held by the enemy in large force, make all your dispositions 
for the attack and commence it about half an hour after you 
hear severe firing at the pass on the Hagerstown pike, where the 
main body will attack. Having gained the pass, your duty will 
be first to cut off, destroy, or capture McLaws's command and 
relieve Col. Miles. If you effect this you will order him to join 
you at once with all his disposable troops, first destroying the 
bridges over the Potomac, if not already done ; and, leaving a 
sufficient garrison to prevent the enemy from passing the ford, 
you will then return by Rohrersville on the direct road to Boons- 
borough, if the main column has not succeeded in its attack. If 
it has succeeded, take the road to Rohrersville, to Sharpsburg 
and Williamsport, in order either to cut off the retreat of Hill 
and Longstreet towards the Potomac, or prevent the repassage 
of Jackson. My general idea is to cut the enemy in two and beat 
him in detail. I believe I have sufficiently explained my inten- 
tions. I ask of you, at this important moment, all your intellect 
and the utmost activity that a general can exercise. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 
Maj.-Gen. W. B. FRANKLIN, 

Commanding 6th Corps. 

Again, on the i4th, I sent him the following : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

FREDERICK, Sept. 14, 1862, 2 P.M. 

Your despatch of 12.30 just received. Send back to hurry up 
Couch. Mass your troops and carry Burkittsville at any cost. 
We shall have strong opposition at both passes. As fast as the 
troops come up I will hold a reserve in readiness to support you. 
If you find the enemy in very great force at any of these passes 
let me know at once, and amuse them as best you can so as to 
retain them there. In that event I will probably throw the mass 
of the army on the pass in front of here. If I carry that it will 
clear the way for you, and you must follow the enemy as rapidly 
as possible. 

GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj. - Gen. Commanding. 
Maj.-Gen. FRANKLIN. 

Gen. Franklin pushed his corps rapidly forward towards 
Crampton's Pass, and at about twelve o'clock on the i4th ar- 
rived at Burkittsville, immediately in rear of which he found the 
enemy's infantry posted in force on both sides of the road, with 
artillery in strong positions to defend the approaches to the 



CRAMPTON'S GAP. 563 

pass. Slocum's division was formed upon the right of the road 
leading through the gap, and Smith's upon the left. A line 
formed of Bartlett's and Torbert's brigades, supported by New- 
ton, whose activity was conspicuous, advanced steadily upon the 
enemy at a charge on the right. The enemy were driven from 
their position at the base of the mountain, where they were pro- 
tected by a stone wall, steadily forced back up the slope until 
they reached the position of their battery on the road, well up 
the mountain. There they made a stand. They were, however, 
driven back, retiring their artillery in echelon, until, after an 
action of three hours, the crest was gained, and the enemy has- 
tily fled down the mountain on the other side. 

On the left of the road Brooks's and Irvin's brigades, of 
Smith's division, formed for the protection of Slocum's flank, 
charged up the mountain in the same steady manner, driving 
the enemy before them until the crest was carried. 400 prison- 
ers from seventeen different organizations, 700 stand of arms, i 
piece of artillery, and 3 colors were captured by our troops in 
this brilliant action. It was conducted by Gen. Franklin in all 
its details. These details are given in a report of Gen. Frank- 
lin, and due credit awarded to the gallant officers and men en- 
gaged. 

The loss in Gen. Franklin's corps was 115 killed, 416 wound- 
ed, and 2 missing. The enemy's loss was about the same. The 
enemy's position was such that our artillery could not be used 
with any effect. r The close of the action found Gen. Franklin's 
advance in Pleasant Valley on the night of the i4th, within three 
and a half miles of the point on Maryland Heights where he 
might, on the same night or on the morning of the i5th, have 
formed a junction with the garrison of Harper's Ferry had it not 
been previously withdrawn from Maryland Heights, and within 
six miles of Harper's Ferry. 

On the night of the i4th the following despatch was sent to 
Gen. Franklin : 

BOLIVAR, Sept. 15, i A.M. 
GENERAL : 

The commanding general directs that you occupy with your 
command the road from Rohrersville to Harper's Ferry, placing 
a sufficient force at Rohrersville to hold that position in case it 



564 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

should be attacked by the enemy from Boonsborough. Endeavor 
to open communication with Col. Miles at Harper's Ferry, at- 
tacking and destroying such of the enemy as you may find in 
Pleasant Valley. Should you succeed in opening communica- 
tion with Col. Miles, direct him to join you with his whole com- 
mand, with all the guns and public property he can carry -with 
him. The remainder of the guns will be spiked or destroyed ; 
the rest of the public property will also be destroyed. You will 
then proceed to Boonsborough which place the commanding 
general intends to attack to-morrow and join the main body of 
the army at that place. Should you find, however, that the ene- 
my has retreated from Boonsborough towards Sharpsburg, you 
will endeavor to fall upon him and cut off his retreat. 

By command of Maj.-Gen. McClellan. 

GEO. D. RUGGLES, 

Col. and A, D. C. 

Gen. FRANKLIN. 

On the 1 5th the following were received from Gen. Franklin: 

"AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN IN PLEASANT VALLEY, 
" THREE MILES FROM ROHRERSVILLE, 

" Sept. 15, 8.50 A.M. 

" GENERAL : My command started at daylight this morning, 
and I am waiting to have it closed up here. Gen. Couch arrived 
about ten o'clock last night. I have ordered one of his brigades 
and one battery to Rohrersville, or to the strongest point in its 
vicinity. The enemy is drawn up in line of battle about two 
miles to our front one brigade in sight. As soon as I am sure 
that Rohrersville is occupied I shall move forward to attack the 
enemy. This may be two hours from now. If Harper's Ferry 
is fallen and the cessation of firing makes me fear that it has 
it is my opinion that I should be strongly reinforced. 

"W. B. FRANKLIN, 
"Maj.-Gen. Commanding 6th Corps. 
" Gen. G. B. MCCLELLAN. 

" SEPT. 15, ii A.M. 

" GENERAL : I have received your despatch by Capt. O'Keefe. 
The enemy is in large force in my front, in two lines of battle 
stretching across the valley, and a large column of artillery and 
infantry on the right of the valley looking towards Harper's 
Ferry. They outnumber me two to one. It of course will not 
answer to pursue the enemy under these circumstances. I shall 
communicate with Burnside as soon as possible. In the mean- 
time I shall wait here until I learn what is the prospect of rein-

I see in front. I have had a very close view of it, and its posi- 
tion is very strong. 

" Respectfully, 

"W. B. FRANKLIN, 

"Maj.-Gen. 
" Maj.-Gen. G. B. MCLELLAN, 

" Commanding" 

Col. Miles surrendered Harper's Ferry at eight A.M. on the 
1 5th, as the cessation of the firing indicated, and Gen. Franklin 
was ordered to remain where he was, to watch the large force in 
front of him and protect our left and rear, until the night of 
the 1 6th, when he was ordered to join the main body of the 
army at Keedysville, after sending Couch's division to Maryland 
Heights. 

While the events which have just been described were taking 
place at Crampton's Gap, the troops of the centre and right wing, 
which had united at Frederick on the i3th, were engaged in the 
contest for the possession of Turner's Gap. 



CHAPTER XXXIV. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[Sept. 2 to Sept. 14, 1862.] 

Sept. 2, 12.30 P.M. I was surprised this morning, when at 
breakfast, by a visit from the President and Halleck, in which 
the former expressed the opinion that the troubles now impend- 
ing could be overcome better by me than any one else. Pope 
is ordered to fall back upon Washington, and, as he re-enters, 
everything is to come under my command again ! A terrible 
and thankless task. Yet I will do my best, with God's blessing, 
to perform it. God knows that I need His help. I am too busy 
to write any more now. Pray that God will help me in the great 
task now imposed upon me. I assume it reluctantly, with a full 
knowledge of all its difficulties and of the immensity of the 
responsibility. I only consent to take it for my country's sake 
and with the humble hope that God has called me to it ; how 
I pray that He may support me ! . . . Don't be worried ; my 
conscience is clear, and I trust in God. 

Sept. 3, 11.30 A.M. ... I am now about to jump into the 
saddle, and will be off all day. I did not return from my ride 
last night until after midnight. I went out to meet the troops 
and place them in position. Colburn and I rode out several 
miles to the front. All is quiet to-day, and I think the capital 
is safe. Just as I was starting off yesterday to gather up the 
army, supposing that I would find it savagely followed up by 
the rebels, and that I might have dangerous work before me, 
I commenced the enclosed scrawl on a scrap of paper as a 
good-by ; could not even finish it. It may amuse you now that 
the danger is over : 

" Enclosure Sept. 2, 4 P.M. ... I am just about starting 
out to pick up the Army of the Potomac. Don't know whether 
I will get back, but can't resist saying one last word to you 

before I start. . . ." 

see 






PRIVATE LETTERS. 567 

Sept. 5,11 A.M. . . . Again I have been called upon to save 
the country. The case is desperate, but with God's help I will 
try unselfishly to do my best, and, if He wills it, accomplish the 
salvation of the nation. My men are true and will stand by 
me till the last. I still hope for success, and will leave nothing 
undone to gain it. ... How weary I am of this struggle against 
adversity! But one thing sustains me that is, my trust in God. 
I know that the interests at stake are so great as to justify His 
interference ; not for me, but for the innocent thousands, mil- 
lions rather, who have been plunged in misery by no fault of 
theirs. It is probable that our communications will be cut off 
in a day or two, but don't be worried. You may rest assured 
that I am doing all I can for my country, and that no shame 
shall rest upon you, wilfully brought upon you by me. . . . My 
hands are full, so is my heart. . . . 

Sept. 5, 4 P.M. ... It makes my heart bleed to see the 
poor, shattered remnants of my noble Army of the Potomac, 
poor fellows ! and to see how they love me even now. I hear 
them calling out to me as I ride among them, " George, don't 
leave us again ! " " They sha'n't take you away from us again," 
etc., etc. I can hardly restrain myself when I see how fear- 
fully they are reduced in numbers, and realize how many of 
them lie unburied on the field of battle, where their lives were 
uselessly sacrificed. It is the most terrible trial I ever experi- 
enced. Truly, God is trying me in the fire. . . . 

Telegram Washington, Sept. 7, 2.50 P.M. We are all well 
and the entire army is now united, cheerful, and confident. 
You need not fear the result, for I believe that God will give us 
the victory. I leave here this afternoon to take command of the 
troops in the field. The feeling of the government towards me, I 
am sure, is kind and trusting. I hope, with God's blessing, to 
justify the great confidence they now. repose in me, and will bury 
the past in oblivion. A victory now and we will soon be to- 
gether. I send short letter to-day. God bless and reward your 
trust in Him, and all will be well. 

Sept. 7, 2.30 P.M., Sunday. ... I leave in a couple of hours 
to take command of the army in the field. I shall go to Rock- 



568 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

ville to-night and start out after the rebels to-morrow. I shall 
have nearly 100,000 men, old and new, and hope, with God's 
blessing, to gain a decisive victory. 

Sept. 8, camp near Rockville". . . . You don't know what a 
task has been imposed upon me ! I have been obliged to do the 
best I could with the broken and discouraged fragments of two 
armies defeated by no fault of mine. Nothing but a desire to do 
my duty could have induced me to accept the command under 
such circumstances. ^Jot feeling at all sure that I could do any- 
thing, I felt that under the circumstances no one else could save 
the country, and I have not shrunk from the terrible task. 
McDowell's own men would have killed him had he made his 
appearance among them ; even his staff did not dare to go among 
his men. I can afford to forgive and forget him. I saw Pope 
and McDowell for a few moments at Upton's Hill when I rode 
out to meet the troops and assume command. I have not seen 
them since ; I hope never to lay eyes on them again. Between 
them they are responsible for the lives of many of my best and 
bravest men. They have done all they could (unintentionally, I 
hope) to ruin and destroy the country. I can never forgive them 
that. Pope has been foolish enough to try to throw the blame of 
his defeat on the Army of the Potomac. He would have been 
wiser to have accepted his defeat without complaint. I will 
probably move some four or five miles further to the front to- 
morrow, as I have ordered the whole army forward. I expect to 
fight a great battle and to do my best at it. I do not think 
secesh will catch me very badly. 

Tuesday morning, 8.30. ... I hope to learn this morning 
something definite as to the movements of secesh, to be enabled 
to regulate my own. I hardly expect to equal the genius of Mr. 
Pope, but I hope to waste fewer lives and to accomplish some- 
thing more than lame defeat.. I have ordered a general advance 
of a few miles to-day, which will bring us on the line of the 
Seneca, and near enough to secesh to find out what he is doing, 
and take measures accordingly. I shall follow him wherever he 
goes and do my best to beat him. If I accomplish that the cam- 
paign will be ended. 

9.30. . . . The fact is, that commanding such an army as 






PRIVATE LETTERS. 569 

this, picked up after a defeat, is no very easy thing ; it does take 
a great deal of time and infinite labor. In coming to Rockville 
we arrived about midnight. Yesterday we came out to this 
camp, which is about a half-mile from the town. I am still 
uncertain whether I shall move headquarters to-day, or on which 
road, as that depends on the information I receive as to the 
enemy. I probably won't go more than four or five miles in a" 
central direction. ... If I can add the defeat of secesh I think 
I ought to be entitled to fall back into private life. . . . 

Sept. 9, camp near Rockville y 5 P.M. . . . Am going out in a 
few minutes to ride over to the camp of the regulars, whom I 
have not been to see for a long time, and who welcomed me so 
cordially the other night, brave fellows that they are. 

It is hard to get accurate news from the front. The last 
reports from Pleasonton are that the enemy have 110,000 on this 
side of the river. I have not so many, so I must watch them 
closely and try to catch them in some mistake, which I hope to 
do. My people are mostly in front of here, some six to ten 
miles ; moved forward to-day. They are, I think, well placed to 
be concentrated wherever it may be necessary, and I want wno a 
little breathing-time to get them rested and in good order for 
fighting. Most of them will do well now ; a few days will con- 
firm this still further, increase my cavalry force, and put me in 
better condition generally. I think my present positions will 
check the advance into Pennsylvania and give me time to get 
some reinforcements that I need very much. ... I have this 
moment learned that, in addition to the force on this side of the 
river, the enemy has also a large force near Leesburg, so McC. 
has a difficult game to play, but will do his best and try to do his 
duty. 

Sept. n, camp near Rockville. ... I have just time before 
starting to say good-by. ... I am quite tired this morning, as I 
did not get back from a ride to Burnside's until three A.M.; the 
night before I was at the telegraph office sending and receiving 
despatches until the same hour, and how it will be to-night is 
more than I can tell. . . . 

Sept. 12, 3 P.M., camp near Urbana. As our wagons are not 



57O McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

yet up, and won't be for a couple of hours, I avail myself of the 
" advantages of the situation " to scrawl a few lines to you. . 
We are travelling now through one of the most lovely regions I 
have ever seen, quite broken with lovely valleys in all directions, 
and some fine mountains in the distance. From all I can gather 
secesh is skedaddling, and I don't think I can catch him unless 
he is really moving into Pennsylvania ; in that case I shall catch 
him before he has made much headway towards the interior. I 
am beginning to think he is making off to get out of the scrape 
by recrossing the river at Williamsport, in which case my only 
chance of bagging him will be to cross lower down and cut into 
his communications near Winchester. He evidently don't want 
to fight me, for some reason or other. ... I have never injured 

, therefore I am not called upon to make any advances to 

him, as the professor seems to think I ought. As for ever having 
any friendly relation with him, it is simply absurd. . . . 

7.30 P.M. My tent has been pitched some time. I have given 
all the orders necessary for to-morrow, and they have all gone 
to the various camps. ... I believe that I have done all in 
my power and that the arrangement of the troops is good. I 
learned an hour or two ago, through the signal, that our troops 
were entering Frederick. We certainly ought to be there in re- 
spectable force by this time. My only apprehension now is that 
secesh will arrange to get back across the Potomac at Williams- 
port before I can catch him. If he goes to Pennsylvania I think 
I must overhaul him before long and give him a good lesson. 
If he does go to Pennsylvania I feel quite confident that I can 
so arrange things that the chances will all be that he will never 
return ; but I presume he is smart enough to know that and to 
act accordingly. . . . Interrupted here by the news that we really 
have Frederick. Burnside and Pleasonton both there. The next 
trouble is to save the garrison of Harper's Ferry, which is, I fear, 
in danger of being captured by the rebels. They were not placed 
under my orders until this afternoon, although before I left Wash- 
ington I strongly urged that they should be withdrawn at once, 
as I feared they would be captured. But other counsels pre- 
vailed, and I am rather anxious as to the result. If they are not 
taken by this time I think I can save them ; at all events, nothing 
in my power shall be left undone to accomplish this result. I 
feel sure of one thing now, and that is that my men will fight 



PRIVATE LETTERS.

well. . . . The moment I hear that Harper's Ferry is safe I shall 
feel quite sure of the result. . . . The people cheered the troops 
tremendously when they entered Frederick. I have thus far 
found the Union sentiment much stronger in this region than I 
had expected. People are disposed to be very kind and polite to 
me ; invite me into their houses, offer me dinner and various 
other acts of kindness that are quite unknown in the Peninsula. 

Sept. 14, Frederick, A.M. I have only time to say good-morn- 
ing this bright, sunny Sunday, and then start to the front to try 
to relieve Harper's Ferry, which is sorely pressed by secesh. It 
is probable that we shall have a serious engagement to-day, and 
perhaps a general battle ; if we have one at all during this opera- 
tion it ought to be to-day or to-morrow. I feel as reasonably 
confident of success as any one well can who trusts in a higher 
power and does not know what its decision will be. I can't 
describe to you for want of time the enthusiastic reception we 
met with yesterday at Frederick. I was nearly overwhelmed and 
pulled to pieces. I enclose with this a little flag that some en- 
thusiastic lady thrust into or upon Dan's bridle. As to flowers 
they came in crowds ! In truth, I was seldom more affected 
than by the scenes I saw yesterday and the reception I met with ; 
it would have gratified you very much. . . . 



CHAPTER XXXV. 



Entering Frederick The lost despatch Advance The battle of South 
Mountain Gen. Scott hails McClellan. 



IN riding into Frederick I passed through Sumner's corps, 
which I had not seen for some time. The men and officers were 
so enthusiastic as to show that they had lost none of their old 
feeling. During the march (from Washington up) I was much 
with the regulars, generally encamping with them. I never can 
forget their constant enthusiasm ; even when I passed through 
them several times a day on the march they would jump up (if 
at a rest) and begin cheering in a way that regulars are not wont 
to do. Poor fellows ! 

Our reception at Frederick was wonderful. Men, women, 
and children crowded around us, weeping, shouting, and pray- 
ing ; they clung around old Dan's neck and almost suffocated 
the old fellow, decking him out with flags. The houses were all 
decorated with flags, and it was a general scene of joy. The 
secession expedition had been an entire failure in that quarter ; 
they received no recruits of the slightest consequence and no 
free-will offerings of any kind. 

It was soon ascertained that the main body of the enemy's 
forces had marched out of the city on the two previous days, 
taking the roads to Boonsborough and Harper's Ferry, thereby 
rendering it necessary to force the passes through the Catoctin 
and South Mountain ridges, and gain possession of Boons- 
borough and Rohrersville, before any relief could be extended 
to Col. Miles at Harper's Ferry. 

On the 1 3th an order fell into my hands issued by Gen. 
Lee, which fully disclosed his plans, and I immediately gave 
orders for a rapid and vigorous forward movement. 

The following is a copy of the order referred to ;

574 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

On the morning of the i3th Gen. Pleasoriton was ordered to 
send Reynolds's brigade and a section of artillery in the 
direction of Gettysburg, and Rush's regiment towards Jefferson 
to communicate with Franklin, to whom the 6th U. S. Cavalry 
and a section of artillery had previously been sent, and to pro- 
ceed with the remainder of his force in the direction of Middle- 
town in pursuit of the enemy. 

After skirmishing with the enemy all the morning, and driv- 
ing them from several strong positions, he reached Turner's Gap 
of the South Mountain in the afternoon, and found the enemy in 
force and apparently determined to defend the pass. He sent 
back for infantry to Gen. Burnside, who had been directed to 
support him, and proceeded to make a reconnoissance of the 
position. 

The South Mountain is at this point about one thousand feet 
in height, and its general direction is from northeast to south- 
west. The national road from Frederick to Hagerstown crosses 
it nearly at right angles through Turner's Gap, a depression 
which is some four hundred feet in depth. 

The mountain on the north side of the turnpike is divided 
into two crests or ridges by a narrow valley, which, though deep 
at the pass, becomes a slight depression at about a mile to the 
north. There are two country roads one to the right of the 
turnpike and the other to the left which give access to the 
crests overlooking the main road. The one on the left, called 
the " Old Sharpsburg road," is nearly parallel to, and about half 
a mile distant from, the turnpike until it reaches the crest of the 
mountain, when it bends off to the left. The other road, called 
the " Old Hagerstown road," passes up a ravine in the moun- 
tains about a mile from the turnpike, and, bending to the left 
over and along the first crest, enters the turnpike at the Moun- 
tain House near the summit of the pass. 

On the night of the i3th the positions of the different corps 
were as follows : 

Reno's corps at Middletown, except Rodman's division at 
Frederick. 

Hooker's corps on the Monocacy, two miles from Frederick. 

Sumner's corps near Frederick. 

Banks's corps near Frederick. 

Sykes's division near Frederick. 



SUMNER' S CORPS. 



575 



Franklin's corps at Buckeystown. 

Couch's division at Licksville. 

The orders from headquarters for the march on the i4th were 
as follows : 

i3th, 11.30 P.M. Hooker to march at daylight to Middle- 
town. 

i3th, 11.30 P.M. Sykes to move at six A.M., after Hooker, on 
the Middletown and Hagerstown road. 

i4th, i A.M. Artillery reserve to follow Sykes closely. 

i3th, 8.45 P.M. Turner to move at seven A.M. 

1 4th, 9 A.M. Sumner ordered to take the Shookstown road 
to Middletown.* 

*By letter, dated Boston, May 19, 1884, Gen. F. A. Walker called 
the attention of Gen. McClellan to a statement made by the Comte de 
Paris in his " History of the Civil War in America," attributing delay in 
the advance from Frederick to Gen. Sumner and the 2d corps. The fol- 
lowing reply, which I find among the papers relating to South Mountain, 
indicates Gen. McClellan's intention to embody its substance in his narra- 
tive when he should reach this point in his review : 

32 WASHINGTON SQUARE, N. Y., May 21, 1884. 

MY DEAR SIR : Yours of the igth has just reached me. 

My attention was never called to the point in question. 

Like yourself, I am fully satisfied as to the candor and honesty of the 
Comte de Paris, but his work is not free from unintentional errors, of 
which this is an example. 

My report shows that at 8.45 P.M. of the I3th the 2d corps was ordered 
to move at seven A.M. on the I4th by the direct road to Middletown, fol- 
lowing Sykes at an hour's interval. 

Hooker did not move as promptly as ordered, and this delayed Sykes 
and Sumner. Therefore at nine A.M. I ordered Sumner to take the more 
circuitous road by Shookstown, that his march might be free from encum- 
brance. 

The 2d corps made its march and arrived on the field as rapidly as cir- 
cumstances permitted. 

I was never dissatisfied with this march of the 2d corps, and never 
criticised it to any one. 

I can imagine the 2d corps and its brave old commander slow in get- 
ting out of a fight, but they certainly never showed any hesitation or tar- 
diness in getting into battle. The promptness and energy with which 
Sumner moved from Grapevine bridge to the field of Fair Oaks is simply 
one example of the manner in which that corps always acted while under 
my command. You may rest assured that no member of the 2d corps has 
its honor more at heart, or is more proud of its uniformly admirable con- 
duct, whether on the march or in battle, than is the commander under 
whom it first served. 

In my account of AntietamT will take care to correct the error of the 
comte. 

And am always your friend, 

GEO. B, MCCLELLAN. 

Gen. F. A. WALKER, 



576 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

i3th, 6.45 P.M. Couch ordered to move to Jefferson with his 
whole division. 

On the i4th Gen. Pleasonton continued his reconnoissance. 
Gibson's battery and afterwards Benjamin's battery (of Reno's 
corps) were placed on high ground to the left of the turnpike, 
and obtained a direct fire on the enemy's position in the Gap. 

Gen. Cox's division, which had been ordered up to support 
Gen. Pleasonton, left its bivouac near Middletown at six A.M. 
The ist brigade reached the scene of action about nine A.M., and 
was sent up the old Sharpsburg road by Gen. Pleasonton to feel 
the enemy and ascertain if he held the crest on that side in 
strong force. This was soon found to be the case ; and Gen. 
Cox having arrived with the other brigade, and information hav- 
ing been received from Gen. Reno that the column would be 
supported by the whole corps, the division was ordered to assault 
the position. Two 20-pounder Parrotts of Simmons's battery 
and two sections of McMullan's battery were left in the rear in 
position near the turnpike, where they did good service during 
the day against the enemy's batteries in the Gap. Scammon's 
brigade was deployed, and, well covered by skirmishers, moved 
up the slope to the left of the road with the object of turning 
the enemy's right, if possible. It succeeded in gaining the crest 
and establishing itself there, in spite of the vigorous efforts of 
the enemy, who was posted behind stone walls and in the edges 
of timber, and the fire of a battery which poured in canister and 
case-shot on the regiment on the right of the brigade. Col. 
Crook's brigade marched in columns at supporting distance. A 
section of McMullan's battery, under Lieut. Croome (killed while 
serving one of his guns), was moved up with great difficulty, and 
opened with canister at very short range on the enemy's infantry, 
by whom (after having done considerable execution) it was soon 
silenced and forced to withdraw. 

One regiment of Crook's brigade was now deployed on 
Scammon's left and the other two in his rear, and they several 
times entered the first line and relieved the regiments in front of 
them when hard pressed. A section of Sumner's battery was 
brought up and placed in the open space in the woods, where 
it did good service during the rest of the day. 

The enemy several times attempted to retake the crest, 
advancing with boldness, but were each time repulsed. They

then withdrew their battery to a point more to the right, and 
formed columns on both our flanks. It was now about noon, 
and a lull occurred in the contest which lasted about two hours, 
during which the rest of the corps was coming up. Gen. Wil- 
cox's division was the first to arrive. When he reached the base 
of the mountain Gen. Cox advised him to consult Gen. Pleason- 
ton as to a position. The latter indicated that on the right after- 
wards taken up by Gen. Hooker. Gen. Wilcox was in the act 
of moving to occupy this ground when he received an order from 
Gen. Reno to move up the old Sharpsburg road and take a posi- 
tion to its right overlooking the turnpike. Two regiments were 
detached to support Gen. Cox at his request. One section of 
Cooke's battery was placed in position near the turn of the road 
(on the crest), and opened fire on the enemy's batteries across 
the Gap. The division was proceeding to deploy to the right of 
the road when the enemy suddenly opened (at one hundred and 
fifty yards) with a battery which enfiladed the road at this point, 
drove off Cooke's cannoneers with their limbers, and caused a 
temporary panic in which the guns were nearly lost. But the 
79th N. Y. and iyth Mich, promptly rallied, changed front under 
a heavy fire, and moved out to protect the guns, with which Capt. 
Cooke had remained. Order was soon restored, and the division 
formed in line on the right of Cox, and was kept concealed as 
much as possible under the hillside until the whole line advanced. 
It was exposed not only to the fire of the battery in front, but 
also to that of the batteries on the other side of the turnpike, 
and lost heavily. 

Shortly before this time Gens. Burnside and Reno arrived 
at the base of the mountain, and the former directed the latter 
to move up the divisions of Gens. Sturgis and Rodman to the 
crest held by Cox and Wilcox, and to move upon the enemy's 
position with his whole force as soon as he was informed that 
Gen. Hooker (who had just been directed to attack on the right) 
was well advanced up the mountain. 

Gen. Reno then went to the front and assumed the direction 
of affairs, the positions having been explained to him by Gen. 
Pleasonton. Shortly before this time I arrived at the point occu- 
pied by Gen. Burnside, and my headquarters were located there 
until the conclusion of the action. Gen. Sturgis had left his 
camp at one P.M., and reached the scene of action about 3.30 P.M. 



578 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Clark's battery, of his division, was sent to assist Cox's left by 
order of Gen. Reno, and two regiments (2d Md. and 6th N. H.) 
were detached by Gen. Reno and sent forward a short distance 
on the left of the turnpike. His division was formed in rear of 
Wilcox's, and Rodman's division was divided ; Col. Fairchild's 
brigade being placed on the extreme left, and Col. Harland's, 
under Gen. Rodman's personal supervision, on the right. 

My order to move the whole line forward and take or silence 
the enemy's batteries in front was executed with enthusiasm. 
The enemy made a desperate resistance, charging our advanc- 
ing lines with fierceness, but they were everywhere routed, and 
fled. 

Our chief loss was in Wilcox's division. The enemy's bat- 
tery was found to be across a gorge and beyond the reach of our 
infantry ; but its position was made untenable, and it was hastily 
removed and not again put in position near us. But the bat- 
teries across the Gap still kept up a fire of shot and shell. 

Gen. Wilcox praises very highly the conduct of the i;th 
Mich, in this advance a regiment which had been organized 
scarcely a month, but which charged the advancing enemy in 
flank in a manner worthy of veteran troops ; and also that of 
the 45th Penn., which bravely met them in front. 

Cooke's battery now reopened fire. Sturgis's division was 
moved to the front of Wilcox's, occupying the new ground 
gained on the further side of the slope, and his artillery opened 
on the batteries across the Gap. The enemy made an effort to 
turn our left about dark, but were repulsed by Fairchild's bri- 
gade and Clark's battery. 

At about seven o'clock the enemy made another effort to 
regain the lost ground, attacking along Sturgis's front and part 
of Cox's. A lively fire was kept up until nearly nine o'clock, 
several charges being made by the enemy and repulsed with 
slaughter, and we finally occupied the highest part of the moun- 
tain. 

Gen. Reno was killed just before sunset, while making a 
reconnoissance to the front, and the command of the corps 
devolved upon Gen. Cox. In Gen. Reno the nation lost one of 
its best general officers. He was a skilful soldier, a brave and 
honest man. 

There was no firing after ten o'clock, and the troops slept on 



SOUTH MOUNTAIN. 



579 



their arms, ready to renew the fight at daylight ; but the enemy 
quietly retired from our front during the night, abandoning their 
wounded, and leaving their dead in large numbers scattered over 
the field. While these operations were progressing on the left 
of the main column, the right, under Gen. Hooker, was actively 
engaged. His corps left the Monocacy early in the morning, 
and its advance reached the Catoctin creek about one P.M. Gen. 
Hooker then went forward to examine the ground. 

At about one o'clock Gen. Meade's division was ordered to 
make a diversion in favor of Reno. The following is the order 
sent : 

SEPT. 14, i P.M. 

GENERAL : Gen. Reno requests that a division of yours may 
move up on the right (north) of the main road. Gen. McClellan 
desires you to comply with this request, holding your whole corps 
in readiness to support the movement, and taking charge of it 
yourself. 

Sumner's and Banks's corps have commenced arriving. Let 
Gen. McClellan be informed as soon as you commence your 
movement. 

GEORGE D. RUGGLES, 
Col., As st. Adj. -Gen., and Aide-de-Camp. 
Maj.-Gen. HOOKER. 

Meade's division left Catoctin creek about two o'clock, and 
turned off to the right from the main road on the old Hagers- 
town road to Mount Tabor church, where Gen. Hooker was, 
and deployed a short distance in advance, its right resting about 
one and a half miles from the turnpike. The enemy fired a few 
shots from a battery on the mountain-side, but did no conside- 
rable damage. Cooper's battery, " B," ist Penn. Artillery, was 
placed in position on high ground at about three and a half 
o'clock, and fired at the enemy on the slope, but soon ceased 
by order of Gen. Hooker, and the position of our lines prevent- 
ed any further use of artillery by us on this part of the field. 
The ist Mass. Cavalry was sent up the valley to the right to 
observe the movements, if any, of the enemy in that direction, 
and one regiment of Meade's division was posted to watch a 
road coming in the same direction. The other divisions were 
deployed as they came up Gen. Hatch's on the left, and Gen. 
Ricketts's, which arrived at five P.M., in the rear. Gen. Gibbon's 

43 



580 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

brigade was detached from Hatch's division by Gen. Burnside, 
for the purpose of making a demonstration on the enemy's cen- 
tre, up the main road, as soon as the movements on the right 
and left had sufficiently progressed. The ist Penn. Rifles, of 
Gen. Seymour's brigade, were sent forward as skirmishers to feel 
the enemy, and it was found that he was in force. Meade was 
then directed to advance his division to the right of the road, so 
as to outflank them, if possible, and then to move forward and 
attack, while Hatch was directed to take with his division the 
crest on the left of the old Hagerstown road, Ricketts's division 
being held in reserve. Seymour's brigade was sent up to the 
top of the slope, on the right of the ravine through which the 
road runs, and then moved along the summit parallel to the 
road, while Col. Gallagher's and Col. Magilton's brigades moved 
in the same direction along the slope and in the ravine. 

The ground was of the most difficult character for the move- 
ment of troops, the hillside being very steep and rocky, and 
obstructed by stone walls and timber. The enemy was very 
soon encountered, and in a short time the action became gene- 
ral along the whole front of the division. The line advanced 
steadily up the mountain-side, where the enemy was posted be- 
hind trees and rocks, from w r hich he was gradually dislodged. 
During this advance Col. Gallagher, commanding 3d brigade, 
was severely wounded, and the command devolved upon Lieut.- 
Col. Robert Anderson. 

Gen. Meade, having reason to believe that the enemy was 
attempting to outflank him on his right, applied to Gen. Hooker 
for reinforcements. Gen. Duryea's brigade, of Ricketts's divi- 
sion, was ordered up, but it did not arrive until the close of the 
action. It was advanced on Seymour's left, but only one regi- 
ment could open fire before the enemy retired and darkness 
intervened. 

Gen. Meade speaks highly of Gen. Seymour's skill in hand- 
ling his brigade on the extreme right, securing by his manoeu- 
vres the great object of the movemmt the outflanking of the 
enemy. 

While Gen. Meade was gallantly driving the enemy on the 
right, Gen. Hatch's division was engaged in a severe contest for 
the possession of the crest on the left of the ravine. It moved 
up the mountain in the following order : Two regiments of Gen. 



SOUTH MOUNTAIN. 58 1 

Patrick's brigade deployed as skirmishers, with the other two 
regiments of the same brigade supporting them ; Col. Phelps's 
brigade in line of battalions in mass at deploying distance, Gen. 
Doubleday's brigade in the same order bringing up the rear. 
The 2ist N. Y. having gone straight up the slope, instead of 
around to the right as directed, the 2d U. S. Sharpshooters was 
sent out in its place. Phelps's and Doubleday's brigades were 
deployed in turn as they reached the woods, which began about 
half up the mountain. Gen. Patrick with his skirmishers soon 
drew the fire of the enemy, and found him strongly posted be- 
hind a fence which bounded the cleared space on the top of the 
ridge, having on his front the woods through which our line was 
advancing, and in his rear a cornfield full of rocky ledges, which 
afforded good cover to fall back to if dislodged. 

Phelps's brigade gallantly advanced, under a hot fire, to close 
quarters, and, after ten or fifteen minutes of heavy firing on both 
sides (in which Gen. Hatch was wounded while urging on his 
men), the fence was carried by a charge, and our line advanced 
a few yards beyond it, somewhat sheltered by the slope of the 
hill. 

Doubleday's brigade, now under the command of Lieut.-Col. 
Hoffmann (Col. Wainwright having been wounded), relieved 
Phelps, and continued firing for an hour and a half ; the ene- 
my, behind ledges of rocks some thirty or forty paces in our 
front, making a stubborn resistance and attempting to charge 
on the least cessation of our fire. About dusk Col. Christian's 
brigade of Ricketts's division came up and relieved Doubleday's 
brigade, which fell back into line behind Phelps's. Christian's 
brigade continued the action for thirty or forty minutes, when 
the enemy retired, after having made an attempt to flank us on 
the left, which was repulsed by the 75th N. Y. and 7th Ind. 

The remaining brigade of Ricketts's division (Gen. Hart- 
suff's) was moved up in the centre, and connected Meade's left 
with Doubleday's right. We now had possession of the summit 
of the first ridge, which commanded the turnpike on both sides 
of the mountain, and the troops were ordered to hold their posi- 
tions until further orders, and slept on their arms. 

Late in the afternoon Gen. Gibbon, with his brigade and 
one section of Gibbon's battery ("B," 4th Artillery), was ordered 
to move up the main road on the enemy's centre. He advanced 



582 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

a regiment on each side of the road, preceded by skirmishers, 
and followed by the other two regiments in double column ; the 
artillery moving on the road until within range of the enemy's 
guns, which were firing on the column from the gorge. 

The brigade advanced steadily, driving the enemy from his 
positions in the woods and behind stone walls, until they reached 
a point well up towards the top of the pass, when the enemy, 
having been reinforced by three regiments, opened a heavy fire 
on the front and on both flanks. The fight continued until nine 
o'clock, the enemy being entirely repulsed ; and the brigade, 
after having suffered severely, and having expended all its ammu- 
nition, including even the cartridges of the dead and wounded, 
continued to hold the ground it had so gallantly won until twelve 
o'clock, when it was relieved by Gen. Gorman's brigade, of Sedg- 
wick's division, Sumner's corps (except the 6th Wis., which re- 
mained on the field all night). Gen. Gibbon, in this delicate 
movement, handled his brigade with as much precision and cool- 
ness as if upon parade, and the bravery of his troops could not 
be excelled. 

The 2d corps (Sumner's) and the i2th corps (Williams's) 
reached their final positions shortly after dark. Gen. Richard- 
son's division was placed near Mount Tabor Church, in a posi- 
tion to support our right, if necessary; the i2th corps and 
Sedgwick's division bivouacked around Bolivar, in a position to 
support our centre and left. 

Gen. Sykes's division of regulars and the artillery reserve 
halted for the night at Middletown. Thus on the night of the 
i4th the whole army was massed in the vicinity of the field of 
battle, in readiness to renew the action the next day or to move 
in pursuit of the enemy. At daylight our skirmishers were ad- 
vanced, and it was found that he had retreated during the night, 
leaving his dead on the field and his wounded uncared for. 

I had reached the front at Middletown about noon, or a little 
before noon, and while there received the messenger from Har- 
per's Ferry by whom I sent the despatch to Gen. Miles before 
mentioned. Immediately afterwards I rode forward to a point 
from which I could see the Gap and the adjacent ground. About 
the time I started Reno sent back a message desiring that a divi- 
sion might be sent to the rear of the pass. I sent the order to 
Hooker to move at once. (Burnside had nothing to do with 



SOUTH MOUNTAIN. 583 

this.) Marcy went with him and remained there most of the 
day. I rather think that he really deserved most of the credit 
for directing the movement, but, with his usual modesty, he 
would say little or nothing about it. 

I pushed up Sturgis to support Cox, and hurried up Sumner 
to be ready as a reserve. Burnside never came as near the battle 
as my position. Yet it was his command that was in action ! He 
spent the night in the same house that I did. In the course of 
the evening, when I had prepared the telegram to the President 
announcing the result of the day, I showed it to Burnside before 
sending it off, and asked if it was satisfactory to him ; he replied 
that it was altogether so. Long afterwards it seems that he came 
to the conclusion that I did not give him sufficient credit ; but 
he never said a word to me on the subject. 

On the next day I had the honor to receive the following very 
kind despatch from the President : 

"WAR DEPARTMENT, 
"WASHINGTON, Sept. 15, 1862, 2.45 P.M. 

" Your despatch of to-day received. God bless you and all 
with you ! Destroy the rebel army, if possible. 

"A. LINCOLN. 
"To Maj.-Gen. MCCLELLAN." 

The following despatch was also received on the i6th : 

"WEST POINT, i6th, 1862.

CHAPTER XXXVI. 

Antietam Pursuit from South Mountain Position of the enemy The 
Battle Burnside's failure His contradictory statements Letters of 
Col. Sackett. 

ON the night of the battle of South Mountain orders were 
given to the corps commanders to press forward their pickets 
at early dawn. This advance revealed the fact that the enemy 
had left his positions, and an immediate pursuit was ordered ; 
the cavalry, under Gen. Pleasonton, and the three corps under 
Gens. Sumner, Hooker, and Mansfield (the latter of whom had 
arrived that morning and assumed command of the i2th [Wil- 
liams's] corps), by the national turnpike and Boonsborough ; 
the corps of Gens. Burnside and Porter (the latter command at 
that time consisting of but one weak division, Sykes's) by the 
old Sharpsburg road ; and Gen. Franklin to move into Pleasant 
Valley, occupy Rohrersville by a detachment, and endeavor ta 
relieve Harper's Ferry. 

Gens. Burnside and Porter, upon reaching the road from 
Boonsborough to Rohrersville, were to reinforce Franklin or to 
move on Sharpsburg, according to circumstances. 

Franklin moved towards Brownsville and found there a force 
of the enemy, much superior in numbers to his own, drawn up 
in a strong position to receive him. 

At this time the cessation of firing at Harper's Ferry indi- 
cated the surrender of that place. 

The cavalry overtook the enemy's cavalry in Boonsborough, 
made a dashing charge, killing and wounding a number, and 
capturing 250 prisoners and 2 guns. 

Gen. Richardson's division of the 2d corps, pressing the rear- 
guard of the enemy with vigor, passed Boonsborough and Keedys- 
ville, and came upon the main body of the enemy, occupying in 
large force a strong position a few miles beyond the latter place. 

It had been hoped to engage the enemy on the isth. Accord- 
ingly instructions were given that if the enemy were overtaken on 

584 



586 McCLELLAN'S OWN S70RY. 

the march they should be attacked at once ; if found in heavy- 
force and in position, the corps in advance should be placed in 
position for attack and await my arrival. 

Early in the morning I had directed Burnside to put his corps 
in motion upon the old Sharpsburg road, but to wait with me for 
a time until more detailed news came from Franklin. About 
eight o'clock he begged me to let him go, saying that his corps 
had been some time in motion,, and that if he delayed longer he 
would have difficulty in overtaking it; so I let him go. At about 
midday I rode to the point where Reno was killed the day before,, 
and found that Burnside's troops, the pth corps, had not stirred 
from its bivouac, and still blocked the road for the regular divi- 
sion. I sent for Burnside for an explanation, but he could not 
be found. He subsequently gave as an excuse the fatigued and 
hungry condition of his men. 

" HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF POTOMAC, 

" Sept. 15, 12.30 P.M. 
" Gen. Burnside : 

"Gen. McClellan desires you to let Gen. Porter's go on past 
you, if necessary. You will then push your own command on as 
rapidly as possible. The general also desires to know the reason 
for your delay in starting this morning. 

" Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

" GEO. D. RUGGLES, 

" Col. and A. D. C."- 

After seeing the ground where Reno fell, and passing over 
Hooker's battle-ground of the previous day, I went rapidly to 
the front by the main road, being received by the troops, as I 
passed them, with the wildest enthusiasm. Near Keedysville I 
met Sumner, who told me that the enemy were in position in 
strong force, arid took me to a height in front of Keedysville 
whence a view of the position could be obtained. We were 
accompanied by a numerous staff and escort ; but no sooner 
had we shown ourselves on the hill than the enemy opened 
upon us with rifled guns, and, as his firing was very good, the 
hill was soon cleared of all save Fitz-John Porter and myself. 
I at once gave orders for the positions of the bivouacs, mass- 
ing the army so that it could be handled as required. I ordered 
Burnside to the left. He grumbled that his troops were fatigued, 
but I started him off anyhow. 






ANTIETAM. 



58? 



The first rapid survey of the enemy's position inclined me 
to attack his left, but the day was far gone. 

He occupied a strong position on the heights, on the west 
side of Antietam creek, displaying a large force of infantry and 
cavalry, with numerous batteries of artillery, which opened on 
our columns as they appeared in sight on the Keedysville road 
and Sharpsburg turnpike, which fire was returned by Capt. Tid- 
ball's light battery, 2d U. S. Artillery, and Pettit's battery, ist 
N. Y. Artillery. 

The division of Gen. Richardson, following close on the heels 
of the retreating foe, halted and deployed near Antietam river, 
on the right of the Sharpsburg road. Gen. Sykes, leading on 
the division of regulars on the old Sharpsburg road, came up 
and deployed to the left of Gen. Richardson, on the left of the 
road. 

Antietam creek, in this vicinity, is crossed by four stone 
bridges the upper one on the Keedysville and Williamsport 
road ; the second on the Keedysville and Sharpsburg turnpike, 
some two and a half miles below ; the third about a mile below 
the second, on the Rohrersville and Sharpsburg road ; and the 
fourth near the mouth of Antietam creek, on the road leading 
from Harper's Ferry to Sharpsb.urg, some three miles below the 
third. The stream is sluggish, with few and difficult fords. 
After a rapid examination of the position I found that it was 
too late to attack that day, and at once directed the placing of 
the batteries in position in the centre, and indicated the bivouacs 
for the different corps, massing them near and on both sides of 
the Sharpsburg turnpike. The corps were not all in their posi- 
tions until the next morning after sunrise. 

On the morning of the i6th it was discovered that the ene- 
my had changed the position of his batteries. The masses of his 
troops, however, were still concealed behind the opposite heights. 
Their left and centre were upon and in front of the Sharpsburg 
and Hagerstown turnpike, hidden by woods and irregularities of 
the ground ; their extreme left resting upon a wooded eminence 
near the cross-roads to the north of J. Miller's farm, their left 
resting upon the Potomac. Their line extended south, the right 
resting upon the hills to the south of Sharpsburg, near Snavely's 
farm. 

The bridge over the Antietam near this point was strongly 



588 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

covered by riflemen protected by rifle-pits, stone fences, etc., 
and enfiladed by artillery. The ground in front of this line 
consisted of undulating hills, their crests in turn commanded 
by others in their rear. On all favorable points the enemy's 
artillery was posted, and their reserves, hidden from view by 
the hills on which their line of battle was formed, could manoeu- 
vre unobserved by our army, and from the shortness of their 
line could rapidly reinforce any point threatened by our attack. 
Their position, stretching across the angle formed by the Poto- 
mac and Antietam, their flanks and rear protected by these 
streams, was one of the strongest to be found in this region of 
country, which is well adapted to defensive warfare. 

On the right, near Keedysville, on both sides of the Sharps- 
burg turnpike, were Sumner's and Hooker's corps. In advance, 
on the right of the turnpike and near the Antietam river, Gen. 
Richardson's division of Gen. Sumner's corps was posted. Gen. 
Sykes's division of Gen. Porter's corps- was on the left of the 
turnpike and in line with Gen. Richardson, protecting the bridge 
No. 2 over the Antietam. The left of the line, opposite to and 
some distance from bridge No. 3, was occupied by Gen. Burn- 
side's corps. 

Before giving Gen. Hooker his orders to make the move- 
ment which will presently be described, I rode to the left of the 
line to satisfy myself that the troops were properly posted there 
to secure our left flank from any attack made along the left bank 
of the Antietam, as well as to enable us to carry bridge No. 3. 

I rode along the whole front, generally in front of our pick- 
ets, accompanied by Hunt, Duane, Colburn, and a couple of 
orderlies, and went considerably beyond our actual and even- 
tual left. Our small party drew the enemy's fire frequently, 
and developed the position of most of his batteries. I threw 
some of the regulars a little more to the left, and observed that 
our extreme left was not well placed to cover the position against 
any force approaching from Harper's Ferry by the left bank 
of the Antietam ; also that the ground near " Burnside's bridge " 
was favorable for defence on our side, and that an attack across 
it would lead to favorable results. I therefore at once ordered 
Burnside to move his corps nearer the bridge, occupy the heights 
in rear, as well as to watch the approach from Harper's Ferry 
just spoken of. I gave this order at midday ; it was near night 



ANTIETAM. 



589 



before it was executed. I also instructed him to examine all 
the vicinity of the bridge, as he would probably be ordered to 
attack there next morning. 

In front of Gens. Sumner's and Hooker's corps, near Keedys- 
ville, and on the ridge of the first line of hills overlooking the 
Antietam, and between the turnpike and Fry's house on the right 
of the road, were placed Capts. Taft's, Langner's, Von Kleizer's, 
and Lieut. Weaver's batteries of 20-pounder Parrott guns ; on

the crest of the hill in the rear and right of bridge No. 3, Capt. 
Weed's 3-inch and Lieut. Benjamin's 2o-pounder batteries. Gen. 
Franklin's corps and Gen. Couch's division held a position in 
Pleasant Valley in front of Brownsville, with a strong force of the 
enemy in their front. Gen. Morell's division of Porter's corps 
was en route from Boonsborough, and Gen. Humphreys's divi- 
sion of new troops en route from Frederick, Md. About day- 
light on the 1 6th the enemy opened a heavy fire of artillery on 
our guns in position, which was promptly returned ; their fire 



5QO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

was silenced for the time, but was frequently renewed during, 
the day. 

It was afternoon before I could move the troops to their 
positions for attack, being compelled to spend the morning in 
reconnoitring the new position taken up by the enemy, examin- 
ing the ground, finding fords, clearing the approaches, and hur- 
rying up the ammunition and supply-trains, which had been 
delayed by the rapid march of the troops over the few practi- 
cable approaches from Frederick. These had been crowded by 
the masses of infantry, cavalry, and artillery pressing on with 
the hope of overtaking the enemy before he could form to resist 
an attack. Many of the troops were out of rations on the pre- 
vious day, and -a good deal of their ammunition had been ex- 
pended in the severe action of the i4th. 

My plan for the impending general engagement was to attack 
the enemy's left with the corps of Hooker and Mansfield, sup- 
ported by Sumner's and, if necessary, by Franklin's ; and as 
soon as matters looked favorably there, to move the corps of 
Burnside against the enemy's extreme right, upon the ridge run- 
ning to the south and rear of Sharpsburg, and, having carried 
their position, to press along the crest towards our right ; and 
whenever either of these flank movements should be successful, 
to advance our centre with all the forces then disposable. 

About two P.M. Gen. Hooker, with his corps, consisting of 
Gens. Ricketts's, Meade's, and Doubleday's divisions, was ordered 
to cross the Antietam at a ford, and at bridge No. i, a short 
distance above, to attack and, if possible, turn the enemy's left. 
Gen. Sumner was ordered to cross the corps of Gen. Mansfield 
(the 1 2th) during the night, and hold his own (the 2d) corps 
ready to cross early the next morning. On reaching the vicinity 
of the enemy's left a sharp contest commenced with the Pennsyl- 
vania reserves, the advance of Gen. Hooker's corps, near the 
house of D. Miller. The enemy was driven from the strip of 
woods where he was first met. The firing lasted until after 
dark, when Gen. Hooker's corps rested on their arms on ground 
won from the enemy. 

When I returned to the right, and found that Hooker's pre- 
parations were not yet complete, I went to hurry them in person. 
It was perhaps half-past three to four o'clock before Hooker 
could commence crossing and get fairly in motion up the oppo- 



A N TIE T AM'. 



591 



site slopes. I accompanied the movement, at the head of the 
column, until -the top of the ridge was 'fairly gained, indicated 
the new direction to be taken, and then returned to headquar- 
ters not to the camp, but to a house further in advance (Fry's 
house), where I passed the night. 

During the night Gen. Mansfield's corps, consisting of Gens. 
Williams's and Greene's divisions, crossed the Antietam at the 
same ford and bridge that Gen. Hooker's troops had passed, and 
bivouacked on the farm of J. Poffenberger, about a mile in rear 
of Gen. Hooker's position. 

At daylight on the iyth the action was commenced by the 
skirmishers of the Pennsylvania reserves. The whole of Gen. 
Hooker's corps was soon engaged, and drove the enemy from 
the open field in front of the first line of woods into a second 
line of woods beyond, which runs to the eastward of and nearly 
parallel to the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike. This con- 
test was obstinate, and as the troops advanced the opposition 
became more determined and the number of the enemy greater. 
Gen. Hooker then ordered up the" corps of Gen. Mansfield, 
which moved promptly toward the scene of action. 

The first division, Gen. Williams's, was deployed to the right 
on approaching the enemy ; Gen. Crawford's brigade on the 
right, its right resting on the Hagerstown turnpike ; on his left 
Gen. Gordon's brigade. The second division, Gen. Greene's, 
joining the left of Gordon's, extended as far as the burnt build- 
ings to the north and east of the white church on the turnpike. 
During the deployment that gallant veteran, Gen. Mansfield, fell 
mortally wounded while examining the ground in front of his 
troops. Gen. Hartsuff, of Hooker's corps, was severely wounded 
while bravely pressing forward his troops, and was taken from 
the field. 

The command of the i2th corps fell 'upon Gen. Williams. 
Five regiments of the first division of this corps were new troops. 
One brigade of the second division was sent to support Gen. 
Doubleday. 

The 1 24th Penn. Volunteers were pushed across the turnpike 
into the woods beyond J. Miller's house, with orders to hold the 
position as long as possible. 

The line of battle of this corps was formed, and it became 
engaged about seven A.M., the attack being opened by Knapp's 



592 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

(Perm.), Cothran's (N. Y.), and Hampton's (Pittsburgh) batteries. 
To meet this attack the enemy had pushed a strong column of 
troops into the open fields in front of the turnpike, while he 
occupied the woods on the west of the turnpike in strong force. 
The woods (as was found by subsequent observation) were tra- 
versed by outcropping ledges of rock. Several hundred yards 
to the right and rear was a hill which commanded the debouch 
of the woods, and in the fields between was a long line of stone 
fences, continued by breastworks of rails, which covered the ene- 
my's infantry from our musketry. The same woods formed a 
screen behind which his movements were concealed, and his 
batteries on the hill and the rifle-works covered from the fire 
of our artillery in front. 

For about two hours the battle raged with varied success, 
the enemy endeavoring to drive our troops into the second line 
of wood, and ours in turn to get possession of the line in front. 

Our troops ultimately succeeded in forcing the enemy back 
into the woods near the turnpike, Gen. Greene with his two bri- 
gades crossing into the woods to the left of the Dunker church. 
During this conflict Gen. Crawford, commanding ist division 
after Gen. Williams took command of the corps, was wounded 
and left the field. 

Gen. Greene being much exposed and applying for reinforce- 
ments, the i3th N. J., 2yth Ind., and the 3d Md. were sent to his 
support with a section of Knapp's battery. 

At about nine o'clock A.M. Gen. Sedgwick's division of Gen. 
Sumner's corps arrived. Crossing the ford previously mentioned, 
this division marched in three columns to the support of the 
attack on the enemy's left. On nearing the scene of action the 
columns were halted, faced to the front, and established by 
Gen. Sumner in three parallel lines by brigade, facing toward 
the south and west ; Gen. Gorman's brigade in front, Gen. 
Dana's second, and Gen. Howard's third, with a distance between 
the lines of some seventy paces. The division was then put in 
motion and moved upon the field of battle, under fire from the 
enemy's concealed batteries on the hill beyond the roads. Pass- 
ing diagonally to the front across the open space, and to the 
front of the first division of Gen. Williams's corps, this latter 
division withdrew. 

Entering the woods on the west of the turnpike, and driving

593 



the enemy before them, the first line was met by a heavy fire of 
musketry and shell from the enemy's breastworks and the bat- 
teries on the hill commanding the exit from the woods. Mean- 
time a heavy column of the enemy had succeeded in crowding 
back the troops of Gen. Greene's division, and appeared in rear 
of the left of Sedgwick's division. By command of Gen. Sum- 
ner, Gen. Howard faced the third line to the rear preparatory to 
a change of front to meet the column advancing on the left ; but 
this line, now suffering from a destructive fire both in front and 
on its left which it was unable to return, gave way towards the 
right and rear in considerable confusion, and was soon followed 
by the first and second lines. 

Gen. Gorman's brigade, and one regiment of Gen. Dana's, 
soon rallied and checked the advance of the enemy on the right. 
The second and third lines now formed on the left of Gen. Gor- 
man's brigade and poured a destructive fire upon the enemy. 

During Gen. Sumner's attack he ordered Gen. Williams to 
support him. Brig.-Gen. Gordon, with a portion of his brigade, 
moved forward, but when he reached the woods the left of Gen. 
Sedgwick's division had given way ; and finding himself, as the 
smoke cleared up, opposed to the enemy in force with his small 
command, he withdrew to the rear of the batteries at the second 
line of woods. As Gen. Gordon's troops unmasked our batteries 
on the left they opened with canister ; the batteries of Capt. 
Cothran, ist N. Y., and "I," ist Artillery, commanded by Lieut. 
Woodruff, doing good service. Unable to withstand this deadly 
fire in front and the musketry-fire from the right, the enemy 
again sought shelter in the woods and rocks beyond the turn- 
pike. 

During this assault Gens. Sedgwick and Dana were seriously 
wounded and taken from the field. Gen. Sedgwick, though 
twice wounded and faint from loss of blood, retained command 
of his division for more than an hour after his first wound, ani- 
mating his command by his presence. 

About the time of Gen. Sedgwick's advance Gen. Hooker, 
while urging on his command, was severely wounded in the foot 
and taken from the field, and Gen. Meade was placed in com- 
mand of his corps. Gen. Howard assumed command after Gen. 
Sedgwick retired. 

The repulse of the enemy offered opportunity to rearrange 



594 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

the lines and reorganize the commands on the right, now more 
or less in confusion. The batteries of the Pennsylvania reserve, 
on high ground near J. Poffenberger's house, opened fire and 
checked several attempts of the enemy to establish batteries in 
front of our right, to turn that flank and enfilade the lines. 

While the conflict was so obstinately raging on the right Gen. 
French was pushing his division against the enemy still further 
to the left. This division crossed the Antietam at the same ford 
as Gen. Sedgwick, and immediately in his rear. Passing over the 
stream in three columns, the division marched about a mile from 
the ford, then, facing to the left, moved in three lines towards the 
enemy : Gen. Max Weber's brigade in front, Col. Dwight Mor- 
ris's brigade of raw troops undrilled, and moving for the first 
time under fire in the second, and Gen. Kimball's brigade in the 
third. The division was first assailed by a fire of artillery, but 
steadily advanced, driving in the enemy's skirmishers, and en-' 
countered the infantry in some force at the group of houses on 
Roulette's farm. Gen. Weber's brigade gallantly advanced with 
an unwavering front and drove the enemy from their position 
about the houses. 

While Gen. Weber was hotly engaged with the first line of the 
enemy, Gen. French received orders from Gen. Sumner, his corps 
commander, to push on with renewed vigor to make a diversion 
in favor of the attack on the right. Leaving the new troops, who 
had been thrown into some confusion from their march through 
cornfields, over fences, etc., to form as a reserve, he ordered the 
brigade of Gen. Kimball to the front, passing to the left of Gen. 
Weber. The enemy was pressed back to near the crest of the 
hill, where he was encountered in greater strength posted in a 
sunken road forming a natural rifle-pit running in a northwest- 
erly direction. In a cornfield in rear of this road were also 
strong bodies of the enemy. As the line reached the crest of 
the hill a galling fire was opened on it from the sunken road and 
cornfield. Here a terrific fire of musketry burst from both lines, 
and the battle raged along the whole line with great slaughter. 

The enemy attempted to turn the left of the line, but were 
met by the yth Va. and i32d Penn. Volunteers and repulsed. 
Foiled in this, the enemy made a determined assault on the front, 
but were met by a charge from our lines which drove them back 
with severe loss, leaving in our hands some 300 prisoners and

595 



several stands of colors. The enemy, having been repulsed by 
the terrible execution of the batteries and the musketry-fire on 
the extreme right, now attempted to assist the attack on Gen. 
French's division by assailing him on his right and endeavoring 
to turn this flank; but this attack was met and checked by the 
1 4th Ind. and 8th O. Volunteers, and by canister from Capt. 
Tompkins's battery, ist R. I. Artillery. Having been under 
an almost continuous fire for nearly four hours, and the ammu- 
nition nearly expended, this division now took position imme- 
diately below the crest of the heights on which they had so 
gallantly fought, the enemy making no attempt to regain their 
lost ground. 

On the left of Gen. French, Gen. Richardson's division was 
hotly engaged. Having crossed the Antietam about 9.30 A.M. at 
the ford crossed by the other divisions of Sumner's corps, it 
moved on a line nearly parallel to the Antietam, and formed in a 
ravine behind the high grounds overlooking Roulette's house ; 
the 2d (Irish) brigade, commanded by Gen. Meagher, on the 
right ; the 3d brigade, commanded by Gen. Caldwell, on his left, 
and the brigade commanded by Col. Brooks, 53d Penn. Volun- 
teers, in support. As the division moved forward to take its 
position on the field, the enemy directed a fire of artillery against 
it, but, owing to the irregularities of the ground, did but little 
damage. 

Meagher' s brigade, advancing steadily, soon became engaged 
with the enemy posted to the left and in front of Roulette's 
house. It continued to advance under a heavy fire nearly to the 
crest of the hill overlooking Piper's house, the enemy being post- 
ed in a continuation of the sunken road and cornfield before 
referred to. Here the brave Irish brigade opened upon the 
enemy a terrific musketry-fire. 

All of Gen. Sumner's corps was now engaged Gen. Sedg- 
wick on the right, Gen. French in the centre, and Gen. Richard- 
son on the left. The Irish brigade sustained its well-earned 
reputation. After suffering terribly in officers and men, and 
strewing the ground with their enemies as they drove them 
back, their ammunition nearly expended, and their commander, 
Gen. Meagher, disabled by the fall of his horse shot under him, 
this brigade was ordered to give place to Gen. Caldwell's brigade, 
which advanced to a short distance in its rear. The lines were 



596 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

passed by the Irish brigade breaking by company to the rear, and 
Gen. Caldwell's by company to the front, as steadily as on drill. 
Col. Brooks's brigade now became the second line. 

The ground over which Gens. Richardson's and French's, 
divisions were fighting was very irregular, intersected by nume- 
rous ravines, hills covered with growing corn, enclosed by stone 
walls, behind which the enemy could advance unobserved upon 
any exposed point of our lines. Taking advantage of this, the 
enemy attempted to gain the right of Richardson's position in a 
cornfield near Roulette's house, where the division had become 
separated from that of Gen. French's. A change of front by the 
52d N. Y. and 2d Del. Volunteers, of Col. Brooks's brigade, 
under Col. Frank, and the attack made by the 53d Penn. Volun- 
teers, sent further to the right by Col. Brooks to close this gap in 
the line, and the movement of the i32d Penn. and yth Va. Vol- 
unteers, of Gen. French's division, before referred to, drove the 
enemy from the cornfield and restored the line. 

The brigade of Gen. Caldwell, with determined gallantry, 
pushed the enemy back opposite the left and centre of this 
division, but, sheltered in the sunken road, they still held our 
forces on the right of Caldwell in check. Col. Barlow, com- 
manding the 6ist and 64th N. Y. regiments, of Caldwell's brigade, 
seeing a favorable opportunity, advanced the regiments on the 
left, taking the line in the sunken road in flank, and compelled 
them to surrender, capturing over 300 prisoners and three stands 
of colors. 

The whole of the brigade, with the 57th and 66th N. Y. regi- 
ments, of Col. Brooks's brigade, who had moved these regiments 
into the first line, now advanced with gallantry, driving the 
enemy before them in confusion into the cornfield beyond the 
sunken road. The left of the division was now well advanced, 
when the enemy, concealed by an intervening ridge, endeavored 
to turn its left and rear. 

Col. Cross, 5th N. H., by a change of front to the left and 
rear, brought his regiment facing the advancing line. Here a 
spirited contest arose to gain a commanding height, the two 
opposing forces moving parallel to each other, giving and receiv- 
ing fire. The 5th, gaining the advantage, faced to the right and 
delivered its volley. The enemy staggered, but rallied and 
advanced desperately at a charge. Being reinforced In the

597 






8ist Perm., these regiments met the advance by a counter- 
charge. The enemy fled, leaving many killed, wounded, and 
prisoners, and the colors of the 4th N. C., in our hands. 

Another column of the enemy, advancing under shelter of 
a stone wall and cornfield, pressed down on the right of the 
division; but Col. Barlow again advanced the 6ist and 64th 
N. Y. against these troops, and, with the attack of Kimball's 
brigade on the right, drove them from this position. 

Our troops on the left of this part of the line having driven 
the enemy far back, they, with reinforced numbers, made a 
determined attack directly in front. To meet this Col. Barlow 
brought his two regiments to their position in line, and drove the 
enemy through the cornfield into the orchard beyond, under a. 
heavy fire of musketry, and a fire of canister from two pieces of 
artillery in the orchard, and a battery further to the right throw- 
ing shell and case-shot. This advance gave us possession of 
Piper's house, the strong point contended for by the enemy at this 
part of the line, it being a defensible building several hundred 
yards in advance of the sunken road. The musketry-fire at 
this point of the line now ceased. Holding Piper's house, Gen. 
Richardson withdrew the line a little way to the crest of a hill 
a more advantageous position. Up to this time the division was. 
without artillery, and in the new position suffered severely from 
artillery-fire which could not be replied to. A section of Robert- 
son's horse-battery, commanded by Lieut. Vincent, 2d Artillery, 
now arrived on the ground and did excellent service. Subse- 
quently a battery of brass guns, commanded by Capt. Graham,, 
ist Artillery, arrived, and was posted on the crest of the hill, and 
soon silenced the two guns in the orchard. A heavy fire soon 
ensued between the battery further to the right and our own. 
Capt. Graham's battery was bravely and skilfully served, but, 
unable to reach the enemy, who had rifled guns of greater range 
than our smooth-bores, retired by order of Gen. Richardson, to 
save it fnxn useless sacrifice of men and horses. The brave 
general was himself mortally wounded while personally directing 
its fire. 

Gen. Hancock was placed in command of the division after 
the fall of Gen. Richardson. Gen. Meagher's brigade, now com- 
manded by Col. Burke, of the 63d N. Y., having refilled their 
cartridge-boxes, was again ordered forward, and took position in 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

the centre of the line. The division now occupied one line in 
close proximity to the enemy, who had taken up a position in the 
rear of Piper's house. Col. D wight Morris, with the i4th Gonn. 
and a detachment of the io8th N. Y., of Gen. French's division, 
was sent by Gen. French to the support of Gen. Richardson's 
division. This command was now placed in an interval in the 
line between Gen. Caldwell's and the Irish brigades. 

The requirements of the extended line of battle had so 
engaged the artillery that the. application of -Gen. Hancock for 
artillery for the division could not be complied with immediately 
by the chief of artillery br the corps commanders in his vicinity. 
Knowing the tried courage of the troops, Gen. Hancock felt con- 
fident that he could hold his position, although suffering from the 
enemy's artillery, but was too weak to attack, as the great length 
of the line he was obliged to hold prevented him from forming 
more than one line of battle, and, from his advanced position, 
this line was already partly enfiladed by the batteries of the 
enemy on the right, which were protected from our batteries 
opposite them by the woods at the Dunker church. 

Seeing a body of the enemy advancing on some of our troops 
to the left of his position, Gen. Hancock obtained Hexamer's 
battery from Gen. Franklin's corps, which assisted materially 
in frustrating this attack. It also assisted the attack of the 
7th Me., of Franklin's corps, which, without other aid, made an 
attack against the enemy's line, and drove in skirmishers who 
were annoying our artillery and troops on the right. Lieut. 
Woodruff, with battery I, 2d Artillery, relieved Capt. Hexamer, 
whose ammunition was expended. The enemy at one time 
seemed to be about making an attack in force upon this part 
of the line, and advanced a long column of infantry towards this 
division ; but on nearing the position, Gen. Pleasonton opening 
on them with sixteen guns, they halted, gave a desultory fire, 
and retreated, closing the operations on this portion of the field. 
I return to the incidents occurring still further to the right. 

Between twelve and one P.M. Gen. Franklin's corps arrived 
on the field of battle, having left their camp near Crampton's 
Pass at six A.M., leaving Gen. Couch with orders to move with 
his division to occupy Maryland Heights. Gen. Smith's division 
led the column, followed by Gen. Slocum's. 

It was first intended to keep this corps in reserve on the east

side of the Antietam, to operate on either flank or on the centre, 
as circumstances might require ; but on nearing Keedysville 
the strong opposition on the right, developed by the attacks 
of Hooker and Sumner, rendered it necessary at once to send 
this corps to the assistance of the right wing. 

On nearing the field, hearing that one of our batteries A, 
4th U. S. Artillery, commanded by Lieut. Thomas, who occupied 
the same position as Lieut. Woodruff's battery in the morning - 
was hotly engaged without supports, Gen. Smith sent two regi- 
ments to its relief from Gen. Hancock's brigade. On inspecting 




MCCLELLAN AT ANTIETAM. 

the ground Gen. Smith ordered the other regiments of Han- 
cock's brigade, with Frank's and Cowen's batteries, ist N. Y. 
Artillery, to the threatened position. Lieut. Thomas and Capt. 
Cothran, cc-mmanding batteries, bravely held their positions 
against the advancing enemy, handling their batteries with skill. 
Finding the enemy still advancing, the 3d brigade of Smith's 
division, commanded by Col. Irvin, 49th Penn. volunteers, was 
ordered up, and passed through Lieut. Thomas's battery, charged 
upon the enemy, and drove back the advance until abreast of the 



6OO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Dunker church. As the right of the brigade came opposite the 
woods it received a destructive fire, which checked the advance 
and threw the brigade somewhat into confusion. It formed again 
behind a rise of ground in the open space in advance of the bat- 
teries. 

Gen. French having reported to Gen. Franklin that his am- 
munition was nearly expended, that officer ordered Gen. Brooks, 
with his brigade, to reinforce him. Gen. Brooks formed his bri- 
gade on the right of Gen. French, where they remained dur- 
ing the remainder of the day and night, frequently under the 
fire of the enemy's artillery. 

It was soon after the brigade of Col. Irvin had fallen back 
behind the rise of ground that the yth Me., by order of Col. 
Irvin, made the gallant attack already referred to. 

The advance of Gen. Franklin's corps was opportune. The 
attack of the enemy on this position, but for the timely arrival 
of his corps, must have been disastrous, had it succeeded in 
piercing the line between Gens. Sedgwick's and French's divi- 
sions. 

Gen. Franklin ordered two brigades of Gen. Slocum's divi- 
sion, Gen. Newton's and Col. Torbert's, to form in column to 
assault the woods that had been so hotly contested before by 
Gens. Sumner and Hooker ; Gen. Bartlett's brigade was or- 
dered to form as a reserve. At this time Gen. Sumner, having 
command on the right, directed further offensive operations 
to be postponed, as the repulse of this, the only remaining 
corps available for attack, would peril the safety of the whole 
army. 

Gen. Porter's corps, consisting of Gen. Sykes's division of 
regulars and volunteers, and Gen. Morell's division of volun- 
teers, occupied a position on the east side of Antietam creek,. 
upon the main turnpike leading to Sharpsburg, and directly 
opposite the centre of the enemy's line. This corps filled the 
interval between the right wing and Gen. Burnside's command, 
and guarded the main approach from the enemy's position to 
our trains of supplies. 

It was necessary to watch this part of our line with the 
utmost vigilance, lest the enemy should take advantage of the 
first exhibition of weakness here to push upon us a vigorous 
-assault for the purpose of piercing our centre and turning our 



ANTIETAM. 



60 1 



rear, as well as to capture or destroy our supply-trains. Once 
having penetrated this line, the enemy's passage to our rear 
could have met with but feeble resistance, as there were no 
reserves to reinforce or close up the gap. 

Towards the middle of the afternoon, proceeding to the 
right, I found that Sumner's, Hooker's, and Mansfield's corps 
had met with serious losses. Several general officers had been 
carried from the field severely wounded, and the aspect of affairs 
was anything but promising. At the risk of greatly exposing 
our centre, I ordered two brigades from Porter's corps, the only 
available troops, to reinforce the right. Six battalions of Sykes's 
regulars had been thrown across the Antietam bridge on the 
main road, to attack and drive back the enemy's sharpshooters, 
who were annoying Pleasonton's horse-batteries in advance of 
the bridge. Warren's brigade, of Porter's corps, was detached 
to hold a position on Burnside's right and rear ; so that Porter 
was left at one time with only a portion of Sykes's division and 
one small brigade of Morell's division (but little over 3,000 
men) to hold his important position. 

Gen. Sumner expressed the most decided opinion against 
another attempt during that day to assault the enemy's position 
in front, as portions of our troops were so much scattered and 
demoralized. In view of these circumstances, after making 
changes in the position of some of the troops, I directed the 
different commanders to hold their positions, and, being satis- 
fied that this could be done without the assistance of the two 
brigades from the centre, I countermanded the order, which was 
in course of execution. 

Gen. Slocum's division replaced a portion of Gen. Sumner's 
troops, and positions were selected for batteries in front of the 
woods. The enemy opened several heavy fires of artillery on 
the position of our troops after this, but our batteries soon 
silenced them. 

On the morning of the zyth Gen. Pleasonton, with his cav- 
alry division and the horse-batteries, under Capts. Robertson, 
Tidball, and Lieut. Haines, of the 2d Artillery, and Capt. Gibson, 
3d Artillery, was ordered to advance on the turnpike towards 
Sharpsburg, across bridge No. 2, and support the left of Gen. 
Sumner's line. The bridge being covered by a fire of artillery 
and sharpshooters, cavalry skirmishers were thrown out, and 



602 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

Capt. Tidball's battery advanced by piece and drove off the 
sharpshooters with canister sufficiently to establish the batteries 
above mentioned, which opened on the enemy with effect. The 
firing was kept up for about two hours, when, the enemy's fire 
slackening, the batteries were relieved by Randall's and Van 
Reed's batteries, U. S. Artillery. About three o'clock Tidball, 
Robertson, and Haines returned to their positions on the west 
of Antietam, Capt. Gibson having been placed in position on 
the east side to guard the approaches to the bridge. These 
batteries did good service, concentrating their fire on the col- 
umn of the enemy about to attack Gen. Hancock's position, and 
compelling it to find shelter behind the hills in rear. 

Gen. Sykes's division had been in position since the i5th, 
exposed to the enemy's artillery and sharpshooters. Gen. Morell 
had come up on the i6th, and relieved Gen. Richardson on the 
right of Gen. Sykes. Continually under the vigilant watch of 
the enemy, this corps guarded a vital point. 

The position of the batteries under Gen. Pleasonton being 
one of great exposure, the battalion of the 2d and loth U. S. 
Infantry, under Capt. Pollard, 2d Infantry, was sent to his sup- 
port. Subsequently four battalions of regular infantry, under 
Capt. Dryer, 4th Infantry, were sent across to assist in driving 
off the sharpshooters of the enemy. 

The battalion of the 2d and loth Infantry, advancing far 
beyond the batteries, compelled the cannoneers of a battery of 
the enemy to abandon their guns. Few in numbers, and unsup- 
ported, they were unable to bring them off. The heavy loss 
of this small body of men attests their gallantry. 

The troops of Gen. Burnside held the left of the line opposite 
bridge No. 3. The attack on the right was to have been sup- 
ported by an attack on the left. Preparatory to this attack, on 
the evening of the i6th, Gen. Burnside's corps was moved for- 
ward and to the left, and took up a position nearer the bridge. 

I visited Gen. Burnside's position on the i6th, and, after 
pointing out to him the proper dispositions to be made of his 
troops during the day and night, informed him that he would 
probably be required to attack the enemy's right on the fol- 
lowing morning, and directed him to make careful reconnois- 
sances. 

Gen. Burnside's corps, consisting of the divisions of Gens. 






A N TIE T AM. 603 

Cox, Wilcox, Rodman, and Sturgis, was posted as follows : Col. 
Crook's brigade, Cox's division, on the right, Gen. Sturgis's 
division immediately in rear ; on the left was Gen. Rodman's 
division, with Gen. Scammon's brigade, Cox's division, in sup- 
port. 

Gen. Wilcox's division was held in reserve. The corps 
bivouacked in position on the night of the i6th. 

Early on the morning off the ijth I ordered Gen. Burnside 
to form his troops and hold them in readiness to assault the 
bridge in his front, and to await further orders. 

At eight o'clock an order was sent to him by Lieut. Wilson, 
topographical engineers, to carry the bridge, then to gain posses- 
sion of the heights beyond, and to advance along their crest 
upon Sharpsburg and its rear. 

After some time had elapsed, not hearing from him, I de- 
spatched an aide to ascertain what had been done. The aide 
returned with the information that but little progress had been 
made. I then sent him back with an order to Gen. Burnside 
to assault the bridge at once and carry it at all hazards. The 
aide returned to me a second time with the report that the bridge 
was still in the possession of the enemy. Whereupon I directed, 
Col. Sackett, inspector-general, to deliver to Gen. Burnside my 
positive order to push forward his troops without a moment's,, 
delay, and, if necessary, to carry the bridge at the point of the 
bayonet ; and I ordered Col. Sackett to remain with Gen. Burn- 
side and see that the order was executed promptly. 

After these three hours' delay the bridge was carried at one 
o'clock by a brilliant charge of the 5ist N. Y. and 5ist Penn. 
Volunteers. Other troops were then thrown over and the oppo- 
site bank occupied, the enemy retreating to the heights beyond. 

A halt was then made by Gen. Burnside's advance until 
three P.M. ; upon hearing which I directed one of my aides, 
Col. Key, to inform Gen. Burnside that I desired him to push 
forward his troops with the utmost vigor and carry the ene- 
my's position on the heights ; that the movement was vital to 
our success ; that this was a time when we must not stop for 
loss of life, if a great object could thereby be accomplished ; 
that if, in his judgment, his attack would fail, to inform me so 
at once, that his troops might be withdrawn and used eisewhere 
on the field. He replied that he would soon advance, and would 

45 



604 McCLELLAX'S OWN STORY. 

go up the hill as far as a battery of the enemy on the left would 
permit. Upon this report I again immediately sent Col. Key 
to Gen. Burnside with orders to advance at once, if possible to 
flank the battery, or storm it and carry the heights ; repeating 
that if he considered the movement impracticable, to inform 
me, so that his troops might be recalled. The advance was 
then gallantly resumed, the enemy driven from the guns, the 
heights handsomely carried, and a portion of the troops even 
reached the outskirts of Sharpsburg. By this time it was nearly 
dark, and strong reinforcements just then reaching the enemy 
from Harper's Ferry attacked Gen. Burnside's troops on their left 
flank, and forced them to retire to a lower line of hills nearer 
the bridge. 

If this important movement had been consummated two 
hours earlier, a position would have been secured upon the 
heights from which our batteries might have enfiladed the greater 
part of the enemy's line, and turned their right and rear. Our 
victory might thus have been much more decisive. 

The ground held by Burnside beyond the bridge was so 
strong that he ought to have repulsed the attack and held his 
own. He never crossed the bridge in person ! 

The following is the substance of Gen. Burnside's operations, 
as given in his report : 

Col. Crook's brigade was ordered to storm the bridge. This 
bridge, No. 3, is a stone structure of three arches, with stone 
parapets. The banks of the stream on the opposite side are 
precipitous, and command the eastern approaches to the bridge. 
On the hill-side immediately by the bridge was a stone fence 
running parallel to the stream. The turns of the roadway as it 
wound up the hill were covered by rifle-pits and breastworks of 
rails, etc. These works and the woods that covered the slopes 
were filled with the enemy's riflemen, and batteries were in posi- 
tion to enfilade the bridge and its approaches. 

Gen. Rodman was ordered to cross the ford below the bridge. 
From Col. Crook's position it was found impossible to carry the 
bridge. 

Gen. Sturgis was ordered to make a detail from his division 
for that purpose. He sent forward the 2d Md. and 6th N. H. 
These regiments made several successive attacks in the most 
gallant style, but were driven back. 



AN TIE T AM. 605 

The artillery of the left were ordered to concentrate their fire 
on the woods above the bridge. Col. Crook brought a section 
of Capt. Simmons's battery to a position to command the bridge. 
The 5ist N. Y. and 5ist Penn. were then ordered to assault the 
bridge. Taking advantage of a small spur of the hills which 
ran parallel to the river, they moved towards the bridge. From 
the crest of this spur they rushed with bayonets fixed and cleared 
the bridge. 

The division followed the storming party; also the brigade 
of Col. Crook as support. The enemy withdrew to still higher 
ground some five or six hundred yards beyond, and opened a 
fire of artillery on the troops in the new positions on the crest 
of the hill above the bridge. 

Gen. Rodman's division succeeded in crossing the ford after 
a sharp fire of musketry and artillery, and joined on the left of 
Sturgis ; Scammon's brigade crossing as support. Gen. Wilcpx's 
division was ordered across to take position on Gen. Sturgis's 
right. 

These dispositions being completed about three o'clock, the 
command moved forward, except Sturgis's division left in reserve. 
Clark's and Darell's batteries accompanied Rodman's division, 
Cooke's battery with Wilcox's division, and a section of Simmons's 
battery with Col. Crook's brigade. A section of Simmons's bat- 
tery, and Muhlenberg's and McMullan's batteries, were in posi- 
tion. The order for the advance was obeyed by the troops with 
alacrity. Gen. Wilcox's division, with Crook in support, moved 
up on both sides of the turnpike leading from the bridge to 
Sharpsburg ; Gen. Rodman's division, supported by Scammon's 
brigade, on the left of Gen. Wilcox. The enemy retreated before 
the advance of the troops. The 9th N. Y., of Gen. Rodman's 
division, captured one of the enemy's batteries and held it for 
some time. As the command was driving the enemy to the main 
heights on the left of the town, the light division of Gen. A. P. 
Hill arrived upon the field of battle from Harper's Ferry, and 
with a heavy artillery- fire made a strong attack on the extreme 
left. To meet this attack the left division diverged from the 
line of march intended, and opened a gap between it and the 
right. To fill up this it was necessary to order the troops from 
the second line. During these movements Gen. Rodman was 
mortally wounded. Col. Harland's brigade, of Gen. Rodman's 



606 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

division, was driven back. Col. Scammon's brigade, by a change 
of front to rear on his right flank, saved the left from being 
driven completely in. The fresh troops of the enemy pouring in, 
and the accumulation of artillery against this command, destroy- 
ed all hope of its being able to accomplish anything more. 

It was now nearly dark. Gen. Sturgis was ordered forward 
to support the left. Notwithstanding the hard work in the 
early part of the day, his division moved forward with spirit. 
With its assistance the enemy were checked and held at bay. 

The command was ordered to fall back by Gen. Cox, who 
commanded on the field the troops engaged in this affair beyond 
the Antietam. 

Night closed the long and desperately contested battle of 
the i yth. Nearly two hundred thousand men and five hun- 
dred pieces of artillery were for fourteen hours engaged in this 
memorable battle. We had attacked the enemy in a position 
selected by the experienced engineer then in person directing 
their operations. We had driven them from their line on one 
flank, and secured a footing within it on the other. The Army 
of the Potomac, notwithstanding the moral effect incident to 
previous reverses, had achieved a victory over an adversary in- 
vested with the prestige of recent success. Our soldiers slept 
that night conquerors on a field won by their valor and covered 
with the dead and wounded of the enemy. 

Thirteen guns, 39 colors, upwards of 15,000 stands of small 
arms, and more than 6,000 prisoners were the trophies which 
attest the success of our arms in the battles of South Moun- 
tain, Crampton's Gap, and Antietam. Not a single gun or color 
was lost by our army during these battles. 

When I was on the right* on the afternoon of the iyth I 
found the troops a good deal shaken that is, some of them who 
had been in the early part of the action. Even Sedgwick's divi- 
sion commenced giving way under a few shots from a battery 
that suddenly commenced firing from an unexpected position. 
I had to ride in and rally them myself. Sedgwick had been 
carried off very severely wounded. The death of Mansfield, 
the wounding of Hooker, Richardson, and Sedgwick, were irre- 
parable losses in that part of the field. It was this afternoon, 
when I was on the right, that on the field of battle I gave Han- 
cock a division that of Richardson, who was mortally wounded. 



BURN SIDE'S FAILURE. 607 

Early next morning (the i8th) Burnside sent to ask me for a 
fresh division to enable him to hold his own. I sent word that 
I could send none until I came myself to see the state of affairs, 
and in a few minutes rode over, there and carefully examined 
the position. Burnside told me that his men were so demoral- 
ized and so badly beaten the day before that were they attacked 
they would give way. I told him I could see no evidences of 
that, but that I would lend him Morell's division for a short time, 
though I would probably need it again elsewhere in a few hours. 
I instructed him to place one brigade on some heights that ran 
across the valley on our left, in order to cover the left flank, the 
rest on the heights in rear of the bridge, to cover the retreat of 
his men, should that prove necessary. The 'division was accord- 
ingly sent to him, and towards evening I learned that he had 
thrown it across the river and withdrawn his own men, his excuse 
to me being that he could not trust his men on the other side ! 
The evening before he was at my headquarters, and told some 
of my aides that his men were badly beaten. 

Long afterwards I learned from Col. Grif. Stedman (nth 
Conn, regiment) that on the night of the iyth he was with his 
then colonel (Kingsbury), who was mortally wounded and lying 
in a house on our side of the bridge, close to it. Burnside came 
by and gave orders for the wounded to be removed still further 
to the rear, stating that the corps were entirely defeated and 
demoralized, and that the house in question would soon be occu- 
pied by the enemy, As Kingsbury was in no condition to be 
removed, Stedman determined to remain with him and share his 
fate. It is needless to say that the house was not occupied by 
the enemy, and that "Burnside was in no condition to know the 
real state of his command, as he had not been with it. But I 
have mentioned enough to show what his real opinions and state 
of mind were on the evening of the iyth and the morning of the 
1 8th. Yet in face of all this he subsequently testified before the 
Committee on the Conduct of the War that he had on the 
morning of the i8th asked me for the reinforcement of a divi- 
sion to enable him to renew the attack, stating at the same time 
that his men were in superb condition, ready for any work, and 
that I had committed a great error in not renewing the battle 
early on the morning of the i8th. The real facts, so far as 
Burnside was concerned, were as I have given them above. But 



608 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

although his men were not, perhaps, in magnificent condition, 
they were by no means so demoralized as he represented them 
to be. I cannot, from my long acquaintance with Burnside, 
believe that he would deliberately lie, but I think that his 
weak mind was turned ; that he was confused in action ; and 
that subsequently he really did not know what had occurred, 
and was talked by his staff into any belief they chose. 

I have only adverted to the very pernicious effects of Burn- 
side's inexcusable delay in attacking the bridge and the heights 
in rear. What is certain is that if Porter or Hancock had been 
in his place the town of Sharpsburg would have been ours, 
Hill would have been thrown back into the Potomac, and the 
battle of Antietam would have been very decisive in its results. 

[In a monograph prepared by Gen. William B. Franklin, " IN 
MEMORY OF GENERAL MCCLELLAN," that distinguished soldier 
thus speaks of the Maryland campaign and its results, and spe- 
cially of the result of the battle of Antietam : 

"Without orders placing him in command other than the 
verbal request of the President, and without orders of any kind 
from any one, he started on the Maryland campaign to find the 
enemy, who had been so foolish as to invade a State which had 
remained true to the Union. The victories of Turner's and 
Crampton's gaps of South Mountain, and of Antietam, were the 
results, the last battle followed by the hurried retreat of Gen. 
Lee beyond the Potomac. History will some day tell why the 
Confederate army was not driven into the Potomac instead of 
across it. It will show that its escape was not due to want of 
generalship of the commanding general, nor to the absence of 
necessary orders to subordinates." 

At the time of his death Gen. McClellan was about to write a 
condensed account of the battle of Antietam for the Century 
magazine. He had reviewed the events preceding South Moun- 
tain when his pen was arrested. From among the papers found 
lying on his writing-table, where he had left them four hours 
before his death, the editor regards the letters of Gen. Sackett, 
which here follow, as important to be published for the purposes 
of that history which has not heretofore been written.]

LETTERS FROM GEN. SACKETT. 



609 



"FEB. 20, 1876. 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : In reply to your note I will state 
that, at about nine o'clock on the morning of the battle of Antie- 
tam, you told me to mount my horse and to proceed as speedily 
as possible with orders directing Gen. Burnside to move his 
troops across the bridge or stream in his front at once, and then 
to push them forward vigorously, without a moment's delay, to 
secure the heights beyond. 

"You moreover directed me to remain with Gen. Burnside 
until I saw his troops well under way up the heights in the direc- 
tion of Sharpsburg, and then to return and report to you. 

" I started at once, .as fast as my horse could carry me. I 
found Gen. Burnside on an elevated point (near the position of 
Lieut. Benjamin's 2o-pounder battery) commanding an extensive 
view of the battle-field. I gave him your orders, which seemed 
to annoy him somewhat, as he said to me : * McClellan appears 
to think I am not trying my best to carry this bridge ; you are 
the third or fourth one who has been to me this morning with 
similar orders.' I told him I knew you were exceedingly anx- 
ious, and regarded his getting across the stream and moving on 
Sharpsburg with rapidity and vigor at once as of vital impor- 
tance to a complete success. 

" Gen. Burnside ordered assaults to be made on the bridge, 
which were for a long time unsuccessful. I had been at his 
headquarters for fully three hours when Col. Key arrived from 
your headquarters with positive orders to push across the bridge 
and to move rapidly up the heights ; to carry the bridge at the 
point of the bayonet, if necessary, and not stop for loss of life, 
as sacrifices must be made in favor of success. 

"As soon as Col. Key had gone I suggested to Gen. Burn- 
side, were he to go down near the bridge, his presence among 
the troops could have the effect to encourage and stimulate the 
men to renewed efforts. He said he would, and immediately 
mounted his horse and rode in the direction of the bridge, but 
soon returned saying the bridge had been carried and the troops 
were crossing over as rapidly as possible. He likewise men- 
tioned at this time that Col. Henry Kingsbury had been mortally 
wounded in the assault on the bridge. 

" Gen. Burnside at once issued instructions for the move in 
the direction of Sharpsburg, but for some unaccountable reason 
things moved slowly and there was a long delay in getting the 
troops in motion. 

" Col. Key again returned with instructions to Gen. Burnside 
to push forward his troops rapidly and with vigor, to secure the 
heights, as every moment gained was of the utmost importance 
to our success. 



6lO McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

" I remained with Gen. Burnside until his troops were well, 
and seemingly successfully, under way up the heights they hav- 
ing gallantly driven the enemy from the field for fully one-half 
the distance in the direction of Sharpsburg. 

" Seeing this, and everything apparently going well, I returned 
to headquarters, where I found Gen. Fitz-John Porter, you being 
away temporarily on a , visit to the right of the battle-field. It 
was at this time past four o'clock in the afternoon. 

*' It was not long after this that the check and repulse of 
Gen. Burnside's advance was witnessed. 

" Often since that time I have thought what a serious mis- 
fortune was the death of the noble and energetic Reno. Had 
not that chivalric soldier fallen at South Mountain, Antietam 
certainly would have been in its results a very different affair. 
It would have been one of the most, if not the most, complete 
and important battle of the war. 

" I am, general, very truly yours, 

" D. B. SACKETT, 
" Inspector-Gen., U. S. A. 

11 To Gen. GEO. B. MCCLELLAN." 

" NEW YORK CITY, March 9, 1876. 

" MY DEAR GENERAL : I will state, in respect to a conversa- 
tion had in my presence between Gen. Burnside and your- elf, 
that late in the evening of the day of the battle of Antietam I 
was with you in your tent when Gen. Burnside entered. The 
position occupied, and the condition of his command, became 
at once the topic of conversation with you two. 

" As I understood the matter, Gen. Burnside desired to with- 
draw his troops to the left bank of the stream, giving as a reason 
for the move the dispirited condition of his men ; stating fur- 
ther that if he remained in his present position and an attack 
was made by the enemy, he very much feared the result. 

" You replied : * General, your troops must remain where they 
are and must hold their ground.' Gen. Burnside then said : * If 
I am to hold this position at all hazards I must be largely rein- 
forced ' and, if not much mistaken, he mentioned the number 
of men necessary for the purpose at 5,000. 

" You then replied (with emphasis) : * General, I expect you 
to hold your own, and with the force now under your command/ 

" At this point other general officers arrived, and I left the 
tent and heard nothing more of the conversation. 

"Afterward, in looking over Gen. Burnside ? s testimony before 
the Committee on the Conduct of the War, I was a good deal 
surprised to read : 

" 1 1 went to Gen. McClellan's tent, and in course of conversa- 
tion I expressed the same opinion (that the attack might be 
renewed the next morning at five o'clock), and told him that if 



JBUXNSIDE'S STA 1'EMENTS. 6 I I 

I could have 5,000 fresh troops to pass in advance of my line 
I would be willing to commence the attack on the next morn- 
ing.' 

" This statement brought back to my mind vividly that even- 
ing's conversation after Antietam. The conversation between 
Gen. Burnside and yourself, as I heard it, and Gen. Burnside's 
testimony before the committee, differ widely. 

" I may be mistaken, but it has always appeared to me that 
the conversation to which I was a witness, and the statement made 
before the War Committee, must have referred to one and the 
same matter the righting condition of Gen. Burnside's command 
on the night after the battle of Antietam. 
" I am, general, very truly yours, 

" D. B. SACKETT, 

"Inspector-Gen. U. S. A.

CHAPTER XXXVII. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[Sept. 15 to Oct. i, 1862.] 

Telegram Headquarters, Army of the Potomac, Sept. 15. 
We have carried the heights near here after a hard engagement, 
and gained a glorious victory. All your particular friends well. 

Sept. 15, Monday, 9.30 A.M., Bolivar. . . . Just sent you a 
telegram informing you that we yesterday gained a glorious and 
complete victory ; every moment adds to its importance. I am 
pushing everything after them with the greatest rapidity, and 
expect to gain great results. I thank God most humbly for His 
great mercy. How glad I am for my country that it is delivered 
from immediate peril ! I am about starting with the pursuit and 
must close this. ... If I can believe one-tenth of what is 
reported, God has seldom given an army a greater victory than 
this. . . . 

Telegram Near Sharpsburg, Sept. 16, 1862, 7 A.M. Have 
reached thus far, and have no doubt delivered Pennsylvania and 
Maryland. Army in excellent spirits. 

Sept. 1 8, 8 A.M., camp near Sharpsburg. . . . We fought 
yesterday a terrible battle against the entire rebel army. The 
battle continued fourteen hours and was terrific ; the fighting on 
both sides was superb. The general result was in our favor ; 
that is to say, we gained a great deal of ground and held it. It 
was a success, but whether a decided victory depends upon what 
occurs to-day. I hope that God has given us a great success. It 
is all in His hands, and there I am content to leave it. The 
spectacle yesterday was the grandest I could conceive of ; no- 
thing could be more sublime. Those in whose judgment I rely 
tell me that I fought the battle splendidly and that it was a 
masterpiece of art. I am well-nigh tired out by anxiety and 

612 






PRIVATE LETTERS. 613 

want of sleep. God has been good in sparing the lives of 
all my staff. Gens. Hooker, Sedgwick, Dana, Richardson, and 
Hartsuff, and several other general officers, wounded. Mansfield 
is dead, I fear, but am not certain. I just learn that he is not 
mortally wounded. 

Sept. 20, 8 A.M., camp near Sharpsburg. . . . Yesterday the 
enemy completed his evacuation of Maryland, completely beaten. 
We got many prisoners, muskets, colors, cannon, etc. His loss in 
killed and wounded was very great ; so was ours, unfortunately. 

Gen. Mansfield was killed (or rather died of his wounds). 
Gens. Sedgwick, Richardson, Dana, Brooks, Hooker, Weber, 
Rodman, and two others were wounded on Wednesday. Poor 
Henry Kingsbury died of his wounds the day after the battle. 
The battle lasted fourteen hours, and was, without doubt, the 
most severe ever fought on this continent ; and few more des- 
perate were ever fought anywhere. 

9 A.M. . . . Am glad to say that I am much better to-day ; 
for, to tell you the truth, I have been under the weather since the 
battle. The want of rest, and anxiety, brought on my old disease. 
The battle of Wednesday was a terrible one. I presume the loss 
will prove not less than 10,000 on each side. Our victory was 
complete, and the disorganized rebel army has rapidly returned 
to Virginia, its dreams of "invading Pennsylvania" dissipated 
for ever. I feel some little pride in having, with a beaten and 
demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly and saved the North 
so completely. Well, one of these days history will, I trust, do 
me justice in deciding that it was not my fault that the campaign 
of the Peninsula was not successful. . . . Since I left Washing- 
ton, Stanton has again asserted that /, not Pope, lost the battle 
of Manassas No. 2 ! ... I am tired of fighting against such dis- 
advantages, and feel that it. is now time for the country to come 
to my help and remove these difficulties from my path. If my 
countrymen will not open their eyes and assist themselves they 
must pardon me if I decline longer to pursue the thankless 
avocation of serving them. 

Sept. 20, 9 P.M., camp near Sharpsburg. ... I feel that I 
have done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. If 
I continue in its service I have at least thfe right to demand 



614 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

a guarantee that I shall not be interfered with. I know I can- 
not have that assurance so long as Stanton continues in the posi- 
tion of Secretary of War and Halleck as general-in-chief. . . . 
I can retire from the service for sufficient reasons without leaving 
any stain upon my reputation. I feel now that this last short 
campaign is a sufficient legacy for our child, so far as honor 
is concerned. . . . You should see my soldiers now ! You never 
saw anything like their enthusiasm. It surpasses anything you 
ever imagined. . . . My tent is filled quite to overflowing with 
trophies in the way of captured secesh battle-flags. We have 
more than have been taken in all battles put together, and all 
sorts of inscriptions on them. . . . 

Sept. 21, Sunday, A.M. ... Do you know that I have not 
heard one word from Halleck, the President, nor the Secretary 
of War about the last great battle ! All, except fault-finding, 
that I have had since leaving Washington was one from the 
President about the Sunday battle, in which he says, "God bless 
you and all with you ! " That is all I have ; but plenty from 
Halleck couched in almost insulting language and prophesying 
disaster ! I telegraphed him last night that I regretted the 
uniformly fault-finding tone of his despatches, and that he 
had not as yet found leisure to notice the recent achieve- 
ments of my army. . . . 

Sept. 22, 9 A.M. ... I rode out on the battle-field yester- 
day. The burial of the dead is by this time completed ; and a 
terrible work it has been, for the slain counted by thousands on 
each side. ... I look upon this campaign as substantially end- 
ed, and my present intention is to seize Harper's Ferry and hold 
it with a strong force ; then go to work and reorganize the army 
ready for another campaign. ... I shall not go to Washington, 
if I can help it, but will try to reorganize the army somewhere 
near Harper's Ferry or Frederick. ... It may be that, now that 
the government is pretty well over their scare, they will begin 
again with their persecutions and throw me overboard again. I 
don't care if they do. I have the satisfaction of knowing that 
God has, in His mercy, a second time made me the instrument 
for saving the nation, and am content with the honor that has 
fallen to my lot. ! have seen enough of public life. No motive 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 615 

of ambition can now retain me in the service. The only thing 
that can keep me there will be the conviction that my country 
needs my services and that circumstances make it necessary for 
me to render them. I am confident that the poison still rankles 
in the veins of my enemies at Washington, and that so long as 
they live it will remain there. ... I have received no papers con- 
taining the news of the last battle, and do not know the effect it 
has produced on the Northern mind. I trust it has been a good 
one, and that I am re-established in the confidence of the best 
people of the nation. . . . Everything quiet to-day ; not a shot 
fired as yet. I am moving troops down to Harper's Ferry, 
and hope to occupy it to-morrow. Then I will have the 
Potomac clear. . . . 

Sept. 23, Tuesday, 8 A.M., Sharpsburg camp. . . . The 
weather is splendid, though I should like a little rain to raise 
the Potomac slightly. We are all well. I am entirely well now, 
and rather better for my little attack of illness. . . . 

Sept. 25, 7.30 A.M. . . . We are so near the mountains 
that it is quite cold at night. ... I think the health of our men 
is improving much : they look a great deal better than they did 
on the Peninsula ; eyes look brighter and faces better. . . . My 
plans are not easily given, for I really do not know whether I am 
to do as I choose or not. I shall keep on doing what seems best 
until brought up with a round turn. My own judgment is to 
watch the line of the Potomac until the water rises, then to con- 
centrate everything near Harper's Ferry, reorganize the army as 
promptly as possible, and then if secesh remains near Winchester 
to attack him. If he retires, to follow him up and attack him 
near Richmond. ... It is very doubtful whether I shall remain 
in the service after the rebels have left this vicinity. The Presi- 
dent's late proclamation, the continuation of Stanton and Halleck 
in office, render it almost impossible for me to retain my commis- 
sion and self-respect at the^ same time. . . . It is a mercy of God 
that none of my staff have been hit, considering how much they 
have been exposed to danger. They have had plenty of horses 
killed, sabres hit, clothes cut, etc., but have thus far escaped 
unhurt. . . . Am going on a visit to Harper's Ferry this morn- 
ing. ... 



6l6 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Sept. 26, 10.30 P.M., Sharpsburg camp. . . . Pretty well 
tired out by a long ride to Harper's Ferry to-day. I rode down 
in my ambulance, but when there took a long and fatiguing ride 
on horseback over the Maryland Heights to determine upon the 
question of its defence. I did not have time to go over the 
Virginia side, but propose doing that to-morrow. Our camp 
will be thrown a little down in that direction to-morrow, so I 
shall not have quite so far to travel in returning. ... It is so 
cool this evening that I have a fire in front of my tent and am 
sitting in my overcoat. . . . 

Sept. 29, Sharpsburg, A.M. ... I think secesh has gone to 
Winchester. The last I heard last night was to that effect. If 
he has gone there I will be able to arrange my troops more with 
a view to comfort, and, if it will only rain a little so as to raise 
the river, will feel quite justified in asking for a short leave. . . . 
We are having very fine weather. . . . Not yet even have I a 
word from any one in Washington about the battle of the Antie- 
tam, and nothing in regard to South Mountain, except from the 
President in the following : " Your despatch received. God 
bless you and all with you ! Can't you beat them some more 
before they get off ? " I don't look for any thanks. 

P.M. I have been hard at work all day upon a preliminary 
report of the recent battles, and find that, in order to arrive at 
anything like the truth, I must to-morrow take all my aides to 
the ground and talk with them there. I would really prefer 
fighting three battles to writing the report of one. You can 
hardly imagine the difficulties of such a task. You are neces- 
sarily combating the amour propre of every officer concerned 
when you say one word in commendation of anybody else. I 
ought to treat Burnside very severely, and probably will ; yet I 
hate to do it. He is very slow ; is not fit to command more than 
a regiment. If I treat him as he deserves he will be my mortal 
enemy hereafter. If I do not praise him as he thinks he de- 
serves, and as I know he does not, ^e will be at least a very 
lukewarm friend. I mention this merely as an instance that 
you will comprehend. 

Oct. i, 7.30 A.M. ... A cloudy day. If it does not rain 
I think I will go to Williamsport and Hagerstown to-day, to see 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 6i; 

that part of the country ; for there is no telling but that I might 
have to fight a battle there one of these days, and it is very 
convenient to know the ground. In this last battle the rebels 
possessed an immense advantage in knowing every part of the 
ground, while I knew only what I could see from a distance. 
... I rode all over the battle-field again yesterday, so as to be 
sure that I understood it all before writing my report. I was 
but the more impressed with the great difficulties of the under- 
taking and the magnitude of the success. Did I tell you that 
our losses at South Mountain and Antietam amounted to within 
one or two hundred of 15,000 ; that we took some 6,000 pri- 
soners, 39 colors, 14 guns, 14,500 small arms, etc., etc.? Pretty 
fair trophies after a battle so stubbornly contested. . . . Yester- 
day I received at last a telegram from Halleck about the battle 
of Antietam. ... I don't know where we are drifting, but do 
not like the looks of things ; time will show. ... I do not yet 
know what are the military plans of the gigantic intellects at 
the head of the government. . . . 



CHAPTER XXXVIII. 

After the battle The position reviewed Condition of the army Re- 
organization and supply Visit of the President He approves 
McClellan's course Details of supplies needed and not received 
Shoes, clothing, blankets, tents, horses Dates of receipt of sup- 
plies Plans of advance into Virginia. 

THE night brought with it grave responsibilities. Whether 
to renew the attack on the i8th, or to defer it, even with the 
risk of the enemy's retirement, was the question before me. 

After a night of anxious deliberation and a full and careful 
survey of the situation and condition of our army, the strength 
and position of the enemy, I concluded that the success of an 
attack on the i8th was not certain. I am aware of the fact that, 
under ordinary circumstances, a general is expected to risk a 
battle if he has a reasonable prospect of success ; but at this 
critical juncture I should have had a narrow view of the con- 
dition of the country had I been willing to hazard another battle 
with less than an absolute assurance of success. At that moment 
Virginia lost, Washington menaced, Maryland invaded the 
national cause could afford no risks of defeat. One battle lost, 
and almost all would have been lost. Lee's army might then 
have marched as it pleased on Washington, Baltimore, Philadel- 
phia, or New York. It could have levied its supplies from a 
fertile and undevastated country ; extorted tribute from wealthy 
and populous cities ; and nowhere east of the Alleghanies was 
there another organized force able to arrest its march. 

The following are among the considerations which led me 
to doubt the certainty of success in attacking before the ipth : 

The troops were greatly overcome by the fatigue and exhaus- 
tion attendant upon the long-continued and severely contested 
battle of the i;th, together with the long day-and-night marches 
to which they, had been subjected during the previous three 
days. 

The supply-trains were in the rear, and many of the troops 
had suffered from hunger. They required rest and refresh- 
ment. 

618 



AFTER ANTIETAM. 



619 



One division of Sumner's and all of Hooker's corps on the 
right had, after righting most valiantly for several hours, been 
overpowered by numbers, driven back in great disorder, and 
much scattered, so that they were for the time somewhat demo- 
ralized. 

In Hooker's corps, according to the return made by Gen. 
Meade commanding, there were but 6,729 men present on the 
1 8th ; whereas on the morning of the 22d there were 13,093 
men present for duty in the same corps, showing that previous 
to and during the battle 6,364 men were separated from their 
command. 

Gen. Meade, in an official communication upon this subject, 
dated Sept. 18, 1862, says : 

" I enclose a field return of the corps, made this afternoon, 
which I desire you will lay before the commanding general. I 
am satisfied the great reduction in the corps since the recent 
engagements is not due solely to the casualties of battle, and 
that a considerable number of men are still in the rear, some 
having dropped out on the march, and many dispersing and 
leaving yesterday during the fight. I think the efficiency of the 
corps, so far as it goes, good. To resist an attack in our pre- 
sent strong position I think they may be depended on, and I 
hope they will perform duty in case we make an attack, though 
I do not think their morale is as good for an offensive as a 
defensive movement." 

One division of Sumner's corps had also been overpowered, 
and was a good deal scattered and demoralized. It was not 
deemed by its corps commander in proper condition to attack 
the enemy vigorously the next day. 

Some of the new troops on the left, although many of them 
fought well during the battle and are entitled to great credit, 
were, at the close of the action, driven back and their morale 
impaired. 

On the morning of the i8th Gen. Burnside, as before stated, 
requested me to send him another division to assist in holding 
his position on the other side of the Antietam, and to enable 
him to withdraw his corps if he should be attacked by a supe- 
rior force. 

A large number of our heaviest and most efficient batteries 
had consumed all their ammunition on the i6th and iyth and it 
was impossible to supply them until late on the following day. 
4 6 



620 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY, 

Supplies of provisions and forage had to be brought up and 
issued, and infantry ammunition distributed. 

Finally, reinforcements to the number of 14,000 men to say 
nothing of troops expected from Pennsylvania had not arrived, 
but were expected during the day. 

The 1 8th was, therefore, spent in collecting the dispersed, 
giving rest to the fatigued, removing the wounded, burying 
the dead, and the necessary preparations for a renewal of the 
battle. 

Of the reinforcements, Couch's division, marching with com- 
mendable rapidity, came up into position at a late hour in the 
morning. Humphreys' division of new troops, in their anxiety 
to participate in the battle which was raging, when they received 
the order to march from Frederick at about half-past three P.M. 
on the T yth, pressed forward during the entire night, and the 
mass of the division reached the army during the following morn- 
ing. Having marched more than 23 miles after half-past four 
o'clock on the preceding afternoon, they were, of course, greatly 
exhausted, and needed rest and refreshment. Large reinforce- 
ments expected from Pennsylvania never arrived. During the 
1 8th orders were given for a renewal of the attack at daylight 
on the i Qth. 

On the night of the i8th the enemy, after passing troops in 
the latter part of the day from the Virginia shore to their posi- 
tion behind Sharpsburg, as seen by our officers, suddenly formed 
the design of abandoning their position and retreating across 
the river. As their line was but a short distance from the river, 
the evacuation presented but little difficulty, and was effected 
before daylight. 

About 2,700 of the enemy's dead were, under the direction of 
Maj. Davis, assistant inspector-general, counted and buried upon 
the battle-field of Antietam. A portion of their dead had been 
previously buried by them. 

When our cavalry advance reached the river on the morning 
of the i pth it was discovered that nearly all the enemy's forces 
had crossed into Virginia during the night, their rear escaping 
under cover of eight batteries placed in strong positions upon 
the elevated bluffs on the opposite bank. Gen. Porter, com- 
manding the 5th corps, ordered a detachment from Griffin's 
and Barnes's brigades, under Gen. Griffin, to cross the river at 



AFTER AN TIE TAM. 621 

dark and carry the enemy's batteries. This was gallantly done 
under the fire of the enemy ; several guns, caissons, etc., were 
taken, and their supports driven back half a mile. 

The information obtained during the progress of this affair 
indicated that the mass of the enemy had retreated on the 
Charlestown and Martinsburg roads towards Winchester. To 
verify this, and to ascertain how far the enemy had retired, 
Gen. Porter was authorized to detach from his corps, on the 
morning of the 2oth, a reconnoitring party in greater force. 
This detachment crossed the river and advanced about a mile, 
when it was attacked by a large body of the enemy lying in 
ambush in the woods, and driven back across the river with 
considerable loss. This reconnoissance showed that the enemy 
was still in force on the Virginia bank of the Potomac, pre- 
pared to resist our further advance. 

It was reported to me on the ipth that Gen. Stuart had 
made his appearance at Williamsport with some 4,000 cavalry 
and six pieces of artillery, and that 10,000 infantry were march- 
ing on the same point from the direction of Winchester. I 
ordered Gen. Couch to march at once with his division and a 
part of Pleasonton's cavalry, with Franklin's corps within sup- 
porting distance, for the purpose of endeavoring to capture this 
force. Gen. Couch made a prompt and rapid march to Williams- 
port, and attacked the enemy vigorously, but they made their 
escape across the river. 

I despatched the following telegraphic report to the general- 
in-chief : 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

SHARPSBURG, Sept. 19, 1862. 

I have the honor to report that Maryland is entirely freed 
from the presence of the enemy, who has been driven across the 
Potomac. No fears need now be entertained for the safety of 
Pennsylvania. I shall at once occupy Harper's Ferry. 

G. B. McCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 

Maj.-Gen. H. W. HALLECK, 

Commanding U. S. Army. 

On the following day, Sept. 20, I received this telegram from 
Gen. Halleck : 



622 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

" We are still left entirely in the dark in regard to your 
own movements and those of the enemy. This should not be 
so. You should keep me advised of both, so far as you know 
them." 

To which I answered as follows : 

Sept. 20. Your telegram of to-day is received. I telegraphed 
you yesterday all I knew, and had nothing more to inform you of 
until this evening. Williams's corps (Banks's) occupied Mary- 
land Heights at one P.M. to-day. The rest of the army is near 
here, except Couch's division, which is at this moment engaged 
with the enemy in front of Williamsport; the enemy is retiring, 
via Charlestown and Martinsburg, on Winchester. He last night 
reoccupied Williamsport by a small force, but will be out of it by 
morning. I think he has a force of infantry near Shepherdstown. 

I regret that you find it necessary to couch every despatch 
I have the honor to receive from you in a spirit of fault-finding, 
and that you have not yet found leisure to say one word in com- 
mendation of the recent achievements of this army, or even to 
allude to them. 

I have abstained from giving the number of guns, colors, 
small arms, prisoners, etc., captured, until I could do so with 
some accuracy. I hope by to-morrow evening to be able to 
give at least an approximate statement. 

On the same day I telegraphed as follows to Gen. Halleck : 

Sept. 20. As the rebel army, now on the Virginia side of the 
Potomac, must in a great measure be dependent for supplies of 
ammunition and provisions upon Richmond, I would respectfully 
suggest that Gen. Banks be directed to send out a cavalry force 
to cut their supply communication opposite Washington. This 
would seriously embarrass their operations, and will aid this army 
materially. 

Maryland Heights were occupied by Gen. Williams's corps 
on this day, and on the 22d Gen. Sumner took possession of 
Harper's Ferry. 

It will be remembered that at the time I was assigned to the 
command of the forces for the defence of the national capital, 
on the 2d day of Sept., 1862, the greater part of all the avail- 
able troops were suffering under the disheartening influences of 
the serious defeat they had encountered during the brief and un- 
fortunate campaign of Gen. Pope. Their numbers were greatly 



AFTER ANTIETAM. 623 

reduced by casualties, their confidence was much shaken, and 
they had lost something of that esprit de corps which is indis- 
pensable to the efficiency of an army. Moreover, they had 
left behind, lost, or worn out the greater part of their clothing 
and camp equipage, which required renewal before they could 
be in proper condition to take the field again. 

The intelligence that the enemy was crossing the Potomac 
into Maryland was received in Washington on the 4th of Sept., 
and the Army of the Potomac was again put in motion, under 
my direction, on the following day, so that but a very brief 
interval of time was allowed to reorganize or procure supplies. 

The sanguinary battles of South Mountain and Antietam, 
fought by this army a few days afterwards, with the reconnois- 
sances immediately following, resulted in a loss to us of ten gen- 
eral officers, many regimental and company officers, and a large 
number of enlisted men, amounting in the aggregate to (15,220) 
fifteen thousand two hundred and twenty. Two army corps had 
been badly cut up, scattered, and somewhat demoralized in the 
action of the lyth. 

In Gen. Sumner's corps alone, 41 commissioned officers and 
819 enlisted men had been killed ; 4 general officers, 89 other 
commissioned officers, and 3,708 enlisted men had been wounded, 
besides 548 missing ; making the aggregate loss of this splendid 
veteran corps, in this one battle, 5,209. 

In Gen. Hooker's corps the casualties of the same engage- 
ment amounted to 2,619. 

The entire army had been greatly exhausted by unavoidable 
overwork, fatiguing marches, hunger, and want of sleep and rest, 
previous to the last battle. 

When the enemy recrossed the Potomac into Virginia the 
means of transportation at my disposal were inadequate to fur- 
nish a single day's supply of subsistence in advance. 

Many of the troops were new levies, some of whom had 
fought like veterans, but the morale of others had been a good 
deal impaired in those severely contested actions, and they 
required time to recover, as well as to acquire the necessary 
drill and discipline. 

Under these circumstances I did not feel authorized to cross 
the river with the main army, over a very deep and difficult ford, 
in pursuit of the retreating enemy, known to be in strong force 



624 McCLELLAXT S OWN STORY. 

on the south bank, and thereby place that stream, which was 
liable at any time to rise above a fording stage, between my 
army and its base of supply. 

I telegraphed on the 226. to the general-in-chief as follows : 

As soon as the exigencies of the service will admit of it this 
army should be reorganized. It is absolutely necessary, to secure 
its efficiency, that the old skeleton regiments should be filled up 
at once and officers appointed to supply the numerous existing 
vacancies. There are instances where captains are command- 
ing regiments, and companies are without a single commissioned 
officer. 

On the 23d the following was telegraphed to the general-in- 
chief : 

From several different sources I learn that Gen. R. E. Lee is 
still opposite to my position, at Leestown, between Shepherds- 
town and Martinsburg, and that Gen. Jackson is on the Opequan 
creek, about three miles from its mouth, both with large force. 
There are also indications of heavy reinforcements moving to- 
wards them from Winchester and Charlestown. I have, there- 
fore, ordered Gen. Franklin to take position with his corps at the 
cross-roads about one mile northwest of Bakersville, on the 
Bakersville and Williamsport road, and Gen. Couch to establish 
his division near Downsville, leaving sufficient force at Williams- 
port to watch and guard the ford at that place. The fact of the 
enemy remaining so long in our front, and the indications of an 
advance of reinforcements, seem to indicate that he will give us 
another battle with all his available force. 

As I mentioned to you before, our army has been very much 
reduced by casualties in the recent battles, and in my judgment 
all the reinforcements of old troops that can possibly be dispensed 
with around Washington and other places should be instantly 
pushed forward by rail to this army. A defeat at this juncture 
would be ruinous to our cause. I cannot think it possible that 
the enemy will bring any forces to bear upon Washington till 
after the question is decided here ; but if he should, troops can 
soon be sent back from this army by rail to reinforce the garrison 
there. 

The evidence I have that reinforcements are coming to the 
rebel army consists in the fact that long columns of dust extend- 
ing from Winchester to Charlestown, and from Charlestown in 
this direction, and also troops moving this way, were seen last 
evening. This is corroborated by citizens. Gen. Sumner, with 
his corps and Williams's (Banks's), occupies Harper's Ferry and 



AFTER ANTIETAM, 



625 



the surrounding heights. I think he will be able to hold his 
position till reinforcements arrive. 

On the 27th I made the following report: 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
Sept. 27, 1862, 10 A.M. 

All the information in my possession goes to prove that the 
main body of the enemy is concentrated not far from Martins- 
burg, with some troops at Charlestown ; not many in Winches- 
ter. Their movements of late have been an extension towards 
our right and beyond it. They are receiving reinforcements in 
Winchester, mainly, I think, of conscripts perhaps entirely so. 

This army is not now in condition to undertake another cam- 
paign nor to bring on another battle, unless great advantages 
are offered by some mistake of the enemy, or pressing military 
exigencies render it necessary. We are greatly deficient in offi- 
cers. Many of the old regiments are reduced to mere skeletons. 
The new regiments need instruction. Not a day should be lost 
in filling the old regiments our main dependence and in sup- 
plying vacancies among the officers by promotion. 

My present purpose is to hold the army about as it is now, 
rendering Harper's Ferry secure and watching the river closely, 
intending to attack the enemy should he attempt to cross to this 
side. 

Our possession of Harper's Ferry gives us the great advantage 
of a secure debouch, but we cannot avail ourselves of it until the 
railroad bridge is finished, because we cannot otherwise supply a 
greater number of troops than we now have on the Virginia side 
at that point. When the river rises so that the enemy cannot 
cross in force, I purpose concentrating the army somewhere near 
Harper's Ferry, and then acting according to circumstances viz., 
moving on Winchester, if from the position and attitude of the 
enemy we are likely to gain a great advantage by doing so, or 
else devoting a reasonable time to the organization of the army 
and instruction of the new troops, preparatory to an advance on 
whatever line may be determined. In any event I regard it as 
absolutely necessary to send new regiments at once to the old 
corps, for purposes of instruction, and that the old regiments be 
filled at once. I have no fears as to an attack on Washington by 
the line of Manassas. Holding Harper's Ferry, as I do, they will 
not run the risk of an attack on their flank and rear while they 
have the garrison of Washington in their front. 

I rather apprehend a renewal of the attempt in Maryland, 
shoul^ the river remain low for a great length of time, and 
should they receive considerable addition to their force, 
would be glad to have Peck's division as soon as possible. I 
am surprised that Sigel's men should have been sent to Western 



626 MCCLELLAND s OWN STORY. 

Virginia without my knowledge. The last I heard from you on 
the subject was that they were at my disposition. In the last 
battles the enemy was undoubtedly greatly superior to us in 
number, and it was only by very hard righting that we gained 
the advantage we did. As it was, the result was at one period 
very doubtful, and we had all we could do to win the day. If 
the enemy receives considerable reinforcements and we none, 
it is possible that I may have too much on my hands in the next 
battle. My own view of the proper policy to be pursued is to retain 
in Washington merely the force necessary to garrison it, and to 
send everything else available to reinforce this army. The rail- 
ways give us the means of promptly reinforcing Washington, 
should it become necessary. If I am reinforced as I ask, and 
am allowed to take my own course, I will hold myself respon- 
sible for the safety of Washington. Several persons recently 
from Richmond say that there are no troops there except con- 
scripts, and they few in number. I hope to give you details as 
to late battles by this evening. I am about starting again for 
Harper's Ferry. 

G. B. McCLELLAN, Maj.-Gen. Commanding. 
Maj.-Gen. HALLECK, 

Gen.-in-Chief, Washington. 

The work of reorganizing, drilling, and supplying the army 
I began at the earliest moment. The different corps were sta- 
tioned along the river in the best positions to cover and guard 
the fords. The great extent of the river-front from near Wash- 
ington to Cumberland (some one hundred and fifty miles), 
together with the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was 
to be carefully watched and guarded, to prevent, if possible, the 
enemy's raids. Reconnoissances upon the Virginia side of the 
river, for the purpose of learning the enemy's positions and 
movements, were made frequently, so that our cavalry, which 
from the time we left Washington had performed the most 
laborious service, and had from the commencement been defi- 
cient in numbers, was found totally inadequate to the require- 
ments of the army. 

This overwork had broken down the greater part of the 
horses ; disease had appeared among them, and but a very small 
portion of our original cavalry force was fit for service. 

To such an extent had this arm become reduced that when 
Gen. Stuart made his raid into Pennsylvania on the nth of 
October with 2,000 men, I could only mount 800 men to follow 
him. 



MR. LINCOLN'S CONFIDENCE. 627 

Harper's Ferry was occupied on the 22d, and, in order to 
prevent a catastrophe similar to the one which had happened 
to Col. Miles, I immediately ordered Maryland, Bolivar, and 
Loudon Heights to be strongly fortified. This was done as far 
as the time and means at our disposal permitted. 

The main army of the enemy during this time remained in 
the vicinity of Martinsburg and Bunker Hill, and occupied itself 
in drafting and coercing every able-bodied citizen into the 
ranks, forcibly taking their property where it was not volun- 
tarily offered, burning bridges, and destroying railroads. 

On the first day of October his Excellency the President hon- 
ored the Army of the Potomac with a visit, and remained several 
days, during which he went through the different encampments, 
reviewed the troops, and went over the battle-fields of South 
Mountain and Antietam. I had the opportunity during this 
visit to describe to him the operations of the army since the 
time it left Washington, and gave him my reasons for not fol- 
lowing the enemy after he crossed the Potomac. 

He was accompanied by Gen. McClernand, John W. Gar- 
rett, the Secretary of State of Illinois, and others whom I have 
forgotten. During the visit we had many and long consulta- 
tions alone. I urged him to follow a conservative course, and 
supposed from the tenor of his conversation that he would 
do so. He more than once assured me that he was fully satis- 
fied with my whole course from the beginning ; that the only 
fault he could possibly find was that I was perhaps too prone 
to be sure that everything was ready before acting, but that 
my actions were all right when I started. I said to him that 
I thought a few experiments with those who acted before they 
were ready would probably convince him that in the end I con- 
sumed less time than they did. He told me that he regarded 
me as the only general in the service capable of organizing and 
commanding a large army, and that he would stand by me. 
We parted on the field of South Mountain, whither I had 
accompanied him. He said there that he did not see how we 
ever gained that field, and that he was sure that, if I had 
defended it, Lee could never have carried it. 

We spent some time on the battle-field and conversed fully 
on the state of affairs. He told me that he was entirely satisfied 
with me and with all that I had done ; that he would stand by 



628 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

me against " all comers " ; that he wished me to continue my 
preparations for a new campaign, not to stir an inch until fully 
ready, and when ready to do what I thought best. He repeated 
that he was entirely satisfied with me ; that I should be let alone ; 
that he would stand by me. I have no doubt that he meant 
exactly what he said. He parted from me with the utmost cor- 
diality. We never met again on this earth. 

He had hardly reached Washington before Cox's division 
was taken from me and the order of Oct. 6 reached me ! A 
singular commentary on the uncertainty of human affairs ! 

On the 5th of Oct. the division of Gen. Cox (about 5,000 
men) was ordered from my command to Western Virginia. 

On the yth of Oct. I received the following telegram from 
Gen. Halleck : 



" Oct. 6. I am instructed to telegraph you as follows : The 
President directs that you cross the Potomac and give battle to 
the enemy or drive him south. Your army must move now 
while the roads are good. If you cross the river between the 
enemy and Washington, and cover the latter by your operation, 
you can be reinforced with 30,000 men. If you move up the 
valley of the Shenandoah not more than 12,000 or 15,000 can 
be sent to you. The President advises the interior line between 
Washington and the enemy, but does not order it. He is very 
desirous that your army move as soon as possible. You will 
immediately report what line you adopt and when you intend 
to cross the river ; also to what point the reinforcements are to 
be sent. It is necessary that the plan of your operations be posi- 
tively determined on before orders are given for building bridges 
and repairing railroads. I am directed to add that the Secretary 
of War and the general-in-chief fully concur with the President 
in these instructions." 



On the loth of Oct. Stuart crossed the river at McCoy's Ferry 
with 2,000 cavalry and a battery of horse-artillery, on his raid 
into Maryland and Pennsylvania, making it necessary to use all 
our cavalry against him. This exhausting service completely 
broke down nearly all of our cavalry horses, and rendered a 
remount absolutely indispensable before we could advance on 
the enemy. 

At the time I received the order of Oct. 6 to cross the river 
and attack the enemy the army was wholly deficient in cavalry, 



SUPPLIES LACKING. 629 

and a large part of our troops were in want of shoes, blankets, 
and other indispensable articles of clothing, notwithstanding all 
the efforts that had been made since the battle of Antietam, and 
even prior to that date, to refit the army with clothing as well as 
horses. I at once consulted with Col. Ingalls, the chief-quarter- 
master, who believed that the necessary articles could be supplied 
in about three days. Orders were immediately issued to the 
different commanders who had not already sent in their requisi- 
tions to do so at once, and all the necessary steps were forthwith 
taken by me to insure a prompt delivery of the supplies. The 
requisitions were forwarded to the proper department at Wash- 
ington, and I expected that the articles would reach our depots 
during the three days specified ; but day after day elapsed, and 
only a small portion of the clothing arrived. Corps commanders, 
upon receiving notice from the quartermasters that they might 
expect to receive their supplies at certain dates, sent the trains 
for them, which, after waiting, were compelled to return empty. 
Several instances occurred where these trains went back and 
forth from the camps to the depots as often as four or five dif- 
ferent times, without receiving their supplies, and I was informed 
by one corps commander that his wagon-train had travelled over 
one hundred and fifty miles, to and from the depots, before he 
succeeded in obtaining his clothing. 

The corps of Gen. Franklin did not get its clothing until after 
it had crossed the Potomac and was moving into Virginia. Gen. 
Reynolds's corps was delayed a day at Berlin to complete its sup- 
plies, and Gen. Porter only completed his on reaching the vicinity 
of Harper's Ferry. 

I made every exertion in my power, and my quartermasters 
did the same, to have these supplies hurried forward rapidly ; 
and I was repeatedly told that they had filled the requisitions at 
Washington, and that the supplies had been forwarded. But 
they did not come to us, and of course were inaccessible to the 
army. I did not fail to make frequent representation of this 
condition of things to the general-in chief, and it appears that he 
referred the matter to the quartermaster-general, who constantly 
replied that the supplies had been promptly ordered. Notwith- 
standing this, they did not reach our depots. 

The following extracts are from telegrams upon this sub- 
ject : 



630 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

To Gen. Halleck, Oct. n. We have been making every 
effort to get supplies of clothing for this army, and Col. Ingalls 
has received advices that it has been forwarded by railroad ; 
but', owing to bad management on the roads, or from some other 
cause, it comes in very slowly, and it will take a much longer 
time than was anticipated to get articles that are absolutely indis- 
pensable to the army, unless the railroad managers forward sup- 
plies more rapidly. 

To Gen. Halleck, Oct. n. I am compelled again to call your 
attention to the great deficiency of shoes, and other indispens- 
able articles of clothing, that still exists in some of the corps in 
this army. Upon the assurances of the chief-quartermaster, who 
based his calculation upon information received from Washing- 
ton that clothing would be forwarded at certain times, corps 
commanders sent their wagons to Hagerstown and Harper's 
Ferry for it. It did not arrive as promised, and has not yet 
arrived. Unless some measures are taken to insure the prompt 
forwarding of these supplies, there will necessarily be a cor- 
responding delay in getting the army ready to move, as the men 
cannot march without shoes. Everything has been done that 
can be done at these headquarters to accomplish the desired 
result. 

To Gen. Halleck, Oct. 15. I am using every possible exer- 
tion to get this army ready to move. It was only yesterday that 
a part of our shoes and clothing arrived at Hagerstown. It is 
being issued to the troops as rapidly as possible. 

To Col. Ingalls, Oct. 15. Gen. Franklin reports that there 
is by no means as much clothing as was called for at Hagers- 
town. I think, therefore, you had better have additional sup- 
plies, especially of shoes, forwarded to Harper's Ferry as soon as 
possible. 

To Col. Ingalls, Oct. 16. Gen. J. F. Reynolds just tele- 
graphs as follows : " My quartermaster reports that there are no 
shoes, tents, blankets, or knapsacks at Hagerstown. He was able 
to procure only a complete supply of overcoats and pants, with 
a few socks, drawers, and coats. This leaves many of the men 
yet without a shoe. My requisitions call for 5,255 pairs of 
shoes." 

Please push the shoes and stockings up to Harper's Ferry as 
fast as possible. 

From Gen. Sumner, Oct. 7. "I h^ve given orders upon 



SUPPLIES LA CKING. 63 I 

orders about the clothing, but my officers can get nothing from 
Washington, and some staff officers there had the impudence to 
say that I had no right to sign requisitions." 



From CoL Ingalls, Oct. 9. " You did right in sending cloth- 
ing to Harper's Ferry. You will not be able to send too much 
or too quickly. We want blankets, shoes, canteens, etc., very 
much." 



from CoL Ingalls to Quartermaster in Philadelphia, Oct. 10. 
" Shipments to Hagerstown must be made direct through, to 
avoid the contemptible delays at Harrisburg. If Col. Crosman 
was ordered to send clothing, I hope he has sent it, for the suf- 
fering and impatience are excessive." 

From Col. Ingalls, Oct. 13. "Has the clothing arrived yet? 
If not, do you know where it is ? What clothing was taken by 
the rebels at Chambersburg ? Did they capture any property 
that was en route to you ? Have we not got clothing at Harris- 
burg? Send an agent over the road to obtain information and 
hurry up the supplies. Reply at once/' 



From Gen. Halleck, Oct. 13. " Your telegram in regard to 
supplies has been referred to the quartermaster-general, and he 
replies that everything asked for had been sent or ordered. The 
movement of your reinforcements by railroads has probably de- 
layed the transportation of some portion of them. It is difficult 
to supply the waste of horses." 

From F. Lowry, Capt. and Quartermaster, Oct. 15. " I have 
just returned from Hagerstown, where I have been for the cloth- 
ing for the corps. There was nothing there but overcoats, trou- 
sers, and a few uniform coats and socks. There were not any 
shoes, blankets, shirts, or shelter-tents. Will you please tell me 
where and when the balance can be had? Shall I send to Har- 
per's Ferry for them to-morrow ? The corps surgeon has just 
made a requisition for forty-five hospital-tents. There are none 
at Hagerstown. Will you please to inform me if I can get them 
at Harper's Ferry ?" 



From Assist.-Quartermaster G. W. Weeks, Oct. \$ " I want 
at least ten thousand (10,000) suits of clothing in addition to 
what I have received. It should be here now." 



632 



McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 



From A. Bliss, Capt. and Assist. -Quartermaster, Oct. 22. "We 
have bootees, 12,000 ; greatcoats, 4,000 ; drawers and shirts are 
gone ; blankets and stockings nearly so ; 15,000 each of these 
four articles are wanted." 



From Col. Ingalls, Oct. 24. " Please send to Capt. Bliss, at 
Harper's Ferry, 10,000 blankets, 12,000 caps, 5,000 overcoats, 
10,000 pairs bootees, 2,000 pairs artillery and cavalry boots, 
15,000 pairs stockings, 15,000 drawers, and 15,000 pants. The 
clothing arrives slowly. Can it not be hurried along faster ? 
May I ask you to obtain authority for this shipment ? " 



From Capt. Weeks, Oct. 30. " Clothing has arrived this morn- 
ing. None taken by rebels. Shall I supply Franklin, and retain 
portions for Porter and Reynolds until called for ? " 



The following statement, taken from a report of the chief- 
quartermaster with the army, will show what progress was made 
in supplying the army with clothing from the ist of Sept. to the 
date of crossing the Potomac on the 3ist of Oct., and that a 
greater part of the clothing did not reach our depots until after 
the 1 4th of Oct. :

Col. Ingalls, chief-quartermaster, in his report upon this sub- 
ject says : 

"There was great delay in receiving our clothing. The 
orders were promptly given by me and approved by Gen. Meigs, 
but the roads were slow to transport, particularly the Cumber- 
land Valley Road. 

"For instance, clothing ordered to Hagerstown on the yth 
Oct. for the corps of Franklin, Porter, and Reynolds did not 
arrive there until about the i8th, and by that time, of course, 
there were increased wants and changes in position of troops. 
The clothing of Sumner arrived in great quantities near the last 
of Oct., almost too late for issue, as the army was crossing into 
Virginia. We finally left 50,000 suits at Harper's Ferry, partly 
on the cars just arrived, and partly in store." 

The causes of the reduction of our cavalry force have already 
been recited. The difficulty in getting new supplies from the 
usual sources led me to apply for and obtain authority for the 
cavalry and artillery officers to purchase their own horses. The 
following are the telegrams and letters on this subject : 

To Gen. Halleck, Oct. 12. "It is absolutely necessary that 
some energetic means be taken to supply the cavalry of this army 
with remount horses. The present rate of supply is (1,050) ten 
hundred and fifty per week for the entire army here and in front 
of Washington. From this number the artillery draw for their 
batteries." 



634 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

To Gen. Halleck, Oct. 14. "With my small cavalry force it is 
impossible for me to watch the line of the Potomac properly, or 
even make the reconnoissances that are necessary for our move- 
ments. This makes it necessary for me to weaken my line very 
much by extending the infantry to guard the innumerable fords. 
This will continue until the river rises, and it will be next to 
impossible to prevent the rebel cavalry raids. My cavalry force, 
as I urged this morning, should be largely and immediately 
increased, under any hypothesis, whether to guard the river or 
advance on the enemy, or both." 

The following was received Oct. 25, 1862, from Washington, 
4.50 P.M.: 

" To Maj.-Gen. McClellan : 

" I have just received your despatch about sore-tongued and 
fatigued horses. Will you pardon me for asking what the horses 
of your army have done since the battle of Antietam that fatigues 
anything ? 

"A. LINCOLN." 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

Oct. 25, 6 P.M., 1862. 
His Excellency the President : 

In reply to your telegram of this date I have the honor to 
state that from the time this army left Washington on the yth 
of Sept. my cavalry has been constantly employed in making 
reconnoissances, scouting, and picketing. Since the battle of 
Antietam six regiments have made one trip of two hundred 
miles, marching fifty-five miles in one day while endeavoring to 
reach Stuart's cavalry. Gen. Pleasonton in his official report states 
that he, with the remainder of our available cavalry, while on 
Stuart's track marched seventy-eight miles in twenty-four hours. 
Besides these two remarkable expeditions, our cavalry has been 
engaged in picketing and scouting one hundred and fifty miles 
of river-front ever since the battle of Antietam, and has made 
repeated reconnoissances since that time, engaging the enemy on 
every occasion. Indeed, it has performed harder service since 
the battle than before. I beg you will also consider that this 
same cavalry was brought from the Peninsula, where it encoun- 
tered most laborious service, and was at the commencement of 
this campaign in low condition, and from that time to the present 
it has had no time to recruit. 

If any instance can be found where overworked cavalry has 
performed more labor than mine since the battle of Antietam, I 
am not conscious of it. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. 



HORSES NEEDED. 635 

The following was received Oct. 24 from Cherry Run, 12 M.: 

" To Col. A. V. Colburn : 

"I have great difficulty in obtaining spies and guides without 
payment. Would it not be well to have sent to my acting divi- 
sion quartermaster, First Lieut. John S. Schutz, five hundred 
dollars for that purpose? Col. Williams reports, eleven (n) A.M. 
to-day : 

" * I have in camp 267 horses belonging to officers and men. 
Of these 128 are positively and absolutely unable to leave the 
camp from the following causes viz., sore tongue, grease and 
consequent lameness, and sore backs. For example, the 5th 
U. S. Cavalry has now in camp 70 horses. Of these 53 are worth- 
less from the above causes. Out of 139 horses, the remainder, I 
do not believe 50 can trot eight miles. The other portion of my 
command, now absent on picket duty, has horses which are about 
in the same condition, as no selection, unless absolutely neces- 
sary, has been made. The number of sore back horses exceed- 
ingly small ; the diseases are principally grease, sore tongue. 
The horses which are still sound are absolutely broken down 
from fatigue and want of flesh. I will also remark that the men 
of my command are much in want of clothing. 

"'Col. WILLIAMS.' 

" The cavalry should therefore be changed, I think, and their 
number increased to 1,000, with one battery of horse-artillery. I 
would respectfully desire to have Col. Williams in command. 

'* JOHN NEWTON, 

" Brig. -Gen, Commanding." 

Col. Colburn telegraphed from Washington, Oct. 25 : 

" To GEN. MCCLELLAN : I went this morning to see Gen. 
Halleck, and spoke to him about the bridges, etc., and also about 
rebuilding the road to Winchester and prolonging it to Stras- 
burg ; also about the forces to be left at Harper's Ferry, and 
what was to be done in the Shenandoah provided the enemy fell 
back. The only answer I could get was that they had nothing 
to do with the present campaign, and that you ought to be able 
to decide in the premises. There was no use of trying to ex- 
plain matters to him, because he would not listen to anything. 
When I spoke to him about the cavalry horses he said that that 
was the quartermaster's business and he had nothing to do with 
it. I will try again, but think it no use." 

The following is an extract from the official report of Col. 
Ingalls : 



636 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

" Immediately after the battle of Antietam efforts were made 
to supply deficiencies in clothing and horses. Large requisitions 
were prepared and sent in. The artillery and cavalry required 
large numbers to cover losses sustained in battle, on the march, 
and by diseases. Both of these arms were deficient when they 
left Washington. A most violent and destructive disease made 
its appearance at this time, which put nearly 4,000 animals out 
of service. Horses reported perfectly well one day would be 
dead-lame the next, and it was difficult to foresee where it would 
end or what number would cover the loss. They were attacked 
in the- hoof and tongue. No one seemed able to account for the 
appearance of this disease. Animals kept at rest would recover 
in time, but could not be worked. I made application to send 
West and purchase horses at once, but it was refused, on the 
ground that the outstanding contracts provided for enough ; but 
they were not delivered sufficiently fast, nor in sufficient numbers, 
until late in October and early in November. I was authorized 
to buy 2,500 late in October, but the delivery was not completed 
until in November, after we had reached Warrenton." 



In a letter from Gen. Meigs, written on the i4th of Oct. and 
addressed to the general-in-chief, it is stated : " There have been 
issued, therefore, to the Army of the Potomac, since the battles 
in front of Washington, to replace losses, (9,254) nine thousand 
two hundred and fifty-four horses." 

What number of horses were sent to Gen. Pope before his 
return to Washington I have no means of determining ; but the 
following statement, made upon my order, by the chief-quarter- 
master with the army, and who had means for gaining accurate 
information, forces upon my mind the conclusion that the quar- 
termaster-general was in error : 



" HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 
"CHIEF-QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE, Oct. 31, 1862. 

" Horses purchased Sept. 6, 1862, by Col. Ingalls, chief- 
quartermaster, and issued to the forces under the

Clellan 1,200

" Issued to forces at and near Washington which have

HORSES NEEDED. 37 

over by Capt. Dana to the forces in this immediate 

command 3^8 1 3 

" Issued by Capt. J. J. Dana, assistant-quartermaster, to 

the forces in the vicinity of Washington 3^363 

" Grand total purchased by Col. R. Ingalls, chief-quar- 
termaster, and issued and turned over by Capt. J. J. 
Dana, assistant-quartermaster, to the entire Army of 
the Potomac and the forces around Washington... 7,176 
" About 3,000 horses have been turned over to the quarter- 
master's department by officers as unfit for service; nearly 1,500 
should now be turned over also, being worn out and diseased. 
" Respectfully submitted. 

" FRED. MYERS, 
" Lieut. -Col. and Quartermaster" 

This official statement, made up from the reports of the 
quartermasters who received and distributed the horses, exhib- 
its the true state of the case, and gives the total number of 
horses received by the Army of the Potomac and the troops 
around Washington, during a period of eight weeks, as (7,176) 
seven thousand one hundred and seventy-six, or (2,078) two 
thousand and seventy-eight less than the number stated by the 
quartermaster-general. 

Supposing that (1,500) fifteen hundred were issued to the 
army under Gen. Pope previous to its return to Washington, as 
Gen. Meigs states, there would still remain (578) five hundred 
and seventy-eight horses which he does not account for. 

The letter of the general-in-chief to the Secretary of War 
on the 28th of Oct., and the letter of Gen. Meigs to the gene- 
ral-in-chief on the 1 4th of Oct., convey the impression that, upon 
my repeated applications for cavalry and artillery horses for the 
Army of the Potomac, I had received a much greater number 
than was really the case. 

It will be seen from Col. Myers's report that of all the horses 
alluded to by Gen. Meigs, only (3,813) three thousand eight hun- 
dred and thirteen came to the army with which I was ordered 
to follow and attack the enemy. Of course the remainder did 
not in the slightest degree contribute to the efficiency of the 
cavalry or artillery of the army with which I was to cross the 
river. Neither did they in the least facilitate any preparations 
for carrying out the order to advance upon the enemy, as the 
general-in-chief's letter might seem to imply. 



638 MeCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

During the same period that we were receiving the horses 
alluded to about (3,000) three thousand of our old stock were 
turned into the quartermaster's department, and 1,500 more re- 
ported as in such condition that they ought to be turned in as 
unfit for service ; thus leaving the active army some 700 short 
of the number required to make good existing deficiencies, to 
say nothing of providing remounts for men whose horses had 
died or been killed during the campaign and those previously 
dismounted. Notwithstanding all the efforts made to obtain a 
remount, there were, after deducting the force engaged in pick- 
eting the river, but about a thousand serviceable cavalry horses 
on the 2ist day of Oct. 

In a letter dated Oct. 14, 1862, the general-in-chief says: 
" It is also reported to me that the number of animals with 
your army in the field is about 31,000. It is believed that your 
present proportion of cavalry and of animals is much larger 
than that of any other of our armies." 

What number of animals our other armies had I am not pre- 
pared to say, but military men in European armies have been 
of the opinion that an army to be efficient, while carrying on 
active operations in the field, should have a cavalry force equal 
in numbers to from one-sixth to one-fourth of the infantry force. 
My cavalry did not amount to one-twentieth part of the army, 
and hence the necessity of giving every one of my cavalry sol- 
diers a serviceable horse. 

Cavalry may be said to constitute the antenna of an army. 
It scouts all the roads in front, on the flanks, and in the rear 
of the advancing columns, and constantly feels the enemy. The 
amount of labor falling on this arm during the Maryland cam- 
paign was excessive. 

To persons not familiar with the movements of troops, and 
the amount of transportation required for a large army march- 
ing away from water or railroad communications, the number 
of animals mentioned by the general-in-chief may have appeared 
unnecessarily large ; but to a military man who takes the trouble 
to enter into an accurate and detailed computation of the num- 
ber of pounds of subsistence and forage required for such an 
army as that of the Potomac, it will be seen that the 31,000 
animals were considerably less than was absolutely necessary 
to an advance. 



THE ARMY'S NECESSITIES. 639 

As we were required to move through a country which could 
not be depended upon for any of our supplies, it became neces- 
sary to transport everything in wagons and to be prepared for 
all emergencies. I did not consider it safe to leave the river 
without subsistence and forage for ten days. 

The official returns of that date show the aggregate strength 
of the army for duty to have been about 1 10,000 men of all 
arms. This did not include teamsters, citizen employees, officers' 
servants, etc., amounting to some 12,000, which gave a total of 
122,000 men. 

I he subsistence alone of this army for ten days required for 
its transportation 1,830 wagons at 2,000 pounds to the wagon, 
and 10,980 animals. 

Our cavalry horses at that time amounted to 5,046, and our 
artillery horses to 6,836. 

To transport full forage for these 22,862 animals for ten days 
required 17,832 additional animals ; and this forage would only 
supply the entire number (40,694) of animals with a small frac- 
tion over half-allowance for the time specified. 

It will be observed that this estimate does not embrace the 
animals necessary to transport quartermasters' supplies, baggage, 
camp equipage, ambulances, reserve ammunition, forage for 
officers' horses, etc., which would greatly augment the necessary 
transportation. 

It may very truly be said that we did make the inarch with 
the means at our disposal ; but it will be remembered that we 
met with no serious opposition from the enemy, neither did we 
encounter delays from any other cause. The roads were in 
excellent condition, and the troops marched with the most com- 
mendable order and celerity. 

If we had met with a determined resistance from the enemy, 
and our progress had been very much retarded thereby, we would 
have consumed our supplies before they could have been re- 
newed. A proper estimate of my responsibilities as the com- 
mander of that army did not justify me in basing my preparations 
for the expedition upon the supposition that I was to have an 
uninterrupted march. On the contrary, it was my duty to be 
prepared for all emergencies ; and not the least important of my 
responsibilities was the duty of making ample provision for sup- 
plying my men and animals with rations and forage. 



640 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Knowing the solicitude of the President for an early move- 
ment, and sharing with him fully his anxiety for prompt action, 
on the 2ist of October I telegraphed to the general-in-chief as 
follows : 

Oct. 21. Since the receipt of the President's order to move 
on the enemy I have been making every exertion to get this army 
supplied with clothing absolutely necessary for marching. 

This, I am happy to say, is now nearly accomplished. I have 
also, during the same time', repeatedly urged upon you the impor- 
tance of supplying cavalry and artillery horses to replace those 
broken down by hard service, and steps have been taken to 
insure a prompt delivery. 

Our cavalry, even when well supplied with horses, is much 
inferior in number to that of the enemy, but in efficiency has 
proved itself superior. So forcibly has this been impressed 
upon our old regiments by repeated successes that the men are 
fully persuaded that they are equal to twice their number of 
rebel cavalry. 

Exclusive of the cavalry force now engaged in picketing the 
river, I have not at present over about one thousand (1,000) 
horses for service. Officers have been sent in various direc- 
tions to purchase horses, and I expect them soon. Without 
more cavalry horses our communications, from the moment we 
march, would be at the mercy of the large cavalry force of the 
enemy, and it would not be possible for us to cover our flanks 
properly, or to obtain the necessary information of the position 
and movements of the enemy in such a way as to insure success. 
My experience has shown the necessity of a large and efficient 
cavalry force. 

Under the foregoing circumstances I beg leave to ask 
whether the President desires me to march on the enemy at 
once or to await the reception of the new horses, every pos- 
sible step having been taken to insure their prompt arrival. 

On the same day Gen. Halleck replied as follows : 

"Oct. 21. Your telegram of twelve M. has been submitted 
to the President. He directs me to say that he has no change 
to make in his order of the 6th instant. 

" If you have not been, and are not now, in condition to 
obey it, you will be able to show such want of ability. The 
President does not expect impossibilities, but he is very anx- 
ious that all this good weather should not be wasted in inac- 
tivity. Telegraph when you will move and on what lines you 
propose to march." 



HALLECICS OPINION. 64! 

From the tenor of this despatch I conceived that it was left 
for my judgment to decide whether or not it was possible to 
move with safety to the army at that time ; and this respon- 
sibility I exercised with the more confidence in view of the 
strong assurances of his trust in me, as commander of that 
army, with which the President had seen fit to honor me during 
his last visit. 

The cavalry requirements, without which an advance would 
have been in the highest degree injudicious and unsafe, were still 
wanting. 

The country before us was an enemy's country, where the 
inhabitants furnished to the enemy every possible assistance ; 
providing food for men and forage for animals, giving all infor- 
mation concerning our movements, and rendering every aid in 
their power to the enemy's cause. 

It was manifest that we should find it, as we subsequently 
did, a hostile district, where we could derive no aid from the 
inhabitants that would justify dispensing with the active co-op- 
eration of. an efficient cavalry force. Accordingly I fixed upon 
the ist of November as the earliest date at which the forward 
movement could well be commenced. 

The general-in-chief, in a letter to the Secretary of War on 
the 28th of Oct., says : " In my opinion there has been no such 
want of supplies in the army under Gen. McClellan as to prevent 
his compliance with the orders to advance against the enemy." 

Notwithstanding this opinion, expressed by such high autho- 
rity, I am compelled to say again that the delay in the reception 
of necessary supplies up to that date had left the army in a 
condition totally unfit to advance against the enemy ; that an 
advance under the existing circumstances would, in my judg- 
ment, have been attended with the highest degree of peril, with 
great suffering and sickness among the men, and with imminent 
danger of being cut off from our supplies by the superior cavalry 
force of the enemy, and with no reasonable prospect of gaining 
any advantage over him. 

I dismiss this subject with the remark that I have found it 
impossible to resist the force of my own convictions that the 
commander of an army who, from the time of its organization, 
has for eighteen months been in constant communication with its 
officers and men, the greater part of the time engaged in active 



642 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

service in the field, and who has exercised this command in 
many battles, must certainly be considered competent to deter- 
mine whether his army is in proper condition to advance on the 
enemy or not ; and he must necessarily possess greater facilities 
for forming a correct judgment in regard to the wants of his 
men and the condition of his supplies than the general-in-chief 
in his office at Washington City. 

The movement from Washington into Maryland, which cul- 
minated in the battles of South Mountain and Antietam, was not 
a part of an offensive campaign, with the object of the invasion 
of the enemy's territory and an attack upon his capital, but was 
defensive in its purposes, although offensive in its character, and 
would be technically called a "defensive-offensive campaign." 
It was undertaken at a time when our army had experienced 
severe defeats, and its object was to preserve the national capital 
and Baltimore, to protect Pennsylvania from invasion, and to 
drive the enemy out of Maryland. These purposes were fully 
and finally accomplished by the battle of Antietam, which 
brought the Army of the Potomac into what might be termed 
an accidental position on the upper Potomac. 

Having gained the immediate object of the campaign, the 
first thing to be done was to insure Maryland from a return of 
the enemy ; the second, to prepare our own army exhausted by 
a series of severe battles, destitute to a great extent of supplies, 
and very deficient in artillery and cavalry horses for a definite 
offensive movement, and to determine upon the line of opera- 
tions for a further advance. At the time of the battle of Antie- 
tam the Potomac was very low, and presented a comparatively 
weak line of defence unless watched by large masses of troops. 
The reoccupation of Harper's Ferry and the disposition of troops 
above that point rendered the line of the Potomac secure against 
everything except cavalry raids. No time was lost in placing the 
army in proper condition for an advance, and the circumstances 
which caused the delay after the battle of Antietam have been 
fully enumerated. 

I never regarded Harper's Ferry or its vicinity as a proper 
base of operations for a movement upon Richmond. I still con- 
sidered the line of the Peninsula as the true approach, but for 
obvious reasons did not make any proposal to return to it. 

On the 6th of Oct., as stated above, I was ordered by the 



THE LINE OF ADVANCE. 643 

President, through his general-in-chief, to cross the Potomac and 
:give battle to the enemy or drive him south. Two lines were 
presented for my choice : 

i st. Up the Valley of the Shenandoah, in which case I was to 
have 12,000 to 15,000 additional troops. 

2d. To cross between the enemy and Washington that is, 
east of the Blue Ridge in which event I was to be reinforced 
with 30,000 men. 

At first I determined to adopt the line of the Shenandoah, 
for these reasons : The Harper's Ferry and Winchester Railroad, 
and the various turnpikes converging upon Winchester, afforded 
superior facilities for supplies. Our cavalry being weak, this line 
of communication could be more easily protected There was 
no advantage in interposing at that time the Blue Ridge and the 
Shenandoah between the enemy and myself. 

At the period in question the Potomac was still very low, 
and I apprehended that if I crossed the river below Harper's 
Ferry the enemy would promptly check the movement by re- 
crossing into Maryland, at the same time covering his rear by 
occupying in strong force the passes leading through the Blue 
Ridge from the southeast into the Shenandoah Valley. 

I anticipated, as the result of the first course, that Lee would 
fight me near Winchester, if he could do so under favorable cir- 
cumstances ; or else that he would abandon the lower Shenan- 
doah, and leave the Army of the Potomac free to act upon some 
other line of operations. 

If he abandoned the Shenandoah he would naturally fall back 
upon his railway communications. I have since been confirmed 
in the belief that if I had crossed the Potomac below Harper's 
Ferry in the early part of October, Gen. Lee would have re- 
crossed into Maryland. 

As above explained, the army was not in condition to move 
until late in October and in the meantime circumstances had 
changed. 

The period had arrived when a sudden and great rise of the 
Potomac might be looked for at any moment ; the season of bad 
roads and difficult movements was approaching, which would 
naturally deter the enemy from exposing himself very far from 
his base, and his movements all appeared to indicate a falling 
back from the river towards his supplies. Under these circum- 



644 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

stances I felt at liberty to disregard the possibility of the enemy's 
recrossing the Potomac, and determined to select the line east of 
the Blue Ridge, feeling convinced that it would secure me the 
largest accession of force and the most cordial support of the 
President, whose views from the beginning were in favor of that 
line. 

The subject of the defence of the line of the upper Potomac 
after the advance of the main army had long occupied my atten- 
tion. I desired to place Harper's Ferry and its dependencies in 
a strong state of defence, and frequently addressed the general- 
in-chief upon the subject of the erection of field-works and per- 
manent bridges there, asking for the funds necessary to accom- 
plish the purpose. Although I did my best to explain, as clearly 
as I was able, that I did not wish to erect permanent works of 
masonry, and that neither the works nor the permanent bridges 
had any reference to the advance of the army, but solely to the 
permanent occupation of Harper's Ferry, I could never make the 
general-in-chief understand my wishes, but was refused the funds 
necessary to erect the field-works, on the ground that there was 
no appropriation for the erection of permanent fortifications ; and 
was not allowed to build the permanent bridge, on the ground 
that the main army could not be delayed in its movements until 
its completion. 

Of course I never thought of delaying the advance of the 
army for that purpose, and so stated repeatedly. 



CHAPTER XXXIX. 

Crossing the Potomac The march of a great army Overtaking the 
enemy Another battle imminent Removed from the command 
Burnside brings the order Farewells to the army. 

ON the 25th of Oct. the pontoon-bridge at Berlin was con- 
structed, there being already one across the Potomac and an- 
other across the Shenandoah at Harper's Ferry. 

On the 26th two divisions of the pth corps and Pleasonton's 
brigade of cavalry crossed at Berlin and occupied Lovettsville. 

The ist, 6th, and Qth corps, the cavalry, and reserve artillery 
crossed at Berlin between the 26th of Oct. and the 2d of 
Nov. 

The 2d and 5th corps crossed at Harper's Ferry between the 
29th of Oct. and ist of Nov. 

Heavy rains delayed the movement considerably in the begin- 
ning, and the ist, 5th, and 6th corps were obliged to halt at 
least one day at the crossings to complete, as far as possible, 
the necessary supplies that could not be procured at an earlier 
period. 

The plan of campaign I adopted during the advance was to 
move the army well in hand parallel to the Blue Ridge, taking 
Warrenton as the point of direction for the main army ; seizing 
each pass on the Blue Ridge by detachments as we approached 
it, and guarding them, after we had passed, a-s long as they 
would enable the enemy to trouble our communications with 
the Potomac. It was expected that we would unite with the 
nth corps and Sickles's division near Thoroughfare Gap. We 
depended upon Harper's Ferry and Berlin for supplies until the 
Manassas Gap Railway was reached ; when that occurred the 
passes in our rear were to be abandoned and the army massed 
ready for action or movement in any direction. 

It was my intention, if, upon reaching Ashby's or any other 
pass, I found that the enemy were in force between it and the 

645 



646 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Potomac, in the Valley of the Shenandoah, to move into the 
valley and endeavor to gain their rear. 

I hardly hoped to accomplish this, but did expect that by 
striking in between Culpeper Court-House and Little Washing- 
ton I could either separate their army and beat them in detail, 
or else force them to concentrate as far back as Gordonsville, 
and thus place the Army of the Potomac in position either to 
adopt the Fredericksburg line of advance upon Richmond or 
to be removed to the Peninsula if, as I apprehended, it were 
found impossible to supply it by the Orange and Alexandria 
Railroad beyond Culpeper. 

On the 2yth of Oct. the remaining divisions of the pth corps 
crossed at Berlin, and Pleasonton's cavalry advanced to Purcell- 
ville. The concentration of the 6th corps, delayed somewhat 
by intelligence as to the movements of the enemy near Hedges- 
ville, etc., was commenced on this day, and the ist corps was 
already in motion for Berlin. 

On the 28th the ist corps and the general headquarters 
reached Berlin. 

On the 29th the reserve artillery crossed and encamped near 
Lovettsville. Stoneman's division, temporarily attached to the 
9th corps, occupied Leesburg ; Averill's cavalry brigade moved 
towards Berlin from Hagerstown ; two divisions of the 9th 
corps moved to Wheatland, and one to Waterford. The 2d 
corps commenced the passage of the Shenandoah at Harper's 
Ferry, and moved into the valley east of London Heights. 

On the 3oth the ist corps crossed at Berlin and encamped 
near Lovettsville, and the 2d corps completed the passage of 
the Shenandoah. The 5th corps commenced its march from 
Sharpsburg to Harper's Ferry. 

On the 3 ist the 2d corps moved to the vicinity of Hills- 
borough ; the 6th corps reached Boonsborough ; the 5th corps 
reached Harper's Ferry, one division crossing the Shenandoah. 

On the ist of Nov. the ist corps moved to Purcellville and 
Hamilton ; the 2d corps to Wood Grove ; the 5th corps to Hills- 
borough ; the 6th corps reached Berlin, one division crossing. 
Pleasonton's cavalry occupied Philomont, having a sharp skir- 
mish there and at Bloomfield. 

On Nov. 2 the 2d corps occupied Snicker's Gap ; the 5th 
corps, Snickersville ; the 6th corps crossed the Potomac and 



THE ADVANCE. 647 

encamped near Wheatland ; the gth corps advanced to Bloom- 
field, Union, and Philomont. Pleasonton drove the enemy out 
of Union. Averill was ordered to join Pleasonton. The enemy 
offered no serious resistance to the occupation of Snicker's Gap, 
but advanced to gain possession of it with a column of some 
5,000 to 6,000 infantry, who were driven back by a few rounds 
from our rifled guns. 

On the $d the ist corps moved to Philomont, Union, Bloom- 
field, etc.; the 2d corps to the vicinity of Upperville ; the 5th 
corps remained at Snicker's Gap ; the 6th corps moved to Pur- 
cellville ; the gih corps moved towards Upperville. Pleasonton 
drove the enemy out of Upperville after a severe fight. 

On the 4th the 2d corps took possession of Ashby's Gap ; the 
6th corps reached Union ; the pth corps, Upperville ; the cavalry 
occupied Piedmont. On the 5th the ist corps moved to Rec- 
tortown and White Plains ; one division of the 2d corps to the 
intersection of the Paris and Piedmont with the Upperville and 
Barber's road ; the 6th corps to the Aldie pike, east of Upper- 
ville ; the pth corps beyond the Manassas Railroad, between 
Piedmont and Salem, with a brigade at Manassas Gap. The 
cavalry under Averill had a skirmish at Manassas Gap, and the 
brigade of Pleasonton gained a handsome victory ovef superior 
numbers at Barber's cross-roads. Bayard's cavalry had some 
sharp skirmishing in front of Salem. 

On the 6th the ist corps advanced to Warrenton, the 2d corps 
to Rectortown ; the 5th corps commenced its movement from 
Snicker's Gap to White Plains ; the 9th corps to Waterloo and 
vicinity on the Rappahannock ; the nth corps was at New Bal- 
timore, Thoroughfare and Hopewell's Gaps ; Sickles's division 
guarding the Orange and Alexandria Railroad from Manassas 
Junction towards Warrenton Junction ; the cavalry near Flint 
Hill ; Bayard to cut off what there might be in Warrenton, and 
to proceed to the Rappahannock Station. 

Nov. 7, Gen. Pleasonton was ordered to move towards Lit- 
tle Washington and Sperryville, and thence towards Culpeper 
Court-House. 

Nov. 8, the 2d corps moved half-way to Warrenton ; the 
5th corps to New Baltimore. 

Nov. 9, the 2d and 5th corps reached Warrenton ; the Gth 
corps New Baltimore. 



648 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

Late on the night of the yth I received an order relieving me 
from the command of the Army of the Potomac, and directing 
me to turn it over to Gen. Burnside, which I at once did. 

I had already given the orders for the movements of the 
8th and pth ; these orders were carried into effect without 
change. 

The position in which I left the army, as the result of the 
orders I had given, was as follows : 

The ist, 2d, and 5th corps, reserve artillery, and general 
headquarters at Warrenton ; the gth corps on the line of the 
Rappahannock, in the vicinity of Waterloo ; the 6th corps at 
New Baltimore ; the nth corps at New Baltimore, Gainesville, 
and Thoroughfare Gap ; Sickles's division, of the 3d corps, on 
the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, from Manassas Junction to 
Warrenton Junction ; Pleasonton across the Rappahannock at 
Amissville, Jefferson, etc., with his pickets at Hazel river, facing 
Longstreet, six miles from Culpeper Court-House ; Bayard near 
Rappahannock Station. 

The army was thus massed near Warrenton, ready to act in 
any required direction, perfectly in hand, and in admirable con- 
dition and spirits. I doubt whether, during the whole period that 
I had the v honor to command the Army of the Potomac, it was in 
such excellent condition to fight a great battle. When I gave up 
the command to Gen. Burnside the best information in our pos- 
session indicated that Longstreet was immediately in our front 
near Culpeper ; Jackson, with one, perhaps both, of the Hills, 
near Chester and Thornton's Gaps, with the mass of their force 
west of the Blue Ridge. 

The reports from Gen. Pleasonton on the advance indicated 
the possibility of separating the two wings of the enemy's forces, 
and either beating Longstreet separately or forcing him to fall 
back at least upon Gordonsville to effect his junction with the 
rest of the army. 

The following is from the report of Gen. Pleasonton : 

" At this time, and from the yth instant, my advance pickets 
were at Hazel river, within six miles of Culpeper, besides having 
my flank pickets towards Chester and Thornton's Gaps extended 
to Gaines's cross-roads and Newby's cross-roads, with nume- 
rous patrols in the direction of Woodville, Little Washington, 
and Sperryville. 




640 



650 McCLELLAN* S OWN STORY. 

"The information gained from these parties, and also from 
deserters, prisoners, contrabands, as well as citizens, estab- 
lished the fact of Longstreet, with his command, being at 
Culpeper, while Jackson, with D. H. Hill, with their respec- 
tive commands, were in the Shenandoah Valley, on the western 
side of the Blue Ridge, covering Chester and Thornton's Gaps, 
and expecting us to attempt to pass through and attack them. 
As late as the iyth of November a contraband just from Stras- 
burg came into my camp and reported that D. H. Hill's corps 
was two miles beyond that place, on the railroad to Mount Jack- 
son. Hill was tearing up the road and destroying the bridges 
under the impression that we intended to follow into that valley, 
and was en route for Staunton. Jackson's corps was between 
Strasburg and Winchester. Ewell and A. P. Hill were with 
Jackson. Provisions were scarce, and the rebels were obliged to 
keep moving to obtain them." 



On the zoth of Nov. General Pleasonton was attacked by 
Longstreet, with one division of infantry and Stuart's cavalry, 
but repulsed the attack. 

This indicates the relative position of our army and that of 
the enemy at the time I was relieved from the command. 

Had I remained in command I should have made the at- 
tempt to divide the enemy, as before suggested ; and could he 
have been brought to a battle within reach of my supplies, I 
cannot doubt that the result would have been a brilliant vic- 
tory for our army. 

[The following discretionary authority to Gen. Halleck, in the 
handwriting of Mr. Lincoln, was found among the papers of Gen. 
Halleck after his death, and transmitted by his widow to the 
War Department. It is not probable that Gen. McClellan ever 
heard of it :] 



"EXECUTIVE MANSION, .WASHINGTON, 186 . 

" ' By direction of the President, it is ordered that Maj.-Gen. 
McClellan be relieved from the command of the Army of the 
Potomac, and that Maj.-Gen. Burnside take the command of 
that army. Also, that Maj.-Gen. Hunter take command of 
the corps in said army which is now commanded by Gen. 
Burnside. 

" ' That Maj.-Gen. Fitz-John Porter be relieved from the 
command of the corps he now commands in said army, and 
that Maj.-Gen. Hooker take command of said corps.' 



REMOVED FROM COMMAND. 651 

" The general-in-chief is authorized, in discretion, to issue an 
order substantially as the above, forthwith or so soon as he may 
deem proper. 

"A. LINCOLN. 

"Nov. 5, 1862." 



When we broke up the camps on the upper Potomac and 
moved in advance, the army was in fine order for another bat- 
tle ; the troops in the best of spirits, full of confidence in me, 
and I was then, I believe, capable of handling an army in the 
field as I had never been before. I felt that I could fight a 
great battle. The march was admirably conducted, and is wor- 
thy of study. In the course of the yth of Nov. I heard inci- 
dentally that a special train had brought out from Washing- 
ton Gen. Buckingham, who had left the railway very near our 
camp, and, without coming to see me, had proceeded through 
a driving snow-storm several miles to Burnside's camp. I at 
once suspected that he brought the order relieving me from 
command, but kept my own counsel. Late at night I was sit- 
ting alone in my tent, writing to my wife. All the staff were 
asleep. Suddenly some one knocked upon the tent-pole, and, 
upon my invitation to enter, there appeared Burnside and 
Buckingham, both looking very solemn. I received them kind- 
ly and commenced conversation upon general subjects in the 
most unconcerned manner possible. After a few moments 
Buckingham said to Burnside : " Well, general, I think we 
had better tell Gen. McClellan the object of our visit." I 
very pleasantly said that I should be glad to learn it. Where- 
upon Buckingham handed me the two orders of which he was 
the bearer : 

" HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, 
"WASHINGTON, Nov. 5, 1862. 

" Maj.-Gen. McClellan, Commanding, etc. : 

" GENERAL : On receipt of the order of the President, sent 
herewith, you will immediately turn over your command to 
Maj.-Gen. Burnside, and repair to Trenton, N. J., reporting on 
your arrival at that place, by telegraph, for further orders. 
" Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 

" H. W. HALLECK, 

" Gen.-in-Chiefr 



652 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

General Orders, No. 182. 

" WAR DEPARTMENT, 
" ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, 

"WASHINGTON, Nov. 5, 1862. 

" By direction of the President of the United States, it is 
ordered that Maj.-Gen. McClellan be relieved from the command 
of the Army of the Potomac, and that Maj.-Gen. Burnside take 
the command of that army. 

"By order of the Secretary of War. 

" E. D. TOWNSEND, 

"Assist. Adj.-Gen" 

I saw that both especially Buckingham were watching me 
most intently while I opened and read the orders. I read the 
papers with a smile, immediately turned to Burnside, and said : 
"Well, Burnside, I turn the command over to you." 

They soon retired, Burnside having begged me to remain 
for a few days with the army, and I having consented to do so, 
though I wished to leave the next morning. 

Before we broke up from the Maryland side of the Potomac I 
had said to Burnside that, as he was second in rank in the army, 
I wished him to be as near me as possible on the march, and that 
he must keep himself informed of the condition of affairs. I took 
especial pains during the march to have him constantly informed 
of what I was doing, the positions of the various corps, etc., and 
he ought to have been able to take the reins in his hands without 
a day's delay. 

The order depriving me of the command created an immense 
deal of deep feeling in the army so much so that many were in 
favor of my refusing to obey the order, and of marching upon 
Washington to take possession of the government. My chief 
purpose in remaining with the army as long as I did after being 
relieved was to calm this feeling, in which I succeeded. 

I will not attempt to describe my own feelings nor the scenes 
attending my farewell to the army. They are beyond my powers 
of description. What words, in truth, could convey to the mind 
such a scene thousands of brave men, who under my very eye 
had changed from raw recruits to veterans of many fields, shed- 
ding tears like children in their ranks, as they bade good-by to 
the general who had just led them to victory after the defeats 
they had seen under another leader ? Could they have foreseen 
the future their feelings would not have been less intense ! 



McCLELLAN'S FARE WELL. 653 

[The following was McClellan's farewell to the army :] 

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, 

CAMP NEAR RECTORTOWN, VA., Nov. 7, 1862. 
Officers and Soldiers of the Army of the Potomac : 

An order of the President devolves upon Maj.-Gen. Burnside 
the command of this army. 

In parting from you I cannot express the love and gratitude 
I bear to you. As an army you have grown up under my care. 
In you I have never found doubt or coldness. The battles you 
have fought under my command will proudly live in our nation's 
history. The glory you have achieved, our mutual perils and 
fatigues, the graves of our comrades fallen in battle and by 
disease, the broken forms of those whom wounds and sickness 
have disabled the strongest associations which can exist among 
men unite us still by an indissoluble tie. We shall ever be com- 
rades in supporting the Constitution of our country and the 
nationality of its people. 

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN, 

Maj.-Gen. U. S. Army. 



CHAPTER XL. 

PRIVATE LETTERS. 
[Oct. i to Nov. 10, 1862.] 

Oct. i, Sharpsburg, 7.30 P.M. . . . Received this morning a 
mysterious despatch from which I inferred that the President 
was on his way hither. Went to Harper's Ferry and found him 
with half a dozen Western officers. He remains at Harper's 
Ferry to-night. . . . 

Oct. 2, A.M. ... I found the President at Gen. Sumner's 
headquarters at Harper's Ferry ; none of the cabinet were with 
him, merely some Western officers, such as McClernand and 
others. His ostensible purpose is to see the troops and the bat- 
tle-field ; I incline to think that the real purpose of his visit is to 
push me into a premature advance into Virginia. I may be mis- 
taken, but think not. The real truth is that my army is not fit 
to advance. The old regiments are reduced to mere skeletons, 
and are completely tired out. They need rest and filling up. 
The new regiments are not fit for the field. The remains of 
Pope's army are pretty well broken up and ought not to be made 
to fight for some little time yet. Cavalry and artillery horses 
are broken down. So it goes. These people don't know what 
an army requires, and therefore act stupidly. ... 

Oct. 3. ... I was riding with the President all yesterday 
afternoon, and expect to do the same to-day. He seems in quite 
a good-humor ; is accompanied only by Western people. 

Oct. 4. . . . The President is still here and goes to Frede- 
rick this morning. I will probably accompany him as far as the 
battle-field of South Mountain, so that my day will be pretty well 
used up. 

654 



PRIVA TE LE TTERS. 655 

Oct. 5. . . .The President left us about eleven yestenl:;y 
morning. I went with him as far as over the battle-field of South 
Mountain, and on my way thither was quite surprised to meet 
Mr. Aspinwall en route to my cam}). . . . The President was very 
kind personally ; told me he was convinced I was the best gene- 
ral in the country, etc., etc. He was very affable, and I really 
think he does feel very kindly towards me personally. I showed 
him the battle-fields, and am sure he departed with a more vivid 
idea of the great difficulty of the task we had accomplished. 
Mr. Aspinwall is decidedly of the opinion that it is my duty 
to submit to the President's proclamation and quietly continue 
doing my duty as a soldier. I presume he is right, and am at 
least sure that he is honest in his opinion. I shall surely give 
his views full consideration. He is of the opinion that the 
nation cannot stand the burdens of the war much longer, and 
that a speedy solution is necessary. In this he is no doubt cor- 
rect, and I hope sincerely that another successful battle may 
conclude my part of the work. 

Oct. , 1862, Pleasant Valley. I received to-day a very 
handsome series of resolutions from the councils of Philadel- 
phia, thanking me for the last campaign. The councils pitch 
into the government for not thanking me, most beautifully. The 
phrase about my having " organized victory " is a cut at Stanton, 
who last winter issued an order scouting the idea of " organizing 
victory," and rested on the sword of Gideon and Donnybrook 
Fair. I believe I will try to acknowledge them now, so I can 
send you the resolutions to-morrow. Pray keep them for May, 
with the thanks of Congress, etc. I have also some resolutions 
of the councils of Baltimore, which I have not yet replied to, 
and which I will send you in a day or two. 

Oct. 25. ... I hope my bridge at Berlin is finished, and if 
so I can cross some troops to-day, and shall be all ready to 
march the moment the cavalry is ready, which will be shortly. 
I don't think Lee will fight us nearer than Richmond. I expect 
no fight in this vicinity. ... My report is at last finished, and 
will, I presume, be copied to-day. ... I see that there is much 
impatience throughout the country for a move. I am just as 
anxious as any one, but am crippled by want of horses. ... I 



656 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORY. 

sent Bishop Mcllvaine over to Harper's Ferry in my ambulance. 
He is accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Clements. 

Oct. 26. ... I move a respectable number of troops across 
the Potomac to-day, the beginning of the general movement, 
which will, however, require several days to accomplish, for the 
cavalry is still terribly off. Yesterday a telegram received from 
the President asking what my " cavalry had done since the bat- 
tle of Antietam to fatigue anything." It was one of those little 
flings that I can't get used to when they are not merited. 

Pleasant Valley, Oct. . Since about three this morning it 
has been blowing a perfect gale ; several tents blown over, etc. 
The bishop preached a very good extempore sermon on faith ; 
a very impressive one it was, too. Service was in the little brick 
church that you remember just beyond the camp in the direc- 
tion of Brownsville. They are working very hard to tie my tent 
fast with ropes ; hope they will succeed. I strongly suspect our 
chances for breakfast are decidedly slim. Your father and I 
have been waiting for a very long time, and affairs don't seem 
to make progress. I confess that I am becoming hungry and 
cross very hungry and rather cross. . . . You had better send 
me two uniform frock-coats. I begin to present a terribly pov- 
erty-stricken appearance. Ah ! Andrew says that breakfast will 
soon be ready that " the wittles is wery slow cooking this here 
windy morning." I hope his estimate of time will not be out 
of the way much. 

Pleasant Valley, Oct. 27. I commenced the crossing yester- 
day. I returned a few moments ago from a trip to the s to 

say good-by to the bishop and to present your album. The visit 
was so characteristic that I can't omit telling you of it. I found 
the family at dinner in the kitchen. They wanted me to take 
some dinner in the dining-room, but I insisted upon sitting 
down with them in the kitchen, which delighted them beyond 
measure. The old lady went nearly frantic " to think of Gen. 
McClellan sitting down to dinner in the kitchen just like any 
common man," etc., etc. I got a little more than I bargained for 
in the shape of " the guard " coming in before I got through; but 
I kept on. The guard was rather more put out than I was, as he 



LETTERS. 657 

was a regular ; but he could not get out of the scrape without a 
scene, so he went through with it. The album created a terrific 
scene of delight. More " O mys " were expended on it than I 
have heard tor a couple of years or so. The old lady went almost 
out of her senses. I put the photographs in it for them, and 
wrote her name, with your regards, on one of the blank leaves. 
All sorts of inquiries were made about you, the baby, and mam- 
ma, and when I left Mrs. wished me to kiss the baby for 

her and " give gold love " to you. The old lady said that " she'd 
been a mind to send to me for some beef," so I told Bates just 
now to get a good large piece and take it up to them. They 
would not take any pay from the bishop, because Col. Hammond 
had sent more money to pay his bill than they thought right, so 
they squared accounts and cleared their consciences by refusing 
any pay from the bishop. Some artist of an illustrated paper 
had been there taking a sketch of the house, and left them a 
very good copy, which delighted them much. I gave them that 
copy of the President and myself which you sent them, so that I 
think they are now a very happy family. All of them sent very 
kind messages to you, which you can consider delivered. 

Q C f ^ Berlin. We are now near Berlin, and have a much 
better camp than the last one. My tent is at the bottom of a 
wooded ravine, and is perfectly sheltered from the wind, I am 
as comfortable as can be in a tent, and have a grass carpet 
instead of the dust and dirt which made the floor of my last 
tent. 

Oct. 30, Berlin. ... I have just been put in an excellent 
humor (?) by seeing that, instead of sending the drafted men to 
fill the old regiments (as had been promised me), they are form- 
ing them into new regiments. Also that, in face of the great 
want of cavalry with this army, they are sending the new cavalry 
regiments from Pennsylvania to Louisville instead of hither ! 
Blind and foolish they have ever been in Washington, and so, 
I fear, they will continue to the end. 

Berlin, Oct. . ... It will not do for me to visit Washing- 
ton now. ' The tone of the telegrams I receive from the authori- 
ties is such as to show that they will take advantage of anything 



658 McCLELLAN' S OWN STORY. 

possible to do me all the harm they can, and if I went down I 
should at once be accused of purposely delaying the movement. 
Moreover, the condition of things is such that I ought not to 
leave just now. The army is in the midst of the preliminary 
movements for the main march, and I must be at hand in this 
critical moment of the operation. ... If you could know the 
mean character of the despatches I receive you would boil over 
with anger. When it is possible to misunderstand, and when it 
is not possible ; whenever there is a chance of a wretched innu- 
endo, then it comes. But the good of the country requires me 
to submit to all this. 

Berlin, Oct. 31. ... I don't expect to move headquarters 
from here for a couple of days ; but in the meanwhile the troops 
are constantly crossing and the army getting into position for the 
advance. 

Oct. 31. If you can get to a comparatively permanent place 

you had better write to Dr. V to send the sash and sabre by 

express to you, for I should hate to lose the ugly, rusty old 
thing that is, if you would value it any ; and perhaps our little 
child might value it after you and I are dead and gone. Miss 

and two Misses were at camp to-day. Of course 

there was a general row among the youngsters, and I came in 
for my share of the trouble in the shape of a visitation for an 
hour or so. . . . I had a long visit from Mr. Bancroft, the histo- 
rian, to-day. 

Oct. 31 (after midnight). . . . From the despatches just 
received I think I will move headquarters over the river to-mor- 
row. The advance is getting a little too far away from me, and 
I wish to have everything well under my own hands, as I am 
responsible. 

Nov. 2, Berlin. . . . We are about starting to Wheatland, 
some eight or nine miles on the other side of the river. . . . 
Pleasonton had considerable skirmishing yesterday with Stuart's 
cavalry. They exceed ours vastly in numbers. There may be 
some infantry skirmishing to-day, but nothing serious. 

Nov. 4. . . . Slept under a tree last night, sharing what I 



PRIVATE LETTERS. 659 

had in the way of a bed with Gen. Reynolds. . . . There is some 
prospect of a tight to-day, but cannot tell exactly until I catch 
the extreme advance a couple of miles further on. 

Nov. 4, 11.30 P.M., near Middlcburg. ... We are in the 
full tide of success, so far as it is or can be successful to advance- 
without a battle. . . . To-morrow night I hope to strike the rail- 
road and telegraph again ; no telegraph within twenty-five miles 
of this. . 



Nov. 5, 9 P.M., camp near Rectortown. . . . After a con- 
siderable amount of marching and skirmishing we have worked 
our way thus far down into rebeldom. We have had delightful 
weather for marching and a beautiful country to travel through. 
. . . We left Berlin on Sunday morning, the headquarters stop- 
ping at Wheatland ; but I heard firing and rode to the front, going 
all the way to Snicker's Gap (to the top of the mountain) and 
spending the night at Snickersville. Next morning I rode to 
meet the train, but heard some more firing, and rode again to- 
wards the front, and spent the night near Bloomfield, camp be- 
ing some miles back. At Snickersville, I got a bed in a house to 
sleep in ; at Bloomfield I slept under a tree in the woods ; so that 
last night I was very glad, after another long ride, to get to my 
tent again. . . . Pleasonton has been doing very well again ; has 
had some skirmishing pretty much every day ; to-day he came 
across Jeb Stuart and thrashed him badly. Jeb outnumbered 
him two to one, but was well whipped ; there were some very 
pretty charges made. . . . 

Nov. 6, i P.M., camp near Rectortown. . . . The army still 
advances, but the machine is so huge and complicated that it 
is slow in its motions. 

Nov. 7, 2 P.M. . . . Sumner returned last night. Howard 
returned this morning. I go to Warrenton to-morrow. Rey- 
nolds is there now, Burnside at Waterloo, Bayard in front. 
Pleasonton and Averill are trying to catch Jeb Stuart again 
near Flint Hills. Couch is here, and moves to-morrow towards 
Warrenton. Porter and Franklin are at White Plains. Porter 
moves to-morrow to New Baltimore, thence next day to Warren- 



660 McCLELLAN'S OWN STORV. 

ton. Franklin moves day after to-morrow to New Baltimore. 
Sigel will remain at Thoroughfare Gap and the vicinity. The 
Manassas Gap road is in such bad order that we cannot depend 
upon it thus far up for supplies. Gainesville will be the depot 
until the Orange and Alexandria Railroad is open to Warrenton. 
We will have great difficulty in getting supplies by the Orange 
and Alexandria Railroad ; its capacity has been overrated. Lee 
is at Gordonsville. G. W. Smith was yesterday driven out of 
Warrenton. . . . 

11.30 P.M. Another interruption this time more important, 
It was in the shape of Burnside, accompanied by Gen. Bucking- 
ham, the secretary's adjutant-general. They brought with them 
the order relieving me from the command of the Army of the 
Potomac, and assigning Burnside to the command. No cause is 
given. I am ordered to turn over the command immediately 
and repair to Trenton, N. J., and on my arrival there to report 
by telegraph for further orders. ... Of course I was much sur- 
prised ; but as I read the order in the presence of Gen. Buck- 
ingham I am sure that not the slightest expression of feeling was 
visible on my face, which he watched closely. . . . They have 
made a great mistake. Alas for my poor country ! I know in 
my inmost heart she never had a truer servant. I have inform- 
ally turned over the command to Burnside, but shall go to-mor- 
row to Warrenton with him, and perhaps remain a day or two 
there in order to give him all the information in my power. . . . 
Do not be at all 'worried I am not. I have done the best I 
could for my country ; to the last I have done my duty as I 
understand it. That I must have made many mistakes I cannot 
deny. I do not see any great blunders ; but no one can judge 
of himself. Our consolation must be that we have tried to do 
what was right ; if we have failed it was not our fault. 

8 A.M. ... I am about starting for Warrenton. . . . 

Warrenton, Sunday, A.M. ... I expect to start to-morrow 
morning, and may get to Washington in time to take the after- 
noon train. ... I shall not stop in Washington longer than for 
the next train, and will not go to see anybody. I shall go on 
just as quietly as I can and make as little fuss as possible. . . . 
The officers and men feel terribly about the change. ... I learn 
to-day that the men are very sullen and have lost their good 



PK1VA TE LE TTERS. 66 I 

spirits entirely. It made me feel very badly yesterday when I 
rode among them and saw how bright and cheerful they looked 
and how glad they were to see me. Poor fellows ! they did not 
know the change that had occurred. . . . 

Warrenton, Nov. 10, 2 P.M. ... I am very well and taking 
leave of the men. I did not know before how much they loved 
me nor how dear they were to me. Gray-haired men came to 
me with tears streaming down their cheeks. I never before had 
to exercise so much self-control. The scenes of to-day repay 
me for all that I have endured.
