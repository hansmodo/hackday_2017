INTRODUCTION. 



To his surviving comrades of the Fifteenth Army Corps 
these letters and diary of their former fellow soldier, 
CHARLES W. WILLS, are respectfully dedicated. They do not 
profess to be a history of the war; only a chronicle of events 
recorded from day to day when the impressions were fresh 
and vivid. Some opinions are expressed which time after- 
wards modified or reversed. Doubts and criticism of the 
strategy of the commanding generals reflect the views that 
prevailed at the time they were written, and show, as the 
writer himself says, how little the actual fighting soldiers 
sometimes knew of what was going on around them. Neverthe- 
less it is believed that the story of courage, endurance, self- 
control and unflinching patriotism herein told, with character- 
istic modesty and quaint humor, and the life-like portrayal of 
incidents of the great struggle and of the social conditions pre- 
vailing in the Border and Seceding States during the contest 
will be found of interest and historic value. 

CHARLES WRIGHT WILLS was born in Canton, Fulton County, 
Illinois, April 17, 1840, of Pennsylvania parentage, and was 
educated in the Canton public schools and the State Normal 
School at Bloomington, Illinois. On the outbreak of the war, 
responding to the first call of President Lincoln for three 
months' volunteers, he enlisted in Company E, Eighth Illinois

Infantry, April 26th, 1861, and re-enlisted for three years at the 
end of his first term of service. Subsequently he was commis- 
sioned First Lieutenant and Battalion Adjutant of the Seventh 
Illinois Cavalry. When by order of the War Department in 
1862 all Battalion Adjutants were mustered out of service, he 
returned to Canton, raised a company in the One Hundred and 
Third Illinois Infantry, and was elected its Captain. In 1863 
Major General Oglesby appointed him upon his staff, but after 
a brief service as such, he gladly returned to active duty with 
his regiment, and on the resignation of Major Willison, was 
unanimously chosen to succeed him, though he was at that time 
the youngest Captain in the regiment. During the campaign in 
the Carolinas he was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel, but 
was never mustered. At the close of the war he settled in 
Louisiana and engaged in sugar planting. He died on his plan- 
tation at Jeannerette, on the banks of Bayou Teche, Louisiana, 
March 24, 1883, and was buried at Canton, Illinois. His 
widow now resides in Denver, Colorado.

Cairo, April 28, '61. 

This is the twilight of our first day here. We started from 
Peoria last Wednesday at n a. m. amid such a scene as I 
never saw before. Shouting, crying, praying, and shaking 



8 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

hands were the exercises. Along the whole line from Peoria 
to Springfield, from every house we had cheers and waving 
of handkerchiefs. Got to Springfield at dark and marched out 
to Camp Brick (it is a brickkiln) by moonlight. Our beds 
were of hay, scattered on the earthen floor of the dry shed. 
We had to sleep very close together, being cramped for room. 
Our eatables are bread, bacon, beef, coffee, beans, rice, po- 
tatoes and sugar and molasses and pickles. 

I had to quit last night because the light wouldn't wait for 
me. Well, we stayed at Camp Brick until Thursday 25th in 
the p. m., when we were marched over to Camp Yates to form 
a regiment. Ten companies of us, numbering from 93 to 125 
men in each, were trimmed down to 77 rank and file, each. 
This created considerable dissatisfaction and made a deal of 
very wicked swearing. Some of the men who were turned 
out of our company threatened to shoot our captain, but he 
is still living. After we were trimmed to the required num- 
ber we were sworn in by company and then quartered in 
Camp Yates, though we elected our officers first. You will 
see by the papers who they are. To be certain I will put them 
down: Colonel, Oglesby; Lieutenant Colonel, Rhoads; Major, 
Post; Captain, Denison; First Lieutenant, Wetzel; Second 
Lieutenant, Probstein. Our quarters are the old cattle stalls. 
Eight men are allowed the same room that one cow or jackass 
had. I heard Douglas Thursday night and cheered him for the 
first time in my life. Saturday night at 9 we started for this 
place. Flags were displayed from houses the whole distance, 
and the feeling seems as good here as at home. Sixty miles 
above here, at the Big Muddy bridge, occurred the only trouble 
the boys have had here. A lot of traitors from over the Ohio 
river tried to burn the bridge and are still trying to do it. A 
company of Chicago Zouaves are posted there with a 6 125 field 
piece. They shot at fellows spying around four times Saturday 
night. We are more afraid of ague here than of the enemy. 
We drink no liquors and keep ourselves as cleanly as possible. 
There are 3,000 of us here and we think we can hold it against 
15,000. If they cut the levee the river is so low that we will not 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 9 

be flooded. We have 15 cannons now and will have 15 more 
to-day. We stop every boat that passes and take off all pro- 
visions and ammunition and clothing. The boys are allowed 
to appropriate what clothing they need from that which is 
seized. There are now 5,000 men twenty miles below here, 
at Columbus, Ky., who intended trying to take this spot, but 
the arrival of our regiment will, it is thought, stop that move- 
ment. It is well worth their trouble to take us for we have 
thousands of dollars worth of their goods here which are 
seized. You cannot conceive anything like the feeling that 
possesses our troops here. Although about half of us are 
green, raw militia, and will need discipline to make us what 
we should be, yet to a man they all pray for an assault. Ken- 
tucky, right across the river, is as strongly for secession as 
Mississippi can be, and I have no doubt but that we will be 
attacked the latter part of this week if no more troops come. 

Our quarters here are much the same as at Camp Yates. 
The shed in which our company sleep is entirely open to the 
south, and very well ventilated otherwise. It is quite warm 
here though, and we all go in our shirt sleeves even when off 
duty. The trees are nearly in full leaf and grain is up eight 
or nine inches. 

If any boys go from Canton, they should have a pair of 
woolen undershirts, ditto drawers, and two flannel overshirts, 
woolen stockings (feet don't blister as quick in them) and a 
heavy blanket or pair of light ones. Our company all have 
a revolver (Colt) and knife each. Mine were given to me 
by friends in Peoria. 

This is a lovely place a gorgeous hole! It smells just like 
that bottom below Dorrance's mill, and will breed fever and 
ague enough to disable all the men in this state. I just now 
hear the boys saying that we move to-morrow up the river 
to form a battery to stop a move expected from the Rebels. 
We can't rely on any of these rumors, though. The boys 
are shooting at marks all round us with their revolvers. I 
shoot about as well as any of them. 



IO ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

George Bestor, Jr., sits near me and just now said that he 
saw a man from Memphis this morning, who said that they 
were making preparation to come up here and take this Point, 
relying partly on the disloyal citizens for help. They will 
have a good time of it. 

Cairo, May 5, 1861, Sunday, 11 a. m. 

The bells are just ringing for church. I intended going, 
but it is such hard work getting out of camp that I concluded 
to postpone it. Anyway, we have service in camp this p. m. 
This is an awful lazy life we lead here. Lying down on our 
hay constitutes the principal part of the work. As our rou- 
tine might be of interest to you, I will give it. At 5 a. m. the 
reveille is sounded by a drum and fife for each regiment. We 
arise, fold our blankets in our knapsacks and prepare to march. 
We then "fall in," in front of our quarters for roll-call ; after 
which we prepare our breakfast and at the "breakfast call" 
(taps of the drum at 7) we commence eating; and the way 
we do eat here would astonish you. At 9 a. m. we fall in for 
company drill. This lasts one hour. Dinner at 12. Squad 
drill from I to 3 and supper at 5 130. At 6 p. m. the whole 
regiment is called out for parade. This is merely a review by 
the colonel, and lasts not more than 30 minutes and often but 
15. After 8 p. m. singing and loud noises are stopped ; at 9 130 
the tattoo is beat when all are required to be in quarters, and 
at three taps at 10 p. m. all lights are put out, and we leave 
things to the sentries. Our company of 77 men is divided into 
six messes for eating. Each mess elects a captain, and he is 
supreme, as far as cooking and eating are concerned. Our 
company is considered a crack one here and we have had the 
post of honor assigned us, the right of the regiment, near the 
colors. Our commanders, I think, are anticipating some work 
here, though they keep their own counsels very closely. They 
have spies out in all directions, down as far as Vicksburg. I 
think that Bradley's detective police of Chicago are on duty in 
this vicinity. We also have two very fleet steamers on duty 
here to stop boats that refuse to lay to, and to keep a lookout 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. II 

up and down the Mississippi river. Yesterday, p. m., I noticed 
considerable bustle at headquarters which are in full view of 
our quarters, and at dark last night 20 cartridges were dis- 
tributed to each man, and orders given to reload revolvers 
and to prepare everything for marching at a minute's notice, 
and to sleep with our pistols and knives in our belts around us. 
That's all we know about it though. We were not aroused 
except by a shot at about 2 this morning. I heard a little 
while ago that it was a sentinel shooting at some fellow scout- 
ing around. The Rebels have a host of spies in town but I 
think they are nearly all known and watched. The men con- 
fidently expect to be ordered south shortly. Nothing would 
suit them better. I honestly believe that there is not a man 
in our company that would sell his place for $100. We call 
the camp Fort Defiance, and after we receive a little more 
drilling we think we can hold it against almost any number. 
We have 3,300 men here to-day, but will have one more regi- 
ment to-day and expect still more. 

We are pretty well supplied with news here; all the dailies 
are offered for sale in camp, but we are so far out of the way 
that the news they bring is two days old before we get them. 
Transcripts and Unions are sent to us by the office free. I 
wish you would send me the Register once and a while, and 
put in a literary paper or two, for we have considerable time 
to read. We have a barrel of ice water every day. Milk, 
cake and pies are peddled round camp, and I indulge in milk 
considerably at five cents a pint. Everything is much higher 
here than above. Potatoes, 50 cents; corn, 60 cents, etc. It 
has been raining like blue blazes since I commenced this, and 
the boys are scrambling around looking for dry spots on the 
hay and trying to avoid the young rivers coming in. Almost 
all are reading or writing, and I defy anyone to find 75 men 
without iany restraint, paying more respect to the Sabbath. 
We have not had a sick man in camp. Several of the boys, most 
all of them in fact, have been a little indisposed from changfe 
of diet and water, but we have been careful and are now all 
right. There are 25, at least, of us writing here, all lying on 
our backs. I have my paper on a cartridge box on my knees.

Camp Defiance, May n, '61. 

We have been seeing and feeling the roughest side of camp 
life, ever since my last. Rain in double-headed torrents; 
lightning that will kill easily at five miles ; thundering thunder ; 
and wind from away back. But the mud dries like water on 
a hot brick, and six hours sun makes our parade ground fit 
for drill. Afternoon when the sun is out its hot enough to 
scorch a phoenix; yesterday we drilled from I to 3. I was 
almost crisped, and some of the boys poured a pint of grease 
out of each boot after we finished. Up to 10 last night when 
I went to sleep it was still boiling, but at five this morning, 
when we got up, we shivered in coat, vest and blankets. 
Bully climate ! And then the way that the rain patters down 
through the roof, now on your neck ; move a little and spat it 
goes, right into your ear, and the more you try to get away 
from it the more you get, until disgusted, you sit up and see 
a hundred chaps in the same position. A good deal of laugh- 
ing, mixed with a few swears follows, and then we wrap our 
heads in the blankets, straighten out, "let her rip." I never 
was in better health, have gained four pounds since we started, 
and feel stronger and more lively than I have for a coon's age. 
Health generally excellent in our company, because we are 
all careful. There has not been a fight yet in the whole camp. 
A man was shot dead last night by one of the guards by ac- 
cident. We have a fellow in the guardhouse whom we arrested 
a couple of days since as a spy. He is almost crazy with 
fear for his future. His wife is here and has seen him. His 
trial comes off this p. m. We all hope that he will be hung, 
for he laid forty lashes on the back of a man down south a 
few weeks since, who is now a volunteer in our camp. The 
boys would hang him in a minute but for the officers. 

The news of the fuss in St. Louis has just reached us. We 
suppose it will send Missouri kiting out of the Union. Gen- 
eral Prentiss has some information (don't know what it iS) 
that makes our officers inspect our arms often and carefully. 
I know that he expects a devil of a time here shortly, and 
preparations of all kinds are making for it. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 13 

The boys are just now having a big time over a letter in 
the Transcript of the loth, signed W. K. G. Of course it is 
a bundle of lies. We have given nine groans and three tiger 
tails for the writer W. K. G. A man just from Mobile is in 
camp now. He landed this morning. He took off his shirt 
and showed a back that bore marks of 30 strokes. They laid 
him across a wooden bench and beat him with a paling. His 
back looks harder than any one I ever saw. He says that 
nine men were hung the day before he left, good citizens, and 
men whose only crime was loyalty to the United States Gov- 
ernment. They would not volunteer under the snake flag. 
He reports 1,500 men at Memphis, a few at Columbus, only 
50 at Mobile, and none worth mentioning at other points. A 
man has been here this morning from 20 miles up the river 
in Missouri. He wants arms for four companies of Union 
men that have formed there, and who are expecting an attack 
from the secessionists. The Union men have but 20 shotguns 
now. A boat came up yesterday crowded with passengers. 
Looked as though she might have a thousand on her. All 
Northerners. 

One of the boys has just come in with a report that there 
are "to a dead certainty" 5,000 men now at Columbus (20 
miles below) who have just arrived this morning. They are 
after Cairo. The boys are all rumor proof, though, and the 
above didn't get a comment. One of the boys has just ex- 
pressed my feelings by saying : "I don't believe anything, only 
that Cairo is a damned mud hole." I have not stood guard 
yet a minute. Have been on fatigue duty is the reason. A 
general order was given last night for every man to bathe 
at least twice a week. Most of us do it every day. The Ohio 
is warm enough and I swim every night now. There were 
over 2,000 of us in at once last night. We had a candy pull- 
ing this p. m. There was an extra gallon in to-day's rations, 
and we boiled it and had a gay time. Our company is, I be- 
lieve, the orderly one here. We have lots of beer sent us 
from Peoria, and drink a half barrel a day while it lasts. (Do 
those two statements tally?) 



14 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIFJR. 

Sunday, May I2th, 6 p. m. 

Several men from Alabama arrived here to-day with their 
backs beaten blue. We caught another spy last night. The 
drums rolled last night at n and we all turned out in the 
biggest, dark and deepest mud you ever saw. It was 
a mistake of the drummer's. Six rockets were let off and he 
thought that they stood for an attack but they were only sig- 
nals for steamboats. We thought sure we were attacked, but 
the boys took it cool as could be, and I think never men felt 
better over a prospect for a fight. Two hundred troops have 
landed since I commenced writing this time. Just now the 
clouds seem to be within 100 yards of the ground. Prospect 
of a tremendous storm. I am writing standing up in ranks 
for evening roll call. 

May 17, 1861. 

Sun and dust. Hot as the deuce. Lots of drilling 

and ditto fun. Suits me to a T. Am going in for three years 
as quick as I can. All chance for fight is given up here. We 
are getting sharp. We trade off our extra fodder for pies, 
milk and good things. 

It's too hot to write. I am going to sleep. 

Cairo, May 23, 1861. 

Lots of men come through here with their backs blue and 
bloody from beatings ; and nine in ten of them got their marks 
in Memphis. A man from St. Louis was in camp a few days 
since with one-half of his head shaved, one-half of a heavy 
beard taken off, two teeth knocked out and his lips all cut with 
blows from a club. This was done in Memphis the day be- 
fore I saw him. My health continues excellent. Never felt 
so well, and think that care is all that is necessary to preserve 
my health as it is. I can't think that this Illinois climate is 
mean enough to give a fellow the chills, after it has raised 
him as well as it has me. 

I never enjoyed anything in the world as I do this life, and 
as for its spoiling me, you'll see if I don't come out a better 
man than when I went in. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 15 

We have commenced fortifying this Point. One company 
is detailed every day to work on this. It is said that it will 
cost three million. As for enlisting for three years, I can't, 
or rather won't say now. Tis a sure thing that as long as 
this war continues I will not be satisfied at home, and if I 
would there will certainly be no business. There is no use 
trying to coax me now for I can't tell until my three month's 
are up. Then, if I feel as now, I shall certainly go in for the 
war. Our company gets compliments from all the newspaper 
correspondents. 

The whole camp is aching to be ordered to Memphis. Bird's 
Point is not occupied. We had a company there for one day 
but withdrew them. 

I commenced this about 12 last night in the hospital, but I 
had so much to do and there were so infernal many bugs that 
I concluded to postpone it. We do have the richest assort- 
ment of bugs here imaginable, from the size of a pin-head up 
to big black fellows as large as bats. I was sitting up with an 
old schoolmate from Bloomington, whose company have gone 
up to Big Muddy and left him to the tender care of our sur- 
geons. The poor devil would die in a week but for the care 
he gets from a dozen of us here that used to go to school with 
him. There are about 50 men in our regiment's hospital, and 
save the few that go up to care for their friends unasked, the 
poor fellows have no attendance nights. I gave medicine to 
four beside my friend last night, two of whom are crazy with 
fever. One of the latter insisted on getting up alt the time, 
and twice he got down stairs while I was attending the others. 
Not one of our company is there, thank heaven. 

Yesterday our company with the whole /th Regiment were 
at work on the fortifications. Wheeling dirt and mounting 
guns was the exercise. The guns we mounted are 36 pounders 
and weigh three and one-half tons each. Our regiment, ex- 
cept this company, are at the same work to-day. To-morrow 
the 9th works. General Prentiss paid us a very handsome 
compliment in saying that our company did more work than 
any two companies have yet done in the same time. You 



l6 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

should see our hands. Mine are covered with blisters. You 
might as well be making up your mind to the fact that I am 
not coming home soon. There is but one thing in the way to 
prevent my going in for the war. That is the talk of cutting 
off the heads of all lieutenants over 25 years of age, and of 
all captains over 35. Now under that arrangement all three 
of our officers will lose their heads, and we know we cannot 
replace them with as good. This thing, though not certain 
yet, has created a great deal of excitement in camp, and if it 
goes into effect will smash our company completely. Our 
company is the best officered of any in camp. There are no 
two sides to that proposition. 

You'll see that your Canton company will not regret the 
selection of officers they have made. The companies here 
with inexperienced officers have worlds of trouble, and five 
captains and one lieutenant, though good men at home, have 
resigned at the wish of their companies. Four of these com- 
panies tried to get our first lieutenant for captain, but he won't 
leave us. The thousand men who occupied Bird's Point the 
other day are most all Germans ; many of them "Turners," and 
a very well drilled regiment. They will get their cannons from 
St. Louis next week. None of the men expect an attack here, 
but we know that General Prentiss thinks it at least possible, 
and from his actions we think he expects it. A family were 
in camp yesterday who were driven away from a place only 
12 miles from here in Missouri, and left a son there with a 
bullet through his brains. It happened yesterday morning. 
We have had our uniforms about a week. Gray satinet pants 
and roundabout, with a very handsome blue cloth cap. Nine 
brass buttons up the jacket front and grey flannel shirts. We 
are obliged to wash dirty clothes the day we change and to 
black our shoes every evening, and polish our buttons for 
dress parade. Our company is the only one that does this 
though, and they call us dandies. We have done more work 
and better drilling though, than any of them, so we don't 
mind it. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. I/ 

Cairo, June 9, 1861. 

I have been over to Bird's Point this morning for the first 
time. They have thrown up breastworks and dug a deep 
ditch outside of them, making a pretty strong camp. We 
don't apprehend a shade of a fuss here but the officers are 
making as much preparation as if a Waterloo No. 2 were 
coming. I went to old Bird's house this morning. It is just 
like the pictures we have seen in Harper's of southern plant- 
ers' homes. A wide, railed porch extends around two sides of 
the house from the floor of each story. On the lower porch 
sat Bird and his family talking with a number of officers and 
their ladies. Looked very pleasant. Back of the house were 
the quarters filled with 46 of the ugliest, dirtiest niggers I ever 
saw, dressed in dirty white cotton. Awful nasty ! The soldiers 
at the point have plenty of shade. We have but one tree on 
our grounds. The boys took a lot of ammunition from Bird 
the other day, and also another lot from a nest five miles back 
in Missouri. It was all given back, however, as private prop- 
erty. Our whole brigade of six regiments had a parade yes- 
terday. We are all uniformed now and I think we made a 
respectable appearance. The general gave us a special notice. 
Are the Canton boys going or not? Do they drill? We have 
been sleeping on hay up to this week, but have thrown it away, 
and now have but the bare boards. The change has been so 
gradual from featherbed at home to plank here that I can't 
think where it troubled me the least. I had a mattress in 
Peoria, straw in Springfield, and hay here. Our living is now 
very good. Fresh' beef every day, potatoes, rice and beans. 

Cairo, June 13, 1861. 

I am converted to the belief that Cairo is not such a bad 
place after all. The record shows that less deaths have oc- 
curred here in seven weeks among 3,000 men, than in Villa 
Ridge (a higher, and much dryer place with abundant shade 
and spring water), in five weeks among 1,000. There has 
been but one death here by disease in that time, and that with 
miserable hospital accommodations. The soldiers lie like the

d : 1 about Cairo. The days are hot of course, but we do 
nothing now between 8 a. m. and 9 p. m. but cook and eat, 
so that amounts to not n T as much as working all day at 
home. The mosquitoes and bugs are furious from 6 p. m. to 
n, but we are drilling from 7 p. m. to nearly 9, and from that 
to ii we save ourselves by smoking, which we all do pretty 
steadily. The nights after n are splendidly cool, so much so 
that we can cover ourselves entirely in our blankets, which 
is a block game on the mosquitoes, and sleep like logs. I be- 
lieve those Camp Mather boys are hard sticks from the ac- 
counts we get of their fingers sticking to chickens, vegetables, 
etc. The citizens here say that the boys have not taken a thing 
without permission, or insulted a citizen. "Bully for us." 

We had a little fun yesterday. At 8 p. m. we (the Peoria 
and Pekin companies) were ordered to get ready for march- 
ing in ten minutes. So ready we got (but had to leave knap- 
sacks, canteens and blankets) and were marched down to the 
"City of Alton," which had on board a six pounder and one 
12 pound howitzer. We cast off, fired a salute of two guns 
and steamed down the Mississippi. After five miles the 
colonel (Oglesby) called us together, told us that he was out 
on a reconoitering expedition, and his information led him to 
think we should be forced into a little fight before we got 
back. We were then ordered to load and keep in our places 
by our guns. At Columbus we saw a secesh flag waving but 
passed on a couple of miles farther where he expected to find 
a secesh force. Failed and turned back. At Columbus the 
flag was still waving and the stores all closed, and quite a 
crowd collected on the levee, but one gun though, that we 
could see. The colonel ordered the flag down. They said 
they wouldn't do it. He said he would do it himself then. 
They answered, "We'd like to see you try it." We were drawn 
up then round the cabin deck guards next the shore in two 
ranks, with guns at "ready," and the captain jumped ashore 
and hauled down the serpent. We were all sure of a skirmish 
but missed it. Flag was about 15x7, with eight stars and

; 

three stripes. I send .you some scraps of it. They raised 
another flag one hour after we left and sent us word to "Come 
and take it." The ride on the river was the best treat I've had 
for two years. 

Cairo, June 23, 1861. 

Camp is very dull now, and we are more closely confined 
in it than ever. Not a soldier goes out now except in 
company with a commissioned officer or on a pass from the 
general. The latter not one in a thousand can get and the 
former maybe one in five hundred. 

We have no drilling now between 8 a. m. and 7 p. m. 
on account of the heat; so we have plenty of spare time. 
If I only had some good books! But I can't send for 
them now for our colonel keeps us about half excited all 
the time with a prospect of a move. He says we have two 
chances: First, if General McClellan suffers anything like 
a serious repulse in Western Virginia, our whole brigade 
will move out on two hours' notice. Second, if any reliable 
reports come of Arkansas troops moving into Missouri, 
we will double quick over the river and leave the Point to 
some other troops. The last is the" most likely chance. 
A thousand of our boys went off on the "City of Alton" at 
dark last night. We don't know where to, but 'tis rumored 
that they went up the Mississippi 25 miles and then marched 
back into Missouri 30 miles to intercept a train of wagons 
loaded with provisions going south. The colonel made 
them a speech ; told them they were sure to have a brush 
and asked them if they would sustain the credit of the 8th. 
You should have heard them shout ! Only two companies 
went from our regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Rhoads. 
The Battallion was under Colonel Morgan. The three 
year question causes more excitement than every thing 
else now. Nearly our whole company will go. The most 
worthless fellows are the ones that will go home. I feel 
as if my place is here. I know I could not content myself 
at home, and if I could, every young man with no one

depending upon him is needed in the army more than 
anywhere else. I know I have your approval in this re- 
solve, but I would like to have you tell me so. The Ameri- 
cans in our company think some of seceding, filling up 
from home with American boys and letting the Dutch now 
in the company paddle their own canoe. I wonder if we 
could not get a dozen good strong fellows from Canton. 
We don't want any poorer men than I am, for we are going 
to make a crack company. 

Cairo, July I, 1861. 

Writing letters is getting to be harder work than drilling, 
and is more dreaded by the boys. Lots of people are 
visiting the camp now, many of them ladies, but I tell you 
that they use their fans more than their spy-glasses after a 
very few looks. 

I was up to Mound City yesterday with nine others of 
our company on a United States boat that has three can- 
nons on her. Mound City is a beautiful little place, and 
takes it name from a mound about 30 feet in diameter and 
10 feet high, on which grow a dozen spindling locusts. I 
have been about 12 miles up each river from the point here. 
At that distance the river banks are, say 25 feet high, and 
slope down to the point, and run into a broad wide sandbar 
that ends Illinois. 

Fishing is a principal amusement or time-killer now. I 
have fished about four days and caught nary a "minner." 

There is no outside influence used to induce a man to 
re-enlist. Officers tell every man to use his own judgment, 
Y' and each fellow does his own thinking and another long 
dash or words to that effect. 

Cairo, July 27, 1861 

We number now about 60 and have 25 days in which to 

\J fill up to loo. Two hundred and fifty of our regiment of 

three-months' men have re-enlisted. Two hundred and 

fifty out of 680, which is considerably better than any 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 21 

eastern regiment that I have seen mentioned. There was 
not a sick man in our company when we returned, and 
there is not now. One of the boys just tells me that 
day before yesterday morning there were but eight in 
the regiment hospital. Three men from our regiment 
have died in three and a half months. One of these I 
know killed himself with imprudence. I have telegraphed 
to the boys to be in Peoria Wednesday. I have not the 
least idea that any of them will back out. It does seem 
real good to be back here again where a fellow can swing 
himself and lay around loose with sleeves up, collar open, 
(or shirt off if it suits him better) hair unkempt, face 
unwashed and everything un-anything. It beats clerking 
ever so much ! We were paid off yesterday. The privates 
received $56.72 each in gold, silver and copper, which is 
$24.00 more than we expected. 

We are having some more excitement in camp to-day. 
A rumored attack in prospect on Bird's Point is the sub- 
ject. We are putting the recruits through in two-forty- 
style to get them ready. Twenty rounds of cartridges were 
served to us at noon to-day, and Prentiss' aids are gal- 
loping round as if tight. About one quarter of the recruits 
have their accoutrements on, and some of them scoot up 
on the levee every ten minutes to look at the Point. We 
have all kinds of rumors of from 2,000 to 15,000 Rebels 
within from 6 to 15 miles of us, but if 20 preachers would 
swear to the truth, there's not one man that has been here 
three months would believe it. Been fooled too often! 
Our officers are careful though, and treat every thing from 
head-quarters as reliable till the contrary is proven. 

It is a horrid trip from Peoria to Cairo as the trains run 
now. We laid over three hours in El Paso, and eleven 
hours in Centralia; from n p. m. till 10 a. m. Awful! and 
rode down from Centralia in an accommodation freight. 
The bed was excellent at home, but I think that sleeping 
on boards rests me better and I know I sleep sounder. 



: 

22 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Have worked two hours hard at cleaning up quarters and 
eating supper since my last period. Supper consisted of 
coffee, bread and butter, and cold steak pickled in vinegar. 
Vinegar is a great improvement on cold beef, I wonder you 
never adopted it. We have a prime lot of boys this time. 
There are not ten out of the whole company that I would 
not like to have for associates at home. I don't believe 
that one of them will ever take quarters in the guard-house. 

I think our company Will be full in ten days. We have re- 
fused lots of roughs here in camp also in Peoria, but three or 
four little ones have crept in through acquaintances' influence. 
Those men we have will learn to drill in half less time than 
any other lot of recruits on the ground, because they have a 
pride in their appearance and dress, and that has given 
them a better carriage and command of themselves than 
rougher customers have. 

We will have in a few days nothing but new recruits here ex- 
cept the fractions of regiments that have re-enlisted ; the loth, 
which calls itself the crack regiment of the post, will all leave 
for home day after to-morrow. If it does not come back full 
in 30 days it will be disbanded. This is Prentiss' old regiment. 

Tattoo 9 p. m. They are really expecting an attack on 
Bird's Point, and we will all be kept close in quarters evenings 
after sunset till the scare dies away. One of our boys that 
stood guard at the hospital this morning says the surgeon 
told him that the sick would be brought from the Point to 
Cairo to-day. Don't know whether they did it or not. 

We were coming on the cars when we heard of the Manas- 
sas rout. The boys gave three cheers, for they imagined it 
would bring us marching orders. I would like very much to 
hear such orders, but would a devilish sight rather march 
with men that have had three months' drill than with these 
new recruits. You can't imagine what a difference there is 
in one's confidence in a drilled and undrilled company of 
men. Don't say anything about our expectations of an 
attack here for there has been a great deal too much said 
already on going-to-be attacks on this Point 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 23 

We pay five cents a pint here for milk, and I found a 
wiggler in a pint this morning. Don't you think they ought 
to mix clean water with the cow juice? 

Sunday, I p. m. I have just woke up from a two hours' 
sleep that had more dreams than all the sleeping I ever did 
before. I dreamed everything from being a partner of Adam 
and Eve in their orchard down to seeing Stephens' iron 
battery. 

Cairo, August 2, 1861. 

Hot! You don't know what that word means. I feel that 
I have always been ignorant of its true meaning till this week, 
but am posted now, sure. The (supposed-to-be) "never fail- 
ing cool, delicious breeze" that I have talked about so much, 
seems to be at "parade rest" now and I can't do justice to 
the subject. The health of the camp is much better now than 
at any time before, since we have been here. There is not a 
sick man in our company. My health remains gorgeous. We 
drill now five hours a day, under a sun that cooks eggs in 13 
minutes, but we think we feel the heat no more walking than 
lying around the quarters. 

The seceshers this morning took the packet that has been 
plying between here and Columbus, and haye run her off down 
to Memphis. I thought that Prentiss stopped her sometime 
since, but this at last closes all communication between the 
North and South at this point. Our "ossifers" we think are 
really scared about an attack here, but you could not make 
the soldiers believe in the like till they see the fight begin. 
About a thousand of our men were rushed off to Bird's Point 
to-day to work on intrenchments, and won't they sweat? 

My chum heard Colonel Oglesby tell an officer two hours ago 
that there were 17,000 Rebels within 15 miles of the Point. 
The scouts reported this body at New Madrid, 40 mfle^ down 
the Mississippi, two days since. Yesterday 12 men from the 
Pekin company and 12 from our's with some artillerymen 
went 30 miles up the Mississippi to collect all the boats we 



24 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

could find on the Missouri shore. We found three large flats 
tied up to trees along the shore which we confiscated. One of 
them wasn't very good so we sunk it. The object was to 
prevent marauders from visiting Illinois. I had charge of 
the men from our company. 

Cairo, August n, '61. 

Our Canton boys came down on time, and right glad I am 
to have them here. Colonel Ross's i7th Regiment got here 
the same day by the river. The boys were sworn into our 
company the day after they arrived, and the day following a 
lieutenant in the Fulton Blues came over to get them to join 
his company. I am glad he was too late. We have all been 
over to the Point to visit the Canton boys of the i/th, and 
found them looking very well. Will Trites, alone, looks unwell. 
A few weeks at home is what he really needs, for he will not 
give up work and go on the sick list as he ought to, as long 
as he can stand. Billy Stockdale, Chancey Black, George 
Shine, Billy Resor and Jesse Beeson are in No. I condition. 
Their tents are pitched in old Bird's cornfield from which the 
corn has just been cut and you can imagine that the stubble is 
not equal to feathers to lie upon. They call us boys that live 
in barracks in Cairo, Sunday soldiers and Fourth of July 
braves; the same names we applied to them when they were 
in Camp Mather. The Canton boys in our company get along 
finely. They are in the best of spirits and already appear quite 
soldierly. They are well satisfied with the company which 
now numbers 90 men and will be full this week. We all room 
together except John Wallace and Milo Farewell. We are 
now drilling about six hours a day, but the greenhorns act as 
though they think it fun. We don't suffer from the heat as 
much as one would think, and can you believe it the health of 
the camp is better now than ever before. We have not in our 
company a man on the sick list. Major Smith (our old friend 
Marion), says that the i/th have been healthier at Bird's Point 
than they ever were before; and so every regiment says that 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2$ 

comes here. If there are any very old people in Canton that 
want to live 50 or 60 years longer, advise them to come to 
Cairo. Mosquitoes and fleas are around these times. The 
whole family are here. 

Cairo, August 19, 1861. 

The boys are writing to-day for some butter and things 
from home. The expense by express from Peoria is not worth 
speaking of and the other boys have things sent them often. 
We have made up our minds to lying here six weeks longer at 
least, and conclude that time will pass better with a few home 
extras to grace our table. 

Cairo, September i, 1861. 

We had blankets given us this last week and new accoutre- 
ments throughout. If they would only change our guns now 
we would have nothing but a move to ask for. A uniform was 
also furnished us last week. It is of excellent all-wool goods, 
and not so heavy as to be uncomfortable. The color is very 
fine grey, the pants are fashionably cut and equal to such as 
would cost six dollars in Peoria. The coats have short skirts 
and are rather fancifully trimmed with blue. It is much the 
best uniform I have seen yet, although it costs but $13. We 
will have a fatigue suit shortly. Yesterday we were mustered 
for pay. We will get our first month's wages this week "they 
say." There are wagons and mules here now by the hundreds, 
and when our tents are ready (they are here now) we will be 
ready to move. I think there must be near 10,000 men here 
now. Logan's, Pugh's, Buford's, and another's regiment; 
Hick's and Raritan's came in last week. The first three be- 
long to McCormick's Brigade. General McClernand is here 
now. Every one thinks we will move in a very few days. I 
kind o' feel it in my bones, too, but it is too good to be true, 
so I'm taking all the bets I can from 10 cents worth of peanuts 
to a half bushel of apples, I betting that we are here two 
weeks from now. I've got them any way, for if we move, I 
hope to be able to borrow apples, etc., from the seceshers to 



26 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

pay my little bills, and if I stay here I'll have some eatables free 
for consolation. We Canton boys have hired a cook for our- 
selves and are living much better than I ever did before in 
camp. 

Our cook is a jewel, and by trading off rations keeps us in 
clover all the time. He sets a better table for us than the 
Peoria house boarders eat from, honestly. An old schoolmate 
of mine in our mess furnishes us with milk. He and John 
Wallace go out every night about 2 or 3 o'clock and some- 
body's cow don't milk well next morning. .We'll never have 
such times sojering again, but you can't imagine how we do 
want to get over into Missouri or Arkansas. We don't have 
half as easy times as these at home and but for the discipline 
it wouldn't seem like soldiering. I've been bored like sin the 
last two weeks drilling new recruits, but I'm glad of it, for 
it is rather pleasant to me to have something disagreeable w'hen 
I'm bored feeling good. John Keefer and John Wallace, so far, 
make as good .soldiers as any men in camp, Keef's game leg 

^working against him, too. All our boys are just the men .for 
soldiers. It comes perfectly naturally to Sid. and Sam. Theo. 
has been in bad health for a. week, but I think he is improving 
now. Fred Norcott is a splendid boy. He and Sam match 

.well. Charley Cooper is acting as post orderly, that is, stays 
at headquarders of the Post Commandant, preserves order 
there and carries messages, dispatches, etc., to the .different 
colonels. A good place but very confusing. 

I have been visiting Colonel Raritan's and Hick's Gamp this 
p.:m. They have no guns yet and their sentinels stand guard 
with sticks. Looks funny. 

We have about 50 prisoners here now. They think they are 
treated splendidly and say that if any of our boys fall into their 
hands they will remember it. Several of them are very intel- 
ligent-appearing men. One of them is about as big as a house 
with a foot like a cooking stove. Charley Maple .wrote down 
to us that he wants to join our company; Keefer wrote him to 

come. I have to remark once more that the "health of camp 
is better than ever before," your sarcastic remark not having 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 27 

affected our sanitary condition in the least. You will please 
make no more impertinent remarks or comments on my letters! 

A. H. White was down here last Sabbath, and he and I found 
Frank Smith in Smith's Artillery. I have been here right by 
him four months without knowing it and lived. He is a cor- 
poral. He, A. H., and I drank some beer, discussed the af- 
fairs of the nation and adjourned. Do you remember Enos 
Lincoln? He is here in the J2th. 

We have had some fighting in camp lately. An artillery. man 
stabbed one of the Qth and got knocked, kicked and bayoneted 
for it. The artillery ha,ve sworn to have revenge and every 
hickory man (the 9th have a fatigue suit of hickory) they see 
they pounce onto. They haye a .skirmish every day. One of 
our company got drunk to-day, , got to fighting, was .sent to 
the guardhouse, tried. to break out, guard knocked him down 
.with a gun, cut his cheek open, etc. He then. got into a fight 
with four other men in the guard house and of all the bunged 
eyes and bloody faces -they beat the record. 

Qairo, September 9, j80i 

The refreshments and drygoods from .home arrived 
Saturday. We were at Paducah then and they, w^re tajken 
care of by .two or three pf the lame and halt, that were not 
in traveling order and., were left behind. .We returned this 
morning and after acknowledging the excellence, profusion, 
.variety, gorgeousness, ,and confiscarity of your benevolent 
appropriation to our temporal .wants, L.will particularize 
by saying that you needn't worry about your picture, as 
it is in my possession ; th,at the cakes are both numerous 
.and excellent, that the pickles are prodigious in .quantity, 
beautiful in quality and remarkably acceptable. That the 
butter and cheese are non ad com valorum. The tobacco 
and Hostetter, the boys say, are very fine. To Mrs. De,wey 
,and Mrs. Heald. we all return thanks and send our kind 
respects and love. We have sent a share of the eatables to 
the Canton boys of the i/th, which is again encamped 
near us; this time on the Kentucky shore. They are hard 



28 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

at work to-day cutting down trees, clearing away for a 
camp ground. I have seen none of them yet. We had the 
nicest little trip to Paducah, that ever soldiers had. We 
have just received orders to get ready to start in five 
minutes. 

Time extended a little. We had 1,500 troops in Paducah, 
Ky., and received information that they would be attacked 
Saturday, so Friday night 350 of us were sent up as an 
advance. Now we go. 

Camp Norfolk, September 12, 1861. 
Agreeable to our very short notice we packed our knap- 
sacks, put three days rations in our haversacks, were 
carried across the river to Bird's Point in two boats (our 
whole regiment), and just at dark started out through the 
woods. 'Twas a confounded, dark, dirty, narrow road, and 
I was right glad when the word "halt" was given and 
preparations made for bunking in for the night. The next 
morning we started again along down the river, the gun- 
boats, two of them, keeping a couple of miles ahead of us. 
We started with a couple of pieces of field artillery, but the 
road got so bad that we had to leave it after about three 
miles. We advanced about five miles when the gunboats, 
which were about a mile and one-half ahead of us, opened 
mouth, and thunder! what a rumpus they did keep up. We 
could not see them for the thick brush between us and the 
river, but we thought sure our little fight had come at last. 
We were drawn up in the front yard of some secesher's 
deserted house (a fine one), and the colonel with a small 
party went ahead to reconnoiter. While they were gone we 
ate our dinners, and made ready for the expected march and 
fight. But the colonel on his return, scooted us back to our 
morning's starting place. Whew, but that was a sweating 
old march. About an hour after we started back, 15 of our 
cavalry scouts were run in, through the place where we 
took dinner, by 60 or 70 secesh cavalry. Three or four 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 29 

were wounded and our boys say that they killed several of 
the Rebels. The gunboats came up in the p. m. reported 
fighting the "Yankee" and two land batteries, one of which 
was but three and one half miles below us (and some say 
but one and one half miles) and had 16 guns. They crip- 
pled the dam'd "Yankee" although the latter carries 84/5, 
while ours hadn't but 64's. Our boats were not touched. A 
deserter came up from Columbus yesterday afternoon and 
says that our boats killed 200 in the fight. (I believe he is a 
liar and a spy). We have had it sweet the last day and two 
nights. Rained like sixty and we have no tents. There is 
no shelter but a few trees and you know they amount to 
nothing in heavy rains. It is amusing to see the boys 
figure at night for dry beds. Every thing, gates, cordwood, 
rails, cornstalks, weeds and panels of fence and boards are 
confiscated, and genius is taxed its utmost to make the 
sleeping as comfortable as possible. Milo Farewell, Hy. 
Johnson and myself sleep on an armful of cornstalks 
thrown on a floor of rails. With nothing between us and 
the clouds. Sid., (Sidney Stockdale) and Theo. each had 
three sticks of four foot cord wood for a couch, with their 
feet resting in a mudpuddle. We are further out than any 
other regiment now. I tell you I like this, and feel like 
knocking down any man that I hear grumble. None of our 
boys do that I hear of. We will have our tents here this 
p. m. though I would rather be without them ; they are so 
much trouble. I know we will have no dirtier time than 
we have had the last two days, and until it gets cold I 
would rather not have tents if it is the same all the time. 
I fell in love with Paducah while I was there, and I think 
I will settle there when the war is over. I never saw so 
many pretty women in my life. All fat, smooth-skinned 
small boned, highbred looking women. They hollered 
"Hurrah for Jeff" at us, some of them, but that's all right. 
I could write until to-morrow morning about Paducah, 
but I must go and confiscate some corn for dinner. 



3O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Norfolk, September 16, 1861. 

We are still here at Norfolk and now jn camp for we don't 
know how long. We got tents the day after the date of my last, 
and splendid ones they are. They are full 10 feet high and 15 
feet across. They each accommodate about 15 men. Since 
we have been here we have been out scouting three times. The 
first time we were down the river about five miles. That was 
the time our gunboats had the fight with. the "Yankee" and the 
land batteries. Two days afterward a body of the enemy's 
cavalry came up almost to our camp, and after dinner we were 
sent out to look them up. We were scooting along through a 
thick wood when one of our cavalry men came back half scared 
out of his wits (we had about 20 of the cavalry ahead acting 
as scouts) and .reported a whole mess of men just over a rise 
of ground ahead of us. Our company was in the van, and the 
column came into. line on us and our cavalry tried to draw the 
enemy back on our position, but Mr. Enemy "drawed" the 
other way and again t ,we missed pur little fight. Last Saturday 
.we .started out again at np.on,and went down the river 10 miles 
where we thought sure , we'd find secesh, but he had again left. 
We had 2,000 men this time and 6 pieces of artillery. We had 
stopped to rest when a cloud of dust was observed rising on 
our .side of the river about four mijes from us. Some of the 
boys had glasses with them and made out the cause to be a body 
of cavalry. Our right was marched a few hundred yards to the 
front and placed in line pf battle with the left at the river bank 
and our. right. extending along an edge of woods and fronting 
a cornfield and open pass between it and the riyer. A splendid 
place (for our side) for a fight. Our gunboat then started 
down the river, fired at and dispersed one body they saw and 
then slipped a few .shells into Columbus .and returned. We 
were within four or five miles of Columbus where there are 
(our colonel says) 26,000 troops, and on ground where the 
.secesh were encamped but lately with 16 pieces of artillery. 
We, started back at dusk and got home about 10 o'clock; some 
of the boys pretty tired. I stand these little trips like a horse 
and would rather go every day than lay around camp. Yester- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 3! 

day (Sunday) the "Yankee" came up and shelled the woods 
where we were the day before. She tried to throw some shells 
into our camp but they didn't reach us by a mile and a half. 
One of our gunboats has to lay here all the time or the "Yan- 
kee" would make us skedaddle out of this on double quick. 
Don't talk about furloughs. They are played out. A dispatch 
came this last week to Colonel Oglesby that his wife was 
dying. He went up to Cairo but General McClernand showed 
him an order from McClellan, vetoing furloughs, no matter 
for what. So the colonel had to return here. I'd like very 
much to go home but I'll enjoy it all the more when this busi- 
ness is finished. The I7th is encamped just opposite us on 
Island No. i, but we can't get to see them. Our boys are in 
good spirits. Sid. and Sam and Theo. are now all right. Milo 
Farewell thinks he has the dumb ague. Fred Norcott is sick 
in Cairo. Charley Cooper is also sick I have heard. I am all 
right. My office is sergeant, two grades below private. Our 
company goes out on picket to-night. 

September 17, 1861. 

Well, I've slept half of this day and feel sleepy yet. I had a 
toUgh time on picket last night. We were divided into four 
squads and owing to the small number of men we had out 
(only 50) the corporals had to stand guard as privates ; so I 
had all the stationing of reliefs to do myself and did not get a 
minute's sleep all night. We were ri6t troubled any by the 
enemy but the mosquitoes and fleas gave us the devil. 

A coon came sliding down the tree Sam Nutt was stationed 
under, and he thought he was taken sure. The people here say 
that there are lots of bears and tiger cats killed here every 
winter. Sam has been to Cairo to-day and says that Keef, 
Fred Norcott and Cooper are all much better. There is a ru- 
mor now that our right is going to Virginia, but I don't believe 
it. It is too good to be true. Our cook has been sick for sev- 
eral days and we have been just about half living on account of 
our being too lazy to cook. I don't mean to be disrespectful 
when I say I was about as glad to see him cooking again this

morning, as I would be to see you. He is a splendid nigger, 
seems to think the world of us boys. He buys a great many lit- 
tle things for us with his own money, which as we are all out, 
is a good institution. We are to get our pay next week the offi- 
cers say. My pay is some $18 or $20 a month now. I am en- 
titled to a straight sword now, but as I have to carry a musket 
also, I'll trade it off for gingerbread if they'll let me, and if 
they won't I'll lose it sure for I have enough to carry without 
it. I can hear the tattoo now before the colonel's quarters at 
the other end of the camp and our boys are singing, "Home 
Again" as they lie around me in our tent. I thank goodness 
that none of them get homesick like some do that I know in our 
right. I do despise these whiners. I expect (I have just this 
instant heard that they have been fighting in Washington for 
the last 24 hours. Now I'll finish the sentence I had com- 
menced) to be with those I love in eight months if the ex- 
pected battle in Washington results favorably for our country, 
if not, do not look for me for three years. If they whip us 
again there I want to fight the rest of my life if necessary, 
and die before we recognize them as anything but Rebels and 
traitors who must be humbled. I don't believe yet awhile the 
news but I kind o' feel it all through me that there is a battle 
more to be recorded and that we are the victors. All that we 
have heard is that they are fighting. Colonel Turchin's I9th 
left Cairo last night for the east somewhere. We are rapidly 
learning to appropriate and confiscate. On our last scout one 
of our boys rode a stray horse back and another came in with 
a female jackass and her child. Chickens are very scarce here 
now and the natives complain that sweet potato hills have 
turned into holes since we have been here. Our mess have 
this p. m. confiscated the roof of a man's barn to cover our 
cook house with.

The colonel talks some to-night about a forward movement, 
and two regiments have come across the river from the Ken- 
tucky side this evening, the Iowa 2d and /th. The I7th are

still opposite us and I have seen none of them yet. Our cav- 
alry scouts are fighting now more or less every day. Yesterday 
a party of the Iowa /th were out hunting bushwhackers when 
they were attacked by a company of horsemen of whom they 
killed four. One of our men was shot while returning from 
a scout. They routed the enemy but came back and reported 
four of their men missing, but the lost four have all come in 
to-day. Our men think they finished a couple at least but 'tis 
questionable. We are all again bored to death with lying still, 
but patience and we'll get what we want in time. We have the 
report here to-day that Colonel Mulligan has capitulated to 
Price, Jackson & Co. at Lexington. This, if true, will certainly 
retard our movement down the Mississippi. I'm getting per- 
fectly indifferent about Fremont's being superseded or as to 
who has the command. It seems to me that none of our com- 
manders are doing anything. With at least 75,000 troops at 
Paducah, Cairo and in Missouri to allow the gallant Mulligan 
to be forced to surrender is perfectly shameful. It's disheart- 
ening to a soldier, I tell you. Let them go on, if this war 
goes against us 'twill be the fault of our commanders and not 
of the men, sure. Yesterday information was brought our col- 
onel that a battery was in course of erection on the Kentucky 
shore six miles below us. We were put on steamboats 2,000 
or 2,500 strong and preceded by two gunboats scooted down, 
when within a mile of the place our regiment was landed and 
we marched down but of course found no battery. 

Norfolk, September 30, 1861. 

You think I'm doing pretty well in the number of my letters, 
don't you ? I can afford to for you are the only correspondent 
I have. You musn't be surprised if you don't get letters from 
me so regularly after this, for if we start back in the country, 
as I expect we will, to intercept Price's retreat if Fremont 
whips him, we may be away from mails and such like for some 
time. If anything happens to me you will hear it just as quick 
as the news can be taken to you. 



34 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Since my last we have had some more fun here. Our com- 
pany was out a few miles the other day to capture an old cuss 
we thought was peddling news from our camp down to Colum- 
bus. He had skedaddled though before we got to his house. 
We gobbled up all the loose plunder we could find lying around, 
it wasn't much, and marched back. We had a mighty good 
time on picket a few nights ago. It was confounded cold, 
bushwhackers or no bushwackers we concluded to have a fire. 
A couple of the boys volunteered to go back to camp for kettles 
and coffee, and we found lots of nice roasting ears in the field 
we were camped in, and a kind of pumpkin that ate very well 
after a little roast before the fire. Then there were splendid 
pawpaws, lots of nuts of all kinds which a little fire made ripe, 
and we sat and cooked arid ale all night. I can eat, if neces- 
sary, 36 hours without intermission except for an occasional 
drinfc, arid I drink nearly a half gallon of coffee per day. 

Last night the Pekin company in our regiment were on 
picket and at 3 this morning they were attacked. Ten of them 
held their ground against 150 half-mounted and half- foot and 
finally made them scoot. It was a devilish brave thing. The 
Rebels left one dead and one so badly wounded that he'll die 
to-night, and carried off two others dead and four badly 
wounded. A lot more were scratched. But one of our men was 
wounded, and that a flesh wound in the arm, that will hardly 
take hint off duty. The' firing roused us here in the camp and 
we thought from the noise that the longed fight had come at 
last for certain. I tell you it was funny when the long roll 
(we would not get out of bed without the long roll for a 
thousand cannons these cold nights) to see the boys scramble 
for shoes and accoutrements. There was some profanity. I 
have just been to see a poor devil that has blown half of his 
head off this afternoon to get rid of his troubles. A soldier. 
Don't know what he suicided for. We are messed off now, 
15 in a tent, each tent's inmates cooking and eating by them- 
selves.

Bird's Point, October 2, '61. 

Just at noon yesterday orders came to strike tents and in 
an hour we were under way and have come to a halt in this 
forsaken hole. It seems that the 8th can't get out of hearing 
of the Cairo morning and evening gun anyway. Our major 
says they are talking of chucking us into Cairo and making 
us garrison it this winter. I'll be tempted to desert if 'tis so. 
The 22d call us the featherbed regiment now, and if they keep 
us this way much longer we will be tender as women. It was 
late and we were tired when we pitched our tents last night 
and we didn't "ditch round" as usual, trusting to providence 
for a dry night. But 'twas confidence misplaced and some of 
the boys found the ground slightly damp under them this morn- 
ing. It has been raining like the devil all a. m. and the mud is 
quite salubrious. I find my old Havana schoolmate, Jem 
Walker, here in the 28th, Ritter's company. Haven't seen 
Smith yet. The Rebels came right up to Norfolk after we 
left last night, and about 3 I heard the cavalry called out, and 
this morning I see the 2d Iowa and nth Illinois are gone. 
Suppose they all went down that way. I have disposed of 
all my surplus baggage and now have two shirts, two pair 
socks, one blanket, one pair pants, one coat, one pair shoes, 
one hat, toothbrush and one pocket comb. That's all I'm 
worth. I can get all the clothing I want of the quartermaster 
any time. You scout the idea of one's liking such a life as 
this. I tell you that I never was so well satisfied in my life 
as I have been since I joined the army. I do really enjoy 
it all the time, and if our boys here write the truth home they 
will say the same. Nobody ever heard me grumble a word 
about soldiering and never will if they don't station us in 
Cairo. 

Bird's Point, October 10, 1861. 

I have just finished a dinner of cider, cake, bread, butter, 
etc. We have just been paid off and of course have to indulge 
in a few delicacies for awhile. Last Tuesday we were ordered 
to strike tents and pack for a march. It wasn't much of a 

3 



36 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER; 

march though for we were put on the cars and rolled out to 
Charleston, 12 miles from here, where we camped on a beau- 
tiful little prairie adjoining town. The nth Illinois, Taylor's 
artillery and two companies of cavalry and our regiment 
formed the party. I think we were out looking after that 
damned Jeff Thompson, who is reported everywhere from 
Ironton down to New Madrid. I don't believe he has a thous- 
and men, for there seems to be nothing reliable about any 
of the reports we have of him. The natives up at Charleston 
told us that Jeff was at Sykestown, 12 miles from there, with 
5,000 or 6,000 troops, and our pickets had several little fights 
with his, or what we supposed to be his, but well, the gen- 
erals may know better but we that stay in the ranks think 
that there is no enemy nearer than Columbus save a few small 
bands of bushwhackers, who, under the impression that they 
are upholding principles eternal and doing their country ser- 
vice, gobble up everything sweet or sour, that weighs less than 
a ton. We came down from Charleston Thursday. We 
marched about 10 miles of the way through an immense (it 
seemed so to me) cypress swamp. 1 think Mrs. Stowes' 
"Dred" would have enjoyed that swamp hugely. It was rather 
an interesting piece of scenery for a first view, but I don't 
think I should enjoy living in sight of it. The i8th, Colonel 
Lawler, worked six or eight weeks in this swamp repairing 
bridges the secesh had burnt, and it put half their men on 
the sick list. We got our pay in treasury notes but they are 
as good as the gold. Lots of the boys have traded them off 
for gold "even up." I get $21 this time for two months and 
five days, our other boys got $14 or $15. I am third sergeant 
now, our second having been appointed sergeant major. I 
think I should rather be sergeant, for the field officers make 
a kind of servant of the sergeant major. I send you a couple 
of daguerreotypes to let you see what a "skeleton" I have be- 
come. Our boys are all very well. The I7th is in a pretty hard 
condition, nearly half of them sick and as a regiment pretty 
badly used up. We have been paid twice and they only $10 
yet. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 37 

Bird's Point, October 18, 1861 

We yesterday drew our overcoats, and splendid ones 
they are. The cloth is light blue and they reach nearly to 
our feet. They have capes on them that come over a fel- 
low's head nicely nights. The weather is about like you 
have I expect, but I know we will be very comfortable 
with the clothing we have in any weather. I wouldn't 
have the war end before next spring for anything, for I 
want to try a winter out doors. Every one of the Canton 
boys is in excellent health and all very well satisfied. The 
boys are receiving letters almost every day that read "we 
have heard that so and so is sick," and this morning John 
Wallace got one that said that Sam Nutt and three others 
were shot while on guard. You may know that such reports 
are always lies unless you see it with the names in the 
papers long before a letter would reach you from here. John 
Wallace is just one of the best boys in the camp. It would 
do you good to see how contentedly the boys all take 
things. There is more life and fun in our tent every night 
than we ever had at home. Sam and Fred Norcott make 
more noise and sport in an evening than all Canton can 
furnish in a week. We love and respect all our officers 
but one, and he is the best officer we have, but a little too 
much regular army about him. Our captain is what the 
girls would call a "dear old fellow," though he does have his 
own way every time. It seems to be the right way always 
so we think the world of him. They are just burying some 
poor fellow. We have had several deaths in the regiment 
lately. They do not play the prettiest dead marches here. 
I have been detached from the company for a week acting 
as sheriff of a court martial. Colonel Marsh, Colonel 
Logan, Colonel Tuttle of the Iowa 2d, and a couple of 
captains form the court. I have four men a day to guard 
the prisoners and two orderlies to send errands for me, so 
I play big injun strongly. The prisoner murdered a com- 
rade while we were down at Norfolk. Smote him on the 
head with a club. He is from Company B of our regiment. 



38 , ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

That company, besides this case, had a man shot dead the 
other day by one of their own company. An accident. 
This morning they had a man stabbed, and day before 
yesterday they confined one of their men for trying to kill 
two others. For all this they are really a good company 
of men. We had a review Tuesday this week of 6 regi- 
ments, 2 batteries and 400 or 500 cavalry. Very fine. I 
suppose you saw an account of the Pekin company of our 
regiment killing four or five Rebels that made an attack 
on them while they were guarding a bridge. Ten of them 
stood their ground against a large party, and held the 
ground too. We buried two secesh and they carried off 
four. We lost none. The best fight yet was ten miles 
below here the other day between 26 of our men and 160 
Rebels. You've seen it in the papers. Sam Nutt and John 
Wallace stood guard two nights before at the place where 
the first fight was. Oh heavens, I hope I can date my 
next from somewhere else. 

Bird's Point, October 27, 1861. 

I haven't written for a full week because I really had noth- 
ing to write and in fact I have not now. Although soldiering 
is a hugely lazy life, yet these short days we seem to have but 
little spare time. We are up nearly an hour before sun up, have 
breakfast about sunrise, drill (company) from about 8 to 10. 
Cards until dinner time, 12 ; lounge or read until 2 ; battalion 
drill untill 4 130 or 5, supper, and then dress parade at 4 '.45 ; 
from candle lighting untill bedtime (taps), 10, we have cards 
mixed with singing or some awful noises from Sam Nutt and 
Fred Norcott. Those two boys can make more noise than 
three threshing machines. Our boys are all in excellent 
health and prime spirits. Fred and Sam and Sid are fatter 
than the Canton folk ever saw them. There are but four 
regiments at the Point now, so we have to work on the en- 
trenchments every fourth day two hours or cut down trees 
the same length of time. We are clearing away the timber 
within 500 yards of the earthworks. It is mostly cottonwood 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 39 

and very heavy. They stand so thick that if we notch a dozen 
or so pretty deep and then fell one it will knock three or four 
down. Lin Coldwell and I are going to get a set of chess 
to-morrow. That gunboat, "New Era," that the papers blow 
so much about is of no account as a gunboat. She is laid up 
at Mound City for a battery. The men on her have told me 
that she wouldn't half stand before a land battery that 
amounted to anything. We are beginning to have some frost 
here, but I don't believe we'd suffer a bit lying in these tents 
all winter. The sickly season is over now and the health is 
improving very much. We had 18 on the sick list in our 
company three weeks ago and now we have but three, and 
they are only diarrhoea or the like. I tell you I feel as strong 
as two mules and am improving. I haven't been the least 
unwell yet. Our boys are perfectly sick for a fight so they 
can be even with the i/th. We are sure that the I7th doesn't 
deserve to be named the same day with us for drill or dis- 
cipline, with all their 'bragging. They are an awful set of 
blowhards. Sid., Theo., Ben Rockhold and John Wallace are 
on picket out of our mess to-night. The picket was fired on 
last night where they are posted to-night. 

Cape Girardeau, November n, 1861. 

We have just arrived here after a week's absence from any 
sign of civilized life. Saturday the 2d we (our company) 
went out six or seven miles from the Point to guard a bridge 
on the Cairo and Fulton Railroad. Sunday we came back to 
the Point, and found the tents of our regiment all struck and 
everything prepared for a march. By dark we were all safely 
stowed on the "Aleck Scott," and also five companies of the 
nth Illinois. At 10 p. m. the boat shoved out, but had to tie 
to all night about 10 miles up the river on account of the 
fog. Monday at 10 a. m. we landed at Commerce between 
Cape Girardeau and Cairo and stayed there all night. Up to 
this time we had not the most distant idea of where we were 
going, but here we began to guess that we were after Jeff 
Thompson and company. Tuesday morning we started back 
into the country and camped for the night on Colonel Hun- 
ter's farm, a distance of 18 miles. (I forgot to mention that 



40 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

the 1 8th and 22d Illinois with three companies, cavalry and 
two pieces artillery joined us before we started from Com- 
merce, making a total of some 2,200 men.) This Colonel 
Hunter is in the Rebel Army When we stopped at his farm 
there was a large flock of sheep, at least 40 goats and pigs, 
turkey, geese, chickens and ducks without number. After we 
had been there a half hour I don't believe there was a living 
thing on the farm that did not come with our train. I never 
saw a slaughterhouse on as large a scale before. The 
next day the boys made an awful uproar on the road, playing 
that the sheep, hogs, geese, etc., inside of them were calling 
for their comrades. Wednesday night we stopped at Little 
Water River and the slaughtering commenced immediately. 
All along the road up to this place every horse or mule that 
showed himself was gobbled instanter, a bridle cramped, and 
some footman made happy. It was hard to tell whether our 
force was infantry or cavalry that night. This was too much 
for the colonel, so next morning he drew the brigade up in 
column of company and gave us fits. He made the men turn 
every horse loose; told us that the next man that cramped 
anything without permission would be dealt with as severely 
as the regulations would allow. That suited me. I never 
have been disgusted with soldiering save in those two days, and 
I tell you that I did then feel like deserting. When we are 
marching through a country as thoroughly secesh as this is, 
I think that the men should be allowed fresh meat at the ex- 
pense of the natives ; but there is a proper and soldier-like way 
to get it. We can send our foraging party ahead and have 
all we want at camp when we halt, but to allow men to 
butcher everything they see is moblike. Wednesday night 
Jeff's men tried to burn a bridge a short distance from us 
and this led to a little brush, but the cavalry only were en- 
gaged. Thursday we marched all day and went into camp 
at night without seeing a horse. The march was through the 
"Black Swamp." The ground was covered with this black 
moss four inches deep and so thick that 'tis like a carpet. 
That was an awful gloomy road and I was glad enough to

land at a nice clear stream and have orders -to pitch tents. 
That night not a thing was pressed. The next day we got into 
Bloomfield about 9 a. m. and found Jeff gone. For the third 
time we pitched tents on one of his deserted camps. I have 
just now heard that we started with orders to push on down 
to New Madrid, but here the orders were countermanded and 
we were started to Cape Girardeau. This Bloomfield is a rank 
Rebel hole. The first Rebel company in Missouri was raised 
here. It is the county seat 'of Stoddard or Scott, and a very 
fine place. Here the boys got the understanding that we were 
to be allowed some liberties and take them they did. They 
broke open four or five stores whose owners had left, and helped 
themselves. Colonel Dick (Oglesby) thought this was going too 
far, so he stopped it and sent a police force around to collect the 
stolen (pressed rather) property. I walked around and took 
a look at the pile they collected. There were lots of women's 
bonnets, girl's hats, mallets, jars of medicine, looking glasses 
three feet long, boys' boots, flat irons, a nice side table and 
I don't know what wasn't there. It beat anything I ever saw. 
The men had no way to carry these things but on their backs, 
and what the devil they stole them for is more than I know. 
Well, the colonel divided the stuff out again among the men, 
but stopped stealing entirely for the future. We have been a 
respectable regiment since then. On the march back to the 
Cape, the loth Iowa was ahead of us and they fired several 
houses. We (our regiment) saved one of the houses but the 
rest burned down. The march back to the Cape was a fast 
one but quiet. We arrested some 20 or 30 of Jeff's men but 
released them all again. At Bloomfield my tent was pitched 
under a tree on which we saw the marks of three ropes to the 
ends of which Colonel Lowe attached three men not very long 
since. The ropes had cut through the moss on the tree and 
the marks will be visible a long time. We also arrested a 
number of men that had been concerned in hanging Union 
men through the country, At Round Pond an intelligent man 
told us that 17 men (Union) had been hung and shot inside 
of three days and he saw their bodies in one pile lying in the 



42 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

woods. We have marched over 100 miles this trip, and we 
have not seen a mile of prairie. I haven't been 20 feet from 
a tree for three months. The I7th are going into winter 
quarters here. Our regiment will certainly be in the next fight 
at Columbus. We start back to the Point at 3 to-morrow 
morning. 

Bird's Point, November 13, 1861. 

Home once more. We all call this home now. Just 
as we landed last night the Iowa 7th was forming for 
dress parade. One company had but n and another but 
15 men; all that came out of the Belmont fight safely. 
Other companies had half and some three-fourths of their 
men they started with. General Grant tries to make out 
that there were about 150 or 175 men lost on our side, but 
I'll stake my life that we lost not less than 500. I am 
sure that the 22d Illinois lost not less than 175, the 7th 
Iowa at least 200, and the other three regiments 150 more. 
Grant says that he achieved a victory and accomplished 
the object of his expedition. It may be so (the latter part 
of it) but almost every one here doubts the story. He says 
his object was to threaten Columbus, to keep them from 
sending reinforcements to Price. Well he has threatened 
them, had a fight, and why they can't send reinforcements 
now as well as before, is more than I know. I never will 
believe that it was necessary to sacrifice two as good 
regiments as there were in the West, to accomplish all 
that I can see has been done this time. Altogether there 
were some 6,000 men from here, Cape Girardeau and 
Ironton, on the expedition that our regiment was on 
marching by different roads. Grant says now that we 
were all after Jeff Thompson. I don't believe it. I think 
the Paducah forces were to take Columbus, Grant was 
going to swallow Belmont, we were to drive all the guer- 
rillas before us to New Madrid, and then with Paducah 
forces and Grant's we were to take Madrid and probably 
go on to Memphis or maybe join Fremont with our Army 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 43 

of say 15,000 men. Well, Grant got whipped at Belmont, 
and that scared him so that he countermanded all our 
orders and took all the troops back to their old stations 
by forced marches. There was some very good fighting 
done at Belmont by both sides. The 22d Illinois and 7th 
Iowa did about all the fighting, and sustained much the 
heaviest loss. The boys are not the least discouraged and 
they all want to go back and try it again. The whole camp 
has the Columbus fever, and I don't believe there are 
20 men that would take a furlough if they thought an 
advance would be made on Columbus while they were 
absent. The enemy there are very well fed, clothed and 
armed. Arkansas and Tennessee troops with some Mis- 
sissippians. The retreat was a route, for our men were 
scattered everywhere. I don't care what the papers say, 
the men that were in it say that every man took care of 
himself, and hardly two men of a regiment were together. 
The men ran because they were scattered and saw that the 
force against them was overwhelming, but the universal 
testimony is that there was no panic, nine out of ten of the 
men came on the boats laughing and joking. They had 
been fighting six or seven hours, and cannon and musketry 
couldn't scare them any more.' There are hundreds of 
stories, and good ones, out but I always spoil them by 
trying to put them on paper. 

Bird's Point, November 20, 1861 

Part of Pitt's (Col. W. Pitt Kellogg's) cavalry are here. 
We are glad to see them as it will relieve us of considerable 
picket duty. But otherwise cavalry are of not much 
service in this brushy, swampy country. That fox of a 
Jeff Thompson that we chased down to New Madrid last 
week, had the impudence to follow us right back and we 
had hardly got our tents pitched here at the Point before 
he passed within 12 miles of us to the river above, and 
captured a steamboat. Report says that there were nearly 
a dozen officers on the boat, and a paymaster, with money 



44 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

to pay off the Cape Girardeau troops. Jeff is a shrewd one, 
and the man that captures him will do a big thing. Back 
in the country where we were, he made the natives believe 
that he whipped Ross and company at Fredericktown, and 
killed 400 federals with a loss of only ten of his men. 
Don't it almost make you sick the way that i/th brag 
and blow about themselves? That affair at Fredericktown 
didn't amount to a thing. From the best information I 
can get, there was not to exceed 50 Rebels killed, and I'm 
sure not that many. Thompson is stronger to-day than 
ever. This thing of sending infantry after him is all bosh, 
although we tried it again yesterday. It failed of course. 
The boys came back through the rain last night about 10, 
tired and mad as the deuce. A thousand cavalry may 
possibly get him some day, but they will be sharp ones, 
sure. In this fight at Belmont 1,200 of our men at first 
completely whipped 2,400 of theirs, four regiments, then 
the whole of ours, 2,600 ran like the devil before and 
through 5,600 of theirs. These are the true figures. 

Bird's Point, Mo., November 24, 1861. 

Sabbath morning, 10 o'clock. 

I'm in clover. I've got a great big "comfort," weighs a ton, 
that has been sent to my partner and myself from a young 
lady in Bloomington. We've tramped so much since I re- 
ceived that pair of blankets from you, and we never know 
when we start whether we're coming back here again or no, 
that being unable to carry them I sold them. We have had 
considerable cold weather. Lots of frost, and for the last 
two days it has been freezing all the time. We have always 
slept perfectly warm and getting used to it by degrees. 

I never hear anyone complain. Yesterday we made a furn- 
ace in our tent that works admirably and now I wouldn't give 
a snap for any other winter quarters. This furnace is a grand 
thing. It keeps our tent dry and healthy and is as comfortable 
to me now as ever our house was. Don't trouble yourself in 
the least about our underclothing. We all have more than 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 45 

we want and can get any quantity at any time. Other cloth- 
ing the same. We commenced building log houses for win- 
ter quarters this morning. Theo Thornton and Clem Wallace 
of our mess are up the river now cutting logs for them. We 
never drill Sundays, but for anything else we have no Sunday. 
We have no chaplain in our regiment. Our captain is reli- 
gious but he is out now doing as much work as any of the 
men. We can enjoy ourselves very well here this winter, but 
of course we are very much disappointed in not getting into 
active service. I think that when our gunboats get here we 
will at least be allowed a trial on Columbus, but you know, 
and I know, that I don't know anything about it. We have 
had two awful rains within a week as the ponds covered with 
ice on our parade ground will testify. The first one caught 
six of our boys fifteen miles up the river cutting logs for our 
huts. It wet them beautifully. In camp for some reason they had 
doubled the pickets, strengthened the camp guard and ordered 
us to sleep on our arms. I think they were troubled with the 
old scare again. About 10:30 while the storm was at its 
height heavy firing commenced all at once right in the mid- 
dle of the camp. What a time there was. Colonel Oglesby got 
his signals ready, regiments formed in the rain and the devil 
was to pay generally. It turned out that it was a green Iowa 
regiment that had just returned from another unsuccessful 
chase after Jeff. 'Twas an awful trick and only the greenest 
troops would have done it. 

Bird's Point, Mo., December i, 1861. 

This, the beginning of winter, is the warmest and altogether 
the most pleasant day we have had for several weeks. During 
our whole trip to Bloomfield and back we had splendid 
weather, but ever since our return it has been at least very 
unsplendid. The climax was reached day before yesterday 
and capped with several inches of snow. I was up the river 
15 miles at the time with a party loading a flatboat with logs 
for our huts. We had a sweet time of it and lots of fun. The 
mud was from six inches to a foot deep, and by the time we 
got the logs to the boat they were coated with mud two in- 



46 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

ches thick, and before we got a dozen logs on the boat we 
had a second coat on us, from top to toe of mud. It snowed 
and rained all the time we worked but I heard no complaint 
from the men, and in fact I have never seen so much fun any- 
where as we had that day. There is any amount of game 
where we were, the boys said that were out, and they brought 
to camp several skinned "deer." I tried some of the "veni- 
son" but it tasted strangely like hog. 

Of course drill is discontinued for the present, and as work- 
ing on the quarters is almost impossible we sit and lie in the 
tent and gas and joke and eat and plan devilment. We have 
a barrel of apples now, lots of pecans and tobacco and not a 
thing to trouble us. The enemy have quit coming around 
here and we can stroll six or seven miles without danger if 
we get past our pickets safely. There was a great deal of 
firing down at Columbus yesterday and I heard some more 
this morning. I don't know whether the gunboats are down 
or not. It may be the Rebels are practicing with their big 
guns; or maybe they are firing a salute over the fall of Fort 
Pickens. It will be a great joke if they take that, won't it? 
I believe myself that they will take it. Two of our new gunboats 
came down day before yesterday. We will have in all 12 gun- 
boats, 40 flatboats carrying one mortar each and 15 propel- 
lers for towing purposes, besides the steamboats for trans- 
porting troops. Makes quite a fleet and will fill the river be- 
tween here and Columbus nearly full. There are not very 
many troops here now. Only five regiments of cavalry and 
four or five batteries of artillery. Not over 12,000 in all. We 
have nearly 1,000 sailors and marines here now and they are 
such cusses that they have to keep them on a steamboat an- 
chored out in the river. We see by the papers this morning 
that the fleet has captured another sand bar. A good one on 
the bar. We are greatly puzzled to know if we really are 
going down the river this winter. We are preparing winter 
quarters here for only 12,000 men. Now all these troops they 
are running into St. Louis cannot be intended for up the 
Missouri river, for the troops are also returning from there. 
I don't believe either that they intend to keep them in St. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 47 

Louis this winter for they have only quarters provided there 
for a garrison force, so I guess it must mean down the river, 
but am sure they won't be ready before six weeks or two 
months. We have a report here that Governor Yates is rais- 
ing 60 day men to garrison these points while we "regulars" 
will be pushed forward. Jem Smith is down here trying to 
get information of his brother Frank who is a prisoner. There 
are a good many Rebels deserting now. Our pickets bring 
them into camp. They are mostly Northern men who pre- 
tend they were pressed in and are glad to escape. Frank 
Smith is in Company A, Captain Smith's company, at Pa- 
ducah. It was Company B, Captain Taylor's, that was in 
the Belmont fight. You could see just as well as not why I 
can't come home if you'll take the trouble to read General 
Halleck's General Order No. 5 or 6, that says, "Hereafter 
no furloughs will be granted to enlisted men," etc. 

We had a first rate lot of good things from Peoria yester- 
day. They were sent us for Thanksgiving but were a day late. 
Chickens, cranberries, cake, etc. The boys say that a Rebel 
gunboat has just showed his nose around the point and Fort 
Holt is firing away pretty heavily, but I guess the boat is all 
in some chap's eye. Hollins is down at Columbus with about 
a dozen vessels of war. I have just been out to see what the 
boys said was the pickets coming in on the run, but some say 
its only a gunboat coming up through woods, so I guess I'll 
not report a prospect of a fight. 

Monday, December 2, 1861. 

While I was writing last night there really was a Rebel 
gunboat came up the river and fired into Fort Holt. Impu- 
dent, wasn't it? The Fort replied, and Fort Cairo also shot 
a couple of shells over our heads toward the rascals, but they 
fell short. We could see the troops at Fort Holt out under 
arms for an hour. Taylor's battery went off down the Nor- 
folk road at a slashing pace to try and get a shot at the boat 
but was too late. 

It is very cold this morning and snowing again. We are 
perfectly comfortable, though.

Bird's Point, Mo., December n, 1861. 

Our cavalry brought in 16 prisoners to-night, about 10 last 
night ; a band of Thompson's men took a couple of boys from 
our regiment prisoners, out 10 miles from here at the water 
tank on the railroad. The owner of the house happened to 
be outside when they surrounded the house and he scooted 
down here with the news, and by 2 o'clock we had a lot of 
cavalry and infantry en route for the scene of action. The 
cavalry started them out of the brush and captured this 16. 
The Rebels killed one of Colonel Oglesby's men. They did not 
recover our men but started up and lost another gang that 
probably has them. 

We will be in our quarters next week although we don't 
need them. It is rather pleasant here now. I took a swim 
yesterday. 'Twas confounded cold, but I wanted to bathe so 
I took the river for it. We haven't had a man complaining in 
the company for a week. We buried one poor fellow last 
week, but he would have died at home. When I was home 
last I weighed 142, now I weigh 160. Can you imagine me. 

Bird's Point, Mo., December 22, 1861. 

This is a dark, dismal, snowy and confoundedly disagree- 
able Sunday. Cold, sloppy and nasty! We moved into our 
cabin last night but it is not finished yet, as a crack along the 
comb of the roof and sundry other airholes abundantly testify. 
The half snow half rain comes in when and where it pleases, 
and renders our mud floor comfortable in about the 4Oth 
degree. Don't this sound like grumbling, Well, I don't mean 
it as such, for I am sure the boys are as cheery as I ever saw 
them, and I wouldn't think of these little things except when 
writing home, and then the contrast between its cozy comforts 
and soldiering in cold, wet weather makes itself so disagree- 
ably conspicuous to my spiritual eyes that I can't pass it un- 
noticed. Love Hamblin came over here last night and is now 
standing by the fireplace indulging in an ague shake, which 
if not pleasant is not to my eyes ungraceful. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 49 

No more troops have arrived here, and save the whole gun- 
boat fleet being here there are no new signs of the down-river 
trip we are all waiting so impatiently for. 

Bird's Point, December 29, 1861. 

Your letter giving us notice of your sending a box came to 
hand yesterday with express charges inclosed. I shall go 
over to Cairo to-morrow to get them if they are there. I 
haven't been to Cairo for a month. All of the 7th cavalry are 
on this side now and there are about a dozen of them here all the 
time. Colonel Kellogg will be here next week. One company in 
that regiment did the first scouting for the 7th this morning. 
They rode out southwest about 15 miles and brought in 22 
prisoners. Tis said there are two or three officers among them, 
but I rather think they are only a lot of swamp farmers. The 
boys got only three or four guns it is said, and that is not more 
than the complement of one woodsman in this country. The 
boys think they have almost taken Columbus. It was not our 
Canton company. We are at last established in our quarters 
and thoroughly "fixed up" with all the modern improvements 
in the housekeeping line, coupled with the luxuries of the an- 
cients and the gorgeous splendor and voluptuousness of the 
middle ages. We have a chimney whose base is rock, the age 
of which man cannot tell, whose towering top is constructed 
of costly pecan wood boughs embalmed in soft Missouri mud 
cement. We have a roof and floor, beds and door, of material 
carved or sawed from the lofty pines of Superior's rock-bound 
shores. Our door latch is artfully contrived from the classic 
cypress, and curiously works by aid of a string pendant on the 
outside, and when our string is drawn inside who can enter? 
We have tables and chairs and shelves without number and 
a mantle piece, and, crowning glories, we have good big straw 
sacks, a bootjack and a dutch oven. Government has also 
furnished a stove for each mess of 15 in our regiment, so we 
have nothing more to ask for; not a thing. This is just no 
soldiering at all. Its hard, but its true that we can't find a 
thing to pick trouble out of. We are to-day more comfortable 



5O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

than 45 out of 50 people in old Canton. Our building is 
warmer than our house at home, our food is brought to us 
every third day in such abundance that we can trade off 
enough surplus to keep us in potatoes, and often other com- 
forts and luxuries. Within 500 yards of us there is wood 
enough for 10,000 for 20 years, and I can't half do it jus- 
tice, so I'll quit. I borrowed a horse of the cavalry, Christmas, 
slipped past our picket through to the brush and had a long 
ride all over the country around Charleston. No adventures 
though. General Paine took command here to-day. He is an 
old grannie. We are glad he is here though, for we will get 
our colonel back by it. You can't imagine what a change the 
last month of cool weather has produced in our troops. From 
a sick list six weeks ago of nearly 300 in our regiment, with 
65 in the hospital, we have come down or up rather, to eight 
in hospital, and not over 25 or 30 on the "sick in quarters" 
list. It is astonishing! And here these "damphool" "For- 
ward to Richmond" papers are talking about the fearful deci- 
mation that winter will make in our ranks. They "don't know 
nothing" about soldiering. 

January 2, 1862. 

We've waited patiently until after New Year for the box 
of provisions, and nary box yet. Have given it up for a goner. 
We're just as much obliged to you as though we had received 
it. We haven't yet eaten all the tomatoes, etc., that came with 
the quilts. Partly because we are too lazy to cook them, but 
mostly because we don't hanker arter them. Beans, bacon 
and potatoes are our special hobbies or favorites rather, and 
we are never dissatisfied on our inner man's account when we 
have them in abundance and of good quality. Company H 
of the 1 7th, Captain Boyd, was down here on the 3Oth. All 
the boys save Chancy Black and Billy Stockdale were along. 
We had a grand time, Nelson's, Boyd's and our boys being 
together for the first time in the war. Yesterday, New Year, 
the camp enjoyed a general frolic. A hundred or two cav- 
alry boys dressed themselves to represent Thompson's men 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 5! 

and went galloping around camp scattering the footmen and 
making noise enough to be heard in Columbus. The officers 
of the nth Infantry were out making New Year calls in an 
army wagon with 30 horses to it, preceded by a splendid band. 
The "boys" got a burlesque on the "ossifers." They hitched 
20 mules to a wagon and filled it with a tin pan and stovepipe 
band, and then followed it in 6o-mule wagon around the camp 
and serenaded all the headquarters. 

General Paine said to-day that our regiment and the nth 
would move in a week ; but I don't believe it. 

Bird's Point, January 5, 1862. 

We received the box of provisions to-day in very good 
order considering the length of time they have been knocked 
about on the route. It came by freight by some mistake or 
other. The doughnuts were the only articles spoiled. They 
had moulded. I sent the box over from Cairo but was not 
here when it was opened, so that aside from one cake labeled 
from Aunt Nancy, I don't know where a thing comes from. 
I did recognize your home snaps, too, and thought there was 
something very familiar in the taste of a mince pie that I ate, 
but I am too badly used up to-night to be sure of anything, 
and tell you as I want to how much we are obliged to our 
good mothers for their thoughtful care for us. I believe every 
boy in our mess has received socks and mittens from home. 
One received them by mail from his mother in New York 
City. At 7 this morning I went over to Cairo with 50 men 
after forage for our teams. We stood around in the cold, 
mud and rain for five hours before we got to work, and then 
the men had all run off but 15 or 18 and we had to roll 
bales of hay over a way almost impracticable and all told, 
it was a mean job and used me up very near totally. 

Ame Babcock, Ike McBean, English and Leary have been 
to see us nearly every day for a week. Colonel Kellogg took 
supper with us last night. The gunboats were hammering 
away all day yesterday down the river, and after dinner the 
general sent our company with four others from our regiment 



52 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

and nearly all of the ith, with one day's rations, down the 
river. We waded about six miles through the mud down the 
creek and then came back without knowing what we went for. 
There are none of us that are sick, but we don't feel as well 
as we did in tents. I wish we hadn't built these cabins. 

Holly Springs, Miss., January 7, 1862. 
The colonel and I were ordered to report here to give evi- 
dence before the "Court of Inquiry," convened to inquire into 
the case of the lOQth Illinois Infantry reported for disloyalty. 
I started from Jackson yesterday but had to lay over at Grand 
Junction last night waiting for a train. We got here this 
p. m., immediately gave our evidence, and will return to-mor- 
row. Don't know that they will do anything with the iO9th, 
but am satisfied that to prevent its dishonoring our state it 
should be broken up. I heard General Grant say that if the 
charges were sustained he would transfer the loyal men to 
some of the old regiments, cashier the officers and make the 
disloyal men work their time out at Alton. Am staying to- 
night at Mr. Barney's. He is a Northern man and thank 
God, a loyal one. He built a portion of the M. & C. R. R. 
and most of the M. C. R. R.. His wife is also Northern and 
loyal. Have been very wealthy, but the war has reduced them. 
They both, after seven years in the South, bear me out in the 
opinion I expressed in my last, of these Southern people. 
They have lost $50,000 worth of negroes by our army, but are 
willing to lose the rest for our cause. The army has all 
moved back to the M. & C .R. R. line except one division, 
Lanman's, which occupies this place. General Grant's 
headquarters are yet here. There is the d st state of af- 
fairs in this country now that 'tis possible to think of. Every 
house within ten miles of the army is visited about five times 
a day by our soldiers, and the guerrillas (both work on the 
same principles) and each time visitors divide with the family 
the provisions and household goods. There is ny>re stealing 
in one day here than the whole United States suffered in a 
year before the war. The correspondent of the St. Louis 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 53 

Democrat is writing on the same table with me for his paper, 
ever and anon ripping out some tall oaths because he was not 
at the Vicksburg battle. We heard last night, direct, that 
the place was taken, but we are not sure of it yet. We have 
lost immensely at that place but the gain is worth it. Trains 
are coming through from Memphis now and the army will 
be on full rations again shortly. The M. & O. R. R. will 
not be running for ten days yet. There are some eight miles 
of the latter road almost totally destroyed above Trenton, 
much of it trestle work. The sick will all leave here to-night 
and within five days this secesh hole (what there is left of it) 
will be left to its secesh inhabitants. 

Bird's Point, January 10, 1862. 

Since daylight yesterday morning we have been all ready 
with five days' rations and expecting every moment the orders 
to fall in and commence a march. We were delayed untill II 
a. m. to-day by a fog so dense that boats could not run even 
from Cairo to this point. All that time we were in the great- 
est suspense and after everybody had conjectured all their 
conjectures, we were yet perfectly in the dark in regard to our 
destination. All the troops here, save enough for guard duty, 
are going. I believe I'm within bounds when I say that 
75,000 different lies have been circulated here in the last 36 
hours, and all in regard to the present expedition. Well the 
suspense is over and we (think we) know that Columbus is 
our goal. 

At ii a. m. to-day the fog was dispersed by a cold north 
wind, and immediately two gunboats steamed down the river, 
giving us the first intimation of our route. They were shortly 
followed by other gunboats and then by steamers loaded to 
their utmost capacity with soldiers. All afternoon they have 
been going down. The last boat that I saw was towing a 
couple of flats loaded with ambulances, or "soldier-buggies." I 
think all the troops have gone from Cairo and the boats that 
carried them will be back and take us at daylight to-morrow 



54 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

noon. I think they are landing them about six miles this side 
of Columbus, maybe not so far from there. General McClern- 
and is taking his whole stock in the soldier business with him. 
It's a permanent thing certain. If this really means Columbus, 
and I don't see how it can be anything else, it has been man- 
aged with more secrecy than any expedition, besides, up to 
this time in war. I never guessed it within the possibilities 
of a month. These generals, we have three of them here 
(Grant, Paine and McClernand) may know their business, 
but we of the ranks don't understand what kind of truck 
20,000 men want with the army at Columbus. And 10,000 is, 
I'm sure, considerably outside of the number that will move 
from here. There are probably 10,000 more at Paducah, that 
I think are also going. Well, maybe we'll get the place, hope 
we will. If we don't it won't be the men's fault, for we do 
hate that hole. It's funny what an effect this soldiering has 
on men. I suppose there is no mistake about our being within 
two days, at farthest, of a great battle, and yet these men 
don't to any eye show a sign of even a shadow of care or con- 
cern. Since I commenced this I don't believe that one of them 
has given it a thought. To save my neck I can't get up 
enough excitement to kill a flea or even to warn him. The 
boys are almost all playing cards. Sam Nutt and my chum 
Hy thought they didn't get enough supper to-night, so they 
put about a peck of beans in to boil and have just got them 
in eating order. I suppose Sam can plant more beans than any 
other living man of his weight. They have also a lot of pig's 
feet between them. Little Ame Babcock and Ike McBean are 
going with us to-morrow. Colonel Kellogg goes with five 
companies of his regiment. The Canton company does not 
go. I am not real well now but I wouldn't miss this trip to 
Columbus to save my life. I've had my heart set on being at 
that fight a long time and I'm gong if I can walk two miles. 

January 13, '62. I wrote this letter and thought I wouldn't 
send it untill we'd start and save myself a chance of being 
fooled, but now I'll send it to show how badly I was misled. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 55 

Bird's Point, Mo., January 13, 1862. 

After all the excitement and promise we have had of a trip 
into Dixie, we are still here in our cabins, with the prospect 
of a move further off than ever. The 25,000 troops that are 
"on their way from St. Louis to Cairo" must have went up in 
a fog. General Grant must have credit for fooling everybody 
from the reporters up. He did it beautifully. We all here 
at this point kept our wagons loaded for two days with five 
days' rations, expecting to start every hour. The troops have 
all left Cairo and gone down opposite Norfolk (where we 
were a month) and camped. It is cold as the devil, and they 
must suffer a good deal as none of them have ever been out of 
Cairo before, and hardly know what rough soldiering is. 
Charley Cooper's company is with them. I believe that the 
whole object of the expedish is to keep the Columbians from 
sending reinforcements to the Bowling Green folks._ The dis- 
patches about the 25,000 forward movement, etc., all work to 
the same end. Some "damb'd" hounds shot four of our 7th 
cavalry boys dead a couple of mornings since. It was regu- 
lar murder. They were on picket and in the evening they 
went out some seven miles from camp and got their supper 
and engaged breakfast in the morning. Just before daylight 
they started out for breakfast and when within two miles of 
the place three men that were concealed behind a log by the 
roadside shot them all dead. Their horses wheeled and 
trotted back to the infantry picket. The infantry sent word to 
camp and some cavalry went out and found them all dead. 
They could find tracks of but three men, and it is supposed that 
they ran as quick as they fired, for our boys' bodies were not 
touched. They were only armed with sabers and the /th re- 
fuse to go on any more picket duty untill they are better 
armed. One of the murdered was Dan Lare, a boy that was 
in Canton a good while, though I believe he did not belong 
to Nelson's company. The others lived near Bushnell, their 
names I do not know. We have the chap they took supper 
with. The boys all think him guilty and have tried to get him 
away from the guard to kill him, but unsuccessfully so far. 



56 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Last night Nelson's company went up to old Bird's and 
brought him, his three sons and five other men and all Bird's 
buck niggers down to camp as prisoners. They also got 10 
good guns. His (Bird's) house is four miles from camp. 
Some of the boys noticed a long ladder leaning against the 
house and one of them climbed it and got on the housetop. 
There he found a splendid ship spy glass with which he could 
count the tents and see every move in both our camp and 
Cairo and Fort Holt. Old Bird is a perfect old pirate and a 
greater does not live. 

Bird's Point, Mo., January 20, 1862. 

It goes confounded good once more to stand on boards, 
and be able to sit down without wet coming through a 
fellow's pants. If I write and tell you where we've been, 
you won't read it, and if I don't write all about it you'll 
scold, so of the two I'll choose the first and tell you all I 
know. We got on the steamer "Aleck Scott" last Tues- 
day morning with five days' rations and started down 
the river through very heavy floating ice. 'Twas a very 
cold day and full three inches of snow lay on the ground. 
We landed at Fort Jefferson and camped for the night. By 
some mismanagement our tents and equipage failed to 
come and we had to cook the bacon we had in our haver- 
sacks on sticks over the fire, for supper, and sleep out on 
the snow, without tents to protect us from the wind. That 
was a sweet old night! Next day we shouldered our 
knapsacks, blankets all wet by a rain from 2 to 5 in the 
morning, and awful heavy, and tramped about ten miles 
in a southeast direction, through Blanville, Ballard 
County ; and camped on Mayville Creek. Again we lay 
on the snow and frozen ground with feather beds of brush, 
and at 9 next morning started on the road to Columbus. 
We went out to Little Meadows which is about eight or nine 
miles from Columbus, and halted. Taylor's battery was 
with us and they now unlimbered and planted their guns 
to cover all of the four or five roads which lead from here 
to the river. McClernand's brigade of six or seven regi- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 57 

ments, and Cook's of two regiments, were in advance of 
us with 1,000 cavalry, and I think that we acted here as a 
reserve, for them to fall back on if repulsed in a fight. 
We waited here two hours and then formed again and 
returned to our camp of the previous night. It had turned 
warm by this time and the slush was six inches deep on 
our backward march. Slept in the mud that night and 
remained in camp all next day, during which it rained 
every hour. Friday night it rained in a small way all the 
time, and in the morning, (if you remember when you have 
too many clothes in a tub of water how the water will 
"slosh" when you press the clothes) you'll understand 
my "condish." I had my blanket spread on some stiff 
brush, and Mr. Aqua surrounded brush, and every time 
Wills turned, brush would bend and water would slosh 
and blanket would leak and upshot was, Wills was damb'd 
wet, but too spunky to get up until he'd had his nap. 
Saturday we got out of "provish," and at I p. m. we struck 
tents, and thought we were off for home sure. But 
we only marched back a few miles and camped at Elliott's 
Mills. Here, by orders from the colonel, we killed two 
hogs for the company, and he took what cornmeal we 
wanted from the mill, and we supped sumptuously. Here 
although the mud was deep we slept finely. There was a 
cypress swamp near and the bark can be torn into the 
finest shavings. That was just as good as we wanted. 
Sunday we started for the river and of all the marches, 
that beats! We waded through at least eight streams 
from one to two feet deep and five to ten yards wide. 
I had shoes, and after wading the first stream, I cut all 
the front upper off to let the water out handier. I made 
it gay and festive after that. Object of expedish, don't 
know, don't care, only know that it did me good. I feel 
100 per cent better than I did when I started. Col. Pitt 
Kellogg has brought me my commission as 1st lieutenant 
in his regiment, and I am adjutant in the 3d batallion, 
Major Rawalts. I go to Cape Girardeau the last of this 
week.

Headquarters, 36 Battalion, /th Illinois Cavalry, 

February 3, 1862. 

I am pretty sure that we will start on a scout to-morrow 
that will give us a ride of 150 miles. From the knowledge I 
have of it believe that we are going to raise the devil before we 
get back or get raised ourselves. There are only about 300 of us 
going, but we are all cavalry and are going fast, will make 
our mark and then return probably at the same gait. We are 
going pretty close to New Madrid, into a hot place, where a 
long stay would not be pleasant. I believe there are 300 or 
400 men about 70 miles from here guarding commissary 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 59 

stores. We are going to try and surprise them and destroy 
the goods, kill what we can of the secesh "and get out o' that." 
It will be my first scout horseback but I'm going if it busts me. 
This is one of Colonel Kellogg's ideas and looks more like work 
than anything I have tried yet. It's awful rough weather to 
start out in but that makes it more favorable for us. Well, I 
have got over the hardest part of soldiering, though I doubt if I 
enjoy myself as well as I did in the ranks. I never in my 
life spent nine months more pleasantly than those I passed in 
the "8th." We had some rough times, but good health and good 
company made them as pleasant as and often happier than 
life in quarters. I disliked very much to leave the boys I had 
been with so long and knew so well, but cupidity and ambition 
got the better of the just resolves I made never to leave them 
untill the war was over. John Wallace, Fred Norcott and my 
chum, Hy Johnson, I did hate to leave. They'll get along just 
as well though after they have forgotten us. My chances for 
a lieutenancy in that company were first rate but I have got 
a better thing, and without so much walking. You never saw 
a gladder boy than Sam was when he found himself safe out 
of the infantry. He couldn't begin to hold his body. I sup- 
pose he and Keefer are having very gay times all by them- 
selves. Sidney and I concluded that our best policy was to 
stay here and I'm glad I did so, although I would have liked 
a visit home more than I can tell. If we can manage it so as 
to get off together some time this spring we will do so, but I 
have little hopes now of seeing you untill the war is over. The 
major (Rawalt), Seavy, Billy Resor and myself mess together. 
We have the wife of one of the men cooking for us and are 
living as well as I want to, in regular home style. White table- 
cloth, white ware and a fork and spoon for every man. Warm 
biscuits and excellent coffee every meal. My duties are light 
and not many of them. All writing. We live in a house, too. 
My health is booming again. That trip brought me out all 
right. This is a splendid place to camp in high, healthy and 
beautiful. There are lots of pretty girls here too, that smile 
very sweetly on shoulder-strapped soldiers, but well, you un- 



6O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

derstand me. I have Billy Stockdale, Trites, Chancey, Geo. 
Shinn, Jesse B. and the rest of the Canton boys in the I7th 
and they are all in excellent health. Chancey will be home in. 
a few days I think. He is second lieutenant in the Fairview 
Company now. Billy Stockdale is sergeant major. Trites is 
romantic, enthusiastic and desponding as ever. Major Rawalt 
is one of the best officers there is in the service. He and I 
will get along splendidly. We are really off in the morning, 
and for a 2OO-mile march. There will be fun before we get 
back. 

Cape Girardeau, February 9, 1862. 

I, like a good boy, wrote you a long letter yesterday, and, 
like a careless fellow, lost it. I told you in it how we "300" 
of us, left here in the p. m. of last Monday, rode all night and 
at daylight made a desperate charge into Bloomfield where 
we found and captured nothing. How a little party of 15 
of our boys were surprised some eight miles beyond Bloom- 
field by 80 Rebels and one of them captured, one badly 
wounded and another's horse shot and he at last accounts, 
running in the swamps. How the major got together his 
men and went out and captured some 20 of the bushwhackers 
and killed five and how he returned to the Cape, etc. You 
have read about this riding and marching all night until I 
expect you hardly think of its being fatiguing and somewhat 
wearing on the human system, etc., but allow me to assure 
you that it is. Novice as I am in riding, the cold and fatigue 
were so severe on me that I slept like a top horseback, although 
I rode with the advance guard all the time and through coun- 
try the like of which I hope you'll never see. There is a 
swamp surrounding every hill and there are hills the whole 
way. Damn such a country. We passed, a small scouting 
party of us, the bones of seven Union men. They were all 
shot at one time. I didn't go with the party to see them. One 
of our guards went out with a party of nine of the I7th In- 
fantry boys and captured some 20 secesh and brought in, in 
a gunny sack, the bones of five other Union men. I noticed*

there were no skulls and asked the guide where they were. 
He said that "as true as truth the secesh who murdered them 
had taken the skulls to use for soup bowls." I was talking 
with a man to-night who had his two sons shot dead in the 
house by his side last week. A gang of fellows came to the 
house while he was eating supper and fired through between 
the logs. He burst open the door and escaped with but one 
shot in him after he saw that his sons were killed. I can 
hardly believe that these things are realities, although my eyes 
and ears bear witness. In my reading I can remember no 
parallel either in truth or fiction for the state of things we 
have in this southeastern portion of Missouri. Anyone can 
have his taste for the marvelous, however strong, glutted by 
listening to our scouts and the refugees here. I thank God 
from my heart that dear old Illinois knows nothing of the 
horrors of this war. The I7th left here yesterday for Fort 
Henry. The boys were very glad to start. The old 8th was 
there with the first. I almost wish I had stayed with her. 
Without bragging or prejudice I am satisfied that the 8th is 
the best in every respect of the whole 100 regiments I have 
seen and has the best colonel. Colonel Kellogg is now com- 
manding the post and Sid. is "A. A. A. General," and I am 
"A Regimental Adjutant." My duties are light, though, and I 
am in tip-top health. That ride didn't hurt me at all. I can 
stand riding with the best of them. I suppose that Sam will 
be with us soon. I hope our regiment will be ordered to 
Kentucky. I believe I'd rather be shot there than to bush- 
whack around in Missouri much longer. The major and I 
will get along capitally. He stands fatigue equal to any of 
us. He and I took a ride of 30 miles alone through the 
swamps the other day. Send my watch the first chance you 
have. 

Cape Girardeau, Mo., February 14, 1862. 
Sam arrived here to-night and brought me everything I 
could wish for except my watch. Jem Harper from Company 
K is home on furlough and we expect him now shortly, also

Benton Spencer. If you could manage to send the watch 
by one of them I would be much obliged. I cannot well get 
along without one now. You seem to be very happy about my 
getting away from the Point. Rather more so than I am 
myself. If I had stayed there I would have been with a fair 
chance to fight to fight soldiers. Here there are no forces 
to fight but a few hundred bushwhackers that will lie by the 
roadside in the swamp, and I believe they would murder Jesus 
Christ if they thought he was a Union man. We failed in 
doing what we wanted to the last trip, but I believe we'll get 
even with them yet. I'd hate mightily to get killed by such 
a pack of murderers, but that isn't my business. If U. B. and 
father have experienced such trips as we have, I'll bet I beat 
them in one thing enjoying them. I always feel better out 
that way than in camp. The nth Missouri is still with us 
and the i/th has gone to Tennessee. The colonel, Ross, picked 
out 50 or 60 of his most worthless men and put them on the 
gunboats. There are some hopes that our regiment will be 
ordered to Kentucky soon or to Wheaton, Mo., for there is 
a regiment of Missourians here forming that will be sufficient 
to guard this vicinity. This place if not entirely secession is 
very strongly southernly righteous. I am getting acquainted 
with the female population slowly, not very, and one family 
of three girls tell me they are positively the only unconditional 
Union women in town. But the others show nothing of the 
cold shoulder to us. They are all very friendly and sociable. 
Quite a number of beautiful girls here. The aristocracy here 
are all Catholic. Funny, isn't it? Frenchy. 

Headquarters 7th Illinois Cavalry, 
Cape Girardeau, Mo., February 19, 1862. 
Aren't things working right now? Do you notice the ac- 
counts of the old 8th, and will you say again that I got out 
of her ranks at the right time? I knew that the 8th would 
never make her colonel (God bless him!) to blush, or dis- 
honor her friends or herself. I have seen only the St. Louis 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 63 

papers of i8th with very meager dispatches, but enough to 
know that she had the "post of honor" and plenty of fighting. 
Two hundred of them with Major Post are prisoners. I'll 
bet my life Company E is not among them. If the Rebels will 
keep the major and exchange the men the regiment will gain. 
If I was in the 8th yet and knew what I do now I wouldn't 
leave her for any commission there is in this post. I've got 
a good easy place here and have the good will of everybody 
around me, but my soul and sympathies are with the 8th, and 
it makes me sick to think what a fool I was to leave her. I'll 
be shot if I don't love that regiment more than I do the whole 
world beside. I never thought of it so much untill I got 
away. I expect some of our boys of my old mess are killed, 
but its all right, "military necessity," somebody has to go 
under. Eight or nine boatloads of prisoners have passed here 
to-day. They look a little better than our Missouri prisoners 
but are not uniformed, although comfortably dressed. 

Commerce, Mo., February 25, 1862. 

We start to-morrow morning for with from 25,000 

to 40,000 men, who are all piled up here in all kinds of 
shifts. Our regiment takes the advance. At a venture 
I'll bet we get whaled, by vastly superior forces. Good- 
night. 

Near New Madrid, Mo., March 6, 1862. 
What oceans of fun we are having here. Here goes 
for all of it to date, and I'll be lucky if I'm able to tell you 
the finale. We went down to Commerce the 26th of Feb- 
ruary. Troops were scattered everywhere over the town 
and vicinity for 15 miles about. Could form no idea of the 
number there, but it was variously estimated at from 15,- 
ooo to 45,000. On the 28th we started, our regiment in 
advance, and camped that night at Hunter's farm, the same 
place we stopped last fall when going to Bloomfield under 
Oglesby. We reached Hunter's at 2 o'clock p. m., and at 
II the same morning Jeff Thompson had been there wait- 



64 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

ing for us with six pieces of cannon. He skedaddled, but 
still kept in the neighboring swamps. The next morning 
we again started in advance and after a ride of five miles 
heard firing about the same distance ahead. We let the 
horses go and in a very short time were within the limits 
of the muss. We came up with a company of cavalry 
from Bird's Point standing in line at the end of a lane, 
about a mile down which we could see Thompson's forces 
drawn up with his artillery "in battery." He saw us about 
as quick as we got up, and limbered up in double quick 
and scooted. Then the fun commenced. We chased him 
for 15 miles over a splendid straight, wide, level road, 
which he strewed with blankets, guns, hats, and at 
last dropped his artillery. A dozen of our boys kept up 
the chase until within a half mile of New Madrid, where 
they captured a wagon load of grain and a nigger, and 
returned at leisure. We caught a captain, 1st. lieutenant 
and some privates. Next day, the 2d of March, our regi- 
ment went down to New Madrid to reconnoiter. A regular 
colonel went along to draw a map of the country. We 
went it blind right into the edge of town, where we ran 
onto a lot of infantry. As fighting wasn't the object, we 
filed off to the left into a cornfield to get a new view of 
town. We were going slowly down on the town in line 
of battle, when a battery opened on us right smartly. We 
got out of that, but in good order. Only one shell touched 
us and that burst right under a horse's nose. One piece 
bruised the horse a little and knocked the rider off, but 
did not hurt the man at all, and the horse is now fit for 
duty again. Almost miraculous, wasn't it? There were 
lots of shell and balls fell around us. On the 3d the whole 
army got here and we again marched on the burg. The 
gunboats opened on us and we had to draw back. That 
day three 64-pound shells burst within 30 yards of me. 
We have been lying, since then, about two miles from 
town. They throw a shell over here occasionally but 
haven't hurt any body yet at this distance. To-day the 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER^ 65 

cavalry have been out again to see if the gunboats have 
left, (that's all that keeps us from taking the town). The 
boats were still there and again shelled us, killing one 
man and a horse in the Michigan 3d. They killed one 
man on the 3d in the 39th Ohio, and the same shell 
wounded several others. Yesterday 2,000 or 3,000 men 
went around New Madrid down the river ten miles to 
Point Pleasant, but were kept off by the damned gun- 
boats, just like we are here. If two or three of our gun- 
boats could only slip down far enough to see their gunboats 
(two of them) and steamboats coming and going with 
their secesh flags flying. They have burned a half dozen 
houses in town since we came here. Don't know what for. 
Brigadier General Pope who is in command here has been 
made a major general. The colonel has just come from his 
quarters, and reports that Foote will be here with his 
gunboats day after to-morrow at farthest. We have been 
scouting all afternoon and I'm blamed tired. I took four 
men and went it alone. Had a good time but got lost and 
didn't get back until 8 p. m. Captured a lot of ginger 
snaps, and had a good talk with a handsome widow, while 
the boats were firing at the Michigan cavalry on our left. 
These shells don't scare a fellow half as much as the 
thoughts of them do. Why you really don't mind it at all. 
I don't like the idea of those musket balls, but maybe that 
is also worse than the reality. 

Yet near New Madrid, March 12, 1862. 

The enemy are separated from us by only a few corn- 
fields, the country is perfectly plain ; we can see from our tent 
door the smoke stacks of their gunboat, and the music of their 
bands mingles with our own and yet 'tis confounded dull. 

I received a letter from you by mail a few days since. The 
colonel and Sid. and myself take a little ride into the country 
most every evening for mush and milk and 'tis astonishing 
what quantities they do eat. We are all in perfect health 
and good spirits, though since we left Commerce the colonel 



66 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

and major have complained considerably about the fare, but 
'tis better than I'm used to, so I have the advantage of them. 
The evacuation of Manassas, Columbus, etc., have caused 
considerable anxiety for the outburst of these forces which we 
think will be on Buel or maybe further east on our little army 
at the Cumberland Gap. The impression here is that the Rebel 
army at this place has been greatly reinforced since we ar- 
rived here from Kentucky. We number though, full 30,000 
(with a brigade that is now advancing to join us) and feel 
fully able to attend to all of their forces here. General Pope 
told our colonel yesterday that Foote would be here within 
48 hours sure with his gunboats, and that's all we ask. 

There is a review now being made of all the troops here by 
the commanding general. You'd think it quite a spectacle, 
wouldn't you, to see 25,000 troops in line; 3,000 of them cav- 
alry and 36 pieces of artillery. I was left in charge of the 
camp, and although I have my horse at hand saddled wouldn't 
mount him to see them. It's funny how all interest in any- 
thing dies away in a person when they have a full view or 
chance to view the object. We hear a dozen volleys of mus- 
ketry every now and then, and although we all know there's 
been a little fight, it doesn't interfere with conversation and 
nine times out of ten we never hear what caused it. But 
go up to the hospital and you'll find a couple of long rows 
of cots, each with an occupant, and they can tell you of the 
shooting and show a wound that they're prouder of than you 
can imagine. They and their regiments that were under fire 
love to tell it over and over, but the rest of the army, through 
jealousy I believe, never mention it. You'll see a vast deal 
of state pride here. The 7th Cavalry don't acknowledge the 
Michigander troopers to be more than the equals of Jeff 
Thompson's scalawags, and the Michigan boys really seem to 
think that the 7th regiment is not equal to one company of 
.theirs. But I notice the generals here have all taken their 
bodyguards from our regiment. The Illinois boys and the 
lowaians coalesce more readily and seem to have more family 
feeling between them than at least either of these state's 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 67 

troops have for those of other states. Tis the same in the 
Southern army. Arkansas and Missouri troops have a mutual 
hatred for each other that has extended to the citizens of 
these states. This part of Missouri goes a great deal on old 
blood, the best variety I believe is Catholic French, and these 
people have a sovereign contempt for the barbarians of the 
"Arkansaw," while the Arkansawans accuse the Missourians 
of toe-kissing proclivities and cowardice. 

New Madrid, "by Jingo," March 14, 1862. 
Night before last we received four heavy guns from Cairo, 
and two or three of these infantry regiments planted them 
during the night within a half mile of the enemy's main fort 
and within three-fourths of a mile where their gunboats lay. 
The seceshers discovered it at daylight and then the fun com- 
menced. Their gunboats and forts, about 30 or 40 pieces in 
all, put in their best licks all day. We had two regiments lying 
right in front of our guns to support them against a sortie, 
and several other regiments behind ready for a field fight. 
The enemy kept in their works though and it was altogether 
an artillery fight. Our regiment was in the saddle all the 
a. m., but in the p. m. we lay around our quarters as usual 
with not a particle more of excitement perceptible than the 
quietest day in Cairo showed. In the evening the colonel and 
Major Case and myself went out in the country for our 
regular little mush and milk, but that hasn't anything to do 
with the story. The firing ceased about an hour after sunset 
and we turned in for the night with all quiet in camp. About 
2 o'clock this morning three Rebel regiments made a little 
sortie with the intention of doing some devilment, but they ran 
against a field battery of ours that sent them back kiting. This 
morning the fort and town were found to be evacuated. I 
rode down through what is left of the town, for the Rebels 
burned many houses to give their guns a better chance at 
the approaches, and cut down nearly all of the shade trees. 
There was not an inhabitant left in town, they all moved out 
before we came here, and every door was open. The Rebels

I think plundered the town after the citizens left; anyway our 
boys grumbled a good deal about the people's leaving nothing 
in their houses. They went away very badly scared and in 
an awful hurry, for there were tables with wine on, and cards 
and beds that had been used last night and blankets, and they 
left all their heavy artillery. They must have had all of their 
light artillery with the horses hitched to it and harnessed, and 
a lot of horses saddled and tied, for the halters cut with the ties 
left on the posts, showed that they were in too much of a hurry 
to untie. They also left all their tents, some 500, standing, 
most all of them as good as the best of ours, and barracks for 
several regiments, quarters in all for probably 10,000 men, the 
generals say, but I don't think they will hold so many. I think 
we got 40 guns, 24/3 and larger, besides some field pieces. We 
also get a big lot of amunition, lots of mules and wagons, and 
the boys are now fishing out of the river whole boxes of quar- 
termaster's goods clothing, blankets, etc., that the secesh rolled 
in as they ran. The general is better satisfied than if he had 
taken them prisoners. Coming back from the town and fort 
I rode over the ground where the balls lit thickest yesterday. 
They had scratched things around considerably barked trees, 
knocked fences, busted a house or two, plowed ground like 
everything, and by the way, knocked six of our men for keeps, 
and wounded horribly about 15 more. That was all that was 
done yesterday. 'Tis astonishing that no more of our men 
were killed but you must recollect that these infantrymen that 
were supporting our batteries lay in trenches and were all 
killed while well covered, comparatively. One ball struck 
square in the trench and relieved one man of two legs and 
another man of one. I saw one man who had been struck by 
a falling 25-pound solid shot in the centre of his breast and 
went down and out at the small of his back. That was a pretty 
hard sight. While they were firing the hottest our boys would 
jump on their little dirt piles in front of the rifle pits and 
trenches and swing their hats and cheer and drop back into 
their ditches very rapidly. A shell 18 pounds fell about 20 
feet in front of the ditches, and a boy of 12 or 14 years jumped 



ARMY LIFE OF AN lUJlsfQJS SpLpJER. 69 

out and grabbed it up while the fuse was still burning. A 
soldier saw it and hollered at him to drop it and scoot, but 
he hadn't time to get away, so he dropped it and threw him- 
self flat with his feet toward it and almost then it burst, but 
harmlessly. Well, we've got Madrid and enough to pay us 
for our trouble. I think that our loss will be covered by 20 
killed and 35 or 40 wounded in the whole two weeks. That's 
a large estimate. What the next move will be have no idea, 
but some say that we'll cross the river and operate with Grant 
in a southerly direction of course. I'd rather be in this down- 
the-river movement than any other part of the army. Have 
thought so ever since I joined the army. This cavalry business 
is bully. We have all the running around and fun and little 
skirmishing without much of the heavy work and tall fight- 
ing. The loss of the enemy we don't know but there are about 
40 fresh graves at the fort and we found several dead bodies 
there this morning. Also found a half dozen men that were 
left by some means. 

Near Point Pleasant, Mo., March 1 8, '62. 
You see we are creeping along down the river surely if 
the motions are a little slow. This is about 12 miles below 
Madrid and said to be 75 or 80 below Cairo. It is said that 
the Rebels have between a dozen and 20 steamboats above here, 
and I think the object in occupying this point and planting 
artillery here is to make the assurances we have of catching 
them, doubly sure, for the river is considerably less in width 
here than where our guns are at and near Madrid. We re- 
ceived orders to march about sunset last night and started at 
tattoo. Twas a beautiful ride. The road lay for nearly the 
whole distance right along the river bank. 'Twas warm enough 
without overcoat or gloves and Commander Foote added to 
the interest of the ride by his sleep-disturbing music up at 
Island 10. The river makes a horseshoe bend here and Island 
10 lays almost directly east of here across the peninsula. The 
neck is very flat, and we could plainly see the flash of every 
gun and see the bombs burst in the air when more than 20 
or 30 yards from the ground. The roar of the 13 and 1 6-inch 



7O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

mortars is truly terrific. There was no difficulty in disting- 
uishing their reports from the cannons. The evidences of an 
earthquake having performed in this country are visible when 
pointed out. The natives will show you a swamp and say 
that was once inhabitable, and then they'll point out a sand 
ridge about four feet nearer heaven (the surface of course) 
and say that was a swamp. Well, we arrived here at 2 o'clock 
last night and moved nearly two miles back from the river to 
be out of range of a battery the enemy have planted on the 
opposite shore. This two miles, after deducting about 300 
yards where the road runs through the little town, was a 
swamp of mud and water to the horses' bellies. I noticed our 
flag flying on the river bank over an inverted Rebel rag. The 
flag staff was in front of a store that had received three can- 
non shots from the Rebels in their efforts to cut down our 
flag. Nearly every house in town has had one or more doses 
of heavy iron and Several have been burned by shells. Gen- 
eral Palmer is five miles below here with his brigade. He 
was lucky enough yesterday to disable two Rebel gunboats 
out of three that attacked him. I am very anxious to get out 
of this country and into Tennessee if possible, or if we have 
to stay on this side, enough below the swamps to make it a 
little more pleasant. That ride of last night was delicious. 
The order was to march without any unnecessary noise, and 
after 10:30 (it was 2 when we got here), the boys were all 
perfectly quiet, many of them asleep, and I believe I enjoyed 
myself better than I ever did before in my life. Can't begin 
to tell you precisely why, except there might have been some 
air-castle building, but 'twas very pleasant. I hear to-night 
that Island 10 was evacuated last night. Think maybe Foote 
has his hands full up there, and doubt the evacuation idea 
some. Gracious how it rained last night, commenced just 
after we got here, with some awful heavy thunder and don't 
know how long it lasted. 'Twas raining to kill when I went 
to sleep. We had no tents with us and every fellow provided 
for himself. I went to bed with a lot of bacon and a barrel 
under a tent fly and slept a la log. To-day it has been real

warm. Shirt sleeves and shade were in requisition. Well, I'll 
write you a little every day until I can send letters. 

Twentieth. To-day 'tis cloudy and we have fire in the tent 
and I wear my cloak besides. There are no news of any kind to- 
day. We are on a little piece of dry land here (some of the 
earthquake's "get up" I suppose) entirely surrounded by 
swamps of the vilest kind, cane and cypress. We have dug 
wells all through camp. Find plenty of water at five feet. 
The Rebel battery across the river has been trying to shell 
us this morning. They sent some shell plenty far enough but 
they lit off to the right of our camp. General Plummer rides 
down along the river bank with his staff every day and the 
Rebels do their best to send him up. The colonel has just 
started out with him to give the Rebels another chance. There 
is considerable cane here and it looks as though the country 
might grow alligators to almost any extent. 'Tis a grand 
country for a sporting man. The very paradise of geese and 
their kindred. 

Point Pleasant, Mo., March 24, 1862. 
It's only 9 a. m., and didn't get to bed until 2 this 
morning, so if I do not talk rational you will excuse me. 
That isn't the excuse either. I rode 50 miles between 9 
a. m. yesterday and midnight over roughest road. Two 
hundred of us were sent out after that d d Jeff Thomp- 
son. We exchanged shots with his pickets 20 miles from 
here, and chased them four miles farther. The last eight 
miles was a pike only eight feet wide, thrown up through 
an immense swamp, and planked. The water came so 
close to the planks that there was not a pla.ce in the whole 
eight miles where a horse dare step off the plank. The 
total of all the unusual sights I ever saw wouldn't begin 
to count one in effect where that road and swamp will 
ten. There are two good sized rivers running through 
the swamp but they have to be pointed out to you before 
you can see them, or rather distinguish them from the rest 
of the swamp. When we first saw these pickets they were

tearing up a culvert. We hurried up and after each side 
fired four or five rounds they ran. No one hurt here^ al- 
though the distance was not more than 60 yards. Andy 
Hulit, my sergeant major and myself were the advance 
guard, but I have no carbine, and did not get to shoot, 
but this didn't seem to make arty difference to them for 
they threw buckshot round me quite promiscuously. Well, 
we fixed up that bridge and pressed on, but they tore down 
so many bridges that we could go but slowly. Just before 
the fight I had dropped back a dozen files to get out of 
building any rrtore bridges, and when Our boys saw the 
secesh, they had just finished destroying another. The 
horses couldn't cross it, but the boys dismounted and 
hurrying across on foo't, made them take to the swamp 
in water waist deep, Where they hid themselves behind 
logs', vines and a kind of high grass that grotos in bunches 
as large as a currant bush. When they had concealed 
themselves to their notion, they commenced firing at us, 
and of the first four of our boys over the bridge (Andy 
Hulit led them), three were down, Wounded in a minute. 
We then charged (on foot) right into the brush and water, 
some of the boys up to their armpits, and made them 
scoot. They did not nurtiber over 20 but their advantage 
was enormous. We dropped two of them certain, and 
I don't think any more. Of four of our men they wounded, 
three Were Company L boys. The two Cockerel brothers, 
Mathew and Royal, and Eugene Greenslit. The other was 
from Company A. The Company A boy and Mat Cockerel 
died before We got them to camp. Royal has a fl'esh wound 
in the arm, and Greenslit is shot in the foot, both slight 
wounds. We drove the Rebels clear off, and captured two 
horses, and all their blankets, overcoats etc. About 15 
miles out we came to Little River. While the major was 
examining the bridge, we saw a half dozen men running 
through a swamp on the other side. Over the bridge w 
Went, and into the mud and water after them. We got 
them all. I capttired a couple in a thicket. Andy Hulit

came up a few minutes after and we had work to keep a 
lot of boys from shooting them, while we were taking 
them back to the river. Well, that was a pretty rough trip 
and I don't hanker after another like it, although the ex- 
citement is rather pleasant too. But being set up for a 
mark on a road where there is not a sign of a chance to 
dodge, and having the marksman completely concealed 
from you, and this other fix of letting them throw shells 
at you when your carbine won't carry to them, sitting 
on horseback too, I wish it understood I'm opposed to 
and protest against, although I never think so until I get 
back to camp. I don't think that I ever get a bit excited 
Over firing, but I know that I don't look at danger the 
same when under fire that I do when in quarters. We are 
all well and I'm getting fat every day. It bores considera- 
bly here to think that that one horse Island No. 10 won't 
come down and surrender like a "gem'men." Some of the 
officers here think that we'd better be getting out "o' this," 
but I propose to let Pope work out the salvation of this 
division. We started from Commerce in General Hamil- 
ton's division, were put in General Granger's at Madrid, 
and are now in General Plummer's. Well, I'm going to do 
a little sleeping. 

Camp near Point Pleasant, Mo., March 26, 1862. 
It is, to-day, very much warmer. I'm altogether too 
hot to be comfortable in my shirt sleeves. Don't know 
what is to become of us in July if it is so hot in proportion. 
I shake in my boots at the thought of the mosquitoes, flies, 
etc., we will have to endure. Vegetation is giving the sur- 
roundings a greenish appearance already, and have seen 
a peach tree in nearly full bloom. Wheat is about three 
or four inches above ground. Makes a very respectable 
sod. I think there are more Union people here than in 
any part of Missouri that I have been in, and fewer 
widows. Men are nearly all at home and putting in their 
crops as coolly as though there was no war. Some of our 



74 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

soldiers impose on the natives pretty badly. You don't 
know how thankful you ought to be that you don't live 
in the invaded country. Wherever there is an army, for 
10 or 15 miles around it there will be hundreds of strag- 
glers. Some out of curiosity, some to see the natives and 
talk with them, but the majority to pick up what they can 
to eat. There is not a farm house within ten miles of 
camp, notwithstanding the positive orders against strag- 
gling, that has not, at least, 50 soldier visitors a day, and 
they are the poorest soldiers and the meanest men that do 
all the straggling, or nearly all. They will go into a house 
and beg what they can and then steal what is left. Rough, 
dirty, coarse brutes, if they were all shot, our army would 
be better off. Most of these fellows are bullies at home, 
and that class makes plunderers in war. I've seen enough 
of war to know that it isn't the brawling, fighting man at 
home that stands the bullet whistle the best. A favorite 
game of these chaps, where they are not utterly depraved 
(there are a good many of the latter), is for a couple of 
them to go in the house and make themselves as interest- 
ing as possible while the others clean out the smokehouse, 
chicken yard, and the premises generally. The greatest 
objection and the only one I have to being in the army, 
is the idea of being associated, in the minds of the people 
of this country, as well as the home folks, with such brutes. 
But I tell you, that I have always acted the gentleman to 
the best of my ability since I entered the army, and I don't 
believe I'm a whit worse than I was at home. I haven't 
drank one-tenth as much liquor as I did in the same length 
of time at home, and you know how much that was, and 
that I hate the stuff too much to ever taste it unless forced 
upon me. The last I touched was with poor George Shinn 
just before the I7th left the cape. We drank to "Our next 
shake hands, may it be at the end of the war, at home, and 
before three months." George was a No. I soldier. We 
boys all think everything of him. Tell him we all sympa- 
thize with him and wish him a speedy recovery, and that 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 75 

his services may not be needed any more. Seems to me 
I write you nearly every day, but haven't had a letter 
from home for two or three weeks. Our mail is very ir- 
regular though, and I can excuse, but I would like you to 
get all of mine and save them, for I would like to look 
these over myself when I get home, as I keep no diary. 
The day is so warm that our boys are all out bathing in 
a little swamp lake near here. The Lord knows some of 
them need it. Cleanliness is undoubtedly the best preven- 
tive of disease in the army. Hardly any of the boys that 
are cleanly suffer from disease. The colonel and Sidney 
went to Cairo yesterday. The colonel with dispatches 
from General Pope, I believe, and Sid. just because he 
could. We buried our two boys yesterday morning that 
were killed at Cane Bridge, and I never felt sadder in my 
life. I'm sure that knowing I would be killed to-morrow 
wouldn't hurt me half as much. These poor fellows have 
suffered all the hardships and trials of the private soldier's 
life, and are now put under the ground in the dark swamp, 
without a friend here, save their comrades, and probably 
after the army leaves, a friendly eye will never see their 
graves. I sent a package of letters back to a young lady 
that one of them was engaged to. Our men have been 
living on mush and the other messes, makeable from corn- 
meal, for a week, without coffee or anything else. Couldn't 
get provisions through from Cairo near fast enough, and 
Pope gobbled up everything that did come for the troops 
at Madrid. Chet. Caswell, a Canton boy, is here now and 
cooking for our mess. I can live on fried mush as long 
as the next man. The frogs, bugs, blackbirds and sich like, 
keep up a perfect bedlam around us the whole time. 

Point Pleasant, Mo., March 28, 1862. 

There isn't a thing to write only that they keep up the in- 
fernal "boom, boom," with their cannons all day and night 
long. It's perfectly disgusting the way they waste powder 
and iron without killing anyone. They have knocked every 



76 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

house in town to flinders, and round shot and grape and shell 
are lying thick on the ground and yet we haven't a man 
touched. They were having a hot time with their cannon and 
some musketry firing, too, down at Palmer's last night from 
10 p. m. to 2 a. m., but haven't heard yet what was up. I 
have my own reasons for thinking that they are evacuating 
Island 10. If they don't do it this week I'll believe that they 
are waiting for a lot of gunboats to come up from Orleans, 
and that we'll have the fun of a naval engagement in the vicin- 
ity. If there is one within 40 miles of here I'm going to see 
it if I have to wade a swamp ten feet deep, as I probably will, 
but see it I'm bound to. Then if the Rebels whale our craft 
you'll be likely to hear the sound of their cannon before long- 
without leaving home, for there's nothing to prevent their go- 
ing anywhere after they pass our gunboats. It will be a great 
joke on Uncle Sam if they do make that riffle. Wonder what 
would become of the home guards. About the worst feature 
of the case would be the Southern officers sparking our girls 
as we do theirs now and the worst yet is, there is no doubt 
the girls would take to it kindly, for they do here, and I'm 
satisfied there is no difference in the feminines of the two 
sections, except that ours do not say "thar" and "whar." I 
see that it requires a good many "ifs" and "theirs" to arrange 
a case of this kind, but I assure you that it is not out of the 
range of possibilities. How'd you like to see a "Captain St. 
Clair de Monstachir" with C. S. A. on his buttons, making 
calls in Canton? I'll bet ten to one he could enjoy himself in 

that burg. Bang ! Boom ! D n the cannons ! It's awful 

tiresome. I do hope we'll get them cleaned out of this ere 
long. I don't understand why it is that our mails are so tardy. 
We get the Chicago and St. Louis papers two days after pub- 
lication. I almost think that Pope has ordered our mail to lay 
over in Cairo until further orders. 

Camp, near Point Pleasant, Mo., April 4, 1862. 
I received your last letter within three days after it was 
mailed, and praised Uncle Sam duly therefor. Our regiment 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 77 

has had a run of bad luck since we've been here. Two tnen 
killed on the plank road, two wounded at same place, two 
killed by falling trees in a storm of night of April 1st, and a 
dozen wounded, and yesterday one drowned while watering 
his horse in the swamp, and our horses dying off very fast of 
horse cholera. The latter is a serious thing in a regiment 
were the men own the horses themselves. For they (or 
nearly all of them) cannot buy others. Most of them are still 
owing for the horses they have. The positions of troops and 
state of the war generally remains the same here as it has 
been ever since we took Madrid. Main body of our forces at 
that place. Five regiments here under Plummer and five 
seven miles further down the river with Palmer. That is as 
far down as we can go on this side for the swamps. Between 
here and Madrid we have batteries every three miles and the 
Rebels have rather more on the opposite side. Both are right 
on their respective banks and have their flags fluttering their 
mutual hatred in each others faces. We can see them very 
plainly without the aid of a glass. The Rebel gunboats lie just 
below our lower battery and 'tis rumored to-night that sev- 
eral new ones have arrived from Memphis or New Orleans. 
This fuss about "Island 10" I think is all humbug. Don't 
believe they have attacked it yet. It don't sound like Foote's 
fighting. Look on the map and see what a nice pen there 
is between the rivers Tennessee and Mississippi. Don't it look 
that if Grant and company can whip them out at Corinth, that 
we'll have all the forces at Memphis and intermediate points 
to "Island 10" in a bag that they'll have trouble in getting 
through? If they run it will be into Arkansas, and they can 
take nothing with them but what their backs will stand under. 
Seems to me that the plans of the campaign are grand from 
the glimpses we can get of them and have been planned by at 
least a Napoleon. Certain it is we are checkmating them at 
every point that's visible. I firmly believe the summer will 
see the war ended. But it will also see a host of us upended 
if We have to fight over such ground as this. It is unpleasantly 
warm already in the sun. It's 10 p. m. how and plenty warm

in my shirt sleeves, with a high wind blowing, too. We had 
an awful storm here to commence April with. We are camped 
just in the wood's edge and the wind struck us after crossing 
a wide open field and knocked trees down all through our 
camp; killed First Lieutenant Moore, one private, seriously 
wounded Captain Webster and a dozen men. During the 
storm I though of our fleet at "Island 10" and it made me 
almost sick. Don't see how they escaped being blown high 
and dry out of water. 

April 5, 1862. One of our boys has just returned from 
Madrid and says he saw our gunboat Cairo there. She 
slipped by the batteries at "Island No. 10" in the storm 
la,st night. Mosquitoes here already. 

Headquarters 7th Illinois Cavalry, 

In a very fine House, 

Point Pleasant, Mo., April 7, 1862. 
If this isn't fine your brother is incapable of judging. 
Cozy brick house, damask curtains, legged bedsteads, 
splendid tables and chairs, big looking glass, and every- 
thing just as fine as a peacock's tai!. I do wish you could 
have been with me the last two days. They've been two 
of the best days of my life. During the storm of Saturday 
night, the 5th instant, one of the gunboats ran by "Island 
10." I heard of it early Sunday morning, and got out a 
pass for Andy Hulit and myself to look for forage, in- 
tending, of course, to ride down to the river and watch the 
gunboat as we knew there'd be fun if she attempted to run 
below Madrid. We rode up the river about six miles (half 
way) to a point that extends into the river on our side, 
and got there just as the boat did. 'Twas the "Carondelet," 
and indeed she looked like an old friend. The sight of her 
did me more good than any amount of furloughs could. 
At this point, I spoke of, we have three batteries within a 
half-mile, and there were two Rebels' batteries visible 
right at the water's edge, opposite. We just got there in 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 79 

time to see the ball open. Besides the two secesh batteries 
visible, they opened from four others masked by the brush 
and trees, and hitherto unknown to us. Their six, our 
three, the gunboats, all firing together made by far the 
grandest thing I ever witnessed. I suppose there were 
from 30 to 40 guns used, and at least a half thousand shots 
fired. Andy and I were on a little rise of ground a couple 
of hundred yards from our main battery and where 
we could see every shot fired and its effect. There were 
lots of shots fell around that battery, but none near enough 
us to be disagreeable. About an hour's fighting silenced 
the Rebel batteries, and that fun was over. Our boat 
didn't go over to them at that time, but came into our shore 
and laid up. She was not struck once, nor was there a man 
hurt on our side. Andy and I rode out in the country and 
got our dinners with a friend of mine, and about 3 p. m. 
started home. We just got back here as the gunboat was 
preparing to attack the batteries immediately opposite 
here. She ran down the river on our side, a mile below 
their guns, and then turning her bow square toward the 
enemy, started for them and commenced fifing. We could 
see every motion of the Rebel gunners plainly, and they 
worked like men, until the boat got within about 300 
yards of them, when they broke, and I tell .you they used 
their legs to advantage ; all but one and he walked away 
with his arms folded perfectly at ease. There's an im- 
mense sight of enjoyment in witnessing such fights as 
these. Well, I saw another fight this morning, but 'twas 
too far off for interest, after what I saw yesterday. Two 
more gunboats came down last night in the rain and dark- 
ness past the island. This fight this morning was com- 
menced by the Carondelet, on a five-gun battery, only four 
miles below and across from Madrid. She called the 
Louisville to her aid, and then one walked up on the bat- 
tery from below and the other from above. It is grand 
to see these gunboats walk into the enemy. They go at 
them as though they were going right on land, if the 
Rebels would stay there. (One hour later, 9 p. m.) 



3o 

Just as I finished the last period, an artillery captain 
came dashing up through the door, just from Madrid, and 
wanted to know where the gunboats were. He said that 
the Rebel floating battery, that has been lying at Island 
jo, was floating down and the transports were afraid to 
try and bring her into land, and he wanted to notify the 
gunboats so they could catch her. We told him they had 
gone down to Palmer's division, six miles below, and away 
he went. I've been out waiting to see her pass, but she 
hasn't arrived yet. He said she was not more than three 
miles above. All such items help to make soldiering inter- 
esting. Our three transports have taken 20,000 troops over 
into Tennessee since 9 :3O this a. m. I call that good work. 
Colonel Kellogg has gone over with Pope to see the battle, if 
there is any. These Rebels don't begin to fight a gun equal 
to our boys, and all the people here say so. I really do 
not believe they have the "bullet-pluck" that our men 
show. Our regiment is left here alone in its glory. We're 
occupying the town, enjoying life, and having all the fun 
we want. I killed a mosquito to-night, and it brought up 
such disagreeable thoughts that I couldn't eat supper. If 
they don't eat my surplus flesh off me, I know I'll fret 
myself lean as they increase. The colonel got back yester- 
day. You ought to have seen him look at the eatables last 
night, and shaking his head with disgust, go back to his 
tent without touching a bite. The first camp meal after 
a furlough I suppose isn't particularly delightful. There's 
no telling whether there'll be a fight to-morrow or not. 
We'll probably not assist if there is. But after the fight 
is over and the victory won we'll come in and chase the 
Rebels until they scatter. The infantry do the heavy, 
dirty work and get the honor, and we have all the fun 
and easy times there are going. Fm willing. I'd rather 
scout and skirmish than anything I know of, and am per- 
fectly willing to let the infants do the heavy fighting, for 
they only make an artillery target of us when we're 
brought on battle fields. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 8l 

There wouldn't be much left of my letters if I'd leave 
out the war gossip! Forty of the Rebels deserted and 
came to our gunboats to-day. Sergeant Wells, who while 
over there is a spy, was taken prisoner the other day, es- 
caped to our gunboats. It saved his neck. 

April 10. The Rebels have run and left Island 10, and 
our boys have taken some 2,000 of them prisoners below 
here. They passed up on a boat this morning. We will 
be paid off to-day or to-morrow. 

Camp New Madrid, Mo., April 12, 1862. 
I have the extreme happiness to inform you that there is at 
last a hope of my dating the next letter from Memphis or 
vicinity. Our regiment has for several days been alone at 
Point Pleasant and we enjoyed it very much. When we are 
under a general of an infantry division we are run to death 
or thereabouts, for whenever anything is to be done the cavalry 
is sure to be called on. Yesterday we were ordered to re- 
port here immediately to General Granger, commanding cavalry 
division which numbers full 4,000. There are two brigades 
in this -division; Colonel Kellogg commands the ist brigade 
and therefore is now a brigadier general. There have been 
about 25 steamboats arrived here since 4 p. m. yesterday and 
the army will probably commence embarking to-day. It will 
take full 60 boats to hold us all. The rain has been falling in 
torrents ever since we started from the Point yesterday, and 
you can imagine the time we had pitching tents in a corn- 
field, and yet we are comfortable now as we can wish. I 
have faith to believe that they (or anybody else) can't keep 
me from being comfortable under any circumstances, if my 
hands are loose and I can walk. I think that Pope's hurry is 
caused by his fear that Grant and company will reach Mem- 
phis before him. We hardly think that the Rebels will make 
a stand at Pillow, Randolph or Memphis if the news from 
Corinth is correct. I'm almost afraid to look over the list of 
dead that fight was made. Sid. says he is sure Billy Stock- 
dale is killed. We received papers of the loth last night but 



82 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

are not sure the victory is a complete one yet. I can't think 
of the point where the enemy will make another stand if they 
are perfectly whipped at Corinth. 

I know as many people here as in Fulton, almost, and I 
have yet to hear the first insulting speech or word to me. 
"What are they going to do with Island No. 10 I wonder; 
I am afraid that Commander Foote and his gunboats are a 
humbug." Aren't you ashamed of that speech? Damn the 
New York Tribune. I do believe in McClellan and nearly all 
the rest of our leaders. If those Tribunes, big and little, were 
where any regiment in this army could get at them they 
wouldn't stand fifteen minutes. McClellan knows his business 
and we don't know a thing about it. Now old Pope here is 
as mean a man as ever lived, curses every man that comes 
within a hundred yards of him and nobody knows a thing of 
his designs, but we all have the utmost confidence in him. 
I've never seen him and wouldn't go in sight of him for a 
horse, but he's my man for a' that. 

Orders have just arrived for embarking this p. m. Will 
be under way down the river to-night Wish us a pleasant 
voyage. 

Oh Steamer Henry Clay, off New Madrid, Mo., 

April 16, 1862. 

I finished my last in a great hurry, helped strike and load 
our tents and equipage and started for the levee, confident that 
we would be off for Memphis, Orleans and intermediate 
landings, before the world would gain 12 hours at farthest in 
age. That day over 30 steamers arrived, received their loads 
of soldiers and departed, all down stream, preceded by six or 
eight gunboats and 16 mortarboats. Word came at nightfall 
that there were not enough boats for all and the cavalry would 
have to wait the morrow and more transports. We lay on 
the river banks that night, and the next day all the cavalry got 
off except our brigade of two regiments. Another night on 
the banks without tents, managed to get transportation for 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 83 

two battalions, one from each regiment. They started down 
yesterday at about 10 a. m. and more boats coming we loaded 
two more battalions, but at 9 p. m. a dispatch boat came up 
with orders for us to stop loading and await further orders. 
The same boat turned back all the cavalry of our brigade 
that had started and landed them at Tiptonsville ; we are at 
6 this p. m. lying around loose on the bank here awaiting 
orders. That boat brought up word that our fleet was at 
Fort Pillow, and the Rebels were going to make a stand there, 
but that nothing had occurred when she left but some gun- 
boats skirmishing. What the devil we are going to do is 
more than three men like me can guess. It's awful con- 
founded dull here. Nothing even half interesting. Saw a 
cuss, trying to drown himself yesterday, and saw a fellow's leg 
taken off last night. These are better than no show at all, 
but still there's not much fun about either case. I'm bored 
considerably by some of my Canton friends wanting me to 
help them get their niggers out of camp. Now, I don't care 
a damn for the darkies, and know that they are better off with 
their masters 50 times over than with us, but of course you 
know I couldn't help to send a runaway nigger back. I'm 
blamed if I could. I honestly believe that this army has taken 
500 niggers away with them. Many men have lost from 15 
to 30 each. The owners were pretty well contented while the 
army stayed here, for all the generals assured them that when 
we left the negroes would not be allowed to go with us, and 
they could easily get them back ; but they have found out that 
was a "gull" and they are some bitter on us now. There will 
be two Indiana regiments left here to guard the country from 
Island 10 to Tiptonsville, and if you don't hear of some fun 
from this quarter after the army all leaves but them, I'm mis- 
taken. They'll have their hands full if not fuller. We have 
not been paid yet but probably will be this week. I tell you I 
can spend money faster here than anywhere I ever was in my 
life, but of course I don't do it. Am trying to save up for 
rainy weather, and the time, if it should come, when I'll have 
only one leg to go on or one arm to work with. That Pitts- 

6 



84 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

burg battle was one awful affair, but it don't hurt us any. 
Grant will whip them the next time completely. Poor John 
Wallace is gone. He was a much better boy than he had 
credit for being. We all liked him in the old mess very much. 
Ike Simonson, of same company, I notice was wounded. He 
was also in my mess; was from Farmington. There are no 
rumors in camp to-day. Yesterday it was reported and be- 
lieved that the Monitor had sunk the Merrimac, that York- 
town was taken, and that another big fight had taken place at 
Corinth and we held the town. That was very bully but it 
lacks confirmation. Think it will for sometime yet, but Pope 
says we'll come out all right through all three of those trials. 
It's just what's wanted to nip this rebellion up root and all. 
That's a rather dubious victory up to date, that Pittsburg 
affair, but guess it's all right. 

Headquarters 7th Illinois Cavalry Camp, on Hamburg 
and Corinth Road, 

May 3, 1862. 

I arrived here yesterday in safety. Stayed in Peoria the 
Monday night that I started, and was in Cairo at 9 p. m. 
Wednesday. Woke up Thursday morning on a boat at Pa- 
ducah and devoted the day to admiring the Tennessee river. 
Stopped long enough at Fort Henry to get a good view of its 
well pummeled walls, and not-much-to-brag-of defences. 
The line of ditching without the works was the best I have 
ever seen, but the parapet, excepting that of the Fort 
proper, wasn't to be compared to our works at Bird's 
Point, which are the most inferior of ours that I have 
seen. The Tennessee runs through a perfect wilderness. 
There is not a landing on the river up to this point (Ham- 
burg) that can begin with Copperas Creek, and indeed, 
although I watched closely, I did not see more than three 
or four points, that of themselves, showed they were boat 
landings, and those only by the grass being worn off the 
bank ; and I did not see a warehouse on either bank unless, 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 85 

maybe, one at Savannah, where there are also, say four fine 
dwellings. At no other point did I see more than three 
houses, and very rarely, even one. Having heard so much 
of the richness of Middle Tennessee I cannot help talking 
so long of what ought to be, to it, what the Illinois river 
would be to us were we without railroads. I reached 
Hamburg yesterday afternoon (Friday) and started for 
my regiment, which I learned was five miles out on the 
Corinth way. I walked out as fast as I could, and reached 
there to hear that the army had moved on and were proba- 
bly two miles ahead and yet going. I laid down and slept 
a couple of hours, borrowed a horse, and after six miles 
riding found them going into camp. Monstrous hilly 
country, this, and save a very few clearings, all heavily 
timbered. Pope's army has been reinforced considerably 
since we arrived here. Think he has, say 30 odd thousand 
men. I think the ball opened just before I commenced 
this letter. For two days past we have had one batallion 
out about four miles beyond our present camp holding an 
important position. They have been within gunshot of the 
enemy all the time, but so protected that although they 
skirmished a good deal, but one of ours was wounded. In 
one little charge our boys made out they killed four and 
wounded a number of Rebels that they felt of. Pope's 
infantry came up to-day in force and relieved them. 
Paine's division was advanced and when not more than 
40 yards beyond the post our cavalry held, were opened 
on first by musketry and immediately afterwards by artil- 
lery. There was very heavy firing for an half hour, but 
it has ceased since I commenced this page. Haven't heard 
the result. We have orders to move forward to-morrow 
morning, but although we are so close to the enemy's posi- 
tion, (not more than three miles) (Infantry, of course, I 
mean) don't think our side will commence the attack be- 
fore Monday morning, when we will see sure if they 
don't run.

Supper. Some of our boys have just come in with a lot 
of overcoats, trinkets, etc., spoils of the afternoon skirmish. 
They were all Illinois regiments that were engaged. A ser- 
geant has just showed me an overcoat that he stripped off 
a dead secesh, who with eleven others was lying in one pile. 
He captured a captain who, after he had thrown down his 
sword, offered to give him a fist fight. The artillery firing 
was mostly from Rebel guns at Farmington at a regiment 
of our boys building a bridge. The Northern Mississippi 
line runs through our camp. We cannot be far form luka 
Springs, although no one that I've seen ever heard of the 
place. Report has just come that Mitchell has been driven 
out of Huntsville, and another that Yorktown and 45,000 
prisoners are ours. Don't believe either. Shall write you 
from Corinth if have luck. 

Near Farmington, Miss., May 8, 1862. 
I've been within one and a half miles of Corinth to-day. 
Didn't see anything especially worthy of mention, but had 
full rations in the way of leaden bullets whistle. Yea, and 
larger missiles also. For four days past our battalion has 
been the advanced picket of Pope's army, full five miles in 
advance of the army. We have been skirmishing the 
whole time, not five minutes passing without more or less 
shooting. Our picket line was on one side of a long prairie 
or clearing, from 300 to 450 yards wide, and theirs on the 
opposite side. With all the firing, the losses on our side 
was but one horse up to this morning, and we were con- 
gratulating ourselves on getting on so well, when the ad- 
vance of a large reconnoitering party under General Paine 
came in sight and we were ordered to lead them. Well, it's 
all over now, and we've had our Maj. Z. Applington killed, 
several wounded, and horses hurt by bursting shells. It's 
all right, I suppose, but damn the general that sent us on 
a fool's errand. We've a strong old place to take here at 
Corinth, but guess we'll make the riffle. The major fell 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 8/ 

while leading a charge along a road. The timber and 
brush by the roadside were so thick that we could see 
nothing until our boys received the volley of musketry, 
of which one ball reached the major's brain. The recon- 
noitering party returned to camp last night, and this morn- 
ing the Rebels took their turn. They advanced in con- 
siderable force, drove our men back some two miles, 
captured a couple of pieces of cannon, and filled our hos- 
pitals pretty well. Our regiment was not in that fight. 
The Iowa 2d Cavalry suffered badly, 'tis said, in trying to 
take a Rebel battery. 

Lieutenant Herring was wounded by a drunken soldier 
of the 4th Regular Cavalry yesterday, and Captain Nelson 
knocked down by the same man. Herring was shot 
through the arm. A suspender buckle that the ball glanced 
from saved his life. It's a little doubtful whether this 
fight comes off immediately. I think and hope that our 
folks are going to let them concentrate all their troops 
here and then make a Waterloo of it. That is, a Waterloo 
for them, but if they whip us, call out the home-guards 
and try them again. Weather here almost too warm for 
comfort in daytime, but deliciously cool after sunset. Ap- 
ples and peaches are as large as hickory nuts, and black- 
berries the size of peas. The water is very good. Think 
will like it as well as Mississippi water after a while. The 
well water is not as cool though as I have seen it. I have 
not visited the 8th or i/th yet. They are in a division that 
forms a reserve (McClernands) and will not fight until the 
rest of Thomas's (formerly Grant's) division have had a 
chance. Shall go and see them immediately after the bat- 
tle if I have luck. My health is perfect yet and am in 
hopes 'twill remain so. My love to inquiring friends, and 
do not expect to hear from me regularly as the mail only 
leaves here semi-occasionally. What a change in climate 
two day's ride make. Trees all in full leaf, and saw 
peaches to-day larger than filberts. Summer coats are in 
demand.

Corinth and Hamburg Road, Miss., May n, 1862. 
You remember that in my last I spoke of a reconnoisance 
our people made on the 8th inst. On the Qth Beauregard 
returned it with interest, driving our advance back some two 
miles and almost scaring this wing of the Eagle. He ap- 
peared on our left flank, where I think Pope thought it im- 
possible for him to reach, and drove Paine's division from 
the front like a drove of sheep. Tis said that a charge made 
by the 2d Iowa Cavalry was the salvation of both of Paine's 
brigades. The charge, if we hear correctly, was one of the 
most gallant things of the war. One of our battalions was 
out yesterday examining our left to see if the Rebels were still 
there. They found no signs of them, but on their return to 
camp were fired into by some of General Buford's artillery, 
and one man killed by a 6-pound solid shot from Company A. 
There is almost incessant firing along the front but too light 
and scattering to forbode an immediate fight of itself, although 
'twould surprise no one to hear of the dance commencing at 
any hour. Corinth is a tremendously strong place, very diffi- 
cult to approach, and holding a force that our officers think 
much superior to our own. This is kept from the army, 
though I don't think now that we have more than 80,000 
fighting men here. They must have over 100,000, and this 
conscription act is pouring in reinforcements to them by thous- 
ands. But, notwithstanding this, I think the superior discip- 
line of our men will give us a victory when the fight does 
come. The strongest evidence that I see of Halleck's weakness 
is his delaying the battle so long We are in distance to strike 
any day; roads splendid, army in better condition every day 
than it will be the next day, weather becoming too hot for 
men to endure much longer, and yet we wait. What for, I 
don't know, unless 'tis for reinforcements. They say Curtis 
and Siegel are coming. I hope they'll get here to-night and 
finish the thing up to-morrow. The weather is taking the vim 
out of the men remarkably. To-day there is a good stray 
breeze, and yet a man can hardly get enough of the rarified 
stuff they call air here to fill his lungs. Plenty of chestnuts 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 89 

in this country. Plenty of hills and plenty of woods but a 
great scarcity of about everything else. There is no more 
soil on the earth here than you'll find on any Illinois school 
house floor, and 'tis a question which would grow the best 
crops. 

The colonel is anxious to have the regiment in the battle 
when it comes off, while your brother thinks if they can do 
the work without us he won't be at all angry. I like skirmish- 
ing pretty well but am dubious about the fun showing itself 
so strongly in a battle. I guess I had a dozen shots thrown 
at me individually on the 8th at from 100 to 450 yards, and 
I got my return shot nearly every time and some extra ones, 
but rather think they all got off as well as I did. The car- 
bines are not very correct shooters, and your brother is a 
ditto, so I have the satisfaction of knowing that I haven't 
killed anybody yet. 

Still in Camp near Corinth, Miss., May 15, 1862. 
It seems to me that we are a long time in bringing this 
"muss a la probable" to a focus. What under the sun our 
Halleck is waiting for we can't guess. One hour's march will 
commence the struggle now and you don't know how anxious 
we are for that little trip. Buell and Thomas have both 
(thrown up long lines of earthworks to fall back behind if 
repulsed, I suppose. We have nothing of that kind in our 
division. We have all been under marching orders since morn- 
ing, and Assistant Secretary of War Scott told the colonel last 
night that the battle would commence to-day but he lied. 
Talk is to-night again that Corinth is evacuated. The main 
body of our army moved up within three miles to-day. My 
battalion has been out since daylight this morning, but we 
have been lying at ease near Pope's headquarters all day wait- 
ing for orders. I came back to camp to stay to-night because 
I had no blanket with me and there was no possibility of any 
more before morning. Have a sore foot now. My confounded 
horse fell down with me in a creek the other day, threw me 
out on the bank in a bunch of blackberry bushes and then

crawled out over me, stepped on my foot in the melee by way 
of showing sympathy, I suppose. It don't hurt my appetite 
any and hasn't put me off duty. 

Near Corinth, Miss., May 19 ,1862. 

Our regiment now is acting as a kind of rear guard for 
Pope's division. The enemy's cavalry in bodies of from 1,000 
down have been running around our left flank and threaten- 
ing to interfere with our trains. Every day we send out six 
companies to patrol between here and the river and forward. 
Yesterday (Sunday) I was out. We went to Red Sulphur 
Springs, one of the most romantic, beautiful places I have ever 
seen. There are about 40 double cottages for families, and 
stables, kennels and quarters for the servants, hounds and 
horses. The buildings are in good repair, though the place has 
not been frequented much for the last three or four years. 
White Sulphur Springs are four miles from the Red and 
more fashionable. I am going there to-morrow. There were 
about a dozen real ladies at the springs yesterday, and they 
were quite sociable and so interesting that I could not help 
staying an hour after the column left We were the first of our 
soldiers that the party had seen and they were much sur- 
prised that our boys behaved so well. None of them had 
ever been North, and they occupied about all the time I was 
with them in asking questions, principally though, about the 
conduct of our army. About a mile before we got to the 
springs we passed a house where there were as many as six 
young ladies in full dress. The major sent me to make some 
inquiries of the man of the house, and I noticed the party 
were in something of a flurry but ascribed it to the presence 
of our men. Of course Sunday was an excuse for the finery 
and there being so many together. After we had advanced a 
little way one of our captains took a squad, went ahead and 
passed himself for a Rebel officer just from Corinth. By his 
figuring he found out that at this house I have spoken of they 
were expecting some Rebel officers and men, 14 in all, from 
Corinth to dinner and a visit. We set a trap for them, but 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 9! 

they heard of us through the citizens and sloped. They came 
within a mile of us and then their tracks showed they had 
gone off through the woods and a swamp on a run. We got 
one of their horses, a beauty, fully equipped. It being a hot 
day the owner had strapped his coat on his valise and not 
having time to take it off we got it. A dozen of our boys 
went back and ate the dinner, but without the company of the 
ladies who had flown. Our line has now closed to within 
two and one-half miles around the north and east sides of 
Corinth. Our men have thrown up breastworks within that 
distance along nearly the whole line. The cannons play on 
each other occasionally, say as an average four times a day, 
a half hour each time. Our line is, I think, nine or ten miles 
long; am not sure. The Rebels are suffering for rations, not 
more than half rations having been served for the last ten days. 
Hundreds are deserting from them. One battalion that was 
raised in this county, over 500 men, have all deserted but 
about 90. The commander himself ran off. Of a 100 men 
that deserted from them probably five come within our lines. 
The rest all go to their homes. If Porter takes Mobile, and 
Farragut and Davis get Memphis, I think in ten days after- 
Ward there will not be enough Rebels left in Corinth to op- 
pose our regiment. There is no doubt that they have more 
men now than we have but they lack discipline. Success at 
the points above named will leave them without any railroad 
communication whatever or telegraph either. I'm afraid that 
our gunboats got the worst of that little affair at Pillow the 
other day. An army is the slowest moving animal. Here 
we've been over a month making 20 miles. I think I shall 
run off to McClernand's division this p. m. and see some of 
the 1 7th and 8th boys. 

Near Corinth, Miss., May 24, 1862. 

I returned last night from a two day's scout. Our orders 

were to scour the country along the Tennessee river to near 

Eastport and return through luka, Burnsville and Glendale. 

A Michigan colonel commanded the party and skipped luka 



92 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

three miles. There were little bands of Rebels in sight nearly 
all the time we were in that vicinity, so that I could not 
gallop off to the place alone, and of course the colonel wouldn't 
let me have men to go with me. 

We rode all day yesterday through a steady rain and over 
roads that were for miles obstructed by felled trees and bridges 
burned. We came back through Pope's division yesterday. 
Think he is as about as well fortified as Beauregard can be. 
'Tis astonishing how much ditching he has done within a 
week. Has also cut down enough trees (to make his left 
unapproachable) to last all of Illinois ten years for firewood. 
There's no site for a Bull Run here. Confederate scrip goes 
among the people here freely. If a man refuses to take it 
they lynch him. Not the citizens but soldiers do the dirty 
work. The people here all say that the seceded States will 
have to go back where they started from. 

Camp on Corinth Road, Miss., May 27, 1862. 

Why don't you write me just a word, if no more? I'm 
almost uneasy. Not a line from home for a month. We 
hear that smallpox is raging in Canton, and I want you to 
write. They say there is some smallpox in the center and 
right of the army, but think 'tis like the milk sickness of our 
Egypt, "a little further on." There's enough sickness of other 
kinds, so we have no room for grumbling if we can't have that 
disease. The hospitals at Hamburg make almost a city. I 
think there can be no more sorrowful sight, real or imaginary, 
than that camp of the sick. 

I don't know the number of patients, somewhere in thous- 
ands, all packed in tents as closely as they can lie, and with 
not one-tenth the care a sick horse would get at home. I 
suppose the surgeons, stewards and nurses have leelings like 
men when they first enter the hospitals, but familarity with 
disease and suffering seem to make them careless and in- 
different to a degree that surprises me, and I can't but look 
upon it as criminal. I suppose nearly half the bad cases are 
typhoid fever. Yellow fever, cholera and smallpox have never 
been known here to the citizens. They all say this is a very 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 93 

healthy country, and I believe it. Our boys are suffering 
from the change of climate and water, and as much as any- 
thing, the sudden change in temperature. Our regiment is im- 
proving in health now rapidly. We have gained about 40 
for duty within a week. We had about 250 sick last week. 
The 1 7th has some 300. I found a batch of live 
secesh women last Sunday. I rode up to a fine 
looking house to get a glass of milk (I suppose I 
drink more milk than any six calves in Fulton) and found 
eight or ten ladies at dinner, accepted a rather cool invitation 
to dine wid' 'em, and did justice to their peas and fodder gen- 
erally, and was much amused. Think there was more spice 
to that dinner than I ever before saw. One black-eyed vixen 
opened the ball with "I don't see how you can hold your head 
up and look people in the face, engaged in the cause you are." 
I told her I thought she had a free way of 'spressing her 
opinion. "Yes," says she, "I can't use a gun but I can tongue 
lash you, and will every chance." Then they all joined in, 
but I found that eating was my best "holt," so they had it 
their own way. When I'd finished my dinner, told them "a la 
Buell," that I thought their house would make an excellent 
hospital, and that we'd probably bring out 80 or a 100 patients 
the next day for them to take care of. Scared them like the 
devil, all but one, and they all knew so much better places 
for the sick. This odd one said she had a way of "putting 
arsenic in some people's feed, and she'd do it, too." Told her 
we'd give her a commish as chief taster, and put her through 
a course of quinine, asafoetida and sich. Said she'd like to see 
us dare to try it, she would. They were too much for me, 
but I'll never pass that place without calling. I'd give my 
shirt to have had Ame Babcock there. Those are the first 
outspoken female seceshers I have yet seen. 

Deserters say that the Rebels have positively no forage or 
provisions in Corinth. That the Memphis and Mobile railways 
can barely bring enough daily, scraped from the whole length 
of the lines to feed the army. It is reported here that Sher- 
man took possession of the Memphis road west of Corinth 



94 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

yesterday and has fortified his position. Pope got two or 
three men killed yesterday. There was about 5,000 of the 
enemy camped in the woods one and one-half miles in front 
of his posish, and he drove them back until they were rein- 
forced and made him scoot again. I was out with a scout 
Sunday and started again last night at dark (Monday) and 
was out until 9 this a. m. The cause was some small bands 

raising the d 1 on our left. We didn't catch them. We 

were over to the Tennessee, Sunday, where we could see the 
sacred soil of Alabama. I like Alabama better than any other 
Southern State. She's never done the "blowing" the others 
have and people here say that she's nearer loyal than any other 
Southern state. They're raising loyal companies here now. 
There are two full in Savannah. 

General Jeff C. Davis' division passed here to-day to join 
Pope's corps. Davis stopped with us and made quite a visit. 
General Ash of this division goes forward to-morrow. The 
2 ist and 38th Illinois from Stules division went out yesterday. 
Eleven regiments in all added to Pope's command in two 
days; except the last two they were all at Pea Ridge and 
some at Wilson's Creek. A splendid lot of men but not 
drilled equal to many regiments of the "Army Miss." 

I don't honestly believe that we have with all our reinforce- 
ments 100,000 men here; but don't believe the Rebels have 
75,000; of course I mean effective men that can be called on 
the field to fight. We have just received orders to move to 
front to-morrow. 

Near Farmington, Miss., May 28, 1862 
We moved up here this morning under the hottest sun 
and over the dustiest roads, and I then helped the major 
lay off the camp, and pitched our tents ourselves. Gra- 
cious, how hot it was! I worked and sweated and blessed 
General Pope for ordering us forward on such a day. I'll 
wager we are the only field and staff that pitch and strike 
our head quarter's tents without the aid of the men. But 
I can't bear the idea of making men who are our equals 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 95 

at home do our work here. Soldiering in the ranks spoils 
a man for acting officer "a-la-regular." We're ordered to 
have our horses saddled by 3 a. m. to-morrow. There 
has been the liveliest kind of cannonading along the whole 
lines to-day. Our whole army advanced about a mile. I 
think that at almost any point on the line we can throw 
shot into their works. Distances vary from one and one- 
half miles to two and a quarter or two and one-half. Many 
of the generals think that to-morrow there will be a general 
fight. They talk a great deal more since the news corre- 
spondents have been sent off; and of course anything of 
that kind, that a brigadier says, goes the rounds of the 
whole camp in real telegraph style. Have heard of a num- 
ber of killings to-day, and haven't heard a tithe of the 
whole. The enemy are beginning to dispute our further 
advance right strongly. Many think that Halleck has com- 
menced a regular siege. He has left a line of splendid de- 
fences to-day, and if he forms new works on the position 
taken up to-day, we will know that we are in for a long 
fight, a-la-Yorktown. Two regiments of cavalry went out 
this morning to destroy the Ohio & Mobile R. R., 30 miles 
south of Corinth. I wish them luck. Many of the Rebel 
shot and shell struck within a half mile of the front of our 
camp to-day. It looks somewhat like the times at Madrid 
and Point Pleasant, but will probably be a little more 
interesting before we finally finish it. 

May 30, 1862. We have our horses saddled all the time 
since 2 130 yesterday morning. Owing to Colonel Kellogg's 
continued illness he was this morning retired from further 
command of brigade, and Mizner put in his place. We could 
hear the cars running at Corinth all last night, and now 
there is a heavy black smoke hanging over the place. Some 
think they have evacuated, but 'tis doubtful. Firing all 
the time since 3 this morning. Up to this time we (our 
regiment) have had but three men killed and nine 
wounded here. Have been remarkably fortunate. I gave 
up my cot to Major Rawalt and am sleeping on the ground 



96 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

now, and the confounded lizards are working me into a 
fever. They are as thick as you ever saw grasshoppers. 
One of them ran into Allan Heald's shirt bosom yesterday 
and they say he moved rather sprightly for a few minutes. 
Lots of snakes here, cottonmouths, copperheads, rattle- 
snakes, and commoner varmint. There's also a scorpion 
that looks like a lizard with a green head. They say it 
is poisonous. 

June 4, 1862. No. 10. 

We've been living out here a week without any tents 
until to-night, and General Pope is ripping and swearing 
because we dared to move them up here without orders. 
He says we shall not move a thing back. The colonel 
I am with is a regular army officer and he shows it all 
over, but I like him very much so far. I won't get to go 
out on near as many scouts, for will only go when the 
whole brigade moves. 

Camp near Boonville, Miss., June 4, 1862. 
Since the evacuation of Corinth we have been pushing 
after them after a fashion. That is follow them until we catch 
up with their rear guard and then retreat three-fourths the 
distance we have advanced. Have been five or six days fol- 
lowing them 25 miles. Yesterday we advanced some 10 miles 
beyond this point, skirmishing with them all the last five miles, 
and then we all returned to camp here. I think we must 
have had 40,000 men out yesterday and yet it was only a re- 
connoisance in force. But what the devil was the use thereof 
I cannot see, for the day previous some of our cavalry was out 
farther than we went. Our regiment had the first skirmish 
with the Rebels after they left Corinth. 'Twas about seven 
miles out of the town. We had two killed and three wounded. 
They were of the Decatur Company. Our boys killed fire of 
them. This is the most masterly retreat yet. They have posi- 
tively left nothing of any value. I don't think they left tents 
enough for one regiment. They left not one cannon. No 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 97 

arms of any value and very few of any kind. We have only 
found one wagon since we passed Corinth, although there 
were a number in the place that they did not need. We 
haven't taken 50 prisoners, although they have lost hundreds, 
maybe thousands, by desertion. There is not the least evi- 
dence that they yere in haste at any point, and just 20 hours 
before we entered Corinth we were ordered to saddle our 
horses and be in perfect readiness for a fight, as it was ex- 
pected that the enemy would attack us before three hours. 
At that time they could not have had more than enough men 
in Corinth to do the required picket duty. They are now, 
or at least a large body of them, in camp within 12 miles of 
us, and the story through the army is they are marching on 
us. Our boys are fairly wild to be on after them But then 
another rumor from a tolerably reliable source, is we are 
going to fall back to Corinth and camp until plans are more 
fully matured. Still another says Pope's army is ordered 
down the Mississippi river again. I hope the last is not so, 
for I have a dread of that river in the summer season. I am 
acting assistant adjutant general for Colonel Mizner, com- 
manding ist Brigade Corps. 

Headquarters ist Brigade Cavalry Division, 

Camp near Boonville, Miss., June 6, 1862. 
I am leading an inglorious life now, nothing to do but the 
brigade writing and ride with the colonel when he goes out 
on business. The only time I am on the fighting list is when 
the brigade goes out, and that is very rarely, and only when 
reconnoisances in force are made, and there is seldom any 
fighting done then. General Hamilton's whole division marched 
by our tent to-day and it was a splendid sight ; I had thought 
that I'd never want to see any more troops but his division 
looked so splendidly, that I really enjoyed the sight of them. 
I knew that they were only marching into a new camp, but 
they all had got the idea that they were going into a fight and 
they were in grand spirits. I never saw the men look as 



98 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

healthy as they do now. One reason is those who were sick 
have been all left at the river and the weakly ones do not 
pretend to march in the ranks this hot weather. We are 
within one hundred yards of General Pope's headquarters and 
there are continually a lot of brigadiers passing. They nearly 
always ride on the gallop, and with the aids and escorts all 
told, say 60 in number to each general, they make quite a 
dashing appearance. Rosecrans, Buell, Granger, Smith, Sher- 
man, T. W., Plummer, Paine, Hamilton and Pope all rode 
by at one time to-day. 

All the companies we have had out to-day report skirmish- 
ing with the enemy We lost two men prisoners, some 
wounded and several horses. Got some prisoners. The enemy 
are in some force six miles from here. They are dodging all 
around us. Rumor says to-day that Buell with his army is 
going down through Alabama to Montgomery. Pope will 
move slowly after the enemy through Mississippi, and Thomas 
will go across to Memphis and down the river to co-operate 
with Butler in a movement through Southern Mississippi. 
'Tis probably the plan of some cuss in the ranks. I wish for 
one day that you could hear all the camp rumors. They would 
make a remarkable book. 

Rienzi, Tishomingo Co., Miss., June 9, 1862. 
Saturday morning the 5th inst. the colonel and myself 
started for a little pleasure ride as a relaxation from the many 
cares and troubles people in this profession are incident to. 
We started for Corinth, as neither of us had yet visited the 
place, and plodded along through dust in air and heat words 
can't tell how oppressive. We stopped at General Rose- 
crans about i p. m. and stayed and dined with him. The 
general was in his most pleasant mood and I thought him 
very engaging and winning in his manner. He told a num- 
ber of amusing stories and 'twas all very pleasant, until some- 
body happened to mention General Fremont's name. General 
Granger was also at the table and the two generals com- 
menced and each tried to outdo the other in yes, reviling the 
"bumble-bee catcher." 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 99 

They changed the subject over the wine and General Rose- 
crans became quite enthusiastic and prophetic in his conviction 
in regard to the war question, settlement thereof, etc. But I 
couldn't see any remarkable difference between him and the 
rest of mankind, and the same remark will apply to all that I 
know of the other generals here. I remember he said that he 
considered "slavery a vile blot on the face of the earth," and 
that unadulterated abolitionism alone was its equal ; but I don't 
claim that the speech showed any remarkable talent. We left 
him swearing at his A. Q. M. and journeyed on. We luckily 
met an old acquaintance of the colonel's, a captain in the ist 
Regular Infantry, and went with him to his quarters for the 
night. All the regimental officers quartered together in a very 
fine house that belongs to a secesh colonel. They were a jolly 
set of men, and the empty bottles lying around loose when we 
retired testified strongly thereto. I remember seeing one of 
them at Point Pleasant, Mo., have a couple of little fights (he 
commanded a two-gun battery of siege pieces) with a 
Rebel battery on the opposite shore. 

We left Corinth early next morning for Farmington, 
and as we passed I saw where Major Applington fell. It was 
as I supposed about one-half mile from Corinth (hardly 
that) and what I did not know, was within 400 yards of the 
strongest part of the Rebel fortifications. We lunched at 10 
a. m and paid an old lady the modest sum of 50 cents for a 
piece of cornbread and a glass of buttermilk. She complained 
bitterly of some of Buell's soldiers killing three of her chick- 
ens without paying for them, and just the day before her hus- 
band had been to Corinth arid received meat, flour, etc., free 
from the aid society. She had three sons in the Southern 
Army. At 12 m. we drew rein 25 miles from Corinth at luka. 

There are a couple of splendid springs in luka. One 
chalybeate, and the other sulphur water, and the town is 
the neatest I have seen in the country. Snuff-dipping is 
an universal custom here, and there are only two women 
in all luka that do not practice it. At tea parties, after 
they have supped, the sticks and snuff are passed round 



IOO ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

and the dipping commences. Sometimes girls ask their 
beaux to take a dip with them during a spark. I asked 
one if it didn't interfere with the old-fashioned habit of 
kissing. She assured me that it did not in the least, and 
I marveled. There was only one regiment at luka, and 
they were expecting an attack from the hordes of guer- 
rillas that infest the country all along our front from Mem- 
phis to Florence. I stayed at the hotel in town and had just 
retired (about n) when crack, crack, two guns went, only 
about 60 rods from the house. There was a general shak- 
ing of the whole building, caused by the sleepers rising 
en masse and bouncing out on the floors. I thought if 
there was no fight I wouldn't be fooled, and if there was 
I couldn't do any good, so I kept cool. 'Twas only a little 
bushwhacking. A soldier policeman having been shot at 
from the brush, and he returned the favor by guess. This 
infantry always thinks the enemy is just out of gunshot 
of them, and they are three-fourths scared to death all the 
time. At noon of Monday we left luka, rode to Burnsville, 
a place that I have spoken of in my letters before, as we 
scouted through it while lying before Corinth. None of 
our soldiers have camped there yet, and we were the only 
ones there while we stayed. The colonel took a nap to 
recover from the heat and fatigue of riding, and I strolled 
down town to look up some acquaintances I made while 
scouting. They treated me pretty well, and made me a 
letter carrier, as many of them had letters to send to their 
friends who are prisoners. At dark we started for Jacinto, 
ten miles south, but for so many hills had a splendid ride. 
'Twas through the woods, all the way, and over real young 
mountains. We got to Jacinto at 10 p. m. and concluded 
to stay all night. I laid down an hour or two, but the 
fleas were so bad that I got up and stayed up the rest of 
the night. I walked around the town and stopped at head- 
quarters of the guard and talked with the boys. (They 
were of Jeff C. Davis's division, of Pea Ridge, Ark., and 
Siegel.) They all think that Siegel is the only man and hate 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. IOI 

Davis like the devil. I waked the colonel at 4 p. m. and 
we started for home. The road from Jacinto, home, was 
lined with infantry, the whole left wing of our corps 
being on it. They had no tents but seemed to be preparing 
the ground for a camp. We got home in time for a little 
nap before breakfast, both of which I enjoyed very much. 
We found the garrison much excited about an attack that 
was expected every hour. The 2d Brigade of Cavalry 
had been about eight miles in front doing outpost duty, 
and having been alarmed by rumors had abandoned their 
camp and retreated to this place. Their sutler gave up 
his goods to the boys, preferring they should have them 
free, rather than the enemy. The next day (yesterday 
morning) a scout was sent out and found their camp just 
as they had left it. All of which was considered quite a 
joke on the 2d Brigade. The enemy may come up here 
and may whip us out, we are scattered so much, but they 
will have a riotous time of it. All told we had a very 
pleasant ride, but if we are gobbled up some of these times 
when riding around without an escort you must not be 
surprised. I don't think it just the straight way of doing 
such business, but Charles can go where the colonel dares 
to, and my preference is for riding as far from a column as 
possible on several accounts. The colonel is a very inter- 
esting companion on such a trip, full of talk, and he has had 
six years experience on the frontier. I induced a very 
young lady with a well cracked piano to favor me with 
some music at luka. She sang "The Bonny Blue Flag 
That Bears a Single Star." It was as near the music we 
used to hear in the old Presbyterian church at home as 
you could think, and that's all that kept me from laughing 
in her face. We celebrated the capture of Richmond on 
the 4th, but are now trying to forget that we made such 
fools of ourselves. Damn the telegraphs. We have awful 
news from Richmond to-day. It would make me sick to 
write it. I would rather have the army whipped than 
McClellan. 



102 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Camp near Boonville, Miss., June 13, 1862. 
This is the fourth camp that we have had to call as above. 
We have lived all around the burg, but to-morrow we leave. 
We have just got nicely arranged here after working hard all 
day, and now an order comes to move brigade headquarters 
back to Rienzi, nearly 10 miles toward Corinth. Bah! how 
sick it makes me to write that name. I haven't seen the place 
yet, and have no desire to. I feel about once a week as though 
a little skirmish would do me good, but I don't see any use 
in getting mad because they won't give me a chance to fight. 
I couldn't feel any more out of the war at home than I do 
here. The enemy have all gone further into Dixie and we're 
left the undisputed occupants of this neck. Our headquarters 
here are about 25 miles south of Corinth, and we have pickets 
at Baldwin, 15 miles south of this. Pope's whole division has 
moved back to just this side of Corinth except our brigade, 
so here we are, maybe 1,200 effective men, doing outpost duty 
nearly 40 miles in advance of the army. Yesterday the colonel, 
his A. D. C. and myself rode around our entire picket line, I 
mean the part of our brigade that is guarding the M. & O. 
R. R. There is only one regiment doing this, and they 
are strung out so that our ride was full 40 miles. When we 
were within two miles of our camp, coming in, I was gallop- 
ing along ahead of the colonel, maybe 50 yards ('twas 10 
p. m.) and I thought I heard a "halt," but was so sure there 
were no pickets there (full a dozen miles inside of our corps' 
pickets) that I didn't mind it until bang, went an old musket, 
and the bullet zipped considerably over my head.,, J halted. 
They were some infantry pickets whose regiment was close 
by in the woods (some two miles). Well, we hadn't the 
countersign and they wern't going to let us pass. The colonel 
swore, I was awful hungry, and I cussed, the A. D. C. raved, 
but the picket sergeant was immovable. At last we coaxed 
him to send us in with a guard to his colonel. He sent six 
men with us as guard, and the cuss gave orders to shoot us 
if we tried to run. The chap that shot was one of the guard, 
'and he told me that he shot over my head on purpose after 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. IO3 

he had halloed "halt" several times. They didn't know there 
was cavalry outside of them and said they'd shot us sure if 
they hadn't seen the glimmer of my straps in the moonlight. 
We got their colonel up, took a toddy with him and home. 
Did I ever tell you about my darkey, "Charley"? We got 
him at Cape Girardeau. He informed our troops where his 
master and company had hidden some 14 kegs of powder and 
some arms. His massa found out he had informed and put 
him in irons four weeks. He escaped and came to us We 
lost him at Madrid and never knew what had become of him 
until he turned up here a week since He had been sick in the 
Cairo hospital. He comes very handy to me when I'm a little 
lazy, which, though, is only 30 or 40 times a day. He has my 
boots blacked and clothes brushed when I get up in the morn- 
ing, is a splendid hand to take care of a horse, and all told a 
very handy institution. He wants me to promise to take him 
home with me. If you will have him, I'll do it. He'd be right 
handy about our house. I have the nicest horse. He is a 
perfect staver. A little tiresome to ride because so anxious 
to go fast, but he is so strong and never tires. After that ride 
yesterday of 40 miles through a broiling sun he danced along 
at the last as much as when we started. We were coming in 
from a reconnoisance one night last week and about 10 p. m., 
dark as Egypt, an artillery wagon crowded me off a causeway 
and Siegel (my horse) went into the mud to his shoulders 
and I, over his head, gracefully. He got out and sloped, and 
I walked into camp. 'Twas only a quarter of a mile. An ar- 
tillery sergeant caught him and I walked out to the road just 
in time to see him passing. He dismounted very spryly. 
Siegel licks my hands just like a dog and he will follow me 
away from his oats any time. After he got away from me 
that night he went back again to where we fell and that's 
where the sergeant got him. He is a large bay and I wouldn't 
take anything for him. I was riding to-day with the colonel, 
and as we crossed the M. and O. R. R. I saw a couple of 
fellows 300 or 400 yards down the road coming towards us, 
and one of them threw up his hands. I thought he was a de- 



104 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

serter and waited. They proved to be what I thought. One 
was an Alabamian and the other from Arkansas. They had 
seen our pickets further out but thought them Confederates 
and slipped by them through the brush. I took them to the 
celonel, and since then, this p. m., nine more have come in, and 
'tis not a very good day for deserters either. These people 
here are very tired of war. You would be if this army should 
march through Canton, indeed you would. You can't go into 
hardly a house here but what they'll ask if you know anything 
of "my son," "my brother," or "my husband" that was taken 
prisoner at this place or that place, and then the poor creatures 
will cry as though their hearts were broken and you begin to 
feel queer about your throat, and I can't stand that at all. 
It hurts me under my vest to see these poor women suffering, 
for maybe not the fault of those they mourn, but of rich men 
and politicians who have by threats and lies induced these 
poor devils to leave their families to die of starvation, to fight 
for, they can't tell what. 

I have just seen a Mobile Register of the 5th. It says they 
have taken at Richmond 7,000 prisoners, 80 pieces artillery, 
wagons, etc., innumerable quartermaster and commissary 
stores in vast quantities. That McClellan is driven back 30 
miles and his army is surrounded, but a few of them may 
escape by James river. Very jocular and highly edifying. 
They also claim 15,000 stands small arms captured. 

Rienzi, Tishomingo Co., Miss., June 14, '62. 

We have located for a somewhat permanent stay, as the 
clumsy order said, in the most beautiful little town I have 
yet found in Mississippi. We have pitched our tents in a 
little grove in the edge of the burgh and are preparing to live. 

We have been rioting on plums and blackberries the last 
week. Dewberries are about gone. I don't think the plums 
are as good as ours. There is already much suffering amongst 
the poor here, and God only knows how these people can live 
until the new crop of corn is harvested. The wheat is all 
cut these ten days, but ten acres of it will hardly keep one 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. IO5 

person a year. Cotton is not planted this year to any extent, a 
tax of $25 per bale being laid on all each man raises over one 
bale. I told you how we rode out to Baldwin on the I2th; well, 
this morning the enemy nearly surrounded our picket there 
and killed or captured a few of them, scattering the rest. They 
have nearly all got in. There are no troops between here and 
the picket at Baldwin, 25 miles, and this little body is 12 miles 
ahead of the main 'army. 'Tis an outrage to post troops in 
this manner, and if they all get cut off (the two battalions on 
picket) it won't surprise me. There are not many slaves here, 
very few planters work more than 25, though 60 miles fur- 
ther down many have from 300 to 400 each. We don't think 
these are large bodies that are troubling oui outposts, but 
they will hover around so long as the picket is advanced thus 
far. 

Rienzi, Tishomingo Co., Miss., June 16, 1862. 
We are camped here enjoying ourselves grandly. As our 
brigade is scattered over a line of 50 miles we just pitch our 
headquarters in the quietest spot we can find independent of 
the command. There are only two companies now out of the 
24 within 8 miles of us, and all we have to do with any of 
them is to send them orders and receive their communications 
and forward them. In the heat of the day we read and 
lounge in our tents, and mornings we go to the creek and 
bathe and then ride a dozen or so miles to keep our horses 
exercised. I have a clerk, too, for my copying, etc., so I'm a 
gentleman. Evenings I visit generally some of the half dozen 
families within a half mile of us of whom I borrow books 
and in return furnish them with occasional papers. We have 
splendid water and my health is perfect. This is the healthiest 
part of the South. 

Rienzi, Tishomingo Co., Miss., June 19, 1862. 
This is one of the few days that remind one of Illinois, 
although there are very few nights that might not remind a 
Greenlander of his home. I think there has not been a night

yet that I have not slept under three blankets, and there have 
been many nights that I would have used a dozen if I had had 
them. The natives say that 'tis the Gulf breeze that makes 
the air so cool after about 7 or 8 p. m. I wish that it would 
get along about eight hours earlier daily ; but to-day there are 
clouds kiting about so o'erhead that the sun don't amount to 
much only for light, and 'tis cool enough to make undercloth- 
ing comfortable. The colonel, A. D. C. and myself visited the 
camp of the 7th Illinois yesterday at Jacinto. We found them 
surrounded with a brush parapet, felled trees, etc., ready as 
they said for a twelve-hour's fight. They'd been visited by a 
scare. There is no enemy within 15 miles of them and hasn't 
been. They are camped in the suburbs of a beautiful little 
town that fell in among the hills in a very tasty manner (for 
a Mississippi town). In one little valley near a fine residence 
there are three springs bubbling up in line and within a foot 
of each other, which are so independent that each furnishes a 
different kind of water. The first pure, cold, soft water with- 
out taste, another chalybeate, and the third, strong sulphur. 
The waters of the three fall into one little basin and run thence 
into a bathhouse twenty steps distant. There is a neat vine 
covered arbor over the springs with seats arranged within, 
and altogether 'tis a neat little place good to water Yankee 
horses at. There were several gangs of negroes at work in 
the corn and cotton fields along the road yesterday, and I 
thanked God they were not in Illinois. Candidly, I'd rather see 
them and a whole crop of grindstones dumped into the Gulf, 
than have so many of them in our State, as there are even here. 
Yet, it don't look square to see the women, if they are niggers, 
plowing. I have no reason for the last sentence, only it isn't 
in my opinion what petticoats were designed for. Talking 
about niggers, these headquarters are fully up with any- 
thing in that Potomac mob on the colored question. They 
got Jeff Davis' coachman. What of it? J. D. isn't anybody 
but a broken-backed-politician-of-a-civilian, and of course his 
coachman is no better than a white man. But we, we have, 
listen, General Beauregard's nigger "toddy mixer," and my 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. IO/ 

experience fully proves to the satisfaction of your brother that 
the general's taste in selecting a toddy artist is fine. He is 
a sharp cuss (the nigger). He left them at Tupelo day before 
yesterday, p. m., slipped by the pickets while 'twas light with- 
out their seeing him, but after dark he was suddenly halted 
by their videttes when within ten feet of them. He ran by 
them and they fired, but as usual missed. He is really the ser- 
vant of Colonel Clough, of Memphis, but the colonel is now on 
Beauregard's staff , and John (the boy) was selected as drink 
mixer for the general-pro tem. He reports that Price started 
with the flower of the flock, only some 3,000 posies, to Virginia, 
but said posies, like their vegetable brethren, wilt and droop 
by the wayside, and unlike them, scoot off through the brush 
at every chance, and that is the last of them as far as soldier- 
ing is concerned. Hundreds of the dissatisfied Rebels pre- 
tended sickness and lay by the roadside until the army passed 
and then heeled it for home. All the prisoners and deserters 
that we get concur in saying that at least 10,000 have de- 
serted since the evacuation. A couple of very fine-looking young 
fellows, Kentuckians, came in this p. m. Their regiment with 
two others are the outpost guard between the Rebel Army and 
ours. They were in a skirmish the other day at Baldwin, 
where two of our companies were surprised and lost six men, 
taken prisoners. There were 60 of our boys and they reported 
400 Rebels. These deserters say there were only 42 Rebels; 
but the next day 700 Rebels came onto 75 of our men and 
the chivalry were put to flight in a perfect rout. So it goes. 
There was a flag of truce came in last night to our picket. 
Brought a dozen packages for Halleck and company, with a 
number of letters for Northern friends, all unsealed. Several 
of the envelopes were of common brown wrapping paper. 
There are a good many things about this advance of an army 
that are more interesting than the main army the infants know 
of. We cavalry feel as safe here as in Illinois, but General 
Ashboth keeps calling on Pope for more men all the time. 

What do you think we'll have to eat to-morrow? Answer: 
Lamb, roast goose and liver (beef), blackberry pies, plum 



108 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

pudding, new peas, string beans, onions, beets, fresh apple 
sauce, etc. That's a fact, and we have a cow that furnishes 
us milk, too, and a coop full of chickens, maccaroni for our 
soup, and we get all the beef brains. 

Tell Colonel Kellogg that the boys are talking about him 
yet, like a lot of chickens for their lost "Mar." The 7th has 
plenty to do now, if I wasn't so tired I'd write you a copy of 
the orders I sent them to-day. 

The enemy keeps annoying our outposts, and rumors come 
to-day of their being on the way for this place to surprise us. 
All bosh, I suppose. I hope they are too gentlemanly to dis- 
turb us while we are doing as well as we are here. It would 
be worse than the old lady where I stayed night before last. 
I went to bed at 12 :3O, and about 5 she sent a servant up for 
the sheets to wash. The joke was on our family, but I told her 
that ~ she had better let me roll over the whole house if she 
had to wash up after me, for it would improve the health of her 
family to scrub the premises and them. Fine people, here. 
They've commenced bushwhacking. One of my orderlies was 
shot through the thigh night before last while carrying some 
dispatches. "Concilate," "noble people," "high spirited." Oh ! 
Strangulate is the better direction. 

Headquarters 1st Brig. Cav. Army of the Miss., 

Rienzi, Miss., June 29, 1862. 

What the deuce this army is trying to do, I cannot guess. 
Buell's corps moved off in an easterly direction two weeks 
since. Grant's is, I think, between Corinth and Memphis, and 
the headquarters of Pope is about four miles south of Corinth, 
while his army is scattered for 75 miles west of here. The left 
wing, Plummer's and Jeff C. Davis' divisions moved through 
here yesterday, bound for Holly Springs, 60 miles due west. 
General Ashboth's reserve division, stationed here, have thrown 
up quite extensive works, fronting the enemy, who are not in 
any force, within 75 miles of us. Our cavalry division is do- 
ing the outpost duty on a line 40 miles long, running east and 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. ICK) 

west, and about 20 miles south of Corinth, with videttes out 
eight or ten miles further, and scouting parties go 15 miles 
below the videttes. We are losing about two men a day 
skirmishing. I noticed a statement in the papers that 20,000 
new-made graves could be seen between Corinth and the 
Tennessees, caused by the swamp miasmas, etc., during our 
approaching the enemy. We don't believe that there have been 
400 deaths from disease since the battle of Shiloh, and 250 
will cover the number of deaths from wounds received since 
that fight. You know there have been an immense number of 
sick men furloughed, but that was to satisfy the State govern- 
nors more than necessity. For instance, John Shriner went 
home on sick furlough and you know his condition. There 
were thousands of such cases. I think the health of our army 
never was better than now. I notice that our Illinois troops 
stand this climate very much better than the men from Michi- 
gan and Iowa. Do not think we have more than one-third 
the sickness in our regiment that the troops from the last 
named States have. There is a prospect of our brigade's being 
ordered to Ripley this week. I am well satisfied here, but have 
no doubt will flourish equally well there. They charge out- 
rageous prices for eatables throughout the country. Half- 
grown chickens 25 cents each, eggs 25 cents per dozen, but- 
termilk 20 cents per quart, etc. We keep a cow for our head- 
quarters, though, that supplies us with milk, and we have six 
hens that lay as many eggs every day, and my colored boy 
plays sharp and buys new potatoes, peas, beans, etc., for half 
what I can, on the strength of his chumming it with colored 
folks of the farms. There was a regiment raised in this 
country that are now flourishing in Camp Douglas. A lady 
played the piano and sang for me last night that has a husband 
and brother residing in said camp. Mourning goods are quite 
fashionable here, and I see limping around town several tfiat 
lost a limb, each, in some of the early battles. There are a 
few that I have met who were taken prisoners by our troops, 
one of them at Manassas, and paroled. Deserters come in 
yet every day. An intelligent man that belonged to an Arkan- 



IIO ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

sas regiment came in yesterday. He says that he thinks the 
main body of the Southern Army started for East Tennessee, 
via Chattanooga the day after he left them. Breckenridge's 
brigade has gone to Vicksburg, etc. I would like to send you 
some of the late orders issued by Rosecrans, if it were not 
so much trouble to copy them, in relation to police of camp 
and discipline. He looks after the health of men more than 
any general I have served under 

People here are very indignant about our taking all their 
provisions away from them, and then appealing to the North 
to contribute to keep them from starving. There is some truth 
in the idea, but not much. They certainly do need eatables 
here, and the North will have to furnish them free or take 
scrip. Dinner: Blackberry jam, pie and raw berries. Oceans 
of them here. Day before yesterday the Rebels surprised one 
of our picket parties and captured 1st and C men, and yes- 
terday they captured another. But Company K (Nelson's) 
followed them 12 or 15 miles and I think got the prisoners 
back with one Rebel, several horses and lots of traps. I got 
a letter from you a few days since relating the affecting parting 
scene between those spirits who left home, etc., for three 
months, and the sweet spirits that wept so heart breakingly 
thereat. I think your ideas were not unsound in regard 
to the parting scenes, and if you had boxed a few ears and 
pulled a little hair belonging to the ninnies that so abused the 
noble art of crying that day, you would have been excusable 
in my eyes. I must take a nap as quick as my boy comes back 
to keep the flies away. 

II p. m., SQth. There is talk among the officers that Buell 
with 60,000 men is en route for Atlanta, Ga., intending to 
occupy that city, and thus cut off connection between the 
eastern and western portions of the Rebel Army. It will be 
a bold strike and looks safe ; but it seems to me, from a glance 
at the map, that the occupation of Montgomery, Ala. would 
more effectually accomplish that end, for then there would be 
no railroad line open to the Rebels (we holding the Memphis 
and Charleston) while there are two lines running east from 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. Ill 

Montgomery, only one of which a force at Atlanta could cover. 
A deserter came in this evening who says that they are organiz- 
ing the army at Tupelo, mustering the men as five years' regu- 
lars, with promises of furloughs until this war is over. That 
England and France have decided that the Southern States 
shall all have a chance at the ballot box, and must, within 60 
days, say whether they will cleave to the Government of the 
United States or be independent; if the latter, those govern- 
ments will sustain them and thus end the war, and if the for- 
mer, the war will be ended accordingly. So they are organiz- 
ing a regular army upon the supposition that they will be an 
independent confederacy. The above shows they are able to 
start as huge a lie in their camps as we can in ours. I wouldn't 
have believed it before. 

The colonel, A. D. C. and myself took tea with General 
Ashboth this evening. He is such a pleasant man. Has a 
great liking for pets. He has a tremendous large dog, who 
lays his head on the table right by the general's plate during 
meal time, and he gets his share at the first table. On 
the other side of him two little Indian ponies range themselves 
as quick as he sits down, and he lays biscuits on the corner 
of the table for them, which they gobble with the greatest 
relish. He spreads biscuits for one pony with sugar, and with 
salt for the other. His conversation is divided about equally 
between his ponies, the dog, and his other guests. The ponies 
he got in Arkansas, and they are the prettiest little fellows 
imaginable. The general is one of the most polite and kind 
men I ever saw. His troops all love him. He carries his right 
arm in a sling yet from a wound received at Elkhorn. 

If you'd multiply all the bugs, say by 10,000, you'd have 
something near the number that visit me nightly. They are 
of all sizes less than a door knob, and the shapes and colors are 
innumerable. When they're bumping against you by candle 
light, if you were not acclimated, you would swear someone 
was brickbatting you. 

We could overrun the whole West and Southwest as fast 
as we could travel, with the army we had here, if it were

policy. Vicksburg cannot stand two hours when attacked. 
But it has leaked out at headquarters that we are letting 
them think they are holding us in check, so that they will 
keep all their forces in the West until after the big fight 
at Richmond. I have heard from Captain Nelson that Sammy 
Nutt distinguished himself in the skirmish yesterday. He 
captured that prisoner I spoke of. Captain says Sam was the 
head man in the chase and that no man ever behaved bet- 
ter. Sam's pistol went off accidentally after he had captured 
the secesh and the bullet came within half an inch of knocking 
a hole in the Rebel's head. The boys all give Sam a great deal 
of praise. 'Twas daring of the captain to run his handful 
of men almost into the enemy's camp, and 25 miles from any 
support ; but if any company can do it, Company K can. Cap- 
tain Nelson looks well but grumbles at being brought back from 
the front to where there is nothing to do but rest. His men 
feel the same way. For my part I don't consider myself in the 
war here any more than I would be in Canton.

General Orders No. 92 : 

For the information of all in the command, the following 
explanations are given, in reference to the rights and duties of 
citizens of the States in which we may be stationed. 



1 14 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

1. All citizens of the States claiming the rights, and 
holding themselves bound to the duties of citizens of the 
United States are entitled to the same protection of person 
and property, which we claim for ourselves. 

2. We hold citizens to the performance of active duties, 
only when they receive protection; if left without protec- 
tion, they are bound only to good will and abstinence 
from all acts of hostility to the Government. 

3. Persons denying that they are citizens of the United 
States, repudiating the duties of citizens, by words or 
actions, are entitled to no rights, save those which the laws 
of war and humanity accord to their characters. 

If they claim to belong to a hostile government, they 
have the rights of belligerents, and can neither justly claim, 
nor have anything more from the army. If they are found 
making war, without lawful organization or commission, 
they are enemies of mankind, and have the rights due to 
pirates and robbers, which it will be a duty to accord them. 

It is not our purpose to admit the slaves of loyal masters 
within our lines, or use them without compensation, or 
prevent their recovery, when consistent with the interest 
of the service. 

The slaves of our enemies may come or go wherever 
they please, provided they do not interfere with the rules 
and orders of camp and dicipline. They deserve more at 
our hands than their masters. 

By order of General ROSECRANS,

Brig. Gen'l. and Chief of Staff.

Camp at Rienzi, July 17, 1862. 

I think there is more point and policy in that General Order 
92 than in any one that has yet been issued in the West, or 
East either for that matter ; but still I do not think it remark- 
able for perspicuity, and it is neither as strong nor as definite 
as the army demands. If I know anything of the "laws of war 
and humanity," the soldiers will bless "92" for one thing, its 
relieving them from guarding the property of secessionists, 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 115 

and if they don't make sundry potato patches, cabbage gardens 
and fields of roasting ears that I know of, "hop" 'twill surprise 
me much. There will be some wondrous sudden conversions 
to Unionism when these butternuts get the drift of that order. 
An old pup in this town that drank "Southern Independence or 
the World in Flames" the other evening, in the presence of 
several United States officers has Union soldiers guarding his 
property, to preserve it from the Northern vandals, and he has 
used language equally insulting, times without number, yet 
the guard is kept up. I suppose, to conciliate him. General 
Ashboth visits all the secesh and rides around town with the 
daughter of the man I've been speaking of, who is more in- 
tensely secesh than her father, if that is possible. Maybe I'm 
jealous of him, for the girl is very handsome, but I don't think 
a United States general at all excusable in such conduct, 
though it may be overlooked in a lieutenant. Did you see Beau- 
regard's answer to Halleck? I honestly think there is more 
truth in that document, than in any other military paper of 
the kind I have seen. Suppose you have seen Granger's re- 
view thereof. You notice he don't touch any of the principal 
points and shows his whole object in publishing the article, 
in these four words, "I led the pursuit." I'll swear we haven't 
taken, in deserters, prisoners and sick, since the evacuation of 
Corinth, 500 men (although hundreds have doubtless deserted 
who did not enter our lines.) I know this because we have had 
the advance all the time, and on the only roads there have been 
fighting and prisoners, and all the deserters have passed 
through our hands. There were about 18 cars burned, but the 
ruins show there was nothing of much value on them. 'Twas 
not intentional, of course, but Elliott did burn several men in 
the depot, or else the people of Boonville are liars, to a man. 
That fight the other day at Boonville amounted to nothing. 
The enemy's official report of their loss is four killed and ten 
wounded. There is an awful sight of bombast and lying about 
army reports. Beat politicians all hollow. We have had very 
heavy rains for the last 36 hours, and as water can now be pro- 
cured on the hitherto dry ground between the armies, I expect 



Il6 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

some cavalry skirmishing, at least, and if the enemy is yet in 
force at Tupelo, now is the time for them to attack us, for 
our army is scattered for 300 miles, almost along the Tennes- 
see line, and cannot be concentrated in time to resist a large 
force. Many of the officers expect a big fight, but your brother 
don't. 

July 19, 1862. 

I don't know whether I have any business sending such a 
document as I enclose, but guess its no difference. Two spies 
came in to-night and report that there are not more than 15,000 
or 20,000 of the enemy left at Tupelo and Saltillo. Bragg took 
a large force with him and went over in the direction of Chat- 
tanooga a few days since. A fortnight, nearer a month, since 
we had quite a large force stationed at Boonville. One of the 
men started to go back to Rienzi on business, and had not been 
heard of since until day before yesterday, when his body was 
found midway between the two places with four bullet holes 
through it. It lay some distance from the road, and was dis- 
covered by a man of the 2d Brigade while looking for water. 
He was undoubtedly murdered by some citizen. Day before 
yesterday Mrs. Pierce, wife of a captain in the 36th Illinois, 
rode out in an ambulance, escorted by a corporal, to get some 
fruit in the country. A party of guerrillas gobbled the party 
up while they were inside of our pickets, and took them to 
Ripley. They sent Mrs. Pierce back yesterday. She was well 
treated. I guess there are no hopes of a fight there until au- 
tumn. I'm getting tired of doing nothing, although I certainly 
should be satisfied, having easier times than almost any one in 
the service. 

Halleck left here yesterday for Washington. Trains are 
running down here from Corinth every day now, so we are only 
three days Behind the dates of papers received, which is better 
than eight or ten, as heretofore. We have had the most 
splendid rains for a few days, and the weather is very season- 
able in temperature. We are living almost wholly on fruit: 
apples, pears and blackberries, fresh, and peaches and straw- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 1 1/ 

berries canned. Don't want for anything, but I still (so un- 
reasonable is man) at times, think that I'm not enjoying my- 
self as well as I used to in the 8th. I know I couldn't stay 
out of the service while the war continues, but I would like 
so well to have peace once more, and be civilized awhile. 
There's a good time coming. Don't it come slowly? I write 
all the colonel's letters now except those to his wife, and 
shouldn't wonder if he'd have me do that next. At first he 
used to read them over very closely, but now he often signs 
without asking what they are about. To-night he told me was 
going to make me inspector general for brigade. Making two 
generals out of one lieutenant isn't fair. I'm too lazy and 
modest for such a position and think I can coax him to appoint 
a chap I have my eye upon. 

Headquarters, 1st Brigade Cavalry Division, 

Tuscumbia, Ala., July 27, 1862 (Sunday). 
We received orders for our brigade to march on the iQth, 
and started the 2ist. We only made Jacinto that night, when 
the colonel and myself stayed with Gen. Jeff. C. Davis, who is 
a very approachable, pleasant and perfectly soldier-like man. 
There is a strong sprinkling in him, though, of the Regular 
Army and West Point. Next day we rejoined the command 
and marched 15 miles, camped at Bear Creek, 22 miles west of 
this place and just on the Mississippi and Alabama line. Thurs- 
day we joined General Morgan's division and that night the 
brigade camped within four miles of Tuscumbia, and the 
headquarters came on into town. This is a perfect little Eden. 
Houses for 2,200 people with only 1,200 living here at present. 
We stayed at the hotel Thursday night, and the old negro who 
lighted me to my room amused me considerably with his ac- 
count of General Turchin's proceedings here. Turchin brought 
the first federal force across the Tennessee in Alabama, and I 
guess he "went it loosely." The old Negro said that he only 
had 1,200 men and brought no luggage, knapsacks or anything 
else with him, but went away with 300 wagons, and everything 



Il8 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

there was in the country worth taking. That his men made 
the white women (wouldn't let the colored women) do their 
cooking and washing, and that although they only brought one 
suit of clothes, they put on a new one every morning and al- 
ways looked as though they had just stepped from a bandbox. 
People here hate General Mitchell's whole command as they 

do the d 1, and many of them more. Well, we've settled 

once more, and I'll be contented if allowed to stay here for 
sometime. We're guarding about 100 miles of railroad from 
luka to Decatur, and it promises to be preity rough work. Day 
before yesterday a guerilla party swooped down on a station 
24 miles east of here where General Thomas had 160 men and 
captured all but 20 of them. We are relieving General Thomas' 
command from duty here, but the Rebels saved us the trouble 
of relieving that party. We sent out a force yesterday of three 
companies and the Rebels surprised and killed and captured 
20 of them. I have just heard that there has been a fight eight 
miles south of here to-day, between our cavalry and the Rebels, 
no particulars yet. 'Tis the 3d Michigan that has suffered so 
far. The 7th Illinois are out now after the party that surprised 
the Michiganders yesterday, but have not heard of them since 
they started yesterday p. m. We are quartered in the house 
of a right good secesh, and are enjoying his property hugely. 
His pigs will be ripe within a week, and we'll guard them after 
our style. The old fashion is played out as far as this brigade 
is concerned. We take what is necessary and give vouchers, 
which say the property will be paid for at the close of the war, 
on proof of loyalty. This valley is 60 or 80 miles long, 15 
miles wide and the most beautiful country imaginable. It is now 
one vast cornfield. The residences in this town are superb, and 
the grounds most beautifully ornamented and filled with shrub- 
bery. There is a spring here that throws out 17,000 cubic feet 
of water each minute. It supplies the town. General Thomas, 
whom we relieved, has gone to Huntsville to join Buell. I 
think they are going to Chattanooga then. People are intensely 
secesh here, and whine most mournfully when compelled to 
take the oath, or even to give their parole of honor not to give 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. IIQ 

information to the enemy. Our headquarters is a mile from 
any troops, just for the quiet of the thing. Peaches are just 
in season now, and there are oceans of them here. Blackber- 
ries are still to be found, and we have plenty of apples. 

The weather is beautiful, not too warm and still require my 
double blanket every night, and often cool at that. We have 
information that Hardee with a force is marching on this 
place, and it is the most probable rumor that I have heard 
since the evacuation. Time will tell. 

Tuscumbia, Ala., August 3, 1862. 

In the last 15 days I have only written you once ; partly be- 
cause I have been so busy, more, because of my laziness. 
There is but little save rumors that can be of any interest 
to you from here, and shall not inflict any of them on you, 
for the newspapers have certainly surfeited everyone's taste for 
that article. All this blowing and howling we have in the pa- 
pers of raids everywhere, and overwhelming forces of the 
enemy confronting us at all points, is, I candidly believe, part 
of the plan to raise volunteers. It certainly is one grand hum- 
bug as far as this field is concerned. Every officer here that 
knows anything about the condition of the enemy, their posi- 
tions and numbers, believes that if our army were concen- 
trated and set at the work, we could clear out all the enemy 
south of this and west of Georgia in a short two months. 
The soldiers are all anxious to begin, all tired of inaction, 
all clamoring for the war to be ended by a vigorous campaign, 
we running our chances of being whipped by the enemy, 
instead of waiting until next spring, and then being forced by 
bankruptcy to abandon our work. The way we are scattered 
in this country now the enemy can take 1,000 or 2,000 of 
us just any morning they may feel so disposed, and their not 
doing it lowers them wonderfully in my opinion. There are about 
6,000 of us stationed at nine points along 75 miles of railroad, 
and there is no point that 4,000 men could not reach and attack, 
and take before assistance could be afforded. But the Rebels 
don't show any more dash or spirit than we do, so we all rest 



I2O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

perfectly easy in our weakness, confiding in their lack of vim, 
which we gauge by our own. A line drawn through Fulton, 
Miss., Warrenton, Ala. and thence to Rome, Ga. (at which 
last place we think the enemy are concentrating) will give you 
the route over which the enemy are now moving in considera- 
ble bodies, while whole brigades of their numerous cavalry 
pass nearer us, through Newburg, Moulton and Somerville, 
Ala. T would be so easy for them to detach a division and 
send it up to this line of road. Buell, with a very respectable 
force, is near Stephenson in northeastern Alabama moving so 
slowly that no one can tell in which direction. I wish they'd 
give Grant the full control of the strings. He would be sure 
to have somebody whipped, and I'd rather 'twould be us than 
live much longer in this inactivity. People are most outra- 
geously secesh here, generally, although there are said to be 
some settlements very Union. I saw two men yesterday who 
were raising the ist Union Alabama Regiment. They have 
two full companies they say, but I'll never believe it until I 
see the men in blue jackets. This is the most beautiful vaHey 
that I ever saw. It lies between the Tennessee river and a 
spur of the Cumberland mountains, which are craggy and 
rough, and rocky enough to disgust an Illinoisan after a very 
short ride over and among them. Howwever, they form a 
beautiful background for the valley, and are very valuable in 
their hiding places for the guerrillas who infest them, and 
sally out every night to maraud, interfere with our manage- 
ment of this railroad and to impress what few able bodied 
butternuts there are left in their homes. They either cut the 
wires or tear up a little road track for us every night. We have 
guards too strong for them at every culvert, bridge and trestle. 
This country was entirely out of gold and silver until our cotton 
buyers came in with the army, and every man of money had 
his little 5-cent, 5o-cent, etc., notes of his own for change. 
Mitchell's men counterfeited some of them and passed thou- 
sands of dollars of their bogus on the natives. I send you a 
couple of samples of what is known here as Mitchell money. 
The man I got these of had been fooled with over $20 of it. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 121 

The boys couldn't get the proper vignette so, as you will ob- 
serve, they used advertising cuts of cabinet warehouses and 
restaurants. Many of our men have passed Mustang Liniment 
advertisements on the people, and anything of the kind is 
eagerly taken if you tell them it is their money; of course I 
refer to the poor country people, who, if they can read, don't 
show their learning. This man with $20, like that which I 
send you, is a sharp, shrewd-looking hotel keeper. His house 
is larger than the "Peoria House." General Morgan, who is in 
command of the infantry here, is a fine man, but lacks vim 
or something else. He isn't at all positive or energetic. The 
weather still continues delightful. I have'nt used any linen 
clothing yet, although I believe there is some in my trunk. 
We ride down to the Tennessee river every night and bathe, 
and 'tis so delightful. I don't believe anybody ever had a nicer 
place than I have, or less reason to be dissatisfied. Well, I 
do enjoy it ; but don't think I'd worry one minute if sent back 
to my regiment or further back to my old place in the 8th. 
I believe I have the happy faculty of accommodating myself 
to cirumstances, and of grumbling at and enjoying every- 
thing as it comes. I am still desperately "out" with these 
secesh, but borrow books from them to while away my spare 
time. These people, safe in the knowledge of our conciliatory 
principles, talk their seceshism as boldly as they do in Rich- 
mond. Many of our officers have given up all hope of our 
conquering them and really wish for peace. For myself, I 
know its a huge thing we have on our hands, but I believe I'd 
rather see the whole country red with blood, and ruined to- 
gether than have this 7,000,000 of invalids (these Southerners 
are nothing else as a people) conquer, or successfully resist 
the power of the North. I hate them now, as they hate us. 
I have no idea that we'll ever be one nation, even if we con- 
quer their armies. The feeling is too deep on both sides, for 
anything but extermination of one or the other of the two 
parties to cure, and of the two, think the world and civiliza- 
tion will lose the least by losing the South and slavery. 



122 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Tuscumbia, Ala., August 7, 1862. 

The enemy is reported nearer us than usual to-night, and in 
considerable force. Have no idea they intend fighting us 
here though. This has been the hottest day of the summer, 
and I've been in the sun all day with thick woolen clothes on, 
wool shirts, too. I started for Decatur about 7 this morning 
and got back at 5 p. m. All platform cars, no possible chance 
for shade. I rode on the cowcather going out, and on the 
tender, which was ahead, coming back. We got within ten 
miles of Decatur when we came to two bridges burned last 
night, and had to come back. There is not a bridge or cul- 
vert on this road as far as our brigade guards it, that has not 
been burned, at least once, and many of the cattle guards even 
have been burned. They don't fire on the trains though in this 
country, which is some little consolation to the traveler. Since 
we have been guarding the road, some two weeks, they have 
burned in our district four bridges, one water tank, and two 
station houses, and torn up rails several times. All this work 
is done in the night. The tank and stations were of no use to 
us and the bridges we can build about as fast as they can burn 
them, tearing down secesh houses to find the timbers ready 
hewn. There are some grand plantations along the line I 
have traveled to-day. Thousands of acres in some of them 
with from 50 to 250 hands, each. The negroes are under no 
restraint whatever, now. Don't half work, their masters say, 
About 40 negro women who were clearing a piece of wood- 
land dropped their axes and picks and came out to the road as 
the train passed. They were by odds the most antic and amus- 
ing lot of slaves I have yet seen. So clumsily ludicrous, with 
their close-curled wool, great white and black eyes, and heavy- 
ended motions. Some wore sun bonnets, some men's old hats, 
but most were bareheaded. The negro women all wear 
handkerchiefs (I -think they are), turban fashion, while in- 
doors, and sun bonnets, or go bareheaded, when out. They 
seem to be all dressed alike, in very ragged, shabby, thick, cot- 
ton stuff, which is either white or yellow. I have never seen 
one of these dresses clean enough to tell which. I have seen 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 123 

but two negroes yet that have marks of severe punishment. 
They were man and wife, and belong to a planter living 12 
miles from here. The man I think is made a cripple for life 
from blows by a club on his ankles and knees, the woman is 
badly cut on the arms and shoulders, as with a horsewhip, 
but she's all right yet. How a man can be fool enough to so 
abuse such valuable property as this is more than I can under- 
stand. You have no idea to what an extent the habit of dip- 
ping is carried here. I have, while talking to women who really 
had in every way the appearance of being ladies, seen them spit 
tobacco juice, and chew their dipping sticks, perfectly at ease. 
I don't think it common to do it so openly, but I have seen 
two ladies, and any number of common women, engaged in 
the delightful pastime. Colonel Kellogg seems to think that 
I will be mustered out in a short time. I'll promise you one 
thing, that if I am, I'll not enlist again until the policy of this 
war changes, and in actions as well as words, too. J. Pope is 
disgusting me with him very rapidly. John is a horrid blower 
of his own horn. If he don't astonish this country, after all 
of his blowing, the country will astonish him to his entire 
dissatisfaction before he's many months older. Oh! if Grant 
will only go to work and get somebody whipped, or if he'd 
retreat, that would be better than doing nothing, though not 
as good as advancing. 

Tuscumbia, Ala., August 8, 1862. 

My pet negro got so lazy and worthless I was com- 
pelled to ship him. I'll take back, if you please, everything 
good that I ever said of free negroes. That Beauregard 
nigger was such a thief that we had to also set him adrift. 
He stole our canned fruit, jellies and oysters and sold some 
of them and gave parties at the cabins in the vicinity. 
This was barely endurable but he was a splendid, smart 
fellow and the colonel would have kept him, but he got to 
stealing the colonel's liquor. That of course, was unpar- 
donable, when the scarcity of the article was considered. 
In my last I spoke of a ride on the railroad and having to 



124 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

turn back on account of bridges being burned There were, 
maybe, 150 sick soldiers on board, and they concluded to 
march to Decatur, only 10 miles. They were attacked 
just after we started back, five of them killed and about 
100 taken prisoners. There was a woman along and she 
was wounded. There were three little fights yesterday 
between here and 25 miles east. In all, four killed and 13 
wounded. The fight first spoken of was day before yester- 
day. Orders have been given us to put every woman and 
child (imprison the men) across the line that speaks or 
acts secesh, and to burn their property, and to destroy all 
their crops, cut down corn growing, and burn all the cribs. 
That is something like war. 'Tis devilish hard for one like 
me to assist in such work, but believe it is necessary to 
our course. Having been very busy preparing reports and 
writing letters all day, feel deuced little like writing you. 
People here treat us the very best kind, although they are 
as strong Rebels as live. Bring us peaches and vegetables 
every day. I can't hardly think the generals will carry 
out the orders as above, for it will have a very demoraliz- 
ing effect upon the men. I'd hate like the deuce to burn 
the houses of some secesh I know here, but at the same 
time don't doubt the justice of the thing. One of them has 
lent us his own cook, or rather his wife did ; and they don't 
talk their secessiomsm to you unless you ask them to. 
We are getting a good many recruits from this country. 
All poor people, in fact that is the only kind that pretend 
to any Unionism here. There are now three full companies 
of Alabamians (Union) at Huntsville, and many more 
coming in. It is the opinion of the court that this new law, 
a copy of which you sent me, will boost me out of the 
service. I will make no objection, although would rather 
stay in if I thought the war would last 30 or 40 years. Don't 
see how the boys can stay at home under the pressure. A 
young man here, and a splendid fellow, if he is a Rebel, 
showed me four letters from different young ladies urging 
him, by ridicule and appeals to his pride to go into the 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 12$ 

army. He was in for a short time, and was stationed at 
Fort Morgan. Business keeps him out now crops, etc. 
I think will arrange things so that he can leave, if we carry 
out orders. 'Twould be quite a change for me to be out 
of the army now. I don' know how I would relish it while 
the war continues, although am sure could stand it if peace 
times would come again. 

Tuscumbia, Ala., August 14, 1862. 

Things are progressing here swimmingly. Seldom have 
more than two bridges burned in the same night, or lose 
more than five or six men in one day. Scared a little though, 
now. The 7th went down yesterday through Moulton, 
where they were encamped but a few days since, and 
gained us the information that they had evacuated that 
post. People here are considerably scared about the free 
and easy way we are gobbling up their little all. We are 
raking in about 100 bales of cotton per day and could get 
more if we had the transportation. It makes the chivalry 
howl, which is glorious music in our ears, and the idea of 
considering these confederacies something else than erring 
brothers is very refreshing. But I can't talk the thing over 
with them with any pleasure, for they all pretend so much 
candor and honesty in their intentions, and declare so 
cheerfully, and (the women) prettily, that they will do- 
nothing opposed to our interest, and express so much hor- 
ror and detestation of guerrillas and marauders of all 
kinds, that one can't wish to do them any harm or take 
and destroy their property. But the murders of Bob Mc- 
Cook, a dozen of men in this command, and hundreds in 
the army, all tend to disipate such soft sentiments, for we 
are satisfied that citizens do ten-elevenths of such work; 
and nothing less than the removal of every citizen beyond 
our lines, or to north of the Ohio river, will satisfy us. We 
are all rejoicing that "Abe" refuses to accept the negroes 
as soldiers. Aside from the immense disaffection it would 
create in our army, the South would arm and put in the 
field three negroes to our one. Am satisfied she could do-

it. The Tribune couldn't publish those articles in the army 
and keep a whole press one day. Hundreds of the officers 
who are emancipationists, as I am, if the brutes could be 
shipped out of the country would resign if the Tribune's 
policy were adopted. Within an hour some rebellious 
cusses have set fire to a pile of some 200 bales of cotton, 
and the thick white smoke is booming up above the trees 
in plain sight from where I sit. I think 'tis on the Russell- 
ville road, and about eight or nine miles out. Our cavalry 
were through there yesterday and this morning. How glo- 
riously the people are waking up again in the North. 
Should think from the papers that the excitement must 
be higher than ever. A man that doft't know when he is 
well off, or enough to keep a good thing when he has his 
fingers on it, deserves what? "Nothing!" I believe you are 
right; yet such is my miserable condition. Not one officer 
in a thousand in the army has as pleasant a place as your 
brother, and yet here I am ready to go at the first chance, 
and into an uncertainty, too. Colonel Mizner has assured 
me that I suit him, and that if he is made brigadier he will 
promote me. Where I am oing there is no chance for 
promotion unless Brigadier General Oglesby is appointed 
major general. Think I will have a better chance to work 
with Governor Yates, too, and then probably to not more 
than a captaincy. But I have decided to go, though I am 
anything but anxious about the matter. Any of the three 
places are good enough. I see by the papers that a scouting 
party from Cape Girardeau went through to Madison, Ark. 
to Helena, or Memphis rather. I wish I were over there. 
What delightful breezes we have here. Believe me, it's all 
gumption about this being a hot climate. These weak 
kneed, billious-looking citizens, (so because they are too 
lazy to exercise their bones) puff and pant with their linen 
clothes, so thin you can see their dirty skins, almost, and 
we all wear our thick winter clothes, and at that feel the 
heat less than we ever did North. Such loves of nights, 
so everything that's nice ; and invariably so cool that blan- 
kets are necessary after midnight.

Tuscumbia, Ala., August 19, 1862. 

'Tis the old, old, story, burning railroad bridges, skirmish- 
ing between our scouts and theirs, etc. They opened on a new 
program by firing into a train, two days since, wounding five 
men only, though they put 200 shots into the engine and cars. 
They are burning cotton in very good style. Night before 
last eight fires were visible from our headquarters, and last 
night four. They destroyed about $300,000 in the two nights. 
They're getting scared about their negroes, and are carrying 
them off to the mountains as fast as possible. The blacks 
are scrambling in this direction to a very lively tune. Over 
100 came in on one road within the last 24 hours. About 50 
can be used in a regiment to advantage, but I am thoroughly 
opposed to receiving any more than we have work for within 
our lines. You have no idea what a miserable, horrible-look- 
ing, degraded set of brutes these plantation hands are. Con- 
tempt and disgust only half express one's feelings toward any 
man that will prate about the civilizing and christianizing in- 
fluence of slavery. The most savage, copper savage, cannot 
be below these field hands in any brute quality. Let them keep 
their negroes though, for we surely don't want our Northern 
States degraded by them, and they can't do the Southerners 
any good after we get them driven a few degrees further 
down. These nigs that come in now, say that their masters 
were going to put them in the Southern Army as soldiers. 
I'm sure the Southerners are too smart for that, for a million 
of them aren't worth 100 whites. General Paine is gobbling 
up these secesh here and starting them North kiting. How 
they are shaking in their boots. Paine is going to clean out 
the country and make it Union if there is nothing but desert 
left. There are a number of very fine people here, such men 
as Jacob H. Bass, highly honorable, conscientious, etc., but 
strong believers in State sovereignty, and because their State 
has seceded, they are secessionists, and for no other reason. 
Paine is going to make them walk the plank with the rest. It 
looks a little hard to me, as they are willing to be paroled, 
but I'll never say stop when anybody is pounding the secesh.

Tuscumbia, Ala., August 28, 1862. 

The order has been issued requiring battalion adjutants to 
be mustered out of the service, but Colonel Mizner insists on 
our remaining, and being either assigned to companies or 
made regimental adjutant commander and quartermaster, 
which offices this new law provides. General Oglesby wants 
me very much. I was down to Corinth a few days since and 
saw him. Told him about this order mustering me out, and 
he offered to go with me to General Grant and ask for an or- 
der excepting me from muster. I knew that the wording of 
my commission wouldn't allow such an irregularity and had 
to decline. If I stay with the regiment now, I will not be 
able to get on Oglesby's staff, as I wish, for in either of the 
three places which I can get, I could not be detached. But 
General Oglesby said that he would give me plenty of time to 
go home and hunt a lieutenancy in the company, and then he 
would have me assigned to him. I could not get home in less 
than eight days, and by that time I think would have a diffi- 
culty in getting a position, for regiments will be so near or- 
ganized that new comers will stand a poor chance. Have 
almost made up my mind to go home and run my chances. 
I know I am worth more than a lieutenancy, and that in these 
regiment staff places there is no chance for promotion. Would 
almost as lief commence again in the ranks. Am sure I 
would be a captain as quickly. 

[He came home and raised a company in the iO3d Illinois 
Infantry, and was elected captain. Ed.] 

Camp Peoria, October 3, 1862. 

I suppose this is the commencement of another series of let- 
ters from your army correspondent. You can't imagine how 
kind of old-fashioned good it seems to be in camp again. You 
know, of course, that my lucky star still rules, and that I have 
been elected captain. I think I have an excellent company, 
though I have but few men that I ever knew before. Charley 
Mattison is my first lieutenant, and John Dorrance, my sec- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. I2Q 

ond. The first lieutenant is able, willing and industrious. Dor- 
ranee will make a great deal better officer than you imagine. 
Think I will manage to visit you before we march, but can't 
promise. I am confined very closely, and have a great deal 
of work to do. But thank fortune, I partly understand it. 

Camp at Lagrange, West Tennessee, November 7, 1862. 
To say that we have been crowded, jammed, put through, 
hustled, skited, etc., don't half express the divil-of-a-hurry 
headquarters has shown and is showing us. We left Peoria 
one week ago last night, crossed the bridge at precisely 6 
o'clock p. m. Since that we have traveled one day and one 
night on the cars, a day resting, beside stacked arms waiting 
orders, the first quarter of a night pitching tents, then received 
orders to march with five days' rations at daylight, and the 
rest of the night spent in preparation therefor, then two days' 
marching through the aw fullest dust you ever saw, so thick 
we almost had to kick it out of the way to get our foot to the 
ground, then a day of rest and fat living off secesh pork, etc., 
and the seventh day a march of 20 miles by our whole brigade, 
after a little party of Rebel cavalry that couldn't more than eat 
a hog a day. Pretty good work for a green regiment, wasn't 
it? It seems real natural to be down in Secessia, the country 
where a 3OO-pound porker don't cost any more than a chicken 
that costs nothing. But some things we have to buy for our 
mess, and to show you what they cost, I will mention the 
items of flour and salt. The former is worth 50 cents per 
pound, and the latter $i a pound. We wouldn't have to buy 
them of citizens, but scarcity of transportation obliged our 
A. C. S. to leave everything but traveling rations, viz. ; Bacon, 
sugar, coffee and crackers. There is a man making boots in 
town at $45 a pair, and he can't get leather to fill his orders. 
Fine country. Between here and Bolivar, some 30 miles, I 
think there is not a house left or rail left unburned, and 'twas 
all done on our trip down. The fires were all lit by troops 
that marched ahead of us, and although the smoke and heat 
were disagreeable enough, yet I think the iO3d generally ap- 



I3O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

proved of the proceedings. Yet I was glad enough when the 
colonel, by the general's orders, called us to answer the ques- 
tion, "Do you know that any of your men burned rails, houses, 
or destroyed any property on the march from Bolivar?" that 
the iO3d had not participated. Major General McPherson, 
commanding this corps, disapproves of such conduct and will 
severely punish offenders if caught, which latter item is not 
at all probable. 'Tis generally understood that the Union Ten- 
nessee Cavalry did the work. The 7th Illinois is here with us 
and all are well that you know. 

We have good tents and are otherwise better prepared for 
soldiering than I ever was before. 

We have between 30,000 and 40,000, I suppose, between here 
and a point eight miles east. Price is supposed to be in the 
neighborhood of Holly Springs, 30 miles southwest, with 
40,000 to 60,000. They say we are waiting for the Memphis 
troops to join us before we go down and scoop him. We 
have the half of the old army of the Mississippi here, and part 
of the army of West Tennessee, nearly all experienced troops. 

Camp near the Tallahatchie, seven miles South of 
Holly Springs, Miss., 

December 3, 1862. 

We received marching orders at Lagrange, Tenn., at 9 
o'clock p. m. on the 27th, and moved at 6 a. m. on the 28th, 
on the Holly Springs road. We marched some five miles and 
then waited four or five hours for the divisions of Ross and 
McArthur from Grand Junction, and Quinby and Moscow to 
file into the road ahead of us. About 4 p. m. we were again set 
in motion, and at 7 p. m. (moonlight) we turned into the 
woods, about 10 miles from Lagrange, and bivouacked for 
the night. Fell in at 7 a. m., 29th, marched nine miles by 
2:30 p. m. to Coldwater, a very nice little stream, the water 
in which is as cold in July as in December. Here we rested 
until 6:30 p. m. and then marched six miles by moonlight to 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 13! 

Holly Springs, Miss., where we camped for the night. At 
8 a. m., 3Oth, moved out and arrived at the present camp about 
2 p. m. The last five miles we were cheered by the enlivening 
music of artillery firing ahead, pretty lively at times and then 
subsiding into an ocasional bellow, bringing the good old 
Madrid and Corinth times very distinctly to my mind. It's 
astonishing what an amount of ignorance I am guilty of in re- 
gard to the situation of affairs here, but I really haven't in- 
quired of or listened to any of the powers that be on the sub- 
ject. I've had my mind set on a fight in the neighborhood, 
and if we get that I don't care about details, if not I'll find 
out what I can, though 'tis an awful sight of trouble to sift 
sense and matter to be credited out of camp rumors, and that 
is about the only source a line officer has for getting informa- 
tion. Believe I'll give you a little list of rumors condensed, 
(i) Enemy 50,000 strong fortified on this side of Tallahat- 
chie. (2) Rebels driven across the river, only rifle pits on this 
side. (3) Sherman has turned their right flank and, we've got 
them sure. (4) Enemy only 30,000 strong in tremendous for- 
tifications opposite side of river ; bridge burned, will be rebuilt 
by midnight, when we'll pitch into them, etc. (5) Pemberton 
wants to fight; Price opposes the idea. (6) Fortifications 
evacuated night of ist inst., and Sherman pushing the enemy's 
right as they retreat (To back this No. 6 rumor, heavy col- 
umns were pushing past us all day yesterday in a driving rain). 
(7) Steel and Curtis have pushed across from Helena or 
Napoleon and taken possession of Grenada, cutting off the 
Rebel line of retreat; Curtis' force 25,000. (8) Price has 
cut through Curtis' force and escaped. (9) Price attacked 
Curtis, was repulsed and is now coming back this way, etc. 
There has been cannonading the last three days some four or 
six miles ahead, but none to-day. Squads of prisoners pass 
us going to the rear every day. The country from Lagrange 
to this place is very good, clearings much more extensive and 
more evidences of wealth than on the Mobile and Ohio road. 
We were on picket the ist inst. some two miles in advance of 



132 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

our camp and had a grand time. This iO3d out jayhawks old 
Jennison himself. The regiment went on picket the last time 
with one day's rations, and I swear I believe they came in 
with six days'. My company "found" 150 pounds of 
flour, a hog, a beef, two and one-half bushels of sweet potatoes, 
chickens, ducks, milk, honey and apples. The night we stopped 
at Holly Springs, Company G must have confiscated $300 
(the way these people figure) worth of eatables, among which 
were one barrel of molasses, 300 pounds of sugar, one barrel 
of flour, four hogs, etc. But I don't allow them to take any- 
thing but eatables. I think it right, and can find no argu- 
ments for any other side of the question. Holly Springs is a 
beautiful little town, but not so rich, I think, as Jackson, 
Tenn., which beats everything for its size, I ever saw. Our 
army, trains and all, stretched out in marching shape, is, I 
think, 30 miles long. Believe without Sherman it numbers 
from 40,000 to 45,000. Anyway we have enough to skin Mis- 
sissippi. Major General McPherson commands our right wing 
of two divisions, Logan's and McKean's. Hamilton has the 
left wing of three divisions, McArthur, Ross and Quinby. 
Don't know what Sherman has, but he holds a good hand and 
has some trumps that we know of, particularly Hurlbut and 
Lanman. I never saw men in as good spirits and so confi- 
dent as this army now appears. We are splendidly equipped 
and want nothing. The only drawback is the men's having 
to carry their knapsacks, but if the fine weather will only 
continue we'll stand that. We don't use any tents at night 
when marching, and 'tis no hardship to lie out at night yet. 
The boys strip to their underclothing, with only two blankets, 
and never grumble. I can't see why people will stay at home 
when they can get to soldiering. I think a year of it is worth 
getting shot for to any man. I believe I used to get a little 
homesick or girl sick, but my brief furloughs have taught me 
the vanity and vexation of spirit folks are liable to in the 
States, and I think I'll hanker thereafter no more. If I can 
get into the regular army, I'll do it sure.

Tennessee, near Tallahatchie, Miss.,

Still we tarry by the wayside anxiously awaiting the order 
to move forward. We did provide three days' rations once, 
but devoured them without leaving camp. Two divisions, Mc- 
Kean's and Ross', have left here, while the remainder of the 
army has pushed onward. We hear of the advance skirmishing 
50 miles in front of us. Think the main force is at Oxford, 
about 25 miles from here. We're probably waiting for the 
railroad to be repaired so that supplies can be furnished us 
when we move. The retreating Rebels destroyed every cul- 
vert and bridge as they fell back, and it of course takes time 
to rebuild so many. The road is not yet in running order to 
Holly Springs, and everything has to be wagoned to the army, 
which but a very little rain in this country makes impossible. 
We suffered three days of cold, drizzling rain last week which 
most effectually blockaded the roads, but the last three days 
have been beautifully clear, etc., and travel is again resumed. 
We will change camp to-morrow to improve our water facili- 
ties, probably moving four or five miles back toward Holly 
Springs. One mile northward is harder to travel than 10 in 
the opposite direction. My whole company is detached from 
the regiment as provost guard. It relieves us from picket duty, 
fatigue, etc., gives us officers' quarters in a house (there are 
a sofa, two rocking chairs, soft-bottomed chairs, a library, 
feather bed, etc., in the room I am now writing in and occupy) . 
I've soldiered long enough to never refuse these little good 
things Providence throws in my way. The detail is perma- 
nent, but suppose I can get back to my regiment when I feel 
disposed. The 7th Cavalry had a little skirmish in front a 
day or two since; Coe, and a number of others were taken 
prisoners. Nelson was a prisoner once, I hear, but was re- 
taken by his men, or the 2d Illinois Cavalry. Rumor has it 



134 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

to-day, that our forces have possession of Jackson, Miss., and 
have captured 3,000 of General Holmes' Army, which was at- 
tempting to reinforce Pemberton. Don't think the rumor 
worth doubting, unless McClernand has got within striking 
distance. Can't hear a word from his expedition. Wonder 
what the deuce Banks is going to try to do. Hope we won't 
fool away his time and the lives of his men in Texas. We've 
had enough of those coast expeditions. The one under Butler 
was the only one that paid expenses. Burnside is beaten badly. 
Will bet that another change of base will be necessary before 
Richmond is ours. We're out of all patience with that army. 
We are slow enough in all reason, but they certainly beat us 
crawling, wonderfully, making slowness the gage. Our men 
are using this country awfully rough. Such animals as chick- 
ens, fences, swine, etc., are entirely unseeable and unfindable 
within 15 miles of where our camp has been this last week. 
This alone is not so bad; but if you wink at this amount of 
license in soldiers, they go farther and insult and almost scare 
to death women and children, all citizens indiscriminately. 
Guess that 'tis the intention of the general commanding to 
reform this matter. Says he is going to hold company officers 
responsible for the conduct of their men and punish officers, 
not soldiers, hereafter for outrages committed. I send my boys 
out as patrols, and whenever they catch a man with poultry or 
meat of any kind they relieve him thereof, take him under 
guard to his regimental commander, and Company G eats up 
the chickens or pork, or potatoes, of course; so you see 
this provost duty is not so bad as it might be on us. I have 
also in my charge 35 Rebel prisoners, Louisianians and North 
Carolinians. Price had three Kentucky regiments, but they 
have nearly all deserted him, hundreds have taken the oath at 
different points along our line and gone to their homes. I 
have an old negro here now that I wish I could send to you 
to cut the wood and do your errands. He is 63 years old, but 
is good for twenty years yet.

Provost Marshal's Office, Waterford, Miss., 

December 12, '62. 

From captain of the provost guard, I have been changed 
to provost marshal. I had charge of two companies, doing 
the guard duty for the provost of our division until yester- 
day; the division was ordered forward to Oxford, except 
our regiment, which was left to guard the railroad between 
this point and the Tallahatchie river. Headquarters be- 
ing here, Colonel Dickerman appointed me provost and 
sent my company to guard a bridge one and one-half miles 
south of this place. My business is to attend to all prison- 
ers, deal with citizens (administer oaths, take paroles, 
etc.), give all passes for citizens and soldiers leaving, have 
charge of all soldiers straggling from their regiments, issue 
permits to sutlers, etc., and overlook the cotton trade. 
Altogether, quite enough for any one man to attend to. 
The little advantage of having a comfortable house to live 
in, etc., is worth something ; but I kind o' feel as if I would 
rather be with my company. Another regiment came in 
to-night, I2th Indiana, and we may possibly be relieved 
to-morrow. Shall be glad if we can only get with our di- 
vision again. General Lanman has again taken command 
of our division, and although we know nothing against 
McKean, yet we know so much good of Lanman, that 
we're much pleased. Eight of our companies are guarding 
bridges, so we only have two here. Confound this rail- 
road guarding; I'm down or. it. 'Tis more dangerous than 
regular soldiering, harder work, and no shadow of a chance 
for glory. There's a smart chance of fun in my present 
business, particularly in the citizens branch thereof. It 
would have furnished you with amusement enough for a 
month, could you have heard an old lady talk who visited 
me to-day. She was a F. F. and blooded, Oh, Lord! We 
let all come within the lines ; but before they can pass out, 
an oath or parole is required of them. How they squirm! 
Rebels, though they are, 'tis shocking and enough to make 



136 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

one's blood boil to see the manner in which some of our 
folks have treated them. Trunks have been knocked to 
pieces with muskets when the women stood by, offering 
the keys, bureau drawers drawn out, the contents turned 
on the floor, and the drawer thrown through the window, 
bed clothing and ladies' clothing carried off and all manner 
of deviltry imaginable perpetrated. Of course the scoun- 
drels who do this kind of work would be severely punished 
if caught, but the latter is almost impossible. Most of the 
mischief is done by the advance of the army, though, God 
knows, the infantry is bad enough. The d d thieves even 
steal from the negroes (which is lower business than I ever 
thought it possible for a white man to be guilty of) and 
many of them are learning to hate the Yankees as much 
as our "Southern Brethren" do. The army is becoming 
awfully depraved. How the civilized home folks will ever 
be able to live with them after the war, is, I think, some- 
thing of a question. If we don't degenerate into a nation 
of thieves, 'twill not be for lack of the example set by a fair 
sized portion of our army. Do you remember that I used 
to write that a man would no sooner lose his morality in 
the army than at home? I now respectfully beg to recall 
the remark, but I believe the sight of such devilish, point- 
less wickedness disgusts me, and that your brother's moral 
principles are strengthened by contact with these ungodly. 
Instance, in my present position, I know without danger of 
exposure, I could pocket at least $500 within five days ; but 
for conscience sake and my self-respect, I sit back with my 
purity, and tumble my keys and comb round in my other- 
wise empty pockets and feel good. Well, it won't do to 
brag on such a subject, but my confidence in the honesty 
of man has waned so much since I entered the army that 
I can't help saying, there are few that would not, in my 
position, make a raise. Can't hear anything from the front. 
Know that part of Sherman's army has returned to Mem- 
phis to join the expedition down the Mississippi and that 
is all. This town only contains a dozen or 20 houses, but

they are good ones. Great many here profess to have al- 
ways been Union, and many are taking the oath willingly. 
Good joke on them when the guerrillas come in after we 
leave. Suspect they have most all been Rebels, so I don't 
pity them as much as I do out-spoken seceshers. I rode out 
in the country eight miles day before yesterday, and found 
three convalescent soldiers of Price's army at one place, 
A lieutenant of the 53d Illinois was with me, so we brought 
them into camp and put them with the other prisoners. 
We have now nearly 3,000 soldiers in the hospital at La- 
grange and yet the army is very healthy. Don't be much 
surprised if you hear of us being gobbled up by the guer- 
rillas, for these railroad guards are only baits for them ; 
nothing more. 

Provost Marshal's Office, Waterford, Miss., 

December 23, 1862. 

Suspect this will be my last from this country. Where the 
army is going I know not, but the divisions which have been 
in front are now filing past us, faces northward. The move- 
ment commencing at the time of the raid on Holly Springs, 
gives it the appearance of a retrograde for that reason, but I 
think that has nothing to do with the matter, for though I 
have no idea of the future plans of the general commanding, 
yet have known . for some time that it was not the intention 
to pursue further than Grenada on this line, and that point 
has been evacuated by the enemy for some days. The raid 
into Holly Springs was capitally done. The Rebels made a 
No. i haul. Immense stores of clothing, commissaries and 
ordnance fell into their hands, all of which, however, they were 
obliged to destroy, save what they could carry away on their 
horses. About 1,200 or 1,500 officers and soldiers were pa- 
roled by them, some 1,000 horses carried off ,and I think not 
less than $1,000,000 of greenbacks. One-half million worth 
of cotton was burned, etc.; loss to Government cannot be 



138 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

less than three or four millions of dollars. Colonel Murphy is 
the man who is responsible for the whole thing, and I can 
think of no punishment equal to his deserts. 'Twas but nine 
miles from us and we of course immediately prepared for a 
visit, but were not so honored. These successful raids of the 
enemy almost make me sick. If our men would only be on 
the alert so that they could make something of a fight, I 

wouldn't care a d n. But to lose a thousand prisoners 

without the enemy's having one killed ,makes me disgusted 
with the army. I'm allying a little fun with business as op- 
portunities offer. Friday last I got permission of the colonel 
to make a little reconnoisance of the country along Tippah 
river, and on the Tallahatchie between the mouth of Tippah 
and the railroad. I stayed six miles from camp the first night 
and went possum hunting. Hunted until 2 o'clock a. m. and 
although we treed a good many, couldn't get them. Examined 
the country thoroughly next day, made a map of it, found there 
were no guerrillas near our camp and then got a shot gun and 
hunted. The young fellow I was with and myself, in an hour 
killed seven squirrels and a coon. Got back to town at dark, 
Saturday night, and found everybody terribly excited about 
the Holly Springs affair. They had given me up for a goner. 
The regiment laid on their arms and I laid on my featherbed, 
for I knew devilish well there was no danger. We've been on 
the alert ever since but the enemy has gone. To-day the guer- 
rillas have been seen on all sides of us within a few miles, but 
Ross' division has just arrived so there is no chance for a 
fight. 

Provost Marshal's Office, Waterford, Miss.,

Fifteen days outside the world and still we live. No pa-

try all to our disadvantage, and two cowardly surrenders, 
Holly Springs and Trenton. Pemberton's cavalry under Van 
Dorn, turned our left, and striking at our line of communica- 
tion, first surprised and captured Holly Springs, burned every- 
thing belonging to our army with the houses containing the 
stores; then while a portion of the column retreated another 
portion successively attacked our troops stationed at Coldwater 
bridge, Middleton, Grand Junction, and outposts near Bolivar, 
in all of which they were repulsed. About the same time a 
portion of Bragg's forces crossed the Tennessee river at or 
near Musch Shoals, Ala., and marched along the south side 
of the river toward Corinth. General Dodge at Corinth sent 
out Colonel Sweeny, who met and defeated the enemy, driving 
him across the river. The enemy then again crossed the river 
near Savannah, and moving toward Jackson were met by Bob 
Ingersoll, whom, after something of a fight, 'tis said, they cap- 
tured with his command. Trenton was then cowardly sur- 
rendered by some 250 Tennessee cavalry. Attacks were made 
on several other posts garrisoned by our troops, in all of which 

the enemy were repulsed. Altogether there has been a d 1 

of a time. When Van Dorn had finished his little bonfire at 
Holly Springs, this army was left with about five day's ra- 
tions, which we have to make do 15 at least. In order to make 
up the deficit in commissaries, General Grant ordered that 
everything eatable that could be found in the country be seized 
for army use. In the strip of country from Holly Springs 
to Coffeeville, for, say 15 miles wide, there is not enough left 
to feed 50 chickens a week. Colonel Dickerman and I visited 
Holly Springs yesterday and took a little look at the ruins. 
I suppose the damage to the citizens amounts to nearly as much 
as the Government's loss. Most of the best and largest houses 
were burned. General Grant told Colonel Dickerman that our 
regiment would be sent to Jackson in a few days to guard that 
place. Well, if we have to go into winter quarters that 
will suit your brother very much. We will be nearer home 
and communication will not be so apt to be broken between us.

There I quit, for we received orders to get ready at once to 
march to Jackson, Tenn. The colonel ordered me to take 
charge of the train (wagons) and with my company guard 
it through by the wagon road, while the other nine companies 
went through by railroad. The regiment got off that evening, 
but I was delayed until the 3ist, when just as I got my com- 
pany into line to start a couple of the finest houses in town 
took fire, and burned down. The colonel commanding the i$th 
Illinois Infantry, which had just arrived, put me under arrest 
and stationed a guard around my company, but after an hour's 
detention, my strong protestations against arrest and my ar- 
guments in favor of the honorable acquital of my men of the 
charges, induced him to allow us to proceed on our way. By 
Lieutenant Mattison's personal smartness the train was taken 
from the road in the p. m., while I was ahead selecting camp- 
ing grounds for the night, and I did not get with it for two 
days, which I traveled alone. The distance is about 90 miles. 
The first night I stayed at Holly Springs and slept in the bed 
which General Pemberton, Van Dorn and Lovell of the Rebel 
Army, and Hamilton, of ours, in turn occupied. 'Twas in the 
room they occupied for headquarters. Mrs. Stricklin, the lady 
of the house, was charming. Her husband is a major in the 
Rebel Army. I ate my New Year's dinner at Dr. Ellis'. He 
was not at home, but his lady treated me very politely, and I 
give her credit for having the noblest face I ever saw on 
woman. She is a sister of Rebel General Hindman. Stayed 
at a private house at Lagrange that night (Mrs. Cockes) and 
heard some delightful music made by a daughter. Saw seven 
mounted Rebels on the 2d, and felt uneasy traveling alone, but 
got through safe to Bolivar. Here I caught up with my train 
which I thought was behind. When we started my men were 
on foot, when I caught up with them at Bolivar, 38 of them 
were mounted on horses or mules. Stayed at Medon Station 
last night, and arrived here at 3 this p. m., all safe. I have 
to go back to Holly Springs to-morrow to testify against 
the lOQth for disloyalty.

Camp at Lagrange, Tenn., November 17, 1862. 
Our whole regiment went on picket Saturday evening. Didn't 
reach our posts until 9 :3O p. m. Had plenty of fresh meat next 
day (notwithstanding stringent orders), and beautiful weather. 
Our going on picket saved us a tramp of 22 miles, for which I 
am duly grateful. They had a scare at Summerville while we 
we were out; our brigade (except we who were on duty) were 
started out, nobody hurt, happy to chronicle. Squads of prison- 
ers taken by our cavalry are constantly arriving from the front. 
Very little skirmishing though, mostly unarmed citizens, etc. 
There are an immense number of slaves at the different military 
posts through here and in this vicinity. The officials are using 
them to good advantage in securing the large crops of cotton 
to the Government. The camps are overflowing with them, 
and their music and dancing furnish the boys with amuse- 
ment unlimited. Don't have half the fun with the natives 
that I used to, in fact haven't spoken to any since I have been 
out this time. Guess I'm steadying down some. Like soldier- 
ing as well as ever but the novelty's gone, and its more like a 
regular way of living to me than a spree as it used to be. Don't 
see any immediate prospect of a move, but a chap can't tell 
what any symptom means here. I'd bet several times that 
we're on the point of starting. We have been reviewed twice 
within four days by Grant, McPherson, McKean, Logan and 
Pugh.

Every one seems to think that we will start about day- 
after to-morrow, Monday. We have drawn eight days' 
rations, and 200 rounds of ammunition has also been drawn 
for our corps. I don't think we have more than 14,000 in 
our corps, Logan's and McKean's Divisions, although 
there are some eight or ten new regiments here that I 
don't know, where assigned. Report to-day says that Sher- 
man has moved from Memphis on the Holly Springs Pike. 



142 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

We are having delightful weather. No fires are necessary 
until dark, and we have had no frosts since our arrival. 
Hope we will keep ahead of cold weather if compatible 
with the interests of the service. I "borrowed" some citi- 
zens clothes and wrote myself a pass as suttler's clerk, 
last night, and strolled around the town a couple of hours. 
There are many fine buildings here, among the rest two 
very large academies. Many of the Memphian nobility 
have country seats here, some of them most elegant. 
Holly Springs, though, is the most important summer ren- 
dezvous for the Memphis folk. Our people have left the 
Springs, and I don't know that we have any troops in ad- 
vance of this place. I am very comfortable in my quarters. 
Have plenty of blankets and a good stove. My colored 
boy, Dave, went into the country 20 miles last night and 
returned this p. m. with his wife, a delicate looking black 
woman, neat and much above the ordinary slave. She has 
been a sewing girl all her life, and I think would be worth 
something to a family that has much plain sewing to do. 
I think I will try to send her to Mrs. S. C. Thompson. 
"Dave" is a first rate cook and waiter, and I'll keep him 
with me until the war closes (if he don't spoil) and then 
take him to his woman. How'd you like a good colored 
woman for your kitchen? This woman mended my pants 
(I have two pairs) as neatly as any tailor could. Our regi- 
ment beats 19 out of 20 of the old ones for discipline, and 
averages with them for drill. Colonel Dickerman is a star, 
and Lieutenant Colonel Wright is proving himself much 
better than we expected. Colonel Oglesby has figured away 
ahead of anybody I've heard of yet in procuring wagons, 
tents, etc., for this regiment. Ours is the only regiment 
I've heard of yet that is allowed to retain the old comple- 
ment of transportation, equipage and tents. I'm officer of 
the day and 'tis my duty to make the rounds of the senti- 
nels to-night at I or 2 o'clock ; but in consideration of etc., 
think the formality will be dispensed with.

Camp at Lagrange, Term., November 15, 1862. 
We're having more of a rest here than we anticipated 
when we arrived. Suppose that the organizing of the army 
into divisions and brigades delays us some; and, maybe, 
the change of commanders in the Potomac army has some- 
thing to do with it. Or possibly we're waiting for Mc- 
Clernand to move from Memphis. I don't think our army 
here (the Corinth and Bolivar forces) is very large, though 
some estimate it quite strong, as much as 50,000 or 60,000. 
I think we have about 35,000, maybe less. General Lan- 
man has been relieved from command of our division by 
General McKean and ordered to Memphis. Am sorry to 
lose him. He has few equals for skill in handling a divi- 
sion or honor and courage as a soldier. Am much afraid 
that the rainy season will catch us in the midst of our slow 
motions, and then good bye all hopes of the war's closing 
next spring. McPherson and Logan promised in speeches 
a few days since that we would finish up the business 
within 40 days; and I believe we can, West of Georgia, if 
this weather will continue and our commanders will im- 
prove it. Don't believe that Price will dare to fight us 
anywhere, certainly not this side of Jackson. We can't 
have more than 40 days' of marching weather yet until the 
rains come, and in that time we ought at least to make 250 
miles. The more I think about the matter, the surer I am 
that we won't do much before next May. Well, I enjoy 
soldiering and can stand the delay in proportion; but in- 
activity when a fellow can't see the reason therefor, is 
provoking to a degree extensive. We made a capital start 
from Peoria to this place in five days, but the thing hasn't 
been followed up. Our cavalry has been doing some dash- 
ing work here, sums up about 300 prisoners, etc. But the 
7th hasn't figured much therein, at least not in reports, 
although the 7th boys say they did their share. I have 
seen all my acquaintances in the 7th, and the 8th Infantry is 
also here. Fred Norcott and Milo are both looking splen- 



144 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

didly. Also Ben Rockhold. 'Tis said that General Logan 
publicly disgraced the I7th to-day for some insult to him- 
self. Never thought much of that i/th and think less now 
than ever before. They certainly show no signs of 
discipline that can be seen by the naked eye. The 7th 
Kansas Cavalry, 'tis said, proposed in writing to General 
Grant, that if he would give them a certain time, (no other 
condition), they would capture or kill General Price. I 
wish he'd do it. They would raise the d 1 around the 
Rebel army, and I believe it practicable at any time for 
500 daring men to reach the person of any of our com- 
manders, and why not theirs. They are cutting our 
baggage down to a very small compass, so that six wagons 
can haul for ten companies. I'm opposed to it, but Halleck 
ranks me and I will have to submit. Nobody in this coun- 
try seems to care a cuss whether McClellan is removed or 

V not. General feeling is that the Potomac Army is only 
good to draw greenbacks and occupy winter quarters. 
We're in hopes that Pope will be sent back to us after he 
finishes hanging those Indians. I don't believe there is 
a regiment in this army that would not cheer him as its 
corps commander. Everybody seems to be willing to bet 
something on Pope. Hurlbut is the most popular man 
here as a division commander, and I think that Grant 
could get more votes than any other man for commander 

/ of the army, always excepting Rosy. Grant is not so popu- 
lar among the general officers, as far as I know, but the 
whole line believe in him, mostly, because he is for going 
ahead and will fight his men. The Memphis force hasn't 
moved yet that I can hear of. Everything goes on swim- 
mingly in the iO3d. The old regiments try to bore our 
boys by calling them conscripts and $40 men, but don't 
succeed well. In a march of 15 miles last week an old 
regiment, 3d Iowa, tried to run us down but it ended in 
our marching right through them. Dorrance is an excel- 
lent fellow in the field, wouldn't trade him for any other

lieutenant in the regiment. The Democratic victories at 
the polls don't excite anyone here. We only wish the 
soldiers could vote. Illinois would talk differently if we 
could.. 

Camp iO3d Illinois Infantry, Jackson, Tenn.,

Your letters are beginning to come through with more reg- 
ularity and on decidedly better time. Have received your date 
of December 30, although the last was dated November i6th, 
and was the first you wrote after we left Peoria. You bewailed 
our being sent south of Cairo, which I think very un- 
generous in you. Well, you'll probably be suited in our 
present location, which is the only consolation I have in be- 
ing sent so far rearward. There are some slight hopes though, 
that we may be sent to Vicksburg, which will ripen into a 
distant probability (nothing more I'm afraid) if the news of 
our repulse there be true. We're encamped in the suburbs of 
this delightful little town, but so strict are the orders of the 
general (Sullivan) that, as far as seeing the town or making 
purchases therein are concerned, we might as well be camped 
on Pike's Peak. All right, Mr. Sullivan, have your own way. 
He is by all odds the most like a soldier of all the garrison 
commandants I have been under. Will wager that you will 
never hear of his being surprised. The news from Holly- 
Springs is that the last house in the town was burned night 
before last. Pretty rough, but I say, amen. Its pretty well 
understood in this army now that burning Rebel property is 
not much of a crime. I for one will never engage in it, until 
orders are issued making it duty, and then I think I can enjoy 
it as much as any of them. If any part of this army is ever 
called home to quell those Illinois tories, orders to burn and 
destroy will not be necessary. Since I have seen the proceed- 
ings of that traitorous legislature, I begin to understand why 
these loyal Tennesseans and Alabamians are so much more 
bitter against traitors than we are. It would make your blood 



146 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

run cold to hear the men in this army, without regard to party, 
curse those traitors. There is a gay time in prospect for those 
chaps. Don't think I am much out of the way in saying that 
Merrick, Jem Allen, Dick Richardson, and the editors of the 
Chicago Times would be hung if caught within the lines of 
many Illinois regiments in this army. There are many officers 
who, while they doubt our ability to subjugate (that is the ques- 
tion) the South, would take an active part in ending the man 
who would propose to give the thing up. I come pretty near be- 
longing to that party, though I think that if we can't accomp- 
lish the whole end desired, we can confine the Rebels to Vir- 
ginia (Eastern), the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida. Alabama, 
I believe, we can hold if we get Mississippi. Boats which left 
Vicksburg on the 6th inst. reported it taken, but it must be 
a mistake, as it has not been confirmed. I think it was wicked 
to put that brave old 8th Missouri and 4th Iowa into the front 
of the battle, after they had suffered so severely at Donaldson, 
Shiloh, Farmington, etc., but ever since Shiloh it seems that the 
old soldiers have had the front all the time. 'Tis reported that 
when Grant moves again, he will leave all the new regiments 
as railroad and property guards, and move with the old army. 
The last night I stayed in Holly Springs, Mrs. Stricklin in- 
vited in some young ladies to help entertain the colonel, Lieu- 
tenant Nickolet and myself. They beat all the secesh I have 
seen yet. One of them played all the secesh pieces she knew, 
and when I asked her to play "John Brown," she swelled up 
so with wrath, that I was strongly tempted to propose tying 
my suspenders around her to save hooks and eyes. One of them 
asked me if I did not think the Southerners the most polite, 
refined and agreeable people I had ever met. It took me 
twenty minutes before I could finish blushing for her lack of 
modesty, and then I was so dead beat that I could only take up 
the word refined, and tell her how much I admired their beau- 
tiful use of language. I instanced, "what do you'uns all come 
down here to fight we'uns for," "I recon we war thar," which 
you'll hear from the best of them. That first quotation as 
they speak it is the funniest sentence imaginable. I got into

a row with every one I talked with, but finally, was fool enough 
to escort one home. Rumor (almost official) says to-night 
that we go to Memphis to-morrow, or soon, and thence to 
Vicksburg. Congratulate us on our good luck. This regiment 
will never be satisfied without a fight. They run in in our 
pickets once and awhile here, and I believe two were killed 
(pickets) yesterday, but guess there is no chance for a fight. 
The i8th Illinois Infantry is being mounted. 

Camp io3d Illinois Infantry, Jackson, Tenn.,

It commenced raining early the morning of the I4th and 
did not cease until about 2 a. m. the I5th, since when it has 
snowed steadily until within two hours. The snow is some 
eight inches deep, underneath which is mud immeasurable. 
The rain the last six or eight hours came through our tent 
as through a sieve, the snow came in at the top, through the 
door, and blew under the curtains. Everybody's wearing ap- 
parel, blankets, and self absorbed all the damp possible, and 
besides carried all that would hold on outside. Our stove was 
in this extremity our comfort and our joy. We kept two loyal 
Ethiopians busy during the two days, getting wood, and feed- 
ing said comforter. Great was the tribulation, and much 
audible cursing resulted, while the secret history of oaths 
unuttered, would I'm afraid, fill many volumes, and in all hu- 
man probability cause, if made public, the appointment of 
many army chaplains. This is the first winter weather that 
we have had, and I'll be willing if it proves the last, although 
there is a half melancholy pleasure in spludging around in this 
slop and taking the weather as it comes, without its first be- 
ing made to feel the refining influence of house walls and good 
warm fires. Our men have become quite soldier-like, and en- 
dure without much murmuring the little ills as they come. 
It shows some of the principles of manhood, you must be- 
lieve, when men stand this weather in these worthless little 
wedge tents, without fires and without grumbling. I got four 
of my men discharged to-day, and want to discharge some 

10

six or eight more. When I get my deadheads off my hands 
will have some 70 good men left. Rather think now, that we 
are stationary here for the winter, but we may possibly be 
sent to Vicksburg, than which nothing will suit us better There 
are some eight or nine regiments here, two or three of them 
cavalry. The enemy is pretty well cleared out of this strip 
of country, and if Rosecrans gets down into North Alabama, 
opinion seems to be that some of us can be spared from here 
for Vicksburg and Port Hudson. Several houses have been 
burned here lately. This town will share the fate of Holly 
Springs, sure, if the Rebels trouble us here any more. Tis 
fearfully secesh, and a little fire will, I think, help to purify it. 
Isn't it wonderful how with so much fighting everywhere I 
have escaped so long? The whole of the loth Illinois In- 
fantry were with me in luck until the last fight at Murfrees- 
boro, and am not certain they participated in that. There are 
two regiments here that have endured all of this storm with- 
out tents. I suppose the Lord takes care of them fellows, if 
it's a fact that he looks after sheared sheep and birds. From 
my heart I pity them, though that strikes me as something 
like the little boy who, when his mother put him to bed and 
covered him with an old door, told her how much he pitied 
folks who had no doors to cover themselves with while they 
slept. That's a story mother and aunt used to tell me in my 
trundle-bed days. Wonder if aunty has forgotten the story 
that used to make Tip and me rave. All about how that "great 
big prairie wolf bit a wee boy's head off." I almost forgot 
that I am out of woollen socks. Have only the pair of socks 
that are on my feet. Put them on this morning, and there 
were so many holes that I could hardly tell where to put my 
feet in. Wish you'd send me three or four pair. Will make 
cotton ones do until then. I can send you a nigger baby 
if it would be acceptable. They are more "antic" than either a 
squirrel or monkey. I have two he niggers, two she's and 
three babies, mess property. Think I will either have to drown 
the babies, or sell them and the women, whom I endure be- 
cause their husbands are such good hands. Will you take 
one?

Camp Reed, Jackson, Term., 

January 22, 1863. 

I received your four- volume letter of the 5th, I2th, I3th 
inst. last night, and return you my sincere thanks for the time 
and writing material you expended in my behalf. I suppose 
that you now understand why you did not receive my letters. 

You ask me how I like the news from Vicksburg. All right. 
That was only a little reconnoisance in force, which paid its 
way by gobbling up Arkansas post. We want to get these 
seceshers all together at Vicksburg and then close the war in 
this country. Wait about a month, if you want to hear a call 
for bombazine, etc. We'll have that little town then, or a 
very large portion of the loyal people of Illinois will go to 
make that a very fertile point. By the way, aren't you afraid 
that Rosecrans will get his hands full if it be true that Long- 
street with 13 brigades has arrived at Chattanooga? Guess 
those Eastern Rebels must know better how to fight than 
Bragg, Price, Van Dorn, etc., at any rate I'm a little suspi- 
cious of that Longstreet and wish that one or two of these 
divisions here could be sent to oppose. Believe I would rather 
we would be whipped here than see "Rosy" beaten. There 
will be somebody awfully hurt though, before that latter item 
takes place, and Rosecrans himself will never live to read an 
account of it. 

Staff appointments are nicer than the line business, but 
chance for promotion is not so great nor so honorable in my 
opinion. Although one does get more credit in reports, and 
has more influence. Anyway the chances for a captain to be 
detached on staff duty are very limited, and nearly always 
matters of outside influence. A first lieutenant's chance on 
his merits are much better for several reasons. Officers are 
beginning to resign in a very lively manner in our regiment. 
Am satisfied that of the original captains, only Sid., Frank 
Post and myself will be left in two months from now, and I 
can see that both Sid. and Frank would not object to being 
let out gently and honorably, especially if they could happen

on a good little fight shortly, and then leave. Poor fellows! 
One has a new wife and the other an old girl, each gets five 
letters a week and looks a little sicker after each letter than 
before. Guess I'll have to get me one of them girls to be in 
the fashion, though I haven't yet got over that one's patting 
me on the shoulder when I enlisted, telling me what a 
fine, brave fellow, etc., I was and then marrying within three 
weeks after I'd gone. I'm not very desperate in consequence, 
but can't think it was fair. Sid. got back from Cairo to-night 
with his men, minus 30, of whom some ten deserted and the 
remainder were left sick. Profitable trip. We are on half 
rations again for five days, but I managed to secure a 700- 
pound beef for my company, so we'll not starve. I report 
more men for duty than any other company in the regiment. 
Call that doing pretty well when you consider that mine is a 
picked company. Major Phelps is here and says we will be 
paid off shortly. That means between now and July as I 
take it. Am not particular though. Uncle Sam can go to the 

d 1 with his greenbacks, if he'll only send us to Rosy or 

Vicksburg. Weather here has moderated considerably. It is 
i o'clock a. m. now and I am without coat or fire and am com- 
fortable. I never retire before I or 2 o'clock any more. Am 
ashamed to say what time I get up. We think here that this 
place and Corinth will be evacuated ere long Troops are pass- 
ing through here from Corinth every day, going to Vicksburg. 
Every sign says that we will leave here within ten days, but 
all signs are unsartin. The moon to-night says a dry month. 
Don't I hope she won't fool us. This half-ration business is 
only so in name, the full ration has a tremendous margin for 
waste and men can grow fat on half rations. I do believe that 
they live just as well. When the 1st of January proclamation 
was issued a number of our officers became very much ex- 
cited. Several of them talked strongly of tendering their 
resignations in consequence thereof, and one of them really did. 
But we were too strong for the d d compromising lick- 
spittles, and to-day you can't hear a whimper against it. The 
major and adjutant were strongly opposed to it, but they dare 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. !$! 

not say so to-day. All of that excitement at home is working 
on the army though, and even if it requires bayonets, the good 
of the army demands that the agitation cease. That is the 
cause of all the desertions, and they are many that are occur- 
ring, and nine-tenths of the discontent and demoralization 
spring from the same source. A tremendous number have de- 
serted of late and the evil is growing.. Thousands would leave 
if we could be stationed on the border. Well, the old soldiers 
are very, very tired of the war. Any number of them would 
recognize three or four confederacies to get home, and their 
influence over the new men is boundless. The Confederate 
rank and file feels the same way. Nineteen-twentieths would 
vote for the United States or any other man to secure peace, 
but their officers and citizens control the matter. It don't 
make any difference what commission you intrust your sani- 
tary stores to for the stealings are all in the hospitals, and 
these sanitary commissaries all issue to any hospital that is in 
need.

February i, 1863. 

I'm on duty as "field officer of the day," and have been 
temping around in the mud looking to policing, guards, 
etc., and just now a detail has come for me to go on picket 
to-morrow. I was only relieved from picket yesterday 
morning. We are very short of officers, having only II 
for duty in the regiment. All sick. D n 'em, they ought 
to resign and let men draw the pay who do the work. I 
have seven men in the hospital now, one of whom is going 
to die. Poor fellow, how I do pity him. I never thought 
as much, even of my sick comrades in the 8th, as I do of 
my men when they get sick. James Colton is the one's 
name who is the sickest. He is a real good young man and 
has a wife. Lives in the west part of the country. Mine 
is the only company that has no deserters yet, and I don't 
believe I will have any. Half of these desertions are the

\f fault of officers. I have been out this evening calling on 
a family named Stephens, living near our camp. They are 
strongly secesh, but very fine people. No girls in the 
family but a splendid looking young wife. I guess that 
we are cut out of that Vicksburg fight, though if this 
place is evacuated, there is a chance yet. That is the only 
one though, for all the troops except our brigade have left 
here. Some to Memphis, and I suppose, below. It makes 
our duty pretty heavy. Picket every third day, besides 
police, foraging, and fatigue and camp guard. But I al- 
ways enjoy duty better than quiet camp life. I'm afraid 
this agitation North is going to play the d 1 with the 
army. The great body is loyal enough but can't help being 
discouraged and, in a degree, disappointed when treason 
is preached openly in the North and unrebuked. Confin- 
ing a lot of those traitors would have an excellent effect on 
the soldiers; but I believe that Lincoln is almost afraid 
to try that again. If this regiment is paid off before there 
is the change in officers there should be, I'm afraid deser- 
tions will be very numerous. I begin to feel some of the 
old soldier's prejudice against the "forty-dollar man," but 
I do believe we can, if properly officered, make a crack regi- 
ment. I tell you, between ourselves, that of the 30 line 

V officers there are not more than six that are worth their 
salt. The others do 100 times more harm than good to the 
service. I modestly count myself one of the six, so that 
you can judge better what I think they are. I read Dick 
Oglesby's speech to-day. The sentiment is all right, but he 
can talk much better than that. Suppose he is out of prac- 
tice. We are a little afraid of the result of the Vicksburg 
fight. If we get whipped I'd like to die there, for I believe 
if that army is whipped it will be annihilated; and the cause 
about lost, which little event I don't care to live to hear. 
You can't imagine how careful the commanders are here 
of secesh property. Well, if 'tis through the right motive, 
I say all right, and I guess it is, but it hurts me anyway. 
I can't help hoping that this town will be burned when evac-

uated, for it is the most intensely secession place of all. It 
first unfurled the Rebel flag in this State, and sticks to its 
colors nobly. It is rumored that Van Dorn is coming in this 
direction again. I do hope he will come here, for if we can 
drive him off, it would hurt the natives so much to see him 
whipped.

There was a dose of medicine administered to the command 
in this district yesterday that will certainly be productive of 
good. I already feel that it has indued me with fresh vigor 
and really made me quite young again. "The sale or introduc- 
tion of the Chicago Times in this district is hereby forbidden 
until further orders." By order of Brig. Gen'l. J. C. Sullivan. 

That same d d old skeesicks has been protecting secesh 

property here in the strictest manner, and I'd never thought it 
possible for him to do as good a thing. It will do an immen- 
sity of good to the army, and if the President will only sup- 
press the paper and several others of the same stripe, and hang 
about 200 prominent copperhead scoundrels in the North, we 
may then hope that the army will oce more be something like 
its former self. Just as true as there is a God, if I was 
provost marshal in Fulton County, with my company for a 
guard, I'd hang at least ten men whose names I have. I know 
I'd be wrong, and would have no right to do so, but the good 
I'd do the Uuion troops would amply repay me for getting my 
own neck stretched. You can't imagine how much harm those 
traitors are doing, not only with their papers, but they are 
writing letters to the boys which would discourage the most 
loyal of men, if they failed to demoralize them. I believe that 
about every enlisted man in our regiment has received one 
or more of these letters. My boys have shown me a number 
from their friends, all of which would help to make a man 
who relied on his friends for his ideas, discontented. I assure 
you that it is by no means the lightest portion of an officer's 



154 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

duties now, to counteract the effect of these letters. I know 
that I put in a great deal more of my time than I wish to, in 
talking patriotism at the boys and doing good, round, solid 
cursing at the home cowardly vipers, who are disgracing the 
genus, man, by their conduct. I have the satisfaction of know- 
ing that expressing myself on the subject as I have, and Lieu- 
tenant Dorrance's talking the same way, have had a good effect 
on our men, for not only have we had no deserters, but the 
copperhead letters received in our company have been an- 
swered as patriots and soldiers should answer them. 

Ninth. Papers of the 6th give me much pleasure. The dash- 
ing move of the ram "Queen of the West," the gallant fight 
of our soldiers at Corinth, are certainly enough good news for 
one day. At noon roll call to-day, I spoke to my men of the 
resolutions passed by the officers at Corinth and approved by 
the soldiers, and told them that a chance would be offered 
them in a few days to vote on similar ones. They received 
the latter statement with a cheer that plainly showed their 
mind on the subject. I believe that the whole regiment with 
a proper action of the officers for a few days, will denounce 
copperheadism, even in terms strong enough to suit the Chi- 
cago Tribune. 'Twill be the officers fault if we don't. If we 
were only officered properly throughout there would never 
have been a word of dissatisfaction in the regiment. That is 
rather a solemn subject. I have advised my men to whip any 
enlisted man they hear talking copperheadism, if they are able, 
and at all hazards to try it, and if I hear any officer talking it 
that I think I can't whale, I'm going to prefer charges against 
him. Doing plenty of duty now; on picket every other day. 
Last night I had command of a guard at General Hospital No. 
i, or rather we guarded it in the day time, relieved at 9 p. m. 
and went on again at daylight. I had some friends in the 
hospital, steward, warden and clerks, and they made it very 
pleasant for me. That is they fed me on sanitary cake, but- 
ter, etc., induced me to drink some sanitary wine, beer, etc., 
and also to sleep between sanitary sheets, with my head on a 
sanitary pillow, etc., and again this morning to accept a bottle

of sanitary brandy and a couple of bottles of sanitary porter. 
All of which I did, knowing that I was sinning. I write you this

It's 1 1 o'clock now, so I haven't muh time to write. We've 
been having some trouble in the regiment this week. The 
colonel appointed Lieutenant Mattison, captain of Company 
"I," vice Medley, resigned, and Lieutenant Dorrance, cap- 
tain, of Company K, to fill the vacancy occasioned by King's 
death. The men in both companies swore they wouldn't do 
duty under the new officers, and the devil's to pay. The col- 
onel finally relieved them both from their new commands, 
doubting his right to enforce obedience until the new officers 
had received their commissions, which will probably be some 
two or three weeks hence, when the men will undoubtedly have 
to submit, even if harsh measures have to be resorted to to 
make them. The colonel has appointed Geo. Wilkinson, of 
Farmington, and Mr. WagstafF, who formerly worked in the 
Ledger office, for my first and second lieutenants. My com- 
pany have received them well, and I am well pleased with both 
of them so far. I like quiet people. I enclose you some 
resolutions which have been submitted to all the troops here 
for their adoption. We voted by companies. Company A, I, 
and F opposed them strongly, more on account of the spirit 
of dissatisfaction and discontent, which is rampant among 
them, than because of opposition to the principles they embody. 

Colonel D seems to allow the trouble in his regiment to 

wear upon him. He has not the decision I once gave him 
credit for. Wears gloves at the wrong time in handling men. 
One more case where my judgment has fooled me during my 
army experience. Can't now remember where it was correct.

You certainly have to measure men by different standard in 
the army from that used at home. Everybody thinks we are 
going to evacuate here within a month. It looks like it, but 
can't see why we should. Nearly all the troops are gone. Our 
regiment and the 5oth Indiana have to do all the picket duty. 
We are on every other day as regularly as clock work. I like 
it better than lying in camp. Union citizens say that we will 
be attacked here the last of this week or first of next, by 
forces which are now crossing the Tennessee. That's too old, 
played out, etc. There's never any danger of a fight where 
I am. One of my boys died the other day, the first I have lost. 
Typhus fever, following measles, killed him. Was a real 
good soldier. Geo. Trader by name; lived near Ellisville. I 
have two more quite dangerously sick, but the general health 
of the regiment is improving. You don't know how much I 
love these men I have under me. Not as individuals many of 
them, but as soldiers, of my company, for whose actions, and 
in a measure, health, I am responsible. Something, I suppose, 
like the love of a parent for his children. I never thought I 
could feel half the interest in the welfare of my brother man 
as I do now for these men.

The prominent rumor to-day, and one in which there seems 
to be considerable stock taken, is that Governor Yates has 
obtained authority from the general government to have sev- 
eral regiments from Grant's army returned to Illinois, as a 
kind of public police. That is, to repress copperheadism, en- 
force the collection of the taxes, etc. The sequel is: Colonel 
Babcock and Colonel Kellogg are now with Grant, bearing dis- 
patches from Governor Yates to the above effect, and figuring 
to get certain regiments, one of which is the iO3d, and that 
we will be in Springfield within three weeks. All very nice 
but etc. I know that if we are sent up to that copperhead- 
infested country we will not be used for anything but to guard

Rebel prisoners ; and I do pray to be excused from any such 
"pursuit of happiness." I would love right well to help manu- 
facture loyal men out of some of those Illinois traitors, but am 
considerably suspicious of the trip. We finally got those reso- 
lutions adopted, after a speech from Colonel Dunham, without 
a dissenting voice, though it was by no means a unanimous vote. 
Don't think that more than two-thirds voted aye, though don't 
let any of the democratic friends know anything to the con- 
rary, but that we all voted for it. The regiment is going to 

the d 1 as fast as time will let it ; though my company and 

Sid's, are all right yet, and two more are tolerable. It almost 
gives me the blues. Don't say a word of the above, but I can't 
help writing it to you. "Pis so late and I'm so sleepy that I 
must adjourn. Was on picket last night in the rain all night.

I guess it's full two weeks since I wrote you last, excepting 
a half sheet a few days ago. My reason is that it has been 
raining ever since, and my tent leaks so that (that's rather a 
larger story than I think you'll swallow, so I'll not spoil paper 
by finishing it) ; but, Scotland, how it does rain here. Com- 
mences slowly and gently, comes straight down and continues 
coming for about 24 hours in the same manner. Mercury at 
about 35 degrees. Then the wind will commence blowing, 
cool, cooler, cold. Stop the rain, scatter the clouds, and get- 
ting warm again will, in a day or so, gather the moisture from 
the surface, and probably give us one pleasant day, rarely more. 
It seems to me there has not been a day this winter when the 
sun shone, and the air was calm, that I needed a fire, and I 
remember but one day during which the mercury sunk as low 
as 10 degrees. We had two nice "falls" of snow, but they 
found they'd lit in the wrong country and evacuated in quick 
time. It can't snow here to much advantage, but I am sure 
the rest of the world could learn from this region on the rain 
question. Canton is a parlor compared to this town. Part of 
the town is on rolling ground, but the hillside seems even 
muddier than the valleys. This town is thrice the size of Can-

ton, and has ten times as many costly dwellings, but the side- 
walks and streets will not compare with yours. The arrange- 
ments of gardens is passable and much taste is shown in the 
distribution of evergreens. One gentleman living between our 
camp and town has 10,000 pines, hollies, cedars, etc., in the 
grounds surrounding his house. The grounds comprise may- 
be fifteen acres. I mean he had 10,000 trees, but the Yankees 
burned the fences around his paradise, and have in various 
ways managed to destroy a few thousand evergreens A kind 
of a parody, you understand, on that Bible story of the devil 
in Eden. Colonel Kellogg is here to-night, but goes to Mem- 
phis to-morrow where he will join Colonel Babcock. They may 
both be here again within a week, but it is not certain. He 
says we may be thankful we are not in the Yazoo Swamp or 
at Vicksburg, but two months heavy picketing here have ren- 
dered me unable to see it in that light. Our pickets have been 
fired on twice during the last two days. Nobody hurt, I be- 
lieve. We have news to-night of General Dodge, of Corinth, 
capturing some 200 prisoners and a train of wagons at Tus- 
cumbia, Ala. How I do wish we could be sent into that coun- 
try again. It's worth all the rest of the South that I have seen.. 
I have ii negroes in my company now. They do every par- 
ticle of the dirty work. Two women among them do the 
washing for the company. Three babies in the lot, all of 
which have run barefooted all the winter, and though they 
have also run at the nose, etc., some, seem to be healthy all 
the time.

You certainly should not complain of my neglect, in writing 
no more than once in ten days while we are quartered at such 
an intolerably stupid place as this, for there really have not 
been two incidents ocurred worthy of notice, since we pitched 
our tents on this ground. Never since I first entered the ser- 
vice have I passed two months in which there seems so little

worth remembering Nothing but a dull round of picket, 
fatigue, and camp guard; no alarms and no enemy within a 
hundred or more miles of us, save "citizen guerrillas," and 
they in no force sufficient to scare even a foraging party. In 
lieu of something real to talk of and speculate about, I give 
you the following items : There seems this morning to be some 
movement on foot, though I have not heard a word of the 
object which has raised such a commotion in our usually quiet 
military circles. I only know that all the mounted men sta- 
tioned here have this morning started under command of Col- 
onel Mizner, with an ammunition train and small provision 
ditto. Also hear that Dodge at Corinth and the command out 
at Trenton have set all their cavalry in motion. To make the 
case a little stronger I will add that one of Sullivan's aids 
galloped into camp half an hour since, and required at short 
notice the number of rounds of ammunition on hand. Well, 
I expect that Van Dorn or Morgan is on our side of the Ten- 
nessee again. It can't be more than that. I'd give a month's 
pay to get this regiment into a fight. Don't want it for myself 
particularly, but think it would do the regiment a great deal 
of good. The feeling is some better among the men, but there 
is still much room for improvement. Desertions are not so 
numerous, but one slips off occasionally. Colonels Kellogg 
and Babcock were both here a few nights ago. Both in 
good health, never saw them looking better Don't know that 
anything of importance was connected with their visit. My 
own health continues prime. I know that I don't fully appre- 
ciate the Lord's goodness to me in granting me such continued 
excellent health, but I assure you I do feel grateful to the 
Power that rules that matter, although I am tolerably regular 
in my habits and intemperate in none, yet I know I am very 
careless of myself and health in regard to dress, sleeping any 
and everywhere, etc. General Sullivan will visit our camp 
at 3 o'clock to-day to look into its sanitary conditions, and in- 
spect our policing. The health of the regiment is much im- 
proved. Two months more and we will be veterans. Another of

The rumors from Vicksburg in the Tribune of the 5th are 
enough to make one's flesh creep, and more than sufficient to 
account for my little touch of the blues I do feel to-night as 
though some awful calamity had befallen our army somewhere. 
God grant it may not be so ! We have another report in camp 
this evening that is not calculated to enliven me much, viz.; 
"Lawler and some four companies of the i8th Illinois Infantry 
have been captured some 30 miles east of town." In my last 
I spoke of an expedition having started out to look for some 
of Van Dorn's forces which were reported as being on the 
Tennessee river, looking for a crossing place. We don't give 
credence to the story of Lawler's being a prisoner. But if he 
is, and the Vicksburg rumor be true and we have been re- 
pulsed at Charleston, and were whipped at Tullahoma, I 
wouldn't feel half as badly over it all if our people at home 
would quit their wicked copperheadism and give us the sup- 
port and encouragement they should, as I do now when we 
are worsted in even a cavalry skirmish. For every little de- 
feat we suffer only seems to make them so much bolder, as is 
shown in every new set of resolutions which reaches us 
through the Times and the Enquirer. So that miserable David- 
son really published the lie that only one man in my com- 
pany really voted for the resolutions. Every man in Com- 
pany G voted for them and with a will, too. I don't have any 
politics in my company, although there are some companies in 
the regiment which indulge considerably in discussing ques- 
tions of State. Above all things I dislike to hear it. I am 
glad to hear that my men speak well of me in their letters. I 
think I have had less trouble in my company than most of 
the officers. Allen Roodcape, the man you sent your letter

of the ist inst. by, got here to-night. Poor fellow, he will 
never be fit for a soldier. Davidson has gone home again. The 
5oth Indiana went out yesterday morning to reinforce Law- 
ler, so we will again be on picket every other day. When it 
is here, once in three days is the rule. I was out on the worst 
post last night and it rained nearly all night. It thundered 
and lightened most splendidly. I like to get pretty wet once 
and a while for a change. It's raining hard now. I go on 
picket again to-morrow. I'm sleepy, tired, and the rain is com- 
ing through my tent so much that I believe I'll get into bed.

We leave here again in the morning for the Grange. Or- 
dered to report there immediately to relieve a regiment, the 
6th Iowa, which is going down the river. Am right glad to 
be again on the way. Can't think that we will stay there long, 
though I ought by this time to know that I have no business 
thinking anything about the matter. The Fulton Democrat 
came into our camp to-day, and that correspondence you men- 
tioned in your last has raised quite a stir. The writer is of 
course denounced as a contemptible liar. My boys this evening 
got up a little paper which will appear in the Register shortly 
(it goes in the morning by the same person who carries this) 
and some fifty of them signed it, all there were in camp. My 
company would riddle that office in a minute if they could 
get at it. Worked all day yesterday, Sunday, covering and 
chinking a picket post, and will not get another day's use of 
it. Have so much to do that I see I will have to stop this 
letter writing business.

fence which formerly enclosed the whole grounds has long 
since vanished in thin air, after fulfilling its mission, boiling 
Yankee coffee, and frying Yankee bacon. Many of the en- 
closures of family grounds have also suffered the same fate, 
and others are broken down and destroyed. The cemeteries 
here are full of evergreens, hollies, cedars, and dwarf pines, 
and rosebushes and flowers of all kinds are arranged in most 
excellent taste. They pride themselves more on the homes of 
their dead than on the habitations of the living. I can't help 
thinking that their dead are the most deserving of our respect, 
though our soldiers don't waste much respect on either the 
living or dead chivalries. Many of the graves have ocean 
shells scattered over them, and on a number were vases in 
which the friends deposit boquets in the flower season. The 
vases have suffered some at the hands of the Yankees, and 
the names of Yanks anxious for notoriety are penciled thickly 
on the backs of marble grave stones. Quite a variety of 
flowers can now be found here in bloom. I have on my table 
some peach blossoms and one apple blossom, the first of the 
latter I have seen. Some of the early rosebushes are leaved 
out, and the grass is up enough to make the hillsides look 
quite springlike. For three or four days we have needed no 
fire, and my coat now hangs on the forked stick which answers 
for a hatrack in my tent. We left Jackson the morning of 
the nth, all pleased beyond expression, to get away. We 
were from 8 a. m. until n o'clock p. m. coming here, only 55 
miles. The engine stalled as many as ten times on up grades, 
and we would either have to run back to get a fresh start, or 
wait until a train came along whose engine could help us out. 
We lay loosely around the depot until daylight and then 
moved out to our present camp, which is one of the best I have 
ever seen, a nice, high ridge covered with fine old forest 
trees. This town has been most shamefully abused since we 
left here with the Grand Army last December. There are only 
about three houses which have a vestige of a fence left around 
them. All the once beautiful evergreens look as though three 
or four tornadoes had visited them and many of the finest

houses have been compelled to pay as tribute to the camp fires, 
piazzas and weatherboarding. Not a chicken is left to crow 
or cackle, not a pig to squeal, and only such milch cows as 
were composed entirely of bone and cuticle. The 7th Cavalry 
is here, and also the 6th Illinois and 2d Iowa. There is only 
one other regiment of Infantry, the 46th Ohio. It does the 
picket duty and we are patroling and guarding the government 
stores. The duty is rather lighter than it was in Jackson, and 
more pleasant. We have no ground to complain now, and the 
paymaster is all we want to make us perfectly happy. Two 
nights before we left Jackson 23 of our regiment deserted, 17 
of whom were out of Company A, one of the Lewistown com- 
panies. One was from my company, the first deserter I have 
had. He was detailed from Company A to my company and 
was besides the most worthless trifling pup in the army. I am 
accepting the disgrace of having one of my men desert, de- 
cidedly glad to be rid of him. Johnny Wyckoff came down a 
few days ago and after being in camp a few days came to 
me and said he had his parents' permission, so I got the col- 
onel to swear him in. We'll make a drummer of him. 

I suppose you will have seen in the Register before this 
reaches you the answer my company made to that Davidson's 
lie in regard to our vote on the resolutions. I did not see 
the paper until it was ready to send away. I think copper- 
headism is not worth quite the premium it was a few months 
since. These notes from the army should have some weight 
with the gentlemen that run the copper machine. Do you see 
how the Southern papers cut the scoundrels? That does me 
much good, though 'tis mortifying to think we have such dirt- 
catchers in our State. 

Well, we are on the right track now, and a few more weeks 
and we will be steaming down the Mississippi, I think. Our 
next move will be Memphis, probably, and then, ho! for 
Vicksburg ! That is rare good news from the Yazoo. I hope 
Ross has done something there. My health is excellent, 155 
pounds of ham and crackers, for that is all I've eaten in four 
months. One hundred and sixty secesh soldiers lie as closely

as they can be packed in this cemetery. Little boards with 
initials cut on them are all the marks their graves have. Our 
boys all cut on a large board with full name of regiment, and 
residence, at the head of their graves. I send you some blos- 
soms from the graveyard.

Nine whole days of the most beautiful sunshiny weather 
imaginable. Warm as our home June, almost. The boys bathe 
in the river that runs near our camp. The little birds warble 
in the trees, the beautiful young ladies walk out to enjoy the 
gentle spring breezes. Seldom now do we hear those gloomy 
omens of cold in the head, viz. : sneezes, and nature, grand old 
mother nature, almost in human tongue proclaims this balmy 
Southern spring atmosphere, a sure cure for the wheezes. 
Poetry, my dear, is the soul of Sis, I'm getting under the 
influence of this weather, as happy as a clam, and as lazy 
as I can be, that is when I have nothing to do. I enjoy it 
intensely. Lieutenant Nick's resignation has been accepted 
and he will be at home within a few days. I send this by him, 
probably. I came pretty near having a fight a few days since. 
I had 40 men out guarding a forage train of some 125 wagons. 
There was also about 50 cavalry. We stationed the cavalry as 
pickets while the teams were loading, and 50 guerrillas at- 
tacked and drove our cavalry in (only 20 of our boys). We 
got ready for a muss, but the other thirty of our horsemen 
charged secesh and scattered them, wounding several and 
capturing two. 'Twas certainly censurable in our post com- 
mander's sending so light a guard with so large a train, which 
was over a mile long. My men showed the right spirit. That 
is the nearest to a fight any of the iO3d have yet been. 

10 p. m. I want you to be sure and get "Harpers

officers captured by pretended guerrillas. It is all true and

All perfectly quiet except the regular picket firing every 
night which here exceeds anything I ever before met in my 
experience. 'Tis singular, too, for we have a large force of 
cavalry here and I should think the rascals would hardly dare 
to venture so near them. A few days since three guerrillas 
came up to one of our cavalry pickets, and while he was ex- 
amining one of their passes the others watching their chance 
gobbled him. They at once retreated. The sergeant of the 
picket heard a little noise on the post and just got there in 
time to see the secesh disappear. He raised the alarm, and a 
party followed them on the run for 15 miles, rescued our man, 
killed three and captured four of the rascals, Yesterday some 
of Richardson's men displaced a rail on the track ten miles 
west of this place, and captured a train. They got away 
with their prisoners, but hadn't time to destroy the cars. 
'Tisn't safe to go three miles from camp now, although 
loo men can go 40 miles in any direction safely. Do you.

clamation? I hope to the Lord that my black sheep won't

and myself have been constituted by Smith a "Board of 
Survey," to appraise damages committed by our army in 
the property of loyal citizens here. I think he has just 
done it to get the citizens off his hands. Have no idea that 
they will ever be allowed anything for their losses. There 
were three bills, each over $2,500. sent in to us yesterday. 
I hope the general will allow us to drop the business this 
week; if he will not, however, we can be kept busy for 
almost any length of time. By Smith's orders the reveille 
is sounded now at 4 o'clock a. m. and the men appear with 
arms and accoutrements, and form line of battle. This is 
to avoid any bad consequnces which follow a Rebel cav- 
alry dash at daylight, if we should be found in our tents. 
I think 'tis an excellent policy to be always ready for the 
enemy, but I declare I dislike this early rising very much. 

Camp iO3d Illinois Infantry, Lagrange, Tenn., 

March 31, 1863. 

I have lost my negro, Bob. The cavalry have been in- 
dulging in a pretty rough fight near here, and I am engaged on 
a "Board of Survey" which will occupy me for some days to 
come. There is also a good quality of Scotch ale in town, no 
paper collars, and a great deal of robbing and scoundrelism 
generally. There is some kind of a scare along the line, and the 
authorities this morning shipped to Memphis some 600 negroes, 
to get them out of the way of the trouble. I made my Bob 
send his wife and children, and the scamp, when it came 
to the parting, couldn't resist her pleading, and so he joined 
the party. It is beautiful to see such an exhibition of love 
and constancy in the brute species. All of these Africans 
will undoubtedly be sent to Illinois or somewhere else. 
V I declare I don't like to see them introduced into our State, 
for they increase like rabbits. I believe will eventually 
outnumber the white race, in any country in which they 
are planted. This matter of slavery is an awful sin and I'm 
satisfied debases the governing race, but if we have to keep 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 167 

these negroes in the country, I say keep them as slaves. Take 
them from secesh and turn them over to Unionists, but don't 
free them in America. They can't stand it. These negroes don't 
average the ability of eight-year-old white children in taking 
care of themselves. There are exceptions of course ; arm all the 
latter and make them fight Rebels. They will probably be fit for 
freedom after a few years as soldiers. I received the Register 
with the letters from our regiment and Peterson's dressing of 
the Democrat. 'Tis jolly to throw stones at that paper. You 
see if they all don't get their fingers burned by that foul- 
mouthed Davidson. A decent man has no business talking 
against him, and will always come out behind. I am sure that 
he would be hung if he would venture within our regimental 
lines. One of my boys cut a great caper to-day. He is an old 
Dutchman, and has been aching for a fight ever since we left 
Peoria. He has told me several times that he had a mind to 
run off and go down to Vicksburg until the fight is over and 
then he would come back again. This morning I sent him to 
Lafayette (near Memphis) as guard for these contrabands. 
The old fellow went on to Memphis and I expect will be at 
the Vicksburg battle. I know that he won't leave me for good, 
though this act makes him liable to punishment as a deserter. 
He is a funny old dog but an excellent soldier. For goodness 
sake send me those shirts. All I have sewed together wouldn't 
more than make one long enough to reach the top of my pants. 
Any one of them would fly out over my coat collar if I'd 
stoop down. 

About 100 of the 6th Illinois Cavalry were surprised night 
before last some 20 or 30 miles north of this place. The first 
notice they had of the enemy was a volley of balls and shot 
among them as they lay asleep by their bivouac fires, about 12 
p. m. Eight were killed and about 25 or 30 wounded by the 
first fire. The 6th got up and went into the Rebels in a most 
gallant manner, killing and wounding a number and capturing 
a major, two captains and some others. The enemy numbered 
some 400, and had the advantage of a complete surprise and 
were then badly whipped. The 6th boys deserve infinite credit 



l68 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

for their fighting, and their colonel, a rope for his carelessness. 
He fought like a hero, though. 'Twas Lieutenant Loomis. I 
don't believe that Napoleon had any better cavalry than this 
brigade here for fighting. Second Iowa, 6th and 7th Illinois are 
the regiments, and well handled they'd whip the devil. Just im- 
agine the details of the above fight, and if you can't help think- 
ing that every one of our men engaged was a hero, I'll disown 
you. I'll tell you a couple of items to show you how the war 
is being conducted here now. A train was captured a few 
miles west of here a few days ago, and three prisoners taken, 
carried off. A lieutenant among them was footsore and un- 
able to keep up ; one of the Rebels, for that reason alone, shot 
him through the head, killing him. The conductor of the train 
surrendered, but a Rebel after that shot at him three times, 
when the conductor concluding it was death anyway attempted 
to escape and succeeded. This morning I saw a crowd across 
the street and walked over. Some secesh prisoners had been 
brought in, among them the conductor had discovered the man 
who tried to kill him. The conductor tried hard to get to kill 
the scoundrel, but the guard prevented him. I tell you, if 
any of that stripe of fellows fall into my hands, you'll have 
a brother who has been concerned in a hanging scrape. I'm 
as decided on that point as I know how to be. I don't see any 
prospect of an immediate fight in this country. There is no 
force except a few hundred guerrillas within 50 miles of us, 
but General Smith uses every precaution. We are all under 
arms an hour before daylight, and the picketing is very sys- 
tematical and good. The pickets are, however, annoyed more 
or less every night. These citizens are bringing immense bills 
of damages before our board. Three came in to-day amount- 
ing in the aggregate to $50,000, and more I think. To-morrow 
General Smith closes the lines at this post. No more going 
in or out by citizens. That is the best thing that has hap- 
pened before my eyes during the war. The town has been 
full of citizens every day since we have been here, and of 
course they are all spies.

I was in Memphis a few days since. It is quite a lovely 
town and quite Northern-like in its general appearance. 
Many of the blocks would pass muster creditably in Chicago, 
though the numerous fires it has furnished for the edification 
of the "Vandal Yankees" have somewhat marred its streets. I 
think the Fair grounds are not excelled even by those at St. 
Louis, and we certainly have none in Illinois that will compare 
with them for beauty, location, or in extent. There are some 
most beautiful country seats on the M. & C. R. R. scattered 
along within six miles of the city. I saw but one park. 'Tis 
called Court Square and is very pretty. 'Tis just about the 
size of our Canton square and filled with forest trees and 
evergreens. I think as many as fifty squirrels live in the park. 
They are very tame and playful. The city is full of butternut 
refugees from North Mississippi and some from Arkansas, 
but I could find none from the vicinity of Madison. The M. & 
C. R. R. is almost classical. From Memphis to Decatur, Ala. 
(that is as much as I've seen of it) you are rarely out of sight 
of fortifications, and on almost every mile, lay the remains of 
a burned train of cars. Hardly a bridge, culbert or cattle 
guard but has been burned from three to ten times and rebuilt 
as often. Night before last I had just retired (12 o'clock) 
when an order came to have the regiment in line and ready 
for action at a moment's notice. We got up, stacked arms 
on the color line, and went to bed again. Heard in the morn- 
ing that 2,500 Rebel cavalry caused the scare. We still con- 
tinue to guard against daybreak surprises by rising at 4 a. m., 
and standing at "guard against secesh" until daylight. All of 
the vigilance I like. I would hate to be surprised and gob- 
bled without having half a chance. Am still on Board of 
Survey.

I am brigadier officer of the day again, and of course it is a 
rainy, muddy, disagreeable day. Visiting the pickets occupied 
my whole forenoon and I rode through a constant rain. You 
may consider it an evidence of perverted taste, or maybe de- 
moralization, or possibly of untruthfulness in me, if I say that 
I enjoy being on duty in the rain, but it is a fact. I don't like 
to lie in bed, or sit by the fire, and think of floundering about 
in the mud and being soaked to the skin, but once out of doors, 
let it rain and wind ever so hard I enjoy it. At my request 
the general relieved me from that "Board of Survey," and I 
am again with my company. If I could but get 15 days' ex- 
emption from duty, I could finish up the drilling I wish to 
give them. Since we left Peoria we have been driven so much 
with duty that drilling has been next to impossible. The 
health and spirits of the regiment are now excellent. Such a 
body of soldiers as this now is cannot be considered otherwise 
than as a credit to even immaculate Fulton County and New 
Jersey, two Edens without even one snake. That is one point in 
which the ninteenth century beats Adam's time. Rumors 
of another move down the Mississippi Central R. R. are flying 
now. I credit them. Within 20 days we will again be al- 
lowed to strike our tents. I'm getting well over my Vicks- 
burg fever and wishing considerably in regard to this land 
movement. Before I write again the cavalry, some six to ten 
regiments, will have started on a raid of considerable magni- 
tude. You can see from the way I write that I know nothing 
of what is in prospect, but from hints dropped feel certain 
that a move with force will be made from here at once. Any- 
thing to end this horrible inactivity. Every newspaper I read 
raises my disgust ten per cent. I'm sure I'll become a chronic 
swearer if it lasts this summer through. I suppose that you 
know by this time whether the Charleston attack is a failure 
or not. I'm not much interested in that. It will cause no loss 
of sleep on my part if we fail there, only I'd like to hear of 
the town being burned. I believe there are more chances for 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 171 

a general to immortalize himself, working southward from this 
line of road as a base, than in any other part of the field. But 
where is the general? 

Camp iO3d Illinois Infantry, Lagrange, Tenn., 

April 24, '63. 

We have just returned from the hardest and yet by far the 
most pleasant scout in which I have up to this time partici- 
pated. We started from here one week ago to-day, Friday, 
and my birthday (how old I am getting) on the cars. We 
were four and a half regiments of infantry, one six-gun bat- 
tery and no cavalry. At 3 o'clock p. m. we were within seven 
miles of Holly Springs and found two bridges destroyed. We 
worked that p. m. and night and finished rebuilding the bridges 
by daylight the i8th. We had only moved two miles further 
when we reached another bridge which we found lying around 
loose in the bed of the stream. The general concluded to 
abandon the railroad at this point, so we took up the line of 
march. We passed through Holly Springs at 12 m. I don't 
believe that I saw a human face in the town. A more com- 
plete scene of desolation cannot be imagined. We bivouacked 
at dark, at Lumpkin's mill, only one mile from Waterford. At 
9 p. m. a dreadful wind and rain storm commenced and con- 
tinued until i. We were on cleared ground, without tents, and 
well fixed to take a good large share of both the wind and 
water. I'm positive that I got my full portion. 'Twas dark 
as dark could be, but by the lightning flashes, we could see 
the sticks and brush with which we fed our fire, and then we 
would feel through the mud in the right direction. Nearly 
half the time we had to hold our rubber blankets over the fire 
to keep the rain from pelting it out. After the storm had sub- 
sided I laid down on a log with my face to the stars, bracing 
myself with one foot on each side of my bed. I awoke within 
an hour to find that a little extra rain on which I had not 
counted, had wet me to the skin. That ended my sleeping for 
that night. 



172 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Nineteenth. We went down to Waterford and then turned 
westward, which course we held until nearly to Chulahoma. 
When we again turned southward and reached the Tallahatchie 
river at " Wyatt," where we camped for the night. Our regi- 
ment was on picket that night and an awful cold night it was. 
We marched through deep, yellow mud the iQth nearly all day, 
but I don't know that I marched any harder for it. Up at 
3 o'clock and started at 4, the 2Oth, and marched 25 miles 
southwest, along the right bank of the Tallahatchie. Our ra- 
tions were out by this time and we were living off the "citi- 
zens." The quartermaster with a squad of men he had mounted 
on contraband horses and mules would visit the chivalric plant- 
ers, take their wagons, load them with their hams, meal and 
flour, and when we would halt for dinner or supper, issue the 
chivalries' eatables to us poor miserable Yankees. While the 
quartermaster attended to these principal items the "boys" 
would levy on the chickens, etc., including milk and cornbread. 
Gen. W. S. Smith commanded and the butternuts failed to get 
much satisfaction from him. The first night out a "citizen" 
came to him and complained that the soldiers had killed nine 
of his hogs, and asked what he should do to get his pay. "My 
dear sir," said the general, "you'll have to go to the boys about 
this matter, they will arrange it satisfactorily to you, I have no 
doubt." "Citizen didn't go to the boys though. Another one 
came to ask pay for his hams. "Your hams, why everything 
in this Mississippi belongs to these boys, a great mistake, that 
of your's, sir." The men soon found out what kind of a gen- 
eral they had and whenever a butternut would appear among 
us they would greet him with a perfect storm of shouts of, 
"here's your ham, here's your chicken," etc., and often a 
shower of bones of hams or beef would accompany the salute. 
On the 2Oth the general decided to make some cavalry, and 
on the 2 1st at night we had nearly 400 men on "pressed" 
horses and mules. These soldiers would just mount anything 
that had four legs, from a ram to an elephant, and the falls 
that some of the wild mules gave the boys would have made 
any man laugh that had life enough in him to breathe. How 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 173 

the women would beg for a favorite horse ! I saw as many as 
five women wringing their hands and crying around a little 
cream-colored mare on whose head a soldier was arranging a 
rope bridle as coolly as though he was only going to lead her 
to water. You could have heard those women a quarter of a 
mile begging that cuss of an icicle to leave the pony, and he 
paid no more attention to them than he would have done to 
so many little chickens. An officer made the man leave the 
animal and I think the women took her in the house. I saw 
two girls, one of them perfectly lovely, begging for a pair of 
mules and a wagon a quartermaster was taking from their 
place. They pushed themselves in the way so much that the 
men could hardly hitch the animals to the wagon. But we had 
to take that team to haul our provisions. The night of the 
2oth at 8 o'clock, the general called all the officers up to his 
quarters and told us that we would have a fight with General 
Chalmers before breakfast the next morning. He ordered all 
the fires put out immediately and gave us our instructions for 
defense in case we should be attacked during the night. After 
he was through I, with eight other officers, was notified that 
we should sit at once as a court martial to try the adjutant of 
the 99th Indiana, for straggling and conduct unbecoming an 
officer and a gentleman in taking from a house sundry silver 
spoons, forks, etc. I'll tell you our sentence after it is ap- 
proved. That kept us until 1 1 o'clock. At i o'clock a. m. we 
were wakened without bugles or drums, stood under arms, 
without fires until 3, and then marched northwest. At this 
point we were only eight or nine miles from Panola, Miss. 
We marched along through Sardis on the Grenada and Mem- 
phis R. R. and northwest about 15 miles to some cross roads, 
which we reached just 20 minutes after the Rebels had left. 
'Twas useless for our infantry to follow their mounted men, 
so we turned homeward with 75 miles before us. Just look 
over and see how much sleep I got in the last four nights. 
We marched through the most delightful country from the 
time we left Wyatt. I think it will almost compare favorably 
with Illinois. We saw thousands of acres of wheat headed

out which will be ready to harvest by the I5th or 2Oth of 
May. Some of the rye was as tall as I am. Peaches as large 
as filberts and other vegetation in proportion. There seemed 
to be a plenty of the necessaries of life, but I can assure you 
that eatables are not so plentiful now as they were before we 
visited the dear brethren. We reached the railroad at Colliers- 
ville last night. That is 26 miles west, making in all some 175 
miles in eight days. The guerrillas fired on one column a num- 
ber of times but hurt no one until yesterday, when they killed 
two of the 6th Iowa, which regiment was on another road from 
ours, the latter part of the trip. We took only some 20 priso- 
ners but about 400 horses and mules. They captured about a 
dozen of stragglers from us and I am sorry to say two from 
my company, Wilson Gray and Stephen Hudson. The last 
three days we marched, every time that we would halt ten min- 
utes one-fourth of the men would go to sleep. You should 
have seen the boys make bread after their crackers gave out; 
some lived on mush and meal, others baked cornbread in corn- 
shucks, some would mix the dough and roll it on a knotty 
stick and bake it over the fire. It was altogether lots of fun 
and I wouldn't have missed the trip for anything.

Isn't the Grierson "raid" glorious? Two other expedi- 
tions started from this point and were gone respectively 
five and ten days each. Although they made good long 
marches and took about 40 prisoners and 500 animals, 
still we forget them in looking after Grierson. We have 
the Rebels well scared in this country. Five thousand men 
could sweep everything north of Jackson, if they could 
only hold it. Papers to-day give us the news on the Rap- 
pahannock up to the 4th of May, which includes the route 
of Siegel's Dutchmen and leaves Hooker in what seems to 
me a close place. Well, he can at worst but fail. What a 
consolation. General Oglesby wrote to Hurlbut to detail 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 1/5 

me on his staff General Hurlbut referred the letter 
through division and brigade headquarters for the letter of 
my company and on its return to Hurlbut, General Smith 
objected to my being detailed out of his command. He 
thought Oglesby might find his staff in his own command. 
All right! I would like to have been with Old Dick 
though. I'm on a General Court Martial now. Confound 
the Court Martials. 

Camp iO3d Illinois Infantry, Lagrange, Tenn., 

May 13, 1863. 

I have been on a General Court Martial for the last 
ten days, and we will not, in all probability, adjourn for 
some weeks yet. We tried Governor Yates' brother. He 
is Adjutant of the 6th Illinois Cavalry. Another little re- 
verse on the Rappahannock. All right! My faith is still 
large in the army, but the commanders and citizens can 
be improved. We think that Grant is going to beat them 
all yet. But his army is more responsible for his good 
fortune than himself. Do you notice that one of our 
"raids" missed fire? Straight into Georgia, I mean. Grier- 
son's and Stoneman's make up for all the rest though. We 
are constantly active here, in fact our troops move so 
much that I am unable to keep the run of even our brigade. 

Camp I03d Illinois Infantry, Lagrange, Tenn., 

May 21, 1863. 

I am still sitting on this Court Martial. We may finish 
up this week. Everything is quiet here. To-day three or 
four regiments have gone out with seven days' rations. All 
mounted. Rumors reach us daily that Grant is in a criti- 
cal situation; but I can't so see it. He has enough men 
to annihilate in a field fight all the Rebels south of this line. 
We know that he has captured Jackson, Miss., and has 
now turned his attention to Vicksburg.

'Tis becoming fiendishly warm in this latitude again; 
but the delightfully cool nights of which I wrote you so 
much last summer, are also here again, and amply repay 
one for the feverish days. We have moved our camp 
from the town to a grove on a hill about midway between 
Grand Junction and Lagrange It is one of the best defen- 
sive positions that I know of. It seems to me much better 
than Corinth, or Columbus, Ky., or New Madrid. Our 
negro troops are fortifying it. I suppose that no one antici- 
pates danger from the Confederates, on this line, any more; 
but I can understand that the stronger we make our line, 
the less object the secesh will have in visiting us. We 
are raising a regiment of blacks here. Captain Boynton, 
who has an Illinois Battery, is to be the colonel. He 
looks like a good man, but I think that a better could have 
been selected. I am afraid they are not commissioning the 
right material for line officers. Two are to be taken from 
our regiment, and if we have two men who are good for 
nothing under the sun, I believe them to be the ones. I 
know that first rate men have applied for these places, and why 
they give them to such worthless fellows, I can't see. I 
think poor Sambo should be allowed a fair chance, and 
that he certainly will never get under worthless officers. 
I suppose that the regiment organization here numbers 
some 800 now, and will soon be full. I don't know whether 
I wrote it to you or not, but a year ago I sincerely thought 
that if the negro was called into this war as a fighting charac- 
ter, I would get out of it as quickly as I could, honor- 
ably. I am by no means an enthusiast over the negro 
soldiers yet. I would rather fight the war out without 
arming them. Would rather be a private in a regiment of 
whites than an officer of negroes; but I don't pretend to 
set up my voice against what our President says or does; 
and will cheerfully go down the Mississippi and forage for 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 177 

mules, horses and negroes and put muskets in the hand's 
of the latter. I have no trouble in believing that all these 
Rebels should lose every slave they possess ; and I experi- 
ence some pleasure in taking them when ordered to. Captain 
Bishop with some 25 men of Companies A and G did a 
splendid thing last Thursday night. He surprised Saul- 
street and 20 of his gang, about 11:30 p. m., killed three, 
wounded and captured five and six sound prisoners, with- 
out losing one of our men or getting one scratched. Three 
of the wounded guerrillas have since died. Saulstreet him- 
self escaped. Over at Henderson Station on the M. & O. 
R. R. lives a Miss Sally Jones who once, when some Rebels 
set fire to a bridge near there, watched them from the brush 
until they left and then extinguished the fire. She is a 
case. Lieutenant Mattison saw her there a few days since. 
The day before he saw her she had been out scouring over 
the country horseback, dressed in boys' clothes, with her 
brother. She often goes out with the soldiers scouting, 
and the boys think the world of her. Any of them would 
kill a man who would dare insult her. She is, withal, a 
good girl. Not educated, but of fine feelings and very 
pleasing manners. Memphis paper has just arrived. Not 
a word from Vicksburg but a two column list of wounded. 
I expect that you have celebrated the capture of that town, 
long before this. All right, you ought to enjoy yourselves 
a little once in a while. There are now to my certain 
knowledge, 20,000 troops on the railroad between Memphis 
and Corinth, and there are not 1,000 armed Rebels within 
100 miles of any point on the road. Our presence at Vicks- 
burg could not help deciding the day in our favor. It 
makes a man who knows nothing about the matter, sick 
to think of the way we manage our army. Hold 100,000 in 
reserve and fight with 10,000. 

Middleton, Tenn., June 4, 1863. 

We made another little change yesterday. The regiment is 
now guarding the M. C. & R. R. from Grand Junction to

Pocahontas. We are in detachments of two companies each. 
H Company is with mine. We marched 23 miles to make this 
point yesterday, and arrived at 10 o'clock p. m. We only made 
four miles after dark, and the road was so horrible and the 
woods so thick we had much difficulty in finding it at all. We 
occupy the depot and have strengthened it by a revetment of 
fascines, so that we consider ourselves perfectly safe if at- 
tacked by even ten times our number of infantry. Artillery 
would scoop us. This little town had when the war com- 
menced some 40 houses; now it boasts of not more than 12 
or 15, though a number of extra chimneys add so much to the 
picturesqueness of the scene, that I can excuse the houses for 
"going out." This country has literally been scraped, swept 
and scoured. The guerrillas first ran the Union men off, and 
then when we came here the Unionists returned, took up arms 
and drove out all the secesh families. You can hear of mur- 
ders being committed in every neighborhood by either one 
party or the other. It will take at least 8,000 years for this 
people alone to make this country what Illinois is now, on the 
average, and at least 1,000 to bring it up to the standard of 
poor, God-forsaken Lewistown township. I have never been 
so comfortably situated in the army, except when with Colonel 
Mizner, as I am now. The boys have rigged up nice bunks 
in the depot wareroom, which are dry and comfortable, have 
good water, light guard duty, and the citizens bring in to us 
their extra vegetables, etc., and trade them for our surplus ra- 
tions. The boys give one pound of coffee for two dozen eggs, 
or two pounds of butter; sell them bacon for 15 cents per 
pound, etc. Two very fine elderly ladies pleading for a horse 
to-day, told stories of tremendous length about how "Union" 
their husbands were prior to their deaths. I'd almost rather 
give up my head than have two women of their age begging 
of me for anything that way. I have the telegraph room for 
myself and have fixed it up nicely. I know well enough that 
it is too good to last long and shall resign it without a sigh, 
and if ordered to Vicksburg, with a cheer. I fixed up our last 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 179 

camp as well as I could in hopes that my pains would bring us 
marching orders, and we got them, but the direction was 
wrong. This is so much better that it must surely win. May- 
be you don't know that there is a superstition (almost) among 
soldiers that arranging a camp particularly nice and comfort- 
able brings marching orders.

Headquarters, Left Wing i6th Army Corps, 
Lagrange, Term., 

June 7, 1863. 

We had occupied our very pleasant quarters but two 
days when an order came for us to pack up for Vicksburg. 
Received the order at dark and by daylight the next morn- 
ing we were in Lagrange. General Oglesby had moved 
his headquarters here and he gobbled me without a mo- 
ment's warning. The regiment moved on for the doomed 
city yesterday and left me. Now don't write me any of 
your "glads," for I'm almost demoralized over the matter. 
Am uneasy as the d . The idea of leaving just when I 
know that the regiment is moving on to a fight doesn't 
look at all right; but then I'm where I'd rather be than at

any other place in the army, and suppose that other 
chances will be offered for fighting. If the general had en- 
tirely recovered from his wound, I am sure that we would 
leave this railroad guarding business to some one of less 
importance in the field, but he is hardly able to stand an 
active campaign yet. Sam Caldwell, Major Waite and my- 
self compose the staff now and it is so pleasant. It's 
"Sam" "Waite" "Charley" and "general." I have been 
east on the railroad to-day looking at the defenses of the 
road. 'Twill be completed to Corinth by Wednesday next, 
when the road to Jackson and from here to Corinth will 
be abandoned. We've had another scare here to-day. 
Some 800 Rebels within a few miles of us. One of the cars 
on which our regiment was loaded flew the track yester- 
day, and one man was killed and several hurt. None of 
my company, or that you knew. 

Lagrange, Tenn., June 19, 1863. 

The general and Sam went to Memphis yesterday to 
visit General Hurlbut, and the major and I have charge 
of the machine. The cavalry under command of Colonel 
Mizner went south last Tuesday. They have a good 
sized object in view, and if they succeed will be gone 
some ten days, though they may possibly be back by 
Wednesday next. They will operate between Panola and 
Grenada. Another mounted expedition has gone from Cor- 
inth to Okolona, a third from Corinth to Pikeville, Ala., 
and a fourth also from Corinth to Jackson, Tenn., which 
place has, since we evacuated it, been occupied by some 
Rebel cavalry (infantry also reported) from the east of 
the Tennessee river. All of this cavalry (of course ex- 
cepting the Rebel) belongs to General Oglesby's com- 
mand. You see he has it in motion. Deserters are 
constantly coming in from Johnston's army; and if we 
can believe their stories, and the information gained from 
the corps of spies employed along this line, Grant's rear 
is not in as much danger as our southern brethren

would fain have us think. Johnston's army is not in 
the best condition imaginable ; and it is far from being 
as strong as he would like it. Have no idea that he can 
march thirty-five thousand men. Grant must have an 
enormous army. How awful it would be if the yellow 
fever would visit his camps. I suppose you know that my 
regiment is at Snyder's Bluff. I think that is on the Yazoo, 
near Haines. Don't you see some more of my extraor- 
dinary fortune in being detached just as the regiment is 
ordered to where there is a prospect of hard knocks. We 
were all loaded on the cars ready to move, when Sam came 
down to the train and took me. The regiment then left im- 
mediately. There is a possible chance now of the general's 
being ordered to Vicksburg; but I've given up all hope of 
my getting there. We are having a great deal of trouble 
with the citizens here. A great many secesh citizens ask to be 
exempted from taking the oath, because they have rendered 
service to our army. This one gave a quart of buttermilk to a 
sick soldier, another donated an onion to the hospital, 
another allowed a sick officer to stay in his house for only 
$2. per day, etc. A number of the claims really have some 
point to them, and although 'tis against my theory, I really 
can't help pitying some of them. We had a sad accident 
last week near this post. General Hurlbut ordered a small train 
with a guard of some 60 men to be sent north on the rail- 
road to repair the telegraph line. Twelve miles only from 
here the train broke through a little bridge over a deep but 
narrow "swash" and killed five and wounded ten of the 
party. An examination showed that the bridge had been 
burned the night before, and afterward the rails had been 
propped up only strongly enough to keep their places 
when no weight was upon them. 'Twas a fiendish, cow- 
ardly act, but of course committed by men whose business 
is robbery and murder, and who have no connection with 
the army.

Jackson, Tenn., June 26, 1863. 

Such splendid weather nice, fresh breezes ruffling the leaves 
on the trees all the day long and plenty of rain to keep the 
dust in order. I was up early this morning and the mocking 
birds were playing a reveille, from whose sweetness bees might 
make honey. There are hundreds of these birds living in a 
grove near our headquarters, and I can't find time and ease 
enough to enjoy their concerts as I want to. 

A flag of truce came to our lines yesterday on the Holly 
Springs road. The general sent me out to receive it. A lieu- 
tenant and eight men, all rough, dirty fellows, made the party. 
They were not very communicative. They brought a small 
mail and a trifling communication about prisoners. They be- 
longed to Colonel Morton's 2d Tennessee (Rebel) Cavalry, 
and were sent by General Ruggles. The general has promised 
to let me take a flag to Okolona. Don't know when I shall go. 
I do think that General Oglesby is the very ideal of a chivalric, 
honorable, gallant, modest, high-spirited, dignified, practical, 
common-sense, gentleman. Nobody can help loving him. He 
hates a particle of meanness as much as he does a bushel. If 
we were only doing something more active I should be per- 
fectly happy. As it is, I think seriously of asking to be sent 
back to my regiment. The general will not be able for any 
more field work, and I hardly think it right manly in me to 
stay back here with a railroad guard, when there is so much 
to be done in front, and I am so strong and able to bear the 
field duty. You should hear the general talk. There is such 
a big rolling river of fun and humor in his conversation. 
Such a hearty honest laugh ; I know his heart is big enough to 
hold a regiment. I believe he thinks as much of the old 8th 
as of his family. When he has been speaking of the gallant 
conduct of the 8th at Donaldson and Shiloh, I have seen his 
face flush up and it seemed as though his heart jumped up to 
his throat. I was over to the negro camps yesterday and have 
seen a good deal of them since I last wrote you. An honest 
confession is good for the soul. I never thought I would, but 
I am getting strongly in favor of arming them, and am be-

coming so blind that I can't see why they will not make sol- 
diers. How queer. A year ago last January I didn't like to 
hear anything of emancipation. Last fall accepted confiscation 
of Rebel's negroes quietly. In January took to emancipation 
readily, and now believe in arming the negroes. The only ob- 
jection I have to it is a matter of pride. I almost begin to 
think of applying for a position in a regiment myself. What 
would you think of it? We had quite an alarm two or three 
nights since. Nobody hurt, but some Tennesseans badly scared. 
I guess I will go to Memphis to-morrow to look for a spy who 
has been along our line, and whom we think is now in Mem- 
phis. Well, I must go and see the provost marshal about dis- 
posing of some prisoners. First, I'll tell you what three sol- 
diers did the night we had the alarm here. Colonel Mizner, 
with 1,000 of our cavalry, had been on a scout nine days, and 
that night we heard that he was within 15 miles of here on 
his return. We heard of the enemy about I a. m. and imme- 
diately sent these three men (volunteers for the purpose) to no- 
tify Colonel Mizner and have him march all night. They reached 
the little town, Mt. Pleasant, without incident on the way. 
There was a lot of guerrillas camped in town that night, and 
their guard hailed the boys and fired. Our men, only three, 
charged with a yell and scared the whole party out of town. 
They couldn't find the colonel and started to return. When 
two miles on the way back, at a turn in the road, they met 
Mitchell's Rebel company (60 men). Our boys yelled, "here 
they are, come on boys," and charged, firing their revolvers. 
They brought one man down, and made the next fall back 
some 200 yards where they commenced forming line. Our 
fellows then took to the woods, got around them and back to 
camp at 6:30 a. m. 

Lagrange, Tenn., July I, 1863. 

Everything moves quietly here. No more alarms or any- 
thing else to "bust" the confounded monotony of garrison life. 
A guerrilla was brought in yesterday who has murdered at 
least one of our soldiers, and an unarmed one at that. He rests 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 185 

comfortably now with a nice lot of jewelry on his arms and 
legs, and a good heavy chain connecting his precious body to 
his bed, a not very soft plank. He is a worse fellow than we 
have in Illinois to my knowledge. We have two regiments 
of negroes here now, great big, stout, hardy fellows, and they 
really look right well in their uniforms. I heard from old 
Company "E" of the 8th this morning. They have had two 
men killed and five wounded before Vicksburg. There are 
only 15 left now. Wonder where my bones would have been if 
I had stayed with the boys. 

A woman from Holly Springs is up to-day with the state- 
ment that Johnston is marching on Memphis, and proposes to 
have possession thereof within ten days. Good for Joseph! 
We had a confirmation of the report of the taking of Port 
Hudson yesterday, but nothing further to-day. It don't go 
down here without a good deal of forcing. 

Isn't it music to hear those Pennsylvania fellers howl? I 
almost wish that Lee would cut the levee of Lake Ontario, 
and let the water over that country. Don't tell father and 
mother. If Lee don't wake them up to a sense of their misery, 
he isn't the man that Price is. If ever Price reaches Illinois, 
and he swears he's going to do it some day, you can reckon 
on seeing a smoke, sure ! Don't you folks feel a little blue 
over Lee's move? Kind o' as though you wish you hadn't 
gone and done it! Never mind, you'll get used to it. The 
first raid isn't a sample. Wait until general Rebel somebody, 
establishes his headquarters in Canton, and you've all taken 
the oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. Imagine yourself 
going up to the headquarters with your oath in your hand 
and tears in your eyes to ask the general to please keep the 
soldiers from tearing the boards off your house (for bunks), 
or asking for something to eat out of his commissary depart- 
ment, and then blubber right out and tell him that the soldiers 
broke open your trunks and took your clothes and what little 
money you had, and you don't know what in the world you'll 
do. Many of these people are in this condition, and I hear

a hundred of them tell the story every week. Every man in 
Illinois ought to die on the border rather than allow an in- 
vading force to march into our State. 

Decatur, Ills., August 26, 1863. 

I write for the purpose of informing you that I am re- 
covering from that miserable attack of the jaundice. You can 
imagine nothing more disagreeable than a visitation thereof. 
Am enjoying myself first rate. Am sure I will find a letter 
from you in the office. Haven't been there for five days. Am 
nearly white once more. 

Decatur, 111., August 31, 1863. 

The general stopped me here and insists on keeping 
me for a time. Major Wait's resignation, which was for- 
warded the same time the general sent his, has been ac- 
cepted, and I now being the only member of the staff in 
the north, he wants me to stay with him, for should he 
be ordered away for any purpose, he would want some at- 
tendance. I would enjoy myself very much but for my 
biliousness. Appetite poor, miserable, sickish demoralized 
stomach, and am becoming yellow as saffron. My 
duties are not very heavy. The general has some very 
fine riding horses, and I devote some little time to exer- 
cising them. Mrs. Miner has very kindly undertaken to 
introduce me into society here, which, from what I have 
seen I judge to be very excellent. I went with the general 
to a union meeting at Charleston, about 100 miles from 
here, near the crossing of the Terre Haute and Alton and 
Chicago Branch of the Central. The general made a big 
speech, and I made a good many small ones. We stopped 
with Col. Tom Marshall while there. Had a big dance at 
night in which I participated heavily, staying with them 
until the very last moment. Train left at 2 a. m. Never 
will forget that dance in the world.

Decatur, 111., September 6, 1863. 

Girls, fun, etc., have lost their charm, and I've made up 
my mind to go back to my regiment. Reasons, as follows : 
Firstly, the general's health as affected by his wound is 
no better, and I think it doubtful whether he goes back. 
Second, if he does go to the army again he will be fit for 
nothing but "Post Duty." Will not be able for the field. 
Third, I don't like garrison work, and would rather be 
with my regiment in the field than with him in garrison. 
Fourth, my expenses are three times as heavy with him as 
with my regiment; and fifth and lastly, I wouldn't, on any 
account, miss this fall campaign, and by staying with him 
I will be apt to. I presented the matter to the general in 
about that shape and urged him to let me slide immedi- 
ately. He agreed to do so, telling me that he will not go 
back unless they force him to. 

Vicksburg, September 18, 1863. 

Left Cairo last Sabbath and arrived here this (Friday) 
morning. Am feeling splendidly. Better than for three 
months. Intended visiting you before going to my regiment, 
but know you'll excuse me. Address me 4th Division I5th 
Army Corps. 

Camp at Messenger's Ferry, Big Black River, Miss., 

September 22, 1863. 

I wrote you a few lines from Vicksburg on the i8th inst. to 
notify you that I had escaped the perils of navigation (sand- 
bar and guerillas) and of my safe arrival. I had a delightful 
trip down the river. A splendid boat, gentlemanly officers, 
not too many passengers, and beautiful weather. Major Gen- 
eral Tuttle and wife and Mrs. General Grant were of our num- 
ber. I think Mrs. Grant a model lady. She has seen not over 
thirty years, medium size, healthy blonde complexion, brown 
hair, blue eyes (cross-eyed) and has a pretty hand. She 
dresses very plainly, and busied herself knitting during nearly 
the whole trip. Believe her worthy of the general. Vicks-

burg is a miserable hole and was never anything better. A 
number of houses have been burned by our artillery firing, 
but altogether the town has suffered less than any secesh vil- 
lage I have seen at the hands of our forces. But very few 
buildings escaped being marked by our shot or shell, but such 
damage is easily repaired in most cases. No business whatever 
doing in the town, except issuing orders by generals, obeying 
them by soldiers and the chawing of commissary stores with- 
out price by the ragged citizen population. I was of the im- 
pression that I saw some rough country in Tishomingo County, 
Miss., and in the mountains in north Alabama, but after a day's 
ride in the vicinity of Vicksburg and to our present camp, I 
find I was mistaken. They call it level here when the surface 
presents no greater angles than 45 degrees. I found only one 
officer to a company present here, and the colonel is also on 
leave. There is a great deal of sickness but the health of the 
regiment now is improving. We have lost a large number by 
disease since I left the regiment. Anyone who saw us in 
Peoria would open wide his eyes at the length of our line now, 
and think we'd surely passed a dozen battles. The greater 
part of the material this regiment is made of should never 
have been sent into the field. The consolation is that these 
folks would all have to die sometime, and they ought to be 
glad to get rid of their sickly lives, and get credit as patriots 
for the sacrifice. We are now in the 2d Brigade 4th Division 
1 5th Army Corps, having been transferred from the i6th 
Army Corps. We are camped on the bluffs of Black river, 
which we picket. Our camp is the finest one I ever was in. 
There are two large magnolias, three white beeches, and a half 
dozen holly trees around my tent. I think the magnolia the 
finest looking tree I ever saw. Many of the trees are orna- 
mented with Spanish moss, which, hanging from the branches 
in long and graceful rolls, adds very much to the beauty of the 
forest. Another little item I cannot help mentioning is the 
"chigger," a little red insect much smaller than a pin-head, 
that buries itself in the skin and stings worse than a mosquito 
bite. Squirrels skip around in the trees in camp, and coons, 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 189 

owls, etc., make music for us nights. Capt. Gus Smith when 
on picket several nights, saw a bear (so he swears) and shot 
at it several times. The enemy's cavalry are maneuvering 
around on the other side of the river, constantly making it un- 
safe for our boys to straggle much over there. Sabbath even- 
ing we, our brigade, moved out across the river about four 
miles to meet a party of Rebels, but as usual they were not 
there. We ate our supper while waiting for them and returned 
by moonlight, 8 o'oclock p. m. We've had a brigade review 
and a short brigade drill, and I've eaten a very hearty supper 
since finishing the last period. I feel perfectly well once more. 
Much better than I did any day while North. Did I tell you 
that I had the ague for a week or so before I started South? 
My continued ill health more than anything else is what 
started me off for the regiment so suddenly. The general 
wanted me to stay until after the fair, but I wouldn't have done 
it for a horse. Altogether, I feel very happy over getting back 
to my company. The boys profess being very glad to have me 
with them again, and I assure you that such compliments do 
me good. I didn't know that I could take as much interest in 
any strange humans as I feel in these men of my company. 
While I was in Central Illinois I wished many times that this 
war was over, and that I could settle in one of the many good 
points I saw for trade. I know that I could do well selling 
goods in any of a half dozen towns that I visited there, and 
even in Decatur. But I know I could not be satisfied out of 
the army while this war lasts. I am glad to be out of staff 
duty for several reasons. One of the most important is that 
it costs all my pay to keep me. I did not make a cent while 
with the general, and have only two months' pay due me now. 
It has been very cold here. Night before last I had six 
blankets over me, last night five and will use four to-night. 
'Twas quite warm this p. m., but the nights are very cold. 
We will have hot weather yet. There is a great deal of 
ague here.

Messengers Ferry, Big Black River, Miss., 

September 26, 1863. 

Pass in your congratulations. We are under marching 
orders for Chattanooga. Our whole corps is going. We 
steam o'er sand-bars to Memphis, and then will probably 
"foot it," though may go by cars as far as Corinth. From 
Memphis the march will be some 450 miles. We will pass 
through my favorite portion of Dixie, the Tennessee valley 
in North Alabama. We are all much rejoiced at the idea 
of leaving a country where there is no enemy save mos- 
quitoes and chiggers and ague. We keep up the form of 
picketing; but I find it decidedly uninteresting to do such 
duty, knowing that coons and owls will cause all our 
alarms. Aside from knowing there is no enemy near, the 
picket duty is delightful here. I have seldom passed a 
more pleasant night than the one before last. The moon 
is about full, and our picket line (the post under my 
charge), about one and a half miles long, runs along the 
river bank through most beautiful little magnolia and 
beech groves and open grass plots. But a knowledge that 
there are guerrillas in the country is necessary to a thor- 
ough appreciation of picket duty. We are camped on the 
Messenger pjantalion. The owner thereof was very 
wealthy. Worth $1,000,000.00. Had some 500 negroes, etc. 
He armed and uniformed a secesh regiment at his own 
expense, and was, and is yet probably, a Rebel to the core. 
He fled at the approach of our troops, leaving his wife to 
manage for him. General Osterhaus called on her and 
asked her if she desired Federal protection. She said she 
didn't ask anything of him or any of his crew. The general 
told her she had just an hour to select and load two wagons 
with kitchen furniture and start across the river. She 
moved, was gone about a month, begged permission to 
return and is now eating government rations, which she 
is too poor to pay for.

Messengers Ferry, Big Black River, Miss., 

September 26, 1863. 

When we assembled at regimental headquarters this p. 
m., the colonel informed us that our corps was ordered to 
report to Rosecrans, at Chattanooga, and that we should 
prepare to move at a moment's notice. 

September 27. 

We sent our sick, nearly 100 in number, by wagon to 
the Big Black railroad depot, six miles, where they took 
the cars for Vicksburg. They will there await our arrival. 
1 have now but 31 men in my company in camp. Ten 
months ago I marched 72 men from Bolivar, Tenn., to 
Lagrange. Not one has been lost by the bullet, and to- 
day a difference of 41 in the duty list. A rumor prevails 
to-day that Rosecrans has had a severe battle and has been 
defeated. It is impossible to learn or hear anything in 
this place until the date alone would make it uninteresting. 
Blair's division moved into Vicksburg from the depot 
to-day to embark. Osterhaus' division is already on its 
way up the river. In the evening, with Captains Bishop 
and Smith and Lieutenant Johnson, had a rather dull 
game of "California Seven Up." All kinds of rumors to- 
day about the fight in northern Georgia. Have no hope 
of ever hearing the truth of the matter in camp. We are 
now 12 days behind in papers. The 3d brigade of our 
division and some cavalry started, with three days rations, 
on a scout across the river to-day. Suppose the object 
is to cover our move to Vicksburg, though I don't believe 
there are 100 armed Rebels this side of the Alabama line. 
The soldiers of our division have been having some high 
fun for the last two days. Orders are very strict against 
firing in camp, but the men found out they could get up 
some artificial firing by putting green can in the fire. The 
steam from the sap generating between the joints will 
make an explosion equal to a gun fired. And they got up 



192 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

some artillery firing by putting canteens half full of water, 
stopping them tightly and then putting them in the flames. 
They did this just to bore the officers who are held responsible 
by the general for all firing. To-night the general has 
ordered all the officers of the 4Oth Illinois to patrol the 
camp the whole night. This, of course, tickles the men 
hugely, and from their beds in their tents they have been 
talking over the duties of a sentry for the benefit of their 
officer's ears. The devilment that soldiers cannot contrive 
must be unearthly. To-day some of the 6th Iowa filled 
an oyster can half full of powder, set a slow train to it 
and planted it in the ground, they then set a cracker box 
over it and got a negro to dancing on the box A coal was 
then touched to the train and the "nigger" was blown full 
20 feet. He landed, fortunately, without injury, but so 
badly scared that he was crazy for an hour. In the even- 
ing called on Captain Pinney of the 46th Ohio, and spent 
a very pleasant evening. He says that Vallandigham will 
poll about ten votes in their regiment; but that his disci- 
ples dare not open their mouths to advocate his cause. 
He says the loyal men would kill them sure if they dared 
to boast of their allegiance to a traitor. 

September 28, 1863. 

By the exercise of a little strategy, this morning I 
caught a chameleon who had ventured out of a hollow 
tree to gobble some flies for his breakfast. I enveloped 
him or rather lassoed him with a pocket handkerchief and 
then slipped him into a bottle. He only showed two of 
his colors, changing from a very pretty snuff color to a 
beautiful light green. 

Clear Creek, Miss., September 29, p. m. 
As we were studying tactics together, preparatory 
to a battalion drill, our brigade commander at pre- 
cisely 2:15 p. m., came into the colonel's tent where 
we were, asked the colonel if he was ready to move immedi- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 193 

ately. The colonel replied that he was, and he then told us 
to be ready to start at 3 o'clock, and that the regiment first 
on the brigade parade ground, ready to move, should have 
the advance. In just twenty minutes we had struck tents, 
packed knaps, loaded wagons and formed line, everybody in 
the best of spirits at the thought of leaving and joining Rose- 
crans. We beat the other regiments and therefore got the ad- 
vance, which was quite an object as the dust lays, when it 
don't fly, several inches deep. I let my little chameleon (I wish 
I could have sent him home) back into the tree before we 
started. Cogswell's battery attempted to pass us on the march, 
but our two advanced companies fixed bayonets, and by a few 
motions stopped the proceeding. Cogswell got very wrathy, 
but when Colonel Wright proposed to shoot him if he didn't 
cool down, he became calmer and moved to the rear "promptly." 
The dust has been awful. Never saw it worse, except in a 
march from Bolivar to Lagrange, Tenn., a year ago. We 
bivouacked at 9 o'clock p. m., nine miles from camp. I stood 
the march splendidly. 

September 29th. 

Had just got asleep last night when it commenced 
raining. I dressed myself (that means put on my 
boots) gathered up my oil-cloth and blanket and made for a 
bushy-topped tree. I sat down to lean back against the tree and 
I think one of the liveliest motions I ever made was getting up 
immediately afterward. The tree was a chinquapin, and I had 
sat down on a number of the burs, which are much like those 
of the chestnut. After quite a search I secured two small 
rails, and balancing myself on them I slept soundly until rev- 
eille at 2 130 a. m. It has rained all night, but in a small way, 
and just enough to make marching pleasant. We made Vicks- 
burg by 7 a. m., the rain falling all the time. In fact, it has 
rained steadily up to this hour, 11 p. m. After a deal of hard 
work we are on the steamboat Diana, which belongs to the Ma- 
rine brigade. The whole division is loaded on 15 steamboats 
and we start for Memphis in the morning. I forgot to mention s. 
queer tree that I noticed at last night's camp. They say it is 



194 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

the cabbage tree or mock pineapple. The leaves were many 
of them fully thirty inches long, giving the tree a tropical ap- 
pearance. Saw some of the 8th Illinois boys. The regiment 
is not as healthy as it should be. 

Steamboat Diana, 70 miles from Vicksburg, 

September 30, 1863. 

We left Vicksburg in advance of the rest of the fleet at 8 
o'clock this a. m. I am officer of the day and have found a 
good deal to do. Our regiment and the 4Oth Illinois are both 
on board and we are somewhat crowded. Gen. W. S. Smith 
and our division commander reached Vicksburg just before we 
left. The boat he came down on, the Robert CampBell, was 
burned about 50 miles above Vicksburg, and from 30 to 60 
persons lost. The general and Colonel Hicks, our brigade 
commander, both escaped by swimming. General Smith says 
that a number of boats have been burned within two weeks by 
Rebel incendiaries and agents, the object being, by destroying 
our transportation, to make it impossible to reinforce Rosecrans 
from Grant's army. General Smith is not yet with us, and 
we think he will not follow if we go to Chattanooga, for he 
was once under Rosecrans, and they had some serious diffi- 
culty. If he does retain command of the division we will prob- 
ably stop at some point on the M. and C. railroad again. We 
all think a great deal of Smith, but would ten times rather lose 
him than have to, on his account, again go to guarding rail- 
roads. It has rained steadily for the last 48 hours, not very 
fast, but everything uncovered is thoroughly soaked. My com- 
pany was first stationed on the berth deck, but when steam was 
raised it because so hot that I took them up on the hurricane 
deck where, though they have to stand the rain, it will cer- 
tainly be better for them than breathing the hot steam. 

Griffin's Landing, Miss., October i, 1863. 
Clear as a bell this morning; about 8 a. m. we reached Grif- 
fin's landing 125 miles above Vicksbmr^;. Sa.\d Gnftm

some 2,000 cords of wood ricked on his plantation, some 500 
of which we propose to gobble for the use of our transportation. 
We found here a part of Blair's division which left Vicksburg 
over a week ago. Found the 55th Illinois, 8th Missouri and 
13 regiments among other regiments. They finished wooding 
and left about 3 p. m. 

October 2, 1863. 

Our foraging party brought in forty mules, fifty 
cattle, beef, twenty-one hogs and thirty sheep. They 
report a beautiful, rich country, and abundance of eat- 
ables within five miles of the landing. Went with party of 
bee hunters in the p. m. They had found the tree in the fore- 
noon. They took two bucketsful of most beautiful white 
comb. One of my sergeants in an hour to-day found three 
trees, and by dark had taken the honey from all of them. We 
are to stay here and haul wood for the whole division (damn). 

Griffin's Landing, October 3, 1863. 

To-day one of the pilots and engineers induced the colonel 
and me go with them over to the Arkansas side. We went 
over in the yawl, and after a walk of three miles came to a 
most delightful place owned by Worthington. His son and 
daughter, bright quadroons, did the honors of the house in his 
absence. They are the best educated persons of color I ever 
met. The young man was educated in France and the young 
woman in Oberlin, Ohio. She played the piano quite well 
and sings beautifully. A negro lady is something of a novelty, 
and if I did not conduct myself exactly right in her presence, 
I think I am somewhat excusable, for I could see the others 
were equally puzzled. She is well informed, sensible and talks 
with animation, using very pretty language. She furnished 
us with peach brandy and honey, a gentle mixture of which 
produced a very nice toddy. We then moved on some three 
miles further to the Bass plantation, where we found two of 
the regular snuff-dipping, swearing, Southern women, of the 
low, white-trash family. Had lots of fun with them. Got a

couple of dozen chickens and a bushel of sweet potatoes of 
them and started back. Our road lay along a lake and at any 
minute we could get a shot at cranes, geese, ducks or turtles. 
A drove of wild turkeys also furnished us with a half dozen 
shots, but with all the expenditure of powder and lead, our 
consciences are clear of hurting anything. Got back to Worth- 
ington's for dinner at 3 p. m., and to the boat at dark. Al- 
together one of the most pleasant days I have passed in the 
army. 

October 4, 1863. 

Have been over to Worthington's again to-day. Sam 
got out his hounds and started a deer for us. We 
stationed ourselves in the runway, but although the deer 
came near us two or three times in his circling, the dogs didn't 
push him hard enough to make him break for distant cover. 
The major killed a very large snake and some of the boys got 
a shot at an alligator. We then left the bayou and went out 
to old River Lake, where we got some splendid shooting. I 
killed a water turkey at 500 yards, shooting into a flock. Our 
guns, the Henry rifle, threw bullets full a mile and one-half. 
I found that I could do tolerably close shooting, something I 
never suspicioned before. A neighbor told me that old 
Worthington sold the mother of his children, and with her 
five other picaninnies. 

Memphis, Tenn., October 10, 1863, 4 p. m. 
Have just got here; bored to death. Had to march 
around three sandbars between Helena and Memphis. 
Never want to see a steamboat again. Never want to journalize 
again. We started at 5 in the morning for Corinth and 
then, maybe, for Rosecrans. I'll be furiously glad to get 
ashore once more. 

luka, Miss., October 21, 1863. 

We reached here the evening of the i8th inst, and I have 
been on extra heavy fatigue nearly ever since our arrival. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. IQ7 

We worked all night first night loading wagon trains and 
unloading cars. We were doing the work of another divi- 
sion, but, such is war. The impression is that we will 
leave here about the 23d. The other divisions have all 
moved on, taking with them thirty days' rations. We 
marched all the way from Memphis. Went about 20 miles 
out of our way to burn a little secesh town of some forty 
homes Mount Pleasant. We reached Collinsville the day 
after Sherman, with about 800 men, had his fight with 
Chalmers. I stood the march splendidly, and am good 
for Chattanooga at 25 miles per day. It rained gently 
three nights on this march, and one night like the devil. 
We got in that night about 9 o'clock, and by a blunder 
of our brigade commander bivouacked in a regular dismal 
swamp. We had just stacked arms when the clouds 
sprung a leak, and such a leak, the cataract of Niagara is 
a side show, comparatively. Build a fire! Why, that rain 
would have quenched a Vesuvius in its palmiest days. I 
never saw just such a night. The one we spent at Lump- 
kin's Mill on the i8th of last April, of which I wrote you, 
was more disagreeable, because colder; but in six hours 
am sure I never saw so much water drop as in this last 
rain. 

! 

luka, Miss., October 26, 1863. 

Let your pocket 'kerchief float out on the breeze, halloo 
a little and throw up your bonnet. It's only a "march at 
12 o'clock to-night" but that's good enough. We've been 
here a week now, drawing clothing and making all kinds 
of preparations for a "forward," and the blessed word has 
come at last. I don't believe anybody enjoys anything 
better than I do marching. I feel as coltish all the time on 
a move as I used to, when after a long week of those short 
winter days at school, with just time enough between the 
school hours and dark to cut the next day's wood (how I 
did work), Job Walker and I would plunge into those 
dear old Big Creek woods with our guns or skates, and 



198 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

make such a day of it that I would almost wish all time 
was cut up into Saturdays. I was on picket last night ; full 
moon, splendid post, right on the old luka battle ground, 
where the fight was the hottest; the old clothes, straps, 
cartridge boxes and litter always found in such places, the 
scarred trees, and the mounds a little further up the road, 
marking the pits where lay the glorious dead, then a half 
dozen neatly marked single graves, showing the care of 
some company commander, all tempted me to commit 
some more poetry. You know I can. But I nobly resisted 
the temptation. There were no coons or owls. I wished for 
them. My picketing the last year has almost all been in 
swamps, and I have learned to love the concerts those inno- 
cent animals improvise. When I got in this morning 
found orders to be ready to move at 12 this p. m. We 
cross the Tennessee river, I suppose, near Eastport. This 
beats me all hollow. Can't see the point, unless we're 
moving to check some of Bragg's flanking motions. Any- 
thing for a move. I put the profile of a fort here the other 
day under the direction of Sherman's engineer, and the 
chief told me if I would like it he would have me detailed 
to assist him. Have had enough of staff duty and excused 
myself. The men are rapidly becoming more healthy. I 
have but one person sick now. Dorrance arrived here a 
few days since, and brought a splendid long letter from 
you. Have to go to work on some ordnance reports now. 

Am half inclined to think that our big march is played out. 
Rather think now that we will stop at Eastport on the Tennes- 
see river. Isn't that heavy? Eight miles only and then go to 
guarding navigation on a river that's a twin sister of Big 
Creek. Can't tell though, one rumor says that we will go 128 
miles beyond the river. These generals are positively getting 
so sharp that a man can't tell one month ahead what they are 
going to do. 

One of my men who was captured down near Panola, Miss., 
last April returned to the company for duty yesterday. Some 
Confederate soldiers captured him and some citizens offered 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 199 

them $10 to each captor for the privilege of hanging the 

d d Yanks. They couldn't make a bargain. Transferred 

five men to the invalid corps yesterday. Jacob J. Nicholson 
among them. 

Florence, Ala., November I, 1863. 

We struck tents on the 2/th ult. at luka, Miss., and marched 
to Eastport, eight miles, that night. We had in our division 
some 200 wagons, all of which with 1,200 horses and mules 
were to be crossed in a barge over the Tennessee river. I 
received a complimentary detail to superintend the crossing of 
the wagons belonging to one brigade. I think I never worked 
harder than I did from 7 o'clock that night until 6 130 o'clock 
the next day, a. m. It occupied two days and nights crossing 
the whole train, but we marched at 3 p. m., the 28th, and 
camped that night at Gravelly springs, 15 miles from East- 
port. The road ran for some ten miles along the foot of the 
river bluff, and the numerous springs sparkling their beauti- 
fully clear and fresh jets of limestone water on the road, from 
which they rippled in almost countless little streamlets to the 
river, although adding much to the wild beauty of the coun- 
try, made such a disagreable splashy walking for we footmen 
that (I speak more particularly for myself) we failed to ap- 
preciate it. We bivouacked for the night at about 9 p. m. 
The morn of the 29th we started at 8 o'clock, and after ascend- 
ing the bluff, marched through a magnificent country to this 
place, 15 miles. Some three miles from here at the crossing 
of Cypress creek, something like 50 or 60 girls, some of them 
rather good looking, had congregated and they seemed much 
pleased to see us. All avowed themselves Unionists. 

There had been a large cotton mill at this crossing, Comyn 
burned it last summer, which had furnished employment for 
these women and some 200 more. This is a very pretty lit- 
tle town. Has at present some very pretty women. Two of 
the sirens came very near charming me this a. m. Bought 
two dozen biscuits of them. Have been out of bread for two 
days before, but had plenty of sweet potatoes and apples. Dur- 



20O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

ing the march on the 2Qth we heard Blair pounding away 
with his artillery nearly all day across the river, I should 
think about a dozen miles west of Tuscumbia. I was down to 
the bank the morning of the 3Oth ult. and the Rebels across 
shot at our boys, watering mules, but without effecting any 
damage. I saw a white flag come down to the bank and heard 
that Ewing sent over to see what was wanted, nothing more. 
There was some musketry fighting yesterday near Tuscumbia, 
but don't know who it was. We are four and one-half miles 
from there. Two companies of the 4th Regular Cavalry 
reached here on the 3Oth from Chattanooga, bearing dispatches 
to Sherman. He is at luka. All of these movements beat me 
completely. Can't see the point and doubt if there is one. We 
have commenced fortifying here. Have seen much better 
places to fight. We are "fixed up" most too nicely to hope 
to live here long. I have a stove, a good floor covered with 
Brussels carpet, plenty of chairs and a china table set under 
my tent. Eatables are plenty and would offer no objection if 
ordered to stay here a couple of weeks. Understand that not 
a farthing's worth of the above was "jayhawked." Got it all 
on the square. I wish I could send you the mate to a biscuit 
I just ate. 'Twould disgust the oldest man in the world with 
the Sunny South. By hemp, but it is cold these nights. Last 
night there was an inch of white frost. I was nearly frozen. 
Dorrance swears that Mattison and I were within an ace of 
killing him in our endeavors to "close up" and keep warm. 

Winchester, Tenn., November n, 1863. 
We arrived here at 9 this a. m., our brigade making the dis- 
tance from Salem, 1 1 miles, in three hours. That, we call fast 
walking. I wrote you last from Florence., Ala., on the 1st inst. 
From there we marched to Rodgersville and thence up the 
right bank of Elk river to Fayetteville, where we crossed there 
onto this place. Rumor says that we draw 20 days' rations 
here. It is three-fourths official, too. It is certain that we 
leave here in the morning, but nobody knows where for. We 
could certainly march to Chattanooga in six days, but could 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2OI 

go much quicker by the railroad from Decherd station, which 
is only two miles from here. The wagon road from here to 
Chattanooga is awful. But one brigade has ever marched it. 
The mountains commence right here and continue to, the Lord 
knows where. Our brigade is to be mounted immediately. In 
the last 60 miles marching we have mounted 800 or nearly 
half. The citizens along the road very kindly furnished all of 
stock and equipments. My company was mounted four days 
ago. Company C is to be mounted next. As fast as the men 
are mounted they are put out as foragers for more horses, etc. 
The first day my company was mounted we got 30 horses, and 
would have done better, but confound me if I could take 
horses from crying women, although I am satisfied that half 
of their howling is sham, got up for the occasion. My first 
day's foraging almost used me up. We had fed our horses 
and I went to unhitch a mule from the fence to give him in 
charge of one of the men, and the brute scared and jerked the 
rail from the fence and started like lightning. The end of 
the rail struck me on the calves of my legs and elevated my 
boots five feet. The attraction of gravitation brought me down 
to the globe and I landed with a great deal of vim on a rock 
about the size of our parlor floor, and as smooth as a peach 
stone. The only severe injury either the rock or myself sus- 
tained was a very badly sprained wrist. I got that. My left 
hip and left shoulder were hurt some, but the wrist has pained 
me so confoundedly that I don't count them. It has pained 
me so for the last two days and is so tender that I could 
stand neither the jolting of a horse or wagon. I tried to ride 
my horse this morning; we were in column and had to strike 
a trot and that beat me. Think I will be all right for the sad- 
dle in a few days, though will have a tender wrist for a good 
while. Well, our division came through in the advance and 
our brigade has had the lead most of the time. We have had 
plenty of forage, but light issues of regular rations probably 
average. Half Morgan L. Smith's and John E. Smith's di- 
visions are close up to us, will be here to-morrow. Osterhaus 



2O2 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

and Dodge are behind them. We have five divisions all told, 
probably 25,000 or 30,000 men. We met here the first troops 
belonging to the Army of the Cumberland. 

Mud Creek Cove, Jackson County, Ala. 

December 8, 1863. 

I was at Stevenson yesterday and put a letter in the office 
for you, but with my accustomed shrewdness failed to either 
stamp or frank it. It graphically described the gallant ex- 
ploits of the detachment I have the honer to command dur- 
ing the past three weeks, and its loss will be deplored in com- 
mon with the other heavy losses of this "cruel war." I can 
now but give you the topics it discussed or elaborated, and 
leave to your imagination the finishing and stringing to- 
gether the skeleton. First and foremost, stealing horses ; sec- 
ond, defying bravely the tears and entreaties of helpless women, 
and taking their last measure of meal and rasher of bacon; 
third, the splendid conduct of our regiment and brigade at 
the late Mission Ridge fight; fourth, reflections. Do you re- 
member, how, after the evacuation of Corinth one and 
one-half years ago, Halleck thought the rebellion virtually 
ended? And how many of the soldiers wrote home that they 
expected to be mustered out within three months? Then Hal- 
leck sent Buell with half of the army toward Chattanooga, 
Sherman and Hurlburt to Memphis, McClernand and Logan 
to Jackson, Tennessee; kept some four divisions at Corinth, 
and with three others opened and guarded 95 miles of railroad 
east to Decatur. That was what he called letting the army 
enjoy the rest they had earned by their glorious victory. 
The whole of the splendid army that had forced the Rebels 
to leave Corinth, was divided, subdivided and the sub- 
divisions divided until, except Buell's, there was hardly a 
detachment left strong enough to hold its own against any 
overgrown band of guerrillas. The result you know. 
Buell's retreat with his heavy losses of detachments at 
Munfordsville, etc., our evacuation of the M. & C. R. R. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 203 

between Memphis and Corinth, the driving in of our 
guards from Decatur to Corinth, and the fight there in 
October which we gained only because our side weighed 
only one ounce the most; and finally they shut us up in 
Memphis, Bolivar, Corinth and Nashville so closely that 
foraging parties hardly dared venture ten miles from the 
siege guns, and there our army stayed until relieved by 
"500,000 more." I don't like to slander so great and noble 
a man as Grant, by insinuating that he has any notion 
similar to Halleck's, but what I have seen with my naked 
eye, and heard from good authority with my uncovered 
ears, makes me think he has in his opinion at the Look- 
out, Mission Ridge, Ringgold fight, bursted the rebellion 
to flinders. I know that Sherman with six divisions has 
gone to Knoxville. John E. Smith's and Osterhaus' divisions 
are at Bridgeport on their way to Huntsville or Decatur. 
Some 12 companies of artillery, (nearly enough for a 
corps) went to Nashville yesterday, and Hooker with the 
nth and I2th Corps, are going back to the Potomac. Does 
that sound anything like active forward movements? And 
don't it sound exactly like Halleck's disposition of the army 
after he got Corinth? I predict that no good will come 
from scattering the army in this way, and much harm. 
Bragg has fallen back to Dalton, only 25 or 30 miles from 
Chattanooga, and 15 less than Beauregard ran from Cor- 
inth. The Rebel cavalry are already driving in our fora- 
gers at Chattanooga. That's all I have to say about the 
matter. Our regiment, brigade and division have gone 
with Sherman to Burnside's relief. They are probably at 
Knoxville now. All accounts agree that the regiment 
behaved splendidly; and Fulton county ought to either 
disown her soldiers or quit disgracing them by her d sh 
copperheadism. You didn't have any fears for my safety 
when you heard of the fight, did you ? Of course you knew 
I wouldn't be there. I heard three days before the fight 
that it would probably open Sunday or Monday. Tues- 
day I was out in the Cumberland mountains, near Paint 



2O4 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Rock, some 50 miles from Chattanooga, when suddenly 
we heard the sound of cannonading. I thought of our 
regiment being in the fight and my company away, and 
cursed my luck to the best of my ability. I never expect 
to be in a battle. Being shot by a guerrilla is as good as 
I will probably get. It is strange that there was only the 
one vicinity in which we could hear the firing that day, 
and 25 miles nearer the scene of action they were unable 
to hear it. We are meeting with good success hunting 
horses. We only lack about 200 of having enough to 
mount the brigade and will have them by the time they 
get back from Knoxville. My men were never as healthy 
as now. My old convalescent "stand-bys" now walk into 
their double rations of fresh meat and corn pone tremen- 
dously, and do their share of duty splendidly. For four 
weeks we have had nothing to eat but corn bread and 
fresh pork. I am beginning to like it. It positively does 
taste better every day, and I destroy immense quantities. 
When reading about the elephant browsing upon the tree 
tops, did you ever imagine what an awful crashing he 
would make? That's about like the smash I make among 
the spareribs and hoecake. I thought that when they set 
me up as horse thief, that my measure was filled, that earth 
had nothing left too bitter for me to quaff or "chaw." But 
last night a draught was put to my lips of which I drank, 
and lo, I am undone. Can't look an honest man in the 
face. Fortunately there are no honest men in this com- 
mand, so I am spared the mortification of turning my eyes. 
I was sent out to steal sheep. Can't call taking aught from 
these poor miserable citizen devils here anything but steal- 
ing. I made a pretty good haul. They go to the front 
to-day; I expect for hospital use. Of course we have to 
take them, but these citizens are on the verge of bank- 
ruptcy as far as eating is concerned. Saw Bill and Davis 
Trites at Bridgeport two days since. All right. Had just 
got back with their division from Chattanooga. Were 
both well. Captain Walsh, who was killed, was one of the 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2O$ 

finest officers in our regiment. I had formed a strong at- 
tachment for him, and mourn his loss as a dear friend and 
splendid fellow. His company, in camp, joins mine on the 
left and we were more intimate than I was with any other 
officer in this command. 

Bivouac in Mud Creek Cove, near Belle Fonte, Ala., 

December n, 1863. 

Without any earthly cause I am troubled with a small 
fit of the blues this evening. I can't imagine what brought 
it on. I am cross, restless and tired. Don't want any com- 
pany wouldn't go to see a girl if there were a thousand 
within a hundred rods. Interesting state for an interesting 
youth, isn't it. Guess the trouble must be in the fact that 
I have no trouble. Everything moves too smoothly. No 
pushing in my family to knock down a looking-glass bal- 
anced on a knitting needle. Nothing in my precious life 
to keep me awake one minute of my sleeping time, and 
nothing in the future that I now care a scrap for. All of 
that is certainly enough to make one miserable. I'm con- 
vinced that my constitution requires some real misery, or 
a prospect for the same, in order to keep me properly 
balanced. If you can furnish me any hints on the subject, 
that will induce distress, trouble, or care, in a reasonable 
quantity to settle on my brain, I will be obliged. I have 
written you so much about soldiering, sister, that I'm 
thinking the subject must be pretty well exhausted. You 
must have received as many as 150 letters from me since 
I entered the army. I have had a host of interesting experi- 
ences since I enlisted, but when I am alone, and naturally 
turn to my little past for company, I always skip the army 
part and go back to the old home memories. One finds 
a plenty of opportunities for such self-communing in the 
service, and if I haven't profited by mine, it is my own fault. 
Did I ever tell you how I love picket duty? I have always 
preferred it over all other of our routine duties, yet it 



2O6 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

would take a sheet of foolscap to tell you why; and then 
nobody could understand me the way I'd write it. So 
we'll pass. It seems a long time since I was at home. 
What do you think of my eating Christmas dinner with 
you? Don't let's think of that at all. I start for Chatta- 
nooga in the morning to get my team and things. It is 
six weeks since I have had a change of clothes from my 
valise. Borrowed a shirt from a woman once and got mine 
washed. 

Greasy Cove, Jackson Co., Ala., December 19, 1863. 
On examination of my pockets this morning, I find a 
letter I wrote you a week since. Will mail it this morning 
and tell you the late news in another dispatch. You notice 
we have again changed our camp, and you'll probably ad- 
mire the classic names they have given these beautiful 
valleys. I was at Stephenson and Bridgeport a few days 
since for our camp and garrison equipage, and was just 
starting back with it when I heard that our detachment 
was ordered to report to the rest of the brigade at their 
camp at Athens, Tenn., 40 miles beyond Chattanooga. So 
I left my traps and came back to move. We will start as 
soon as our parties get in from scouting. The last party 
that went out and returned was some 200 strong. Dor- 
ranee had 20 men from our detachment. They brought in 
a splendid lot of horses, but had to go 75 miles for them. 
The guerrillas killed one man of the party, (46th Ohio) 
and captured a number, maybe 15. Picked them up one, 
two or three at a time. Dorrance was captured and pa- 
roled by some of Forrest's men. He was pretty well 
treated, but the parole amounts to nothing. They took 
nearly all of his money, his arms, spurs, horse, etc. He 
was the only one of my men captured. It is confounded 
cold lately and I haven't been real dry for three days. We 
have to swim creeks to go anywhere, and there is so much 
brush and drift in these streams that a horse will always 
get tangled and souse a fellow. I swam a horse across 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2O/ 

a creek yesterday, and he went over on his hind legs stand- 
ing straight up. I never saw such a brute. Rumor says 
we will be dismounted and go with the corps to Mobile. 
But. the most probable story is that we are going into camp 
at Athens for the winter. Would much rather go to Mo- 
bile but think that we can't be spared from here. 

Near Larkinsville, Ala., December 29, 1863. 
We have had some busy times since my last. Foraging 
for horses, looking for something to eat, and trying to obey 
a host of contradictory orders, has kept us in the saddle 
almost constantly. I believe I wrote you about Dorrance's 
going over to Elk river, Tenn. for horses and getting 
captured. When the next scout was ordered out, I was at 
Bridgeport on business, and Lieutenant Smith went in 
charge. They were absent a week and when I heard from 
them, and that they had but seven extras, I started after 
them and found them 25 miles from camp. That night I 
got permission from the officer in command to take 20 
men and be absent two days. I went over the mountain 
into Madison county near Huntsville, got 34 good horses 
and was back on time. I also captured a guerrilla with 
his horse and traps, and found a lot of clothing which had 
been taken from Federal soldiers and officers captured by 
Rebels and concealed in a hovel on the mountain. In the 
round trip of the last six days, about 150 miles, the boys 
have destroyed at least 50 shotguns and rifles. To-day, 
an officer of Ewing's staff is here selecting our best horses, 
for the use of Sherman, Logan, etc. We think it con- 
foundedly mean, but guess we'll stand it. We have enough 
horses to mount the brigade, but there is some doubt about 
that little event taking place. They can't beat me out of 
being satisfied whatever they do. Would rather remain 
mounted, but Sherman's will be done. I have turned into 
the corral fully my proportion of horses, haven't lost a 
man, and none of my command have been guilty of rob- 
bing, plundering, or stealing. That's what the officer of 



2O8 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

no other detachment here can say, truthfully. I do think 
I have the best lot of men that ever soldiered together, and 
there are now 41 for duty. The rest of the brigade is at 
Scottsboro, only six miles from here, and they will proba- 
bly go into winter quarters there. Possibly, at Belle 
Fountain. I am in splendid health and enjoying myself 
excellently. My wrist is improving slowly, but there is 
something broken about it. It will, however, answer my 
purpose if it gets no worse. One ought occasionally to 
have something of that kind in order to a better apprecia- 
tion of our many blessings. What wonderful luck I have 
soldiering, don't I? Now, in our two month's foraging, I 
haven't lost a man. Only one wounded a little, and one 
man and Dorrance captured and let go again. In the same 
time the I5th Michigan have lost about 20. The 46th 
Ohio have had two killed, the 6th Iowa two killed, and the 
4Oth Illinois two hung and two missing. We have been 
over all the country they have, and done just as much 
work, without losing a man. I am hopeful of obtaining 
some recruits from the Fairview country, but can get 
along without them.. Have as good as been out of the 
world for two months. I haven't worn socks since I left 
Memphis. Too much trouble. Has rained steadily for the 
four last days. I have ridden from daylight until dark 
each day. Got dried off to-day for the first time. Swam 
our horses over three bad creeks. Lieutenant Smith and 
three men came very near drowning. My mare swam 
splendidly. 

Scottsboro, Ala., January 5, 1864. 

Your brother no longer represents the Festive Mama- 
luke, but has returned from his paradise of fresh pork, 
cornbread, honey, milk, and horse, to his original heavy 
infantry exercise, his nix-Grahamite diet of army rations,

in short, to the elysium of the enlisted men, and purgatory 
of company commanders winter quarters. In short, the

powers that be concluded that dismounting us would not 
render the salvation of the Union impossible, and as the 
detachment was getting a very hard reputation, and 
making much trouble for said powers to settle, 'twas de- 
cided to unhorse us. It's all over now, the mounting part 
has "played" and that string will not probably be harped 
on again for this brigade to dance to. I think that to-day, 
Sherman, Logan or Ewing would not trust a detachment 
of this brigade on sorebacked mules if they had only three 
legs. This little squad of 500 men in the two months they 
have been mounted have committed more devilment than 
two divisions of regular cavalry could in five years. 
Everything you can think of, from shooting negroes, or 
marrying these simple country women, down to stealing 
babies' diapers. From taking $2,700.00 in gold, to snatch- 
ing a brass ring off the finger of the woman who handed 
a drink of water. From taking the last "old mar" the 
widow had to carry her grist to mill, to robbing the bed 
of its cord, for halters, and taking the clothes line and bed- 
clothing "to boot." I'll venture that before we were dis- 
mounted, not a wellrope, tracechain, or piece of cord of any 
kind strong enough to hold a horse could be found in the 
districts through which we have foraged. I want you to 
understand that my command is not responsible for the 
heavy devilment. I have steadily discountenanced it, and 
watched my men carefully. I am willing to be responsible 
for all they did, and will probably have a chance, as I 
understand a board of inquiry sits on the subject shortly. 
Some of the officers will, I think, have cause to wish they 
were never mounted; and to think that "Mission Ridge" 
would have been preferable to the duty they have been on. 
We had been looking for General Ewing out to our biv- 
ouac to review us for several days, and I rather saw in the 
distance that dismount was an order we'd get shortly, and 
had sent in to our colonel, lieutenant colonel and staff some 
of my best horses, knowing that if we got dismounted they 
would be taken by Sherman, Logan or Ewing. Sure enough, 



2IO ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

on the morning of the New Year's day came an order to 
form to be review by some heavy staff. The review con- 
sisted in their picking out what good horses there were, turn- 
ing the rest into a corral, and sending us to our regiments 
on foot. We got here the same day, found the regiment just 
pitching camp, with the idea that winter quarters or a good 
long rest, at least, was their portion. Our company already 
has good comfortable quarters up, and is as well fixed for 
winter as we care about being. But already we hear it ru- 
mored that our division is to move down to Huntsville in 
a short time, and we have had no orders to prepare winter 
quarters. All right. It has been pretty cold here although 
we have had no snow nor ice that could bear a man. A great 
deal of rain. The regiment is very healthy. Not a dozen men 
complaining. My wrist is improving slowly. Not worth very 
much yet. Doctor says 'twill take it a year to get well. That 
bone at the wrist joint protrudes considerably. All right. 
The veteran feeling is "terrific" here. Three regiments in 
our brigade the only ones eligible (that is that have been in 
two years) have re-enlisted almost to a man. 4Oth Illinois, 
46th Ohio and 6th Iowa. In our division there are seven 
regiments eligible and all have re-enlisted, and are going home 
in a few days. It is, I think, the grandest thing of the war. 
These old soldiers so enthusiastically and unanimously "going- 
inimously." I guess no one is more astonished at it than the 
very men who are enlisting. One of the 4Oth boys told me that 
"about 15 of us were talking about it and cussing it, until 
every son of a gun of us concluded to, and did re-enlist." Our 
regiment hasn't been in long enough to make veterans. 
Wouldn't you rather have me stay in service until this war 
ends? I get the blues, though, sometimes, and think of get- 
ting out and denying that I ever was in the war. Haven't I 
a brilliant record, Thirty-three months in service and not a 
battle. 

Clear and cold this morning. I'm very comfortable. Have 
built me a brick fireplace and chimney, raised my tent two 
and one-half feet on a broad frame. Made me a good bed 
with broom sage for soft, and am living high. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 211 

I received three recruits yesterday and have at least one 
more coming. I have more men for duty than any other 
company. Night before last two Confederate soldiers came 
into our camp and stole three horses, two of them belonging 
to our surgeons, and the other to the adjutant. The Rebels 
crossed the Tennessee river, which is only four miles from 
here and recrossed safely with their horses. I call that pretty 
sharp. The horses were only about 30 yards from where I 
sleep. They might just as well have got me. I feel highly 
complimented by their prefering the horses to me. We had 
one-fourth of an inch of snow last night. Gone now. Yes- 
terday three teamsters, belonging to Logan's headquarters 
while foraging went to pillaging a house. The woman of the 
house tried to stop them, when one of the fellows struck her 
on the head with a gun and killed her. This was about three 
miles from here. 

Scottsboro, Ala., January 9, 1864. 

We' have settled down into fully as monotonous a monot- 
ony, as I ever experienced. The powers pretend that the army 
is tired down and needs rest, so duty is very light, no drills 
ordered; no scouting and no nothing, but a first-class prep- 
aration to have a tremendous sick list in a very short time. 
You know how we have been moving for the last three 
months, and that we have hardly suffered a half dozen cases 
of sickness. Now see, if we lie here four weeks longer, if I 
don't report you 60 on the sick list. Do you think that I am 
something of a grumbler? Either having too much travel, or 
too much lie still. Too much to eat (I guess not) or not 
enough, etc. I suppose that news here is about as scarce as 
ice cream on the African desert, and of nearly the same 
quality. We are camped in the edge of dense woods, about 
three quarters of a mile from the town, which consists of 20 
or 40 rather neat houses, and presents, I think a better ap- 
pearance than any other town of the size I have seen in the 
Confederacy. It hasn't been squashmolished like most of its 
sisters. General Logan's headquarters are here. Our corps 

14 



212 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

is camped along the road from here to Decatur, our whole 
division being here. Our division commander, is, I expect, 
the most unpopular officer with his corps that there is in the 
West. I never knew his match for meanness. See if I can 
think of all I have been ordered by: Prentiss, Grant, Logan, 
McClernand, Wallace (W. H. L.), Oglesby, Paine, Pope, 

Granger, Palmer ( ) formerly colonel nth Missouri., 

Rosecrans, Morgan, Buford, Sheridan, Hurlbut, Lanman, 
Hamilton ist, Hamilton 2d; Sullivan, Lawler, Sooy Smith, 
Ewing, Corse, Halleck, Sherman, Davis, and at least two 
more whose names I can't now recall. One of them com- 
manded this division last March, and the other the 4th Divi- 
sion 1 6th Army Corps, last December, for a few days. I 
have lots of work on hand writing up my accounts, but this 
lying still begins to bore me awfully. I though a few weeks 
ago that 'twould be very nice to have a tent again, and things 
somewhat comfortable, but the beauties of the thing don't last 
long. I'm ready to move now. We have had several pretty 
cold days, but to-day I have been in my shirt sleeves, without 
vest, all day, and felt very comfortable, though it didn't thaw 
very much, and I believe there was ice in our water bucket all 
day. Expect you are having a gay time this winter at home 
sleighing, dancing, etc., but I would rather take mine out in the 
army. If I didn't have any happy Christmas myself, I had 
the pleasure of smashing the happiness out of a good many 
secesh Christmases. That's not so. It was not pleasure, but 
I had to. 

Steamer "Cosmopolitan," bound to Beaufort from 
Savannah, Ga., 

January 21, 1864. 

I was at Beaufort some three days when I received a de- 
tail on a "military commission" to sit at headquarters, 4th Di- 
vision of our corps at Savannah. Reported at Savannah on 
the 1 7th and found my commission had finished its business 
and adjourned, all of which satisfied me. Have been ever

since trying to get back to the regiment, but all of the vessels 
which run on this line have been in use as lighters, transfer- 
ing the 1 9th Corps (which now occupies Savannah) from the 
large steamers which have to stop at the bar up the river. 
This 1 9th Corps is a portion of Sheridan's command and 
helped him win those glorious victories in the valley. They 
are a fine soldierly-looking body of men, but have already had 
some difficulty with our troops. As I left the city I saw the 
wind up of a snug little fight between a portion of the 2Oth 
and 1 9th Corps. Noticed about 40 bloody faces. All this 
kind of work grows out of corps pride. Fine thing, isn't it, 
We left the wharf at 2 p. m. yesterday, grounded about 5 
p. m., and had to wait for high tide, which came at midnight ; 
then a heavy rain and fog set in and we have made little prog- 
ress since. Are now, n a. m., at anchor, supposed to be near 
the mouth of Scull Creek waiting for the fog to clear up. I 
am terribly bored at being away from the regiment so long. 
I feel lost, out of place and blue. What glorious news from 
Fort Fisher, and what a horrid story that is about 13 out 
of the 15 prisoners the Rebels had of our regiment, dying of 
starvation. One of them, W. G. Dunblazier, was of my com- 
pany, and a better boy or braver soldier never shouldered a 
musket. He was captured on the skirmish line at Dallas. 

May 27, '64. Dr. Buck is on board with me just from the 
North. He is terribly disgusted with the service, and furn- 
ishes me some amusement. I believe I take as much pleas- 
ure in seeing other people miserable over small matters 
as I do in a good thing for myself. 

12 a. m. Have just been badly beaten at cribbage by Col- 
onel Bloomfield, and the boat is under way again, the fog 
having gone up. 

Scottsboro, Ala., February 7, 1864. 

This has indeed been a day of rest. More like a home Sab- 
bath, than the Lord's day often seems, here in the "show 
business." None of my company have been on duty, and as 
the day has been bright and warm, the men have been nearly 



214 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

all out in front of the quarters ; all looking natty and clean 
and healthy, sunning themselves real country-Sunday fashion. 
Seems to me that I grow prouder every day of being captain 
over these men. If I could only get 30 good, healthy recruits, 
I expect I'd have to be "hooped." The boys brought a fiddle 
in with them yesterday from our Lebanon march, and as 
nearly all of them play, "more or less," it has seen but little 
rest to-day. Every man I have present (42) is for duty, anu 
if there are any soldiers in the army who can outmarch them, 
or do duty better, "I want them for Babcockses," as the boys 
say. Frank Post was in my tent to-day, and informed me that 
in her last letter, Laura told him that some horrible stories 
of my cruelty to women and children while in command of 
the mounted detachment, were in circulation at home. He 
wanted me to trace the author of them, but I respectfully 
begged to be excused. The person who told such stuff, falsi- 
fies; for I never killed a fly, or stepped on a worm, or kicked 
a dog, or threw a stone at a cat, and know I wouldn't treat 
a woman or child worse, if they were Rebels. I do take a 
little private satisfaction in knowing that I have never said 
a word, except respectfully, to any woman in the Confeder- 
acy, that I have ever touched a cent's worth of private prop- 
erty for my own use. We, with 600 more of our brigade, 
had to take horses and rations from a poor set of people, but 
that was no more our fault than the war is. Those pretty 
crystals I sent you by Lieutenant Dorrance, are "Iceland 
Spar," which is, I believe, the only stone which possesses the 
power of double refraction. If you put a thin piece of it over 
a black mark on paper, and look closely, you will see two 
marks ; try this piece which I enclose. I took a lesson in chess 
last night, played a couple of games. Don't thing I would 
ever make a player. Colonel Dickerman is at present com- 
manding the brigade, and Major Willison the regiment, Lieu- 
tenant Colonel Wright being on detached service as a divi- 
sion inspector general. Mattison is in his quartermaster de- 
partment almost constantly, and Dorrance's absence leaves 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

me quite alone. Dorrance was in a way, good company. Al- 
ways in a good humor and talking. Real accommodating, too, 
if carefully handled. 

I went to the nearest house to camp to-day, to beg a little 
piece of tallow to soften a pair of marching boots. I sat down 
by a fire, in company with three young women, all cleanly . 
dressed and powdered to death. Their ages were from 18 to * 
24. Each of them had a quid of tobacco in her cheek about 
the size of my stone inkstand, and if they didn't make the ex- 
tract fly worse than I ever saw it in a country grocery, shoot 
me. These women here have so disgusted me with the use 
of tobacco that I have determined to abandon it. Well, we are 
again under orders to march at a moment's notice. Received 
them about noon to-day, and expect to start in the morning. 
It is intimated that we go to Chattanooga, first, and then 
either to Dalton, Knoxville, or garrison Chattanooga, and let 
its present occupants go. I was much pleased to get the or- 
ders, for above all things, do hate a permanent camp. I en- 
joy the tramping, the mud, the cold, and being tired, and 
everything mean there is about soldiering, except being hun- 
gry. That beats me to a fraction. If I could only go without 
eating three or four days at a time I would pass as a soldier, 
but bless me, missing a meal is worse than drawing a tooth. 
I never tried it as long as I have been in the army, but it 
seems to me that putting me on quarter rations would be 
equivalent to putting me in a hospital bed. 

Hurrah for the march. No such place for real fun else- 
where. We have our regular races, and tough ones they are, 
too, sometimes. Each regiment takes its turn in having the 
advance, one day at a time. Say, to-day we have the lead, 
then to-morrow we will march behind all the rest, and the next 
day the regiment which succeeded us in the lead will fall 
behind us, etc. It is a great deal easier to march in front 
than in the rear, because in passing defile, or crossing streams 
on single logs, all of the time that is lost falls, finally, on the 
rearmost regiment, and after it crosses it sometimes has to 
double-quick it a mile or more to catch up again. A com- 



2l6 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

mon time step or 90 to the minute, in front with a brigade of 
1,500 over the average of these roads, makes the rear in 
order to keep up, take more than quick time, or over 112 
steps to the minute, during their marching time. So you can 
imagine our races, though fun to the advance, make the rear 
work no laughing matter. The point of the race is for the 
advance regiment to move so fast that the others will break 
up, tired out, and straggle. Yesterday the 97th Indiana coming- 
in had the lead and undertook to run us. We had the rear, 
but by not waiting to cross on logs, but wading through 
creeks up to our knees or middles kept at their heels for 8 
miles without a rest. 'Twas raining all the time and the 
roads were awful slippery. Our brigade tried hard to run us 
down at first, but now none of them doubt our ability to 
march with any regiment. When the men are resting along 
the road they have a great fashion of making remarks about 
any strange soldier or citizen who passes. As we were rest- 
ing on the 5th inst, a bare-footed, sick-looking soldier came 
hobbling through. One man said, "He's sick, don't say any- 
thing to him;" another said, "No, he's shod a little too 
rough ;" another, "Yes, and he interferes ;" another, "Keep 
still he's slipping upon something;" another, "He's showing 
us how Fanny Elssler went over a looking glass;" another, 
"Come here and I'll take the pegs out of your shoes," etc. 
Wouldn't that be interesting to the passerby? 

Scottsboro, Ala., March 6, 1864. 

By marching 21 miles on the railroad ties we reached 
"home" yesterday, after an absence of 24 days, in which 
we traveled 280 miles. Altogether it was a very pleasant 
trip, although the first 10 nights were almost too cold for 
outdoor sleeping. I kept a "sort" of a diary of this trip in a 
memorandum book, and being too lazy to copy, tore out 
the leaves and mailed to you. You should receive three 
letters of that kind. One about the "Wills Valley" trip, 
one of the march from here to Cleveland, and the third 
of the trip from Cleveland to Dalton and back. The rain 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 21 7 

was pouring down when we received orders to start home 
from Chattanooga and it rained almost until night. We 
marched 16 miles without a rest, and did it in five hours. Did 
exactly the same thing next day, although it did not rain. 
This was from Oltewah to Chattanooga. In addition to 
this march I took a look over the part of Mission Ridge 
where our regiment fought, and also climbed Lookout 
mountain. The iO3d, the brigade they were with, un- 
doubtedly got the hottest part of the whole Lookout, and 
Mission Ridge fight. The nature of the ground was such 
that not a shot was fired by either side until they were 
within 200 yards of each other, when our men charged. 
Some of our boys were killed a little to the right of, but 
on a line with the Rebel guns. The trees and shrubs show 
marks of extraordinary hot musketry work. I cut a 
hickory walking stick right where our men commenced the 
charge. This hickory stood by an oak that I should think 
was hit by 400 musket and canister balls. It helped me 
later in the day to climb Lookout Mountain. I think the 
view from Lookout worth 1,000 miles travel. The high 
mountains of Western North Carolina, and the Blue 
Mountains of Virginia are very plainly seen from the sum- 
mit. There is a summer retreat, some 40 or 50 nice houses 
with public hall and school on top. 

Scottsboro, Ala., March 15, 1864. 

I am again on court martial duty, with a prospect of a 
long siege ; but we have an experienced President and 
a Judge Advocate who promises to be a fast worker; so 
we may get through quicker than we anticipated. The Presi- 
dent, Colonel Heath, looth Indiana, is a Bob Ingersoll for 
the world, that is, full of anecdote and fond of malt. 'Tis 
probably fortunate that at this time none of the latter is 
to be had in our division. I dislike detached service in 
any shape, but prefer court martial duty to almost any 
other. Would much rather be with my company, and if 
it were not considered so nix military would ask to be 



2l8 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

relieved from this. You can't imagine how proud I am 
becoming of my company. I have never had an iota of 
trouble with them. We certainly work as smoothly as any 
company could. We are all in high feather over the pros- 
pect of going to Richmond. Everybody wants to start 
immediately. If the i$th and i/th corps reach the 
Rapidan, we doubt your hearing anything more about 
recrossing the Rapidan and taking positions inside the 
Washington fortifications. Our corps don't get along well 
with these Cumberland and Potomac soldiers. To hear 
our men talk to them when passing them or their camps 
marching, you'd think the feeling between us and the 
Rebels could be no more bitter. We are well off by our- 
selves, but still we don't feel at home. We're too far from 
our old comrades, I3th, i6th and I7th Corps. This feeling 
that grows up between regiments, brigades, divisions and 
corps is very strong and as strange. The 4th and I4th 
Corps Cumberland chaps our men can endure, although 
much in the spirit a dog chewing a bone, allows another 
to come within ten feet. The nth and I2th Corps Poto- 
mac men, and ours never meet without some very hard 
talk. I must do the Yankees the justice to say that our 
men, I believe, always commence it, and are the most un- 
gentlemanly by great odds. I do honestly think our corps 
in one respect composed of the meanest set of men, that 
was ever thrown together. That is, while on the march 
they make it a point to abuse every man or thing they see. 
They always feel "bully," will certainly march further with 
less straggling, and make more noise whooping than any 
other corps in service, but if a strange soldier or citizen 
comes in sight, pity him, and if he's foolish enough to ask a 
question, as "what regiment," or "where are you bound for?" 
he'll wish himself a mile under ground before he hears all the 
answers, and ten to one not a whit of the information he 
asked for will be in any of them. We have no pay yet, 
and no prospects now, but doing good business borrowing.

Scottsboro, Ala., March 12, 1864. 

I have been tremendously demoralized for nearly a month 
in consequence of a terrible cold I caught by some of my care- 
lessness, I suppose, but am now coming out of it all right. 
Weather is most beautiful. Not too much duty, excellent 
camp, remarkably good health, and everything so near right, 
that almost think a soldier who'd grumble here deserves shoot- 
ing. Were I disposed to complain am sure I could only find 
two little topics whereof to speak; one being the fact that 
'tis impossible to get anything to eat here excepting regular 
army rations, not even hams can be had, and the other the 
long-continued absence of the paymaster. We are hoping 
that both these matters will be remedied 'ere long, but have 
been so hoping for months. We have a division purveyor 
now, who pretends that he will furnish us in good eatables. 
We have had but a few articles from him, and I'll tell you the 
prices of those I remember. Can of strawberries, $1.75; 
cheese, 80 cents a pound; bottle (about one and one-half 
pints) pickled beets, $1.50. If I could draw the pay of a brig- 
adier general, and then live on half rations, think I might come 
out even with said purveyor for my caterer. 

Everything perfectly stagnant. We did hear day before 
yesterday some quite rapid artillery firing for an hour or two ; 
it sounded as though it might have been some ten or twelve 
miles southwest of us. 'Twas reported by scouts a few days 
ago that the enemy was preparing flatboats at Guntersville 
to cross the river on, with intent to make a raid up in this 
direction or toward Huntsville. The I5th Michigan Mounted 
Infantry was sent down to look after the matter, ran 
into an ambuscade and lost a dozen or so killed and 
wounded. That's all I heard of the matter. We were very 
sorry that the loss was so light, for they are a miserable set. 
We are going to have a dance here in a few days. Think 
I'll go. Anything at all to get out of camp. I'm as restless 
as a tree top after marching so much. You don't know how 
tame this camp business is. Am afraid I will get the "blues" 
yet. Hurry up the spring campaign, I say. 



22O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Scottsboro, Ala., March 20, 1864. 

What under the sun can I tell you that will interest you. 
That it is intolerably dull, bah ! Have just had a long visit 
from Lieutenant Colonel Wright, now army assistant inspector 
general of the division, and Lieutenant Van Dyke, A. D. C., 
to our new commander, General Harrow. The lieutenant is 
a splendid looking fellow of about 23 years, and has served 
up to the time of coming into our division with the 2d Corps, 
Army Potomac. Van Dyke informed me that a despatch from 
Logan was received by Harrow this a. m., informing him that 
Forrest was prowling around on the other side of the river 
with intention of crossing and making a little dash on some 
part of our line. "Our" railroad from Nashville via Decatur 
is about completed (will be finished to-morrow) and then 
we hope to have something to eat once more. This rail- 
road will be all for our corps, or at least we will get the 
choice of what comes over it. We are at outs with the 
general to-day. In the field we are not accustomed to 
having camp guard, considering a strong picket and the 
regular property alarm guards sufficient. But because two 
or three men got drunk yesterday, and a gun or two was 
fired, out comes Harrow in an order and requires a strong 
camp guard. It may be one of the faults of our discipline, 
but 'tis a fact that our men would much prefer two days 
of any other duty, to one of camp guard. Our court gets 
on slowly. Oh ! We had a dance a few nights since. 
Northern ladies, officers' wives, and a few "Mountain 
Ewes" (the poetical name given the Jackson county beau- 
ties by some genius of a Yankee). We really had a 
delightful time; and I understand they are to be continued, 
one every two weeks Anything to keep a man from 
getting blue. I see Abraham calls for 200,000 more. 
Keep asking for them Lincoln, that's right, I'm sure 
there are yet many who can be spared for their country's 
good in more meanings than one. It's queer that our regi- 
ment don't get more recruits. We need them very much, 
and yet I dread getting them, they are so much trouble 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 221 

for a year. The 26th and 48th Illinois have respectively 
200 and 500 and the officers are bored terribly over them. 
There is to my eye, as much difference between the aver- 
age of recruits and the average of veterans, as there is between 
the physique of a tailor and that of a blacksmith. Some 
of the veterans who have returned to camp, are sick of 
their last bargain with the United States, but the majority 
are right glad to get back. 

Scottsboro, Ala, March 24, 1864. 

Two months and twenty-four days without changing 
camp; which is the longest time our tents have covered 
one piece of ground since we organized. We have 
marched, though, some 35 days during this time, and some such 
marching. Whew ! I think I never suffered on a march as 

1 did on the Sand Mountain in DeKalb county. I wore 
a thin blouse, and had no overcoat. I'd lie so close to the 
fire nights that the clothes on my back would scorch and 
my breath would freeze on my whiskers. We had nothing 
to keep the freezing dews off us, and it seemed to me 
that it went through my clothes and an inch of flesh 
before the dew-point would be blunted. One night about 

2 o'clock I had a huge pine knot fire and was trying to 
warm some half frozen portions of my body, when Cap- 
tain Smith came over from his bed, as blue as a conscript, 
to thaw out. He turned one side and then t'other to the 
blaze, time and again but without much progress; finally 
he shivered out, "By G d, Captain, I could wish a tribe 
of cannibals no worse luck than to get me for breakfast. 
I'm frozen hard enough to break out half their teeth, and 
the frost would set the rest aching." Next morning a lot 
of us were standing by a fire nearly all grumbling, when 
the major asked me how I passed the night. "Capitally, 
slept as sweetly as an infant, little chilly in fore part of 
night, but forgot it when sleep came." They looked so 
pitifully, doubtfully envious, that I got me laugh enough 
to warm me clear through. Captain Smith, Soot and Lieu-

tenant Ansley have been in with me playing old sledge 
all evening. A storm came up, blew half of my camp house 
down, and broke up the party. Have just got fixed up 
again. Those pine knot fires we had on the mountains, 
made us all look like blacksmiths. Day before yesterday 
a foot of snow fell. Last night only drifts on the north 
side of things were left and to-night you have to hunt for 
a flake. Two shots on the picket line back of our camp. 
Guess it's some of the 26th or 48th recruits. Out of every 
dozen or twenty recruits, there's sure to be one who will 
see men skulking around his picket post, and who will shoot 
a stump. 

Six-thirty a. m. 25th. Bless me, how it rained and blew 
last night. Do you remember the storm at Point Pleasant, 
Mo., April i, 1862? Never a high wind that I do not think 
of it. Believe we had two killed, about a dozen disabled 
and 20 horses killed. No paymaster yet. 

Goldsboro, N. C, March 25, 1864. 

We were two days coming back here from Bennettsville ; 
and have Sherman's receipt for another campaign and his 
promise of a little rest. Have a nice camp ground and will 
enjoy ourselves, I think. 

Huntsville, Ala., April 3, 1864. 

Thunder, lightning and rain are having a little time by 
themselves outdoors to-night. No audience, but guards and 
government mules, but that don't seem to affect the show. 
We have a right good hotel here, a rather lively party, and 
have spent a pleasant, highly gaseous evening, Colonel Oglesby, 
Dr. Morris and Captain Wilkinson of our division. 
We came down on two days' leave, principally to see the 
place, but all having more or less business. Found Will 
Trites this a. m. ; dined with him, and this afternoon four of 
us have been riding. I enjoyed it very much. Had good 
horses, and 'tis a beautiful town. I think the finest I have seen

South; but nothing near what Decatur, Bloomington, Quincy 
and a dozen other Illinois towns promise to be when they 
have half its age. In the cemetery there are as many really 
fine monuments as there were in the Chicago cemetery in 
1859, and should think it not more than half the size of the 
new Canton graveyard. Our soldiers have been registering 
their names on the finest of the monuments. It looks so sac- 
rilegious, and fully as ridiculous. They have a beautiful cus- 
tom here of placing wreaths of flowers and bouquets upon the 
graves. This p. m. (Sabbath) nearly every grave had one 
or more such offerings. I attended the Presbyterian church 
this a. m., and certainly never heard the English language so 
abused before. The minister was a citizen. Did not by a 
word allude to the war in sermon or prayers. Most of the 
ladies wore mourning. Very full attendance of them. All 
who refused the "oath" here, have been sent across the river. 
Saw General McPherson at breakfast this morning looking 
as of old. We were paid four months last Thursday. 

Scottsboro, Ala., April 9, 1864. 

Don't be alarmed and imagine that I have "photos" on the 
brain. This is in all probability the last remittance of the 
article that I shall make you. General Corse, our old brigade 
commander, we think a great deal of, and would like to have 
you preserve his picture. The little soldier, Johnny Clem, 
was a sergeant at the time of the Chickamauga battle, and 
fought like a hero. His comrades say he killed a Rebel offi- 
cer of high rank there. For his gallant conduct in that mas- 
sacre, General Thomas gave him a lieutenancy and position 
on his staff, where he now is. He is almost a perfect image 
of one, Willie Blackburn, who was my orderly in the 7th. 

The day of jubilee has come at this post; that is, we have, 
once more, something fit to eat. This is the first day since 
we've been here that our commissary has furnished us with 
aught but regular rations. We can wish for nothing now, 
except "marching orders." My men are in splendid condi- 
tion. Everyone of them in Ai health and spirits. All the 



224 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

veterans of the division are back, except the three regiments 
of our brigade. The 55th Illinois has at last concluded to 
veteran. Two hundred of them will be at home shortly. 
They held a new election, left Malmsberg and Chandler out 
in the cold, and I understand, a goodly number of their best 
officers besides. Men who have not been under good discipli- 
narians, will almost invariably, if an election is allowed, 
choose good fellows for officers. That is, men who allow 
everything to go at loose ends, who have no business what- 
ever with commissions. Captain Milt. Hainey and Captain 
Augustine, I understand, are to be colonel and lieutenant 
colonel of the 55th. They are said to be good men and offi- 
cers, and exceptions to the above, but my experience is such 
exceptions are rare, and I'd rather time would prove them 
than man's words. I believe my company would veteran, al- 
most unanimously, to-day. I am still on court-martial duty, 
and having a very easy time. We seldom sit over two hours, 
and never more than four hours a day. The most of the 
cases are for desertion, and absence without leave, with oc- 
casionally a shooting or cutting affair among some drunken 
men. The major and several of the other officers are ab- 
sent at Nashville on a shopping excursion. Captain Wyskoff 
is commanding. He has been trying for the last eight months 
to resign, but papers come back every time disapproved. It's 
hard work now to get out of the army. By a few items I 
have seen in the papers, believe the i/th Army Corps is com- 
ing up the river. Wish they would be sent here. We need 
another corps to move with us on to Rome. Suppose that 
Grant thinks he must have the i/th with him at Richmond. 
Operations cannot possibly commence here for 25 days yet. 
Wish we could move to-morrow. Colonel Wright and I were 
out a few miles this p. m. to see a couple of maidens. While 
we were enjoying our visit a party of excited citizens (all 
liable to the Southern conscription) rush in, and kindly in- 
vite us to go down to Possets' in the bottom, and clean out a 
half dozen "guerils" who were there after conscripts. 'Twas 
only a half mile through the woods to Possets' and that was 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 225 

closer than we wanted to be to such a party (we had no arms). 
So we told the excited citizens that they and the guerillas 

could all go to the d 1 and we'd go to camp. Within a 

mile of camp we met a company on the way to look for the 
Rebels, but I know they might as well look for a religious 
chaplain in the army as for the Rebels in that swamp. There 
is hardly a sign of spring here yet. Have certainly never seen 
vegetation as far advanced North at this season as it is here 
now. Need a fire every day. The last month has been colder 
than January was. I met a woman to-day who prides herself on 
belonging to one of the first families of Virginia and boasts 
that her grandsire's plantation and George Washington's al- 
most joined, and showed me a negro woman no years old, 
that formerly waited upon George Washington. She claims 
to be chivalry, par excellence. Her husband is in the Rebel 
Army. She lives off of the United States Commissary De- 
partment, and begs her chewing tobacco of United States 
soldiers. She's a Rebel, and talks it with her mouth full of 
Uncle Sam's bread and bacon. 

Scottsboro, Ala., April 24, 1864. 

Spring is here at last, and summer is almost in sight. 
The -last two days have been fully as warm as I care to 
see weather in April. There has been a great deal of cold, 
wet weather here this spring, and vegetable life is unusu- 
ally backward ; but the last few days have effected a great 
change in the forests. The north side of the mountains 
still look bare and wintry, the soft maple being the only 
tree I have noticed "in leaf" on those slopes; but nearly 
all of the trees and bushes on the southern mountain 
slopes are in full leaf. In the valleys, the poplars, the 
beeches, and the black gums are nearly in full spring 
dress, being far in advance of their comrades the oaks, 
chestnuts, hickories and white gum. Of the smaller trees 
the dogwood leads in assuming a spring costume. Two 
years ago this date, vegetation was further advanced at 
the mouth of the Ohio than 'tis here now. Do you remem- 



226 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

her, I arrived home just about two years ago this time ; 
stayed two and one half days, and then, for Corinth ? How 
easily my three years in the army have made way with 
themselves. That I have lived something over a thousand 
days, in a blue uniform seems incredible. Six months 
sounds much more reasonable. "Black Jack" reviewed our 
division yesterday. Only eight of the 13 regiments could 
be present; but 'twas the finest review I ever saw. Logan 
rode through our camp, and expressed himself much 
pleased at our way of keeping house. We have a beauti- 
ful camp, every part of it cleanly swept every morning. 
It is also decorated profusely with evergreens from the 
mountains. I suppose it is unnecessary to tell you what 
we killed in the deerhunt, I spoke of in my last, as in pros- 
pect ; but we did have a power of fun. Colonel Young, the 
citizen who proposed the party to me, is probably some 
55 years old ; and at heart a Rebel (he is now a member of 
the Alabama Legislature) but has taken the oath. I 
noticed a suspicious "auburn" tinge on his nose, and pro- 
vided myself with a canteen of pure lightning commissary 
whiskey. The colonel had tasted none of the ardent for a 
long time, and his thirst was excessive. He became in- 
tensely demoralized; and proved the most amusing char- 
acter of the party. He made us a speech, and committed 
so many fooleries, that if he had been anything but a 
Rebel, I would have been ashamed of myself for my part 
in his fall. Captains Wyckoff and Brown received orders 
yesterday accepting their tenders of resignation, and have 
started home. Lieutenant Worley has been detached to 
the Signal Corps. He is worthy of it. We (the whole 
corps) received orders this morning to prepare for the field 
immediately. The order is from McPherson and says : 
"Not one tent will be taken into the field, only two wagons 
will be allowed the regiment, one for the officers and one 
for the cooking utensils of the men." That is coming 
v down pretty low. Three years ago we had 13 wagons to 
each regiment. Two years ago eight, one year ago 'twas 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 227 

reduced to six, and now to two. What will it be next? 
Captain Sid. writes that two divisions of our corps will 
be left on this line of railroad to guard it this summer. I 
think ours and Morgan L. Smith's will probably be the 
two ; but 'tis hard to tell. I would for my part much rather 
march; if we do march, I have no doubt our course will 
be what I have before told you, Larkin's Landing, Lebanon 
and Rome, Ga. They have made a change in our artillery. 
Two batteries now accompany each division, and the rest 
goes into an artillery reserve, a corps organization. You 
remember that I told you that the 1,500 horses we foraged 
in this country would be dead loss to the government. 
Our authorities fed them all winter, and this last week an order 
came to give them back to the citizens. Remember they 
have all been paid for. But they are of no account to the 
army, and 'tis the best thing that can now be done with them. 

Scottsboro, Ala., April 18, 1864. 

No changes to note in the military situation of our por- 
tion of Dixie, but the note of preparation is heard on every 
side. All making ready for the Spring campaign, which 
every one prophesies will be the bloodiest one of the war. 
Johnston is undoubtedly collecting all the Rebel troops in 
the West, on the Georgia Central R. R. and will have a 
large force. But ours will be perfectly enormous. Not 
one of our regiments but is stronger to-day than a year ago, 
and many divisions number from one-third to three- 
quarters more than then. Our division when we marched 
through from Memphis last fall was hardly 4,500 (for 
duty) strong. Now 'tis 7,000, and growing every day. 
We have no doubt of our ability to whip Johnston most 
completely, but if he can raise 70,000 men, and we think 
he can, of course somebody will stand a remarkably good 
chance for being hurt in the proceedings. He has crossed 
a division of infantry, away off on our right, beyond Elk 
river. 'Tis hard to tell what for. Maybe to cooperate 
with Forrest. Certainly to forage some, and some think

possibly to attract our attention in that direction while he 
makes a dash on our lines east of Huntsville. This latter 
would, to my idea, be akin to the action of that youth 
Harper represents in his "April," standing on his head on 
the railroad track, six feet before the locomotive under 
way: "Rash." Twenty- four years old yesterday, and 
three years in the service. Celebrated the day by 
calling on a good looking "mountain ewe," and dining there- 
with. Made arrangements to have a deer and turkey hunt 
with her papa and some of his friends, Colonel Cobb, 
(formerly of United States Congress) among others. To 
give you an idea of the Southern love for titles, I'll name 
part of the citizens who help to form our party next Wed- 
nesday. Colonel Cobb, Colonel Provinse, Colonel Young, 
and Majors Hall and Hust. Every man who owns as many 
as two negroes is at least a colonel. None of them rank as 
low as captains. Spring is coming very slowly. At least 
four weeks behind time. Trees are becoming quite ver- 
dant, and many of the flowers are up. I would like to send 
you a few haunches of nice venison after my hunt, but 
expect, all things considered, 'twould hardly be worth while 
to try. Heard to-day of the wedding of one of my most 
particularest friends, a young lady of Decatur. Was sensi- 
ble enough to marry a soldier; but am not certain she got 
the right one. Heaven help her. 

Scottsboro, Ala., April 28, 1864. 

We received marching orders last night, and will proba- 
bly move to-morrow morning. Supposition is that we go 
to Huntsville first, there store our baggage, and then cross 
the Tennessee river and open the Spring campaign. I am 
much pleased at the prospect of moving once more. Have 
never been so well and comfortably situated in the army, 
nor was I ever tired of lying still. Lieutenant Miller

way to the "Hotel de Libby" (not) rejoicing. Tis some- 
thing of a joke on Miller. Weather is becoming most 
uncomfortably warm. Altogether too hot for marching. 
Boys of our regiment and troops of the whole corps, never 
started on a march in better spirits. Will write as often as 
have opportunities. Swarms of flies interfere with my after- 
noon naps lately.

Scottsboro, Ala., April 3Oth, '64. 

You know we have been under marching orders for several 
days. At dress parade this evening orders were read notify- 
ing us that the division would move out on the road to Chat- 
tanooga at 6 a. m., May ist. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 23! 

This is the first intimation of the direction we would take. 

It surprises me very much, and I think many others. I 
was certain we would either cross the Tennessee river at Lar- 
kins Ferry or near Decatur and take Dalton in flank or rear, 
but Sherman didn't see it. I would rather do anything else 
save one, than march over the road to Chattanooga. That 
one is to lie still in camp. 

When the boys broke ranks after the parade, cries of "mule 
soup" filled the camp for an hour. That is the name that has 
been unanimously voted to the conglomeration of dead mules 
and mud that fills the ditches on the roadside between Steven- 
son and Chattanooga. 

The whole division has been alive all evening; burning 
cabins has been the fashion. Captains Post, Smith and my- 
self got into a little discussion which ended in our grabbing 
axes and demolishing each other's cabins. 

May 1st, 1864. 

Bivouac at Mud Creek. Up at daylight, and off on time, 
6 a. m. The camp was full of citizens early, all after our 
leavings. The way they did snatch for old clothes was far 
from slow. They actually stole lots of trash right under the 
noses of the soldier owners. Out "jayhawking" old jayhawk 
himself. Started off in best of spirits men cheering right 
from their hearts. About two miles out on the road, General 
Harrow and staff passed us. The men not having the fear of 
"guard house" in their minds, yelled at him, "Bring out your 
Potomac horse," "Fall back on your straw and fresh butter," 
"Advance on Washington," etc., all of which counts as quite 
a serious offense, but he paid no attention to it. You recollect 
he is from the Potomac Army. The first expression comes 
from a punishment he inaugurated in our division. He put 
up a wooden horse in front of his quarters, and mounted on it 
all the offenders against discipline that he could "gobble." 
Some waggish fellows wrote out some highly displayed ad- 
vertisements of the "Potomac horse" and posted them through- 
out the camp, and finally one night the men took it down and 



232 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

sent it on the cars to Huntsville, directed to McPherson, with 
a note tacked on it, telling him to furnish him plenty of straw 
and use him carefully, as he was Potomac stock and unused 
to hardships. 

We only marched some ten miles to-day and have a splendid 
camping ground. Have had a wash in a mill race near by. 

West bank of Crow Creek, near Stevenson, 

May 2d, 1864. 

Only about seven miles from last night's camp, but will have 
to wait until to-morrow to build a bridge. The creek is some 
150 feet wide. Our Pioneer Corps will from the rough put a 
bridge over it in ten hours, that is to be passed over within 
the next three days by 800 wagons and 100 cannon of our 
corps. We reached here about 9 this a. m., and were led into 
a very large field of prairie grass, standing three feet high 
and as dry as tinder. A stiff breeze was blowing and the first 
fire started in our regiment set the grass in our front on a per- 
fect rampage. It run down on the 46th Ohio, and such a grab- 
bing of "traps" and scattering was never before seen, but 
was equaled about half an hour afterwards when a fire set 
in our rear came sweeping down on us. We threw our things 
out on the bare space in our front and escaped with little loss. 
My drummer had his coat, cap, drum and a pet squirrel 
burned, and a number of ponchos and small articles were also 
sent up in smoke. The days are almost like summer, but the 
nights are rather cool. The trees are about in full leaf and 
vermin are becoming altogether too numerous. Every man is 
a vigilance committee on the wood-tick question. They are 
worse than guerrillas or gray-backs. On an ordinary good 
V "tick day" we capture about ten per capita. They demoralize 
one tremendously. The boys did some good work fishing in 
the p. m., catching a number of fine bass, etc. 

A surgeon, who I think belongs on some brigade staff, has 
been stopping at nearly every house visiting, etc., and then 
rides past us to his place in front. This morning, after a visit 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 233 

he was passing our regiment; as we commenced crossing a 
little stream his horse got into a hole some four feet deep, 
stumbled, fell, rolled over, and liked to have finished the doctor. 
He was under both water and horse. The boys consoled him 
with a clear 1,000 cheers, groans, and sharp speeches. Any- 
thing short of death is a capital joke. I have seen them make 
sport of a man lying by the roadside in a fit. 

Twelve miles east of Bridgeport, May 3, 1864. 

Have made about 15 miles to-day. This is the fourth time 
I have been over the same ground, have ridden over it five 
times. This is the first time I ever started on a march where 
real judgment was used in breaking the men in. We always 
before made from 15 to 25 miles the first day and broke down 
about one-fourth of our men. This time you see, our first two 
day's marches were short and the 15 miles to-day seemed to 
affect no one. I hear from good authority here that Thomas is 
in Dalton, after some heavy skirmishing. Everything is mov- 
ing to the front here. A portion of the I2th, or 2Oth Corps 
now, is just ahead of us. Morgan L. Smith and Osterhaus 
are just behind us, but Logan will not be along until relieved 
by some other troops. 

I expect Dodge, with some 6,000 of the i6th Army Corps, 
is behind us. The i/th Army Corps was coming into Hunts- 
ville as we left. 

Camp is in an orchard, and apples are as large as hazel nuts 
and we make sauce of them. 

Whiteside, May 4, 1864. 

The day's march has been much more pleasant than any of 
us expected. Most of the dead mules have been buried, and 
the road much improved, especially through the narrows. We 
smelled a number of mules, though, after all the improve- 
ments. This, Whiteside, is like Bridgeport, a portable town, 
with canvas covers and clapboard sides. 

The boys have been catching some nice fish in a little stream 
by our camp this evening. Made about 15 miles to-day. 



234 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Between Chattanooga and Rossville, May 5, 1864. 

It has been a very warm day, and the 16 miles between 8 
a. m. and 4 p. m. counts a hard march. The dust in many 
places has been ankle deep. 

We again crossed the point of old Lookout. I think since 
yesterday morning at least 20 trains loaded with troops have 
passed us while in sight of the railroad, with from 15 to 20 
cars in each train. 

We hear to-day that Dalton is not yet ours, but Sherman 
only waits for his old corps before attacking. 

Have sent everything back to Chattanooga to store. It 
is estimated that we will have over 100,000 men at Dalton day 
after to-morrow. 

Will keep a diary and send every opportunity. 

Camp at "Gordon's Mills," Ga., May 6, 1864. 

We lay in camp on Chattanooga creek, two and one-fourth 
miles this side of Chattanooga, until II this morning, waiting 
for the division train to be loaded and turning the bulk of our 
camp and garrison equipage over to the corps quartermaster 
to store for us until we return from this campaign. 

We have cut our baggage for the regiment to what can be 
put in three wagons. Of course, we do not expect to find any 
of our things again that we leave. The 6th Iowa Veterans re- 
joined us last night. I notice that all these veterans come 
back dressed in officer's clothing. They have, I expect, been 
putting on a great many airs up North, but I don't know who 
has any better right. The last four miles of our march to- 
day has been through the west edge of the Chickamauga bat- 
tlefield. I believe the battle commenced near these mills on 
our right. 

It is supposed that we are moving to get in rear of Dalton. 
No more drumming allowed, so I suppose we are getting in 
the vicinity of Rebels, and that skirmishing will commence in 
about two days. The Big Crawfish springs near the mill is 
only second to the one that supplies Huntsville with water, 
neither one as large as the Tuscambia spring, but much more 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 235 

Beautiful. General Harrow had a fuss with our Company A 
last night. He struck one or two of the men with a club and 
put the lieutenant (Willison) under arrest. * * * It is im- 
possible to get along with him. We heard last night that Grant 
had crossed the Rapidan in four places, but don't know where. 
We know nothing about what is going on here, but feel cer- 
tain that the Rebels will get a tremendous thrashing if they 
don't move promptly. Marched n miles to-day. 

Two miles south of the Gordon's Mills crossing of 
the Chickamauga, 

May 7, 1864, 12 m. 

We started at 8 this morning and made this by n. We are 
now waiting for two or more divisions of the i6th Corps to 
file into the road ahead of us. I think they are coming from 
Ringold. A circular of McPherson's was read to us this 
morning before starting, telling us we were about to engage 
the enemy and giving us some advice about charging, meeting 
charges, shooting low, and telling us not to quit out lines to 
carry back wounded, etc., and intimating that he expected our 
corps to occupy a very warm place in the fight, and to sustain 
the fighting reputation of the troops of the department of the 
Tennessee. 

The men talk about hoping that the divisions now going 
ahead will finish the fighting before we get up, but I honestly 
believe they'd all rather get into a battle than not. It is fun 
to hear these veterans talk. I guess that about two-thirds of 
them got married when they were home. Believe it will do 
much toward steadying them down when they return to their 
homes. They almost all say that they had furlough enough 
and were ready to start back when their 30 days were up. 

It is hot as the deuce; two of our men were sun struck at 
Lookout Mountain on the 3rd. 

Dust is becoming very troublesome. I am marching in a 
badly-fitting pair of boots, and one of my feet is badly strained 
across the instep, pains me a good deal when resting. That 



236 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

and my sprained wrist make me almost a subject for the 
Invalid Corps, but I intend to carry them both as far as At- 
lanta, after our "Erring Brethren," if I have no further bad 
luck. One of my men, when he rolled up his blanket this 
morning, found he had laid on a snake, and killed him poor 
snake 1 

Near LaFayette, Ga., 12 m., May 7, 1864. 
Have just got into camp and washed my face. Four divisions 
filing into the road ahead of us, delayed us five whole hours, 
and their trains have made us seven hours marching 8 miles. 
Somebody says we are 19 miles from Rome. The boys have 
started a new dodge on the citizens. One of my men told me 
of playing it last night. When we camped for the night he 
went to a house and inquiring about the neighbors found out 
one who had relatives North; and something of the family 
history. Then he called on this party and represented himself 
as belonging to the northern branch of the family, got to kiss 
the young lady cousins, had a pleasant time generally, and re- 
turned with his haversack full of knicknacks, and the pictures 
of his cousins, with whom he had promised to correspond. At 
one house on the road to-day 10 or 12 women had congregated 
to see the troops pass. An officer stopped at the house just 
as our regiment came up, and the boys commenced yelling at 
him, "Come out of that, Yank;" you could have heard them 
two miles. Never saw a man so mortified. Colonel Wright 
tells me we are about seven miles from the Rebels at some 
ridge. We will get into position to-morrow and fight next 
day that is, they would, if I were not present. We camped 
in a "whale" of a sweet potato patch, and the boys have about 
dug up the seed and gobbled it. 

May 8, 1864, 1 130 a. m. 

Have about given up the train before daylight, so will curl 
down and take a cool snooze, minus blankets. Made 1 1 miles 
to-day.. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 237 

Fifteen miles southwest of Dalton, May 8, 1864. 
We traveled to-day over a better country than I have seen 
for five months ; the Yanks were never seen here before. All 
the negroes and stock have been run off. A little shooting 
commenced in the front to-day, and we passed a deserted sig- 
nal station and picket post. Saw some Rebels on a mountain 
south of us just before we went into camp. Dispatch came to 
Sherman this p. m. that Grant had whipped Lee three succes- 
sive days. Our fight will come off to-morrow. I entertain no 
doubt as to the result. They have cut us down to three-quarter 
rations of bread and one-fourth rations of meat. 

Seven miles west of Resaca, 15 miles from Dalton, 

May 9, 1864. 

Yesterday we traveled southeast, crossing six or seven 
ridges, one or two of which were quite high. Taylor's was the 
highest. To-day we have made only about eight miles all the 
way through a pass in Rocky Face ridge, which is a high moun- 
tain. There are four divisions ahead of us. A regiment of 
Kentucky cavalry (Rebel) slipped in between ours and the di- 
vision ahead of us, trying to capture a train. The Qth Illinois 
Infantry had the advance of our division and killed 30 Rebels 
and took four prisoners, losing only one man killed and their 
lieutenant colonel slightly wounded. Pretty good. Dodge has 
got the railroad and broken it, so we hear. The fight seems to 
be a stand-off until to-morrow. We are in line of battle for 
the first time on the trip, and the ordnance train is ahead of the 
baggage. Just saw an officer from the front (your letter of 
th,e 3d of April received this minute) ; he says Dodge is within 
a mile of Resaca, and driving the enemy, and will have the 
town by dark. Has not cut the railroad yet. This officer saw 
a train arrive from Dalton, with some 2,500 Rebel troops 
aboard. McPherson and Logan are both on the field. Some 
Rebel prisoners taken to-day say they intend making this a 
Chickamauga to us. Have a nice camp. There is some little 
forage here, but it is nothing for the number of troops we have. 



238 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Same camp, May 10, 1864. 

The 9th Illinois Infantry lost about 30 men, killed, wounded 
and missing, yesterday. We find the enemy too strong on the 
railroad to take, but have succeeded in breaking it so no trains 
can pass. Gerry's division, of the 2Oth Corps, came up at 
dark, and the rest of the corps is within supporting distance. 
Rations were issued to us this evening one-ninth rations of 
meat for three days just made a breakfast for the men. More 
rumors are flying than would fill a ream of foolscap. We had 
orders this p .m. to march to the front at 2 p. m., but did not 
go- 
Six miles from Resaca, May n, 1864. 

We had a real hurricane last night, and a tremendous 
rain-storm. We lay right in the woods, and of course 
thought of the Point Pleasant storm and falling trees, but 
were too lazy to move, and thanks to a bed of pine boughs, 
slept good and sound. There is a scare up this morning. 
We have moved a mile toward the front, and building 
breast-works is going on with the greatest life. A full 
1,000 axes are ringing within hearing. Our division is 
drawn up in column by brigade and at least another divi- 
sion is in rear of us. The latest rumor is that "the railroad 
has surrendered with 40,000 depots," 

May I2th. We are in just such a camp as I was in once 
near Jacinto, Miss. Hills, hollows and splendid pines. 
Pine knots can be picked up by the bushel, and the pitch 
smoke will soon enable us to pass for members of the 
"Corps d'Afrique." I am perfectly disgusted with this 
whole business. Everything I have written down I have 
had from the Division Staff, and that without pumping. 
I am beginning to believe that there is no enemy anywhere 
in the vicinity, and that we are nowhere ourselves, and 
am sure that the generals do not let the staff of our divi- 
sion know anything. The railroad was not cut at daylight 
this morning, for I heard a train whistle and rattle along 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 239 

it. I do know for certain that we are putting up some huge 
works here, and that they run from mountain to mountain 
across this gorge. 

Still in Snake Creek Gap, May 13, 1864. 
Moved forward a half mile and our regiment built a 
strong line of log works. We have had a perfect rush of 
generals along the line to-day: Hooker, Sickles, McPher- 
son, Thomas, Palmer, Sherman and a dozen of smaller fry. 
The boys crowded around Sherman and he could not help 
hearing such expressions as "Where's Pap?" "Let's see 
old Pap," etc., nor could he help laughing, either. The 
men think more of Sherman than of any general who ever 
commanded them, but they did not cheer him. I never 
heard a general cheered in my life, as he rode the lines. 
Sherman said in hearing of 50 men of our regiment, "Take 
it easy to-day, for you will have work enough to-morrow. 
It will be quick done though." Now see what that means. 

May 14, 1864. 

Reveille at 3 a. m. and an order has just come to leave all 
our knapsacks and move at 7 a. m. Great hospital prepara- 
tions are going on in our rear. I think we are going to take 
the railroad and Resaca. Large reinforcements came last 
night. Could hear the Rebels running trains all night. Ten- 
thirty a. m. Have moved forward about four miles. Saw 
General Kilpatrick laying in an ambulance by the roadside. 
He was wounded in the leg this morning in a skirmish. Met 
a number of men wounded moving to the rear, and a dozen 
or so dead horses, all shot this morning. Quite lively skirm- 
ishing is going on now about 200 yards in front of us. 

One forty-five p. m. Moved about 200 yards to the front 
and brought on brisk firing. 

Two thirty-five. While moving by the flank shell com- 
menced raining down on us very rapidly; half a dozen burst 
within 25 yards of us. The major's horse was shot and I think 



24O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

he was wounded. In the regiment one gun and one hat was 
struck in my company. Don't think the major is wounded 
very badly. 

Three thirty p. m. Corporal Slater of my company just 
caught a piece of shell the size of a walnut in his haversack. 

Four p. m. Colonel Dickerman has just rejoined the regi- 
ment. We would have given him three cheers if it had not 
been ordered otherwise. 

Five p. m. Have moved forward about a mile and a real 
battle is now going on in our front. Most of the artillery is 
farther to the right, and it fairly makes the ground tremble. 
Every breath smells very powderish. A battery has just opened 
close to the right of our regiment. I tell you this is inter- 
esting. Our regiment is not engaged yet, but we are in 
sight of the Rebels and their bullets whistle over our heads. 
The men are all in good spirits. 

Eight p. m. A few minutes after six I was ordered to 
deploy my company as skirmishers and relieve the ist Brigade 
who were in our front. We shot with the Rebels until dark, 
and have just been relieved. One company of the I2th Indiana 
who occupied the ground we have just left, lost their captain 
and 30 men killed and wounded in sight of us. The Rebels are 
making the axes fly in our front. The skirmish lines are 
about 200 yards apart. I have had no men wounded 
to-day. Dorrance returned to the company this evening. 

May 14, 1864, Daylight. 

We have just been in line and the intention was to 
charge the Rebel position, but two batteries were dis- 
covered in front of us. The skirmishers advanced a little 
and brought down a heavy fire. A battery is now getting 
into position in our front, right in front of our company, 
and when it opens I expect we will have another rain of 
shell from the Rebels. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 24! 

Nine thirty-five a. m. Our battery has opened, but the 
Rebels cannot reply. Four of their guns are in plain sight of 
us, but our brigade skirmishers have crawled up so close that 
not a Rebel dare load one of them. Joke on them ! One of my 
men was struck on the foot while talking to me a few minutes 
ago. Made a blue spot, but did not break the skin. 

Eleven forty-five a. m. I think our regiment has not had 
more than six or eight wounded this morning. Very heavy 
musketry firing is going on on our left. It is the I4th Corps. 

Two p. m. Since I p. m. terrific artillery and musketry 
firing has been going on on our left. The enemy was mass- 
ing against the I4th A. C. when Thomas attacked them. I 
think he drove them some distance. 

Two thirty p. m. My company is ordered to be deployed 
and sent down the hill to support skirmishers. We are in 
position, very lively firing is going on. 

Five p. m. A splendid artillery duel is going on right over 
my head. The Rebel battery is just across an open field, not 
600 yards, and one of ours is a short 100 yards in my rear. 
Osterhaus a half mile on our right is playing on the same 
battery. Thomas is still fighting heavily. He seems to 
be turning their right or forcing it back. Every time the 
Rebels fire our skirmishers just more than let them have 
the bullets. I tell you this is the most exciting show I 
ever saw. Their battery is right in the edge of the woods, 
but so masked that we can't see it, or wouldn't let them 
load. I write under cover of a stump which a dead man of 
the 26th Indiana shares with me. 

Eight p. m. Just relieved ; I lost no men. The fighting on 
the left was Hooker and Howard, and was very heavy. 

May 15, 1864, 1 130 a. m. 

At ii p. m. went again on the skirmish line with Captain 
Post and superintended the construction of rifle pits for our 
skirmishers. A good deal of fun between our boys and the 
Rebels talking only 50 yards apart. 



242 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Five thirty a. m. At 3 a. m. moved and are now supporting 
Osterhaus, who is going to charge the railroad. Will see 
fighting this morning. 

Nine a. m. The skirmishers are fighting briskly. Oster- 
haus' artillery is on both sides and behind us. Sherman has 
just passed us to the front. When we first came here about 
daylight the Rebels charged our folks on the hill ahead, but 
were repulsed without our assistance. McPherson is now 
passing. Osterhaus gained that hill last night by a charge, 
losing about 200 men in the operation. From a hill 50 yards 
from our position I can see the Rebel fort at Resaca and 
Rebels in abundance. It is not a mile distant. 

One thirty p. m. Our artillery is beginning to open on 
them. One man was killed and two wounded within 40 yards 
of the regiment by Rebel sharpshooters. 

Seven p. m. No charge yet to-day, but has been heavy 
fighting on the left. I have seen, this evening, Rebel trains 
moving in all directions. We have a good view of all their 
works. 

May 16, 1864, 6 p. m. 

The old story the Rebels evacuated last night. They made 
two or three big feints of attacking during the night, but are 
all gone this morning. It is said they have taken up a position 
some five miles ahead. Prisoners and deserters are coming in. 
At Resaca we captured eight cannon, not more than 100 pris- 
oners, and some provisions ; don't know what we got at Dalton. 
Some estimate our whole loss up to this time at 2,500 
killed and wounded. Everything is getting the road for pur- 
suit. The prisoners say Johnston will make a stand 40 miles 
south. 

Six p. m. The i6th Corps moved out on the Rome road, 
and while we are waiting for the I4th Corps to get out of 
our way word came that the i6th had run against a snag. 
We were moved out at once at nearly double quick time 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 243 

to help them. Trotted four miles and passed a good many 
wounded, but we were not needed. We bivouac to-night on 
the southeast bank of Coosa river. I hear to-night that our 
loss in the corps is 600 and that no corps has suffered less than 
ours. Some think the whole will foot over 5,000. 

May 17, 1864, 10 a. m. 

Our regiment moves in rear of the division to-day and we 
are still waiting for the trains to pass. We can hear firing in 
front occasionally, and although we have seen fighting enough 
to satisfy us for a time, still it's more disagreeable to be away 
in the rear and hearing, but not knowing what's going on, than 
to be in the field. I saw several hundred Rebel prisoners yes- 
terday, among then one colonel. The country is much more 
level this side of the Coosa, but the pine woods spoil it. 
Our advance, from the faint sound of the artillery firing, 
must be seven or eight miles ahead. We will make it 
very warm for Johnston. 

Ten p. m. Have just got into camp, made 12 miles to-day. 
Heavy firing on our left, which I hear is a division of How- 
ard's Corps. 

May 1 8, 1864. 

Our division has had the advance to-day, but no infantry 
fighting. At noon we get into Adairsville and meet the 4th 
Army Corps. Saw Generals Howard, Thomas, Sickles and a 
hundred others. We are camped five miles southwest of town 
and by the prettiest place I ever saw. The house is excellent, 
the grounds excel in beauty anything I ever imagined. The oc- 
cupants have run away. Our cavalry had a sharp fight here this 
p. m., and on one of the gravel walks in the beautiful garden 
lies a Rebel colonel, shot in five places. He must have been a 
noble looking man ; looks 50 years old, and has a fine form and 
features. Think his name is Irwin. I think there must be a 
hundred varieties of the rose in bloom here and the most splen- 
did specimens of cactus. I do wish you could see it. At 
Adairsville, night before last, we lost 400 killed and wounded 
in a skirmish. 

16 



244 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Nine a. m. Rapid artillery firing on our left front. We are 
waiting for Osterhaus and Morgan L. Smith to get out of the 
way. Our division has the rear to-day. Our cars got into 
Adairsville yesterday evening and the last Rebel train left in 
the morning. Firing on the left very heavy. 

Kingston, Cass County, Ga., May 19, 1864, 5 p. m. 
The artillery has been working all day, but have not heard 
how much of a fight. That dead Rebel colonel was Iverson, 
of the Second Georgia Cavalry; we think he was formerly a 
M. C. of this State, and a secessionist. The citizens here have 
most all left the towns, but are nearly all at home in the coun- 
try. The cavalry had sharp fighting in the road we have come 
over to-day. Many dead horses and a number of fresh graves 
by the roadside. I wish I was in the cavalry. This plodding 
along afoot is dry business, compared with horse-back travel- 
ing. I hear this morning that Wilder's mounted infantry cap- 
tured two cannons and 600 Rebels this afternoon. Also that 
6,000 prisoners were yesterday started from Dalton for the 
North. 

Kingston, May 20, 1864. 

Our cars got here this morning ; the whistle woke me. One 
of the most improbable rumors afloat is that letters will be 
allowed to go North to-day. I know you are anxious, so will 
not lose the rumor of a chance. Billy Fox returned to-day. 
My things are all right at Chattanooga. I'm in excellent health 
and all right every way. The news from Grant encourages us 
very much, but if he gets whipped it won't keep us from whal- 
ing Johnston. We're now about 50 miles from Atlanta. Will 
probably take a day or two here to replenish the supply trains, 
and let the men recruit a little after their twenty-day march ; 
don't know anything about Johnston ; it is not thought he will 
give us a fight near here. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 245 

May 21, 1864. 

The 23d Army Corps moved South yesterday. I hear that 
they found the enemy on the south bank of the Etowah river, 
and that he disputes the crossing. Grant seems to be checked 
in his "on to Richmond." It seems that Rebel Iverson, whom 
I saw dead near Adairsville, was a brigadier general and a son 
of the ex-Congressman. This Kingston has been a gem of a 
little town, but the Rebels burned most of it when they left. 
Our railroad men are very enterprising. The cars got here 
the same night we did, and a dozen or 20 trains are coming 
per day, all loaded inside with commissary stores and outside 
with soldiers. 

May 22, 1864. 

Two regiments of three-year's men who did not "veteran" 
started home to-day. The loss of the army in this way will not 
be much. Not more than one or two regiments in any corps 
refused to veteran. We are drawing 20 days' rations, sending 
sick back to convalescent camp at Chattanooga, and making all 
preparations for a hard campaign. 

Four miles northwest of Van Wirt, Ga., 

May 23, 1864. 

Weather is getting very hot. We have made 21 miles to- 
day, and the distance, heat and dust have made it by far the 
hardest march we have had for a year. Excepting about six 
miles of dense pine woods the country we have passed through 
has been beautiful, quite rolling, but fertile and well improved. 
In the midst of the pine woods we stopped to rest at Hollis' 
Mill, a sweet looking little 17-year old lady here told me she 
was and always had been Union, and that nearly all the poor 
folks here are Union. In answer to some questions about 
the roads and country, she said, "Well, now, I was born and 
raised right here, and never was anywhere, and never see any- 
body, and I just don't know anything at all." 



246 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

I never saw so many stragglers as to-day. For 12 
miles no water was to be had; then we came to a spring, a 
very large one, say 4 or 5 hogsheads a minute. All the offi- 
cers in the army could not have kept the men in ranks. Saw 
no cases of sunstroke, but two of my men from heat turned 
blue with rush of blood to the head, and had to leave the ranks. 
Some think we are moving on Montgomery, Ala. Our orders 
say we need not hope for railroad communications for 20 days ; 
I think that Atlanta is our point, although we were 50 miles 
from there this morning and 60 to-night. The planters in this 
country own thousands of negroes, and they've run them all off 
down this road. They are about two days ahead of us, and the 
poor people say as thick on the road as we are. Have passed 
several to-day who escaped from their masters. 

Four miles southeast of Van Wirt, Ga., 

May 24, 1864. 

Short march to-day because it is a full day's march from 
here to water. At Van Wirt we turned east on the Atlanta 
road. Will pass through Dallas to-morrow. My company was 
rear guard to-day for the brigade. One of my men spilled a 
kettle of boiling coffee last night, filling his shoe. All the skin 
on the top of his foot that did not come off with the socks is 
in horrible blisters. The surgeon said he would have to march, 
and he has, all day, don't that seem rather hard ? You remem- 
ber how I used to detest fat meat? If I didn't eat a pound of 
raw pickled pork to-day for dinner, shoot me. Things don't 
go nearly as well as on the march from Memphis. 'Tis much 
harder, though we don't make as many miles per day. One 
reason is the weather is much warmer, and another thing, each 
division then marched independently, and now all three of them 
camp together every night. Dorrance is nearly sick to-night. 
I thought I heard some artillery firing this morning, but guess 
I was mistaken. The cavalry report they have not found any 
force of Rebels yesterday or to-day. Small-pox has broken out 
in the 6th Iowa some 20 cases. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 247 

Pumpkin Vine Creek, near Dallas, Ga., 

May 26, 1864, 8 a. m. 

We did not make more than seven or eight miles yesterday, 
on account of some bad road that troubled the trains very much. 
We got into camp at dark, just as a thunderstorm broke. We 
hurried up our arrangements for the night kicking out a level 
place on the hillside to sleep gathering pine boughs to keep 
the water from washing us away, and spreading our rubbers 
over rail frames. Everything just finished, was just pulling 
our stock of bed clothes over me (one rubber coat), when the 
brigade bugle sounded the "assembly." It was dark as pitch 
and raining far from gently no use grumbling so everybody 
commenced yelping, singing, or laughing. In ten minutes we 
were under way, and though we didn't move a mile, every man 
who didn't tumble half a dozen times would command good 
wages in a circus. We finally formed line of battle on a bushy 
hillside, and I dropped down on the wet leaves and slept 
soundly until I o'clock, and woke up wet and half frozen, took 
up my bed and made for a fire and dried out. Do you remem- 
ber the case when the Saviour commanded a convalescent to 
take up his bed and walk? I always pitied that man, carrying 
a four-post bedstead, feathers, straw and covering and failed to 
see it, but if he had no more bedding than I had. I can better 
understand it. Heavy cannonading all the p. m. yesterday. It 
seemed some five or six miles east; don't understand the way 
matters are shaping at all. Sherman has such a way of keeping 
everything to himself. The country between Van Wirt and 
Dallas is very rough, but little of it under cultivation; along 
this creek are some nice looking farms. The Rebels were go- 
ing to make a stand, but didn't. 

Two p. m. We started at 8 this morning, and have not made 
more than one and one-half miles. Soldiers from the front 
say that Hardee's Corps fronts us two miles ahead, and that he 
proposes to fight. I have heard no firing that near this morn- 
ing, but have heard artillery eight or ten miles east. A number 
of prisoners have been sent back, who all report Hardee at 



248 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Dallas. I think Thomas now joins our left. McPherson last 
night rode up to some Rebel pickets, who saluted him with a 
shower of hot lead, fortunately missing him. Osterhaus' com- 
missary drives along a lot of cattle for the division. Last night 
he got off the road and drove them into a party of secesh, who 
took commissary, beef and all. Back at Kingston, a big box 
came to General Harrow with heavy express charges. An 
ambulance hauled it 20 miles before it caught up with him, 
and on opening it he found a lot of stones, a horse's tail, and a 
block of wood with a horses' face pinned on it labeled, "head 
and tail of your Potomac horse." At Van Wirt before we got 
there the Rebels had a celebration over Lee's capturing Grant 
and half of his army. There's a great deal of ague in the 
regiment. We will have a great deal of sickness after the cam- 
paign closes. I have only seen one man at home in Georgia 
who looked capable of doing duty as a soldier. My health is 
excellent. This creek runs into the Talladega river. 

One mile south of Dallas, 2 p. m. 

After a lively skirmishing Jeff C. Davis' division of the I4th 
Army Corps occupied Dallas at 2 p. m. The Rebels retired 
stubbornly. We passed Dallas about dark, and are now the 
front and extreme right of the whole army. I guess fighting is 
over for the night. Two very lively little fights have occurred 
before dark. The heavy fighting yesterday was Hooker. He 
whipped and drove them four miles, taking their wounded. 

Ne,ar Dallas, Ga., May 27, 1864, 8 a. m. 
There has been some very heavy fighting on our left this 
morning, and everywhere along the line. We have been mov- 
ing in line since 6 o'clock, supporting skirmishers and the 3d 
Brigade. Have driven the Rebels about three-quarters of a 
mile. The I4th Corps must have had a severe fight about 6 :3O. 
The bullets have whistled pretty thick this a. m. 

Skirmish line, n a. m. Osterhaus and Smith (I think), 
have just had a big fight on our left. At 8:30 I was ordered 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 249 

to take Companies E, K, B and G, deploy them and relieve the 
3d Brigade skirmishers. Deployed and moved forward over 
one-half mile through the very densest brush couldn't see 
six feet, expecting every minute to find the 3d Brigade skirm- 
ishers, but they had been drawn in, and we were right into the 
Rebels before we saw them. Three of my company were 
wounded in an instant and three of K's taken prisoner, but 
our boys made the Rebels skedaddle, and all of them got away. 
Twenty-one Rebels came up in rear of Captain Smith and 
two of his men. Private Benson shot one of them, and Smith 
roared out for the rest to surrender, which they did. They 
(Rebels) said they would not have been taken if the Georgia 
brigade had not fallen back. I think that is doing pretty well 
for four companies of our regiment, running a whole brigade. 
Firing is very heavy all around us. 

Twelve thirty m. A chunk of Rebel shell lit 15 feet from 
me. Lively artillery firing right over head. 

Four p. m, At 2:15, after firing a few shells, the Rebels 
set up a yell along our whole front. I knew a charge was 
coming. At 2:30 another yell was much nearer. My men 
then commenced firing on them, but they came on yelling 
pretty well, but not as heartily as I have heard. They came 
jumping along through the brush more then, making the 
bullets rain among us. I think they could not fly much thicker. 
My men did nobly,but they were too many for us, and we had 
to fall back. I heard their officers halloo to them, "to yell and 
stand steady," and they were right amongst us before we left. 
Our line of battle checked them and made them run. I lost 
A. Huffard killed ; Seth Williams died in two hours ; Wm. 
Gustine severely wounded; E. Suydam ditto; S. Hudson 
ditto ; H. Stearns slight wound ; J. H. Craig ditto ; F. Cary 
ditto; W. Roberts ditto; W. G. Dunblazier captured. 

Seven p. m. I tell you this was exciting. My men all stood 
like heroes (save one), and some of them did not fall back 
when I wanted them to. The bush was so thick that we could 
hardly get through in any kind of line. Gustine and Suydam 



250 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

were about 20 feet on my left when they were shot, but I 
couldn't see them. The Rebels were not 15 feet from them. 
I had 31 men on the line, and nine killed and wounded, and 
one prisoner, is considerable of a loss. They took six more 
of Company K prisoners, but three of them got off. I don't 
think anyone can imagine how exciting such a fracas as that 
is in thick brush. As quick as our line started the Rebels 
running, I went back on the ground, and found a lot of dead 
and wounded Rebels. Every prisoner of the 2Oth Georgia had 
whiskey in his canteen, and all said they had all issued to them 
that they wanted. I never say such a dirty, greasy, set of 
mortals. They have had no rest since they left Dalton. On 
account of my skirmishers losing so heavily, we have been 
relieved from the line, and are now in rifle pits, and are sup- 
porting those who relieved us. 

May 28, 1864, 9 a. m. 

Still in rifle pits. We have been treated to a terrific 
storm of shells, spherical case, and solid shot. The bat- 
teries are in plain sight of each other, and the gunners 
call it a thousand yards between them. I don't think 
either battery does very fine work, but they make it more 
than interesting for us. A conical shell from a 12 pound 
gun passed through a log and struck a Company C man 
on the leg, only bruising him. Two solid shot fell in my 
company works, but hurt no one. Seven p. m. Talk about 
fighting, etc., we've seen it this p. m. sure, of all the interesting 
and exciting times on record this must take the palm. At 
about 3 :45 p. m., a heavy column of Rebels rose from a 
brush with a yell the devil ought to copyright, broke for 
and took three guns of the ist Iowa Battery which were 
in front of the works (they never should have been placed 
there) ; the 6th Iowa boys, without orders, charged the 
Rebels, retook the battery and drove them back. They 
came down on our whole line, both ours and the i6th A. C., 
and for two hours attempted to drive us out. We repulsed 
them at every point without serious loss to us, but I 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 25! 

believe they are at least 3,000 men short. In our brigade 
Colonel Dickerman, Lieutenant Colonel 6th Iowa com- 
manding, and Major Gilsey, commanding 46th Ohio, are 
wounded. Besides these I don't think our brigade lost over 
80. It was a grand thing. I did not lose a man and only 
three companies of our regiment lost any. When the mus- 
ketry was playing the hottest, Logan came dashing up 
along our line, waved his hat and told the boys to "give 
them hell, boys." You should have heard them cheer him. 
It is Hardee's Corps fighting us, and he promised his men 
a "Chickamauga," but it turned out a "Bull Run" on 
their part. It is the same corps our regiment fought at 
Mission Ridge. Our line is very thin along here, but 
guess we can save it now. I heard a 4Oth boy get off an 
oddity this evening, he said : "If they come again, I am 
going to yell if there's any danger of their taking us, 
'Worlds by Nation Right into line Wheel!' and if that 
don't scare them, I propose going." 

May 29, 1864, 4 p. m. 

Have been in the rifle pits all day. We're now expecting 
a charge from the Rebels, that is, our division commander is. 
I think they will lose an immense sight of men if they attempt 
it. News to-day of Davis moving his capital to Columbia, 
S. C., and of Grant driving Lee across the Savannah River. 

Monday, May 30, 1864. 

At dark last night I was put in charge of our brigade 
skirmish line of four companies ; by 9 130 I had everything 
arranged to our notion. About that time the musketry 
commenced fire on our left and continued for a half hour; 
it was very heavy. Some three or four pieces of artillery 
also opened on our side. That thing was repeated eight 
times during the night, the last fight being just before 
daylight. When I was down on the right of the line I 
could hear the Rebels talking about the fight and saying 
it was a mighty hard one, and "I wonder whether our 



252 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

men or the Yanks are getting the best of it." These night 
fights are very grand. I understand this fighting occurred 
between Hooker and the "Johnnies." Attacks were made 
by each side, repulses easy. I guess from what little I hear 
there was a good deal more shooting than hitting on both 
sides. I think it was the intention for us to move to the 
left last night, but so much fighting prevented it. I don't 
know when I have been so used up as this morning, and 
the whole command is not far from the same condition, 
but a few hours' sleep made me all right again this morn- 
ing. The Rebels are much more tired than we; they have 
had no rest since leaving Dalton. One of their wounded, 
a captain, told me that one of their surgeons told him their 
loss since leaving Dalton in killed and wounded would 
amount to 25,000. That's pretty strong, the third of it or 
10,000 I could believe. I was relieved at dark to-day from 
skirmishing duty. 

May 31, 1864. 

Generals Sherman, McPherson, Logan and Barry visited 
our position yesterday. Sherman looks very well. Logan 
smiled and bowed in return to my salute as though he 
recognized me. During the fight of the 28th I was stand- 
ing, when he was riding along our lines on the inside of the 
rifle pits (with a hatful of ammunition), just over my men. 
He stopped by me and said: "It's all right, damn it, isn't 
it?" I returned: "It's all right, General." The Rebels 
were quite busy last night running troops and artillery 
along our front both ways. Some think they planted a 
number of guns opposite us. I hear some of the officers 
talking as though a fight was expected to-day. Their 
sharpshooters are making it quite warm here this morning; 
several men have been struck, but none hurt seriously. 

Seven p. m. The Rebels have just finished throwing 126 
shells at us, only 19 of which bursted. We expected they 
would follow it with a charge, but they hardly will attempt 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 253 

it this late. I think we have lost none to-day in the regi- 
ment. Their shell hurt no one. Logan was slightly 
wounded in the arm yesterday. Colonel Dickerman died 
this morning. 

Five miles west of Acworth, 

June i, 1864. 

At daylight this morning we left our position on the right 
and moved over here, six or seven miles, and relieved Hook- 
er's 2Oth Corps, which moved around to the left. It was 
ticklish business moving out from under at least 30 of the 
enemy's guns, and we did it very quietly. They did not sus- 
pect it. We are now within 90 yards of the Rebel works, 
and the shooting is very lively. Only one of our regiment 
wounded to-day. I would much rather be here than where 
we were, for there they shot at us square from three sides, 
and here they can but from one front. This is dense woods 
and the ground between our works nearly level. There are 
two lines of works here, 30 yards apart; we occupy the rear 
works to-day, but will relieve the 6th Iowa to-morrow and 
take the front. This is the ground that Hooker had his big 
fight on on the 25th of May. He lost some 2,000 men killed 
and wounded. The woods are all torn up with canister, shell 
and shot, and bloody shoes, clothing and accoutrements are 
thick. 

June 2, 1864. 

The 4Oth Illinois returned to-day, and I was right glad to 
see them back. We have lost no men to-day. The I7th 
Army Corps is beginning to come in. We advanced our 
works last night, commencing a new line in front of our regi- 
ment. The Rebels didn't fire at us once, though they might 
as well killed some one as not. Colonel Wright and ten men 
picked out the ground and then I took a detail and went to 
work. By daylight we had enough of rifle pit to cover 
50 men and had the men in it. I tell you it waked them 



254 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

up when our boys opened upon them. This is getting on 
the Vicksburg order. The troops are in splendid spirits 
and everything is going on as well as could be wished. 
I think this thing will be brought to a focus in a few days. 

June 3, 1864. 

Relieved the 6th Iowa at 6:30 this a. m. The Rebels 
shoot pretty close. Killed Orderly Sergeant of Company I, 
(VanSycle), and wounded three men in our regiment 
to-day. This makes 50 in killed, wounded and prisoners, 
or one in every six. 

June 4, 1864. 

We have had a good deal of fun to-day. The firing has 
been brisker than usual on account of our advancing our 
works. We got up a mock charge this afternoon, which 
came pretty near scaring the Rebel skirmishers out of their 
boots and made a good deal of fun for us. Our regiment 
is on fatigue duty. We are working within 80 yards of the 
Rebel works. They cut a Company C man's finger off 
when he raised his pick to-day. Another of our men was 
shot in the face. I, with my company, work from 12 
to-night until three in the morning. 

June 5, 1864. 

The Rebels run last night. Everything gone this morn- 
ing slick and clean. Our regiment was the first in their 
works. I was over their works to-day and find three lines, 
two of them very strong. A number of dead men lay 
beween their lines and ours, which neither side could bury. 
They were killed during Hooker's fight of May 25th. 

Well, I expect another heat like this at the Chattahochie 
river and when we get them out of there, as we are bound 
to do, ho! for easy times! 

My health continues excellent, and I hope it will until 
this campaign is over. I am making up for some of my 
easy times soldiering. The Rebels were awful dirty and 
the smell in their camps dreadful. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 255 

We got some 25 prisoners in front of our division. I 
think one more big stand will wind the thing up. They 
made no noise whatever in getting away. I was from 12 
to 3 o'clock in the night working within 75 yards of them 
and did not hear them at all. At one place their works ran 
through a graveyard, and they had torn down all the 
palings inclosing graves, to make beds for themselves, and 
unnecessarily destroyed everything of beauty around. I 
am sure we would not have done so in our own country, 
and / would not anywhere. I don't give these Rebels half 
the credit for humanity or any of the qualities civilized 
beings should possess, that I used to. I estimate loss of 
our army here at 7,000 killed, wounded and missing. It 
may be more. Heavy reinforcements are arriving though, 
and the strength of the army is much greater than at any 
time heretofore. Spirits excellent. I could tell some awful 
stories of dead men, but forbear. We moved at 9 a. m. 
about four and one-half miles toward the railroad and 
have gone into camp for the night. 

This is the first day since May 26th that I have been 
out of the range of Rebel guns, and hardly an hour of that 
time that the bullets have not been whistling and thump- 
ing around. I tell you it is a strain on a man's nerves, 
but like everything else that hurts, one feels better when 
he gets over it. 

June 6, 1864. 

I will try and send you this to-day. Our postmaster never 
calls for letters, though we could send them if he would. I 
will try hereafter to send oftener, though you must not feel 
anxious about me. I will take the best care I can of myself 
(and do my whole duty). I yet think that to be connected 
with such a campaign as this is well worth risking one's life 
for. It occasionally gets a little old, but so does everything 
in this life, and altogether I don't know but that it wears as 
well as any of life's pleasures. Do you remember when I 



256 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

was at home how little I knew about good eatables? Here 
it is a great advantage to me. For five weeks we have been 
living on "hard tack," pickled pork and coffee, varied by not 
half a dozen meals of beef, not even beans or rice. Nearly 
every one grumbles, but I have as yet felt no loss of appetite, 
and hardly the desire for a change. 

Nearly all the prisoners we capture say they are done fight- 
ing and shamefully say, many of them, that if exchanged and 
put back in th,e ranks they will shirk rather than fight. It 
would mortify me very much if I thought any of our men 
that they captured would talk so. It seems to me that the 
Confederacy is only held together by its officers exercising at 
least the power of a Czar, and that should we leave it to itself 
it would crumble. Well, I am calculating that this campaign 
will end about the I5th of July, in Atlanta. I cannot hope 
for a leave of absence again until my time is out, unless I 
resign, and if active campaigning continues, as some think it 
will, until the war is over, of course I will have no chance to 
do the latter. Cousin James is near me here, and I expect 
to see him soon. 

Passed Charlie Maple on the road yesterday ; also saw Cleg- 
get Birney. He is a splendid looking boy. They say the 7th 
Cavalry will soon be here ; also the 8th Illinois. I will try to 
write you every week hereafter. 

One mile South of Ack worth, June 16, 1864. 

We moved through town and arrived here this p. m. Ack- 
worth is a nice little town. All the "ton" have moved south. 

We will lay here two days, and then for Atlanta again. I 
was out of provisions all day yesterday, and when I got a 
supply last night filled up to suffocation, but feel splendidly 
to-day. They credit a prisoner with saying that Sherman will 
never go to hell, for he'll flank the devil and make heaven in 
spite of all the guards. The army is in glorious spirits. I 
hope the next time to date from Atlanta, but can hardly hope 
that for three weeks yet. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 257 

Same place, June 7, 1864. 

Our brigade has to-day been on a reconnoisance, supporting 
Girard's (formerly Kilpatrick's) Cavalry Division. 

We started the Johnnies not more than a mile from here, 
and skirmished with them, driving them to the Kenesaw 
range of mountains, about five miles. Our brigade lost noth- 
ing. Wilder's mounted infantry did the skirmishing and had 
some eight to ten wounded. Four dead Rebels fell into our 
hands. Cousin James called on me yesterday. I am much 
pleased with him. He is a No. i soldier, I know. He has run 
some pretty close risks this campaign, but who would not for 
the sake of taking part in it? I shall always think it abund- 
antly worth risking one's life for. To-morrow night we can 
tell whether the enemy intends fighting us at this place or not. 
They left on the field to-day a dozen or twenty real lances. 
They are the first I ever saw in the service. The staff is eight 
or nine feet long with a pointed head of ten inches in length. 
They were a right plucky set of Johnnies. 

Our battery burst a shell over the edge of a piece of woods 
and I saw some 20 Rebels scatter like a lot of scared rats. 

Near Big Shanty, Ga., June 10, 1864. 

Army moved this a. m. Found the enemy again at this 
place, and have been in line of battle a dozen times, more or 
less. Our brigade is in reserve for the rest of the division. 
This is the Kenesaw Mountain ; from the top of one peak 
the Rebels could see probably 25,000 Yanks. Some ladies 
were there in sight observing us. We are to-night in a dense 
wood some three-quarters of a mile southwest of the main 
road. The enemy does not seem to be close in our immediate 
front, but there is considerable firing about a brigade to our 
right. General Sherman's staff say that a general fight is not 
expected here. A. J. Smith is starting for Mobile from Vicks- 
burg. That's glorious. We to-day heard of the nomination 
at Baltimore of Lincoln and Johnson. Very glad that Lin- 
coln is renominated, but it don't make any excitement in the 
army. The unanimity of the convention does us more good 



258 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

than anything else. I received a letter from Gen. "Dick'' 
(Oglesby) last night. He is much pleased with his nomina- 
tion and has no doubt of his success. Neither have I. If we 
had the privilege the whole Illinois army would vote for him, 
We are having a good deal of rain, say about 6 hard showers 
a day. The roads are badly cut up. The hour or two hours 
sun between showers makes the men all right. The Rebels 
have no oilcloths and must be troubled with so much rain. 

June n, 1864. 

Colonel Wright and I rode out to the front to-day. The 
Johnnies are about one and one-half miles from us, and oc- 
cupying what looks like a very strong position. Rumor says 
that Sherman has said that he can force them to leave here any 
moment, but will wait for supplies and' the roads to dry up. 
The cars got to Big Shanty about noon to-day, and indulged 
in a long and hilarious shriek. The Rebel locomotive about 
two miles further down the road answered with a yell of 
defiance. 

I hear to-day that the 23d Corps took 2,000 prisoners and 
two cannon. I guess its yes. Rosencrans is actually coming, 
they say. I don't think we need him. Sherman moves very 
cautiously, and everybody feels the utmost confidence in him. 
I saw him yesterday seems to me he is getting fleshy. He 
don't look as though he had anything more important than a 
4<>acre farm to attend to. 

It has rained almost all day. You musn't expect me 
to write anything but military now, for it is about all we 
think of. 

June 12, 1864. 

It commenced raining before daylight, and has not 
ceased an instant all day. We are lucky in the roads 
where it can't get very muddy, but so much rain is con- 
foundedly disagreeable. The only source of consolation 
is the knowledge that the Rebels fare much worse than we 
do. They have neither tents nor oilcloths. For once our 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 259 

corps is in reserve. The i6th and iyth united their lines 
in front of us this morning. The I7th A. C. especially is 
using ammunition with a looseness. They are just getting 
their hands in. The rain is real cold. If it were not for 
hearing the musketry and artillery firing we wouldn't 
know there was an enemy within 50 miles. This is said 
to be the Georgia gold country. I could just pick up some 
beautiful specimens of quartz and a flinty stone (maybe 
quartz also) in which the isinglass shines, and in some 
places I have picked off sheets two inches square. No 
forage here. Four deserters came in to-day. 

They say that Johnston had an order read to his troops 
that Wheeler had cut the railroad in our rear, and de- 
stroyed our supply trains. The troops all cheered it heart- 
ily, but hardly had they got their mouths shut when our 
locomotives came whistling into Big Shanty, one mile from 
their lines. The deserters say it disgusted them so much 
they concluded they'd quit and go home. I wish Sherman 
would attack them now, for we would be sure to get what 
trains and artillery they have here. 

June 13, 1864. 

The rain continued until 5 p. m. Everything and every- 
body thoroughly soaked. Our division moved about one- 
half mile to the left this p. m. Strategy! We moved out 
into an open ploughed field. You can imagine the amount 
of comfort one could enjoy so situated, after two days' 
constant rain, and the water still coming down in sheets. 

The field is trodden into a bed of mortar. No one 
has ventured a guess of the depth of the mud. It is cold 
enough for fires and overcoats. My finger nails are as blue 
as if I had the ague. There is one consolation to be drawn 
from the cold, it stops the "chigres" from biting us. I 
would rather have a bushel of fleas and a million of mos- 
quitoes on me than a pint of "chigres," don't know the 
orthography They are a little bit of a red thing, just an 
atom bigger than nothing; they burrow into the skin and 

17 



26O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

cause an itching that beats the regular "camp" all hollow. 
Some of the men have scars from "chigre" bites that they 
received at Big Black last summer, and will carry them 
across the Styx. The ants here also have an affinity for 
human flesh and are continually reconnoitering us. I kill 
about 200,000 per day. Also knock some 600 worms off 
of me. Great country this for small vermin. I pick 
enough entomological specimens off me every day to start 
a museum. I do manage to keep clear of greybacks, 
though. 

Every time I commence talking about chigres I feel short 
of language. I am satisfied of one thing, if my finger nails 
don't wear out, there'll be no flesh left on my bones by 
autumn. The case stands finger nails vs. chigres, and skin 
is the sufferer. Notwithstanding rain, cold or chigres, we 
are in excellent spirits. Sherman don't tell us anything 
(in orders) good or bad, but every man feels that we have 
"a goodly thing" and is content to work and wait. I never 
heard less complaining, or saw troops in better spirits. 
If we get to Atlanta in a week all right ; if it takes us two 
months you won't hear this army grumble. We know 
that "Pap" is running the machine and our confidence in him 
is unbounded. 

We have so far had abundance of rations, but if it comes 
down to half, we will again say "all right." Our army is 
stronger to-day than it ever was in numbers and efficiency. I 
am sure that there is not a demoralized company in the com- 
mand. There has been considerable shooting along the front 
to-day, and the lines have been advanced some, but we are 
nearly a mile back, and being constantly ready to move. I 
have not been out, and don't know much about the exact sit- 
uation. Its something new for our division to be in reserve. 
Time passes much more quickly in the front. The general 
opinion is that we are gradually working to the left, and will 
cross the Chattahoochie about east or northeast of Marietta. 
We are now 26 miles from Atlanta by railroad and some- 
thing nearer by pike. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 26 1 

June 14, 1864. 

Four officers and 28 men deserted from the Rebels last 
night. The Rebel captain told one of my corporals that in 
their brigade there is an organization the members of which 
avow it their purpose to desert the first opportunity. These 
men are satisfied the game is up with them, and give it as their 
reason for deserting. They say the whole brigade will come 
as opportunity offers. Lively artillery firing in front of us 
this morning. We hear that Grant has pushed Lee to his for- 
tifications at Richmond. Suppose the report will be, Grant 
will cut his communications south and west and Lee will 
evacuate. I see the papers have us across the Chattahoochie, 
away south of the railroad. Of course that is a poor article of 
gas from our sensational correspondent in the far rear. 

It looks to me as if the Rebels have a very strong position 
in front of us now, but I may be mistaken. We have been 
quietly laying in camp all day. I must credit Georgia with 
one pleasant June day, that is not too warm. There has been 
the usual amount of firing to-day, though few hurt. 

June 15, 1864. 

This has been a star day, and a better feeling lot of men 
that compose our brigade will be hard to find, for to-night any 
way. The morning was occupied in cleaning guns, etc. At 
ii o'clock the assembly was sounded, and we moved one and 
one-half miles, which brought us on the left of the whole 
army. By I p. m. we had our line formed running from right 
to left, iO3d Illinois, 6th Iowa, 46th Ohio, 4Oth Illinois, with 
the 97th Indiana deployed as skirmishers. We were in about 
the center of an open lot of plantations, facing a densely- 
wooded hill of maybe 300 acres. It was a plumb one-third of 
a mile to it and already the enemy's sharpshooters were reach- 
ing our men from it. 

One of Company K's men was shot here, and one of H's. 
At precisely I p. m. we started, the men having been notified 
that they would have to get to that woods as quickly as pos- 
sible. The Rebels opened pretty lively. Right in front of 



262 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

where I am now writing is a house. On the porch I see II 
children, not over nine years old. All belong to one woman. 
Haven't seen her, but from what I have seen in this country, 
wouldn't dispute the man who would tell me she was only 20 
years old. This is a great stock country. As we started, 
the boys raised a cheer that was a cheer, and we went down on 
them regular storm fashion. A hundred yards before we got 
to the hill we ran into a strong line of rifle pits swarming 
with Johnnies. They caved and commenced begging. The 
pit I came to had about 20 in it. They were scared until some 
of them were blue, and if you ever heard begging for life it 
was then. Somebody yelled out "Let's take the hill," and we 
left the prisoners and broke. At the foot of the hill we came 
to a muddy rapid stream, from 10 to 15 feet wide and no cross- 
ing, so we plunged in. I got wet to my middle, and many did 
to their breasts. 

The banks were steep and slippery and muddy. Though we 
all expected a serious fight on the hill, up we went every man 
for himself, and through to an open field, over which some 200 
straggling sandy looking Johnnies were trying to get away, 
which most of them accomplished, as we were too tired to 
continue the pursuit fast enough to overtake them. How- 
ever, the boys shot a lot of them. Well, they call it a gallant 
thing. We took 542 prisoners, and killed and wounded I 
suppose loo. 

The whole loss in our brigade is not 10 killed and 50 
wounded. I only had one man wounded in my company, 
Corp. E. D. Slater. There were three killed and nine wounded 
in the regiment. 

There were three regiments of Rebels the 3ist, 4Oth and 
54th Alabama. They ought to have killed and wounded at 
least 500 of us, but we scared them out of it. They shot too 
high all the time. Osterhaus also had a hard fight to-day, 
was successful in taking a line of rifle pits. Thomas drove 
them a mile. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 263 

June 1 6, 1864. 

We moved back a mile last night, being relieved by the 
1 7th Corps. Taking it easy again to-day. There has been 
a lively artillery fight right in front of us to-day. Tell * * * 
if any of the 3ist or 4Oth Alabama officers report at Johnston's 
Island, to give them my compliments. One captain offered 
me his sword, but I hadn't time to stop. We wanted that 
hill, then. 

Near Big Shanty, Ga., June 17, 1864. 

Has rained steadily all day, wetting everybody, but "drying 
up" all shooting. A very disagreeable day. I saw 83 Rebels 
come in to-day, about one-half of whom were deserters and 
the rest figured to get captured. 

June 1 8, 1864. 

It rained steadily until 4 p. m. and had hardly ceased a 
minute when our guns opened and the skirmish lines joined 
issue. General Harrow and Colonel Wright rode out to the 
left some 200 yards from the regiment and narrowly escaped 
a trip over the river, a shell bursting right under the nose of 
the general's horse. 

June 19, 1864. 

This is the 5oth day of the campaign. Our brigade has 
been under musketry fire 12 days, artillery about 30. We have 
as a brigade fought three nice little battles, in as many days, 
repulsing two charges, and making one which was a perfect 
success. We have captured all told about 650 prisoners, and 
I think 1,000 a very low estimate of the number we have 
killed and wounded. I think Cheatham's and Bates' Rebel di- 
visions will say the same. We have thus cleared ourselves 
with a loss to us of nearly 300, or fully one-fifth of the com- 
mand. The other nine days we were on the skirmish line, in 
the rifle pits or front line. 



264 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

This morning an order was read to pursue the enemy im- 
mediately and in ten minutes the "assembly" was sounded. 
The enemy had fallen back on his flanks, and maybe was in- 
tending to evacuate, for our right had swung around him fur- 
ther than I, if in his place, would consider healthy. But he 
had not yet left the Twin Mountains. The line now runs from 
,/ right to left by Corps 23d, 2oth, 4th, I4th, I5th, i6th, i/th. 
The I4th Corps lost heavily to-day, but drove the Rebels four 
miles. The 23d Corps was still going at last accounts. The 
artillery firing to-day was beautiful. Our division advanced 
about one-half mile only. The Twin Mountains are right in 
front of us, and I have seen the Rebels shooting from six 
batteries on the crest and sides. Our batteries on a line 600 
yards in front answer them promptly. 

Only one shell has burst near us, and that 100 yards to our 
right. 

The 55th had one killed and two wounded just in front of 
us, by shells. All parts of the line advanced from one to five 
miles to-day, the right swinging forward farthest, a-la-gate. 
Osterhaus' headquarters are 30 yards to our right. A solid 
shot from the mountain went through one of his tents yester- 
day. It has rained hard all day, but nobody minds it a par- 
ticle. The general feeling is that the Rebels have fallen back 
to their main position, although they have abandoned ground 
that we would have held one against five. I can't hear that 
any line of battle has been engaged to-day, but the force on 
the advance skirmish lines was probably doubled at least. You 
would not smile at the idea of sleeping on the ground allotted 
to us to-night. Mud from six to eight inches deep. 

Same place, front of Twin Mountains, 

June 20, 1864, ii a. m. 

Rebels still on the mountain, a good deal of our artillery, a 
little of theirs, and not much musketry this morning. Wheeler 
is in our rear, but we don't care for that. I do hope, though, 
that Forrest will not be allowed to come over here. We are 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 265 

all well and feeling fine, but wishing very much to see the level 
country beyond these mountains. In a "Commercial" of the 
1 5th I see the Rebel loss in the charge of Bates' (Rebel) divi- 
sion on the 27th of May was 72 killed and 350 wounded, and 
56 missing. That charge was made almost altogether on our 
brigade, and my skirmish line did three-fourths of the damage. 
The 4Oth Alabama we captured the other day inquired for the 
8th Illinois. They fought each other at Vicksburg and got 
well acquainted in the rifle pits. McPherson and Logan have 
just gone down to the front and there is talk of a fight to-day, 
but it is hard telling when one will have to go in. Can't tell 
until the order to "commence" firing is heard. Wagstaff will 
be home in a few days. I would like to date my next from a 
new place, but Sherman and Johnston will decide that 
matter. 

This is becoming tedious. Johnston has no regard for one's 
feelings. We are all exceedingly anxious to see what is the 
other side of these mountains, but this abominable Johnston has 
no idea of letting us take a look until he is forced to. He is a 
good-natured fellow in some respects, too, for here we have 
our "flies" stretched, and our camp fires and our wagons 
around us in good range of his guns and not a shot does he 
give us. You understand that we are in reserve. Our front 
line is along the foot of the mountain, and we lay back about 
a mile. But it is all open between us and the front, and we 
sit in the shade, and (as we have this p. m.) see 20 Rebel guns 
firing on our men. Why they don't make us get out of this 
is beyond me to tell. Hundreds of wagons and ambulances 
are parked around us, and right by us is parked the reserve 
artillery of our corps, all in plain view of the Rebels on the 
mountains, but not a gun is fired at us. Yesterday they 
dropped one shell a hundred yards to our right and quit, as 
much as to say: "We could stir you Yanks if we wanted to, 
but it is all right." 

I don't know how this looks to outsiders, but it seems to me 
as the coolest thing of the campaign, pitching tents right under 
the enemy's guns, without a particle of cover. Being under 



266 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

artillery fire in a fight or while supporting a battery is all right, 
and if we were in rifle pits or behind the crest of a hill 
'twould be ditto, but moving right out and pitching tents un- 
der the noses of Rebel 32-pounders beats me and I guess it 
beats them. We all feel a pride in the thing and I'd see the 
the Johnnies to the devil before I'd dodge the biggest cannon 
ball they've got there. The artillery this p. m. has been the 
heaviest I have heard this campaign. 

June 21, 1864. 

No variation to report to-day. Heavy rain yesterday 
and to-day. Some 350 prisoners were sent in from the 
right yesterday, and about 80 more that I know of to-day. 
Figure that we have taken about 3,000 prisoners at this 
place. Since the army went into position here the right 
has advanced about six miles, the center two miles, and the 
left three and one-half to four miles. The musketry from 
dark last night until n p. m. was very busy in front of the 
4th Corps, though it may have been only a heavy skirmish 
line. I hear to-day that the 4th Corps took a strong Rebel 
position last night while that firing was going on and held 
it. 

June 22, 1864. 

Our Adjutant Wagstaff is out of the service and the 
recommendation for Frank Lermond to receive the ap- 
pointment has gone on to Governor Yates. Frank is well 
worthy of the place and has earned it. We flatter our- 
selves that no regiment has less skulkers than ours in 
battle, and we have through the corps, a name that Fulton 
need not fear will disgrace her. We have all day been 
ready at a moment's notice to support the 4th Corps. Saw 
Chandler yesterday. He is on M. L. Smith's staff. I wish 
a little party of Cantonians could be here to-night to see 
the artillery firing. Our view of the Rebel guns is excel- 
lent. With glasses we can see them load. The artillerists 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 267 

say our field glasses are not so good. Many are prophesy- 
ing that the Johnnies will vamoose during the "stilly 
night." Much as I want to, can't see it. Looks like too 
good a thing. 

June 23, 1864, 9 a. m. 

The Rebels opened furiously from the mountain last 
night about 12. Here they are firing at a division of 
the I4th who had advanced and were fortifying. No harm 
done. I failed to wake up. It is reported this morning 
that Ewell's Corps has arrived to reinforce Johnston. 
Don't think it will make him strong enough to assume the 
offensive, if true, and don't believe it any way. Artillery 
commenced again half an hour since, and goes on slowly. 
Rebels haven't gone, surely. 

Front of Kenesaw Mountain, June 26, 1864. 
Nothing worth mentioning has occurred since my last. 
The usual amount of artillery and musketry have kept 
us sure of the enemy's still holding his position. I have 
sent you, piecemeal, a journal of every day since May ist, 
excepting the last four days, which were stupid. It prom- 
ises to be interesting enough now. We received orders 
yesterday p. m. to be ready to move at dark, and were all 
glad enough. When we are in the face of the enemy I 
believe one is better contented in the front line than any- 
where else, though, like every other good thing, it becomes 
old. At 7 p. m. we moved out and it took us until 2 a. m. 
to march three miles. We relieved Jeff C. Davis' division, 
which moved farther to the right. It is right at the foot 
of the west one of the twin mountains. The Johnnies 
shot into our ranks with impunity. They have to-day 
killed one and wounded three of our brigade that I know 
of, and more in the ist Brigade. Dr. Morris' brother is the 
only man struck in our regiment; he is not hurt much. 



268 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

June 27, 1864, daylight. 

The battle comes off to-day. It will be opened on the 
flanks at 6 a. m. We do not commence until 8 a. m. Our 
brigade and one from each of the other two divisions of 
the corps are selected to charge the mountain. The I7th 
A. C. will try the left hand mountain. If we are successful 
with a loss of only half our number in this mountain 
charging, I will think our loss more than repaid. I believe 
we are going to thoroughly whip Johnston to-day, and if 
we fail I do not care to live to see it. 

June 28, 1864. 

The attack was not general ; it was made by our brigade 
and M. L. Smith's Division. We lost nearly one-third of 
the brigade. Our regiment's loss is 17 killed and 40 
wounded. My company had five killed and four wounded. 
Colonel Wright was shot quite badly in the leg, and Lieu- 
tenants Montgomery, Branson and Bailey were killed. In 
my company Corporals Whittaker, Myers, and Private Sam 
Mclntyre, Art. Myers, and Jacob Maxwell, were killed 
Sergeant Breed, Privates Bishop, Frank Breed and James 
Williamson were wounded. We held all the ground we 
took (under our fire), but had to leave a few of our dead 
until dark. 

On the p. m. of the 26th Colonel Wright told me that 
General McPherson and Colonel Walcutt (our brigade 
commander) had been out through the day examining the 
ground in front, and that it was in contemplation to carry 
the southwest spur of the mountain by a charge, and 
further, that it was not impossible that our brigade would 
be in as usual. This was kept quiet in the command. 
About 8 p. m. I was at Colonel Wright's headquarters 
with several of the officers and we were talking the matter 
over, when an order came for the colonel to report at 
brigade headquarters. I believe every one present in- 
stantly concluded that we were to fight, and knowing the 
country before us to be about on a par with Lookout 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 269 

Mountain you can imagine we did not particularly enjoy 
the prospect. The colonel returned in about an hour. We 
had all, I believe, fallen asleep. He woke us and said: 
"Have your men get their breakfasts by daylight; at 6 
a. m. the fight will begin on the right, and at 8 a. m. our 
brigade will, with one from the ist and 2d divisions, 
charge a spur of the mountain." I turned away and after 
notifying my orderly sergeant to have the men up on 
time, I turned in. Thought the matter over a little while 
and after pretty fully concluding "good-bye, vain world," 
went to sleep. Before daylight in the morning we were in 
line, and moving a few hundred yards to the rear of our 
works, and stacked arms in a grove, which would hide us 
from the observation of the Rebels on the mountain. You 
know from where we have been for a few days, we could 
see them plainly. Cannonading commenced on the right 
at 6 a. m. and at 7:30 we moved a half or three quarters 
of a mile along our lines to the right, after piling our knap- 
sacks and haversacks. A canteen of water was the only 
extra baggage any one carried. The Rebels caught sight of 
us as we commenced moving, and opened a battery on us It 
had the effect to accelerate our movements considerably. 
Right in front of a Division of the 4th Corps we halted, 
and rapidly formed our line. While forming the line Cor- 
poral Myers of my company was killed by a bullet within 
six feet of me, and one of Company K's men wounded. 
I don't know how many more. The ground to be gone 
over was covered with a dense undergrowth of oak and 
vines of all kinds binding the dead and live timber and 
bush together, and making an almost impenetrable abatis. 
To keep a line in such a place was out of the question. 
Our skirmishers were sharply engaged from the start, and 
men commenced falling in the main line ; at the same time 
some 50 of the Rebel skirmish line were captured, and 
many of them killed. A Rebel lieutenant and five men lay 
dead, all nearly touching each other. 



2/O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

I understand that they had been summoned to surrender, 
and were shot either for refusing or before negotiations 
were completed. Not a man in our regiment knew where 
the Rebel works were when we started, and I think the 
most of them found them as I did. I had with my com- 
pany got within, I think, 60 yards of the Rebel works, 
and was moving parallel with them. The balls were 
whistling thick around us, but I could see no enemy ahead. 

I did not even think of them being on our flank, until 
one of the boys said: "Look there, Captain, may I shoot?" 
I looked to the right, and just across a narrow and deep 
ravine were the Rebel works, while a confused mass of 
greybacks were crowding up the ravine. These latter, I 
suppose, were from their skirmish line, which was very 
heavy, and trying to escape us. The Rebels in the works 
were firing vigorously and have no excuse for not anni- 
hilating our three left companies K, G and B. The right of 
the regiment had seen them before and already started for 
them. I shouted "forward" to my men and we ran down 
across the ravine, and about one-third the way up the hill 
on which their works were and then lay down. There was 
little protection from their fire, though, and if they had 
done their duty, not a man of us would have got out alive. 
Our men fired rapidly and kept them well down in their 
works. It would have been madness to have attempted 
carrying their works then, for our regiment had not a 
particle of support, and we were so scattered that we only 
presented the appearance of a very thin skirmish line. If 
we had been supported by only one line, I have no doubt 
but that we would have taken their line of works. Colonel 
Wright was wounded a few minutes after we got into the 
hollow, and Frank Lermond came to me and told me I 
would have to take command of the regiment. I went 
down to the center and the order was heard to retire. I 
communicated it to the left and saw nearly all the men out, 
and then fell back. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 27! 

I could not find the regiment when I came out, but col- 
lected about 30 of our men on the left of the 6th Iowa, and 
after a while Colonel Wright and Captain Post brought 
the regiment to where we were, when we formed a brigade 
line and threw up works within 200 yards of the enemy's, 
where we remained until 9 p. m., when we returned to the 
position we occupied in the morning. About 12 of our 
dead were left in the ravine under the fire of the enemy's 
guns. But we have as many of their dead as they have of 
ours. Lieutenant Colonel Barnhill of the 4Oth Illinois, and 
Captain Augustine of the 55th Illinois were killed and left 
on the field. My loss is five killed and four wounded. Two 
of my dead, Corporal Whittaker and Artemus Myers, were 
left on the field. Loss in the regiment is 17 killed, 40 
wounded. In the brigade 245 killed and wounded. It was 
a rough affair, but we were not whipped. The prettiest 
artillery fight I ever saw was over our heads in the even- 
ing, about 10 guns on each side. 

June 29, 1864. 

There was a night charge made by the Rebels on our right 
last night. They got beautifully "scooped." We have been 
laying quiet all day. Lots of artillery, though but few shots 
come near us. 

June 30, 1864, 8 a. m. 

There was a terrific fight on our right, commencing at 2 
this morning and lasting until 3. I have not yet heard what it 
was. 

Some deserters passed us this morning. I have lost just 
half the men I left Scottsboro with just two months ago, 
but what I have left, are every man ready to help. We have 
a good deal more than "cleared" ourselves. I had my canteen 
strap cut off by a bullet and a spent glancing ball struck my 
ankle. 



2/2 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

July I, 1864. 

This campaign is coming down to a question of muscle 
and nerve. It is the 62d day for us, over 50 of which we 
have passed under fire. I don't know anything more exhaust- 
ing. One consolation is that the Rebels are a good deal worse 
off than we are. They have lost more men in battle, their 
deserters count by thousands, and their sick far exceed ours. 
We'll wear them out yet. Our army has been reinforced by 
fully as many as we have lost in action, so that our loss will 
not exceed our sick. You notice in the papers acounts of 
Hooker's charging "Lost Mountain," taking a large number 
of prisoners, and the names of officers. You see they are all 
from the 3ist and 4Oth Alabama. It is also credited to Blair's 
1 7th Corps. Our brigade took all those officers on the i$th of 
June. I wrote you an account of it then. It hurts us some 
to see it credited to other troops, but such is the fortune of 
war, and soldiers who do not keep a reporter must expect it. 
Colonel Wright starts for home to-day. 

July 2, 1864. 

We have been taking it easy since the charge. Our shells 
keep the Rebels stirred up all the time. Sham attacks are also 
got up twice or three times a day, which must annoy them very 
much. 

July 3, 1864. 

Rebels all gone this morning. Our boys were on the moun- 
tains at daylight. Hundreds of deserters have come in. Os- 
terhaus moved around the left of the mountain to Marietta, 
all the rest of the army went to the right of it. We are about 
one-half a mile from town; have not been in. All who have, 
say it is the prettiest place we have seen South. Some artil- 
lery firing has been heard this p. m. five or six miles south, 
and there are rumors that an advance has captured a large 
number of prisoners, but nothing reliable. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2/3 

July 4, 1864. 

I count it the hardest Fourth I have seen in the service. 
About 8 a. m. we moved out, passed through Marietta, which 
is by far the prettiest town I have seen South (about the size 
of Canton), and continued south nearly all the way along 
our line ol works. Marched about n miles. Not more than 
one-third of the men stacked arms when we halted for the 
night; fell out along the roads. I have seen more than 1,000 
prisoners and deserters. 

July 5, 1864. 

Can hear no firing this p. m. It seems the Rebels have got 
across the Chattahoochie. We are about 12 miles from At- 
lanta. The river will probably trouble us some, but we all 
think "Pap" will make it before August 1st. Johnston don't 
dare give us anything like a fair fight. We are all in splendid 
spirits and the boys have made the woods ring with their 
Fourth of July cheers, tired as they are. We have lost no 
men since the charge of the 2/th. I have an Atlanta paper, 
giving an acount of that fight. They say we were all drunk 
with whisky and fought more like devils than men. 

p. m. 

We have continued our march about four or five miles to- 
day. Osterhaus and M. L. Smith are ahead of us ,and I 
think we are on the right of the army again. The 4th Divi- 
sion, i /th Army Corps is engaged one-half mile ahead of us 
or rather are shooting a little with their big guns. I climbed 
a tree a half hour ago, and what do you think? saw 
Atlanta, and saw it plainly, too. I suppose it is ten miles dis- 
tant, not more than 12. The country looks about as level as 
a floor, excepting one-half mountain, to the left of the city, 
some miles. We seem to be on the last ridge that amounts to 
anything. We are, I suppose, two and one-half miles from the 
river at this point, though we hold it farther to the right. 
Very large columns of smoke were rolling up from different 
parts of the city. I suppose they were the explosions of foun- 



274 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

dries, machine shops, etc. Dense clouds of dust can be seen 
at several points across the river; suppose it means trains or 
troops moving. 

Have seen but few wounded going back to-day. We are 
laying along some very good rifle pits, occasionally embra- 
sured for artillery, which the I7th Army Corps took this 
morning. They were not very stoutly defended, though, and 
the artillery had been moved back. With some pretty lively 
skirmishing the line has been advanced this evening. Not 
much loss on our side; saw some one-half dozen ambulance 
loads only. 

July 6, 1864. 

I went down to our front this evening. Our advanced ar- 
tillery is yet some 1,200 yards from the Rebels, but there is 
nothing but an open field between, and it looks quite close. 
The Johnnies have thrown up a nice fort, embrasured for nine 
guns. They have not fired a shot to-day. The captain of our 
advanced artillery told me the Rebels have 20 Parrott guns in 
the fort, and excellent gunners. 

We moved this evening one mile to the left and relieved a 
portion of the 2Oth Corps, which went on further to the left. 

We started on this campaign with 10 field officers in our 
brigade and now have but two left. Three killed, three 
wounded and two left back sick. I hear the Rebel works here 
are the last this side of the river, and but few hundred yards 
from it. 

July 7, 1864. 

The shooting still continues in our front, but hear no Rebel 
artillery. The water here is excellent, and everybody seems 
to get a few blackberries. We also stew grapes and green 
apples, and everything that ever was eaten by anti-cannibals. 
There is so much confounded fighting to be attended to that 
we can't forage any, and though fresh beef is furnished to 
the men regularly there is some scurvy. I have seen several 
black-mouthed, loose-toothed fellows, hankering after pickles. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 275 

Teamsters and hangers-on who stay in the rear get potatoes, 
etc., quite regularly. I do not believe the Johnnies intend 
fighting again very strongly this side of the river. Our scouts 
say that between the river and Atlanta the works run line 
after line as thickly as they can be put in. Per contra, two 
women who came from Atlanta on the 6th say that after we 
get across the river we will have no fighting, that Johnston 
is sending his troops to Savannah, Charleston, Mobile and 
Richmond, except enough to fight us at different river 
crossings. Our scouts also say that the Rebels are de- 
serting almost by thousands, and going around our flanks to 
their homes in Tennessee, Kentucky, etc. I have not been in 
a house in Georgia, but several citizens I have met in camp 
said they had heard many soldiers say they would never cross 
the river with Johnston since the charge of the 27th. 

Harrow has kept our brigade in reserve, and I think he will 
continue to do so unless a general battle is fought. We have 
suffered more heavily than any other two brigades in the army, 
and when we started we were one of the smallest. I am will- 
ing to see some of the others go in a while, though I want to 
help if Johnston will stand a fair fight in open ground. The 
chigres are becoming terrific. They are as large as the blunt 
end of a No. 12 and as red as blood. They will crawl through 
any cloth and bite worse than a flea, and poison the flesh 
very badly. They affect some more than others. I get along 
with them comparatively well, that is, I don't scratch more 
than half the time. Many of the boys anoint their bodies with 
bacon rinds, which the chigres can't go. Salt-water bathing 
also bars chigres, but salt is too scarce to use on human meat. 
Some of the boys bathing now in a little creek in front of me ; 
look like what I expect "Sut Lovegood's" father did after 
plowing through that hornet's nest. All done by chigres. I 
believe I pick off my neck and clothes 30 varieties of measur- 
ing worm every day. Our brigade quartermaster yesterday 
found, under his saddle in his tent, a rattlesnake, with six 
rattles and a button.

276 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

This is the 68th day of the campaign. We hope to end it 
by August ist, though if we can end the war by continuing 
this until January ist, '65, I am in. Reinforcements are com- 
ing in every day, and I don't suppose we are any weaker than 
when we left Chattanooga. The Rebels undoubtedly are, be- 
sides the natural demoralization due to falling back so much 
must be awful. My health is excellent. Remember me to all 
the wounded boys of the iO3d you see. 

Nine miles from Atlanta, two and one-half miles south- 
west of railroad crossing, 

July 9, 1864. . 

On the evening of the 7th, just dark, a Rebel battery in a 
fort which our guns had been bursting shells over all day, 
suddenly opened with eight 2o-pound Parrotts, and for one- 
half an hour did some of the most rapid work I ever heard. 
They first paid their attention to our batteries, then demol- 
ished some half-dozen wagons and 20 mules for the 4th Di- 
vision of the I7th Army Corps half a mile to our right, and 
then began scattering their compliments along our line, 
wherever I suppose they had detected our presence by smoke 
or noise. They kept getting closer and closer to us, and finally, 
a shell burst in front of our regiment. The next one went 50 
yards past us and dropped into the 4Oth Illinois. Neither of 
them did any damage, and no more came so close. An hour 
afterward we fell in, and moving a mile to the left and one- 
half a mile to the front, occupied a ridge which we fortified by 
daylight, so they might shell and be hanged. 

The Rebel skirmishers heard us moving as we came over, 
and threw more than a thousand bullets at us, but it was so 
pitchy dark that fortunately they did us no damage. From 
our colors we can see the fort that fired so the night of the 
7th. They are about three-fourths of a mile distant. There 
have not been any bullets or shells passed over us since we got 
our works up, though the skirmish line at the foot of the hill, 
has a lively time. We have it very easy. I was on the 8th in 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 277 

charge of a line of skirmishers on the left of our brigade. 
The Rebels were seemingly quite peaceable, so much so, that 
I thought I'd walk over to some blackberry bushes 50 yards in 
front of our right. 

I got about half way out when they sent about a dozen bul- 
lets at me. I retired in good order, considering. In the p. m. 
of the 7th, the skirmishers in front of a brigade of the 2Oth 
Corps, and the Rebel line, left their guns, and went out and 
were together nearly all the afternoon; 13 of the Rebels agreed 
to come into our line after dark. At the time appointed, heavy 
firing commenced on the Rebel side, and our boys, fearing 
foul play, poured in a few volleys. Through the heaviest of 
the fire two of the Rebels came running in. They said that 
the 13 started, and that the Rebels opened on them. The rest 
were probably killed. One of my men has just returned from 
visiting his brother in the 2Oth Corps. It is reported there that 
the 23d Corps crossed the river this p. m. without losing a 
man. The heavy firing this evening was our folks knocking 
down some block houses at the railroad bridge. The 4th 
Corps to-night lays right along the river bank. 

July 10, 1864, a. m. 

The Rebels evacuated last night, and our flags are on their 
works and our skirmishers at the river. A number of John- 
nies were left on this side. I believe they have every time left 
on Saturday night or Sunday. Their works here are the best 
I have seen. Three lines and block houses ad libitum. P. m. 
Every Rebel is across the river, and our 23d and i6th Corps 
are also over, away up to the left. It is intimated though that 
they will only hold their position a few days. We are expect- 
ing orders to join them. 

July 12, 1864. 

We lay quietly in the shade all day the nth, save those who 
had ambition enough to go fishing, berrying or swimming. 
The other bank of the Chattahoochie opposite us is yet lined 
with Rebel sharp-shooters, but there is a fine creek from which 



278 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

the boys get some fine fish. I saw an eel two feet long which 
came from it. Our boys never have made any bargain with 
the Johnnies to quit picket firing, even for an hour, but other 
corps and divisions often do. It would almost break the 
heart of one of our boys to see a Rebel without getting a shot 
at him. On the I2th, at 5 p. m., the "General" and "Assem- 
bly" sounded almost together, and we were under way in a 
twinkling. We understand we are going back to Marietta, 
and then over the river where the 23d Corps crossed it. We 
stopped here (about seven miles from Marietta), at n p. m., 
and had reveille at 3 this morning. Stoneman, with at least 
10,000 cavalry, recrossed the river on the night of the loth on 
a grand raid between Atlanta and Montgomery. We had a 
real amusing scene last night. About 12 o'clock we were 
nearly all asleep, when a mule came charging at full speed 
right through our regiment. In an instant every man was on 
his feet, and all who knew what was up, were swinging blank- 
ets and shouting whoa ! The most of us did not know whether 
a cavalry charge was on us or the devil. Many of the men 
caught up their guns, and "treed," and altogether it was most 
ludicrous. Our regiment now marches 190 guns and 7 offi- 
cers. I have 20 guns, all I started with, except what I have 
lost in battle. Just half. 

July 13, 1864. 

We passed through Marietta this morning at 9; rested in 
a cool, nice, woody place from u to 2, and made this place 
in the cool of the evening. We marched about 14 miles to- 
day. I would rather be in a fight than endure such a day's 
march, and I think fighting lacks very much as deserving to 
rank as amusement. 

I saw a number of cases of congestion of the brain, and a 
few had real sun stroke. Saw one poor fellow in a grave- 
yard between two little picketed graves, who I made sure was 
gasping his last. Some heartless fellow made a remark as we 
passed about his luck in getting sun struck so near good bury- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2/9 

ing facilities. After one heat of only three miles the regiment 
had all fallen out but about 50 men, and we had more than any 
other in the brigade. If we had been given one hour more in 
rests, we would not have lost a man. 

July 14, 1864. 

Another hot day. We marched down to the river at Roswell 
and crossed it, and have gone into camp on the bank a mile 
above town. 

This Roswell is a beautiful little town, such splendid trees 
all through it. Our cavalry four or five days ago destroyed 
some very large factories here. Judging from the ruins, they 
were more extensive than anything of the kind I ever before 
saw. About 1,000 women were employed in them; 700 of 
them were taken by our folks and sent to Marietta; I don't 
know what for. Can't hear of any enemy here. 

July 15, 1864. 

This is a glorious place. The current in the river is very 
swift, and it is the nicest stream to bathe in imaginable. I've 
a mind to stay here and have my meals brought to me. Ex- 
pect we will catch some nice fish after they get over being 
scared at having so many Yanks bobbing around with them. 
It is too hot to write, and altogether too hot to enjoy good 
health, except in swimming. We are all glad to hear of those 
raids into Pennsylvania and Maryland. Go in Imboden and 
Early. 

July 16, 1864, /6th of the Campaign. 

I can hear no firing to-day, but we are so far from the 
right or center that we could hear nothing less than a 
13-inch mortar. I will tell you all I know of the situation 
just to let you know how little a soldier knows of what is going 
on. In papers of this date you will see twice as much. The 
1 7th Army Corps lies on the right bank of the river, and to 
the right of the army, six miles below the railroad crossing, 
skirmishing with the enemy on the opposite side. Next 



280 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

comes the 2Oth, I4th and 4th on the same side, the 4th 
lying across the railroad four miles, further up the 23d 
crossed the river, but probably only holds a position, as we 
do. Then the i6th Corps joins the left of the 23d, and the 
I5th last, both on the left bank. Not being perfect in 
heavy strategy, I can't exactly see the point, but no doubt 
Sherman does. I suppose the 4th, I4th and 2Oth Corps 
will cross near the railroad bridge, and be the first to 
occupy Atlanta. If we can't get to give Johnston a sound 
thrashing, I don't care about marching another step until 
fall. Health of the regiment still good, but we are expect- 
ing sickness soon. We have had a terrific thunderstorm, 
killed five men and wounded eight in the i8th Missouri, and 
killed a teamster and some mules. I never saw but one 
or two more severe ones. 

June 17, 1864. 

After erecting some good works at Roswell (the best 
we have yet built), capable of holding at least 25,000 men, 
we were provided with three days' rations and cartridges 
"ad libitum," for another of what an Augusta paper calls 
"Sherman leap-frog-like advance." Our corps is the ex- 
treme left of the army. We moved out this morning, our 
brigade in advance of our division, and Osterhaus and 
Smith's Divisions following on the Decatur road. Did 
I tell you in my last among the "locals," that these Roswell 
factories have been turning out 35,000 yards per day of 
jeans, etc., for the Confederate Army, that there is the 
greatest abundance of blackberries and whortleberries 
here, that one of the 48th Illinois was drowned in the 
Chattahoochie while bathing, and that of several hundred 
factory girls I have seen, hardly one who is passably 
handsome? Some fine fat ones, and a few neat feet, but 
they are not "clipper built," and lack "get up" and "figure 
heads." 

We moved six miles without meeting a Rebel, and then 
only a squadron of cavalry that lacked a devilish sight of 
being "chivalry," for they more than ran without just 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 281 

cause. We only went two miles farther and then bivou- 
acked. Our brigade was thrown half a mile in front and 
across the road. We put up a rail barricade across the 
road and a temporary rail-work along our front, and then 
abandoned ourselves to the longings of our breadbaskets, 
and desisted not until every man was in himself a miniature 
blackberry patch. The boys brought me pint after pint 
of great black fellows they had picked in the shade of dense 
woods or on a steep bank, and I assure you tHey dis- 
appeared without an exception. This road, the last 10 
days, has been filled with refugee citizens running from 
the Yankees. An old gentleman in whose yard the reserve 
pickets have stacked their arms, told me that all the men 
of his acquaintance over 45 years old are, and always have 
been, Unionists, and are to-day ready and willing to give 
up slavery for our cause. I have been a deluded believer 
in the hoax of fine "Georgia plantations," but I assure you 
I am now thoroughly convalescent. I haven't seen five 
farm houses equal to Mrs. James , and only one that 
showed evidences of taste. That was where I saw the 
Rebel General Iverson dead among the flowers. The coun- 
try is all hilly, and the soil, where there is any, is only fit 
for turnips. The timber is all scrub oak and pine, and 
some more viney bushes peculiar to the climate. 

I notice some of the white moss hanging from the trees, 
like that there was so much of at Black river. The i6th 
Corps is on our right moving on a parallel road, and the 
23d joins them. I don't know whether our other corps 
have crossed yet or not. 

Near Stone Mountain, July 18, 1864. 

Osterhaus (or his division, for I hear that he resigned 
and yesterday started for the North, en route for Mexico, 
where he formerly resided, and that he intends entering 
the Mexican Army to fight "Johnny Crapeau") was ahead 
to-day, and only lost a dozen or 50 men. Our brigade has 
been train guard, and we did not get into camp until n 



282 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

p. m. This night marching hurts us more than the hottest 
day marching. We camp to-night near Stone Mountain, 
and the depot of the same name 16 miles from Atlanta. 
It is evident to me that the Army of the Tennessee is doing 
the "flanking them out" this time. The ist Division cut 
the railroad effectually. A train came from the East while 
they were at it, but discovering the smoke, reversed the 
engine and escaped. The i/th Corps I hear is close behind 
us protecting the commissary trains and forming our rear 
guard. 

Decatur, Ga., July 19, 1864. 

To-night we are in Decatur, six miles from Atlanta. 
The Rebels were yet in Atlanta this morning, for they ran 
a train to this burg this morning, but they may now be 
gone. Our line of battle crosses the railroad nearly at 
right angles, facing Atlanta. I think the 23d Corps has 
swung around in front of us, and the i6th Corps is now on 
our left. Our cavalry had some fighting after I p. m. 
today. A citizen says there was nearly 4,500 Rebel cavalry 
here. A small portion of our mounted forces made a half- 
charge on the Johnnies just this side of town, and the 
Rebels stampeded. They knew we had a large force, and, 
of course, could not tell just what number was coming on 
them. They broke down every fence in town and ran 
over everything but the houses in their mad panic to get 
away. Our men, as usual, all stopped in town to flank the 
onions, potatoes, chickens and sundries, in which they 
were busily engaged when the Rebels, who had rallied 
and got a battery in position, opened right lively. Our 
men drove them away, and then all hands went to foraging 
again. To-morrow night, I think, will give us Atlanta, 
or there will be a fair start for a new graveyard near the 
town. I hear no fighting on the right. We have passed 
over the same miserable looking country to-day. I caught 
a small scorpion to-day, also a reddish brown bug not 
quite as large as a thrush, and as savage as a mad rat. 
Wish I could preserve some of these bugs and things; I 
know you'd like 'em 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 283 

July 20, 1864. 

Assembly has just sounded. In a few hours we will 
know if it is to be a fight. Frank says we are detailed for 
train guard. If the army marches right into Atlanta, I'll 
think it d d mean, but if there is a fight will not feel so 
badly, unless we can get a big battle out of Johnston. I 
want to help in that. We have moved up near the town 
the army has gone on. Can hear heavy guns occasionally, 
sounds about three miles away, half the distance to the 
city. 

This little town is quite an old place. About half the citi- 
zens are still here. I saw a couple of right pretty girls. Some 
Confederate prisoners tell me that Johnston is gone to Rich- 
mond, and that Hood is commanding and intends to fight us 
at Atlanta. 

The wheat and oats raised this year in this part of Georgia, 
if it had all been saved, would not more than have fed the 
citizens. Full one-half the cornfields will not turn out any- 
thing. 

July 23, 1864. 

The fight came off the 22d, and a glorious one it was for 
us. Lieutenant Blair of our regiment was killed, also Charles 
Buck, of Company F, and John Smith of my company. There 
were seven wounded only. Our brigade gets credit for 400 
prisoners. They took us in rear and every other way, but the 
repulse was awful. Everybody is wishing that they may re- 
peat the attack. Generals McPherson and Force are killed. 
(Force, was not killed.) Our regiment gets credit for its part, 
though we were very fortunate in losing so few. Our skirmish 
line is within one mile of the town. 

July 25, 1864. 

We moved up to the rear of the corps on the 21, and had 
just got comfortably fixed for the night when orders came 
that we should report back to the brigade on the front line. 
Just as we started a heavy rain set in, and continued while we 



284 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

marched one and one-half miles to the left, where we stacked 
arms in rear of a line of work occupied by the 6th Iowa. The 
Rebel line lay in plain sight, just across an open field, and the 
bullets made us keep pretty close. 

At sunset we were ordered to extend, or rather build a line 
of works to hold our regiment, between the 6th Iowa and 4Oth 
Illinois. We had fairly commenced, and the boys were scat- 
tered everywhere, bringing rails, logs, etc., when the Johnnie's 
bugle sounded "forward," and the Rebels raised a yell and 
fired a couple of volleys into us. There was a lively rush for 
our guns, but we saw through it in a minute, and in three 
minutes were at work again. Only two men were hurt in the 
regiment, one from Company C, and Wm. Nicholson of my 
company had the small bone of his leg broken just above the 
ankle. We got our works in shape about daylight, and about 
8 a. in. I heard a cheer from our skirmishers, and saw the 
Rebel skirmishers run right over their works like deer. Our 
line followed them and took possession of their works, and no 
Rebel or works being in sight, and our boys knowing they 
were only two miles from Atlanta, thought sure they had 
the town, and all started on the "double quick" for it, yelling, 
"potatoes" or "tobacco," or what he particularly hankered for. 
They got along swimmingly until within about three-quarters 
of a mile from town, when they ran against a strong line of 
works and were brought up standing, by a volley therefrom. 
They deployed immediately, and by the time their officers got 
up had a good line established, and were whacking away at the 
fort apparently as well satisfied as if they had got their to- 
baco. 

McPherson had an idea that all was not right, for our line 
was allowed to advance no further than the one the Rebels had 
left, and we were set to work changing its front. At dinner 
when we were about leaving "the table," Captain Smith men- 
tioned hearing some heavy skirmishing in our rear as we came 
to our meal. That was the first any of us knew of the battle. 
In a few minutes we all heard it plainly, and from our works 
could see exactly in our rear a body of grey coats, advance 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 285 

from a wood and the battle opened, although we did not know 
what troops of ours were engaged. Have since heard it was 
a portion of the i6th Corps who were moving out to extend 
the line. Their being just in that position was a piece of luck, 
as it saved the trains of the Army of the Tennessee, and, per- 
haps, the whole army. I should think they fought an hour 
before the battle swung around toward us. During the battle, 
our regiment changed position three times, facing east, west 
and south. We helped repulse four charges, took 115 
prisoners, and helped take 400 more. Also ran the enemy out 
of a line of works they had taken from our 3d brigade, and 
the best of it is, we lost only ten men. I cannot for my life 
see how we escaped so well. General Blair is reported to have 
said that the Army of the Tennessee is eternally disgraced 
for going outside of all precedent, in refusing to be whipped 
when attacked in flank and rear, as well as in front. Hood 
confines his strategy to maneuvering troops for battle, and 
pretends to be emphatically a "fighting cock." He attacked 
Thomas on the 2Oth and 2ist, away on the right, and on the 
22d walked into us. He got his comb badly cut, and if I 
am any prophet at all, will not attempt another fight soon. 
Sherman estimates the enemy's loss in the three days' fight- 
ing at 12,000. Our loss in the same time is less than 3,500. I 
am surprised that we have not attacked them in return before 
this, but am far from anxious to charge their works. Although 
I do know that if we charge with two lines as good as our 
brigade, and don't go too fast, we can take any ordinary works. 
The prisoners we got the other day were run down. When 
our regiment drove the Rebels out of the works of the 
3d brigade, a man shot through the thigh, asked me for water 
as I passed him. I asked him if the Rebels robbed him, he 
said, no, but they killed a man in the ditch with a spade right 
in front of him. I looked where he pointed and found a 9/th 
Indiana boy with his thigh broken by a pistol shot, and three 
cuts in his face by a spade. He was not dead, he knew me, 
and reached out his hand smiling. He said an officer rode up 
with some footmen and told him to surrender, when he shot 



286 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

the officer and ran his bayonet through one of the men. An- 
other shot him, and the man he bayoneted used the spade on 
him. McPherson was killed early in the fight. The Rebels 
had his body a few minutes, but the i6th Corps charged and 
retook it. Altogether, it was the prettiest fight I ever saw. 

The Rebel plan of attack was excellent, and if their assault- 
ing columns had charged simultaneously, there is no telling 
what might have been the upshot. As it was, part of I7th 
Corps changed position in their breastworks three times, that 
is, repulsed an assault from one side, and being attacked from 
the rear, jumped over and fought them the other way. I was 
up to where the 2Oth and 3ist Illinois fought. The dead Reb- 
els lay about as thick on one side of the works as the other, and 
right up to them. Two more fights like this, and there will 
be no more Rebel army here. We lost about 600 prisoners, 
and took 2,000. 

Garrard's cavalry division went out to Covington on the 
Augusta road. Am just going on picket. 

One and three-quarter miles southwest of Atlanta, 

July 29, 1864. 

On the evening of the 26th, Adj. Frank Lermond sent me 
word that the Army of the Tennessee was going to evacuate 
its position, the movement to commence at 12 p. m. When the 
lines are so close together the skirmish line is a ticklish place. 

The parties can tell by hearing artillery move, etc., nearly 
what is going on, and in evacuation generally make a dash 
for the skirmish line or rear guard. At nearly every position 
Johnston has fortified we caught his skirmish line when he 
evacuated. Luckily our line got off about 4 a. m. on the 27th 
though they shelled us right lively. 

That day our three corps moved along in the rear of the 
23d, 4th, 1 4th and 2oth, the intention being, I think, to ex- 
tend the line to the right, if possible, to the Montgomery 
and Atlanta railroad and thus destroy another line of com- 
munication. We have thoroughly destroyed 50 miles of the 
Augusta and Atlanta railroad. The i6th Corps formed its 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 287 

line on the right of the I4th, and the I7th joined on the i6th, 
and on the morning of the 28th, we moved out to extend the 
line still further. At 12 m. we had just got into position 
and thrown a few rails along our line, when Hood's Rebel 
corps came down on Morgan L's and our divisions like an 
avalanche. Our two divisions did about all the fighting, and it 
lasted until 5 p. m. 

We whipped them awfully. Their dead they left almost in 
line of battle along our entire front of two divisions. 

It was the toughest fight of the campaign, but not a foot 
of our line gave way, and our loss is not one-twentieth of 
theirs. The rails saved us. I am tired of seeing such butchery 
but if they will charge us that way once a day for a week, 
this corps will end the war in this section. 

Our loss in the regiment was 17 out of 150 we had in the 
fight, and the brigade loss will not exceed i'oo. I never saw 
so many Rebels dead. We are in excellent spirits, and pro- 
pose to take Atlanta whenever Sherman wants it. 

August i, 1864. 

Since the glorious battle of the 28th, everything has been 
quiet in our immediate front, though the heavy artillery firing 
continues to the left. I think it is between the I4th and 2Oth 
Corps and some Rebel forts. Prisoners say that our shells 
have hurt the city very much. We all think that the last 
battle is by far the most brilliant of the campaign. Our offi- 
cials' reports show that we buried 1,000 Rebels in front of 
our and M. L. Smith's divisions. 

In fact, our two divisions and two regiments of Osterhaus' 
did all the fighting. Our total loss was less than 550, the 
Rebels 8,000. In the last 12 days they must have lost 25,000 
men. Our loss in the same time will not reach 4,500. There 
is no shadow of gas in this, as you would know if you could 
see an unsuccessful charge on works. 

The enemy is reported as moving to our right in heavy 
force. 



288 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

August 5, 1864. 

After the fight of the 28th July, we advanced on the 3Oth, 
3 ist and April ist, when we came to a strong line of Rebel 
rifle pits, densely populated, and their main works about 400 
yards behind the pits. 

On the 2d details from each brigade in the corps were 
ordered to drive the Rebels out of said pits. It was done, our 
division capturing 78 prisoners. The Rebels tried to retake 
them, but failed, of course, leaving with our boys, among other 
dead, a colonel and a major. Only one company (K), of our 
regiment was in the fight ; it had two men wounded. I was on 
picket there the next day; 'twas a lively place, but I lost no 
men. Some of the men fired over 100 rounds. The 23d and 
1 4th Corps have swung around on our right, the object being 
to throw our line across the Macon railroad. We have heard 
that Stoneman was captured with 400 men at Macon. Kil- 
patrick started on a raid yesterday. Stoneman burned a Rebel 
wagon train of 600 wagons, and sabered the mules. Cruel, but 
right. The I4th Corps yesterday gobbled 700 prisoners. 
There are a few Rebel riflemen who keep the bullets whistling 
around us here ; they killed a Company E man 20 yards to the 
right on the 4th. Health of the regiment never better, and 
that is the best index of the morale. 

August 8, 1864. 

Never was army better cared for than this. No part of 
it has been on short rations during the campaign. Extra 
issues of dessicated potatoes, mixed vegetables, etc., have 
bundled the advance guard of General Scurvy neck and 
heels outside the pickets. Extraordinary dreams of green 
corn, blackberries, new potatoes, etc., have done very much 
towards keeping up the health and morale of the army, 
and as much towards reconciling us to this summer sun, 
that ripens said goodies. 

We draw supplies of clothing monthly as regularly as 
when in garrison, and a ragged soldier is a scarcity. At 
least 30 days' rations are safely stored in our rear, making 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 289 

us entirely unmindful of railroad raids, for, if necessary, 
we could build the whole road in that time. The heat has 
not troubled us much, save during a few days' marching. 

We have had hardly three days without a rain for a month. 
We have done a great amount of work since our last battle, 
have constructed nine lines of works, and it will take at 
least two more before we get the position that I think 
Howard wants. We keep those poor Johnnies in a stew 
all the time. Our artillery is any amount better than 
theirs, and it plays on them from morning until night. 
Nothing worries troops so much, though compared with 
musketry it is almost harmless. I guess their ammunition 
is short, for they don't fire one shot to our 40. I think we'll 
like Howard first rate. If he is as good as McPherson, he'll 
do. 

Four divisions are on their way to reenforce us. I don't 
think we need them, but the more, the merrier. 

August 10, 1864. 

Our "color" that has floated over the iO3d for nearly two 
years has become much worn and torn. One shell and 
bullets innumerable have passed through it. It is entitled 
to be inscribed with the following battles: Vicksburg, 
Black River, Jackson, Miss., Mission Ridge, Dalton, Resaca, 
Dallas, New Hope, Big Shanty, Kenesaw Mountain, At- 
lanta. It has been under the enemy's fire 72 days on this 
campaign. Nearly 300 of the regiment have fallen under it. 

August n, 1864. 

We have lost 35 men since Colonel Wright left us. 
There has been a tall artillery fight this p. m. right here, 
but as usual no one hurt. 

August 20, 1864. 

During the last few days cavalry has been operating on 
the right against the enemy's communications. We have 
been making demonstrations, as they call it, or diversions 



290 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

in favor of the cavalries; that is, one, two or three times a 
day we raise a yell along our corps line, and open on the 
enemy with cannon and muskets. This, aside from scaring 
them a little (and it is getting most too old to do even 
that), does but trifling damage, for at the opening yell they 
all "hunt their holes," in army slang, take position in their 
works. Everybody is satisfied the Johnnies here are only 
waiting for dark nights to evacuate. 

August 24, 1864. 

The Johnnies in our front are either tired out or short 
of ammunition or inclination, or else, like the quiet swine, 
"studying devilment." Certain it is, that they shoot but 
little lately. 

Five Rebel batteries which have thrown shell into our 
division line did not on the 2Oth or 21 st fire a shot, on the 
22d but two shots, and in response to a more than usually 
vigorous cannonading on our part yesterday returned not 
more than a dozen shots. These Rebels just opposite are 
a very glum set. Won't say a single word, though the lines 
are at one point at least, not more than 20 yards apart. 
Whenever I have seen the line so close, our men invariably 
get the advantage, and keep the Rebels down. We go on the 
skirmish line every fourth day, but with ordinary care 
there is little danger. 

The 4th, 2Oth and i6th Corps are preparing to start for 
the right. The raids in our rear on the railroad amount 
to nothing. We have at least 60 days' rations accumulated, 
and could rebuild the entire road in that time.

hardly accept the nomination from such a party, but I would

cheerfully live under Copperhead rule if they would give us 
such as Sherman. Sherman believes with Logan, "that if 
we can't subdue these Rebels and the rebellion, the next best 
thing we can do is to all go to hell together." 

We have already thrown our army so far to the right that 
our communications are not safe, but yet we can't quite reach 
the Montgomery or Macon railroads. It is determined to leave 
the 2Oth Corps at Vinings to guard the railroad bridge, and I 
think to move all the rest to the right. The army has just 
moved its length by the right flank. Looks easy and simple 
enough, but it took three days and nights of the hardest work 
of the campaign. The whole line lay in sight, and musket 
range of the enemy, not only our skirmishers, but our main 
line, and half a dozen men could, at any point, by showing 
themselves above the works, have drawn the enemy's fire. A 
gun, a caisson, or a wagon could hardly move without being 
shelled. On the night of the 25th, the 2Oth Corps moved 
back to the river to guard the railroad bridge seven miles from 
Atlanta ; and the 4th moved toward the right. 

Night of the 26th the I5th, i6th and I7th moved back on 
different roads toward the right. The wheels of the artillery 
were muffled and most of them moved off very quietly. One 
gun in our division was not muffled, and its rattling brought on 
a sharp fire, but I only heard of two men being hurt. Our 
regiment was deployed on the line our brigade occupied, and 
remained four hours after everything else had left. At 2:30 
a. m. we were ordered to withdraw very quietly. We had fired 
very little for two hours, and moved out so quietly that, though 
our lines were only 25 yards apart in one place, the Rebels did 
not suspect our exit. We moved back three-quarters of a mile 
and waited an hour, I think, for some i/th Corps skirmishers. 
We could hear the Johnnies popping away at our old position, 
and occasionally they would open quite sharply as though an- 
gry at not receiving their regular replies. When we were fully 
two miles away they threw two shells into our deserted works. 
We did not lose a man, but I give you my word, this covering 
an evacuation is a delicate, dangerous, and far-from-pleasant

duty. There was a Johnnie in the "pit" nearest us that got 
off a good thing the other day. A newsboy came along in 
the ditch, crying, "Heer's your Cincinnati, Louisville and Nash- 
ville papers." Crack ! Crack ! ! went two Rebel guns, and 
a Johnnie holloed "There is your Atlanta "Appeal!" We 
caught up with the brigade just at daylight, it was raining, but 
our* watch, the hard march, the wear and tear of such duty, 
made some sleep a necessity, so we tumbled down in the rank 
smelling weeds, and I was sleeping equal to Rip Van Winkle 
in half a minute. In half an hour we were awakened, took 
breakfast and marched a couple of miles to where the train 
was. Here somebody got Rebel on the brain, and we were run 
out a mile to investigate. We stopped in a nice, fine grove, 
and I didn't want to hear any more about the Rebels, but went 
to sleep instanter. That sleep did me a world of good. I woke 
about 4 p. m., and found the whole regiment with scarce a 
half-dozen exceptions, sound asleep. Finally the rear of the 
train started and we followed. At just midnight we came up 
to the train corral and laid down for the remnant of the night. 
At 6 a. m., we left the train and rejoined the division. At dark 
we camped on the Montgomery and Atlanta railroad, where 
the mile post says 15 miles to Atlanta. The march has been 
through a miserable rough country. 

We have now been more than half-way around Atlanta, 
and I have not yet seen a country house that would more 
than compare favorably with the Coleman Mansion, or a farm 
that would in any respect vie with the stumpiest of Squire 
Shipley's stump quarter, or the most barren and scraggiest of 
Copperas creek barren or brakes. At 12 p. m. they aroused 
our regiment to tear up railroad track. In one and one-quar- 
ter hours we utterly destroyed rails and ties for twice the 
length of our regiment. 

We, by main strength with our hands, turned the track up- 
side down, pried the ties off, stacked them, piled the rails 
across and fired the piles. Used no tools whatever. On the 
29th the 1 6th Corps moved down and destroyed the railroad to 
Fairburn. On the 3Oth the army started for Macon railroad,

Kilpatrick's cavalry in advance. He did splendidly. Had 
hard skirmishing all the day. Took at least a dozen barricades, 
and went about as fast as we wanted to. He saved the Flint 
river bridge, and our corps crossed it, and by 12 p. m., were 
in good position with works within one-half mile of Jones- 
boro and the railroad. 

Darkness kept us from taking the road that night. The 
enemy had a strong line of pickets all around us and we built 
our works under their fire. At daylight the 3ist, we found 
the Rebels in plain sight in front of our regiment. I never saw 
them so thick. Our regiment is on the extreme right of the 
division. 

Near Jonesboro, August 31, 1864. 

We were afraid we would have no battle this month, but 
our fears were disappointed in a very summary manner this 
p. m. Hardee, in command of his own and Hood's old corps, 
attacked the Army of the Tennessee again, the weight of the 
assault being on our corps. The second division, M. L. Smith's, 
had the hardest of the fighting. The position our regiment 
held was unluckily too strong. They did not dare attack us. 
But we had a splendid view of the fight, both on our right and 
left. 

Six Johnnie lines of battle debouched from the woods on 
our left, and swept right across our front on open ground, 
within long musket range, say 600 or 700 yards. This was 
2 130 p. m. They were coming over to attack the i6th Corps. 
A five-gun battery on the right of our regiment and two guns 
on our left opened on them with spherical case, and threw 
some canister. They had hardly fired two shots when a Rebel 
lo-pound Parrott opened on them in front, and a Napoleon 
battery on our left flank. The Rebels shot admirably and you 
may imagine our regiment was in a pretty warm position, 
though our works and traverses made the danger but little. 

In ten minutes from the time we first saw the Rebels they 
struck the i6th Corps, and after a right heavy fight of near 
an hour they came back flying. Our boys, though not near 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 2Q5 

enough to do much effective shooting, put in 40 or 50 rounds 
apiece, just to keep our hands in. About the same time they 
struck Morgan L. they struck our first brigade and the left 
of our brigade. Our division repulsed them easily and Mor- 
gan L. slaughtered them awfully, but he had a hard fight. They 
charged up close to the left of our regiment, but owing to the 
direction of our lines not where we could fight them. Our 
brigade took one colonel, one major, three captains, one lieu- 
tenant and 30 men prisoners. The 2d division took several 
hundred. I can't guess what their loss is, though it is not as 
heavy as on the 22d or 28th of July, for they did not fight 
nearly as well. Besides losing a host of men in this campaign, 
the Rebel Army has lost a large meaure of vim, which counts 
a good deal in soldiering. Our loss in this fight is compara- 
tively nothing. Say 30 men in our brigade; we have four or 
five scratched in our regiment, but only one much hurt. A 
spent 12-pound solid shot rolled on him. 

Kilpatrick started for the railroad south this morning. He 
has had a big fight with Cleyburn's division, but don't know 
much about it. 

During our fight to-day Schofield and Stanley, 23d and 
4th, took the railroad and are destroying it. Hood, with Folk's 
old corps, are above him and cut off from Hardee. 

September ist, '64. 

A real autumn morning. We were aroused at 3 a. m. and 
the air was then almost crisp. A breath of cold air is a luxury 
we can appreciate. A fresh, cool breeze is now stirring and I 
can almost hear the leaves falling. It is a real yellow fall and 
does me more good than aught else could, except a letter from 
home. Haven't had one from you for ten days. A prisoner 
says that yesterday's fight was rougher on them than the 28th 
of July fight. He said their brigade came up in front of our 
men, and though they did not stay more than long enough to 
take one look, when they got back under cover they were 500 
men short. They afterwards charged again, and he said he 
doubted whether any of them got off alive and sound. 



296 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

This is the I24th day of the campaign, exactly 90 of 
which we have been under fire. Have also moved 340 
miles, though the direct road would be much less. The 
boys say we just finished the summer campaign in time to 
commence the fall ditto. I guess the movement surprised 
Hood. Prisoners all say they understood it to be a raiding 
party. 'Tis a rather mighty one. 

The country between these two railroads is rather better 
than any we have seen before in Georgia, but I never saw 
any in Illinois half as poor. Hardly any of the land has been 
under cultivation since the war commenced. A little sickly 
corn and a few patches of sorghum and millet are about 
all the farming evidence I have seen. 

Northern Alabama and a few counties in Mississippi are 
the only passable parts of the Confederacy that I have 
seen. Mrs. Lee Henty's grand plantations, with their "hos- 
pitable mansions, whose broad verandas, supported by 
graceful pillars," etc., are principally "bosh," at least as 
far as northern Georgia is concerned. The health of the 
regiment is excellent, the men being, if anything, healthier 
than the officers. The lieutenant colonel and major, 
though both with us, are not yet reported for duty. Cap- 
tain Boyd, Lieutenants Fox, A. & J. Smith are quite unwell. 

Captains Post, Vorhees, Smith and myself have at dif- 
ferent times been all the officers fit for duty. I believe 
I am the only one who has never been off duty during the 
campaign, though Post, Smith, Vorhees and Dorrance 
have lost but a few days each, Smith, I believe only one. 
I don't believe these Rebels can be in very good spirits. I 
am afraid I'd be a little blue if we'd been whipped as often 
as they have this campaign. Most of the prisoners are 
great "peace" men, but they all say that their leaders will 
never give up as long as they can raise a brigade to fight. 
Every pup of them has hopes that the Chicago Convention 
will do something for them, they hardly know what. I 
heard one of the boys say he wished that the Convention 
could be induced to charge us in these works. There's 
talk of our going home to vote. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 297 

About 2 p. m. a signal officer in a tree reported that he 
could see our troops moving in line down the railroad 
toward us. It was the 23d and 4th Corps. The I4th 
which held the left of our line, about the same time com- 
menced to swing its left around, and by 4 p. m. a battle 
opened. The I4th broke the enemy's line before the 23d 
got up, and alone rolled the Rebels up in fine style. By 
dark the I4th had captured from 12 to 20 pieces of artillery 
and a large number of prisoners. Three hours more of 
daylight and Hardee would have had no corps left, for the 
4th and 23d were swinging further to the left, and would 
have been in his rear in less than two hours, when our 
whole line would have closed in on them. 

Six miles south of Jonesboro, September 2, 1864. 

At daylight our skirmish line moved forward and found 
the Rebels gone. When our boys reached the railroad 
a train of cars was just loading some wounded; the boys 
made for it, but it outran them. They left a number of 
their wounded, and when the I4th broke them on the ist, 
we captured several hospitals, in one of which were several 
officers. I saw in a hole by a hospital two legs and three 
arms. One can't help pitying these Rebel soldiers. They 
have been whipped here until they have lost all spirit. 
They don't fight with any spirit when they are attacked 
and it's more like a butchery than a battle. Our brigade 
in advance we started after them. The looth Indiana and 
6th Iowa were deployed as skirmishers, and met the Rebel 
line almost as soon as they started forward. They drove 
them finely for four miles, when our skirmishers reported 
that they had run the Rebel army into fortifications. 

The country here is quite open, the fields being from 
half to a mile or more wide, bordered by a narrow strip of 
wood. The 46th Ohio and our regiment were now de- 
ployed to relieve the skirmishers, and take a close look at 
the enemy's position. They were shooting at us from 
some rail fences within range, and a mile away, over the 



298 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

fields, we could see them digging; seemed to be construct- 
ing a line of pits. We pushed forward under a heavy 
skirmish fire, and took from a S. C. Brigade the line of pits 
we saw them making, and went on a little way until we 
drew a fire from their main works, when we retired to the 
pits we had taken and prepared to hold them. Found tools 
in them. This was 3 p. m. About dark the Rebels made 
three little sorties, but only in light force. We easily 
repulsed them. Captain Post was wounded in the right 
breast. Loss in the regiment is seven wounded, raising the 
loss in the regiment to 178. The iO3d and 46th Ohio 
captured 19 prisoners and killed and wounded at least 25. 

September 3, 1864. 

Rebels still here. Congratulatory order from Sherman 
commences, "Slocum occupied Atlanta yesterday at n a. 
m." We can see nothing of our position here. I don't 
know where the 23d and I4th are. Our line here is very 
crooked, but generally faces southeast. Commencing at 
our right our line runs i/th, I5th, i6th and 4th. Kilpatrick 
is on our right or in the enemy's rear. Can't hear a word 
of Hood's or Folk's old corps or the militia. Hardee is in 
our front, and they are the only Rebel troops I know 
aught of. Cheatham's Division faces us, and a S. C. Bri- 
gade is opposite our brigade. Captain Wilkinson was 
wounded in the arm to-day. 

September 4, 1864. 

Received a half official notification to-day that the cam- 
paign and fighting are over. Orders to clean up arms came 
also, and the boys, showing their contempt of the enemy's 
power to do harm, took their guns all to pieces and set to 
polishing the should-be bright parts, right in view of the 
enemy's pickets. 

September 5, 1864. 

News of the capture of Fort Morgan. Orders to march 
at 8 p. m. I was detailed to bring off the pickets, which 
was accomplished without trouble. Rebels did not know 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 299 

when we left, as we heard them shooting after we got 
back in our old works at Jonesboro. The whole army 
moved into the works we built the 3Oth. I, with my 
pickets, got back just before day. 

September 6, 1864. 

Lay quiet all day. Some Rebel cavalry followed us up 
and fired a few shots into our regiment's works from the old 
Rebel fort, but Osterhaus swung his pickets around and 
gobbled 25 of them, and the rest troubled us no more. 

September 7, 1864. 

At 7 a. m. moved out on our return, and camped for the 
night on the left bank of Flint river, six miles south of East- 
point. The Rebels had fortified to this place, and I don't know 
how much farther south. As soon as Hood found out that 
Sherman was attempting to turn his left, he commenced ex- 
tending his lines down the railroad. He had built six miles of 
new works when we reached Jonesboro the night of the 3Oth 
of August. His line was too long for his troops, so he sent two 
corps to oppose us, and the 23d and 4th moved into the vacant 
space in his line right over his works. 

Near Eastpoint, September 8, 1864. 

We are again in camp for a rest ; don't know for how long. 
What do you think now of the confidence I have so often ex- 
pressed to you in Sherman and his army? I have every hour 
of the campaign felt that a failure in it was impossible. 

The following complimentary orders were issued, as dated 
immediately after our going into camp at Eastpoint: 

HEADQUARTERS DEP'T. AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, 

Eastpoint, Ga., September 9, 1864. 
GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, 

No. 16 

It is with pride, gratification, and a sense of Divine favor 
that I congratulate this noble army upon the successful termi- 
nation of the campaign. 

Your officers claim for you a wonderful record for exam- 
ple, a march of four hundred (400) miles, thirteen (13) dis-

tinct engagements, four thousand (4,000) prisoners, and 
twenty (20) stands of colors captured, and three thousand 
(3,000) of the enemy's dead buried in your front. 

Your movements upon the enemy's flank have been bold and 
successful; first upon Resaca, second upon Dallas, third upon 
Kenesaw, fourth upon Nickajack, fifth via Rosewell, upon the 
Augusta railroad, sixth upon "Ezra Church" to the south- 
west of Atlanta, and seventh upon Jonesboro and the Macon 
railroad. Atlanta was evacuated while you were fighting at 
Jonesboro. The country may never know with what patience, 
labor and exposure, you have tugged away at every natural 
and artificial obstacle that an enterprising and confident enemy 
could interpose. 

The terrific battles you have fought may never be realized 
or credited, still a glad acclaim is already greeting you from 
the government and people, in view of the results you have 
helped to gain, and I believe a sense of the magnitude of the 
achievements of the last hundred days will not abate but in- 
crease with time and history. 

Our rejoicing is tempered, as it always must be, by the sol- 
dier's sorrow at the loss of his companions-in-arms. On every 
hillside, in every valley throughout your long and circuitous 
route, from Dalton to Jonesboro, you have buried them. 

Your trusted and beloved commander fell in your midst ; his 
name, the name of MCPHERSON, carries with it a peculiar feel- 
ing of sorrow. I trust the impress of his character is upon 
you all to incite you to generous actions and noble deeds. 

To mourning friends, and to all the disabled in battle, you 
extend a soldier's sympathy. 

My first intimate acquaintance with you dates from the 28th 
of July. I never beheld fiercer assaults than the enemy then 
made, and I never saw troops more steady and self-possessed 
in action than your divisions which were then engaged. 

I have learned that for cheerfulness, obedience, rapidity of 
movement, and confidence in battle, the Army of the Tennes- 
see is not to be surpassed, and it shall be my study that your 
fair record shall continue, and my purpose to assist you to 
move steadily forward and float the old Flag in every proud 
city of the rebellion.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, 

EASTPOINT, GA., September n, 1864. 

Officers and Soldiers of the Fifteenth Army Corps: 

You have borne your part in the accomplishment of the 
object of this campaign, a part well and faithfully done. 

On the ist day of May, 1864, from Huntsville, Ala., and its 
vicinity, you commenced the march. The marches and labors 
performed by you during this campaign will hardly find a 
parallel in the history of war. The proud name heretofore 
acquired by the I5th Corps for soldierly bearing and daring 
deeds remains untarnished its lustre undimmed. During the 
campaign you constituted the main portion of the flanking 
column of the whole army. Your first move against the enemy 
was around the right of the army at Resaca, where, by your 
gallantry, the enemy were driven from the hills and his works 
on the main road from Vilanaw to Resaca. On the retreat of 
the enemy, you moved on the right flank of the army by a 
circuitous route to Adairsville, in the same manner from there 
to Kingston and Dallas, where, on the 28th day of May, you 
met the veteran corps of HARDEE, and in a severe and bloody 
contest you hurled him back, killing and wounding over two 
thousand, besides capturing a large number of prisoners. You 
then moved around to the left of the army, by way of Acworth, 
to Kenesaw Mountain, where again you met the enemy, driv- 
ing him from three lines of works, capturing over three hun- 
dred prisoners. During your stay in front of Kenesaw Moun- 
tain, on the 2/th of June, you made one of the most daring, 
bold and heroic charges of the war, against the almost impreg- 
nable position of the enemy on Little Kenesaw. You were then 
moved, by way of Marietta, to Nickajack Creek, on the right 
of the army, thence back to the extreme left by way of Mari- 
etta and Roswell, to the Augusta railroad, near Stone Moun- 
tain, a distance of fifty miles, and after effectually destroying 
the railroad at this point, you moved by way of Decatur to the 
immediate front of the Rebel stronghold, Atlanta. Here, on 
the 22d day of July, you again performed your duty nobly, "as 
patriots and soldiers" in one of the most severe and sanguinary 
conflicts of the campaign. With hardly time to recover your 
almost exhausted energies, you were moved again around to 
the right of the army, only to encounter the same troops against 
whom you had so recently contended, and the battle of the 
28th of July, at Ezra Chapel, will long be remembered by the 
officers and soldiers of this command. On that day it was that 
the 1 5th Corps almost unaided and alone, for four hours con- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

tested the field against the Corps of HARDEE and LEE.. You 
drove them discomfited from the field causing them to leave 
their dead and many of their wounded in your hands. The 
many noble and gallant deeds performed by you on that day 
will be remembered among the proudest acts of our nation's 
history. After pressing the enemy closely for several days, 
you again moved to the right of the army, to the West Point 
railroad, near Fairburn after completely destroying the road 
for some distance, you marched to Jonesboro, driving the 
enemy before you from Pond creek, a distance of ten miles. 
At this point you again met the enemy, composed of LEE'S 
.and HARDEE' s Corps, on the 3ist of August, and punished 
them severely, driving them in confusion from the field, with 
their dead and many wounded and prisoners left in your hands. 
Here again by your skill and true courage you kept sacred the 
reputation you have so long maintained, viz.: "The I5th 
Corps never meets the enemy but to strike and defeat him." 
On the ist of September, the I4th Corps attacked HARDEE, 
you at once opened fire on him, and by your co-operation his 
defeat became a rout. HOOD, hearing the news, blew up his 
ammunition trains, retreated, and Atlanta was ours. 

You have marched during the campaign, in your windings, 
the distance of four hundred miles, have put "hors-du-combat" 
more of the enemy than your corps numbers, have captured 
twelve stands of colors, 2,450 prisoners and 210 deserters. 

The course of your march is marked by the graves of patri- 
otic heroes who have fallen by your side ; but at the same time 
it is more plainly marked by the blood of traitors who have 
defied the constitution and laws, insulted and trampled under 
foot the glorious flag of our country. 

We deeply sympathize with the friends of those of our com- 
rades-in-arms who have fallen ; our sorrows are only appeased 
by the knowledge that they fell as brave men, battling for the 
preservation and perpetuation of one of the best governments 
of earth. "Peace be to their ashes." 

You now rest for a short time from your labors ; during the 
respite prepare for future action. Let your country see at all 
times by your conduct that you love the cause you have es- 
poused; that you have no sympathy with any who would by 
word or deed assist vile traitors in dismembering our mighty 
Republic or trailing in the dust the emblem of our national 
greatness and glory. You are the defenders of a government 
that has blessed you heretofore with peace, happiness and pros- 
perity. Its perpetuity depends upon your heroism, faithfulness 
.and devotion. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 303 

When the time shall come to go forward again, let us go 
with the determination to save our nation from threatened 
wreck and hopeless ruin, not forgetting the appeal from 
widows and orphans that is borne to us upon every breeze to 
avenge the loss of their loved ones who have fallen in de- 
fense of their country. Be patient, obedient and earnest, and 
the day is not far distant when you can return to your homes 
with the proud consolation that you have assisted in causing 
the old banner to again wave from every mountain's top and 
over every town and hamlet of our once happy land, and hear 
the shouts of triumph ascend from a grateful people, proclaim- 
ing that once more we have one flag and one country. 

JOHN A. LOGAN, 

Major General Commanding. 

HEADQUARTERS 4TH DIVISION, 15x11 A. C. 

EASTPOINT, GA V September 13, 1864. 

Officers and Soldiers: 

The commander-in-chief, the department commander, and 
corps officer have each expressed to you their approbation of 
your conduct during the campaign just closed. They have 
spoken in general terms to the army, the department and corps. 

It is my privilege to address your immediate organization. 
Your department commander announces the capture of four 
thousand (4,000) prisoners by the Army of the Tennessee. 
You have taken one-third of that number. This army has 
taken from the enemy twenty (20) battleflags; eight of these 
were wrested from him by your prowess. 

Your lists of killed and wounded in battle are larger by 
one-half than any other division in the Army of the Tennessee. 

You have destroyed as many of the enemy as any similar 
organization in the entire army. 

You have never been defeated in this or any other campaign. 

Your record is therefore spotless, and you should be and 
doubtless are proud of it. Your friends at home and the corn- 
try at large will some day understand and appreciate your 
conduct. 

Had your lamented department commander been spared, his 
familiarity with your history, and identification with your- 
selves, would have commanded for you more complete justice. 
Your corps commander is not now, nor has he ever been, slow 
to acknowledge your merits, but he is powerless to do more. 



304 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Your organization will probably soon be changed, and the 
stranger to you will reap the reward of your devotion and self- 
sacrifice. The just reward, always so highly prized by the 
true soldier, may not be yours, but the consciousness of duty 
well performed will remain with you forever. You will sus- 
tain your high reputation by doing battle, as heretofore, for 
your country, and not for men. Do so cheerfully. My con- 
nection with you as your division commander may possibly 
soon be severed. Support any future officer as you have sup- 
ported me, and success must attend your efforts. I ask from 
you the same kind of remembrance I shall ever give to each 
true soldier of this command.

Brigadier General U. S. Vols, 

EXPLANATORY NOTE. 

[The Army of the Tennessee remained at, or near, East 
Point, until October 4th. When General Sherman decided 
to destroy Atlanta, he gave the inhabitants their choice as 
to where they would go, either north, south, or remain, 
and take their chances in the ruined city. Prisoners 
captured during the campaign were also exchanged, 
and a detail of some 70 or 80 men from the regiment, 
commanded by Captain Wills, and a like command 
from the looth Indiana, was given the duty of guard- 
ing the "neutral ground" at a place called Rough and 
Ready, some eight or ten miles south of Atlanta. This 
duty being performed, the detail rejoined the regiment, 
having been so occupied about ten days. The 4th Division 
was here broken up, and the "old 2d Brigade" was trans- 
ferred to the 1st Division, commanded by Gen. C. R. 
Wood.] 

The diary is now resumed. 

October 4, 1864. 

We have been expecting to move for several days. The 
Rebels have crossed the Chattanooga and are moving on 
our rear, a la Jonesboro. If half the force they took over 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 305 

get back I'll be much disappointed. We yesterday sent 
our extra baggage to Atlanta to store, and at n last night 
orders came to march at 5 a. m. to-day. We will be off 
in a few minutes now. Marietta is in our route direction. 

Six miles south of Marietta, October 5, 1864. 

Had an awful day's march yesterday, full 20 miles and 
the road very muddy and slippery. County peculiarly 
Georgian, the like of which, I hope, is to be found nowhere 
else in Uncle Sam's domain. When we started the "spring 
or grapevine" dispatch said that Hardee's headquarters 
were in Marietta, and that he was living very high on 
sanitary stores, of which there is enough to feed an army 
for a time. We crossed the river on pontoons near the 
railroad bridge, a very fine work, considering it was built 
inside of a week. 

We then heard that Marietta was not in Hardee's posses- 
sion, but that lively skirmishing was going on along the 
lines, and that Hardee's army was before the place. About 
three miles from the river we met a wagon train just from 
Marietta ; part of the guards had not heard that any Rebels 
were near the town. Others said that Hood's army was 
just the other side of Kenesaw, about two miles north of 
Marietta. Finally a cavalry man said part of our (guard's) 
cavalry occupied Kenesaw, from the top of which he had 
seen the Rebel army occupying an old line of works of 
ours just this side of Big Shanty. I just thought I would 
give you a sample of the "grape cuttings" that accompany 
a march. A body of Rebels is evidently above Marietta, 
on the railroad ; how strong I don't know, and it is none of 
my business. "Pap" knows all about it. He never tells 
us anything. He has not issued a "battle order" during the 
whole campaign and hardly a congratulatory. If the 
Rebels are there in force, there will be a battle. It can 
have but one result, and cannot fail to be a disastrous one 
for them. We have at least 50 days' full rations and I 
think 90, so the breaking of the railroad cannot affect us. 
Six p. m. We took all kinds of roundabout roads to-day, 



306 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

and marched eight miles to make not over four. I have 
been really sick all day, but hope it will be over by morning. 
The Johnnies have left Big Shanty, moving north on the 
railroad, tearing it up as they travel. Go it, Rebels ! 

October 6, 1864, 12 m. 

Rained all last night, and has just suspended for a few 
minutes, I expect. Kept dry, thanks to our rubber blan- 
kets. Drew five days' rations this morning, full of every- 
thing except beans ; plenty of beef, though. We only drew 
one-quarter of a pound per man for the whole five days. 
Part of our railroad bridge across the Chattahoochie 
washed away a few days ago. It will be finished again to- 
day. There was some fighting up near Allatoona Pass yes- 
terday, in which, rumor says, our folks were worsted. The 
Rebels are moving up the road in that direction. They 
will have to leave there or wait and fight us. I hear that Kil- 
patrick burned 200 or 300 of their wagons yesterday. We'll 
warm those fellows if they will only wait for us somewhere. 
We are under orders to start at a moment's notice. Mud 
is not over a foot deep and everything else is lovely in 
proportion. I was confoundedly sick all day yesterday, 
could not eat any supper, but about 9 p. m. the boys 
brought some beans about half cooked, and the notion 
taking me I ate a couple of quarts thereof. Have felt splen- 
didly ever since. Our pickets that we left at Eastpoint 
have just got in. The division field officer of the day 
who had charge of them misunderstood his instructions 
and marched to the river at Sandtown, 15 miles below 
where we crossed. The Rebels fired into them and I 
suppose captured half a dozen stragglers. 

October 7, 1864. 

The Rebels have left the railroad after being whipped 
by General Corse at Allatoona Pass. The I4th Corps 
drove them out to Lost Mountain yesterday. No hard 
fighting. They tore up not more than eight miles of rail- 
road, which will be rebuilt in a very few days. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 307 

Deserters report the whole Rebel Army here, but that the 
ten days' rations they started with have run out. Other de- 
serters say that their army has started for Nashville, Hunts- 
ville, or hell ; that they are satisfied they can't make either of 
the first named places, and would rather go to Sherman than 
the last named. It is wonderful what confidence this army has 
in Sherman. Every man seems to think the idea of these 
Rebels being able to do us any permanent harm is perfectly 
preposterous, and all are in the best of spirits. I can't help 
thinking that the Rebels must have all cleared out of this 
vicinity, or else we'd be going for them. Our stock is in too 
bad condition to follow them far over the, at present, horrible 
roads. A man rode along on a poor old bone-rack of a horse 
a while ago. Some wag commenced, "caw," "caw," "caw." 
The whole camp took it up and for five minutes you would have 
thought that 10,000 crows were holding a jubilee. Let some 
one start a squirrel or rabbit and 500 men will be after it in 
a minute. Old soldiers are just a lot of men with school-boy 
spirits. 

Officers don't draw meat like the men. I have just had 
two meals of beef (and no other meat) in the last ten days. 
All our officers are the same way. It is mostly our own fault. 

On picket four miles south of Marietta, October 8th. 
We occupy the old Johnny skirmish pits. It was outrage- 
ously cold last night. I elected myself fireman and did not 
neglect my duties. I have men from every regiment in the 
brigade (seven). There are an abundance of chestnuts here, 
and at every post the boys have worked pretty steadily all day 
roasting and eating. All sit on their knapsacks before the fire, 
every fellow with a stick to take out the nuts. It is right in- 
teresting to hear the men talk. Nearly all have been in the 
service three years or over, and almost every battlefield in the 
West has been seen by some of the brigade. We move. The 
Rebels have crossed the Etawah.

308 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Two miles north of Kenesaw Mountain, 

October 9, 1864. 

About 5 o'clock last night, just when we should have been 
relieved, we heard the "General" sounded through the camp, 
and in half an hour more the "Assembly." The corps started 
toward Marietta, and in another half hour we assembled, and 
in charge of the division officer of the day followed as rear 
guard of the train. 

At 12 p. m., after a cold, tiresome march, the train corraled, 
and we built fires and turned in beside them for the balance 
of the night, right at the northeast base of Kenesaw Mountain. 
This a. m. found the brigade two miles further north. The 
Rebel Army was here three days ago and tore up the railroad 
all along here. They are now near Van Wirt. If they go 
north across the Etawah, we will probably follow. Their pres- 
ent position menances the whole line of road from Rome to 
the Chattahoochie crossing. 

Near Kenesaw Mountain, October 10, 1864. 

Was on the ground we charged on the 27th of June, and 
also on top of Kenesaw to-day. Very fine view, but nothing 
like equal to that from Lookout. The signal station here com- 
municates direct with Atlanta, Allatoona and Roswell. 

I picked up some black oak acorns to-day from a tree that 
shades the graves of 12 or 15 of our soldiers, mostly from our 
regiment, who fell on the 27th. They were buried where they 
fell. That charge was the maddest folly of the campaign. 

Allatoona Pass, October n, 1864. 

Our corps moved at the setting of the sun, and continued 
moving until we were all confoundedly tired. I never saw the 
men so noisy, funny, or in any way or every way feeling half 
so good. After we had marched about eight miles, one of 
Howard's staff came back along the line and informed us that 
Sherman had just notified Howard that Richmond is ours. 
Everybody believed it, but nobody cheered. They were saving 
the yells for the confirmation. We camped at I a. m. with or- 
ders for reveille at 4 and march at 5 a. m. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 309 

Three miles south of Kingston, October 12, 1864. 

Started at daylight this morning. The Rebels were then 
at Rome. Stopped here at 5 p. m. It is understood that the 
Rebel Army has moved southwest into Alabama. 

Passed through the best country to-day that we have seen 
in Georgia. We are camped on what has been a splendid 
plantation (equal to anything on Copperas creek), and on the 
only clover field, I think, in Georgia. This is about the only 
ground on which I have seen the Jamestown weed, plantain, 
or clover. We are very scare of forage, and the officers turned 
their horses out on the clover to graze. The Northern stock 
enjoyed it exceedingly, but the Southern horses did not know 
enough to eat it. They nosed around among the rich bundles 
of clover to pick out the weeds and hard wild grass, the latter 
not near as good as our poorest prairie grass. 

Three miles from Rome, Ga., October 13, 1864. 
Started at 8 this morning and landed here at dark. Heard 
40 or 50 cannon shots in vicinity of Rome during the day's 
march. The country to-day is fair for Georgia, but not equal 
to that between Cartersville and Kingston. While we were rest- 
ing to-day, Osterhaus (at present commanding our corps) rode 
by our regiment and a few scamps hollowed "sowbelly, sow- 
belly. ' You know the men have been living on army beef for 
a month, and it is not desirable fare; still they were only in 
fun, and I noticed the general smile, but some puppy finally 
cried out "kraut," and another echoed it with "kraut by the 
barrel." The general wheeled his horse and rode up to us, his 
face white with passion. "Vat regiment ish dis?" No one an- 
swered. He rode up near me and again asked, "Vat regiment 
ish dis?" I told him. "Vy don't you kit up?" I arose and 
again answered him respectfully, "The iO3d Illinois, sir." 
"Vare ish your colonel?" "At the right of the regiment, sir." 
He rode up to Wright and gave him the devil. I have not been 
so mortified for a long time. We all think a great deal of 
Osterhaus, and just coming into his division were all desirous 
that his first impressions of our regiment should be favorable. 



3IO ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

As it is, two or three insulting puppies have given us a name 
with him that I have no doubt will cause us trouble for a long 
time. Yelping "sauer kraut" at a German is a poor way to 
gain his favor. 

(A duplicate of dates.) October 12, 1864. 
Last night while our train was passing through Cass- 
ville, a town four miles south of Kingston, an ambulance 
gave out and the driver unhitched and concluded to stay 
all night. That was some three miles from where we 
stayed. Nine stragglers also laid down beside the ambu- 
lance for the night. The I7th Corps came through there 
to-day and found the driver dead, with a bayonet thrust 
through him, and the traps of the nine men laying around. 
The horses and nine men are missing. I heard to-night 
that the bodies of the nine men had been found altogether. 
Our men burned the town. I expect we will lie here to- 
morrow, and if Hood's army is in this vicinity go for it 
next day. Nobody thinks he will dare to fight us. We 
have parts of five corps here. 

(Duplicated also.) October 13, 1864. 

The men drew full rations of bacon to-day. There has 
been some fighting nine miles down the north side of the 
Coosa river to-day. Our corps moves back on the Kings- 
ton road at "retreat." Don't know where to. 

Received two letters from you to-day, also papers, for 
which am very thankful. Have had a good rest to-day. 
Everybody is in glorious spirits. Kilpatrick started west to- 
day with 50 days' rations of salt. I wish I was with him. 

Three miles southwest of Adairsville, October I4th. 
We marched at sunset last evening and halted not until 
3 this a. m. Marched miserably slow the first five miles 
through a deep gorge, but about I o'clock got straightened 
out on the Rome and Calhoun road, a good one, and then 
got along nicely. In the fighting at Rome yesterday, our 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 31! 

folks whipped them and took some artillery. We got to 
bed at 3:15, and reveille sounded at 5 and we marched at 
6:30. Not much sleep after marching 20 miles, was it. 
We had no crackers this morning, and before I got up my 
imagination was reveling in the prospect of a breakfast on 
parched corn, but at the festive board the cook surprised 
us with a mess of pancakes. They looked like plates cut 
out of a rubber blanket, and tasted accordingly. One mem- 
ber of the mess said they just came up to his ideal of a 
poet's dream. Another, that they only lacked one thing, 
and that was the stamp, "Goodyear's Patent." The Sur- 
geon advised us to use them sparingly, for, said he, "If 
they mass against any part of your interior lines the con- 
sequences will be dire." But we were hard up for bread- 
stuffs, and closed with the dreadful stuff manfully. Twelve 
m. Have stopped for dinner. 

The Rebel army was, or part of it, at Resaca yesterday, 
about nine miles from here. 

Calhoun, Ga., October 15, 1864. 

Stayed here last night. Reveille at 3 a. m., but our bri- 
gade brings up the rear of the corps to-day, and we won't 
get off until after daylight. 

Resaca, October 15, 1864, 10 a. m. 

We are waiting here for rations. The 4th and I4th 
Corps are ahead, and for the last half hour we have heard 
very heavy skirmishing toward "Snake Creek Gap," just 
about where we heard the first fighting of the campaign, 
a little over five months ago. There is enough to interest 
me in the prospect for the next three days. Snake Creek 
Gap, 10 p. m. We have the whole gap. 

North end Snake Creek Gap, October 16, 1864. 
After a tedious march got here at n p. m. The Rebels 
about six hours ahead of us had blockaded the road in 
good style. They did some half a day's work, with hun- 
dreds of men, and delayed us about ten minutes. 



312 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

On summit of Taylor's Ridge, Shipp's Gap, p. m. 
Our division has the advance to-day. The Rebels drove 
very well, until we got here,- when, having a very good 
position, they resisted us with some vim. A few men of 
the 1st brigade, finally climbed the hill, flanked and routed 
them. Our loss, seven wounded. We got 35 prisoners and 
killed and wounded a dozen or so. 

October 17, 1864. 

I incline to think that the raid and pursuit are both over, 
though we wish that Sherman would follow them until they 
get the punishment they deserve for their impudence. They 
tore up some 20 miles of railroad, killed and wounded not 
over 750 for us, and captured about 1,100. Their loss in 
wounded and killed, whom we have buried, is 1,900; pris- 
oners, that I know of, 600; besides a lot of deserters who 
have come in. Eight hundred of the prisoners captured 
by them were negroes, who could not have been taken 
but for the cowardice of their Colonel, Johnson. 

The tearing up of the railroad amounts to nothing. We 
have not had our rations cut down an ounce in anything. 

The man that run that raid ought to be ashamed of him- 
self, and I'll venture he is. 

In Snake Creek Gap, but for General Stanley's laziness, 
we would have got enough prisoners to make Hood howl. 
He rested his corps three hours, just as he did when en- 
trusted with a critical piece of work at Jonesboro. 

We have been having a gay time this morning. It is 
cold enough to make us sit close to the fire, and the ne- 
groes keep us in chestnuts. 

La Fayette, October 18, 1864. 

Our brigade was marching through Cane Creek Valley yes- 
terday until 4 p. m., when we struck out for this place five 
miles, which we made in one and one-half hours. Nice little 
town almost surrounded with half-mountains. There has been 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 313 

a pair of cavalry fights here, the fruits whereof can be seen in 
an addition to the cemetery, near which we are bivouacked, 
some 25 Rebel graves, and half as many Yankees. Divers fair 
creatures can be seen here, chiefly Rebels ; I have thought 
though, to-day, much Union. We are now bound for Rome. 

Near Summerville, October 19, 1864. 

Reached this place yesterday. The cavalry advance had 
some sharp skirmishing, and brought back some two or three 
prisoners. We are drawing full rations, besides preying off 
the country, all kinds of meat, apples, potatoes, and I believe 
the men find a little of everything known to be eatable. En- 
tering houses is prohibited under penalty of death, but some 
scoundrels manage to pillage many houses. Foraging is also 
half prohibited, but I am satisfied that our general officers do 
not object to our taking meat, etc., if houses are not entered. 
Ten p. m. Have stopped here to draw rations. The 23d 
and 4th Corps have already moved forward on the old Ala- 
bama road. That looks as though we were intending to follow 
the Rebels. We "liners" have no idea where they are. One 
rumor is that they are moving northwest, intending to cross 
the Tennessee river, south or southwest of Huntsville. An- 
other that they are moving to their new base at or near Blue 
Mountain, on the road from here to Talladega, Ala. If we are 
going to follow them, I look for a long campaign. But for 
one thing, we would rather go into a campaign immediately 
than into camp. That is, the men have not been paid off for 
ten months, and many families are undoubtedly suffering in 
consequence. Our money is waiting for us, and we will get 
it whenever the Johnnies will let us stop long enough for the 
paymasters to catch up. Don't you people ever think of 
us as being without rations. We sometimes wish the Rebels 
would cut our communications entirely, so that we could live 
wholly off the country. The Rebels only take corn and meat, 
and we fatten on what they are not allowed to touch. 



314 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Alpine, Chatuga Valley, October 20, 1864. 

Got here at dark last night, eight miles from Summerville. 
We seemed to be headed southwest. I have the sorest feet I 
have enjoyed for two years. Do you notice how accurately I 
miss it in every prediction I venture? I am a fair sample of 
the ignorance "Pap" keeps this army of his movements. He 
has shown his ability to keep us from divining his purposes, 
but he or any other general cannot keep us from guessing. 
Fine country here, for Georgia. An officer and 20 men are de- 
tailed daily for foragers. 

They start ahead in the morning, and shoot hogs, sheep, 
gather sweet potatoes, apples, etc., and bring all out to the 
roadside. The hogs and sheep are cut into pieces of about 
20 or 25 pounds. When the regiment comes along every man 
makes a grab as he passes at the pile, throws his chunk over 
his shoulder, and all without breaking ranks. You can im- 
agine the appearance a battalion would make at nightfall. 

Gaylesville, Ala., October 21, 1864. 

Marched about 18 miles yesterday down a very fine valley, 
between Lookout Mountain and Taylor's Ridge, crossed the 
latter after dark through a pass that beat all for blackness and 
stones, to tumble over, that I ever saw. Got a very large 
mail yesterday, but only one letter from you. We move again 
this morning, but don't know when. Can send a letter back 
from here, first chance we have had this month. I guess we 
have halted here to wait the building of a bridge over the 
Coosa. The Rebels burned it yesterday. 

What we are going for nobody knows. I saw Sherman 
yesterday as we passed through Gaylesville. He was talking 
with Jeff. C. Davis. He always has a cigar hanging from the 
corner of his mouth. It is always about half-gone, but I never 
saw it lighted. He is certainly the most peculiar-looking man 
I ever saw. At one house we passed this morning we saw 
three of the ugliest-looking women imaginable. They sat on 
the porch step, side by side, hoopless, unkempt and unwashed. 
I'll swear that man never before witnessed three such frights 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 315 

together. All three were singing a Rebel song. I knew they 
were trying to sing, but although close to them, could not 
distinguish a word. Some of the men recognized the tune 
as belonging to a tune called the "Rebel Soldier." The men 
were so completely surprised and thunderstruck by the show 
that they had not a word to say. It tickles us to see that 
you home folks are uneasy about us because Hood has got 
into our rear. I tell you that I have not seen a man uneasy 
for a minute, on that subject, and that Hood has to run like 
a hound to get away from us. If Hood's army was to-day, 
twice as strong as it is, we would be too many for him. 

October 22, 1864. 

I was foraging to-day for the regiment with about 20 men. 
Got plenty of hogs and potatoes. Sweet potatoes are about 
the size of ordinary pumpkins and most delicious. 

October 23, 1864. 

A day of rest and washing. The cavalry was out some dozen 
miles southwest, and report the enemy intrenched and in force. 

Eight miles southeast of last night's camp, 

October 24, 1864. 

With five brigades of our corps started at 3 130 p. m. to look 
after Rebels reported. Came through a little hamlet called 
Blue Pond from a little lake in the neighborhood of a dirty 
mud color. Plenty of milk and honey. 

Nine miles northwest of Gadsden, Ala., 

October 25, 1864. 

Found the Rebels about noon to-day in position behind a 
rail work, running across from Lookout Mountain to Coosa 
river. It was only Wheeler's cavalry, and we blew them out 
easily. We formed to charge them, but they wouldn't wait. 
We followed until we were satisfied there was no infantry be- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

hind them, and then settled for the night, and sent out foragers. 
There was some miserable artillery firing by both sides. Not 
a dozen men were hurt; only one in our brigade, looth Indi- 
ana. 

At Little River again, October 26, 1864. 
Got back on the 25th, and have been laying quiet. Our 
foragers have been skirmishing a good deal with the enemies' 
scouts, but few casualties however. 

Cedar Bluff, Ala., October 27, 1864. 

Waiting here for the i/th Army Corps to get across the 
Coosa. It is a beautiful little river, not as wide as the Illinois, 
but has a deeper channel. We are starting on the road to 
Talladega; don't even know whether we are starting on a 
campaign or not. Hood is reported across the Tennessee. We 
understand that Sherman has men enough to attend to him, and 
that Sherman intends to use us to Christianize this country. 
Many think we are now on the way to Montgomery or Selma. 
River here about 120 yards wide. About a thousand head of 
our cattle swam across, some of them swam over and back two 
or three times, and many of the thin ones drowned, for which 
we were grateful to the drovers as it saved us some very hard 
chewing. 

Camp in piney woods, five miles South of Cedar Bluffs, 

October 29, 1864. 

Such a march over pine ridges and through swamps ; 
Egyptian darkness would take a back seat in comparison with 
this night. It just happened to strike the men as funny, and 
they kept up a roar of cheering the whole distance. 

Near Cave Springs, Ga., 26 miles south of Rome, 

October 31, 1864, i a. m. 

We think we are going to Rome. Had an extremely dis- 
agreeable march yesterday of only 12 miles, over pine and 
scrub oak ridges. A swamp in every valley. Camped before 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 317 

dark for almost the first time of the trip. This is the 27th 
day since we broke camp at Eastpoint. Everybody is all right. 
Compliments to Colonel Wright, if he is at home, and tell 
him immense rumors are afloat of a Montgomery campaign. 
Had an immense supper of fresh pork and sweet potatoes. 

Cedar Town, Ga., November I, 1864. 

Abomination of abominations, train guard to-day. It is the 
most disagreeable duty we are subject to on the march. I 
escaped the afternoon duty by being sent out foraging. Got 
all the men would carry, and disgusted a rich citizen consid- 
erably, also saw a nice, rosy-faced girl, whose teeth and fiinger- 
nails would spoil a meal for any one of ordinary constitution. 
One man in our brigade wounded, 4Oth Illinois, in a little 
skirmish to-day. 

Van Wirt, Ga., November 2, 1864. 

It has rained steadily all day. Moved 12 miles. I have an 
excellent pair of shoes. A good deal of water got into them 
to-day, but it all ran out. Camp to-night on a high pine ridge. 
Pine knot fires come in first rate. That 4Oth boy that was 
wounded last night was captured with three more of our men 
by 30 Rebels and taken eight or ten miles, then formed in line 
and ordered to about face and fired upon ; two fell dead and the 
other two ran away. 

Five miles northwest of Villa Rica, Ga., 

Novembebr 3, 1864, 6 p. m. 

Forty-eight hours' rain without a stop and a good prospect 
for as much more. We left Van Wirt and Dallas to the left, 
and by 1 6 miles hard marching have got near enough over 
this barren ridge, I think, to find a few marks of civilization. 
Rumor says we are going to Atlanta to relieve the 2Oth Corps, 
and will then be paid. Passed to-day a one-horse wagon, a 
large ox in the shafts and four women in the wagon dressed 
for a party. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Powder Springs, November 4, 1864, 6 p. m. 
Cold rain to-day. Made 15 miles. Country only fit for (?) 
Come through a long line of fine works the Rebels put up 
after they took up our railroad at Acworth. This about the 
last day of pork and potatoes; to-morrow will bring us to a 
country we have worn out. 

Vinings Station, November 5, 1864. 

Our brigade rear guard all day. Foragers could not find a 
thing. Traveled through a perfect labyrinth of breastworks. 
Rebel or Yankee grave every 100 yards. One month ago 
we passed here confident of overtaking Hood, but he was too 
.swift for us, and after 300 miles travel we are back at the 
starting point. Altogether it has been the most pleasant cam- 
paign of my soldiering. The officers of the regiment have all 
messed together, and we have had all the good living and fun 
we wanted. I was under the civilizing influence of a white 
woman's society to-day for five minutes, and in consequence 
feel duly amiable. 

November 6, 1864. 

Rain all day. We are preparing for a huge campaign, and 
are all right glad of it; 50 days' rations is the word. Don't 
know when we start. Montgomery or Augusta are probably 
the points. We are going to shake up the bones of the re- 
bellion. I would not miss this campaign for anything. 

November 12, 1864. 

The Rubicon is passed, the die is cast, and all that sort of 
thing. We to-day severed our own cracker line. At n a. m. 
ours and the i/th Corps were let loose on the railroad, the 
men worked with a will and before dark the 12 miles of track 
between here and Marietta were destroyed. The ties were 
piled and burned and the rails, after being heated red hot in 
the middle were looped around trees or telegraph poles. Old 
destruction himself could not have done the work better. The 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 319 

way the Rebels destroyed our road on their raid was net even 
a fair parody on our style. The 2Oth Corps is at it between 
Atlanta and the river, and the I4th and 23d north of Marietta. 
We have orders to-night to move at 7 a. m. 

White Hall, two miles west of Atlanta, 

November 13, 1864. 

We made 15 miles to-day very easily. Coming through 
Atlanta the smoke almost blinded us. I believe everything of 
any importance there is on fire. Understand that all the large 
buildings are to be burned. Tremendous smoke also rising 
over the site of Marietta. It is said that we will lie here two 
or three days. We are only one-half mile from where we did 
our hard fighting "before Atlanta." 

November 14, 1864. 

Troops are coming in to-day on all the roads. 'Tis said 
that we will be ready to move to-morrow. So be it. The 
cracker line is cut now and we don't want to lie still eating 
up our precious rations. I was again over the old position we 
occupied before Atlanta. I would like to be your guide over 
that ground some day. Tremendous fires in Atlanta to-day. 

Near Jonesboro, November 15, 1864. 

The grand expeditionary force has commenced moving. Our 
regiment has the honor of leading our corps in the first day's 
march. Made about 18 miles to-day, the first ten of which 
the two or three companies of cavalry who led us had quite 
lively skirmishing. 

At one point the Rebels took advantage of an old line of 
works and made quite a stubborn resistance, but our regiment, 
though we were deployed and advanced as skirmishers, did not 
get a shot the whole day. Just as we turned off the road to 
bivouac the Rebels opened a piece of artillery on us, but fired 
only a few shots and hurt no one. Item : Saw a lovely girl to-

day. Item: Had on the Union to-day. Item: Had my first 
drink of milk since the 26th of December, '63. Item: Have 
an oppossum which "Rueben" is to cook for my breakfast. 
Heavy cannonading west of us. 

McDonough, November 16, 1864, n p. m. 
Made 14 miles to-day through a really fine country. Only 
saw one house though, that looked like living. Forage is no 
name for the good things our foragers find here. I notify you 
that I had eggs for supper. There was some lively cannonad- 
ing toward Love joy this morning, but it has been quiet ever 
since. Think the "Militia" has discovered that this party 
''sizes their pile," and have "fled to the mountain." Our whole 
corps are on the road to-day. The advance got into camp 
five miles ahead, at noon. We got here one hour ago, and our 
division camps six miles back. The roads are excellent and we 
travel right along. We all voted this morning that opossum 
meat was good enough for white folks. I liked it very much. 

Near Jackson, Ga., November 17, 1864, 12 a. m. 
Have just had our coffee. Marched some 17 miles to-day. 
Begin to see where the "rich planters" come in. This is prob- 
ably the most gigantic pleasure excursion ever planned. It 
already beats everything I ever saw soldiering, and promises 
to prove much richer yet. I wish Sherman would burn the 
commissary trains, we have no use for what they carry, and 
the train only bothers us. It is most ludicrous to see the ac- 
tions of the negro women as we pass. They seem to be half 
crazy with joy, and when a band strikes up they go stark 
mad. Our men are clear discouraged with foraging, they 
can't carry half the hogs and potatoes they find right along 
the road. The men detailed for that purpose are finding lots 
of horses and mules. The 6th Iowa are plumb crazy on the 
horse question.

Springs, 40 miles from Macon, 

November 18, 1864. 

We got here at noon but will wait until to-morrow, I under- 
stand, for the 3d and 4th Divisions to lay a pontoon bridge 
across the Ocmulgee river. This has been a summer resort of 
some note. From 800 to 1,000 people congregate here. The 
spring is a little stream of water not larger than your finger, 
which runs from the rock at the rate of a gallon a minute. It 
is sulphur water with some other ingredient that gives it a 
very disagreeable ordor. This is quite a romantic place. For- 
aged some peach brandy, which was destroyed. 

Near Hillsboro, November 19, 1864. 

Have been foraging to-day. Crossed the Ocmulgee at Oc- 
mulgee Mills, on pontoons. This river is much like the Chat- 
tahoochie, but not so broad. I am lost from the division to- 
night and camped near the 2d Division. By the kindness of 
Mrs. Elizabeth Celia Pye, I occupy a feather bed to-night. It 
is the first house I have been in for the last three months. 
She understood from the Rebels that we burned all houses and 
she took all her things out and hid them in the woods. The 
foragers found them and brought them in to her. Had an 
excellent supper with the boys. This is a level, fine country, 
and has been well cultivated. 

Near Clinton, November 20, 1864. 

Struck out foraging before daylight this morning. Al- 
most any house on the road to-day would furnish pork and 
potatoes enough for a brigade. I got to the regiment 
about 8 p. m. last night. They say our brigade marched 
until 3 a. m., and the reveille sounded before the men got 
through supper. We passed over the scene of Stoneman's 
fighting and surrender last August. Some of our men 
found two of our dead soldiers unburied, which don't speak 
well for the Rebels, and is charged against them. I think 
there is less pillaging this trip than I ever saw before. 



322 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Near Macon, Ga., November 21, 1864. 

This makes seven days from Atlanta, 114 miles by the 
roads we have marched. I think that time for an army like 
ours, over bad roads, too, for at least four days, is unprece- 
dented. 

Our cavalry had a little skirmish at Macon last evening 
and were driven back. I heard some cannonading, but 
don't think it amounted to much. There was a little skir- 
mish about the rear of our division at 4 this p. m., but beside 
racing and maybe capturing some half-dozen of our fora- 
gers, it amounted to nothing. Our left occupied Milledge- 
ville. Governor Brown is here at Macon, also Beaure- 
gard, and they have scraped together some ten or a dozen 
things to defend the town with. I don't think from looks 
at present, that "Pap" is going to try the town, but can't 
tell. We have thrown up a little rail barricade this even- 
ing, which looks as if we were intending to destroy the 
Macon and Savannah railroad, on which rests the right of 
our brigade. We are afraid at this writing that Sheaff 
Herr was captured to-day. He was foraging where that 
little skirmish took place this p. m., and Rebels were seen 
after, and within 75 yards of him. It has rained steadily 
all day and for the last 60 hours, but has turned cold and 
is now clear. 

Near Griswoldville, November 22, 1864. 
Has been a gay day for our brigade. The other two 
brigades of our division went to work on the railroad this 
morning, and we on a reconnoisance toward Macon. 
Found Rebel cavalry at once. My Companies A and B, 
were thrown out as skirmishers. Forty of us drove at least 
400 Rebel cavalry at least four miles, and kept them a mile 
ahead of the brigade. I think we killed and wounded at 
least 20 of them. We finally charged them out of a rail 
barricade and thoroughly stampeded them. It was the 
richest thing I ever saw. We got highly complimented 
on the way we drove them. Griswoldville was the point 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 323 

we started for, and having reached it we lay there an hour 
or so, and were then ordered back to the brigade. We 
found it in line along an open field, building a rail barricade 
along the front. We had a nice open field without even a 
fence on it, full 600 yards wide in our front. We were get- 
ting dinner, not dreaming of a fight, when lively musketry 
opened on the picket line, and in a minute more our pickets 
came in flying. A fine line of Johnnies pushed out of the 
woods after them, and then started for us. We com- 
menced throwing up logs in our front and did not fire a 
shot until they were within 250 yards of us, by which time 
our works would protect us from musketry. We all felt 
that we had a sure thing, and had there been but one line 
of Rebels, we would have let them come up close to us. 
But, by the time the first line had got within 250 yards of 
us, three other lines had emerged from the woods, and they 
had run two batteries out on the field further to our right 
which opened on us. Our artillery returned the fire, but was 
silenced almost immediately. We then let loose on them 
with our muskets, and if we did not interest them, it is 
queer. One after another their lines crumbled to pieces, 
and they took the run to save themselves. There was a 
ravine 50 yards in front of us, and as the Rebels did not 
dare to run back over that field, they broke for the ravine. 
It was awful the way we slaughtered those men. Once 
in the ravine most of them escaped by following it up, the 
willows and canes screening them. We let a skirmish line 
into the ravine, which gobbled some 50 prisoners, a num- 
ber of Africans among them. It was a most complete 
repulse, and when the numbers alone are considered, a 
glorious thing for us. Only our little brigade of say 1,100 
muskets were engaged on our side and no support was 
nearer than four miles (and then but one brigade), while 
the Rebels had four brigades and two regiments, about 
6,000 men. But the four brigades were "Militia." We 
estimate their loss at 1,000, and I do not think it an over- 
estimate. Ours is 14 killed and 42 wounded in the whole 
21 



324 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

brigade; four killed and seven wounded in the regiment; 
two in my company; 25 out of 30 Rebel bullets went 20 
feet over our heads. Not one of ours went higher than 
their heads. Gen. C. C. Wolcutt was wounded much as 
Colonel Wright was, but more severely. No officers in our 
regiment were wounded. Two Rebel generals were either 
killed or wounded General George, who formerly com- 
manded in north Mississippi, and General Hall or Call. I 
was never so affected at the sight of wounded and dead 
before. 

Old grey-haired and weakly-looking men and little boys, 
not over 15 years old, lay dead or writhing in pain. I did pity 
those boys, they almost all who could talk, said the Rebel 
cavalry gathered them up and forced them in. 

We took all inside our skirmish line that could bear mov- 
ing, to our hospital, and covered the rest with the blankets 
of the dead. I hope we will never have to shoot at such men 
again. They knew nothing at all about fighting, and I think 
their officers knew as little, or else, certainly knew nothing 
about our being there. About dark we moved back to this 
place, two miles from the battle field. The Johnnies drew off 
before we did, I think. 

Near Gordon, November 23, 1864. 

Came here to-day, about eight miles, find the Army of the 
Tennessee all here. Have heard nothing of the Rebels to-day ; 
saw ice one and one-half inches thick that formed last night. 
Wore my overcoat all day. The left wing is either at Milledge- 
ville or gone on east. A branch road runs up to the Capitol 
from the Macon and Savannah railroad, leaving it at Gordon. 
It is now all destroyed. This road is very easily destroyed. 
The iron is laid on stringers, which are only fastened to the 
ties with wooden pins. We have yet done nothing at it, but 
boys who have, say they pry up one stringer with the iron on 
it, roll it over to the other half of the track, lay some rails 
on, and fire it. The iron being firmly fastened to the strin- 
ger, expanding under the heat destroys it completely. The 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 325 

country here is quite rolling, not quite as rich as the 
Indian Spring country, but there is yet plenty of forage. 
The woods are mostly pine, and we are all most anxious 
to get where we will have some other fuel. The smoke of 
pine wood is so disagreeable. 

Irwinton, November 24, 1864. 

Made 12 miles to-day over a rolling but well settled 
country. This is a nice little 700 county town. I hear that 
the troops that were at Macon are passing us on our right. 
Suppose they want to get in our front to annoy us again. 
They had better keep out of our way. Had another roman- 
tic meeting to-day with a Miss Howell. Spent the evening 
at her house. A charming girl, very accomplished. Ad- 
mire her very much. Understand to-day that "Pap's" 
headquarters are at Howell Cobb's house in Milledgville. 
Some of the men saw a Macon paper of the 2ist inst. It 
gave the proceedings of a citizen's meeting. In resolu- 
tions they declared that Sherman's army must be stopped 
in its mad career and pledged themselves to turn out en 
masse and harrass us all day and night. In fact, to give us 
no rest at all. The operations of the next day show how 
they commenced their good work. Have not heard any- 
thing of them since. 

Near Ball's Ferry, Oconee River, 

November 25, 1864. 

Got off at daylight ; made some eight miles, formed in a 
line in a field. "Halt!" "Cover!" "Front!" "Stack arms!" 
Now men get rails and fix for the night. So we think we 
have plenty of time and make our motions accordingly. We 
had just got our things fairly unpacked when the "Gen- 
eral" sounded. Fifteen minutes afterward the assembly, 
and we were again on the march. All right. This miser- 
able pine smoke again to-night. Saw the I7th Corps 
to-day for the first time on the trip. They tried to cross 



326 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

the river at the railroad bridge, but the Johnnies would 
not let them, and they had to come down to our road. I 
think we are to-night half way on our journey. The boys 
had a great time last night in Irwinton. The citizens had 
buried a great many things to keep them from the "van- 
dals" and the boys soon found it out. Hundreds of them 
were armed with sharpened sticks probing the earth, 
"prospecting." They found a little of everything, and I 
guess they took it all to the owners, eatables and drinka- 
bles. We fell in at retreat, and had general order No 26 
read to us for I guess the 2Oth time. It declares that "any 
soldier or army follower who shall be convicted of the 
crime of arson or robbery, or who shall be caught pillag- 
ing, shall be shot, and gives officers and non-commissioned 
ditto the right to shoot pillagers in the act." There have 
been 20 to 30 booms of artillery at the ferry this evening. 
Think it was the 2d Division. They'll be smart Rebels 
who keep that division from laying their pontoons. 

Eight miles east of Oconee River, three miles south 
of M. & S. R. R. 

November 26, 1864, 12 p. m. 

Howard wrote Osterhaus a letter congratulating him 
on the success in the Griswoldville fight, and had it published 
to us to-day. 

HEADQUARTERS DEPT. AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE., 
GORDON, GA., November 23d, 1864. 

Mayor General Osterhaus, Com'dg. i$th Corps: 
General : 

I take sincere pleasure in congratulating the Brigade of 
General Walcutt, of General Wood's Division of the I5th 
Corps, on its complete sucess in the action of yesterday. 

Officers from other commands who were looking on say 
that there never was a better brigade of soldiers. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 327 

I am exceedingly sorry that any of our brave men should 
fall, and for the suffering of the wounded, the thanks of the 
army are doubly due to them. 

I tender my sympathy through you to the brave and excel- 
lent commander of the brigade, Brigadier General Walcutt. 

It is hoped that his wound will not disable him. 

Very respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 
(Signed) O. O. HOWARD, 

Major General. 

P. S. The loss of the enemy is estimated from 1,500 to 
2,000 killed, wounded, and prisoners. O. O. H., M. G. 

We lay in camp until 4 p. m., when we started, and after 
three miles of miserable pine swamp we crossed the Oco- 
nee on pontoons. It was dark, but I noticed that the 
current was rapid and the water looked deep. 

I counted 80 steps on the bridge and ten boats under it. 
I am sure that I to-day saw palm-leaf fan material growing. 
It is a most singular looking plant. The country this side 
of the river to our camp is quite level and four- fifths culti- 
vated. All the woods pine, and soil all sand. 

Riddlesville, November 27, 1864. 

Was foraging this morning and supplied the regiment 
with staples within a mile of camp. Took the road as 
train guard at i a. m. Have had a tedious march over 
sandy roads and through pine woods for u miles. It is 
too dark to see the town. Have heard no "music" to-day. 
We crossed the head waters of the Ohoopee river to-day. 
Saw a magnolia tree by the road. The first I have seen in 
Georgia. 

Old Indian Battle Ground, near Drummond, 

November 28, 1864. 

Made a dozen miles to-day through the thickest pine 
woods I ever saw. There is no white or yellow pine here ; 



328 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

it is all pitch. I think the division has been lost nearly all 
day. We have followed old Indian trails four-fifths of the 
time. 

The foragers have found a large number of horses and 
mules in the swamps to-day. Plenty of forage. Sergeant 
Penney, of my company, died in the ambulance to-day. 
He was taken sick in the ranks at 8 p. m., 26th, of lung 
fever. He has never been right healthy, but when well was 
always an excellent soldier. Lieutenant Dorrance swal- 
lowed his false teeth a few nights ago, and complains that 
they don't agree with him. 

I hear that Wheeler jumped the 2Oth Corps yesterday 
and that they salivated him considerably. We caught a 
couple of his men to-day, on our road, stragglers. We pick 
up a good many stray Rebels along the road, but they are 
not half guarded and I think get away nearly as fast as 
captured. 

Ten miles south of Sevastopol, 

November 29, 1864. 

All day in an awful pine forest, hardly broken by fence 
or clearing. I never saw such a lonesome place. Not a 
bird, not a sign of animal life, but the shrill notes of the 
tree frog. Not a twig of undergrowth, and no vegetable 
life but just grass and pitch pine. The country is very 
level and a sand bed. The pine trees are so thick on the 
ground that in some places we passed to-day the sight was 
walled in by pine trunks within 600 yards for nearly the 
whole circle. Just at dusk we passed a small farm, where 
I saw growing, for the first time, the West India sugar 
cane. One of the boys killed the prettiest snake I ever 
saw. It was red, yellow and black. Our hospital steward 
put it in liquor. We made about n miles to-day. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 329 

Eight miles east of Summerville, 

November 30, 1864. 

Passed through the above named town this morning. 
All pine woods again to-day. Stopped at the first house I 
came to this morning and asked the resident, an ash- 
colored negress, something about the country. She said 
she'd had the chills and fever so long she didn't know any- 
thing, but "over dar was a house whar de folks had some 
sense." Captain Smith and I walked over to the house 
she pointed to and found a fine old German, very anxious 
to know if we intended to burn his house. After he cooled 
down a little he grew much Union. He said he had been 
ordered to join the army one, two, three, twenty times, 
but had told them he would rather be shot than take up 
arms against the United States. The I2th Indiana band 
struck up as we passed his house, and the music touched 
the old fellow's heart. The tears rolled down his face 
and he blubbered out, "That is the first music I have heard 
for four years; it makes me think of home. D n this 
Georgia pine wood." He said that sugar is the staple here 
in peace times. The foragers brought in loads of it this 
evening. 

Cushingville Station, east bank of Ogeechee river, 

December I, 1864. 

Ten miles to-day. Had just finished the last line when 
(the officers are talking over the rumors of the day) I 
heard Captain Smith say, "Our folks captured one Rebel 
ram." I asked him where, and he pointed out an old he 
sheep, one of the men had just brought in. Our regiment 
is the only part of our corps this side of the river. We are 
guarding the prisoners who are repairing the bridge. The 
Rebels had destroyed one section of it. The i/th Corps 
crossed near the railroad bridge, but are ten miles behind us 
to-night. This river is about 60 yards wide here, and we 



33O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

have sounded it in several places and found it from 12 to 
15 feet deep. It has no abrupt banKS here, but runs river, 
lake, swamp, to dry land. I find here again what I thought 
was palm-leaf fan material, on the Oconee river. It turns 
out to be swamp palmetto. The palmetto tree also grows 
near here. Twelve p. m. Have been out with 25 men burn- 
ing railroad. I did not do much of it, for it is the I7th Corps' 
work. Two of Howard's scouts came to us while we were 
at work. Said they had just left Millen, and left 150 Rebels 
there. Millen is four miles from here and is the junction 
of the Savannah and Augusta railroad. One of our men cap- 
tured eight mules and two horses to-day. The trees along 
the river are covered with Spanish moss, like we saw so 
much of at Black River, Miss. The men shake their heads 
when they see it and say, "Here's your ager." We are only 
guarding this bridge until the i/th Corps gets here. Our 
corps are going down the other side of the river. An im- 
mense number of "contrabands" now follow us, most of 
them able-bodied men, who intend going into the army. 
We have not heard a Rebel gun since the 22d of last month. 
They don't trouble our march a particle. 

West bank of Ogeechee River, eight miles 
south of Millen, 

December 2, 1864. 

Recrossed the river this morning and, joining the bri- 
gade, made some eight miles to-day. We are ahead of the 
rest of the army or could have made more. Pine country, 
almost uninhabited. Saw to-day my favorite tree the 
magnolia. Have seen but few of them in Georgia. In a 
swamp we passed through to-day a darkey pointed out to 
us some lemon trees. Saw in the same swamp some yel- 
low pine. Nearly all the pine this side of the Oconee has 
been the "pitch" variety. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 33! 

South bank of Scull Creek, 
December 3, 1864. 

We have laid here all day, being our first rest since leav- 
ing Atlanta. Had to wait for the i/th Corps and "left 
wing" to catch up. We laid a pontoon across the river 
this morning, and two of our brigade went over to tear up 
railroad The i/th Corps came up and relieved them 
about 2 p. m. 

Colonel Catterson (our brigade commander) told me to- 
day that a dispatch from Bragg to had been inter- 
cepted yesterday, that stated that he was moving on us 
from Savannah, with 10,000 infantry and Dick Taylor's 
Cavalry. See if he don't "come to grief." Two of our divi- 
sions are moving 12 miles to our right the 2d and 3d 
the 4th is with us. 

Kilpatrick has gone for the Millen and Augusta railroad. 
If he hurts it much he'll do more than cavalry usually do. 

December 4, 1864. 

Got on the road before day-light and made 16 miles 
easily by 3 :3O p. m. Good road, many fine places, and 
excellent forage, from 75 to 500 bushels of sweet potatoes 
on a farm. Heard cannonading for two hours this morn- 
ing. Think it must have been in the vicinity of the 2Oth 
Corps. Quite a variety of forest trees to-day among the 
pines, but all of a stunted growth. Saw a very curious 
cactus by the roadside. 

Almost all of the people from this section have sloped. 
I think I have not seen more than 12 white male citizens 
since we left Atlanta, at their homes. Am fully persuaded 
that Grant's "cradle and grave" idea is correct. 

Thirty-six miles from Savannah, 

December 5, 1864. 

Corse had the road to-day, but Wood side-tracked, took 
"catch roads" and got into camp, making 16 miles as soon 
as Corse. Rather poor country, farms small, and much

pine. Negroes swarmed to us to-day. I saw one squad of 
30 or 40 turned back. Sherman's order is not to let any 
more go with us than we can use and feed. A nice yellow 
girl came to our regiment about an hour after dark. She 
is the property of Milly Drake, who lives 30 miles back. 
The girl showed our men where Milly hid her horses and 
mules, in return for which, after the column passed, gentle 
Milly took half a rail and like to wore the wench out. 
Broke her arm and bruised her shamefully. That was all 
the reason that the girl had for running away. 

Eden Ferry, Ogeechee river, 

December 6, 1864. 

We lay in camp until I p. m. when we suddenly pulled 
out and made this point, and had works up by daik. 
There was a good wagon bridge over the river at this 
point, which the Rebels partially destroyed. But a portion 
of our 3d Brigade, which had the advance, got across on 
the remains and stirred up a little skirmish. Killed four 
Rebels without any loss to us. 

Our 2d Division got across three miles below. The 3d, 
I guess is with them. Hear nothing of the other corps. 
In the swamps to-day I saw more of the "barren lemon 
tree." We were talking over last night what this army 
had cost the Confederacy since the 4th of October last, 
when we started from Eastpoint after Hood. We all agree 
that the following estimate is not too high in any particu- 
lar: 100,000 hogs, 20,000 head of cattle, 15,000 horses and 
mules, 500,000 bushels of corn, 100,000 of sweet potatoes. 
We are driving with us many thousand of the cattle. The 
destruction of railroad property has been complete when- 
ever within our reach. I can learn nothing of the prospect 
of a fight at Savannah, or whether we are going there. All 
think, though, that we will see tide-water this week. Peo- 
ple here say they often hear the firing both at Savannah 
and Charleston. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 333 

Wright's Bridge, Ogeechee River, 

December 7, 1864. 

We have not moved to-day. Sergt. N. Breed, of my 
company, who was shot through the right lung in the bat- 
tle of November 22d, died to-day. He has been hauled in 
an ambulance ever since and improved all the time until 
the last two days. We were all sure that he would get 
well. There was no better soldier in the army. Every 
one liked him. Hear a little cannonading this p. m. a few 
miles down the river. Lieutenant Dorrance's servant cap- 
tured a beautiful coal black squirrel, with white nose and 
white ear tips. He is larger than any fox squirrel I ever 
saw. 

Five miles from James' Point, Canoochie River, 

December 8, 1864. 

Another "Shermanism." Our 3d and 4th Divisions 
crossed the Ogeechee river yesterday at Eden. We all 
supposed that we would follow, this morning, but here we 
are after 18 miles hard marching. The 2d Division is 
ahead of us and part of it at the river. Heard a few cannon 
shots there a few minutes ago. We are after the railroad 
that runs from Savannah to Thomasville. Kilpatrick 
crossed the Savannah river yesterday, into South Carolina. 
Miserable country to-day. The last ten days have been 
quite warm. One perspires freely lying in the shade 
during some of the warmest hours. 

Same place, December 9, 1864. 

The division lay in camp all day. Our regiment 
marched 12 miles on a reconnoisance, toward the Canoo- 
chie river, southwest.. Found nothing, but some good 
foraging. Cannonading at four or five different points, on 
our left and front. Citizens say the most distant is at 
Charleston, Savannah and Fort McAlister. It is said that 
Corse's Division (4th), of our corps, had a fight east of the 



334 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Ogeechee to-day and were victorious, taking 50 prisoners 
and one gun. Part of our 2d Division crossed at James' 
Point to-day, and burned the Gulf railroad bridge and 
four miles of trestle-work west of the Ogeechee. They 
found very large rice plantations, which are flooded with 
tide-water. I guess Fort McAlister cannot be reached by 
infantry on account of the country around it overflowing. 
The men say that Kilpatrick has gone around Savannah 
and "cut the coast." Big raid ! 

Before Savannah, December 10, 1864. 

Crossed the Ogeechee near the mouth of the Canoochie, 
then a canal, and then up the tow path toward the city. 
All the other divisions of our corps are ahead of us. An 
awful country to get through, all lakes and swamps. We 
are now five miles from Savannah. Have just got our 
works up and got our suppers. Hear some skirmishing on 
our right, should think a mile from us. Commenced rain- 
ing at dark and continued. Made 20 miles to-day. 

Before Savannah, December n, 1864, 8 a. m. 
Corse's Division is just on our right. He woke me up 
this morning by firing a volley of eight 12-pounders, in real 
old Atlanta fashion. He was answered by three Rebel 
guns planted on the defenses of Savannah, across a field 
and swamp from us. We are in good range of them. Nine 
p. m. Found this morning that the Rebels have a big 
swamp and lake between their position and ours. It is im- 
possible to get at them there. Our corps was ordered to 
swing to the right. The Rebel battery had fair view and 
close range on any road we could take, so we had to wait 
until night, when ours and the 3d Division passed them without 
any trouble. We are now on a main road, straight and 
wide enough for three wagons, which we think leads to Pu- 
laski. This is a country of awful swamps, with level flats, 
between which are rice fields, and most of them have three 
feet of water on them. Many think we are not going to 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 335 

make an effort for Savannah at present, but will open com- 
munication with the coast. It is as much as we can do to 
find dry land enough to camp on. We are not caring a cent 
what "Pap" does. It is quite cold again ; to-night promises 
to be the coldest night of the winter. 

Before Savannah, December 15, 1864. 

First mail goes in 15 minutes. Our 2d Division charged 
and took Fort McAlister, at sunset, the I3th 19 guns and 
300 prisoners ; lost 92 men killed and wounded. We will 
have Savannah, sure. 

Before Savannah, December 19, 1864. 

We have only been here a couple of days, but to-night 
we are to make and occupy a line within 700 yards of the 
Rebels. 

Green Square, Savannah, Camp iO3d Illinois 
"Provost Guards." 

December 22, 1864. 

We have just by a hair's breadth missed what would 
have been a most unpleasant fight. We lay on the west 
side of the Ogeechee, with the enemy on the opposite 
shore, strongly fortified. We had crawled through the 
mud and established a line of rifle pits within 125 yards 
of them; 150 portable bridges had been built in our divi- 
sion and I believe everything was in readiness for hot 
work the next day, the 2Oth. The morning of the 2ist 
finds the enemy gone across the river into South Carolina. 
The next day we moved into town and our regiment and 
the 4Oth from our brigade are put on provost duty. 

Green Square, Savannah, Ga. 

January 9, 1865. 

Thinking we for once in the service had a chance to 
enjoy quiet life, two of our number were sent to Hilton 
Head for a full supply of men's apparel for the outer man, 
and of refreshments substantial and fancy for the inner. 



336 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

They returned to-day just in time to receive marching 
orders. The men's clothing was packed in valises, and all 
the eatables sold to parties who remain here, save one bar- 
rel of Irish potatoes. We leave to-morrow morning. Major 
Willison's resignation was accepted to-day, and this evening 
the officers unanimously agreed to recommend me to fill 
the vacancy. There was not a hint towards any one else. 
I take it as a high compliment. I am the youngest captain 
in the regiment, and this recommendation made by men 
whom I have campaigned with for two and a half years, 
and not one of whom has been accused of failing to do his 
duty in the service, makes me feel a little proud. I will 
value the recommendation more than the commission, if 
I get it. 

Thunderbolt, Ga., January 10, '65. 

We joined the brigade in the suburbs of the city, and 
took the shell road to this place, only four miles by land, 
but 18 by water. There are some fine works here, erected 
by the Rebels to guard the water approach to the city. 
I send you a little chip of a palmetto log in a Rebel work 
here. 

On board the steamer Crescent, Atlantic Ocean, 

January 12, 1865. 

We are steaming on that rolling deep we've heard so 
much of, and which I have already seen and felt enough of. 
There is but little air stirring and the water is quite 
smooth, but so near the shore there is always a ground 
swell, which is to me somewhat demoralizing. We are out 
of sight of land and just before dark we saw a school of 
porpoise which looked just like a drove of hogs in the water. 
Some of the men wanted to go foraging when they saw 
them. This makes me quite dizzy, but I would not miss 
it on any account. I saw the full moon rise from the water 
about 6:30 p. m. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 337 

Beaufort, S. C., January 13, 1865. 

Retired about n p. m. and woke up here this morning 1 . 
A very handsome, small town, about the size of Canton, 
but more fine dwellings. All have been confiscated and 
sold to the negroes and white Union men. Find the i/th 
A. C. here, but about ready to move out to drive the 
Rebels away from the ferry, where we will lay our pon- 
toons to the main land. The I4th and 2Oth will move by 
land and join us on the main land somewhere. I can 
hardly imagine what our next move will be, but mostly 
think we will tear up the railroads through the Carolinas 
and take Charleston and Wilmington during the spring 
campaign. The health of the command is perfect, and all 
are in most soldierly spirits. Thinking nothing impossible 
if Sherman goes with us, and go he will. 

Near Beaufort, S. C., January 26, 1865. 

We have had heavy rains and now very cold weather 
without being in the least prepared for it. We move to- 
morrow at 7 a. m. for the main land and forage. 

All tents are to be left behind "until they can be for- 
warded by water." That seems to point to a short and 
sharp campaign, and we all think Charleston is the ob- 
jective point. 

Near Pocataligo, S. C., January 27, 1865. 

Moved out at 7 a. m. this morning, crossed Broad river 
on pontoons, and are about four miles on the main land 
towards Charleston. Can't tell our position, but here the 
Rebels hold all the crossings on the opposite side of the 
river six miles ahead and so far as reconnoitered, with 
fortifications and artillery. 

The I7th Corps lay to our left extending across the C. 
& S. R. R. We made about 13 miles to-day. Saw some 
fine plantations on the road, nothing but chimneys in them, 
though. It feels good and homelike once more to be out 
loose. The boys all feel it and they act more like school- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

boys, having a holiday, than the veterans they are. 
Wouldn't it be a joke if we were to get badly whipped 
over this river? I believe it would do us good. We are 
too conceited. The river ahead is the Combahee, and we 
are 43 miles from Charleston on the C. & Beaufort road. 

Six miles south of Combahee River, 

January 28, 1865, 6 p. m. 

The campaign commences Monday. It is yet cold ; 
about an inch of ice forms every night, and sleeping out 
without tents is not a fair sample of paradise. I am in 
excellent health and we are all anxious to be en route. 

Combahee River, Charleston and Beaufort road, 

January 29, 1865. 

We have had some rich sport to-day. Our regiment and 
the 4Oth are out here on a little reconnoisance, and making 
a demonstration pretending to be building a bridge on the 
river, etc. A party of Rebels saluted our skirmishers when 
they got to the river bank with a volley, but the boys soon 
drove them off, with no loss to us (or the Rebels either). 
We lay around a couple of hours shooting at marks, etc., 
when a party of the Rebels attempted to reoccupy their pits. 
We saw them coming for a full mile and they had hardly 
got within the very longest range before the 4Oth sent 
them back flying. Later in the p. m. half a dozen Johnnies 
arose from the mud and weeds and though they were 
across the river, surrendered to us. They are really de- 
serters, though they say not. Had a great time getting 
them over the river. Four board and log rafts were made, 
launched, and put off after them. Two of them were 
wrecked against the bridge benches, and the other two 
succeeded in bringing over three Johnnies ; we left the 
other three there. I certainly would not have risked my- 
self on one of those rafts for 500 prisoners or 5,000 de- 
serters. General Hazen of our corps has been made a 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 339 

full major general. The other division commanders only by 
brevet, and they feel a little sore over it. To-day one of 
General Wood's aids saw a turkey buzzard, and pointed it 
out to the general, saying, "there is a turkey." Old Woods 
looked at it and answered, "I think that is a turkey by 
brevet." 

McPhersonsville, S. C, January 30, 1865. 
We returned from Combahee river last night and at 10 
p. m. received orders to move at 6 a. m. Came through 
Pocataligo and have made 14 miles to-day. Quite a place, 
but there is not even a clearing. Say 50 ordinary dwell- 
ings dropped down in the pine woods, and you have it. 
Not a citizen, white or black, here. 

January 31, 1865. 

Lay still all day. This place was a country summer 
resort. I was in a house to-day; the walls were rough 
boards white- washed, the floors were very rough, and I 
think had never been carpeted, yet the room was filled 
with mahogany furniture of the best quality, had a fine 
piano, splendid plate mirror, and a fine library. About 20 
sets of buck horns were nailed to the walls in lines. Hear 
that the i/th Corps has crossed the Combahee. We hear 
that strict orders against burning and all foraging is to 
be done even more regularly than before. 

Hickory Hill, S. C., February i, 1865. 
Fifteen miles to-day and had an excellent supper of 
South Carolina ham, honey and sweet potatoes. Found a 
good deal of road blockaded to-day, but the pioneers re- 
moved the obstructions so rapidly that the train did not 
have to halt once. The Rebels disputed our advance a 
little, killed a cavalryman and wounded another for us, 
but did not stop the column a moment. Sherman rode at 
the rear of our regiment all day and was quite sociable with 
some of the men. Don't think any of the officers noticed 
him. Miserable pine land country, but some quite large 
plantations.

34 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

February 2, 1865. 

The advance started at daylight, but we are the rear 
guard of the corps and will not get off before 4 p. m. We 
have no idea of our destination, but are now traveling the 
Augusta road. 

The country is very level, but every mile or so there is 
a little swale or depression of but a few feet, and before a 
hundred wagons pass over it thorough corduroying is 
necessary. The foragers had sharp fighting for what they 
got to-day. We had two captured, Billy Haller and a 4Oth 
boy. Our boys captured several and killed three. Only made 
six miles. 

Baren's Mills, S. C., February 3, 1865. 
Fifteen miles to-day. The I7th is having some pretty 
lively firing on our right. At a house I stopped at to-day 
a "cit" told me we were 95 miles from Charleston, 65 
from Augusta, and 33 from Branchville. That is as near 
as I can tell you where we are. We expect to reach Bu- 
ford's bridge on the Salkehatchie, to-morrow. The Rebels 
have fortified there, I hear. Our brigade has the advance, 
and fun to-morrow, if there is any. It has rained since 12 
last night. 

Buford's Bridge, north side Salkehatchie River, 

February 4, 1865. 

Most unaccountably, to me, the Rebels evacuated an 
impregnable position (if there is such a thing), and our 
brigade was saved thereby from making some more his- 
tory, for which I am grateful. A straight pike or cause- 
way three quarters of a mile long and in which there are 
24 bridges, was our only chance of crossing. They had 
strong embrasured works, but left an hour before our ad- 
ance reached their fortifications. We got a lot of good 
horses and more good forage than I ever before saw brought 
in. I am sure that we have either a nice ham or shoulder 
for every two men in the regiment, and I think, more. A 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 34! 

Company B boy got a good strong horse which he let me 
have. People here say that the Rebels have all gone to 
Branchville. Colonel Catterson told Sherman (he was in 
our camp some time to-night) that a negro reported that 
the Rebels had all gone to Branchville. "Pap" replied, 

"They can go to Branchville and be d d." We infer 

from that, that we don't go there. He also said to Catter- 
son, who was superintending the bridge building, "Build 
them strong, Catterson, build them strong; the whole army 
may have to pass over them, and the 'Army of the Cumberland' 
is a very heavy army, sir." Besides the little slur on the 
I4th and 2oth, that gave us an idea of the whereabouts of 
the left wing. 

I just now heard what made the Rebels evacuate this. 
Mowers' Division of the I7th formed line and marched 
across this stream and swamp eight miles below at River 
Bridge. They waded through three miles of water and then 
took the Rebel works with a loss to us of only 12 killed 
and 72 wounded. I think that beats anything I ever heard 
of in the show line. There was a town of 20 or 25 houses 
here, but we have used it up in building bridges. 

Twelve miles south of Johnston's Summit, Augusta and 
Branchville Railroad, 

February 5, 1865. 

They call the stations on this road "turnouts." Negroes 
are swarming into our camps. I never heard a negro use 
the word "buckra" until last night. One of the 9/th Indi- 
ana was killed this morning while foraging close to 
camp. Our men killed two and captured four Johnnies, 
all dressed in our clothing. Only moved four miles to-day, 
and will probably lay here a few days as Sherman told 
Wood we were four days ahead of time, he having counted 
it would take that long to effect a crossing at Buford's 
bridge. 



34 2 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Little Salkehatchie River, 

February 6, 1865, 2 p. m. 

Yesterday was quite warm, but my overcoat is useful 
again to-day. General Kilpatrick caught up with us last 
night, also General Williams with five brigades of the 2oth 
A. C. So instead of waiting several days Sherman said 
he'd chance them for the railroad with what troops there 
are up. We took the road this morning. Stopped here for 
the 3d Division to clear the swamp of some Johnnies, 
which I think they have about effected. 

Five p. m. Miserable swamp, but the 3d Division only 
lost two men in crossing. There must have been a division 
of Wheeler's here by the signs. 

Bamber's Station, A. & C. R. R. 

February 7, 1865. 

Our regiment led the corps to-day. The i/th Corps 
strikes the railroad at Midway, three miles to our right, 
and the 2Oth to the left five miles. We are 14 miles north- 
west of Branchville. The enemy are on the opposite bank 
of the Edisto, two miles from us. There is a great "peace" 
excitement among the citizens here. This day's work cuts 
off all railroad communication between Georgia and the 
eastern part of the Confederacy. I saw another new thing 
(to me) in the destruction of railroads. After the iron has 
been heated by the burning ties, by a simple contrivance, 
four men twist each rail twice around. They put a clamp 
on each end of the rail, and put a lever in the clamp per- 
pendicularly, and two men at each end of the lever, will 
put the neatest twist imaginable in the heated part of the 
rail. I never saw so much destruction of property before. 
Orders are as strict as ever, but our men understand they 
are in South Carolina and are making good their old 
threats. Very few houses escape burning, as almost every- 
body has run away from before us, you may imagine there 
is not much left in our track. Where a family remains at 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 343 

home they save their house, but lose their stock, and eata- 
bles. Wheeler's Cavalry is about all we have yet found in 
our front and they keep afar off. The citizens fear them 
fully as much as they do us. A lady said to-day that she 
would as lief have us come as Wheeler's men; she could 
see no difference. Wheeler's men say, "Go in, South Caro- 
lina !" and the Yankees say the same thing. We got 50 
bales of cotton here, which I suppose will be burned. 
Struck the railroad at 9 130 a. m. 

Bamberg, S. C, February 9, 1865. 

We were to go to Cannon's bridge on the Edisto four 
miles, but heard the bridge was burned, so we did not go. 
I think we will go up the river towards Augusta. Late 
Confederate papers say that Thomas has started south to- 
wards Montgomery, leaving Hood behind him. Many of 
the officers have strong hopes of something resulting from 
the peace movement. Can't say that I have. 

Near Grahams. C. & A. R. R. 

February 9, 1865. 

Rear guard on our road to-day. Made about a dozen 
miles, very disagreeable march. Snowed a little in the 
morning and terribly cold all day. Got into camp at 7:30 
p. m. This is a pine, sand country, with some very good 
plantations, but all look neglected. The people who re- 
main at home seem an ignorant, forlorn set who don't care 
for their "rights" or anything else. I think the militia 
they have brought out to oppose us must suffer, this 
weather, being unused to the business and unprovided with 
rubbers, etc. Poor devils ! 

February 10, 1865. 

Had no "general" this morning (our signal for getting 
up), so when the "assembly" sounded we climbed from 
our blankets to our saddles and went off on a railroad burn- 



344 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

ing expedition. Our brigade by noon had completely de- 
stroyed two and one-half miles. The i/th and our 3d 
Division crossed the South Edisto to-day, four miles from 
here. We will cross to-morrow, I hear. Also hear that 
S. D. Lee's Corps of Hood's Army is at Augusta. We 
whipped them July 28, '64, and can do it again. I think 
the whole army is here now. We have 1 5-day half rations 
yet. Wonder where it will take us. 

Seven miles west of Orangeburg, S. C, 

February u, 1865. 

Made 18 miles to-day. Crossed South Edisto river in 
rear of the corps. The river here is about 40 yards wide, 
with a swift current, water very clear. First 10 miles 
to-day was through pretty good country, the last eight 
miles mostly pine forest with more rolling ground than 'I 
have seen since we left the Oconee river in Georgia. Re- 
ceived my commission as major to-day, also two letters 
from you dated November 3d and January 4th. I ask 
pardon for thinking that you did not write regularly. The 
fault must be in the mails. All kinds of rumors afloat 
to-night of peace, war, and I don't know what all. We 
came near being burned up last night, the fire crept along 
through the pine leaves and burned my vest, partly, and 
ruined my jacket, and almost spoiled my overcoat, all of 
which were under my head. Also burned the colonel's 
pillow. The flames bursting up woke us, and I expect our 
first motion would have amused a very solemn man. 

Shilling's Bridge, left bank North Edisto River, 

February 12, 1865. 

Started at 7 a. m., moved one-half mile and laid still two 
hours waiting for Hazen and Smith to straighten out ahead 
of us. I thought I'd tell you how we had been bored to- 
day, fooling along the road from 7 a. m. until 3 o'clock in 
the night, making five miles, but it disgusts me to think of 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 345 

it. Crossing the river is what delayed us. The Rebels 
held Hazen there four or five hours and shot a few men 
for him, but he run the 48th Illinois through some swamps 
on their flank, crossed and got some prisoners. They are 
from Hood's army and just got here yesterday. This North 
Edisto is about like the other branch. The I7th Corps 
crossed below our right, and the 2Oth on our left. Can't 
hear anything of the I4th or Kilpatrick. It is freezing now 
and has been very cold all day, yet to get clear water for 
dinner hundreds of the men waded out to the middle of the 
pond (muddy on the border) over their knees in water. 
They think nothing of it. It was the 2d Brigade 2d Divi- 
sion that waded the swamp and the river to flank the 
Rebels from the crossing. A large number of foragers 
waded with them just for devilment. It was from middle 
to arm-pit deep and I suppose they waded at least a mile. 
They got 54 prisoners, and the rest threw down guns, 
knapsacks and everything that impeded their flight. The 
flanking party did not lose a man. The men of this army 
surprise me every day with their endurance, spirit and 
recklessness. 

Twenty-four miles southeast of Columbia, S. C, 

February 13, 1865. 

Made 18 miles to-day. Rear guard for the corps in the 
morning, but the 2d and 3d Divisions took a right hand 
road and in the p. m. the 4th Division also went to the 
right. We followed a cow path to camp. Passed through 
two large turpentine camps. The boys fired most all the trees 
and nearly burned us up. The smoke made the road very 
disagreeable. There is not much destruction of property 
since Logan's last order. Hear of no skirmishing. The 
chivalry give us very little trouble, never stop but at rivers. 
Foragers get a good many animals. Provisions plenty. Hear 
nothing of the left wing, or Kilpatrick.

EXPLANATORY NOTE. 

Until this time the I5th Army Corps had never had a Corps 
Badge, though the other corps commanders had long tried to 
induce General Logan to adopt one. Yielding at last to their 
solicitations he issued the following order: 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 347 

HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, 
BAKER'S PLANTATION, S. C, February 14, 1865. 

GENERAL ORDERS, 

No. 10. 

I.... The following is announced as the badge of this 
Corps : A miniature Cartridge-box, black, one-eighth of 
an inch thick, fifteen-sixteenths of an inch wide, and 
thirteen-sixteenths of an inch deep, set transversely on a 
field of cloth or metal, one and five-eights of an inch 
square ; above the cartridge-box plate will be stamped or 
worked in a curve the motto: "Forty Rounds." The field 
on which the cartridge-box is set will be Red for the ist 
Division, White for the 2d Division, Blue for the 3d Divi- 
sion, and Yellozu for the 4th Division. For the Head- 
quarters of the Corps the field will be parti-colored of Red, 
White, Blue and Yellow. 

II. .. .The badge will invariably be won upon the hat or 
cap. 

III.... It is expected that this badge will be worn con- 
stantly by every officer and soldier in the corps. If any 
Corps in the army has a right to take pride in its badge, 
surely that has which looks back through the long and 
glorious line of Wilson's Creek, Henry, Donelson, Shiloh, 
Russel House, Corinth, luka, Town Creek, Chickasaw 
Bayou, Arkansas Post, Champion Hills, Big Black, Sny- 
der's Bluff, Vicksburg, Jackson, Cherokee Station, Lookout 
Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Ringold, Knoxville, Resaca, 
Kingston, Dallas, New Hope Church, Big Shanty, Kenesaw 
Mountain, Nickojack, Decatur, the 22d and 28th of July, 
before Atlanta, Jonesboro, Lovejoy, Altoona Pass, Gris- 
woldville, Fort McAlister, and scores of minor struggles ; 
the Corps which had its birth under Grant and Sherman 
in the darker days of our struggle ; the Corps which will 
keep on struggling until the death of rebellion. 

BY COMMAND OF MAJOR GENERAL JOHN A. LOGAN : 

MAX WOODHULL, 
Assistant Adjutant General. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

The adoption of the cartridge box as the distinguishing 
badge of the I5th Corps is said to have originated in this 
way: Before the battle of Missionary Ridge a soldier in 
the nth Army Corps asked an Irish soldier of the i$th 
Corps what the badge of his corps was. 

"And phwat is that badge thing?" he asked. 

Being told and having no badge to show in reply, he 
answered, slapping his cartridge box : "It's that, wid 40 
rounds !" 

DIARY CONTINUED. 

Nearing Columbia, S. C., February 14, 1865. 
Good road to-day. Fine rolling country. Sand with 
pine wood and scrub oak. Saw the wagoners use their 
locks to-day for the first time since we crossed the Oconee, 
in Georgia. Logan's escort got after some Johnnie fora- 
gers to-day and captured four wagons and 50 or 60 horses 
and mules. The Rebels are shooting from the other side 
of the river and there was a lot in front of us when we 
stopped here. Lee is said to be in front with 40,000 men. 
It seems to be the opinion that we will have a fight. Can 
probably tell better to-morrow night. Rain all p. m., and 
still quite cold. Wear overcoats all the time. 

Three miles from Columbia, February I5th. 
A rather lively day. We started the Johnnies right by 
our camp. Our brigade in advance of the corps and army. 
The 4Oth Illinois was deployed as skirmishers, and drove 
them four miles rapidly, losing only five men. Our regi- 
ment then relieved them. They opened artillery on us 
and fought stubbornly. It was the Kentucky brigade of 
Wheeler's "Critter Co." We drove them from a splendid 
position and heavy line of works with the assistance of 
three companies of our 3d brigade, 4th Iowa and th 
Ohio. They killed F. M. Cary, of my company and took 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 349 

my orderly Sergt. T. S. Brown's right arm off. Wounded 
three other men in the regiment, Henry H. Orendorff, Joe 
Parkinson and Stewart, of company F. It is said we go 
for the city to-morrow. 

February 16, 1865, 7 a. m. 

The Johnnies shelled our bivouac all night, but hurt no 
one, but induced us to extinguish our fires, and killed one 
of the 48th Illinois. We could hear their cars whistling 
all night. They had large fires near town. We can see 
the steeples of the city plainly this morning. Many think 
the Rebels have left. If not I look for a hard battle 
to-day. There is no firing this morning yet, and our 
skirmish line is advancing. I can see it a mile ahead of 
us. Can see the State House now, and a large portion of 
the city. We can shell it from here. 

Nine a. m. The enemy opened the three guns on us again 
that he used last night, but the skirmish line deployed along 
the river silenced them. 

Ten a. m. The sun has shown himself, dispelled the fog, 
and we find we have an excellent view of the city. From 
our position it looks much like Peoria from the left 
bank of the river. The Congaree here is larger than the 
Illinois. Our batteries have got in position well down on the 
river bank, and some of them are bursting shell over the 
city. Our division moves down to take a closer view ir 
a few minutes. The skirmishers are shooting quite livel) 
across the river. You know our muskets carry up well 
at 800 yards. 'Tis a beautiful morning and view. 

Twelve m. The 2d Division leading, we pushed for the 
Rebel works at 9. Johnnies had mostly retired across the river. 
Our pontoon train running by a Rebel battery made some 
fun. They were furiously shelled and stood quite a heavy 
fire of musketry. Casualties, one mule killed, and the 
seat torn out of a small darkey's pants. We now lay on the 
river side opposite the town. A number of our guns are 



35O ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

practicing on the State House and other prominent build- 
ings, and the Rebels are not answering a shot, though we 
can see a number of cavalry riding through the town. 
Hazen is laying the pontoons above the junction of the 
Saluda and Broad rivers where we will cross. Yesterday 
when the 4Oth Illinois charged the Rebels out of one of 
their numerous barricades a "Forty" boy and a Johnnie had a 
real scuffling fight . Forty downed the Rebel and choked him 
until he surrendered. Some 26th boys captured a Rebel 
colonel after we crossed the Congaree creek. He was 
quite drunk and rode up to the boys who were straggling 
ahead of the skirmish line, and asked them what they 
were waiting for, and why they did not come along. 

8 p. m. Crossed the Saluda, since dark, and stay here 
for the night on the bank of Broad river. 

Columbia, S. C, February i/th. 

The 3d brigade of our division marched all night and 
worked all night before they could get a cable across the 
river to string the pontoons, and the bridge was not com- 
pleted until 10 a. m. There was lively skirmishing all 
the time. Our division crossed first. The 3d brigade cap- 
tured 30 Rebels near the crossing. The Mayor came out 
and surrendered the town to Colonel Stone, commanding 
our 3d brigade. The division marched through Main 
street to the Capitol. We were never so well received by 
citizens before, and the negroes seemed crazy with joy. 
We halted in the street a few minutes, and the boys 
loaded themselves with what they wanted. Whiskey and 
wine flowed like water, and the whole division is now 
drunk. This gobbling of things so, disgusts me much. 
I think the city should be burned, but would like to see it 
done decently. 

February 18, 1865. 

Two-thirds of the city burned last night. The colonel 
and I got up last night and rode through the streets until 
3. At 4 this morning the 4Oth Illinois cleared the streets 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 351 

with bayonets and order again reigned. Our regiment 
is on Provost duty, and I have just been through the streets 
(8:30 p. m.) and it is as quiet as Sunday night in Canton. 

February 19, 1865. 

Another block of the city burned to-day. Our regiment 
was out and stopped the fire from spreading further. Have 
seen the men work better on other occasions. In de- 
stroying some captured ammunition to-day the 63d Illi- 
nois, by an explosion, lost three killed and 20 wounded. We 
captured about 20 cannon here. I noticed one complete 
battery of fine Blakely guns. 

Sixteen miles northeast of Columbia, 

February 20, 1865. 

The Provost Guards were the last to leave town. Fifty 
families of Columbians accompany us ; have no idea how 
many negroes. Hard day's march. 

Pleasant Hill, S. C, February 21, 1865. 
Fifteen miles to-day. Yesterday we traveled the Cam- 
den road. To-day we turned northwest. Poor country, 
quite rolling. Pine, scrub oak and sand. 

Page's Ferry, Wateree River, February 22, 1865. 
It seems to be certain that we have Charleston. Made 
about ten miles to-day. Our regiment and the 6th Iowa 
were sent down to an old ferry to make a demonstration. 
Found no enemy. The 2d and 3d are already across and 
we cross in the morning and take the advance. We now 
have eight days' rations which are to last 30 wish they'd 
burn them all to get rid of the wagons. 

Flat Rock P. O., February 23, 1865. 

Fifteen miles. Traveled east or northeast. Very rough, 
hilly country, hills rock topped. No enemy. Passed 
through a village called "Liberty Hill," some elegant 
houses. Forage plenty. No news and don't know any- 
thing. 



352 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

West's Cross Roads, 13 miles northeast of 
Camden, S. C, 

February 24, 1865. 

Made 14 miles a little south of east. We passed about a 
mile south of Gates' old battle ground. A dozen foragers of 
the 99th Indiana were captured to-day, but our foragers 
caught more Rebels than that, besides 50 wagons and 200 
horses and mules belonging to refugees. Stringent orders 
from Howard, Logan and Wood about stealing. It has 
rained for 24 hours. No enemy in front to-day. Got out 
of the clay hills again on sand pine flats. 

February 25, 1865. 

Have not moved to-day. Rebels captured 15 men of the 
29 Missouri to-day. Our foragers have been straggling 
for seven or eight miles in every direction; three of our 
regiment captured a refugee camp of seven men, ten guns, 
two revolvers, some pistols and 25 mules. Ordered to keep 
men well in hand this p. m., as Rebel cavalry is demon- 
strating on our front and flanks. I think it must be at a re- 
spectful distance. Rumor says Longstreet is somewhere 
around. Think we are waiting for the left of the army to get 
up with us. Our foragers have been to Camden, 13 miles ; 
pretty tall straggling. Others have been out southeast 
ii miles, and saw our 2d and 4th divisions moving on a big 
road, side by side, going east. Nobody can yet decide 
what our destination is. It is reported to-day that 13 
of our 2d division foragers were found by the roadside 
dead, with a card marked "Fate of foragers;" also four of 
the 3d division killed. Gen. J. E. Smith, commanding, 
shot four of his prisoners in retaliation. Colonel Catterson 
says as we were marching to this camp to-day he had 
pointed out to him the tree under which Baron DeKalb 
died at the battle of Camden. Have had 48 hours of rain 
with a prospect of continuance. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 353 

Fullersville, S. C, Sunday, February 26, 1865. 
Sixty hours of rain terminated at daylight this morning, but 
it has not hurt the sandy roads a particle. We made 1 1 miles 
in four and one quarter hours, and are now waiting for a 
bridge to be completed over this creek, "Lynch's." We think 
now we are on the road to Wilmington. The map shows a 
good deal of railroad to be destroyed on the way, but I think 
we will get through by the I5th of March. Expect "you uns" 
are getting anxious about "we uns" again. This is, I think, a 
much longer thing than the Savannah campaign. Our 4th 
division took 103 prisoners here last night and our 2d took 
200 more to-day. They are State Line Troops and muchly de- 
moralized. It is a fact about that murdering yesterday. Sher- 
man is out in a big retaliation order to-day. Wilmington is 
reported ours. Thunder and lightning last evening. Hear 
that the rain has raised the creek until it is three-quarters of a 
mile wide, and we won't get across to-morrow. I think I'll put 
down our principal campaigns: 

1st. Dec., 1862, The Tallahatchie River Cam- 
paign 120 miles. 

2nd. April, 1863, The Panola, Miss., 9 day's 

march 180 miles. 

3rd. July, 1863, Jackson, Miss., Campaign... 100 miles. 

4th. Oct. & Nov., '63, Memphis to Chatta- 
nooga, and in 

5th. Dec. to Maryville, Tenn., and back to 

Scottsboro, Ala 800 miles. 

6th. Jan., '64, Wills Valley Campaign 100 miles. 

/th. Feb. & March, '64, Dalton, Ga., Cam- 
paign 300 miles. 

8th. May until Sept., Atlanta Campaign 400 miles. 

9th. Oct., 1864, Atlanta to Gadsden, Ala., and 

return 300 miles. 

loth. Nov. & Dec., Atlanta to Savannah.... 300 miles. 
Jan., Feb. & March, '65, The Carolina Cam- 
paign 400 miles. 



Total 3,ooo miles. 



354 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

A captain and seven men who went foraging yesterday are 
still missing, supposed to be captured or killed. And 20 men 
of the 97th Indiana who went out this morning are reported 
all killed by a 46th Ohio man, who was wounded and left for 
dead by the Rebels. He says the 9/th boys paid for themselves 
in dead Rebels before they were overpowered. Our corps has 
now 500 prisoners, three times as many as we have lost. 

Tillersville, February 27, 1865. 

We have half a mile of bridging to build before we can get 
across this Lynch's creek, the rains have swollen it so much. 
Our 6th Iowa foragers we thought captured are all right. 
They got across this creek before the freshet and it cut them 
off. The 97th Indiana men are gone up. All of the 20 killed or 
captured but 3 ; 1 1 dead Rebels were found on their little bat- 
tle field, so the report comes from General Corse, I understand. 
The Rebels are losing, I should think, about 3 or 4 men to 
our one, but they are showing more manhood than those who 
opposed our march in Georgia. It isn't the "militia," for the 
360 prisoners our corps have taken within four days surren- 
dered without firing a shot. They were S. C. chivalry, proper. 
The men who are most active on their side, I think, belong to 
Butler's or Hampton's command from the Potomac. They are 
cavalry and don't amount to anything as far as infantry is 
concerned, but only think they venture a little closer than 
Wheeler does. (You are expected to emit a sarcastic ha! half 
and remark: "They don't know Sherman's army as well as 
Wheeler does.") They say we can't cross here until the water 
falls, and as there is an excellent prospect for more rain, we 
are thinking of building cabins in which to pass the rainy 
season. All our wounded are doing excellently. The sur- 
geons say that the wounded do much better being transported 
in ambulances than in stationary hospitals. They escape the 
foul air is the main reason. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 355 

February 28, 1865. 

High water still keeps us here. We will probably get off 
to-morrow. It is thought we will cross the Great Peedee at 
Cheraw; there is so much swamp lower down that might 
trouble us. 

A thousand rumors afloat to-day. The citizens have it that 
Grant has whipped Lee since the Hatcher Run affair. It rained 
some last night and is now 8 p. m. sprinkling again. If it 
rains hard to-night we will have to give up crossing here and 
go higher up. The i/th is across. The left wing is reported 
near Charlotte, N. C, but don't know that it is so. We have 
heard that Davis' commissioners have returned to Washington. 

We are having a time sure. They say now that we will not 
get across to-morrow. I heard some outrageous jokes to-day 
about a Golden Christ which was stolen by some of our thieves 
in Columbia, and in an inspection on the 26th it was found 
in a department headquarter's wagon. They are too wicked to 
tell. This army has done some awful stealing. Inspectors 
pounce down on the trains every day or two now and search 
them. Everything imaginable is found in the wagons. The 
stuff is given to citizens or destroyed. Our last winter cam- 
paign ends to-day. Only five and one-half months more to 
serve. 

Left Bank Lynch's Creek, March i, 1865. 
We have finally got across this deuced creek. It has de- 
layed us fully four days, more than any three rivers did before. 
Our division train is yet to cross and may not get over in 24 
hours. We are getting hungry for the first time, having for- 
aged the country out for 15 miles around. The 4th division 
started to-day on the Cheraw road. Prisoners taken to-day 
report that Wilmington was being evacuated when Schofield 
with the 23d Corps, dropped in and took the town and a 
brigade of prisoners. I wish he'd organize an expedition and 
bring us some late papers. Everybody is speculating on a 
big time with the enemy crossing the Great Pedee, but I don't 
believe they will trouble us as much as this confounded creek 
has. 

23 



356 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

New Market, S. C, March 2, 1865. 

A disagreeable, half drizzle, half sprinkle, all last night and 
to-day. Our brigade in advance and made 10 miles. Poor 
country, but pretty well settled. Many of the men have had 
no breadstuffs for three days. They drew two days of hard- 
bread February i8th, and have foraged everything else we 
have had since. Don't know when we draw again. Still have 
our 8 days of "tack" in the wagons. We will get plenty of for- 
age again to-morrow. Can hear nothing of the enemy. We 
left Darlington 20 miles on our right to-day and will prob- 
ably strike the Peedee near Society Hill. 

Five miles south of Cheraw, S. C., March 3, 1865. 

General Wood says we have made 24 miles to-day. Our 
whole corps on one road and hardly a check all day. This is 
Thompson's Creek, and the Rebels under Hardee thoroughly 
fortified it. Logan's orders are to carry the works to-morrow, 
but as usual the Rebels have left. The I7th A. C. took Cheraw 
this p. m. without a fight, getting 27 pieces of field artillery, 
3,000 stands of small arms, besides a great deal of forage. 

There were only two or three small farms on the road to- 
day. Poorest country I have seen yet. An intelligent pris- 
oner captured to-day says that Kilpatrick has taken Char- 
lotte, N. C., and that Lee is evacuating Richmond. Saw the 
sun to-day; had almost forgotten there was such a luminary. 

Cheraw, S. C., March 4, 1865. 

We were from 8 a. m. until 4 p. m. on this little five miles. 
The 1 7th have their pontoons down and have a division across. 
Hear that the enemy is fortified a short distance back from 
the river. Can hear no firing. Our foragers took Society Hill 
last night. 

This is a very pretty place, about the size of Canton. 

The river, Great Peedee, is navigable for boats drawing five 
feet. The left wing is at Chesterfield 12 miles above. There 
is an immense amount of cotton here. Noticed guards on it, 
and some think it is to be sent down the river. A thousand 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 357 

mounted men are to start from here to-morrow (from our 
corps, and it is said the same number from each corps) for 
somewhere rumor says, to release 8,000 of our prisoners 
at Florence. Our wounded men are all doing splendidly. 

March 5, 1865. 

The 1 7th and all our corps, except our division, have 
crossed the river. We follow in the morning. The enemy did 
not attempt to oppose us. The boys say that an intercepted 
dispatch from Hampton to General Butler reads: "Do not 
attempt to delay Sherman's march by destroying bridges, or 
any other means. For God's sake let him get out of the coun- 
try as quickly as possible." Were I one of the S. C. chivalry 
I'd be in favor of turning out en masse and building up roads 
for him. 

We will get out of S. C. to-morrow. I have not been in 
a house in the State occupied by a citizen. Everything in 
Cheraw of any value to the enemy, including cotton and busi- 
ness houses, is going up in smoke. Hear to-day that Schofield 
is in Goldsboro or Fayetteville, N. C. 

General Wood says we have 120 miles yet to make. You 
may give the credit of Wilmington, Charleston and Georgetown 
to whom you please, we know Sherman deserves it. We hear 
that that miserable Foster is claiming the glory over his cap- 
ture of Charleston. We are yet pretty short of breadstuffs, 
but have plenty of meat. Sherman has been heard to say that 
this army can live on fresh meat alone for 30 days. I'd like 
to see it tried on him. We think to-day that Goldsboro is our 
resting place. You must understand that we don't know any- 
thing at all about anything. Our foragers all went across the 
river this morning and got plenty of flour, meal and meat. 
They were out n miles and saw a few Rebels. The Rebels 
left seven cannon on the other side of the river, and burned 
a very large amount of commissary and ordnance stores. 



358 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Five miles northeast of Cheraw, S. C., 

March 6, 1865. 

Crossed the Peedee this morning. Just after we passed 
through the town a I2th Indiana boy seeing some powder 
scattered on the ground threw a coal on it. It communicated 
with a concealed ammunition magazine and made a fine ex- 
plosion, killed and wounded 20 or 30 men in our division, 
stampeded a lot of horses and burned some citizens. There have 
been half a dozen of such explosions. Good country here, for- 
agers get plenty, and also pick up many Rebel deserters and 
stragglers. Our foragers yesterday found two of Kilpatrick's 
men and five Rebel lieutenants all drunk and put them under 
guard. 

Goodwin's Mills, 16 miles northwest of Cheraw, 

March 7, 1865. 

About ii miles to-day and in camp at noon. The I4th and 
2Oth had come down and cross at Cheraw. We are waiting 
on them. That expedition to Florence was a failure. Our 
men got the town but were driven out before they destroyed 
a thing. I am inclined to think the officers did not do their 
whole duty. They should have succeeded or lost more blood. 
Our loss amounted to nothing. One of the best foraging days 
of the whole trip. Our foragers to-day captured some negroes 
and horses. The negroes say they were running them over 
here to get away from General "Schofield's company." We are 
about on the State line now, and will leave S. C. to-morrow. 
I think she has her "rights" now. I don't hate her any more. 

Five miles north of Laurenburg, N. C., Laurel Hill, 

March 8, 1865. 

One hundred and twelve miles of steady rain, 
and the best country since we left Central Georgia. 
Looks real Northern like. Small farms and nice 
white, tidy dwellings. Wheat fields look very well. In 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 359 

the cornfields rows are five feet apart, and one stalk the size 
of a candle, in a hill. Bvit at every house there were from 200 
to 1,000 bushels of corn and an abundance of fodder. Sherman 
said yesterday that our campaign is over, and to-day Howard 
issued an order that all foraging for provisions shall cease, 
there being enough rations in the wagons to last us through. 
I dreamed last night of being at home on leave and seeing you 
all, and starting back to the army again. Only 90 miles yet 
to mail. 

Four miles south of Montpelier, N. C, 

March 9, 1865. 

Rained nearly all last night and poured down all day. Our 
regiment had the advance of the division, but we followed 
J. E. Smith. He is the poorest traveler in the army. We 
had to corduroy all the road after him. Only made four miles. 
I never saw such a country. There seems to be a thin crust 
over a vast bed of quicksand. I saw wagons yesterday and 
to-day moving along not cutting more than two inches, all 
at once go down to the hub, and some to the wagon boxes. 
I was riding to-night on apparently high ground in the woods 
and three times the ground gave way just like rotten ice, and 
let my horse in belly deep. We have worked hard to-day. 

I 

Randallsville, N. C., March 10, 1865, 12 p. m. 
Ten miles to-day, most of which we had to corduroy. Our 
regiment in rear of the division and corps. Crossed the Lum- 
ber river about 4 p. m. Fine country. We had reveille at 3 
this morning, and the rear of train with our 1st brigade did 
not get in until an hour later. They had a hard time. Hope 
we'll get the advance to-morrow. This Lumber river is a 
spoon river, with a third of a mile of swamp on each side 
thereof. Hear to-night that Grant has taken Petersburg, and 
believe it to be bosh. Blair, with the I7th A. C., is close to 
Fayetteville, but it is said he has orders to lie still and let the 
left wing enter the town. 



360 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Davis Bridge, Rockfish Creek, March n, 1865. 
Ten miles to-day, full seven of which had to be corduroyed. 
The worst road I ever saw. The i/th corps occupied Fayette- 
ville to-day. The foragers took the place. It is as large as 
Columbia and has a large arsenal. Heard of two or three 
men being captured by the Rebels yesterday and a couple to- 
day. They also made a little dash on our rear to-day on 
the 3d division without accomplishing anything. I do wish 
you could see the crowd of negroes following us. Some say 
2,000 with our division. I think fully 1,000. 

Fayetteville, N. C., March 12, 1865. 

We are camped a couple of miles from town. Marched 
about 13 miles to-day. Had to put down pontoons at 
both branches of Rockfish creek. At the town of Rock- 
fish, the 1 7th A. C. burned a factory, throwing about 150 
women out of employment. One of our gunboats came up 
to this place to-day with dispatches for Sherman. It went 
back before our division got in and took a lot of mail. 

The I4th A. C. is garrisoning this place, but the i/th 
got in first. The 97th Indiana boys, who were captured 
back at Lynch's Creek, all got away from the enemy and 
back to us to-day, five of them. Sherman said yesterday 
that the campaign ends only with the war. Hear that 
Hampton whipped Kilpatrick splendidly. Don't think 
that is any credit to him. Also hear that Bragg whipped 
Schofield at Kingston, that Thomas has Lynchburg, and 
30,000 other rumors. In the last 23 days the commissary 
has issued only two and one half days' of bread. I lost 
my sword to-day. Left it where we stopped for dinner. 
We have lost so much sleep of late that at every halt half 
the command is asleep in a minute. I lay down and 
told them not to wake me for dinner nor until the regi- 
ment moved. - The regiment had started when Frank woke 
me, and I got on my horse too stupid to think of anything. 
Did not miss my sword for five miles, when I went back 
for it, but no use. Foragers for the last week have been 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 361 

counting on rich spoils in the town, and many of them 
have not reported to their regiments within six or eight 
days, camping every night with the extreme advance. The 
day before the place was taken, five men who were 15 miles 
ahead of the column ventured into town. They were gob- 
bled and one of them killed. Next morning 100 foragers 
hovered around town until the column was within about 
six miles, when the foragers deployed as skirmishers, and 
went for the town. 

There were about 1,000 Rebel cavalry herein who fell 
back before our boys skirmishing lively, clear through the 
town, when they suddenly charged our fellows and scooped 
them. Our loss in killed, wounded and captured is 25 or 
30. They killed several after they captured them, and one 
they hung up by the heels and cut his throat. Our boys 
retreated about a mile from town, and went in again in 
more solid order. They were too scattered the first time. 
They were successful and routed Johnny, who left six dead 
in the streets. 

March 14, 1865. 

It is supposed we will be here two or three days, to get 
some shoes up the river. 

Left bank, Cape Fear River, Opposite Fayetteville, 
\ 

March 15, 1865. 

Everything valuable to the Rebels has been destroyed, 
and we are about ready to push on to Goldsboro. Fayette- 
ville is about a 3,000 town, nearly all on one street. There 
was a very fine United States Arsenal burned here, some 20 
good buildings, all of which are "gone up." The rest of the 
town is old as the hills. We lay on the river bank expect- 
ing to cross all last night, and finally reached the bivouac 
three quarters of a mile from the river just as the troops 
on this side were sounding the reveille. This is the 2ist 
river we have pontooned since leaving Scottsboro, May 



362 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

ist, '64. It is more like the Tennessee than any other 
stream we have crossed. We send from here all the negroes 
and white refugees who have been following us, also a large 
train to Wilmington for supplies. The number of negroes 
is estimated at 15,000. Nearly all the population of this 
town will go inside our lines. It has rained all day and 
seems abominably gloomy. Makes me wish for letters 
from home. Last night while we were standing around 
fires by the river, some scoundrel went up to a negro not 
75 yards from us, and with one whack of a bowie knife, 
cut the contraband's head one third off, killing him. 

At Goldsboro, we are promised a short rest. If it were 
not that the wagons are so nearly worn out that they must 
be thoroughly repaired, I don't believe we would get it. 
Well, time passes more swiftly in campaigning than in 
camp. Most of the army are moved out. 

i 

Two miles from left bank of Black River, N. C, 

March 16, 1865. 

About 14 miles to-day. About a dozen swamps, as many 
showers, three hard rains, and an awfully rough march. 
The men waded, I should think altogether, one-half mile 
of water from ankle to waist deep. They went through 
every swamp yelling like Indians. Rained all yesterday 
and last night. I saw peach and thorn blossoms, some 
wintergreen and arbor vitae growing wild. Two days like 
this would demoralize a citizen much. We drew three 
days' hard bread to-day to last five. In the 26 preceding 
our division drew besides sugar and coffee, only two and 
one-half days' of hard bread. Very poor country to-day. 
The boats brought us some late papers. 

The latest account of Sheridan .capturing Early. Don't 
believe it. Saw Herald's account of the inauguration. The 
writer should be shot. Of half a dozen boats that come to 
Fayetteville, only two brought cargoes, and both of them oats. 
Ridiculous, 40,000 pair of shoes would have been sensible. 
Many of the men are barefoot. Sherman and Hampton are 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 363 

having a spicy correspondence on murdering foragers. Think 
Hampton is a little ahead at this date. Have only seen the 
first letter on each side. There is talk of a fight at Golds- 
boro. I do hope this army will get two weeks in camp before 
it battles. It is a little too loose now for heavy, steady work. 
General Wood says that Sheridan with four divisions of cav- 
alry is coming through to join us. 

Beaman's Cross Roads, March 17, 1865. 
About 12 miles, more than half of which had to be cordu- 
royed. Roads awful. If a wagon pulls off the corduroy, it 
drops to the hub. There are two or three inches of black 
sand on the surface covering quicksand unfathomable. No 
one need tell me that bad roads will stop an army. The 2Oth 
corps had sharp little affair yesterday. Hear their loss i? 
over 400. Everyone is expecting a fight before we reac) 
Goldsboro. The whole corps is camped together to-night 
Our division has been in rear of the corps two days and has 
not had a fight in the advance since we left Columbia. I 
believe I have not heard a hostile shot for 27 days. Howard 
is here to-night. Whole corps is on this road. 

Four miles north from Smithfield's, N. C., 

March 18, 1865. 

Fifteen miles, good roads, men only waded in swamps. 
Whole corps in camp before dark. Well settled country and 
oceans of forage. Our foragers and the 7th Illinois "mounted 
thieves" had a nice little fight to-day. Came near scaring 
Wade Hampton's chivalry out of their boots; four dead 
Yanks, and n Rebels is said to be the result. Our fellows 
run them off to the left of our road into the I4th and 20. 
who hurried their march a little. We are 27 miles from 
Goldsboro and 18 from Faisons on the railroad, which 
point we will probably make to-morrow and possibly get our 
mail. If I don't get at least six letters from you I will be 
much disappointed. We are much amused over the Rebel 



364 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

papers we get. All seem to take "gobs" of comfort from 
Lee's declaration that "Tecumseh" can and must be whipped. 
Several of them assert that our treatment of citizens is good. 
Don't believe a word of it, though I wish it were so. 
Twelve miles from Goldsboro, and six from railroad, 

March 19, 1865. 

Made 15 miles. Only two bad swamps. Very heavy artil- 
lery and musketry on our left (i4th and 2oth Corps) all day. 
Hear this evening that our men suffered heavily. General Lee 
is said to be here. Opinion is divided as to our having a battle 
to-morrow. First rate country to-day and a good abundance 
of forage. The farmers here have not many negroes. Rebel 
cavalry demonstrated on our left to-day, quite lively and cap- 
tured several foragers. Five foragers from our regiment who 
had been out five days and whom we had about given up, re- 
turned to-night. They have been with the i/th A. C. All 
quiet on our right. 

One and one-half miles from Neuse River, 

March 20, 1865. 

We moved about a mile north and then west for five miles. 
Pushed some Rebel cavalry before us all the time. Our 
brigade was in advance and lost about 25 men. We are 
about two miles east of where the battle was fought yester- 
day by the I4th and 2Oth corps, and right where the Rebel 
hospital was. The Rebels are now due west of us, our 
line running north and south, and I think there can be no 
difficulty in communicating with Schofield. Goldsboro is 
undoubtedly evacuated. In the fight yesterday one divi- 
sion of the I4th was worsted at first and driven some 
distance, but rallied, repulsed the enemy, and the corps 
getting into line, charged four to six times, and slaughtered 
the Rebels awfully. Their loss was far greater than ours. 

Ten p. m. A Pennsylvania man, who was wounded in the 
fight yesterday, and carried in by the Rebels who took off 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 365 

his leg above the ankle, came in to us a few minutes ago. 
He crawled nearly half a mile, part of the way through 
a swamp. It seems that the Rebels had a hospital there 
they evacuated and left him and a half dozen other 
wounded, two of whom the man saw killed by the skirmish 
firing. We are on the skirmish line to-night. I suppose 
it is 400 yards to the Rebel skirmishers, and not a very 
dangerous line. 

March 21, 1865. 

We moved out this morning just before daylight and 
got within 50 yards of the Rebel skirmish line, but nothing 
going forward on our right or left, we returned to our 
original position. Had one man in Company H slightly 
wounded. We could have held our advanced line just as 
well as not. I think our right must rest on the river. 
Some 35,000 or 40,000 Rebels are reported here under John- 
ston.. Some prisoners report Lee. I would like to see 
them whaled, but would like to wait until we refit. You 
see that too much of a good thing gets old, and one don't 
enjoy even campaigning after 50 or 60 days of it together. 
I believe I am surfeited with oven bread ("death balls" 
our cook calls them), biscuit, and pork. I feel finely; wet 
from head to foot, has rained since noon hard most of the 
time. About I p. m. the main line moved out on our 
skirmish line, and as quick as they get their works up 
(about one-half hour), our regiment deployed as skirm- 
ishers on our brigade front, and our whole corps skirmish 
line moved forward. I think the I7th drove the enemy 
on our right at the same time. We took their skirmish 
pits along the whole front of our division, but they were 
very close to their main line and we did have a very in- 
teresting time holding them, I assure you. I don't think 
it was more than 75 yards to the main line of the Rebel 
works, and they in plain sight, only a straggling scrub oak 
undergrowth and a few large pines intervening. The Rebels 
came out of their works twice to retake their pits. 



366 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

The first time the left of our regiment had to fall back, 
the brigade on our left giving way and exposing our flank, 
but we all rallied in a minute and made the Johnnies fairly 
fly back. The next time our brigade again broke, but our 
men held their pits, and the 26th Illinois, which was just 
coming out to relieve our regiment, faced its left wing 
for the pits occupied by the enemy, and went for them with 
a first-class yell. You should have seen the Rebels run. 
It did me a power of good. The other brigade then came 
back to their position, the 26th relieved me, and we are 
now ready for bed. We have been wonderfully fortunate 
to-day, only 10 wounded and none killed. The pride of the 
regiment, Frank Lermond, had his arm broken by a ball, 
but a resection operation will leave him a tolerably good 
arm. I think this has been as exciting and lively a p. m. 
as ever I saw. Terry's 24th Army Corps has come up, 
and lays about six miles back of us to-night. 

Bentonville, N. C., March 22, 1865. 

The enemy left about 2 a. m. Our brigade was ordered 
to follow them to Mill creek, about three miles, which we 
did almost on the double quick, the 26th Illinois in ad- 
vance pushing their rear guard. The brigade went to 
Mill creek, but our skirmishers went a mile further, to 
Hannah's creek. The 26th had seven wounded. I saw 
in one place a dead Rebel and one of our men burned 
horribly. The woods have all been burned over here. In 
another place a dead Rebel and one of our men with his 
foot cut half off, one of his toes cut off, several more cuts 
on his body, and a bullet hole in his temple. Some of the 
boys saw one of our men with leg cut off in five places. 
Some surgeon had probably been practicing on the last 
two men. 

They were I4th Corps men. Sherman again says the 
campaign is over, that he only came out here to show 
Johnston that he is ready to fight all the time. We start 
back for Goldsboro (24 miles), to-morrow. Hurrah for 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 367 

mail and clean clothes. Colonel and I occupy the outside 
of a house to-night, in the inside of which is a Chinese-eyed 
girl with a Creole mouth. She is as intelligent as a door 
post. You don't know how anxious I am to hear from you. 
I have had a reply to but one letter that I have written 
since last November (i5th). Our little supper is now 
ready. Don't see how we will get along without Frank. 

Goldsboro, N. C, March 25, 1865. 

We were two days coming back from Bentonville. Have a 
nice camp ground and will enjoy ourselves, I think. Town 
don't amount to anything. 

On picket, Raleigh road, three miles from Nahanta Station, on 
Weldon and Goldsboro Railroad, 

April 10, 1865. 

Our division moved north to-day along the Weldon rail- 
road to Nahanta, where we crossed and took a main Raleigh 
road. Our 1st brigade had the advance and had light skirm- 
ishing all day. Wheeler's cavalry is opposing us. Our regi- 
ment is on picket to-night, and the enemy shot a little at us 
before dark, but all is quiet just now. Passed through a very 
fine country to-day. It has rained all day. Some cannonad- 
ing on our left. I think the whole army moved to-day. The 
2Oth corps passed us near town this morning in exactly op- 
posite direction to ours. The whole army, mules, wagons, bum- 
mers and generals have come out new from Goldsboro. The 
whole machine looks as nicely as an army can look. Our ist 
brigade took a swamp crossing from the enemy to-day, that 
our brigade could hold against a corps. A bullet passed mis- 
erably near to me as I was arranging our picket line this 
evening. 

Beulah, N. C., April n, 1865, 12 m. 

Our division is alone on this road I find, and the extreme 
right of the army. Our brigade ahead to-day. DibbrelFs di 
vision of Wheeler's men is ahead of us. We pushed them so 



368 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

closely that we saved all the bridges to this place. They de- 
stroyed the bridge here some way without burning it. Country 
to-day nearly all under cultivation, but no large farms. I 
reckon that the larger a farm a man has of this kind of land 
or sand the poorer he is. Our eyes were rested by seeing a 
little clay hill and a stony field, signs that we are again getting 
out of the coast flats. There was a house on our picket line 
last night with six women in it who were sights. They were 
the regular "clay-eaters." This Rebel cavalry ahead don't 
amount to a cent. They have not yet hurt a man on our road, 
and we don't know that more than two of them have been 
hit. They keep shooting all the time, but are afraid to 
wait until we get within range of them. They have not hind- 
ered our march a minute. Got me a new servant (a free boy) 
to-day. Both his grandmas were white women. He says the 
Rebel cavalry have been impressing all the able-bodied ne- 
groes for the army until within a few days. He understands 
they quit it because they found out in Richmond that they 
couldn't make "Cuffie" come up to the work. 

Eight miles North of Smithfield, 4:30 p. m. 
Crossed the river as quick as the bridge could be built and 
moved out three miles. The rest of our corps crossed two 
and one-half miles below. Country is quite rolling here. I 
hear that Johnston has left Smithfield, going towards Raleigh. 
Miserable set of citizens through here. 

April 12, 1865, 10 a. m. 

We hear this a. m. that Lee has surrendered to Grant the 
army of northern Virginia. It created a great deal of enthu- 
siasm among us. It is hard to make our men believe any- 
thing, but Logan told us half an hour ago as he passed it is 
true as gospel. We have passed a large infantry camp that the 
Rebels left yesterday. Johnston is moving towards Raleigh. 
Our division has the advance to-day. We consolidated the 
regiment for the campaign into five companies. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 369 

Left bank of Neuse River, 20 miles East of Raleigh, 

April 12, 1865, 4 p. m. 

Twelve miles to-day. Our cavalry pushed ahead and drove 
the Rebels past here at 8 a. m. Saw a barn and cotton press 
in flames to-day. There has been no burning this trip worth 
mentioning. This to-day was all I have seen and it was to 
destroy the cotton. Poor country to-day, but one very nice 
country place ; the house 4th rate, but the grounds and shrub- 
bery finer than any in our part of Illinois. 

This is an army of skeptics, they won't believe in Lee's sur- 
render. I do, and I tell you it makes this one of my brightest 
days. His surrender makes sure beyond any chance that what 
we have been fighting for for four years is sure. Look for 
me July 4th, 1865. [This promise was kept. Ed.] 

Four miles from Raleigh, April 13, 1865, 4 p. m. 
The fourth anniversary of the fall of Fort Sumter. How 
are you, chivalry? Made a nice little march of 16 miles and 
could go on to town as well as not before dark if it was ne- 
cessary. Our left wing occupied Raleigh this morning with 
Kilpatrick and the I4th A. C. No fighting worth mentioning. 
We crossed the Neuse six miles from Raleigh on the paper 
mill bridge. This is the prettiest campaign we ever made. No 
night marching, 60 miles in four days, and just what rations 
we started with from Goldsboro in haversacks. Beautiful 
country to-day, high and rolling. The bummers found whisky 
to-day and I saw a number dead drunk by the roadside. They 
found an ice house and to-night we have ice water. Picked 
up a number of Rebel deserters to-day. The woods are full 
of them. 

Raleigh, N. C., April 14, 1865, I p. m. 
We passed through town and were reviewed by Sherman, 
who stood at the south gate of the State Capitol grounds. 
Just as Colonel Wright saluted, his horse turned his heels to- 
wards Sherman and did some of the finest kicking that ever 



37 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

was seen. It was most amusing. Raleigh is a fine old town. 
Many beautiful residences, and the gardens filled with the 
choicest shrubbery. 

The 1 4th A. C. guards the place. Wheeler's men sacked it. 
Division hearquarters received orders to save their rations. 
What we have is to last 30 days and maybe 40 days. That 
means a long march, though it is hinted that we do not follow 
Johnston. Some think we are going into East Tennessee. 
The citizens of Raleigh generally come to their gates to look 
at us, but make no demonstrations that I have heard of. The 
I4th A. C. is protecting them in all their rights. Not a thing 
disturbed. 

High rolling country and large farms. The town is fortified 
all around, but works were old. I never saw so few negroes 
in a Southern city. Our headquarter's foragers brought in 
five Rebel deserters to-night, and five dozen eggs which I 
think were the most valuable. 

Raleigh, April 15, 1865. 

To-day makes four years soldiering for me. It is a terrible 
waste of time for me who have to make a start in life yet, and 
I expect unfits me for civil life. I have almost a dread of 
being a citizen, of trying to be sharp, and trying to make 
money. I don't think I dread the work. I don't remember 
of shirking any work I ever attempted, but I am sure that 
civil life will go sorely against the grain for a time. Citizens 
are not like soldiers, and I like soldier ways much the best. 
We were to have moved out this morning but did not. Logan 
went out with our 4th division, report says, to confer with 
Johnston. Big rumors going that our campaign is over, and 
that Johnston's men are going home. We have been having 
heavy showers during the day, but the boys feel so good over 
the prospect ahead that they raise the most tremendous cheers 
right in the midst of the hardest rains. We think Johnston 
is in as tight a place as Lee was, and if he don't surrender we 
will go for him in a way that will astonish him. We con- 
sider our cause gained and are searching each other's records 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 3/1 

to see who was ever doubtful of success. I don't remember 
at any time of being despondent over the war or being doubt- 
ful of the issue. Was I ? I did think the war might last for 
years yet, but take that back. I have not been in town since 
we came through, and think no one from the Brigade has. 
Curiosity over captured cities is "old." 

Raleigh, April 16, 1865. 

Flags of truce are still flying between Sherman and John- 
ston. The latter is, I believe, some 30 miles west of Hillsboro. 
Some of Sherman's staff went out last night to offer the same 
terms that were offered to Lee, and are expected every hour 
with Johnston's answer. Everybody thinks Johnston will ac- 
cept and many are offering to bet their all that we will be 
mustered out by July 4th, 1865. 

I am trying to take the matter coolly and determined not to 
be very much disappointed if the result is different from what 
we all hope. We will be either ready to march to-morrow 
morning or to hang our swords on the wall. Hundreds of 
Johnston's men are coming into our lines. If he don't surren- 
der his men will all desert. A lovely day. Disposes one to 
peace wonderfully. It is most difficult to realize that our war 
is over. I do from my heart thank God that I have lived to 
see the rebellion put down. Anyone who has been with us 
the last year and is alive should be thankful. The whole four 
years seems to me more like a dream than reality. How 
anxious I am to shake hands with you all once more. "How 
are you peace?" 

Raleigh, April 17, 1865. 

We have a brief dispatch this morning informing us of the 
assassination of President Lincoln, Secretary Seward and son. 
I have not the heart to write a word about it. The army is 
crazy for vengenance. If we make another campaign it will 
be an awful one. Sherman meets Johnston to-day. The delay 
in the negotiations was caused by some dispatches being 
missed. We hope Johnston will not surrender. God pity 
this country if he retreats or fights us.

3/2 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Raleigh, April 18, 1865. 

Sherman has gone out again to see Johnston. Johnston 
asked for another day in order to see Davis and get his per- 
mission to surrender the whole force in arms this side of the 
Mississippi. I was through the town to-day. Some very fine 
residences and asylums, but the town is no larger than Canton, 
and not as pretty except in shrubbery and shade trees. 

I visited the Deaf and Dumb and Blind Asylums and the 
superintendent put a class in each through some exercises. It 
was very interesting. A Herald of the loth gives us the par- 
ticulars of Lee's surrender. Grant is the hero of the war. 
The papers all talk about Grant, Sherman and Sheridan, noth- 
ing said about Thomas. This whole army thinks that 
Thomas is slighted by the North. We have as much con- 
fidence in him as in Grant or Sherman, and then he never 
writes any letters or accepts valuable presents, or figures 
in any way for citizen approbation, or that of his army. 
The only objection that I ever heard against him is the 
size of his headquarters or "Thomasville" as it is called 
by the army. That comes from his West-Pointism. 

Raleigh, April 19, 1865. 

Joe Johnston surrendered the whole thing yesterday to 
Sherman. Our 4th division and a division of the iyth 
Corps receive the arms, etc. We go into a regular camp to- 
morrow to await developments. If any more Confederacy 
crops out, we, I suppose, will go for it, otherwise in a 
couple of months we'll muster out. That's all. Good bye, 
war. 

Our last march. Near Rolesville, N. C., 

April 29, 1865. 

Left Raleigh at 7 this morning on my way home, via 
Richmond and Washington. Made about n miles. 
Rather too warm for such fast marching as we always do. 
If we would just make 15 miles a day, say 10 of it between 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 373 

sunrise and 10 a. m., and the remainder after 2 p. m., it 
would not hurt a man or an animal, but we move when we 
do move at three or three and a half miles an hour, and not 
all even Sherman's men can stand it in as warm weather 
as this. I saw a number laid out this morning by the road- 
side looking as if they had been boiled. The 50 pounds of 
equipments is what uses them up. Well settled country, 
and it looks beautiful. The leaves are all out nearly full 
size ; fine oak, elm and pine strips of woodland between 
farms is such an addition of comfort to citizens and cattle, 
and of beauty to scenery. The undergrowth is mostly dog- 
wood and holly. We are on our good behavior this trip. 
No foraging, no bumming rails, or houses, and nothing 
naughty whatever. We have the best set of men in the 

world. When it is in order to raise h they have no equals 

in destructiveness and ability to hate and worry, or su- 
periors as to fighting Rebels, but now they have none, 
and they are perfect lambs. Not a hand laid on a rail this 
evening with intent to burn, not a motion toward a 
chicken or smoke-house, not a thing in their actions that 
even a Havelock would object to. They don't pretend to 
love our "erring brethren" yet, but no conquered foe could 
ask kinder treatment than all our men seem disposed to 
give these Rebels. We camped about 3 p. m. in a pretty 
piece of woods. Artillery has been booming all day at 
Raleigh. 

Sunday, April 30, 1865. 

Howardism (and it is a very good kind of ism), allows 
us to lay still to-day. It is a real Canton ist of June Sab- 
bath. It rained all night, but the effect is to improve these 
sandy roads. It will take a good deal more than a week 
to realize fully that the war is over. No more preparation 
for a coming campaign, dreaded at first, but soon looked 
for with feverish eagerness (human nature). No more 
finding the enemy driving in his skirmishers, developing 
his line, getting into position, and retiring every night, 



374 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

maybe for a month, after days spent in continuous skirm- 
ishing, expecting to be ordered to charge at daybreak. It 
is all over, thank God, but it seems impossible. 

A Philadelphia paper of the 25th (first we have seen 
since the 2ist) astonished us all. It gives us our first inti- 
mation of the hue and cry against Sherman, for the terms 
he offered Johnston, Breckenridge & Co. We did not 
before know anything he had done, only he told us in 
orders that he had, "subject to the approval of the powers 
at Washington, made peace from the Rio Grande to the 
Potomac, by an agreement with Johnston and other 
high officials." We have only known that much, talked 
over the matter and were afraid that "Tecumseh" had 
made an attempt to do too much, and had compromised 
himself by having anything at all to do with other than 
military Rebels. I am very sorry for him, but we have 
thought for a year, and it has been common talk in the 
army, that he was ambitious for political honors, etc. 

I have often heard it said that he was figuring for popu- 
larity in the South. He has written some very pretty let- 
ters to our erring Southerners. Instance, the one to the 
Mayor and citizens of Atlanta and one to Mrs. Bowen of 
Baltimore, and several more while at Savannah. 

He also promised Governor Vance some kind of pro- 
tection if he would return to Raleigh. "Pap" must be care- 
ful. We all think the world of him. I'd rather fight under 
him than Grant, and in fact if Sherman was Mahomet we'd 
be as devoted Musselmen as ever followed the former 
prophet, and if he has blundered here, as they say he has, 
we will feel it more at heart than we ever did the fall of 
our leaders before. I won't believe he has made a mis- 
take until I know all about it. It can't be. 

Near Davis' Cross Roads, five miles north of Tar river. 

May i, 1865, 4:30 p. m. 

We are 35 miles from Raleigh to-night, which makes 24 
miles to-day over Tar river, which is here about 50 yards 
wide and runs through a fine rolling, high country. The 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 375 

march was splendidly conducted, no straggling, and the peace 
orders were faithfully lived up to. It seems like the early 
days of my soldiering to see the citizens all at home, their 
horses and mules in the stables, and gardens full of vegetables 
passed untouched. When a man can pass an onion bed with- 
out going for them, and they did a number of them to-day, no 
one need talk to me of total depravity. The soldier goes 
more on onions than any other luxury. The citizens have all 
"war's over" news, and seem to feel good over it. At three 
different places there were groups of very healthy looking 
young ladies, well dressed, by the roadside, waving their hand- 
kerchiefs at us, and one told the boys she wished them to come 
back after they were mustered out, for "you have killed all our 
young men off." The virtuous indignation welled up in my 
bosom like a new strike of oil. I'll venture that these same 
women coaxed their beaux off to the war, and now that 
"Yank" is ahead, they shake their handkerchiefs at us and 
cry, "bully Yanks." The devil take them and he'll be sure 
to do it. You have heard of woodticks? The man who don't 
catch his pint a day is in awful luck. They have a tick pick- 
ing twice a day in this country, regularly as eating. Saw a 
wild turnip in bloom to-day. 

Two miles north of Shady Grove, N. C., 

May 2, 1865. 

Twenty-six miles to-day, and everything in camp at sun- 
set. That is No. i work with 300 sets of wheels to the divi- 
sion. We have reveille at 3 a. m. and start at 4 now. 

We seem to have got pretty well out of the pine country. 
Hardly saw one the last three miles this p. m. Have also 
about left cotton behind us. Tobacco and wheat are the 
staples here. I saw as many as five large tobacco houses on 
one farm, built 25 logs high. Notice also some very fine wheat 
growing, now 12 inches high. Very large peach and apple 
orchards on almost every farm. The trees look thrifty, but 
show neglect. All kinds of fruit promises to be abundant this 
year. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

The last five miles to-day was through beautiful country, 
fine houses, too. The people were all out to see us, but I am 
glad that I have no demonstration a la white handkerchief to 
chronicle. The men are full of the de'il to-day. Scaring 
negroes almost out of their wits. Our division is the right of 
the army. We have been side tracking so far, but to-morrow 
we get the main road and Corse takes the cow paths. I think 
that not more than one-fifth of the cleared land so far in this 
State is under cultivation this year, and that fully one-fourth 
of all has been turned over to nature for refertilization from 
four to forty years. On some of this turned out land the new 
growth is more than a foot in diameter. I saw a sassafras 
tree to-day that was 15 inches in diameter. 

Right Bank Roanoke river, Robbin's Ferry, N. C. 

May 3, 1865. 

About 20 miles to-day and the latter fourth quite dusty. 
We did not get the main road, and have depended mainly on 
hog paths. The Roanoke is the largest stream we have crossed 
since leaving the Tennessee river, and is quite swift. The 
water is also colder than any we have found this march. We 
have not pontoons enough to reach across and will have to 
press ferryboats and skiffs, etc., to use as pontoons. Presume 
it will take all night to get up a bridge. We pontooned the 
Neuse when we crossed it the last time in one and one-half 
hours. As we crossed the Raleigh and Gorton Railroad to- 
day, saw a train of cars coming kiting along. Expect corn- 
munication is open to Raleigh by this time. We are march- 
ing too hard. It is using up lots of men. Good country to- 
day. Many fine houses and every indication of wealth. 

Thirteen miles south of Laurenceville, Va., 

May 4, 1865. 

Our regiment in advance of the division crossed the Ro- 
anoke at 3 :3O p. m. and went into camp here at sunset, mak- 
ing 13 miles. We crossed the N. C. and Va. line about three 
miles this side of the river. Good country, and people all out 
gazing. 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 377 

Near Nottaway River, May 5, 1865. 

Crossed the Meherrin river (a Copperas creek affair) this 
morning and pass through Laurenceburg, a loo-year old town, 
just as large as the top of a very small hill would hold. Such 
oceans of negroes; never saw half as many before in the 
same distance in Virginia. Sheridan was through this country 
ten days ago, but hearing that Johnston had surrendered he 
turned back. Kautz and Wilson were also raiding last sum- 
mer, but there are no signs that war is known to the people by 
experience. We see Lee's and Johnston's men all along the 
road, taking a look at Sherman's army. All the soldiers and 
citizens we see seem to submit to the Government, and the 
war feeling is dead among them, but there is no love for us 
or ours, and they regard us only as subjugators. That is as 
warm a sentiment as I ask from them. I believe every family 
has lost a member by the war. I saw a member of Pickett's 
Rebel division this evening. He said that when his division 
surrendered to Grant, they stacked but 45 muskets. It was 
nearly 10,000 strong on the 24th of March, 1865. 

This boy put in one of the 45 muskets. They all give 
Sheridan's cavalry the credit for doing the best fighting they 
ever knew "Yanks" to do. 

They all speak highly of our 6th (Wright's) corps. The 
good conduct of our men continues even to the astonishment 
of the men themselves. I have heard of but one indiscretion, 
and that was only the carrying off of the table cutlery after 
dining with a citizen. We are traveling too fast, but our 
corps commanders are racing to see who will make Petersburg 
first. Heard of Booth being killed to-day. Also got a Herald 
of the 24th with Sherman and Johnston's peace propositions. 
We are very much shocked at Sherman's course. I have not 
heard an officer or soldier who had read them, sustain our 
general. It is hard on us and we regret his action as much as 
any calamity of the war, excepting the Washington horror. 
There isn't an element of man worship in this army, but we 
all had such confidence in Sherman, and thought it almost im- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

possible for him to make a mistake. The army is very sore 
over the affair. We can't bear to have anybody say a word 
against Sherman, but he did act very strangely in this 
thing. 

Left bank of Stony Creek, Va., 20 miles from 
Pittsburg, 

May 6, 1865. 

About 20 good miles to-day. No sign of war yet. Have 
not had a very good road to-day. Crossed the Nottaway 
river this morning. Small affair. During Kautz and Wilson's 
disastrous raid last summer they threw their last piece of 
artillery into the Nottaway from the bridge on which we 
crossed. One of the officers says he noticed bullet marks 
on trees that indicated a pretty sharp skirmish having 
taken place where we stopped for dinner. We are fairly 
on classic ground. I hear that the i/th A. C. lost a number 
of men yesterday by a bridge falling. 

Petersburg, Va., May 7, 1865. 

Twenty miles to-day, and the longest kind of miles. Had 
some bad road in the morning. We struck the Weldon rail- 
road two or three miles below Ream's Station, where the 
6th Corps was whipped last June, and came right up to 
the city. Saw hardly any signs of fighting the whole way. 
Ours and the Rebel works where we came through are 
fully two and one half miles apart, and the skirmish line 
further from each other than we ever had ours when we 
pretended to be near the enemy. I think the whole army 
is up. Part of it got here last night. We lie here to- 
morrow. The I7th A. C. goes on to Richmond. 

Petersburg, Va., May 8, 1865. 

I'll take back all I ever said against the Potomac Army. 
I have been down to Fort Steadman to-day and troops who 
will work up to an enemy as they did there, will do any- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 379 

thing if handled right. There were some sad sights along 
that part of the line. Right in front of Steadman 40 or 
50 of our men are lying with only a few shovelfuls of dirt 
thrown over them, their heads and feet exposed. I passed 
through the Rebel burying ground, quite a large and 
thickly settled village. Poor fellows. I wish the leaders 
who led or rather pushed them into these little clay hills 
were all beside them. This is a nice town, not very pretty 
though. Good deal of business done. Hundreds of Rebel 
officers, Lieutenant General Gordon among them, walk the 
streets in full uniform. 

Drury's Bluff, Va., May 9, 1865. 

We were reviewed by Howard, Logan and Hartsuff this 
morning as we passed through Petersburg. We lie to- 
night along the outer line of Drury's Bluff defenses which 
Butler took a year ago this month. Signs of a good deal 
of fighting; good many roads, etc. The James river is 
about one mile to our right. I have been to some very 
fine forts. Fort Wagner and Fort Stevens (or Stephens) 
are the best, on the second and main line of Rebel works, 
which Butler was working against when the Rebels came 
out and whipped him. From one fort I saw the spires 
of Richmond, James river and Shipping, Fort Darling and 
Fort Harrison. Coming back toward camp we found one 
of our soldiers unburied in the bushes. His skull was 
brought in by our hospital steward. 

Manchester, Va., May 10, 1865. 

The rain yesterday made the road, which is a splendid 
one fifty yards wide, just right for traveling. We passed 
through three lines of Drury's Bluff and Fort Darling 
defenses, and are now at the second and inside line of 
works for the defense of Richmond. Hostile Yankees 
never saw either of these two lines at this point, or any 
other, I guess, this side of the James River. It is about 



380 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

22 miles from Richmond to Petersburg. "Old Brains" 
(Halleck) issued his proclamation that no soldier or officer 
of this army should enter Richmond only when we pass 
through. Howard and Logan say they will pass around if 
they can. I hope they will. 

We have a fine view of Richmond from here. It is situated 
much like Peoria and Columbia, S. C. The burned district shows 
very plainly from here and makes the resemblance to Columbia 
very striking. Several thousand men and officers of the corps 
made a raid on Logan last night and got a little talk from him. 
He was very careful not to say too much, all small talk. This 
got up a real elephant hunting mania, and I guess every regi- 
ment commanded in the corps was called out. Colonel Wright 
had to make a little talk. The I4th and 2Oth move out to- 
morrow. 

May n, 1865. 

The 1 4th and 2oth crossed the river and went as far as Han- 
over to-day. 

May 12, 1865. 

The 1 7th Corps has the road to-day. Heavy thunder storm 
last night with a great deal of rain. Four men of our division 
were killed by lightning about 200 yards from our tent. One 
of them, William Hall, belonged to Company D of our regi- 
ment. Two men were killed in a tent in which were 15, and 
of the four lying side by side, two were killed. 

Can't hear yet for certain when we will be mustered out. 
We move towards Alexandria to-morrow. 

North Bank of Chickahominy River, 

May 13, 1865. 

We crossed the James river this a. m. Our division, the 
rear of the corps, paraded a little around Richmond, saw Libby 
Prison, Castle Thunder, the bronze statue of Washington, 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 381 

Lee's and Davis' residence, and a number of women. Some 
handkerchiefs flying. Two women told us they were Yankees 
and looked so sweet that I (in theory) lifted my hat to them. 
It always puts me out of humor to see Southern women cheer 
Yanks in public. We passed through the Rebel works where 
Kilpatrick made his bold dash in March, '64. We are six or 
seven miles above Mechanicsville, and McClellan's old battle 
ground. 

Near Hanover, C. H., Va., May 14, 1865. 
Only made nine miles to-day on account of the Pamunky 
river here being bad. We camp to-night in the Hanover 
"slashes," one mile east of the birthplace of Henry Clay, and 
about two miles from the residence of Patrick Henry. The 
court house is where the latter delivered his famous speech 
against the clergy. Henry's house is built of brick, imported, 
and was built in 1776. We passed the place where McClellan's 
famous seven days' fight commenced. The whole country is 
waste. I hear a country legend here that Clay was the ille- 
gitimate son of Patrick Henry. The court house was built in 
1735- 

South of Bowling Green, Va., May 15, 1865. 

Crossed the Pamunky river this morning and the Mattapony 
this p. m. Beautiful country, but most desolate looking. 
Stopped at a house for the "cute and original" purpose of ask- 
ing for a drink of water. While a servant went to the spring 
had a very interesting chat with the ladies, the first of the sex 
I have spoken to in Virginia. One of them was quite pleasant. 
She inquired if we Yankees were really all going to Mexico. 
Told her "such was the case," when she remarked, "Well, all 
our men are killed off, and if all you Northerners go to Mex- 
ico, we women will have our rights sure." 

Heard of Davis' capture. Did not excite an emotion. 



382 ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 

Five miles south of Fredericksburg, May 16, 1865. 
Our division and brigade in advance of corps to-day. Made 
24 miles by 2 p. m. Fences all gone on the road, but houses all 
standing. From a bluff three miles back had a beautiful view 
of about 15 miles of the Rappahannock valley and in all that 
did not see a fence-or a cultivated field, or a specimen of either 
the kine, sheep, or swine families. This certainly does not 
largely rank the Sahara. Passed through a melancholy look- 
ing line of rifle pits, and mentally thanked Heaven for my poor 
prospect of ever using the like again. Passed through Bowl- 
ing Green this a. m., only n miles from where Booth was 
killed. 

Aquia Creek, Va., May 17, 1865. 

We passed over the whole line of Burnside's battle ground 
this morning. (It was no fight, only a Yankee slaughter.) 
Through Fredericksburg, the most shelled town I ever saw; 
crossed the Rappahannock on a miserable shaky pontoon, and 
have been traveling ever since in the camps of the Potomac 
Army. Desolation reigns equal to the Sodom and Gomorrah 
country. 

Country much more broken than I supposed; very hot 
part of the day. One man of the 48th Illinois fell dead while 
marching, and eight or ten in our regiment badly affected by 
heat. 

Occoquan Creek, May 18, 1865. 

Another day's march. Heavy rain and thunder storm com- 
menced ten minutes before our wagons got in, and then the 
wind blew so hard that we could not get our tent up for an 
hour, and everybody got thoroughly soaked. 

Near Alexandria, Va., May 19, 1865. 

Rained all night. Reveille at 2 p. m., and started off before 
daylight. Men waded two or three creeks to their middles. 
.March miserably conducted. Passed the church that Wash- 



ARMY LIFE OF AN ILLINOIS SOLDIER. 383 

ington attended, built in 1783. It has nearly all, except roof 
and walls, been carried away by relic maniacs. Our division 
marched through Mt. Vernon by the vault and residence. 

Thus closes this diary of one of the most memorable year's 
campaigns in the history of modern times. 

We remained in camp between Alexandria and Arlington 
until the 23d, when we crossed the Potomac river, of which 
we had heard so much, and the next day (the 24th), parti- 
cipated in the Grand Review of the Grandest Army that ever 
was created.
