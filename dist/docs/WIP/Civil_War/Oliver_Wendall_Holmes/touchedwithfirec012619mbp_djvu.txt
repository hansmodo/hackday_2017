PREFACE 



THIS PREFACE would not be an appropriate place for an 
examination of the influence which the Civil War had 
upon the thought and attitude of Mr. Justice Holmes. 
Much, if not all, of the contemporaneous meaning which 
the War had for him is indicated in the letters to his 
parents and in the diary of his last two months of mili- 
tary service. The contemporaneous meaning, however, 
is not the only significant meaning and it may well be 
that of the two wars, the war in fact and the war in 
retrospect, it was the latter which was dominantly form- 
ative of his philosophy. That question, however, could 
not profitably be discussed on the basis of the materials 
in this volume alone. The letters and diary constitute 
the record of three vivid years of experience and speak 
for themselves. Perhaps if they were being published at 
a different time in our history their editor would feel 
obliged to remind the reader of the doubts and en- 
thusiasms which accompany all young men at war. To- 
day, however, that reminder would be superfluous. The 
language and technique of war have changed since 1 86 1, 
but the influence of wars both total and less than total 
upon the minds of those who fight them has not been ap- 
preciably different. This record, if it has no other signif- 
icance, has that, and one suspects that Holmes would 



V1U 



not be sorry that his earliest and simplest expression of 
feeling and belief will serve to bring that truth home. 

In February, 1942, the late John Gorham Palfrey, 
literary executor of the estate of Mr. Justice Holmes, 
requested me to undertake the preparation of the official 
biography of the Justice. The work was to be official 
only in the sense that I was to be given access to all 
of the Justice's personal papers. At the time when this 
arrangement was made Mr. Palfrey turned over to me 
a substantial number of Holmes's letters, on the under- 
standing that the question of their eventual utilization 
would be determined later. It was contemplated that 
certain groups of the letters might most appropriately be 
published separately and that others might be absorbed 
in the biography. The years of war interrupted progress 
on the papers, and it was not until the winter of 1945- 
1946, after Mr. Palfrey 's death, that a systematic exam- 
ination of the bulk of the papers became possible. 

Various indications had led to the belief that none of 
Justice Holmes's Civil War letters to his parents had 
been preserved. Mr. Palfrey and I had, therefore, 
assumed that there would be great difficulties in the 
preparation of an authentic account of his Civil War 
experience. It was, accordingly, a considerable surprise 
when the letters and diary herein reproduced were dis- 
covered at the bottom of one of the boxes in which the 
Justice's papers had been kept. It was evident that both 



IX 



Holmes and his mother had gone over the letters care- 
fully some time after the Civil War, for the envelopes 
of the majority contain notations in Mrs. Holmes's 
handwriting describing the contents of the letters, and 
a large number of the envelopes also carry similar notes 
in the Justice's hand* The large gaps in the correspond- 
ence, and one or two annotations by the Justice, make it 
reasonably clear that he destroyed an appreciable num- 
ber of his letters to his family. So far as I know, none of 
the Civil War letters of Dr. and Mrs. Holmes, or of 
their children, to Holmes have been preserved. 

On the inside cover of the diary there is the heading 
"Vol. II." This, together with references in the letters 
to an earlier diary, makes it clear that Holmes in his first 
period of service with the zoth Regiment, from the sum- 
mer of 1861 to the winter of 1863-1864, had kept abrief 
record of day to day events. That earlier diary has not, 
however, been found among his papers and the belief 
seems justified that, with the exception of a few pages, 
it was destroyed by him. Those few pages describing his 
wounding at Ball's Bluff were loosely inserted in the 
front of Volume II and are reproduced herein. 

If this interpretation of the Justice's disposition of his 
Civil War letters and diaries is warranted, it may prop- 
erly be said that he was himself the editor of this volume. 
He at least made the initial determination of which let- 
ters and records were worthy of preservation and him- 
self eliminated those which he did not care to have other 



eyes see. This, of course, has reduced my problem to 
a minimum and has made my responsibility more cleri- 
cal than editorial In my annotations I have attempted 
merely to make the running account in letters and diary 
comprehensible to a generation unfamiliar with details 
concerning the events and persons described. Though 
it would have been easy to put the documents in dress 
uniform and add spit and polish to the battle dress in 
which the originals were clothed, I have made no altera- 
tions or omissions in the text; the informalities of punc- 
tuation and abbreviation are preserved. To have altered 
form in such matters would, I believe, have appreciably 
affected substance. 

Military historians of the Civil War will, I very much 
fear, find deficiencies, if not inaccuracies, in the annota- 
tions. I hope, however, that my initial ignorance has 
been an advantage to the general reader, for it has led 
me to seek for those supplementary facts which seemed 
essential for understanding. If experts want more, their 
proficiency will, I feel sure, give them better guidance 
than I could have offered. 

My warmest thanks are owing to Miss Anne Warren 
whose painstaking assistance in the accurate preparation 
of the manuscript greatly simplified my task.

1 In April Holmes had withdrawn from the Senior class at Harvard 
College and had enlisted as a Private in the New England Guards, a 
Boston unit of the Massachusetts Volunteer Militia, commonly desig- 
nated as the Fourth Battalion. On April 25, 1861, following a vote of 
the Battalion to undertake guard duty without pay at Fort Independence 
in Boston Harbor, the Battalion went through a course of basic training 
under the command of Captain T. G. Stevenson. Stevenson, when 
Brigadier General commanding the ist Division of the Ninth Corps, was 
killed at Spottsylvania. All records of the New England Guards since 
1845 were destroyed in the Boston fire of 1872. It is accordingly difficult 
to ascertain details concerning the organization. See James B. Gardner, 
"The New England Guards," 'Bostonian Society Publications, IV 
(1907), 9.

Camp Kalorama 1 

Dear Mother 

Here we are, safe and well We got a late dinner 
the day after starting at New York (Read an account 
of it in papers before we had sat down) I dined with 
some of the fellows at Delmonico's (not in the bar- 
racks ) Breakfast next morn at Phil a Took till night 
to get to Baltimore & arrived in the morning (yesterday) 
at Washington. 

The passage you see was very long and there was very 
little sleep or food Rather enjoyed it for all though 
Last night got to camp much work to find things & 
of course a waggon wheel had smashed my trunk I have 

1 On July 10, 1861, following his graduation from Harvard College, 
Holmes was commissioned First Lieutenant in Company A of the zoth 
Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, one of the "three-year" regiments. 
The Regiment was in training at Camp Massasoit, Readville, Mass., 
during the summer of 1861, was mustered into the Federal service on 
August 8, and left Readville for Washington on September 4. It ar- 
rived in Washington on the morning of September 7 and marched to 
Camp Kalorama, at Georgetown Heights, where it encamped on the 
evening of the same day. 



bent it back so that it is serviceable however though its 
beauty is fled forever My Brandy flask was pulverized. 
After much anxiety however most things have been 
found & hereafter each C has a waggon and there will 
be, more order Hereafter too I think we shall have 
enough to eat & have seen the worst in way of hardships 
unless on special occasions. There is expectation of a 
fight very soon but we I do not believe run any chance 
of service except perhaps as reserve. 
The carpet bag was an invaluable dodge. 

The man has just called for letters so that you may 
hear something* I'll seal this up & write again in more 
leisure

that this reference is to that poem.

Lost and long-wandering at last I brake 
From a deep forest's sullen-opening jaws, 
Where hungry junipers stretched bony claws 
Like traps of devils, baited with a snake 
And all around the dark rocks seemed to take 
Forbidden shapes of things that man outlaws, 
Speckled like toads, and patched with all the flaws 
Of stormy days, and lichen-ringed, and black 
Then wearied out a ls there no hope?" I cried 
Hearken A soft melodious rapture thrills 
As from the forest's deepest heart replied 
Their hermit and the music multiplied 
And rose reechoing upward far and wide

My Dear Mother 

We are right in the midst of the work nowall 
sorts of camps around us military discipline and a 
regular soldier's life. We officers live on what we can 
get, buying milk, eggs, and lots of pies; (peach & apple 
price 12%) now getting meat & again not On the 
whole we have had a very comfortable time however. 
Last night we pitched our tents here the most beautiful 
place we have been at either here or in Mass. Tomorrow 
morning we have marching orders again with one ration

to Camp Burnside on Meridian Hill about one mile from the Capitol. 



in the haversacks. Destination will be known after we 
have started We are under Gen. Lander 2 (a first rate 
man they say) in a Brigade with the ipth Mass & Biir- 
dan's sharp shooters 3 & a Co. of sharp shooters at- 
tached to our Reg't 4 The Col. 5 is ranking Col. & it is 
said will be made Brig. General this is not settled to 
my knowledge. Bartlett, 6 just come in, says we are to 
support Gen 1 Lander's HeadQr's on this side the River 
who asked for our Reg't (a big compliment) This 
may be changed however. 

In sight of where we are is the unfinished Capitol 
& from the neighboring Camp we hear the Bugle calls 
going all day. 

2 Brigadier General Frederick W. Lander at this time was command- 
ing a brigade in General Stone's so-called Corps of Observation. 

3 Colonel Hiram Berdan's United States Sharpshooters. 

4 The ist Company of Sharpshooters (Massachusetts), known as An- 
drew Sharpshooters, was commanded by Captain John Saunders. 

6 Colonel William Raymond Lee had commanded the 20th Regiment 
since its formation. 

6 Captain William Francis Bartlett, of the Harvard Class of 1862, at 
this time commanded Co. I in the loth Regiment, He lost a leg at 
Yorktown in April, 1862, and later became Colonel of the 49th Regi- 
ment Massachusetts Volunteers, Colonel of the 57th Regiment Massa- 
chusetts Volunteers, and ultimately Brigadier General Commanding a 
Brigade in the Ninth Corps. After the publication of Francis W. Pal- 
frey's Memoir of William Francis 'Bartlett (Boston, 1881), Holmes said 
of Bartlett: 

<C I knew him well; yet until that book I had not known the governing 
motive of his soul. I had admired him as a hero. When I read I learned 
to revere him as a saint. His strength was not in honor alone, but in 
religion, and those who do not share his creed must see that it was on 
the wings of religious faith that he mounted above even valiant deeds 
into an empyrean of ideal life." Oliver Wendell Holmes, Speeches 
(Boston, 1934), p, 9.

Today we heard cannonading for 4 or 5 hrs & it is 
said there has been an engagement. Now in comes 
Tremlett 7 & gives another story of our destination So 
I guess it's nowhither in particular. In the meanwhile I 
feel wry well & in very good spirits and I think I am 
learning as I certainly am trying I wish I could write 
details of our life but I am too impatient & have too little 
time to write long letters However God bless you my 
darling I love you just as much as if I talked more with 
my mouth, God bless daddy too & love to the babbies 

I write again soon

[Poolesville, Maryland] 
September 2 3 d 1861. 
My Dear Mother 

This has been an eventful week to me as it has been 
the first that really looked like biz. Last Wednesday 
we (our company & Bartlett's) were suddenly ordered 
to f aU in, pack up blankets & overcoats, received a num- 
ber of rounds of cartridges and after a brief speech from 
Gen. Lander were sent marching off , we didn't know 
whither. 1 The General merely signified we had a post

to the neighborhood of Poolesville, Maryland. On the i5th they settled

of honor & must do our duty. Well we first tramped off 
a couple of miles to Edward's Ferry and then across 
country couldn't find the place so back to ferry 
Circumbendibus by night arrive at last at an advanced 
battery of ours (Rhode Island) whence firing had taken 
place the day before In silence we settle in a grove and 
lie down to pass the night as best may be I had carried 
my invaluable carpet bag Whittier 2 his blankets which 
we shared a drizzle & brief rain increased the liveliness 
of this first experience as groundlings (we had out our 
bedsteads on the march from Washington to where we 
now are, You remember.) But we were very tired & 
slept pretty well. Well, to cut it short, for, as usual, I 
irk the lengthened tale when told with pen We stayed 
at the place till Saturday evening doing duty as an out- 
post near to the river, our pickets extending down to it 
& communicating with those of a Minnesota Reg. sta- 
tioned along the banks of the Muddy Potomac, The 
first morning my eager eyes descry one man in a straw 
hat sitting unconcernedly on his tail apparently a guard 
on duty for the seceshers Men & horses are seen from 
time to time from the tops of the trees and within can- 
non shot off to our right grows up from day to day an 
encampment with earthworks and what may be a heavy 
gun or so but of the last we are not sure But firing

their drums. 




Of course proportionate distances are not Kept the 
man in the straw hat is about % or i mile from the 
top of our hill the sharpshooters who were with us 
said they could plug him but I doubt it. Edwards 
Ferry about 2 miles I guess from hill To the rear 
of our hill & woods is a secesher's house where we 
eat & paid (.37) for delicious dinners of goose & ice- 
cream &c but the artillerymen hooked his pigs geese 
&c (for wh. their Lieut, commanding had to come down 
pretty well & got a reprimand to boot) This secesher 
has since been arrested for signalizing by lights from 
his house but evidence seems inconclusive & I guess he'll 
be released. The last night we were there we slept in

our boots & kept a horse saddled but though an attack 
would have used us up I think we were about as safe in 
their intentions as you were Capt. Crowninshield's Co. 
& that of Capt. Walleston 3 relieved us, unwilling to 
leave goose & laziness, on Saturday evening I had that 
day a touch of diarrhea from drinking to [sic] much 
milk on guard the night before wh. soured on my 
stomach & did not improve the results of wet & lying on 
the ground without a blanket an experiment you need 
be at no fears of my repeating I'm as well as ever now 
though. Flour & water is an excellent & safe specific 
This was a mere touch & before & since Fve been very 
well & weigh 1 36 Ib. Last night (Sunday) or rather in 
the afternoon about four o'cl'k we again bundled down 
this time the whole reg't except the aforesaid two 
companies to Edwards Ferry there being news that 
the Rebels had crossed we slept in our clothes at the 
Ferry all night most of the officers at a buggy (bed & 
spider) house I in the middle of the road Trernlett 
leaving me in charge I secured a convenient slant & 
took a canteen for pillow but it was cold as the tenth 
circle of Inferno It seems wonderful though that I 
mind the exposures little as I do I get on as well as the 
average of the men I should say They were jumping 
round at a great rate to get warm. I had a conviction 
there'd be no trouble & there wasn't so at 5 A.IVL this 
morning home we pack again All these things you see

the present 

It seems so queer to see an encampment & twig men

some of our pickets talking across & so on 4 But I must 
get some sleep tonight to make up for last & it gets

taining C. Walton's letter. YOU ask me if I like letters

My Dear Mother 

Here I am flat on my back after our tirst engagement 
wounded but pretty comfortable 1 I can't write an 
account now but I felt and acted very cool and did my 
duty I am sure I was out in front of our men encourag- 
ing 'em on when a spent shot knocked the wind out of 
me & I fell then I crawled to the rear a few paces & 
rose by help of the ist Ser**; 2 & the Colonel who was 
passing said "That's right Mr Holmes Go to the Rear" 
but I felt that I couldn't without more excuse so up I 
got and rushed to the front where hearing the CoL 
cheering the men on I waved my sword and asked if 
none would follow me when down I went again by the 
Colonel's side The first shot (the spent ball) struck me 
on the belly below where the ribs separate & bruised & 
knocked the wind out of me The second time I hope 
only one ball struck me entering the left & coming out 
behind the right breast in wh. case I shall probably re- 
cover and this view is seconded by finding a ball in my 
clothes by the right hand wound I may be hit twice in 
which case the chance is not so good But I am now so 
well that I have good hopes The first night I made up 

1 On October 21 a small Union force, including units of the loth Regi- 
ment crossed the Potomac at Harrison's Island, and were engaged in a 
brief and unsuccessful engagement with the Confederate forces at Ball's

DIARY, BALL'S BLUFF 



2 3 
[DIARY] 

No. z. 1 

There are a great many things of course, thoughts, 
occupations & events, of which I wish Fd kept Memo- 
randa during my past life But I wish especially that 
after the military aif airs battles etc. in which I've been 
concerned I had noted many of those facts which so 
rapidly escape the memory in the mist which settles 
over a fought field. 

Wound at Ball's Bluff 

Not to speak of while the fight was actually going on, 
I have been struck with the intensity of the mind's ac- 
tion and its increased suggestiveness, after one has re- 
ceived a wound 

At Ball's Bluff, Tremlett's boy George told me, I was 
hit at 4% P.M., the heavy firing having begun about an 
hour before, by the watch I felt as if a horse had 
kicked me and went over ist Serg* Smith grabbed me 
and lugged me to the rear a little way & opened my shirt 
and ecce! the [the] two holes in my breasts & the bullet, 
which he gave me -George says he squeezed it from the 
right opening Well I remember the sickening feeling 

a The significance of this number is not known. This account of 
Hoknes's wounding at BalPs Bluff was apparently written by him some 
time after the event but while he was on active duty. It was found on 
loose sheets in the small diary which he kept from May to July, 1864. 
It seems not improbable that the pages formed a special section in the 
earlier diary which has Sisappeared. Apparently the pages were re- 
moved from that diary with some care and intentionally preserved.

of water in my face I was quite faint and seeing poor 
Serg* Merchant lying near shot through the head and 
covered with blood and then the thinking begun 
(Meanwhile hardly able to speak at least, coherently) 
Shot through the lungs? Lets see and I spit Yes 
already the blood was in my mouth. At once my 
thoughts jumped to "Children of the New Forest." (by 
Marryatt) which I was fond of reading as a little boy, 
and in which the father of one of the heroines is shot 
through the lungs by a robber I remembered he died 
with terrible haemorrhages & great agony What 
should I do? Just then I remembered and felt in my 
waist coat pocket Yes there it was a little bottle of 
laudanum which I had brought along But I won't take 
it yet; no, see a doctor first It may not be as bad as it 
looks At any rate wait till the pain begins 

When I had got to the bottom of the. Bluff the ferry 
boat, (the scow,) had just started with a load but 
there was a small boat there Then, still in this half 
conscious state, I heard somebody groan Then I 
thought "Now wouldn't Sir Philip Sydney have that 
other feller put into the boat first?" But the question, 
as the form in which it occurred shows, came from a 
mind still bent on a becoming and consistent carrying 
out of its ideals of conduct not from the unhesitating 
instinct of a still predominant & heroic 'will I am not 
sure whether I propounded the question but I let myself 
be put aboard. 

I never have been able to account for the fact that 



2 5 

bullets struck in the bank of the island over our heads as 
we were crossing Well; the next question was how to 
get me from the ferry to the hospital this I solved by 
another early recollection the "Armchair" Two men 
crossed their hands in such a way that I could sit on 'em 
& put my arms round their necks & so they carried me 
The little house was filled so I was taken into the large 
building which served as a general hospital; and I re- 
member the coup d'oeuil on which I closed my eyes 
with the same sickening which I had felt on seeing poor 
Merchant Men lying round on the floor the spec- 
tacle wasn't familiar then a red blanket with an arm 
lying on it in a pool of blood it seems as if instinct told 
me it was John Putnam's (then Capt. Comdg Co H) 
and near the entrance a surgeon calmly grasping a man's 
finger and cutting it off both standing while the vic- 
tim contemplated the operation with a very grievous 
mug. Well presently old Hayward 2 approached and in- 
spected me "How does it look, Doctor, shall I recover? 
Tell me the truth for I really want to know" (It 
seemed then and does now as if I was perfectly rational 
but Whittier says that when he saw me later I was very 
light headed ) Hayward in his deliberate way 
"We-ell, you may recover Gen. Shields did" 3 
Shields! I'd thought of him before and got small com- 

a Nathan Hayward, Surgeon of the ioth Regiment. 

* Major General James Shields in the battle of Cerro Gordo in the 
Mexican War had been hit by a grapeshot which entered his chest, 
passed through his lung, and came out near his spine. The wound was 
treated by drawing a silk handkerchief through it on a ramrod.

fort from that we all thought that night that I had a 
couple of bullets in. my lungs & I bled from them (at 
the mouth) very freely "That means the chances are 
against me, don't it?" "Ye-es, the chances are against 
you" Meanwhile he picked something from the left 
opening I thought it was bone till he told me it was a 
bit of flannel again I felt for the laudanum and again 
determined to wait till pain or sinking strength warned 
me of the end being near I didn't feel sure there was 
no chance and watching myself did not feel the hand 
of death upon me beyond a hope my strength seemed 
to hold out too well. 

After this my recollection of events is confused I 
remember poor Willy Putnam's groans and his refus- 
ing to let the Dr. operate on him, saying he knew the 
wound was mortal and it would only be more pain for 
nothing I remember hobnobbing with the man who 
lay near me, and when to my astonishment John O'Sul- 
livan (Whit's & my serv*) appeared telling him to help 
my neighbor too, and feeling very heroic after that 
speech (By the way Hay ward had turned me on my 
breast & this may have helped a good deal of the wound 
to heal almost by first intention) I remember being 
very sleepy (some enlisted man has since told me he 
gave me some coffee and my face flushed and I went 
right off ) & presently a Doctor of (Baxter's?) Fire 
Zouaves 4 coming in with much noise & bluster, and 

* The yand Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers, under Colonel DeWitt 
Clinton Baxter, was commonly known as Baxter's Fire Zouaves. 



27 

oh, troops were crossing to the Virginia side, and we 
were going to lick, and Heaven knows what not I 
called him and gave him my address and told him (or 
meant & tried to) if I died to write home & tell 'em Fd 
done my duty I was very anxious they should know 
that and I then imparted to him my laudanum scheme 
This he dissuaded and gave me a dose of some opiate 
he said it wasn't laudanum, but I guess that was a 
white lie and when I slumbered I believe he prigged 
the bottle 

Pen 5 before I was moved came in & kissed me and 
went away again Whittier came & saw me too, though 
I'm not sure if I remember it and Sturgis 6 of whom 
anon I think I remember the confusion when some 
bullets struck the house and the story that the enemy 
would shell the island. But all these recollections are ob- 
scure and the order of their occurrence uncertain 

Much more vivid is my memory of my thoughts and 
state of mind for though I may have been light-headed 
my reason was working even if through a cloud. Of 
course when I thought I was dying the reflection that 
the majority vote of the civilized world declared that 
with my opinions I was en route for Hell came up with 
painful distinctness Perhaps the first impulse was 
tremulous but then I said by Jove, I die like a soldier 
anyhow I was shot in the breast doing my duty up to 
the hub afraid? No, I am proud then I thought I

couldn't be guilty of a deathbed recantation father 
and I had talked of that and were agreed that it gener- 
ally meant nothing but a cowardly giving way to fear 
Besides, thought I, can I recant if I want to, has the 
approach of death changed my beliefs much? & to this I 
answered No Then came in my Philosophy I am to 
take a leap in the dark but now as ever I believe that 
whatever shall happen is best for it is in accordance 
with a general law and good & universal (or general 
law) are synonymous terms in the universe (I can now 
add that our phrase good only means certain general 
truths seen through the heart & will instead of being 
merely contemplated intellectually I doubt if the in- 
tellect accepts or recognizes that classification of good 
and bad). Would the complex forces which made a 
still more complex unit in Me resolve themselves back 
into simpler forms or would my angel be still winging 
his way onward when eternities had passed? I could not 
tell But all was doubtless well and so with a "God 
forgive me if I'm wrong" I slept But while I was de- 
bating with myself Harry Sturgis bulged upon the scene 
I don't remember what I said I know what I wanted 
it was the cool opinion of an outsider a looker-on 
as a point d'appui for resistance or a TCOO <JTG> from which 
to spring aloft, as the case might be; at any rate a foreign 
substance round which my thoughts could crystallize 
Sturge I hear says I was very profane, to this effect 
"Well Harry I'm dying but 111 be G. d'd if I know 
where I'm going" But I doubt it although a little later 



29 

I swore frightfully to the great horror of John O'S. 
who tried to stop me thinking I was booking myself for 
Hell rapidly. Sturge thereat with about his usual tact, 
begun "Why Homey you believe in Christ, don't 
you" etc. with a brief exposition of doctrine argumenta- 
tively set forth I gave him my love for Pen whom Fd 
not yet seen, & the same message home which I subse- 
quently gave the Fire Zouave Surgeon and Sturge de- 
parted Later I only can recall, in a general way, being 
carried across the Island in a blanket lying on the bank 
comatose, being ferried across to the M d shore with 
some hitch (we came mighty near being upset I heard 
afterwards) swearing terrifically as I've said and fi- 
nally after being put in the hold of a canal boat and the 
hatches or scuttle or whatever you call it tumbling in 
and nearly all but smashing me & one or two others into 
sudden death, that I muzzed away the time till we got to 
Edwards Ferry 

N.B. I forgot to mention on the second page of this 
account, that I believe it was while I was being taken 
down the Bluff that I said to myself in rather grim 
pleasantry "Whittier Brevet First Lieutenant" 

I was taken from the Canal boat and put into one of 
the two wheeled ambulances which were then in vogue 
as one form of torture Captain Dreher was my com- 
panion shot through the head & insensible, but breath- 
ing heavily The Ambulance was broken the horse 
baulked and the man didn't know how to drive when- 
ever we came to a hill. & there were several, there we 



30 

stopped, head downward, till some of the men along the 
road gave us a boost 4 started our horse forward again 
I suffered much in mind f or what with the rough rid- 
ing & my momentary expectations of being upset I 
hardly thought to reach camp alive There was a piece 
of road which Sturge had built & on which he prided 
himself not a little; my aching bones told me when we 
reached that Via Mala Fortunately I directed our 
driver to go to the Regt. instead of to Poolesville and 
we got to the Hospital at early dawn There were 
many commiserating exclamations Hibbard 7 (then pr. 
HL Co. A.) who was there, sick, insisted on turning out 
and giving me his bed Then for the first time I saw 
Dreher a ghastly spectacle Two black cavities 
seemed all that there was left for eyes his whiskers & 
beard matted with blood which still poured black, from 
his mouth and a most horrible stench 

The Hospital Steward a cockeyed Dutchman who 
afterwards stuck me certain shekels for his services 
looked at my wound and conjectured the true state of 
affairs bound me round with an infernal bandage 
(which Hayward cut as soon as he saw,) having first 
rammed plugs of lint into the holes, and then left me 
uncomfortable but still exceedingly joyful, for he had 
told me I should" live I could have hugged him for 
that After this whiskey lightheadedness lauda-

told me, he did, more or less Peter like! 

I remember Hayward's saying "It is a beautiful face/' 
or something of the sort & looking up & seeing Willy 
Putnam, calm & lovely, and being told or knowing 
he was dead I was soon moved to a Wall Tent with 
John Putnam where all was quiet (Tremlett here aston- 
ished me with his tenderness & even Wollaston 9 when 
he returned from Boston had tears in his eyes as he 
looked on John). Maj. Gen. Banks 10 came in (see his 
letter home) n Gordon 12 & Andrews 13 of the z nd Mr, 
Hovey 14 etc. and things went smoothly barring my im-

hit, but as I always wanted to have a memorandum of 
this experience so novel at that time to all & especially 
so to me from the novelty of the service and my youth 
I have told the whole story from time I was hit until ap- 
prehension had left me 

2. I must add one more confession. While I was lying 
on the island, one of the thoughts that made it seem par- 
ticularly hard to die was the recollection of several fair 
damsels whom I wasn't quite ready to leave 

3. Charley Pearson 1 * told me when I saw him in 
Washington after my wound at the 2 nd Fredericks- 
burg, that a gentleman told him that visiting Harrison's 
Island and looking round for a relic he came on a blood- 
stained handkerchief marked "Lt. O W Holmes, Jr." 
"20 th Regt. Mass. Vols." which he pouched & pre- 
served 17 

4. It is curious how rapidly the mind adjusts itself under 
some circumstances to entirely new relations I thought 
for awhile that I was dying, and it seemed the most 
natural thing in the world The moment the hope of 
life returned it seemed as abhorrent to nature as ever 
that I should die

1 Holmes had been on leave in Boston since his wounding at Ball's 
Bluff. For a part of the time he had apparently been on recruiting duty 
in Boston and Pittsfield. (See J. T. Morse, Jr., Life and Letters of 
Oliver Wendell Holmes (Boston, 1896), II, 163; Carolyn Kellogg Gush-

until February 26, 1862, and had, after several moves, left Bolivar Heights 
near Harper's Ferry, on March 24, for Washington. It is unlikely that 
they arrived there before the 25th. See Annual Report of the Adjutant-

1 The 20th Regiment boarded the transport "CatskilT on March 27, 
and sailed from Washington on the 28th, arriving at Hampton, Virginia, 
on March 31, 1862. The Regiment went into bivouac for the night one 
mile outside of Hampton on the road to Big Bethel. In the next days 
the Union forces advanced up the Peninsula and, on the night of the 6th, 
the 2oth camped four miles beyond Big Bethel and within some five miles 
of Yorktown.

have constantly to be made or mended for artillery (of 
wh. there is a great deal) The men and officers are wet 
enough you may believe but there is real pluck shown 
now as these are real hardships to contend with. But 
yesterday (i.e. Monday unless all my days are one be- 
hindhand) it was cold comfort to come back to a camp- 
ing ground with which the Boston Common parade 
ground at its worst offers a favorable contrast after a 
march up to knees in mud all day on a reconnoisance 
on wh. our Brigade was sent. We are in camp within 
4 miles of the enemie's fortifications & approached to

artillery with shell from the rebs none on our side ) all

6 Fkst Lieutenant Henry L. Abbott, later Major commanding the 
2oth Regiment, was among Holmes's most intimate friends in the Regi- 
ment. The son of Judge Josiah G. Abbott of Lowell, Massachusetts, he 
had been graduated from Harvard College in 1860 and enlisted in the 
4th Battalion and gone to Fort Independence with Holmes in April, 1861. 
He was undoubtedly the most distinguished soldier in the zoth Regiment. 
After surviving all the earlier battles of the Regiment he was killed in 
the Wilderness Campaign on May 6, 1864. To his friends he was known 
as "Little" Abbott. His older brother and college classmate, Captain 
Edward Gardner Abbott of the 2nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, 
was killed at Cedar Mountain, August 9, 1862. In Holmes's Memorial 
Day Address, delivered on May 30, 1884, he spoke of Henry L. Abbott 
as follows: 

"There is one who on this day is always present to my mind. He en- 
tered the army at nineteen, a second lieutenant. In the Wilderness, 
already at the head of his regiment, he fell, using the moment that was 



splendid coolness I expected to see some bowled over 
every minute but just as they were in sight of the 
works Comstock & Bartlett (who is much better than 

Palf . who isn't worth a ) ran forward and ordered 

Abbot (who had misunderstood the order) under 
cover as skirmishers then Cabots Co. K 6 (Ned Hal- 
lowell, 2 nd Lt.) 7 went forward & then the battalion 
marched by the left flank to posit* no 2. by the edge of 
the woods Then the skirmishers fired a little or were 

left him of life to give all his little fortune to his soldiers. I saw him in 
camp, on the march, in action. I crossed debatable land with him when 
we were rejoining the army together. I observed him in every kind of 
duty, and never in all the time that I knew him did I see him fail to 
choose that alternative of conduct which was most disagreeable to him- 
self. He was indeed a Puritan in all his virtues, without the Puritan 
austerity; for, when duty was at an end, he who had been the master and 
leader became the chosen companion in every pleasure that a man might 
honestly enjoy. In action he was sublime. His few surviving companions 
will never forget the awful spectacle of his advance alone with his com- 
pany in the streets of Fredericksburg. In less than sixty seconds he would 
become the focus of a hidden and annihilating fire from a semicircle of 
houses. His first pktoon had vanished under it in an instant, ten men 
falling dead by his side. He had quietly turned back to where the other 
half of his company was waiting, had given the order, "Second platoon, 
forward!" and was again moving on, in obedience to superior command, 
to certain and useless death, when the order he was obeying was coun- 
termanded. The end was distant only a few seconds; but if you had 
seen him with his indifferent carriage, and sword swinging from his 
finger like a cane, you never would have suspected that he was doing 
more than conducting a company drill on the camp parade ground. He 
was little more than a boy, but the grizzled corps commanders knew 
and admired him; and for us, who not only admired, but loved, his death 
seemed to end a portion of our life also." Holmes, op. cit. supra, pp. 7-8.

latter I sent by mail We go on picket every third day

of Yorktown. Following the abortive crossing and re-crossing of War-

trated all efforts upon preparations for a direct assault on the fortifica- 
tions at Yorktown,

& reading old letters after a night of raining like blazes, 
out in the woods with a constant popping of guns where 
the reb s and our men were exchanging compliments & 
every now & then bang boom as a shell was fired & 
exploded on the one side or t'other we fire most 
Now and then a bullet would whiz high over our heads 
from the other side. 

Our pickets are pushed out to the edge of a marsh on 
the other side of wh. the reb s have their earthworks & 
wh. they can drain when they desire, by means of a 
water gate We go on again tomorrow 

The notion now seems to be that McClellan is trying 
to out-general & catch 'em if poss. without a big fight 
Tell Amelia I was delighted with her letter and if I don't 
answer it it is want of time & opportunity. My dear

her to write often once a week is seldom I tell you 
you can't realize how we long to hear from home out

one & generally more letters every mail (i.e. two days) 
while I hardly get one a week My cold seems to have 
finally departed and except that the two rainy days 
before & while on picket my bowels played the Devil

been very well

guns. They were mowed down and broke The shin- 
gles of the house rattled with the hail of Reb. bullets 
and many whistled by mostly over us wounding one 
or two Here I saw an officer just in front of our line 
lying snug behind a stump apparently, too, unhurt 
Soon we filed round and formed under fire in ind posit,

and we could see in the field, (where our 3 d posit, was

difference one gets to look on the dead bodies in gray 
clothes wh* lie all around (or rather did We are 
burying them today as fast as we can ) As you go 
through the woods you stumble constantly, and, if after 
dark, as last night on picket, perhaps tread on the swol- 
len bodies already fly blown and decaying, of men shot 
in the head back or bowels Many of the wounds are 
terrible to look at especially those fr. fragments of 
shell, Co G although roughs & poor material fought 
splendidly especially after the first flurry when they had 
settled down to the work Once when entre nous the 
right of Lowell's Co begun to waver a little and fall back 
our left stood and didn't give an inch But really as 
much or rather more is due to the file closers than any- 
thing else I told 5 em to shoot any man who ran and they 
lustily buffeted every hesitating brother I gave one 
(who was cowering) a smart rap over the backsides with 
the edge of my sword and stood with my revolver & 
swore Fd shoot the first who ran or fired against orders 
Well we licked 'em and this time there was the ma- 
neuvering of a battle to be seen splendid and awful to 
behold; especially as the dusk allowed us to see clearly

My dear Father 

Today's mail has made up for past injustice and neg- 
lect by bringing me five envelopes 4 enclosing letters 
and one, even better, a toothbrush 3 were from blush- 
ing maidens I am glad you have rec'd mine if it were 
only to do our Reg* the justice of saying we were in 
some of the prettiest fighting The ipth & Tammany 2 
of our brigade weren't there but we were And I wish 
that while local Regts like the loth & i5th get cracked 

1 After the Battle of Fair Oaks, from June i to June 11, the Regiment 
remained in its advance position south of the Chickahominy. On the i ith 
it was relieved from the front line and moved a mile or so to high 
ground along the York River Railroad line, and established a camp 
there (Camp Lincoln).

up like thunder that the loth got its due credit. At Ball's 
Bluff I think we fought better than the i5th Certainly 
our proportionate loss was greater than any Regts in this 
'whole army during the whole war at least I understand 
so Our loss was more than one in 4 killed & wounded. 
And this time while we hear about the loth &c &c & how 
the Tammany stood like veterans (two miles out of the 
fight) our work is hardly mentioned. After all it makes 
very little difference except for the sake of justice and 
one's friends. I wish you wouldn't all be so anxious 
Our loss in this last fight of 25 K d & W d out of 400 (our 
whole fighting force) is about the usual proportion for 
the Regts actively engaged 

We are now for two days a little in the rear (about 
% mile from the advanced pickets) our brigade having 
been relieved from the very hard work it or at least we 
have been doing. 

For a week and a half mostly rainy We had hardly 
any sleep hardly any blankets or anything Shall I 
confess a frightful fact? Many of the officers including 
your beloved son have discovered themselves to have 
been attacked by body lice in consequence (Caught 
perhaps from the men, perhaps from the dirty places we 
have been forced to live in or enter.) I shall fix their 
flints though now. 

The men behaved like bricks through it all I think 
my men like me I have heard so and I find the duties 
please me better than those of a Lt. My men cheered 
me after the fight. I have a znd Lt. with me by name

I have sent one or two notes since the one you rec'd

My Dear Mother 

I enclose a letter to Morse 2 which though not par- 
ticularly interesting you may read. I will only add that 
in my own case the scorbutic symptoms are not as in 
general specific so much as they are disorders traceable 
to the same cause (want of fresh food) and wh. will I 
suppose be knocked in the head before they get much 
farther 

It's rather funny to drink lemonade for disorder of 
bowels though! As the doctors order. The homesick- 
ness wh. I mentioned in my last they say is one of the 
first symptoms of scurvy. I have had very little more 
fresh food than my men so it Would be natural to have 
the same troubles 

However I shall come out all right I don't doubt in a 
day or two.

*The date of this letter is uncertain. It is likely, however, that it is 
the letter referred to in the note dated July 4 as having been sent on 
that morning. On July 4 the Regiment, with the rest of the Army of the 
Potomac, was at Harrison's Landing on the James River. 

3 An account of the Seven Days Battle will be found in the letter 
dated July 5, infra p. 58. Between June 19 and June 28 the Regiment had 
remained on the alert at Camp Lincoln. On the 2 8th it was moved for- 
ward for the preparation of trenches. By that time the whole Army of 
the Potomac, as a result of the engagements at Oak Grove (June 25), at 
Beaver Dam Creek (June 26), and at Gaines's Mill, was on the South 
side of the Chickahominy, and the line of communications with the 
Pamunkey and York Rivers had been abandoned. 

8 First Lieutenant James J. Lowell, commanding Company E, was hit 
in the battle at Nelson's Farm on June 30 and died in the hands of the 
Confederates. In his Memorial Day Address of May 30, 1884, Holmes 
said of Lowell: "I see another youthful lieutenant as I saw him in the 
Seven Days, when I looked down the line at Glendale. The officers were 
at the head of their companies. The advance was beginning. We 
caught each other's eye and saluted. When next I looked, he was gone.'* 
Holmes, op* cit. p. 6. 

* Second Lieutenant Henry L. Patten, Company E. Later, as Major of 
the Regiment, he died of wounds received on September 13, 1864, at 
Bailey's Creek. 

First Lieutenant Henry L. Abbott had been wounded in the Batde 
of Glendale.

My Dear Mother and Father 

June 29 we started from the trenches on our re- 
treat at Fair Oaks passed Rocket Guns & great quan- 
tities of stores wh. had to be destroyed Went a little 
further & formed in line. Co s I & B (the R. & Left. Co s ) 
went out as skirmishers & my Co. as support Our own 
side fired shell & cannister into us (hurt no one luckily) 
and the 5 th N. H. Regt. behaving badly I had to fall 
back on the Regt. Afternoon marched to Savage's Stat n 
where lots more stores were destroyed and a hospital 
stood where all the wounded had to be left to the enemy. 
Here the enemy shelled us Several men hurt none of 
our Co. Major was touched but not hurt. 1 later there 
was tall musketry (we sharing but little) and a South 
Car a Brigade 2 was chewed up. 3

The next morn'g a splendid line of battle (of the whole 
army) at Malverton where the Reb s shelled us (our 
brigade) hard. The shell & Round Shot bounced round 
lively. At midnight started and marched through ter- 
rible rain & mud till we reached the James, the next 
afternoon. The anxiety has been more terrible than al- 
most any past experience but through all I kept pretty 
lively only getting down when on the last of our march 
I was told by Cheerful birds like Tremlett & co that we 
must surrender or be cut to pieces within 36 hours. 

Poor Lowell was hit just as Willy Putnam was & 
had to be left behind beyond doubt dead. Patten hit 
in leg. Abbot flesh w'd in arm. Muller wounded &

1 During July the 2oth Regiment, with the rest of the Army of the 
Potomac, remained at Harrison's Landing. On August 4 the Regiment 
had participated in the advance to Malvern Hill. Orders from Wash- 
ington, however, compelled General McClellan to withdraw all his 
forces from the Peninsula and move them to join General Pope near 
Washington, which was threatened by General Jackson. Between 
August 1 6 and August 22 the Regiment marched from the James 
River to Newport News, via Yorktown. On the 25th the Regiment em- 
barked at Newport News and arrived at Aquia Creek, on the Potomac, 
on August 27. After a number of long marches, the 2oth Regiment

8 Major General Joseph Hooker, commanding the First Corps, on Sep-

Gap in the course of the Battle of South Mountain. On September 16 
General Hooker on the right wing of the Federal line had crossed Antie- 
tarn Creek and engaged the enemy. The Twelfth Corps crossed on the 
left the same evening. 

* General Sumner, on Hooker's left, did not receive his orders to cross 
the Antietam until 7 A.M. on the lyth, though, in accordance with orders, 
he had his troops ready to advance across the creek at one hour before

cizing the radical, abolitionist, and "]zcobm" opposition to General 
McClellan, was speaking most hopefully of the Maryland Campaign, 
was making light of the Confederate successes around Harper's Ferry, 
and in an editorial in the September i6th issue predicted that if 
McClellan foHowed up his recent successes with a quick dash on Rich- 
mond, the rebellion might be brought to an end in sixty days. In the 
September lyth issue the Herald played down the significance of the 
Union surrender at Harper's Ferry on September 15 and took comfort in 
its rumored evacuation by the Confederate forces just after the Federal 
capitulation.

x ln Norwood P. Hallowell's Reminiscences (Privately Printed, 1897), 
p. 1 6-1 8, he gives the following account of events after his wounding at 
Antietam: 

"Before long I gained the little farmhouse marked on the maps as the 
Nicodemus house. The yard was full of wounded men, and the floor of 
the parlor, where I lay down, was well covered with them. Among 
others, Captain O. W. Holmes, Jr., walked in, the back of his neck 
clipped by a bullet The baggage train had not been up for many a 
day, so that I had replenished my wardrobe by appropriation of chance 
clothing from various sources. It so happened that I wore on that day 
the light blue trousers and dark blue blouse of a private soldier. When 
the rebels, a little later, were busy in the yard, paroling some and tak- 
ing others to the rear, paying marked attention, of course to officers, 
I was glad to have taken the precaution to remove my shoulderstraps 
and to conceal them with my sword under a blanket. 

"The first Confederate to make his appearance put his head through 
the window and said: Tankee?' 'Yes.' Wounded?' *Yes. 3 Would you 
like some water?' A wounded man always wants some water. He off 
with his canteen, threw it in the room, and then resumed his place in 
the skirmish line and his work of shooting retreating Yankees. In about 
fifteen minutes that good-hearted fellow came back to the window all 
out of breath, saying, 'Hurry up there! Hand me my canteen! I am on 
the double-quick myself now! 7 Some one twirled the canteen to him, 
and away he went- 

". . . For a while the farmhouse appeared to be midway between the 
opposing forces. Shells broke the window panes, and ploughed up the 
wounded in the yard, but not a shot went through the house. 

'During some fifteen or twenty minutes only we were within the 
rebel lines. Late that afternoon ambulances carried us off to Keedys- 
vflle." 

Events after the removal of Holmes from the Nicodemus house to 
Keedysville are described in a letter from W. G. LeDuc to Holmes, 
written in 1910. LeDuc, as Lieutenant Colonel and Quartermaster in

General Dana's Brigade, was at Antietam and it was he who first noti- 
fied Dr. Holmes of his son's wound. (See My Hunt After "The Cap- 
tain" op. tit. supra, pp. 1-2.) In 1910, recalling the events at Antietam, 
LeDuc, speaking of Holmes in the third person, wrote as follows: 
". , . when I was doing my level best to dress the wound and fix him up 
safe for the night or until a surgeon could take him in hand. Tin devilish 
glad it aint a case for amputation LeDuc for I haven't much confidence 
in your skill as surgeon.' . . . [We were at the house] where I exer- 
cised my clumsy surgery and where the mistress of the mansion when 
I ordered her to bring down her bigest [sic] & best feather bed and 
place it on the floor for this wounded officer objected in Pennsylvania 
idiom *Nah I dinks not I prings mine fetter bet on dem floor, 1 1 puts im 
on der petshtet' *No that wont do I want it here where is plenty of 
fresh air.' < Nah!' Well then I'll have to turn you all out and take 
your place for a hospital. 5 So the feather bed came, and the boy was 
washed as to wound and face and given an opium pill prescribed by old 
Doherty I think and left, in care of the dutchwoman and her children, 
no man was seen" 

It seems probable that the woman referred to by LeDuc was Margaret 
Bjtzmuller, described by Dr. Holmes, (Id. p. 32.)

taken up new duties as Assistant Inspector General of the Sixth Corps. 
He had been wounded at Antietam, where his brother, Edward H. R. 
Revere, Assistant Surgeon of the 2oth, was killed. In April, 1863, ne re ~

1 The body of this letter is not in Holmes's handwriting. Anna Howell 
Kennedy Findlay, the daughter of Holmes's hostess in Hagerstown, 
Maryland, has described the young officer's visit in her article "Where 
the Captain was Found," Maryland Historical Magazine, XXXIII (June, 
1938), 109, 118, and has, perhaps, told of the occasion on which this 
letter of September 22 was written: 

a He dictated in Latin, a letter to his father; but she understood Latin 
as well as he did, as she confessed when she cautioned him that he was 
becoming a little too personal concerning herself in moods and tenses." 

Mrs. Findlay identifies Holmes's amanuensis as Miss Ellen Jones of 
Philadelphia. 

3 How ineffective this request was is known to all readers of Dr. 
Holmes's My Hunt After "The Captain? loc* ctt* supra, originally pub- 
lished in die Atlantic Monthly in December, 1862. Dr. Holmes, as a 
matter of fact, had left Boston on his hunt for the Captain on Sep- 
tember 1 8.

Out of charity for you I will state plainly that I am

have in fancy today been swelling on Beacon St. when 
I was in fact in beastly gov* cars smoking a TIX & plug 
tobacco. We started at n AM & got here at 4% PM 
Everything seems at 6 s & f here & you see about as many 
secesh (I suppose paroled) swelling round as you do

1 A part of Holmes's convalescence after Antietam seems to have been 
spent in Pittsfield. (See Carolyn Kellogg Gushing, "The Gallant Cap- 
tain and the Little Girl/* loc. tit. supra. On an evening in early Novem- 
ber or late October, however, he attended a dinner at the Parker House 
in Boston, at which ten officers of the Regiment, wounded or on leave, 
were present. See Bruce, op. cit p. 180. 

2 Warrenton at this time was the Headquarters of the Army of the Po- 
tomac. On November 10 General McClellan had turned over command 
of the Army to General Burnside.

My Dear Mother 

(Show this to F. McG) 

These have been very trying times for me I assure 
you First after being stretched out miserably sick with 
the dysentery, growing weaker each day from illness 
and starvation, I was disappointed in getting my papers 
sending me to Philad* by the delay at the various Head- 
Q'rs & the subsequent business causing them to be over- 
looked just as they reached the last Stunner's Then 
yesterday morng the grand advance begins 1 I see 
for the first time the Reg* going to battle while I remain 
behind 2 a feeling worse than the anxiety of danger, 
I assure you Weak as I was I couldn't restrain my tears 
I went into the Hosp 1 the only tent left here list- 
less and miserable. They were just moving out a dead 
man while another close to death with the prevailing 
trouble (dysentery &c.) was moaning close by In the 
Hosp 1 all day with no prospect of being moved or cared 
for, and this morning we hear the Regt. has been in it. 
Exaggerated rumors; then it settles down that poor

Cabot 3 is killed and several, among them my 2nd Lt. 4 
wounded The cannonading of yesterday hasn't recom- 
menced this morning but the day is young and I expect 
before night one of the great battles of the war 5 I was 
on the point of trying to get down there but found I 
was too weak for the work Meanwhile another day of 
anxious waiting of helpless hopelessness for myself, of 
weary unsatisfied questioning for the Regt. When I 
know more I will continue my letter I have no books 
I can read I am going to try to calm myself by drawing, 
but now four days have passed in disappointed expecta- 
tions. Later 

Dec. 13 Quiet all yesterday Wrote James e in the 
afternoon (may not send it) This morning there's 
heavy cannonading and just now there's a very lively 
musketry practise going on and many a nice fellow 
going off, I doubt not. Still the popping keeps up lively 
but somehow it doesn't seem to settle down to a good 
steady roll but it's brisk Today will settle I fancy 
whether we fight more or not; if not whether it shall 
be one or two 7

My Dear Governor 

After the inspiration of a night which would have 
been rather a nipper in your furnace-warmed house with 
double glass, passed here with a couple of blankets in one 
of the tents wh. I suppose Gen. Halleck (whom may the 
Lord confound) would enumerate among the "luxuries' 5 
of the Army of the Potomac I sit down to give you the 
benefit of my cheerfulness I always read now the D. 
Advertiser religiously as well as other papers and I 
was glad to see that cheerful sheet didn't regard the late 
attempt in the light of a reverse It *wa$ an infamous 
butchery in a ridiculous attempt in wh. I've no doubt 
our loss doubled or tripled that of the Reb s . However 
that's neither here nor there Fve just been reading 
Mr. Motley's letters to Billy Seward 1 What a noble 
manly high-toned writer he is I always thought his 
letters to you were more thoroughly what a man should 
write than almost any I ever saw I never I believe 
have shown, as you seemed to hint, any wavering in my 
belief in the right of our cause it is my disbelief in our 
success by arms in wh. I differ from you & him I think 
in that matter I have better chances of judging than 
you and I believe I represent the conviction of the 
army & not the least of the most intelligent part of it 

*On Monday, December 15, 1862, the Boston Daily Advertiser re- 
printed recent letters from John Lotfarop Motley to Secretary Seward. 
The letters dealt principally with affairs and attitudes in Austria, 



8o 

The successes of wh* you spoke were to be anticipated as 
necessary if we entered into the struggle But I see no 
farther progress I don't think either of you realize the 
unity or the determination of the South. I think you are 
hopeful because (excuse me) you are ignorant. But if it 
is true that we represent civilization wL is in its nature, 
as well as slavery, diff usive & aggressive, and if civ 11 & 
progress are the better things why they will conquer in 
the long run, we may be sure, and will stand a better 
chance in their proper province peace than in war, 
the brother of slavery brother it is slavery's parent, 
child and sustainer at once At any rate dear Father 
don't, because I say these things imply or think that I 
am the meaner for saying them I am, to be sure, 
heartily tired and half worn out body and mind by this 
life, but I believe I am as ready as ever to do my duty 
But it is maddening to see men put in over us & motions 
forced by popular clamor when the army is only willing 
to trust its life & reputation to one man 

Please send me by mail 6 of the best kind of photog* of 
me (the 2/3 lengths they are stunners I think Fd 
rather play my game with that dummy than in per- 
son) I want to give them to some of the officers By 
Ged (the vowel is an ) the Reg* did behave gloriously 
in the late rumpi. I feel a sort of dispassionate pride com- 
bined with my regret at my own absence Isn't this a

1 Early in January, 1863, Holmes had apparently been on sick leave in 
Philadelphia where he was visited by his parents. (See Ralph L. Rusk, 
The Letters of Ralph Waldo Emerson (New York, 1939), V, 305.) On 
January 25, 1863, the 20th Regiment moved into the town of Falmouth 
and took over duty as provost guard. Holmes, who presumably had re- 
turned to duty by then, was appointed Provost Marshal of the town. 
Colonel Lee had resigned his command, and though Lieutenant Colonel 
Palfrey was promoted to fill the vacancy* he was unable to report for 
duty. Captain Macy acted as regimental commander until the middle of 
April when Colonel Paul J. Revere took the command. On January 
28 General Burnside had been removed from the command of the Army 
of the Potomac, and General Hooker succeeded him. General Sumner 
also resigned at that time, being replaced by General Couch. The 
Grand Divisions, established by Burnside, were dissolved and the organi- 
zation of the Army into Corps reestablished.

1 During the latter days of April successful opening moves in the 
Ghancellorsville campaign were made by General Hooker. The 2oth 
Regiment, part of Gibbon's Division of the Second Corps remained at 
Falmouth during these operations. On the night of May 2-3, however, 
it moved f orward, and the morning of the 3rd the Regiment crossed the 
Rappahannock, passed through Fredericksburg, and approached the canal 
to the west of the town. It was while waiting there to effect a crossing 
of the canal that the Regiment came under Confederate artillery fire 
from Marye's Heights as described in this letter.

3 The exact date and circumstances of Holmes's return to active duty 
following his convalescence from his Fredericksburg wound have not 
been ascertained. The records of the Adjutant General in Washington 
indicate that he was put on detached service from the zoth Regiment as 
AJD.C. to Major General Horatio G. Wright, commanding the ist Divi- 
sion of the Sixth Corps by orders dated February 2, 1864. Presumably 
tills letter of February i was written shortly before or after Holmes's ar- 
rival at Divisional Headquarters. John C. Ropes, writing from Boston to 
Major John C. Gray on January 9, 1864, said that Holmes had "gone 
back." (See War Letters, 1862-1865, of John CUpmm Gray and John 
Codman Ropes (Boston, 1927), p. 274.) In the Diary of First Lieutenant 
Charles W. Folsom, quartermaster of the 20th, which is preserved in the 
Regimental collection at the Boston Public Library, there is an entry 
dated January 8, 1864, stating that Holmes is back. It is evident, accord- 
ingly, that for a part of January he was with his Regiment in the neigh- 
borhood of Stevensburg above the Rapidan River. Major Abbott at the 
time was in command of the Regiment.

Apr. 18: I864 1 

I have you scout the possibility of the human reason 
ever conceiving that s l ~ I ~ 3 and further deny the 

12 "i~ 2 5 

possibility of the truth of that proposition This of 
course involves the assumption of certain fixed prin- 
ciples in reason wh. cant be disturbed by any education 
Le. independent of the senses & if true proves their 
existence So we may suppose a reasoning being to 
whom the only external (objective) matters percep- 
tible were like Boskevitch's (is that the Dutchman's 
tarnal name?) conception of the original atoms viz. 
(polar) centres of force of the nature of mathematical 
points Let this force be gravitation Two of these 
points being brought into such correlation in space as to 
admit of both being perceived at once are found like 
double stars to establish a third point a centre of 
gravity & having the same relations to point 4 if it ap- 
pears that p* i has to pt 2. around wh, each revolves 
but unlike the case of double stars the two original points 
are immaterial and like the 3* 

Then the only case wh. our senses would present us of 
the juxtaposition of one perceptible to a second would 
be a case of 3 perceptibles As it is now we can put one 
apple by another apple & no 3 d apple invariably ranges in 
row but supposing our uniform experience were as I 
have imagined shouldn't we say 1+1=3?

preserved.

Answer me this riddle which with delight I concocted 
to stick my daddy et eris mihi magmis Apolk 



[Undated 1864 (P)] 1 

The being whom we have supposed does not per- 
ceive a & b except in relation or as you express it as i X i. 
but i X i i.e. force p* a in dynamical relation with force pt 
b begets force p* c and as the being supposed never per- 
ceives a & b except with c he will have no idea of a & b 
without c (for having only one sense he can't correct its 
impressions from the data of any other as we can) or 
[or] of 1+1=2 but only of 1+1=3 a+b+c 
The answer is as follows if the hypothesis of the single 
sense means only the fact gravitation rendered into con- 
sciousness then aXb (i.e. a in dynam 1 relaf 1 with b) will 
affect the consciousness as they would a new force p* 
consciousness of force points a & b will be obliterated & 
taken up in a new consciousness viz. single force point c 
wL = a+b 

You don't answer the puzzle but fall into the trap & 
confess i+i+(iXi)=3 i.e. that i & i in the only rela- 
tion OTceivable to our friend the unisensate because the 
only perceivable =3 In fact 1+1=1 twice as big like 
2 raindrops coalescing as I've shown on the hypothesis 

*This note on a small scrap of paper, bears no date. It has been 
placed here because it deals farther with the subject discussed in the 
note of April 18, 1864, and was presumably written at approximately the 
same time. 



97 

wh, I put forward & you fell into like a stult there w'd 
be a true case of genesis of force if unfortunately the 
hypothesis were not absurd in imagining him to per- 
ceive a & b & at the same time c The absurdity of my 
attempt was that I tried starting from an hypothesis con- 
sistent with the data (i.e. all our experiences of externals 
& all conceivable exper. consistent with our past ex- 
periences) which even I granted uniformly taught 
1+1=2 to deduce an inconsistent result

Hancock having moved from our right to left of 6th

opened at about 4.30 am,* in about a quarter hour we 
heard Hancock's shouts going in Hard fighting 
Now, 5.14 am, it is pretty quiet that is doesn't sound 
like more than picket fire No firing on front of 5th C. 
(now right of line) nor apparently by 6th C. Hancock's 
firing is where I have noted Gen. Mott 3 pp. back,

try it again is a question 

7 P.M. They did try again & in brief All day we have 
been fighting & are banging away still bullets are now 
whistling round these H.Q. & meanwhile a flock of little 
chickens are peeping & cheeping their mother no 
doubt being in the belly of some soldier. The H.Q.

The firing had not ceased at 2 AM when I turned in 
In Brief Hancock did on a large scale what Mott was 
intended to do loth inst. He attacked in two lines of 
battalions in mass captured 3 generals, 3 many ( ) 4 
colors Over 3000 men & 18 or 22 guns. It was John- 
son's Div. & he was taken. After the first success we did 
not advance further during the day The most stub- 
born fighting was at a point of woods in front of Han- 
cock's H.Q. & thither I had to ride between 1 1 & 2 P.M. 
& put in a Regt (loth N. J.) 5 couldn't find Russell to 
whom I was to report. Burnside who attacked on H's 
left didn't make much, he is a d'd humbug Warren 
who is a ditto did about the same We finally found a 
new line facing down towards our old left & about per- 
pendicular to the old front. In the morn'g went to Gen. 
Meade for troops from Warren Meade not only 
wouldn't send any but stopped a Brig. wh. had started 
I think this was a mistake & that he should have 
slapped in all he could spare on Hancock's front I 
think Warren represented himself harder pressed than 
he was The Gen 1 (W.) was hit in leg quite painfully 
with a piece of shell not wounded however We were 
all under fire all day

Dear Parents 



Rec'd last night enclosed letters Yesterday & to- 
day tolerably quiet, a quiet that you will easily believe 
was needed after the long series of collisions beginning 
on the 5th Before you get this you will know how im- 
mense 1 the butchers bill has been And the labor has

in the mood for writing details. I have kept brief notes 
in my diary wh. I hope you may see some day Enough 
that these nearly two weeks have contained all of fatigue 
& horror that war can furnish The advantage has been 
on our side but nothing decisive has occurred & the en- 
emy is in front of us strongly intrenched I doubt if 
the decisive battle is to be fought between here & Rich- 
mond nearly every Regimental off I knew or cared 
for is dead or wounded 

I have made up my mind to stay on the staff if pos- 
sible till the end of the campaign & then if I am alive, I 
shall resign I have felt for sometime that I didn't any 
longer believe in this being a duty & so I mean to leave 
at the end of the campaign as I said if I'm not killed be- 
fore. 1 Remember I am now at H.Q. 6th C. & it is Major 
Gen 1 W. Comdg 

1 Writing to Charles Eliot Norton on April 17, 1864, and expressing 
appreciation of Norton's article in the North American Review for 
April on St. Louis and Joinville, Holmes had said: 

"I have long wanted to know more of Joinville's Chronicle than I did, 
but the story seems to come up most opportunely now when we need all 
the examples of chivalry to help us bind our rebellious desires to stead- 
fastness in the Christian Crusade of the 19** century. If one didn't be- 
lieve that this war was such a crusade, in the cause of the whole civil- 
ized world, it would be hard indeed to keep the hand to the sword; and 
one who is rather compelled unwillingly to the work by abstract con- 
viction than borne along on the flood of some passionate enthusiasm, 
must feel his ardor rekindled by stories like this. ... In all probability 
from what I hear of the filling up of the Regt. I shall soon be mustered 
in for a new term of service as Lt. Col. of the ioth and so with double 
reason I am thankful to read of the great dead who have 'stood in the 
evil day,' No it will not do to leave Palestine yet." The original of this 
letter is in the possession of the Houghton Library, Harvard University 
and is reprinted here with the University's permission. 



123 

The duties & thoughts of the field are of such a 
nature that one cannot at the same time keep home, par- 
ents and such thoughts as they suggest in his mind at the 
same time as a reality Can hardly indeed remember 
their existence and this too just after the intense yearn- 
ing which immediately precedes a campaign Still your 
letters are the one pleasure & you know my love

the end of my term of service) then I probably shall

such a misunderstanding, so discreditable to my feeling 
of soldierly honor, when I don't believe there was a

notify the Governor to commission new field officers 
to the 2Oth I waive promotion I am convinced from 
my late experience that if I can stand the wear & tear 
(body & mind) of regimental duty that it is a greater 
strain on both than I am called on to endure If I am 
satisfied I don't really see that anyone else has a call to 
be otherwise I talked with Hayward the mentor of 
the Regt & told him my views on the matter I am not 
the same man (may not have quite the same ideas) & 
certainly am not so elastic as I was and I 'will not ac-

desk that is I will write if the enemy will give me time 
and not go pitching shell & roundshot round our H.Q. 
as they have been doing earlier this xnorn'g, and if they 
will keep decently quiet on the front line of works. A 
cheerful place the latter, by the way, to be sent to after 
breakfast to inspect & report on progress You show 
your nose anywhere and sizzle come the bullets at it in 
less than the twinkling of a bedpost and they shoot 
pretty well on both sides now, However I am so much 
safer than any inf t y officer that I don't grumble but also 
feel that I am earning less honor though learning much 
more 

But fortunately I have a jewel in the head of this 
campaign in the shape of my adventure of Sunday week 
ago For let me tell you what I wouldn't before as I 
was a little irritated, that, although I am not aware of the 
General's knowing the particulars, the staff to whom I 
spun my yarn intimated that they thought it rather a 
gallant thing, & it was I think myself to get the order 
through & not knock under or turn back 

These days of comparative rest though constant 
loss allow my thoughts to turn longingly & lovingly 
homeward again which they couldn't as I told you 
in the wear and tear of alternate march and fight. 

The campaign has been most terrible yet believe 
me I was not demoralized when I announced my inten- 
tion to leave the service next winter if I lived so long 
I started in this thing a boy I am now a man and I have 



been coming to the conclusion for the last six months 
that my duty has changed 

I can do a disagreeable thing or face a great danger 
coolly enough when I know it is a duty but a doubt 
demoralizes me as it does any nervous man and now 
I honestly think the duty of fighting has ceased for me 
ceased because I have laboriously and with much suffer- 
ing of mind and body earned the right which I denied 
Willy Everett 1 to decide for myself how I can best do 
my duty to myself to the country and, if you choose, 
to God 

I believe that Governor Andrew understands my 
determination to waive promotion please be sure he 
does so The ostensible and sufficient reason is my hon- 
est belief that I cannot now endure the labors & hard- 
ships of the line 2 Nothing further need be told 
abroad 

I hope that this will meet your approbation you 
are so sure to be right at all events I have tried to de- 
cide conscientiously & I have decided

spent the Civil War studying in England. 

3 Writing to his friend Agnes Pomeroy of Pittsfield on June 21, 1864, 
Holmes said: 

"Do you know I shall never wear the "20" again? ... I have written the 
Governor that I waive promotion. I find myself too weak from previ- 
ous campaigns to do the duties of an officer of the line properly. Our 
medical director (6th C) told me the other day that I was not keeping 
up by the strength of my constitution now but by the stimulus of this 
constant pressure to which we have been subjected." This letter is 
quoted by kind permission of Miss Edith Bardett of Pittsfield, daughter 
of General Bardett and Agnes (Pomeroy) Bardett.

are good though he is a nasty toadying snob like

These last few days have been very bad This morn'g

going to say of the men I tell you many a man has gone 

a The 3rd Division of General William F. Smith's Eighteenth Corps, 
commanded by Brigadier General Edward W. Hinks, included two 
Brigades of Negro Troops which had played an important and gallant 
part in the Petersburg operations. 

8 Selected letters of Charles A. Page were later published in Letters of 
a. War Correspondent (1899), edited by J. R. Gilmore. In his dispatch 
of July 20, 1864, Page, speaking of the departure of the 20th Regiment 
on expiration of its service, said of Holmes: 

Practically, the most important consideration is tht t so many trained 
and valuable officers are thus lost to the service. Of the Twentieth, 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. ... was an officer. Captain Holmes served 
more than two years steadily and chivalrously as a line officer, was 
three times severely wounded, and in this campaign has been zealous 
and indefatigable as a member of the Sixth Corps staff, has always been 
conspicuously daring, and capably efficient, and he goes out of service 
because his regiment does, not because he would taste the sweets of home 
and Boston." (Id. pp. 176-177.)

I think the Army feels better than it might but theres 
no use in disguising that the feeling for McClellan has

to Washington to meet Early's threat on the city from the north. 
Units of the Corps arrived just in time to repulse the attack at Fort 
Stevens on July 12. The Sixth Corps did not thereafter return to the 
Army of the Potomac and General Wright assumed a new command in 
the Shenandoah Campaign.

Capt. of Inft y having given up promotion for the sake 
of leaving the line I might, to be sure, stay longer if I 
were one of the 3 aides allowed the Gen ls by law but as 
Fm not and am liable to go back to the Regt if any 
change sh d take place, I leave If it should be necessary 
to go into the service again I should try for a commis-
