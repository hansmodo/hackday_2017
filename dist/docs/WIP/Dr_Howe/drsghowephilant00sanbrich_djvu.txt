PREFACE. 



IN writing this biography of Dr. Howe, I have kept 
in view two or three things of which it may be well 
to notify my readers. As the family of Dr. Howe 
are preparing a more extended biography, with 
many extracts from letters and journals, I have not 
made much use of these sources of information, 
unless I found them in print at the time, or soon 
after the time, when they were written. But I have 
made free use of the memorial volume which the 
friends of Dr. Howe printed just after his death, in 
1876, and which I edited for the Memorial Com 
mittee. For that volume Mrs. Howe wrote, at our 
request, a short memoir, which I have used, without 
hesitation, and sometimes without acknowledgment, 
in the following pages. I have also had access to a 
great mass of papers concerning John Brown and his 
campaigns in Kansas and Virginia, some of which, 
although used in my " Life and Letters of John 
Brown " (Boston, Roberts Brothers, 1885), I have 
again made use of in this volume, taking the material 
from my former book in which the same facts were 
more fully set forth. I have added, however, some 
particulars, concerning Wendell Phillips and Gov 
ernor Andrew, of Massachusetts, which have not 
before been made public. 



IV PREFACE. 

The career of Dr. Howe covered so many years and 
so many exploits that I have been compelled to leave 
untold much that would have illustrated his character, 
and would have added material facts to the history 
of his life. But while doing this, I have felt at lib 
erty to introduce other information, little known or 
perhaps entirely forgotten, if it threw light on the 
period of which I was writing, or, sometimes, ex 
plained the* attitude taken by Dr. Howe and his 
friends, at critical moments of the political conflict 
in which they were engaged for so many years. 
The address prepared by Daniel Webster, for the 
Anti-Texas Convention at Faneuil Hall, in 1845, is 
the longest of these digressions from the forward 
course of Dr. Howe s biography; but the value of this 
paper, and the varying connection of its author with 
the great struggle for human freedom which followed 
its publication, made it seem needful to introduce it. 
So far as I know, it has never been reprinted since 
1845, an d the fact that it originated with Mr. Web 
ster, though several times made public, has hardly 
impressed itself on our political history. I am 
indebted to Mr. Stephen H. Phillips, of Salem, for 
the facts concerning it. 

I have quoted the language of Dr. Howe wherever 
I could, in preference to using my own, in order to 
exhibit as fully as possible his intellectual character, 
to which his writings were an imperfect index, but 
an indispensable one. Few men could write more 
forcibly or reason more logically than he ; and yet 
scarcely any man seemed, at times, to be so careless 
of the written word as Dr. Howe was. My own 
acquaintance with him began in 1852, and was very 



PREFACE. v 

intimate from about 1856 until his death. I can, 
therefore, speak with some confidence of those traits 
in his character which were prominent after he 
reached the age of fifty ; but for his youthful career, 
I have depended on his own statements to me, on the 
testimony of others, and on the general knowledge 
that early experiences and long-continued observa 
tion in that region which romantic and chivalrous 
natures frequent, may have given me. It has fallen 
to my lot to know, both in youth and in age, several 
of the most romantic characters of our century ; and 
among these one of the most romantic was certainly 
the hero of these pages. That he was indeed a hero, 
the events of his life sufficiently declare ; that he had 
other traits less uncommon and more practical, I 
have occasionally intimated in the course of this nar 
ration. Like his nature, his fortunes were romantic ; 
and very few men of our century hardly even Gari 
baldi or John Brown have connected their names 
with so much that was at once adventurous, momen 
tous, and permanently successful. 

My thanks are especially due to Mrs. Howe and 
her daughters, to Dr. Michael Anagnos, her son- 
in-law, and to Dr. Howe s dear friend and my own, 
Mr. Francis William Bird, of East Walpole, for 
invaluable aid in performing what has been to all of 
us a labor of love.

THE MAIDEN. 

O for a knight like Bayard, 

Without reproach or fear ; 
My light glove on his casque of steel, 
My love-knot on his spear ! 

O for the white plume floating 
Sad Zutphen s field above, 
The lion heart in battle, 

The woman s heart in love !" 

THE POET. 

Smile not, fair unbeliever ! 

One man, at least, I know, 

Might wear the crest of Bayard 

Or Sidney s plume of snow. 

Wherever outraged nature 

Asks word or action brave, 
Wherever struggles labor, 

Wherever groans a slave, 

Wherever rise the peoples, 

Wherever sinks a throne, 
The throbbing heart of Freedom finds 

An answer in his own."

DR. S. G. HOWE.

CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH. 

DR. HOWE, like Dr. Franklin, was born in Bos 
ton, something less than a century after that world- 
renowned printer, philosopher, and statesman saw the 
light, and not quite twelve years after Franklin s 
death. His birthday was November 10, 1801 ; his 
parents were of the same sturdy middle class to 
which Josiah Franklin and Abigail Folger belonged, 
and their names were Joseph Howe and Patty Grid- 
ley. His father was a rope-maker, whose business 
became very large at one time, especially during the 
war with England, when he furnished the National 
Government with great quantities of cordage for the 
navy which, under Hull, Decatur, and Stewart, won 
such renown in fighting the hitherto invincible Brit 
ish armed vessels. Mrs. Howe was connected with 
the more distinguished family of Jeremy and Richard 
Gridley the former attorney-general of the royal 
province of Massachusetts Bay, and the latter, a 
soldier and engineer, who served at the taking of 
Louisburg by Sir William Pepperrell in 1745, con- 



12 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

structed the fortifications of Col. Prescott at Bunker 
Hill, in 1775, and had his share in the siege-works by 
which Washington in 1776 forced the British army to 
evacuate Boston. It was from his mother that Dr. 
Howe inherited his singular beauty of person in 
youth; and from that martial family came also, per 
haps, his love of adventure and his courage in war. 
His father was a just and frugal man, of strong dem 
ocratic opinions, which were not then fashionable in 
Boston ; and for this reason he did not educate his 
famous son at Harvard College, which was then 
under strong Federalist influences. But he first sent 
him to the grammar school, " that his life might be 
rooted in the common ground with his fellow-citizens." 
This school was originally one whose course of 
instruction was laid down in 1784 by a committee of 
which Samuel Adams was a member. Dilworth s 
spelling-book, containing a brief treatise on English 
grammar, was the only text-book first required. 
Arithmetic included vulgar and decimal fractions ; 
while the Bible and Psalter were the only reading- 
books. In 1812 he entered the Latin School, a pecu 
liar Boston institution, founded in the very earliest 
period of her history, and very serviceable for centu 
ries in keeping up the standard of classical learning ; 
but this also was then controlled by the same partisan 
influences which prevailed at Harvard. 

It was a period when political faction raged fiercely 
in the nation, and especially in Boston. The French 
Revolution had aroused the greatest activity of 
thought on political and social questions, and the 
party divisions of that day represented opposite sides 
of the most important problems of social and politi- 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 13 

cal economy. While the Democrats held those gener 
ous views which captivate the young mind, on the 
other side was an august array of personal character 
and historic reputation ; so that, as Emerson after 
wards said, " One party had the best ideas and the 
other the best men." All the boys in the Latin School 
at one period of young Howe s course there were 
Federalists but two or three ; and these were set upon 
one day by the tyrannical majority, and threatened 
with severe castigation if they did not forswear dem 
ocracy and denounce Madison and the war of 1812. 
One of the persecuted minority yielded to the inquis 
ition ; but Sam Howe, though only twelve years old, 
held his opinions too firmly to be driven out of them, 
and was hurried to the head of the stairs and thrown 
down headlong with no interference on the part of 
the Principal, Benjamin Apthorp Gould; of whose 
rough manners and discipline he always retained a 
vivid recollection. He used to relate that, having 
once caught him in some offence, the master pro 
ceeded to correct him severely with a ferule, saying 
that he would make him cry. The little boy at first 
resisted by an effort of will ; then, as the pain became 
extreme, his excitement and indignation were so 
great, that the tears refused to flow, and the poor 
little hand was beaten almost to a jelly. 

During his school life, the British cruisers could be 
daily seen in the harbor, and volunteer companies 
were engaged in defending commerce and in build 
ing forts. One day Master Gould, who was a patriot, 
although a Federalist, took his boys out to spend the 
school hours in helping to throw up defences against 
the enemy at Noddle s Island, now East Boston. 



14 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Howe s home was on Pleasant street, not far from 
where the Providence Station now is, and his father s 
rope-walk was on the Back Bay, where now the Pub 
lic Garden extends. The city was then but a town 
of 35,000 people (in 1813), including only the penin 
sula, and answering well to Emerson s description of 
it : 

" The rocky nook, with hill-tops three, 
Looked eastward from the farms, 
And twice each day the flowing 1 sea 
Took Boston in its arms." 

Nature yet lay all about it ; and the homely little 
town itself was like a family association, where every 
man knew his neighbor. The Common was still the 
training-ground and cow-pasture, and the boys 
roamed freely over it, with no caution to " keep off 
the grass." In the Back Bay, with its shallow waters 
which deepened dangerously as the tide came in, Sam 
Howe was once paddling about on a plank or a cake 
of ice, or in a rude bateau, such as Ellery Channing 
kept moored there a few years later, when he fell in, 
and just escaped drowning. He was fished out and 
carried to his father s great rope-walk near by ; when 
the stern parent bade him " run home and tell your 
mother to whip you." In his later years, when he 
told his children and grandchildren this story, he 
used to add : "I ran home, but my mother did not 
whip me," and the tone of his voice expressed the 
safety and sweetness of that mother s love, which the 
passage of years and the scenes of a life crowded with 
interest had only made dearer and more wonderful to 
him. His father was a man of sense, but of whims 
and strong prejudices. When it was time to send 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 15 

one of his sons to college, he decided the choice 
between them in an odd manner. Mrs. Hall, Dr. 
Howe s eldest surviving child, says: 1 

" He called up his sons and bade them each read 
aloud from the big family Bible the one who read 
best was to go to college. My father won the day 
without much difficulty, I imagine, for he always 
read aloud with much feeling, and yet very simply. 
What a treat it used to be to us, his children, when in 
later years he read aloud to us Scott s poetry, of 
which he was extremely fond. Even we girls 
felt a warlike spirit stir within us as he read the war- 
song of 

" Roderigh Vich Alpine dhu, ho ! ieroe ! " 

while we could hardly keep back our tears when he 
read the tender and gentle passages of " The Lady of 
the Lake," or that exquisite song from " Rokeby," 
" O, Lady, weave no wreath for me, 
Or weave it of the cypress-tree." 

Howe entered at Brown University in 1817, the 
same year that Waldo Emerson, eighteen months 
younger, entered at Harvard, and the two Boston 
boys of genius graduated in the same year, 1821. 
Neither distinguished himself greatly in college, ex 
cept that Howe, in his little college at Providence, 
among the earnest Baptists, was noted for pranks 
and penalties. Rev. Dr. Caswell, who was afterwards 
President of the same college, thus described his 
appearance and conduct there: 

"Dr. Howe, though a younger man than myself, 
graduated one year before me. We were three years

together in the university. I knew him well, and 
esteemed him highly for many marked traits of char 
acter. He was a mere stripling, but nature had been 
generous in giving him an attractive physique. He 
was of middling height, slender in form, erect, agile, 
and elastic in his movements. With fine features, a 
fresh, pink complexion, a keen blue eye, full of pur 
pose and meaning, and of mirth as well ; with open, 
frank, and genial manners, he could not fail to win 
the kind regard of his youthful companions. He 
showed mental capabilities which would naturally fit 
him for fine scholarship. His mind was quick, ver 
satile, and inventive. I do not think he was deficient 
in logical power, but the severer studies did not seem 
to be congenial to him. In all practical matters he 
saw intuitively and at a glance what was the best 
thing to be done. In any strait or difficulty, or 
any sudden emergency of danger, if there was any 
possible way of escape, nobody need inform him what 
it was. Before anybody else had time to think, his 
plan was formed. 

" He had a full share of general knowledge, without 
exact scholarship. His college life strikingly devel 
oped some of the mental characteristics which ulti 
mately made him what he was. In some men wit is 
spontaneous and irrepressible. It would be as im 
possible to suppress a good joke, or a keen repartee, 
as to suppress the law of gravitation. On the con 
trary, there are many sensible men who never laugh 
at a joke or a witticism, however brilliant, for the 
reason that, innocently enough, they see nothing to 
laugh at. Their perceptions are shut up to plain 
matters of fact. Dr. Howe, with a heart as good and 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 17 

generous, as free from malice and evil as any man s, 
unless we except those few rare characters who are 
too good to live in such a world as this had, never 
theless, an insatiable fondness for fun and frolic, and 
a good practical joke. Tricks are proverbial in col 
leges. And in almost every college there will be some 
one whose natural endowments, with a little practice, 
make him an acknowledged leader. Dr. Howe rather 
belonged to this class. With singular sagacity, he 
saw every opportunity of producing a sensation, and 
breaking up the dull routine of college life, and it 
was no sooner seen than embraced; no matter upon 
whom the laugh turned, whether upon a classmate or 
a tutor, or upon the venerable head of the university 
himself. On such occasions his invention, and ex 
pedients, and adroitness were matters for study and 
surprise. He was himself very modest and taciturn 
with regard to any merit or cleverness of these inci 
dental performances. His own impression seemed to 
be that they were merely common place affairs, and 
that anybody else would succeed as well as he. 

" For some misdemeanors attributed to him, he was 
once or twice sent into the country " rusticated " 
was the term to study a few weeks with some staid 
minister, who retained some knowledge of the curri 
culum of college studies. But this temporary exile 
did not sensibly diminish his resources in this line of 
amusement. In fact, it rather increased them. The 
pent-up energies, which it were unseemly to expend 
upon a plain country minister and his family, found 
a ready outlet in college. It is certain that the pulsa 
tions of college life were quickened by his return from 
exile. 



1 8 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

"I may here give the outline of a single anecdote, 
which I have more than once heard Dr. Howe relate 
with graphic effect. It shows the impression which 
he left behind him. Some years after Howe had left 
college, and after he had become widely and favor 
ably known to the public, he was in Providence 
attending the annual commencement. He thought 
he would call on his old president, Dr. Messer, then 
living in retirement, and apologize to him for the 
trouble he had given him while in college, and the 
many interruptions to his nightly repose for, in 
truth he bore no malice, and always had a kindly 
feeling towards the good Doctor. He called, but the 
venerable instructor of his youth received him with 
evident marks of distrust, requested him to be 
seated, but took a seat himself at a respectful distance. 
Howe commenced his apology, when the good Doctor, 
moving his chair a little further back, said: " Howe, 
I m afraid of you now. I m afraid there will be a 
torpedo under my chair before I know it." 

"Dr. Howe regretted his waste of time, and the loss 
of precious opportunities ; but said in explanation, 
that before he had been many months in college, he 
found that he was suspected of all the mischief there, 
when, in fact, but a small part of it was his. His 
honest and truthful statements were set aside and 
disregarded, and he was made a sort of college scape 
goat to bear off the sins of others. Under that state 
of things, he felt a greater freedom in displaying his 
skill, and keeping up his reputation, than he could 
otherwise have justified A little parental advice, a 
little kindly treatment, and, more than all, a little 
confidence in his honor and honesty, would have done, 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 19 

more to correct his foibles, than all the college cen 
sures that could be imposed upon him. 

"He was highly esteemed by his college associates. 
His presence was always welcome among them. He 
had a certain indefinable magnet-power that drew 
them round him. They were proud of his singular 
success in an original and untrodden path of benevo 
lence. No one doubted that his extraordinary men 
tal activity, and his large executive capacity, would 
lead to distinction in some way. But in what way, 
none could conjecture. Few, probably, anticipated 
that he would become an eminent philanthropist, and 
that his life would be nobly given to the relief and 
comfort of the unfortunate." 

It must not be supposed that the young collegian 
wholly wasted his time. He had been well-drilled in 
Latin in Boston, and had learned something of Greek 
and of French; and his graduation left him a good 
Latin scholar for that period, and with the rudi 
ments of that polyglot facility in modern languages, 
including the degenerate Greek of the Morea in 1824, 
which he afterwards acquired. His acquaintance with 
French became masterly, and he was fairly versed in 
German, Italian, and Turkish ; of Spanish he had 
some scantling, and neither Scandinavian nor Rus 
sian were quite unknown to him. His mind was 
a scholar s instrument; intuitive, analytic, and quick 
to proceed from the known to the unknown. Prob 
ably the French people, and the Greeks, who are the 
French of the Levant, had the strongest influence upon 
his style, which was livelier and keener than English 
is usually found, far more so than the New England 
rhetoric of his boyhood and youth. But in English 



20 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

he had read all the great books the Bible, Shake 
speare, Milton, Bunyan, and the poets of his own 
times; especially Scott, Campbell, Moore, and Byron. 
He wrote rapidly, nervously, and rather impatiently; 
as the letters to be quoted in the next chapter suffici 
ently show. 

A great influence in Dr. Howe s college days, and 
for years afterward, was Edward Everett, who had 
returned from Germany full of enthusiasm for learn 
ing and had associated himself at Harvard College 
with two older professors, Edward Channing, brother 
of the celebrated divine, and George Ticknor, who 
preceded Longfellow and Lowell in their fruitful 
professorship of modern languages at Cambridge. 
It was with a letter from Everett that young Howe 
sailed for Greece in 1824, and their acquaintance in 
the narrow circle of Boston society may have been 
intimate, as their correspondence afterwards became. 
Everett s indifference to the great anti - slavery 
struggle (in which Howe embarked in middle life), 
destroyed so much of his personal influence after 
1850, that it is difficult to realize that his eloquence 
aroused the enthusiasm of Emerson and Howe, of 
Elizabeth Peabody and Margaret Fuller. But Ever 
ett had not then lost the faith and love of youth, and 
he may have helped young men to that temperance 
of thought and sobriety of manner which blend hap 
pily with earnestness and enthusiasm. Dr. Channing 
in 1820 was preaching in his Federal Street Church, 
and Everett, leaving his pulpit in Boston, had become 
a professor at Cambridge, from which town he en 
tered Congress in 1825, and in due time became Gov 
ernor of Massachusetts. Of his appearance and man- 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 21 

ner at that period when Howe came under his spell, 
Emerson has left us the most pleasing description. 

"There was an influence on young people in Bos 
ton, from the genius of Everett, which was almost 
comparable to that of Pericles in Athens. He had an 
inspiration which did not go beyond his head, but 
which made him the master of elegance. If any of 
my readers were at that period in Boston or Cam 
bridge, they will easily remember his radiant beauty 
of person, of a classic style ; his heavy large eye, 
marble lids which gave the impression of mass 
that the slightness of his form needed ; sculptured 
lips; a voice of such rich tones, such precise and per 
fect utterance, that, although slightly nasal, it was the 
most mellow and beautiful and correct of all the 
instruments of the time. The word that he spoke, in 
the manner in which he spoke it, became current and 
classical in New England. . . . He had nothing in 
common with vulgarity or infirmity; but, speak 
ing, walking, sitting, was as much aloof and uncom 
mon as a star. The smallest anecdote of his conver 
sation or behavior was eagerly caught and repeated ; 
and every young scholar could recite brilliant sen 
tences from his sermons, with mimicry, good or bad, 
of his voice. Every youth was his defender, and boys 
filled their mouths with arguments to prove that the 
orator had a heart." 

Returning from Providence to Boston in the sum 
mer of 1821, Howe became a medical student with 
Dr. Ingalls, who was then conspicuous among the 
good physicians and surgeons of Boston the list 
including Dr. John Jeffries, Dr. John C. Warren, Dr. 
James Jackson, Dr. Walter Channing, and Dr. Jacob

Bigelow. Several of these were his teachers in medi 
cine, and another, who was then well known for his 
learning and his special acquaintance with insanity 
Dr. George Parkman who, thirty years later was 
unhappily famous as the victim of a murder ; his 
assassin being a Harvard professor, Dr. Webster. 
Howe learned rapidly, studied more seriously than he 
had in college, and in 1824 took his medical degree 
at Harvard, in a class of seventeen, of which he was 
the only distinguished member. He never practised 
to any extent in Boston, however, but in 1824, at the 
age of twenty-three, he obtained his father s reluctant 
consent, together with a small sum of money, and set 
sail for Greece, to take part in the bloody contest 
then waging in the country of Leonidas and 
Epaminondas, 



CHAPTER II. 

THE CHEVALIER EARNING HIS SPURS. 

BYRON had roused all Europe and America, a dozen 
years before, to the glory, the beauty, and the tragedy 
of the Grecian lands ; and in his " Don Juan," which 
came out while Howe was in college, he had returned 
to the theme of his early inspiration. Howe, like 
Emerson, and like all young men of imagination at 
that period, was an admirer of Byron, and shared his 
enthusiasm for Greece ; and now there was new 
cause to admire her people. 

In 1821, the year in which Howe graduated, the 
Christian world was electrified to hear that Greece, 
which for centuries had ceased to be anything more 
than what Metternich called Italy, " a geographical 
expression," had turned on her oppressor, and was 
struggling for independence. " Greek youths had 
been studying in German universities, and had there 
learned of the glories of their ancestry, and caught 
from Gothic lips the old Hellenic fire. A Greek 
scholar and bishop had raised the standard of revolt 
in the Morea, and all along the glorious Peninsula, 
from Corinth to Athens, and from Athens to Olym 
pus, the whisper ran that Greece might still be free, 
and the resolution was formed that free she should 



24 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

be, if resistance unto death could make her so." In 
Western Europe, and especially in Germany, there 
was among scholars an intense sympathy with the 
struggling patriots. A Leipzig professor published a 
thesis, " The Cause of Greece the Cause of Europe," 
and preached a new crusade against the Mussulman. 
Notably Lord Byron, chief of English philhellenes, 
threw his sword into the scale of their doubtful for 
tunes, and on the soil which his grandest strains had 
celebrated, earned, as he said, 

" Less often sought than found, 
A soldier s grave." 

In the year when that grave was found, when Gre 
cian earth had received what was mortal of the 
mighty poet, in 1824, Dr. Howe, having finished his 
preparatory medical studies, offered his services to 
the patriot army. * 

Byron left Genoa for Greece in June, 1823, but he 
lingered long in Corfu, and did not reach Missolonghi 
on the west coast of Acarnania, until January 5, 1825. 
He was accompanied by Trelawny, the romantic 
and herculean Cornish gentleman who had begun life 
as a midshipman under Nelson, then turned pirate, 
then man of letters, and finally found his vocation as 
the friend and chronicler of Shelley and Byron. He 
long survived them both, and his ashes are now buried 
beside Shelley s in the beautiful Protestant cemetery 
at Rome, near the Pyramid of Caius Cestius. Byron 
did not live long enough to go with Trelawny to 
visit the famous chieftain Odysseus at Salona, near

1824, some months before Howe s arrival at Navarino. 
Trelawny went on into Central Greece, became in 
timate with Odysseus, married his sister, and was left 
by him in charge of his stronghold, a cavern on Par 
nassus, not many miles from Lebadea in Bceotia ; 
where, in May, 1825, Howe, with a party of Greek 
soldiers endeavored to capture Trelawny, as will be 
related hereafter. But so much was to be said here, 
inasmuch as rumor and romance have represented 
that Byron and Howe fought side by side in Greece. 
In fact they never met. 

Concerning Dr. Howe s motives for this serious de 
parture from a Boston physician s usual course, Mrs. 
Howe says: 

" The example of Lord Byron had given a high po 
etic sanction to the crusade of the philhellenes, and this 
no doubt had its weight with our young hero, who 
was a passionate admirer of the English bard. But 
the same enthusiasm for human freedom, the same 
zeal for human deliverance, appearing in every im 
portant act of his later life, attests the originality and 
fervor of his philanthropic inspiration. Dr. Howe 
found in those about him little encouragement for an 
undertaking so new and unaccustomed. He used to 
mention Gilbert Stuart, the distinguished painter, 
with gratitude, as almost the only friend of those days 
who bade him Godspeed. Strong in his own con 
viction and intention, he embarked on board a brig 
bound for the Mediterranean, and, landing at Malta, 
took passage in an Austrian vessel to Napoli de Mon- 
embasia (Navarino) in the Peloponnesus. From this 
place, he succeeded in pushing his way to the head 
quarters of the provincial government, assisted only

by a letter of introduction from Edward Everett to a 
Greek acquaintance of his, formerly resident in Ger 
many." 1 

Dr. Howe landed near Navarino, and made his ap 
pearance at Tripolitsa in the autumn of 1824. He 
says in his autobiography: 

"In the winter, the much-dreaded expedition of 
Ibrahim Pacha, with the Egyptian army, landed at 
Modon. Attempts were made by the Greek govern 
ment to get up an army to oppose them, and Mavro- 
cordato accepted my offer to go with them as surgeon. 
The President and Mavrocordato came to the south 
of Peloponnesus with such forces as they could raise. 
At first there was an attempt to organize the army, 
and I attempted to create hospitals and to organize 
ambulances for the wounded. But after the capture 
of Navarino by the Turks, everything was thrown into 
confusion. Mavrocordato fled to Napoli de Romania. 
The dark days of Greece had come. All regular op 
position of the Greeks was overcome. The Turks 
advanced fiercely and rapidly up the Peloponnesus. 
I joined one of the small guerilla bands that hung 
about the enemy, doing all the harm they could. I 
could be of little or no use as surgeon, and was ex 
pected to divide my attention between killing Turks, 
helping Greeks, and taking care of my bacon. I was 
naturally very hardy, active, and tough, and soon be 
came equal to any of the mountain soldiery in capac 
ity for endurance of fatigue, hunger, and watchful 
ness. I could carry my gun and heavy belt, with ya-

tory of the Greek Revolutian."

tagan and pistols, all day long, clambering among the 
mountain passes; could eat sorrel and snails, or go 
without anything, and at night lie down on the ground 
with only my shaggy capote, and sleep like a log." 1 

Mavrocordato was the well-known prince of that 
name who was as much at the head of the Greek revo 
lutionary government as any of the dozen or twenty 
chieftains, sailors, or merchants, who held that posi 
tion from time to time. It was he who received By 
ron at Missolonghi, where Mavrocordato had landed 
from Marseilles, in June, 1821, with arms, ammuni 
tion, and a number of young Frenchmen, eager to win 
glory in the revolution that was then beginning. He 
was made President of the Executive Council in 1822, 
and he continued, in various stations, to take a lead 
ing part in the government of Greece until his 
final retirement from public life in 1856. He was 
ten years older than Dr. Howe, and he died in 1865. 

When he left Boston Dr. Howe had no knowledge 
whatever of modern Greek, which was then a jargon 
much less resembling the language of Pericles than 
it does to-day. His acquaintance with classic Greek 
was not extensive, nor could it help him much, be 
cause nobody then pronounced it by accent in Amer 
ica, while the Greeks themselves, besides the other 
variations, accented every word as it was written. He 
related, with a blush, in after years, that the first 
phrase which he fairly understood, was a compliment 
to himself, uttered by an old chieftain to one of his 
men, as they lay about the camp-fire in Arcadia. "What

a handsome youth! " said the Palikari, " Ti eumorphon 
paidi ! " His personal beauty, at this time, and for years 
after, was remarkable: and the Greeks of to-day, like 
their ancestors, are very susceptible. But they were not 
very clean, nor well clad, nor well fed; they had few 
changes of raiment, infrequent washing days, and a 
larder often very poorly stocked. Dr. .Howe said, 
thirty years after: 

" I knew more than once what probably you never 
had any realizing sense of, to-wit, the sharp gnaw- 
ings of real hunger. You know only what a good ap 
petite is; you don t know what a ravening vulture it 
becomes when it grows bad. I have been months 
without eating other flesh than mountain snails, or 
roasted wasps; weeks without bread, and days with 
out a morsel of food of any kind. Woe to the stray 
donkey or goat that fell within our reach then; they 
were quickly slain, and their flesh cut up hastily in 
little square bits, was roasting on our ramrods, or 
devoured half raw." 

Yet, amid all the privations and dangers of his 
guerilla life for the Greek armies were generally but 
guerilla bands the young volunteer preserved his 
health, his good spirits and his good New England 
habits. He became, like the Greeks themselves, as 
nimble as the mountain goat ; he became also an 
accomplished horseman, a good shot, a beau sabreur, 
and, with only one silk shirt and very ragged Alba 
nian fustinella and leggings, he displayed the knightly 
qualities as handsomely as if he had worn chain- 
armor, or carried lance in rest, like Amadis and King 
Arthur in the romances. The incident which Whit- 
tier has turned into verse was an actual occurrence 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 29 

in the year 1825, and was related by Howe, many 
years after, to Charles Sumner, who told the story to 
Whittier. The scene, as we know from a paper of 
Howe, in the " New England Magazine " for Septem 
ber, 1831, was near Calamata, in the Southern part of 
the Peloponnesus, soon after the fall of Navarino, 
May 9, 1825 : 

" Once, when over purple mountains 

Died away the Grecian sun, 
And the far Cyllenian ranges 

Paled and darkened, one by one, 

" Fell the Turk, a bolt of thunder, 

Cleaving all the quiet sky, 
And against his sharp steel lightnings 
Stood the Suliote but to die. 

" Woe for the weak and halting ! 

The crescent blazed behind 
A curving line of sabres, 
Like fire before the wind ! 

" Last to fly and first to rally, 
Rode he of whom I speak, 
When, groaning in his bridle-path, 
Sank down a wounded Greek. 

" With the rich Albanian costume 

Wet with many a ghastly stain, 
Gazing on earth and sky as one 
Who might not gaze again ! 

" He looked forward to the mountains, 

Back on foes that never spare, 

Then flung him from the saddle, 

And placed the stranger there. 



30 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

" Allah ! hu ! Through flashing sabres, 

Through a stormy hail of lead, 
The good Thessalian charger 
Up the slopes of olives sped. 

" Hot spurred the turbanned riders; 

He almost felt their breath, 
Where a mountain stream rolled darkly down 
Between the hills and death. 

" One brave and manful struggle, 

He gained the solid land, 
And the cover of the mountains, 
And the carbines of his band ! " 

Dr. Howe, in his " History of the Greek Revolu 
tion," passes over in silence his own adventures, and 
gives no hint of this one. In a letter to Horace 
Mann, written in 1857, he says: " Sumner (Charles 
Sumner, the statesman) wormed out some of my 
adventures in Greece ; and one which he related to 
Whittier got embalmed and preserved, like an insect 
in amber. Out of very ordinary material the poet 
made quite a scene for example, transforming the 
sorry beast I rode into a gallant barb. The wounded 
soldier would, of course, have had his head hanging 
at the Turk s saddle-bow in a short time, if I had not 
mounted him on my beast ; and he always swore he 
owed me his life, and claimed the privilege of stick 
ing to me, and preventing any one but himself from 
picking and stealing my rations. But the affair was 
not worth embalming, save in Francesco s memory." 
Other people think otherwise about this, and will be 
grateful to Sumner and Whittier for preserving the 
incident. 

But Howe had himself told the story in an anony- 



YOUTHFUL DARJNG. 31 

mous contribution to the New England Magazine in 
1831. Here it is copied from the pages of that half- 
forgotten monthly the precursor, by a quarter of a 
century, of the Atlantic : 

Francesco s attachment to me was founded on gratitude, for 
I had the good fortune to be the means of saving his life. It 
was by chance at Calamata, after escaping from Navarino, 
when a sudden invasion of the Turks forced everyone to fly 
who could fly. I never shall forget the dreadful scene of con 
fusion and distress as I galloped through the town, accom 
panied by Ernest, a gallant young Swiss, for we passed many 
poor beings, old or sick, who were unable to fly on foot, and 
who stretched out their hands, praying for God s sake that we 
would save them. But selfishness and the pressing danger 
made us think only of saving our own lives. We had left the 
town, and were hurrying across the plain, which was covered 
with fugitives, when I beheld a wounded soldier sitting at the 
foot of an olive tree, pale, exhausted, and alirost fainting, but 
still grasping his long gun, as if he meant to have a last shot 
at the expected foe. It was Francesco, who had been dread 
fully wounded a few days before, and had staggered thus far 
from the temporary hospital at Calamata on hearing the alarm. 
The poor fellow cast a supplicating look at us as we passed, 
but said not a word. That look cut me to the soul. Had he 
presented his gun and demanded my horse it would not have 
so moved me.- I could not but turn my head after we passed 
him, and, seeing him still looking after us, as I thought, re 
proachfully, I pulled up my horse. On calculating the distance, 
I found I had time to gain the mountains. Of course, I turned 
back, mounted the poor fellow on my beast, and thus easily 
reaped the rich reward of his gratitude. 

We have in the same paper a description of Fran 
cesco s person and dress which might well answer for 
that of Howe himself, at the age of four and twenty, 
as he then was. "Francesco was in form and mind a 



32 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

true Greek. He had the light, well-made, active fig 
ure, the dark, yet clear complexion, the regular expres 
sive, and animated features, the keen and ever-rest 
less eye, that all indicate an active, enterprising mind, 
keen susceptibility and strong but short-lived passion. 
With his beautiful and glittering dress, his red cap 
and blue silk tassel ; his neck bare to his bosom, his 
long jet-black ringlets reaching to his shoulders ; his 
gold-laced close jacket, with sleeves slashed and 
thrown back so as to leave the right arm and shoul 
der bare ; the white kilt bound in at the waist with 
a blue silk sash, covered by a belt in which hung yat- 
agan and gilded pistols ; his embroidered garters and 
sandaled feet ; the white, shaggy capote hanging 
down from the left shoulder ; the long, light, bright- 
barreled gun in his right hand ; behold the Greek 
soldier with all his baggage equipped for a campaign!" 
Let us fasten this picture in our minds, or confirm it, 
if we can, by a visit to the portrait-gallery of the 
heroes at Athens, and we shall see young Howe as he 
was in 1825. 

In his "Historical Sketch of the Greek Revolution" 
(New York, 1828, but long out of print, and difficult 
to find, except in old libraries), Howe gives another 
picture of this warfare his last interview with 
Dikaios or " Papa Flesher " a priest turned fighter, 
who was one of the favorite leaders of the Greeks, in 
the Peloponnesus, till he fell at Agyia on the borders 
of Arcadia, in June, 1825. This must have been the 
campaign in which the adventure of Whittier s ballad 
occurred. Dr. Howe says : l 



" Historical Sketch," etc., p. 243. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 33 

The contrast between the first and last time I saw 
Flesher was striking. The first time I dined with him at 
Napoli (Nauplia). It was in the Oriental style, with all its pomp 
and fatiguing ceremonies ; but Flesher, by his graceful personal 
appearance and manners, threw an unusually attractive air about 
it. He lolled on his cushions and received the services which 
his attendants offered on their knees with all the nonchalance 
of a thorough Moslem. The last time was with a party of 
flying soldiers, after the fall of Navarino. It was midnight 
when we approached cautiously a hill, on the top of which a 
fire was burning brightly. The glowing embers of several 
others, scattered about, showed that some soldiers were there. 
It was doubtful who they were, but we knew the Turks to be 
advancing behind us, and were obliged to go on. As soon as 
we fell in with the outposts, we learned it was a Greek chief 
advancing to oppose Ibrahim Pasha. We were conducted up 
the hill, stepping over the soldiers, who, wrapped in their 
capotes, were sleeping soundly on the rocks, with flat stones for 
their pillows. On reaching the top, we found the chief, fully 
armed, sitting by the fire on a bit of carpet, gazing at the em 
bers. It was Flesher. He had heard of the alarming progress 
of Ibrahim, and, quitting the luxuries of his house, he rushed 
forward to meet him, and now was sitting in the open, damp 
air by his camp-fire at midnight, loaded with pistols and yata 
ghan, yet as much at ease and at home as when lolling on his 
sofa. 

In the same campaign Dr. Howe, wishing to show 
the .courage of Demetrius Ipselanti and of his Amer 
ican comrade, Colonel Miller, of Vermont, invol 
untarily discloses his own participation in a desperate, 
but successful, encounter near Argos. He says : l 

Arrived upon the plain of Argos, Ipselanti resolved to save 
the important position of the Mills (Myli) at whatever risk, 

i History, p. 247. 



34 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

but he could only find 200 men daring enough to join him. It 
is opposite Nauplia, across the Argolic Gulf, about twelve miles 
distant, where a little rill of clear water, issuing from the 
famous swamp of Lerna (where Hercules killed the hydra) 
gives a good mill privilege. Here were some mills, just on the 
seashore, surrounded by a wall and a garden with an outer 
wall. 1 Ipselanti despatched a boat to Nauplia for a reinforce 
ment, and the boat returned with only about twenty men 
hardy enough to volunteer. Among these were three Swiss 
and two Americans. The main part of the Turkish army had 
passed by without perceiving the importance of the Mills, or 
the danger of leaving such a position behind ; but the Greeks 
ventured out, and daringly discharged their muskets in defi 
ance. A division of 2,000 men was then ordered to take pos 
session of the place, and the cavalry came galloping up with 
out dreaming of much resistance. Being hotly received, they 
fell back, and the infantry, advancing, commenced a desperate 
attack. The Greeks, securely lodged in the Mills, poured forth 
such a shower of balls as staggered them, and it required all 
the efforts of their officers to keep them firm. At this moment, 
a party of Turks broke through the outer garden wall, on the 
extreme right of the Greek position, and were forming their 
line to charge on the flank, when eleven men (one of them an 
American, J. P. Miller, of Randolph, Vt., who had on other 
occasions distinguished himself for daring courage), who were 
posted behind the inner wall, threw away their muskets, and, 
jumping over the breastwork, rushed, sword in hand, upon the 
Turks. By the suddenness and impetuosity of their onset they 
completely drove the enemy from the garden, and saved the 
position. Three of the little band were wounded. 

In a note, Dr. Howe adds, concerning Colonel Mil 
ler, what was equally true of himself, viz.: "The un 
tiring zeal with which this gentleman has served the

where the fate of Waterloo and Napoleon was decided.

cause of the Greeks, at home and abroad, and the 
courage with which he invited dangerous service, 
has gained the gratitude of those who knew him, 
while the prudence of his deportment among the 
dissipated foreigners in Greece served to give the 
natives a good idea of the moral character of the 
Americans." In this respect they contrasted strongly 
with Byron and Trelawny, with Fenton and Whit- 
combe, who would have assassinated Trelawny, and 
with many of the French and German Philhellenes."* 



CHAPTER III. 

THE ROMANCE OF THE CAVERN ON PARNASSUS. 

THE whole region around the huge and wild range 
of mountains called Parnassus by the ancient Greeks, 
and Liakoura by the moderns, is wonderful and 
romantic, whether seen from the terrace of Delphi, 
from the valley of Amphissa (which Dr. Howe called 
Salona), from Arachova, famous for its barking dogs 
and beautiful women, or from Daulis and Velitsa, near 
which was the robber-cave of Odysseus or Ulysses, the 
chieftain of this century, who is almost as renowned in 
modern Greece as his namesake of Ithaca. It was a 
tract less familiar to Dr. Howe, in his Greek campaigns, 
than Attica and the Peloponnesus, or Corinth, where 
he planted his colony, in 1829; but he knew it well, and 
also the tragedy of its Parnassus cavern, which both 
he and the Englishman Trelawnyhave related. This 
is as good a place as any to give Dr. Howe s account 
of this strange affair, which led to Trelawny s depart 
ure from Greece, in 1826. The Englishman himself has 
described it in his memoirs, but the statement of Dr. 
Howe derives importance from the fact that he was 
in one of the parties that beset the mountain fast 
ness of Trelawny on Parnassus, and it was from his 
company that young Whitcombe went forth to join

Fenton in the plot which ended so disastrously for 
both. Dr. Howe says : * 

Ulysses had left his celebrated cavern on Parnassus, and the 
object of the Government (against whom he was in rebellion) 
was to get possession of his mountain retreat. This was most 
difficult to accomplish. Force could not effect it, starvation 
could not, for it was well supplied with provisions ; and as for 
fraud, it was not to be expected, for the cavern was held by an 
Englishman, Trelawny, who had so far ingratiated himself with 
Ulysses as to obtain the hand of his sister, and he now bid all 
Greece defiance. The capture of it was effected only after 
much lost time and the occurrence of deeds within it the rela 
tion of which appear more like romance than history. As my 
acquaintance with the parties gave me an opportunity to know 
all the particulars, I am induced to give them. Ulysses had, 
in the opinion of many, been false to his country. He had, it 
was asserted, tried to procure the assassination of Mavrocor- 
dato ; at any rate, he was virtually setting the Government at 
defiance, though keeping up the appearance of submission. 
His favorite resort and stronghold, which he preferred to the 
Acropolis of Athens (where he died), was a remarkable cavern 
on Parnassus, the entrance to which cannot be attained except 
by climbing up a precipice by the help of ladders. It is very 
spacious, and contains in one of the apartments a living spring. 
The rocks so hang down over the mouth of it that no shot or 
bomb can be thrown in. It is divided by nature into different 
apartments, and art has formed store-rooms, magazines, and 
everything necessary for a supply of provisions for years. 2 

Trelawny was left by Ulysses in possession of this cavern. 
Fenton was a Scot, a young man endowed with great personal 



1 History, pp. 251-54. 

2 The cave is evidently described from Howe s own observation; 
however, it is more fully described by Trelawny, and in the latest 
edition of his "Adventures of a Younger Son" (London, 1890) 
there is an engraving of it. 



38 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

advantages, but a cold-blooded, deliberate ruffian. He was ad 
mitted to the cavern by Trelawny, and became his pretended 
friend. He soon offered to go to Napoli (Nauplia) and act as 
a spy upon the Government, but he was at the same time in 
correspondence with the Government, through the agency of 
Mr. Jarvis, and had offered to procure the capture or death of 
Ulysses and the delivery of the cavern into the hands of the 
Government on the payment of a certain sum. On arriving at 
Napoli he had several interviews with Mavrocordato. What 
plans were agreed upon is not known, but, in some of his letters 
to Jarvis, Fenton had offered to kill Ulysses and Trelawny if 
necessary. After making his arrangements with Government, 
through Mavrocordato, then Secretary of State, Fenton induced 
the Government to issue a public order for him to quit Napoli 
in two hours as being a suspicious person. He then went to 
the cave and told Trelawny everything, and that he had per 
suaded Government he was sincere in his offer to murder his 
friend and benefactor. Of course, Trelawny would then dis 
credit any accounts he might hear of it, as he would not be 
lieve such baseness possible. Still, Fenton went on hatching 
his plot, and the strangest part of the story is that he chose for 
the instrument of his crime a young Englishman of family and 
education, and that the arch-villain should persuade him to it. 
His victim (for I must call Whitcombe the victim) was about 
nineteen years old, had been a midshipman in the British ser 
vice, 1 and had come to Greece burning \vith enthusiasm for 
her cause, and still more with a desire to distinguish himself by 
some daring act. He was full of vanity and ambition, bold 
and headstrong, indeed, but generous and proud, and I believe 
would then have shuddered at the bare thought of what he was 
afterwards induced to commit. He .left the party of soldiers 
with which we were, and, in the mere spirit of wandering, went 
near to the cavern of Ulysses. He was met by Fenton, and 
carried up to the cavern. In one single day Whitcombe be- 



1 So had Trelawny, which may have been a reason for letting 
Whitcombe escape. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 39 

came the admirer of Fenton ; thought him the noblest, the 
most romantic, the bravest of men ; in one day more he thought 
him injured and abused by Trelawny, learned to hate Trelawny, 
believed that Trelawny despised him, and meditated injuring 
him ; and on the third day he swore eternal friendship to Fen- 
ton, and that he would stand by him at all hazards in any at 
tempt to regain what he believed his right. Still Fenton did 
not dare propose his horrid plan. Two days more were passed 
in riot and drinking, and Whitcombe was excited by wild plans 
of power and of becoming prince of the surrounding province l 
if Fenton could become master of the cavern, and there was 
only Trelawny in the way. 

On the sixth day 3 they were to meet Trelawny on the ledge 
in front of the cavern to practice pistol firing. This was the 
moment Fenton chose for the execution of his plan. He got 
Whitcombe intoxicated, and made him believe Trelawny had a 
plot to murder them both. Whitcombe swore to stand by his 
friend to the last, and promised to be ready on any signal. It 
was Trelawny s first fire, and, after hitting the mark, he went 
a little forward, and, in his usual cold, unsocial way, stood with 
his back to them. Fenton raised his carabine, which was not 
loaded, and, pointing it at Trelawny, snapped. He looked 
with pretended dismay as Whitcombe, cocked and snapped 
again. " He turned upon me such a look, I knew not what I 
did. I raised my gun, pulled the trigger, and fell from my own 
emotions." These were the words of the mad boy, who had 
become all but an assassin. Two balls, with which his gun 
was loaded, had lodged in the back of Trelawny, who was 
apparently dying. The soldiers rushed in, and Whitcombe 
heard the voice of Fenton, who was supporting Trelawny, 
crying, " There is the young traitor ! Shoot him ; cut him

chief town, but which extended northeast into Locris. Of this

was a Thessalian, from beyond Locris.

down ! Do not let him speak." But Whitcombe ran, gained 
an inner apartment, and taking off his sash, fastened it, and 
threw himself over the precipice. By some strange means he 
got safely to the bottom. After running some time he was met 
by some soldiers of Ulysses, and carried back to the cavern, 
half distracted. On entering, he asked, " Where is Fenton ? " 
" At your feet ; " and he looked down on his bleeding corpse. 
There was a Swiss in the cavern who had seen the transaction. 
He had seen the emotion of Whitcombe, and could not believe 
he committed the act. When he heard Fenton crying out to 
kill him without letting him speak, he became convinced. He 
ordered a soldier to fire on Fenton ; the ball just passed his 
head. Fenton turned round quickly, and seeing the Swiss, 
whom he knew to be a dead shot, aiming another musket at 
him, he turned fully in front of him, put his hand on his breast, 
and cried, " Fire again ! I am ready." He received the ball 
through his heart, fell, rolled upon his face, and expired with 
out a groan. 

Whitcombe was put in irons and kept so till Trelawny, 
against all human expectations, recovered a little. He ordered 
Whitcombe brought before him, had his irons taken off, and 
set him at liberty; nor did he seem to have the least idea that 
Whitcombe had fired upon him. He continued to treat him 
kindly. Whitcombe said : " I could not stand this generosity. 
I confessed to him the whole ; I even gave it to him in writing, 
and he dismissed me." Trelawny recovered from his desperate 
wound, and, perhaps getting fatigued with his solitary situation, 
retired with his young bride to the Ionian Islands. Whit 
combe is ruined and desperate (1828); he has blighted the 
hopes of his highly respectable mother and wounded the pride 
of his brave brothers, who are officers of the British army. 1 

It is evident from this strange tale (which is mainly 
confirmed by Trelawny) that Whitcombe was so con 
fused by drink that he was under some delusions,, for 



One of them served with Howe in Greece. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 41 

it is quite likely Fenton himself fired one of the fatal 
shots. Trelawny s own version of the story makes 
the time shorter (only four days from Whitcombe s 
arrival), and adds many curious particulars of this 
garrison life on Parnassus. He gives also a drawing 
of the cavern, with its three ladders of approach. He 
says: 

I left Missolonghi in May, 1824, to return to Salona, with 
about 100 men, including the Roumeliotes I had brought with 
me. In all my motley squad there was one only who spoke 
English, and he was a Scot (this was Fenton). It would have 
been better had I omitted that one. ... In addition to 
my small number within the cave, I had a much larger force 
at the foot of the ladders, hutted within a stone breastwork. I 
gave the command of them to the Scotchman, whom I had 
brought from Missolonghi (two years before). He then intro 
duced himself to me, saying he had come out expressly to join 
Lord Byron s regiment ; that he had served in the civil wars of 
Spain ; was skilled in guerilla warfare, and that his funds were 
exhausted. He was a tall, bony man, with prominent eyes and 
features, in the prime of life, thirty-one pr thirty-two years old. 
His dress, accoutrements and arms were all well chosen. He 
was restless, energetic, enterprising, and a famous walker. I 
sent him on many missions ; to the Ionian Islands for money, 
to the seat of government to see what they were doing, and 
with letters to friendly chiefs, so that he was not much at the 
cave ; and when he was, he lived in a hut below it. I supplied 
him with all he wanted ; my purse was his. He was not 
squeamish on these points, but sensual, and denied himself 
nothing within his reach. When in my neighborhood he passed 
most of his time with me. No querulous word or angry glance 
ever ruffled our friendly intercourse. I thought him honest, 
and his staying with me a proof of his good will, if not per 
sonal friendship. In March, 1825, I sent Fenton to Argos, 
where the government was, to get what information he could 



42 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

of their designs. One of the most acute and unprincipled of 
the hangers-on of the Government, who was confident every 
man had his price (he means Mavrocordato), instinctively dis 
covered that Fenton was one of his own type ; and, after many 
conferences, they devised a plan to entrap Odysseus and assas 
sinate me. If Fenton was successful he was to have half of 
everything that was in the cavern. He returned to me with a 
budget of special lies. ... In the latter end of May Fen 
ton had brought with him from Arachova, in Bceotia, 1 a light 
headed, but apparently simple-minded, English Philhellene, 
named Whitcombe. He said he had been in the East Indian 
army, and came to Greece to seek adventures. They both 
dined and passed their evenings with me, but slept below in 
Fenton s hut." 

Trelawny then relates how, on the fourth day after 
Whitcombe came, the three sat smoking and drinking 
under the veranda on the lower terrace. While the 
three were in the cavern, an Albanian, a Hungarian, 
and an Italian were temporarily off duty. Fenton 
then proposed a shooting match between himself and 
Whitcombe, and had the Italian sent up stairs. Soon 
he proposed that Trelawny should shoot with his 
pistol, which he did. 

" They were standing together on a flat rock two yards be 
hind me. The instant I had fired I heard another report, and 
felt that I was shot in the back. They both exclaimed What 
a horrid accident ! As one of their flint guns had just before 
hung fire, and I had seen Fenton doing something to the lock 
of his, I thought it was an accident. No thought of their 
treachery crossed my mind. I did not fall, but sat down on a

rock with the pistol in my hand, and in perfect possession of all 
my faculties. Fenton said, Shall I shoot Whitcombe ? I 
answered No. I took my other pistol from my belt, when 
Fenton said, I will call your servant, and hastily left me, fol 
lowing Whitcombe to the entrance porch. The dog-, growling 
fiercely, first stopped their" flight. The Hungarian, always 
prompt, was quickly at his post on the upper terrace. Fenton, 
who had run away, called to him, A dreadful accident ! Will 
you come down and help ? The Hungarian said, No accident, 
but treachery. If you don t put down your carbine I shall 
shoot you ! Fenton, as a last resort, was raising his carbine, 
when the Hungarian shot him, and he fell dead. Whitcombe 
attempted to escape by the trap-door leading to the ladder, 
the dog threw him on his back and held him as if he had been 
a rat. . . . His life now hung on mine, and everybody 
thought that I was mortally wounded. They all swore if I 
died they would roast him before a slow fire. This was no idle 
threat, for it had been done more than once during that san 
guinary war," 

Trelawny next describes his double wound, and 
how he recovered from it. "I owed my life to 
a sound constitution, and having had no doctor." 
Whitcombe pleaded guilty and begged for life, writ 
ing to Trelawny " an incoherent statement of what 
took place betwen him and Fenton." By his account 
" his feeble brain was worked up to a state of hom 
icidal insanity." He persisted that Fenton shot Tre 
lawny. " He was now mad with terror, screamed and 
shrieked if anyone came near him. He was in irons 
and chained to the wall, with no other food than 
bread and water. I resolved on the twentieth day of 
his imprisonment to set him free, which I did." Tre 
lawny also prints several of Whitcombe s letters, in 
one of which, dated August, 1825, he says that a cer- 



44 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

tain Mr. Humphreys induced him to visit Trelawny s 
cave. 1 

Who this Englishman Humphrey was does not 
appear either from Howe s account or from Tre 
lawny s. 

In some chapters published by Dr. Howe in the 
New England Magazine for 1831, he gives a picture of 
young Whitcombe as he first saw him, and as he be 
held him after the tragedy above recited, and though 
the dates and places are a little disguised, the story 
may be depended on. He says : a 

" Our band of mountain soldiers halted under the deep shadow 
of a cluster of broad-leaved fig trees to pass the heat of the 
day. We had taken our siesta, and when I awoke I took a look 
at the singular group around me. The object which most in 
terested me was the slender, elegant figure of a stripling of 
nineteen, who lay at my feet with his head half raised and rest 
ing on one hand, while in the other he held a miniature, and 
his eyes were fixed on an open letter on the grass before him. 
His graceful form, just budding into manhood, had the suppleness 
and ease peculiar to his age, which makes every posture grace 
ful. His features were regular and beautiful, though strongly 
marked. His complexion, dark by nature, was still more dark 
ened by exposure, and his large, black eyes, ever restless and 
full of fire, gave animation to his whole countenance. Then 
the rich and picturesque costume of the Albanian Greeks, re 
lieved by the large, shaggy capote on which he was lying, gave

when the ladders were removed neither armies nor artillery 
could make any impression, It is at a perpendicular height of 
150 feet from the bottom of a precipice, and sheltered above by a 
lofty arch."

the perfect picture of a young Greek in the person of an Eng 
lishman of family and fortune. Suddenly he sprang to his feet, 
and, calling me by name, cried out, Will you be off with me 
or not ? for if I stay here any longer, waiting for the Turkish 
hounds, may I be damned ! I ll not be beating about with you 
any longer in these parts (said Whitcombe). I ll be off to 
Ulysses with my five soldiers, and we shall see more fighting 
there in one week than you will have here if you wait till dooms 
day. Nonsense ! cried I. Do have patience. We can be 

of no service to Greece unless Service to Greece ! You 

are always prating about that. I tell you I want to be quick 
about it ; I want a chance to fight, and be promoted, and get 
some credit, and go home to England and enjoy it. Who can 
stay in this miserable, dirty country where one gets nothing to 
eat but onions, black bread, and olives, and nothing to drink but 
sour wine ? I tried to pacify the petted and spoiled boy, and 
he agreed to accompany us another day s march. This was 
disturbed by no uncommon event, except that we hurried more 
than usual, and often looked anxiously about us lest we should 
be surprised on the open plain by the Turkish cavalry. In a 
small, open village, after dinner, Francesco ran forward, and in 
a moment I heard his shrill cry, The Turks ! the Turks ! Our 
mules and baggage were driven into a stone church as a strong 
hold and place of refuge in case our outworks should be carried. 
Some of our 300 men went furiously to work, digging a ditch 
in which they could lie down and be sheltered by the few feet 
of earth flung up before them. Others punched holes through 
the outer walls of the cottages facing the plain, from which 
they could put out their muskets and fire in security. All were 
busied in preparing for defence with the least possible ex 
posureall but Whitcombe. His spirits seemed to rise and 
his eyes to flash fire as he stood impatient on a bank, with 
his hand on the trigger of his cocked gun, the muzzle resting 
on his left arm. There was a sudden movement of the foe ; 
their horses dashed foward towards us at a gallop ; the riders 
waved their scimetars, when I felt myself pulled into the ditch 
by Francesco, and, putting out my gun through a hole, I lay 



46 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

and waited till they should be within shot. A flash of fire ran 
along their line, their balls whizzed over our heads ; our mus 
kets instantly rattled in reply. After that I saw nothing and 
thought of nothing but to load and fire. As the smoke rose, I 
saw a troop of a dozen dash within a few yards of us, fire their 
pistols, wheel, and away ; and when the smoke again cleared 
off they were half a mile distant, Then there was shouting 
and congratulation in our hitherto breathless band. Whitcombe 
leaped over the barrier, yataghan in hand, and would have ad 
vanced, but no one followed the foolhardy boy. At sunset we 
left our dangerous position, and a hard night s march brought 
us to the main body of our men. 

" But Whitcombe soon tired ; his restless spirit needed more 
excitement, and the company of some reckless spirits, whom 
he had unfortunately met and who pressed him to join them in 
Western Greece, where they had, as they said, hard fighting, 
but beauty and wassail to recompense them. I trembled as 
he left me, for I knew he was the darling of an aged mother, 
the hope of a proud family. Months rolled away and I heard 
nothing from Whitcombe. I heard, indeed, strange tales of 
some Europeans in Western Greece ; 1 men talked of dissipation 
and unnatural crimes ; of treason and assassination. But the 
East abounds with such tales, and I noticed them not. One even 
ing, at Hydra, my attention was attracted by the appearance of 
a young man, coming slowly along the street, apparently very 
weak and exhausted. His once magnificently embroidered 
dress presented a strange contrast of rags and riches, splendor 
and dirt ; he was without arms, though his silver cartridge- 
boxes and pistol-belt showed him to have been a soldier. As 
he drew near, I saw that he was sallow and emaciated ; I met 
him at the door, against which he supported himself with one 
hand and, hesitatingly, held out the other to me, and fixed on 
me his ghastly, sunken eyes. I took his hand, doubtfully ; he 
exclaimed, in a hollow voice, Do you not know me ? It was 



1 He means in the region of Parnassus, where Fenton and Tre- 
lawny and Ulysses were.

Whitcombe ; but so changed from the fiery, yet blooming 
youth I had seen a few months before that I could scarce be 
lieve my eyes. We got him food, and tried to cheer him, but 
he was sad and reserved. 

" I suspected his mind was affected, and we got him to retire, 
having made up the best bed we could with some rags, on 
the floor of the adjoining room. At midnight I was wakened 
by the most dreadful screams from Whitcombe s room. I 
seized a pistol in one hand, a sword in the other, and, dashing 
open the door, found him rolling on the floor, groaning out, I 
am stabbed and murdered I am dying ! 

" Who has stabbed you ? There is no one here. 

" There, there, cried he, clinging to my legs, and pointing 
to a dark corner of the room, there he is ! 

" Not a soul was to be found, and then the truth flashed upon 
me. He had been dreaming his conscience had conjured up 
a specter. I passed my hand over his body, and persuaded 
him he was not dying, nor even wounded. Before morning the 
unhappy youth disclosed to us a plot which, aided by his own 
folly and pride and ambition, had made him a traitor and as 
sassin. He told a tale which bore every impress of truth, 
which subsequent events have proved to be in the main cor 
rect, and yet so strange, so horrible, as to belong rather to the 
province of romance than of history." 

Here Dr. Howe left the story unfinished, which he 
had partly told in 1828, and which he evidently meant 
to tell more fully in 1832. But he sailed from Boston 
in October, 1831, and went through such singular 
adventures in Europe before he returned to Boston, 
that he never again took up the thread of his story, 
except in conversation now and then. Whether he 
met Trelawny in America in 1834-5, I cannot say. 
Wendell Phillips did, in Philadelphia, and formed the 
most unfavorable opinion of him. 



CHAPTER IV. 

SCENES OF WAR AND PEACE IN THE REVOLUTION. 

IN the journals of Dr. Howe, some of which he 
published soon after returning to America, are many 
vivid descriptions of Grecian life during the Revo 
lution and afterwards. These will give better 
than any words of mine, the spirit of the time and 
place in which for six years he led so active a life. 
Trelawny also has printed some similar sketches, 
taken from his own diary, or his retentive memory, 
and one of them may first be given, as earliest in date. 
Trelawny seems to have been a veracious chronicler 
of some parts of his strange life; although, like Dr. 
Howe, in the passages just quoted, he sometimes dis 
guises the literal facts from design or failure of mem 
ory. He has not described the skirmishes and battles 
that he saw in Greece so often as Dr. Howe did, but 
there is a passage in his Records which portrays in a 
striking manner the result of one of those fights, of 
which Howe gives an account, though neither were 
present at it. This was the defeat of Dramalis, the 
Turk, by Nikitas, the Turkophagos, in August, 1822, on 
the way from Mycenae to Corinth, in a pass through 
which now runs the railway from Nauplia and Argos 

(48) 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 49 

to Corinth. ! Trelawny, writing many a year afterward 
says, speaking of his journey from Missolonghi to 
Salona, before Byron landed in Greece. 

"On our way from Argos to Corinth, in 1823, we passed 
through the defiles of Dervenakia ; our road was a mere mule- 
path for about two leagues, winding along in the bed of a 
brook, flanked by rugged precipices. In this gorge, and a 
more rugged path above it, a large Ottoman force, principally 
cavalry, had been stopped in the previous autumn, by barri 
cades of rocks and trees, and slaughtered like droves of cattle 
by the wild and exasperated Greeks. It was a perfect picture 
of the war, and told its own story ; the sagacity of the nimble- 
footed Greeks and the hopeless stupidity of the Turkish com 
manders were palpable. Detached from the heaps of dead 
we saw the skeletons of some bold riders, who had attempted 
to scale the acclivities, still astride the skeletons of their 
horses, and in the rear, as if in the attempt to back out of the 
fray, the bleached bones of the negroes hands still holding the 
hair ropes attached to the skulls of the camels death like sleep, 
is a strange posture-master. There were grouped in a narrow 
space, 5,000 or more skeletons of men, horses, camels, and 
mules ; vultures had eaten their flesh, and the sun had bleached 
their bones. In this picture the Turks looked like a herd of 
bisons, trapped and butchered in the gorges of the Rocky 
Mountains. The rest of their battles, amidst scenery generally 
of the same rugged character, only differed in their magni 
tude." 2 



1 In March, 1890, I traversed this route, and the conductor of our 
train, as we went through the defile, came into our carriage and 
pointed out the scene of the fearful slaughter of the Turks. It is a 
most murderous looking battle-field. 

2 Records by Trelawny. Vol. 2, p. 121, London, 1878. 

This fight occurred August 6, 1822 ; Dramalis was the Turkish 
general ; Colocotroni and Nikitas were the Greek commanders. 
The railway now runs through this pass. I went through on a train

Dr. Howe again described his comrade, Francesco, 
thus : 

Francesco, my comrade and servant, was born he knew not 
where ; but first found himself a slave at Constantinople. He 
grew up under the eye of a tyrant, whom he hated and feared, 
and who (as Francesco said), though free from the unnatural 
passion which is one of the besetting sins of the Asiatic Turks, 
treated him in every other respect as a dog and a slave. The 
earliest efforts of his mind were to deceive and cheat his mas 
ter ; hypocrisy and deception were his only weapons against 
brutal force. " So much," said he, " did I fawn upon my mas 
ter, so cringing, so cowardly, and unresenting did I appear 
under the lash, that you would have said I had no soul, and 
could not feel like a man." He had no communion of soul 
with his kind, for the hand of every man was against him ; he 
saw that every one around him was perfectly unprincipled and 
selfish, and trying by force or fraud to overreach his neighbor ; 
he himself could do nothing by the strong hand, and he had, 
like all the weak, recourse to guile. He clad his face in smiles ; 
he put on a simple and benevolent look ; he cultivated his 



March 31, 1890, from near Mycenae (Phichtia is the station) to 
Nemea the other side of the gorge, near which spot the 
myth of the Nemean lion is localized. There is no outlet 
from the plain of Argos toward Corinth but by the passes 
of Barbati and Dervenaki, which lead from either side of 
Mycenae into the valley of Cleonae. Dr. Howe, in one of his 
magazine chapters (September, 1831) sketches this same defile 
(through which in 1825, he passed with Francesco) thus : " We 
soon came to the foot of a ridge of precipitous, rocky mountains, 
which rises almost like a wall from the plain, and separates the 
dominions of Corinth from the Argolid. A narrow chasm in the 
ridge, which I had not before perceived, now opened before us ; 
and, entering its jaws, we found ourselves between two precipices, 
which rose to an immense height on each side, gradually narrow 
ing, till there was hardly room for a road. Clambering up a 
narrow foot-path, we emerged from the glen, and came to the open 
plain on the other side of the ridge."

address, and flattered every one he met. With a continual eye 
to his own interest, he studied the character of others, and 
tried to take advantage of their weaknesses ; he would lie and 
cheat for gain, and then he must lie and cheat to conceal his 
spoil from his master, who would have approved the villainy, 
and stripped the villain. 

But Francesco watched his time ; he killed his tyrant ; he 
took as much of his gold as he could get at ; and, concealing 
himself in the hold of a vessel, escaped from Constantinople. 
He roved about some time, a pirate in the Archipelago ; and 
then found his way to western Europe ; he wandered awhile in 
Italy, sometimes a trader, sometimes a spy, and sometimes, I 
fear, a brigand. He was an atheist, and unprincipled, though 
he still clung to the mummeries of his church ; he would take 
by the beard, and rob, a priest of his own religion, when out of 
his sacerdotal robes, yet would he never eat without crossing 
himself, or undertake a pillaging excursion without putting up a 
prayer to the Virgin, and vowing her a big wax taper, if he had 
success. But Francesco had too uneasy, wandering a spirit, to 
let him remain in civilized Europe ; for he had not enough of 
the avarice of his countrymen to content himself with mere 
money-making. He wandered into Servia and Bosnia, and 
served among the Annatoli, who often lived by plundering the 
Turks, their employers. In these countries, and in Russia, he 
found many of his countrymen, who were hatching the plot of 
revolution ; he became initiated into the secret, and felt all his 
old hatred of the Turks revive ; as soon as the revolt in Greece 
broke out, Francesco flew to join the first of the rebels. 

And now, behold him in his element the life and spirit of 
a band of wild mountain soldiers. His wit and humor, his 
volubility and fund of anecdote, and his continual flow of spirits, 
made him the delight of his companions around the night-fire. 
It was Francesco s cheerful voice that roused them at early 
dawn, it was Francesco who ever led the way through difficult 
or dangerous passes ; his never-ceasing song cheered the weary 
march, and his light look and frolic eye were never darkened 
by fatigue. Methinks I see him now, with his thirty light- 



52 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

hearted companions in a row behind him, rapidly crossing a 
plain, or toiling over a mountain, all life and animation, taking 
up the chorus of his song, and making the mountains echo with 
their shouts. He was always first on the march, when the path 
was difficult to be found, or a dangerous defile was to be passed; 
his reputation for courage, sealed and confirmed by his many 
scars, made him as much respected by his companions, as his 
merry mood and liberal and dashing way, made him beloved. 
But he was not first in good deeds alone ; was a village to be 
put under contribution for provisions, or sheep to be obtained 
nolens volens from the shepherd, he always did the business. 
He would plead like a lawyer, and coax like a woman, and when 
that failed, out flew his yataghan, and he would head the soldiers 
in their too frequent attacks on the peasantry. 

* ****** 

Ere we gained the village 1 we had been discovered by the 
peasants, and in an instant every sign of life had vanished ; 
sheep, mules, fowls, and men had alike disappeared ; every 
door and shutter was fastened, and one would have supposed 
the village totally uninhabited. (In fact, I saw many of the men 
stealing away in the distance.) But the soldiers soon com 
menced a clattering at the doors, and Francesco, beckoning me 
to follow him, selected one of the best looking of the mud- 
walled cottages, and began to unload the mule before the door, 
crying out at the same time " Come, come, old mother, open 
your door, and quickly too, for I have brought some great men 
for your lodgers." Not a soul answered, however ; I listened 
at the door, but not a sound was to be heard. " Hollo ! 
hollo ! there within ! " shouted Francesco, coming up and 
kicking violently against the door ; " open, open ; what ! all 
gone? well then, here goes I ll stave in the door." "Oh 
Lord bless us ! Lord bless us ! " shrieked a shrill voice from 
within ; " Who is there, what do ye want, and can t you have 
patience a moment till I open ? There now," said an old 
hag, thrusting her wrinkled face out of the half-open door, 

1 In the Peloponesus. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 53 

" what do ye want ? " " Want," says Francesco, pushing in, 
" want, old mother of mine ? we want lodgings, and fire, and 
some eggs, and butter, and a chicken, forsooth, if ye have any." 
" Oh ! " shrieked out the old woman, " you cannot come into 
my house ; there is nothing in it ; I have not a bit of bread 
even ; I swear to you, by the Holy Virgin, I have not seen 
oil, nor butter, nor eggs, these many months. No ! no ! ye 
can t come in," said she, struggling with Francesco, who kept 
edging into the door-way ; " go over to my neighbor, he is 
rich, and has everything ; there is nothing in my house that 
ye can eat. There now ! " added she, after he had fairly pushed 
her in, " you see what there is, and ye are welcome to my 
house." 

Changing now her tune entirely, she became quite en 
chanted to see us, and tried to make the best of it ; and 
indeed we found it a comfortable place, though apparently 
poorly stocked ; but there was a bright fire burning on the 
earth floor, and other indications sufficient to guide Fran 
cesco in his researches. 

" My good mother," says he, " how many have you in your 
family ? " " Family," said she, " I have no family, none but a 
widowed daughter, and we are so miserably poor we are al 
most starved." But what are all these wooden spoons for ?" 
said he, drawing out a half dozen which had been hastily 
covered up by a coarse towel. " Spoons ! spoons ! " cried the 
old woman, hurrying to take them from him, " they have been 
lying there these two months." "By my faith then," said he, 
smelling of them, " they have kept the scent well, for, mother, 
they smell of good soup ; and, bless me, they are quite soaked 
yet ; come, come, out with the remnant of the lamb you had for 
dinner." " I eat lamb ! Lord bless me ! I havn t seen meat 
in these walls these many months. I lent the spoons to-day to 
neighbor Yanni, and he sent them back unwashed." "And 
did he send you back bones also ? " said Francesco, picking up 
two or three little ribs from the ashes. " Come, come, cousin, 
out with it, out with it," said he rummaging around the cot 
tage, the old woman keeping before him, and at last sitting 



54 DR. s. G. HOWE. 

down on a bread trough which was turned bottom upwards, 
she declared she was old and tired out, and just ready to 
die. " Get up," said Francesco, " get up and let us look un 
der your trough." I can t get up, I can t, there is nothing 
here, by the Cross ! nothing ; " but he pulled her up gently, 
and turning over the trough, there he found the remnant of 
the lamb. " Nothing in the world," said the old woman, "but 
some cold lamb, and you are entirely welcome to that ; I 
meant to have given it to you ; you are welcome my child," 
said she, in a coaxing voice, " to all I have in my house. " She 
found it was impossible to get rid of us, seeing that Whit- 
combe and myself had hung up our muskets, taken off our 
belts, and were making ourselves quite at ease with our pipes. 
For my part, I said nothimg, but amused myself with watch 
ing the movements of Francesco, who searched round as 
though it had been his mother s cottage, looking now for 
oil to cook with, and now for meal to bake bread, the old 
woman following close up, trying to divert his attention, from 
the spot where the things were concealed, and swearing by all 
the saints that she had not the articles. But Francesco, with 
out minding her continued to look round, and, stooping down, 
he examined carefully the floor, which was nothing more or 
less than the hard dry earth ; suddenly he stopped, and began 
scratching the dirt in a part which seemed loose. Then re 
moving a few inches of it, he came to a broad bit of wood, 
which he removed, and found it was the cover of an immense 
earthen jar, holding several barrels, and filled with excellent 
oil. " Bring me a dipper, mother," said he, coolly. " Oh, is it 
oil you want, my son ? why, why didn t you tell me before ? 
we have plenty of that, thank God!" Flour and wine were 
soon forthcoming, and in a short time Francesco had a meal 
bannock ready, and, scraping away the ashes, he laid it on the 
hot bricks, and covering it with cinders and coals, left it to 
cook, and proceeded to lay the table, which was a round one 
about eight inches in height. Wooden spoons and forks were 
all the furniture, and we squatted upon our heels, with six 
soldiers around the bare board, drew our jackknives, and as- 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 55 

saulted the bannock and the cold lamb with vigor, meat be 
ing a luxury we had not enjoyed for several weeks. Wine, 
too, we had, and Francesco, acting the part of our Ganymedl, 
poured out to us, in his silver cup, and enlivened the meal 
by his stories and jokes. 

THE GRECIAN BUREAUCRATS, 1831. 

" Suppose a man wishes to go from Athens to Trip- 
politsa, a distance of less than a hundred miles; he 
must wait the time and convenience of the police of 
Athens, who, when ready, take the height and breadth 
of our Athenian, the length of his nose, the color of 
his eyes and hair. He is conn d and scann d by rote, 
set in a note book, and then permitted to go on, after 
paying the good people for their trouble in detain 
ing him. He hurries to the Piraeus, and finds the 
little boat all ready, except the passport (for boats that 
run daily must have a separate one, and pay for it 
too). Soon the captain of the modern trireme (they 
have just three oars, not three banks), returns swear 
ing, and calling on the Virgin for aid, with such fury 
that the traveler would suppose the Persians had 
blocked up the Gulf of Salamis; but he finds it is only 
that his Themistocles was a minute too late at the 
police office; they had sat down to dinner, and would 
not get up from that, and their subsequent siesta, for 
two hours. Well, the two hours are past, the breeze 
blows fair, and our Greek enters the harbor of ygina at 
sunset, to transact ten minutes business; but he is too 
late, the man in office has just turned his key, and 
our boat and its passengers must wait until the next 
morning, before one soul dare put foot on shore. 
They remain cooped up all night, and the next morn-

ing have the satisfaction of being told at the office 
that their passports are all in order, they may go on 
shore ; they might have gone last night if they had 
arrived ten minutes before. After the same delay, 
and taking in a store of olives and garlic for break 
fast, they steer away for Epidaurus. Here, after de 
lays at the custom-house, their passports are exam 
ined, countersigned, and paid for, and they jog on to 
Napoli, where they are obliged to wait at the gates 
until the police have examined their documents and 
got their pay. Then they go on to Tripolitsa, and 
enter there after going through a like visitation and 
examination. Thus, in a journey of a hundred miles, 
the Greek comes under the claws of the police five 
times, subjected to some expense, great vexation, and 
the loss of more time than would have been necesary 
to accomplish his journey. Nor is this any exaggera 
tion; the Official Gazette of Greece lays down these 
laws, and they are strictly enforced." 

DR. HOWE S CHARITIES, 1827-28. 

The mention in this passage of the anchorage at 
^gina (an island in the Saronic Gulf, an hour s sail 
from Salamis and the Piraeus) recalls one of Dr. 
Howe s characteristic exploits during the revolution, 
in 1827-28. In his autobiography he says : 

" The best service I could then render was to go to 
America and procure help. I came, and I went about 
New England and New York, and plead for the starv 
ing Greeks. Great enthusiasm was excited and warm 
sympathy manifested in valuable contributions. I think 
over sixty thousand dollars was the result of this ap- 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 57 

peal; and how much in clothing is not easy to estimate. 
As soon as possible, I took charge of a vessel laden 
with flour, and provisions and clothing, and hastened 
back to Greece, arriving in time to prevent thousands 
from starving. These American contributions went 
directly to the people; and their effect was very great, 
not only by relieving from hunger and cold, but by 
inspiring courage and hope. I made several depots 
in different places; I freighted small vessels and ran 
up the bays with them. The people came trooping 
from their hiding places, men, women, and children, 
hungry, cold, ragged, and dirty. They received ra 
tions of flour, corn, biscuit, pork, etc., and were clad 
in the warm garments made up by American women. 
It was one of the happiest sights a man could wit 
ness; one of the happiest agencies he could discharge. 
They came, sometimes twenty, thirty, forty miles, on 
foot, to get rations and clothing. Several vessels 
followed mine and many distributions were made. 

" An immense number of families from Attica, from 
Psara, and from other islands, had taken refuge in 
yEgina, and there was the most concentrated suffer 
ing. I established a main depot there, and commenced 
a systematic distribution of the provisions and 
clothing. As the Greeks were all idle, I concluded it 
was not best to give alms except to the feeble; but I 
commenced a public work on which men, women, and 
children could be occupied. The harbor of ^Egina 
was not a natural one, but the work of the old Greeks. 
The long walls projecting into the sea for breakwaters 
were in pretty good condition, but the land side 
of the harbor was nearly ruined from being filled up 
with debris and washings from the town. I got some 



58 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

men who had a little " gumption " and built a coffer 
dam across the inner side of the harbor. Then we 
bailed out the water, and, digging down to get a 
foundation, laid a solid wall, which made a beautiful 
and substantial quay, which stands to this day, and 
is called the American Molos or Mole. In this work 
as many as five hundred people, men, women and 
children, ordinarily worked; on some days as many 
as seven hundred, I think. 

" On the hill in the rear of the harbor was standing 
a solitary column of an old temple of Venus, or Juno, 
I forget which. The foundations of this temple were 
of marvelous extent and beauty of finish ; composed 
of blocks of hewn stone of great size and perfect reg 
ularity. They were from four to six feet long, three 
to four feet wide, and about eighteen inches to two 
feet thick ; they were hewn perfectly smooth, and 
laid in regularly without cement, making a bed, if I 
recollect right, about eight or nine feet deep. All 
this was buried deep under rubbish ; probably was 
always below the surface of the ground, and intended 
to break the shock of earthquakes. At these founda 
tions we went to work sacrilegiously, and toted the 
huge blocks down the hill and upon the mole and a 
beautiful work it made. Besides this there was an 
immense amount of rubbish to be cleared out, and a 
great deal of sand, small stones, earth and the like to 
be brought and backed in behind the wall. On this 
men, women and children worked, and for their work 
were paid in provisions."

THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF A GREEK WARRIOR. 

It was while Dr. Howe was at ^Egina, but proba 
bly before his distribution of supplies there, as above 
described, that he witnessed the death, heard the 
coronach, and. saw the interment of a comrade, Nicolo, 
who had fought by his side on the mainland. The 
same burial custom still prevails in Greece, and the 
wailing is doubtless still practiced in the country 
regions ; but in Athens, where I saw many funerals in 
1890, the custom does not seem to be observed : 

" I was called last evening to see young Captain 
Nicolo, one of my old acquaintances and campaign 
ing companions. He was wounded in an affair with 
the Turks several days ago; not mortally, however, as 
we thought, and had been brought here for recovery; 
but the moment I entered his room last night, I saw 
that the hand of death was upon him. He was lying 
on a hard mattress on the floor, and, as he heard my 
footstep, he quickly turned his head, and eagerly 
stretching out his hand to me as I advanced, he 
grasped mine within both of his with a convulsive 
effort, as though he would cling upon me for life ; 
and gazing wildly and with staring eyes in my face, 
he cried, * I am dying, but oh ! I cannot die will 
not die save me, oh ! do save me! There was such 
a startling eagerness in his manner, and such horror 
in his eyes, that I was thrown off my guard ; he saw 
the expression of my face, and, letting go my hand, 
he sunk back, and, looking up, muttered to himself, 
&lt; Then I must indeed die. The poor fellow had been 
called brave, and was so in the hurry and excitement 
of war ; he tried to call his courage and his pride to 



60 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

aid him in his dreadful extremity, and when his tor 
menting pains left him, he mastered his feelings so as 
to seem calm ; but there was no calm in his soul ; he 
was dying resolutely, indeed, but not resignedly. 

" I tried to console him, and mentioned the vanity 
and little worth of life. Aye, cried he, you call 
it vanity, you, who are in full enjoyment of it ; but 
were you about to be hurled as I am into darkness, 
beyond which you can see no light, you would shrink 
back as I do. Oh, continued he eagerly, I wish I 
could believe in a God, and a future state ; but no 
matter. I have done my duty to the best of my 
knowledge ; I will take the extreme unction, and my 
chance will be as good as the rest. The priest now 
came in, muttering his prayers and making crosses 
and benedictions ; the consecrated candles were 
lighted and the silver incense-pot began to swing 
backward and forward, when I left him to his offices 
and went to my quarters. I had been sitting there 
almost two hours when I heard dreadful screams of 
women in the house of Nicolo. I went over and 
found him in his last agony, his clammy hands grasp 
ing the coverlid ; his head was thrown back, his eyes 
staring fixedly, his mouth open as if gasping for 
breath, which, however, came quick and convulsively, 
and rattled hollowly in his throat. 

" It was a dreadful scene, in which the dying man 
acted but part ; for the long suppressed agony of 
grief had now burst forth the mother lay upon the 
floor, tearing her hair, beating her breast, and wail 
ing most piteously ; the other female relatives were 
alike affected, some were running screaming about 
the house, while others sat and moaned aloud, and 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 6l 

accompanied their cries with violent gestures. This 
scene continued with little relaxation until the suf 
ferer gasped his last gasp, and then the screaming, 
the moaning, and tearing of hair were renewed more 
violently than ever. Other women now came in from 
the neighborhood and I soon observed there was 
some system in this scene for the new comers 
seemed to make ready as for an encounter, before 
they set up their shout; they loosened their hair, 
shook it about their shoulders, and deranged their gar 
ments, and then set up their wailing in chorus with 
the others. I saw, further, that in a half an hour 
these wailing neighbors seemed to spell each other, 
for, when exhausted nature silenced the real grief of 
the mother or relatives, or when one of the new 
comers was obliged to stop to breathe, another would 
strike in in her place, and keep up the clamor. 

" I retired when the old women began to arrange the 
corpse, and, sitting down at the door of my tent, 
which looked into the windows of Nicolo, I gazed 
upon the scene, which seemed more striking from 
without. The windows were all open ; lights were 
flying about ; female figures, with their hair stream 
ing down their shoulders, were flitting around, some 
throwing up their arms, others sitting still with their 
heads lowered between their knees, others bending 
over, and arranging the corpse, and all weeping, 
wailing and screaming aloud. I tried to shut out the 
sound as well as the sight, but the noise was too 
near and too great. I went out, and strolled about 
till near morning. I wandered to the ruins of the 
ancient port; I mounted to the old temple of Venus 
on the hill, and, leaning against the long column, 



62 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

gazed for a while on the beautiful Gulf of Salamis, 
and tried to forget Nicolo in thinking of Themisto- 
cles; but it would not do. Facts are too stubborn for 
fancy. The death of Nicolo was more to me than 
that of ten thousand Greeks who died twice ten cen 
turies ago, or that of a hundred thousand men who 
should have died to-day, but a thousand leagues from 
me. When I returned, I found all was still, except 
the voices of two women, who were hired mourners, 
and who had commenced their functions, now that 
the violent emotions of the relatives had worn them 
out. These two women looked, as I saw them through 
the open windows, like two " hags of hell " ; one was 
sitting at the head of the corpse, which was laid out 
in the middle of the room, rocking herself backward 
and forward over it, and chanting forth in cracked 
tones though in regular cadence what I soon found 
to be a sort of an address to the dead body. The 
other was flitting about the room with a taper in her 
hand, and joining in chorus to the chant of her sister 
hag. Their song, or chant, was in commemoration of 
the virtues and good qualities of the deceased, and 
ran about thus : 

" Woe to us that he is dead the beautiful boy ! the brave 
boy ! the sweet boy ! 

" Nicolo ! Nicolo ! why did st thou die ? Thou wast too 
young too beautiful too brave to die. Thou wast the light of 
thy mother s eyes the staff in her hand the oil that fed her 
lamp of life. 

" Oh ! he is dead the brave boy ! The light is gone out ! 
The staff is broken ! The oil is exhausted ! 

" Thy mother sits in darkness, Nicolo ! Why did you leave 
her ? Why did not another die for you ? for none was so 
brave, none so beautiful. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 63 

"The soldiers loved thee. The Turks feared thee. The 
maids looked down when Nicolo approached them. 

" Oh ! woe is us that the brave has fallen ! 

" How many enemies thou hast slain ! how brave wast thou 
in battle ! how swift in the march ! 

" But thou art dead, brave boy ! thou shalt never rise again ! 

" Oh ! woe to us ! woe to thy aged mother ! " 

" This morning the burial took place with all the 
ceremonies of the Greek Church. The procession 
started off from the house, headed by about thirty 
priests in their full robes, each bearing a long wax 
taper in his hand and singing, in clear, musical tones, 
the service for the dead ; then came the incense- 
bearers, swinging their silver incense-pots, and 
throwing up clouds of smoke ; then came the Host, 
before which all prostrated themselves on their knees, 
then followed the bishop in his gorgeous robes, walk 
ing under a splendid canopy, held up by four priests, 
and after him was borne the corpse on an open bier, 
dressed in his gayest robes, with flowers on his breast 
and in his hands. Around it walked the pale and 
haggard relatives, and the more pale and haggard 
looking hired mourners, with black robes and dishev 
eled hair. It was a showy and noisy scene, for the 
riches and pomp of the church were displayed. The 
song of the priests and the wailing of the mourners 
ceased not, and as they passed along rapidly, every 
man raised his cap, and, bowing, made the sign of the 
cross, and every woman and child in the streets knelt 
down, and all muttered blessings. All felt an interest 
in the scene ; all but poor Nicolo. He lay pale and 
still on his bier, and was borne along like a victim 
bound for the sacrifice; and the flowers on his breast 



64 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

and the flowers in his hands seemed to be but in bit 
ter mockery of his fate. Arrived at the grave, the 
procession halted around it, and proceeded to the 
last church rites with pomp and parade, accompanied 
by such violent and noisy expressions of grief on the 
part of the spectators as strongly contrasted, in my 
mind, with the simple solemnity and deep silence 
around our graves, when their new tenants are low 
ered in; a silence broken by nought but some ill-sup 
pressed sob, or the hollow grating of the ropes on the 
descending coffin. 

" Poor Nicolo was now laid in his narrow bed with 
out covering or coffin; the holy water was sprinkled, 
and the last prayer said, and priests and relatives 
were hurrying away, when I took a last look into the 
grave where he lay dressed as for a bridal. He had 
not the wan and hollow look of those who die by dis 
ease; and, but for the marble whiteness of his face 
and neck, made whiter by the clustering of his long 
dark locks, and the deep shadow of the narrow grave, 
I could have thought he slept, so beautiful did he 
look; but, as I gazed, a shovel full of earth was 
thrown upon him; his head started and shook; 
another and another shovel full were thrown in on 
his breast; the dark earth looked strangely black on 
his white kilt, and, as it fell on his whiter neck and 
face, it seemed to smite him too rudely, and I turned 
away, more affected than when I had seen him in his 
agony." 



CHAPTER V. 

DR. HOWE AS A HISTORIAN. 

ALTHOUGH Dr. Howe spent most of his time in 
Greece, from 1824 to 1830, and fought for her free 
dom both by land and sea for he became surgeon- 
in-chief of the Greek fleet and was, therefore, well 
qualified to write the story of the long contest, he yet 
strangely undervalued the book, " An Historical 
Sketch of the Greek Revolution," which he hastily 
wrote in the interval of his active service, and pub 
lished in New York, in August, 1828. He would 
never revise it, and, in later years, he bought up 
copies and destroyed them. It has, indeed, many de 
fects, and does not seem to have been very carefully 
read in proof, by the author or any friend to whom 
he may have entrusted it. He wrote it in five months 
of 1828, amid many other occupations, while advo 
cating the claims of the Greeks to the friendship and 
benevolence of the American people ; and, as he says 
in his preface, he had hardly finished it, when he was 
called upon suddenly to return to Greece. He brings 
it down to the accession of Capo d Istria as first Presi 
dent of Greece, January 19, 1828 ; but he describes 
very briefly the last few months of the war, which 

(65) 



66 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

closed virtually with the naval battle of Navarino, 
October 20, 1827, when the Turkish fleet was de 
stroyed by the combined squadrons of England, 
France, and Russia. Fighting continued for many 
months afterwards, and the country was long dis 
turbed by factions, which could not tolerate a Greek 
ruler, and this led to the election of a foreign prince, 
after the assassination of Capo d Istria by the young 
Mavromichalis, in October, 1831. The chief events 
of the war appear, however, in Dr. Howe s history; 
and the characters of the leading men are sketched 
with vigor and impartiality. It will, therefore, be 
useful to copy some passages from this book as well 
as from the published or unpublished diaries and let 
ters of Dr. Howe, in order to illustrate better this ad 
venturous period of his life. He must have had the 
purpose, at one time, of writing out more fully his 
own adventures, for this he began to do in those 
magazine sketches already quoted; but after he took 
up the cause of the blind in America he never found 
time, and he soon lost the inclination to describe the 
romantic, often happy, but sometimes shudderingly 
painful, fashion of his life. He always returned to 
Greece when he could revisit it in 1844, in 1867, 
and, perhaps, at other times with keen interest; he 
long corresponded with George Finlay, David Urqu- 
hart, and other friends whom he had found in Greece; 
but he was too busy with practical affairs to write a 
monumental history, as Finlay did, or to qarry on a 
warfare of pamphlets, like Urquhart. Nor did he, 
like Trelawny, throw his recollections together in a 
random but fascinating book. That he might have 
done this, these extracts will prove :

PETRO BEY OR MAVROMICHALIS. 

Argolis, and the district of Corinth were (1821), soon in 
revolt ; but no man so much distinguished himself as Petro 
Mavromichalis, Bey of Maina. He had been placed by the 
Turks in this situation ; his post was lucrative, his influence 
over his countrymen very great, and he had no prospect of 
making his condition better by the revolt ; but he listened not 
a moment to any thought but that of the liberty of his country ; 
and, warmly seconded by his brave brothers and sons, he led 
the Mainotes from their mountains, and possessed himself of 
Calamata, and the fine country about it. The Turks, surprised 
by the suddenness and generality of the insurrection, thought of 
nothing but personal safety ; those who could escaped to the 
fortified towns ; others hastily shut themselves up in the little 
towers with which the country abounds ; but being without 
provisions they were obliged soon to yield. The news reached 
the Ionian Islands, and excited the greatest enthusiasm among 
the Greeks. Colocotroni, who had been living a kind of exile 
there, with his brave nephew, Niketas, immediately crossed 
over to the Morea ; while the inhabitants prepared an expedi 
tion to follow them. 

Mavromichalis has since taken a most active and prominent 
part in the Revolution, and his name is well known abroad. It 
is a pity that Waddington, whose almost every word is valuable, 
should say of him : " Petro Bey is a fat, dull, well-looking per 
sonage, who is addicted to no particular class of political opin 
ions, and appears peculiarly unenlightened by any sort of for 
eign information. He is understood to have made great 
progress (for an Oriental) in the science of gastronomy, and is 
willing to embrace any form of government which will leave 
him riches, and give him peace, abundance, and security. It is 
then imagined, he would introduce French cookery among the 
Mainotes, as an excellent substitute for the indifferent potations 
of their Spartan ancestors." Now, all this is very fine, and for 
the most part true ; but it should not have been said, or more 
should have been added to explain. Still more ungenerous is 



68 I&gt;R. S. G. HOWE. 

the flippant observation of Mr. Emerson, 1 who, if he knew 
nothing of Mavromichalis, but that " he is a good-humored, 
round-faced fellow, who seems remarkable for nothing more 
than his appetite and epicurism," should have said nothing. It 
is unfair, in speaking of a public character, to set forth merely 
his personal defects, or one of his foibles, and leave him to be 
judged by that. Mavromichalis, it is true, is fat, and a gour 
mand ; he had rather send to Marathon for lamprey eels, and 
luxuriously eat them from a white plate with a knife and fork 
than sit down on the ground with Colocotroni, and tear to 
pieces with his fingers, a lamb which had been roasted whole 
on a wooden stake by a dirty soldier, who basted it by rubbing 
in oil. But then he does not buy his eels, with money unjustly 
wrung from the peasantry ; and, though he " waddles in his 
gait," he has been oftener seen waddling toward the enemy 
than from them. True, he would infinitely prefer that the 
Turks should come to him and fight, for he dislikes locomo 
tion ; but he would not give way an inch ; and he has shown, 
that when they would not come to him, he could go after 
them. 

He had enjoyed, before the Revolution, the place of Governor 
of Maina. That mountainous province of the Morea, which 
includes part of Lacedaemon, was inhabited by such a turbu 
lent, warlike set of men, that the Turks, unable to keep it in 
subjection, had made a kind of compromise, and appointed a 
Greek to govern it, who should collect the revenues and pay 
them over, without the province being troubled with the pres 
ence of Mussulmans. Petro Mavromichalis Was in this post 
when the insurrection broke out, and possessed such an 
influence over the Mainotes, that, separated as the province is 
from the rest of the Morea, by strong natural divisions, he 
might have prevented them from joining so soon in the revolt, 
and kept his own lucrative situation. But the first shot was 
hardly fired i:i the Morea, the insurrection was yet in its infancy, 

1 Not R. W. Emerson, but another American who had visited 
Greece. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 69 

and its result entirely uncertain, when he hastened to join it ; 
and his subsequent exertions, the generous sacrifices of his 
family, the daring courage and heroic death of his sons and 
nephews, certainly entitle him to respect. Rev. Mr. Swan says 
in his journal : " In the morning we resumed our conference 
with Mavromichalis relative to the release of his son. Tears 
stood in his eyes when he told us the misfortunes of his family. 
One of his children fell at Carysto, another at Neo Castro, 
while a third was prisoner to the Turks in Modon ; his brother, 
at this time was a member of the Senate at Napoli. These 
circumstances he enumerated to prove the vivacity of his 
patriotism, and to show the exertion his family had made. He 
had supported the revolution from the very commencement ; 
and could we be the means of emancipating his son, nothing 
within the compass of his ability should be wanting to testify 
his gratitude, not though it were the last drop of his blood. 

A few years later when Capo d Istria had quar 
reled with this family of Mavromichalis (some of 
whom afterwards assassinated the President at 
Nauplia), Dr. Howe wrote as follows from Paris, to 
a certain extent justifying the old chieftain in his 
feud with Capo d Istria, whom Howe had learned to 
look on as the oppressor of his people. In this he 
was partly right and partly wrong; the purposes of 
this first President of the Greeks were good, but he 
had little skill at governing, and was encompassed 
with difficulties of all sorts. 

The venerable Mavromichalis, who so much distinguished 
himself during the bloody struggle for liberty, was one of Capo 
d Istria s Senators, and one who, from his simplicity of charac 
ter, had long been bamboozled and deceived by him ; but the 
old man at last opened his eyes and kicked; and, astonished at 
finding he was not the free man he supposed himself, he sud 
denly left Napoli (not with the best intentions I grant), to 



70 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

return to his own mountains, where he is venerated as a feudal 
lord. He left behind him a letter for Capo d Istria from which 
I extract a few sentences (for it is published) : 

"Among the first to obey the call of my country to arms, I 
have ever sought to be useful to her: the blood of my brothers, 
of my sons, of my relations, poured out in profusion on the 
soil of the Peloponesus, is proof of the devotion of my family. 
I seek not, from vanity, to parade my services to my country ; 
but, for her I sacrificed a brilliant and commanding situation ; 
for her sake I have been ten years separated from my family, 
afflicted by the loss of its dearest members, and reduced to the 
most distressing poverty. Your Excellency was called to the 
head of the nation in virtue of a contract which guaranteed to 
it a just and paternal government, and I conceal not the fact 
that I cooperated in your nomination, confident of the liberal 
sentiments which report attributed to you. What has been my 
surprise when I saw the first symptoms of your arbitrary 
measures ! " 

THE TWO IPSELANTIS OF FANAR. 

Alexander Ipselanti was brave, without enterprise ; learned, 
without a knowledge of men ; and vain, without self-confi 
dence. He was born at Constantinople, and educated in the 
light, frivolous, Fanariote style, which fitted only for intrigue. 
He entered into the service of Russia, where he lost an arm ; 
and in that service he had, without military talents, arrived to 
the rank of a Major-General, when he was called by the Heta- 
ria to excite, and head an insurrection in Greece. He began 
by sending emissaries to the different parts of Greece, not to 
make, on his own part, preparations ; but to sound the princi 
pal men, and persuade them to make ready to receive him, as 
the future commander-in-chief. He made great promises, and 
talked in no obscure terms of assistance from Russia. He 
employed, among many most unworthy characters, one, whose 
name alone would have honored the expedition which his 
future exertions solely kept from being disgraceful, Captain 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 71 

Georgaki, an Olympiote ; who enjoyed the post of chief of the 
armed police under the Turks, and was thus enabled, without 
suspicion, to collect soldiers. 

A finer opportunity to run the race of ambition could not be 
presented to a man of genius, than had Demetrius Ipsilanti ; 
one of ordinary talent even, without his personal defects, might 
have done much ; but these were great. He is about forty 
years of age (1828) ; but being small of stature, his gaunt, and 
almost skeleton-like figure and bald head give him the appear 
ance of premature old age ; while his nearness of sight, a dis 
agreeable twang of the voice, and a stiff, awkward, and 
embarrassed manner, excite a disagreeable feeling in any one 
introduced to him, amounting almost to pity. But Demetrius 
Ipselanti has not the character which his exterior seems to 
indicate ; he possesses that best kind of courage, a cool indiff 
erence to danger ; is free from the besetting sin of his country 
men, avarice ; is a sincere patriot ; and, when once the reserve 
of first acquaintance is worn off, he proves the kind and gener 
ous friend. Unfortunately for him, he was surrounded by a set 
of weak-minded, vain young men, whose sole recommendation 
was their talent of flattering ; and who probably suggested to 
him the idea of setting up ridiculous pretensions of superiority ; 
which people will never submit to, in one deficient of the talent 
and power to enforce them. 

PRINCE MAVROCORDATO. 

About this time (1822) arrived at the camp from Missil- 
onghi, Alexander Mavrocordato ; a man destined entirely to 
eclipse the Ipselantis, and to take the lead in the Revolution. 
Alexander Mavrocordato (called by courtesy Prince) is of that 
family so dear to Greece, from the patriotic labors of some of 
its members, who have enjoyed high honors about the Porte. 
Alexander was early initiated into that system of intrigue and 
political cunning, which is the leading trait in the character of 
the Greeks of the Fanar ; and he was employed as chief minis- 



72 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

ter by his uncle, the Hospodar, or Prince of Moldavia. Alex 
ander Mavrocordato is now (1828), about thirty-eight years of 
age ; rather below the middling height, but perfectly well made; 
his fine olive complexion looks darker than it really is, from the 
jetty blackness of his hair, which hangs in ringlets about his 
face, and from his large mustachios and sparkling black eyes. 
His manners are perfectly easy and gentlemanlike ; and though 
the first impresssion would be, from his extreme politeness, and 
continual smiles, that he was a good-natured, silly fop, yet one 
soon sees fro^rn the keen, inquisitive glances which involuntarily 
escape him, that he is concealing under an almost childish 
lightness of manner, a close and accurate study of his visitor. 
He speaks fluently seven languages ; and, having been an accur 
ate observer of men and manners, can make his conversations 
extremely instructive ; his political talents are of the very first 
order, and his mental resources great. He has a just confi 
dence in his own powers ; but, unfortunately, he has not that 
personal firmness and hardihood necessary in the leader of a 
revolution. He cannot be called cowardly, for he will reso 
lutely put himself in situations which he knows to be danger 
ous ; yet, when the danger actually arrives, he, in spite of him 
self, loses his coolness and presence of mind. There is but one 
opinion in Greece about the talents of Mavrocordato, which all 
allow to be very great ; but this is not the case in respect to his 
virtues. His friends ascribe every action to the most disinter 
ested patriotism ; but his enemies hesitate not to pronounce 
them all to have for their end his paYty or private interest ; and 
they say that he would sooner subject his country to the Turks 
than have his political opponents get the credit of saving her. 
But here, as is often the case, truth lies between the two 
extremes. Let his enemies avow that he loves his country, and 
has labored hard to benefit her ; and let his friends confess that 
he is ambitious, and has always had a considerable regard to 
his own political interest ; thus a nearer approach to his true 
character will be had, As to his intriguing and crooked policy, 
it may be said, that his excellence in it alone kept up his 
influence ; he could not oppose the schemes of his enemies but

by using the same arms he was attacked with : the only way to 
escape a mine is by countermining. 

KANARIS THE ADMIRAL. 

The successful accomplishment of his daring act completely 
established his fame ; congratulations poured in upon him, and 
every Greek was proud of the name of Kanaris, except 
Kanaris himself. He is by birth an Ipsariote, and had hitherto 
been known only by those immediately about him, who loved 
him for his mildness, and goodness of heart, and respected him 
for his sterling integrity. No one would ever divine the char 
acter of Kanaris from his personal appearance. He is about 
thirty-four years of age (1828), of low stature, slender but 
well made ; and his mild, interesting countenance bespeaks 
rather feminine goodness of heart than what he really pos 
sesses a mind that knows no fear. He appears insensible 
to clanger ; and his resolutions, which might be easily altered 
by persuasion, are made stubborn by open opposition, and fresh 
obstacles are to him only inducements for fresh exertions. He 
loves his country with the sincere, unostentatious love of a 
patriot ; and he calmly and steadily continues to make every 
exertion for her good, in the conviction that he is doing only 
his duty. He boasts not the performance of that, of which the 
neglect would be a crime, and he seems to look for no other 
reward than the proud consciousness of having materially con 
tributed to his country s emancipation. 

DEATH OF MARCO BOTZARIS. 1823. 

Hearing that a body of Turks had been sent by Yussuf to 
land at Creonero, above Missilonghi, to attack him in flank, 
Marco immediately flew to the shore, fell upon them while 
landing, drove them back to their ships ; and then turned to 
oppose the progress of Mustapha Pasha, who, with 12,000 
Turks, was rapidly advancing to enter Acarnania. With an 



74 DR- S. G. HOWE. 

extraordinary celerity of movement, Marco arrived at Karpen- 
isi, and, on the plain below him, found Mustapha Pasha 
encamped with his whole army. The situation of Botzaris * 
was most critical ; but instead of daunting him, it only called 
forth the whole faculties of his active mind, and nerved him for 
great resolves. He summoned all the wild chiefs of his band 
about him, and, addressing them in his persuasive way, stated 
the peculiar difficulties of their situation ; " We have no store 
of provisions, our ammunition is short, our numbers are small, 
the passes are not strong; must we retreat then? We shall 
not suffer in doing so, but we shall leave this horde of barbar 
ians to pour down upon the plains of Acarnania, and the whole 
country as far as Missilonghi ; and to spread terror, rapine, and 
murder over the whole of it. We can neither maintain our 
post then, nor quit it with honor. But there is one resource ; 
we will fall upon the enemy, numerous as he is ; the darkness 
will conceal our numbers, and the surprise may overcome all 
his resistance ; we may rout him, and the plunder of his camp 
may supply our wants." He then proceeded with Yonkos to 
arrange his plans ; he chose 400 Suliotes to attend immediately 
about his person, and penetrate with him to the center of the 
enemy s camp at midnight. The rest of the men were to be 
divided into three parties, who should proceed to different 
points, and at the signal from Botzaris, were to make a simul 
taneous attack. 

About ten o clock, on the night of August 19, 1823, every 
thing being arranged, Botzaris with his band of Suliotes, 
started on his daring undertaking. They passed the outposts 
of the Turks, by speaking to them in the Albanian tongue, and 
telling them they had come from Omer Pasha, from whom 
reinforcements were expected. Botzaris thus traversed a con 
siderable part of their camp, amid the thousands who slept in 
confident security ; he had nearly reached the center, when he 
sounded his bugle, and was answered by the wild shouts of 



1 The Greek pronunciation of this name is not Botzaris, as Hal- 
leek gave it, but Votzaris, B in Greek being V. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 75 

his men, who began the work of destruction. The Turks were 
awakened to find enemies in the midst of them, with sabre and 
pistol ; while the rattle of musketry from the Greeks on the 
outside, showed they were surrounded, and they knew not by 
how many. The surprise, the darkness, and the shouting, made 
useless all attempts to give orders ; the sleeping soldier, so 
rudely awakened, thought only of firing his musket upon whom 
soever he saw near him, without knowing whether he were 
friend or foe ; and in a few minutes the whole camp was a 
scene of uproar and confusion, in which each one thought only 
of safety in flight. Amid all this Botzaris pushed on, animat 
ing his men to deal death around them, shouting aloud, and 
calling them to follow him to the tent of the Pasha, which he 
had nearly reached, when suddenly his voice was hushed ; he 
fell, struck by a random shot, and died in an instant. The vic 
tory was complete, considerable numbers of Turks were slain, 
the army was dispersed, and their camp plundered : but it was 
a dearly bought victory. Greece could not rejoice at it, for she 
had lost her bravest and best chief. 

LORD BYRON IN GREECE. 

[One of the last letters written by Botzaris was to 
Byron, then at Cefalonia; and when the poet reached 
Missolonghi, he took the Suliots of Botzaris into his 
pay. His career in Greece was brief, but it is one 
of the most pleasing portions of his strange life, and 
Dr. Howe never failed to applaud it. In his " His 
tory " is this passage.] 

With the faults and foibles of Byron, Greece had nothing to 
do, she knew nothing of them ; to her he was only o M.sydXo s 
nai KaXoS " the great and good." x Greece knew him only 

1 Crossing the Gulf of Salamis one day in a boat with a rough 
mountain captain and his men, I pulled out a volume of Byron s 
works, and was reading. The wind blowing open the leaves, the 
Captain caupht a glimpse of the portrait, and recognized it. He 
begged to take the book, and looking for a moment with melan 
choly at the face of the noble lord, he kissed it and passed it to his 
men, saying, rjrov /*Ey&lt;xA.o&lt;s noa KaA.o$ He was great and good." 



7& DR. S. G. HOWE. 

as the man whose early admiration of her, expressed in the 
strong and glowing language of poetic genius had served to fix 
the attention of many upon her ; as the man who when she rose, 
and commenced her struggle for freedom, while her prospects 
were yet uncertain and dark, left the enjoyments of those 
pleasures and luxuries, which wealth and exalted station could 
command, to share with her privations and danger ; to expend 
in her cause, his fortune ; and to sacrifice in her service, and on 
her shore, his life. If there was a man whose Philhellenism 
was ardent and unaffected ; if there was a man whose wishes 
for the good of Greece, and whose exertions to promote it, were 
sincere, strong, and untiring ; if there was a man who merits 
her everlasting gratitude that man was Byron, and Byron 
will have it. 

KARRAISKAKIS, THE GREEK GIPSY. 

Karraiskakis, at his death in 1827, was about forty years of 
age; rather above the common height and slender, but with 
out anything very remarkable in his personal appearance. He 
was probably, a natural son of the famous chief Isko and had 
distinguished himself before the war as a daring Klepht. He 
was unlettered but had a great fund of natural shrewdness, and 
an apparently intuitive perception of character. His former 
faults were forgotten, and he was at last confided in more than 
any other chief ; he never distressed the government for money, 
never harassed the peasantry. To his courage and skill in 
mountain warfare he added the greatest prudence, and was as 
able in deceiving as fighting his enemy. At this particular 
crisis, his loss was an irreparable one to Greece. His wound 
had been slightly dressed on shore, and he was then carried on 
board one of the vessels of Lord Cochrane ; here he was exam 
ined, 1 and found to be mortally wounded. His desire to see 
Cochrane was extreme ; and when his lordship came on board,

YOUTHFUL DARING. 77 

and began to pay him some high compliments on his past 
actions, the dying chief waved his hand with an impatient air, 
to cut him short, and said on enoc^a, sxajua; on tyive, 
eytve; TcSpa, did TO juskkov; " What I have done, I have 
done ; what has happened, has happened ; now for the future." 
He then entered into an anxious and long conversation about 
the prospects of the country ; he ended by solemnly charging 
Cochrane to watch over the interests of Greece ; and then 
attended to the arrangements for his family. 1 

In the gallery of chieftains and statesmen and 
naval commanders whose portraits, statues, and 
busts adorn a room in one of the great government 
museums at Athens, is the lovely grave-monument of 
Botzaris, as well as excellent portraits of him, of old 
Mavromichalis and his sons and nephews, of Niketas, 
etc. vigorous, handsome, wilful men, such as Ken 
tucky and Carolina used to send forth in the years 
before our civil war. They are brilliantly dressed in 
the Albanian costume, with pistols at their belts and 
swords by their sides or in their hands; and they fully 
justify by their bearing the character which Dr. Howe 
has given them here. 



1 George Finley, in his History of the Revolution, has a striking 
description of Karraiskakis, and remarks that he was of gipsy 
blood ; this is confirmed to the eye by his portrait in the gal 
lery at Athens which I saw in March 1890. I have heard Dr. Howe 
describe at more length the death of the chief. He was then on 
board the vessel of Captain Hastings off Piraeus. 



CHAPTER VI. 

DR. HOWE COLONIZES CORINTH AND LEAVES GREECE. 

TWICE has Howe engaged in a fruitless effort to 
take Crete away from the Turks in 1826, and again 
in 1866-67. He describes the first failure at some 
length in his history. The expedition was composed 
of 1,200 Greeks and Philhellenes, commanded by a 
Russian Greek, named Calliergi ; it succeeded in 
capturing the strong Venetian fortress of Grabousa, 
or Garabusi, in the northwest of Crete, which the 
Turks were eighteeen years in taking by siege from 
the Venetians. Eleven Cretans surprised it in 1826, 
and Calliergi held it for months ; but could gain no 
footing on the main island of Crete. Dr. Howe said 
in 1857: 

In 1826, among other adventurous affairs, I went with the 
small expedition that made an inroad into Crete. I was shut 
up some time in the rocky fortress of Garabusi, and had some 
difficulty in getting off alive. . In 1827, I served with Hastings 
on board the steamer Perseverance, and was in the action at 
Piraeus, Oropos, Volo, etc. 1 I had been induced by Mavro- 
cordato and others to organize something like a regular surgical 
service in the fleet, and was appointed with the high-sounding 
title of Archichirurgos or Surgeon-in-chief. 

1 These are described at some length in Howe s history. Oropos 
is near Marathon ; Volo farther north. 

(78) 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 79 

In one of my journeyings I found a sick straggler, a deserter 
probably from the present army, who was by trade a wheel 
wright. After curing him up, I got him to build a cart, and it 
was such a marvel that the peasantry flocked from all the 
neighboring district to see it, having never seen a wheeled vehi 
cle before. 

Afterwards I applied to the Government, and obtained a large 
tract of land upon the Isthmus of Corinth, where I founded a 
colony of exiles. We put up cottages, procured seed, cattle, and 
tools, and the foundations of a flourishing village were laid. 
Capo d Istria had encouraged me in the plan of the colony, and 
made some promises of help, The Government granted ten 
thousand stremmata x of land to be free from taxes for five 
years : but they could not give much practical help. I was 
obliged to do everything, and had only the supplies sent out 
by the American committees to aid me. The colonists, how 
ever, cooperated, and everything went on finely. We got 
cattle and tools, plcrughed and prepared the earth, got up a 
school-house and a church. 

Everything went on finely, and we extended our domain over 
to the neighboring port of Cenchrsea, where we had cultivated 
ground and a harbor. This was perhaps the happiest part of 
my life. I was alone among my colonists, who were all 
Greeks. They knew I wanted to help them, and they let me 
have my own way. I had one civilized companion for awhile, 
David Urquhart, the eccentric Englishman, afterwards M. P. 
and pamphleteer. I had to journey much to and from Corinth, 
Napoli, etc., always on horseback, or in boat, and often by 
night. It was a time and place where law was not ; and some 
times we had to defend ourselves against armed and desperate 
stragglers from the bands of soldiers now breaking up. We had 
many " scrimmages," and I had several narrow escapes with 
life. In one affair Urquhart showed extraordinary pluck and 
courage, actually disarming and taking prisoner two robbers, 
and marching them before him into the village. I labored here 



1 The Stremma is 4,840 English square yards, above an acre. 



80 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

day and night, in season and out, and was governor, legislator, 
clerk, constable, and everything but patriarch; for, though I 
was young, I took to no maiden, nor ever thought about 
womankind but once. The Government (or rather, Capo d ls- 
tria, the President) treated the matter liberally for a Greek 
and did what he could to help me. 

I found at Athens, in 1870, the correspondence 
between Capo d Istria and Dr. Howe on this subject, 
printed in the great volumes of the unfortunate 
President s correspondence which his brother edited 
long afterwards. The colony was near the present 
railway station of Hexamilia, on the way from the 
new town of Corinth to Argos. It extended southeast 
from Hexamilia towards Cenchraea, and was nearer to 
the Isthmian sanctuary than to New Corinth, which 
was only founded in 1858. Old Corinth lay on the 
northwest side of Aero-Corinth, from Dr. Howe s 
village. Mrs. Howe gives these particulars of his 
visit there in 1844 : " To this spot his travels brought 
him after an interval of many years. As he rode 
through the principal street of the village the elder 
people began to take note of him, and to say one to 
another: This man looks like Howe., 1 At length 
they cried : It must be Howe himself ! His horse 
was surrounded, and his progress stayed. A feast 
was immediately prepared for him in the principal 
house of the place, and a throng of friends, old and 
new, gathered around him, eager to express their joy 
in seeing him. This is only one of many scenes 
which fully attested the grateful recollection in which 
his services were held by the people of Greece." 

Concerning his campaigns in Greece, Dr. Howe 
said in 1857 : 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 8l 

I liked the excitement immensely ; the dangers gave zest to 
it, and I was as happy as youth, health, a good cause, and toler 
ably clean conscience could make me. Inter nos I think I 
was unconscious of any purpose usually called selfish. I 
wanted no money, and got none. I did not think about other 
glory than the approval of those about me. These circum 
stances, I think, together with my familiarity with their lan 
guage, and my sharing their hardships, made me a favorite with 
the soldiers, the peasantry, etc. ; whereas most of the foreign 
ers were not so. They came usually for personal distinction, 
and for honor ; they were brave, longed to expose themselves, 
and be distinguished, and were generally discontented and dis 
appointed because there was hard fare, hard marches, and no 
glory. Many and many a poor fellow have I known Germans, 
Swiss, French, or English who came with high hopes and 
.ambition, who were only disappointed. Many could not bear 
to wait ; they disliked the poor fare, the exposure, the poverty ; 
but, above all, the lack of glory gazetting glory. Some were 
killed ; some were broken down and died on marches ; some 
took to raki (rum x ) ; some deserted, and but very few got off 
alive. My desire was to help along the cause. I cared not for 
what I ate, or what I wore, or whether anybody knew me ; and 
therefore the people and soldiers rather took to me. I had 
many friends in humble life, God help them ! I can say sincerely 
that I found the Greeks kindly affectioned, trustful, grateful, 
and, as far as my intercourse with them went, honest people. 
They always treated me as well as I wished to be treated. 

To these remarks there were some exceptions. Dr. 
Howe early learned to dislike Colocotroni, the old 
chieftain, once very prominent in the war for inde 
pendence, and whose grandchildren occupy honor 
able positions in the present kingdom of Greece. 
Colocotroni commanded in 1821 at the taking of 
Tripolitza, a rich town held by the Turks, and Howe 



More exactly, brandy. 



82 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

relates in his history how the chieftain enriched 
himself with the plunder of the inhabitants. " Among 
those who came out was a Jew, one of the richest 
men in the place, who wore in his belt a pair of rich 
gold-mounted pistols, sparkling with diamonds. 
These attracted the eye of Colocotroni. Ha ! 
cried he, a Jew, and armed ! this must not be; 
and seizing them, he stuck them into his own belt as 
a lawful prize. By treachery he gained, and by 
treachery he lost, them ; I saw them in 1827 glitter 
ing at the waist of Grivas, Commander of Napoli. 
Colocotroni had tried to bribe one of his soldiers to 
open the gate of the town in the night to him ; the sol 
dier took the pistols in part pay and presented them to 
his master, disclosing to him the plot." Concerning 
an experience of his own with Colocotroni, Dr. Howe 
said in 1857, after relating how he carried cargoes of 
gifts from America to Greece : 

A good part of one of the cargoes was lost to the people by 
reason of the ignorance of Greek affairs by one of the super 
cargoes. I was not at hand when he arrived, and one of the 
Palikari chiefs (Grivas, if I recollect) represented himself as 
the Government, and got a great haul for his soldiers. Colo 
cotroni also tried to get possession of five hundred barrels of 
flour which I had landed near Patras, and I had to beard the 
old savage. He threatened to shoot me ; but I was too " mad " 
to be a afraid, and he cooled off. I had despatched a messen 
ger to the American ship of war then lying by chance at 
Psara, and without knowing whether she would come, had told 
the old robber that she would fire into the town. Presently 
she did come up, and the captain sent to protect me as an 
American. 

This was Captain Patterson, on the famous frigate 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 83 

Constitution (" Old Ironsides"). In his volume of 
1828, Dr. Howe mentions this incident, and says : 
"Colocotroni stopped the distribution to the poor by 
force, and was preparing to divide the spoil with 
Grivas and Foutoumaris (they had not yet quarreled) 
when a spirited remonstrance from Captain Patter 
son procured the restoration of the provisions to the 
agent of the committee " who was Dr. Howe. 

This distribution of supplies took place before the 
colonization of Corinth, which was Howe s latest ser 
vice in the Greek revolution ; but he continued to 
interest himself in Greek affairs, and was warm 
against Capo d Istria in 1831. He then wrote: 

I am tired with citing instances of the illiberal and tyrrani- 
cal measures of Capo d Istria, or I could go on to show that he 
has in hundreds of instances violated public and private rights. 
Supported by the robber Colocotroni, and having in his pay some 
eight or ten thousand irregular troops, whom he pampers with 
the subsidies sent from Europe for the improvement of the 
people, his only object seems to be to rein-in the spirit of im 
provement which is abroad among the people, and to encour 
age only those feelings and those institutions which tend to 
secure obedience to his measures. If any one thing more than 
another has tended to disgust the Greeks with Capo d Istria 
and his measures, it is the introduction of a swarm of Corfi- 
otes, and other Sept-insulars, with which he has inundated the 
country and filled every office. Corfu having been under the 
protection (or rather jurisdiction) of England, its inhabitants 
not only took no part in the war of the revolution, but incurred 
the hatred and ill-will of the patriots engaged in the struggle, 
by a ridiculous affectation of superiority, aud by denying them 
selves to be Greeks they were English citizens forsooth ! Now 
Capo d Istria being a Corfiote, as soon as the dangers of the 
war were passed, not only his brothers and cousins, to the 



84 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

nineteenth generation, flocked over to enjoy the dear-bought 
liberties of the country, but hundreds of others followed, and 
were immediately put into office. Men were sent to govern 
towns and provinces where they had not only never heard a 
shot fired, but where they were regarded as strangers, if not 
enemies ; while the Mavrocordatos and the Tricoupis, the 
Miaulis and the Conduriottis, who had borne the heat and bur 
den of the war, were left in obscurity, or languished in honor 
able poverty, the new and unheard-of name of Yanitas and 
Viarros, of Mavroymi, and Mavromatis are mentioned in every 
degree of government. The elevation of Viarro, the Presi 
dent s eldest brother, to the higher offices in the State, is one of 
the most astonishing instances of his want of prudence and 
common political honesty. This man, taken from the mine of 
Corfu, at the age of sixty, is made at one and the same time 
Minister of War, and civil Governor of a large province, and 
charged pro tcm. with the Marine Department, and the General 
Intendancy of the Police ! His brother Augustin, a fool at fifty, 
a gray-headed dandy, a milksop, a man who had never worn 
an epaulette even on parade, or heard the thunder of a shotted 
gun, is suddenly placed at the head of the army, and saluted 
with the title of Lieutenant-General Commander-in-Chief of 
the Army of Western Greece ! ! Shades of Botzaris and 
Ulysses, startle ye at that sound ? 

Concerning the Greek character in 1831-32, Dr. 
Howe thus writes : 

We say the Greeks have received an extraordinary impulse 
which is sending them rapidly forward in the race of civiliza 
tion, of moral and political improvement; nor has this impulse 
been given within a few years; all intelligent travelers in 
Turkey within the last century have been struck with the 
difference between the Greeks and the Armenians, the Jews 
and other nations placed in circumstances exactly similar to 
their own, under the gripe of the Porte. W T hile the latter have 
remained stationary, content to be the hewers of wood and the 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 85 

drawers of water for their haughty masters, the subtle Greeks, 
improving every opportunity of gaining knowledge and 
enlightenment from Europe, gradually insinuated themselves 
into power aud place, until the Divan or Constantinople pre 
sented the curious political anomaly of a despotic power virtu 
ally wielded by slaves ; for who does not know that the Soutzos, 
the Mavrocordatos and the other Greek Dragomans (interpre 
ters to the Porte), had unbounded influence in its councils for 
many years in succession ? When we reflect on what this truly 
intellectual people have been ; when we consider that every 
thing which remains of them shows how they were in advance 
even of our proud age in many important points ; when we see 
our sculptors and our architects, our poets and our orators, 
making their mightiest efforts, exerting the boldest stretches 
of their genius merely to imitate the mutilated and imperfect 
fragments of Grecian works which have come down to us over 
a waste of two thousand years ; when we see, I say, that their 
descendants possess the same happy physical organization, 
inhabit the same delicious and salubrious clime, and are mani 
festing some glimmering of rekindling spirit, we cannot but 
indulge the hope that something great may yet be expected 
from them. 

The hope of Greece is in her rising generation ; in those 
young and elastic spirits whose energies, and whose manly feel 
ings have never been crushed by the weight of Turkish despot 
ism. But if this rising generation is educated into submission 
to, and reverence for, a government which violates every right 
of the citizen, and mocks at the palladium of the Constitution, 
how can they acquire the stern feeling of independence which 
animates the freeman to a disregard of every personal interest 
in the acquisition of true civil liberty ? It were better that the 
fear of the bowstring and the scimitar should have kept the 
fathers a few years longer in order, than that the sons should 
serve such a political apprenticeship as makes them the willing 
tools of a despot. The Greek revolution was the birthday of 
the Greek nation, which had been, to all intents and purposes, 
politically dead. It is of immense importance that the political 



86 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

education of the people should be a good one ; it is of conse 
quence not only to their improvement and civilization, but to 
the future peace and tranquility of the country. 

In one of his journeys from Corinth to Napoli, in 
1829-30, Howe delayed by night on the marshy 
plain of Argos, and took the fever of the swamp, 
which assumed a very severe type, and he came near 
dying. Finally he was obliged to leave the country 
in the spring of 1830, but had the satisfaction of 
knowing that Greece was free. He went through 
Italy, and tarried awhile in Switzerland to get 
thoroughly free from his fever in the mountain air. 
In July, 1830, he was in Paris, and saw all the July 
Revolution of the " three days" "I had before seen 
something of Lafayette," he wrote, " and when he 
finally resolved to put himself at the head of the 
revolt, I made one of the small band who escorted 
him from his home to the Hotel de Ville. I knew it 
was none of my business, but I could not help joining 
in and cheering on the revolution. Afterwards I 
went to Brussels and saw part of the scrimmage there." 
This resulted, soon after, in the independence of 
Belgium. He next attended lectures in Paris during 
the winter of 1830-31, seeing much of Lafayette, and of 
Cooper, the novelist, who then lived in Paris. In 1831 
he returned to the United States, and cast about what 
to du, for he did not like to enter on the practice of 
his doctor s profession. " I had then a good deal of 
nonsense about me, and I did not like the notion of 
charging money for medical services." He had some 
negotiation about taking charge of the negro colony 
of Liberia, but happily it failed. In the meantime he 
wrote much about Greece and the Orient, and became 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 87 

interested through his friend, Dr. Fisher, in the pro 
ject for teaching the blind in Boston. " In a few 
days I made an arrangement to take charge of the 
enterprise, then only in embryo, and started at once 
for Europe, to get the necessary information, engage 
teachers, etc., and I visited the schools in France and 
England." He was also visiting Germany on the 
same errand, when more important things detained 
him, as we shall now see. 



CHAPTER VII. 

IMPRISONMENT IN BERLIN. 

IN the winter of 1831-32, being in Paris with Lafay 
ette, Cooper, the American novelist, and other 
friends of the defeated Poles, whose insurrection 
against the Czar Nicholas had been suppressed in the 
autumn previous, Dr. Howe was made chairman of 
an " American-Polish Committee," and, at the sug 
gestion of Lafayette, who gave him a letter of instruc 
tions, he undertook to visit Prussian Poland, and 
carry money for clothing and food to the Polish 
refugees along the Vistula and in the neighborhood 
of Elbing. It was a delicate mission, and risky, but 
Dr. Howe performed it, and did carry the funds and 
distribute them, much to the relief of the patriots 
and the annoyance of the Prussian Government, by 
whose orders he was secretly arrested and imprisoned 
upon his return to Berlin. There he lay in a cell 
alone, in secret, some six weeks, and suffered not a 
little. He says in the autobiograhy, "I did contrive 
to make friends with the turnkey, and got some 
letters out, before I was finally liberated and pitched 
over the French frontier by night." These letters 
have been preserved, and will presently be given. I 
have heard Dr. Howe relate this adventure never

unless he was urged to do so but then with interest 
and amusement. Ordinarily he took the same view 
of his exploits and perils that Trelawny expresses 
concerning his own adventures in Greece. " Our 
ambuscades, onslaughts, rock-fighting, forays," says 
Trelawny, 1 " stalking Turkish cavalry, intermingled 
with conferences, treaties, squabbles, intrigue and 
constant change, were exciting at the time ; so was 
the Caffre war to those engaged in it ; but as they 
are neither edifying nor amusing to write, nor to read 
about, I shall not record them." Howe, writing to 
Horace Mann in 1857, before Trelawny s book 
was published, said : " I, of course, led an adven 
turous life, and had some hair-breadth escapes but 
they are not worth recalling. I have never thought 
them of any importance, and avoided talking about 
them, even to intimate friends." This time, however, 
he made an exception to the rule, and related to his 
colleagues of the Board of State Charities, in 1872, 
how he had fared at the hands of the Prussian sol 
diers and police forty years before. He said that, when 
ordered to leave the Polish frontier, he mounted his 
horse and journeyed southwest towards Berlin, with 
out concern. But in course of the first day he noticed 
a horseman or two following him, not overtaking 
or seemingly wishing to overtake him ; but only to 
keep him in sight across those vast plains of Prussian 
Poland. He entered Berlin and went to his hotel, 
conscious that he might be visited by the police; and 
so he was, the same evening. He had taken Lafay 
ette s letter and some other compromising papers, and

put them up the hollow head of a bust of the King of 
Prussia, which surmounted his great stove ; then he 
tore up a few unimportant papers and threw them 
into the stove, and into the wash-basin ; this being 
done, he admitted the police officers, who gathered 
up the pieces in sight, but did not search for treason 
in the head of the old king. They took him to 
prison the last day of February, 1832, and when he 
was released, in April, he never went back to his room 
at the hotel, but a friend afterwards found his papers 
safe there, and carried them to him in France. He 
was released at the demand of Mr. W. C. Rives, of 
Virginia, who was then American Minister at Paris, 
and who became aware of his secret imprisonment by 
a fortunate accident. Dr. Howe, on the day of his 
arrival in Berlin, had met a friend from America, 
Albert Brisbane, the well-known disciple of Fourier, 
who, calling the next day at the hotel named on Dr. 
Howe s card, could find no trace of him. It was 
denied that any American had been there, but Mr. 
Brisbane, learning the visit of the police the night 
before, became suspicious, and wrote at once to Mr. 
Rives. The case was investigated, and a requisition 
made upon the Prussian Government for the person 
of an American citizen, unjustly detained. " After 
repeated denials on the one hand, and a creditable 
persistence on the other," says Mrs. Howe, the point 
was yielded, and Dr. Howe regained his liberty, but 
not until he had made a journey of six hundred miles 
in a carriage with two gendarmes, who released him 
just outside the Prussian frontier, with an admoni 
tion never to cross it again. The rest of the story 
may be given in Howe s own words :

TWO LETTERS TO DR. JOHN D. FISHER. 

BERLIN PRISON, ) 
March 20, 1832. \ 

I have oft dated my letters to you from queer, out-of-the- 
way places ; from city and from camp, from mountain, from 
cottage, and, I believe, from caverns ; but never did it enter 
into my imagination that I should write you from the cell of a 
prison ; and that, too, by stealth, on a bit of brown paper (in 
which my candle had been wrapped), with a stub of a pencil 
coaxed from a turnkey, and by the glimmer of light that comes 
from a close-grated window. Yet so it is ; here I am, as sure 
and fast as bars and bolts and stone walls can keep me. Here 
I have been for the last twenty days, and here may I be for the 
next twenty months, for aught I know. But that I am in prison 
is not all ; that my cell is but eight feet wide, is not the worst 
of it ; my imprisonment is of a kind which to us poor ignorant 
mortals in America is unknown. It is called the (au secret} 
secret ; that is, no one can write to me, or send me a word of 
consolation ; nor can I communicate my situation to a single 
friend ; even a newspaper is prohibited, lest perchance I should 
see that some one had got notice of my being in prison. 

Good Heaven! you will say, has the fellow plotted high 
treason, or shot one of the King s deer, or refused to give the 
wall to a prince of the blood ? Neither, my dear sir ; nor any 
other human law have I broken, that I know of; but, though 
I have again and again vainly called for a copy of the accusa 
tions against me ; though I have demanded to know my 
offence, and to be confronted with my accusers ; though I have 
appealed to the laws of the land, and to judgment ; and though 
to all these my demands, I have not been able to get the least 
answer, still I cannot pretend ignorance of my offence. It is 
rank ! It smells to Heaven ! I have administered some suc 
cor and consolation to that gallant remnant of the Polish army, 
which took refuge in Prussia. I have endeavored to distribute 
to the poor, half-naked soldiers, the generous contributions of 
the American public ; and the tangible proof which they received 



Q2 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

of its sympathy at a moment when they thought themselves 
abandoned by all the world so encouraged them, and enraged 
the Prussian authorities, that the latter have rewarded me with 
this lodging gratis. I am, aux frais de VEtat, the nation s 
guest ; that is the only explanation I can give of it. 

But I forgot that you are probably unacquainted with that 
which has been continually in my mind for the two months 
past, viz., the singularly interesting, I may say heroic, situation 
of this last relic of the gallant army of Poland. At the end of 
their bloody struggle, being determined never to yield to, or 
live under, the Russians, they entered the Prussian territories, 
and laid down their arms, on the condition of being left at full 
liberty to direct their steps .whither they would. For the last 
two months, however, every possible measure has been taken 
to induce them to reenter Poland. But it being found that 
argument, entreaties, and threats, were alike useless, as long as 
the officers remained with their men, these were separated from 
them those officers being dragged away by force who hesi 
tated to obey ; and a few only succeded in remaining, by dis 
guising themselves as common soldiers. It was a sad day 
that of parting ; it seemed like separating a band of brothers ; 
and many an officer, feigning, or really making himself sick, 
remained weeks afterwards near his men, receiving news 
from them only by night. The officers were sent off to France, 
whither they all demanded to go ; and you might have seen 
these gallant fellows, without their swords, their once splendid 
uniforms soiled and torn, seated by dozens, on bundles of straw 
in the carts of the peasantry, and transported along the high 
roads in midwinter, leaving behind them country and home, 
and all they held dear, going they hardly knew whither. I 
shall never forget the day, when at Dirrone, a little village near 
the Vistula, 3 I met with three cartloads of these heroes, all 
young and splendid-looking fellows. Our stage-coach had

stopped at the tavern, and a dozen people were standing at the 
door; as the carts passed, the Germans gazed with their round 
unmeaning eyes ; but not a voice was heard, not a hand was 
raised, not a hat was waved in the air. There was no sympathy 
in their souls, or if there was, they dared not express it ; for the 
Argus eyes of the police were there. I forgot the police and 
everything else but the feelings natural to man ; and impru 
dently yielding to that impulse, I waved my hat in the air, and 
shouted, "Honneur! Honneur aux braves!" The Poles 
looked up, surprised at the sound, and pointed me out to each 
other ; as they raised their caps to return my salute, they cried, 
" Vive la France ! " Poor fellows, they took me for a Frenchman ; 
they had, as yet, found so little sympathy, that they seemed 
astonished at this instance of it; and, as they waved their caps, 
long after passing me, and endeavored to express their thanks 
in their looks, it so affected me, that I turned away to hide a 
womanish weakness ; and left the Germans to stare and wonder 
what the de il could have moved me. 

You know (or you do not know) that while in Paris I had 
taken much interest in the fate of the refugees ; and when I was 
about to leave for Germany, it was proposed to me by General 
Lafayette, and the American committee, that I should take 
charge of part of the contributions, and aid with them such of 
the Poles as I should fall in with, and who should be suffering ; 
and this I most gladly undertook. On my route hither I met many 
who seemed badly in need, but most of them would not own it ; 
they wanted, they said, to get to France ; and some to whom I 
sent assistance returned me the half, as being more than they 
needed ; but all begged me to go to their soldiers, from whom 
they had been separated as by force. " There," said they, " you 
may do good you may save them from entering Poland, from 
worse than death ; they are abandoned by all whom they can call 
friends, and your presence will cheer and encourage them ; for 
you have with you the tangible proof of the sympathy of your 
generous countrymen. Go and see with your own eyes, the 
most devoted and generous soldiery in the world." " Alas ! " said 
several, " our poor ignorant soldiers are better than we better 



94 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

than our leaders ; they felt only love for Poland, and hatred to 
Russia ; we had other passions. But go go and see the poor 
fellows ; many will be in want of clothing before now." 

Could I hesitate ? When I had finished my affairs in Ber 
lin, I started off to see with my own eyes the situation of the 
soldiers, hoping there at once to find proper objects on whom 
to bestow all the charities of which I was the bearer. I found 
them indeed suffering, morally and physically; that is, depressed 
in spirits, and anxious about the future, and but miserably clad, 
very many being entirely shirtless. To my surprise, too, I 
found I could not give them anything without demanding per 
mission of the Prussian commander ; this I did, nor could he 
refuse me, though he granted a growling, unwilling assent. I 
immediately set about making a contract for shirts, etc. ; but 
before they were finished, I received an order to quit the 
neighborhood of the army instantly ; an order accompanied by 
a force to put it in execution. It was in vain that I pleaded the 
protection which my passport gave me that I urged the per 
mission given me by the commander, Schmidt ; he, himself, had 
given the counter-order, and forbade me distributing anything 
to the Poles, or seeing them, even in the presence of a Prussian 
officer. " You have had time," said he, " to make your contract ; 
let your distribution be made by Prussian agents." I wished to 
give the things myself to tell the poor fellows whence they 
came, and comfort them with the assurance of the sympathy 
felt for them in America. But the aid-de-camp hurried me off 
nolens volens. 

I came then to Berlin to attend to my affairs, little thinking 
I was running my head into a trap ; for, though in the order 
which I received from Schmidt to quit the army, he told me 
that I was suspected of being an emissary, I was so confident 
in my own innocence, that I despised the thought of skulking out 
of Prussia as I might have done, and slipped into Saxony. 
What was my astonishment, then, on arriving here, to find 
myself arrested, stripped of everything, lugged to prison, and 
locked up in a cell, without being able to get one word of 
explanation. The next day came the long-faced, solemn scribe, 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 95 

to question me on the events of my life, beginning with my 
sorry birth; writing down my answers without ever lifting his 
little eyes from his paper, and going off with my whole biog 
raphy under his arm, without ever thanking me for the informa 
tion. Then came cross-questionings, and pumpings of various 
kinds, but no communications to me from without ; no assur 
ance that my friends knew what had become of me. All this, 
you may imagine, did put up my Yankee blood ; and perhaps 
my answers were not always obsequious enough for the atmos 
phere ; nevertheless, they were true ones. For the last ten 
days, however, I have been left alone ; and, though I cannot 
find out of what I am accused, I am not tormented by ques 
tions. 

Do what you choose with the general information I have 
given you, but do not publish this letter with my name, which 
has been thrust too much on the public. But if, however, by the 
next packet you should not hear of my release, then, for God s 
sake, do what you can for me. I appear to make light of it, 
and show a bold front, but I assure you it is no trifle ; we have 
no ambassadors here ; I am in the hands of arbitrary men ; I 
have served a cause which they detest ; and my heart sinks at 
the thought of my strength wasting away in this miserable cell, 
and my health gradually giving way under the influence of the 
foul, unwholesome air I breathe. Others have suffered years 
for but light words spoken ; and it may be that I have given 
mortal offence by cheering and encouraging those whom it 
seems to have been their object to reduce by utter despair. 

March 24, 1832. 

MY DEAR FISHER I should be perfectly miserable could I 
suppose that you should not have received the letter which I 
wrote you from Berlin previous to my leaving it, on the busi 
ness it was my duty to be about, for what I supposed would be 
a six or ten days affair, but which has, to my surprise, as well 
as my grief and indignation, led to my imprisonment. I say, I 
should be miserable, for in that case it might be supposed that 



96 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

I had engaged in some political intrigue ; that I had neglected 
the duties of my mission, and got into prison through my own 
fault. I trust, however, that you did get that letter, which will 
explain how, acting upon the spirit of my engagement, I con 
sidered myself at liberty to make " some little digression from 
my route, at my own expense." And in leaving Berlin for 
Elbing, 1 I thought of doing a deed only of charity and of 
humanity ; which might, indeed, get me the ill-will of a govern 
ment like that of Russia or Austria, but not of one so civilized 
and Christian as Prussia. I was free from all political connec 
tion, or design ; and yet (do you believe it ?) I cannot persuade 
them here that even my voyage to Europe had not a political 
object in view. They think that my examining the institutions 
for the blind in Germany was but a pretext to cover another 
intention ; and acting up to this, and in the absence of any 
representative of our government here, they have dared 
imprison me, put me an secret, and have kept me here three 
weeks without even telling me of what I am suspected ! 

This will sound strange in your ears, that in a country like 
Prussia, where laws and judges exist, a stranger should thus be 
shut up in the cell of a common prison ; that he should not be 
permitted to see a soul, nor receive a line from a friend, nor an 
assurance that his friends know what has become of him. It 
is only within a day or two that I have been permitted to write, 
and as my letters must pass under the eyes of those who have 
thus cruelly trampled on my rights, and the laws of justice, I 
must speak of my treatment in such qualified terms as my 
indignation will permit me, lest they should not permit my Jet- 
ters to pass. I ll be cool, then, and let you know where and 
how I am snug enough, between four granite walls, in a wee 
bit cell, fast barred and bolted, and writing b} the light which 
comes in from a little grated window, or air hole, eight feet 
from the floor. I am kept in perfect seclusion ; not a news 
paper is allowed, to tell me how the world wags without ; and 



1 A town then of 20,000 people, thirty-five miles southeast of 
Dantzic, and near the Polish frontier. 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 97 

not a sound disturbs my meditations, save the clang of the sen 
tinel s heel, as he paces up and down the corridor. 
" Tis a weary life this, 
Arches above, and bolts and bars around me ; " 

But I keep a good heart, and recollect when I was shut up in 
a little castle in Candia, 1 with no food but biscuit, and the Mos 
lem dogs whetting their sabres to dissect us when we should 
have eaten all our bread, and been forced to come out. Even 
as I escaped then, shall I be again delivered from the Philis 
tines who persecute me. As for food, I do not complain in 
that respect ; plain food is no hardship for me, but though I 
had Very s or Beauvillier s bill of fare to choose from, still 
wonld I say, 

" Give me a morsel on the green sward rather, 
Coarse as you will the cooking; let the fresh spring 
Bubble beside my napkin, and the free birds 
Twittering and chirping, hop from bough to bough 
To claim the crumbs I leave for perquisites : 
Your prison feasts I like not." 

It is not this which torments me it is the delay, it is the loss 
of time, it is the distracting thought that it may be supposed at 
home that I have neglected my duty. Let no conclusion be 
drawn till I am heard in my defence. Were I free from any 
engagement, I would hold this imprisonment as a mere trifle. 
I would laugh at men who can thus punish me for doing what 
they must approve if they have a spark of humanity. 

I went to carry comfort and consolation to the gallant relic 
of that army of heroes who fought so long and so gloriously in 
the purest cause man can draw sword for ; they were aban 
doned by all the world, as they thought ; they were suffering 
physically and morally ; they were standing on the frontiers of 
Prussia, near to their own lost land, yet resisting every effort to 
induce them to enter it. I went in the name of thousands of my 
fellow-citizens to clothe those who were naked, and to say to all 



1 The fortress of Grabousa in 1826, mentioned on page 78. 



98 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

that they had the sympathies and the hearty good wishes of 
America. I did this openly at midday, and for a reward I have 
the solitary cell of a common prison. I am put into the abode 
of murderous thieves and outlaws ; yet, from the bottom of my 
cell, I can put my hand on my heart, and say sincerely, I would 
not change situations with those who have thought it their 
duty to put me here. How long my imprisonment may last I 
know not, nor should the thought of that annoy me, were it not 
for my engagement in America that is the thorn in my side. 
However, let me make the best of it ; I could not have got home 
before the rising of Congress, we could not have done much 
without assistance from the different Legislatures, and the 
Trustees will be relieved from all expenses during the time I 
am not employed about their business. Besides, it may be that 
the Trustees granted the request which I addressed them from 
Paris, to have permission to quit their business long enough to 
visit the Colony which I established in Greece. The Colony, 
God bless it! am I not a happy fellow (dear Fisher), hardly 
thirty, and a bachelor, to have two hundred children for all 
the Colonists call me patera which in the vernacular means 
" Father." 

I say, in case the Trustees granted that request (though I 
always acted on the supposition that they would not), I shall be 
a happy fellow. I would cheerily support my misfortune, since 
they imagine the poor services I have rendered the unfortunate 
Poles are important enough to merit a long imprisonment. I 
will try to civilize the spiders in my cell, or find out whether 
there are any blind among the bed-bugs ; or, perchance I can 
tame the mouse that nibbles my slipper. Poor fellow ! he must 
fare hard here, to come to that ; I have, in my day, eaten jack 
ass meat, but never tried the hide ; nevertheless, with the aid 
of Papin s Digester. But a truce with joking, I am rambling 
from home to Greece, from Greece to Poland, and even into 
a Digester; you ll think me mad and not sad. But I have 
need to keep my spirits rattling about everything but the dark 
side of the prospect before me ; which (I fear not to contem 
plate it, however) is that of long confinement, of hope 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 99 

deferred, of strength gradually wasting away from inaction 
of health yielding to the attacks of anxiety and the influence of 
the foul, unwholesome air I breathe. But no ! before that, my 
country will make her voice heard ; I trust she will not let the 
humblest of her citizens long suffer as unjustly and undeserv 
edly as I do. 

I say I can look on the very worst side of the picture, without 
flinching, or feeling inclined to crouch and cringe, and beg for 
giveness. No ! I am proud of what I have done, I shall ever 
be so. Let not then my friends have any anxiety about my per 
sonal safety. I trust ere long to assure them and you of that in 
person, as also how truly I remain your friend, 

SAMUEL G. HOWE. 

P. S. I have got hold of some German works on the educa 
tion of the blind. I did not know of their existence in France. 
I hope, if pen and paper are granted me here, to translate some 
good things. If by the next packet you hear not of my libera 
tion, then do all that can be done for me. I trust our govern 
ment will know how to redress the wrongs done its citizens. 

Dr. Howe s fellow-countrymen in Paris, who had 
served with him on the American Polish Committee, 
felt bound, upon his return to France from his Prus 
sian dungeon, to explain to the world how and why 
he had acted as he did. Accordingly Mr. Cooper and 
Prof. Morse prepared, and the other members of the 
committee signed with them, the following paper: 

STATEMENT OF THE AMERICAN COMMITTEE IN PARIS. 

The moment of terminating its trust having arrived, the 
American Polish Committee believes itself bound to render an 
account of its organization and proceedings to that portion of 
their fellow- citizens whose liberality was the cause of its exist 
ence. 



100 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

The manner in which the contributions for the succor of the 
Poles was made is generally known. The money was remitted 
to General Lafayette, with the request that he would see it 
handed over to the Polish treasury, in the event of its being 
received in time to be of aid in the struggle ; with an under 
standing that it was to be applied to the relief of the sufferers, 
should it be too late for the principal object. The first remit 
tance having arrived in France after the fall of Warsaw, the 
money was necessarily devoted to its second destination. Had 
it reached him earlier, the task of General Lafayette would 
have been limited to paying it over and receiving in return 
vouchers which he would have been able to show to all inter 
ested. Bnt, under the circumstances, he found himself pos 
sessed of considerable sums, without any direct responsibility, 
and, we may add, charged with duties of a laborious and deli 
cate character, which his other employments would scarcely 
permit him to perform with sufficient fidelity. With his usual 
tact and judgment, he decided to appeal to the Americans at 
Paris for assistance. 

The American Polish Committee was formed in obedience to 
the written requisition of General Lafayette. The Committee 
assumed the office of keeping the accounts, of investigating the 
merits of applicants for relief, of deciding on their reception, 
and of doing all things properly connected with the faithful dis 
charge of a trust so sacred. As the members of the Com 
mittee felt, however, that they were unauthorized to act by 
those who had furnished the contributions, the resolutions of 
organization were so framed as to contain a clause which ren 
dered it necessary to the validity of their acts to refer all their 
decisions to General Layfayette. Although the accounts were 
kept by the Committee through their Secretary, the money 
was deposited to the credit of General Lafayette, and was only 
drawn for use by his drafts. The Committee deems these ex 
planations necessary to i!s own vindication in assuming pow 
ers with which it was not more regularly invested. 

Dr. Samuel G. Howe, of Massachusetts, having been espe 
cially named in communications from America as commis- 



YOUTHFUL DARING. IOI 

sioner to act in behalf of some of the contributors, and having 
been particularly designated in the requisitions of General Lafay 
ette as one whom he would wish to see on the Committee, was 
appointed its Chairman. This choice was made, in addition to 
the considerations connected with the personal claims of the 
candidate, in deference to the wish of General Lafayette, and 
as furnishing the nearest approach that the case allowed, to 
what might be esteemed the selection of a respectable portion 
of the contributors at home. Several weeks elapsed after 
the regular organization ot the Committee without an appli 
cation for relief. This unexpected forbearance on the part of 
the emigrants is to be ascribed to several causes. Few reached 
Paris, with the exception of those who were in possession of 
more or less means. The sympathies of the French were pow 
erfully awakened, and the disposal of their succor, which was 
of magnificent amount, admitted of a more regular and con 
tinued system than it was believed would comport with the 
delicacy that strangers in the country were bound to observe ; 
and we should do great injustice to the noble-minded men who 
are the victims of the unsuccessful effort to gain the independ 
ence of Poland, did we not add, that in several instances our 
offers were declined, gratefully it is true, but with a proud 
reliance on their personal efforts for support. At this 
moment, when we were periodically assembling without being 
able to effect much in behalf of those for whom the succor 
had been intended, it became apparent that it was the policy 
of the States adjoining Poland to force the refugees back 
into the power of their enemies. In addition to this, which 
of itself made a strong appeal to the sympathies of every just 
mind, we had reason to think, that while our money was use 
less at Paris, it might relieve many brave men at a distance, 
who were actually suffering for the necessaries of life. In 
this view of the case it was decided to remit a portion of 
our funds to Germany. 

It was an important consideration to find a suitable agent. 
Luckily, our Chairman was about to visit the North, in further 
ance of the views which had brought him to Europe. He ac- 



102 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

cepted the trust with a condition, that he was not bound to 
proceed further than was consistent with his other duties. 
With this understanding, a large portion of our funds were 
placed in his hands, and he left Paris clothed with this charit 
able mission in the month of January. A part of the money 
confided to Dr. Howe was distributed by that gentleman him 
self to different Poles, and the remainder was left with confi 
dential persons to be applied as he had directed. We are grieved 
to be compelled to say, that while he \vas thus employed, Dr. 
Howe, who, it was understood, acted with the entire approbation 
of the Prussian local authorities, was peremptorily commanded 
to leave the part of Prussia where the Poles were quartered. 
He instantly obeyed, taking the road to Berlin. Here it would 
appear, he was arrested, shut up in prison, and cut off from 
all communication with his countrymen. At the end of more 
than a month, he was sent through the intermediate States of 
Germany to France, being escorted the whole distance by 
Prussian gendarmes. We are told, it was pretended that Dr. 
Howe was engaged in a mission that produced an indisposition 
in the Polish soldiers to return to Poland, which was declared 
to be an offence against the laws of Prussia. It is unfortunate 
that the Prussian authorities did not find it convenient to vindi- 
dicate themselves in the open and loyal manner in which all 
just acts may be vindicated, but that recourse was had to 
secrecy ; and violent measures are calculated to throw distrust 
on the intentions of all who practice them. Dr. Howe says he 
remonstrated against the manner in which he was banished 
from Prussia, that he denied having violated any law, and that 
he repeatedly demanded a trial.

LAFAYETTE S COMMENDATION OF DR. HOWE.

My dear Sir The Address from our American-Polish Com

communication to the fellow-citizens who have bestowed their 
confidence upon us, could not but meet my cordial approbation 
and sympathy. Conscious as we are to have done for the best 
in the execution of their philanthropic intentions, it must be 
also an object of patriotic gratification to think that their 
donations, at the same time they have relieved misfortune, 
highly interesting, have done great and extensive credit to the 
American character. For this happy result, I shall take every 
opportunity to say, that we are chiefly owing to the manner in 
which Dr. Howe has acquitted himself of the mission entrusted 
to his care. While we are to thank him for the correctness of 
his conduct, and the enlightened zeal of his exertions, we find 
in those circumstances, and the other proceedings of the Com 
mittee, in concert with me, new motives to be proud of the 
part acted by American donators, and to cherish the hope of a 
continued interest of the people of the United States in behalf 
of heroic Poland, and her exiled sons, whenever occasion offers 
for its emancipation. I am happy in this opportunity ttrtjffer 
my personal acknowedgments to the Chairman, Secretary, 
and Members of the Committee, who will ever find in me a 
grateful, affectionate fellow-citizen, and friend.

Dr. Howe was released from this prison after a 
confinement of five weeks, during which he paid 
board to his jailer, and it is whispered, won the favor 
of the jailer s daughter, who saw that he was pro 
vided with writing materials. Years afterward, when 
the King of Prussia gave him a gold medal for his 
philanthropic achievements in teaching the blind, Dr. 
Howe had the curiosity to weigh it, and found that 
its value, in money, was equal to the sum which he 
had paid the Prussian Government for his prison 
board and lodging in 1832. 

But in 1843, when he visited Europe again, and 
desired to go with his friend, Horace Mann, to Berlin, 
the Government of Prussia refused him permission 
to reenter the country, out of which he had been 
escorted by two gendarmes, for many miles, in 1832. 
Horace Mann, writing to Dr. Howe in London 
(July 16, 1843), from Berlin, has this to say of that 
matter : 



" It was not until our arrival here that we became fully 
aware of your situation. This we learned from Mr. Wheaton 
(the American Minister), and it has been with the deepest 
regret that we have learned from him, day after day, that no 
answer has been received from the Government in reply to his 
application for your admission. In the meantime I consider it 
a compliment, though an inconvenient one, to you. I under 
stand the King of Prussia has about 200,000 men constantly 
under arms, and, if necessary, he can increase his force to 
2,000,000. This shows the estimation in which he holds your 
single self ; which, so far as the Monarch of Prussia can confer 
honor upon you, is highly honorable to you and creditable to 
your country. If he is so afraid of one American citizen, how 
much must he respect the whole country ? But you are no 



YOUTHFUL DARING. 105 

common citizen, and probably you have occupied his thoughts 
more than General Jackson or John Tyler." * 

With this adventure in Prussia ended the first 
period of Dr. Howe s life what we have called his 
" Youthful Daring." Writing in July, 1832, Dr. 
Howe said, in the New England Magazine (Sep 
tember, 1832): "Thomas Campbell said to us but a 
few weeks ago : Your country is a glorious, a happy 
land, and I would soon be treading her shores did I 
not think it the duty of every patriotic Englishman 
to stand by his country in the storm which may ere 
long burst upon her. America is the watchword, 
the rallying-cry of all the discontented in Europe ; 
the republican in France, the patriot in Spain and 
Italy, the optimist in Germany, and the liberal every 
where point to her national prosperity as a striking 
contrast to their national misery. Let then, the Ameri 
can who distrusts the excellence of our political insti 
tutions, look at distracted and convulsed England, let 
him cross to distracted and unhappy France, or look 
on gagged Italy and on bleeding Poland and he 
will hurry home, blessing God that his lines have 
fallen in pleasant places." In this spirit he returned 
home. He was now thirty-one years old ; he had 
undertaken an important work of philanthropy the 
education of the blind and he was to devote him 
self to this and to kindred good works for 
the next twenty years. But his eight years 
service in the cause of national freedom in other 
lands which was to be supplemented by twenty 
years struggle in the same cause at home (from 



1 Presidents respectively in 1832 and 1843. 



ICG DR. S. G. HOWE. 

1845 to 1865), had left their mark ineffaceably 
upon his character. He had entered on his chival 
rous career ; he had guarded his arms, won his spurs, 
and proved his knighthood by deeds as valorous and 
patient as those of any chevalier of the Middle Ages. 
He had indeed lived the life of the Middle Ages in 
the Nineteenth Century ; for Greece and Turkey, 
Poland and Russia, in their contests, repeated the 
barbarism, the superstition, the ferocity and the sim 
plicity of that Age of Chivalry which has been cele 
brated in so many romances :

Without reproach or fear ! 
Said I not well that Bayards 

And Sidneys still are here ? "

CHARLES DICKENS (1842 American Notes). 



CHAPTER I. 

BOSTON IN THE DAYS OF JACKSON, ADAMS, AND 
WEBSTER. 

PHILANTHROPY is not an American invention. The 
name indicates a Greek origin, and it received some 
commentary from Bacon in one of his Essays, where 
he says : " I take goodness in this sense the affecting 
of the weal of men which is that the Grecians call 
Philanthropia; and the word Humanity (as it is used) 
is a little too light to express it. This, of all virtues 
and dignities of the mind, is the greatest, being the 
character of the Deity; and, without it, man is a busy, 
mischievous, wretched thing, no better than a kind of 
vermin." But though philanthropy was discovered 
before Boston was, there are few places in the world 
where it has been practiced better, or carried to 
higher degrees of activity than in Boston and Massa 
chusetts. So evident was this in 1842, when Charles 
Dickens first saw Boston, that he says: * 

" I sincerely believe that the public institutions and 
charities of this capital of Massachusetts are as nearly 
perfect as the most considerate wisdom, benevolence, 
and humanity, can make them. I never in my life 
was more affected by the contemplation of happiness, 
under circumstances of privation and bereavement, 
than in my visits to these establishments."

110 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

It was of Dr. Howe s school for the Blind that 
Dickens was specially thinking, when he wrote this, 
though other noble philanthropies entered his 
thought; and it was to Dr. Howe more than to any 
one man that Massachusetts then owed, and still 
owes, what is best in her charitable system. He had 
shown his great capacity for philanthropic work by 
his masterly administration of the gifts sent to the 
Greeks in 1827-28, but his first definite task was the 
organization of the Asylum for the Blind, between 
1832 and 1842. In the first thirty years of his 
life Dr. Howe was exhibiting his character rather 
than performing his true work, or perhaps we might 
better describe this period as his apprenticeship, and 
his journey-work the Lehrjahre and Wanderjahre ot 
the great German romance. He was now, in the 
summer of 1832, about to begin on his actual task in 
life, the uplifting of the race by education, and by 
the creation of an original institution of philanthropy. 
Such, in fact, was the Massachusetts School and 
Asylum for the Blind the pioneer of such establish 
ments in America, and the most illustrious of its class 
in the world. Horace Mann, who knew what an edu 
cational success is, if ever any man did, said of it in 
1841, before it was yet ten years old: "I would 
rather have built up the Blind Asylum, than have 
written Hamlet, and one day everybody will think 
so." It was, in fact, a work of constructive genius, 
though of a less poetic imagination, worthy to be com 
pared with Hamlet or any great drama; and the true 
place of Dr. Howe is not with men of talent, like 
Horace Mann and Theodore Parker, but with men of 
genius like Emerson and Carlyle, who were his con- 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. Ill 

temporaries. He foresaw the result long before he 
reached it, as men of genius do and he fructified 
numberless disciples, emulators, and imitators, as 
Carlyle and Emerson also have done. Like them, 
too, he was not very consecutive in his work. He 
planted for others to reap the harvest, and, while men 
were admiring what he had achieved, he had already 
quitted that achievement, and was passing on to 
something newer. " There is hope," said Emerson, 
" of a future world, where we shall not repeat the 
same experiences forever, but go forward to new 
ones;" and that also was the hope and the practice of 
Howe. When his arrow had once hit the mark, he 
did not repeat the shot, but aimed higher, until the 
shaft kindled in the air, like that of Virgil s Trojan 
archer, and flew onward toward Olympus. He was, 
therefore, ever unsatisfied, unresting; the goal receded 
as he gained it, and a new ambition constantly 
replaced his earlier ones. 

The Boston of Dr. Howe s philanthropic period 
was a very different place from what it now is, and 
had broadened and beautified itself greatly since his 
boyhood at the Latin school. Fanny Kemble, visit 
ing it for the first time in 1833, when she was a bril 
liant and admired actress, and before her unfortunate 
marriage to Pierce Butler of Georgia, thus described 
it : " As a town, Boston bears more resemblance to an 
English city than any we have yet seen ; it is one of 
the pleasantest towns imaginable. It is built upon 
three hills, which give it a singular, picturesque 
appearance, and, I suppose, suggested the name of 
Tremont street, etc. The houses are many of them 
of fine granite, and have an air of wealth and solidity 



112 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

unlike anything we have seen elsewhere in this 
country. They are built more in our own fashion ; 
and there is a beautiful park called the Common, 
which, together with the houses round it, reminded 
me a good deal of the Green Park in London and 
the walk at the back of Arlington street. Many of 
the streets are planted with trees, chiefly fine horse- 
chestnuts, which were in full leaf and blossom, and 
harmonized beautifully with the gray color and solid, 
handsome style of the houses." Dwellings then ran 
up and down the slopes of Beacon Hill, descending 
into Winter, Summer, Beacon, and Park streets, and 
also along the slopes of Fort Hill, to the southeast, 
at the foot of which ran Pearl street, where Colonel 
Perkins, the merchant-prince of Boston, lived, and 
where Dr. Howe in time established his Blind Asylum. 
All these streets had gardens as well as spreading 
trees, and the Common gave to 

"The sunny street that held the sifted few," 

as Dr. Holmes says, a pleasant country look, and a hint 
of fields and pastures. There was no Public Garden 
then, and Beacon street ended in a granite block, 
before reaching the Mill Dam, over which was the 
favorite drive. The Athenaeum library and picture- 
gallery was on Pearl street, and there might be seen 
a few marbles by Horatio Greenough, a few canvases 
by Allston, and some fine portraits by Copley and 
Stuart. There were three young poets just coming 
forward Willis, a graduate of Yale, 1 Holmes from 



1 Willis had made Dr. Howe s acquaintance in Paris in the 
winter of 1830-31. In 1832 his home was in New York, but he was 
traveling abroad. He was four years younger than Howe. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 113 

Harvard, and Longfellow of Bowiloin but soon pro 
moted to his Harvard professorship, in which lie 
succeeded George Ticknor. Bryant was in New 
York editing the Evening Post. The elder Dana was 
idling in Cambridge, and Percival had shut himself 
up at New Haven. Emerson had left his North End 
pulpit, and was traveling in Europe, but Dr. Chan- 
ning preached in Federal street and old Dr. Beecher 
in Harvard street. " Boston had her Beethoven 
concerts, and much good preaching." Webster and 
Everett were leaders in society, and Sumner was 
coming up as a promising young lawyer, under the 
patronage of Judge Story, who lived in Cambridge. 
Motley was a student in Germany, and had not yet 
become a novelist, much less a historian ; his bent was 
toward literature, however, as was that of Howe for 
some years. Willis s American Monthly Magazine, 
which led a precarious existence in Boston from 1829 
to 1831, was flourishing as a part of the New York 
Mirror, and its place had been taken by the New 
England Magazine, of which Howe was for a time 
the editor, and Hawthorne, Holmes, and Longfellow 
the most illustrious contributors. That prose poet of 
Massachusetts " New England s Chaucer," as Ellery 
Channing styled him Hawthorne was living ob 
scurely in Salem and trying to sell his tales and 
sketches. The North American Review, in the hands 
of some Cambridge scholars, was the great authority 
in literary, historical, and political affairs ; but the 
transcendentalists and their Dial were beginning to 
dawn. 

Great had been the changes in Boston and New 
York since Dr. Howe first went to Greece. In 1820, 



114 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Dr. Charming, who was even then a profound spirit 
ual power in Boston, had gone to preach a Sunday in 
the City of New York but no church would open to 
hear him. Dr. J. \V. Francis, an illustrious physician 
there, tells the queer story. x The College of Physi 
cians and Surgeons opened a room to Dr. Channing 
and the Unitarians. " Some three days after that 
Sunday I accidentally met the great theological 
thunderbolt of the time, Dr. John M. Mason, who 
approached, and in earnestness exclaimed, * You doc 
tors have been engaged in a wrongful work ; you 
have permitted heresy to come in among us, and have 
countenanced its approach ; you have furnished 
accommodations for the devil s disciples. I replied, 
We saw no such great evil in an act of religious 
toleration. Do you know what you have done? 
cried the doctor, with enkindled warmth, You have 
advanced infidelity by complying with the request of 
these skeptics. * Sir, said I, * we hardly felt disposed 
to sift their articles of belief as a religious society. 
There, sir, there is the difficulty, exclaimed the doc 
tor. Belief? they have no belief; they believe in 
nothing, having nothing to believe. They are a 
paradox ; you cannot fathom them. How can you 
fathom a thing that has no bottom ? I left Dr. 
Mason dreadfully indignant." Such was orthodox 
New York in 1820. Yet before Dr. Channing s death 
in 1842, almost the same feeling had been manifested 
against Theodore Parker in Boston itself, where 
Unitarian ism had long been paramount.

len Bryant. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 115 

In 1833, Parker was in the Divinity School at 
Cambridge, and Dr. Channing was preaching in his 
Federal Street Church, at Boston, not far from 
Colonel Perkins s house in Pearl street. Parker, who 
did not know Dr. Howe at that time, but afterwards 
became one of his most intimate friends, has well 
described the spiritual characteristics of the years 
from 1834 to 1840, in Boston and its vicinity : " The 
years of my theological study, and of my early minis 
try, fell in the most interesting period of New Eng 
land s spiritual history, when a great revolution went 
on, so silent that few even knew it was taking place. 
The Unitarians, after a long and bitter controversy, 
had conquered and secured their right to deny the 
Trinity ; they had won the respect of the New Eng 
land public, had absorbed most of the religious talent 
of Massachusetts, and possessed and liberally admin 
istered the oldest and richest college in America. 
Mr. Garrison, with his friends inheriting what was 
best in the Puritan founders of New England, fired 
with the zeal of the Hebrew prophets and Christian 
martyrs, while they were animated with a spirit of 
humanity rarely found in any of the three was begin 
ning his noble work, but in a style so humble that, 
after long search, the police of Boston discovered 
there was nothing dangerous in it, for " his only 
visible auxiliary was a negro boy." Dr. Channing 
was in the full maturity of his powers ; and, after 
long preaching the dignity of human nature as an 
abstraction, and piety as a purely inward life with 
rare and winsome eloquence, and ever-progressive 
humanity, began to apply his sublime doctrines to 
actual life in the individual, the State, and the 



Il6 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Church. In the name of Christianity the great 
American Unitarian called for the reform of the 
drunkard, the elevation of the poor, the instruction 
of the ignorant, and, above all, for the liberation of 
the American slave. Horace Mann, with his coadju 
tors, began a great movement to improve the public 
education of the people. The brilliant genius of 
Emerson rose in the winter nights, and hung over 
Boston, drawing the eyes of ingenuous young people 
to look up to that great new star a beauty and a mys 
tery. The rights of labor were discussed with deep 
philanthropic feeling and sometimes with profound 
thought. Mr. George Ripley, a born democrat, in 
the high sense of that abused word, and one of the 
best cultured and most enlightened men in America, 
made an attempt at Brook Farm so to organize 
society that the results of labor should remain in the 
workman s hand. The natural rights of women 
began to be inquired into, and publicly discussed. I 
count it a piece of good fortune that I was a young 
man when these things were taking place ; when 
great questions were discussed, and the public had 
not yet taken sides." 1 

Upon some of these questions Dr. Howe was slow 
to take sides. He had been bred a " democrat " or 
" jacobin " in Boston ; but he was now a whig, and, in 
some respects, conservative. He did not favor tran 
scendentalism, nor emancipation, nor woman s rights, 
nor free inquiry in religion, very early in his active 
career. Writing to Horace Mann in 1857, he said : 

" I have been called a philanthropist, which implies 



1 Theodore Parker s " Experience as a Minister," Boston, 1859. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 117 

a man who, par excellence, is a lover of his kind, and 
one who labors from disinterested motives for its 
welfare. Now I am none of this. I do not think I 
have any more than average benevolence ; and I do 
think I have a great deal of selfishness, especially in 
the later years of my life. I think that I was impelled 
in early life to courses of conduct, such as going to 
Greece, rather by thoughtless indifference, perhaps 
ignorance of what courses would have been profitable 
to me. Lacking prudence and calculation, I followed 
an adventurous spirit. I have no more than ordinary 
courage ; though love of adventure has carried me 
into many dangers, I have been habitually and 
never ceasingly aware of the presence of danger, and 
circumspect. I always have in mind the safest place 
in the cars, for instance, and am wary about getting 
into danger, though able to appear decently cool 
when it comes. . . . My father, an uneducated man, 
only wished, without knowing how, to make me a 
scholar. He was wealthy during my childhood and 
boyhood ; and I lacked that inestimable advantage, 
which children in indigent families have, of habits of 
prudence and economy. My father had a large and 
luxurious house, with servants, horses, etc., at com 
mand." 

All this, though too modestly written, discloses the 
obstacles which Howe s nature would place in the 
way of a life devoted to philanthropy. He was 
brought up in ease ; he had a wilful way of doing 
what he desired ; he had aristocratic tastes, and 
valued the good opinion of society, which, at Boston 
in 1833, was by no means inclined to deeds of humble 
heroism, though proud of what " the Lafayette of 



Il8 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Boston " had done in Greece and Paris and Poland, 
yet, when he had once enlisted in his work for the 
blind, he knew how to turn these very social forces 
to account. Miss Peabody, the sister-in-law of 
Horace Mann and of Hawthorne, writing soon after 
Dr. Howe s death in 1876, spoke thus of his small 
beginning in the way of blind-instruction, and the 
response which the Boston of 1833 made to his 
appeals : 

" When we first became acquainted with Mr. Mann, he took 
Mary (afterwards Mrs. Mann) and me to a small wooden house 
in Hollis street, where, in the simplest surroundings, we found 
Dr. Howe, with the half-dozen first pupils he had picked up in 
the .highways and by-ways. He had then been about six months 
at work, and had invented and laboriously executed some books 
with raised letters, to teach them to read, some geographical 
maps, and the geometrical diagrams necessary for instruction 
in mathematics. He had gummed twine, I think, upon card 
board, an enormous labor, to form the letters of the alphabet. 
I shall not, in all time, forget the impression made upon me by 
seeing the hero of the Greek Revolution, who had narrowly 
missed being that of the Polish Revolution also ; to see this 
hero, I say, wholly absorbed, and applying all the energies of 
his genius to this apparently humble work, and doing it as 
Christ did, without money and without price. His own resour 
ces at this time could not have paid the expenses of his under 
taking, with all the economy and self-denial he practiced. The 
fuller purse of his friend and brother, Dr. Fisher, assisted him. 
Soon after our visit to him, he brought out his class for exhibi 
tion, in order to interest people and get money sufficient to 
carry on the work upon a larger scale. The many exhibitions 
given created a furor of enthusiasm, and Col. Perkins s great 
heart responded to the moving appeal. He now offered his fine 
estate on Pearl street, a large house and grounds, for the use 
and benefit of the blind, provided the citizens of Boston would 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 119 

raise $50,000 for the same purpose. To this appeal the ladies 
responded by planning and holding the first fancy fair ever 
known in Boston. It was held in Faneuil Hall, and everybody 
contributed, either in money or in articles for the sale; the net 
result was nearly $50,000." 

This narrative, like so much that the enthusiastic 
Miss Peabody wrote in her later years, is not quite 
exact. Dr. Howe s school was at his father s house 
in Pleasant street, not in Hollis street, though near 
by. The exact sum raised by the sale of articles at 
the Faneuil Hall fair was $11,000; the rest of the 
$50,000 came from individual subscriptions, collected 
by Deacon May and other well-known citizens of 
Boston. Jonathan Phillips, who held, by a sort of 
entail, the great Phillips estate (which, but for his 
radical opinions, might have descended to Wendell 
Phillips, his kinsman), gave $5,000. Others gave 
according to their substance, and in six weeks the- 
whole sum named by Colonel Perkins was raised, and 
his fine house, stables, and quarter-acre of land in 
Pearl street passed into the possession of Dr. Howe s 
trustees, one of whom was Dr. Fisher, and another 
Horace Mann. 

Dr. Howe s brief memorandum also differs a little 
from the exact fact. He said in 1857, twenty-five 
years afterward : 

In 1832 I put the Institution for the Blind into operation, 
and have administered it ever since. As soon as I had taught 
two or three children, which I did in my father s house * for 
the institution was then poor and had no quarters I went 
about the State and about New England with them, giving 



1 There were soon six. 



120 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

exhibitions and raising money. In this way mainly the funds 
were raised to secure the gift of Colonel Perkins. Afterwards, 
I went over the United States, also, addressing seventeen leg 
islatures in order to induce them to provide for the education 
of the blind. Great success attended this movement every 
where. All the legislatures, and all the people whom I 
addressed showed great interest, and took active measures. 
The Asylum for the Blind is mainly the result of my labors. 
Success in teaching some blind idiotic children gave me an 
interest in the subject of educating idiots. 

In fact, the whole better education of the blind and 
of the idiotic in the United States grew out of these 
enthusiastic labors of Howe ; although others had a 
share in the great work. But none other had the 
comprehensive glance, the incessant action, the 
instinct for the point to be reached, and the way to 
reach it successfully. It will surprise some readers, 
who always think of Howe as a foe of the slave 
holders, to learn that in November, 1841, he was 
crusading in South Carolina in behalf of the educa 
tion of the blind. Writing to their common friend, 
Dr. Francis Lieber, then a professor at the South 
Carolina College in Columbia, Charles Sumner says, 
November 30, 1841 : 

I am here with Dr. Howe (at South Boston) on a farewell 
visit. He starts to-morrow for South Carolina, to endeavor to 
induce your Legislature to do something for the blind. The 
Doctor moves rapidly and will be in Columbia almost as soon 
as this letter. 1 Cannot you do something to pave the way for 
his coming ? A notice of his institution, of his labors, of his 
philanthropic character, and his distinguished success in teach 
ing the blind, might be published in one of your papers, and do 



Pierce s " Memoir of Charles Sumner," Vol. II, p. 187. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 121 

much good. He will have with him two of his blind girls for 
exhibition before the Legislature. To you who know Howe, I 
need hardly add that this journey is undertaken with the hope 
of extending the means of education for that unfortunate class 
to whom he has devoted so much time. You know the chiv 
alry of his character, and his disinterested devotion to this 
object how his soul is absorbed in it. 

In an earlier letter from Sumner to Lieber in the 
same year, the character of his friend is even more 
tenderly dwelt on. The wonderful experiment of 
teaching Laura Bridgman, the deaf, dumb, and blind 
child from New Hampshire, was then in its early 
stages, and Howe had been reporting on her case to 
the patrons of his school. Sumner writes to Lieber 
(June 3, 1841): * 

Dr. Howe will be happy to have you make any use you see 
fit of his report on Laura Bridgman. I am very much attached 
to Howe. He is the soul of disinterestedness. He has purged 
his soul from all considerations of self, so far as mortal may do 
this ; and his sympathies embrace all creatures. To this high 
est feature of goodness add intelligence and experience of no 
common order all elevated and refined by a chivalrous sense 
of honor, and a mind withont fear. I think of the words of the 
Persian poet, when I meet Howe ; " O God ! have pity on the 
wicked ! the good need it not, for, in making them good,thou 
hast done enough." Both have been wanderers, and both are 
bachelors, so we are together a good deal ; we drive fast and 
hard, and talk looking at the blossoms in the fields, or those 
fairer in the streets. 

In fact Howe s bachelor home at Washington 
Heights, and Longfellow s abode at the old head 
quarters of Washington in Cambridge, became Sum-

122 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

ner s most frequent resorts, in those days, soon after 
his return from England in 1840, when every gentle 
man s house in Boston was open to Sumner, as the 
houses of whig and tory had been in England. 
There came a bitter change in this respect (in Boston) 
as Sumner ranged himself more and more distinctly 
on the side of freedom, and against both Webster 
and Winthrop in Boston. But in 1840, when Willis, 
the poet, who had his own reasons for disliking Bos 
ton, poured out to Longfellow his disgust, he excepted 
Sumner from the censure. He wrote x (September 15, 
1840): 

I confess that I see everything, even my friends, through 
my bilious spectacles in Boston. I do not enjoy anything or 
anybody within its abominable periphery of hills and salt- 
marshes. Even you seem not what you would be at Glenmary 
(Willis s cottage at Owego, N.Y.); and I prefer Sumner sea 
sick in a head wind in the English Channel, to Sumner with his 
rosiest gills, and reddest waistcoat in Boston. By the way, how 
is our agreeable friend ? And have the nankeen-trousered Bos- 
tonians yet begun to qualify their admiration of him ? There is 
no excuse for disliking Sumner. He bears his honors so meekly 
and is so thoroughly a good fellow, that if they do not send him 
to Congress and love him forever, I will deny my cradle. 

Willis was, and is regarded rather as a dandy than 
a prophet ; but he seems to have predicted very 
sagely in this case. He had a like admiration, and 
more attachment for Howe ; but neither Howe nor 
Sumner in those days were disturbed by dreams of 
political ambition. Philanthropy, scholarship, and 
literature were more attractive to them ; and they

Ticknor & Co., 1887), pp. 11-12.

looked on all literature and all scholarship through a 
golden mist of philanthropy. It was the philanthropy 
of " Evangeline " that Howe admired most in that 
beautiful poem ; and though his letter to Longfel 
low concerning it is a little out of time here (written 
in 1847) it should be quoted in this connection x 

MY DEAR LONGFELLOW: 

I thank you most heartily for the kind remembrance which 
you manifested by sending me your little book. Had it been a 
trifle, a straw, a word only, which assured me of that remem 
brance, it would have been most grateful to me. How much 
more, then, such a book ! It is not for myself alone that I have 
to thank you ; but as one of many thousands who will read 
" Evangeline." A book ! A book that pleases, instructs, improves 
people, what a gift to the world ! You feed five times five 
thousand souls with spiritual food, which makes them forever 
stronger and better. 

I have no scholarship ; I cannot appreciate the literary 
merits of "Evangeline." I cannot even say that I like the hybrid 
character of the measure ; it would perhaps have pleased me 
better in ordinary verse, or in plain prose. But I can under 
stand and admire the instructive story, the sublime moral, the 
true poetry which it contains. Patience, forbearance, long-suf 
fering, faith these are the things which " Evangeline " teaches. 
And how much are these above the physical courage, the 
resistance, the passion, the strife the things of earth which 
poets deck out in the hues of heaven, and make men believe to 
be truly glorious ! But I meant only to send you my poor 
thanks for your kind remembrance, and will not be so ungrate 
ful as to impose upon you my stupid comments. So I will 
only add that, though I see little of you, I will try to have 
some of " Evangeline s " constancy, in my hope of one day 
enjoying more of your society.

The tone of self-disparagement here taken by 
Howe was not unusual with him ; for his nature 
inclined him to melancholy ; but none of those who 
were honored with his acquaintance would admit for 
a moment that he was in any sense inferior to his 
eminent friends. On the contrary, his place was 
indicated by his presence, like the Highland chief 
tain s : "Wherever The Macdonald sat was the head of 
the table ;" though none was less forward to assert a 
claim. What he lacked in literary culture even, was 
apt to be made good by the directness with which he 
flew to his aim and that aim always a high one. 
This has been seen already in his sketches of the 
Greek Revolution, and his letters from Europe ; but 
it will appear still more striking in what he had to 
say concerning Laura Bridgman. 



CHAPTER II. 

THE BLIND ASYLUM AND ITS PRINTING HOUSE. 

FROM the moment Dr. Howe touched the long- 
existing theories and methods of teaching the blind, 
they began to assume new forms and produce new 
results. The Abbe Haiiy in Paris, sixty years before, 
had invented an alphabet for the blind, and many 
schools in Europe were using it, and modifying it, but 
when the young American philanthropist saw these 
schools in 1831-32, he felt, instinctively that he could 
do better. His was a practical genius, like that of 
Franklin a century before ; into both of them had 
been infused that strange American elixir of inven 
tion which has given to this continent in the last 
hundred years the glory of alleviating so much pain, 
abbreviating so much time and space, extending so 
wonderfully the labors of the industrious, and giving 
to the toiler and his household something like their 
fair share of what that labor produces. With an eye 
for money-making, Dr. Howe might have become a 
famous and rich inventor ; but he "affected the weal 
of men," as Bacon says, and let his own glory and 
aggrandizement take care of themselves. 

From citations and comments we make up this 
story of the Blind Asylum: 



126 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

THE SCHOOL FCR THE BLIND, JANUARY, 1833. 

(Correspondent of the Newburyport Herald.} 

By invitation of a friend, I spent some time this afternoon in 
the school for the blind, recently established in this city, under 
the auspices of the society which is styled in their act of incor 
poration the New England Asylum for the Blind. Regarding 
the composition of this school, the name of the society is not 
perhaps so appropriate ; but this is of small consideration com 
pared with the benefits of the thing itself. For my own part I 
must confess I was astonished at the progress made by the 
pupils of this school. Taught as they are through the medium 
of touch, they have attained surprising perfection. A little girl, 
only six years old, read with very considerable facility certain 
portions of Scripture : and another, only eight, passages 
selected from various authors, differing widely in their style. 
They and other pupils answered also numerous questions from 
the maps, estimating distances with great accuracy. The 
books used were imprinted with raised characters palpable to 
the touch ; and the several natural features and divisions of 
particular countries on the maps were also distinguished in the 
same manner. During our stay, we were favored with a rich 
musical treat, to which all the pupils contributed. One of 
them, a female, played upon the pianoforte and another, a 
young man, upon the violoncello ; these were accompanied by 
the voices of the whole school. The institution has been in 
operation only five months. 

The school is held at present in the house of Dr. Howe, well 
known for his adventures in Greece, and his late imprisonment 
in Prussia. When arrested, he was employed as an agent by 
the New England Asylum. He brought with him, from France, 
a young man, 1 who has been deprived of sight from infancy ; 



1 M. Trenched, a graduate of the School of Paris, founded by 
the Abbe Haiiy, but soon accepted as a national school and asylum 
for the blind. See what Dr. Howe says of this institution, here 
after. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 127 

and who is now engaged as a tutor in the school. He is only 
twenty-one ; but, as Dr. Howe informed me, has a most 
thorough knowledge of the exact sciences. Although so 
recently from France, and having before he came no knowledge 
of our language, he is now familiar with its "ordinary expres 
sions, and found no difficulty in communicating with his visit 
ors. " If the blind lead the blind, shall they not both fall into 
the ditch ? " is certainly not applicable to the progress which 
his pupils have made since they have been under his care. The 
whole exhibition was singularly interesting. I saw enough to 
satisfy me that much can be done to relieve the situation of the 
blind, to fit them for usefulness, and add to their enjoyments. 
The efforts of the members of this society deserve the acknowl 
edgments of their fellow-citizens; and especially are the phil 
anthropy and benevolence of Dr. Howe worthy of renewed 
admiration. 

DR. HOWE S MODEL AND WARNING. 

It will be evident from the above description 
(which is the earliest I can find, and somewhat prior 
to the account already cited by Miss Peabody) that 
the young director took the Paris school for his 
model, in outward exercises, but that it had taught 
him what to avoid in other respects. This will appear 
further, from his own report on the Paris school, 
made to the Trustees of the New England Asylum 
in the Autumn of 1832, soon after his return from 
France. He then said : 

Those institutions which are founded and supported by the 
Government labor under many disadvantages necessarily 
attendant upen such a connection ; and it may be said, without 
injustice to the persons employed, that they are obliged to fol 
low such a system, and make such exhibitions, as will redound 
rather to the glory of the State than the good of the pupils. 



123 PR. S. G. HOWE. 

Hence so much of useless parade and show ; hence so much 
time and patience spent upon learning to perform surprising 
but useless things. Those on the other hand, which are kept 
up by individual effort and public benevolence, fall into the 
error of considering their pupils too much as objects of charity, 
and of petting and caressing them too much. The Institution 
for the Education of the Blind at Paris, as it is the oldest in 
Europe, and as there is about it more of show and parade than 
in any other, has also the reputation of being the best ; but if 
one judges the tree by its fruit, and not by its flowers and 
foliage, this will not be his conclusion. 

Its founder, and the great benefactor of the blind, the Abbe 
Haiiy, 1 invented and put into practice many contrivances for 
the education of the blind ; and otherwise rendered the institu 
tion excellent for the age, and the time it has existed ; but as 
he left it so it has since remained. It receives, supports, and 
educates about a hundred blind youths ; and, there being no 
other in France, it follows that there are only one in three hun 
dred of the French blind who receive an education. The great 
fault in the Parisian institution is, the diversity of employment 
to which the pupils are put ; and the effort made to enable 
them to perform surprising but useless tricks. The same 
degree of intellectual education is given to all, without refer 
ence to their destination in life ; and a poor boy, who is to get 
his livelihood by weaving or whip-making, is as well instructed 
in mathematics and polite literature, as he who is to pursue a 
literary career. Now there is no reason why a shoemaker, or a 
basket-maker should not be well educated, provided he can 
learn his profession thoroughly, and find the necessary leisure 
to study. But if this would be difficult for a seeing person, how 
much more it is so for a blind one, who to attain any degree 
of excellence in a trade, must apply himself most intensely and 
most patiently! The necessity of this is made apparent by the 
situation of those youths who have come out from this institu- 



1 This was Valentine Haiiy ; his brother was the discoverer in 
crystallization. Both died in 1822. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. I2Q 

tion at the end of the seven years passed there. They have 
devoted five hours a day to mechanical employments, but to so 
many different ones, that they know but little of any. Weaving, 
whip-making , mat and net making, spinning, etc., etc., have so 
effectually divided their attention, that, at the end of the year 
devoted to learning the one, they have almost entirely forgotten 
that which they acquired the year before. 

It is plain that here was an original thinker let 
loose among the instructors of the blind, of whom 
then, in the whole world, there were but few. Noth 
ing whatever had been done for their instruction 
(although the deaf had long been taught in Spain, in 
Germany, and even in France) until about 1790. 
Then the humane Abbe Haiiy undertook to educate 
some blind children in his own house, and his success 
was so great that the Government of France 
employed him to establish an institution in Paris. 
This he did, and made it so interesting an object 
that he was called by the Emperor of Russia to St. 
Petersburg for a similar purpose ; and, after success 
fully putting his system into operation there, he laid 
the foundation of a school for the blind at Berlin. 
He had before invented the method of printing in 
raised characters, he also constructed maps, musical 
notes, etc., but left the subject in a very imperfect 
state at his death in 1-822 ; and his successor had 
accomplished little. Similar institutions were founded, 
and Dr. Howe saw them in successful operation at 
Amsterdam, Vienna, Dresden, London, Edinburgh, 
Glasgow, Liverpool, and other places. The summary 
of his verdict concerning them was thus given by 
Dr. Howe in 1832 : 

" The European institutions for the education of 



130 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the blind may be divided into two classes ; those 
established and supported by the governments, and 
those which owe their foundation and support to the 
charitable efforts of individuals ; the latter are by far 
more useful than the former. There can be no more 
delightful spectacle than is presented by these estab 
lishments, where you can see a hundred young blind 
persons, changed from listless, inactive, helpless 
beings, into intelligent, active, and happy ones ; they 
run about, and pursue their different kinds of work 
with eager industry and surprising success ; when 
engaged in intellectual pursuits, the awakened mind 
is painted in their intelligent countenances ; and 
when the whole unite in sacred music, there is a dis 
play of deep interest, of fervid zeal, and animating 
enthusiasm, which I have never seen equaled. The 
proposed end of these different institutions is to give 
the blind the means of supporting themselves ; 
and this is effected with different degrees of success. 
I visited all the principal institutions for the educa 
tion of the blind in Europe, and found in all much to 
admire and to copy, but much also to avoid." 

The new Boston school did, in fact, begin at once 
to improve on its European models, so that Horace 
Mann could truthfully say, ten years later (1843) 
when he visited most of the schools for the blind in 
Europe, that he found none so good as Dr. Howe s, 
and only one, at Amsterdam, worthy to be compared 
with it. The Boston trustees in 1834 spoke of these 
improvements thus : " As one instance, they would 
refer to the map at the end of this pamphlet, which 
is on a plan entirely new, and unknown in Europe. 
There the maps are made with infinite pains and 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 13! 

expense by glueing strings on to another map pasted 
on a board ; besides the great expense and necessary 
clumsiness of which, these do not admit of the divi 
sions and lettering, which are here introduced. A 
map of this size would cost at Paris and Edinburgh 
five dollars ; it would weigh three or four pounds, 
and not have half so many distinctions as this, which 
costs less than one-hundredth part of that sum." 
This new style of map was Dr. Howe s own invention, 
and he presently devised a new character for cheapen 
ing the printing, which the blind so much needed. 
Concerning this invention Dr. Howe thus spoke, six 
years later, when it had come into common use, but 
was criticised here and there, as every useful inven 
tion is, by the envious, the self-interested, the 
inattentive, or those who simply and honestly are 
averse to any change. He said in his report for 1839 : 

It will be recollected by those gentlemen who were Trustees 
in 1833, the first year of the operation of our institution, that 
though our pupils succeeded in learning to read, the success 
seemed little worth, because there were but three books in 
the school. These were, a book of extracts from English 
authors, published in Paris ; the Gospel of St. John, printed at 
Edinburgh, and one small volume from the same place. These 
were all the reading books for the blind then in existence in 
the English language ; there was also a collection of math 
ematical diagrams, executed at York, in England, and these 
made up the whole library of the blind. It was obvious that 
more books should be printed, but the first object seemed to 
be, to find a method which would diminish their bulk and 
expense ; for, if the French, the Scotch, or the German meth 
ods had been followed, a volume, like the New Testament, 
would have formed twelve ponderous folios. 

After hesitating a long time, whether to use a new phonetic 



132 DR. S. G. HO\VE. 

alphabet or a series of stenographic characters, or the 
mon alphabet, I adopted the latter; not, however, without 
adhering to the opinion that one of the others must event 
ually be us ecl in printing for the blind. Having decided to 
use the common alphabet, slightly varied, I endeavored to 
reduce the bulk of each letter to the minimum size which the 
blind could feel. With this view all the unnecessary points, 
all the mere ornamental flourishes, were cut off ; the inter 
linear space was reduced by making the bottom of the line 
straight ; that is, carrying up such letters as g, p, etc., which 
run below the bottom of the line. The bulk was further 
reduced by using a thin paper expressly prepared, and by 
reducing the height of the face of the type. In this way it 
was found the books might be very much reduced in size, so 
that the New Testament could be printed in two volumes 
not more bulky than the French of which twelve at least 
would have been necessary to contain the whole Testament. 

Having ascertained, beyond the possibility of doubt, that any 
blind child of common capacity could easily read this print, I 
commenced printing ; and as the funds of the institution were 
small, I resolved not to ask any aid from the treasury, but 
appeal to the benevolent here and abroad. This appeal was 
not in vain ; generous aid flowed in, and the press was put into 
active operation. All the money raised was put at once into 
the treasury, and only drawn out upon exhibition of proper 
vouchers for expenses. The cost of apparatus, paper, etc., has 
been, up to this date, about $8,000. One of the first objects 
was, to print the New Testament, which had never been done 
in any language. This was soon effected ; then followed the 
book of Psalms, and successively twenty-one editions of books. 

Dr. Howe at that time attached great importance 
to the work of placing the Bible in the hands of the 
blind. He had already urged this on his trustees and 
the public in these words : 

The advantage, nay the necessity, of printing the Gospel in 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 133 

raised letters for the use of the blind will be apparent to every 
thinking Christian. Here is a large number of our fellow 
creatures within our reach, who might be supplied with the 
New Testament at small expense, compared with that laid out 
in sending it among distant heathens. It may be said indeed, 
that the blind can hear the Bible read by their friends, while 
the heathen cannot ; but, on the other hand, let one consider 
what a precious treasure a copy of the Testament in raised 
letters would be to a blind man ; he would pore over it, read 
and re-read it, until every word became familiar ; and how 
much greater probability there would be of its producing a 
good effect than in the hands of those who have a thousand 
other things to occupy their thoughts. Then too, let one con 
sider the all-important nature of the study ; and how jealous 
one should be of trusting to aught but the cool decision of his 
own reason. In fine, let any pious Christian put the case to 
himself and say, whether he could be content with having the 
Scriptures read by another ; whether he could abstain from 
feasting his eyes on God s sacred pages ; or refrain from shut 
ting himself up in his closet with his Maker, and His revealed 
Word. What his eyes are to him, the fingers are to the man 
deprived of sight, and to the one equally as to the other, is sol 
itary reading and reflection a useful and healthful exercise. 

Nor to the blind alone would the Scriptures printed in raised 
letters be a precious treasure ; there are many people who 
from weakness or temporary derangement of the organs ot 
sight, would be happy to spare their eyes and read with their 
fingers. The acquisition of this faculty is not at all difficult, 
any person may in three or four days enable himself to feel out 
very easily the raised letters, and read pretty fast. I mentioned 
in a letter from Europe to your sub-committee a plan which I 
had conceived of publishing one of the Evangelists in raised 
characters ; without now detailing all the methods which I 
would substitute for those hitherto used, I may say, that it is 
founded upon the only principle which can possibly obviate the 
immense inconvenience of bulk and expense, viz., that of con 
traction or stenography ; a principle which, if acted up to may 



134 DR - S. G. HOWE. 

I am convinced, render books for the blind as cheap and as 
compact as those printed for our use. Whether this system 
shall substitute tangible for the visible forms of letters, or 
whether the symbols shall represent sounds, is a secondary 
question. 

This last remark hints at a plan which was never 
carried out, and which Dr. Howe afterwards gave up. 
In his report for 1839, he goes on to defend his work 
from some criticism : 

" I desire only the multiplication of books for the blind ; and 
let the character be what it may, I have no fears about my 
pupils being able to read it, provided the impression is firm and 
clear. I hail with pleasure the announcement of every new 
work in raised letters, and care not who gets the credit, so that 
the blind get the books. It is with much reluctance, that I 
have spoken of my share in this enterprise, and especially that 
I have instituted any comparison between my method and that 
of others; but called upon as I have been to conform with 
others, I felt bound to show my reasons for not doing so. I am 
not aware of being influenced by any partiality for my own sys 
tem ; certainly I have not said so much in its favor as our 
pupils would ; for I am certain that they, and scores of other 
blind persons, who compare our books with those in the new 
Scotch type, give them a decided preference. This is certain, 
that when audiences in England and Scotland were uttering by 
shouts their astonishment and pleasure, that blind children 
could read books in raised letters, it had ceased altogether 
to be a matter of surprise in this country, so common had 
it become. Nay, long before the exhibitions were got 
up in Glasgow, and elsewhere, many blind persons in this 
country had learned to read our books alone, and far distant 
from any school. 

The philosophy of this subject has been overlooked by many, 
who have lately taken so much interest in it. They first con 
trive an alphabet, then find a blind child, and if he succeeds in 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 135 

learning it they cry out eureka ! and consider it evidence 
enough of the superiority of the system. But, in reality, a 
blind child will learn to read upon a very bad system, as seeing 
children learn geography, grammar, etc., in spite of very bad 
methods of instruction. 

With these remarks in defence of a system to which I shall 
continue to adhere, until a better one shall be found, I leave the 
subject. My endeavor shall be, as it has been, to give the 
blind the greatest possible quantity of reading matter in the 
smallest possible space, and at the least possible expense ; as 
yet, no system does this so effectually as ours can ; but when 
one is brought forward, I will adopt it. If, by the aid and 
encouragement of the humane, our printing-press is allowed to 
continue in operation, I doubt not w r e shall soon be able to 
present works of the size of the New Testament, in one com 
pact and convenient volume. 

It was in the years 1835-36 that these great advan 
ces in the printing of books for the blind were made 
by Dr. Howe, and they continued for a long- time. 
He was aided in them by an ingenious New England 
mechanic, Stephen P. Ruggles, a man of Yankee 
inventiveness, but without the generosity of nature 
which was so conspicuous in Dr. Howe. This defect 
led him afterwards to quarrel with Dr. Howe, as he 
did, first and last, with almost all his friends, but he 
deserves to be mentioned as very useful in his own 
way. The trustees in 1836 spoke thus : 

We cannot quit the subject, without a just tribute to the 
indefatigable exertions of the Director, Dr. S. G. Howe, who 
continues to devote himself to the pupils, and the general inter 
ests of the Institution, with the same fidelity and zeal which 
he has exhibited since its foundation. In the course of the 
year, in addition to his regular labors, he has made important 
improvements in the system of printing for the blind. By his 



136 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

own exertions he has raised funds for erecting a complete 
press, constructed on a novel and very ingenious plan, by Mr. 
S. P. Ruggles. Several books compiled by Dr. Howe himself, 
and accommodated to the wants of the blind, have been already 
printed. 

When it is considered that the improved formation and 
arrangement of the characters by Dr. Howe, enable us to give 
the same quantity of matter in volumes of half the bulk 
formerly required, and at one-fourth the expense, we have 
reason to believe that these improvements will be of general 
application and use in sister institutions, both in our own coun 
try and Europe. 

Mrs. Howe, writing in 1876, after the death of her 
husband, had this to say about his Bible-printing and 
other undertakings to give the blind a library of 
their own. 

Dr. Howe considered the multiplication of works specially 
printed for the blind an object of great importance, as increas- 
ng their resources and their opportunities for independent 
study and culture. He spared no effort to this end, keeping it 
always before the eyes of the community in his reports, while 
he at the same time neglected no opportunity of bringing so 
pressing a want to the notice of wealthy and benevolent indi 
viduals. The annals of his institution will show that his efforts, 
though not entirely attaining the desired result, were yet in a 
great measure successful. In 1835 he was able to present the 
American Bible Society with a specimen of Bible-printing, in 
which the bulk heretofore required was diminished one-half. In 
the same year he wrote an eloquent letter to the Directors of the 
American Bible Society, asking for such an appropriation from 
their funds as would enable him to print the whole Bible in 
raised type. Two hundred dollars had already been obtained, 
in answer to an appeal made by Dr. Howe before the congre 
gation of Park Street church. The Massachusetts Bible Society 
added another contribution of one thousand dollars, The New 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 137 

York Female Bible Society gave eight hundred dollars, and the 
American Bible Society one thousand. This sum of money 
enabled Dr. Howe to print the New Testament in raised letters 
a service which was hailed with joy by the many blind per 
sons desirous of possessing and reading the book. Six years 
later the Managers of the American Bible Society took the 
necessary steps for completing the printing of the entire Bible 
in the same type, the plates for the whole work costing some 
$13,000. 

In respect to other works the catalogue of books printed at 
the Massachusetts Asylum attests the labor bestowed upon 
this object by its principal. It includes Milton s " Paradise 
Lost " and " Regained," an encyclopedia of his own compiling, 
Shakespeare s " Hamlet " and " Julius Caesar," histories of 
England and the United States, " Pilgrim s Progress," and 
selections from the writings of Pope, Baxter, Swedenborg, and 
Byron. In the last report written by his hand, he mentions 
the noble donation of Mr. Dickens of a sum of money which 
enabled the institution to print a small edition of the " Old 
Curiosity Shop " for the use of the blind. Laura Bridgman 
once spoke to me with vivacity of the pleasure with which she 
had perused this work. 

Dr. Howe s son-in-law and successor has nobly car 
ried forward, and at much competition, this task of 
supplying the adult blind with books, and the col 
lection is now much larger than in 1876. But this 
whole industry grew out of the zeal and devotion of 
Dr. Howe, while still a young man, in the early years 
of his work at the Blind Asylum. 

The speed with which this infant enterprise ad 
vanced from its humble beginning in the house of 
Dr. Howe s father on Pleasant street, to the rank of 
a New England or, indeed, an American institution, 
cannot better be shown than by quoting from the 
report of the trustees in 1834 a little more than 



138 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

two years after Dr. Howe was cast into the dungeon 
of the Prussian king in Berlin. Colonel Perkins had 
given his Pearl street mansion, the fund of $50,000 
had been raised, and the financial future of the school 
seemed assured. The same extract will give the 
weekly routine at this new establishment. 

When, a twelvemonth ago, we undertook the management 
of its affairs, it was unknown to the public ; a doubtful experi 
ment on the feasibility of educating six poor blind children 
was in operation ; the appropriation by the State was insuffi 
cient for their support ; the subscriptions were nearly exhausted, 
and, within one month from our appointment, we found the 
institution to be absolutely in debt. Now the scene is entirely 
changed ; the institution has attracted public notice, and gained 
public favor; it is in the enjoyment of liberal patronage from 
this and the surrounding States ; it possesses a considerable fund 
of property : its five and thirty happy inmates inhabit a splen 
did and airy mansion, with extensive grounds, and everything 
necessary fer their health, comfort, and education ; and prep 
arations are made for the reception of as many more. 

In order to accommodate a large number of pupils, it was 
necessary to make some alterations in the premises in Pearl 
street; and, the stables being of brick and built in the best 
manner, it was concluded to convert them into school-rooms 
and work-shops. It was also necessary to provide a large 
play-ground ; and the estate in the rear of the mansion house, 
and fronting on Atkinson street, was purchased for the sum of 
fourteen thousand dollars ; and thus the institution became 
owners of the whole square from Pearl to Atkinson street. All 
the arrangements having been made, and the estate on Atkin 
son street having been laid out as a play -ground, the inmates 
took possession in September, 1833, and the institution was 
advertised as ready for the reception of pupils from all parts 
of the country. Since that time, the number has gradually 
increased, and many more are expected ; the whole number 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 139 

admitted has been thirty-eight ; the actual number is thirty- 
four ; one having left voluntarily, two having been discharged 
on account of illness, and one, from a neighboring State, dis 
charged for want of funds for his support. 

There are now twenty-four from Massachusetts, four from 
New Hampshire, two from Connecticut, one from Rhode Island, 
one from New York, one from Ohio, and one from Virginia. 
Three of the pupils from this State are beyond the age stipu- 
Isted in the act of incorporation, at which the Governor may 
send pupils by his warrant ; one of these pays her own ex 
penses, the other two are at the charge of the institution, as is 
also one from the State of Ohio. It will be seen that more 
pupils have been received from the State of Massachusetts 
than was strictly required hy the terms of the grant ; we have, 
however, considered it our duty rather to extend the advan 
tages of the institution to as many pupils as possible, than to 
accumulate funds. 

On the Sabbath all the pupils are required to attend church ; 
the rule of the institution is, that each pupil may worship at 
whatever church he, or his parents, may select ; but in case 
any other is selected than the one at which the majority at 
tend (at present the Park Street Church) the pupil must furnish 
his own guide. It is desirable that the most perfect freedom 
in regard to religious matters should be enjoyed by the pupils ; 
but it would be very inconvenient for the institution to provide 
guides for each one ; therefore this rule has been adopted. 
With respect to the religious services in the interior of the 
establishment, they consist of the reading daily of the Scriptures 
without any comment, and the Episcopal form of prayer, be 
sides a weekly meeting for reading and explanation of the 
Scriptures, at which the attendance is voluntary. 

In this liberal way was this school opened not 
only a school, but a printing-house, a training place 
for teachers, and a center for missionary effort in the 
instruction of the blind throughout the country and 



140 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

all over the world. It was not long before Dr. Howe 
had repaid whatever debt he owed to the example of 
the older schools in, Europe ; nor did he ever cease to 
advance the cause committed to him from any timid 
fear that the money he might need would be with 
held. Like Agassiz, in after years, he found that men 
were always willing to give for his enterprises. In 
1837 the trustees said : 

We have never allowed ourselves to suppose for a moment 
that the generous inhabitants of New England would suffer 
their blind to remain in intellectual darkness, after it had been 
satisfactorily demonstrated that they could be enlightened and 
made happy. We have endeavored to build up an institution 
equal, if not superior, in the advantages it offers its pupils, to the 
oldest and most renowned of the great European capitals ; we 
believe we have succeeded ; and we believe, too, that there is 
as good a guarantee for its continuance and prosperity in the 
free and hearty support of a New England community, as those 
of Paris and Vienna have, in the munificence of royalty. We 
have ever endeavored, however, to be strictly economical ; we 
have lavished nothing on show and parade ; but, we have 
thought that the best system was the most truly economical, 
and when a question has occurred as to the adoption of one of 
two methods of procedure, we have asked, not which is the 
cheapest, but which is the best, and most for the true interest 
of our pupils. Nor have we confined our efforts to the blind of 
our own section of the country ; we have endeavored to extend 
the knowledge and benefits of the system of educating them as 
widely as possible. With the excellent institutions growing up 
in New York and Philadelphia, we have been on the best terms ; 
and so common has been the cause, that, at the present time, a 
blind person, a pupil educated here, is acting as teacher in one 
of them, to supply a temporary vacancy. 

With the same view to general usefulness, we were happy to 
have our Director accept the invitation of a committee of the 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 14! 

Legislature of Ohio, and visit that State with three of our 
pupils. The results of that visit, and an exhibition of the 
acquirements of the children to the Legislature, and the most 
influential persons in the State, were very satisfactory. It was 
ascertained that there were 500 blind persons in that State, and 
about 60 of them at a proper age for instruction ; and such was 
the interest excited, and so thorough the conviction of the pos 
sibility of educating the blind, that we have every reason to 
suppose that an institution similar to our own will be organ 
ized there in a very short time. 

Such, indeed, was the outcome of Dr. Howe s visit 
to Ohio ; and, wherever he went, he found ready 
hearers, and those easily persuaded to do what he 
advised. One secret of this success was his genius, 
which took the practical form of persuading men to 
be philanthropic, as he was ; another was his entire 
devotion to the cause he advocated, without thought 
of pushing his own selfish interests. He was never 
very gifted as an orator ; had never trained himself 
to the art of public-speaking, as Phillips did and 
Dana and Hillard and others of his younger contem 
poraries ; but he had the natural language which 
flows from the heart and reaches the heart. Occa 
sionally in these years he lectured ; and from a lec 
ture of his, given in Boston in 1836 I take these pas 
sages : 

People generally imagine it must be very difficult to teach 
the blind ; but they are wrong. To teach the blind, is the 
easiest thing in the world. And I will venture to say, that a 
class of blind children, from the Blind Instituion in this city, 
will learn as much, in a given time, of history, geography, 
astronomy, or the languages, as any class that could be selected 
from the high schools and academies ; and that, of mathema- 



142 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

tics and music, they will learn more. To teach the blind is easy, 
to educate them is altogether another matter. 

A comparison is sometimes drawn between the situation and 
instruction of deaf-mutes and the blind ; but there is no other 
resemblance, than that the modus operandi is different from the 
one pursued with seeing children. The advantages are alto 
gether on the side of the blind ; for the deaf-mutes, a language 
is to be invented ; and when it is invented, perfected, and 
learned, how inadequate is it to the full and free communica 
tion of ideas ! But with the blind, there is no such obstacle 
the medium is a common one, and we have the most free and 
illimitable interchange of thought and feeling. The moral and 
religious feelings of the deaf-mutes are generally dormant when 
they enter institutions for their education; while the blind differ 
not from seeing people, and partake of the stamp of those with 
whom they have associated. 

If you wish to teach a deaf-mute geography, for instance, you 
must first teach him language. With a blind boy, you have 
only to begin to describe the country ; you give him his lesson 
orally, instead of his reading and studying in a book. You 
teach a blind boy in the same way you would teach a seeing 
boy except that you read or lecture to the blind boy, while 
you let the seeing boy read for himself. The only difference is 
in the artificial aids, books, maps, diagrams, slates, etc and 
these are small matters. You have only to imagine that all 
your books, maps, slates, etc., were taken from your school, the 
room darkened, and you required to keep on teaching your 
scholars ; you will then conceive, at once, how the blind are 
taught. If you wish to inform them the difference between an 
acute and an obtuse angle, and fail to do so by words, you 
would mark it upon the palms of their hands, or you would 
have the figure stamped on a piece of paper, and give it to 
them to feel. Now, what you would do with your scholars in 
the dark, we have to do with the blind in the light. Such is the 
general principle; as to the quo mode, it is of less conse 
quence. 

And yet, while institutions for the education of the deaf and 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 143 

dumb have long been established, and are rapidly increasing, 
those for the blind are but just commencing. Thank God, how 
ever, the work has commenced ; and in a community like ours 
it cannot but go on. Already have two of our institutions 
placed themselves on a footing with nay, I may safely say, in 
some respects, have excelled the best and oldest in Europe ; 
and there is nothing more ardently to be desired, than to see 
them multiplied and perfected. It is but four years since the 
American public have learned that the blind could be educated; 
it is but four years since a call has been made upon their sym 
pathies and charities in behalf of this interesting class, and yet 
the call has been answered promptly and generously. The 
work has been begun with zeal and resolution ; more progress 
has been made here than in the last twenty years elsewhere ; 
and there is now, for the first time, a rational prospect of a 
select and valuable library being soon printed for the blind. 
Already has the best of books, the New Testament, been fin 
ished, of which only short extracts had been printed abroad ; 
and hope says, it is but the earnest of many more. That our 
country may be the first to discharge its duty to those who are 
rendered its dependents is to be ardently desired by every 
patriot and philanthropist. 

This appeal to Americans, from pride in their 
country was naturally made; for no American ever felt 
more deeply the love of country than this Greek 
chevalier who had spent the first eight years of his 
active life in Europe. Instead of contracting that 
disgust at his own people, which is one of the results 
of American life abroad in too many instances, Dr. 
Howe only learned to value more highly its great 
privileges of freedom and equality. And few Ameri 
cans have ever done more to reflect credit on their 
country than he. The words of the veteran, Lafay 
ette, in 1830, when Howe was by his side, taking part 
in the Revolution of July " Reserve yourself for the 



144 D B. s - G - HOWE. 

service of America, young friend ! this is our fight 
not yours" were amply fulfilled in after years. 
When Dr. Howe went abroad for the first time after 
his Berlin imprisonment, he found that he was known 
wherever his name was mentioned not only in Prus 
sia, which refused him access to her frontiers, and in 
Greece where he found grateful citizens, but in Eng 
land, in France, in Germany, and in Italy. But 
what had contributed more than all things else to his 
fame was his teaching Laura Bridgman. 



CHAPTER III. 

THE WONDROUS STORY OF LAURA BRIDGMAN. 

DR. HOWE had been building up the Blind Asylum 
for five years, and had fallen in with many cases of 
deprivation and defective natural endowment, which 
appealed strongly to his philanthropic nature, when 
he by good fortune met with an instance which 
attracted his attention more than any other, and 
which soon began to draw the notice of the world. 
This was the New Hampshire child, Laura Bridgman, 
suffering under the accumulated loss of sight, hear 
ing, speech, and smell, whom he was destined to 
restore by education to daily communion with her 
fellow-creatures and thus to point the way for many 
improvements in the instruction of the deaf as well 
as the blind. These improvements have since been 
made, and now it is no longer marvelous, though 
still difficult, to teach the dumb to speak, and give 
those who are both blind and deaf a fair chance, by 
education, in the world which they cannot see. The 
pioneer in all these changes, so far as America is con 
cerned, was Dr. Howe ; and it was from him that 
Horace Mann, Gardiner Hubbard, Miss Rogers, and 
the other promoters of articulation among the deaf 
in the United States, took the hint which they each 
followed up with more or less result. The story of 
Laura Bridgman then, has an interest apart from her 

(MS) 



146 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

own moving experiences ; and, as Dickens has said, 
it can never be told without exciting admiration for 
Dr. Howe. 

The summer of 1837, which first brought Howe 
into acquaintance with Charles Sumner, with whom 
he was afterwards so intimate, was also the time 
when he first heard of Laura Bridgman. He met 
Sumner for the first time June n, 1837, while they 
were both defending the poor Irish residents of 
Broad Street, Boston, against a mob who were 
plundering their houses and assaulting them. Sum 
ner was knocked down in the fracas, and brought off 
by Howe, who then learned the name of his young 
coadjutor. It was six weeks after this affair (the 
" Broad Street Riot") that Dr. Howe, in company 
with Sumner s intimate friends, the poet Longfellow 
and George Hillard, made the journey from Boston 
to Hanover, N. H., the seat of Dartmouth College, 
where Hillard was to give an address before the 
learned societies. Rufus Choate, the brilliant lawyer, 
and Samuel Eliot (a cousin of President Eliot of 
Harvard University), then a young collegian, were of 
the same party. They reached Hanover July 24, 
1837, and on the next day Hillard was to deliver his 
oration. In the evening they went to a musical party 
at Professor R. D. Mussey s, where Dr. Howe must 
have heard of Laura and her misfortunes from Dr. 
Mussey himself. On the morning of July 25, Dr. 
Howe, always an early riser, was up betimes, and 
away over the hills to visit the poor child in her 
father s farmhouse. He found her there, examined 
her condition professionally, x questioned her parents 

1 She was then 7^ years old. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 147 

concerning her health, the cause of her blindness, her 
habits, etc., engaged them to send her to the Boston 
Asylum in October, and, this done, returned to 
breakfast or dine with his companions, who wondered 
what had become of him, and to hear Hillard s ora 
tion in the afternoon. From Hanover they journeyed 
northeastward through the White Mountains, and 
homeward by way of Portland. x Howe must have 
studied and planned through this summer vacation 
how to approach the difficulties before him which 
in a few years he had accomplished with unques 
tioned success. 

Of the man who achieved this signal success, Mrs. 
Howe says : a 

When Dr. Howe first became aware of Laura s existence, 
the double calamity of blindness and deafness had rarely been 
observed, and never relieved to any appreciable extent. The 
way by which knowledge from without should make entrance 
into her mind was as yet unexplored, and every step in it was 
purely tentative. The man whose genius led him to confront 
this difficult problem was of the order of those who so cor 
respond to the needs of their time that they are called " provi 
dential" people. Dr. Howe s generous and impulsive youth 
had led him to take part in the desperate stand which Chris 
tianity in the East made against the barbarism of the Turk, 
backed by the diplomacy of Western Europe. He was now in

you had so pleasant a time in the White Mountains. Hillard 
returned full of what he had seen or heard, of which you were a 
great part. Choate and Howe joined." 

a "Report of the Perkins Institution for 1889," pp. 149-50. 



148 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the full force of an energetic and self-contained manhood. 1 
Deep in his convictions, sober in his conclusions, cautious and 
patient in his methods, he was the very man to sit down before 
this beleaguered citadel, with the determination to use every 
device for its relief. The personage within was unknown to 
him, and to all, save in her outer aspect. What were her char 
acteristics ? What her tendencies ? If he should ever come 
to speech with her, would she prove to be fully and normally 
human ? Would her spirit be amenable to the laws which gov 
ern the thoughts and conduct of mankind in general ? It must 
be said for the public, which became aware of this case and its 
progress, that it followed Dr. Howe s advance with the keen 
est interest. The appearance of his annual reports was waited 
for almost as are the numbers of a serial in a magazine. Much 
of this interest was no doubt inspired by an achievement so 
novel. 

Dr. Howe s own account of his celebrated pupil, 
condensed from his annual reports, is as follows : 

HER INFANCY AND LOSS OF SIGHT. 

Laura Dewey Bridgman was born in Hanover, New Hamp 
shire, on the twenty-first of December, 1829. She is described 
as having been a very sprightly and pretty infant, with bright 
blue eyes. She was, however, so puny and feeble until she was 
a year and a half old, that her parents hardly hoped to rear her. 
She was subject to severe fits, which seemed to rack her frame 
almost beyond its power of endurance, and life was held by the 
feeblest tenure ; but, when a year and a half old, she seemed to 
rally; the dangerous symptoms subsided, and at twenty months 
old, she was perfectly well. 

Then her mental powers, hitherto stinted in their growth, 
rapidly developed themselves ; and during the four months of 

1 He was thirty-six years old. At this time Mrs. Howe (Miss 
Julia Ward, of New York) did not know Dr. Howe, whom she 
met about three years later. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 149 

health which she enjoyed, she appears (making due allowance 
for a fond mother s account) to have displayed a considerable 
degree of intelligence. But suddenly she sickened again ; her 
disease raged with great violence during five weeks, when her 
eyes and ears were inflamed, suppurated, and their contents 
were discharged. But though sight and hearing were gone for 
ever, the poor child s sufferings were not ended ; the fever raged 
during seven weeks ; " for five months she was kept in bed in 
a darkened room ; it was a year before she could walk unsup 
ported, and two years before she could sit up all day." It was 
now observed that her sense of smell was almost entirely 
destroyed ; and, consequently, that her taste was much blunted. 
It was not until four years of age that the poor child s bodily 
health seemed restored, and she was able to enter upon her 
apprenticeship of life and the world. . . . 

As soon as she could walk she hegan to explore the room, 
and then the house. She followed her mother and felt of her 
hands and arms; and her disposition to imitate led her to 
repeat everything herself. She even learned to sew a little and 
to knit. But though she received all the aid that a kind mother 
could bestow, she soon began to give proof of the importance 
of language to the development of human character. Caress 
ing and chiding will do for infants and dogs, but not for chil 
dren ; and by the time Laura was seven years old, the moral 
effects of her privation began to appear. There was nothing 
to control her will but the absolute power of another, and 
humanity revolts at this; she had already begun to disregard 
all but the sterner nature of her father ; and it was evident 
that, as the propensities should increase with her physical 
growth, so would the difficulty of restraining them increase. 
At this time I was so fortunate as to hear of the child, and 
immediately hastened to Hanover to see her. I found her with 
a well-formed figure ; a strongly marked, nervous-sanguine 
temperament; a large and beautifully shaped head, and the 
whole system in healthy action. Here seemed a rare oppor 
tunity of benefiting an individual, and of trying a plan for the 
education of a deaf and blind person, which I had formed on 



150 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

seeing Julia Brace, at Hartford (in 1834). The parents were 
easily induced to consent to her coming to Boston ; and on the 
fourth of October, 1837, they brought her to the institution. 

LAURA S FIRST LESSONS. 

The first experiments were made by taking articles in com 
mon use, such as knives, forks, spoons, keys, etc., and pasting 
upon them labels with their names printed in raised letters. 
These she felt of very carefully, and soon, of course, dis 
tinguished that the crooked lines spoon differed as much from 
the crooked lines key, as the spoon differed from the key in 
form. Then small, detached labels, with the same words 
printed upon them, were put into her hands ; and she soon 
observed that they were similar to the ones pasted on the 
articles. She showed her perception of this similarity by lay 
ing the label key upon the key, and the label spoon upon the 
spoon. She was here encouraged by the natural sign of 
approbation, patting on the head. 

The same process was then repeated with all the articles 
which she could handle; and she very easily learned to place 
the proper labels upon them. It was evident, however, that the 
only intellectual exercise was that of imitation and memory. 
She recollected that the label book was placed upon a book, and 
she repeated the process, first from imitation, next from mem 
ory, with no other motive than the love of approbation, and 
apparently without the intellectual perception of any relation 
between the things. After a while, instead of labels, the indi 
vidual letters were given to her on detached pieces of paper ; 
they were arranged side by side, so as to spell book, key, etc. ; 
then they were mixed up in a heap, and a sign was made for 
her to arrange them herself, so as to express the words book, 
key, etc., and she did so. 

Hitherto, the process had been mechanical, and the success 
about as great as teaching a very knowing dog, a variety of 
tricks. The poor child had sat in mute amazement, and 
patiently imitated everything her teacher did; but now the 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 151 

truth began to flash upon her, her intellect began to work, she 
perceived that here was a way by which she could herself make 
up a sign of anything that was in her own mind, and show it 
to another mind, and at once her countenance lighted up with 
.a human expression ; it was no longer a dog or parrot it 
was an immortal spirit, eagerly seizing upon a new link of 
union with other spirits ! I could almost fix upon the moment 
when this truth dawned upon her mind, and spread its light to 
her countenance ; I saw that the great obstacle was overcome, 
and that henceforward nothing but patient and persevering, 
plain and straightforward efforts were to be used. 

The result, thus far, is quickly related, and easily conceived ; 
but not so was the process ; for many weeks of apparently 
unprofitable labor were passed before it was effected. 

The next step was to procure a set of metal types, with the 
different letters of the alphabet cast upon their ends ; also a 
board, in which were square holes, into which holes she could 
set the types, so that the letters on their ends could alone be 
felt above the surface. Then, on any article being handed her 
for instance, a pencil or a watch she would select the com 
ponent letters, and arrange them on her board, and read them 
with apparent pleasure. She was exercised for several weeks 
in this way, until her vocabulary became extensive ; and then 
the important step was taken of teaching her how to represent 
the different letters by the position of her fingers, instead of the 
cumbrous apparatus of the board and types. She accomplished 
this speedily and easily, for her intellect had begun to work in 
aid of her teacher, and her progress was rapid. 

The whole of the succeeding year was passed in gratifying 
her eager inquiries for the names of every object which she 
could possibly handle; in exercising her in the use of the man 
ual alphabet ; in extending by every possible way her knowl 
edge of the physical relations of things ; and in taking proper 
care of her health. 

At the end of the year a report of her case says : Of beauti 
ful sights, and sweet sounds, and pleasant odors, she has no 
conception ; nevertheless she seems as happy and playful as a 



152 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

bird or a lamb ; and the employment of her intellectual facul^ 
ties, the acquirement of a new idea, gives her a vivid pleasure, 
which is plainly marked in her expressive features. She never 
seems to repine, but has all the buoyancy and gaity of child 
hood. She is fond of fun and frolic, and, when playing with 
the rest of the children, her shrill laugh sounds loudest of the 
group. When left alone, she seems very happy if she has her 
knitting or sewing, and will busy herself for hours ; if she has 
no occupation, she evidently amuses herself by imaginary dia 
logues, or recalling past impressions ; she counts with her fin 
gers, or spells out names of things which she has recently 
learned, in the manual alphabet of the deaf-mutes. In this 
lonely self-communion she reasons, reflects, and argues ; if she 
spells a word wrong with the ringers of her right hand, she 
instantly strikes it with her left, as her teacher does, in sign of dis 
approbation ; if right, then she pats herself upon the head and 
looks pleased. She sometimes purposely spells a word wrong 
with the left hand, looks roguish for a moment, and laughs, 
and then with the right hand strikes the left, as if to correct it. 
When Laura is walking through a passage-way, with her 
hands spread before her, she knows instantly every one she 
meets, and passes them with a sign of recognition ; but if it be 
a girl of her own age, and especially if one of her favorites, 
there is instantly a bright smile of recognition, an intertwining 
of arms, a grasping of hands, and a swift telegraphing upon the 
tiny fingers, whose rapid evolutions convey the thoughts and 
feelings from the outposts of one mind to those of the other. 
There are questions and answers, exchanges of joy or sorrow ; 
there are kissings and partings, just as between little children 
with all their senses. One such interview is a better refutation 
of the doctrine, that mind is the result of sensation, than folios of 
learned argument. If those philosophers who consider man as 
only the most perfect animal, and attribute his superiority to 
his senses, be correct, then a dog or a monkey should have 
mental power quadruple that of poor Laura, who has but one 
sense. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 153 

LAURA AND HER MOTHER. 

During this year (1836), and six months after she had left 
home, her mother came to visit her, and their meeting was an 
interesting one. The mother stood some time, gazing with 
overflowing eyes upon her unfortunate child, who, all uncon 
scious of her presence, was playing about the room. Presently 
Laura ran against her, and at once began feeling of her hands, 
examining her dress, and trying to find out if she knew her ; 
but, not succeeding in this, she turned away as from a stranger, 
and the poor woman could not conceal the pang she felt, at 
finding that her beloved child did not know her. She then gave 
Laura a string of beads which she used to wear at home, which 
were recognized by the child at once, who, with much joy, put 
them around her neck, and sought me eagerly, to say she 
understood the string was from her home. The mother now 
tried to caress her, but poor Laura repelled her, preferring to 
be with her acquaintances. Another article from home was 
now given her, and she began to look much interested ; she 
examined the stranger much closer, and gave me to understand 
that she knew she came from Hanover ; she even endured her 
caresses, but would leave her with indifference at the slightest 
signal. The distress of the mother was now painful to behold; 
for, although she had feared that she should not be recognized, 
yet the reality of being treated with cold indifference by a 
darling child was too much for woman s nature to bear. 

After a while, on the mother taking hold of her again, a vague 
idea seemed to flit across Laura s mind, that this could not be 
a stranger ; she therefore felt of her hands very eagerly, while 
her countenance assumed an expression of intense interest ; 
she became very pale, and then suddenly red ; hope seemed 
struggling with doubt and anxiety, and never were contending 
emotions more strongly painted upon the human face. At this 
moment of painful uncertainty, the mother drew her close to 
her side, and kissed her fondly ; when at once the truth flashed 
upon the child, and all mistrust and anxiety disappeared from 
her face, as with an expression of exceeding joy she eagerly 



154 DR - s - G. HOWE. 

nestled to the bosom of her parent, and yielded herself to her 
fond embraces. 

After this, the beads were all unheeded ; the playthings 
which were offered to her were utterly disregarded ; her play 
mates, for whom but a moment before she gladly left the 
stranger, now vainly strove to pull her from her mother ; and, 
though she yielded her usual instantaneous obedience, to my 
signal to follow me, it was evidently with reluctance. She clung 
close to me, as if bewildered and fearful ; and when, after a 
moment, I took her to her mother, she sprang to her arms, and 
clung to her with eager joy. 

I had watched the whole scene with intense interest, being 
desirous of learning from it all I could of the workings of her 
mind ; but I now left them to indulge unobserved those deli 
cious feelings, which those who have known a mother s love 
may conceive, but which cannot be expressed. 

LAURA COINS WORDS. 

In her eagerness to advance her knowledge of words and to 
communicate her ideas, she coins words, and is always guided 
by analogy. Sometimes her process of word-making is very 
interesting ; for instance, after some time spent in giving her 
an idea of the abstract meaning of alone, she seemed to obtain 
it, and understanding that being by one s set/was to be alone, 
or al-one ; she was told to go to her chamber, or school, or 
elsewhere, and return alone ; she did so, but soon after, wish 
ing to go with one of the little girls, she strove to express her 
meaning thus, " Laura go al-two." The same eagerness is 
manifested in her attempts to define for the purpose of classifi 
cation ; for instance, some one giving her the word bachelor, 
she came to her teacher for a definition. She was taught that 
men who had wives were husbands, those who had none, 
bachelors; when asked if she understood, she said " man no 
have wife, bachelor Tenny bachelor ;" referring to an old 
friend of hers. Being told to define bachelor, she said, 
"bachelor, no have wife and smoke pipe." Thus she con

a specific mark of the species bachelor. Then, in order to test 
her knowledge of the word, it was said by her teacher, 
" Tenny has got no wife ; what is Tenny ? " She paused, and 
then said, " Tenny is wrong ! " 

The word widow being explained to her (a woman whose 
husband is dead), she being called upon to define, she said, 
" widow is woman, man dead and cold" and eked out her 
meaning by sinking down and dropping her hand, to signify in 
the ground. The two last words she added herself, they not 
having been in the definition ; but instantly associates the idea 
of coldness and burial \v\i\\. death. Her having acquired any 
idea of death was not by the wish of her teacher, it having 
been his intention to reserve the subject until such a develop 
ment of her reason should be attained as would enable him to 
give a correct idea of it. He hopes still, by aid of the analogy 
of the germination and growth of plants, to give her a consol 
ing hope of resurrection, to counterbalance the almost instinc 
tive dread of death. She had touched a dead body before she 
came to the institution. 

HER WRITING, AND HER AESTHETICS. 

Having acquired the use of substantives, adjectives, verbs, 
prepositions and conjunctions, it was deemed time to make the 
experiment of trying to teach her to write, and to show her 
that she might communicate her ideas to persons not in con 
tact with her. It was amusing to witness the mute amaze 
ment with which she submitted to the process, the docility 
with which she imitated every motion, and the perseverance 
with which she moved her pencil over and over again in the 
same track, until she could form the letter. But when at last 
the idea dawned upon her, that by this mysterious process she 
could make other people understand what she thought, her joy 
was boundless. Never did a child apply more eagerly and joy 
fully to any task than she did to this, and in a few months she 
could make every letter distinctly, and separate words from 
each other. 



156 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

She has the same fondness for a dress, for ribbons, and for 
finery as other girls of her age, and, as a proof that it arises 
from the same amiable desire of pleasing others, it may be 
remarked that whenever she has a new bonnet or any new 
article of dress, she is particularly desirous to go to meeting, 
or to go out with it. If people do not notice it, she directs 
their attention by placing their hands upon it. Generally she 
indicates her preference for such visitors as are the best 
dressed. 

She is so much in company with blind persons that she 
thinks blindness common ; and, when first meeting persons, 
she asks if they are blind, or she feels of their eyes. She 
evidently knows that the blind differ from seeing persons, for 
when she shows blind persons anything, she always puts their 
fingers on it. 

She seems to have a perception of character, and to have no 
esteem for those who have little intellect. The following 
anecdote is significant of her perception of character, and 
shows that from her friends she requires something more than 
good-natured indulgence. A new scholar entered school, a 
little girl about Laura s age. She was very helpless, and Laura 
took great pride and great pains in showing her the way about 
the house, assisting her to dress and undress, and doing for her 
many things which she could not do for herself. In a few 
weeks it began to be apparent, even to Laura, that the child 
was not only helpless, but naturally very stupid, being almost 
an idiot. Then Laura gave her up in despair, and avoided her, 
and has ever since had an aversion to being with her, passing 
her by as if in contempt. By a natural association of ideas she 
attributes to this child all those countless deeds which Mr. 
Nobody does in every house ; if a chair is broken or anything 
misplaced, and no one knows who did it, Laura attributes it at 
once to this child. 

Sometimes her acts and expressions furnish themes as inter 
esting to the poet as to the philosopher. On New Year s Day, 
when I was in Europe, she met her teacher, and said : " It is 
new happy year day," The teacher wished her a happy New 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 157 

Year; when she turned to the East, and, stretching out her 
hand, said: " I want Doctor a happy New Year," She then 
paused, and, turning to her teacher, said : " But Doctor cannot 
know I say so." 

I have sometimes questioned her about her aesthetical per 
ceptions, but have not obtained any very sal isfactory answers. 
Her ideas of beauty in material things are principally connected 
with smoothness. A round ball is not more beautiful to her 
than a square box, provided they are equally smooth. Fresh 
ness or newness is, indeed, an element, but this is evidently 
derived from the associations with new clothes, new shoes, etc. 
With respect to long or short noses, regular or irregular features, 
she has no thought ; and yet it is probable that a monstrously 
large nose would shock her, and that one as short as Dr. 
Slop s would amuse her ; for, on my asking how she would like 
a person with a nose not larger than a pea, she said it would be 
" funny." She perceives symmetry of person, however, and is 
disagreeably affected by any strongly marked departure from 
it. On asking her if a little hump-backed girl was handsome, 
she said, very emphatically, " No !" "Why not?" said I. 
" Because," said she, " she is crooked ; " and she imitated the 
motion of the child walking, and asked why she could not grow 
like other children. She said a lady of her acquaintance, who 
is very fat and ungainly, was very ugly, "Why?" said I. 
But she could only reply that she did not know that she was too 
large about the waist, and that "her stomach came out too quick." 

I asked her who was the handsomest lady of her acquaint 
ance, and she replied, " ; " but, upon my pressing her 

for her reason, she could only say that her hands were smooth, 
soft, and pretty. 

A cane with knots on it was less pleasing to her than a 
smooth one, and an irregular knobbed stick than one with the 
prominences at regular intervals. She has thus the rudiments 
of the aesthetic sense, but, like that of other children, its 
development must depend upon education and habit. She is 
not yet old enough to give any satisfactory account of her own 
feelings on the subject. 



158 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

THE RESULT OF TEN YEARS TEACHING. 

When she began fairly to comprehend and to use arbitrary 
language, then she got hold of a thread by which her mind 
could be guided out into the light ; she has held on to it firmly 
and followed it eagerly, and come out into a world which has 
been made to her one of joy and gladness by the general 
welcome with which she has been greeted. Her progress has 
been a curious and an interesting spectacle. She has come into 
human society with a sort of triumphal march ; her course has 
been a perpetual ovation. Thousands have been watching her 
with eager eyes, and applauding each successful step ; while 
she, all unconscious of their gaze, holding on to the slender 
thread and feeling her way along, has advanced with faith and 
courage towards those who awaited her with trembling hope. 
Nothing shows more than her case the importance which, 
despite their useless waste of human life and human capacity, 
men really attach to a human soul. They owe to her something 
for furnishing an opportunity of showing how much of good 
ness there is in them ; for surely the way in which she has been 
regarded is creditable to humanity. Perhaps there are not 
three living women whose names are more widely known than 
hers ; and there is not one who has excited so much sympathy 
and interest. There are thousands of women in the world who 
are striving to attract its notice and gain its admiration some 
by the natural magic of beauty and grace, some by the high 
nobility of talent, some by the lower nobility of rank and 
title, some by the vulgar show of wealth ; but none of them has 
done it so effectually as this poor blind, deaf, and dumb girl, by 
the silent show of her misfortunes, and her successful efforts to 
surmount them. 

Everything that has been printed here respecting her has 
been reprinted in England, and translations have been made into 
the Continental languages ; so that Laura, without any other 
claim to notice than the weight of her misfortunes and the 
effort made to lighten them, enjoys almost a world-wide 
renown. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 159 

DICKENS S PRAISE OF DR. HOWE. 

How true were these remarks about the fame that 
Laura had acquired, may be seen, in part, by the 
space which Charles Dickens, the novelist, gave to 
her story, in his " American Notes" printed in 1842, 
and published in America before 1843. In the spring 
of 1842 Dickens had spent a month in Boston, and 
had several times visited Dr. Howe and his " institu 
tion," which was then legally entitled "The Perkins 
Institution and Massachusetts Asylum for the Blind," 
and had by this time been removed to " Mount Wash 
ington " in South Boston, where it occupied a fine 
breezy hill top, close by the old fortifications of 
Washington on Dorchester Heights/ He says : 

I sat down in another room before a girl, blind, deaf, and 
dumb, destitute of smell, and nearly so of taste ; before a fair 
young creature (she was then twelve) with every human faculty 
and hope and power of goodness and affection, inclosed within 
her delicate frame ; and but one outward sense the sense of 
touch. There she was before me, built up, as it were, in a 
marble cell, impervious to any ray of light or particle of 
sound ; with her poor white hand, peeping through a hink in 
the wall, beckoning to some good man for help, that an immor 
tal soul might be awakened. Long before I looked upon her, 
the help had come. Her face was radiant with intelligence and 
pleasure. From the mournful ruin of such bereavement, there 
had slowly risen up this gentle, tender, guileless, grateful- 
hearted being. I have extracted a few disjointed fragments of 
her history from an account written by that one man who has 
made her what she is. It is a very beautiful and touching nar- 



1 It remains and will remain in this spot, where its estate has 
been much enlarged of late. 



l6o DR. S. G. HOWE. 

rative. The name of her great benefactor and friend, who 
writes it, is Dr. Howe. There are not many persons, I hope 
and believe, who, after reading these passages can ever hear 
that name with indifference. Well may that gentleman call 
that a delightful moment, in which some distant promise of her 
present state first dawned upon the darkened mind of Laura 
Bridgman. Throughout his life, the recollection of that 
moment will be to him a source of pure, unfading happiness ; 
nor will it shine less brightly on the evening of his days of 
noble usefulness. 1 

Now, when it is considered that Dickens was then 
the most popular author in the language, and that 
this book, " American Notes for General Circulation," 
did circulate in the world as widely as any of his 
novels, some conception can be formed of the extent 
to which Laura and her education became known, 
while she was yet a child. As she grew to be a 
woman, she still remained in the care of Dr. Howe ; 
for she never married, and there was no family prop 
erty, and no cccupation by which she could earn her 
own support. Of this Dr. Howe wrote pathetically 
in 1849, when she had begun to appreciate her own 
position, and to wish for some means of earning 
money. The passage will be cited shortly ; it occurs 
in one of the reports of the Blind Asylum. But first 
should be given the account of Laura s visit to the 
American Asylum for the Deaf in Hartford, a few 
months before Dickens saw her. I quote from a let 
ter in the New York Commercial Advertiser.

LAURA AND JULIA BRACE. 

HARTFORD, November, 1841. 

I was at the school for the deaf and dumb, this morning-, when 
that interesting little creature, Laura Bridgman (who has but 
one sense that of touch), arrived from Boston, and made her 
first visit. She was accompanied by Dr. Howe, Mrs. Sigour- 
ney, and some other persons, and her coming seemed to be 
quite unexpected. It is probable that there is hardly another 
person in the United States whose appearance at the school 
would create such a sensation among the hundred and fifty 
inmates. Her name was familiar to all the pupils, who had 
doubtless marveled much how a dumb child, deprived also of 
the sense of sight, by which they themselves learn everything, 
should be able to learn to read, write, and talk. 

When the news was passed from hand to hand that Laura 
Bridgman was in the office, the teachers and pupils came 
thronging round her, and filled the room and passage-way; 
while all the way up the staircase stood scores of little girls, 
with sparkling eyes and animated faces, eagerly gesticulating 
to each other, and conversing rapidly in dumb show. 

It was a beautiful sight to see so much life and happiness 
among those unfortunates ; but the principal attraction was 
little Laura, who, having taken off her bonnet and cloak, ap 
peared one of the most interesting children you ever saw^ 
Slender and delicately formed, with beautiful features and fair 
complexion, so graceful were her motions, so animated her 
gesticulations, and so full of life was her countenance, that, 
but for the green ribbon bound over her sightless orbs, you 
would have called her one of nature s most gifted children. 
Such is the power of the soul such its independence of sense. 
There stood this child in a crowd, without one ray of light to 
pierce her ever-during darkness, without a sound to break the 
dreary stillness, without an odor even to show the presence of 
others ; yet joyous as a bird, yet conscious of everything that 
was going on, yet eager to shake hands with all, and to learn 



1 62 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the names of all ; delighted to find that everyone could talk in 
her finger language, and evidently enjoying the boon of exist 
ence, and speaking in dumb but expressive language the praise 
of Him who willeth the happiness of all whom He createth. 

She was very impatient to meet Julia Brace, the only person in 
the world, perhaps, whose privation of sense approaches in 
degree to hers ; and about whom it seems much had been told 
her. At last Julia was brought down, and the two met, and 
felt of each other. But what a difference between the two ! 
Julia is a woman grown, and unprepossessing in her appear 
ance because she is without animation, without vivacity, 
without any expression of face. She was made to understand, 
by placing her fingers on Laura s eyes and on her ears, that she 
was blind and deaf like herself, but her countenance changed 
not ; she manifested little interest, and in a moment or two 
began to withdraw from the child, who clung to her, put 
around her neck a chain of her own braiding, and kissed her. 
Vain impulse of affection ! Julia coolly put into her pocket the 
present which Laura had brought her, and was making off 
from the child, whose distress now became evident, and who 
eagerly asked the others, " Why does she push me ? Why 
does she not love me ? " 

What a contrast in their character! Laura wanted her 
affection and sympathy, and would not be satisfied without 
them ; while Julia, having got her present, was desirous of ter 
minating the interview, and carrying off her possession. Such 
is the effect of education ; such the consequence of evolving 
the moral and social nature, as has been done in the case of 
Laura ; or of exercising only the lower propensities, and allow 
ing the human being to live as do the brutes, within himself 
and for himself alone. 

I suspect this letter is from the hand of Dr. Howe, for 
it barely mentions him, and passes to that aspect of 
Laura s education on which he loved best to dwell, its 
effect in unfolding the higher nature, and completing 
the work which heaven leaves for man to do. He had 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 163 

promised Colonel Stone, of the Commercial Advertiser, 
in a private letter some months before, to wr.ite 
something on this peculiar education : and this 
earlier letter is worth citing, because it speaks of 
another deaf, dumb, and blind girl (Lucy Reid, from 
Vermont), who did not prove so tractable a pupil as 
Laura. 

LETTER FROM DR. HOWE TO W. L. STONE. 

BOSTON, July 5, 1841. 
MY DEAR COLONEL 

You certainly have a most extraordinary faculty of finding 
out what everybody on earth is doing indeed I begin to 
think you have some magnetic imp in your printing establish 
ment who reads through stone walls as we do through glass 
all for the benefit of the Commercial / How did you get hold 
of my account of the person blistering his fingers to read the 
Testament ? It is a pity, however, that your Flibbertigibbet 
did not read more accurately. The scene was a military 
station on the banks of the Ganges the subject a blind pen 
sioner, a British soldier not a Dutchman. He blistered his 
fingers, not once, but many times, and at last got them so that 
he could read easily, when he literally sang aloud for joy. 

But, Colonel, I want your aid in a plan I have for stereotyp 
ing the New Testament for the blind. x It will be a very 
expensive affair say $1,500 for the plates and one small edi 
tion; but after that there will be no expense save that of 
paper and binding the press-work being but a trifle. We 
have been obliged to economise the edition which was printed 
in 1837, and to give copies only to those who were most likely 
to be benefited. But with all this we have not now more than 



1 See Dr, Howe s remarks on the Scriptures for the blind on 
p. 131. 



164 DR. S. 0. HOWE. 

enough to supply all who are calling for copies, and in the 
course of a few months all will be taken up. 

There is no class of persons to whom the Scriptures are 
more acceptable than to the blind ; for their infirmity, while it 
increases their sense of dependence upon God, gives them 
much leisure to study His word and His works. 

I could give you the most touching cases of calls from the 
blind for the sacred Scriptures. I could send you autograph 
letters from them, acknowledging in the liveliest terms their 
gratitude for a gift of the Testament. I could prove to you 
from the statistics of the country, that the demand for the 
Scriptures by the blind will be permanent and increasing. All 
this indeed I propose to do, if we can devise any plan by which 
the work is likely to be accomplished. I wish, therefore, you 
would give me your opinion on the subject. I suppose we 
shall have to rely mainly upon the Bible societies. If it is 
advisable, I will come to New York to consult with friends 
there. I am desirous of accomplishing the work this summer. 

I am happy to tell you, that, after nearly six months appar 
ently vain efforts, we have at last opened the means of com 
munication with the mind of our unfortunate deaf and blind 
girl from Vermont. 1 You know that she was very wild 
almost savage, when she was brought here, and that she wore 
her head in a bag. For a long time she not only was sullen and 
unsocial, but she furiously repulsed all attempts to teach her, 
and would not submit to any endearments. So intractable was 
she, that I feared she might be insane. 

When she grew more docile, she submitted, indeed, to the 
attempts to teach her arbitrary signs, but was entirely passive, 
and utterly unconscious of the nature of the process to which 
she submitted. Her mind, entirely unused to reflection, seemed 
enshrouded in darkness and stillness as profound as that of the 
tomb, and only at times manifested mute amazement ; but at 
last it seemed to seize upon the clew which was offered to it, 
and by that clew is now guiding itself out into the light. She 



1 This was Lucy Reid. 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 165 

is now manifestly aware of the nature of the process to which 
she is subjected;, her countenance is alive with a human 
expression ; she comprehends the signs, and names several 
things, and begins to ask for more. The most delightful part 
of it is that little Laura is a most ardent and useful coadjutor 
in the work of enlightening Lucy. 

I shall at some time make you a communication for the Com 
mercial on this subject. 

Believe me ever yours, 

S. G. HOWE. 

The education of poor Lucy could not be carried so 
far as that of Laura ; and, though the case of Oliver 
Caswell, another blind youth, admitted tu Dr. Howe s 
School about October, 1841, was far more interesting 
than Lucy s, 1 it did not approach the interest which 
Laura s peculiar mental and emotional development 
inspired in all who knew her, or read her wonderful 
story. An interest quite similar, and yet diverse is 
felt in Helen Keller, who now talks intelligibly, as 
Laura never could. 

LAURA S WORLDLY POSITION AT TWENTY YE s OLD. 

When the school-education of Laura had been in 
some degree completed, Dr. Howe, who had, from 
time to time, reported her progress, made in one of 
his yearly reports the following statement and 
suggestion concerning her future career : 

" Perhaps, by a little effort on the part of her friends, 



1 Lucy Reid came from Derby, Vt., February 16, 1841, and was 
recalled by her parents July I3th. Had she remained she could 
have been taught something useful. Oliver Caswell came Septem 
ber 30, 1 841, and remained several years. His portrait with Laura s 
was painted by Fisher in 1844, and may be seen at South Boston. 



1 66 L&gt;R. S. G. HOWE. 

money enough might be raised to buy for her a life 
annuity, which would place her beyond the reach of 
pecuniary want, and secure to her the attendance and 
companionship of some young lady, who could be to 
her what Miss Wight has so long been. Laura will 
do what she can, diligently and cheerfully, to perform 
those duties and labors of life, of which every con 
scientious person should discharge his proper share. 
She asks no one to do for her what she can do for 
herself. She wishes no one to be her menial or ser 
vant. She has already done some service in her day 
and generation, by setting forth in her deportment, 
under her sore afflictions, the native dignity of the 
human character. She has shown in- what degree the 
spirit is dependent upon the senses for its manifesta 
tion and enjoyment. She has shown how little the 
fictitious and arbitrary distinctions of life are neces 
sary to happiness. She is, however, utterly depend 
ent upon human sympathy and aid for the contin 
uance of her happiness, and even of her life. She can 
appeal only as she has done, by the mute exhibition 
of her helplessness, for that sympathy and aid. 
Hitherto it has been proffered with eagerness and in 
abundance. May it never be withheld ; may an hour 
of need never come to her ; but may new friends be 
raised up to her, when those who now watch over 
her with the tender solicitude of parents can watch 
over and comfort her no longer upon earth ! " 

This wish of the doctor was fulfilled, and by the 
help of a small annuity, and the liberality of the 
Trustees of the Asylum, which by this time called 
itself the " Massachusetts School for the Blind " 
Laura continued to live at South Boston, until her 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 167 

death in 1889, when she was nearly sixty years old. 
At that time, and for thirteen years before, Dr. 
Howe s son-in-law, Dr. Michael Anagnos, a Greek 
from Epirus, was the Director of the School which 
Howe had founded, and to which he had given the 
devotion of his life. 



CHAPTER IV. 

DR. HOWE S SCHOOL FOR IDIOTS. 

EARLY in his experience with the blind and the 
deaf Dr. Howe found that in many children this loss 
of certain senses was connected with a general weak 
ening of the mental powers sometimes with actual 
idiocy. This fact, and his observations among the 
insane, which began before 1840, drew his attention 
strongly to the condition of idiots ; and when a mem 
ber of the State Legislature in 1846, he procured the 
appointment of a commission to report to the Legis 
lature on the number and condition of the idiots and 
imbeciles in Massachusetts. He wrote in 1846-47, the 
report of this commission, having previously collected 
the facts and statistics needful ; and upon the state 
ments and conclusions of this report have been based 
not only the provisions made for teaching feeble 
minded children in Massachusetts, but those in many 
other States. 

The report was published in 1847, and in 1848 the 
State appropriated $2,500 a year for three years, for 
the teaching of ten idiotic children. These children 
were gathered in and taught at the Blind Asylum, 
under the eye of Dr. Howe; in 1851 a separate 
school was opened in buildings not far off, and the 

(168) 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 169 

State appropriation increased to $5,000 a year. It is 
now (1891) about $30,000 a year, and the whole income 
of the school reaches nearly $50,000 a year. There 
are more than 300 pupils, and while some of them 
remain at South Boston, nearly all are now quartered 
in fine new buildings at Waltham. 

Massachusetts has, in fact, thoroughly adopted as 
her own, this joint work of Dr. Howe and his friend, 
Dr. Edward Jarvis. With it may also be connected 
the name of another citizen, Caleb Gushing, eminent 
for his learning and abilities, but detested many 
years in Massachusetts for his pro-slavery politics. 
General Gushing often represented his town, New- 
buryport, in the General Court, usually as one of a 
lean minority, after 1841, when he followed John 
Tyler out of the Whig party. One year, about 1860, 
perhaps, he was a representative, when the usual com 
mittee reported an increased appropriation for Dr. 
Howe s Idiot School. There was some opposition; 
the committee did not support the bill in debate, and 
it was likely to be defeated. At this point Gushing, 
to whom nothing had been said by any friend of the 
bill, rose and spoke for ten minutes in its support ; 
explained the usefulness of the school, praised Dr. 
Howe (then one of his warmest political foes), and 
carried the measure. Next week, in the railway train, 
Dr. Howe found Gushing sitting solitary ; went up to 
him and thanked him warmly for his timely aid. 
" Dr. Howe," said Gushing, " you are a remarkable 
man." "You are pleased to say so, but why?" "You 
are a very remarkable man the only man in Massa 
chusetts that can see any good in what Gen. Gushing 
has done." There was pride and pathos in this remark, 



CHAPTER V. 

DR. HOWE S UNIVERSAL PHILANTHROPY. 

AT his death in 1876, funeral honors were paid to 
this good man, under the name of " The Massachu 
setts Philanthropist," not because he was the only 
one of his class there, where philanthropy is common, 
but because his philanthropy was universal, and 
knew no limits. He, more than any man since John 
Howard, had, like that English reformer of prisons, 
trod in Howard s " open, but unfrequented path to 
immortality ; " nor did he neglect Howard s particu 
lar clients, the wretches in prison. He joined in the 
movement in Boston which abolished imprisonment 
for debt ; he was an early and active member of the 
Boston Prison Discipline Society, which once did 
much service ; and for years, when interest in prison 
reform was at a low ebb in Massachusetts, the one 
forlorn relict of that once powerful organization, a 
" Prisoner s Aid Society " used to hold its meetings in 
Dr. Howe s spacious chamber in Bromfield street. 
He took an early interest in the care of the insane, 
with which his friends Horace Mann, Dr. Edward 
Jarvis, and Dorothy Dix were greatly occupied ; and 
in later years, as will be seen, he introduced some 
most useful methods of caring for the insane in Mas- 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 17 I 

sachusetts. He favored the temperance reform, and 
wrote much as a physician, on the harm done to 
individuals and to the human stock by the use of 
alcoholic liquors. He stood with Father Taylor of 
the Seaman s Bethel, in Boston, for the salvation of 
sailors and their protection from cruel punishments, 
and he was one of those who almost abolished the 
flogging of children in schools. During his whole 
career as a reformer of public schools in New Eng 
land, Horace Mann had no friend more intimate, or 
more helpful than Dr. Howe, nor one whose support 
was more indispensable to Mann himself. To prove 
this much might be quoted from Mann s constant 
correspondence with Howe between 1838 and 1869, 
when Mann died. But it will be sufficient here to 
cite what Mrs. Howe has written concerning the two 
friends : 

The labors of Horace Mann in behalf of public education 
belong to this period. They entitle him to grateful remem 
brance in the community in which he became an apostle of 
rational culture. Mr. Mann, like Dr. Howe, was at once a 
practical and an ideal philanthropist, inspired with a deep 
enthusiasm which expressed itself in timely words, and still 
more in deeds of lasting benefit to humanity. Trained in the 
legal profession, he derived from it the clear and logical modes 
of thought which guided his public life. The proper treatment 
of the insane, the introduction of normal schools and of high- 
school education for girls were matters to which he devoted 
many years of his life, with what result we need not here 
relate. The friendship which united these two noble men was 
intimate and lifelong. Each was to the other a source of 
inspiration. Both were strenuous opponents of every enslav 
ing agency, and resolute advocates of principles truly republi 
can, Dr. Howe always spoke of Mr. Mann with reverent 



172 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

affection. The writer remembers a certain very thorough 
overhauling of the public schools of Boston which was insti 
tuted by Dr. Howe, in his one year of service on the school 
board, 1 and regarding which Mr. Mann said : " It could only 
have been done by an angel or by Sam Howe." 

During all this unwearied activity Dr. Howe never 
neglected his special task, the education of the blind, 
and Laura Bridgman ; but there were times when he 
sighed for a furlough in this unceasing war. His 
health, shaken by fever in Greece, was never fully 
restored, and he had moods of restlessness and depres 
sion, in which his friends had to remind him how 
much he had done, and what a career was still before 
him. In those periods he sometimes sought to 
escape from the yoke of his task ; the ills of humanity 
were too much for him to bear. Sumner has pre 
served the record of one of these escapades, which 
seldom went farther than to form and urge with zeal 
a project that soon failed or was abandoned. In the 
summer of 1841, when the Whig party had come into 
power after a long absence from national office, 
and Daniel Webster was Secretary of State, Howe 
was attracted toward Europe again, which for nine 
years he had not seen, and always towards Southern 
Europe. He would go to Spain as a diplomatist in 
the hope, I fancy, that he could explore in some old 
Spanish library, the history of that extraordinary 
instruction of the deaf in Spain early in the seventeenth 
century, of which Sir Kenelm Digby described so fine 
an example in his Nature of Bodies, and concern 
ing which Juan Pablo Bonet had written a book.

What followed shall be taken from a letter of Charles 
Sumner to his brother George, September 4, 1842 : x 

My friend Howe, whose various claims to public and pri 
vate regard you recognize, who was seven years in Greece, 
who was by the side of Lafayette during the Three Days ; 2 and 
who has led a life of singular chivalry and philanthropy ; in 
many respects one of the most remarkable men of the age ; 
speaking French, German, and Greek ; in a moment of restless 
ness, Howe allowed himself to apply for the place of Secretary 
of Legation, at Madrid, a year ago. His appointment was 
urged by the warmest letters from Prescott, who had been 
invited by Webster to designate some fit person for the place ; 
Tecknor, who is, perhaps, Webster s warmest personal friend ; 
Choate, who has Webster s place in the Senate, and Abbott 
Lawrence ; but no notice was taken of the application, and 
Howe has regretted very much that he brought himself to 
make it." 

These unhappy moods soon passed away, but they 
returned now and then, so long as Dr. Howe con 
tinued in his place at South Boston and that was all 
his life. He died there in the beautifully retired 
cottage among the hills and overlooking an inland har 
bor, where his garden and orchard and greenhouses 
solaced the hours of leisure which with him were 
few where his children had grown up around him, 
and where he had so often entertained at his table 
the famous and the good from all parts of the world. 
His house was open no less to the obscure and perse 
cuted, to the fugitive from Poland or France, or

Germany, or from a worse tyranny in Carolina, Vir 
ginia, and Kentucky. Here Longfellow had first met 
Kossuth, and here, a few years later, John Brown ate 
sparingly, and slept for a night, as he moved from 
State to State, preparing for some conflict in Kansas 
or Virginia. It \vas fitting that Howe should return 
there to die, amid the scenes of his philanthropic 
triumphs, and the garden trees he had planted. 
Dying, his memory reverted to the past.

CHAPTER VI. 

DR. HOWE S MARRIAGE AND VISIT TO EUROPE. 

IT was at the Blind Asylum, in South Boston, and 
as the instructor of Laura Bridgman, if I am not 
mistaken, that Miss Julia Ward, of New York, first 
saw her future husband. She was one of a family of 
three sisters, celebrated in New York fifty years ago 
as the " Three Graces of Bond Street," where their 
father, Mr. Ward, a banker (of the once well-known 
firm, Prime, Ward & King), lived elegantly, and 
entertained with hospitality. One of these sisters 
married Mr. Maillard, connected with the Bonaparte 
family, another, Thomas Crawford, the sculptor, 
(lather of Marion Crawford, the novelist) ; but the 
third and most gifted became the wife of Dr. Howe. 
They spent the summer of 1841 in Dorchester, not 
far from the Blind Asylum, and it was then, I sup 
pose, that Dr. Howe fell in love. In August 1842,* 



^umner, in a letter to Longfellow, dated August 20, 1842, 
makes this odd allusion to the visit. "At Stockbridge I left the 
girls (his sisters) to ramble about, while Howe and I started on a 
journey to New York, inchiding Hell Gate, where we passed the 
chief part of our time. The Three Graces were bland and lovely." 
As Sumner seldom jested, we must suppose that he did not typify 
courtship by " Hell Gate," but meant that they passed much time 
in excursions on the East River. See Memoir of Charles Sunnier, II, 
p. 220. 

(175) 



176 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

along with his intimate friend, Charles Sumner, he 
visited New York for the sake of meeting Miss Julia 
Ward, and the " engagement " was soon after an 
nounced. They were married in April, 1843, and 
early in May sailed for England, preceded by a letter 
from Sumner to Lord Morpeth (afterward Earl of 
Carlisle) in which he said: "This note is mainly to 
announce the coming of my dear friend Howe, and 
his newly married wife. I cannot write too warmly 
of Howe. He is shy, reserved, modest, but full of 
worth, intelligence, and virtue. Perhaps you will 
remember his wife, who is unsurpassed in cultivation 
by any of her sex in the United States." She was 
indeed, as her subsequent life has shown, a lady of 
rare learning, genius, and grace of style, and her 
poems are now better known than those of any woman 
in America. Such a married pair could not fail to 
be well received wherever they might go ; and, with 
the exception of Prussia, which was closed to them, 
they made the usual tour of Europe, spending much 
time in Italy, where Dr. Howe s oldest daughter, 
Julia Romana, afterwards Mrs. Anagnos, was born 
early in 1844, and christened by Theodore Parker, 
who also happened to be in Rome that winter. Three 
weeks later Dr. Howe made his brief visit to Greece, 
and to his Corinthian colony, already described. He 
had requested Sumner to visit this colony in 1839, 
and had given him letters to Tricoupi, Mavrocordato, 
and the other statesmen of Greece, but Sumner 
lingered in Rome, and never made the journey. 
Returning to Italy in April, Howe visited Naples, and 
then went to pass the summer in England. He there 
visited Dr. Fowler, of Salisbury, a man " of a spirit 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 177 

kindred to his own." There also he made the 
acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, and, 
through them, of Florence Nightingale, not yet 
known to fame, though even at that time a young 
lady much admired ; having given evidence of that 
superiority of character which has since made her 
name one of those most honored in her own time. 
The bent of Miss Nightingale s mind in 1844 was in 
the direction of what we may call philosophical phil 
anthropy. She held many conversations with Dr. 
Howe upon matters of mutual interest, and one or 
two which may be thought to have determined her 
after-life. 

It was perhaps at this house of the Bracebridges 
orat some other charming home in Southern England, 
that the story should be localized which I have heard 
Dr. Howe tell, concerning himself and Florence 
Nightingale. 1 Always an early riser, Dr. Howe used 



1 Florence Nightingale is a year or two younger than Mrs. 
Howe, being born in 1820, at Florence, Italy (whence her name), 
the youngest daughter of an English banker named Shore, who to 
inherit an estate took the name of Nightingale, which his child has 
made so illustrious. She was highly educated, and in 1844 might 
compare with Mrs. Howe for her knowledge of Latin, of French 
and Italian, of German and of music, while she had that facility in 
mathematics which some women display so remarkably. But she 
also had a turn for active benevolence, and as a girl had visited 
hospitals and workhouse infirmaries, which was not then, as it has 
since become, a fashionable pursuit. She did not go through the 
training of Pastor Fliedner s school of deaconesses, however, until 
1849, when she seems to have entered steadily on the work of her 
life. She became famous from 1854, when at the head of a hundred 
nurses, she established her hospital for soldiers of the Crimea at 
Scutari. She is still living (July, 1891), but has long been 
an invalid. Her sister, Lady Verney, died in 1890. 



178 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

to spend the time before breakfast in the great gar 
den of this English country-house where the Howes 
and Miss Nightingale were visiting. She also used 
to come forth into the garden, and they had many 
long talks there, among the roses and lilies. In one 
of these talks the young lady said : " Dr. Howe, you 
have had much experience in the world of philan 
thropy ; you are a medical man, and a gentleman ; 
now may I ask you to tell me, upon your word, 
whether it would be anything unsuitable or unbe 
coming to a young Englishwoman, if she should 
devote herself to works of charity, in hospitals and 
elsewhere, as the Catholic Sisters do?" Dr. Howe 
had learned by this time the earnest character of his 
young friend, and he said to her : 

" My dear Miss Florence, it would be unusual, and, 
in England, whatever is unusual is apt to be thought 
unsuitable ; but I say to you, go forward, if you have 
a vocation for that way of life ; act up to your aspir 
ation, and you will find that there is never anything 
unbecoming or unladylike in doing your duty for 
the good of others. Choose your path, go on with 
it, wherever it may lead you, and God be with 
you !" 

Miss Nightingale thanked him, and the matter 
dropped ; but when he heard afterward, that she had 
become a hospital nurse, he remembered this conver 
sation. 

In the previous summer of 1843, Dr. Howe had 
spent some time in Great Britain, renewing his 
acquaintance with Dr. George Combe, of Edinburgh, 
to whom both he and his friend Horace Mann were 
warmly attached both being then phrenologists and 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 179 

physiologists of Dr. Combe s school and visiting 
many public establishments with Horace Mann. Con 
cerning this fruitful and brilliant season Mrs. Howe 
says : 

Dr. Howe s bridal journey was made under circumstances 
of peculiar interest. Almost simultaneously with himself, his 
dear friend, Horace Mann, had taken a partner for life, and the 
voyage to Europe was made by the two couples in the same 
steamer. On arriving in England, they occupied for a time the 
same lodgings, and many of their visits to public institutions 
were made in company. I remember among these many 
workhouses, schools, and prisons. The establishment at Pen- 
tonville was then new, and in great favor. The Duke of Rich 
mond and Viscount Morpeth, afterwards Lord Carlisle, were 
of our party on the day of our visiting the prison. On another 
occasion, Mr. Dickens accompanied us to Westminster Bride 
well, where the treadmill was then in full operation. He 
appeared much affected at the sight of the unfortunate inmates, 
and exclaimed in Dr. Howe s hearing, " I cannot blame a 
woman for killing her own child, if she sees that he will 
become such a man as one of these." The narrative of Dickens 
had made the case of Laura Bridgman generally known in Eng 
land and on the Continent. As a consequence of this, on the 
occasion of this visit, Dr. Howe became the object of the most 
gratifying attentions from people foremost in standing and 
desert. Thomas Carlyle called upon him soon after his arrival 
in London, and in the course of conversation expressed his 
amusement at Laura s question about the hours kept by 
horses a Sidney Smith spoke of Dr. Howe as a second Prome- 



1 As early as December, 1832, Dr. Howe was secretary of a 
phrenological society in Boston, where Spurzheim had died. 

2 " Do horses sit up late ?" asked Laura on one occasion ; then, 
perceiving the impropriety of her verb, she said, " I mean do horses 
stand up late ? " 



l8o DR. S. G. HOWE. 

theus. 1 The Duke and Duchess of Sutherland, Lord Hough- 
ton (Monckton Milnes), the Marquis of Lansdowne, Basil 
^Montagu, and the poet Rogers were among the pleasant 
acquaintances made at this epoch. The doctor was often 
called upon to recount the steps by which he had led an im 
prisoned soul from darkness into light. Dr. Howe kept in 
these new surroundings his own quiet dignity and modesty. 
In the highest company, one felt his height above that of other 
men. And this was shown in his judgment of men and of 
things, in his true kindness and geniality, and in his transparent 
simplicity and truthfulness. The presence and praise of people 
of rank neither uplifted nor abashed him. The humanity which 
he respected in himself he regarded equally in others, but the 
fact itself, not its adventitious trappings, claimed his service 
and homage. 

Dr. Howe returned with his wife and child in Sep 
tember, 1844, and resumed his place at South Boston, 
and his laboring oar in the galley of reform. He had 
then a new interest in the prison question abroad, 
and became a more active member of the Prison 
Discipline Society, of which more hereafter. He 
found his friend Mann engaged in a sharp contro 
versy about teaching deaf children to talk, and joined 
heartily with him in the endeavor (in 1844-45) to 
introduce articulation among the deaf pupils main- 



1 Dr. Howe served this incorrigible wit as a peg on which to 
hang a jest. It was when Smith was suffering from his invest 
ment in the repudiated Pennsylvania bonds, that they met at one 
of the breakfasts of Rogers. Smith asked Howe to hold his 
crutches a moment, and then said, " You see they re all alike ; 
here is this pleasant American philanthropist, and he has just taken 
away my only means of support." I suppose Smith could make 
old jokes look " amaist as weel s the new." 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. l8l 

tained by the State in the Asylum at Hartford. In 
Switzerland, Holland, and Germany, the system had 
already been fully tried and established, and in these 
countries Dr. Howe and Mr. Mann had found oppor 
tunities of observing pupils in evei y stage of vocal 
discipline, " from the simultaneous utterance of unin 
telligible sounds to the very politeness and perfection 
of speech." They believed in the system then ; but 
the innovation was strongly resisted at that time and 
long after by those committed to the old method of 
instruction, in which the language of arbitrary signs 
predominated even over the use of the finger alpha 
bet. Unable to convince the American Asylum at 
Hartford of the propriety of at least giving the new 
method a fair trial, Dr. Howe began upon two little 
deaf-mute pupils a series of experiments, which finally 
had some share in leading to the establishment, in 
the neighborhood of Boston, of a small school devoted 
to the articulate method of education, whose teacher 
afterwards became the Principal of the Clark School 
for the Deaf in Northampton. 1 In the interim (twenty- 
two years) between his first efforts to this end and 
their final success, Dr. Howe was instrumental in 
leading many mothers of deaf-mute children to con 
duct their education upon this principle, the children 
receiving the greater part of their education at home. 
" I have seen several of these grown men and 



1 This was Miss Harriet Rogers, whose elder sister, Miss Eliza 
Rogers, had been one of the teachers at the Blind Asylum, and had 
particular charge of Oliver Caswell. Miss H. Rogers opened her 
school at Billerica in 1864, removed it to Chelmsford in 1865, and 
to Northampton in 1867, when the Clarke Institution opened 
there. 



l82 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

women, able to mingle in society, and to take part 
freely in conversation," said Mrs. Howe in 1876. 
Among these might perhaps be included Mrs. Bell, 
the wife of Prof. A. G. Bell. 

In such labors passed away the two years up to the 
summer of 1846, when this second period of Dr. 
Howe s life closed and he began that third period of 
political conflict, which lasted for twenty years. 
Before entering upon the record of that, let me cite 
what Dr. Hedge, who had known him from 1832, and 
the poet, Bryant, whose acquaintance began even 
earlier, said of this devoted philanthropist, at his 
funeral in January, 1876. Dr. Hedge said : 

He was never the hero of his own tale. I have talked with 
him, often and long, and should never have guessed from any 
thing that fell from his lips that he had ever seen Greece, or 
lain in a Prussian prison cell, or penetrated the three-barred 
gate of Laura Bridgman s soul. Another peculiarity of his 
enthusiasm was the liberality, the tolerance that accompanied 
it. And this I believe to be one of the rarest of moral phenom 
ena, the combination of philanthropic enthusiasm and a toler 
ant spirit. Excepting him only, I have never known a philan 
thropist I mean an active, reforming philanthropist who 
was also a fair-minded tolerant man. Many excellent, devoted, 
self-sacrificing men I have known of that vocation, men to 
rejoice in and thank God for ; but they all had this taint of 
intolerance. Not content with strenuous advocacy of their own 
pet charity, not content with active service in that cause, they 
insisted that you should tread their narrow path, should merge 
yourself in their one idea, and reviled all who differed from 
them as to time and method, when even agreed as to ends. 
Advocates of temperance I have known who reeled and stag 
gered and wanted to intoxicate you with their heady politics ; 
champions of abolition I have known who wanted to fasten the 



PHILANTHROPIC DEVOTION. 183 

yoke of their method on your neck ; * and even apostles of non- 
resistance who handled their olive-branch as if it were a war- 
club. Dr. Howe was not of that line. He was that excep 
tional character, a tolerant enthusiast, a fair advocate of a right 
eous cause. 

Mr. Bryant said, among other things : 

His place is in that class with which Virgil, by a 
noble climax, closes his enumeration of the great and 
good who possess the Elysian fields a passage 
which has been thus translated : 2 

Patriots were there in freedom s battle slain, 

Priests, whose long lives were closed without a stain, 

Bards worthy him who breathed the poet s mind, 

Founders of arts that dignify mankind, 

And lovers of our race, whose labors gave 

Their names a memory that defies the grave. 

Howe might have claimed the snowy fillet, under 
the first and the fourth as well as under the last of 
these qualifications. 



1 This was understood and resented in 1876 as applying to Gar 
rison, who lived until 1879.

CHAPTER I. 

THE INSOLENCE OF THE SLAVEHOLDERS. 

DR. HOWE had been bred by his father a Jefferson- 
ian Democrat, like himself. As a boy and youth he 
had learned to dislike the Boston Federalists, and to 
abhor their thinly-disguised schemes for dissolving 
the Union. Consequently he paid less attention than 
he otherwise might have done to the growing politi 
cal power and insolence of the Southern slaveholders, 
which, from 1820, when the Missouri Compromise 
was forced upon the North, was the most alarming 
feature of our politics ; especially from 1828, when a 
combination of Northern Federalists, with the Demo 
crats of South Carolina, Virginia, and the whole 
North, elected Jackson and Calhoun President and 
Vice-President, defeating the able but unskillful 
administration of John Quincy Adams who was 
supported on one side by Henry Clay, and on the 
other by Daniel Webster. This may be taken as the 
beginning of that complete control of the United 
States by the slave-power, which continued with 
slight mitigation till the autumn of 1860, when the 
insolent demands of the slaveholders proved too 
much even for the Democratic demagogues like 
Douglas, of Illinois, and caused a break in the 
dominant party ; in consequence of which Abraham 
Lincoln was chosen President, In these two and 



1 83 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

thirty years, from 1828 to 1860, the oligarchy of slave- 
masters had succeeded in directing all our foreign 
affairs, and much of our domestic legislation. x But 



1 Theodore Parker, speaking in 1855, said : " For the last 46 
years, Freedom has not prevailed in a single instance, while Slavery 
has been eleven times victorious. At first, indeed, there was a 
struggle for the mastery, and it was not certain which would pre 
vail. It was a drawn game until 1812 ; but then Slavery rallied all 
its forces, and conquered. From that to 1855, Slavery has had the 
mastery in our National Councils. Now let us look to the results. 
First, in the acquisition of territory : all that has been acquired has 
been slave territory. We bought Florida, annexed Texas. Slavery 
has been legislated into Utah, into New Mexico. California is a 
slave State not by its Constitution, but by a principle as active ; 
every year the Legislature votes that Slavery shall exist there one 
year more. It exists by sufferance, but exists in its worst form. 
During all that time we have not acquired any free territory but, 
on the contrary, have been very ready to part with some of that we 
had. So, also, has it been in the election of Presidents. Of the 
twelve who have sat in the Presidential chair, eight were born in 
slave States, and but four in the North ; and none has been more 
disgracefully Pro-Slavery than Mr. Pierce, who now occupies the 
position. Five Southern Presidents have been reflected ; no 
Northern President has ever filled the office a second time. Why? 
Because the South is our master. When it takes a Northern man, 
it first rings him, to try how he sounds ; and if he is sufficiently 
hollow, puts him in. How as regards the Judiciary? Thirty-five 
Judges have been appointed to the Supreme Court 19 from the 
South, 1 6 from the North. For 53 years we have had none but 
slaveholding Chief-Justices. The sine qua non for that office is that 
he should be sound upon the subject of Slavery. The South is also 
master in the appointment of diplomatic officers. Of 216 appointed 
to represent this country, 117 have been chosen from the South, 99 
from the North. But even this gives no fair idea, for those chosen 
from the North are generally in favor of Slavery. If one of them 
were known to utter a word against that institution he would be 
quickly recalled." 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 189 

it does not appear that Dr. Howe, though he became 
a " Whig " and an opponent of General Jackson, soon 
after his return from Europe in 1831, took very active 
interest in the agitation commenced by Benjamin 
Lundy and carried on by Garrison, Whittier, and 
their friends during Jackson s and Van Buren s 
administrations. He had many friends among the 
Southern slaveholders ; he was indebted to a Vir 
ginian, Mr. Rives, for his release out of prison in 
1832 ; and, in habits and tastes, he resembled the 
better examples of the Southern character. He 
would have passed anywhere out of New England for 
a Virginian or Kentuckian, having the slender and 
cavalier grace of the young men of those communi 
ties, and the easy, frank, high-spirited, and courteous 
manners that commended the best Virginians to the 
rest of mankind. " There is something about the 
Virginia gentleman," said Richard Dana, x in 1844, 
" which you don t find elsewhere. Plain in their 
dress, simple in their manners, the question whether 
they are doing the right thing, whether this or that 
is genteel or not, never seems to occur to them." It was 
this trait in Dr. Howe which made him a social favor 
ite, so that while his political associates were ostra 
cized in Boston by the rich and toryish families, he 
never was. George Ticknor might declare that 
" Charles Sumner had put himself outside the pale of 
good society," and good Dr. Palfrey might walk up 
Beacon street saying, " Once I was invited to these 
fine houses, but now I never enter them ; " yet Howe, 



1 " Richard Henry Dana," by .Charles Francis Adams, vol. I, p. 
108. 



190 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the friend of Sumner, of Palfrey, of Horace Mann, 
and of Theodore Parker, could never be sent to Cov 
entry ; and he never lost his magic power of drawing 
money from the purses of his rich friends to help on 
his noble chanties. 

There was, in fact, a latent conservatism in Dr. 
Howe s nature which other conservatives saw and 
respected ; he did these extrordinary things, they 
said, not because he had some ax to grind, or some 
point to carry, but because duty compelled him 
noblesse oblige. He was not seen beating the drum or 
blowing the trumpet, but leading the forlorn hope ; 
and when he entered definitely into the anti-slavery 
struggle, as he did in 1846, by accepting a nomina 
tion for Congress against Mr. Winthrop, he said, in 
signifying his acceptance, that he thought he could 
fill a ditch as well as another man. He had long been 
tending toward this position, but the time had till 
then never arrived when he could sacrifice himself for 
a cause, which was what he always stood ready to do. 

The annexation of Texas in 1845 had greatly stirred 
the people of the North, who viewed it as simply a 
measure for the perpetuation of the slave-power, and 
for extending the area of slavery. Dr. Howe opposed 
it, as nearly everybody in Boston did ; but he was 
then very busy with the educational controversies of 
his friend Horace Mann, with the question of prison 
discipline, and with measures for the improvement of 
the insane and the idiotic. He did not, therefore, 
take an active part against the admission of Texas ; 
but so important was this act of the slave-power, as a 
step toward its great object, that it demands a chap 
ter by itself. 



CHAPTER II. 

TEXAS, WEBSTER, AND SLAVERY. 

WHEN the boundary between Louisiana and Mexico 
was fixed by treaty with Spain, during the Presidency 
of Monroe, in 1819, the Rio Grande was not taken 
for a boundary, because Spain was unwilling to con 
cede it; but John Quincy Adams, then Secretary of 
State, favored that as the boundary. This would 
have given us Texas without a struggle, and Texas 
would have become, no doubt, a slave-holding Terri 
tory of the United States. It joined in the revolt 
against Spain, with Mexico, of which it was a 
province; and later, in the administration of Jack 
son, it revolted against Mexico, and secured its inde 
pendence. One reason for this revolt was to protect 
slavery, which Mexico was inclined to abolish; and 
the result of Texan independence was to fasten 
slavery upon that broad land, which Jackson had 
sought to purchase, and which Calhoun and the lead 
ing slaveholders had determined to annex to the 
United States. 1 Their project was not favored by 

1 Benjamin Lund) , the pioneer Abolitionist, had warned the 
country in 1836-37 against this plot of the slaveholders to annex 
Texas, and had several times visited that State, while it was a part 
of Mexico, or in revolt against Mexico, to explore its condition, 
and do what he could for the abolition of slavery there. This is 
one of the most interesting portions of Lundy s life. See Thomas 
Earle s " Life of Benjamin Lundy " and the four-volume " Memoir

Van Buren, friendly as he was to the slave-power; 
but it was revived under the Presidency of John 
Tyler, whose Secretary of State was Daniel Webster. 
One reason for forcing Webster out of Tyler s Cabinet 
was to evade his opposition to the Texas scheme; 
this was managed by Henry A. Wise, of Virginia, 
then a member of Congress, who finally succeeded in 
getting Calhoun appointed Secretary of State by 
Tyler, in the year 1844. The effect of these plots on 
Webster has been thus described by his friend, 
George Ticknor: l 

Mr. Webster said that one day, in 1844, when he was sit 
ting with Mr. Upshur, who was then Secretary of State, Mr. 
Upshur told him that " he would not continue in office a fort 
night if he had not a particular object to accomplish." Mr. 
Webster said, " I felt Texas go through me," and in two days 
he knew all about it. Texas had anxiously desired the protec 
tion of the United States against a threatened invasion from 
Mexico, and had persuaded our Government to agree to give 
such protection if that invasion should take place. " We might, 
therefore," Mr. Webster said, " be in a war with Mexico at any 
time ; " and he did not doubt the Administration would be will 
ing to have such a war. He then went on and described the 
troubles that would follow any great enlargement of our terri 
tory in the Southern direction. He thought it would endanger 
the Union. He became very much excited ; he walked up and

pp. 230-235. Mr. Curtis must also have known, but has suppressed 
the facts about Webster s connection with the Anti-Texas Conven 
tion of January, 1845, which he had desired to call, and for which 
Webster wrote the earnest anti-slavery "address." Mr. C. F. 
Adams has given Mr. S. C. Phillips version of this affair in his

down the room fast and uneasily. He said he had not been 
able to sleep at night, and that he could think of little else in 
the day. He had written two editorial articles in the National 
Intelligencer, and with great difficulty had pursuaded Mr. Gales 
to insert them, and to take full ground against any annexation 
of Texas. At his request also, Mr. Winthrop had introduced a 
resolution on the subject in the House of Representatives ; and 
as he passed through New York he had engaged Mr. Charles 
King 2 to take the same ground, and had left with him more than 
one article to be published in the newspaper of which Mr. King 
was the editor. His object, he said, was to rouse the whole 
North on the subject. An election was about to take place in 
Connecticut, and he said, if it was in his power, he would make 
the Texas question an element in its decision, " If I had the 
means I would send men to Connecticut, who should run 
through the State from side to side, with their arms stretched 
out, crying, Texas, Texas," and he suited the action to the 
word in the most fervent and impressive manner. Mr. Web 
ster s object also was to get up public meetings in Boston and 
elsewhere, and, if possible, to have a convention of all Massa 
chusetts to protest against the annexation of Texas. Mr. Brim 
mer, then Mayor of Boston, endeavored to promote this with all 
his power. Mr. Charles G. Loring and a few other persons 
assisted him ; but persons of mark and note in the Whig party 
with the Atlas newspaper for their organ, earnestly opposed it. 
About this time, April, 1844, I dined with Mr. Webster at the 



1 Robert C. Winthrop, then a member of Congress from Boston 
(against whom, in 1846, Dr. Howe was nominated, because Mr. 
Winthrop s course on the slavery question was not satisfactory to 
the "Conscience Whigs," of whom S. C. Phillips, C. F. Adams, 
Dr. Howe, F. W. Bird, etc. were the leaders), Abbott Lawrence, 
Nathan Appleton, etc., were called " Cotton Whigs," because their 
interests were bound up with the cotton manufacture.

table of Colonel Thomas H. Perkins; Mr. N. Appleton, 1 Mr. 
Edmund Dwight, and several other of the principal Whigs of 
Boston were there. They expressed the opinion that Texas 
would never be annexed. Mr. Webster said, very strongly, that 
Texas would be annexed if a great effort were not made at the 
North to prevent it, and suggested a public meeting, a conven 
tion of the State, etc. " Mind," said he, striking his hand on 
the table, " I do not say that Texas will be annexed within a 
year, but I do say I think I see how it can be done, and I have 
no reason to suppose that the Administration sees it less 
clearly than I do." A slight laugh followed, expressing an 
incredulity not quite respectful, and the conversation was 
changed. Mr. Webster soon went away and one of the gentle 
men said, " He ought to come out for Clay." 2 

At this time there was ill-feeling in Boston against 
Webster because he had clung to the weak and 
profligate administration of Tyler, a year after it had 
broken faith with its supporters, led by Clay. No 
doubt jealousy of Clay was one reason for this 
course on Webster s part. It threw power tempo-

George Bancroft, and the particular friend both of Webster and of 
Horace Mann, whose labors in the cause of education he seconded 
with liberal gifts of money. The Atlas supported Clay for Presi 
dent, the Advertiser Webster first and Clay afterward. 

2 Fie did " come out for Clay" at Baltimore the day after the 
National Convention had nominated his rival for the Presidency, 
May 2,1844. Webster then said, " There is no question now 
before the country of public policy upon which there is any differ 
ence between that great leader of the Whig party and myself." It 
soon appeared, however, that Clay favored annexation at some 
future time ; and this fact defeated him, by the votes of the " Lib 
erty party" in New York. It almost caused a Whig secession in 
Massachusetts also.

rarily into the hands of Abbott Lawrence, and other 
opponents of Webster among the Massachusetts 
Whigs ; and it also drew him a little more towards 
the "Conscience Whigs," led by J. O. Adams, his 
son, C. F. Adams, Stephen C. Phillips, Charles 
Allen, of Worcester, and other men of note. In a 
speech made in Boston, October 5, 1844, John Quincy 
Adams, that " old man eloquent," went a step beyond 
Webster, and said to the young men of Boston : 
" Your trial is approaching. The spirit of freedom 
and the spirit of slavery are drawing together for the 
deadly conflict of arms. The annexation of Texas is 
the blast of a trumpet for a foreign, civil, servile, and 
Indian war, of which the Government of your country, 
fallen into faithless hands, has already thrice given 
the signal first by a shameless treaty, rejected by a 
virtuous Senate l and again by the glaive of defi 
ance, hurled by the apostle of nullification a at the 
avowed policy of the British Empire peacefully to 
promote the extinction of slavery throughout the 
world." But Webster himself was then an opponent of 
slavery, and therefore the next step of his in this Texas 
affair was but natural, and would have done Webster 
great honor, could he have had the courage to follow 
it up. The time is the winter of 1844-45, J ust after

Texas was annexed by joint resolution of Congress a very 
unconstitutional procedure.

official utterances on the slave-trade, and announced that the 
United States protected slavery.

the defeat of Clay at the November election, and the 
narrator is Stephen C. Phillips, of Salem, a former 
Congressman from the Essex district. I quote from 
the diary of 1850 in Adams s " Life of Dana," to whom 
Mr. Phillips told the story : 

Webster had left Tyler s cabinet, and was out of office, and 
rather out of favor with the Whig leaders in the State for 
having stayed so long by Tyler, but, without doubt, supported 
by the people. 1 Mr. Phillips had been his warm and somewhat 
confidential friend. He found Webster fully and deeply inter 
ested in the movement against annexation. Webster advised 
that a convention be called at Faneuil Hall, and an address to 
the people prepared, as the first step towards rousing the 
North. Mr. Phillips reminded him that it was an important 
movement, on which the political fate of themselves and the 
party might hang, and that they must be assured of his sup 
port. He never will forget Webster s reply: " If there is any 
influence in the name of Daniel Webster, as some persons have 
said, you shall have it all ! By this head and this heart " (suit 
ing the action to the word), "if there is any strength in this 
old arm, 2 it is all devoted to your cause." Mr. Phillips then 



1 He was, in fact, chosen Senator this same winter by the State 
Legislature in the place of Rufus Choate, who had resigned; and 
there was no serious opposition to him in that body. Parker says, 
in his funeral sermon on Webster (1852): " He prepared some por 
tions of the address of the Massachusetts Anti-Texas Convention in 
1845; but as some of the leading Whigs of the North opposed 
that meeting, and favored annexation, he did not appear at the 
convention, but went off to New York." This fact Parker had 
from C. F. Adams, I suppose. 

a Webster was at this time nearly 63 years old; he was born 
Jan. 18, 1782, and died Oct. 24, 1852. He had just been through 
the campaign of 1844, making speeches for Clay in Massachusetts, 
New York, and Pennsylvania, and, in fact, was strong and active, 
as the next six years of his life showed. The above conversation 
probably occurred at the Tremont House, Boston.

wrote the call for the convention, which Mr. Webster revised 
and approved, and it was taken round for signatures. Then 
they found that a certain number of leading Whigs, repre 
sented by Abbott Lawrence and Nathan Appleton (since called 
the " Cotton W T higs ") were indifferent to the subject, and 
averse to any action. Their general motives were well known. 
With some of them there was an additional special motive of 
unwillingness to cooperate with Webster in a movement that 
might redound to his credit. Mr. Lawrence, in giving his final 
refusal, said, " No, sir; we will not help Daniel Webster to 
right himself by this Texas movement." At the same time 
Mr. Webster s New York friends, hearing of the movement, 
became alarmed, and wrote to Webster, begging him not to 
commit himself and the Whig party of New England to it ; 
that it would alienate the South, and seal the alliance between 
the South and the Northern Democracy ; that the leading 
Whigs of Boston would not stand by him, and that there was 
not sufficient anti-Texas feeling in the North to be the basis of 
his political action. These letters, and the coldness of the 
Cotton Whigs, evidently deterred Mr. Webster, and when he 
was asked to sign the call for the convention (January, 1845), 
he held back. Judge Allen, 1 with his characteristic intrepidity, 
put Webster s name to it, and told him it should be published, 
and he might take it back if he dared. It was thus only that 
Webster s name appeared. As the time drew near for the 
convention, they found Mr. Webster more and more backward. 
They got him to work on the address on Monday, two days

and one of the delegates to the Whig Convention of 1848, who 
refused to support the nomination of General Taylor for President. 
Charles Allen was an excellent lawyer, a firm and upright judge, 
a great favorite with Webster, and very popular in his district. He 
joined in the nomination of Van Buren and Adams as the " Free- 
Soil" candidates, and this made certain the election of General 
Taylor.

before the convention. 1 It was written in Webster s office, he 
dictating and Mr. Phillips and Judge Allen writing ; he divided 
the objections into heads, and took them up separately, leaving 
slavery to the last. When he came to this head, he paused 
and became very solemn, and told them frankly he did not 
know what to do. He stated the position of the question, the 
state of parties, the division among the Whigs, etc., and went 
no farther. All they could get from him was a promise to con 
sider it, and to meet them Tuesday afternoon. At that time 
they received a note from him, saying that a case in which he 
was engaged obliged him to be in New York the next day 
that he left that afternoon that the business was in excellent 
hands, which could manage far better than he could ; he wished 
them Godspeed, etc. 

This account by Mr. Dana is not wholly correct. 
The manuscript of the address, which is mainly as it 
left Mr. Webster s hands, and was so printed, is 
partly in Mr. Webster s handwriting, and wholly of 
his composition. I have seen the manuscript and 
compared it, at various points, with the copy printed 
in February, 1845. It may be that a few passages 
here and there never received Mr. Webster s final 
revision; but most of it shows the marks of great 
care in its preparation, and equally of Webster s 
simple but ponderous style. As it has never been 
publicly acknowledged as his, I here give it almost 
in full, to show where he stood in 1844-45 : 



1 The convention was called, and met Wednesday, Jan. 29, 1845; 
its president was John M. Williams, an old judge, and among its 
secretaries were George T. Curtis and John G. Whittier. Among 
the delegates was W. L. Garrison, whose disunion resolutions were 
voted down, although he had many supporters. See " Memoir of 
Garrison," vol. Ill, p. 136. Webster s name headed the signers of 
the call from Plymouth County, and George Ticknor also signed. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 199 

FROM WEBSTER S ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE 
UNITED STATES. 

(January 29, 1845.) 

It is a fundamental maxim of all American Constitutions, 
that the people are the only rightful source of political power ; 
that government is a delegated and limited trust ; that all 
authority not conferred is reserved ; and that, in fact, there are 
grave questions, lying deeper than the organized forms of gov 
ernment, and over which government, in none of its branches, 
has just control. When, in the course of events, a question of 
this kind arises, it is fit to be examined, and must be examined, 
by the people themselves, and considered and decided by an 
enlightened and conscientious exercise of public judgment, and 
a full and determined expression of the public will. 

It is, perhaps, a matter of necessity, that those to whom 
power is confided, under a free constitution, must be left, in 
ordinary cases, to be judges themselves of the limits imposed 
on their own authority, subject to such checks and balances as 
the framers of government may have provided. But in times 
of great excitement, of political party heat, in times when 
men s passions strengthen dangerously the natural tendency 
of all power to enlarge its limits by construction and infer 
ence, by plausible arguments and bad precedents; in such 
times it behooves the great constituent body to put forth its 
own power of investigation and decision, and to judge for 
itself, whether its agents are about to transcend their authority, 
and abuse their trust. 

Such an inquiry is presented to the people of the United 
States, by the project broached last year, and now zealously 
and hotly pursued, of annexing Texas to the United States. 
This question transcends all the bounds of ordinary political 
topics. It is not a question how the United States shall be 
governed, but what shall hereafter constitute the United 
States ; it is not a question as to what system of policy shall 
prevail in this country, but what the country itself shall be. 



200 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

It is a question which touches the identity of the Republic. 
The inquiry is, whether we shall remain as we have been since 
1789, or whether we shall now join another people to us, and 
mix, not only our interests, hopes, and prospects, but our very 
being, with another, and a foreign State. This fearful proposi 
tion must awaken, and we are glad to know does awaken, a 
deep and intense feeling throughout a great part of the coun 
try. It touches reflecting minds to the very quick, because it 
appears to them to strike at foundations, to endanger first 
principles, and to menace, in a manner, well calculated to 
excite alarm and terror, the stability of our political institu 
tions. 

We regard the scheme of annexing Texas to the United 
States, as being : 

1. A plain violation of the Constitution. 

2. As calculated and designed, by the open declaration of 
its friends, to uphold the interests of slavery, extend its influ 
ence, and secure its permanent duration. 

I. There is no constitutional power in any branch of the 
Government, or all the branches of the Government, to annex 
a foreign State to the Union. 

The successful termination of the Revolutionary War, left 
the old thirteen States free and independent, although united 
in a common confederacy. Some of these States possessed a 
large tract of territory, lying within the limits of their respec 
tive charters from the Crown of England, not as yet cultivated 
or settled. Before the adoption of the present Constitution, it 
is well known these States had made extensive grants of this 
territory to the United States, with the main original purpose 
of disposing of the same for the payment of the debt of the 
Revolution. The cession of Virginia, to whom much the largest 
portion of this territory belonged, being all the land within her 
original charter, was made in 1784; and it was the express 
condition of that grant, that the ceded territory should be laid 
out and formed into States, each to be of suitable extent, not 
less than a hundred nor more than one hundred and fifty miles 
square. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 2OI 

At the adoption of the present Constitution these territories 
belonged to the United States, and the Government of the 
United States was bound to make provision for their admission 
into the Union, as States, so soon as they should become prop 
erly settled and peopled for that purpose. For the govern 
ment of this territory the memorable ordinance of July, 1787, 
was passed, and constituted the public law of the country un 
til the present Constitution was adopted. It became then a 
part of the duty of the framers of that instrument to make 
provision suitable to the subject. The Constitution declares, 
therefore, " that Congress shall have power to dispose of, and 
make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory 
of the United States." This gave the authority of governing 
the territory, as territory, while it remained such. And in the 
same article it is provided as follows : 

Article 4, Sec. 3. " New States may be admitted by the Con 
gress into this Union ; but no new State shall be formed or erected 
within the jurisdiction of any other State, nor any State be formed 
by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without 
the consent of the Legislature of the States concerned, as well as 
of the Congress." 

It is quite impossible to read this clear and exact provision, 
without seeing that Congress had in view two forms in which 
new States might be created and admitted into the Union. 
ist, They might be created out of the territory which the 
United States possessed, and in regard to which the original 
stipulation was, that it should be formed into States in due 
time, and those States admitted into the Union. 2d, New 
States might be formed by the division of an existing State, or 
by the junction of two or more States, or parts of States ; but 
in this case the consent of the Legislature of the States con 
cerned was made necessary, as well as that of Congress. It 
is plain and manifest that in all this there is not the slightest 
view towards any future acquisition of territory. 

A treaty for the annexation of Texas to the United States, 
was negotiated last year (1844), between the President of the 



2O2 DR. S. G HOWE. 

United States, and the Texan Government, and laid before the 
Senate, for its constitutional ratification, at the last session of 
Congress. It was sent, like any other treaty, and required, of 
course, the concurrence of the same proportion of Senators as 
other treaties require, to wit, two-thirds of all present. A con 
fidence, very ill-founded, as events have shown, has been already 
expressed, and signified to Texas, that the concurrence of that 
number of Senators was certain. After many weeks of debate, 
the treaty was rejected by a vote of thirty-five to sixteen it 
thus appearing that not only had two-thirds of the Senators 
not voted for it, but that two-thirds had voted against it. Here 
was supposed to be an end of the treaty, but no sooner was 
Congress assembled, at its present session, than a joint reso 
lution was introduced, declaring that this treaty, the ratifica 
tion of which had thus been decisively refused by the Senate, 
the only body which could constitutionally give it ratification, 
should, nevertheless, become the supreme law of the land. 
This resolution is now pending, modified in its form, but pro 
viding substantially for the same object ; it has already passed 
the House of Representatives, and should it pass both Houses, 
then an attempt will have been made and will have succeeded, 
so far as the forms of law are concerned, to ratify a treaty by 
mere majorities of both Houses, instead of the constitutional 
authority of the Senate. 

We know not on what occasion bad objects have been more 
emphatically pursued by bad means, or in which the reckless 
ness of the original purpose has been followed up by grosser 
disregard of all constitutional and just restraint. If this prece 
dent prevail, the treaty-making power, as established by the 
Constitution, is at an end. It will be no longer for the Senate, 
the great conservative and most permanent body of the govern 
ment, to act deliberately and gravely on treaties with foreign 
States, to judge of them in the light of its own wisdom, and 
under the responsibility of its own high character, and to grant 
its ratification, if the constitutional number of Senators present 
concur. The ratification of treaties will become the business 
of party majorities, temporary majorities, it may be bare major- 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 203 

ities, of the two Houses, acting under the influences, and liable 
to all the errors, which may occasionally affect the proceedings 
of such numerous assemblies. 

II. "Annexation is designed and calculated, by the open 
declaration of its friends, to uphold the interests of slavery, 
extend its influence, and secure its permanent duration." 

The frankness of this avowal supersedes the necessity of any 
attempt to strip off disguises, or to bring hidden and concealed 
motives, into the light. There is no disguise, the motives are 
all confessed. They are boldly avowed to the country and the 
v/orld ; and the question is therefore open, visible, naked, and in 
its true character, before the American people. 

When the treaty was sent to the Senate, it was accompan 
ied by an elaborate message from the President, setting forth 
its character and objects. It was accompanied by parts, 
though meagre and scanty parts, of the correspondence which 
had preceded its conclusion. Repeated and persevering calls 
of the Senate produced, at subsequent periods, other and much 
more important parts of that correspondence. Since the rejec 
tion of the treaty, the Secretary of State has continued to 
address our public Ministers abroad upon the subject ; and the 
country has now before it a mass of correspondence, between 
the Government in Washington and its diplomatic agents 
abroad, and between these agents and the Governments of Mex 
ico and Texas. How far that correspondence, taken together^ 
Exhibits ability, dignity, self-respect, and respect for the rights 
of others ; how far its general character, reflects honor and 
credit on the Government of this country, we willingly abstain 
from undertaking to show. We refer to it now only as con 
taining those open confessions and avowals, of which we have 
already spoken, of the purpose with which annexation has been 
proposed, and is now pursued with such unwearied persever 
ance. 

Here, then, is a spectacle, in our judgment, a sad spectacle, 
not only for the contemplation of our own country, but for 
that of the whole civilized world. These advocates of annex 
ation insist that not only is slavery an institution desirable in 



234 DR&lt; S G - HOWE. 

itself, fit to be retained, and necessary to be maintained as a 
blessing to man, but they seem to insist, also, that a leading 
object of the Constitution of the United States was to guard 
it, defend it, and assure its perpetual duration. Let the Con 
stitution of the country be vindicated from this imputation ; 
let its objects and its purposes, it ends and its means, be 
clearly stated, and then no lover of human liberty will feel 
disposed to turn his back upon it with disrespect. . . . 

The States in which involuntary servitude existed were not 
called upon to abolish servitude before they could be admit 
ted into the Union ; nor, on the other hand, was the proposed 
government to be called upon to fortify the laws of the States, 
creating or establishing this involuntary servitude, by any in 
terposition of its authority, or any guaranty or assurance 
whatever. It pledged itself, indeed, to exercise its authority to 
suppress insurrections, but this provision was as applicable to 
one State as another. There is reason, however, to believe 
that at that time there existed amongst the citizens of the 
country generally, even amongst those of the slave-holding 
States themselves, a belief that slavery was on the wane ; that 
new views of political economy and of general interest would 
lead to the supplying of its place by free labor ; and it may be 
added, with entire truth, that the successful termination of the 
war which had been waged for liberty and the rights of man 
had impressed a general expectation that the political libera 
tion of the country from foreign dominion would tend to pro 
duce dispositions favorable to a change of the relation between 
the black and the white races ; a change which, commencing 
with mitigation, and proceeding gradually and with safety from 
step to step, might eventually terminate in a total abolition of 
slavery. 

Soon after the adoption of the Constitution, it was declared 
by George Washington to be " among his first wishes to see 
some plan adopted by which slavery might be abolished by 
law " ; and in various forms, in public and private communica 
tions, he avowed his anxious desire that " a spirit of humanity," 
prompting to " the emancipation of the slave," " might diffuse 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 205 

itself generally into the minds of the people ; " and he gave the 
assurance that " so far as his own suffrage could go," his influ 
ence would not be wanting to accomplish this result. By his 
last will and testament he provided that " all his slaves should 
receive their freedom," and, in terms significant of the solicitude 
he felt upon the subject, he " most pointedly and most solemnly 
enjoined upon his executors to see that the clause respecting 
the slaves, and every part thereof, be religiously fulfilled, with 
out evasion, neglect, or delay." No language can be more ex 
plicit, more emphatic, or more solemn, than that in which 
Thomas Jefferson, from the beginning to the end of his life, 
unformly declared his opposition to slavery. " I tremble for 
my country," said he, " when I reflect that God is just that 
his justice cannot sleep forever." " The Almighty has no at 
tribute which can take side with us in such a contest." In 
reference to the state of public feeling, as influenced by the 
Revolution, he said, " I think a change already perceptible since 
the origin of the Revolution ; " and to show his own view of 
the proper influence of the spirit of the Revolution on slavery, 
he proposed the searching question : " Who can endure toil, 
famine, stripes, imprisonment, and death itself, in vindication 
of his own liberty, and the next moment be deaf to all those 
motives whose power supported him through his trial, and in 
flict on his fellow-men a bondage, one hour of which is fraught 
with more misery than ages of that which he rose in rebellion 
to oppose ? " " We must wait," he added, " with patience, the 
workings of the overruling Providence, and hope that that is 
preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren. 
When the measure of their tears shall be full when their tears 
shall have involved Heaven itself in darkness, doubtless a God 
of justice will awaken to their distress, and by diffusing light 
and liberality among their oppressors, or at length, by his ex 
terminating thunder, manifest his attention to things of this 
world, and that they be not left to the guidance of blind 
fatality ! " Towards the close of his life Mr. Jefferson made a 
renewed and final declaration of his opinion by writing thus to 
a friend : " My sentiments on the subject of the slavery of 



206 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

negroes have long since been in possession of the public, and 
time has only served to give them stronger root. The love of 
justice and the love of country plead equally the cause of these 
people ; and it is a moral reproach to us that they should have 
pleaded it so long in vain, and should have produced not a 
single effort nay, I fear, not much serious willingness, to 
relieve them and ourselves from our present condition of 
moral and political reprobation." 

It is manifest, then, that neither any specific provision of the 
Constitution nor anything to be gathered from its general 
intent, or any sentiment or opinion in the minds of those who 
framed it, and who were among the greatest men of the coun 
try at the time, can warrant the belief that more was expected 
of the Constitution, and the Government to be established 
under it, than the prevention of the further importation of 
slaves from Africa, leaving the States where it already existed 
to deal with it as an affair of their own ; and it is equally man 
ifest that the hopes of the wise and the good, the most ardent 
wishes of the most influential and patriotic men in the country, 
looked not to the further increase and extension of slavery, but 
to its gradual abolition ; and the highest intellects of the coun 
try were exercised in the contemplation of means by which that 
abolition might be best effected. As significant of the fact 
that the framers of the Constitution considered domestic 
slavery a condition of things which would be of temporary 
duration, we ask your attention to this circumstance. While 
the Constitution contains provisions adapted to the actual con 
dition of the Southern States, and to the servitude which 
existed there, it does not once recognize slavery in terms. 
The word slave is not to be found in that document. That 
the omission is not accidental would be clearly and necessarily 
inferred from the careful circumlocution by which this class of 
persons is provided for, without being named. 



The theory that the Constitution u&lt;as made for the preserva 
tion, encouragement , and expansion of slavery ; that every new 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 207 

acquisition which freedom should make on her own soil, 
through the blessings of heaven iipon toil and enterprise, 
should be counterbalanced by the incorporation into the body 
politic of an equal portion of exotic slavery; and that the 
decline of the latter, through the operation of beneficent causes, 
kindly placed beyond the control of man, should be retarded by 
subjecting to its desolating influence new regions, acquired by 
purchase, or fraud, or force, dates its discovery from a period 
long subsequent to the establishment of the Government. 

We read on the first page of the Constitution, the words, 
" To establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for 
the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure 
the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity." 
These are the declared objects for which the Government was 
ordained. Are any of these ends promoted by the extension of 
slavery ? We ask the advocates of the extension of slavery, 
which of the great objects of the Union they expect to pro 
mote by the success of their undertaking ? That the cause of 
justice is not advanced, by the subjugation of one portion of the 
human race to the despotic power and absolute will of another 
portion is a proposition, in the abstract, so absolutely true, that 
its denial, in few and remarkable instances, is regarded by the 
common understanding of mankind as the melancholy proof of 
a disordered intellect. 

. . . If, then, justice condemns this measure of the 
administration, as being at war with all its purposes, we shall 
look in vain, through this instrumentality, for the attainment 
of any constitutional object whatever. We will not ask, lest 
the inquiry should seem to be made in derision, if "the bles 
sings of liberty " are to be secured by the enlargement of the 
limits of slavery, and the augmentation of its power. That 
" domestic tranquility " will not be promoted by the increased 
strength of its disturbing cause ; and that the safety of a 
nation in war will not be increased by the presence of a 
domestic enemy which holds motionless the arm that would be 
raised for its defence, are propositions admitting neither argu 
ment nor denial. 



208 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Will the South disregard all remonstance, and press on to 
its consummation this deed of atrocious wrong ? When the 
Constitution was framed, we have seen that there was harmony 
of sentiment among intelligent men in all sections of the coun 
try respecting the injurious influences of slavery. Nowhere do 
we find its evils more faithfully portrayed than in the speeches 
and writings of eminent men belonging to the slave-holding 
States in the early period of our history. The opinions they 
expressed of slavery have been verified at each step in the 
progress of the nation. Withering every interest it touches ; 
paralyzing the strength of States yet in their youth ; more deso 
lating than blight or mildew to the soil that sustains it ; in all 
ages and countries, the wrong done to the nature of man, when 
he is subject to involuntary servitude, is avenged by the wide 
spread ruin his reluctant service repays. For this unhappy 
condition of society the remedy sought to be applied can only 
aggravate the mischief it would remove. To eradicate the evil, 
not to disseminate it, is the dictate both of wisdom and philan 
thropy. 

But, whatever maybe the policy of the Southern States upon 
the question of annexation, surely the appeal to the people of the 
free States will not be made in vain. Not only the highest 
obligations of duty bind them to oppose, with all their energies, 
the extension of a vast moral, political, and social evil, but it is 
clear that no other course is consistent with mere self-preser 
vation. Their consent is demanded to the introduction into this 
Union of slave States, to be formed out of foreign territory. 
And for what end is this demand made ? The object is undis 
guised. The purpose is single. // is to control their policy, to 
make the interests of free labor subservient to the necessities of 
an artificial, unthrifty, unnatural and unjust condition of 
society. It is to force industry out of the paths which lead to 
abundance and prosperity, because those paths are open only to 
the feet of free men. During the whole existence of the 
General Government, hitherto, Southern principles have had an 
almost unbroken sway. This has been felt in ruinous changes 
of public policy, seemingly capricious, but really intended, in 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 209 

all its changes, to discourage the industry of the free States, 
derange their business, and depress t/iein to the level of com 
munities in which all labor is held to be degrading, except 
that which is extorted from unwilling hands, by the lash of 
usurped autJiority.^ 

It has been perceived that the night of this iron dominion 
was passing away. The energies of free men, put forth in sub 
mission to the laws of Providence, have overcome all obsta 
cles, and opened the way for the growth, prosperity, and power 
of the free States. No sooner is that power beginning to be 
felt in the protection it extends to the interests which created 
it, than a gigantic effort is made to reduce it again and forever 
to subjection. The free States are called upon to assist 
in forging the chains that are to bind them. By the 
help of craven and treacherous representatives of these 
States, the foul deed, if done at all, must be accomplished. 
But that representative of a non-slave- holding State, who 
shall be so lost to all his obligations to earth and heaven, as 
to yield his consent to a measure pernicious to one, and offen 
sive to the other, will live, while he lives, the object of scorn 
and loathing to all lovers of liberty and of man ; and when 
he shall have perished from the earth, tJie history of his 
iniquitous act will be the lasting memorial of his infamy. 

When, therefore, Dr. Howe, Charles Sumner, and 
the other Conscience Whigs of Boston, made oppo 
sition to Southern slavery the main article in their 
political creed, as they did in 1845-48, they had 
Daniel Webster for their leader and the spokesman 



1 Webster s part in the preliminaries of the Fanueil Hall Con 
vention was no secret, and Charles Sumner, writing to a warm 
friend of Webster, Judge Story, said (Feb. 5, 1845): "You will 
read Mr. Webster s address to the people of the United States, 
promulgated by the Anti-Texas Convention. It is an able paper, 
which will lift our public sentiment to a new platform of Anti- 
Slavery." 



2IO DR. S. G. HOWE. 

of their opinions. 1 It is true that he had not the cour 
age of his opinions, but the passages cited above, chiefly 
from his pen and from his great logical understand 
ing, were and had been his opinions from the time he 
began to reflect on slavery until the fatal year 1850, 
when he deserted his convictions and incurred his own 
fearful sentence on such recreancy. 



1 Charles Sumner up to 1845 had abstained from active politics, 
but he now threw in his lot with the " Conscience Whigs," against 
the aggressions of the slavemasters. In a speech made at Faneuil 
Hall November 6, 1850, Sumner said : " The first political conven 
tion which I ever attended was in the spring of 1845 against the 
annexation of Texas. I was then a silent and passive Whig. I had 
never held political office, nor been a candidate for any. No ques 
tion ever before drew me to any active political exertion. The 
strife of politics seemed to me ignoble." From that moment the 
career of Sumner was determined; he was to increase and Webster 
was to decrease. See " Charles Sumner s Works," vol. II. p.p. 
422-23. Although he says " the spring of 1845 " he means Janu 
ary 29, in that year, the very meeting which Webster had pro 
moted and run away from. At this time, Sumner was not quite 34 ; 
Howe was 44. 



CHAPTER III. 

THE MEXICAN WAR AND PRISON DISCIPLINE. 

IN the summer of 1845, Charles Sumner had given 
his great peace oration, " The True Grandeur of 
Nations " before the city authorities of Boston, and 
Dr. Howe had supported the extreme opinions there 
set forth. The Mexican War was already in anticipation, 
and the abstract peace principles of Sumner and his 
friends were in part their protest against that com 
ing war. Robert C. Winthrop, then a member of 
Congress from Boston, had on the same day (July 4, 
1845) given his famous toast, " Our Country However 
Bounded," and had thus laid the foundation for his 
future vote in favor of the Mexican war, which led to 



1 Robert Charles Winthrop, born in Boston in 1807, graduated at 
Harvard University in 1827, is a descendant of John Winthrop, the 
first Governor of Massachusetts, and from his first appearance in 
public life, about 1835, was a political leader among men of his 
own age, until the dissolution of the Whig party in 1854. He then 
ceased to have any political eminence, and has since devoted him 
self to history and biography. He had not favored the anti-Texas 
agitation of Webster and Ticknor in 1844, nor that of Stephen C. 
Phi lips and Judge Allen in 1844-45; and in 1846 he was the leader of 
the "Cotton Whigs" in the State convention at Faneuil Hall, 
where Sumner, Phillips, Allen, George Tyler Bigelow, Charles 
Theodore Russell and other " Conscience Whigs" maintained the 
doctrine of Webster s Address. 

(211) 



212 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the refusal of Sumner, Howe, Andrew, and other 
"Conscience Whigs " to support Mr. Winthrop s re 
election to Congress. From July, 1845, then, Howe 
was an opponent of the Mexican war, of slavery, and 
particularly of the rendition of fugitive slaves. He 
joined also with Sumner and Horace Mann in 1845-46 
in an attempt to do justice to the Philadelphia system 
of separate imprisonment, in the meetings of the 
Boston Prison Discipline Society, of which Dr. Way- 
land, of Brown University, had been President, and of 
which Louis Dwight was Secretary, and Samuel A. 
Eliot 1 of Boston, Treasurer. This led to a heated 
and protracted controversy, carried on, as such things 
always are in Boston, with much personal bitterness. 
It brought Dr. Howe forward in a new capacity, as a 
prison reformer, and as a speaker at public meetings. 
His opposition to the Mexican war, like his interest 
in the prison question, was more plilanthropic than 
political ; but both had political consequences of 
some importance. As a sample of his direct and 
manly eloquence, a passage from one of his speeches 
in opposition to Messrs. Dwight and Eliot, who 
favored the " Auburn system " of imprisonment, may 
here be quoted. It is also valuable for its personal 
reminiscenes, something in which Dr. Howe, like the 



1 Samuel Atkins Eliot was the father of President Eliot, of Har 
vard University, and the brother-in-law of George Ticknor. He 
represented Boston in Congress in 1850-51 and was the only Mas 
sachusetts member who voted for Mason s (and Webster s) Fugi 
tive Slave Bill. He felt keenly the difference of opinion between 
himself and Dr. Howe, Horace Mann, etc., on the prison question; 
and the animosity thus excited had something to do, it is said, 
with his hostility to Sumner on more important issues. Upon such 
small hinges do great matters turn, especially in Boston.

more of the future than the past. 

DR. HOWE ON PRISON LIFE. 

Sir, what is it that constitutes men social beings? Is it sleep 
ing, packed away in separate cells, as near, but yet as separate 
and still, as the dead in a well-filled graveyard ? Is it march 
ing in lock-step, in silence ? Is it sitting side by side in the 
shop, at the table, and in the chapel, but without a sign of rec 
ognition or sympathy ? No, sir, it is through the sense of hear 
ing that men most communicate it is speech, and not sight, 
that makes men social beings. Who so lonely, who so unso- 
cial,who so completely a hermit in the world,as your uninstructed 
deaf-and-dumb man ? Before you give him a language, a sys 
tem of signs, he is not only the loneliest man in the world, but 
generally a brutal, wretched, and miserable one. Now, sir, 
the (Auburn) Congregate System, as recommended by this so 
ciety, strives to cut off all this communication by speech and by 
sound. It succeeds in doing so, or it does not succeed. If 
it succeeds, then it is really more solitary than the separate 
system, which makes special provision for communication. If 
it does not succeed, it holds up a false appearance to the 
world, and it injures the prisoners, by placing them in antag 
onism with rules which they break and learn to despise. 

But, let me now describe the Philadelphia prison A pris 
oner, when he enters, is led blindfolded to his cell, or to his 
room, as it may be called, which is about twelve feet long 
by eight feet wide, and sixteen feet high in the center; this 
room has a board floor, it is well ventilated, and is warmed 
by an iron pipe, in which is hot water; it has his loom, or 
shoe bench ; his table, his bed, a chair or two, a book shelf, 
etc. There is also a plentiful supply of fresh water, so that 
he has no occasion to go out for anything. It will be rec 
ollected that the reverend gentleman (Mr. Dwight) said 
the cells were like coffins, and the gardens like tombs in 



214 DR. S. G. HOWE, 

which the coffins are placed. I had been conversing with one 
of the convicts in his room I beg the reverend gentleman s 
pardon, in his coffin (large enough to hold a loom, a bed, a 
table, a book-case and a few chairs) when I opened the 
door the lid of the coffin, I suppose the reverend gentleman 
would call it and went into the yard the tomb, I mean, sir. 

It was a small garden, sir, very small indeed, and it was 
surrounded with high walls ; but there was the kind mother 
earth, as ready to yield her prolific bosom to the labors of the 
convict as to those of the husbandman ; and there was the 
bright sun shining as warmly and genially upon the poor pris 
oner as upon any prince ; and God, who sends his rain upon the 
unjust as well as upon the just, came down there in every 
passing shower, and was found there every morning in the glit 
tering dew. It was autumn, and the flowers were fading, and 
the yellow leaves were falling from a peach tree, that grew by 
the garden wall ! Yes, sir, a peach tree in the tomb of a Penn 
sylvania convict ! He had planted it, and watered it, and nur 
tured it, and watched its swelling buds, and rejoiced over its 
opening blossoms, and caressed its tender leaves, until it became 
to him like a child, like a companion, like a friend, like a 
teacher. Every day the culture and care of his plant lightened 
the task in his cell ; and on the Sabbath, after the study of his 
Bible, his dumb companions in the garden opened to him new 
pages in God s great book of Nature. 

Such, sir, is one of the tombs of the Philadelphia prison i 
Such are the fruits of love and improvement which one prisoner 
gathered there ! Would that those who cultivate larger gar 
dens might gather from them such fruits for the body and for 
the soul ! But to return to my description of the prisoner s life 
in his cell. He is, at first, left without work ; but soon he 
demands it. For the first time in his life he learns that idleness 
is pain. Work is given to him, and he is left with it, to learn to 
love it. Contrast this with the situation of the prisoner at 
Auburn, who is marched up in military array, and placed at his 
work, and forced to occupy himself incessantly at it, upon pain 
of the lash. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 215 

I have been a prisoner, sir ; I have known what a weary 
length of time is a day passed in a gloomy cell, without occu 
pation, without books, without hope ; what an age is a week, 
endured in close confinement ; what eternity is a month, 
dragged out in a lonely cell, w T here, though it was not dark, I 
could see no sun, nor moon, nor stars. Among the first portion 
of my imprisonment (in the Prussian prison at Berlin, for the 
offence of aiding the Poles in their struggle for liberty), I was 
kept au secret, as it was called, that is, no one was allowed to 
see me except the turnkey who brought my food I could not 
know my offence, I could not tell when I was to be tried, I 
could not tell what was to be my fate, I could not receive a 
letter or newspaper, or know what was going on in the world. 
I bore up under this depressing, and purposely agonizing treat 
ment, as well as one who had youth, and strength, and an ordi 
nary share of courage could ; but it was evident that my health 
could not endure long in my narrow cell, and my entreaty to be 
allowed exercise was complied with. I was led out into a 
court-yard of the prison, and I can assure you, sir, that though 
the fresh air was most delicious, and the bright sun was most 
welcome, I never cared to go there again. On either side were 
convicts in their cells, and they came to the gratings ; the men 
began to talk ribaldly, the women to beckon to me, and because 
I shrunk away, they blasphemed and cursed me until I was 
glad to find refuge in my cell ; and I thanked God for its silence 
and its solitude. It seemed to me a paradise in which I could 
live contented when contrasted with the hell it would have 
been if such wretches as I had seen had been its inmates with 
me. 

Sir, I trust that when I escaped from that prison, I was at 
least no worse a man than when I entered it ; but I shudder to 
think what might have become of me if I had been forced to 
v/ork, to eat, to march, and to associate for five, ten, or fifteen 
years with the other prisoners. Sir, the hunger and thirsting of 
the human soul for sympathy and communion, is almost as 
dreadful as that of the body for food. One has a feeling as of 
moral starvation, which, in common natures, will overcome the 



2l6 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

natural repugnance to associating with the depraved ; and per 
haps not all my own conscious innocence, nor the virtuous pre 
cepts of my home education, nor my own self-respect, would 
have saved me from sinking into despondency, from forming 
intimacy with my comrades, and from suffering moral evils 
which must almost affect even innocent men, on being congre 
gated with criminals. And if I should have been injured, if 
I shrank from congregating with criminals, shall I not plead 
for my brother who has the same feelings and the same 
nature as I have? May there not be a man committed to 
our prison who is as innocent of any crime as I was ? May 
there not be others, who (when we consider the sudden and 
dreadful temptation that came over them in a moment), are 
hardly to be counted as responsible ! And shall we herd these 
men in with hardened offenders ? 

It was philanthropy, too, which moved the com 
passion of Dr. Howe so deeply for the fugitive slave. 
He had compassion for all men, but most of all for 
those who had all men against them, and such almost 
were the fugitive slaves who escaped from the South. 
The first of these slave cases that attracted general 
notice in Boston, was that of Latimer, in 1844; the 
next was that of poor " Joe," who had hardly set 
foot in South Boston the first free soil he had ever 
seen when he was seized unlawfully, and carried 
back to slavery in New Orleans, by a Yankee ship 
master, acting under the orders of a Boston merchant. 
It was in the summer of 1846, in the midst of the 
Mexican war, and when Lowell was just beginning 
to publish those rustic poems, the " Biglow Papers," 
which first made the young poet known to the great 
world he has so long delighted with his writings. 
Dr. Howe issued a call for another Faneuil Hall con 
vention (Sept. 24, 1846), where John Quincy Adams 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 2iy 

presided, and where Sumner and Wendell Phillips 
and Theodore Parker spoke. But the chief speaker 
was Dr. Howe, and this was the speech, perhaps the 
longest that he ever made in his life: x 

I have been requested, fellow-citizens, as Chairman of the 



1 Among those who sent to Dr. Howe letters of concurrence in 
the purpose of the Faneuil Hall meeting, were R. W. Emerson, of 
Concord, Gerrit Smith, Charles Sedgwick, and William H. 
Seward. Mr. Emerson wrote thus: 

To Dr. S. G. Howe and his Associates of the Committee : 

If I could do or say anything useful, or equal to the occasion, I 
would not fail to attend the meeting on Thursday. I feel the irre 
parable shame to Boston of this abduction. I hope it is not possi 
ble that the city will make the act its own, by any color of justifica 
tion. Our State has suffered many disgraces of late years to spoil 
our pride in it; but never any so flagrant as this if the people of 
the Commonwealth can be brought to be accomplices in this crime, 
which, I assure myself, will never be. I hope it is not only not 
to be sustained by the mercantile body, but not even by the 
smallest portion of that class. If the merchants tolerate this 
crime, as nothing will be too bad for their desert, so it is very cer 
tain they will have the ignominy very faithfully put to their 
lips. . . . It is high time our bad wealth came to an end. I 
am sure I shall very cheerfully take my share of suffering in the 
ruin of such a prosperity, and shall very willingly turn to the moun 
tains to chop wood, and seek to find for myself and my children 
labors compatible with freedom and honor. With this feeling, I 
am proportionately grateful to Mr. Adams and yourselves for 
undertaking the office of putting the question to our people, 
whether they will make this cruelty theirs, and of giving them an 
opportunity of clearing the population from the stain of this 
crime, and securing mankind from the repetition of it in this 
quarter forever. 

Respectfully and thankfully, your obedient servant,

CONCORD, Sept. 23, 1846. 



2l8 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Committee of Arrangements for this meeting, to make a state 
ment of the reasons for calling this meeting, and of the ob 
jects which it is proposed to attain ; and I shall do so very 
briefly. A few weeks ago, there sailed from New Orleans a 
vessel belonging to this port, owned and manned by New 
England freemen, under the flag of our Union the flag of the 
free. When she had been a week upon her voyage, and was 
beyond the jurisdiction of the laws of Louisiana, far out upon 
a broad and illimitable ocean, there was found secreted in her 
hold a man, lying naked upon the cargo, half suffocated by the 
hot and stifled air, and trembling with fear. He begged the 
sailors who found him not to betray him to the captain, for he 
had rather die than be discovered before he got to Boston. 
Poor fellow ! he had heard of Boston ; he had heard that there 
all men were free and equal he had seen the word Boston 
written on that ship ; and he had said to himself, " I, too, am a 
man, and not a brute or a chattel, and if I could only once set 
my foot in that blessed city, my claims to human brotherhood 
will be admitted, and I shall be treated as a man and a 
brother" and he hid himself in the hold. Well, sir, the 
knowledge of his being there could not long be kept from the 
captain, and he was dragged from his hot and close hiding 
place, and brought upon deck. It was then seen that he was 
a familiar acquaintance a bright, intelligent mulatto youth, 
who used to be sent by his master to sell milk on board ; he 
had been a favorite, and every man from the captain to the 
cabin boy used to have his joke with " Joe." They had treated 
him like a human being could he expect they would ever help 
to send him into slavery like a brute ? 

And now what was to be done ? Neither the captain nor any 
of his officers had been privy to his coming on board ; they 
could not be convicted of the crime of willfully aiding a 
brother man to escape from bondage ; the man was to them as 
though he had been dropped from the clouds, or been picked 
up floating on a plank at sea ; he was thrown, by the Provi 
dence of God, upon their charity and humanity ! 

But it was decided to send him back to New Orleans ; to 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 219 

deliver him up to his old owner ; and they looked long and 
eagerly for some ship that would take charge of him. None 
such, however, was found, and the Ottoman arrived safely in 
our harbor. The wish of the poor slave was gratified ; his 
eyes were blessed with the sight of the promised land. He 
had been treated well for the most part on board could he 
doubt that the hearts of his captors had softened ! Can we 
suppose that sailors, so proverbial for their generous nature, 
could have been, of their own accord, the instruments of send 
ing- the poor fellow back ! I, for one, will not believe it. 

But the captain communicated with his rich and respectable 
owners, men whom he was accustomed to honor and obey, and 
they decided that whether a human being or not, poor " Joe " 
must be sent back to bondage ; they would not be a party, 
even against their will, to setting free a slave. (Loud cries of 
" shame, shame," and " let us know the name of the owner.") 
The name of the firm is John H. Pearson & Co. (Repeated 
cries of " shame, shame.") It was a dangerous business this 
that they undertook ; they did not fear to break the laws of 
God to outrage the laws of humanity ; but they did fear the 
laws of the Commonwealth. For those laws threatened the 
State s Prison to whoever should illegally imprison another. 
They knew that no person, except the owner of the runaway 
slave, or his agent, or a marshal of the United States, had any 
right to touch him; they were neither the one nor the other ; 
and they therefore hid their victim upon an island in our har 
bor and detained him there. 

But he escaped from their clutches ; he fled to our city to 
the city of his hopes he was here in our very streets, fellow- 
citizens ! He had gained an asylum he called on us for aid. 
Of old, there were temples so sacred that even a murderer 
who had taken refuge in them was free from pursuit ; but no 
such temple did Boston offer to the hunted slave ; he was pur 
sued and seized, and those of our wondering citizens who in 
quired what it all meant, were deceived by a lie about his 
being a thief, and he was dragged on board ship. 

But the news of this got abroad ; legal warrants were at 



220 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

once procured ; the shield of the habeas corpus was prepared 
to cover the fugitive ; officers of justice were urged to the pur 
suit ; the owner of the vessel was implored to give an order 
for the man s surrender but all in vain. A vessel was found, 
bound for New Orleans, which would consent to be made a 
slave ship of. (Loud cries for the name of the ship.) The 
Niagara, belonging to the same owners and on board of this 
ship the man was sent back, to receive the lash and wear the 
shackles, for his ill-starred attempt to be free, and to drag out 
all the days of his life as a degraded, wretched, and hopeless 
slave ! 

And now, fellow-citizens, how does all this differ from piracy 
and the slave trade ? The man was free free at sea, free on 
shore and it was only by a legal process that he could be 
arrested. He was seized in our city, bound and carried into 
slavery by those who had no more right to do so than has the 
slave-trader to descend upon the coast of Guinea and carry off 
the inhabitants. All these facts are known and admitted ; nay, 
they are defended by some who call themselves followers of 
Him who said, " As ye would that men should do unto you, do 
ye even so to them ; " they are defended, too, by some of those 
presses whose editors arrogate for themselves the name of 
Watchmen on the Towers of Liberty ! 

And now it will be asked it has been asked, tauntingly 
how can we help ourselves ? What can this meeting do about 
it ? In reply, let me first state what it has not proposed to do 
about it. It is not proposed to move the public mind to any 
expression of indignation, much less to any acts of violence 
against the parties connected with the late outrage. As to the 
captain, it is probable that he was more sinned against than 
sinning. I am told that he is a kind, good man, in most of the 
relations of life, and that he was made a tool of. Let him go 
and sin no more. As for the owners and their abettors the 
men who used the wealth and influence which God gave them 
to kidnap and enslave a fellow-man a poor, trembling, hunted 
wretch who had fled to our shores for liberty and sought refuge in 
our borders let them go, too their punishment will be dread- 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 221 

ful enough without our adding to it. Indeed, I, for one, can say 
that I would rather be in the place of the victim whom they are 
at this moment sending away into bondage I would rather be 
in his place than in theirs ; aye ! through the rest of my earthly 
life I would rather be a driven slave upon a Louisiana planta 
tion than roll in their wealth and bear the burden of their guilt ; 
and as for the life to come, if the police of those regions to 
which bad men go be not as sleepy as the police of Boston, 
then may the Lord have mercy upon their souls ! 

But, Mr. Chairman, again it is asked : " What shall we do ? " 
Fellow-citizens, it is not a retrospective, but a prospective 
action which this meeting proposes, and there are many ways 
in which good may be done and harm prevented, some of which 
I hope will be proposed by those who may follow me, and who, 
probably, will be more accustomed to such meetings than I am. 
But first let me answer some of the objections which have been 
urged by some of those gentlemen who have been invited to 
come up here to-night and help us, and have declined to do so. 
They say : " We must not interfere with the course of the law." 
Sir, they know as well as we know that if the law be the edge 
of the ax, public opinion is the force that gives strength and 
weight to the blow. 

Sir, we have tried the " let-alone system " long enough ; we 
have a right to judge the future by the past, and we know that 
the law will not prevent such outrage in time to come, unless 
the officers of the law are driven by public opinion to do their 
duty. What has made the African slave-trade odious ? Was 
it the law or public opinion ? 

But, sir, in order to test the strength of this objection, let us 
suppose that instead of the poor hunted mulatto one of the 
clergymen of Boston had been carried off into slavery. Would 
the pulpit have been silent ? Had one of our editors been car 
ried aw r ay, would the press have been dumb ? Would there 
have been any want of glaring capitals and notes of exclama 
tion ? Suppose a lawyer had been kidnapped in his office, bound 
and carried off to work on a slave plantation ; would the limbs 
of the law have moved so lazily as they did week before last ? 



222 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Or suppose a merchant had been torn from his counting-room 
in State street, and shipped for the slave market of Tunis 
would ihere not have been an excitement all over the city ? 
Think you there would not have been " indignation meetings " 
on " Change ? " 

And yet, sir, are any of these men more precious in the sight 
of God than the poor mulatto ? Or suppose a slave-ship from 
the coast of Guinea, with her human cargo on board, had been 
driven by stress of weather into our port, and one of her vic 
tims had escaped to our shores, and had been recaptured and 
carried off in the face of the whole community ; would there 
have been any want of " indignation " then ? And, sir, is there 
any difference, would it be a greater crime to carry such an one 
away ? except that as this man had been once a slave, he might 
be made a slave again that is, that two wrongs might make 
a right. 

No, Mr. Chairman, these are not the true reasons. It is, sir, 
that the " peculiar institution," which has so long been brood 
ing over the country like an incubus, has at last spread abroad 
her murky wings, and has covered us with her benumbing 
shadow. It has silenced the pulpit ; it has muffled the press ; its 
influence is everywhere. Court street, that can find a flaw in 
every indictment, and can cunningly devise ways to save the 
murderer from the gallows Court street can find no way of 
escape for the poor slave. State street, that drank the blood 
of the martyrs of liberty State street is deaf to the cry of the 
oppressed slave ; the port of Boston, that has been shut up by 
a tyrant king as the dangerous haunt of freemen the port of 
Boston has been opened for the slave-trader ; for God s sake, 
Mr. Chairman, let us keep Fanueil Hall free. Let there be 
words of such potency spoken here this night as shall break 
the spell that is upon the community. Let us devise such 
means and measures as shall secure to every man who seeks 
refuge in our borders, all the liberties and all the rights which 
the law allows him. 

In the speech of John Qu-incy Adams, who pre- 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 223 

sided, he said : " The state of my health and the 
feebleness of my voice will not probably permit one 
in ten to hear what I may say. Forty years ago I 
stood, by the suffrages of your fathers, and perhaps 
your grandfathers, in this same situation. I recollect 
the former situation well. A seaman had been taken out 
of an American frigate by the crew of a British man- 
of-war, and a similar meeting was called. The vener 
able Elbridge Gerry, * of whom you have all heard, 
one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, 
was sent for to come from his residence in Cam 
bridge to preside. He came, and apologized for his 
age and infirmities, which should have kept him at 
home ; he said that the event was of such a nature 
that if he had but one day more to live, he would 
have come. On that same principle I now appear 
before you. It is a question whether this Common 
wealth is to maintain its independence as a State or 
not. It is a question whether yours and my native 
Commonwealth is capable of protecting the men who 
are under its laws or not." 

Charles Sumner, who the day before had been 
voted down in the Whig State Convention, while sup 
porting the anti-slavery resolutions of Stephen C. 
Phillips, was loudly called for in the meeting, and 

1 Gerry, in 1806, was but 62 years old, and was afterwards Gov 
ernor of Massachusetts and Vice-President of the United States, 
dying in 1814 at the age of 70. Mr. Adams in 1846 was 79 years 
old, and he lived but a year and a half longer. The reasons that 
kept Webster from attending his own convention in January, 1845, 
never operated on one of the Adamses ; and no contrast could be 
greater than that between the spirit of the old President and that of 
the would-be President who deserted his post in 1845, and betrayed 
it to the enemy in 1850. 



224 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

made a good speech, which is not included in his 
" Works." He said, among other things : "There is 
no law of the United States, no regulation in the 
Constitution rendering it necessary for a person with 
out authority from the master, to return a fugitive to 
bondage. I say, then, Captain Hannum was a volun 
teer he violated the law of Massachusetts in the 
cause of slavery. And that poor unfortunate who has 
been pictured to you to-night, when he touched the soil 
of Massachusetts, was as much entitled to the protec 
tion of its laws as any of you, fellow-citizens as 
as much as you, Mr. President, covered with honors 
as you are. Some twenty years ago, in the State of 
New York, an individual, not a colored person, was 
kidnapped, carried away, and killed. That outrage 
caused an immense excitement which spread from 
New York to Massachusetts, and finally enveloped all 
New England in its rage. 1 The abduction of William 



1 The abduction and murder of the worthless Morgan, who had 
published a book professing to expose the secrets of Masonry, took 
place in 1826, and the whole story is told in the autobiography of 
Thurlow Weed, at great length, and so as to leave no doubt what 
became of Morgan. He was drowned in Lake Ontario in the latter 
part of September, 1826, by John Whitney and three other persons, 
who rowed out from near Fort Niagara for that purpose. The 
Anti-Masonic political party was soon formed and became powerful 
in four or five States. Vermont cast its electoral vote in 1832 for 
William Wirt, the Presidential candidate of the Anti-Masons. The 
late Chief- Justice Chase, when a student in Mr. Wirt s office at 
Washington, was an Anti-Mason, so were Judge McLean, Thaddeus 
Stevens, John Quincy Adams, Charles Allen, of Worcester, Mass., 
and many of those who afterwards became active anti-slavery 
leaders. Judge Allen was a grand-nephew of Samuel Adams, the 
father of the American Revolution, and had many of the same 
traits. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 225 

Morgan by the Freemasons of his own State, roused 
the Northern States and raised a party which exercised 
an important influence upon the politics of the coun 
try. Now another individual has been stolen. We 
do know that he has been carried away into slavery, 
though we do not know that he has been slain. But 
he has been carried back to suffer all the wrongs 
which slavery can inflict. This outrage should rouse 
the citizens of Massachusetts and of the Northern 
States to call for the abolition of that institution 
which caused it." This allusion to the Anti-Ma 
sonic agitation of 1826-33 was better understood in 
1846 than it would be now ; but it was very pertinent 
and close as a comparison of two powerful influences 
which disguise from the minds of honest men the 
true nature of hideous crime. Every step in the mur 
der of Morgan was parallel to those which slavery 
was forced to take in its own defense. 

This indignation meeting at Faneuil Hall brought 
Dr. Howe conspicuously forward as a champion of 
the slave, and showed that the moral sentiment of 
Massachusetts represented by the Adamses, the 
Quincys, the Phillipses, and the Channings, by 
Emerson, Lowell, Whittier, Alcott, Thoreau, Theo 
dore Parker, and John A. Andrew supported him and 
his friend Sumner. But the mercantile spirit of Bos 
ton was insensible to the degradation to which it was 
subjecting the good old town. Stephen C. Phillips, * 

1 This gentleman was a distant cousin of Wendell Phillips, living 
in Salem, where a branch of the Phillips family had been settled for 
many generations, overflowing from there into Andover and Exeter, 
where wealthy Phillipses had founded schools in the eighteenth 
century. 



226 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

himself a merchant, declared that he did not believe 
another merchant in Boston, except Pearson, would 
be guilty of such an act of injustice and wrong. 
To this Pearson replied in the newspapers, that his 
course was commended by the merchants of Boston, 
and that " the response of the Boston merchants 
assembled on Change any day from half-past one till 
two o clock would confirm his doings by a vote of five 
to one." 1 As Boston was then largely engaged in 
the Southern trade of cotton, rice, molasses, etc., it 
is quite likely Pearson was right. There was, how 
ever, another class of merchants, represented by 
Samuel May, Charles F. Hovey, George W. Bond, 
George Higginson, and many more, who would have 
sacrificed their mercantile interests rather than send 
back a slave into bondage. 

The upshot of the meeting was the appointment of 
a vigilance committee of forty members, of which 
Dr. Howe was chairman, and which continued to 
exist, in various forms, until the hunting of fugitives 
ceased in Boston, and the citizens began to enlist the 
same stalwart negroes as sailors and soldiers, who 
had for so many years been hunted as runaway 
slaves in the streets of the city and the country towns 
of Massachusetts. At that period (1862-63) Dr. Howe 
was by national appointment, a member of an eman 
cipation commission, holding sessions in Virginia 
and South Carolina. Thus had the whirligig of time 
brought about its revenges. 

Upon the principles laid down by Webster, in 

1 Change at that time was on State street near the scene of the 
Boston Massacre of 1770 the Merchants Exchange, a fine build 
ing, now torn away, standing just below the Old State House. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 227 

1844-45, the " Conscience Whigs " of Massachusetts 
formed their party. Sumner became early a mem 
ber of it, and so did his friend, Dr. Howe. They 
maintained for some years, and even after the Mex 
ican war, which they stoutly opposed, certain rela 
tions of friendship with Webster ; so much so indeed 
that in October 1846, he wrote to Sumner l from 
Marshfield : " I have ever cherished high respect for 
your character and talents, and seen with pleasure 
the promise of your future and greater eminence and 
usefulness. In political affairs we happen to enter 
tain at the present moment a difference of opinion 
respecting the relative importance of some of the 
political questions of the time. These differences I 
much regret, but shall not allow them to interfere 
with personal regard." This letter was written but 
a month before Dr. Howe entered definitely into 
political conflict, by accepting a nomination for Con 
gress against Mr. Winthrop, which Sumner had a 
few days before declined to receive. 



1 Sumner in January, 1845, was in the secret of the subsidy 
granted to Webster, at his own suggestion, before he would return 
to the Senate from Massachusetts. He writes to Judge Story that 
Webster s terms were $50,000, to be subscribed in Boston, and the 
same sum in New York ; to be settled on his life and that of his 
wife. " The subscription in Boston has labored ; though, when I 
last heard of it, the Boston sum had been subscribed except about 
$12,000. The manufacturing companies have subscribed $1,000 
each. None of the Lawrences subscribed, though the Appletons 
have. It is understood that the New York portion is to be made 
up by larger sums." At this date (February 5, 1845) Webster had 
been elected Senator. See " Memoir of Charles Sumner, "Vol. II., 
p. 331. The money thus subscribed and funded has been in part 
returned since the death of Mrs. Webster. 



CHAPTER IV. 

DR. HOWE STANDS UP TO BE SHOT AT. 

THE nomination of Dr. Howe as the candidate of 
the " Conscience Whigs," was ratified, November 5, 
1846, by a meeting in the Tremont Temple of Boston, 
over which John Albion Andrew, 1 afterwards the 
"War Governor" of Massachusetts, presided, and 
where speeches were made by Sumner and Charles 
Francis Adams. In Sumner s speech he told this 
story of Dr. Howe : "When in July, 1830, the people 
of Paris succeeded in their revolution, Lafayette, 
votary of liberty in two hemispheres, placing himself 
at the head of the movement, made his way on foot 
to the City Hall, through streets filled with barri 
cades and strewn with the wrecks of war. Moving 
along with a thin attendance, he was unexpectedly 
joined by a gallant Bostonian, who, though young in 



1 This eminent man, born in Maine, May 31, 1818, died in Bos 
ton October 30. 1867. He was formed by nature to lead the 
people in a crisis like that of our Civil War, during the whole of 
which he was Governor of Massachusetts, elected in November, 1860, 
and laying down his office in January, 1866. He was the close 
personal friend of Dr. Howe, whom he appointed in 1865 to the 
important position at the head of the State Charities of Massa 
chusetts, of which more will be said hereafter. He was also before 
the war an intimate friend of Wendell Phillips and Theodore 
Parker, who spoke of him in those years as " the future Chief- 
Justice." I first met him at Parker s house. 



POLITICAL COHFLICT. 229 

life, was already eminent by years of disinterested 
service in the struggle for Grecian independence 
against the Turks ; who had listened to the whizzing 
of bullets, and narrowly escaped the descending 
scimitar. Lafayette, considerately brave, turned to 
his faithful friend, and said : " Do not join me ; this 
is a danger for Frenchmen only ; reserve yourself 
for your own country, where you will be needed." 
That fellow-citizen heeded him not, but continued 
by his side, sharing his perils. That Bostonian was 
Dr. Howe." 

This was a good introduction of his friend to a 
Boston audience, and it was literally true. He had 
thus guarded the march of Lafayette, and had re 
ceived this friendly dissuasive from the old general. 
It was an honor thus to be addressed by that voice, 
so well known throughout the world, "a voice which 
the friends of free institutions will recognize" as Lafay 
ette modestly said when he spoke against Napoleon 
in 1815. Sumner went on to say : 

I shall feel a satisfaction in voting for Dr. Howe, beyond even 
the gratification of personal friendship, because he is not a 
politician. He is the friend of the poor, the blind, the prisoner, 
the slave. Wherever there is suffering, there his friendship is 
manifest. Generosity, disinterestedness, self-sacrifice, and 
courage have been his inspiring sentiments directed by rare 
sagacity and intelligence. Such a character reflects luster 
upon the place of his oirth, far more than if he had excelled 
only in the strife of politics or the servitude of party. He 
has qualities which especially commend him at this time. He 
is firm, ever true, honest, determined, a lover of the right, with 
a courage that charms opposition ; he would not fear to stand 
alone against a fervid majority. Knowing war by fearful 
familiarity, he is an earnest defender of peace, with a singular 



230 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

experience of life in other countries, he now brings the stores 
he has garnered up, and his noble spirit, to the service of his 
fellow-citizens. 1 

Yet with all these commendations, and in spite of the 
fact that he had before been elected to the School 
Committee, and to the Legislature, Howe received 
but 1,334 votes out of the 8,333 which were cast. Mr. 
Winthrop got 5,980 or nearly twice as many as all 
the candidates against him, and the next year (Decem 
ber, 1847), was chosen Speaker of the House at Wash 
ington, notwithstanding the opposition of Dr. Pal 
frey, a Whig member from the next district. Mr. 
Winthrop had now become, earlier than Webster, the 
champion of the " Cotton Whigs," and never after 
wards rendered that service to the cause of freedom 
which his talents and eloquence would have made 
so effective. He served in the Senate for a short 
term, but was defeated as a candidate for reelection 
in 1855, and refused the proposition of his successor, 
Henry Wilson, to take the lead of an anti-slavery party 
in Massachusetts in the summer of 1855. From that 
time his influence in Massachusetts politics became

2 John Gorham Palfrey, D.D., had been a clergyman in Boston 
where Webster was one of his parish ; he then removed to Cam 
bridge where he was a professor in Harvard University and editor 
of the North American Review. He became a " Conscience 
Whig" and was elected to Congress from the Middlesex District 
which Edward Everett and Samuel Hoar had represented. His 
refusal to vote for his brother Whig, Mr. Winthrop, for Speaker, 
was the occasion of a bitter warfare against him ; the humorous side 
of which may be seen in Lowell s " Biglow Papers," as hereafter 
quoted. He was afterwards Postmaster of Boston, and died in 1881. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 23! 

much less than that of Dr. Howe, whom he had so 
triumphantly defeated in 1846. 

Horace Mann, who had been for more than a dozen 
years a co-laborer with Howe in many good causes, and 
who was himself to enter warmly into political strife 
two years later, did not approve of his friend s posi 
tion in 1846. Writing to their common friend, George 
Combe, in April, 1847, Mann said : "At our last Con 
gressional election Howe consented to be the candi 
date for Congress of the anti-slavery and anti-war 
party. I think in so doing he made a great mistake. 
Another man would have served as a rallying point 
as well he ; and such is the inexorableness of party 
discipline that he at once lost a great portion of his 
well-earned popularity and extensive influence. 1 He 
was proscribed, and a few days after failed of being 
elected on the School Committee, when he might 
have been but for that misstep." 



1 In September, 1851, Theodore Parker wrote in his Diary : " Dr. 
Howe says that for twenty years he has been in Boston, most of 
the time at the head of the Blind Institution, and never received 
any sign of recognition from the city authorities, in the shape of. an 
invitation to any of their festivities. Had he kept a great rum- 
shop," adds Parker, " and made men blind and idiotic, it would not 
have been so." It is probable that Howe a little exaggerated this 
neglect of him by the city officials, many of whom had been his 
personal friends ; but they perhaps thought him too busy with his 
philanthropies to care for their feasts. A few days after this (Sep 
tember 24, 1851) Howe and Parker dined at the Norfolk County 
Cattle Show, where their friend George R. Russell had given the 
Address. 



CHAPTER V. 

THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT IN BOSTON. 

FROM 1846 to 1850 events moved fast in the degra 
dation of the North and the triumphant progress of 
the slavemasters. A slight check was given them by 
the honest and manly administration of General 
Taylor, who, although a slaveholder, and the father- 
in-law of that notorious leader of the South, Jefferson 
Davis, had yet a soldier s training, and a patriot s love 
for his country. He was elected in 1848, took office 
in 1849, and was soon beset, as his predecessors and 
successors were, by the slavemasters with their inso 
lent and treasonable demands. Two or three wit 
nesses (Mr. Hamlin, afterwards Vice-President, 1 Thur- 
low Weed, and General Pleasanton), testify to the 
spirit with which, in January, 1850, General Taylor 



i Hannibal Hamlin, born in i8og, and just deceased (July, 1891), 
was a Democratic politician in Maine for many years before 1850, 
and at this time was a Democratic Senator from that State. He 
belonged to the anti-slavery Democracy, however, like John P. 
Hale, of New Hampshire, and S. P. Chase, of Ohio, and in 1856 
became a Republican. He was elected Vice-President on the ticket 
with Abraham Lincoln in 1860, but displaced from the ticket in 1864, 
to make room for Andrew Johnson, at the request of Lincoln him 
self. His testimony in this matter cannot be impeached. That of 
Mr. Weed has been called in question by Mr. Stephens ; but it must 
be in substance correct. The passage soon to be quoted from Web 
ster confirms it. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 233 

met them. The particular persons were three South 
ern Whigs, A. H. Stephens, Robert Toombs, and a 
North Carolinian named Clingman. They had just 
left President Taylor in the White House, when Mr. 
Hamlin called on him, and this is Mr. Hamlin s 
account : 

As I was approaching the door to the President s room, 
Messrs. Toombs and Stephens, of Georgia, came out. They 
were excited in their manner to a degree that attracted my 
notice. I found the President alone and much excited. He 
appeared like an enraged lion in a cage ; in fact, he must have 
walked across the room three or four times before he even 
noticed me. He then spoke to me, but still continued pacing 
the room. " Mr. Hamlin," said he, " what are you doing in 
the Senate with the Omnibus Bill ? (This was Henry Clay s 
last compromise.) My reply was prompt : " Mr. President, I 
believe the bill wrong in principle, and am doing what I can 
to defeat it." His rejoinder was as prompt and very decided. 
" Stand firm, don t yield ! it means disunion, and I am pained 
to learn that we have disunion men to deal with. Disunion is 
treason " then, with an expletive, and an emphasis I shall 
never forget, he said " that if they attempted to carry on their 
schemes while he was President, they should be dealt with as 
by law they deserved and executed." 

Mr. Weed, who met Mr. Hamlin as he came out, is 
even more explicit as to General Taylor s purpose. 
He found him walking rapidly to and fro. " Did you 
meet those damned traitors ? " he said. They came 
to talk with him about slavery ; and when he told 
them he would approve of any Constitutional bill 
that Congress would pass, and would execute the laws 
of the country, they threatened a dissolution of the 
Union. In reply he told them that if necessary he 
would take command of the army himself, and if they 



234 DR - s - G - HOWE. 

were taken in rebellion, he would hang them with 
less reluctance than he had hung deserters and spies 
in Mexico. Growing more calm, he took a seat, and 
told Mr. Weed that these men presumed upon his 
acquiescence in their treason, because he was a South 
ern man and a slaveholder ; but he had looked care 
fully into the question since he became President, and 
was now satisfied that the exactions and purposes of 
the South were intolerable and revolutionary. He 
added that Jefferson Davis was the chief conspirator 
in the scheme which Toombs, Stephens, and Cling- 
man had broached to him. There is a letter of 
Daniel Webster s to Franklin Haven, of Boston, 
dated September 12, 1850, two months after Taylor s 
death, that bears on this same subject of his firmness 
against the Democrats. Webster, who, by this time, 
had been persuaded by his friends and his hopes to 
desert the cause of the North, writes : 

General Taylor was an honest and patriotic man ; but he had 
quite enough of that quality which, when a man is right we call 
firmness, and when he is wrong, obstinacy. What has been 
called his plan was simply to admit California under her free 
constitution, and to let the Territories alone altogether, till 
they could come in as States. General Taylor told me, in the 
last conversation I had with him, that he preferred California 
should not come in at all rather than that she should come in 
bringing the Territories on her back. And if he had lived it 
might have been doubtful if any general settlement would have 
been made. He was a soldier, and had a little fancy, I am 
afraid, to see how easily any military movement by Texas could 
have been put down. His motto was, vi-et armis. He had a 
soldier s foresight, and saw quite clearly what would be the 



See " Life of Thurlovv Weed," vol. II., pp. 176-178. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 235 

result if the Texas militia should march into New Mexico l and 
there be met by the regular army of the United States. But 
that he had a statesman s foresight and foresaw what might 
happen if blood should be shed in a contest between the United 
States and one of the Southern States, is more than I am ready 
to affirm. 

General Taylor died in July, 1850, and from that 
time till Abraham Lincoln took the chair in March, 
1861, our Presidents grew more and more subservient 
to the slave-power. Fillmore, urged on by Webster, 
signed the Fugitive Slave Bill in September, 1850, 
and Pierce, his successor, enforced it in Boston. 
Under this act, the earliest slave case in Boston, well 
known at the time, was that of William and Ellen 
Craft. Theodore Parker, writing to James Martineau 
in London, November n, 1850, two months after the 
Fugitive Slave Act passed, thus tells this tale : " The 
Crafts have been in Boston nearly two years; are 
sober and industrious people. She is a seamstress, 
he a cabinetmaker. They are members of my parish. 
A few weeks ago there came a ruffian from Macon, in 
Georgia, by the name of Hughes he is a jailer at 
home with authority to seize and carry off the two 
fugitives. He applied to the proper officer, got his 
warrant, and secured the service of the marshal. All 
was ready for the seizure but William armed him 
self with two revolvers and a substantial dirk, and 



1 This was one of the threats of the Southern "fire-eaters" of 
that period the object being, as it afterwards was in marching the 
Missouri militia into Kansas, to make sure of another slave State. 
Compare the firmness of Taylor in 1850, with the weakness of 
Pierce in 1855-56. 



236 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

was ready to kill any one who should attempt to 
kidnap him. His wife was concealed by some friends 
who kept her safe and sound. After the danger was 
over Craft s friends thought it wiser for them to go 
England, that you may see what sort of men and 
women we make slaves of in the Model Republic. 
My grandfather fought at the battle of Lexington 
against * the British, but now I am obliged to look 
to * the British for protection for the liberty of two 
of my own parishioners who have committed no 
wrong against any one." 

The " friends " who concealed Ellen Craft were 
Theodore Parker and his wife, at their house on 
Exeter Place.; and it was Dr. Howe, with his "vigi 
lance committee," who "persuaded" Hughes, the 
slave-catcher, to leave Boston without serving his 
warrant on the Crafts. Hughes had vowed he 
would carry them back to Georgia. Parker had 
called once at the United States Hotel, where the 
two Georgians were ; he called again on October 30, 
1850, and was introduced to Hughes, who said to 
Parker : " I hear you are a minister and a great 
moralist, but this don t look much like it." "What 
does not look like it?" "Mobs and violence." "But 
I came to prevent that you must be satisfied that 
you cannot carry William and Ellen Craft out of 
Boston." Hughes said he was satisfied of that, and 
sneaked away southward that afternoon. A week 
later the two fugitives were legally married by Mr. 
Parker, who gave them a Bible and a sword for 
their spiritual and physical salvation, and they soon 
sailed for England. William Craft and his wife lived 
in England for some fifteen years, then they returned 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 237 

to Boston and afterwards went to Georgia, where 
they lived in security for years. 

This affair of the Crafts took place soon after the 
passage of Senator Mason s Fugitive Slave Bill. 
Other cases followed in all parts of the country; 
some of much pathos, and some of great atrocity. 
They had much to do with the uprising of Northern 
manliness against the wicked law; but so completely 
have circumstances now changed, that it is difficult 
for the present generation to comprehend that such 
things ever took place. Listen then to the recital of 
a case, by a man conspicuous for his moderate opin 
ions; and you will understand why the " Compro 
mises of 1850 " were so provocative of indignation in 
Massachusetts. Rev. J. S. C. Abbott, a well-known 
historian, writing from Bowdoin College in January, 
1852, told this story of one case, which, within his 
knowledge, occurred in Boston in 1851: 

A colored girl eighteen years of age, a few years ago, escaped 
from slavery at the South. Through scenes of adventure and 
peril she found her way to Boston, obtained employment, 
secured friends, and became a consistent member of a Method 
ist Church. She became interested in a very worthy young 
man, of her own complexion, who was a member of the same 
Church. They w r ere soon married. Their home, though hum 
ble, was the abode of piety and contentment. Industrious, 
temperate, and frugal, all their wants were supplied. Seven 
years passed away ; they had two little boys, one six and the 
other four years of age. These children, the sons of a free 
father, but of a mother who had been a slave, by the laws of 
our Southern States, were doomed to their mother s fate. 
These Boston boys, born beneath the shadow of Faneuil Hall, 
the sons of a free citizen of Boston, and educated in the Boston 
free schools, were, by the compromises of the Constitution, 



238 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

admitted to be slaves, the property of a South Carolinian 
planter. The Boston father had no right to his own sons. The 
law, however, had long been considered a dead letter. The 
Christian mother, as she morning and evening bowed with her 
children in prayer, felt that they were safe from the slave- 
hunter, surrounded as they were by the churches, the schools, 
and the free institutions of Massachusetts. 

The F ugitive Slave Law was enacted. It revived the hopes 
of the slave-owners. A young, healthy, energetic mother, with 
two fine boys, was a rich prize. She would make an excellent 
breeder. Good men began to say : " We must enforce this 
law ; it is one of the compromises of the Constitution." Christ 
ian ministers began to preach : The voice of the law is the 
voice of God. There is no higher rule of duty. We must send 
back the fugitive and her children, even though we take our 
sister from the sacramental table of our common Saviour." The 
poor woman was panicstricken. Her friends gathered around 
her and trembled for her. Her husband was absent from home, 
a seaman on board one of our Liverpool packets. She was 
afraid to get out of doors lest some one from the South should 
see her, and recognize her. One day, as she was going to the 
grocery for some provisions, her quick and anxious eye caught 
a glimpse of a man prowling around, whom she immediately 
recognized as from the vicinity of her old home of slavery. 
Almost fainting with terror, she hastened home, and taking her 
two children by the hand, fled to the house of a friend. She 
and her trembling children were hid in the garret. In less than 
one hour after her escape, the officer, with a writ, came for her 
arrest. 

It was a dark and stormy day. The rain, freezing as it fell, 
swept in floods through the streets of Boston. Night came, 
cold, black, and tempestuous. At midnight, her friends took 
her in a hack, and conveyed her, with her children, to the house 
of her pastor. A prayer-meeting had been appointed there, 
at that hour, in behalf of their suffering sister. A small group 
of stricken hearts were assembled. They kneeled in prayer. 
The poor mother, thus hunted from her home, her husband far

away, sobbed, in the bitterness of her anguish, as though her 
heart would break. Her little children, trembling before a 
doom, the enormity of which they were incapable of appre 
ciating, cried loudly and uncontrollably. The humble minister 
caught the contagion. His voice became inarticulate through 
emotion. Bowing his head, he ceased to pray, and yielded 
himself to the sobbings of sympathy and grief. The floods of 
anguish were unloosed. Groanings and lamentations filled 
the room. No one could pray. Before the Lord, they could 
only weep. Other fugitives were there, trembling in view of 
a doom more dreadful to them than death. After an hour of 
weeping (for the voice of prayer had passed away into the sub 
limity of unutterable anguish) they took this Christian mother 
and her children in a hack, and conveyed them to one of the 
Cunard steamers, which, fortunately, was to sail for Halifax 
the next day. They took them in the gloom of midnight, 
through the tempest-swept streets, lest the slave-hunter should 
meet them. Her brethren and sisters of the church raised a 
little money from their scanty means to pay her passage, and 
to save her, for a few clays, from starving, after her first arrival 
in the cold land of strangers. Her husband soon returned to 
Boston, to find his home desolate, his wife and his children 
exiles in a foreign land. 

I think that this narrative may be relied upon as accurate. 
I received the facts from the lips of one, a member of the 
church, who was present at that midnight " weeping-meeting," 
before the Lord. Such is slavery in Boston, in the year 1852. 
Has the North nothing to do with slavery ? 

Theodore Parker says in his Diary for November 
6, 1850: " Saw Dr. Howe this afternooon ; he looks 
better, in fine health and spirits. I went with him to 
the Faneuil Hall meeting of Free-Soilers. Sumner was 
on his legs a fine speaker, a very sincere and good 
fellow, only he wants courage. Howe is braver and 
richer in ideas, but not so well trained for literary

work/ Yet this very speech of Sumner, given on the 
eve of the State election, probably made him Senator 
the next spring. In it he attacked the new Fugitive 
Slave Act, and declared that he would never obey it, 
because, "from beginning to end it sets at naught the 
best principles of the Constitution, and the very laws 
of God." He added : " Into the immortal catalogue of 
national crimes it has now passed, drawing by inex 
orable necessity its authors also, and chiefly him, who, 
as President of the United States, set his name to the 
Bill. * I believe that this Bill will be executed here. 
Fugitive slaves are the heroes of our age. In sacri 
ficing to this foul enactment, we violate every senti 
ment of hospitality, every whispering of the heart, 
every commandment cf religion." Following up this 
bold declaration, Sumner s first long speech in the 
Senate, in 1852, was upon his motion to repeal the 
Fugitive Slave Act ; and though it failed then, it suc 
ceeded twelve years later, when Sumner carried 
through the Senate (June 28, 1863) by a vote of 27 to 
12, a bill already passed in the House, repealing both 
Webster s Fugitive Slave Act, and that of Washing 
ton, which was passed in 1793. At this time the 
Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln had 
been in force for a year and a half, and slavery only 
existed in a few of the border States. Twenty years 



1 This was Millard Fillmore ; but the author of the bill was Mason, 
of Virginia, and its chief supporter in Massachusetts was Daniel 
Webster. Mason introduced it as a ruse to get a pretext for dis 
union, not expecting it would pass ; but Webster took it up as a 
means of gaining the favor of the South, and his influence carried it 
through. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 24! 

after the annexation of Texas (December, 1845), 
Texas itself was a free State. 1 

The wealthy and commercial classes of Boston and 
the other Northern cities, who had favored the pas 
sage of the "Compromises of 1850," slave-catching 
bill and all, were little aware how revolting the Fugi 
tive Slave Law was to the plain people of the North. 
Nothing did so much (until the Dred Scott decision 
of 1857 came) to rouse the North against the tyranny 
of the slave-masters, as did this odious enactment. 
The Garrisonian Abolitionists seized upon it at once, 
and for once they had public opinion warmly on their 
side. When the bill passed Samuel A. Eliot repre 
sented Boston in Congress, and voted for it. Charles 
Devens, afterwards an honored general and judge, 
was the marshal of Massachusetts. At the meeting 
of the Massachusets Anti-Slavery Society, January, 
1851, Wendell Phillips offered this resolution : 

Resolved, That in regard to Samuel Atkins Eliot, in his votes 
on the Territorial and Fugitive Slave Bills, we will not under 
take to decide whether he represented or misrepresented his 



1 Senator Foster, of Connecticut, by no means a radical politician, 
said in debate on the repeal of Webster s Act : " In my opinion it 
was a most iniquitous measure, and certainly most obnoxious to the 
people of the Free States from the day of its passage to the present 
hour (January 19, 1864). That bill was passed in a period of great 
excitement ; a malicious and malignant spirit had been excited. 
Sectional and partisan feeling raged over the land. An arrogant 
and defiant party in their pride of power passed that bill. From the 
first day I had the honor of a seat in this body until now, I should 
have cheerfully voted for its repeal at any time." Yet only 12 Sena 
tors had voted against this bill when it passed in 1850, and the vote 
in the House was 109 to 76 many Northern " Doughfaces " dodg 
ing the vote. 



242 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

constituency ; but since neither he nor his friends have 
attempted any defence of either of those measures except as 
necessary to avert dangers which nothing but the grossest 
ignorance could believe to exist, his base selfishness and craven 
spirit at that crisis make all former Northern treason look white 
by the side of the blackness of his infamy ; and as long as New 
England retains any spark of the spirit or of the pride of her 
ancestry, his memory will be held in loathing and abhorrence. 

Mr. Phillips referred to the vote which Mr. Eliot 
gave in the Massachusetts Legislature, instructing 
the Massachusetts delegation in Congress to oppose 
all extension of slavery ; and to his subsequent vote, 
at Washington, as one of that delegation, in favor of 
all the Compromise measures with Slavery, the Fugi 
tive Slave Law included. It was base fear for the 
Tariff, said he, and an equally base and false plea, 
that the law of 1850 is no worse than the law of 1793, 
that led him to give this disgraceful vote. " If the 
law of 1850 is no worse than that of 1793, how comes 
it that within four months we have had, here in Bos 
ton, two different attempts to recover fugitive slaves, 
and that they are occurring by scores throughout the 
Northern States, and so much more frequently than 
ever before in the history of the nation ? It becomes 
our duty to express our moral contempt and indig 
nation at Mr. Eliot s vote and whole course in this 
matter, and to show that the presence of the slave- 
catchers in our streets is a consequent and a fitting 
commentary on his vote." 

That satirical abolitionist, Edmund Quincy, a few 
days after wrote thus about Marshal Devens : 

The blame of there having been no slave caught in Boston 
seems to be gathered upon his devoted head. There was an 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 243 

attempt to have him decapitated for not restoring the Crafts to 
the patriarchal bosoms they had ignorantly fled from in Macon. 
But as he was ready to arrest Craft if Hughes or Knight would 
point him out, President Fillmore thought the request, 
although it came from the right side of the line, a little on the 
wrong side of reasonable. It seemed hardly fair to oblige the 
marshal to know every fugitive slave within his district by 
sight. Two or three weeks ago it was rumored that there was 
another slave hunt on foot in Boston. I do not know who the 
Nimrod was, the mighty hunter whose game was man, but it 
was reported and believed that the whipper-in of the pack was 
a New York lawyer. Now, a warrant was issued, the marshal 
appointed special deputies, the quarry was started ; but some 
how it was never caught. The huntsmen, whether at fault or not, 
were disappointed. And the blame, it seems, is laid on the 
shoulders of Marshal Devens. But it is understood that the 
slave in question was of Craft s way of thinking, and that he 
was prepared with the same persuasives that Turpin found 
effectual with the bishop s coachman : 

" But Dick put a couple of balls in his nob, 
And purwailed on him to stop," 

and that this was so well understood that the marshal and his 
men thought discretion the better part of valor. On this state 
ment of facts, it is understood that a complaint has been en 
tered against the marshal, and that he has gone on to head 
quarters to justify himself. I think he will not be able to do 
it, and that he will have to give place to a worthier successor. 
City Marshal Tukey and Deputy Sheriff Watson Freeman, 1 who 
distinguished himself by the constitutional courtesy with which 
he treated Hughes and Knight under the affliction which was 
traitorously visited upon them by the Vigilance Committee, are 
said to be the two prominent candidates. I shall recommend 
either of them as eminently worthy of this post of danger and

to kidnap me. F. B. S.

of honor, when President Fillmore applies to me for my 
advice. 

At this time a North Carolina newspaper gave this 
list of slave prices : 

" We give the sales of a few that have been effected 
from the ist of January, 1851. We note as follows : 
Women, aged from 28 to 45 years, brought from $665 
to $895 ; a family (mother and three children, very 
ordinary, but young), 1,525 ; a man, aged 45, his 
wife and two children, $1,810 ; a man, no age given, 
$1,118; and a woman and four children, $1,850. The 
above sales were either for cash or ninety days credit, 
interest added, with approved notes payable at bank. 
These sales and the annual hirings were made at pub 
lic auction ; others were hired privately at prices 
ranging from $150 to $300, as to quality, and business 
to be pursued." 

The exact market value of a Boston church mem 
ber, with her two children, was therefore about 
$1,500 by this scale of prices enough to tempt the 
cupidity of those wretches who dealt in human flesh 
in Virginia and the Carolinas. A few years later 
than this (in 1854) Anthony Burns, a fugitive from 
Virginia was seized, sent back into slavery by Edward 
Greeley Loring, a Slave Law Commissioner of Boston, 
and at the time Judge of Probate in Suffolk County, 
but removed from that office in 1858 by Governor 
Banks. Several of the rich men of Boston combined 
to purchase him from his master, and this was the 
sequence of events in his case : The chief movers in 
the matter of purchase were Hamilton Willis and 
Rev. L. A. Grimes, a colored pastor the latter collect- 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 2/5 

ing most of the subscriptions. The price named by Sut- 
tle, the master, was $1,200 and the money was raised. 
Among the subscribers were Charles P. Curtis and 
Thomas B. Curtis, each for $100; Charles H. Mills 
and Augustus Perrin, $50 each ; Glidden & Williams, 
$50 ; Samuel A. Eliot (father of President Eliot), $50 ; 
and Hamilton Willis, Moses Grant, Winslow Lewis, 
Samuel Johnson, Andrew Carney, Jacob Sleeper, etc., 
$25 each. George Baty Blake authorized Mr. Willis 
to receive from him " any amount you might think 
proper to call on me for." 

Why, then, was not Burns handed over to his friends 
in Boston? Col. Suttle was about to draw up the 
agreement in the office of Watson Freeman, the Mar 
shal of Massachusetts, May 31, 1854, when B. F. 
Hallet, the District Attorney, came in and talked with 
Suttle, who then said to Mr. Willis : "I must with 
draw what I have done with you." Thereupon Hal- 
let said, pointing to the spot where Bachelder had 
been killed by Martin Stowell, resisting a rescue of 
Burns, " That blood must be avenged." On Friday, 
June 2, when Mr. Willis went to receive Burns on 
board the revenue cutter, which carried him from 
Boston, he was told by Mr. Parker, counsel for the 
slaveholder, " Col. Suttle has pledged himself to Mr. 
Hallet that he will not sell his boy till he gets him 
home." It was therefore a Boston lawyer who pre 
vented the sale. Burns was carried away by force, 
lodged in the prison at Richmond and loaded with 
irons as a punishment for running away, until Novem 
ber (five months), when he fell violently ill, and the 
physician ordered his irons taken off. He was then 
put on the auction block and sold to a North Caro- 



246 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Una slave trader, McDaniel, who bid him off for 
$910. Suttle lost $300 and more by taking Hallet s 
advice, but McDaniel made $400, for he delivered 
Burns to his Boston purchasers in Baltimore subse 
quently for $1,300 and expenses. This bargain he 
was compelled to keep secret in Virginia, for "had it 
been known," says Mr. Dana, " that Burns was to be 
restored, there would have been danger to his life." 
McDaniel was obliged to carry him away from Rich 
mond by night for fear of a mob. He reached Bos 
ton early in 1855, and told Mr. Dana this story in 
March of that year. He died in Canada in 1862. 

This was the last of the Boston slave cases, in all of 
which Dr. Howe took an active part. The rescue of 
Shadrach in the winter of 1850-51, the rendition of 
Sims in April, 1851, and the arrest and return of 
Burns in 1854, called forth the services of the Vigi 
lance Committee of 1846, of which he continued to 
be Chairman, so long as there was any danger to the 
fugitives. 



CHAPTER VI. 

CHARLES SUMNER IN THE SENATE. 

WHEN Burns was carried away from Boston, after 
a vain attempt to rescue him, Charles Sumner had 
been for three years the successor of Webster in the 
Senate at Washington. But he owed his election, in 
April, 1851, to the indignation felt in Massachusetts 
against the Fugitive Slave Law, as much as to any 
cause. The contest over the election was long and 
doubtful ; and Dr. Howe was one of the friends of 
Sumner who guided it to its final issue of success. 
Writing early in February, 1851, Edmund Quincy, 
skeptical as to the final result, but well informed con 
cerning the hostility to Sumner, spoke as follows : 

" There has been another unsuccessful attempt to elect Mr. 
Sumner to the Senate. He came nearer to success than at any 
former time. On one ballot he lacked only two, and on the 
other but three, of a majority. If all the Free-Soilers had 
been present, he would have been chosen. There is a report 
that one man chosen as a Free-Soiler voted for Mr. Winthrop. 
But for this I do not vouch, nor did I hear his name. The 
Free-Soilers and the portion of the Democrats that act with 
them in good faith, are still confident of final success. But I 
apprehend there will always be the necessary one or two either 
conveniently ill or absent or treacherous. The Post and Hal- 
let wing of the Democrats are almost beside themselves with 
rage and fear. Their papers foam at the mouth, and talk like 
things possessed, in the view of anybody but a slave-catching 
Whig or Democrat being sent to the Senate from Massachu 
setts." 

(+*) 



248 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

But Sumner, whose cause was very skilfully cham 
pioned by Dr. Howe, among others, was finally 
chosen by one vote, in April, 1851, and took his seat in 
the Senate as the successor of Webster the next win 
ter. At that time Webster was Secretary of State 
under Fillmore, having resigned his seat in the Sen 
ate in July, 1850, when Mr. Winthrop was appointed 
for a few months. Though no man could be less 
homicidal than Sumner, he might almost be said to 
have acquired his Senatorship as the old priest of 
Diana at Nemi obtained his place by slaying his pre 
decessor. 1 For after the spring of 185 1, in which Sum 
ner was chosen Senator, the power and the life of 
Webster withered away. He still made speeches and 
held his followers together, but his day as a leader of 
the people had gone, never to return. It was a sad 
descent from that moral height in which the narra 
tive of his friend Ticknor places him, when the 
iniquity of Texas was first broached and first opposed 
by him. Poor Webster! " letting I dare not, wait 
upon I would, " until age and ambition turned his 
noble purposes into timid and selfish schemes, which 
he vainly sought to cover with the cloak of patriot 
ism. The. words of his Texas address, in which true 
patriotism glows, will henceforth rise up against him 
and the evil deeds in his last two years of unhappy 
life. 

Sumner had been preceded in Congress by his 
friends Dr. Palfrey, Charles Allen, and Horace Mann. 
The two last-named were chosen in 1848, Mann on 
the 3d of April, to fill the vacancy of John Quincy 

1 See Kenan s Pretrede Nemi mhis t&lt; Drarnes Philosophes" Paris, 
1888. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 249 

Adams, and Allen in November, at the regular elec 
tion. Mann favored the election of Winthrop, of 
Massachusetts, as Speaker, but Dr. Palfrey and Judge 
Allen voted against him, as Dr. Palfrey had done in 
December, 1847, when Mr. Winthrop was chosen. It 
was this vote of 1847 which called out the indignation 
of State street and the " Cotton Whigs " against Dr. 
Palfrey, and thus occasioned the inimitable satire of 
Lowell to fall on them in the " Biglow Papers." 
Reporting the speech of " Increase Doughface, 
Esquire," at a caucus in State street, Hosea Biglow 
represented this " Cotton Whig" as thus expressing 
himself : 

No ? Hez he ? He haint, though ? Wut ? Voted agin him ? 

If the bird of our country could ketch him, she d skin him. 

Who ever d ha thought sech a pisonous rig 

Would be run by a chap thet wuz chose fur a Wig ? 

" We knowed wut his principles wuz fore we sent him ? " 

Wut wuz ther in them from this vote to prevent him ? 

A marciful Providunce fashioned us holler, 

O purpose thet we might our principles swaller, 

Wer n t we gittin on prime with our hot and cold blowin , 

A condemnin the war whilst we kep it agoin ? 

Wut s your name ? Come, I see ye, you up-country feller, 

You ve put me out several times with your beller ; 

Out with it ! Wut ? Biglow ? I say nothin furder, 

That feller would like nothin better n a murder, 

He s a traitor, blasphemer, an wut ruther worse is, 

He puts all his ath ism in dreffle bad verses. 

Wy, he goes agin war, agin indirect taxes, 

Agin sellin wild lands cept to settlers with axes, 

Agin holdin slaves, though he knows its the corner 

Our libbaty rests on the mis able scorner ! " 

All these men were friends of Dr. Howe, Judge 



250 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Allen less intimate than the others and all were 
effective antagonists of the South in Congress. When 
Webster abandoned his principles in 1850, they all 
turned against him, and used their great influence in 
Massachusetts to destroy the hold he might have on 
the people of that State. Judge Allen was spec 
ially called upon to do this, for to him, as well as to 
S. C. Phillips, had Webster in 1844 imparted his sen 
timents concerning Texas and slavery, which Allen 
fully shared. 1 Both had been present when Webster 
composed and dictated, at his office on Tremont 
street, the address which has already been cited, and 
both had sought in September, 1846, to bring the 
Whigs of Massachusetts to the position of Webster 
in 1844. When, therefore, he abandoned that position 
himself, in March 1850, Mr. Phillips, Judge Allen, 
Dr. Howe and all their friends attacked Webster. 
At this time, or soon after Dr. Howe became an 
editor of the Boston Daily Commonwealth, of which 
Joseph Lyman was the responsible editor, and in 
which Mrs. Howe assisted her husband as literary 
and political contributor. And at all times Dr. 
Howe s office up stairs at 50 Bromfield street, was a 



1 So strong was the feeling on Judge Allen s part that he pro 
posed to withdraw from the electoral ticket for Clay in Massa 
chusetts, when the candidate wrote his fatal letter concerning annex 
ation. Mr. Phillips persuaded him not to do so ; but when Clay 
had been defeated he joined with Phillips in the movement for a 
State convention which Webster had initiated in the spring of 1844. 
These two " Conscience Whigs" were more in Webster s councils 
in November and December 1844 than any other men, and when 
Phillips in December wrote his " Appeal to the People of Massa 
chusetts on the Texas Question" (published by Little & Brown 
anonymously), Webster read it, revised and approved it,

rallying-point and meeting-place for all the political 
anti-slavery men of Massachusetts. In 1855-56 it 
became a center of efforts to make Kansas a free 
State, and it was there that John Brown first met Dr. 
Howe in 1857. i 

The extensive correspondence of Dr. Howe with 
Sumner and with Horace Mann from 1850 till the 
the death of his two friends, shows how much they 
depended on him for counsel, for action, and for 
reaching effectively the public ear. Howe was all the 
more serviceable to them and to the cause, for the 
reason that he had no political ambition, and never 
sought office or distinction for himself. He was con 
tent, as so many of the political abolitionists were, to 
work for the good of the cause, without seeking a 
recompense in glory or in salary. He gave freely of 
his own money, gave his time, and associated with 
men of all sorts who could help forward the good 
work. He took part in the " coalition" of Democrats 
and anti-slavery men (" Free-Soilers ") in 1850-53, as 
did Sumner and Mann and Henry Wilson ; and he 
was one of the first to join the newly formed Repub 
lican party in 1854-55, when the disintegrating wave 



1 Mrs. Howe tells me that after her return from Rome, where 
she had spent the winter of 1850-51, she and Dr. Howe had desks 
at the South Boston cottage (which she christened " Green Peace," 
from its verdure and quiet), and composed their papers for the 
Commonwealth in the same room, with occasional interchange of 
ideas. This newspaper was the successor of Elizur Wright s little 
Chronotype, of 1846-50, and also took the place of C. F. Adams s 
Boston Daily Whig (1845-48) and of Henry Wilson s Daily 
Republican, to all of which Dr. Howe contributed more or less. 
The Commonwealth was revived as a weekly in 1862, and still sur- 



252 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

of " Native Americanism " swept over the country, 
destroying the Whig party and weakening the Demo 
crats at the North. When Sumner was brutally 
attacked by Brooks of South Carolina in the Senate 
chamber and during the years of his illness and re 
covery, Dr. Howe was his faithful and judicious 
friend ; and when the old Whigs, the Democrats and 
the least progressive of the Republicans sought to 
defeat Sumner s reelection in 1862-63, Dr. Howe 
joined with his friends F. W. Bird, W. S. Robinson, 
Henry L. Pierce and many others in thwarting this 
combination against the radical Senator who favored 
the instant emancipation of the slaves as a war meas 
ure. By this time the famous " Bird Club," 1 of Bos 
ton had become a political power, and it was no 
unusual thing to see at its dinner-table on Saturdays 
the two Massachusetts Senators, Sumner and Wilson, 
Governor Andrew, half a dozen Congressmen, with 
Dr. Howe, Mr. Bird, George L. Stearns and many 
more of the radical Republicans of New England. 
Dr. Howe continued to dine with this club until his 
death in 1876. 



1 The Bird Club originated about 1850 in the dining together at 
George Young s Hotel in Boston of a few of the political anti- 
slavery men, who, like Francis William Bird of Walpole, were active 
in elections and campaigns. By 1856, when the Kansas troubles 
came on, it had become a large and powerful body of men, with no 
definite organization, who looked upon Mr. Bird as their friend, 
and brought other friends to sit at his weekly club-table. At one 
time perhaps loo men were members of this Round Table, which 
met weekly at Young s or Parker s, to dine together, With the 
election of Governor Andrew in 1860, they took charge of the State 
Government of Massachusetts, and controlled it for a dozen years, 
or until 1873. 



CHAPTER VII. 

THE KANSAS CONTEST AND JOHN BROWN. 

THE repeal of the Missouri Compromise by the 
Nebraska Act of 1854, opened the Territory of Kan 
sas, then twice as large as all New England, to the 
curse of slavery. In order to prevent its establish 
ment there, the anti-slavery men of New England 
formed a colonization company, which in 1854-55 
did something to provide Kansas with anti-slavery 
inhabitants. Dr. Howe entered warmly into this 
plan, as did many of his friends, but took no leading 
part in the Kansas contest until the spring of 1856, 
when he raised what was called the Faneuil Hall 
Committee, to supply the wants and sustain the 
courage of the Free-State men in Kansas. Dr. 
Howe said afterwards : 

I was connected with two Kansas committees. One was 
raised for the purpose of getting clothing and money for aiding 
the suffering inhabitants of Kansas; that was the express 
object of the committee of which I was chairman. Another 
committee of which I was a member, was raised for the gen 
eral purpose of aiding the inhabitants of Kansas in the defence 
of their freedom then invaded, and repelling invaders. The 
first was the Boston committee, usually called the Faneuil Hall 
Committee, inasmuch as the original meeting was at Faneuil 
Hall ; it had no official name ; it was not an incorporated body ; 

(253)

it was called just what people chose to call it. The other was 
the Massachusetts Kansas Committee. 

In fact he was also a member of the National Kan 
sas Committee, formed at Buffalo in 1856, with a 
member from each of the Northern States, and some 
times two ; and he had some share in raising the 
first large sum of money to buy arms for Kansas that 
was contributed in Boston in 1855 some thousands 
of dollars, which were expended in the purchase of 
Sharp s rifles. The Faneuil Hall Committee, organ 
ized in May, 1856, pledged itself to raise money for 
use "in a strictly lawful manner" in Kansas; but 
most of the other committees were not so scrupulous, 
and gave their money freely to arm the colonists 
who went out to defend the Free-State cause. The 
National Kansas Committee, which had its head 
quarters at Chicago, received and forwarded many 
of these arms, and in other ways aided the anti- 
slavery colonists ; but Dr. Howe s connection with it 
was little more than a nominal one. Of the Massa 
chusetts State Committee, however, he was a very 
active member in 1856-57, L and this took him to 
Kansas, and brought him into close relations with 
John Brown, the hero of Kansas and Virginia. Dr. 



1 Between May, 1856, and January, 1857, I passed through all 
the grades of these Kansas committees beginning in June, 1856, 
as Secretary of the Concord Town Committee ; then in July help 
ing to organize a county committee for Middlesex, of which I was 
Secretary ; then serving as Secretary to the Massachusetts State 
Kansas Committee, from December, 1856, until the committee dis 
solved in 185859 ; and, finally, serving upon the National Com 
mittee at its last meeting, in January, 1857, as proxy for Dr. 
Howe. F. B. S.

Howe made his acquaintance, as many of us did, in 
January, 1857 ; and, when the little civil war in Kan 
sas was virtually ended, in 1858, Dr. Howe joined, 
with a few others, in contributing money and arms 
for Brown s attack on slavery, first in Missouri in 
1858-59, and then in Virginia in October, 1859. In 
the winter of 1858 59, he thus briefly described 
Brown, in a note to John M. Forbes, of Boston : 

If you would like to hear an honest, keen, and veteran back 
woodsman disclose some plans for delivering our land from the 
curse of slavery, the bearer will do so. I think I know him 
well. He is of the Puritan militant order. 1 He is an enthu 
siast, yet cool, keen, and cautious. He has a martyr s spirit. 
He will ask nothing of you but the pledge that you keep to 
yourself what he may say. 

Brown and Dr. Howe were nearly of the same 
age Brown a year and a half older; they were much 
of the same build and figure, though very unlike in 
temperament and training. Brown was the last of 



1 Mrs. Howe in her memoir published in 1876, relates this strik 
ing anecdote: " I remember a conversation in which, in the strict 
est confidence, Dr. Howe told me of a wonderful man, an apostle, 
a Puritan of the old type, who had devoted himself to an elaborate 
plan for the emancipation of the Southern blacks, with the zeal 
and courage which ever characterize the saviors of mankind. The 
name of this person was confided to me at a much later date, but so 
vivid had the Doctor s portraiture of him been, that when, a year 
or two after this time, he came to my door, I said to him, " You 
are Captain John Brown?" to which he replied, "I am." Dr. 
Howe did not agree with the general opinion, then prevalent, which 
characterized John Brown s scheme of negro emancipation as in 
capable of execution. He insisted in after years that the plan had 
been a very able one, and that it s failure could not have been a 
foregone conclusion." 



256 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the Puritans; Howe was one of the Cavaliers, but with 
an enthusiasm for liberty as warm as Sidney s or 
Colonel Hutchinson s. Their likeness and their 
unlikeness drew them together, and there was none 
among his few New England intimates to whom 
Brown disclosed his secret plans more willingly than 
to Howe. Yet that latent conservatism in Howe s 
nature, of which I have spoken, sometimes came 
forth and drew him back from the extreme measures 
undertaken by this foreordained champion and 
martyr. Particularly was this so after a visit which 
Dr. Howe made to South Carolina in the spring of 
1859, on his return from Cuba, whither he had 
accompanied Theodore Parker. The letter above 
cited was given me by Dr. Howe, Feb. 5, 1859, just 
before he sailed for Cuba ; but when he visited the 
courteous planters of Carolina a few months later, 
and saw how peacefully they w r ere living among 
their slaves, he shrank from a conspiracy, like that of 
Brown, which might possibly bring every horror upon 
his Carolina friends. Consequently he had little to 
do with the final arrangements for Brown s Virginia 
campaign, though he did raise some money for it in 
the summer of 1859, and welcomed the eldest son of 
Brown, when he visited Boston that summer, in 
furtherance of his father s plans. 1 

1 In the examination of Dr. Howe by Jefferson Davis and other 
Senators at Washington (February 3, 1860), a letter from John 
Brown, Jr., was produced, dated Syracuse, N. Y., August 17, 
1859, addressed to John Henry Kagi, Brown s secretary, at Cham- 
bersburg, Pa., in which this son of John Brown, speaking of his 
father as friend Isaac, said: 

" While in Boston, I improved the time in making the acquaint 
ance of those staunch friends of our friend Isaac. First, called 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 257 

Dr. Howe s first knowledge of John Brown s Vir 
ginia plan was communicated to him by me in Feb 
ruary, 1858, upon my return from a visit to Gerrit 
Smith, at Peterboro, N. Y., where Brown had laid the 
whole scheme before Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Edwin 
Morton, and myself, with the request that we should 
make it known to Dr. Howe, Theodore Parker, and 



on Dr. H. , who, though I had no letter of introduction, received 

me most cordially. He gave me a letter to the friend who does 
business on Milk street. Went with him to his house in Medford 
and took dinner. The last word he said to me was, Tell friend 
(Isaac) that we have the. fttlltst confidence in his endeavor, whatever 
may be the result. " 

The examination then proceeded : 

Davis Was it in that month of August, 1859, you saw John 
Brown, Jr., in Boston ? 

Howe It would be impossible for me to recollect any further 
than that it was not in cold weather. 

D Did he introduce himself ? 

H He introduced himself. 

D Did you receive him as the son of old John Brown ? 

H I did, and was very glad to see him as the son of John 
Brown. 

D Did he tell you the object of his visit to Boston ? 

H He did not, 

D Did he tell you that he was there endeavoring to collect 
money ? 

H He did not. 

D Did he apply to you for money ? 

H He did not. 

D Do you remember having given him a letter to a gentleman 
who does business on Milk street ? 

H Very likely I may have done so. 

D Do you know to whom he refers ? 

H Mr. George L. Stearns. 

Dr. Howe said to me after his return from this examination, that 
he could have asked questions more difficult to answer. 



258 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

T. Wentworth Higginson, as he had just made it 
known to Frederick Douglass, at whose house in 
Rochester he had drawn up the " Provisional Consti 
tution," which he read to us at Mr. Smith s house. 
Brown soon after visited Boston, and talked over his 
plans more fully with Parker, Howe, Higginson, and 
George L. Stearns. The last-named gentleman and 
Gerrit Smith were the largest contributors to Brown s 
campaign fund, for which, first and last, Stearns gave 
in money and arms at least $8,000, and Smith, per 
haps, $1,000. In February, 1858, Brown had in pos 
session arms valued at $6,000, and all he needed in 
money, he said, was $1,000. With this small sum in 
hand he was ready to take the field and commence 
emancipation by force in the spring of 1858. Mr. 
Stearns acted as treasurer of this fund, and before 
the ist of May nearly the whole amount had been 
paid in or subscribed Stearns contributing $300, and 
the rest of our committee (six in all) smaller sums. 
It soon appeared that the amount named would be 
too small, and Brown s movements were embarrassed 
from lack of money before the disclosures of his false 
friend, Hugh Forbes, made it expedient to postpone 
the expedition to a more favorable time. Forbes was 
an Englishman of some military knowledge, acquired 
under Garibaldi in 1848-49, who had undertaken for 
hire to train Brown s men in tactics, and had done so 
in Iowa, for a short time. The money which he was 
to receive was not forthcoming after awhile, and 
Forbes began to write letters to Charles Sumner, Dr. 
Howe, and myself none of whom had then seen him 
demanding that we should pay him, and also depose 
Brown from the command of the expedition. These 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 259 

letters began to come before any of us knew Brown s 
plans, and were continued while Brown in the spring 
of 1858, was on his way (about May ist), with a dozen 
or twenty "shepherds," for the " market " at Chat 
ham in Canada, where he wished his Massachusetts 
friends to meet him. But just then came a letter to 
me from Forbes, followed by one to Dr. Howe, 
threatening to make the matter public. On the 2d of 
May, Dr. Howe, Mr. Stearns and myself met for the 
consultation on the new aspect of affairs presented by 
these letters from Washington, where Forbes then 
was. Theodore Parker was also consulted on the 
same day, and I wrote the result (May 5th) to Higgin- 
son as follows: 

" It looks as if the project must, for the present, be deferred, 
for I find by reading Forbes s epistles to the doctor (Howe) that 
he knows the details of the plan, and even knows (what very 
few do), that the doctor, Mr. Stearns, and myself are informed 
of it. How he got this knowledge is a mystery. He demands 
that Hawkins 1 be dismissed as agent, and himself or some 
other be put in his place, threatening otherwise to make the 
business public. Theodore Parker and G. L. Stearns think the 
plan must be deferred till another year; the doctor does not 
think so, and I am in doubt, inclining to the opinion of the two 
former." 

On the 7th of May Gerrit Smith wrote : " It seems 
to me that in these circumstances Brown must go no 
further, and so I write him. I never was convinced 
of the wisdom of this scheme. But as things now 
stand, it seems to me it would be madness to attempt 



J A name \" Nelson Hawkins ") assumed by Brown, who also 
called himself, at different times, " Shubael Morgan," " Isaac 
Smith," and, perhaps, by other names. 



260 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

to execute it. Colonel Forbes would make such an 
attempt a certain and most disastrous failure. I 
write Brown this evening. " On the 9th of May, 1858, 
Higginson w r rote to Parker a brief note from Brattle- 
boro, protesting against delay. " I regard any post 
ponement," he said, " as simply abandoning the pro 
ject ; for if we give it up now, at the command or 
threat of H. F., it will be the same next year. The 
only way is to circumvent the man somehow (if he 
cannot be restrained in his malice). When the thing 
is well started, who cares what he says ? " He soon 
after wrote more fully to Parker, giving many argu 
ments against delay. Parker replied: "If you knew 
all we do about Colonel Forbes, you would think 
differently. Can t you see the wretch in New York?" 
At the same time Dr. Howe wrote to Higginson : 
" T. P. will tell you about matters. They have held 
a different view from the one I have taken, which 
agrees mainly with yours. I think that the would-be 
traitor is now on the wrong track. I told him some 
truth, which he will think to be false (for he thinks 
evil), and he will probably be bungling about in the 
dark and hesitating until the period for his doing 
harm, has passed. Forbes has disclosed what he knows 
to Senator Seward, or says he has." A few days after 
this, Dr. Howe also admitted that the enterprise must 
be postponed. I was in almost daily consultation 
with him, and on the i8th of May I wrote to Higgin 
son : "Wilson as well as Hale and Seward, 1 and God 
knows how many more, have heard about the plot 



1 Henry Wilson, Senator from Massachusettes, John P. Hale, 
Senator from New Hampshire, and W. H. Seward, Senator from 
New York, were the persons here named.

from Forbes. To go in the face of this is mere mad 
ness, and I place myself fully on the side of Parker, 
Stearns, and Dr. Howe. Mr. Stearns and the doctor 
will see Hawkins in New York this week, and settle 
matters finally." On or before May 2oth, Mr. Stearns 
met Brown in New York by appointment, and wrote 
to Higginson from there that " we are all agreed " 
about the recall of these arms from Virginia " for 
reasons that cannot be written/ Previously Dr. 
Howe had thus replied to Senator Wilson s letter of 
Ma} 7 9th, in which he insisted that Brown s reported 
plans should be given up. 

BOSTON, May 12, 1858. 

DEAR SIR : I have just received your letter of the 9th. I 
understand perfectly your meaning". No countenance has been 
given to Brown for any operations outside of Kansas by the 
Kansas Committee. I had occasion, a few days ago, to send 
him an earnest message from some of his friends here, urging 
him to go at once to Kansas, and take part in the coming 
election, and throw the weight of his influence on the side of 
the right. There is in Washington a disappointed and 
malicious man, working with all the activity which hate and 
revenge can inspire, to harm Brown, and to cast odium upon 
the friends of Kansas in Massachusetts. You probably know 
him. He has been to Mr. Seward. Mr. Hale, also, can tell 
you something about him. God speed the right ! 

About the same time, Dr. Howe sent a final letter 
to Hugh Forbes, in which, among other things, he 

said : 

" I infer from your language that you have obtained 
(in confidence) some information respecting an expe 
dition which you think to be commendable, provided 
you could manage it, but which you will betray and 



262 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

denounce if Brown does not give it up ! You are, sir, 
the guardian of your own honor ; but I trust that for 
your children s sake, at least, you will never let your 
passion lead you to a course that might make them 
blush. In order, however, to disabuse you of any 
lingering notion that I, or any of the members of the 
late Kansas Committee (whom I know intimately) 
have any responsibility for Captain Brown s actions, 
I wish to say that the very last communication I sent 
to him was in order to signify the earnest wish of 
certain gentlemen, whom you name as his supporters, 
that he should go at once to Kansas and give his aid 
in the coming elections. Whether he will do so or 
not, we do not know." x 

At the time Mr. Stearns met Brown in New York 
City, May 20, 1858, it was arranged between them 
that, from that time forward, the custody of certain 
rifles which had become Stearns s property, should 
be in Brown s hands as the agent, not of the Kansas 
Committee, but of Stearns alone. It so happened 
that Gerrit Smith, who seldom visited Boston, was 
going there late in May, to deliver an address before 
the Peace Society. He arrived and took rooms at 
the Revere House, where (May 24, 1858) the secret 
committee, organized in March, and consisting of 
Smith, Parker, How r e, Higginson, Stearns, and San- 
born, held a meeting to consider the situation. It 
had already been decided to postpone the attack, 
and the arms had been placed under a temporary 
interdict, so that they could only be used, for the 



1 See "Life and Letters of John Brown," p. 459. (Boston, 
Roberts Brothers, 1885.) 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 263 

present, in Kansas. The questions remaining were 
whether Brown should be required to go to Kansas 
at once, and what amount of money should be raised 
for him in future. Of the six members of the com 
mittee only one (Higginson) was absent, and as this 
was the only occasion when Smith acted personally 
with all his associates, who met in his chamber at the 
Revere House, he was made chairman of the meet 
ing. It was unanimously resolved that Brown ought 
to go to Kansas at once. As soon as possible after 
this, Brown visited Boston (May 3ist), and while there 
held a conversation with Higginson, who made a 
record of it at the time saying that Brown was full 
of regret at the decision of his friends to postpone 
the attack till the winter or spring of 1859, when the 
secret committee would raise for him two or three 
thousand dollars ; " he meantime to blind Forbes by 
going to Kansas, and to transfer the property so as 
to relieve the Kansas Committee of responsibility, 
and they in future to know his plans." " On probing 
Brown," Higginson goes on, " I found that he ... 
considered delay very discouraging to his thirteen 
men, and to those in Canada. Impossible to begin 
in the autumn ; and he would not lose a clay [he 
finally said] if he had three hundred dollars ; it 
would not cost twenty-five dollars apiece to get his 
men from Ohio, and that was all he needed. The 
knowledge that Forbes could give of his plan would 
be injurious, for he wished his opponents to under 
rate him ; but still . . . the increased terror pro 
duced would perhaps counterbalance this, and it 
would not make much difference. If he had the 
means he would not lose a day." He complained 



264 DR. S. G. HOWE 

that some of his Eastern friends were not men of 
action ; that they were intimidated by Senator Wil 
son s letter, and magnified the obstacles. Still it was 
essential that they should not think him reckless ; 
" as they held the purse, he was powerless without 
them, having spent nearly everything received this 
campaign, on account of delay a month at Chat 
ham, etc." Higginson notes down a few days later 
that Dr. Howe told him Brown left Boston, June 3, 
with five hundred dollars in gold, and liberty to 
retain all the arms, and that " he went off in good 
spirits." 

Brown spent the following season in Kansas where 
he did much anti-slavery work ; and in the winter of 
1858-59, while Dr. Howe was going to Cuba and 
returning, he brought out a party of twelve freemen, 
whom he had forcibly emancipated in Missouri, and 
conveyed them safely to Canada, near Detroit. He 
then came to New England for the last time, saw all 
the members of his secret committee except Theo 
dore Parker, who was then in England, and about 
June 2, 1859, left Boston for Virginia, by way of 
Ohio, Chambersburg, Penn., and the Kennedy farm 
in Maryland. He set out from Chambersburg for 
Harper s Ferry June 3oth, and was on the ground early 
in July. Dr. Howe had aided him to raise the 
$2,000 which found needful for his expedition, but 
he had not been active in the matter, tie again con 
tributed in August ; for Brown s secretary, Kagi, in 
a note to John Brown, written August 27th, says : " I 
to-day received the inclosed letter and check [fifty 
dollars]." This was the money sent on by Dr. Howe 
about August 25th, and the letter was this ; 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 265 

DEAR FRIEND : I begin the investment with fifty dollars, 
and will try to do more through friends. Our friend from Con 
cord called with your note. DOCTOR. 

I was the " friend from Concord," and on the 3oth 
of August I wrote to Brown from Springfield : 

" S. G. Howe has sent you fifty dollars in a draft 
on New York, and I am expecting to get more from 
other sources (perhaps some here), and will make up 
to you the three hundred dollars, if I can, as soon as 
I can." It was made up a few weeks later, Gerrit 
Smith contributing $100. This amount, with $600 
contributed in October by Francis Jackson Merriam, 
of Boston, was the last gift by his friends to John 
Brown, before he made his foray at Harper s Ferry, 
October 1 6, 1859. Seldom have men engaged in so 
formidable an undertaking with such slender pecu 
niary resources. 

When the blow had been struck and the desperate 
enterprise had failed, there was the greatest excite 
ment throughout the country. Men knew not what 
to think of these strange events, and the wildest 
words were uttered by the calmest men. 

Dr. Howe shrank at first from acknowledging his 
connection with Brown, and distressed some of his 
friends thereby ; for he was overcome by the con 
templation of results which he might have foreseen, 
but did not. He was charged, in company with 
many of his friends and others whom he never saw, 
or scarcely knew, with all manner of dark and bloody 
plots, most of which he could truthfully disclaim as 
beyond his knowledge. The New York IferaM obtained 
some of Forbes s correspondence, which it published, 
along with the letters found in Brown s possession 



266 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

when captured. To show what the public were then 
asked to believe, let me quote an article from the 
New York Herald late in October, 1859 : 

THE EXPOSURE OF THE NIGGER WORSHIPING INSURREC 
TIONISTS. 

If the crafty schemers who encouraged old Osawatomie 
Brown to carry out his insane project of seizing on the Harper s 
Ferry armory, distributing arms to the slaves, inciting them to 
insurrection and revolutionizing the Government, had hugged 
themselves into the delusion that they had covered up their 
tracks and were safe from the chances of exposure, the corres 
pondence which we have published within the last few days 
must have dispelled that illusion. They are, one and all of 
them, known now to the Government and to the country as 
sneaking conspirators, who, with a guilty knowledge of the 
plans of the crazy old fanatic whose earthly career is fast 
drawing to a close, managed to keep themselves perhaps clear 
of direct responsibility to the law, but at the same time gave to 
Brown countenance, encouragement, and support. The law 
wisely and justly brands with equal guilt the accessory before 
the act and the actors in the crime. And in the first category 
we find the names of Senator Seward, of New York ; Senators 
Wilson and Sumner, of Massachusetts ; Senator Hale and ex- 
Governor Fletcher, of New Hampshire; Governor Chase, of 
Ohio ; Hon. Gerrit Smith, ex-member of Congress ; Rev. Joshua 
Leavitt, of New York ; Horace Greeley, of the Tribune ; Mr. 
Lawrence, a prominent merchant, and Dr. Howe, a physician 
of high standing in Boston ; Dr. Bailey, late of the Washington 
Era; Dr. Jesse Bowen, of Iowa City, and F. B. Sanborn, a 
graduate of Harvard, and now a leading teacher in Massachu 
setts. This is no list of low born, ignorant, and despised 
traitors to the Union and its States. It is no concoction of 
local disaffection. It shows that the treason had infested all 
classes, from the desperate adventurer to the occupant of the 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 267 

Senatorial hall. The whole plot was fully known for the last 
year and a half to Seward, Sumner, Hale, Chase, Fletcher, Gid- 
dings, Sanborn, Howe, and the leading Abolitionists and black 
Republicans on both sides of the Atlantic. It is impossible to 
resist the conviction that they all knew and approved of it. 
That they knew is clearly proven by the correspondence of 
Brown himself, and of Forbes, the British Abolitionist whom 
they employed to train Brown s men in guerilla tactics. That 
they approved is not only shown affirmatively by the fact of their 
supplying Brown with money and arms, but is as clearly 
shown, indirectly, by the fact of their not denouncing him. 
Here were Senators of the United States, members of Congress, 
Governors of States, merchants, and prominent men in New 
York, New England, and the West, who kept in their own 
guilty breasts a secret which might have involved, and which 
actually seemed to involve, the very existence of the Govern 
ment ; whereas, a word from them would have stopped the 
conspiracy in its very inception. 

This was the tone of the champions of slavery. On 
the other side was the argument from morality itself, 
pungently stated thus by Elizur Wright, of Boston : 

Look here, my Honorable Proxy for compiling Statute Books, 
if a man with wit and limbs, but too lazy or too mean to work 
out his own honest living, appropriates to himself the fruits of 
another man s toil, he is a criminal, isn t he, whether you have 
described his crime in your statute book or not ? Very well. 
You describe it and send a sheriff. He is too much for the 
sheriff and knocks him down. Is he less a criminal for that ? 
You send a judge. He bribes that dignitary. You send a par 
son. He gags him with bread and cheese. You send lawyers, 
and, for a pinch of snuff, they swear his blacknes sis all white. 
He laughs the very idea of punishment to scorn. Has he be 
come less a criminal by all that ? By and by he allures some 
body into a partnership of his iniquity. Nobody interferes to 
enforce the law and the letter thereof dies and is buried. 



268 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Multiplied criminals walk abroad, and, finding it too tedious 
to appropriate products, appropriate the producers. Those 
that resist they kill, adding murder to robbery, ad libitum ; 
and for the convenience of doing so write statutes to that 
effect. Nobody rebels. Is the crime growing less, O sapient 
legislator ? 

Law, so called, is exactly bottom side up as to this now im 
mense partnership of criminals. Is the moral nature of their 
conduct changed by that fact ? They have died and left their 
crime to their children and their children s children, garnished 
with piety and polite literature. Has it, therefore, become 
righteous per se . ? Out of millions who do not think it right 
eous, there is not one who will risk his life to rescue one of its 
victims. Does it follow that it is criminal to rescue one of its 
victims ? I say it is the holiest thing a man can do and as 
sure as there is a hereafter, it is the sanest, provided he has 
any talent for it. I think Brown and his followers had remark 
able talent for it. They, at the cost of entering heaven some 
years earlier, placed themselves on the side of law, order, and 
honesty. I think they deserve to be imitated by all the moral 
and physical force in the world, till man-stealers are not con 
sidered more sacred than pickpockets. 

In this sharp conflict against crime installed as 
law, with armies and dignitaries of all sorts to uphold 
it, the friends of John Brown were called upon to 
exercise prudence ; and they did so. Without dis 
claiming their opinion of Brown, and their wish that he 
had succeeded, they had first to prevent the political 
harm that timid statesmen, like Henry Wilson, feared 
might result from their conspiracy. Most of them 
were active, voting Republicans, though none were 
leaders in that party ; for the charges of the Herald 
were mere blank cartridges shot off to alarm the sup 
porters of Sevvard, Sumner, and the other leaders. 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 269 

Such was the state of things when Dr. Howe pub 
lished this letter : 

BOSTON, November 14, 1859. 

Rumor has mingled my name with the events at Harper s 
Ferry. So long as it rested on such absurdities as letters writ 
ten to me by Colonel Forbes or others, it was too idle for 
notice. But when complicity is distinctly charged by one of 
the parties engaged, my friends beseech me to define my posi 
tion ; and I consent, the less reluctantly, because I divest myself 
of what, in time, might be considered an honor, and I want no 
undeserved ones. 

The outbreak at Harper s Ferry was unforeseen and unex 
pected by me ; nor does all my previous knowledge of John 
Brown enable me to reconcile it with his characteristic pru 
dence, and his reluctance to shed blood, or excite servile insur 
rection. It is still to me a mystery and a marvel. As to the 
heroic man who planned and led that forlorn hope, my relations 
with him in former times were such as no man ought to be 
afraid or ashamed to avow. If ever my testimony to his high 
qualities can be of use to him or his, it shall be forthcoming at 
the fitting time and place. But neither this nor any other testi 
mony shall be extorted for unrighteous purposes, if I can 
help it. 

There are, among the statutes of our Union, certain weapons, 
concealed as are the claws of a cat, in a velvet paw, which are 
seemingly harmless, but are really deadly instruments by which 
we of the North may be forced to uphold and defend the bar 
barous system of human slavery. For instance, a dishonest 
judge, in the remotest South, or in far off California, may, upon 
the affidavit of any white person, that the testimony of any citi 
zen of Massachusetts is wanted in a criminal suit, send a mar 
shal, who may take such citizen before the judge, and there, 
among strangers, force him to recognize for his appearance in 
court, or be committed to jail. Upon the stand, such expressions 
of opinion may be drawn from him as will mark him for an 
Abolitionist, and turn him out of the Court House to the tender

mercies of a people once called chivalrous and generous, but 
among whom the love of fair play seems rapidly dying out. 

Such martyrdom might be coveted by some, if any high pur 
pose were to be gained by it ; but it is especially undesirable 
when the testimony is not sought with open and righteous, but 
with false and revengeful purpose. I am told by high legal 
authority that Massachusetts is so trammeled by the bonds of 
the Union, that, as matters now stand, she cannot, or dare not, 
protect her citizens from such forcible extradition; and that 
each one must protect himself, as he best may. Upon that hint 
I shall act ; preferring to forego anything rather than the right 
to free thought and free speech. 

Yours faithfully, S. G. HOWE. 

The " legal authority " here cited was that of John 
A. Andrew, a year afterwards elected Governor of 
Massachusetts on the distinct issue that he was a 
friend of John Brown and of his main purpose to 
destroy slavery, though not a promoter of his con 
spiracy. On the 1 2th of November, two days before 
this letter of Howe s was written, I consulted Mr. 
Andrew (who had previously made the same dis 
closure to Dr. Howe), and the result of my con 
ference was thus communicated by me to Colonel 
Higginson, then living at Worcester : 

BOSTON, November 13, 1859. 

DEAR FRIEND : I had a talk with Andrew last night, who 
showed me the statute about witnesses. It appears that by a 
law of August 8, 1846, a witness whose evidence is deemed 
material by any United States judge, may be arrested by a 
warrant from a judge, without any previous summons, and 
taken before that judge to give bond for his appearing to testify. 
This leaves no room for a writ of habeas corpus, unless the 
State judges are willing to take the ground that the statute is 
unconstitutional, or that it means the process shall run only 
within the judge s district, or circuit; and Andrew does not 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 271 

believe, nor do I, that our judges are ready to take either 
ground. Therefore, if arrested, a witness can only be released 
by a tumult. This may do very well in Worcester, but is rather 
precarious in Boston, and, therefore, Phillips thinks there should 
be some concert of action between those likely to be arrested, 
and some decision come to about what shall be done in case of 
arrest. Would your Worcester people go down to Boston to 
take Dr. Howe or Wendell Phillips out of the marshal s hands? 

But, first of all, the public attention must be called through 
the papers to this singular law, which is unknown to most law 
yers. Can you set some young (or old) lawyer to look it up, 
and write articles about it for your city papers ? I will try 
to get the Springfield Republican to do the same thing, and, if 
possible, the Boston papers and the Tribune ; and, through my 
brother, the New Hampshire papers. Thus preparation would 
be made for any action which might be taken under it. 

This preparation was made through the news 
papers; but, to avoid all possibility of arrest, Dr. 
Howe followed up his letter by retiring to Canada 
for a few weeks. His letter excited the most adverse 
comment, as will appear from another letter of mine, 
written to a warm friend of Brown, who did not 
understand Dr. Howe s position, and supposed he 
was yielding to the storm that raged against all anti- 
slavery men. I wrote (November 17, 1859), as fol 
lows : 

How differently people look at things ! Yesterday my 
brother, George Walker, wrote me that Dr. Howe s letter was 
" the height of imprudence " ; to-day you call it " the extreme 
of baseness ; " I don t think it either, though I am a little sorry- 
it was written. I do not think the time has yet come for de 
claring the whole truth about Brown ; better the numbers, tne 
names, and the plans of his accomplices should be unknown, 
for then they can work in the same way hereafter if they 
choose. I don t see why it is any worse to conceal the facts 



272 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

now than before the outbreak ; provided that Brown and his 
men do not suffer by such concealment. What has been pru 
dence is prudence still, and may be for years to come. But if 
any person wishes to come out and declare himself in Brown s 
plot, he would have a right to do so, however we might regard 
the prudence of it no right at all to implicate others. To do 
that now would not only be an abuse of confidence, but, so far 
as a well-meaning man can be base, would be the " extreme of 
baseness." At the same time no fear of an exposure would 
drive me, or any right-thinking man into a course which he 
disapproved. My action will be directed, not by considerations 
about myself or any other person ; but by what seems to me the 
best good of the cause. Dr. Howe has not acted in all ways as 
I should have done, neither have you ; but so long as each 
person acts for himself \tz. must allow such diversities. If, 
however, the Doctor or yourself should act so as to compromise 
others, I should have a much stronger feeling about that. 

I suppose you know that Dr. Howe and Mr. Stearns are in 
Canada ; at least, so I am informed. I got to-day a letter from 
Miller, Gerrit Smith s son-in-law, saying that E. Morton is on 
his way to Europe, and Mr. Smith too unwell to attend to any 
business. Hoyt writes that preparations are making at Charles- 
town to summon witnesses from hereabouts; and that Sennott 
was asked by Hunter where Sanborn lived. 1 I have no inten 
tion of leaving Massachusetts at present. We talk of a meet 
ing here, in Concord, on the day of Brown s execution do you 
know anything to prevent it ? 

No attempt was made to arrest Howe, Sanborn, or 
other persons until the winter following. At that sea- 



1 The persons above named were George H. Hoyt, the young 
lawyer who went from Boston to defend John Brown, George 
Sennott (an adopted son of Colonel Miller, Dr. Howe s comrade 
in Greece), a Boston attorney, who defended the companions of 
Brown, and Andrew Hunter, the prosecuting attorney at Charles- 
town, in Virginia.

son, Congress having met, and a committee of the Sen 
ate, with Mason, of Virginia, at its head, and Jefferson 
Davis one of its members, having been appointed to 
inquire into the conspiracy of Brown, Dr. Howe and 
Mr. Stearns came back from Canada, and consulted 
with their friends in Boston, as will be seen by the 
following letter to Colonel Higginson. I had previ 
ously written urging our friends to return, although 
Montgomery Blair, and others in Washington and 
Virginia, friendly to our cause, advised staying out 
of the country : 

CONCORD, Dec. 20, 1859. 

DEAR FRIEND : Do you know that John A. Andrew has 
five letters written by you which ought to be in your possession, 
as my own are in mine ? On Saturday and Sunday I had con 
ferences with Dr. Howe and Mr, Stearns, and with Wendell 
Phillips and Andrew. It was resolved by Howe, Stearns, and 
myself that we would not go to Washington to testify, but 
would do so in Massachusetts, fearing that the summons was 
but a Virginia trap. Accordingly, we have written to our 
Senators at Washington that they must propose a commission 
for taking evidence in Massachusetts, and thus make this 
issue : " If you want the bodies ot Massachusetts Abolitionists, 
you can t have them ; if you want their evidence, that they will 
give in their own State." This ought to be a good issue for 
our people, and Wilson ought to make it. If you approve this 
course, please agitate among your people to produce a senti 
ment in its favor, as we are doing here. It is thought best not 
to publish it in the papers just yet, till we hear from Washing 
ton. My own plan is to receive the summons, if it comes, and 
petition the committee to hear my evidence here, because I, an 
avowed Abolitionist and friend of Brown, cannot be safe in a 
city so near Virginia, where the Senate does not protect its own 
members, but allows one to be assaulted and another threatened 
with hanging. 



274 DR - s - G - HOWE. 

Howe will probably return to Canada. Harriet Tubman x 
is in Boston, but soon goes to Canada. 

Yours ever, F. B. SANBORN. 

Two weeks later (January 2, 1860), I again wrote 
to Higginson from Concord, having in the meantime 
visited New Hampshire, where my friends offered to 
protect me from arrest if I would stay. Higginson 
had not been summoned, but it was supposed he 
would be : 

I am still firm in the faith not to go to Washington, not see 
ing any good that will result from it, but a chance of evil. TesN 
ing the law is a side issue ; there are a thousand better ways 
of spending a year in warfare against slavery than by lying in a 
Washington prison. If I were you I should decline to go. 
Howe thinks he may go ; Stearns not. Charles Brace spent 
Sunday with me; he is stanch for John Brown, and says at the 
West there is great sympathy for him ; that Schurz 2 told him 
the Republicans are stronger in Wisconsin for his effort. Wil 
son got some wholesome truth while he was in Massachusetts, 
but he is acting in a craven way. Sumner is entirely different. 

These letters, hastily written at the time, may 
serve to show the state of feeling and the course of 
events. Brown was tried and executed and, less 
than two years after, the armies of the nation were 



1 This was a courageous fugitive slave, and friend of John 
Brown, who was not supposed to be safe from capture, except in 
Canada. 

3 Carl Schurz, afterwards Senator from Missouri, member of the 
Cabinet, etc., was then a Republican leader in Wisconsin. Mr. 
Brace was the founder of the Children s Aid Society in New York, 
and was in Concord to present the claims of his great charity. He 
died in Europe in 1890. Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson were 
then the Senators from Massachusetts, men of very different fiber, 
though both were sincere anti- slavery men.

marching into Virginia, singing the John Brown song : 

" He s gone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord, 
His soul is marching on." 

Never was a martyrdom more quickly followed by 
the world s recognition of a martyr. On the day of 
his execution Dr. Howe was in Canada, pacing his 
room at Montreal, weeping and fretting that lie 
could do nothing more for his old friend ; while at 
Concord, Alcott, Emerson, Thoreau, and the good 
people generally, were holding a funeral service for 
the death of a martyr. Later in the winter, as we 
have seen, Dr. Howe and Mr. Stearns went to 
Washington and testified before the Senate com 
mittee. The evidence given was not very serviceable 
to the slaveholders, who had hoped to implicate the 
leaders of the Republican party in the plot of Brown; 
but they were struck with the openness with which 
these witnesses and others avowed that they meant 
to destroy slavery if they could, and in every way they 
could. Jefferson Davis, and Mason, of Virginia, in 
their majority report for this committee, quote from 
J. R. Giddings, Dr. Howe, and Mr. Stearns, and thus 
introduce the words of Brown s chief pecuniary sup 
porter : l 



1 As mention has been made of other witnesses whom this com 
mittee would have heard if it could, I may say that Colonel Hig- 
ginson was never summoned, Gerrit Smith was an inmate of the 
Utica Asylum, and incapable of testifying ; Frederick Douglass and 
Edwin Morton evaded arrest by visiting England. In regard to 
other persons, the report makes this statement : 

" Before closing, the committee deem it proper to state that 
four persons summoned as witnesses, to wit : John Brown, Jr., cf 
Ohio, James Redpath, of Massachusetts, Frank B. Sanborn, of 
Massachusetts, and Thaddeus Hyatt, of New York, failing or 



276 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

As a further exposition of the views entertained by those 
devotees to the so-styled " cause of freedom," the committee 
refer to the evidence of George L. Stearns. This gentleman 
was, as shown by his testimony, one of the most active and 
successful workers in that " cause." Of his views as to the 
legitimate use of money contributed to this " cause," we 
have this expression : 

" From first to last, I understood John Brown to be a man 
who was opposed to slavery, and, as such, that he would take 
every opportunity to free slaves where he could ; I did not 
know in what way ; I only knew that from the fact of his having 
done it in Missouri in the instance referred to ; I furnished him 
with money because I considered him as one who would be of 
use in case such troubles arose as had arisen previously in 
Kansas; that was my object in furnishing the money; I did 
not ask him what he was to do with it, nor did I suppose he 
would do anything that I should disapprove." 

To the question " Do you disapprove of such a transac 
tion as that at Harper s Ferry," he answered : 



refusing to appear before the committee, warrants were issued by 
order of the Senate for their arrest. Of these, Thaddeus Hyatt 
only was arrested ; and on his appearance before the Senate, still 
refusing obedience to the summons of the committee, he was by 
order of the Senate committed to the jail of the District of Colum 
bia. In regard to the others, it appeared by the return of the 
marshal of the northern district of Ohio, as deputy of the Sergeant- 
at-Arms, that John Brown, Jr., at first evaded the process of the 
Senate, and afterwards, with a number of other persons, armed 
themselves to prevent his arrest. The marshal further reported in 
his return that Brown could not be arrested unless he was author 
ized in like manner to employ force. Sanborn was arrested by a 
deputy of the Sergeant-at-Arms, and afterwards released from 
custody by the Judges of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts on 
habeas corpus. Redpath, by leaving his State, or otherwise con 
cealing himself, successfully evaded the process of the Senate. 

11 And the committee ask to be discharged from the further con 
sideration of the subject," 



POLITICAL CONFLICT. 277 

" I should have disapproved of it if I had known of it ; but I 
have since changed my opinion ; I believe John Brown to be 
the representative man of this century, as Washington was of 
the last the Harper s Ferry affair, and the capacity shown by 
the Italians for self-government, the great events of this age. 
One will free Europe, and the other America." 

The remark was prophetic, and the names of Gari 
baldi and of John Brown will be coupled more and 
more, as the men who best exemplified, in the two 
hemispheres, the heroism that the cause of liberty 
has called forth in our century. Garibaldi succeeded, 
John Brown seemed to fail, yet greater success fol 
lowed the defeat of the Puritan than the victory of 
the Italian hero. Dr. Howe lived to see the cause of 
John Brown triumphant in America, as the cause of 
Botzaris had triumphed in Greece. He regretted 
the aid he gave to that old hero no more than he 
regretted the support he had given to the country 
men of Botzaris in their direst need. He heard with 
the most solemn approval, that strophe which Julia 
Ward Howe chanted in the midst of contending 
armies to the music of the "John Brown Song": 

I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnished rows of steel ; 
As ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall 

deal; 

Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel, 
Since God is marching on. 



NOTE. As the Civil War practically extinguished slavery, it 
seems best to terminate the account of Dr. Howe s political life 
here, and to consider his labors in the war period as a part of his 
later philanthropic work.

Ah, is it rest ? we ask, 
Or, traced by knowledge more divine,

Had but those boundless fields of blue 

One darkened sphere like this ; 
But what has heaven for thee to do 

In realms of perfect bliss ? 

No cloud to lift, no mind to clear, 

No rugged path to smooth, 
No struggling soul to help and cheer, 

No mortal grief to soothe !

CHAPTER I. 

THE CIVIL WAR AND ITS MEANING FOR DR. HOWE. 

THE outbreak of the great Rebellion of the Slave- 
masters, in 1861, brought no dismay to Dr. Howe 
any more than to Wendell Phillips. They saw in it 
the beginning of the end of negro slavery, and they 
welcomed the conflict, with all its possibilities of 
national humiliation, and personal ruin, and the sor 
row of bereaved families. Their first thought was 
that which Tennyson so well uttered at the opening 
of a much less momentous struggle the Crimean 
war. 

" I wake to the higher aims 

Of a land that has lost for a little her lust of gold, 
And love of a peace that was full of wrongs and shames, 
Horrible, hateful, monstrous, not to be told ; 
Then hail, once more, to the banner of battle unrolled ! 
Though many a light shall darken and many shall weep, 
Yet God s just wrath shall be wreaked on a giant liar ; 
And many a darkness into the light shall leap, 
And the heart of a people beat with one desire." 

When the desire of the Northern people for na 
tional unity and freedom burst forth in April, 1861, 
with a fervor which made it the universal reiteration 
of Webster s grand war-cry, " Liberty and Union, 

(281)

now and forever, one and inseparable," Dr. Howe 
was in his sixtieth year, and had passed the age for 
military service. His uncertain health, moreover, 
made it impossible for him to bear the risks and ex 
posures of camp life. But his energy and experience 
were immediately placed at the disposal of the Gov 
ernment. As a member of the Sanitary Commission 
he did much service, and his good counsels and gen 
erous cooperation were long remembered by those 
who then labored with him to alleviate the horrors 
of war. Among these was his ancient friend Miss 
Dix, whose life, admirably written by Francis Tiffany, 
discloses the large share Dr. Howe had in her first 
efforts to ameliorate the condition of the insane. In 
this later work of providing hospitals and nursing 
for the sick and wounded, the two friends, almost of 
equal age 1 accomplished much, but the labors and 
cares of army life were too much for both of them. 
It was otherwise with the practical tasks of Emancipa 
tion, the first of which was to prepare the public mind 
for the reversal of the whole national policy in regard 
to slavery as it had been enforced for forty years. 
Dr. Howe threw himself into this movement with all 
the zeal of youth and all the wisdom of age. After 
his preliminary service in the Sanitary Commission 
was over, and before the war had continued five 
months, he called a meeting of anti-slavery men at 
his office in Boston ; out of which grew the Emanci 
pation League, the reestablishment of the Common 
wealth newspaper as its organ, and many of the active

influences which, in 1862-63, brought on the irreversi 
ble decree of President Lincoln, abolishing slavery, 
under the "war powers" of the National Govern 
ment. I find among my old papers this record of the 
meeting : 

BOSTON, Sept. 5, 1861. 

A meeting called for this day was held at Dr. Howe s room, 
22 Bromfield street, to take into consideration measures tend 
ing to the Emancipation of the Slaves as a War Policy. Pres 
ent : James Freeman Clarke, Wm. Henry Channing, Wm. Lloyd 
Garrison, Thomas H. Webb, Edmund Ouincy, James D. Whelp- 
ley, Samuel G. Howe, F. W. Bird, Wendell Phillips, Gro. L. 
Stearns. 1 The subscriber was requested to invite you to attend 
an adjourned meeting at the same room, on Tuesday the 
loth inst., at 3 P. M. 

(Signed) G. L. STEARNS.

Dr. Howe entered actively into the campaign for 
Emancipation, and had been in Washington laboring 
with President Lincoln again and again, during the 
military preponderance of McClellan, which was felt 



1 With a single exception, these were the names of prominent 
emancipationists in Boston. Garrison, Phillips, and Edmund 
Quincy were of the extreme non-voting Abolitionists; Howe, Bird, 
and Stearns were political anti-slavery men, friends of Charles 
Sumner and members of the Bird Club; Clarke and Channing (the 
latter a nephew of the great Dr. Channing) were Unitarian clergy 
men, who had separated from their sect more or less on the slavery 
question; and Dr. T. H. Webb was the faithful, hard-working Sec 
retary of the New England Emigrant Aid Company, who had done 
more for the freedom of Kansas than all his associates in that com 
pany put together. In the " Memoir of W. L. Garrison" by his 
sons, vol. iv. , p. 48, the date given for the formation of the Eman 
cipation League is December, 1861 ; but this note shows that the 
idea originated with Dr. Howe as early as August of that year.

by all the anti-slavery rnen to be friendly to the con 
tinuance of slavery. The turning-point in the na 
tional administration was thus marked by him in 
this letter to his friend Mr. Bird : 

U. S. SANITARY COMMISSION, 
WASHINGTON, D. C., March 5, 1862. 

MY DEAR BIRD : I never want to be glad alone, and I 
hasten to communicate to you the cause of my present joy. 
The fact, long ago suspected by the instinct of the people, be 
gins to get through the skull of the " powers that be." An 
egregious blunder of McClellan, which made a botch and fail 
ure of the late proposed forward march, has convinced the 
President that he is utterly incompetent to the task of handling 
a great army. There is a great fight going on over him, and I 
do not doubt that, though his fall may be delayed, it will come 
soon. 1 I have long thought he was a humbug (an unintentional 
one), and I think the more he stirs now to defend himself, the 
more plainly will he show his incompetency. 

The President has been long on the anxious seat; but has, at 
last, had a change of heart, and has set his face steadily Zion- 
ward, though he is as yet rather ashamed of his Lord. He 
considers slavery to be a great stumbling-block in the way of 
human progress, and especially of this country. He feels that 
whoever has a hand in its removal will stand out before poster 
ity as a benefactor of his race. Why in the world, then, does 
he not " speak out in meetin " and relieve his mind ? Simply 
because of his fatal habit of procrastinating ; he puts off and 
puts off the evil day of effort, and stands shivering with his 
hand on the string of the shower-bath. He has, however, gone 
so far as even to make up a message to Congress, which, if 
sent, will prove to be a bomb-shell. If he is not further de 
moralized by victories, he will be brought up to the scratch. 
As to Congress, there are a few earnest and disinterested 



1 McClellan was removed from the sole command March n, 
1862, within a week after this letter. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 285 

patriots, but they could be carried off in an omnibus ; and if, 
after their departure, some Guy Fawkes could successfully 
explode his mine, there would be no great loss to this world, 
though, doubtless, a sudden increase of the population of 
Hades. 

Do you think of going to Fortress Monroe ? I shall prob 
ably be at liberty to leave on Saturday, though perhaps not 
until Wednesday next. 

The President s Message thus foreshadowed was 
sent to Congress the next day ; it contained a 
proposition for the gradual abolition of slavery, with 
compensation from the National Government to the 
States which might adopt such a measure. Congress 
passed the desired vote, 1 yet nothing resulted from 
it at home by reason of the pro-slavery feeling in 
the border States ; but abroad it began to " turn the 
current of popular feeling " in favor of the North. 

Addressing the Emancipation League in Boston 
four days later, Phillips welcomed the message, and, 
quoting from Dr. Howe s letter, said: "If the Presi 
dent has not entered Canaan, he has turned his face 
Zionward." A year afterward, Dr. Howe, with Robert 
Dale Owen and James McKay, were appointed by 
Secretary Stanton a "Freedmen s Inquiry Commis 
sion " to consider what should be done for the slaves 
already emancipated. In course of this inquiry he 
had occasion to consult his friend Prof. Agassiz as to 
the physiologic and ethnologic future of the negro 



1 The measure received the President s signature, April 10, 1862, 
and on the i6th of April he signed the bill abolishing slavery in the 
District of Columbia, with compensation to the owners. A few 
slaves were freed under this act, but none under the measure 
recommended in the message of March 6th. 



286 CR. S. G. HOWE. 

race ; and his letter, as published in the " Life of 
Agassiz," will show how Dr. Howe viewed these 
questions twenty-eight years ago. They were written 
in August, 1863, and their important parts are the 
following. 1 

The more I consider the subject to be examined and reported 
upon, the more I am impressed by its vastness ; the more I see 
that its proper treatment requires a consideration of political, 
physiological, and ethnological principles. Before deciding 
upon any political policy, it is necessary to decide several im 
portant questions, which require more knowledge for their so 
lution than I possess. Among these questions, this one occu 
pies me most now. Is it probable that the African race, repre 
sented by less than two million blacks and a little more than 
two million mulattoes, unrecruited by immigration, will be a 
persistent race in this country? or will it be absorbed, diluted, 
and finally effaced by the white race, numbering twenty-four 
millions, and continually increased by immigration, besides 
natural causes ? Will not the general practical amalgamation 
fostered by slavery become more general after its abolition? If 
so, will not the proportion of mulattoes become greater and 
that of the pure blacks less ? With an increase and final nu 
merical prevalence of mulattoes, the question of the fertility of 
the latter becomes a very important element in the calculation. 
Can it be a persistent race here where pure blacks are repre 
sented by 2, and the whites by 20-24 ? I s it n t true that in 
the Northern States, at least, the mulatto is unfertile, leaving 
but few children, and those mainly lymphatic and scrofulous ? 
In those sections where the blacks and mulattoes together make 
from seventy to eighty and even ninety per cent, of the whole 
population will there be, after the abolition of slavery, a suffi 
ciently large influx of whites to counteract the present numeri 
cal preponderance of blacks ? It looks now as if the whites 



1 See Louis Agassiz, His Life and Correspondence, vol. II, 
pp. 592-617. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 287 

would exploiter the labors of the blacks, and that social servi 
tude will continue long in spite of political equality. You will 
see the importance of considering carefully the natural laws of 
increase and their modification by existing causes before de 
ciding upon any line of policy. If there be irresistible natural 
tendencies to the growth of a persistent black race in the Gulf 
and River States, we must not make bad worse by futile at 
tempts to resist it. If, on the other hand, the natural tend 
encies are to the diffusion and final disappearance of the black 
and colored race, then our policy should be modified accord 
ingly. I should be very glad, my dear sir, if you could give me 
your views upon this and cognate matters. If, however, your 
occupations will not permit you to give time to this matter, 
perhaps you will assist me by pointing to works calculated to 
throw light upon the subject of my inquiry, or by putting me 
in correspondence with persons who have the ability and the 
leisure to write about it. 

Be assured I shall try to keep my mind open to conviction 
and to forbear forming any theory before observing a wide 
circle of facts. I do not know how you got the idea that I had 
decided in favor of anything about the future of the colored 
population. I have corresponded with the founders of " La 
Societe Cosmopolite pour la fusion cles races humaines " in 
France an amalgamation society, founded upon the theory 
that the perfect man is to be the result of the fusion of all the 
races upon earth. I have not, however, the honor of being a 
member thereof. Indeed, I think it hardly exists. I hear, too, 
that several of our prominent anti-slavery gentlemen, worthy of 
respect for their zeal and ability, have publicly advocated the 
doctrines of amalgamation ; but I do not know upon what 
grounds. 

I do, indeed, hold that in this, as in other matters, we are to 
do the manifest righ-t, regardless of consequences. If you ask 
me who is to decide what is the manifest right, I answer that 
in morals, as well as in mathematics, there are certain truths so 
simple as to be admitted at siglit as axioms by every one of 
common intelligence and honesty. The right to life is as clear 



288 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

as that two and two make four, and none dispute it. The right 
to liberty and to ownership of property fairly earned is just as 
clear to the enlightened mind as that 5x630; but the less 
enlightened may require to reflect about it, just as they may 
want concrete signs to show that five times six do really make 
thirty. As we descend in numbers and in morals, the intuitive 
perceptions become less and less ; and though the truths are 
there, and ought to be admitted as axiomatic, they are not at 
once seen and felt by ordinary minds. Now, so far as the rights 
of blacks and the duties of whites are manifest to common and 
honest minds, so far would I admit the first and perform the 
second, though the heavens fall. I would not only advocate 
entire freedom, equal rights and privileges, and open competi 
tion for social distinction, but what now seems to me the shock 
ing and downward policy of amalgamation. 

But the heavens are not going to fall, and we are not going to 
be called upon to favor any policy discordant with natural 
instincts and cultivated tastes. A case may be supposed in 
which the higher race ought to submit to the sad fate of dilu 
tion and debasement of its blood, as on an island, and where 
long continued wrong and suffering had to be atoned for. But 
this is hardly conceivable, because, even in what seems punish 
ment and atonement, the law of harmonious development still 
rules. God does not punish wrong and violence done to one 
part of our nature, by requiring us to do wrong and violence to 
another part. Even Nemesis wields rather a guiding-rod than 
a scourge. We need take no step backward, but only aside, to 
get sooner into the right path. 

Slavery has acted as a disturbing force in the development of 
our national character, and produced monstrous deformities of 
a bodily as well as moral nature, for it has impaired the purity 
and lowered the quality of the national blood. It imported 
Africans, and, to prevent their extinction by competition with a 
more vigorous race, it set a high premium on colored blood. It 
has fostered and multiplied a vigorous black race, and engen 
dered a feeble mulatto breed. Many of each of these classes 
have drifted northward, right in the teeth of thermal laws, to 



Til" COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 289 

find homes where they would never live by natural election. 
Now, by utterly rooting out slavery, and by that means alone, 
shall we remove these disturbing forces and allow fair play to 
natural laws, by the operation of which, it seems to me, the 
colored population will disappear from the Northern and 
Middle States, if not from the continent, before the more vigor 
ous and prolific white race. It will be the duty of the states 
man to favor, by wise measures, the operation of these laws 
and the purification and elevation of the national blood. 

In the way of this is the existence of the colored population 
of the Northern and Middle States. Now, while we should 
grant to every human being all the rights we claim for our 
selves, and bear in mind the cases of individual excellence of 
colored people, we must, I think, admit that mulattoism is hy 
bridism, and that it is unnatural and undesirable. It has been 
brought to its present formidable proportions by several causes, 
mainly by slavery. Its evils are to be met and lessened as far 
as may be by wise statesmanship and by enlightenment of 
pub.lic opinion. These may do much. Some proclaim amal 
gamation as the remedy, upon the theory that by diluting black 
blood with white blood in larger and larger proportions, it will 
finally be so far diluted as to be imperceptible, and will disap 
pear. They forget that we may not do the wrong that right 
may come of it. They forget that no amount of diffusion will 
exterminate whatever exists; that a pint of ink diffused in a 
lake is still there, and the water is only the less pure. 

Others insist that mulattoism is not and cannot be persist 
ent beyond four generations. In other words, that, like some 
other abnormal and diseased conditions, it is self-limiting, and 
that the body social will be purged of it. In the face of these 
and other theories, it is our duty to gather as many facts and 
as much knowledge as is possible, in order to throw light upon 
every part of the subject ; nobody can furnish more than you 
can. 

Faithfully yours, 

SAMUEL G. HOWE. 

These statements, made by Dr. Howe nearly thirty 



290 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

years ago, some of which have been strikingly con 
firmed and others disproved by the course of events, 
show with what candor of mind he approached the 
subject in which he had been so long interested as a 
partisan. It was inevitable that his theories and 
those of all other men should yield to the political, 
social, and economic necessities of the nation. In the 
reconstruction of the Southern States, he steadily 
supported the policy of his friend, Senator Sumner, 
favoring negro suffrage in those States as a political 
measure, made necessary by the state of feeling 
among the white population. But he also strenu 
ously favored the education of the colored race by 
all practical means, well knowing, however, that the 
performance of political duties would be the most 
powerful education that the freedmen could receive, 
now that the close of the war had made it needless 
to continue their military education as soldiers in the 
national army. He had been one of the first to advo 
cate the enlistment of colored troops, which was be 
gun in Kansas by the men whom he had aided in 
their contest for freedom in 1856, and continued with 
great earnestness by his friends Governor Andrew 
and George L. Stearns in Massachusetts. Indeed 
every measure looking towards the reorganization of 
the United States, on the basis of national freedom 
and the equality of all men before the law, constantly 
received his support, and some of them originated in 
his fertile and intuitive mind. 



CHAPTER II. 

THE NESTOR AND ACHILLES OF PUBLIC CHARITIES. 

IT was odd to see Dr. Howe at any period of his 
long life appear as the advocate of peace. Like the 
great Captain in all philanthropies, he came not to 
bring peace, but a sword. He was as naturally mil 
itant as he was constitutionally charitable and the 
friend of mankind. When the long warfare against 
negro slavery and the servility of American freemen 
was practically ended, late in 1864, by the success of 
Abraham Lincoln s Emancipation policy, and his re 
election to the Presidency, Dr. Howe was called by 
his friend Governor Andrew to another long cam 
paign against false methods and hurtful conservatism 
in the field of public charity. A "Board of State 
Charities" (the first ever established in America) had 
been created in 1863, in Massachusetts, at Governor 
Andrew s request, and Dr. Howe was made a mem 
ber of this body towards the close of 1864, when he 
was 63 years old. He showed himself a Nestor in 
counsel and an Achilles in action in this new field of 
strife. In October, 1865, he became, by the choice 
of his colleagues, Chairman of the Board, and so con 
tinued until he declined a reelection, in 1874 ; nor 
did he finally withdraw from the Board until June, 



292 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

1875, when he began to give up all public employ 
ments. 

The genius of Dr. Howe soon found means to turn 
the theory and practice of public charity in Massa 
chusetts in new directions, and to convert by gradual 
changes the existing policy of congregating the poor 
and the defective in large establishments into a better 
and wiser system. In its full development, this sys 
tem requires the thorough classification and the dif 
fusion among the people, so far as possible, of the 
exceptional classes with which public charity must 
deal. In practice much yet remains to be done, but 
his theory has become the accepted one in Massa 
chusetts and elsewhere. In whatever he undertook, 
and in all the detailed work of the Board, his courage, 
his enthusiasm, his faith in the future good of man 
kind, enabled him to overcome obstacles which 
others had found insurmountable. He used to define 
obstacles as " things to be overcome," and generally 
the result justified his definition. Happily combining 
theory and practice, insight and experience, the see 
ing eye and the helping hand, he was better fitted 
than any man of our time to perceive and apply the 
laws spiritual no less than economic by which 
public and private charity should be governed. 

Dr. Howe accepted this position of Chairman of 
the Board of State Charities just after the close of 
the war, in November, 1865, and he continued in 
it for about nine years, when his age and increasing 
infirmities led him, in 1874, to give it up. In these 
busy years, during which he passed the allotted period 
of three score years and ten, he performed a service 
no less useful and more general in its results than at 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 293 

any time during his more active period of philan 
thropy. For his varied experience combining with 
his native insight enabled him to formulate principles 
and even to forecast the future, in the wide organi 
zation of charities throughout the United States. 
The system he devised for Massachusetts, though 
never fully carried out in his lifetime, now prevails 
to a great extent there, and in a less degree in many 
other American States; while it has been introduced 
in European countries in some of its features. This 
is but a fair exchange between Europe and America, 
since it was from some of those countries that Dr. 
Howe himself took the hint for other portions of his 
charitable system. 

This system was developed and illustrated in suc 
cessive annual reports of the Board over which he 
presided from 1866 to 1873. The most formal state 
ment of its principles is to be found in the second 
Report of the Board, issued in 1866, some passages 
from which may here be cited. Dr. Howe there gives 
these 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF PUBLIC CHARITY. 

In considering what measures ought to be taken for the care 
and treatment of the dependent and vicious classes, we are to 
bear in mind several principles. 

First. That if, by investing one dollar, we prevent an evil the 
correction of which would cost ten cents a year, we save four 
per cent. 

Second. That it is better to separate and diffuse the depen 
dent classes than to congregate them. 

Third. That we ought to avail ourselves as much as possible 
of those remedial agencies which exist in society the family, 
social influences, industrial occupations, and the like. 



294 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Fourth. That we should enlist not only the greatest possible 
amount of popular sympathy, but the greatest number of indi 
viduals and of families, in the care and treatment of the 
dependent. 

Fifth. That we should avail ourselves of reponsible societies 
and organizations which aim to reform, support or help any 
class of dependents ; thus lessening the direct agency of the 
State, and enlarging that of the people themselves. 

Sixth. That we should build up public institutions only in the 
last resort. 

Seventh. That these should be kept as small as is consistent 
with wise economy, and arranged so as to turn the strength 
and the faculties of the inmates to the best account. 

Eighth. That we should not retain the inmates any longer 
than is manifestly for their good, irrespective of their usefulness 
in the institution. 

These maxims Dr. Howe proceeded to illustrate 
by example and argument, dwelling particularly on 
the necessity for separating and diffusing, rather 
than congregating, the dependent classes ; on the im 
portance of enlisting the people themselves in the 
direct work of social reform, and of elevating the 
dependent classes, so that public charities and re 
formatory agencies may be lessened in number and 
contracted in sphere. He also undertook to show 
that the system of providing large public institutions 
for the permanent dwelling of special classes of the 
dependent is unsound in principle ; that such estab 
lishments are only to be tolerated as a choice of 
evils ; and consequently that they should not be 
multiplied, and those existing should not be enlarged 
without pressing necessity. These were all matters 
of serious moment, and some of them were quite new 
to the people, who found themselves called upon to 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 295 

take up the work of public charity instead of leaving 
it to official persons. This they have since done to a 
great extent, but in 1866 not only the practice, but 
the theory itself, was little known. Upon this point I 
may quote Dr. Howe s argument, which the next 
quarter of a century after 1866 has fully sustained : 

The attempt to reduce to its lowest point the number of the 
dependent, vicious, and criminal classes, and tenderly to provide 
for those who cannot be lifted out of them, is surely worthy the 
best efforts of a Christian people. But that the work may be 
well done, it must be by the people themselves, directly, and in 
the spirit of Him who taught that the poor ye shall always have 
with you that is near you, in your hearts and affections, 
within your sight and knowledge ; and not thrust far away from 
you, and always shut up alone by themselves in almshouses or 
reformatories, that they may be kept at the cheapest rate by such 
a cold abstraction as a State government. The people cannot be 
absolved from those duties of chanty which require knowledge 
of and sympathy with sufferers; and they should never needlessly 
delegate the power of doing good. There can be no vicarious 
virtue ; and true charity is not done by deputy. 

There should be the least possible intervening agency between 
the people and the dependent classes ; on the contrary, the 
wants and sufferings, the capacities and the desires of the latter 
should be brought home to the minds and hearts of the former. 
If organized public charity must exist, the distinction between 
it and private charity should never be needlessly increased by 
any action of government. Each citizen should be led not only 
to sympathize with all of whatever class, but to show sympathy 
by action. If, for instance, we are to have almshouses, they 
should be so organized as to repel the lazy or criminal pauper, 
but to attract the kindly visitor, and enlist the sympathies of 
the people. There need be no fear of exhausting the pop 
ular heart, for it is like the widow s cruse, and yields more 
affection as it is more largely drawn upon. The sympathies of 
the people can always be easily called forth. 



296 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

Dr. Howe next spoke of 

THE TRUE FAMILY SYSTEM. 

In providing for the poor, the dependent, and the vicious, 
especially for the young, we must take the ordinary family for 
our model. We must bear in mind that they do not as yet 
form with us a well-marked and persistent class, but a conven 
tional, and, perhaps, only a temporary one. They do not differ 
from other men, except that, taken as a whole, they inherited 
less favorable moral tendencies, and less original vigor. Care 
should be taken that we do not by our treatment transform the 
conventional class into a real and persistent one. In pro 
viding for them we are to consider that, although there exists 
in them as in all men a strong gregarious instinct, out of which 
grows society, there are yet stronger domestic instincts out of 
which grow the family, and upon which depend the affections 
and the happiness of the individual. We cannot make the 
gratification of one instinct atone for the disappointment of the 
others. No amount of instruction and mental culture compen 
sates for stunted affections ; no abundance of society compen 
sates for poverty of domestic relations ; and the denial of these 
to the dependent poor, especially to the young, can only be jus 
tified by stern necessity. The family has been called the social 
unit. It is, indeed, the basis without which there will be no 
real society, but a multitude of individuals who harden into self 
ishness as they grow older. By means of the affections grow 
ing out of the family, the individual is divided into many, and 
the interests of others are felt to be his own. 

God not only " set the solitary in families," and made " blood 
thicker than water," but seems to have ordained that the natu 
ral institution of the family, growing out of kindred, and long 
familiar intercourse, must be at the foundation of all perma 
nent social institutions, and that by no human contrivance 
should any effectual substitute be found for it. 

It would be a beautiful and most hopeful sight to see fifteen 
hundred children and youth of a class who elsewhere are con 
fined in reformatories, or shut up in pauper houses scattered 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 297 

over our Commonwealth, and cared for by the people them 
selves. What need of organixing emigration for our unem 
ployed unmarried women, and opening fields for their energies 
on the Pacific Slope when such a blessed work as this may be 
done at their own doors ? The children themselves would 
thus be placed in circumstances most likely to correct the 
effects of the unfavorable tendencies which they may have 
inherited, and of the evil habits into which they may have 
fallen. 

This hope of Dr. Howe has since been fulfilled, 
and there are now in Massachusetts from 1,200 to 
i, 600 children and youth of the class mentioned, living 
in families instead of being cooped up in great estab 
lishments. This method of family care for the de 
pendent has also been applied to the insane, as Dr. 
Howe had recommended, first of all men in America. 
When visiting Europe for the last time, in 1867, he 
inspected the Belgian Colony of the Insane at Gheel, 
near Antwerp, and in the sixth Report of his Board, 
Dr. Howe thus described and reasoned upon this 
unique establishment: 

The present general aspect of the colony is this. There is a 
peaceful, industrious community of eleven thousand people, 
one-third living in comfortable and sightly houses in the village 
of Gheel ; the rest living in farm-houses, scattered over about 
30,000 acres of land. Living with these people, forming a part 
of their families, and undistinguishable at first sight, are 
between ten and eleven hundred lunatics. 1 Of these, about a 
score are under constant confinement, and medical treatment, 
in the central hospital. The others are lodged, singly or in 
couples, in the houses of well-to-do people ; or are employed 
as tailors, shoemakers, joiners, nurses, or farm laborers. A 



1 These had increased to 1900 when I visited Gheel, in June, 1890; 
while the number in the Central Hospital was sixty-five. F. B. S. 



298 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

tew, attended or unattended by servants, lounge about the 
parades, coffee-houses, and places of public resort, or roam the 
fields, fishing and hunting. Others run up and down the streets 
upon errands, or carrying packages in their arms, or small 
loads upon barrows. Others work on the tailor s bench, in the 
shoemaker s shop, or at the wash-tub, or in the kitchen or 
nursery, tending infants and little children. A few sit and stare 
with vacant look ; but the most are stimulated to activity by the 
activity about them. But by far the greater number work upon 
the farms in the surrounding country. Wherever you see a gang 
of half a dozen peasant men or women at work, be sure there is 
at least one lunatic among them. Now and then, indeed, one 
of them may have gyves upon the ankles, to prevent running ; 
but for the most part the restraint is self-imposed ; and the 
spirit of emulation and the hope of reward are the only restrain 
ing powers. 

Contrast this with the general aspect of our lunatics at pub 
lic institutions. 1 These are gathered together, nearly two thous 
and in number, in seven establishments. They are all of them 
under restraint, by walls and by keepers. Almost all of them 
are under lock and key most of the time, by day and by night, 
Go into any of the public institutions and ask, how many of 
your patients are free to take their hats and walk out of the 
door without the leave or knowledge of a keeper, and the 
answer is, hardly one. Non-restraint is preached, That is the 
theory. Cages, chains, straps, camisoles, muffs, bed-cribs, 
restraining-chairs, are abolished as far as it is thought they can 
be with safety. But the old superstition remains, and the 
whole establishment is one great restraining machine. Surely 
we may learn something by studying these contrasted pictures. 
There, freedom is the rule, confinement the exception. Here, 
confinement is the rule, freedom the exception. There the gen 
eral rule is occupation out of doors, here it is confinement in 
idleness. 

Make allowance for difference of race, of education, of habits ; 



1 He means in Massachusetts alone. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 299 

make all proper deductions for mistakes and exaggerations ; 
allow for the fact the insane at Gheel are to a certain extent 
picked cases, still there remains this striking contrast. But 
can the colony system as practised at Gheel be introduced into 
Massachusetts ? Surely not, now ; nor ever, perhaps, as a 
whole. Gheel was not enacted, nor built ; it grew. Planted 
centuries ago, the virtue that was in the seminal idea occupa 
tion for the insane in company with the sane counteracted the 
false ideas, and kept the whole in vigorous life. It took cen 
turies, too, to educate a people to carry on the system. But 
growth of all kinds is more rapid with us ; and if we plant good 
seed, free from tares, the growth here will be more in one gen 
eration than there in a century. At any rate, we may improve 
our own system by imitating the chief features of that. 

It is twenty-one years since this was written by Dr. 
Howe; and in that period much that he foreshadowed 
in the passage quoted has been done in Massa 
chusetts. The insane have been provided with more 
occupation in the hospitals, and allowed greater free 
dom; while the Scotch system of boarding them in 
families, also recommended strongly by Dr. Howe, 
has been put in practice, though on a small scale as 
yet. But it has already shown most favorable results, 
and will doubtless be extended more and more, as 
these results become better known. One of them is 
what Dr. Howe noted at Gheel in 1867, that these 
caretakers of the insane, and the community where 
they live, profit in a natural and wholesome manner 
by the system. Upon this and other points he said : 

The business of keeping lunatics has been the main source of 
the marked prosperity of the town of Gheel, and of the sur 
rounding country. About four hundred are employed in the 
town, and do a great deal of the work. A still larger number 
are employed in the surrounding country; and it is mainly by 
their work, and help, and by the pittance received from Gov- 



300 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

ernment that the peasants have been able to clear up waste 
land, and improve their gardens and houses. It is by utilizing 
the brain power which remains to lunatics (and which we 
waste) that the peasants of Gheel make the wilderness to blos 
som as the rose. 

At Gheel about one patient in fifty is confined within the 
hospital ; in Massachusetts, while all are so confined a large 
part of the time, hardly one-fiftieth are completely free from 
confinement, or from close supervision at any time. This 
comes not from any fault of the superintendents, but from the 
nature of the system, the structure of the buildings, and the 
condition of the neighborhood. This is a matter of so great 
importance to the insane that the whole system should be 
modified so as to give to the superintendents the means of 
allowing all the freedom which patients, of certain classes, can 
enjoy with safety to themselves and to the public. If there is 
but one poor, dazed man or woman confined in our lunatic hos 
pitals who pines for freedom, and who could enjoy it without 
harm to others, we ought not to rest until it can be accorded. 
But there are scores and hundreds so confined; and we must 
not let the fact that it has always been so, and, under our sys 
tem, must be so, prevent our calling for remedial measures. 

One of the chief virtues of the Gheel system is that the in 
sane are surrounded by normal or sane influences, while under 
our system they are surrounded by abnormal or insane influ 
ences. The most powerful of all influences upon the sane or 
insane is that of human symyathy. What is fabled of the cha 
meleon is true of man. The ordinary man soon takes on the 
moral hue of those about him; it is only the extraordinary man 
who does not. Under our system of treating lunatics, nine- 
tenths of the social influences upon any one patient may be 
called abnormal, and only one-tenth are normal influences, since 
the insane part of the community in which he lives is as nine to 
one of the sane. But under the colony system, as practised at 
Gheel, a thousand insane persons are scattered among more 
than 700 families, where the normal influences are at least as five 
to one of the abnormal ; and as the lunatics mingle much in the 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 30! 

community at large, it may be said that the normal or sane 
influences areas ten to one of the insane. 

In June, 1890, the number of families at Gheel 
which received insane inmates had increased beyond 
1,000, and the patients so placed were more than 
i, 800. The number of such patients under family 
care in Massachusetts does not much exceed 200; but, 
among the hundred families that receive them, in 
exact accordance with the principles laid down by 
Dr. Howe in 1866-67, are several whose success with 
their patients fully justifies all that he then said. 
Could he have seen, for example, the change for the 
better wrought in the insane woman under her care 
by Miss Alice Cook, at Sandwich, in the past five 
years, Dr. Howe would have said: " Here is a verifica 
tion of the principles I have formulated, from observ 
ing the natural and intuitive methods of the Belgian 
peasants." This gifted and energetic woman, aided 
by her mother and sister, has wrought the virtual 
recovery of several insane women since 1886, whose 
malady was thought by physicians to be incurable. 
And it only needs a class of women such as this, to 
accomplish the same excellent result in hundreds of 
cases. 1 



1 A rural poet, observing what has been done in this instance, has 
printed some lines which well describe, in a plain way, the natural 
magic of women who understand how to deal with their demented 
and bewildered sisters. He says : 

Her gift once found, she made it much her care 
To soothe and tame the wildest creatures there ; 
Pleased, they beheld, even with those frenzied eyes, 
Her tender ways their solace and surprise; 



302 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

The principles of Dr. Howe, thus verified in respect 
to the chronic insane, have been still more fruitful in 
their application to another class of the unfortunate 
deaf children who were formerly known in Amer 
ica as deaf-mutes, but many of whom now practice 
speech. Speaking of the deaf and blind, and of the 
poor generally, Dr. Howe said in 1866 : 

Now, out of unsound and abnormal conditions there must, of 
course, grow certain mental and moral tendencies, which, to 
say the least, are unwholesome. And it is a natural conse 
quence (though disregarded in practice) that if an individual 
with these tendencies lives in close association with others like 
himself, all his peculiarities and tendencies are intensified by 
the intercourse. The greater the majority of unsound persons 
in his community, the greater the intensification of his abnor 
mal tendencies. Each acts upon all ; and the characteristics 
of class, or caste, are rapidly developed. Nothing is more con 
tagious than evil. This is seen in those who are gathered in 



Her courage calm when anger, true or feigned, 
Threatened the blow that her strong hand restrained ; 
Her diligent labor at each menial toil, 
And her bright lamp that never lacked for oil. 

The fixed and haggard look grew soft and mild 
In those sad faces, and once more they smiled; 
Slowly their fashions strange they put aside, 
Checked the loose tongue, the unwonted labor tried ; 
With awkward zeal, and such as love alone 
Could show or bear, they made her tasks their own. 

Each knew her place, each found her happiest hour 

In that brown cottage with its orchard bower ; 

They plied their toil, they roamed through field and wood, 

Plucked the wild berries, fed the cackling brood, 

Tilled the small garden, spread the ample meal, 

Sang their old songs and danced to music s peal. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 303 

almshouses. Before entering, they, of course, had become 
poor and broken down; but they nevertheless had some individ 
uality of character ; they were not yet formed into the complete 
pauper shape, though they were tending in that direction. But 
when a man is gathered with others like himself into a gen 
eral almshouse, he is apt to lose it utterly. If his associates 
have also lost theirs, they act and react unfavorably upon each 
other. The evils growing out of their condition are all inten 
sified by close association, and the pauper spirit, strong as that 
of a caste, soon becomes the pervading spirit of the place. It 
is at once perceptible to the moral sense in all large institutions, 
and can hardly be kept down, becauses it arises from morbid 
mental and moral conditions. 

It may be permitted to draw a further illustration of the 
principle under consideration from some persons (neither vicious 
nor criminal), the similarity of whose defect or infirmity causes 
them to be classed together, such as the deaf mutes and the 
blind. 

It is common to regard these as forming special classes, though 
speaking strictly no such classes exist in nature. The cases 
spring up sporadically among the people, from the existence of 
abnormal conditions of parentage, which produce a pretty 
equal average number of cases in every generation, among any 
given population. They abound more in some localities and 
some neighborhoods than in others ; owing, probably, to ill- 
assorted marriages. . . . 

The morbid tendencies are not strong certainly not irresist 
ible at least with the blind. They are educable, like all ten 
dencies and dispositions, and by skillful management may be 
turned to advantage. Certainly they ought to be lessened, not 
strengthened, by education. Now they are lessened, and their 
morbid effects corrected in each individual, by intimate inter 
course with persons of sound and normal condition that is, by 
general society ; while they are strengthened by associating 
closely and persistently wtth others having the like infirmity. 
They, themselves, seem to have an instinctive perception of 
this, and the most delicate of them feel the morbid tendency 



304 DR S. G. HOWE. 

which may segregate them from ordinary people, and put them 
in a special class. They seem to cling to ordinary persons, as 
if fearing segregation, and strive to conform themselves to their 
habits, manners, and even appearance. 

It is generally supposed that this feeling, especially in the 
blind, arises only from the fact that the blindness and poverty 
are associated together, and that poverty calls forth contempt, 
lightened, in their case, by pity. But the feeling has a deeper 
source. It is very strong in those of delicate and sensitive 
natures, and it ought always to be respected and encouraged. 
Our principal in treating them should be that of separation and 
diffusion. 

Guided by this principle we should, in providing for the in 
struction and training of these persons, have the association 
among them as little as is possible, and counteract its tenden 
cies by encouraging association and intimacy with common 
society. They should be kept together no more closely and 
no longer than is necessary for their special instruction ; and 
there should be no attempts to build up permanent asylums 
for them; or to favor the establishment of communities com 
posed wholly or mainly of persons subject to a common in 
firmity. 

This is far more important with the mutes than with the 
blind, because of their speechlessness. Language, in its largest 
sense, is the most important instrument of thought, feeling and 
emotion ; and especially of social intercourse. Blindness, in so 
far as it prevents knowledge of, and participation in, the rudi 
mentary part of language, to wit, pantomine, or signs, gestures, 
and expression of features and face, tends to isolation ; but the 
higher and far more important part of language, speech, is 
fully open to them. Then their sense of dependence strength 
ens their social desires ; increases their knowledge and com 
mand of speech, and makes that compensate very nearly, if not 
quite, for ignorance of other parts of language. The blind, if 
left to ordinary social influences, are in no danger of isolation, 
It is when we bring them together in considerable numbers 
that the tendency to segregation manifests itself ; and this is 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 305 

rather from necessity than from choice, for the social cravings 
become more intense with them than with us. 

With mutes it is not so. Speech is essential for human de 
velopment. Without it full social communion is impossible ; 
since there can be no effectual substitute for it. The rudimen 
tary and lower part of language, or pantomime, is open to 
mutes ; but the higher and finer part, that is, speech, is forever 
closed ; and any substitute for it is, at best imperfect. This 
begets a tendency to isolation ; which not being so effectually 
checked during youth, as it is with the blind, by a sense of de 
pendence, becomes more formidable. To be mute, therefore, 
implies tendency to isolation. 

Hence Dr. Howe argued that the language of 
signs must not be taught to the deaf, any more than 
to the blind, but that they should cease to be mute 
by learning to articulate ; and by reading the lips, 
should avoid the necessity of signs. 

This position taken by Dr. Howe in respect to the 
education of deaf children speedily led to an improve 
ment in their training almost as great as that which 
he had introduced and carried forward in respect to 
the blind between 1833 and 1844. The supporters of 
what was in America the established method of deaf- 
mute instruction, came forward with some condescen 
sion and some bitterness to oppose these fanciful 
notions, as they deemed them, of the Massachusetts 
philanthropist. In 1844, when, in cooperation with 
Horace Mann, Dr. Howe had attempted to introduce 
teaching by articulation, which they had seen so suc 
cessfully in use in Germany and Switzerland, the 
managers of the Hartford and New York asylums had 
been able to thwart their efforts. But in the twenty 
years which had elapsed many changes had taken 



306 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

place, and, to the surprise of these old-fashioned in 
structors of the deaf, the people responded promptly 
to the appeals of Dr. Howe and his friends. A contro 
versy again took place, a war of pamphlets and 
newspapers, but the victory did not rest with the 
conservatives. An old gentleman in Massachusetts, 
John Clarke, of Northampton, whose large property 
had been destined by him and his wife for the edu 
cation of the deaf, had his attention called to this 
dispute ; and he sent word to the Governor of Massa 
chusetts in 1866, that he was ready to endow a school 
in Massachusetts for deaf children, so that it might 
no longer be necessary to send them to Hartford, in 
another State. The Governor communicated this 
offer to the Legislature; an inquiry was instituted in 
1867, and the legislative committee, in a long report, 
to which was annexed the testimony of Dr. Howe 
and others in favor of articulation, recommended 
that a school be chartered in Massachusetts, to receive 
the funds of Mr. Clarke. An act was passed in the 
same year authorizing this, and Mr. Clarke was in 
duced, probably by the evidence thus furnished, to 
use the new school for teaching articulation to the 
deaf. This was made practical at once by the 
appointment of Miss Harriet Rogers (who had been 
teaching articulation for two years to a small school 
in Chelmsford), as Principal of the Clarke School at 
Northampton. This took place in the summer of 1867, 
since which time the Clarke Institution, as this school 
is called, has grown to more than a hundred pupils, 
and a school in Boston almost as large, and named 
for Horace Mann, also teaches articulation to day 
papils in Boston and its vicinity. Consequently two- 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 307 

thirds of the deaf children of Massachusetts are now 
taught by the new method, while less than a third of 
them remain in the school at Hartford. Even this is 
no longer under the old system, but gives instruction 
in articulation to a considerable number of its pupils. 
Moreover, in New York and several other States, 
articulating schools are maintained, and in most of 
the schools where the sign language is employed, 
classes in articulation are formed ; so that the whole 
number of children in the United States at present 
learning by Dr. Howe s method is several thousand. 
In 1866 not more than half a dozen children were 
practicing this method in the whole country. 

Dr. Howe considered this subject of instruction for 
the deaf in several of his annual reports, and in that 
for 1868 he wrote as follows : 

" Public enlightenment will lead to the adoption of a system 
for the deaf which will be far better for them, since it will bring 
them into closer relations with society, so that their special 
education shall be less costly to the State, and the contributions 
which they make to the common weal, more abundant than 
they ever have been. Some mothers will try to teach their 
born mutelings to use the rudiments of speech. Others, whose 
children have become deaf by disease, will make them keep up 
the habit of speaking; and some of each class will succeed to 
such an extent that the little ones can go to the primary school 
with their brothers and sisters, and learn much that is useful, 
especially if the teacher gives a little special attention and aid. 
By the assistance of an intelligent hearing child, who should 
act as monitor and instructor to the mute child, the teacher 
might give it preparatory training which would save years of 
hard labor, and hundreds of dollars expense, because it would 
be so much gained for its subsequent training in a special in 
stitution. In centers of population large enough to furnish five 



308 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

or six semi-mutes, or mutes adapted to the simple method of 
articulation, they will be gathered into the primary and gram 
mar schools, and there taught much that is useful. The num 
ber required to be gathered into central special institutions and 
taught there will be very much lessened, and their stay in them 
much shortened, because all who succeed in articulating and 
reading upon the lips can go and learn their trades just as 
other children do, among the common people, instead of being 
retained, as they are in the old institutions, to work for years 
with other mutes. In this way they will be all the time improv 
ing in their means of intercourse with the world, instead of 
being secluded from it,-and confined for years with a crowd of 
mutes in the workshops of a public institution. Many of the 
small German establishments for deaf mutes are in this respect 
greatly superior to our vast and showy institutions. This 
method of teachiug the mutes their trades is philosophical, 
simple, and cheap ; and it favors what should be the great ob 
ject in the education of any class of defectives, to wit, their 
separation from each other, and their diffusion in society. 

The course this indicated by the aged experience 
of this man of practical genius has in fact been taken 
since 1868 ; and, although all that he anticipated has 
not yet taken place, and perhaps will not occur for a 
century, yet the movement is strongly in that direc 
tion. So too, with regard to other matters of public 
chanty and wise education ; the true way has been 
pointed out, sometimes with a little exaggeration and 
in a spirit too polemical, but on the whole, so that Dr. 
Howe s successors in the same field find they must 
walk in it. To few men is it granted to work such a 
change in established methods so swiftly, 



CHAPTER III. 

DR. HOWE AND THE CRETANS. 

WHILE engaged in the great work of reorganizing 
the public charities, Dr. Howe s services were again 
called for in the scene of his early adventures, Greece 
and the Island of Crete, which is not yet (1891), as it 
should be, a part of the restored nation of the Greeks. 
In 1829-30 the allied powers of Europe would not 
permit its annexation to Greece, on the avowed 
ground that the new nation might be too powerful 
for European control if allowed to retain this magnifi 
cent island. With all the valor of his youth, con 
firmed by the wise experience of a lifetime, Dr. Howe 
now came forward in 1866 as the champion of a race 
long and sadly oppressed, engaged in a death struggle 
for its freedom. A meeting was held at Boston in 
aid of the Cretans, January, 1867, in whose proceed 
ings Governor Andrew, Wendell Phillips, and Bishop 
Huntington took part. When, on this occasion, Dr. 
Howe rose and said: "Some forty-five years ago I 
became greatly interested in the war for Greek inde 
pendence," a murmur of astonishment ran through 
the hall, for he then looked like a man still in the 
vigor of life, and those who saw him had forgotten 
his youthful chivalry. With the aid of this meeting, 
and by personal exertions, Dr. Howe succeeded in 
raising funds for the Cretans, $37,000 being sub- 

(309) 



310 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

scribed, largely in Boston and its neighborhood, and 
in March, 1867, Dr. Howe for the last time sailed for 
Europe, designing to visit the scene of the war in 
person, and to use his own judgment in distributing the 
supplies, as he had done forty years before at ^Egina. 
Mrs. Howe, who was his companion on this journey, 
thus describes it : 

I had already twice accompanied Dr. Howe to Europe, with 
great pleasure and profit. But I must speak of this, our third 
joint expedition, as an occasion characterized by a new charm 
and interest. Two dear daughters went with us, and height 
ened our enjoyment by their fresh delight in scenes new and 
strange. To be the bearer of aid and comfort to those who 
contend for the right, must ever be a happy boon. The doc 
tor s heart was full of this happiness, and something of its 
peace and serenity was shared by those about him. 

Once arrived on the other side of the ocean, the welcome and 
Godspeed of the friends of Greece and of freedom gladdened 
him at every step. In Liverpool, the heads of the Greek Com 
mittee waited upon him on the evening of his arrival. In Lon 
don, the doors of the brilliant and genial Greek society flew 
open to receive him, and a glimpse of Eastern warmth and 
brightness shone through the foggy atmosphere of London. In 
Geneva, I remember that the Cretan Committee seemed to 
have been particularly active, and that this bond of sympathy 
brought us into contact with some very intelligent and excel 
lent people. Delightful as were all the stages of this journey, 
Dr. Howe hurried through them, in his haste to reach the 
scene of his mission. He paused, as he passed, only long 
enough to take needful rest, and reached Athens by the be 
ginning of June, 1867. Lingering a little by the way, I joined 
him in that historic city some weeks later, and found him sur 
rounded by his committee, and busily at work. In the forma 
tion of his plans and the choice of his assistants, Dr. Howe, as 
usual, followed his own good judgment, sometimes giving of- 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 31! 

fence to those who thought their own better, but retaining 
throughout the confidence and approbation of those most 
nearly concerned in the ministrations confided to him. At the 
risk of his life, he visited the island of Crete, and conferred 
with parties engaged or interested in the conflict, maintaining, 
however, to all others a strict incognito. After his return, a 
war frigate was placed at his disposal by the Greek govern 
ment, and in company with him we visited Nauplia, and took 
carriages from thence to Argos and Mycenae. At Argos, I 
was present at the clisiribution of a part of the clothing sent 
from America for the Cretan women and children. These poor 
creatures, wan and sad-eyed, thronged outside the door of the 
large room in which the garments were arranged. They were 
allowed to enter only in small companies, as their names, duly 
registered beforehand, were read from a list. Some carried 
small infants in their arms, some were surrounded by groups 
of children. A papa, or secular priest, of their own country 
had them in charge. Dr. Howe was aided in these and other 
distributions by a young Greek gentleman, Mr. Michael Anag- 
nos, who afterwards accompanied him to America and became 
his son-in-law and assistant at the Blind Asylum, where he has 
been elected Principal since the death of his beloved chief. 1 

In Athens, and in many other places, distributions of cloth 
ing were made. These garments were the gifts of various 
sewing-circles in Boston and New York, and constituted the 
greater part of their winter s work. The money brought from 
America was mostly invested in biscuit, baked in Athens, and 
packed for transportation in the loose, baggy trousers worn by 
the Greek peasants. Supplies of food and clothing were thus 
ingeniously combined, and two of the blockade-runners which

father-in-law founded, and has carried it forward to even greater 
success than attended it in the days of Dr. Howe. He has now 
four deaf and blind pupils, instead of Dr. Howe s one (Laura 
Bridgman), but several of them are no longer dumb, for he has 
taught them to speak. 



312 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

did so much mischief to American commerce during our civil 
war now earned a better reputation by carrying these helpful 
gifts to the suffering inhabitants of the desolated island. Dr. 
Howe and his party returned to America in the autumn of 
1867, after an absence of eight months. He and his were still 
intent upon aiding the Cretans. To this end the ladies of his 
family, with the aid of many others, devoted much time to the 
organization of a fancy fair, which was held in the Boston 
Music Hall in Easter week, 1868, with the net result of some 
twenty-thousand dollars. Dr, Howe meanwhile commenced 
the publication of a small newspaper, entitled The Cretan, of 
which the object was to enlighten the American public 
upon the merits and antecedents of the Cretan question. This 
publication was continued during six months. 

After his return to America, in the latter part of 
1867, Dr. Howe prepared and printed a report 1 to the 
contributors for the relief of the Cretans, from which 
it appears that the whole value contributed in money 
and clothing in New England and New York ex 
ceeded $50,000. Of this sum about $25,000 was col 
lected in Boston ; $12,364 in New York ; and more 
than ten thousand garments, valued at $13,000, were 
contributed by persons in Boston and other parts of 
New England. The mode of distributing these 
supplies, like that adopted by Dr. Howe in 1828, is 
noticeable for its application of the true principles of 
private charity ; and it was a remarkable coincidence 
that much of this distribution took place in 1867, at 
the port of ^Egina, where Dr. Howe had rebuilt the 
old Mole forty years before. Portions of this report 
are as follows : 

You began your contributions in the winter of 1866-67, and 
I arrived in Greece with them early in May, the Cretan insur-

THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 313 

rection having broken out in August, 1866. I immediately pro 
ceeded to ascertain by personal inspection the number, condi 
tion, and wants of the Cretan refugees in Greece itself. There 
were then over 12,000 entirely destitute and supported by char 
ity ; about 2,000 who had saved enough in their flight, or were 
able to earn enough to support themselves ; and more were 
continually coming. The largest part were children of a tender 
age ; the rest were women, and a few old men. They were 
living huddled together in barracks or other buildings, twenty, 
thirty, forty in a room, sitting or lying upon the floors, without 
tables, chairs, or bedsteads. In this sad condition, ragged, 
hungry, and idle, they anxiously awaited news from their hus 
bands, fathers, brothers, fighting for their homes and the gar 
dens which they themselves had abandoned, but fondly hoped 
to see again. 

In all this penury, dirt, and suffering the women looked sad, 
but patient and resigned ; the girls looked more hopeful ; while 
the little ones were as merry as your children. But they all 
strove to make the best of their sad condition, and, grouping 
themselves according to families, each one arranged some tat 
tered blankets, or rude utensils, broken crockery, and scraps of 
furniture, in some nook or corner, and hung upon the wall a 
rude cross or other church emblem, so as to make a faint sem 
blance of their homes, thus manifesting, in a striking degree, 
two traits of Greek character which I have often mentioned 
family instinct and religious sentiment the enduring strength 
of which has helped to preserve the nationality with such won 
derful purity through the flood of invasions and ages of foreign 
domination. Moreover, in spite of all their penury, squalor, and 
rags, they showed signs of the physical beauty and mental 
vivacity which distinguish the Cretans among the Greeks, who 
are acknowledged to be preeminent, physically, among the 
various nationalities of the East. Fine skins, delicate features 
and limbs, and large lustrous eyes, made them remarkable even 
in Greece. The photographs of some of these groups will show 
that neither fancy nor partiality made them appear thus in my 
eyes. The moral condition of the refugees was such as would 



314 DR - S. G. HOWE. 

be expected of such a people : they were chaste, sober, frugal 
and withal self-respectful. They had neither the habits nor the 
air of paupers. There was a certain tidiness even in their 
rags. They received from the Anglo-Greek and other com 
mittees their allowance, averaging $2.50 per week for a family 
of five, and expended it almost entirely upon bread and salt, 
using the balance to buy a few sticks of wood for cooking, or 
other absolute necessaries. 

The simplest and the easiest course for me would have been 
to pay over my funds to existing committees, and let them dis 
tribute; and some were disappointed that I did not do so; but 
for what seemed good reasons, I determined to make special 
distributions, as far as possible, under my personal inspection. 
The existing committees had funds enough to supply the refu 
gees with food for months to come, but they could not provide 
for other wants ; and, besides, they were restricted in the use 
of their means to those who had actually left the Island of 
Crete, while I had no other restriction than the moral obliga 
tion to relieve the suffering non-combatants of Crete. Part of 
my funds, indeed, might have been applied to any sufferitg Cre 
tans, whether armed or not. Said one large contributor : " I 
recommend you to buy bread with my money, but if you find 
that cartridges are more needed, buy them." All the aid the 
refugees were then receiving, from the foreign committees and 
from the Government, was their daily dole of cash ; and this 
barely sufficed to feed them on poor and imperfectly-cooked 
food. 

Of course, there were cases where the clothing was hardly 
enough to hide nakedness cases of extreme suffering, arising 
from the sickness or disability of a mother, and cases where 
families could not even get into barracks ; but lay on the ground 
in stables and out-buildings. My first care was to provide for 
such cases, and to this end I placed funds in the hands of the 
American missionaries, who went in and out like ministering 
angels among these poor people. 

The next step was to try to arrest the demoralizing effect of 
idleness by providing some employment. There were many 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 315 

difficulties in the way. The people of the towns in which the 
Cretans had taken refuge, with the exception of the Athenians, 
are poor, and do their own work. Labor was not in demand. 
Besides, the Cretans were mostly of the peasant class. Some 
women knew how to spin and to weave ; but few of them, and 
none of the children, could sew or knit. They disliked the idea 
of domestic service ; still more the idea of breaking up their fami 
lies. They regarded their exile as only temporary, and clung to the 
hope of a speedy return to beloved Crete. Their strongest 
form of expression was, " May I never see dear Crete if I don t 
do thus and so." " Ah, my dear babe," moaned a mother 
over the body of her child, " death is dreadful ; but, alas ! to 
die in a strange land, and be buried out of Crete ! " 

These difficulties had deterred the other committees from 
the attempt to supply employment ; but on my proposing it to 
the American ladies, Miss Baldwin, Mrs. Constantine, Mrs. 
Hill, and Mrs. Kalopothakis and Mrs. Sakellarios, and Miss 
Hill, they undertook it, and carried it out beautifully. We got 
a job for making a large number of coarse bags. The ladies 
were supplied with material, and taking some of the most in 
telligent Cretan women to help them, they cut it up, and then 
let it be known that all who could sew might have work, and 
be paid fifty leptas x for each bag made. The news spread, 
and immediately the houses of the ladies were besieged by ap 
plicants. The poor creatures came from long distances, under 
the boiling sun, many carrying infants in their arms, and waited 
patiently hour after hour, until they received cloth, needles, 
and thread, upon which they hurried home and eagerly went 
to work. We graduated the payment so that by working in 
dustriously a woman could earn a little more than the allow 
ance made by the committee, which she was to renounce 
while the work lasted, so as to economize the funds. Difficul 
ties, however, were found in the way of this. The women 
generally were very eager for work, and the demand soon ex- 



1 This would be from 8 to 10 cents the hpton being YIOO of the 
Greek drachma. 



316 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

ceeded the supply. The poor creatures crowded about the 
depot at early dawn, and pleaded piteously for a share of the 
work. We then made arrangements to supply knitting-work. 
We purchased and dealt out yarn and other materials to all 
applicants who knew how to knit, and paid them 50 leptas a 
pair for all the stockings they made ; the materials cost about 
50 more leptas. We established a depot for the sale of the 
stockings, and pushed them off upon the market at about 80 
leptas per pair. This apparent loss of 20 leptas was a real 
gain, as it made the means go so much farther. Thus, sup 
pose the daily allowance to be 50 leptas to women who did not 
work, and 60 to one who did, the first brought nothing back, 
the second brought a pair of socks, which could be sold for 40 
leptas more than the cost of material. Thus her daily cost was 
only 20 leptas, while she had the advantage of occupation, and 
of feeling that she was earning something, instead of entirely 
dependant upon charity. 

Observe here the simplicity and effectiveness of 
this arrangement, combining frugality with industry, 
and guarding against the great risk of all charitable 
giving that it may pauperize the recipient. The 
next step taken once more exhibits the constructive 
and political genius of Dr. Howe in matters of charity, 
which he certainly understood better than any man 
of his period. He established industrial schools 
perhaps for the first time in Athens. 

But many women and most of the children did not know 
how to knit, or even to sew ; and so we established work- 
schools in which they could be taught, and soon had in 
Athens several hundred in constant attendance. These schools 
were conducted principally by the ladies above mentioned, 
aided by intelligent Cretans whom they selected for assist 
ants. The pupils in these schools in a short time exceeded a 
thousand, and they continued through the winter of 1867-68. 
A Greek in Athens, during that winter, said that he thought our 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 317 

schools for these children were by far the most important work 
done for the Cretan refugees. 

Not content with relieving those who had fled from 
their island-home, Dr. Howe determined to visit 
Crete, distribute supplies under his personal direction, 
and endeavor thus to lessen if not to stop the exodus 
of Cretans from their country. At that time (June, 
1867) thousands of families had been driven from 
their villages to the neighboring mountains, hoping 
soon to return. The Turkish armies had not pene 
trated all the mountain regions ; and the only press 
ing danger there was starvation. Dr. Howe says, " I 
myself, while sailing along the coast, saw the smoke 
going up from the Cretan villages by day, and saw 
the light of the fires at night ; not only from villages 
on the plains, but from hamlets in the mountains, 
from shepherds huts and folds, and from the tents 
and other shelters built by refugees who had now 
abandoned them, and clambered up higher with their 
children and goats. Thence they looked out upon 
the sea for some blockade runner upon which they 
could take refuge. If, therefore, means could be 
found to throw provisions into the interior with rea 
sonable assurance that it would reach hungry women 
and children, it would lessen the inducement to leave 
the island." What was done for this purpose, though 
not very effectual, was so romantic in its incidents 
that Dr. Howe s account should be given. He says : 

I caused a large quantity of coarse nutritious biscuit to be 
baked, and packed in sacks of thirty pounds each, so that when 
landed upon the beach in the night, as they would have to be, 
they could be carried on men s shoulders into the mountains. 
Fortunately, I found a man well-fitted to lead the enterprise, 



318 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

and who volunteered to do it Captain Elias Stekoulis, a Greek, 
whose character for courage and honor had been well estab 
lished by years of confidential service on Garibaldi s staff. 
Having guarded against the danger of the provisions and gar 
ments being seized by Greek soldiers, the next step was to 
elude Turkish cruisers on the water and Turkish troops on the 
land. On the night of June I4th, the bags were landed on the 
Cretan shore, almost under the range of the guns of the block 
ading squadron ; and before daylight they had all disappeared. 
They had been expected, and a crowd of men, with a few 
mules and donkeys, had come down from the mountain for 
tresses, and been waiting for them upon the beach since sunset. 
The sacks were immediately laden upon the animals or upon 
men s shoulders, and carried up to places of safety, without the 
loss of a single one. 

At sunset the Turkish officer on duty on the blockading ship, 
sweeping the horizon with his spy-glass, saw nothing but stones 
and sand upon the beach, and reported, " All s well !" At day 
light he looked again, and saw only the sand and stones, and 
again reported, " All s well ! " 

There was a touch of real heroism, on this occasion at least, 
in the conduct of these simple but chivalrous Cretans. We had 
appealed to their honor, and they answered honorably. Strong 
men, armed, undisciplined, unrestrained by martial or civil law, 
numerous enough to defy opposition, hungering and not know 
ing where to find the next meal, took this food upon their 
shoulders, and toiled for miles up the mountain passes, and 
threw it down before the women and children, and broke not 
their own fast, nor their faith ! Individual men have often imi 
tated the dying Sidney s generous self-denial, and passed un- 
tasted the cup of water to lips less parched than their own, but 
masses of men rarely. 

Besides the distribution at Athens, already 
described, and in the Island of Crete, Dr. Howe 
undertook in the late summer of 1867 to supply with 
New England clothing the many Cretans who had 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE 319 

taken refuge in the islands of ^Egina and Melos 
those being supposed to stand in the greatest need. 
The Greek Government gave him an order for any 
naval steamer that might then be unemployed. Their 
navy, however, consisted chiefly of one steam frigate, 
two sloops of war, two or three tugs, and sundry old 
craft too dilapidated to float. Dr. Howe thus 
described the expedition : 

" A crazy old tug was the only thing then available, and upon 
this I embarked with several boxes of clothing. Mrs. Walter 
Baker, of Boston, who was returning from a tour in the East, 
happened to be in Athens ; and she, with Miss Mary Baldwin, 
volunteered to go with me and attend to the distribution. So 
we sailed out of Port Piraeus, and across the Gulf of Salamis, 
down to old yEgina. The ancient port was formed by project 
ing two vast walls into the sea, and approaching the ends 
thereof so nearly that the narrow opening could be closed by a 
chain, and further guarded by towers. Chains and towers, and 
most of the superstruction, were gone ; but the foundations of 
the enormous walls were still above the surface, and made a 
secure haven within. It had, however, become much choked 
up with the soil washed down from the hills, and by rubbish 
from the town, and would have been still more so but for the 
mole built here by the agent of the American-Greek commit- 
tees x in the old war of independence, forty years ago. Grateful 
to us it was, landing upon this broad, substantial mole, to find 
assembled upon it the populace of yEgina, many of whom were 
witnesses of its structure, and all of whom regarded it as a 
monument of the generosity and of the practical beneficence of 
the American people. 

Near the town is a vast building, erected during the presi 
dency of Capo d Istria, for an orphan asylum. It is an exten 
sive pile, one story high, built around a square, and divided 



1 Dr. Howe himself. 



320 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

off into small rooms. These had been stripped of everything 
even the wooden floors. There were gathered about 1,200 
refugees, women and children, with a few old men, and three 
or (our papas or priests. Like the other Cretan refugees, they 
were sadly destitute of all the comforts, and some of the nec 
essaries of life. Their allowance from the committee was but 
forty leptas a day just enough for meal and salt and a few 
sticks of wood for cooking. Their garments had become soiled 
and tattered, and many were nearly naked. They had no occu 
pation, and sat with folded hands, looking out over the sea for 
some vessel from Crete, and listening for news from their hus 
bands and fathers, then battling for their homes. 

One large room had been set apart for a church ; and here 
we opened our boxes, and sorted out the garments. Admitting 
one family at a time at one door, we hastily gave to each per 
son a shirt and drawers and gown, and dismissed them for the 
others. It was a hard task, for the poor creatures were so 
eager to get a garment of any kind to cover their children s 
nakedness or their own, that they thronged and choked the 
passages. Still they did not clamor, or beg in words. There 
was none of the crying out, and praying, and blessing you, so 
common among mendicants. They were unpracticed in any 
art of begging. Pressing hunger and want, and fear of naked 
ness impelled them to come and show their condition. Mothers 
mutely held up their infants above the crowd, and pushed 
their little girls before them but were still. It was only after 
they had clutched some garments and were bearing them away, 
that they broke out into exclamations of joy and gratitude. 

While in Athens, Dr. Howe wrote to the London 
Times (July 17, 1867) an account of his mission and 
the occasion of it, somewhat similar to that which I 
have quoted. In this he estimated the refugees in 
Greece as 13,000, of whom 8,400 were dependent for 
support on the charity of committees. He estimated 
the refugees in Crete itself (besides 8,000 who had 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 321 

taken refuge in the Turkish fortified towns), at 
between 15,000 and 25,000. To a large number of 
this great army of destitute persons, Dr. Howe car 
ried or sent relief ; and this whole magnificent 
charity sprung ultimately from his own personal 
interest in the Greeks and their cause. In summing 
up his Boston report to the subscribers, x he said : 

The general result of your contributions and of my mission 
has been most satisfactory. You have fed the hungry and 
clothed the naked ; indeed, your garments are now the only 
clothing of thousands of Cretan women and children. You 
have established work-schools for the employment of women. 
You have opened, and now maintain, training and industrial 
schools for boys and girls, which are still doing good. By these 
means you have directly promoted the cause of mercy, and in 
directly sustained the cause of freedom. 3 

The Cretan insurrection of 1866-67 failed, as such 
movements have often failed, before and since ; but 
Dr. Howe never lost faith that it would eventually 
succeed. When General Grant became President, in 
1869, Dr. Howe would gladly have gone to Greece as 

* Among the four or five largest subscribers, who each gave 
$500, were Gerrit Smith, of Peterboro, N. Y. , John M. Forbes 
and Martin Brimmer, of Boston, and a Greek merchant of New 
York. Several persons on the list had subscribed forty years before 
to the fund which Dr. Howe then raised. f 

a When I was in Athens in April, 1890, there were again in that 
city hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Cretan refugees; and, as I 
write this note (July 8, 1891), I find in my latest Athenian news 
paper, Le Messager (fAthenes, these remarks : " Letters from Crete 
mention sanguinary conflicts between Turks and Christians. It is 
beyond dispute that the suppression of freedom in Crete has sown 
in all hearts the seeds of hatred, which will not fail to germinate at 
the first opportunity." Nothing but expulsion of the Turks can, 
indeed, tranquillize the island.

the American Minister Resident, a position for which 
he was specially fitted, and in which he could have 
done something to promote the prosperity and exten 
sion of the Greek nation ; but the place was wanted 
by the politicians at Washington to pay off some 
political debt, and so the appointment never came to 
him. While in Athens, in 1867, he met again, after a 
separation of many years, his companion of the Greek 
Revolution, George Finlay, who still lived in Greece. 
He found his old friend taking an opposite view to 
his own concerning the Cretan struggle, but this did 
not prevent a renewal of their former comradeship. 
When Finlay died, in 1875, a few months only before 
the death of Dr. Howe, the latter thus mentioned 
him in a letter to Mr. Bird: 1 

SATURDAY, AUGUST, 1875. 

MY DEAR BIRD: I thank you for your letters to Harry. 2 I 
came in town to have the pleasure of seeing you, and of going 
to dine with you, but find myself hacking perpetually with a 
cold, caught yesterday, and am not fit company for any but 
barking dogs. In most respects I am better. Drop me a line 
giving news of Robinson s health. 3 The news of the death of 
my old, well-beloved friend, George Finlay, in Athens, de 
presses me very much. I am now the only surviving member 
of the gallant band of Philhellenes who fought for the freedom 
of Greece in the darkest days of her revolution. Almost alone 
on earth, I cling to you as one of very few who have known and 
loved poor old SAM L G. HOWE

CHAPTER IV. 

THE QUIXOTIC SANTO DOMINGO EPISODE. 

PRESIDENT GRANT, perhaps remembering that he 
had overlooked Dr. Howe in 1869, offered him, in 
January, 1871, an appointment as one of three com 
missioners sent by him to visit Santo Domingo, at one 
extremity of the island of Hispaniola, which is mainly 
controlled by the Haytians. The latter have given 
their French name to the whole island, while Santo 
Domingo, the Spanish name, is applied to the East 
ern half, which has long been independent of the 
Haytians. The Dominicans, through their President, 
General Baez, a colored man of Spanish descent, had 
offered to annex themselves to the United States, 
and General Grant favored the scheme, against which 
the good sense of the American people pronounced 
very strongly when their opinion was afterwards 
taken. But, while the question was undecided, Sen 
ator Wade, of Ohio, with Dr. Howe and President 
White, of Cornell University were made a special 
commission to visit the island and report on its con 
dition and on the disposition of the inhabitants with 
regard to annexation. The project was, of course, 
unacceptable to the Haytian Government, and en 
countered the active opposition of its representative 
at Washington. But its most formidable and out 
spoken opponent was Charles Sumner, then and for 



324 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

almost twenty years previous the senior Senator 
from Massachusetts, and the warm personal and poli 
tical friend of Dr. Howe. It was, no doubt, with a 
view to make friends for his pet scheme in Massachu 
setts that President Grant tendered this appointment 
to Dr. Howe, whose best friends were opposed to his 
acceptance. But all the romance and Quixotism of 
Howe s nature were aroused by this appointment ; 
he saw an opportunity to serve the colored race, as 
he thought, in a region where they had for centuries 
been, by turns, most cruelly oppressed and most bar 
barously triumphant ; and he yielded to the wish of 
the enemies of Sumner. 

The expedition was ill-omened from the start ; for 
it was rumored that the Government steamer 
Tennessee, on which the commissioners sailed (along 
with Frederick Douglass, H. B. Wheelwright, and 
other attaches), was not seaworthy, and it was even 
reported that she was lost. 1 

The visit of the commission lasted only two months 
or less, and their report was necessarily quite imper 
fect. They were, however, convinced of the great 
richness and value of the territory owned by the 



1 Mrs. Howe says: "Concerning the seaworthiness of this 
steamer, many injurious reports were set on foot, causing great 
unhappiness to those whose friends were among her passengers. 
The infrequency of mail communication between Santo Domingo 
and the United States made it impossible to hear from the steamer 
within a month from the time of her departure. The writer can 
not forget the distress suffered by herself and others during this 
interval, through those unfounded rumors of disaster to the vessel 
and all on board of her. Nor can she forget the warm overflow of 
sympathy with which the news of Dr. Howe s safe arrival in Santo 
Domingo was received in Boston." 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 325 

Dominicans, and received a favorable impression of 
their intelligence and capacity for moral and intel 
lectual cu-lture. They reported that the proposed 
annexation would be productive of benefit to 
both parties, "by affording to the United States a 
wide range of tropical productions now purchased 
from other powers at great cost, and by guarantee 
ing to the Dominicans the improvements and 
institutions indispensable to the growth of their 
country." All that they saw of Haytian society, 
on the contrary, led them " to look in its 
future for that intensification of barbarism which 
develops itself in semi-civilized races from whose 
career the elements of intellectual progress are 
excluded." These views were shared by Frederick 
Douglass; himself of mixed blood, and famil 
iar with the colored people of the South, he saw in 
Hayti, for the first time, a negro society from which 
the help and influence of the white race were as far 
as possible excluded." There can be no doubt that 
the annexation of Santo Domingo would have intro 
duced the influence of the white race once more. 
Dr. Howe s opinion in favor of annexation never 
changed during the few years that he lived after this 
expedition. His report and that of his fellow com 
missioners made no impression on his countrymen ; 
the scheme was voted down by a great majority, and 
the only durable and important consequence of the 
affair was the removal of Senator Sumner, by his 
party associates in the Senate, from the position he 
had held for ten years of Chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Foreign Relations. But Dr. Howe 
saw no occasion to modify the views which he had 



326 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

expressed, and " his happy faith in immutable prin 
ciples showed him for the Dominicans, as formerly 
for the Cretans, a future of peace and progress in the 
good time sure to come," as Mrs. Howe says. This 
scheme having failed, another was set on foot, and a 
company formed to obtain a lease of the peninsula 
of Samana, under favorable conditions, and with 
valuable rights and privileges. Dr. Howe anticipated 
great benefits from the realization of this project, 
and embraced it so warmly as to become one of the 
directors of the new enterprise, which was organized 
in the autumn of 1871, as the Samana Bay Company; 
several of his associates being those who had zeal 
ously urged annexation upon President Grant. This 
led him to make a second visit to Santo Domingo, 
where he spent two months in 1873. Capital was 
needed for the new undertaking, whose design, as 
Mrs. Howe says, "was chivalrous and grandiose." It 
was, in fact, quixotic ; and the doctor, along with 
many other and more practical qualities, had the 
nobler traits of that imaginary Spaniard, the typical 
Don Quixote. A loan was needed ; the Government 
of the little island republic passed from the hands of 
Baez, who favored the Samana Bay Company, into 
those of his enemies ; capitalists were shy of a country 
so fickle in its politics, and the loan came to nothing. 
While it was pending, however, Dr. Howe with his 
wife, in 1874, three years after his first landing on the 
island, again made a brief sojourn in Santo Domingo, 
partly to restore his failing health and partly to pro 
mote the interests of his Company. Mrs. Howe has 
thus described this, his last of many expeditions for 
the good of humanity: 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 327 

Yielding to urgent solicitation, Dr. Howe embarked March 
6, 1874, on board the steamer Tybee, in a feeble and suffering 
condition. At sea, he soon revived, and before the end of the 
voyage appeared to be in his usual health. He landed at the 
capital (Santo Domingo), and was soon in communication with 
the new President, Gonsales, whose attitude towards the 
Samana Bay Company was a matter of some anxiety. Dr. 
Howe was accompanied on this voyage by Colonel Fabens and 
Captain Samuels of New York, the three being charged with 
negotiations between the Samana Bay Company and the new 
government. The change in the government was found, upon 
a nearer view, to have been the work, not of a political party, 
but of a financial interest. The merchants of Puerta Plata, an 
important town on the sea-coast, jealous of the anticipated 
growth of Samana, had subscribed large sums of money in 
order to place at the head of the government a person devoted 
to their interest. Such a man they had found in President 
Gonsales. 

The conclusion of the whole may be briefly summed up as 
follows : The revolution prevented the loan ; the failure of the 
loan rendered the Company unable to fulfill its engagements. 
The new government took advantage of this failure, which it 
self had caused, to annul all concessions made by its predeces 
sor in favor of the Samana Bay Company. The matter being 
thus at an end, the whole party, much chagrined, reembarked 
on board of the Tybee. Dr. Howe and I were left at Samana, 
where we took up our abode in a pretty cottage formerly be 
longing to Colonel Fabens. The remainder of the party 
returned to New York. 

Here we arranged our plans and occupations to suit with a 
stay of some weeks, in a position of much isolation, but in a 
region of surpassing beauty and grandeur. I remember this 
time as delightful to both of us. The Doctor had been greatly 
troubled at the untoward termination of the Company s affairs, 
but his energetic nature never yielded long to any discourage 
ment. He applied himself diligently to the settlement of such 
claims and questions as lay within his reach and power. The 



328 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

beauty of the surrounding- country tempted him to frequent 
rides. He was early and late in the saddle, and dashed up and 
down the steep hillsides or Samana with all his old fearlessness. 
A row on the beautiful bay sometimes took the place of the 
excursions on horseback, in which I was not easily able to keep 
up with the swift pace of my companion. In the quiet of 
noonday he amused himself with the adventures of Don Quixote, 
which he read easily in the Spanish language. He often called 
me from my work to read me some favorite scene, which he 
esteemed too entertaining to be read alone. The cloudless 
skies and transparent waters, the gloom and grandeur of the 
tropical forest, the quaint and primitive ways of the people 
who surrounded us all this we enjoyed with a freshness of 
delight not unsurpassed by the enthusiasms of youth. The 
time flew swiftly by, and when at its end we turned our faces 
homeward, our satisfaction was not unmingled with regret. 

Before embarking for Santo Domingo, and again 
while at Samana in April, 1874, Dr. Howe wrote to 
his friend Bird two letters which are interesting in 
this connection, and also as containing his reflections 
on the death of Charles Sumner, which occurred in 
March, 1874. 

OAK GLEN, S. PORTSMOUTH, R. I. 1 

September i, 1873. 

MY DEAR BIRD : The fate of our Samana Bay Company 
will be decided at the monthly meeting on Wednesday. You 
have not studied the matter much, and do not know how 
important for the cause of freedom and for the spread of our 
commercial and political institutions in the West Indies is the 
question whether St. Domingo, " the key of the situation," 
shall be possessed by us, or by some European power. 

The Company may now possibly be taken from the control

from Newport, where he often spent his summers, and from which 
most of his letters to Mr. Bird were written.

of those who want to make it a miserable speculating- concern 
to kite it in the market, and then slink out without doing any 
thing for the island, and be put under the management of 
wiser and better men. I feel bound to be at the meeting, even 
at a loss of the pleasure, and the failure of friendly obligation, 
to attend your daughter s wedding. God bless her, and you ; 
and give you a large share of such happiness as I have had in 
the felicitous marriage of three daughters. 

Ever Faithfully, 

SAMUEL G. HOWE. 

SAMANA, April 9, 1874. 

MY DEAR BIRD : I am filled with sorrow and pain by the news 
of dear Sumner s death. It came in a chance number of the 
Herald, which merely alluded to it, as a thing sometime passed, 
and in mention of his will. Agassiz Sumner, les Dieux 
s en vont f I wrote to him shortly before I left, beseeching him 
to leave off brain-work and go to Europe or better to Hayti 
and try to check the backward progress towards barbarism of 
that interesting but misguided people. People throughout this 
region, while admitting Sumner s talent and goodness of heart, 
feel that the greatest opponent of their freedom and elevation 
has been removed. The Haytians, on the other hand, will 
mourn the loss of their great friend. 

The Samana Bay Company has at last been struck down by 
the British and German commercial men, who saw in its suc 
cess the destruction of their own trade from Puerto Platte ; and 
by the influence of the British Government, which foresaw in 
its success the spread of American ideas and institutions over 
their vast island, and all the surrounding ones. The ringer of 
the British Government, and the money of its secret revenue 
fund, are to be seen plainly in the late transactions. 

I linger here to enjoy the delicious climate and recover my 
health. I am heavier, stronger, hungrier, and more elastic in 
muscle and mind, than I have been during the past ten years. 
For a week past, every day has been even more balmy and de- 



330 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

licious than our hot summer days. I live in the open air all 
the time ; for windows and doors stand open day and night. 
We are perched in an eyrie upon a promontory, jutting into 
this magnificent bay, which is surrounded on all sides by pic 
turesque hills and mountains, covered with perpetual verdure, 
and clad to the very tops with timber and precious woods. At 
the foot of one hill is a little rocky basin, with a clean sandy 
beach, up which the breakers roll continuously : and in which 
I bathe every day, lying down in the surf and rubbing myself 
with the white sand. It is a positive pleasure merely to live 
in and enjoy such a climate, especially as we have none of 
the pests of our summer weather, no mosquitoes or flies, no 
fleas. The genial warmth of the day never grows into oppres 
sive heat ; for just as surely as the sun gets up toward the 
zenith, in comes the cool trade wind ; and at night the land 
breeze cools off the air, and one is glad to draw a blanket over 
him after going to bed. 

It is luxury to look around at the gorgeous panorama of 
hills and mountains, of diversified shape, and covered by the 
richest verdure. Verily, whose eyes have not seen the tropics, 
they have not seen the earthly glory of the Lord. And then 
the fruits are so plentiful, so varied, so fresh. Bananas, in 
varieties which you never see, fat and luscious, and five for one 
cent. Oranges cheaper than our apples ; pine-apples, bigger 
than your head, ten for a dollar; and mangoes, sapodillas, 
cayelias, the fruit of the papina flower ; the cactus and the 
like. Vegetables in profusion and of various kinds, sweet and 
cheap three crops of corn being gathered from the same spot 
in one year. Fish, varied and delicious; meats? ah! there 
we fail, for one can hardly get a bit of fresh meat that one can 
chew up and swallow. 

But the people the people ? Well, they are docile, temper- 
ale, courteous in manners, and rich in undeveloped resources, 
like their island ; but uncultivated, cunning, and untrustworthy 
in business. They are, however, superior in every respect 
higher by the whole head than the semi-barbarian negroes 
of Hayti, and superior in many respects to the inhabitants of

the neighboring islands , but but " better twenty years of 
Boston than a cycle of Cathay." Dear old Boston ! I long to 
see you again as soon as the rugged winter, which meets and 
throttles one like an enemy, is gone, and I trust I shall enter 
your streets and walk over the stumps of the Paddock elms 
before the middle of March ; and dine with " the boys " every 
Saturday afternoon. 1 

With kind regards to everybody, except B. B., I remain 
Ever faithfully,

Alas ! this glowing picture of health and renewed 
youth, was not long realized after his return home, 
as the two letters which follow will show. They are 
also noteworthy for the warmth of affection which 
they display towards men of such different natures as 
were the friends whom he names. The final tribute 
to Sumner is very touching and very true : 

NEWPORT, July 27, 1874. 

MY DEAR BIRD : I hoped, last week, to be able to go to 
Boston on Saturday, mainly that I might meet and condole with 
you in your great sorrow ; but I was still too feeble. Some 
times the feeling of sympathy in the sorrows of others helps 
lighten one s own, or ought to do so. There is my good friend 
Fabens, who, last week, was stricken down in sorrow for the 
fifth time, by the death of the fifth and last remaining boy. 
Hardly fifty himself, he has seen five goodly sons, grow up 
to near manhood, and blossom into hope of a goodly life, and 
then successively and slowly decline and die before his afflicted 
eyes. Fabens I know to be a gentleman, pure and upright in 
all his intents and actions, quixotic as some of them were, and 
yet, Sumner had the misfortune to be so blinded by passion

Club, and the Massachusetts Club the last an offshoot of the first.

and prejudice as to hold him up to the contempt of the country. 
I gather some hope for the correction and improvement of my 
own character when I see men so much higher and better than 
I am fall into such errors as I am conscious of in myself. 

I have been more ill since you were here than ever before, 
and some of my symptoms seem to forebode an unfavorable 
end, such as swelling of the feet, but I am now sensibly gain 
ing strength. 

It may be I shall have two or three years more of power of 
work ; but it is doubtful, and I abide my summons for depart 
ure. I hope, my dear Bird, that I may yet have opportunity of 
communion of spirit with you. 

With kind regards to your family, ever faithfully, 

SAM L G. HOWE. 

OAK GLEN, August 12, 1874. 

MY DEAR BIRD : If you, or any of yours, have been victims 
of chronic rheumatism or neuralgia, you will understand how 
the pain and malaise utterly paralyze one s volition, and how 
one can put off, from day to day, and from week to week, duties 
and even inclination. My suffering has been almost constant 
during about two months ; so that, although able to get into 
the saddle and ride about, I have shrunk from performance of 
duties, such agreeable ones even as writing to dear friends. 
Hence, my silence on the one subject near my heart, to wit, my 
sympathy and interest in you and your affairs. Two days ago, 
I suddenly felt a relief such as one who had been pinched and 
screwed up in iron armor until his joints were stiff and all his 
bones aching, would feel by having the inflexible armor ex 
changed for a silken vestment. This is the third day of my 
relief, and I begin to hope that the disease has left no seeds in 
my system which will sprout again. 

Glad, indeed, I am that you are to be so near us, 1 and hopeful 
of your presence under our roof. It would be very imprudent 



At Narragansett Pier, in Rhode Island.

for me to go in the boat, and I would not do it for any money ( 
although I would do it if it were the only way to see you. After 
to-day we shall have plenty of spare room, and would welcome 
you and any of your family. Mrs. Howe will be away to-mor 
row, but home again on Friday. 

I rejoice to hear of dear, good Wilson being better. Must 
he not sometimes feel as a man whose skin has been inflated 
with wind until he soared over people, and might fear lest some 
accident or rupture would let the wind out and himself down ? 
" Ah, my son," said Oxenstiern, " you do not understand with 
how little wisdom the world may be governed ! " 

I note, in silence and sadness, what you say about my ventur 
ing a criticism upon one of the public acts of my dearly-beloved 
Charlie. 1 Would I were worthy of the affection which he ac 
corded to me during so many years of an intimacy as great as 
between brothers, and greater than between ordinary brothers. 
Oh ! the times when we walked or drove daily together, spent 
our evenings together, and, finally, retiring to our chambers, 
with a door open between them, talked and communed about 
matters great or small until one dropped asleep with the music 
of the other s voice, subsiding from audible words into the 
music of dreams ! Dear Charlie ! the hope of renewed youth 
ful intercourse makes immortality all the more desirable ; al 
though by no immortal spirit can chaster, purer, nobler senti 
ments be expressed than were expressed by thy mortal lips ! 
Never an impure word, never a selfish wish, never a dishonest 
purpose ! Faithfully, SAM L G. HOWE. 

There was quixotism in the enthusiasm of Howe 
(or the impossible in Santo Domingo ; there was 
quixotism of another sort in the separation of Sum- 
ner from his party associates under the administration 
of Grant. But how rare and noble the quixotism of 
such men was, may be seen by the whole tenor of 



1 Charles Sumner. The Wilson mentioned just above wasSum- 
ner s Senatorial colleague Henry Wilson, then Vice-President.

their useful lives. 1 Their trusted friend, knows to 
them and to thousands who have loved him as 
" Frank Bird," speaking of them and of their three asso 
ciates, Horace Mann, John A. Andrew and Theodore 
Parker, said at Dr. Howe s funeral: 

Mann, Parker, Andrew, Sumner, Howe ! When has been 
granted to one generation the inspiration of five such men ? 
To the age which they lighted up and led, each has left an im 
perishable record " of noble ends by noble means attained." 
To us who knew and loved them, they have left precious mem 
ories and immortal hopes. 



1 Mrs. Howe, speaking of the years 1845-50, says : " A satirical 
production of those days presented Dr. Howe and Mr. Sumner in 
the light of two knights-errant of philanthropy, constantly on the 
lookout for some human right to vindicate, some injury to redress. 
Fortunate was it for the community that it possessed two such brave 
and disinterested champions of ideal and practical justice." 



CHAPTER V. 

AGE, INFIRMITY, AND DEATH. . j 

IN the summer of 1874 Dr. Howe was closing his 
73d year. It was 45 years since he had enjoyed the 
vigorous health of his Grecian campaign for his 
Corinthian fever never wholly left him, and gave 
him many days and nights of suffering during his 
whole public career. But his constitution had been 
firm, his habits always good, and his care of his own 
health more judicious than most medical men bestow 
when they are their own patients. Now, however, 
age had come upon him, with the labor and sorrow 
which Scripture has foretold to those who live 
beyond the allotted years of three score and ten. 
The remaining correspondence of Dr. Howe with Mr. 
Bird is pathetic, but full of interest ; and nothing 
that he has written throws more light on the 
character and the affections of our hero. The first 
in date is the letter written upon the first news of 
young Mr. Bird s death : 

OAK GLEN, July 12, 1874, 

MY DEAR BIRD : We were all greatly shocked by the sad 
news of your poor boy s death. We have sorrowed with you 
and for you, and continue to feel deep sympathy in your afflic 
tion. Greater sorrow is not given man to suffer than that for 
the untimely death of a child ; and the death of a son is probably 
more keenly felt by us fathers than any other. Up to this day, 

(335) 



336 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the death of my youngest boy, 1 my best beloved child, conies 
over me like a fresh pang ; and I go away and weep alone. I 
well know, therefore, the keen pangs which you must now be 
suffering. Time will soften, but never entirely remove them. 
Oh ! for the soothing and blessed hope of reunion beyond the 
the grave ! Why cannot we two mourning fathers enjoy it in 
full faith and assurance, without the damning doubt ? I vainly 
hope against hope ; and cling desperately to the best reason in 
favor of immortality, to wit, the existence within us all of this 
pleasing hope, this striving, this longing after immortality. Can 
God have created it within our hearts merely to cheat and dis 
appoint us ? No ! Let us then hope for a reunion of the loved 
and lost ones. 

I struggle on against the insidious disease which seems to 
have become chronic in my system at a period when the re 
cuperative power is nearly exhausted. My hope is that this 
three months storm will have exhausted its viperous force be 
fore the season of summer is entirely over. 

Give to your wife and family the assurance of the sympathy 
of me and of my family ; and trust that I am and shall be faith 
fully and affectionately, 

Your friend, 

SAMUEL G. HOWE. 

P. S. Monday noon I have this moment received your sad 
note. 

During this summer of 1874, Dr. Howe was still 
Chairman of the Board of State Charities, in which 
office I succeeded him, the next October. 2 The visit 



J Born in South Boston and named for his father known to 
Theodore Parker therefore as " Sammy South Boston." j 

2 A year before Dr. Howe resigned the chairmanship of this 
Board he had placed his resignation in my hands; to be sent to the 
Governor, if I thought best. In the note accompanying this, 
elated Newport, Sept. 25, 1873, he said : 

MY DEAR SANBORN : I inclose a letter to the Governor, to be 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 337 

to the great State almshouse, mentioned in the fol 
lowing letter, was that important one which led to 
the investigation and subsequent exposure by the 
colleagues of Dr. Howe, in 1876, soon after his death, 
of serious evils in the care of the sick and insane, 
and the general management of that almshouse. The 
last motion offered by Dr. Howe as a member of the 
Board, in April, 1875, was in favor of such an investi 
gation. 

OAK GLEN, Friday, August 21, 1874. 
MY DEAR BIRD . I am disappointed in my hope of your 
presence here, or of at least a letter from you. I went up to 
Boston on Monday last intending to accompany the Board of 
Charities upon its visit of inspection of Tewksbury Alms 
House on Wednesday ; but found myself too feeble to go. I 
returned here yesterday, rather better than worse for the jour 
ney. Verily old age diminishes greatly the recuperative power ; 
and there are certain disorders, which, as Dr. Bigelow says, 
old persons have no business to have. Oh ! how little do we 
appreciate the advantage, the beauty, the happiness-giving of 



used when and as you decide, I reluct at the last moment at giving 
up the chance of being useful in reconstructing the Board, and 
giving to it the power and dignity which it ought to enjoy. X s 
resignation opens the door of hope to having one with whom I 
could work more sympathetically. Another event makes more 
necessary the help of men who will work openly, ami frankly, irre 
spective of party influence. Confiding in your earnest and disin 
terested care for the efficiency of the Board, and the welfare of 
those wards whom it is a duty to watch over, I leave the matter in 
your hands. I do not propose to attend the next meeting, unless a 
telegram or letter from you should summon me. 

Faithfully, SAMUEL G. HOWE. 

I did not think it needful to send this resignation to Governor 
Washburn, and Dr. Howe continued at the head of the Board (of 
which I was then Acting Secretary) for a year longer. F. B. S. 



338 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

the capacity for work ! While we possess it we are more apt 
to complain of fatigue than to rejoice in the possession of the 
power. Fatigue! fatigue is not the natural result of work; 
but the punishment of the sin of overwork. Everyone who 
feels the pain, the discomfort of fatigue, expiates thereby, or 
suffers the consequence of his sin. The normal consequences 
of normal work are a pleasant feeling of well-being, and a posi 
tive increase of bodily ease and of happiness. 

I am not going to moralize, however, but to ask you to send 
me a prescription for and description of the means of exter 
minating house-flies ; or, rather, keeping their number down to a 
supportable degree. A fly has a right to a certain degree of 
hospitality ; but he has no right to light upon my nose, to tickle 
my skin, to soil my wall paper and furniture, nor to poison my 
food with his excrement. I believe that positive disease is en 
gendered, or at least aggravated, by the amount of fly excre 
ment which men swallow. 

Do, in mercy, send me the remedy. I would fain treat an 
individual fly as did my Uncle Toby the overgrown one "which 
had buzzed about his nose and tormented him unmerci 
fully all dinner-time." I would, like him, catch the insect in 
hand, go to the window, let him escape, and say, " Go, poor 
devil. I will not harm a hair of thy head ; the world is wide 
enough for thee and me ; " but, zounds ! a hundred thousand 
poor devils become a nuisance, a pest, a source of dirt, and 
nastiness, and disease. Send me the remedy ! or, better still, 
bring it. 

Mrs. Anagnos will return to the Institution to-morrow, and I 
wish much that you facilitate and promote the intercourse be 
tween your daughter and her. ... I want to increase 
her relations with good people. She is rather shy ; but I know 
that she has great regard for your daughter ; a sort of inheri 
tance of my weakness for you. 

All send regards, and our love, and he is as ever, yours, 

SAM L G. HOWE. 

I expect to go to Boston September 5th, and to remain until 
Saturday, P. M., for the purpose of meeting with the Club. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 339 

OAK GLEN, July 2, 1875. 

My DEAR BIRD : I was grieved to hear from some one that 
you complained about my not having called upon you during the 
three days I was in Boston. My clear old boy ! I was unable ; 
and not free from pain in all the time. And, besides, where 
find you ? I wanted enough to find time and means to get at 
you ; but, you know that pain and illness deprive one of half 
one s powers. 

I have been quite ill here most of the time ; but am free from 
pain to-day : aud rejoicing in the company of dear Maud. I 
have fearful and useful teachings of the ill-effects of this 
woman s movement and concern in public affairs upon domes 
tic duties, relations, and affections. Horace (Mann) would not 
have had it so ; neither would dear Theodore (Parker) ; neither 
would Charles (Sumner). It was our rare good fortune to know 
and love them all. Horace appreciated you more thoroughly 
than did Theodore, who was more taken up with general prin 
ciples and public interests than with individual affections. 
Rarely indeed do really great men take deep interest in the 
relations between individuals, and in the moral affections ; but 
Horace did 

I hope you will see Mrs. Howe, who is in Boston, and who 
esteems you very highly. I shall probably be in Boston the 
latter part of next week, and if I do not see you it will be 
because there is no Parker s. 

The time for my dear son s departure for Europe draws nigh, 
and I feel anxious about it. 

Let me hear from you, and believe me to be ever faithfully 
and affectionately your friend. 

S. G. HOWE. 

P. S. What do you think of the plan of my bringing an 
action in a U. S. Court against the city of Boston for recover 
ing of some five or six thousand dollars paid under protest, for 
taxes on Mrs. Howe s personal property, already and fully paid 
in the city of New York ? 



34 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

OAK GLEN, near Newport, July 20, 1875. 

MY DEAR BIRD : I am slowly recovering, I trust, from the 
severest malady which I have suffered for a score or two of 
years, I was at one time much depressed by the belief that I 
had Bright s disease. Chloral did me more harm than good. 
I tried morphia, etc. At last, under advice of Dr. Francis, I 
left off medicine and all food or drink except pure fresh milk, 
under which my bad symptoms subsided, I got relief from 
pain and am mending. It was, however, terribly and painfully 
depressing to my moral nature. Mrs. H. proved a devoted nurse 
and tender wife, and displayed patience, watchfulness, and 
kindness. It was very dark, dear Bird, during a week and 
more. I saw no light or hope for this world, and was uneasy 
and unhappy about the next. Oh ! how I wished for your 
soothing society ! Friends came and wrote, and there was no 
lack of sympathy. I trust that the worst is over, and that with 
my quart of fresh milk daily, I may yet live for some useful 
ness. 

I hear nothing from you or of your circle, I suppose you 
are scattered. I have my dear Maud with me, and Mrs. Flossy 
Hall 1 and her two children. My place has improved very 
much ; it is now lovely to look upon, and very enjoyable. I 
wish earnestly that you could come and stay some days with 
your old and fast friend, 

SAMUEL G. HOWE. 

Mr. Bird accepted this invitation, and found Dr. 
Howe indeed very wretched, and seeking relief in that 
which distressed all about him, groans and exclama 
tions. His friend soothed him and yet did not fail 
to remonstrate with him for what seemed an unmanly 
act, all the more painful in one so courageous as Dr. 
Howe. 

In life s last scene what prodigies surprise, 
Fears of the brave and follies of the wise ! - 



1 Daughter of Dr. Howe. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 34! 

But the next letter shows how well the kindly re 
proof was taken : 

OAK GLEN, August 6, 1875. 

MY DEAR BIRD : I hear, through Friend Earle, 1 that you 
are looking fresh and well. I have profited much by the pre 
cepts which you gave me, and the living example which you 
set me. 

The effort to suppress groaning is partly successful. I am 
much better than when you were here. The trouble has sub 
sided, and returns only after some indiscretion of diet or taking 
cold, when I have to expect sleepless nights. I have taken to 
milk, upon which I improved so much that my doctor sent me 
word to take half-raw, red, and bloody beef, or something of 
the kind. He began to surmise that I might get entirely well 
on the lacteal fluid. 

My dear Harry will sail from Boston for Great Britain on the 
I2th of August. Try to see him, and give to him and to his 
wife some wise, fatherly talk. He can be heard of at No. 20 
Bromfield street ; if you cannot call to see him, leave a note for 
him, bidding him to go to see you. If you can get any letters 
for him, or will put me in the way of doing it, it will be a very 
great service. Do you know our Minister or Consul at Lon 
don, Paris, or Berlin, or Vienna well enough to introduce the 
pair? 

I hope to meet you the next time I go to Boston ; meanwhile 
I hope and trust you may go on improving in health. 

With best regards to your faithful and useful daughter, 

Faithfully, S. G. HOWE. 

In the letter following this in date (printed on a 
previous page) he speaks of the depression following 
the news of George Finlay s death, says he is the 
last survivor of the Philhellenes, and signs himself

of Dr. Howe in the Board of Charities. 



34 2 1&gt;R- s. G. HOWE. 

"sometime yclept the Chevalier," alluding to his 
membership in the Greek Legion of Honor. But 
now comes the last letter, written but four weeks be 
fore his death. 

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 11, 1875. 

MY DEAR BIRD : I am alive, but in a deplorable state on 
account of following your earnest and repeated advice, and 
taking a dose of Chloral, which nearly killed me. I took it 
very reluctantly last night, and it came near bringing me to an 
end before nine o clock this morning. I wish I could tell you 
all about it. I can only say, beware of advising old and feeble 
persons to take such a potent and variable dosing as Chloral. It 
is potently medicinal, but liable to be poisonous and speedy and 
fatal in its operations. Nothing but your presence will ever 
get any more of it down the throat of your old and affectionate 
friend, S. G. HOWE. 

Of these last weeks Mrs. Howe says : 

He returned from Newport to Boston before the first of Octo 
ber, 1875, and seemed at first to have benefited by the change. 
He walked as usual between his own house and the Blind Asy 
lum, and, with the aid of his carriage, visited the Idiot School. 
But he felt, and we felt, that a change was drawing nigh. On 
Christmas Day, he was able to dine with his family, and to 
converse with one or two invited guests. But, on the first of 
January, he remarked that he should not live through the 
month. This presentiment, though not at the time regarded 
by those to whom he mentioned it, did not deceive him. On 
January 4th, while up and about as usual, he was attacked by 
sudden and severe convulsions, followed by insensibility ; and 
on January 9, 1876, he breathed his last, surrounded by his 
family, and without pain or apparent consciousness. 

I had seen him often during this long illness, had 
visited him at Oak Glen, and played whist with him 
to while awtiy the hours of pain and uneasiness. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 343 

Upon the first news of his apoplectic attack, I has 
tened to South Boston, and to his bedside, but alas ! 
he was unconscious. As he lay there, free from pain 
and flushed slightly with the fever of his disease, I 
was struck with his resemblance to our heroic friend, 
John Brown, the same resolute and tender cast of 
features, the same firm nose, white beard, and gray 
locks. He was indeed of a like temper, though so 
different in training, in versatility and fortune. Mr. 
Bird has a tenderer reminescence of his final inter 
view with this comrade of many years. He says : 

At my last visit to him, two days before he was struck down, 
I found him in extreme suffering. Soon after I went in, he 
said with great gravity and emphasis, " I shall not live to the 
end of this month." I laughed it away ; but yet, may it not 
have been one of those mysterious shadows which coming 
events sometimes surely cast before ? During the interview, 
he charged me with most affectionate messages to my family, 
repeating them as though under the same premonition. As I 
rose to leave, he followed me into the hall, threw his arm 
around my neck, and with a beautiful smile said, " My dear old 
fellow, let me kiss you," and gave me a warm kiss. Within 
two days the thick curtain fell. 

The news of Dr. Howe s death was received by the 
whole community with sincere sorrow. The Gover 
nor of Massachusetts communicated it to the Legis 
lature, then in session, which passed appropriate 
votes commemorating his services to the State ; and 
the same Chief-Magistrate (Governor Rice) presided 
at the memorial meeting in his honor, held at the 
Music Hall, in Boston, February 8, 1876. A former 
Governor (A. H. Bullock) in an address at this 
meeting well described Dr. Howe s public character 
in these words : 



344 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

It would be an omission in my memory of an official con 
nection with him, extended over three years, if I were not 
to bear my testimony to his almost ubiquitous attendance 
on his work. He was at South Boston, he was at his office 
in town, he was at the rooms of the Board of Charities, he 
was at the Executive Chamber, he was sometimes at his own 
house, he was always where duty called. He seemed capa 
ble to drive all the reforms and charities abreast ; and yet 
he was seldom on a strain ; always having an air we all 
liked of a man of business, of a man of the world, what 
Carlyle would call " a good, broad, buffeting way of proce 
dure " ; of dauntless force of character, of firmness that was 
impassive, of modesty that was unfeigned; a little mutinous 
whenever governors attempted to interfere with his methods, 
but that was of no consequence, since he was mutinous to re 
volt whenever he saw the image of God oppressed, or 
wronged, or neglected. Nor will I leave him without an al 
lusion to his last great work. I refer to his association with 
a few other gentlemen, more active in this than he was, whose 
names I might call if some of them were not present, in or 
ganizing, I may say in establishing, under the endowment 
of Clarke, that noble institution on the banks of the Connec 
ticut, where the deaf, no longer dumb, learn to discern a 
voice from a mute breath, to catch human language at sight 
from human lips. I look to that Institution with perfect as 
surance of the greatest results, and I recur not Avithout sensi 
bility to the days when we thought him essential to us in 
laying its foundations. 

Of his friendships, and of those rarest qualities that 
attracted friends to his side, as the loadstone draws 
the metal, Mr. Bird said on the same occasion : 

Dr. Howe s circle of acquaintances was very large. For more 
than a quarter of a century his quiet back office in Bromfield 
street was the resort not only of sufferers and the friends of 
sufferers from " every ill that flesh is heir to," but of the noble 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 345 

men and women of Massachusetts and the world. There were 
originated, discussed, and put into the way of execution most 
of the philanthropic enterprises that had for their object the 
amelioration of the woes or redress of the wrongs of humanity. 
Of friends in the true sense of the word, to whom he gave his 
full trust and confidence, he had, I think, but few. 

" But those he had, and their adoption tried, 
He grappled to his soul with hooks of steel." 

And all such, the longer they knew him, were more and more 
impressed with his fidelity to convictions of truth and duty, his 
single-hearted consecration to the welfare of others, and his 
rare self-forgetfulness I do not mean unselfishness merely, but 
an entire unconsciousness of any special services he had ren 
dered or could render to the world. I never knew him volun 
tarily to relate any of the heroic or benevolent deeds of his life. 
During his periods of suffering, I sometimes tried to divert 
him, by referring to some stirring incidents of the past ; and 
only last summer I thus induced him to describe his expedition 
in aid of the Polish refugees in the presence of one of his 
daughters, who, I think, heard it then for the first time from 
his own lips. 

"This is the man," said Edward Everett Hale, him 
self an active philanthropist, " who redeemed that 
word philanthropist from the scorn which was falling 
upon it, and which I have half a right to say it de 
served. The impression that the word philanthropist 
gives even now, in half the civilized world, is of a 
person with long hair, who talks of something about 
which he knows nothing. And Dr. Howe with his 
practical ability, with his knowledge of men, able to 
use everybody just as far as his purpose went, per 
fectly unmindful of reputation he made himself of 
no reputation he took upon himself the form of a 
servant, this man has redeemed that word of words 



346 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

from such base sneers, and placed it where it belongs. 
If he led every man and woman, sooner or later, to 
take his view of any one of our charitable systems, 
it was because he did not speak and act without 
studying to the bottom the whole subject he dealt 
with. Men had to follow where such a man 
directed." 



CHAPTER VI. 

CHARACTER AND RESULTS. 

THE language of friendly eulogy is seldom more 
just than were these tributes to the lamented dead ; 
but in a biography written fifteen years after Dr. 
Howe s death, something needs to be said in addition 
to these truthful words, and beyond what the vicissi 
tudes of life, as here related, have called forth as we 
passed them briefly in review. There has been time 
since 1876 to see this romantic character in perspec 
tive, and to separate what was merely accidental and 
a part of his age from what belonged to the type and 
structure of his personal being. 

Viewed thus, it occurs to be said that his youth 
was romantic and adventurous, not only from his 
own impulses, but because the early years of the cen 
tury invited romance and hazardous deeds. It was 
the age of Napoleon, to whom for a time all things 
seemed possible ; of Byron, who was the Napoleon 
of the world of letters ; of Scott, who inspired in all 
his readers that is, in all who could read at all the 
sentiment of chivalry in other than the feudal forms 
as well as in those time-honored accessories of feud 
alism which so pleased that historical and poetic mind. 
Of all the intellectual influences of his youth, it is 
probable that Scott s was with Dr. Howe the most 

(347) 



348 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

potent and the most intimate; and be it remembered 
that this " Wizard of the North/ who had thrown 
such luster over mediaeval customs and mouldering 
castles, and the loyal bonds of feudalism, was also, in 
his " Heart of Mid-Lothian " the founder of the later 
school of philanthropic fiction in which Dickens and 
Mrs. Stowe became so illustrious. Philanthropy, in 
deed, is the inward spirit of chivalry; and seldom 
have the two been more closely united than in Howe. 
For, be it observed, this strong bent of his nature 
which showed itself in Greek and German adven 
tures, and afterwards in the founding of instructive 
charities, was only called into action a little earlier by 
the military spirit of his boyhood and by the poetry 
and the example of Byron. As the Jesuits said of 
Sir Kenelm Digby, " If he had been dropped out of the 
clouds in any part of the world, he would have made 
himself respected ; " so, Dr. Howe, wherever he 
found himself, would have gone upon some errand 
of mercy or justice; so strong in him was that senti 
ment which the ethical pedants since his time call 
" altruism." He was born to benefit others, and by 
choice he selected for his benefactions those who 
could least repay his service with their own the 
blind, the deaf, the insane, the idiotic. He thought 
it unsuitable to practice medicine and surgery for 
money; nor was he at any time very willing to sell 
his service, preferring to bestow it without recom 
pense. He would have agreed heartily with that 
definition of his class among men which said, " A 
gentleman is one who has something to give, not 
something to sell;" and there was, indeed, some 
pride mingled with his benevolence, showing that 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 349 

he had not reached that elevated degree of saintli- 
ness, where humility is the chief requisite. 

His was by no means a faultless character. He 
had the strength and also the weakness of an active 
temperament ; he was hasty and sometimes harsh or 
exacting, as well as tender and generous. He could 
be as capricious and as persistent as if caprice and 
persistence were not antagonistic qualities. He 
loved power, though he seldom sought it ; and was 
often unjust to his opponents, of whom, first and last, 
he had a great many. To his intimates he was the 
most charming of companions, with that " terrible gift 
of familiarity," of which the Frenchman speaks ; he 
was then full of good humor, appreciative, affable ; 
but sometimes, and to some persons he was anything 
but charming. He inspired respect, however, where 
he did not win affection ; and though he was some 
times, as Carlyle said of himself, " gey ill to deal 
wi , he was easily forgiven for the temperamental 
and surface faults of a nature essentially superior, 
noble, and winning. In aspect as well as in char 
acter he was in his prime a true type of the educated 
American lithe, impetuous, an Arab in figure and 
in horsemanship ; dark in eye and hair, but with a 
glowing color and a manner that bespoke energy 
tempered by inward courtesy. Till within a few 
months of his death it was his custom to spend some 
part of every day on horseback ; and he was a lover 
of the horse, and the humbler servants of man. He 
was a good gardener, too, and in the intervals of his 
busy life he grew pears and grapes a fact which 
Theodore Parker did not fail to record in that half- 
humorous, half-serious epitaph which he wrote for 



350 DR- s. G. HOWE. 

his friend from Santa Cruz, after parting from him 
for the last time, in February,

but never ceasing to act, which might cause the un

He fought for Poland the unconquered, 

Visited those in prison, 

Made the blind see, the dumb speak, 

The foolish understand, 

As well as he could. 



352 DR. S. G. HOWE. 

smile now and then. It was a sort of quixotism, a 
little at variance with the fashion of the times, and 
of the circle in which he oftenest moved. But when 
those who smiled looked at the great results attained, 
and saw his most quixotic undertakings at last 
crowned with success, they wondered more than 
they jested at him. Hardly any enterprise to which 
he put his hand zealously failed in the end to prosper, 
though it might be twenty or thirty years after his 
effort and his prediction of ultimate success. For he 
had the insight of genius ; he understood the logic 
of events and situations, and could thus foresee what 
was sure, sooner or later, to come. The education of 
the blind and the deaf, the training of idiots, the best 
care of the hopeless insane, of poor children, of the 
dependent classes in general, have already followed, 
or seem about to follow in the track which he marked 
out thirt)r, forty, or fifty years ago. 

Persons gifted with this unerring divination of the 
future do not need, and seldom possess those instru 
mentalities of talent which make men famous in 
literature, in politics, or in the arts of life. Dr. Howe 
never acquired, nor perhaps ever sought to attain, elo 
quence in oratory or a finished style in writing; indeed 



He restored the insane to their 

Right mind, 

He freed the slave. 

He made his garden yield the choicest pears. 

He lived about seventy-seven years. 
Prisoners bewail him, blind men weep for him, 

The dumb lament, idiots mourn, 
And the insane cry out for him ; 
And the slaves sit down in the dust. 



THE COUNSELS OF ACTIVE AGE. 353 

he was rather averse, as men of action often are, to 
oratory and those who profess it. For literature he 
had a hearty admiration, but it was the effect rather 
than the form of good writing that he admired. He 
spoke with fluency three or four of the languages of 
Europe, and could make himself understood in most 
of them ; was a scholar as well as a man of affairs ; 
he wrote always with facility and often with ^great 
vigor, in a style savoring, as did his keen and logical 
intellect, rather of the French than the English 
characteristics. He was impatient of the labor of 
writing, though never very well satisfied with what 
he wrote, and apt to leave it unfinished and un- 
trimmed, trusting to the force of his ideas to carry 
his meaning along. 

There grew up in Boston and its neighborhood, in 
Dr. Howe s early and middle life, a group of remark 
able men ; to whom others not of that neighborhood 
were attracted by congeniality of aspirations or 
tastes. Such were Channing, Emerson, Webster, Ev 
erett, Allston, the Danas, Alcott, Hawthorne, Long 
fellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Garrison, Theodore 
Parker, Horace Mann, Sumner, Agassiz, Choate, An 
drew, Wendell Phillips, James Freeman Clarke. Each 
of these men and women was capable of some excel 
lent part in the work of life, and no one of them iter 
ated or greatly Imitated the task of any other. To 
us who come after them they seem as one group, car 
ried through two successive generations of men; but, 
in fact, they formed a number of small groups drawn 
together by accident or by affinity, and often con 
tending warmly, group against group. Among all 
these, and others whom I have not named, Dr. Howe 



354 *&gt;R, S, G. HOWE. 

stood forth, as individual and almost as conspicuous 
as any. He was neither saint, nor poet, nor orator, nor 
matchless prose-writer; neither great lawyer, nor man 
of unquestioned eminence in science, nor artist, nof 
seer, nor persistent champion of a single great cause; 
but his own work, such as it was, drew the attention of 
all. He was known and welcomed in all these groups, 
and he reflected as much luster on his native city as 
most of those enumerated. He was of their time and 
endowed with a portion of their spirit ; he was, for 
half a century, one of those few persons who could 
not be omitted when Boston was described ; and, like 
the rest of these able men, he has left no direct suc 
cessor. Unique in his position, broad in his sympa 
thies, yet not sympathizing with all; a genuine Ameri 
can democrat, and yet, by instinct and culture a gen 
tleman, nay, a chevalier he mingled many contrasted 
qualities. He gained distinction without seeking it, 
valued it but little, was more deeply interested in 
ideas than institutions, and was impatient of the 
common worldly success, of fame, and the mere sound 
of titles. New England will see many illustrious 
men hereafter, but hardly any like him, so peculiar 
was Dr. Howe in his talents, in the circumstances of 
his career, and in the far-reaching results of his phil 
anthropic activity,
