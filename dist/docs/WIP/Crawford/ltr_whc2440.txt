Dear Sir, - The events which have within a few days 
passed in this city, and in its neighborhood, have changed every 
thing in France but the character of the Parisians, and perhaps 
of Frenchmen in general. 
</p><p>
On the 30th ult. a battle was fought in the vicinity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> 
by the French troops under the Duke of Ragusa, amounting to 
between fifteen and twenty thousand men, and the grand allied 
army. The loss was considerable on both sides, but that of the 
Allies was more than double. It is estimated from eight to ten 
thousand men. The disparity in the loss was the result of the 
strong positions of the French troops, and the desire of the allies 
to get possession of the capital before the arrival of the Emperor Napoleon, who was advancing by rapid marches upon their 
rear. This desire was so predominant that they made no attempt to turn these positions, but marched directly up to the entrenchment's, where they were repulsed four or five times. The battle commenced about 4 o'clock A. M. and finished about the same 
time in the evening. The Duke of Ragusa entered into a convention by which he agreed to evacuate the city, taking with 
him all his baggage, ammunition and artillery. 
</p><p>
The next day the Emperor of Russia and King of Prussia entered <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> at the head of about fifty thousand of the finest troops 
in the world. The remainder of their immense army either defiled 
on the north or south side of the city, or remained in their positions on the east, which was the field of battle. The Emperor of Russia, with his Minister of Foreign Relations, went directly to the house of the Prince of Benevento, who convened 
the Senate the same evening, and had himself and three of his 
friends, with one devoted Bourbonite, named to the provisional 
government. The Senate had deposed Napoleon Bonaparte, and 
directed the provisional government to form a Constitution, which 
has been accomplished, and accepted by the Senate and the small 
portion of the Legislative corps who are now in Paris. The Moniteur of this day contains this Constitution, which you will probably see before you receive this letter. The monarchy is declared 
to be hereditary in the house of Bourbon in the male line. The 
present Senators remaining Senators of the realm by the same 
tenure. The Senate to consist of one hundred and fifty at least, 
and not more than two hundred. The ancient and new nobility to 
remain. All Frenchmen to be capable of filling all the offices of 
the government. The members of the legislative corps to hold 
their offices for five years, and to be elected directly by the people. 
</p><p>
The proceedings of the Senate and of the provisional government, have overturned the authority of the Emperor with his 
army, and especially with his ablest generals. He seems to have 
sunk without an effort, "at least without an effort corresponding in 
any degree with his former fame. Such at least is the conclusion which I draw from the facts which are communicated to the 
public. It is possible that these facts may be misrepresented. I 
believe, however, that it is certain, that he has agreed to retire 
with his family to the Isle of Elba upon a pension of six millions of livres. From the moment that he saw that it was impossible for him to reign he ought to have died. The manner 
was in his election. A strange infatuation seems to have influenced his conduct during the last six months. Still relying 
upon his talents and his power he refused, at Prague, to secure 
at least the neutrality of Austria, by giving her every thing she 
required. After having retreated across the Rhine he reluctantly 
accepted the basis which the Allies proposed, and which there is 
some reason to believe they were sincerely disposed to adopt. 
Lord Castlereagh's mission, however, according to the best view* 
of the subject which I have been able to take, was intended 
solely to prevent this accommodation. Time will prove the accuracy or inaccuracy of this opinion. There must have been 
great address employed in managing the Emperor of Austria, 
who had rejected all idea of overthrowing the reigning dynasty. 
The infatuation of the Emperor, and his arrogance to his father-in-law (if we are to credit reports apparently well founded), 
greatly contributed to the success of the arts employed by the 
British Secretary. That the Emperor of Austria has been duped 
is clearly established by the declaration of the Allies after the 
breaking up of the Congress at Chatillon, and by the conduct of 
Lord Wellington, This declaration states that up to the 15th 
of March they were ready to make peace with the Emperor Napoleon, whereas the address of Lord Wellington, on the 2d of 
February, declares Louis XVIIL and raises the Bom-bon standard. The introduction of the ancient dynasty is not acceptable to the great body of the people of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>. Even now, after the Senate and provisional government have declared for that 
dynasty, there is not one man in a hundred who puts on the 
white cockade. On the day of the entry of the allied sovereigns, all the persons devoted to their ancient kings endeavored to make themselves as conspicuous as possible, and to conceal the smallness of their numbers by continual change of place. 
Exertions were made to excite popular feeling and popular tumult, but without effect. But for the National Guard popular tumult 
would have been excited, perhaps, but not in favor of the Bourbons. If the mob of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> had been put in motion it would have been in favor of a free government. 
</p><p>
The men now in power would, as far as I have been able to judge, have preferred the succession of the King of Rome, 
with a regency provided by the Empress ; but the Emperor Alexander, who, under the modest exterior of submitting every 
thing to the will of the French people, dictates to the Senate and provisional government, at least this article of their Constitution. 
</p><p>
I did not anticipate precisely the manner in which this European peace was to he consummated. I most sincerely wish you 
complete success in your negotiations, although I apprehend that 
great difficulties will be presented. Under existing circumstances, if peace is made, I presume that the treaty will be very 
short, concluding nothing but peace and the restoration of what territory may be in the hands of either party by conquest, if there is any such. 
</p><p>
P. S . I send this by the Secretary of the Danish Legation, who sets out immediately for Copenhagen, which gives me no 
opportunity for reflection or revision of this hasty scrawl, as I have just been informed of the fact of his setting out.
