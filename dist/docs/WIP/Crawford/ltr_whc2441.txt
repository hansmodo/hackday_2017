Mt dear Sir, - Mr. Carroll arrived a few days ago, and 
brought me your letters of the 10th and 14th ultimo. The 
change in the place of the negotiation for peace will enable me 
to write to you frequently, and will afford me the pleasure of 
receiving from you the most interesting details upon the advances 
which you shall make from day to day in the work of peace. 
</p><p>
My expectations of a happy result are not strong. The arrogance 
of the enemy was never greater than at the present moment. 
The infatuation of that nation exceeds almost the possibility of 
peace. The ministry are represented as being very temperate 
and moderate. In my former communications I have stated the 
reasons which I have for doubting the sincerity of their professions of moderation. I may have been wrong in my inferences. 
I wish that the result may correct me of this error. Admitting 
the possibility that the British ministers will consent to make 
peace, without deciding any thing upon the question of impressment, will your instructions justify you in accepting it ? So far 
as I am acquainted with the nature of those instructions, their 
letter will not. But these instructions were given at a time when 
the great changes which have intervened in Europe were not 
only unknown, but wholly unexpected. What will be the effect 
which these changes will produce upon the determinations of 
the Government ? Will the Government, after they are informed 
of these changes, give directions to conclude peace, leaving the 
question of impressment open to further negotiation ? Will it 
consent to a peace which shall make no mention of this question ? 
[ presume it will. If the negotiators shall be of this opinion, 
ought they to hesitate to accept, in the most prompt manner, of 
a peace which they are convinced the Government will instruct 
them to make, as soon as it is informed of the actual state of 
things ? I should answer promptly. No. A peace which omits 
the question of impressment entirely, will leave the American 
Government at perfect liberty to apply the proper remedy, whenever the evil shall be felt. I do not believe that you will be 
placed in a situation to determine this question. I believe they 
will insist upon the unqualified admission of their right to impress on board American vessels at sea. This, I trust, will never 
be conceded. It would be better to return to our colonial relations with our mother country, than submit to this condition. If 
it must be conceded, a federal President must make the concession. As there is but a faint glimmering of hope that the negotiation will terminate in peace, the next important point to be 
obtained is, that it shall break off, upon principles which will 
convince the American people, of all parties, that peace can be 
obtained only by the most vigorous prosecution of the war. I 
have the most unlimited confidence in the skill and address of 
our negotiators. I am perfectly satisfied that the negotiation will be conducted with a view to affect this important point. I have 
seen and conversed with several Englishmen in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, upon the 
question of impressment, and find the most of them very ignorant 
and arrogant. Sir Thomas Baring is an exception to this remark. 
But his mode of adjusting this question is wholly inadmissible. 
He proposes that no impressment shall be made in vessels engaged in the coasting trade - that no impressment shall take 
place in vessels engaged in the foreign trade, in sight of the 
American coast. He thinks the ministry will hardly go so 
far. A merchant of the name of Wilson says that an arrangement of a different nature would be satisfactory to the 
nation. It is this, that when a British officer should visit an 
American vessel, and designate any one of the crew as a British 
subject, and he should admit the fact, that the master or captain 
of the American vessel should deliver him up. If the man should 
deny that he is an Englishman, and the captain should refuse to 
deliver him, that the visiting officer should endorse the ship's 
papers with the name of the sailor, and with his allegation. The 
question of nationality shall be inquired into, at the first port at 
which the vessel shall touch, where there is a British consul ; if 
found against the sailor, the captain shall pay a fine, or the expenses of the investigation, and the sailor shall be delivered up. 
If for him, the British Consul, or if in England, the British Government should be subject to the same payment. He says, that 
in the case of an admitted British subject, if the American captain should declare that the loss of the man would endanger the 
vessel, that he should be kept on board until the vessel entered 
the port of destination, when the captain should be bound to 
deliver him over to the British Consul, or officer authorized to 
receive him. I see no objection to this plan, except that the 
captain should not be permitted to deliver any man who denies 
the charge, until it is established against him. This arrangement will give the enemy the absolute control over their own 
seamen, as far as the fact of nationality can be established. It 
at the same time secures American sailors from arbitrary impressment. If the vessel should be bound to the ports of a nation 
at war with England, it might be made the duty of the American 
Consul at such port to ship him on board of an American vessel 
bound to England, to the United States, or to a neutral port, 
where the fact should be promptly settled. I do not believe that 
this arrangement will be acceptable to the Government of England, because I do not believe they will be satisfied with any 
arrangement which will prevent their seizing upon the sailors 
of other nations. If I am correct in my conjecture, the proposition will embarrass them, and the rejection will prove, to the 
most prejudiced mind, that they are determined to make the 
American sailors fight the battles which are to rivet the chains 
of slavery, which they have been forging for all maritime states, 
and especially for the seafaring men of these states, for a century 
past. I have thought that this arrangement ought to be suggested to you, because it may not have occurred to any one of 
our ministers. I think it highly improbable that the English 
negotiators will make any proposition of this nature. If their 
pretensions shall be so moderate as to afford rational ground for 
discussion, this arrangement may be proposed with advantage. 
</p><p>
If their views are so unreasonable as to exclude discussion, 
that of itself will have the happy effect of convincing all parties 
that the peace must be obtained by the sword alone. But even 
in this case, when the rejection of the arrangement will be certain, I am inclined to believe that the proposition, coming from 
the American ministers, will have a tendency to elucidate the 
extent of the concessions which they demand upon this point, 
more satisfactorily than any other mode which has been presented 
to my mind. Mr. Wilson is a true John Bull, but, I believe, a 
very honest man, and, I am sure, sincerely desirous of peace. 
The rejection of the arrangement will probably have some effect 
upon the English nation itself. If this principle will be satisfactory to Mr. Wilson, it is probable that it will be acceptable to 
many others - in fact, to all reasonable men - to all men who 
have not formed the foolish and extravagant idea of re-colonizing 
the United States. 
</p><p>
I have felt that it was my duty to present this subject to you 
in its fullest extent. I have verbally communicated it to Mr. Bayard. It is probable that Mr. Wilson may have communicated this idea to Mr. Gallatin, as he made his acquaintance, and that 
of Mr. Bayard's also, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. He had not suggested it to the latter. 
</p><p>
I will obtain the necessary passports for you, and send them 
on to Ghent, as the Mojiiieur of yesterday has notified that it is 
necessary to have them to leave the kingdom. I suppose it is 
equally necessary'' to enter it. Prom the letters which I have 
written to you, you will perceive that some of my inferences have been proved, by subsequent events, to be incorrect, I 
reasoned from the facts as they were presented to my mind, and 
I feel no mortification at the result. If it was my duty to communicate every thing to you which I knew, or believed, at the 
moment of writing, I do not feel any mortification that some of 
my conjectures, some of my inferences, have proved to be incorrect. 
</p><p>
I have authority to draw on the bankers of the United States 
for diplomatic intercourse, and for disbursements for distressed 
seamen. Under the first head, I can satisfy Mr. Carroll's expenses, and shall do it with great pleasure on his own account, 
as well as upon your request. I am well acquainted with his 
father, and entertain the highest esteem for him. 
</p><p>
This letter will be delivered to you by Mr. Bayard, who, I 
am happy to inform you, coincides with me in every question 
relative to the peace. He believes with me, if the nation 
can be united in the prosecution of the war, that the interest of 
the United States will be promoted by the failure of the negotiation. He will heartily unite with you in bringing the discussions 
to a close that will secure this great object. I think, from the 
English papers, that no armistice has been agreed upon. I rejoice that it has failed. It might have done us much injury, 
but could not possibly do us any good. God bless you, my dear 
sir, and bless your labors, and make them useful to your country. 
Mine, I believe, are like water spilled on the ground, that can 
never be gathered. Adieu.
