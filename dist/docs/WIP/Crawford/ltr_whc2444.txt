My dear Sir, - The departure of Messrs. Blanchard and Elliot, for Ghent, enables me to send you the passport which I have 
obtained for you. They will be able to give you the ephemeral news of this capital. 
</p><p>
I dined a few days ago in company with the Marquis of Buckinghamshire. We conversed long and freely upon the subject 
of the approaching negotiation. The result of our conversation 
was that there can be no peace. He insists absolutely that the 
question of impressment shall be settled in this treaty, and of 
course, that it shall be settled entirely in their favor. He attempted to derive their right to take (for he insisted upon dropping the word impressment, to which I assented) their seamen from om- vessels, from the law of nations. 
</p><p>
The undersigned, ministers, etc., have the honor of recalling 
to the attention of his B. M. P. the note of the undersigned of 
the 30th ult., and to so much of what has passed in the subsequent conferences as is deemed material to the present communication. 
</p><p>
In that note they stated that they objected to one of the alterations proposed by the B. P. in the first article, and to the modification which they also proposed of the eighth article, of the project which the undersigned had submitted for consideration. 
</p><p>
By the first article of this project, the undersigned had proposed that there should be a mutual restitution of all territories, 
places and possessions, taken by either party during the war, without exception. The alteration in question, proposed by the B. 
P., contemplates a restitution of what belongs to either party. 
The alteration would be free from objection, if there were no 
places in the occupation of either party, which are claimed by 
the other. In that case the execution of the treaty would depend upon the question of who was the possessor at the moment when war was declared. But there are certain islands in 
the Bay of Fundy the title to which is claimed by both parties, 
and other portions of territory from that bay to the Lake of the 
Woods, the whole line between which is more or less liable to dispute, and which may by each party be supposed to belong to him. 
For the settlement of the respective pretensions of the two parties 
to those islands, and for other purposes, a mode of decision, suggested by Great Britain, has been assented to by the undersigned. 
</p><p>
They can not consent to the proposed alteration, first, because 
by constituting each party the sole judge of what belongs to him, 
it makes the restitution to depend upon his uncertain exercise of 
judgment, and not on the precise principle of status before the 
war, on which alone in this respect they have repeatedly stated 
they can treat, and which has been agreed to by Great Britain ; 
and secondly because it is repugnant to the principle on which 
it has been agreed to waive, at this time, the determination of the 
claims of the parties to the disputed islands, and to submit it to 
an impartial tribunal erected for the purpose. These objections 
apply equally to the alteration as proposed in general terms, and 
to the qualification by which it would be limited in its operation to the territories in dispute, or to the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay. It may be added that it is further objectionable as sowing, in the very instrument of pacification, the seeds of an immediate misunderstanding, the moment it is carried into practical execution. 
</p><p>
On the other remaining subject of difference, the undersigned 
must observe that the demand of Great Britain of the navigation 
of the Mississippi, brought forward in the form of a modification 
of the eighth article of the project of the undersigned, was wholly unexpected by them, after the explicit declaration made by 
the British Plenipotentiaries that their Government had no demands to make other than was contained in their notes of the 
, etc., of which this was not one. As to that modification, the undersigned have offered three alternatives, first to strike out 
the article altogether, or to strike out the clause which grants the 
navigation of the Mississippi, or lastly, retaining that clause, to 
place the exercise of the right under restrictions to prevent its 
abuse or perversion, in consideration of the recognition by Great 
Britain of that liberty in the fisheries which she considers abrogated by the war. To either of these alternatives the undersigned are yet willing to assent. And it was with some surprise that they have been made acquainted, by the British Plenipotentiaries, that their Government declines to accept either of 
them, and offers as a substitute for the second, a clause referring 
to a future negotiation the adjustment of the proper equivalent 
to be given by the United States for the enjoyment of the liberty 
to the fisheries referred to ; and of the proper equivalent to be 
given by Great Britain for the navigation of the Mississippi. 
</p><p>
The undersigned can not consent to this substitute because 
it is either useless in itself, in providing for a future negotiation 
which the two governments, without any such provision, will at 
all times, if it be necessary, have it in their power to take up ; or 
because it supposes, what the undersigned have declared their 
Government does not admit, that the liberty in the fisheries alluded to has been lost by the war. 
</p><p>
To a general stipulation, similar to the article of the treaty of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1794">1794</a>, the undersigned will not object. 
</p><p>
All other points having been substantially arranged either by 
the correspondence, or in the conferences between the Plenipotentiaries of the two countries, it remains only to dispose of 
the two existing topics of difference to conclude, so far as depends on the undersigned, a treaty of peace. For this happy 
result it is quite unnecessary to dwell on the testimony which, in 
every stage of the negotiation, they have constantly given of their anxious desire.
