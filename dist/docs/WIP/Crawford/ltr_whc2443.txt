My dear Sir, - I acknowledge with much pleasure your very 
interesting letter of the 2d instant, by the hands of Mr. Connell. 
</p><p>
It appears that we differ in opinion upon two points. You 
believe that the British Government will not hesitate to make 
peace, leaving the question of impressment wholly out of view. 
You appear also to believe that the events of the present campaign will have a favorable effect upon your negotiation. I 
sincerely wish you may be right, but I am strongly inclined to 
believe that the result will prove your opinions to be incorrect. 
</p><p>
When I foresaw that peace would probably take place in Europe, in the early part of the year, I did not expect that the manner in which the war has terminated would so inflate the 
arrogance of the enemy as it manifestly has done. I thought, 
as you now think, that England would not hesitate to make 
peace hy waiving the question of impressment. I am even now 
convinced that her interest requires that this course should be 
adopted. There are, however, occasions in which nations, like 
individuals, blinded by some momentary but predominant passion, turn a deaf ear to the voice of interest. This I presume to 
be the case with our enemy at the present moment. Various 
facts which have come to my knowledge have led me to believe 
that she will now decidedly reject any proposition which you 
can make, which does not admit the legality of her practice of 
impressment on board American vessels at sea. 
</p><p>
At the moment, however, when I presented to the joint embassy the idea of making peace, by omitting this question, even 
if your instructions did not literally warrant it, I still believed 
that England would consent to this course. At that time I expected the negotiation to open at Gottenburg, about the 1st of 
May. I did not expect that instructions could be received from 
the Government, founded on the recent changes in Europe, before the month of August. At the date of my letter to you of 
the 10th ultimo, my opinion of the views of the British Government had in some degree changed, but even then, I expected the 
negotiation to open a month sooner than it probably will. I also 
expected that the change of the seat of negotiations would probably postpone the receipt of the instructions expected from the 
United States. These reasons, together with those which arise 
from the expectation of a different result from our military 
operations from that which you entertain, aided by the express 
wish of Mr. Bayard that I should present the question anew to 
you individually, must plead my apology for its intrusion upon 
your attention. 
</p><p>
If there was any rational ground to expect that by a longer 
prosecution of the war we should ultimately succeed in compelling the enemy to relinquish, by treaty, the practice of impressment, I would not hesitate to continue the war. I believe there 
is no such reasonable ground of expectation, unless we are disposed to bequeath this war as a legacy to our sons. 
</p><p>
The Russian officers now in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> who have been in England, are highly disgusted with that nation. They speak of a war 
with Austria as certain. In this I think they are mistaken. If 
war breaks out on the continent, I presume England, in her 
present temper, must have a finger in it. In this question, however, as she has no resentments to gratify, she will be governed 
by her interest. She will, therefore, be against that power 
which is most commercial, and the destruction of whose commerce will tend most directly to her interest. 
</p><p>
I must really apologize to you for the length of my letters. 
Present me most respectfully to your colleagues, and accept 
yourself the assurance of my most sincere friendship. 
</p><p>
P. S. Mr. Carroll leaves <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> sooner than I expected. I will 
send your passport by Mr. Todd. 
</p><p>
Remember me to the young gentlemen of the mission.
