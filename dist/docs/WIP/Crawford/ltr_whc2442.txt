My DEAR Sir, - I have but little to add to the contents of my preceding letters. Mr. Gallatin, and the young gentlemen who 
accompany, or follow immediately after him, will give you the ephemeral news of this capital. There is but little doing here which can interest an American citizen. 
</p><p>
I am not sanguine in my expectations of peace. If the failure 
of your exertions, to put an end to the war, shall succeed in producing unanimity at home, we shall have no cause to lament 
that failure. I am thoroughly convinced that the United States 
can never be called upon to treat, under circumstances less auspicious than those which exist at the present moment, unless our 
internal bickerings shall continue to weaken the efforts of the 
Government. I sincerely trust that this will not be the case. In 
your letter to Messrs. Gallatin and Bayard, you state that the 
elections in the East had terminated against the Government, 
but by smaller majorities than on the preceding elections. I 
have not yet received any other information upon the subject, 
than what is contained in that letter. There is a chasm in my 
newspapers, delivered by Mr. Carroll, from the 19th of March to 
the 5th of April. If you can supply this chasm, you will 
greatly oblige me. 
</p><p>
From what I have lately discovered of the councils of this 
nation, and of the temper of the principal maritime states of 
Europe, I am inclined to believe that the time at which they 
may be disposed to oppose the maritime usurpations of our 
enemy, will be more distant than I had previously imagined. 
At all events, I am fearful that it will be more distant than we 
shall be disposed to prosecute the war, to avoid concessions 
which they will feel as severely as we shall. 
</p><p>
In the prosecution of the war, the great difficulty we shall have to encounter, will be the raising of money. The war will 
give us soldiers, and point out the officers qualified to command, but it will neither coin money, or increase our credit. If we 
can get through this campaign without any signal defeat, and without the loss of any of our principal commercial cities, and 
can raise for the ensuing year the sums necessary for the prosecution of the war, we shall find ourselves in much more eligible circumstances at the close of the next campaign, than we are at present. 
</p><p>
I do not look forward with dismay ; I believe we shall rise 
superior to all the difficulties with which we are surrounded. I 
trust we shall live to enjoy many happy celebrations of this anniversary of our national existence. 
</p><p>
Give my best respects to your colleagues, and accept for yourself the assm-ance of my warmest friendship. 
</p><p>
P. S. I will send by Mr. Todd, the passport necessary to 
enable you to come to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, after you close your diplomatic 
functions. I repeal my request that you will make my house 
your home, during your residence here. If you wish to take a 
disciple of Pestalozzi with you to the United States, one can be 
obtained. Upon him you can impose the condition of teaching 
the Greek and Latin. You will have, however, to maintain him, 
until he learns English enough to teach. The economy of Switzerland makes this expense very inconsiderable. I have learned 
with great pleasure, from the enemies of the system, that it has 
overcome the prejudices even of the priesthood.
