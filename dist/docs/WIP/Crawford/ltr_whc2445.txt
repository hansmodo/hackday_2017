My dear Sir, - Inclosed is a letter for Mr. Poinsett, our 
minister in Mexico, which I will thank you to forward to Mr. Poinsett, with as little delay as is consistent with your convenience. The object of the letter is to obtain from him some of 
the productions of Mexico, which will probably succeed in the Southern and Western States. Perhaps an intimation from the 
Secretary of State on this subject may be productive of good effects.

I hope you know me too well to suppose that I have countenanced the charge of corruption which has been reiterated 
against you. The truth is, I approved of your vote for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="met colleague">Mr. Adams</a>, when it was given ; and should have voted as you did, 
between <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met colleague">Jackson</a> and Adams. But candor compels me to say, that I disapproved of your accepting an office from him. You ought, I think, to have foreseen that his administration could 
hardly fail to be popular. Those who knew his temper, disposition, and political opinions, entertained no doubt upon the 
subject. By accepting the office of Secretary of State from him, you have indisputably connected your fortunes with his. 
And it appears to me that he is destined to fall as his father did, 
and you must fall with him. This State could not have been driven under the banners of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met colleague">Jackson</a> by any other course of 
measures than that pursued by the Administration toward it. Jr. Adams' general measures, although very exceptionable, would not have ranged the State under <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met colleague">Jackson's</a> standard. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="met colleague">Mr. Adams</a> has professed to consider the Federal Government limited by the enumerated powers. Yet he has recommended to Congress to erect light-houses to the skies - a recommendation 
utterly inconsistent with the idea of the Government being limited by the enumerated powers. This recommendation, it 
appears to me, can be supported by no other construction than that Congress can do any thing which is not expressly forbidden 
by the Constitution. The whole of his first message to Congress is replete with doctrines which I hold to be unconstitutional.

Present my respects to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="met aquaintance">Mrs. Clay</a>, and accept the same yourself.
