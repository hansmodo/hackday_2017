My dear Sir, - We have heard with great pleasure of your 
safe arrival at your own home, after your interesting trip down 
the great river ; and we all enjoyed, as sincerely as you could 
have done, the tokens of regard and affection which the good 
people manifested toward you at the various points of your tour. 
More than all, it was gratifying to hear from Mr. Poinsett such 
excellent accounts of your health.

The President means to be re-elected. He has meant so all 
along. Seeing this. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague">Van Buren</a> has been endeavoring to make 
a merit of persuading him to do so, on the ground of its being 
necessary to keep the party together. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague antagonist">Calhoun</a> is more than 
half reconciled to it from two considerations : first, he hardly feels 
as confident as he has done, of his own present strength ; second, 
he regards the chance of succession, in seven years, as pretty 
important. If any thing should prevent <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> from 
being a candidate for re-election, my hopes would now be exceeding strong of beating both <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=mvb" rel="colleague">Van Buren</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jcc" rel="colleague antagonist">Calhoun</a>. How it will be expedient for us to act, in case the present incumbent 
should actually be candidate again, we can better determine 
hereafter. My own firm belief is, that if we were to let the 
Administration, this session and the next, have their own way, 
and follow out their own principles, they would be so unpopular 
as that the General could not possibly be re-elected. I do not 
mean by this, that we should let them disturb the Tariff, or 
injure any other existing interest ; still less that we should, in 
the slightest degree, vote or act against our own principles. All 
these being safe, and all existing interests preserved, I still think 
if we leave to them to decide on new measures of internal improvement, etc., according to their own will, they will soon find what the sense of the people is. Bat I forbear further talk.
