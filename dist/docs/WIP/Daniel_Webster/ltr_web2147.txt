My dear Sir, - You will have seen some proofs of the prevailing sentiments, on public subjects, in this quarter. The best possible feeling was indicated at the meeting on the 5th. I do 
not mean in regard to myself, but on general subjects, and in 
respect to others. The toast in which you were named was received with the most enthusiastic applause. I do not think I have ever seen, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, a meeting comprising so much character, talent, influence, and respectability. I hope it may do good. 
</p><p>
One objection, my dear sir, which I have to writing to you, 
is, that your courtesy and kindness lead you always to answer 
me, and I feel that it is wrong, in the present state of your health 
and of your engagements, to impose any new duty, though it be 
a trifling one, upon you. I will really take it as a greater proof 
of friendship and confidence, if, how often soever I may write, 
you will forbear all reply, unless when there is something which 
you wish to say.
