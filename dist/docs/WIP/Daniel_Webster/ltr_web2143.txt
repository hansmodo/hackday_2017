My dear Sir, - The subject of the recent British order is exciting some little attention, as you will have observed, in the commercial cities, and there are those, doubtless, v/ho would embrace this, as they would any opportunity, to find fault.

Mr. Lloyd has probably written you in regard to it. He feels 
more than a common share of interest on the occasion, as he 
recommended negotiation in preference to meeting the English 
proposition by an act of Congress. It may be well, perhaps, that 
some little statement, made at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, would appear, for 
the satisfaction of the public. I would not intimate that there 
is in this part of the country at least, any dissatisfaction ; but I 
see attempts are making, in New York and other places, to produce an impression that the national interests have, in this instance, been overlooked.

As to the general course of political affairs, we have nothing 
of much interest in this quarter. Our elections take place next month. In some districts there may be personal changes, but 
nobody will be proposed on the ground of opposition, nor any 
body chosen who is suspected, on good grounds, of being inclined 
to join the opposition. Some few, perhaps, may be chosen, who 
profess friendship, and who will yet fly off on the first, and on 
every close question, according to the example of last winter. 
But, on the whole, the great majority from this quarter will be 
well inclined, and steady in their course. The Jackson paper in 
this city (for we have also a Jackson paper), seems to occupy itself at present very much with Mr. Everett. Mr. Everett, however, is likely to be re-elected with great unanimity. I think, 
my dear sir, without intending a compliment, that your speech 
at Lewisburg has done real service. It was happy and excellent, 
even for you, both in matter and manner. We all rejoice here 
- I mean all who do not fear that you were born to prevent 
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General J.</a> from being President - in the improvement of your 
health ; and you must allow me to express my most anxious and 
earnest hope that you will not overwork yourself the ensuing 
session and winter. What can not be done without the sacrifice 
of your health must be left undone, at whatever expense or 
hazard. I have often thought of suggesting to you one practice, 
if you have not already adopted it, which I have found very useful myself, when my own little affairs have occasionally pressed me ; that is, the constant employment of an amanuensis. The 
difference between writing at the table and dictating to another, 
is very great. The first is tedious, exhausting, debilitating labor ; 
the last may be done while you are pacing a large room, and enjoying in that way the benefit of an erect posture, and a healthy exercise. If I were you I would not touch a pen, except to write 
my frank. Make the clerks do all that clerks can do, and for 
the rest dictate to an amanuensis. I venture to say, that if you 
once get accustomed to this, you will find your labor greatly 
lightened.

I have had the pleasure of hearing from several Kentucky and 
Ohio friends during the summer ; and have had much gratification in learning the favorable state of opinion in those important states. The only incident to be regretted much, in the West, is 
the loss of Cook's election. His friends must remember him, 
and sustain him, in some public service, according to his merits.
