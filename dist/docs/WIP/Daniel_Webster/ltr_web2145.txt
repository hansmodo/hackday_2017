My dear Sir, - Your reply to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a>'s letter is admirable, and has been most favorably received every where, at least on this side the Allegheny. It places the General in a position where he can not remain. He must move, in some direction ; and, whatever movement he makes, will either embarrass 
his friends, or still more embarrass himself. I have a suspicion 
that the respectable member of Congress is Mr. Buchanan. If 
this should turn out so, it will place him in an awkward situation, since, it seems, he did recommend a bargain with your 
friends, on the suspicion that such a bargain had been proposed 
to them on the part of the friends of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jqa" rel="colleague met">Mr. Adams</a>. I am curious 
to see how this matter will develop itself.
