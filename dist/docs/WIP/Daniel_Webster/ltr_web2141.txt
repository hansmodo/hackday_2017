Dear Sir, - Under another cover I send you what has occurred to me on the subject of our trade with England. The 
object of this is, to express my sympathy for your domestic calamity, and to offer my congratulations on the welcome so ardent 
and so universal, which seems to have greeted you among your 
fellow-citizens of the West. The same kindness of feeling 
which has been expressed in that quarter, exists, I believe, in 
other places. I have been through New York in the course of 
the summer, and I found almost every where, a hearty approbation, and every where else, at least, an entire and not uneasy 
acquiescence, in regard to the events of last winter, and to your 
own agency in producing those events. In New England, with 
here and there a little expression of spleen from the disappointed, 
the great majority of the people have the best disposition toward 
the Government, in all its parts. Our ability in Congress is not 
so great as it might have been, and as it ought to have been. 
But that evil admits of no immediate cure. 
</p><p>
You must allow me to admonish you to take care of your 
health. Knowing the ardor and the intensity with which you 
may probably apply yourself to the duties of your place, I fear 
very much you may overwork yourself. Somebody (was it not 
an Austrian minister?) on being asked how he could get through 
so much business, replied that he did it by repudiating two false 
maxims, which had obtained currency among men ; that, for 
his part, he never did any thing to-day, which he could put off 
till to-morrow ; nor any thing himself, which he could get 
another to do for him. Without following his example, strictly 
and literally, I still think you ought to be a good deal governed 
by the same rules, especially the last.
