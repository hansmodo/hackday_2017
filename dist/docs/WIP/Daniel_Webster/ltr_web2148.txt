My dear Sir, - I am in hopes this will find you in Kentucky, 
in good spirits and renewed health. If you are as well as we 
wish you, this way, you need be no better. A strong manifestation of kindly feeling toward you, personally, has very generally appeared in all the numerous celebrations of the 4th instant, 
in this quarter of the country, which have fallen under my observation. As far as I can judge, the general aspect of things is favorable.
