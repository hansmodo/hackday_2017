My dear Sir, - We are glad to learn, through the papers, that 
you have been able to leave the city for a little visit into Marylaud, as it gives us reason to hope that you have recovered from 
your recent indisposition. 
</p><p>
You will have noticed Mr. Lloyd's resignation. I did not expect it at this moment, although I was apprised of his wish to 
leave the Senate as soon as he could. It was with difficulty he 
was persuaded to attend the last session. The Legislature being 
now in session, his place will be immediately filled. I incline 
to think that the appointment will fall on Mr. Silsby, It has 
been intimated to me, indeed, that a different arrangement might, perhaps, be made, if I should approve it ; but my impression at present is against it, and I believe for very good reasons. 
</p><p>
Mr. Silsby you know. He is entirely well disposed, and is a 
well-informed merchant and a respectable man. It is not likely 
he would take much part in the discussions of the Senate ; but 
would bring a good deal of useful knowledge into the body, and 
might be entirely relied on to support all just and proper measures. According to general usage here, a senator would now be 
appointed for six years, commencing next March, at the end of 
Mr. Mills' present term of office ; but I think it probable enough, 
that having to fill the vacancy, occasioned by the resignation of 
Mr. Lloyd, now, the Legislature may choose to postpone the 
other election to the winter. If the choice should come on now, 
I understand Mr. Mills will be re-elected. If postponed, it may 
be a little uncertain, it is said, as some suppose our Governor has 
an inclination for the place. There are here, in the Legislature 
and out, a few very busy persons, who are hostile to the administration. They have no system, but act, in every case, pro rata, and content themselves with the general principle, applied 
in all cases, and indiscriminately, of opposing. They will probably support Mr. Lincoln against Mr. Mills, from an idea that Mr. Mills' appointment would gratify the friends of the President, or 
is a thing arranged by his friends, although Mr. Lincoln is known 
to be equally friendly. Some embarrassment may happen from 
this source, very possibly ; but I trust it can be overcome. 
</p><p>
I have great pleasure in assuring you that nothing can be 
more correct or more decisive than public opinion in this part 
of the country, in regard to the various transactions of the last 
session. 
</p><p>
The sentiment of the people is exactly what you would expect and wish it to be. 
</p><p>
In New Hampshire the Legislature meets next week. The 
two senators will doubtless be present on that occasion, and we 
are looking with some interest to see whether Mr. Woodbury 
and the editor of the " Patriot" (publisher of the laws !) will be 
able to bring the Legislature and people of that State to their 
way of thinking.
