My DEAR Sir, - My letter to Colonel Johnson was not important, and the delay in its transmission is of no moment. 
</p><p>
You speak very modestly of recent events, in which you 
have borne so distinguished and so successful a part. I can 
not think <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> will ever recover from the blow 
which he has received. Your speech at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, in point of 
merit, as a clear and well stated argument, is certainly at the 
head of all your efforts ; and its effects on public opinion have 
not been exceeded by those of any political paper, I may almost 
say, within my recollection. Buchanan is treated too gently. 
Many persons think his letter candid. I deem otherwise. It 
seems to me he has labored very hard to protect the General, as 
far as he could without injury to himself. Although the General's friends this way, however, affect to consider Buchanan's letter as supporting the charge, it is possible the Genera] himself, and the Nashville Committee may think otherwise, and complain of Buchanan. I should expect this, with some confidence, if they received the letter a little earlier than they may have seen the turn which the Atlantic editors have attempted to 
give it. As these last have pretty generally agreed to say that 
the letter does support the General, the Nashville commentators, 
if they see the example in season, may be disposed to follow it. 
I do not yet learn what answer comes from that quarter to your 
speech.
