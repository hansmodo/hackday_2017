My DEAR Sir, - I am obliged to you for a copy of your address 
to your constituents. It has been widely circulated here, is 
universally read, and highly commended. I have heard but one 
opinion as to its general merits. Some think that part which 
relates to Mr. Kremer's letter, and the incidents connected with 
it, was an unnecessary labor, at least so far as regards the state 
of public opinion this way. That transaction seems to have 
made no impression here. The part of your address which sets 
forth your reasons for preferring another candidate to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> is composed, in my opinion, with great skill and ability, 
and I have no doubt it will produce a very strong effect. It is 
a very good case, very ably managed. 
</p><p>
We are very quiet in this quarter. There is very little dissatisfaction, and no disposition, that I discover, to opposition. 
</p><p>
With almost all there prevails a very good spirit ; and the exceptions are not important, from weight of character or influence. 
</p><p>
I have heard nothing, since I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, respecting the 
English mission. If any thing has occurred, not improper for 
me to know, I should be glad to learn it from you at your leisure ; and I shall be gratified also to hear from you on other subjects and occasions.
