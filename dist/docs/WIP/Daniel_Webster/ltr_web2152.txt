My dear Sir, - I have at length reached this point, after having been greatly delayed by the state of the roads, produced by excessive rains. Such are the accounts here of the state of 
health, in the towns and near the rivers, and to the southward 
of it, that my future movements, and the extent to which I may 
prosecute my journey, have become uncertain. The season, too, 
seems now rapidly advancing into hot weather. I have thought 
it due to your kindness and proffered hospitality to make this 
suggestion, lest you should stay at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, in expectation of 
my being there, after the time when it would be agreeable to 
you, under existing circumstances, to leave home. I pray you 
not to stay a day for me, since it is so uncertain whether I shall 
get to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>.

I have heard only to-day the dreadful account about poor Johnston. It is inexpressibly shocking.
