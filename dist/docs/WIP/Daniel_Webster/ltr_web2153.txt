My DEAR Sir, - Your kind letter of the 17th was put into my 
hands at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, on the morning of the 20th, just as I was 
getting into the carriage on my departure for this place. With 
whatever reluctance, and it was certainly very great, I found it 
unavoidable that I should give up the Kentucky portion of my 
journey ; since, even though I felt no fear about personal safety, 
I should yet find those whom I wished to see either in alarm or 
in affliction. Now that the scourge has departed, as I hope, 
from your immediate neighborhood, and although Providence 
has kindly protected your own roof, yet I can well conceive that 
you must have lost valued friends, and that so terrible a visitation 
has left a shock which must continue to be felt for some time. 
</p><p>
It is my purpose to proceed immediately to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, and 
thence by the shortest route to New York and New England. 
I find Mr. Ewing here, as well as General M. Arthur and 
other friends. He expresses great pleasure at the escape of your 
family from the calamity. There is no sickness here, though a 
case of cholera is reported as having occurred at Portsmouth. 
</p><p> 
I sincerely hope you will not give up your intended visit to 
the North. All along the country there is a very general expectation of seeing you, and the disappointment will not be small, should you not come. 
</p><p>
I beg you to make my best regards to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="aquaintance met">Mrs. Clay</a>, and say to 
her, that I will venture to give her my word that if she will 
visit the North, she will find her tour pleasant and agreeable, and 
her welcome every where hearty. 
</p><p>
