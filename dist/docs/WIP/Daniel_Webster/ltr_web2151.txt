<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=boston" rel="city">Boston</a>, October 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1831">1831</a>. 
</p><p>
My dear Sir, - Mr. Everett was kind enough to show me 
your letter to him, stating the results of the Kentucky election. 
</p><p>
It is doubtless true that some regret was felt in this quarter, 
that those results were not more strongly in our favor, but, upon 
the whole, a general satisfaction as to that matter now prevails, and 
all think that Kentucky has at least, by a certain, if not by a 
great majority, declared against the present Administration. For 
my own part, I can say, with great truth and sincerity, that I 
know no political men more deserving the thanks of the country, than our friends in Kentucky. I have some conception of the obstacles with which they have had to contend, not for once, 
but for many times, and their spirit, zeal, and perseverance in 
maintaining the cause of good government, place them, in my 
judgment, in the first class of really patriotic citizens. This opinion 
I often express, and it gives me always pleasure to express it. 
Whatever events may come upon us, I feel, for one, a debt of gratitude to the good men of Kentucky, for the firmness with 
which they have breasted a storm, which has threatened, and I 
think still threatens, to overturn, not only the interests and institutions, but the Constitution of the country. 
</p><p>
You must be aware, my dear sir, of the strong desire manifested in many parts of the country, that you should come into the Senate. There is, certainly, a strong feeling of that sort, 
all along the Atlantic coast. I learn its existence from private 
letters, as well as from the public newspapers. The wish is entertained here, as earnestly as any where. For myself, I hardly 
know what my own wishes are, because I suppose <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crittenden</a> will, of course, be thought of again. He has so much 
talent and fitness for the place, is, according to my apprehension 
of his character, so true and trustworthy, has done so much for 
the general good, and been so marked an object besides, for the 
opposition and reproach of the present dominant party at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, that I find myself incapable of desiring any thing incompatible with his wishes or expectations. But I know not 
what his wishes are. Independent of considerations of this 
kind, the force of which you can weigh infinitely better than I 
can, I should entirely concur with others in deeming it most expedient for you to come now into the Senate. We are to have an interesting and an arduous session. Every thing is to be 
attacked. An array is preparing much more formidable than 
has ever yet assaulted, what we think, the leading and important 
public interests. Not only the Tariff, but the Constitution itself, in its elementary and fundamental provisions, will be assailed with talent, vigor, and union. Every thing is to be 
debated, as if nothing had ever been settled. You perceive 
imposing proceedings, under high names, going on in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, You see measures adopted to try the Constitution, further South. You see, every where, I think, omens of a contest of no 
ordinary character. At the same time, discouraging things are 
happening, such as the Baltimore nomination and its acceptance. 
I assure you, my dear sir, with the prospect of toil and labor 
which is before me, if honor and conscience were not in the 
way, I would give my place to another. But these dictate to me, 
or seem to, that, so far as depends on so humble an individual 
as myself, the crisis must be met. But it would be an infinite 
gratification to have your aid, or rather your lead. I speak in 
unaffected sincerity and truth, when I say that I should rejoice, 
personally, to meet you in the Senate. I am equally sincere in 
saying that the cause would, under present circumstances be 
materially benefited by your presence there. I know nothing so 
likely to be useful. Every thing valuable in the Government 
is to be fought for, and we need your arm in the fight. At the 
same time, my dear sir, I would not, even thus privately and 
confidentially to you, say any thing not consistent with delicacy and friendship for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jjc" rel="colleague met">Mr. Crittenden</a>, for whose character I have great regard, and toward whom you and ct' ^^"s have 
taught me to entertain the feelings of a friend. Would to God 
we could have you both, at this crisis in the public councils. 
</p><p>
I ought to thank you for your kindness to several friends of 
mine, who have visited you in the course of the season. They 
express themselves highly gratified by your hospitality and good 
offices. 
</p><p>
I pray a most respectful remembrance to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="aquaintance met">Mrs. Clay</a>, and hope 
that at some time, on one or the other side of the mountains, 
Mrs. Webster may have the pleasure of making her acquaintance. Clark, Letcher, and Kincaird, I believe, are not at great 
distances from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>. If you see them, tender my regards 
to them. I hope you will let me hear from you.
