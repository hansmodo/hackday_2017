them soon after his decease, by Prof. E. D. Sanborn, who has kindly furnished 
them to the Editor for publication. ]


REV. E. SMITH TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Pomfret, Vt., November 10, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, Yours of the 10th instant was received last evening, and I hasten to reply. More than fifty years have elapsed 
since the events you allude to transpired; many facts, therefore, 
which would be interesting, are lost. 

With respect to Daniel "Webster's college life, his habits of 
study were good. He was a strict observer of order. His mind 
was too dignified to do otherwise. He never engaged in college 
disturbances. I should as soon have suspected John Wheelock, 
the President, of improper conduct as Daniel Webster. He 
looked with contempt on all lawless projects. I never knew 
him to waste the study hours. He was constant at the recitation, and always well prepared. He was peculiarly industrious. 
In addition to college studies, he read more than any one in his 
class. He read with great rapidity, and seemed to remember 
all. He would accomplish more labor, in a given time, than any 
one of his classmates. As a general scholar, Webster was good. 
He was not deficient in a single study. In composition and 
speaking, there was not his equal in the class. The truth is, 
that, by his thorough investigation of every subject and every 
study, while in college, by the aid of his giant mind, he rose to 
the very pinnacle of fame ; and all he had to do was to sustain 
himself where he was, and fame would roll in upon him ; and all 
his classmates have been compelled to look up high to see him, 
which I have ever been proud to do. As a debater in our 
society, he manifested the same talent and the same powers of 
intellect, in a degree, which he afterwards exhibited in public 
life. He was in the habit of writing his own declamations for 
the stage, though not required to do so, by the laws of the college. 
He was accustomed to arrange his thoughts in his mind in his 
room or private walks, and put them upon paper just before 
the exercise was called for. When he was required to speak, at 
two o'clock, he would frequently begin to write after dinner; 
and when the bell rung, he would fold his paper, put it into his 
pocket, and go in and speak with great ease. At one time, 
when thus writing, his windows being open, a sudden flaw of 
wind took away his paper, and it was last seen flying over the 
meeting-house ; but he went in and spoke its contents with 
remarkable fluency. In his Sophomore year, I heard him speak 
a piece of poetry, before his class, which displayed great ingenuity. Every line ended in i-o-n. It was said to be his own 
composition. In his movements, he was rather slow and deliberate, except when his feelings were roused; then, his whole 
soul would kindle into a flame. I recollect that he used to commence speaking rather monotonously and without much excitement, but would always rise, with the importance of the subject, 
till every eye was fixed upon him. In social life, he was always 
pleasant and agreeable. His company was sought by all 
classes. He always attended public worship, on the Sabbath, 
and evidently felt that it was his duty to do so. Many idle 
stories have been circulated respecting Webster's tearing up 
his diploma. Of this I have no knowledge. I have no doubt 
that the report is false. I stood by his side, when he received 
his degree, with a graceful bow ; and such was my connection 
with him, in our society affairs, that if he had destroyed it afterwards, I certainly should have known it. I think that he 
delivered two eulogies on deceased classmates ; one in his Freshman, and one in his Senior year. The latter was published. 
As these appointments were made by his class, they show in 
what estimation he was held by them. His election by the 
faculty and citizens of Hanover, to deliver an oration on the 
Fourth of July, 1800, also indicates their opinion of his scholarship and attainments. I will only add that, in all his intercourse 
with students and townsmen, no one, then, presumed to bring a 
railing accusation against him. 

Yours truly, 

ELIHU SMITH. 


HON. HENRY HUBBARD TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Charlestown, November 15, 1852. 

MY DEAR SIR, I regret that my absence from home has prevented an earlier answer to your letter of the 10th instant. With 
the greatest pleasure I shall comply with your request, as far as 
I am able to recall the facts connected with Mr. Webster's college history. I entered the Freshman class in 1799, at the early 
age of fourteen. I was two years in college with Mr. Webster. 
When I first went to Hanover, I found his reputation already 
established as the most remarkable young man in the college. 
He was, I believe, so decidedly beyond any one else, that no 
other student of his class was ever spoken of as second to him. 
I was led very soon to appreciate, most highly, his scholarship 
and attainments. As a student, his acquisitions seemed to me 
to be very extensive. Every subject appeared to contribute 
something to his intellectual stores. He acquired knowledge 
with remarkable facility. He seemed to grasp the meaning and 
substance of a book almost by intuition. Others toiled long 
and patiently for that which he acquired at a glance. As a 
scholar, I should say that he was then distinguished for the 
uncommon extent of his knowledge, and for the ease with which 
he acquired it. But I should say that I was more impressed by 
his eloquence and power as a speaker, before the society of 
which we were both members, than by his other qualifications, 
however superior to others. There was a completeness and 
fulness in his views, and a force and expressiveness in his manner of presenting them, which no other student possessed. We 
used to listen to him with the deepest interest and respect, and 
no one thought of equalling the vigor and glow of his eloquence.. 
The oration which he delivered before the United Fraternity, on 
the day of his graduation is, I think, now on file among the 
records of that society. Whoever will read it, at this late day, 
and bring to mind the appearance of the author, his manner and 
power, during its delivery, cannot fail to admit that I have said 
no more of his eloquence than I was warranted in saying. The 
students, and those who knew him best and judged him most 
impartially, felt that no one connected with the college deserved 
to be compared with him at the time he received his first degree. 
His habits and moral character were entirely unimpeachable. I 
never heard them questioned during our college acquaintance. 
I have written the honest convictions of my mind, the best feelings of my heart, respecting a man, now no more, who was 
distinguished as a scholar, in college, and equally distinguished, 
in his whole subsequent life, in every sphere and station which 
he was called to fill. 

I am, Sir, very truly your friend, 

HENRY HUBBARD. 



MR. HILL TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Hanover, N. H., November 25, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, I was a pupil of Daniel Webster while he taught 
the Academy at Fryeburg, in the winter and summer of 1802. 
During that short season, he gained the universal respect of 
both scholars and villagers; and the regret with which we 
parted with him is among my most vivid recollections of that 
period. The remarkable equanimity of temper which he ever 
manifested in school was a matter of common observation. 
Under all the vexations incident to such a school, not a frown 
was ever seen upon his brow. It was his invariable practice to 
open and close the school with extemporaneous prayer ; and 
I shall never forget the solemnity of manner with which that 
duty was always performed. He delivered an oration on the 
Fourth of July of that year, and the only sentence which has 
not escaped my memory, related to the Constitution. It was 
this : " If the Constitution be picked to pieces, piecemeal, it is 
gone, as surely and as fatally gone, as though it had been 
struck down by one resistless blow." 

Yours truly, 

THOMAS P. HILL. 



j. w. M'GAW, ESQ., TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Bangor, November 16, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 12th instant is before me, and 
1 take great pleasure in giving you such reminiscences of my 

much honored friend, the late Hon. Daniel Webster, as occur 
to me. 

It was not my good fortune to make the acquaintance of Mr. 
Webster, until he became a member of Dartmouth College; 
and then, I knew him only in his vacations. The office of Hon. 
Thomas W. Thompson, with whom I read law, was about 
twenty rods from Judge Webster's dwelling-house. Daniel 
called occasionally at the office, to spend a leisure hour with 
the late Parker Noyes and myself, who were fellow-students for 
nearly three years. On one of those occasions, Mr. Webster 
asked me if I saw and read the Dartmouth Gazette ; arid if so, 
what I thought of Icarus, whose productions sometimes appeared in that paper. My criticisms were more severe than 
just. Two or three years afterwards he informed me that he 
was the veritable Icarus. His victory over me was then complete. 

Mr. Webster commenced the study of law in Mr. Thompson's 
office soon after I was admitted to the practice of my profession. My residence was at Fryeburg from January, 1801, to 
October, 1805. Mr. Webster came to that place in 1802, I 
think, to take charge of the academy. During his residence 
there, we boarded and roomed together. Nearly all our leisure 
hours were spent together. We read, conversed, walked, and 
had all our social amusements in company. Here was laid the 
foundation of that friendship, which, by his generous indulgence, 
has remained constant and uninterrupted till the time of his 
death, notwithstanding the very great changes which occurred 
in our relative positions, by reason of his constant elevation, 
from one grade of honor to another, till he attained a standing 
from which human greatness knows no progress. I will now 
attempt to relate some facts concerning Mr. Webster's early 
history, as he communicated them to me. The incident related 
by Mr. Everett, in his Memoir of Mr. Webster, respecting his 
elevation to a higher class, at the end of the first month at the 
Academy in Exeter, needs, I think, a little correction or explanation in order to present its most important bearing upon his 
future life. When his first term at Exeter was near its close, 
the usher said : " Webster, you may stop a few minutes after 
school ; I wish to speak to you." When the other scholars had 
gone, the usher asked him whether he intended to return to the 
VOL. i. 5 
academy after the vacation. The answer indicated something 
like reluctance. It had not escaped the observation of the , 
teacher, that Webster's rustic manners and unfashionable raiment had drawn upon him the ridicule of some of his associates, 
who in every respect, except habiliments and external accomplishments, were greatly his inferiors. The inference was justly 
drawn that the academy was in danger of losing an estimable 
and promising pupil, while it retained others who gave no promise of doing honor to that distinguished seminary. The usher, 
therefore, judiciously and kindly remarked to Mr. Webster, that 
he was a much better scholar than any in his class ; that he 
learned more readily and easily than they did ; and if he would 
return at the commencement of the next term he should be 
put into a higher class, and should no longer be hindered in his 
progress by those boys who cared more for play and dress than 
for solid improvement. " These were the first truly encouraging 
words," said Mr. Webster, " that I ever received, with regard to 
my studies. I then resolved to return and pursue them with 
diligence and with so much ability as I possessed." Probably 
the kindness and good judgment of the usher had an important 
influence upon the whole course of Mr. Webster's after life. 

When Mr. Webster resided at Fryeburg, he had not attained 
to the full development of manhood. Neither the physical nor 
intellectual expression of his countenance had become so striking as in subsequent life. His cheeks were thin and his cheek 
bones prominent. There was nothing specially noticeable about 
him then, except his full, steady, large, and searching eyes. 
Nobody could see those eyes and ever forget their appearance or 
him who possessed them. His gentleness, modesty, and social 
habits won for him the good-will of his acquaintances and 
pupils. The reading of Mr. Webster, at Fryeburg, was chiefly 
English literature ; such as Pope's Works, all of which he read 
at that time. He was much amused with the Dunciad. The 
Spectator, Tatler, &c., were among the books procured from a 
small village library. These were read aloud, alternately, by 
himself and room-mate. He read Blackstone's Commentaries 
when no company was present. 

I never heard him speak of any embarrassments in his attempts at declamation, and think it could only have existed, 
while he was annoyed by idle and envious boys, at Exeter 

Academy. At this period of his life, (1802,) Mr. Webster did 
not entertain any adequate expectations of his future eminence ; 
or, if he had such expectations, they were entirely concealed, as 
appears from the following anecdote. - Speaking of his future 
prospects in life, he remarked, that, if ever he should attain in 
his profession, to the standing of a certain young lawyer, whom 
he named, whose merit consisted more in an easy and ready 
mode of argument, than in sound learning, he, Mr. Webster, 
would have reached his highest elevation. The sincerity of this 
statement was questioned, on the ground that his scholarship in 
college had always been universally allowed to be of the highest 
grade, which was not true of the gentleman alluded to. " Ay," 
said he, "but the opinion of my scholarship was a mistaken 
one. It was overestimated. I will explain what I mean. Many 
other students read more than I did and knew more than I did. 
But so much as I read, I made my own. When a half hour or 
an hour, at most, had elapsed, I closed my book and thought 
over what I had read. If there was anything peculiarly interesting or striking in the passage, I endeavored to recall it and 
lay it up in my memory, and commonly could effect my object. 
Then, if in debate or conversation afterwards, any subject came 
up on which I had read something, I could talk very easily so far 
as I had read, and then I was very careful to stop. Thus, greater 
credit was given me for extensive and accurate knowledge than 
I really possessed." At other times, also, Mr. Webster made 
remarks indicating moderate expectations of his eminence in 
future life. 

When Mr. Webster had been admitted to the bar, he attended, 
among other courts, those of Grafton county. A man who had 
once labored for Judge Webster was for some cause confined 
in jail, at Haverhill. While there, he murdered a fellow prisoner. He had engaged the late Hon. P. Sprague, a distinguished lawyer and advocate, to defend him. Mr. Webster 
went into the jail, during the session of the court, to see the 
prisoner, who had been a servant of his father. He was requested 
by him to render what aid he could to Mr. Sprague, at the trial. 
He consented to do so. The evidence of the prisoner's guilt 
was so palpable and conclusive, that Mr. Sprague refused to 
make an argument in his defence. In this emergency, the unpractised youth did not shrink from the duty ; but the greatness 
of the occasion, to wit, the life or death of a human being, 
seemed almost to add inspiration to his native powers of mind. 
He made an argument of such wonderful force and ingenuity, 
that all who heard were astonished. The eminently learned 
and accomplished Judge Smith was then Chief Justice of the 
Superior Court of New Hampshire. He is said to have been 
more lavish of his encomiums upon the young advocate, than he 
had ever been known to be with regard to any other gentleman. 

Such are a few of the incidents that occur to my mind respecting Mr. Webster's early life. Some of these you may possibly 
make use of in your eulogy of Mr. Webster. 

Very sincerely and respectfully your friend and servant, 

JACOB W. McGAW. 



REV. BROWN EMERSON TO PROF. SANBORN* 

Salem, November 19, 1852. 

MY DEAR SIR, Time has obliterated many facts from my 
memory, relative to Hon. Daniel Webster, which might be 
interesting to the students of Dartmouth College. Having been 
with him for three years of his student life, and associated with 
him in the same literary society, the United Fraternity, I had 
an opportunity to know more of him than many others. You 
inquire respecting his habits of order, punctuality, and preparation for his recitations. On these points, some of the surviving 
members of his class can give you more particular information. 
As a classical and belles-lettres scholar, and as a speaker and debater, he stood far above all the other members of the college. 
Though young, he gave such unequivocal evidence of superior 
genius, that some, I recollect, predicted his future eminence. 
The powers of his mind were remarkably displayed by the compass and force of his arguments in extemporaneous debates at 
the meetings of our literary society. At that early day, the 
clearness of his reasonings, connected with his aspect and manner, produced an almost irresistible impression upon his hearers. 
His large, black, piercing eye, peering out under dark, overhanging brows; his broad, intellectual forehead; the solemn tones of 
his voice ; the dignity of his mien, with an earnestness by which 
he seemed to throw his whole great soul into his subject, evin
cing the sincerity of his belief that the cause he advocated was 
that of truth and justice ; all these created a power of eloquence 
which few could resist ; and which, in the maturity of his life, 
neither judge nor jury could withstand, giving him success as 
an advocate, which, in our country, is without a parallel. I 
was not much acquainted with his brother Ezekiel ; but I well 
remember his fine personal appearance, and that some then 
thought his talents superior to Daniel's. 

With much respect and esteem, yours, 

BROWN EMERSON. 



MR. FARRAR TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Derry, November 25, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, In answer to your inquiries, I give you my recollections of Daniel Webster's early life. I was in the class 
before him. Mr. Webster, Freeborn Adams, my brother William and myself, roomed at my father's house, during the first 
two years of his college course. Webster very early showed 
that he possessed talents of the first order. He was one of the 
best in his class as a linguist. He acquired knowledge with 
little labor. He read much. His memory was very retentive. 
By reading twenty or more pages of poetry, twice over, I have 
heard him repeat it almost verbatim. He was much in the 
habit of extemporaneous speaking. His favorite reading was 
general history and philosophy. He was a strict observer of 
the Sabbath, and a careful reader of the Bible and religious 
books. He possessed talents rarely found in union, a good 
judgment and a retentive memory. His social qualities were 
highly attractive. Even when a youth, he absorbed the attention of all present by his agreeable conversation. He was 
pleasant without ostentation. He enjoyed gunning and fishing ; 
though he spent but little time in those recreations. When 
abroad on any excursion, a volume of poetry, from his pocket, 
would often engross his -attention. During one of the last 
years of his college life, he was chosen orator for the Fourth 
of July, and delivered an oration before the Faculty and students of the college and the citizens of Hanover, which was 
published. Yours respectfully, 

5* GEORGE FARRAR. 


REV. GEORGE T. CHAPMAN TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Newburyport, January 25, 1853. 

DEAR SIR, In answer to your favor of the 7th instant, I 
have to remark, that all my recollections of Ezekiel Webster 
are of a gratifying character. In the senior year, we occupied 
rooms opposite to each other, in a building directly north of the 
college. I am therefore enabled to state, from intimate personal 
acquaintance, that he was altogether exemplary in his habits and 
faithful in his studies. He had no enemies, and all were happy 
to be numbered in the list of his friends. Owing to his absence 
in teaching school, no part was assigned him at Commencement. 
But I have no doubt he stood high in the estimation of the 
college faculty; and although I should hesitate to pronounce 
him the first scholar in his class, it would be doing injustice to 
his memory to say that he was excelled by either of those who 
received the highest college honors on the day of our graduation. It has been recently stated, that he was particularly distinguished for his knowledge of Greek ; but I cannot now recall 
the circumstance to mind ; nor, in fact, make any discrimination 
as to relative proficiency in the several branches of study. He 
was deficient in none. He was good in all. Such, at least, is 
my recollection of the reputation he enjoyed. After leaving 
college, from all that I have heard, he obtained a greater degree 
of eminence, in the eye of the public, than any of his classmates ; 
and when I revert to college days, after the lapse of almost half 
a century, all my recollections of what he then was, cause me 
to feel no surprise at the subsequent elevation which he 
.attained. 

Very truly yours, 

G. T. CHAPMAN. 



MR. BINGHAM TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Washington, D. C., November 25, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 12th instant, requesting facts 
respecting Mr. Webster's student life, was duly received. Your 

inference from the letters that you have seen from me to Daniel 
Webster, when we were boys together, "that there was a 
peculiar intimacy between us," was very justly drawn ; although 
I have now scarcely the slightest recollection of what I may 
have communicated, in those letters of my youthful days, and 
at a time when, in consequence of that intimacy, we used to 
unbosom ourselves to each other, with all the ardor and confidence of true friendship. Our first acquaintance was at the 
academy, at Exeter, in 1796. I went there, in July of that 
year, and found him there. He was then a lad of about fourteen years, attending to English grammar, arithmetic, &c., 
always very prompt and correct in his recitations. He had an 
independent air and was rather careless in his dress and appearance, but showed an intelligent look. He did not join much in 
the plays and amusements of the boys of his age, but paid close 
attention to his studies. He left, in the fall of that year, and I 
believe soon became a pupil of Dr. Wood, of Boscawen, and 
there fitted for college, and entered, August, 1797. I remained 
at Exeter till July, 1798, then entered the Freshman class in 
Dartmouth College, where I found Daniel Webster. An intimacy increased between us from that time till we left college ; 
and indeed till we both became settled in business, and so much 
engaged in our several vocations that we seemed to have no 
time or opportunity to continue our former correspondence; 
although, in our occasional business communications, we would 
regret its interruption and make new resolutions. 

Daniel Webster's habits in college were good. He had the 
highest sense of honor and integrity. He was sure to understand the subject of his recitation ; sometimes, I used to think, 
in a more extended and comprehensive sense than his teachers. 
He never liked to be confined to small technicalities or views ; 
but seemed to possess an intuitive knowledge of whatever 
subject he was considering. He did not find it necessary, as 
was the case with most of us, to sit down to hard work three 
or four hours to make himself master of his lesson, but seemed 
to comprehend it in a larger view, and would sometimes procure 
other books on the same subject, for further examination, and 
employ hours in close thought, either in his room or in his walk, 
which would enlarge his views, and might at the same time, 
with some, give him the character of not being a close student. 
He was a favorite with the class generally ; interesting and 
instructive in conversation ; social and very kind in his feelings ; 
not intimate with many. His compositions and college themes, 
orations in the society, and occasional written exercises, all 
showed the marks of great genius and great familiarity with 
history and politics, for one of his years. He did not speak on 
Commencement day, but gave a very fine oration before the 
" United Fraternity." He gave, a short time before, an excellent 
eulogy on his classmate, Simonds, of whom he speaks in a 
letter to me dated at Salisbury, June 14, 1801, as follows: 
" Dear Hervey, My first business is to inquire about Simonds. 
Oh, that I could be assured that he is recovering ! but perhaps 
this is a happiness never to be allowed us. Let our prayers 
ascend together for his well being, whether with us or in another 
world. If there be any possible way of communication, pray 
let me hear how he is." And in another letter, in October, 
1801, in answer to some remark I made on the subject, in a 
letter to him, Mr. Webster says : 

" If the funeral oration be thought decent, I am content ; 
equal to the subject it is not. The death of Simonds was a 
theme on which the first writers ought to be proud to point 
their pens. Heimihi! Qualiserat!" 

The above is an instance of the kind feelings and high estimation which Mr. Webster was always accustomed to exercise 
towards those whom he considered true and worthy friends. I 
have some fifty letters from him, all good, and some superior, 
according to circumstances. I will close this long letter, by 
copying the last letter received by me from Mr. Webster, in 
answer to a request that he would, if consistent and convenient, 
favor me with his influence to procure some place for me, by 
which I could obtain a comfortable support for myself and 
family. It is as follows : 

Washington, February 5, 1849. 

MY DEAR OLD CLASSMATE, ROOM-MATE, AND FRIEND, It gives 
me very true pleasure to hear from you, and to learn that 
you are well. Years have not abated my affectionate regard. 
We have been boys together, and men together, and now, are 
growing old together ; but you always occupy the same place 
in my remembrance and good wishes. You are still James 

Hervey Bingham, with your old bass viol, with " Lam Deo " 
painted upon it ; I hope you have it yet ; and I am the same 
Daniel Webster, whom you have known, at Exeter, at Lempster, at Chariest own, at Salisbury, at Alstead, at Portsmouth, 
Claremont, Boston, and Washington. And now, my dear 
friend, after this retrospective glimpse, let me say, that I know 
nothing of those who are coming into power; that I expect 
to possess no particular influence or association with them ; 
but that, if any occasion arises in which I can be useful to you, 
you can command my most attentive services. 

Will you please give my love to a lady, whom I had once the 
honor of knowing as Miss Charlotte Kent. 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Such was the letter. / consider it the most elegant and comprehensive document that was ever embraced in the same small 
space. By the " attentive services," promised in that letter, I 
hold my place here, and hope the influence may continue through 
the next administration, if I should live to need the benefits of it. 

Very respectfully, your obedient friend and servant, 

JAMES H. BINGHAM. 



REV. S. OSGOOD TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Springfield, December 5, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, I received your letter of the 1st instant, enclosing 
one of mine to my old friend, Daniel Webster. I deeply regret 
that I have not preserved any of his letters to me, except two 
that I received from him after he became Secretary of State. 
Mr. Webster was an early and dear friend of mine, and continued his friendship to the last. A few months before his 
decease, he sent me one of his speeches, superscribed, " For my 
old, long tried, and highly valued friend, Rev. Dr. Osgood." I 
have no doubt that he felt all that he expressed ; for he had uniformly treated me with respect and affection ; he always called 
on me when he stopped in this place, and often invited me to 
visit him at his home. He came to Fryeburg in 1802, and took 
charge of the academy, boarding in my father's family. As I 
was so near his age and had nearly closed my preparation to 
enter college, at an advanced standing, we soon contracted an 
intimate friendship, which was mutually preserved amidst all 
the changes of our lives. You ask : " Was he grave or gay ; 
serious or trifling ? " I answer : he was always dignified in his 
deportment. He was usually serious, but often facetious and 
pleasant. He was an agreeable companion, and eminently 
social with all who shared his friendship. He was greatly 
beloved by all who knew him. His habits were strictly abstemious, and he neither took wine nor strong drink. He was punctual in his attendance upon public worship, and ever opened his 
school with prayer. I never heard him use a profane word, and 
never saw him lose his temper. He was at that time in 
straitened circumstances, and paid his board by copying deeds 
for my father, who was register for the county. He spent all 
the time he could save from labor and necessary recreation in 
study and in meditation in the fields. He was very fond of this 
kind of relaxation ; and many were the rambles which we took 
together. While at Fryeburg, he delivered an oration on the 
Fourth of July, which was greatly admired by the Federal party 
and much disliked by the Democratic ; but it had great merit 
and was a finished production. I frequently saw him after I was 
settled in the ministry. I spent some hours with him, at his own 
house, in Portsmouth, soon after his marriage with Miss Fletcher. 
At that time, his religious sentiments corresponded with my own. 
In Dorchester, he attended Dr. Codman's church, and was punctually present at two services. When he passed a Sabbath in 
Springfield, he seldom went to any other church than ours. Mr. 
Howard informed me that he once called on Mr. Webster, while 
here, to conduct him to the sanctuary. When they left the 
hotel, Mr. Howard said : " Now I will go wherever you desire 
to go." Mr. Webster said : " I think I will go and hear my old 
pupil." He never spent but one Sabbath here after that. It 
was our Communion, and he partook with us. I have thus 
hastily answered all your inquiries. 

With much respect, 

SAMUEL OSGOOD. 



MR. PETTENGILL TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Salisbury, January 14, 1853. 

DEAR SIR, From boyhood to manhood, and from manhood 
to the termination of their lives, I knew the brothers, Ezekiel 
and Daniel Webster well ; and I regret that I am not able to 
recollect more incidents of their early days. Few of the contemporaries of Ezekiel and myself, and few, indeed, of our classmates remain to tell the story of the life of my departed friend, 
or record his virtues. Most of our classmates have entered the 
portals of the unseen world, and have left only some ten or 
twelve, out of thirty-four, treading the vestibule. I understand 
from the tenor of your letter, that a somewhat minute account 
of your father-in-law is desired, as also his standing in college 
and his character as a citizen and a man. My relation must 
necessarily be minute and circumstantial, if I aim to inform or 
interest you ; and some particulars, I well know, may be considered trifling and unessential to general readers, and especially 
to those who were strangers to my esteemed friend. 

Of his father, Hon. Ebenezer Webster, I have a perfect recollection, as to form and features. His stature was nearly six 
feet. He was compact, robust, and well-proportioned, and, late 
in life, inclined to corpulency. His complexion was dark; a 
broad and projecting forehead ; eyes large, black, and piercing, 
overshadowed by heavy brows. With respect to intellect, he 
was a perfect example of a strong-minded, unlettered man ; of 
sound common sense, correct judgment, and tenacious memory ; 
all of which desirable mental qualities were for him, to some 
extent, a substitute for education. He was a resolute, determined character, and never easily turned from his purpose, when 
once convinced that it was right. He was among the early 
settlers of Salisbury, at a time when that portion of the country 
was almost a wilderness ; and the place where his sturdy arm 
first felled the forest, was purchased, some two or three years ; 
since, by his son, Hon. Daniel Webster. It is situated on the 
North Road, so called, about three miles from Franklin village, 
and about the same distance from the East meeting-house, in 
Salisbury. The location was not a very eligible one for Judge 
Webster. The land was of an inferior quality. It must be 
recollected, however, that when he first became a settler in 
Salisbury, it was a day of small things. He was poor, and 
made a pitch, as they called it, where land was cheapest. On 
this spot, beside a small brook, the father of the Websters first 
erected his log house, the foundations of which are still visible ; 
and in this place his sons first saw the light. On this same 
brook, in the course of three or four years, he erected a small 
gristmill for the accommodation of himself and his neighbors. 
A venerable lady, living near me, now eighty-seven years of age, 
has recently informed me, that, when twelve or fourteen years 
old, she was often sent to this mill, on horseback, with a grist, 
as was the custom of those days, when carriages were unknown. 
While her grist was grinding, it was her custom to visit the 
family ; and she has a perfect recollection of Ezekiel and Daniel, 
then small boys. She also informed me that " the Captain," as 
he was styled, a few years later erected a framed house, at that 
day called " a saw-mill house," from its resemblance to a sawmill, being low, long, and narrow. In this house he and his 
family lived many years, till he sold and removed to the banks of 
the Merrimac, now Franklin, to the house which he occupied at 
the time of his decease. It is now called " the Webster Place." 
Judge Webster was much in town business ; for many years in 
succession he was chosen moderator in the town meetings, and 
one of the Selectmen. He was also frequently called to represent the town of Salisbury in the Legislature. He was an 
officer in the revolutionary war, and commanded a company at 
the battle of Bennington. A sergeant of his company informed 
me that he was among the first to scale the Tory breastwork, as 
it was called ; and that, when he came out of the battle, he was 
so covered with dust and powder that he could scarcely be 
recognized. I have been informed that the Captain often 
repeated, with much pleasure and exultation, the laconic address 
of General Stark, previous to the engagement. With the mother 
of Ezekiel, I was partially acquainted. She, like her husband, 
,was of a dark complexion, with strongly marked features, indicative of a strong mind and sound sense. So we see, that, from 
both parents, the sons inherited that strength of intellect which, 
in after life, rendered them so conspicuous. The well, dug by 
the Judge, in the early days of his pilgrimage, near the logcabin, still remains ; and both of his distinguished sons, when
ever they visited the place of their birth, which was often, made 
it a point to drink from. " the old oaken bucket," in remembrance 
of the days of their childhood. Of Daniel Webster, I need not 
speak. The world has long since made up its judgment respecting the talents, character, and virtues of this eminent statesman ; and any additional remarks from an obscure individual 
would be lost, like a ripple upon the bosom of old ocean. In 
accordance with your request, I will proceed to speak of Ezekiel 
Webster, as I knew him in youth and mature age. For more 
than twenty years, we were inhabitants of the same town, and 
very frequently together. At the age of twenty, and from that 
time to the day of his sudden death, we were intimate friends. 
His form and features are still present to my mind's eye ; and 
could I command the chisel of a Praxiteles, I could transmit 
him to posterity, as I saw him in the prime of life and the 
maturity of manhood. His height was about that of his father, 
nearly six feet. He was an improved edition of his father, in 
form and features, and had such a form as a statuary, without 
any disparagement to his art, might select for a model. His 
complexion was some shades lighter than that of his father or 
brother. The form of his head and face was essentially Grecian ; 
his forehead broad and elevated ; his eyes large, dark, and brilliant, and the whole contour and expression of his countenance 
such as to inspire confidence in his friends, and command 
respect from his enemies, if he had any. Many years before 
that sad and sudden stroke, which deprived the community of 
his talents and usefulness, his hair, which was abundant, became 
white as snow, which gave him a venerable appearance, some 
years in advance of his age. All who saw him in the maturity 
of his manhood, were impressed with his dignified personal 
appearance and the striking expression of his countenance. 
His boyhood and youth, till the age of about twenty, were spent 
with his father, in agricultural pursuits ; and in manual labor, 
he is said to have excelled most of his competitors. He enjoyed 
in early life only the advantages of the common schools of his 
native town. In his twentieth year, through the influence of his 
brother, then a member of Dartmouth College, with slender 
means, for his father was not affluent, he began to prepare for 
college. At the academy in Salisbury, then a new institution, 
and something of a novelty in that part of the country, Ezekiel 
VOL. i. 6 
Webster commenced his preparatory studies. The writer was 
a member of the same school and engaged in the same pursuits ; 
and what he now says is from personal knowledge. Mr. Webster had previously attained to a competent knowledge of English grammar and arithmetic. He commenced, at Salisbury, 
with the Latin grammar ; all the necessary parts of which he 
dispatched in the same time employed by ordinary students in 
learning the declensions of substantives. His mind was vigorous, his memory tenacious, and his industry incessant. He 
therefore mastered JEsop's fables in Latin, and the history of 
Eutropius, preparatory classics at that day, with great ease and 
expedition. When he commenced Virgil, he was classed with 
one whom, in a few days, he left far in the rear, to plod along 
as best he might. No doubt Webster's progress in the language appeared to his tardy companion like a dream. I think 
that he attended only two terms at this school, during which 
time he read the ^Eneid, besides the preparatory books above 
named, and a part of the four Evangelists in Greek. He often 
read three or four hundred lines of Virgil at a lesson. He 
finished his preparatory studies with Dr. Wood, of Boscawen. 
While in college, he ranked with the first in his class, in all the 
different branches at that time taught at Dartmouth ; and was 
particularly noted for his industry, sobriety, and regular deportment. During his residence at college, he taught schools in the 
winter vacations. One of his schools was in Salisbury, in the 
district where I now live. He had charge of a numerous and 
disorderly multitude ; and from his known character for firmness 
and resolution, I have no doubt that he trained, governed, and 
instructed them well. For the last half of his senior year, he 
was engaged much of the time in teaching a select school in 
Boston ; impelled to do so, as I learned, from want of funds. 
When he came on for examination, it was expected by some 
that he would be found in arrears ; but it was soon ascertained 
that he had lost no ground and was able to compete with the 
best of them. During his entire college course, he sustained the 
reputation of a regular, industrious, and well-grounded scholar, 
and a young gentleman of good habits and exemplary morals ; 
and what was of equal value, and told much in his favor, he 
acquired the respect and love of his class. He commenced the 
practice of the law in Boscawen, in 1807, in the office that had 

previously been occupied by his brother, Daniel. On the Fourth 
of July of that year, at the request of the principal inhabitants 
of his native town of Salisbury, he delivered an oration, which, 
for sound sense, correct reasoning, beauty of style, and purity 
of diction, has been excelled by few of the numerous productions 
which that occasion has called forth. Whoever has read that 
address must regret that so few of the products of his pen have 
been given to the world. Indeed, whatever proceeded from his 
tongue or his pen bore the marks of a sound and discriminating 
mind. He soon attained to an extensive practice in his profession ; and his standing at the bar, in the counties of Hillsborough and Grafton, was among the first ; not so particularly as 
an advocate, at the outset, as for the soundness and safety of his 
counsel. He was well grounded in the principles of the common law, which enabled him as it were by intuition to seize 
upon the strong points of his case. This knowledge he used 
to the best advantage, and often to the discomfiture of his opponents. For some years before his decease, he rose to eminence 
as an advocate in the county of Merrimac, where I doubt if he 
had a superior. I have reason to know that his brother Daniel 
often consulted him, not only on difficult points of law, but 
upon the most common interests of life. In the Legislature of 
New Hampshire, in which he often sat, his candor, moderation, 
and good sense, obtained for him the same respect and influence 
which he had in society, wherever he was known. In private 
life, he was an example of moral rectitude; sober, studious, 
industrious, and contemplative. In the relations of son, brother, 
father, and husband, his example is worthy of all praise and 
imitation. He was fond of agriculture and horticulture. His 
beautiful grounds, garden, and buildings, on Boscawen Plain, 
were a proof of his refined taste and laudable industry. He 
took a lively interest in agriculture, and his townsmen are much 
indebted to him for improvements in various branches of husbandry. Learning and religion also received his warm and 
constant support. 

Very respectfully yours, 

THOMAS H. PETTENGILL. 


MR. ABBOTT TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Nashua, February 5, 1853. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your favor, asking for my early recollections 
of Mr. Webster, was duly received, and has remained much too 
long unanswered. I have sought in vain to find a file of 
papers, which I am sure I laid by many years ago, but have 
failed in finding. They could never have been destroyed by me, 
nor wittingly by any of my household. I do not yet despair of 
putting my hand on them, at some lucky moment, when I am 
not seeking for them. 

My acquaintance with Mr. Webster commenced immediately 
after his graduation, at Dartmouth College, which was in August, 1801. The office of Mr. Thompson, with whom I was 
then reading law, was situated nearly opposite his father's 
house. As there were but few companions for us in that place, 
we at once formed a friendship, which has never been interrupted. In his earlier days, he always made my house his home, 
when he was travelling in this direction. Mr. Webster remained 
at home, as I think, till about the 1st of November following, 
when he took his departure for his school in Fryeburg, on horseback, with his wardrobe and library in his saddle-bags. I 
accompanied him across the river, where we shook hands, mutually agreeing to correspond. 

Mr. Thompson had an extensive library, not only of law but 
of history. I think Mr. Webster occupied himself at that time 
more with the latter than the former, but he was always busy 
at something. He was fond of hunting and fishing, he was " an 
excellent shot" then; and what time we could conveniently 
spare from the office, we used to employ in ranging the neighboring woods for partridges, quails, squirrels, &c. ; and the pond, 
where he afterwards kept his boat, we occasionally visited with 
great success. He seemed to be acquainted with everybody in 
that region, and always had a pleasant word for each. 

I recollect an incident which showed his scrupulous integrity. 
Mr. Thompson was postmaster, in Salisbury, while I was in 
his office. In his absence, I had the entire charge of it. One 
morning I found a letter on the desk, addressed to his brother 
Ezekiel, at Hanover, marked as a double one. When I took it 

up to mail it, knowing the superscription to be Daniel's, 1 said 
to him, if you had not marked it double, I never should have 
suspected that it was so. " I thought as much," said he, " but 
I remembered to have read somewhere, that it is better to be 
honest, than to appear so." At this time, two pieces of paper, 
however small, constituted a double letter, with double postage, 
which to Hanover was twenty cents, which he paid. The letter 
contained only a twenty dollar bill, which he was sending to his 
brother. This was done when money was very scarce with 
him. 

I have no recollection of ever meeting Mr. Webster at any 
boarding-house or public room on the Sabbath. The family 
were all strict observers of the Lord's day. He almost invariably attended church, which was four miles distant, though he 
generally rode on horseback. In the whole course of our 
acquaintance, of more than half a century, I have never heard 
him use a profane word. He wrote for Mr. Hough's paper, at 
Concord. His signature I do not now recollect. I believe the 
Newsboy's Address for January 1, 1802, in poetry, of course, was 
written by him. Ezekiel was at Hanover, or out of college 
teaching school, while I was at Salisbury. I recollect seeing 
him but once, and then for a short time only. 

The father was a right down plain, honest farmer of the " old 
school." Independent and frank in his own opinions, he was 
willing others should enjoy theirs, if they differed from him. 
His bright and active years were passed before I knew him ; 
but he was always industrious about the useful but less arduous 
duties of the farm. 

If I recover my lost letters, I shall be able to give you some 
more facts at a future time. 

Very truly your Mend, 

DANIEL ABBOTT. 



MR. HOTCHKISS TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Shreveport, Caddo Parish, Louisiana, February 25, 1853. 
DEAR SIR, In answer to the inquiries contained in your 
letter of November 22, respecting the college life of my classmate, Daniel Webster, I will now give you such facts as I can 
6* 
recall. I joined the Freshman class at the beginning of the 
second term. As I entered my class for the first time, being a 
stranger to all present, I scanned with deep interest the personal 
appearance and attainments of every member. I also observed 
the manner in which each one performed his part in the recitation. All did well. I thought Webster acquitted himself 
admirably, and, indeed, a little better than the rest. I can truly 
say that all his exercises, through his whole collegiate course, 
improved in excellence as time advanced. He was always 
punctual in all the recitations, exercises, and studies of the class. 
Daniel Webster never required as much time to make himself 
familiar with the subjects of his studies as many others, who 
also performed well their parts. His range of study was more 
general than that of his classmates. The ease with which he 
acquired knowledge afforded him much time for promiscuous 
reading. His leisure hours were not lost ; they were occupied 
in the way of literary improvement. He took time for exercise 
and recreation, and joined in the sports and amusements common to students at that time. Their pastimes consisted in the 
game of ball and other athletic exercises. 

Webster was never an idle student, as some persons falsely 
and erroneously believe. I have often been questioned on that 
subject, and have always taken upon myself the pleasing task 
of promptly denying the charge and correcting the mistake. In 
the pursuit of useful knowledge no person could be more assiduous than Daniel Webster. No blame could justly be brought 
against his moral character ; no person could impute to him a 
mean or unworthy act. In his intercourse with society,, he was 
kind, affable, and courteous. He was an agreeable companion, 
and was highly esteemed by his college acquaintances. There 
were, perhaps, as many good scholars in our class as could be 
found in any other class of the same number. Webster was 
considered the best. Often, in our private circles, the subject 
of his superior scholarship and fine talents was discussed. 
From my first acquaintance with him I had predicted for him a 
brilliant future, and I have seen that prediction signally verified. 

Respectfully yours, 

E. HOTCHKISS. 



MR. SHATTUCK TO PROF. SANBORN. 

Lancaster, Mass., December 27, 1855. 

DEAR SIR, Yours of December 21 is before me. You ask 
for reminiscences of the college life of the late Hon. Daniel 
Webster. So far as I am aided by an octogenarian memory, I 
would say, that Mr. Webster's habits of study while in college 
were good. His mode of recitation was prompt and off-hand ; 
ever standing side by side with the best specimens of scholarship in his class, and in some particulars, especially in composition and oratory, ahead of them all. His deportment was 
easy and gentlemanly ; his dress decent, suited to the occasion ; 
nothing superfluous or deficient. I never knew, or heard, or 
thought of any thing objectionable in his moral character. He 
was sometimes humorous, always companionable and pleasant. 
He possessed a very clear and comprehensive mind, and on 
graver subjects was bold and lion-like in language. I have 
heard of some anecdotes of Mr. Webster's college life which 
seem to have no foundation in truth. If the events reported 
ever occurred, I was not cognizant of the facts. 

Respectfully yours, 

N. SHATTUCK.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO GEORGE HERBERT. 

Dartmouth College, December 20, 1798. 
YES, George, I go, I leave the friend I love, 
Long since 'twas written in the books above ; 
But what, Good God ! I leave thee, do I say ? 
The thought distracts my soul and fills me with dismay. 
But Heaven decreed it, let me not repine ; 
I go ; but, George, my heart is knit with thine. 
In vain old Time shall all his forces prove, 
To tear my heart from the dear friend I love ; 
Should you be distant far as Afric's sand, 
By Fancy pictured you'd be near at hand. 
This shall console my thoughts, till time shall end, 
Though George be absent, George is still my friend. 
But other friends I leave : it wounds my heart, 
To leave a Gilman, Conkey, and a Clark ; 
But Hope through the sad thought my soul shall bear : 
Bereft of hope I'd sink in dark despair. 
When Phoebus a few courses shall have run, 
And e'er old Aries shall receive the sun, 
I shall return, nor more shall fear the day, 
That from my friends shall take poor me away ; 
O then roll on, ye lagging wheels of time, 
Roll on the hour ; till then, dear George, I'm thine. 

D. W. 

Let love and friendship reign, 

Let virtue join the train 

And all their sweets retain, 

Till Phoebus' blaze expire ; 
Till God, who rules on high, 
Shall rend the tottering sky, 
All nature gasping die 
And Earth be wrapt in fire.

SALVE !

BUT quit old Pegasus and soar on high, 
In Fancy's air balloon traverse the sky, 
Where hills of hail and heaps of snow are seen, 
Kept in reserve, Heaven's awful magazine. 
Then bend your course aloft beyond the sun, 
Where other globes in other orbits run ; 
Where other Comets glide along their spheres, 
And other planets measure other years ; 
Where other men inhabit realms afar, 
To whom our sun is but a twinkling star. 
Then further soar along the Milky Way, 
Where our old sun ne'er cast a glimmering ray. 
When thus, dear George, you see with wondering eye 
Systems on systems roll along the sky, 
Then, friend, consider that there is a God 
Who rules this vast machine, and governs with a nod.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO GEORGE HERBERT. 1 
(EXTRACT.) 

Dartmouth College, January 7, 1801. 

I FIND, brother George, that if I would allure an answer to my 
letters, I must exalt my subject from those trifles which effemi
1 Mr. Herbert had now graduated and removed to Stockbridge, Mass. 

nate our sex, to those affairs which mark the man of information and business. I shall likewise, perhaps, find it necessary 
to round my periods with more attention, and endeavor to 
grace my sentences with the flourishes of rhetoric. For the sake 
of continuing a correspondence, I would willingly attempt any 
thing within the compass of my capacity, but the frog must not 
strive to swell to the size of the ox. 

Two things I can't say I like ; Jefferson's election to the Presidency, and Hamilton's letter. Of the two, I prefer the former. 
There is some consistency in the Jacobins raising Thomas to 
the Executive Chair ; it is in conformity to their avowed principles. But Hamilton's letter is void of congruity. 

Let us just notice one absurdity, which you have undoubtedly 
observed. Hamilton proposes to prove that there are certain 
essential defects in the character of Adams, I forget the particular expressions, which unfit him for the office of Chief Magistrate; he labors hard to substantiate this point, and thinks he 
has done it. What is his conclusion ? He does not wish to 
withhold a vote from Mr. Adams. Now mark the consistency. 
He thinks there are a hundred men in the United States better 
calculated for the Presidency than Mr. Adams, for there certainly are that number who do not possess these essential 
defects ; yet he wishes, or professes to wish, every vote given to 
Mr. Adams. Is this consentaneous to all that independence 
which he sets out with ? Is it agreeable to that rigid republicanism which glowed in the breasts of Aristides and Cato ? 

We are every day expecting the electioneering for governor 
to commence in this State with warmth. I never yet drove my 
quill in such a case, perhaps never shall. I may laugh a little ! 
Langdon, it is expected, will be the anti-Federal candidate. 
Oilman, the Federal ; if he declines, Peabody, of Exeter. 

Hem ! Hem ! I am clearing my throat. George P., the son 
of Professor W., observed the other day, (as it was spoken in 
confidence, I will allow you to make more of it than of general, 
report) : " I am told," said he, " that Herbert is somewhat unwell, 
and I believe there is a weed growing round our house, which 
would cure him. Mary is also somewhat sick, and I am told 
there is an herb now growing in the western part of Massachusetts, which would help her." These observations were made 
in Mary's hearing, who replied : " Since you have discovered a 
VOL. i. 7 
weed which you suppose would be beneficial to Mr. Herbert, 
you are in duty bound to communicate your discovery to him." 
I pledge myself, Herbert, for the truth of this ; but shall tell you 
no more of the good or bad things said of you here, till I know 
more distinctly your intention. If you are seriously and honorably inclined, I can tell you enough to give you perfect confidence 
of success ; if you only wish to amuse yourself, and sport with 
the girl, I beg you not to make me your instrument. This 
however I know you cannot intend. I know the nobleness of 
your soul and the purity of your heart. Command my service 
in any way, not inconsistent with the character of a Christian 
and a gentleman, and I will serve you to the ne plus ultra of 
my talents. 

Since you have not answered my other letter, I fear I have 
offended ; I hope not ; for surely you will not accuse me of 
vanity, if I tell you that you have not a friend in existence who 
means better than DANL. WEBSTER.

FROM MRS. HERBERT, TO REV. C. D. HERBERT. 

(Inclosing the preceding letters.) 

Ellsworth, March 6, 1856. 

MY DEAR SON, I am very sorry to disappoint any expectation which Mr. Fletcher Webster may have been led to entertain, that I would be able to furnish him with any considerable 
memorials of his late father. Indeed, I have very little in my 
possession ; only one letter now remaining of his correspondence 
with your father, which is dated the last year of his college life. 
But, as this is rather interesting and indicative of the future man, 
I will enclose it to you, and you can transmit or not, to Mr. 
F. W., as you shall think fit. I find also two little fragments of 
poetry, written when he was very young. They seem quite 
characteristic of the writer, and are creditable both to his head 
and heart. And I also find quite an interesting document, 
entitled " Constitution of the Federal Club," with several signatures appended, among which is that of Daniel Webster. These 
were doubtless intimate friends and choice spirits, of that early 
period of life ; and probably not one of them now survives. 

Messrs. Bracket and Clarke were subsequently settled in the 

legal profession in New York city. The former died about 
1830 ; the latter, ten or eleven years later. Mr. Clarke had long 
since united with the Society of Friends, some said in order to 
advance his professional interests. Your father said, " No, it 
was in accordance with the natural dictates of his heart ; he 
was born a Quaker ! " 

Tristram Oilman was a Maine lad, the son of a clergyman, the 
Rev. Mr. Oilman of North Yarmouth. He died early. Mr. Coffin, 
familiarly called by his college friends, "little Natty Coffin," 
from his diminutive person, was also of Maine, and your father's 
predecessor in this place. On finishing the term of study in Mr. 
Sedgwick's office, your father, on the suggestion and recommendation of Judge Parker, hastened on to Ellsworth, quite 
ignorant that the young lawyer lately established here, but now 
about leaving, was none other than his quondam friend, Natty 
Coffin ! Their mutual recognition and surprise were very amusing. 

Mr. Pierce, after graduating from Dartmouth, was some time 
principal of New Ipswich Academy. I know nothing of him 
in after life, or of Conkey or Cram. 

I have heard your father speak often and much of Daniel 
Webster, for whom he had the truest esteem and friendship ; 
but it is so long since, that particulars are much obliterated from 
my mind. I would gladly recall them, if it were possible. 

As your brother Oeorge went on to St. Augustine the last year 
of his college life, about 1834, he was detained a few days in 
New York, and took the opportunity to pay his respects to Mr. 
Clarke, who treated him very kindly, and recognized him as his 
father's son. The presence of the young collegian seemed to 
open afresh the genial heart of the good old man to reminisences of his own college life, and he gave many pleasant anecdotes relating to those happy times. I should think that a more 
than common attachment existed among the members of his 
class, in general, and that many of them were bound together 
by the closest ties of friendship. Mr. Clarke related that some 
of these friends, or brothers, as they called each other, had rooms 
adjoining; and, in order to facilitate their social enjoyments, 
they made an opening in the intervening partition, which was 
by some ingenious device carefully secured from the general 
observation, but admitted of free ingress and egress to the occupants of the two apartments ; and it would seem that, like the 
early Christians, they had all things common. The first to rise 
in the morning, dressed himself in the best which the united 
apartments afforded ; and so of the rest successively, but woe to 
the latest riser, whose equipments might have been furnished at 
Rag Fair ! 

Mr. Clarke was himself at one time the fortunate possessor 
of a new beaver hat ; not one of the light, cheap, silky, effeminate 
fabrications of later times, but a real eight or ten dollar beaver, 
well made and weighty. It was the envy of all the college. 

The new beaver was one day missing. He sought it everywhere, in vain. In his researches, he happened on an old felt hat 
battered and broken, which he was fain to wear, rather than none. 
Things continued thus for several weeks, when " friend Dan" 
returned from a distant town, where he had spent the vacation in 
school-teaching, and with him came the beaver, which he had 
tacitly borrowed for the occasion ! They shook hands, reexchanged hats, and were better friends than ever. 

These are pleasant anecdotes, such as old men love to recall 
of their innocent boyhood ; but I have heard and could tell of 
far better, relating to those times, more significant of good, if 
I could but distinctly remember them. Young Webster seems 
to have been greatly beloved by his early friends, who prognosticated his future greatness, though they could not, perhaps, 
have anticipated that he would so early have become famous. 

I never saw Mr. Webster, excepting in the winter of 1808, 
when, with your father, I spent several weeks in Boston. Mr. 
and Mrs. Webster, from Portsmouth, were at the same time 
visitors in that city. They were guests in the family of Mr. 
Perkins, a young M. D. recently from Hanover, and one of the 
fraternity of attached friends. To his house your father and 
myself had frequent invitations, and nothing could exceed the 
high enjoyment evinced by Herbert and Webster in the renewed 
intercourse. 

The appearance of Mr. Webster at this time, still youthful, 
yet mature, his fine person and dignified demeanor, though in 
the social private circle most gentle and endearing, is altogether 
indescribable. Mrs. Webster was very sweet and lovely. Her 
smile was perfectly charming and long to be remembered. Some 
few years after, I asked Mr. Allen, (Frederick H.) then a young 

man and recently returned from Washington, where he had 
accompanied his father, if he saw Mrs. Webster. " O yes, 
indeed," he said, he " met with her at the great levee." The 
lady friend who " patronized him," after having presented him 
to several ladies, said to him, " and now I am about to introduce 
you to Mrs. Webster, whom you will find shining among these 
dazzling luminaries with all the sweet and gentle radiance of 
the Evening Star ! " 

But I must stop. Please make my best excuses to Mr. 
Fletcher Webster, and forward to him such of the manuscripts 
as you think best. They look very worn out and shabby, and in 
self-justification, I must say, so did they when I first saw them, 
nearly half a century ago !

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, February 5, 1800. 

THE political events of Europe, my friend Hervey, are so novel 
and unexpected, revolution succeeds revolution in such rapid succession, that it is sufficient to overpower the understanding and 
confound the calculations of the most sage politician. These 
events are attended with such important circumstances, involve 
so many and so various interests, that schemes either of aggrandizement or of defence are agitated and devised in every cabinet 
of Europe. Nor is it to be expected, at this eventful crisis, that 
the decisions of our Executive are to be uninfluenced by considerations of transatlantic occurrences. Were we, like China, 
divested of every commercial engagement, we might, like that 
empire, remain unmoved, while convulsed Europe tottered to its 
base. To suppose that the liberty of United America, depends 
on the balance of power on the Eastern continent, is an idea 
exploded by every whig of '76, and which ought to be deemed 
absurd and preposterous. But our connections with foreign 
nations are such, that to preserve unaffected our commercial 
interests, while revolutions are making such monstrous strides 
in Europe, is beyond the reach of human sagacity. Adams, 
however, has hitherto conducted us in tolerable safety through 
the dangers which have beset us, and on him, under the guidance 
of an overruling Providence, we must rely, as the only rock of 
our political salvation. I, who am a mere novice in the science 
of politics, have done calculating. I have heretofore applied 
logical, metaphysical, mathematical, and philosophical theorems, 
but have found them all insufficient to solve one political problem. 

Who thought, six months ago, that Bonaparte, who was then 
represented as lying with his slaughtered army on the plains of 
Egypt, to taint the air, and gorge the monsters of the Nile, would 
at this time have returned to France, have destroyed the Directory and Legislative Councils, have established a triumvirate, and 
have placed himself at its head which is saying, have virtually 
made himself sovereign of France ? Who could have predicted 
that the Duke of York, who so late was marching victoriously 
through Holland, should ere this time have entered into a convention, by which he was to give up all his booty and prisoners, 
and evacuate the country ? Or, whoever supposed that Paul, 
emperor of Russia, who so lately was raising one hundred and 
eighty thousand men, to reinforce his armies, should now order 
Suwarrow, with his veteran Cossacks, to quit the field and return 
home? The occurrences hitherto would have warranted the 
most extravagant expectations ; but these events must have been, 
I think, unprepared for. What unknown cause has wrought 
these changes ? I cannot determine. I am weary of conjecture. 
But, when baffled in attempting to scan the horizon of European 
politics, could I turn my eyes home and be presented with such a 
prospect as was afforded five years ago, I should lift my heart to 
Heaven in a transport of devotion, and exclaim, " Let France or 
England be arbiter of Europe, but be mine the privileges of an 
American citizen." But, Hervey, our prospect darkens ; clouds 
hang around us. Not that I fear the menaces of France ; not 
that I should fear all the powers of Europe leagued together for 
our destruction. No, Bingham, intestine feuds alone I fear. The 
French faction, though quelled, is not eradicated. The southern 
States in commotion ; a Democrat the head of the Executive in 
Virginia ; a whole county in arms against the government of 
McKean, in Pennsylvania; Washington, the great political 
cement dead, and Adams almost worn down with years, and the 
weight of cares. These considerations, operating on a mind 
naturally timorous, excite unpleasant emotions. In my melan
choly moments, I presage the most dire calamities. I already 
see, in my imagination, the time when the banner of civil war 
shall be unfurled ; when Discord's hydra form shall set up her 
hideous yell, and from her hundred mouths shall howl destruction through our empire; and when American blood shall be 
made to flow in rivers, by American swords ! But propitious 
Heaven prevent such dreadful calamities ! Internally secure, 
we have nothing to fear. Let Europe pour her embattled 
millions around us, let her thronged cohorts cover our shores, 
from St. Lawrence to St. Marie's, yet, United Columbia shall 
stand unmoved; the manes of her deceased Washington, shall 
guard the liberties of his country, and direct the sword of freedom in the day of battle. Heaven grant that the bonds of our 
federal union may be strengthened ; that Gallic emissaries and 
Gallic principles may be spurned from our land ; that traitors 
may be abashed, and that the stars and stripes of United Columbia may wave triumphant ! So much for politics. 

I have received your letter, as you must know by my delaying 
to visit you. I shall visit you next Saturday, other things being 
equal. You wonder I did not write, and are about to conclude 
that my friendship for you had decreased ; but, James, form no 
rash conclusions. I did write soon after your departure ; I wrote 
very soon ; I wrote then. I prepared a letter too long, and too 
nonsensical to be read with patience, and determined to send 
it by Mr. Wilson, but did not see him. I then despatched the 
animal by another conveyance, but after a few days travelling it 
returned. However, after a little refreshment, the gentleman 
moved again, and I conclude by this time is arrived at Sanbornton ; where I presume you will deal with his honor according to the fitness of things, that is to say, read till you are tired, 
then burn him. By last mail I had a letter from Fuller all well 
N. and B. were to go last week. S. F er, and Mary, la bonne, 
have gone. Thus you see the circle is broken ; well, Hervey, 
let us then apply ourselves more closely to study. I have to 

impart to you from Mr. Fuller, the love of all the . My 

school increases fast enough. Instead of twenty, I have fifty, 
and shall have more; five English grammarians, I mean students in English, and two Latin scholars. I had a letter not long 
since from J. Nelson, and hope to see him on Saturday at Sanbornton. Much speculation is made here on the scribblers for 
the Dartmouth Gazette. Old Icarus is handled without ceremony. I shall tell you hereafter some pretty things about it. 
Our family would reciprocate their respects. 1 

I am, Sir, with much respect, you*e in the indissoluble bonds 
of fraternal love. D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, February 11, 1800. 

BROTHER BINGHAM, I now sit down in poor spirits to write 
a poor letter, to a poor fellow, shall I say ? No, say rather, to 
the friend of my heart, the partner of my joys, griefs, and affections, the only participator of my most secret thoughts. I arrived 
here yesterday, seasonably for school, and having undergone the 
fatigues of the day, I retired to rest at nine o'clock, and surrendered 
myself to the dominion of Morpheus. At ten, I was awaked, 
and informed that Captain McClure, and Senior Curtis were 
below. I soon disengaged myself from the " slumbering god," 
and hastened to extend them the friendly right hand, accompanied with a hearty how do you do ! They left Hanover almost 
two weeks since ; and have taken a tour to the southeast. By 
them I was favored with two letters from our friends at college, 
which, although dated some time ago, gave me much pleasure. 
Clark writes that he has taken the school there at twenty-four 
dollars per month. Doctor Marsh offered himself for fifteen, but 
was not received. " This," Clark observes, " feeds my vanity, but 
not my purse." In the course of his letter he observes, " blow 
ye Northern blasts with tenfold fury ; beat back the pestilential 
breeze of matrimony, or my Icarus is fallen forever ! " What 
does he hint at here? How should he know that I was just about 
to (try to) be married ? My amour, you very well know, had 
not commenced the last time I wrote to him. He says he is 
well and happy ; that he has heard from many of our friends 
who are in health. This information carries joy to the hearts 
of J. H. B. and D. W. While you rejoice with me in the health 
and happiness of our brother students, I presume from the goodness of your heart, that you will join me in commiserating him 

1 A portion of the above appeared in the Dartmouth Gazette. 

who stands next to yourself on the catalogue of my friends. I 
mean Bracket ; he has lost a sister ; he is afflicted, and we will 
mourn. We have seen him in those happy hours, when every 
heart palpitated with joy, and every eye sparkled with benevolence ; and we should be equally happy to meet him now and 
mingle souls in mournful sympathy. Though not personally 
acquainted with the deceased lady, it is enough to entitle her to 
a share in our remembrance that she was the sister of J. W. B. 
For his sake, then, we will shed the friendly tear and embalm 
her memory in our hearts. After the people were gone to bed, 
I wrote an answer to Clark, and presumed to offer him your best 
respects ; this I conceived I had a right to do, since, between 
you and me, cor corde mutatur. I also wrote to H. W. R, and 
endeavored, with as much delicacy as I was able, to return the 

puellarum pulcherrimarum so politely bestowed on J. H. B. 

and D. W. 

Capt. McClure, in his journey, saw Freeborn, and D. Osgood, 

and J. Dutch, &c. who are well In the letter which you 

did me the honor to send me, you have the following sentence, 
" cave, nequis videat, &c. ; " though it be very handsome Latin, 
and I can find no fault with it as a critic, yet, my dear Hervey, 
I must confess it surprises me much. Do you suspect my integrity ? Do you imagine that I would do any thing which should 
endanger your reputation ? I certainly suspect no such things 
from you, and therefore never think to insert such an idea. If a 
letter from a friend chance to be written inaccurately, as is often 
the case when written calamo currente, which, by the way, could 
not be said of yours, it behooves the receiver to consider it accordingly. Upon the whole, that sentence, though its like is 
frequently seen in letters, argues a suspicion of my sincerity, 
which, were I assured it really existed, would prove an eternal 
alloy to my felicity. But I am willing to impute it to custom, 
to compliment,- or, as you say, to any thing else rather than 
to suspicion. 

It is now nine o'clock ; before I began this letter I read a 
chapter in Mallet du Pan's History of The Destruction of the 
Helvetic Union. I read till I saw Switzerland ravaged and depopulated, her sons barbarously butchered, and blood flowing in 
torrents from the side of the Alps ! All this I saw done by the 
intrigue of perfidious France. The scene was too affecting ; I 
closed the book and exclaimed, " Havoc and spoil and ruin are 
thy gains ; destruction is thy sport ; blood, groans, and desolation are thy triumphs, thou magnanimous republic ! ! ! Switzerland, which has been a republic for almost five hundred years, is 
now no more. The descendants of the immortal Tell, who 
rescued his country from Austrian tyranny, have nothing now 
left, as the historian observes, but rocks, ruins, and demagogues." " Ah, curst ambition, what hast thou done ! " Nor is 
it enough that Switzerland, Venice, Genoa, and every other 
republic in Europe has fallen a prey to the despots of Paris ; one 
quarter of the world cannot satiate their ambition. The worshipper of the Alcoran must be molested, the wandering Arab 
attacked, and slaughter carried to the forests of Africa. Their 
empire must be bounded only by the limit of their ambition ; 
their ambition is coextensive with the universe. I expect that 
Blanchard will soon be despatched with his aerial squadron to 
attack the moon ; to revolutionize the Lunarians by the same 
means that Talleyrand used to disturb the peace of his Satanic 
Majesty No more politics. 

" Sylvarumque potens Diana." A Fable. 

Bright Phoebus long all rival suns outshone, 

And rode triumphant on his splendid throne ; 

When first he waked the blushes of the dawn, 

And spread his beauties o'er the flowery lawn, 

The yielding stars quick hastened from the sky, 

Nor moon dare longer with his glories vie ; 

He reigned supreme, and decked in roseate light 

Beamed his full splendors on the astonished sight. 

At length, on earth, behold a damsel rise, 

Whose growing beauties charmed the wondering skies ! 

As forth she walked to breathe the balmy air, 

And view the beauties of the gay parterre, 

Her radiant glories drowned the blaze of day, 

And through all nature shot a brighter ray. 

Old Phoebus saw and blushed now forced to own, 

That with superior worth the damsel shone. 

Graced with his name, he bade her ever shine. 

And in his rival owned a form divine! 

I am, Sir, with much respect, yours in the indissoluble bonds 
of fraternal love, DAN. WEBSTER.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Hanover, April 25, 1800. 

EZEKIEL, I promised to write to you once more this week ; 
to-morrow is the last day ; well I will write now, but what shall 
I write ? I know not. I have written so frequently this term, that 
I have exhausted my stock. In the last letter I had from you, 
you were telling something about " that fountain of science." 
What fountain do you mean ? My brain ? That is a fountain 
which was always dry ; a droll fountain truly. Do you mean 
the whole institution ? Perhaps, indeed, there may be some 
degree of science in college ; and I should be very willing to 
borrow or buy a little of a fellow-student for the sake of amusing you. 

Therefore, since we are wretchedly poor, you will be good 
enough to take the will for the deed, and believe that I would 
do as much to entertain and instruct you as any man living. 
That "instruct" is a very presumptuous word; erase it, and 
write in its room some one not quite so assuming. 

By this time you have passed over " Arma, virumque cano, 
&c." I presume you scold a little, but don't be frightened. 

You tell me that you have difficulties to encounter, which I 
know nothing of. What do you mean, Ezekiel ? Do you mean 
to flatter ? That don't become you ; or do you think you are 
inferior to me in natural abilities ? If so, be assured you greatly 
mistake. Therefore, for the future, say in your letters to me, " I 
am superior to you in natural endowments ; I will know more in 
one year, than you do now, and more in six than you ever will." 
I should not resent this language. I should be very well pleased 
in hearing it ; but be assured, as mighty as you are, your great 
puissance shall never insure you a victory without a contest. 

Adams, my very good room-mate, has just come on. I feel 
at home now, since my wife has returned. You will ask why 
he did not call on you ; he came by way of Walpole. He will 
probably go home by way of Salisbury, in August, and I presume he will tarry with us a few days. 

There is now before me a newspaper, in which votes stand 
thus : Gilman, 7,302 ; Walker, 4,638. These, when added together, make as great a number, nearly, as was given in for 
governor last year. If, then, this statement be true, which we 
have no reason to doubt, Walker cannot be elected. In Massachusetts, I think it uncertain whether the Strong-man, or the 
weak envoy will be chosen to fill the chair of the supreme executive. I hope, however, that the best man will command the 
suffrages of his fellow-citizens. But an election of much greater 
importance than either of the above will demand our attention 
next September. The question will then be, whether John Adams 
or Thomas Jefferson shall be President of the United States. 

This is the fifth letter I have written to you since I saw you ; 
the last letter I received from you was dated the 8th of April, 
when it seems you had had none from me ; by this time, however, I conclude you have received a number. 

I wish you to inform me how many students are now at the 
academy ; whether any will enter college soon ; where you board, 
what you study, &c., &c. 

As I have now finished the sheet, you will permit me to take 
my leave, while I subscribe myself ever yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

P. S. Respects to all.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Beechnut Hall, Hanover, December 28, 1800. 

DEAR JAMES, Long are the faces of Hanoverians. Jefferson's 
Presidency which now seems certain, sets not very well on our 
stomachs. All the tonics of our political faculty cannot make 
it digest readily. Burr, too, nettles us more than any vegetable 
burr in our fields. However, what cannot be cured must be 
endured. So, friends Jefferson and Burr, we leave you for more 
pleasing subjects. 

Hervey, do you remember the oculum? Yes, I know you do, 
and will while you live, I shall, be sure. You know how poets 
sing of the dove that has lost its mate, or you know how Ossian's maid of Cromla weeps, when the green grass waves o'er 
the tomb of her lover; now make proper deductions t for the 
licentia poetica, and you will learn my feelings since your 
departure. 

You must know that I ha^e made great advances in music 
since you left us. I have not indeed obtained any knowledge 
in the cords or discords of strings or voices, but have attended 
to the music of the soul, the harmony of the passions, and the 
vibrations of the intellectual cords. I have not been vexed nor 
discomposed ; very gay, nor very melancholy ; very learned, nor 
pardon me very ignorant, since I saw you. I am fully persuaded that our happiness is much at our regulation, and that 
the " Know thyself" of the Greek philosopher, meant no more 
than rightly to attune and soften our appetites and passions till 
they should symphonize like the harp of David. Mr. Stewart 
has shown us some fine ideas on it. He is an author whom I 
admire more than any writer I have perused. 

Dear Bingham, it is now half-past ten in the evening. I am 
alone, save a certain fellow by the name of Nap, who, by his 
unceasing clack, one would think would never be able to indulge 
sounder sleep than a nap. Fanny, whom I consider our sister, 
has just retired, and the hour is arrived when you and I were 
used to pile up our books and converse with a fondness I always 
approve, though sometimes think almost childish. If I had any 
thing which the world ought not to know, what a happy moment this for telling it to you ! But nothing occurs which you 
have not heard; you know every ' impression on my heart as 
perfectly as the letters of the alphabet. I need not go to the 
world to bring senseless stories to your ear ; you must already 
be surfeited with Hanover reports, and it will not gratify you to 
learn your friend is implicated in them. I saw S. a moment 
this evening. If the vices, which sometimes tarnish her sex, 
were hanging round her heart, they certainly did not appear in 
her countenance. As I rose to leave the room, a Miss, who sat 
next her, made a very saucy remark. The voice of S. only 
replied, " Why ! " but the gem which sparkled in her eye completed the sentence. As for myself I was silent, but I turned 
my eyes towards the censorious animal, and if I looked as I felt, 
I fancy she repented what she had said. I am not consequential 
enough to furnish a reproof, " a negligendo" but if an inexplicable line of conduct will confound them, I will see two very 
severe observing Misses entangled in perplexities. 

Perhaps I have been imprudent, but nobody shall be unhappy for my imprudence, but myself; for the fulfilment of this 
VOL. i. 8 
promise I pledge my honor. If I ought to, I will. Nobody 
knows whether I wish to. 

I had yesterday a letter from my father. He says I may, if 
I please, visit Boston this winter. I shall not hesitate to accept 
his invitation. 

Wednesday evening, 8 o'clock. 

To-morrow, Hervey, is the first day of the year, and of the 
century. In conformity to custom and the feelings of my own 
heart, I wish you a happy new year. We are just now entering upon a century, which none of us will probably live to see 
closed. There is something solemn in the idea, that a period of 
time is now commencing which will carry us all to Shakespeare's 
bourn whence no traveller returns. The " narrow house " is our 
final mansion, and " there he lies," is an observation which ere 
long will be applicable to us all. May we so conduct, that the 
"narrow house" shall be to us a palace of joy, and that the 
good man may say, concerning us, " there he lies," with his 
hand on his breast, and a tear in his eye ! 

I am, dear Hervey, your 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 

P. S. Fanny sends her compliments. I dare not inform the 
other ladies that I was writing to you, lest they should give me 
so many compliments for you, that I could write nothing else. 
Do not fail to write me immediately. I shall be hereabout three 
weeks longer.

BROTHER BINGHAM, On the eve of departure from Hanover, 
I devote a moment to him whose residence here renders Hanover agreeable. Next Monday, health permitting, I set out for 
Salisbury, not blessed, as the last year, with the company of my 
Hervey. No event worthy of remembrance has transpired 
since you left us, except the ill health of brother Shattuck, who 
has been unwell a number of days, but is recovering. I have 
had a letter from C. Gilbert, dated at Brookfield. " After a tour

of two or three hundred miles," he writes, " friend Upham and 
myself arrived here." Bliss is pedagoguizing in York State, 
the other honorable senator I have not heard from. 

Fanny and Dan. took a ride to Lebanon the other day, and 
I felt the magic of friendship increased by conversation. She 
would be remembered to you. Mr. Bing. is so, without variation. I have an invitation to accompany a gentleman to 
Boston, perhaps I told you, which I think of accepting. Carey 
writes to Bipley that he shall leave his school in Salem in April. 
Salem ! Enchanting name ! Who would have thought that 
from the ashes of witches, hung a century ago, should have 
sprung such an arch coquette as should delight in sporting with 
the simplicity of

Do write me immediately ; send to Hanover or Windsor, and 
then by mail to Salisbury. A letter from Hervey always carries 
joy to the bosom of Daniel. 

Good-bye ; may you be blessed of the Lord.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Salisbury, January 26, 1801. 

WHY, brother Fuller, what should induce you to present to 
me such a request, at this time ? Surely, if you knew my situation you would not think me able to write a letter all in rhyme. 
I have been, for many days, shut up in my room, and am just 
now creeping from the clutches of a fever. The Muses, you 
know, are not often seen hovering round the bed of an invalid ; 
like other females, they wish only to familiarize 

" with swains of limbs robust, 



" And vigor unabating." 

Thus, friend Habijah, I have a very good reason for apologizing and soliciting a release from the task. But I am very 
seriously impressed with a sense of your situation ; accustomed 
from infancy to the communion of the Parnassides, and encouraged and cherished in all those habits which attach you to their 
society, a discontinuance of their intercourse at so unexpected 
a period must very sensibly diminish your enjoyment. Influenced by these feelings, dear Chevalier, I am induced to address 
the prayer of a valetudinarian on your behalf to the throne of 
their highnesses, the Parnassides. 

Ye Muses! Say, for what black crime unknown, 

Ye stay your influence from your darling son ! 

What direful causes, as old Maro sings, 

Of all his troubles are the fruitful springs ? 

What nymph, offended at his labored grace, 

Eludes his arms, and shuns his chaste embrace ? 

What star malignant o'er his birthday hung, 

And froze the streams, just rolling from his tongue ? 

Or what drear comet spreads infectious fires, 

And seals the lips, that poetry inspires ? 

Has some proud nymph, of our terrestrial Jdnd, 

Shot poisoned arrows thro' his sickening mind ? 

Has Mary, vastly knowing of her charms, 

Set on the dogs, and warned him from her arms ? 

A sad mishap ! But such as oft takes place, 

None hold possession long in Mary's grace. 

Is this the cause why all his lines, that rose 

To flowery rhyme, now sink to lazy prose ? 

Is this the cause why now he hangs his head, 

Nods in his school, and sleepless turns in bed ? 

If this the cause, the Muses 1 acquit, 

And you, Friend Fuller, you shall have a bit 

Of my advice. The Muses are not blamed, 

If, by some earthly goddess more inflamed, 

You leave their glorious service, and engage, 

With nymphs terrestrial, Venus' s wars to wage. 

Aonian maids despise to share your heart ; 

Give us the whole, they cry, or not a part. 

But if, O Muses, if some other cause, 

Has lost your son protection from your laws, 

For him I intercede. If e'er my prayers 

Arose as welcome offerings to your ears, 

If e'er I eulogized your powers divine, 

Or sketched your glories in the sounding line, 

If e'er you bore me on your fleety wings 
To where your chorus tune their lyric strings, 
If e'er I knew you on Parnassus's height, 
Bedecked with pearls and strewed with living light, 
Hear my request, who now before you bend, 
Hear my request ; for once forgive my friend ! 
If he has told too much of lies, or truth, 
Forgive it, as the foible of his youth. 
Whate'er his crime, forgive, forgive this once, 
Nor call him more a blockhead nor a dunce. 
Now, mighty Muses, to your favor take him, 
Nor thus, with unrelenting heart, forsake him ! 

I have labored thro' my petition. It is undoubtedly a very 
fine sample of poetry ; I shall not and have not read it over. 
As my ill health prevented my visiting at Commencement, I 
sent your letter by a safe hand. I was to set out for Boston 
this day, had I been in health. J. Wheelock called on me 
yesterday, and made one of the family to church. I did not 
perceive that the severity of the weather had lessened the longitude of his nose. 

I have had but one ride since I arrived here, which was to 

Boscawen. Saw Miss , &c. Miss O., I am told, is very 

sick ; possibly she now is departing into a world of spirits, pure 
and lovely as her own. There can be no danger in avowing 
a passion after its object has ceased to exist. If ever I had a 
wish; but what am I saying? I leave the subject; were I 
writing a system of Philosophy I should digress into the vale of 
feelings ; but I am abrupt and impertinent. Pardon me for the 
ideas I have suggested. 

I am, dear Weld, your affectionate, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 

Respects to Mr. Davis and lady, your friends et cetera. 
Good night ; sleep sound.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, June 14, 1801. T.'s Office. 

DEAR HERVEY, My first business is to inquire about Si 
monds ; O, that I could be assured he were recovering ; but 
perhaps that is a happiness never to be allowed us. Let our 
prayers ascend together for his well-being, whether with us or in 
another world. If there be any possible method of communication, pray let me hear how he is. 

I have next to tell you that I am in no inconsiderable consternation. About ten minutes ago friend Gilbert and I were 
taking a walk a few rods down street, when we perceived a 
chaise, containing a gentleman and lady, the latter of whom we 
concluded looked very well, while at a distance; judge my 
surprise, when I saw, as the carriage passed me, that its fair 
inhabitant was no other than SALLY ! The chaise drove so fast 
I only had time to bow and blush, and receive a smile and a 
look as the carriage passed on. 

I hoped she would stop at the tavern, but no. On inquiring 
of my father, I found the gentleman to be a young major, by the 
name of Hale. 

So Sally you see is gone ; yes, gone ! gone ! I was going to 
Concord to-morrow, but . . .

DEAR HERVEY, I can find no other method of writing to my 
Hervey, than by the circuitous journey which our friend Hutchinson proposes to take. He is now here, on his way to N. 
Ipswich, and on his return home will lodge this at Charleston. 
I am now settled down in the office, where I expect to obtain a 
smattering of law knowledge. With me is Mr. Abbott, whom I mentioned to you at Commencement. If any one could fill 
the place vacated by your absence, it is he. 

Company, other than what occasionally falls into the office, 
we have none. This you might conclude from the situation of 
the place. My present business is the perusal of Vattel on 
National Law. I expect next to review Burlamaqui and Montesquieu, and to read Hume, before I commence an inquiry into 
the principles of municipal and common law. 

Thus am I. Now, pray, how are you ? What law-shop, what 
divinity-closet, or what medical chamber confines you ? I presume, however, you are not yet engaged in either, but I apprehend you are thinking about something. 

Mr. Green, the attorney at Concord, communicated a wish to 
me, that I would give his compliments to some respectable 
young gentleman, and inform him that he expects soon to be in 
want of a clerk, and that any gentleman of character and promise, who may feel disposed to read in his office, shall be entitled 
to his tuition gratis. Mr. Green is a respectable law character, 
and his reputation as a private gentleman, no one, as I know, 
impeaches. Board at Concord is easily to be obtained on reasonable terms. 

Now I would not advise, but suggest a few considerations. 
It is not to be doubted that you can obtain more information in 
four years, with the deduction of three months from every year, 
than by three years' continued application. That is, if in those 
said three months you are able to read law, when not in school. 
At Concord, you could undoubtedly obtain employment three 
months in each year, and the amount for your wages for this 
time would pay your board the other nine months. 

Concord is a pleasant village. Mr. McFarland, Mr. Flag, 
and others, would unite with you in harmony of sound and harmony of sentiment. The town library affords a field of miscellaneous reading, and, another source of improvement, the ladies 
of Concord are very learned. 

If it be an observation of weight, that in the event of your 
living there we should meet often, I submit it. 

Duty to Mr. Green obliged me to mention his proposals, in 
the first instance, to the best man I knew, and my own feelings 
urge me to address the request to you with particular earnestness. 
I have not heard from Hanover since I left. I hope the best 
things for them all, philosophy, divinity, &c. 

Give my regards to your good father, Captain Minor, Doctor 
Merrill, and all friends, and believe me ever to be yours, 

DAN'L WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, September 22, 1801. 

BROTHER HERVEY, I yesterday opened the packet which 
contained your letter, with a mixture of hope and fear, anxiety 
and indifference. As it came by way of Hanover, I suspected 
it might be a communication from that place, replete with 
groans and despondency, which, however I pity, I cannot relieve. 
But when I perceived it bore the marks of your penmanship, I 
confess in honesty, that I felt more exultation of spirit than has 
been my allotment since I saw you last. 

I have been fixing on a time to visit you ever since Commencement, but the uncertainty of finding you has kept me 
from attempting it. 

I am sure you must read with pleasure and advantage in Mr, 
West's office, if you should conclude upon it, as I hope you 
will, if you do not see fit to come down nearer us. 

I have precipitated myself into an office, with how much 
prudence I do not now allow myself to reflect. I am not like 
you, harassed with dreams, nor troubled with any waverings of 
inclination ; but am rather sunken in indifference and apathy. 
I have read some since Commencement, learned a little, forgotten a good deal, and should be glad to forget much more. As 
to Coke and Blackstone, whom you mention as my probable 
intimates, " I tender them the homage of my high respects," and 
leave the "tenure of their position undisturbed." With the 
assistance of my first minister, Monsieur Gallatin, formerly called 
Leo, I have dismissed from the office of this life, a few federal 
partridges, pigeons, and squirrels, and have drawn from the 
abundance of Merrimac a few anti-federal fishes, no loaves, 
such as sword-back, perch, and flat-headed demi-semi-crotchetquavers, alias scaly flat-sides. I'll mend pen. 

Thus, you see, I follow the fashion of the great 

There is a disciple of Hume, the skeptic, in the other corner 
of the office, who doubts whether the sun be anything or nothing. 
I shall leave Abbott to convert him from his errors, and go on 
to tell you that I have seen Dr. Gerrish, who had much to interrogate about you, and joined his request to mine that you would 
come to Concord if agreeable to your interest. 

Sanbornton folks are as usual. Andrew does business as fast 
as ever, and every week calls at the office. I must have some 
dinner. 

I expect to meet many disappointments in the prosecution of 
the law. I find I have calculated too largely on the profession. 

For this reason I have engaged a new auxiliary to support 
me under mortification ; it is tobacco. I have heard much of 
philosophical fortitude, but never knew what it was, unless it be 
a sullen unfeelingness, a cold temper, or inhuman heart. But 
tobacco inspires courage of another kind, deliberate, yet immovable; affectionate and feeling, yet despising danger. Since I 
have used this great catholicon, I suspect that Cato and John 
Rogers were not unacquainted with the virtues of the goodly 
leaf; else whence derived they their firmness? Oh! tobacco, 
how many hearts hast thou saved from the destructions of 
coquetry ! How many throats of bankrupts hast thou preserved 
from their own penknives ! 

Come, then, tobacco, new-found friend, 
Come, and thy suppliant attend 

In each dull, lonely hour ; 
And though misfortunes lie around, 
Thicker than hailstones on the ground, 

I'll rest upon thy power. 
Then, while the coxcomb pert and proud, 
The politician learned and loud, 

Keep one eternal clack, 
I'll tread where silent nature smiles, 
Where solitude our woes beguiles, 

And chew thee, dear tobac. 

If you will write me immediately, dear Hervey, and inform 
me where I shall find you, I will set out in the course of a few 
weeks. I would not ride forty miles to see anybody living but 
yourself ; but since 'tis you, I will do it gladly. I have a thousand things to talk about beside my tobacco. College still has 
its impressions. My thoughts will look back to Hanover now 
and then, but as they cannot contemplate you there, they turn 
back dissatisfied. Ezekiel sets out next week for the place of 
his residence. I shall send the Carey letters by him to Hanover, 
where he will put them in the mail. 

Lemuel is reading divinity at Boscawen with Mr. Wood, 
and is the only one of our class I have seen since the valedictory 
day. You will see the propriety of apologizing as much as 
possible for the sterility of Commencement. Tell people it is 
because they discouraged genius. 

I hope to squeeze your hand soon ; till when I have no other 
enjoyment than books afford, together with the society of my 
second Hervey, Abbott, and Mr. Thompson, who, when he 
relaxes from business, which he prosecutes with unwearied attention, is entertaining and instructive. 

Good-bye, Jemmy; you may guess, but I cannot tell, how 
much happiness is wished you by 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Look, I really have written this illegibly and inaccurately. Pray let no one see it, for though it is shameful to be 
under the necessity of such a request, I am unwilling to be 
exposed. Present me to your parents and friends with respect.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. COFFIN. 

Salisbury, October 3, 1801. 

DEAR SIR, You will have the goodness to pardon me for not 
sending you a catalogue by Mr. Whitmore ; he left so abruptly, 
that it was out of my power. I now enclose you two, and wish 
you much entertainment in the perusal. 

I fell into a law office, pretty much by casualty, after Commencement, where I am at present. Considering how long I 
must read, prospects are not very flattering, but perhaps I may 
find room hereafter in some wilderness, where the violet has not 

resigned her tenement, to make writs without disturbance of 
rivals, if there should be nobody to purchase. 

Our Commencement was not so long in exercises as is usual. 
I hope, however, the audience accepted what was performed 
well. Lyman, it is said, gave a good Philosophic. The Valedictory was thought decent. The Forensic and Dialogue were 
not so argumentative and amusing; the other performances 
were in unknown tongues. 

Our class are much inclined to the law, but I believe we have 
all mistaken our talents. We have those that might be good 
divines, and perhaps eminent physicians. But, in honesty, it is 
not my opinion that any individual has brilliancy, and at the 
same time penetration and judgment enough, for a great law 
character. 

Present me, if you will, to Mrs. and Mr. Mellen ; to friends 
Charles, Noyes, &c., and assure yourself of the esteem of 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

P. S. Please give me an account of the business I left at 
your office. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, October 26, 1801. 

BINGHAM, and Bingham forever ! There is a kind of magic 
in your pen ; I know not how it is, but if you write in a language perfectly unknown, you afford me more pleasure than a 
well-penned and intelligible letter from a common friend. Of 
all folks in the world I should last think of flattering you ; but, 
in honesty, I knew not how closely our feelings were interwoven ; had no idea how hard it would be to live apart, when 
the hope of living together again no longer existed. However it 
may be thought rebellion against nature, I must confess, if I 
were this day to embark for Europe, my regret at leaving any 
other person would not be greater than at leaving you. You 
rnay judge therefore, whether your letters are not acceptable. 

1 rejoice most heartily to learn that you are settled so agreeably. Charlestown must be a pleasant place. Though your 
cousin Solon be absent, yet you will, no doubt, find friends. I 
agree with you, that Mr. Hale is one of the best "fraters" So 
far as I know him, I highly respect him. 

Report speaks extremely well of Mr. West ; representing him 
as the oracle of the law, in Cheshire County. The only objection I ever heard against him, is his unwillingness to enter into 
public employment, at a period when the perverse nature of the 
times renders his talents and character necessary. You must, 
I think, make proficiency with him ; if I judge from your progress hitherto, you will take your leave of me soon. You have 
actually read almost as much law as I, though you have been 
at it not half so long. I was reading Shakespeare, when I 
received your letter, but soon laid him by, and took up Blackstone. 

Mr. Thompson has gone to Boston, Mr. Abbott to Salem, 
and I am in consequence alone, and shall be probably for some 
weeks. I have made some few writs, and am now about to 
bring an action of trespass for breaking a violin. The owner 
of the violin was at a husking, where " His jarring concord, and 
his discord dulcet " were making the girls skip over the husks 
as nimbly as Virgil's Camilla over the tops of the corn, till an 
old surly creature caught his fiddle and broke it against the 
wall. For the sake of having plump witnesses, the plaintiff 
will summon all the girls to attend the trial at Concord. 

If the Funeral Oration be thought decent, I am contented ; 
equal to the subject it is not. The death of Simonds was a 
theme on which the first writers ought to be proud to point 
their pens. " Hei mihi ! Qualis erat ! " I know not how many 
times I have been asked, whether you were not to read law in 
this quarter. A lady observed, she should be very well pleased 
to have Mr. B. in the office. Surely she would not be more 
pleased than I. My old friend Harper is expected here soon, to 
finish his reading. A rich acquisition to the gallantry of our 
office. The scarcity of company here renders it impossible to 
spend time pleasantly abroad ; for entertainment, I betake myself to Mr. T.'s belles-lettres library, which affords a pretty variety 
of reading. How Mr. Harper will relish our amusements is not 
to be told ; I wish he may be 'pleased. 

Friend Lemy is at Mr. Wood's, reading the best of all professions. He certainly has gained cent, per cent, the last year. 
Campbell went to Concord after Commencement, and rode 

round with Miss Abbott ; he 's gone ! Cupid has bored his heart 
through like a sieve. Doctor Gridley is really doing well ; he 
thinks you neglect him in not writing to him. 

" Powerful," indeed, is our representation to Congress. 
Goodrich, Granger, Edwards, step ye aside ! I have not heard 
a word from F. Hunt ; nor from Herbert. Am alarmed at intelligence from Clarke; he is said to be declining visibly ! Brackett, 
I believe, is in good health . . . 

Afternoon. The most unpleasant information I have yet to 
communicate. The " state of things " renders it highly doubtful 
whether I stay in this office two weeks ! I certainly shall not 
under present circumstances. My father sets out on a journey 
next week, the issue of which will determine me. It mortifies 
me, beyond expression, to relinquish my study at this period ; 
but I cannot, cannot help it! Necessity is unrelenting and 
imperious. If I should leave this place, I look to the Province 
of Maine for residence ; or perhaps Salem. Am I to run Carey's 
race ? O ! O ! Dear Hervey, how changeable is fortune ! 
Seven weeks ago I was fixed, and you wavering ; now you are 
settled, and I probably on the point of removing. I never was 
half so much dispirited as now. Though I make myself easy 
as I can, yet I am really very unpleasantly circumstanced. 
Well, I owe submission to the awards of Providence. I will 
submit. I must see you before I go, if I should go, for probably 
I shall not meet you again very soon. 

I look with great anxiety to the termination of next week. 
May it be successful ! ! Good-bye, James, may mercy take care 
of you. Accept all the tenderness I have. 

D. WEBSTER. 

Mr. Thompson is made Trustee of Dartmouth College. 

Doctor Gerrish is anxious to see you. Of nobody he talks so 
much when I see him. I tell him you will no doubt visit Sanbornton in the winter, and we calculate on having a good interview. But I am resolved to see you before winter, else, perhaps, 
I shall see you not at all. Lovejoy is happy as a churchman 
with his new little wife. All the rest of Sanbornton is just as 
you left it. Doctor G. lives in his own house ; has taken in a 
family. 

I thank you for your receipt for greasing boots. Have this 
VOL. i. 9 
afternoon to ride to the South road, and in truth my boots admit not only water, but peas and gravel-stones. I wish I had 
better ones. As for my new " friend tobacco," he is like most 
of that name ; has made me twice sick and is now dismissed. 

Heigho ! A man wants a remedy against his neighbor, whose 
lips were found damage feasant on his, the plaintiff's, wife's 
cheek ! What is to be done ? But you have not read the law 
about kissing. I will write for advice and direction to Barrister 
Fuller. 

N. B. Let no one know that I think of quitting these realms. 

Write often, my best friend, for these conveniences of correspondence may not last long. As you once told me, " write 
soon, write very soon, write now ! "

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, December 8, 1801. 

MY BEST FRIEND, Some few days since I received your letter dated October 30. What accident retarded it so long I know 
not, but I was almost afraid that you had forgotten to write 
me. Perhaps it was detained at Hanover, though I could wish 
it to hurry through that place as fast as possible. When I wrote 
you last, I had little expectation of writing you again from this 
place. Having found myself at home after Commencement, I 
found on consideration, that it would be impossible for my 
father, under existing circumstances, to continue Ezekiel at college. Drained of all his little income by the expenses of my 
education thus far, and broken down in his exertions by some 
ever lamented family occurrences, I saw he could not afford 
Ezekiel means to live abroad with ease and independence, and 
I knew too well the evils of penury to wish him to stay half beggared at college. I thought it therefore my duty to suffer some 
delay in my profession, for the sake of serving my elder brother, 
and was making a little interest in some places to the eastward, 
for an employment. My father, however, determined, if possible, 
to hire a few hundreds, till future days, being very averse to my 
leaving him. He accordingly rode to Exeter, told his Excellency
of the state of affairs, and the good Governor helped him to 
what he wanted, on reasonable terms. This was much more 
favorable than I expected, and I have now hopes of continuing 
here for the present. Scarcely five miles absent from this place 
have I been since Commencement. I defer all short visits, till 
I can put them together, and make them reach Charlestown. 
You say I must be there in May ; but I say I must see you 
before that time. I will not consent to your propositions, if 
they put our meeting so far forward. Ezekiel tells me you have 
been at Hanover. Well, what did you see and hear ? I think 
I can answer myself. You saw Nabby and heard Wisdom sing. 
Did the girls all smile on you ? Did Weld rejoice to see you ? 
Did Shattuck reach out slowly an honest hand ? Did Merrill call 
to see you, and did good Sir * * *, with a hypocritical smile, and 
a bishop's bow, say, " How do you, Mr. Bingham?" and falsely 
add, " I'm glad to see you ? " All this, I make no doubt, took 
place. Hammond picked a bone with me at Thanksgiving; 
there is an honesty about him I always loved, though it is 
sometimes quite unaccommodating to squeamish stomachs. He 
tells me that the U. F. are full in all their cases, times, and 
modes, while the Socials gaudent vocative, which, you know, 
is almost always wanting. I fear Hammond is in a labyrinth 
of entanglements. Mary, la bonne, I suspect, sends her heart 
after him wherever he goes. If there were to be a new 
edition of human nature, I think it would be found expedient 
to give the girls stronger ribs and a thicker pericardium. I say 
a plague to the girls, if they cant keep their little beaters at 
home. 

The only news I hear, is the marriage of our classmate 
Taylor ! Can you believe it, it staggers my conceptions absolutely. Methinks I can this moment see the good man, in his 
usual altitude, addressing his mate, and with clerical gestures 
breathing out the pathos of the English Iliad, thro' " hems " 
and " hahs." 

" Andromache my soul's far better pa-part ! ! " 

The day of his marriage he thinks, no doubt, the first of his 
happiness ; the language of Milton will aptly apply, 
" All Heaven 

And happy constellations on that hour 
Shed their selectest influence ! " 



Freeborn called and spent four or five days with me lately ; 
he is now at Hanover with Dr. Smith. Noyes is keeping 
school, school, school. Bliss is reading divinity with Mr. 
Wood. 

Since Gideon became Postmaster- General, Mr. Thompson is 
uncertain about his continuance in the deputy post-office. He 
is acquainted with Gideon, and thinks it a good time to see 
whether democratic rage is stronger than every other principle. 
But I think Gideon will oust him, for there are several gentlemen this way, who are heirs in expectancy and reversion, and 
they will make every endeavor to get it for themselves, as they 
suppose, poor souls, that an office which affords eight or ten 
dollars per annum, will make them rich ! 

I have read Robertson, Vattel, and three volumes of Blackstone, and a little miscellaneous stuff of no account. I hope to 
go on more rapidly now, for I feel more at ease than I have 
done heretofore. My old and good friend, Harper, is with us. 
I presume he will give us an oration on the 28th instant, on 
Free Masonry. No doubt he will be eloquent and impressive, 
and though anti-masonic Robison were now groaning in Tartarus, the flashes of Harper's genius would enlighten his black 
atmosphere, and dart truth and conviction into the recesses of 
Pluto's kingdom ! ! 

Mr. Abbott is my only inmate ; he is good and friendly, and 
I shall sincerely lament the hour that takes him from the office. 
I wish you knew him ; you would surely respect him. 

Do write me every time you think you can afford it. I wish 
to write often, very often, for your letters to me I prize at the 
value of a " cow and calf." 

Depend on it, I will see you the first visit I make, and depend, 
too, that I ever shall esteem you, 



" My true and honorable friend, 
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops 
That visit my sad heart." 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Postscript. I see no ladies ; they are scarce articles with us. 
The Damas are all at Charlestown. Do give my love to some 
of them, for you know my heart always overflows with affection 
for the sex. Where do you board ? Will you write me next 
mail? 

Do you hear from C. ? Tell me about him if so. Give my 
best respects to your honored father, Captain Minor, &c. 

Good-bye, Good Boy. D. w. 

" Ireland's Hogarth " I know would delight me. Painting 
and statuary are arts of which I have very imperfect conceptions. Poetry I have read and music have heard, but the 
speaking canvas and the breathing marble are not familiar to 
me. If I can, I will tarry with you long enough to peruse it, 
Have you read Cowper's piece on Conversation ? You will 
find it in his first volume of poems, and I promise you pay for 
reading it. It snowed some last night, I rejoice to see it 
How innocent Madam Nature looks with such a zone about 
her! Is it not prettier than the red ribbons of our Misses ? Red 
is a bloody color ; I like it not.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

SINCE, friend Habijah, you are thus distrest, 
Since Love's fierce tortures thus inflame your breast, 
Since * * * 's charms forever haunt your dreams, 
And her fair form before you always seems, 
A little poetry, perhaps, might roll 
Love's boiling torrent from your troubled soul. 

I too, with Muses straying thro' the grove, 
May soothe my pains, though not the pains of love. 
For those blest fields, where Love's gay Graces reign, 
I once have tried, and tried, alas ! in vain. 
No longer on those verdant banks I tread, 
No longer wander o'er the flowery mead ; 

Those fragrant lawns of Love, which you explore, 
I once, perhaps, have known, but know no more. 

Come then, together let us beat the field, 
Where Arts and Science their best laurels yield, 
Together let us climb the ethereal height, 
Where Freedom's flambeaux shed a living light ! 
To sing Columbia, then, shall be our care, 
Her arts, her arms, her heroes, and her fair. 
Columbia, hail ! Thy glories fire my song, 
Thy worth deserves, to thee the bays belong I 
See Science glow within thy peaceful realm, 
See her bright blaze old ignorance overwhelm ! 
See yon proud dome now register her name ! 
See Dartmouth blazon the bright rolls of fame ! 
Columbia's arms, too, soon shall awe the world, 
And kings and tyrants from their thrones be hurled, 
Her every hero shall a Eugene prove, 
And bow to no one, but the thundering Jove. 
Her fair now rival Argos's nymphs divine, 
Though all her daughters, not like * * shine, 
For when she gently rolls that sparkling eye, 
When her soft bosom heaves the tender sigh, 
Not Venus' self to Paris did appear 
Half so divine, so lovely, or so fair ! !

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Fryeburg, February 25, 1802. 

MY GOOD HERVEY, The date of this will inform you where 
I am. Yes, James, I am at Fryeburg. I came here six weeks 
ago, and took charge of the Academy. My engagements are 
for two quarters, and the probability is I shall then leave here. 
It is quite an object with me to put myself into some urbanic 
place, the time I am out of study. Nothing here is unpleasant ; 

there is a pretty little society. The people treat me with kindness, and I have the fortune to find myself in a very good 
family. I see little female company, but that is an item with 
which I can conveniently enough dispense. Your old acquaintance, Mrs. Dana, lives next door, I am frequently there ; they 
live in a neat, handsome, sociable style. Nabby is somewhat 
expected here soon ; Mr. and Mrs. Dana are now gone to 
Hanover, and will wish her to return with them. O, Bingham ! 
But a schoolmaster must not sigh. Having said so much 
about myself, I will next talk of you. You are not noted, that 
I know of, for paying your devoirs to that uncertain gossip 
caUed Fame ; yet the creature, through some unaccountable 
fancy, seems disposed to treat you with caresses. Mr. Hutchins 
from Concord was here lately, and told me the proprietors of 
their public school had determined to write you a pressing 
invitation to accept the instruction of it. I gave him no encouragement, for I thought you in better business, but told him 
you were the man, if they could obtain you. If you should go, 
you will find every attention. H. is attempting to instruct 
there in music, and has rendered himself absolutely ridiculous. 
His Jacobinism has increased his infamy, for having written a 
frothy, silly, senseless, ungrammatical, misspelt letter to some 
of his democratical friends, it, perchance, got into the columns 
of the Courier, and was fine sport for our brother-students who 
live in that quarter. 

Billings is keeping school at Sanbornton; he boards with 
Lovejoy. I was there on my way hither, and pressed Phoebe's 
hand, and inquired if she thought Mr. Billings a clever man ; 
she said he was not clever like Mr. Bingham. I told her there 
were different ways of being clever; she smiled significantly, 
and was silent. 

I have heard nothing from Hanover, since Zeke left it. He 
had just arrived at Salisbury when I set out for Fryeburg. 
* * * * wrote me that she was going to Connecticut. I wish her 
every blessing, but cannot tell what may arise hereafter. I 
don't know but my happiness must be sacrificed to hers. She 
said you had a letter for me, and intimated strongly that she 
wished me to see it. You may, if you please, put it into the 
mail, and direct to me at Fryeburg. 

Solon, I fear, is shut out of business. The judiciary bill is 
knocked on the head. Smith will probably return to the bar. 
" This is a land of Liberty, and the Constitution." Huzza ! 

Do write me the very next mail, and add one more to that 
long chain of obligations, which bind to your bosom your everlasting friend, 

D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Fryeburg, February 26, 1802, 
ONCE more to prattle on her darling theme, 
Once more to wake the soft mellifluous stream, 
That brings us all our blessings as it flows, 
Whose currents Friendship's golden ore disclose, 

The Muse essays her little skill ; 

And tho' her lightsome lay, 

No master's hand display, 
Tho' loose her lyre and wild her song, 
Though Seraph fire tip not her tongue, 
The friend Oh ! such a friend will hear her still. 
O Memory ! thou Protean friend, or foe, 
Parent of half our joy, and half our woe ! 
Thou dost the rapture which I feel impart, 
And thou the griefs that press around my heart ; 

Thine is a motley train ; 

Despondence there is seen, 

And Sorrow, palefaced queen ; 
And Gladness there, with merry face, 
That ne'er did wear a sad grimace, 
And buxom Pleasure sporting o'er the plain. 



Next moment, lo ! Appears 

Some plenteous cause of tears ; 

Some pleasure fled, for pleasure flies, 

Or Symonds, sped beyond the skies, 

And memory cancels all the good she grants 

But if I poetize further upon Memory^ I shall not have room 

to tell you half what I wish. So sweet Miss Muse, we will 
dismiss you. 

Friend Shattuck may have told you that I am here. 'Tis 
true, Habijah, contrary to all my expectations I am here. I cannot now address you as a brother-student in law, I am neither 
more nor less than a schoolmaster, and as such you will not, 
perhaps, feel yourself much flattered to hear from me. You 
will naturally enough inquire what circumstances have induced 
me to relinquish the law. I will answer all your questions when 
I see you next. Till then be satisfied with this, that I thought 
it best. Six weeks I have been on this ground ; in about five 
or six months, it is not improbable I shall leave it. Which way 

my next motion will be, it is not to be told or known. 

********** 

I have been writing some poetry. I shall not inform you 
what I have written, but, from the accompanying inimitable 
apostrophe to memory, you will judge of the quality of all I 
have written. 

You will possibly wish to ask how many Misses there are 
here. I do not precisely know. I forgot to bring a stick, to cut 
a notch, like the Indian, for every one I see ; but I have heard 
no complaint of scarcity. There is one who is amiable, and 
who has this moment passed by this table. 'Tis her opinion, 
it seems, that " Mr. Webster is a very bashful man." He will 
never give her reason to think otherwise. But these things are 
all vanity. I was last at Concord in September or October. I 
can tell nothing about your friends there. Our visit in June is 
blown over, but you must go without me ; you will have a better visit. 

If it will not be burdensome, pray write me a word, I mean 
a good many words, by Esquire Dana. I want to hear a good 
deal about old Han. Pray be particular and long in your 
account of that place. Whatever you can make acceptable to 
your family, whether love, respects, or compliments, pray give 
them from me. Brother Shattuck is entitled to a high place in 
my memory, and tell him he possesses it. I cannot tell when I 
may see you, but if I live and have health, I shall expect to dart 
an eye upon the I. C. School as soon as next Commencement, 
surely and without fail. D. WEBSTER. 
How are your parents, your sisters, your friends. In short, 
how is every thing ? And, above all, are you the Newsboy's 
message-maker? Who is Bum? Do answer all these things, and 
oblige THE SCHOOLMASTER. 

Mr. Dana is the only neighbor I call on with great pleasure 
and little ceremony. I have exalted ideas of his lady. I can 
say with Shakespeare, that she is one " who paragons description and wild fame." 

Mr. Dana is quite good and civil . . . Have you heard from 
Bing. Gil. Nye, or any other of our friends ? Clark, Bracket, 
and Her. ?

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Salisbury, May 3, 1802. 

FRIEND FULLER, If you had not offered an excuse, still as it 
is, your long silence had been forgiven you. That fancy that 
roams in " orbs beyond Herschel," hardly stoops to the humbler 
sphere of friendship and correspondence; and while we are 
pleased with its flights, we must excuse any neglect it occasions. 
Really, it pleases me to see you on the Muses' wing again, and 
I must be allowed to say that Telephus's Ode to Washington 
hath in it some true relish of the Parnassian waters. I hope you 
will find Maine more suited to poetry than I did ; although I 
rattled in as many as twenty rhymes while in that Province. 
These, you know, are a pretty large number for me. To be 
serious, if you find it convenient, I would earnestly advise you 
to cultivate any propensity to poetry which you may possess. 
I do the same by myself, not from any wish to show my 
productions to the world, but for amusement, and to keep alive 
some taste for the belles-lettres. The law is certainly, as seems 
to me, rather hard study, and to mollify it with some literary 
amusements I should think profitable. 

Hanoverians, you perceive, ever searching for novelty, have 
started the project of a Literary Tablet. How do you think it 
will succeed? My own expectations are not, I confess, very 
sanguine. The repeated failures of such attempts forebode dis
aster to the Tablet. However, I wish it well. Do you calculate 
on becoming a writer for it ? Say, honestly. If such a thing 
should commence, suppose we take some little pains to start up 
some of our classmates now scattered over the world's wide 
wilderness, to hold a friendly chit-chat together in the columns 
of the paper ? Will it do, or are we all too great dunces to write 
a paragraph? I have another whim in my head which may 
prevent me, otherwise I would be willing, in conjunction 
with my friends, to make one serious effort to render the Tablet 
respectable. 

Your " excellent society of ladies " is almost enviable. If the 
" Beauties of the West " will not compare with them, I am sure 
you will never be able to resist. Ere this, I could warrant, you 
are gone, gone hook and line, and love betide you ! It is true, 
as you say, that there is prospect of all the Hanover Ribs being 
sold before you and I can become purchasers. How do you 
think it would do to forestall the market, and, for the sake of 
security, to bespeak a Rib in season ? Hah, hah, hah. 

I am now in expectation of making a visit to old Hanover at 
Commencement, if I can learn that any choice friends will be 
there. Do you expect to attend ? I hope you will. Pray let 
me know soon if you shall be at Commencement, as my determination is not to go unless I can understand that my friends 

will be there.

Yours, dear Fuller, very sincerely, 

DANIEL WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Fryeburg, May 18, 1802. 

"DEARLY BELOVED, Suffer me to bespeak your attention for 
about six hours, to the volume I am about to write to you. 
Having just rambled to the adjacent intervals, which on account of the late rains are all overflowed, and exhibiting almost 
a " shoreless ocean," I set myself down by the parlor fire to improve a moderate degree of health and spirits, in addressing 
almost the earliest friend I have on earth. I have a good many 
things to talk about, and am not disposed to curtail the conversation. Since I wrote you before, I have been within forty miles 
of you ; but stay, I am too far forward. About three weeks 
ago we had our semi-annual exhibition. The performances of the 
school were such, I believe, as gave satisfaction to the Trustees. 
In truth, I was not much ashamed of their appearance. The 
Trustees were pleased to pass a vote of thanks, as also to present 
their preceptor a small extraordinary gratuity. Following exhibition was a vacation of 2 weeks. Forgive me for writing in 
figures. I shall be glad if I can find paper for all I have to say 
to you, without stating my ideas by Algebra. This vacation 
I had devoted to the reading of Sallust, but on the day of Exhibition I had a letter informing me that l Zeke ' was very sick at 
college. I had heard also that a young man at Salisbury, who 
was just about marrying my oldest sister, was on the verge of 
death, and had expressed very particular and urgent reasons for 
seeing me once more. Under these circumstances I immediately 
set out for New Hampshire. I went directly to Hanover, where 
I found my brother on the recovery, though much out of sorts. 
There also I saw Fanny and kissed her, nobody else. She was 
in decent health when I first saw her, but was taken with the 
cramp the night I arrived. I said but little to her. I also saw 
Sophia ; the palpitation at her heart will not, I fear, suffer her 
to be a great while company for us mortals. She has frequently, 
you know, been charged with having palpitations of that organ, 
but I think she has one attached to her now that may produce 
greater evils than any preceding one. I had not opportunity to 
chat with her save in company. Mary Woodward I shook by 
the hand, and was treated by her with more respect than that 
family have ever before shown me. Tenney was there ; he had 
a hard time with the measles, though some thought the measles 
had the hardest time. I met with Merrill ; we have agreed to 
correspond. He mentioned with much satisfaction some letters 
he had received from you. I said " Yes, Sir " to Shattuck, 
winked at Fuller, and shook hands with Freeborn, and drank an 
Indian health with Hammond, Cooke, &c. Nabby was at 
Woodstock. I saw her not, yet I think I looked that way to 
see about the weather. Being so near, I wished beyond expression to ride to that place where my Hervey lives ; but the vacation was so short I could at most have tarried but one night, 

which would have been tantalizing to my feelings. I therefore 
adjourned it till September, when I expect to leave this place, 
and when, if it please Providence to preserve me, I shall spend 
a week with you, certainly, certainly. 

When I reached Salisbury, I found that the young man whom 
I mentioned in the first page of this document, had been dead 
several days. To the last he appeared oppressed with something he would reveal to no one living but myself, and that 
opportunity never occurred. What this was, I cannot conjecture ; it might be something important, and it might be a 
whim of a sick man's fancy. If he had done me any injury for 
which he wished forgiveness, God knows I heartily forgive him. 
Peace to him ! 

I saw our classmate, Noyes, in Concord ; a brother pedagogue. 
The Hon. Sirs. Merrill, Noyes, and Webster I would have 
called, from their profession, Messrs. " Syncope," " Verbum Personale," and " Nominative Gaudent ; " these would be pompous 
and sonorous names, significant of the high honors we bear, 
being clothed, like Mr. Jefferson, " in the mantle of our country's 
confidence." By the way, if the mantle of public confidence be 
such a robe as I consider his Excellency wearing, it would be 
my preference to wander about like the prophets of old, in 
sheep-skins and goat-skins ; but we shall talk more of politics in 
the next volume. I will go right on with my story, 

" And jog on steady by the road," 
" Nor wander into episode." 

I spent a few days at Salisbury, and thence took my departure again for this place. Had a pleasant journey, save the 
inconvenience which arose from bad roads and bad taverns. I 
came to one innkeeper's by name Knight. From his appearance I thought he could be no Knight of the * Garter,' or of the 
Bath, but because I was much annoyed by a creature that stood 
in the corner, I put him down for a Knight of the Blue 
Dyepot. 

I arrived here last night ; but must fill this page by relating a 
little anecdote that happened yesterday. I accidentally fell in 
with one of my scholars, on his return to the academy. He 
was mounted on the ugliest horse I ever saw or heard of, except 
u Sancho Panza's " pacer. As I had two horses with me, I 
VOL. i. 10 
proposed to him to ride one of them, and tie his bag fast to his 
Bucephalus ; he did accordingly, and turned her forward, where 
her odd appearance, indescribable gait, and frequent stumblings, 
afforded us constant amusement. At length we approached 
Saco River, a very wide, deep, and rapid stream, when this satire 
on the animal creation, as if to revenge herself on us for our 
sarcasms, plunged into the river, then very high by the freshet, 
and was wafted down the current like a bag of oats ! I could 
scarcely sit on my horse for laughter. I am apt to laugh at the 
vexations of my friends. The fellow, who was of my own age, 
and my room-mate, half checked the current, by oaths as big as 
lobsters, and the old Rosinante, who was all the while much at 
her ease, floated up among the willows far below on the opposite 
shore. 

END OF THE FIRST VOLUME. 

P. S. I am now going in to see Mrs. Dana ; when I return, 
I will go about the remainder of the work. 

VOLUME II. 

I will in this volume, my dear Hervey, give you some account 
of my circumstances, feelings, and prospects. The salary afforded me is three hundred and fifty dollars exclusive ; board is 
one dollar and seventy-five cents ; this is my academic engagement. Fortune, like other females, does not always frown. My 
landlord is Register ; and as he is extensively in business I do 
the writing of his office ; this is a little decent perquisite. If I 
will tarry, the Board will increase my salary, and do every thing 
for me in their power. A compensation annually of five or six 
hundred dollars, a house to live in, a piece of land to cultivate, 
and, inter nos solos, a clerkship of the Common Pleas, are now 
probably within the reach and possession of your friend, D. W. 

What shall I do ? Shall I say " Yes, Gentlemen," and sit 
down here to spend my days in a kind of comfortable privacy, 
or shall I relinquish these prospects, and enter into a profession 
where my feelings will be constantly harrowed by objects either 
of dishonesty or misfortune ; where my living must be squeezed 
from penury, (for rich folks seldom go to law,) and my moral 
principle continually be at hazard ? I agree with you that the 
law is well calculated to draw forth the powers of the mind, but 
what are its effects on the heart ; are they equally propitious ? 
Does it inspire benevolence and awake tenderness ; or does it, 
by a frequent repetition of wretched objects, blunt sensibility 
and stifle the still, small voice of mercy ? 

The talent with which Heaven has intrusted me is small, very 
small, yet I feel responsible for the use of it, and am not willing 
to pervert it to purposes reproachful or unjust, nor to hide it, like 
the slothful servant, in a napkin. 

Now, I will enumerate the inducements that draw me towards 
the law. First and principally, it is my father's wish. He 
does not dictate, it is true, but how much short of dictation is 
the mere wish of a parent, whose labors of life are wasted on 
favors to his children ? Even the delicacy with which this wish 
is expressed, gives it more effect than it would have in the form 
of a command. Secondly, my friends generally wish it. They 
are urgent and pressing. My father even offers me I will 
some time tell you what and Mr. Thompson offers my tuition 
gratis, and to relinquish his stand to me. 

On the whole, I imagine I shall make one more trial in the 
ensuing autumn. If I prosecute the profession, I pray God to 
fortify me against its temptations. To the winds I dismiss 
those light hopes of eminence which ambition inspired and 
vanity fostered. To be " honest, to be capable, to be faithful " 
to my client and my conscience, I earnestly hope will be my 
first endeavor. I believe you, my worthy boy, when you tell me 
what are your intentions. I have long known and long loved 
the honesty of your heart. But let us not rely too much on 
ourselves ; let us look to some less fallible guide, to direct us 
among the temptations that surround us. 

Good-night ; to-morrow I will finish this. How pleasant 
would be this eve, if I could chat it away with J. H. B. 

Wednesday Morning. In politics, my friend, we coincide in 
sentiment. With you I believe that the present administration 
cannot long be popular. Our Constitution has left, it is true, a 
wide field for the exertions of democratic intrigue, while it has 
strongly fortified against executive encroachments ; this is the 
general nature and construction of governments perfectly free. 
They are much better secured against tyranny than against 
licentiousness. Yet it has been said with as much truth as 
eloquence, that " the thunderbolt of despotism is not more fatal 
to public liberty, than the earthquake of popular commotion." 
It would be a phenomenon in history, it would be like a comet 
which appears but once in a hundred centuries, if there should 
be found a government advancing to despotism by regular and 
progressive encroachment. The path to despotism leads through 
the mire and dirt of uncontrolled democracy. When this government falls, it will owe its destruction to some administration 
that sets out in its career with much adulation to the sovereign 
people, much profession of economy and reform, and it will 
then proceed to prostrate the fairest institutions of government 
by the pretext of saving expense, but really for the sake of destroying constitutional checks. 

The late Congress have done wonders ; they, however, have 
greater wonders to perform, if they can convince the people of 
America universally that they have done right. The business 
of destruction has progressed charmingly, and its effects have 
been felt. Bayard, Morris, and Tracy have produced a change 
in the public sentiment which will continue. The nation, I 
hope in Heaven, will awake to some view of her situation. Boston and New York have determined to return to their first love ; 
the commercial interest will follow them, and we shall have an 
" opening to better times." This Commonwealth, you see, continues strong in the service and in the faith. Federal characters 
have bestirred themselves; if I may be allowed a play upon 
words, they have turned out strong, to keep in Strong. 1 

Every advice I have from you gives me pleasure ; pleasure it 
is indeed to hear that you are rapidly progressing in knowledge 
and reputation, almost the only things worth living for. I learnt 
at Hanover that your situation was very pleasant at Charlestown ; that your virtues had secured you friends and admirers, 
and that your industry was proverbial. I find you are leaving 
the friends of your youth in the background ; but remember, 
Jemmy, we will not suffer you to run away with all the reputation without a contest. 

I shall occasionally address you a volume through the summer, and am happy in the opportunity which this affords me of 
expressing my eternal attachment, to my dearest J. H. B.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PORTER. 

Fryeburg, June 4, 1802. 

HEALTH to my friends ! began my earliest song, 
Health to my friends ! my latest shall prolong, 
Nor health alone be four more blessings thine, 
Cash and the Fair one, Friendship and the Nine. 
Are these too little ? Dost thou pant for fame ? 
Give him ye Powers the bubble of a name ! 
Ask all of Heaven an honest man should dare, 
And Heaven will grant it, if it hear my prayer. 
'Tis true, let Locke deny it to the last, 
Man has three beings, Present, Future, Past, 
We are, we were, we shall be ; this contains 
The field of all our pleasures and our pains. 
Enjoyment makes the present hour its own, 
And Hope looks forward into worlds unknown ; 
While backward turn'd, our thoughts incessant stray 
And mid the fairy forms of memory play. 
Say, does the present ill afflict thee more, 
Than that impending o'er a future hour ? 
Or does this moment's blessing more delight, 
Than hope's gay vision fluttering in thy sight ? 
Call now the events of former years to view, 
And live in fancy all thy life anew. 
Do not the things that many years ago, 
Gave woe or joy, now give thee joy or woe ? 
In this review, as former times pass by, 
Dost thou not laugh again, or weep or sigh ? 
Dost thou not change, as changing scenes advance, 
Mourn with a friend, or frolic at the dance ? 
Think when thy worth attracted SIMONDS first, 
And with new sorrow give him to the dust ? 
With present time thus Hope and Memory join, 
This to bear back, and that to extend the line, 
And all must own, except some learned dunce, 
That every man lives three times and at once. 
I'll state a case ; but Vanity, the elf, 
Obliges me to state it of myself. 
10* 
In latitude some more than forty-three, 

And longitude, say seventy-first degree, 

Where Saco rolls, (a name so rough and fierce 

It frights the Muse to bring it into verse,) 

Tied to my school, like cuckold to his wife, 

Whom God knows he'd be rid of, runs my life. 

Six hours to yonder little dome a day, 

The rest to books, to friendship, and my tea ; 

And now and then, as varying fancies choose, 

To trifle with young Mary, or the Muse. 

This life, tho' pleasant of its kind, is yet 

Much too inactive, I'm resolved to quit. 

Now Spring comes on, her milder sceptre wields, 

And fairly fights stern Winter from our fields. 

Yon grassy glade with gaudiest tulip dressed, 

Where the Muse wanders " willing to be pressed," 

Where " Doves " gay frolicking on ulmar " boughs " 

Force one to instant rhyme, of " Loves " and " Vows," 

Would be delightful, were that thing called mind 

Pleased with the present and to fate resigned ; 

But on the soul if wild ambition seize, 

Farewell, as Horace sings, I think, to peace ! 

Our college life, whate'er the proud may say, 

To our existence is the month of May. 

O then I knew not, or I felt not, care ; 

Thoughts, free as nature, and as light as air. 

Yet even then, ingratitude how base ! 

We thought we lived in quite a piteous case, 

E'en then we deemed our fates were much to blame, 

And called Miss Fortune many a saucy name, 

Though life's gay stream ran dimpling all along, 

Smooth as the numbers of a tuneful song. 

There we had friends enough, and books a score, 

Appointments some and disappointments more ; 

Could court the Muse and as you know dispense, 

For pretty little rhymes, with all our sense. 

Could sit down sociable as mother Bunch, 

And " dip in sentiment," or " dip in punch" 

May Heaven forgive the man who with all these 

Cannot find cause enough to be at ease ! 

God gave me pride I thank him ; if he choose, 

To give me what shall make that pride of use, 

Chance and the talent, I'll adore his Will ; 

If he deny them, I'll adore it still. 

Now Hope leans forward on Life's slender line, 

Shows me a doctor, lawyer, or divine, 

Ardent springs forward to the distant goal, 

But indecision clogs the eager soul. 

Heaven bless my friend, and when he marks his way, 

And takes his bearings o'er life's troubled sea, 

In that important moment may he find 

Choice and his friends and duty all combined ! 

And Heaven grant me, whatever luck betide, 

Be fame or fortune given or denied, 

Some cordial friend to meet my warm desire, 

Honest as John and good as Nehemiah.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PORTER. 

DEAR JOHN, Since writing the within I had the pleasure of 
yours by Mr. Hall. You are truly very good to remember an 
old friend in absence, and the date of this will inform you that 
I was not behind you. I rejoice to hear that F. is in a way to 
recover ; she seems to be a peculiar mark for the arrows of affliction. 'Tis true, as you say, that misfortunes fall on the most 
worthy, and that' they fall in crowds : " Woes cluster, rare are 
solitary woes." There is no doubt design in all this, whether 
we perceive it or not. The reason you assign I think not a 
wild one. Mr. Bingham's death gave me a momentary surprise. 
I would mingle with the family on this occasion whatever their 
feeling is, or should be. 

Federalism, it seems, revives. 'Tis a good cause, and it must 
prevail. It unites in its support more than two thirds of the 
talent, the character, and the property of the nation. This is too 
much for any administration to contend with. I congratulate 
you on choosing Merrill : he certainly should have received my 
vote had I been on the ground. 

My best love to Nehemiah, I shall write next opportunity ; read 
the enclosed and deliver. Adieu. D. W.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Fryeburg, June 7, 1802. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I have frequently taken up my pen to 
write to you since I arrived here, and have as often laid it down 
again without executing my purpose. The truth is, I was willing to write you something a little better than my correspondents generally have the fortune to receive. But, after all, I am 
commencing in my old way, resolved not to delay tilt chance 
might inspire me with an idea worth your reading, lest you 
should suppose me backward in entering into a correspondence, 
which I contemplate with pleasure. 

You must therefore console yourself with reflecting that correspondence is a kind of commerce, where the greatest gain per 
cent, uniformly attaches to the greatest capital, and that there is 
as much to be learned in writing a good letter, as in reading 
one. Besides, you will remember that I am in Pequawket, a 
most savage name, and you will therefore suppose a most savage 
country. Whenever, therefore, I am dull and blundering you 
must not charge the fault upon me, but upon Pequawket ; thus 
I shall shift much responsibility from my own shoulders. I 
will, if you please, devote this to giving you some little account 
of my situation, business, amusements, and so forth ; and beg 
of you a description of yours. Whatever relates to my school 
you can guess in the general, and particulars cannot be interesting. This village is new but growing, already much crowded 
with merchants, doctors, and lawyers. There are here a good 
number of men of information and conversable manners, whom 
I visit without ceremony, and chat with as I should with you 
and Bingham. Among these are Mr. Dana, whom you know, 
and Mr. McGaw, who boards and lodges with me. 

Fame has told me, though she is said to be a notorious liar, 
that you are a finished gallant ; it will be natural therefore for 
you to inquire about the number and beauty of our Misses. 

In point of beauty, I do not feel competent to decide. I cannot calculate the precise value of a dimple, nor estimate the 
charms of an eyebrow, yet I see nothing repulsive in the appearance of Maine Misses. When Mr. McGaw told me he would 
introduce me to the Pequawket constellation, it sounded so 

oddly, that I could not tell whether he was going to show me 
Virgo, or Ursa major. Yet I had charity to put it down for the 
former, and have found no reason to alter my decision. Being 
a pedagogue and having many of the ladies in school, I cannot 
set out in a bold progress of gallantry, though I now and then 
make one of them my best bows and say a few things piano, as 
the musicians have it. 

When I go into the study of a friend, I look about and inquire 
for the books he is reading ; to save you that trouble, I will tell 
you my reading at present. I think it may be advantageous 
to communicate mutually an account of our studies, and reciprocate any new ideas that are worth it. I am now upon Williams's Vermont, which I never read before. 'Tis my object to 
investigate some facts relating to the political history of the 
United States. 

I have been perusing, as an amusement, the " Pursuits of 
Literature," the book which has excited so much curiosity 
among the learned, and called down so much condemnation of 
democracy. I am not certain you ever read it, because I do not 
recollect having seen it at Hanover. I think it well worth a 
reading. The scantiness of the Poem itself, and the abundance 
of Notes, bring to my memory Sheridan's elegant metaphor of 
" a neat rivulet of text meandering thro' a meadow of margin.". . . 

Report has just reached me that the marshal of N. H. is 
removed. I confess I did not much expect it, but these are Jefferson's doings, and they are marvellous in our eyes. 

Adieu, my good friend. D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I congratulate the people of Hanover on the election 
of their anniversary orator ; and wish him better success than 
some of his predecessors. 

Wednesday Morning, June 9. Since I wrote the within, which 
I had intended for the mail, Messrs. Hall and Whitmore have 
called on me. I am quite sure you did not know of the opportunity of sending me by them. They tell me that Politics stand 
120 to 14 ; good, good. The sun is everywhere rising. The 
waning orb of democracy must soon be eclipsed. The penumbra begins to come on already. 

Pray put a line in next mail, for one who is much your friend.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Fryeburg, June 11, 1802. 

MY DEAR BOY, I hope you will not be vexed at me, when I 
tell you that I was a little vexed at you for not transmitting a 
word by Mr. Hall. I could not invent for you the least excuse, 
and was resolved to be silent in my turn. Last night, however, 
after tea, I lighted my cigar and took a turn among the meadows. Nature was all smiling, and by a kind of sympathy she 
drew me in to laugh with her, and my resentments all went off 
in fume ; so this morning, about the time when you are hearing 
the prayer-bell with great composure, I am devoting a moment 
to my own, and I hope, to a friend's amusement. Were I a 
devotee to Cupid, I should improve this morning in penning 
something which I have heard called a love-letter. A romantic 
imagination might find, as I think, ample scope among meadows and dales, and "moss-crowned banks," and "purling rills," 
and " songsters of the grove," and " morning breezes," and other 
apparatus of love-poetry. How unfortunate, that I neither am, 
nor can feign myself to be, in love with some Dulcinea of such 
beauty as " paragon's description," such charms as force mankind 
to " worship where they dare not love," of such dignity and command in her aspect, and such unaffected modesty and reserve, 
that even " her shadow dare not follow her, when she goes to 
dress ! " All these pretty sayings, picked up at the expense of 
so much time, must all be useless for lack of some one to address them to. Alas ! Alas ! 

********** 

Did you reveal any thing I told you of * * * * ? If so, I am 
almost sorry, but forgive you. 

Pray put a line in next mail for your old, your cordial friend, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Distribute my love to whomever will receive it 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Fryeburg, July 22, 1802. 

LOVELY BOY, When one has nothing to say you would 
think he might as well be silent. But you know there are folks 
whose words are in inverse proportion to the ideas they convey. 
If I could write you one concise, elegant letter, which met my 
ideas of perfection, I would be mute for a season with great 
willingness ; but I find myself obliged to send one written messenger to apologize for a former, and in this way am never like 
to be out of business. Some ten weeks ago, as I should think, 
I did myself the honor to address to you a huge folio, the 
longest I ever wrote, which is saying a good deal; and the 
dullest too, I fear, which is saying much more. I am suspicious 
you did not receive it, as it went by private hand, and as you 
never have answered it; to have answered it methodically, 
would be like a comment on the Law of Nations, yet you 
would certainly have notified me of the receipt of it. Your last 
letter, which I have received, was dated early in April. One, 
two, three, almost four months since ! a vast while truly. Yet 
it proves that you are agreeably employed ; for if you are at all 
like me, when " grief sits heavy at the heart," friends will occupy 
the next place. 

Friday r , 23. Since writing the above that " urbanic and extended figure," A. Alden has called, and spent a day with us. 
He possesses, I find, a " mind not to be changed by time nor 
place," and bating some extravagant eccentricities, would be an 
amusing fellow. He tells me that Mrs. Bingham is about 
removing to Oxford, since the death of her husbandman. I 
lately received a letter with this indifferent and insensible postscript, " Mr. Bingham is dead." It instantly struck me. that . . . 
and I was chilled to petrifaction ; God be praised, I could otherwise account for the postscript ! 

Augustus informs me, that the 5th of July was kept with 
rejoicing, and that friend Merrill delivered an oration well calculated to " magnify the federal cause and make it honorable." 
I have engaged him, " the said Merrill," in a correspondence, for 
I think him a worthy fellow, and almost the only S. R, who 
possesses any liberality of mind ; though those pious folks would 



be very angry at me for saying so. By the way, Daniel Abbott 
writes me that he has been at Charlestown ; that he saw and 
instantly knew you; that he shall no longer distrust physiognomy, and that you parted under agreement of correspondence. 
I rejoice if my name has been the means of introducing two of 
the best men in the world to each other. I would indeed give 
rny pipe and its contents to see you together this lovely morning, 
before school, and that is more than I would do to see half the 
people in the world together. The hours devoted to the effusions of the heart are to me the most dear. In participation of 
sentiment and feeling, emotions of a tender and pleasing kind 
are excited ; and the rhetoric of the eye and the hand puts me 
in rhapsodies sooner than that of Cicero or Chatham. " One 
may as well not be, as be " and be alone in the midst of society, 
devoted to himself, and excluded by suspicious jealousies from 
the bosom of others. 

With much pleasure I observe the name of your worthy father 
on the list of Federal representatives this year. The Jacobins 
in the middle of the State had calculated with confidence, as I 
found when I was there, upon having a legislature after their 
own image. They were drunk with joy at the prospect ; but 
the gentlemen may now " put a little water to their wine." 

As to our friends, I can tell you but little. I correspond with 
few, and others I know nothing of. Brackett writes me that he 
is well situated at Rhinebeck, on Hudson River. He humorously 
informs me how he has been caught in the lure of an Albany 
hen-ess, like a pheasant in a snare. We ought, I think, to wish 
him, rather than her, a safe delivery. Clark informs me that he 
is still at Flushing, easy and contented, " living on the fat of 
the land." From Hanover I hear as often as the old gentleman 
Zek. sees fit to write to me, and now and then, though very seldom, I have a line from somebody else. And now, having 
modestly enough spent the bulk of three pages in talking about 
myself, I will reserve this space for a postscript, to acknowledge 
as I hope the receipt of one from you by the mail which is 
expected soon. 

Good-bye, give your father the best respects of 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

P. S. Well, the mail comes, but no wished-for letter. Yet 
Hervey will think of me soon and let me know it. 



DANIEL WEBSTER. 

I have seen a letter from Portsmouth, which informs me that 
J. Wentworth, the democratic lawyer and ode-maker, has had a 
most severe flagellation from Jere. Mason, Esq., for personal 
abuse, and another from the editor of The Oracle. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

I CANNOT read ; to think is as bad ; I will therefore write, 
though it be 

Sunday, August 29, 1802. 

DEAR CHEVALIER, A handkerchief hoops my head, the bed 
supports my legs, and the table my arms. In this attitude of 
contemplation, perhaps you will rather think it an attitude of 
sleep, I have consumed three full minutes in thinking of some 
decent excuse for so long neglecting to write you. I despise to 
say, like a lazy collegian, " Unwell, Sir," nor can I say in truth, 
" Didn't hear the bell," since your last letters gave me quite an 
audible call. On the whole, I perceive none in which I shall 
get off with honor, unless I undertake an encomium on taciturnity, and say, that although men arrogantly boast of the privilege 
of speech, it is indeed a much greater privilege to be silent. 
But I think I will not retail the pretty sayings I have on this 
subject; they are better reserved " to decorate the morality of a 
Newspaper Essay." Your letter shall be drawn from my files, 
and answered methodically. Imprimis you referred me to Alden for domestic news. I turned to that authority, and found a 
few pages fertile of the subject ; among the rest that St. John 
paid you an agreeable visit, that you had a pleasant dance, &c. 
Now dancing is a good, and, as I suppose, an innocent amusement, but we never need go to halls and assembly rooms to 
enjoy it. The world is nothing but a contra-dance, and every 
one, volens, nolens, has a part in it. Some are sinking, others 
rising, others balancing, some gradually ascending towards the 
top, others flamingly leading down. Some cast off from Fame 
and Fortune, and some again in a comfortable allemande with 
both. If you should ask me what station I allot myself in this 
dance of life, I should be staggered to tell you, though I believe, 
by some confounded ill-luck, I have slipped a foot, and am 
VOL. i. 11 
fairly on the knee here in Pequawket. In your last letter but 
one, you insinuate that you can hardly write, because a certain 
Miss, had just passed your office. I know not who the said Miss. 
was, but will bet my tobacco-box that I can guess within three. 
It was either Mis-Fortune, or Mis-Information, or Mis- Conduct, 
and which of the three you must inform me. I fear you will 
be so uncharitable as to say the latter. 

I was in Concord nearly a fortnight. A man is known by 
the company he keeps. I shall almost suspect the purity of 
your principles. " I hope," say you of the D.'s daughter, " that 
she has no affectation." I hope so too, but then we may sometimes hope what we do not believe. You add, " I believe her a 
good girl." If I were really her admirer, such a cold sentence 
should cost you a duel ; there is no ' excellent/ * transcendant,' 

' transparent ' in it. 

********** 

Good-bye. I cannot say when I shall see you. 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. You will naturally inquire how I prosper in the article 
of cash ; finely ! finely ! I came here in January with a horse, 
and watch, &c., and a few " rascally counters " in my pocket. 
Was soon obliged to sell my horse and live on the proceeds. 
Still straitened for cash I sold my watch, and made a shift to 
get home, where my friends supplied me with another horse and 
another watch. My horse is sold again, and my watch goes I 
expect this week ; thus you see how I lay up cash. If Cook or 
somebody else does not soon come to relieve me, I shall be so 
rich that I shall be worth just nothing at all. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Salisbury, November 4, 1802. 

Now, Zeke, you will not read half a sentence, no, not one syllable, before you have thoroughly searched this sheet for scrip ; 
but, my word for it, you will find no scrip here. We held a 
sanhedrim this morning on the subject of cash, could not hit 
upon any way to get you any ; just before we went away to 

hang ourselves through disappointment, it came into our heads 
that next week might do. The truth is, father had an execution 
against Hubbard, of N. Chester, for about one hundred dollars ; 
the money was collecting and just ready to drop into the hands 
of the creditors, when Hubbard suddenly died. This, you see, 
stays the execution till the long process of administering is 
completed. 

I have now by me two cents in lawful federal currency ; next 
week I will send them, if they be all ; they will buy a pipe ; 
with a pipe you can smoke ; smoking inspires wisdom ; wisdom 
is allied to fortitude ; from fortitude it is but one step to stoicism ; and stoicism never pants for this world's goods ; so perhaps my two cents, by this process, may put you quite at ease 
about cash. Write me this minute, if you can ; tell me all your 
necessities ; no, not all, a part only, and any thing else you can 
think of to amuse me. 

You may tell Nelson that I forwarded his letters to Gilmanton, next day after my return, and attended to his other 
business. 

The Hon. Mr. Marston has a young son, which, in token of 
past acquaintance, his wife thinks of naming for you. 

We are all here just in the old way, always behind and lacking ; boys digging potatoes with frozen fingers, and girls washing without wood. I shall not stir from the office again this 
winter, that I know of j nor then, unless I go for you. Pray 
attend to the little request about paragraphs, &c. 

I shall depend on you. Soon you will know if or not. 

Good-bye ; be a good child, " mind your books and strive to 
learn." 

D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Saturday, November 6, 1802. 

A WRITER of no inconsiderable note, and one whom you hold 
in very high esteem, has remarked in some of his lucubrations, 
that a student's reading and conversation ought to be intimately 
connected with the subject of his studies. 

Impressed with the justness and propriety of this remark, J 
shall give you a few of my thoughts on Horace. Should they 
discover more pedantry than learning, more ostentation than 
judgment, I must beg you to pardon weaknesses which you 
never felt. I shall not assume the lofty eminence of a critic and 
bid Horace pass in review before me ; but shall only exercise the 
privilege, which every person in the pit may rightly claim, of 
judging the performance of the actors. It may be called ungenerous to judge Horace by our own ideas of excellence ; but 
remember it is not Horace I judge, but his works. If he had 
vices, let them be buried in silence ; I will never call them up. 
In my opinion, his writings ought to be as severely criticized, as 
though they were written but yesterday. No lapse of time will 
justify the licentiousness of his Muse. But it must be acknowledged, that in his works beauties lie scattered with defects, on 
every page, and mingle in every line. We admire his sententious brevity, the effusions of his fancy, and the keenness of his 
wit. We are often disgusted at his praises of Bacchus, of 
Venus, or himself. 

I have given you the above morceau of criticism on purpose 
that it might excite your risibility ; for I believe you have not 
frequent occasions to laugh, while you are reading Blackstone, 
or employed in the good work of filling blanks . . . 

These cold frosty mornings very sensibly inform me, that I 
want a warm great-coat. I wish, Daniel, it might be convenient 
to send me on cloth for one, otherwise I shall be necessitated to 
purchase one here. I do not care what color or what kind of 
cloth it is ; any thing that will keep the frost out. Some kind 
of a shaggy cloth, I think would be cheapest. Deacon Pettengill has written offering me fourteen dollars a month. I believe 
I shall take it. 

Money, Daniel, money. As I was walking down to the office 
after a letter, I happened to find one cent, which is the only 
money I have had since the second day after I came on. It is 
a fact, Dan, that I was called on for a dollar, where I owed it, 
and borrowed it, and have borrowed it four times since, to pay 
those I borrowed of. 

Yours without money, 

E. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Remember me to father, and mother, and all. 

MR. DAVIS TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Hanover, N. H., November 26, 1802. 

HOLD ! Hold ! Friend Webster. Don't buffet me. Don't be too 
hasty ; stay a moment. I tremble to ask you a civil question. 
Your seemingly awful denunciation awaits me. But I can endure a little chastisement. I'll e'en venture to out with my inquiry. 

Will you don't be out of humor, brother Daniel, for I am 
blazing with rage myself at the imposition of last year's Brum I 
say, brother Webster, will you write the Newsboy's Message for 
January, 1803 ? Say yes. I can take no denial. You are acquainted with foreign political and local affairs, of which you have a 
correct view at a single glance. You need not ponder much on 
past occurrences. The transactions of the year, the month, and 
the day, it may be well to note. The President's message will 
come forth before a succeeding message is offered to our patrons. 

Perhaps by this time you are a little twistified : " Stand off, 
Davis, for my whole artillery of execrations shall be levelled 
upon you for this unreasonable attack," says a ruffled mind. 
" I would have thee begone. Seek in the inner temple of Dartmouth." How am I treated ! I have sought but can find none 
to my liking. I want no fungus Federal address, like unto 
last year's. I want a genuinely Federal Address, and you are 
the very person to write it. And this solicitation, Sir, is not 
from me alone; some of our most respectable characters join in 
this request. Please to give me a definitive answer immediately. I shall want the address or message the Saturday 
prior to the first day of January, 1803. I have lately received a 
letter from brother Brackett, which informs me that friend Clark 
was dangerously sick. You will perceive that W. has taken a 
companion in his literary peregrinations. It is conjectured that 
Icarus has flocked with the wild geese and gone South for a 
warmer climate. It is however expected he will return early in 
the spring. For news I refer you to Junior Ezekiel. Esquire 
Everett is candidate for councillor in this county ; Mr. Gilbert 
declines sorry. M. DAVIS. 

NOTE. The poetic address for the Dartmouth Gazette, January 1, 1803, was 
written by Mr. Webster, in compliance with the request contained in the above 
letter, and under the signature of ' Icarus ' Mr. Webster wrote various poetical 
and prose articles for the same paper.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Salisbury, December 21, 1802. 

GOOD FULLER, If your clemency was exhaustible, I should 
expect the bitterness of censure. I deserve it, I own, and will 
explain to you how. Your kind letter was received in its proper 
time, and my eye run over its contents with pleasure. Immediately I prepared an answer, but by unaccountable negligence 
and forgetfulness, it was never put into the mail, and yesterday, 
in tumbling over some old paper, I found said letter snug as 
could be in the desk ! Pretty soon after my arrival from the 
Eastward I went to Hanover, sanguine in the expectation of 
seeing you, among others of my friends. I had heard some 
talks of your intended departure, but I considered them as vox 
et preterea nihil. Alas ! I found it true, you were really, to my 
great astonishment, gone ! I hope and find by your letter, that 
you have mended your situation by the change. Hanover without you, was to me insipid. Yet I was there again about a 
month ago, and a ray of pleasantness shot across it, for Bingham was with me. We galloped over the plain one day. I was 
so busy all day doing nothing, that I did not find time even to 
eat my dinner, much less to chat with gypsies ; for to tell you 
the truth now, I am hungry twice where I am lovesick once. 
Mary W. I saw an instant, but had not the happiness to see 
Excellence itself embodied in the shape of the other Mary. 
Some malignant spirit prevented me this pleasure by breathing 
forgetfulness on my nerves. I forgot to call. 

It is not long since I was at Concord ; we had fine times, 
singing and dancing, and skipping. There were a thousand 
inquiries about you. Really, Weld, you must not let the girls 
break their hearts for you. I asked Miss * * * if she wished to 
see Mr Fuller very much. She said that that that that , 
the Lord knows what she did say. I could not tell. There was 
a No, and a Yes, and a blush, and a smile, and a blush, and so 
you may make what you can of them. Give my love to Ripley ; 
I cannot help entertaining a wayward affection for him though 
he be a democrat. He ought to write me, and I shall very soon 
tell him so. Pray write me immediately, write me now, tell me 
you forgive my carelessness, and then I will cheerfully write 
you again. Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. M. * * * *, Esq., is to be postmaster immediately. You 
say what a fine thing 'tis to be a Jacobin ; I say what a dreadful thing it is to be a Jack-ass. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, December 21, 1802. 

GOOD HERVEY, Lovers, I have heard it said, are apt to write 
with trembling hand. If that circumstance alone be sufficient 
to constitute one, I am as valiant a lover as ever made a vow. 
My hand does indeed tremble, and my brain dances with twice 
as much giddiness as ever. But what would be imputed to 
love, if you were a lady, may now very fairly be ascribed to the 
measles. This ugly disorder attacked me about a fortnight 
since, and has formed a great syncope in my health and happiness. I am now convalescent, as the faculty say, and am today just able to scrawl you this ; if it be very dull, pray do not 
blame me, but the measles ; if you will agree to this, I shall shift 
much responsibility from my own shoulders. 

The information you communicated, I will not call it an 
opinion, was fully anticipated. On reading the statute carefully, 
I found it expressly excepted specialties from its operation ; and 
I find in Blackstone, second volume, on the nature and different 
kinds of deeds, that a bond under seal and sign-manual, is a 
specialty. So in that quarter I have " no loop to hang my hopes 
upon." Here give me leave to pronounce a wise opinion, viz : 
That the best way to study law is in relation to particular points. 
I had read the statute of limitations, I do not know how many 
times, nor how many times more I might have read it among 
others, without discovering that it did not affect a sealed instrument, unless I had looked in reference to that particular inquiry. 
It is very much so, I believe, with history. We read page after 
page, and retaining a slender thread of events, everything else 
glides from the mind about as fast as the eye traces the lines of 
the book. Yet, when we examine a particular occurrence, or 
search after a single date, the impression is permanent, and we 
have added one idea to the stock of real knowledge. 

If you are entertained with politics, I will tell you for your 
amusement, that Mr. Thompson is about to be turned out, as 
the phrase is, from the post-office at this place, to give room to 
Moses Eastman, Esq. The latter gentleman has already received his appointment. 

Make my compliments acceptable, pray do, to your good 
cousins E. and P. I remember with joy and gratitude the kindness and hospitality with which I was treated in the family. 

There is not half room enough left to enumerate all the good 
wishes my heart feels for you. It will save me a deal of trouble 
in this way, if you will only wish at once for everything you 
honestly can, and I will cheerfully " second the motion." 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. This has been delayed so long you will answer it. 
I mean you will write another, for there is nothing in this 
requiring an answer ; you will write me a line, I say, soon, yes, 
immediately, 'twill be better than " puke or pill " to cure me of 
the measles. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Salisbury, January 4, 1803. 

DEAR MERRILL, I think it quite time, don't you? that I 
write you a letter. I thought so yesterday morning, when I 
was within five miles of you, am entirely persuaded of it tonight, when I am not within forty. A letter well, a letter 
should be amusing. Ah me ! A dreadful task that for my brain ! 
So then, I must follow the custom, and put down this sentence 
" Alas ! what shall I say," when indeed I have nothing to say, 
and also this pathetic exclamation, " I can no more," when I 
really can no more. 

Mistaken I am, Tommy, if it do not require some taste as 
well as literature to form a letter, without any particular subject 
which shall gratify a correct scholar. This night I have counted 
over my own qualifications for this business of letter-writing, 
and find them not a little deficient. There are some great embarrassments in the way. Hear one now. The critics tell us 
that a letter, to be interesting, should be a " transcript unaffected 
of the heart." So, then, one has nothing to do, but to sit down 

and transcribe his heart to his correspondent. This copy will 
be, it seems, a charming, entertaining epistle. But lack a-day, 
me ! what can a poor scribbler do, if he happen not to have his 
heart about him ? If now my heart is rambling up and down 
the Connecticut, or, if fixed to some spot there, how in the world 
can I copy it ? But as respects you and the folks that way, it 
is no matter if you have the original among you, surely you can 
well enough do without the copy. Thus you see, I shall cleverly 
be excused from writing you an " entertaining letter." On the 
opposite page I said something about being within five miles 
of you. True, I kept Sabbath at Lebanon, with E. Porter. I 
almost determined to go to Hanover and take a peep at my 
friends, but as my tarry could not have exceeded a few hours, I 
thought it would be mere tantalizing with my feelings. This 
time I did not " a-wooing go," but you may expect very soon 
to see me on a pilgrimage, not however to Mecca, nor Medina. 

To the shrines of dead saints let the pilgrim repair, 
And bend o'er their ashes in praise and in prayer, 
I love living goodness, nor ever shall find, 
A brighter example than glows in her mind, 

whose mind ? you will say ; ah, ah, Mr. Tommy, that is an 
inquiry to puzzle you, and even I had as lief take a problem in 
Euclid to solve as that question. The Lord knows whose mind, 
but 'tis hers. That strain of poetry you will confess to be such 
as might fall from the lip of a true inamorato, and if you will 
only point out somebody to be antecedent for that pronoun 
" her," I will give you a pipe of tobacco. 

This law-reading, Thomas, has no tendency to add the embellishments of literature to a student's acquisitions. Our books 
are written in a hard, didactic style, interspersed on every page 
with the mangled pieces of murdered Latin, and as perfectly 
barren of all elegance as a girl's cheek is of beard ; you see I 
can't keep entirely off the girl's cheeks. The morality of the 
profession is, too, a matter of doubt, or rather it is a matter of 
no doubt at all. Mr. Bennett says that a lawyer, who preserves 
his integrity unspotted, deserves a place in the calendar of 
saints. If this calendar were entirely made up of lawyers, I 
fancy it would be a short, a very short list, not so long, if you 
take the whole world over, as a catalogue of Freshmen, and yet 
this is the profession to which I am devoting myself! O blindness ! stupidity ! infatuation ! nonsense ! folly ! and 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I will, on second thought, take off the edge of the 
above invective against my profession by reminding you that 
there have been a Papinian and a Hale, as eminent for piety as 
for talents, and our late Chief Justice Ellsworth demands a 
mention in company with these ornaments to their profession. 

I regret that my sheet is full, but you must write me, and 
then I shall feel authorized to fill another. Pray do not delay. 

Mr. Granger has removed Mr. Thompson from the post-office 
here and appointed Moses Eastman, Esquire. Now just between you and me, not to let the world hear, it is a dreadful 
thing in these times to be a Jack-ass. They were never in 
greater demand Mum ! 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. COOK. 

Salisbury, January 14, 1803. 

WELL, brother Cook, is it not time that you and I should 
interchange a word by letter ? Indeed, I thought it quite time 
some while ago, and bore on my mind a fresh impression of the 
promise you made me to write, but as yet no letters have 
arrived. But perhaps it is owing to miscarriage in mail. 
Lackaday! Since these Jacobin postmasters have crept into 
office, one cannot for the soul of him, get a letter that never was 
written. 

But I will pardon you j your entire devotion to business 
would render you pardonable, if you should neglect to write 
even to your sweetheart. Don't you suppose now that I must 
be a little envious of the lustre of your pedagogical fame ? A 
priest's word may surely be relied on, but your philosophy would 
hate to hear a compliment. 

It has been twice in the way of business for me to b& at 
Hanover since I saw you. Everybody I saw, and some of the 
ladies particularly, inquired about Mr. Cook ; but here again I 
shall wound your philosophy. Our college friends were in fine 



DANIEL -WEBSTER. 131 

mood, triumphant over their enemies. Bingham, that good 
soul, whose spirit is harmonious as his music, galloped on to 
the plain with me, and we spent a day among the folks. One 
of your female acquaintances is gone, fairly gone, I understand, 
into the land of love and courtship. I do not now tell you who 
it is, nor who is become proprietor in the premises, for certain 
reasons. The authorities were in November very much probably as you left them in August. I could not see any diminution in the length of noses, nor in the volubility of lip-licking 
tongues. Professor Woodward has been entirely out of health, 
as Zeke tells me, all the fall, and Doctor Smith has sold his 
house with an intention to fix his residence in Windsor. 

I am not informed what profession you are determined to study, 
but if it be law, permit me to tell you a little what you must 
expect. My experience in the study is indeed short, but I have 
learnt a little about it. First then, you must bid adieu to all 
hopes of meeting with a single author who pretends to elegance 
of style or sweetness of observation. The language of the law 
is dry, hard, and stubborn as an old maid. Murdered Latin 
bleeds through every page, and if Tully and Virgil could rise 
from their graves, they would soon be at fisticuffs with Coke, 
Hale, and Blackstone, for massacring their language. As to the 
practice, I believe it a settled matter, that the business of an 
office is conducted with the very refuse and remnant of mankind. However, I will not too far abuse my own profession. 
It is sometimes lucrative, and if one can keep up an acquaintance with general literature in the mean time, the law may help 
to invigorate and unfold the powers of the mind. 

By this time you are quite tired of this conversation. Well, 
my friend, then go away and relieve your worry by chatting 
with the fair ones, after which, if you please, sacrifice a moment 
to the unrewarded trouble of writing a line to 

Your very humble servant, 

D. WEBSTER. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, February 22, 1803. 

MY GOOD HERVEY, Yours of January 29, was received in due 
season. I thank you for the expressions of friendship it contained, and for the assurance that a part of your time is devoted 
to me. At this period of our acquaintance I need not tell you 
what pleasure I receive from your letters, nor with what exultation my heart glows under the impression that our early congenial attachments will never be sundered. It may look a little 
like vanity, flattery, and puerility, but I think I may say that 
you will continue to occupy the parlor of my affections, till 
Madam comes ! Madam, you know, must have the parlor, but 
even then you shall not be cast off into the kitchen. Depend on 
it, if Madam treats you, -or anybody else who is an older pro'prietor than herself, with prankish airs, we will soon away with 
her into Lob's pound. 

You solicit my sentiments upon politics. Really, I don't 
know if I have any political sentiments. Kaimes tells us that 
sentiment is something which savors of passion or affection. 
Now I profess not to have the least affection for the men in 
power, for the means by which they obtained it, nor for the use 
they put it to, so I can't say whether I have any political sentiments at all. It is very strange, Bingham, and very true, that 
men do as often as otherwise choose the most ignorant of mankind to instruct, and the most wicked to govern. I feel a good 
deal of interest, perhaps more than I ought, in the termination 
of the ensuing election. Can you help, can I help, can anybody 
of sense help despising mankind, and despising himself for belonging to mankind, if in every instance vice and folly laugh 
virtue and wisdom out of countenance ? With us it is seriously 
fearful that the Senate of our Legislature will be Jacobinical. 
Districts No. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, 8, 9, are some of them undoubtedly democratic, and the rest awfully suspicious. In this district (No. 8,) we send a man, and nobody can tell why we send 
him, unless it be that he is absolutely the greatest dunce in the 
district. From all these evils may the Lord deliver us ! 

Permit me to mingle a sentiment of sorrow with yours for 
the death of your aunt, that worthy woman of whom I have 

often heard you speak, before I had the happiness to see her. 
You will long feel her loss ; you will feel an absence about your 
heart, where there has once been the purest esteem and affection. 
Friends, like all things, may leave us. 

" Year following year steals something every day, 
At last they steal us from ourselves away." 

You mention not having heard from Hanover for some time ; 
I have heard from that place every now and then through the 
winter. Once, since I saw you, I was in sight of the old town ; 
I looked that way and past on. At Lebanon I met with Timothy Heifer ; in two minutes I knew more about the " gestion " 
of Hanover's affairs by half than if I had been reading friend 
Davis's Gazette. Experience Porter spent some days with me 
lately. He has become quite gallant, and told me all about the 
girls, and it all amounted to nothing at all. 

Yesterday I was at Sanbornton, and had the pleasure of hurting myself by being tumbled out of the sleigh into the snow 
with Mrs. Lovejoy. I told them all I was sure you would come 
and see them in June, and they all rejoiced. Pray do not let 
them, nor me, be disappointed. 

When I parted with you, you mentioned, I think, that C 

was at New York, but was expected to come to Lempster to 
take a school. Is he now there ? If so, jog him by the elbow, 
when you see him, and tell him to call to mind D. W. 

Ask your cousin Enos if he recollects any thing about a lad 
that made you a visit, or rather visitation, last fall. If he answers affirmatively, give him my compliments. He appears to 
be one of those frank souls that I am fond of. To be sure you 
must pass an hour now and then very agreeably with your 
cousin P. Does not your generous spirit sometimes feel willing 
to share that happiness with your friends ? Lackaday me ! 
Some of your friends have no pleasure like that, yet they are 
happy enough. D. WEBSTER. 

N. B. I do not much approve the literary taste of your 
Charlestown ladies ! 

P. S. My office-mates, John Doe and Richard Roe, send love 
to you.

MR. BINGHAM TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Charlestown, N. H., April 8, 1803. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Here I am, with the whole office to myself, except that part occupied by the honorable gentlemen of 
the shelf. Mr. West and Mr. Briggs are now attending our 
Common Pleas Court at Keene. Mr. Sumner likewise. Rice 
is also there, waiting his destiny. From this you will naturally 
conclude, that Mr. Foster and myself are the only " law characters " in the place : hem ! hem ! and I think quite enough, without they are better. 

It is in vain, Daniel, to aspire to eminence in law, or any 
other profession in this country. Our fortunes are not adequate. 
The main point, to which our ambition is to be directed, is the 
attainment of a necessary support. Were the sons of America 
perfectly independent ; had they wealth enough to carry them 
through life, without toiling and sweating, to gain a subsistence 
for themselves and families ; then we might see men of eminence and deep learning amongst us ; then would a Locke, a 
Newton, a Shakespeare, and a Milton grace our land, and immortalize our fame in the literary world. Nothing then would 
those who had a mind to devote themselves to study have to 
impede their progress ; nothing to engage their attention, but a 
steady uniform course of literature. It cannot be supposed that 
the natural genius of Europeans is, in any degree, superior to 
that of Americans. Our clime is as favorable as theirs ; our 
constitutions equally sound and rugged. It must, I think, be 
attributed to education ; and this education must be the result 
of fortune and independence. But what signify a few years at 
our infant universities, and that too perhaps half taken up, in 
devising means to procure our maintenance there the other half? 
And admitting that one pass his four years at college, and is 
not troubled with these evils. If he enter the profession of law, 
for instance, it is impossible to keep from his mind the thoughts 
of his future dependence, knowing that his time henceforward 
must be spent in the practice of the science, if he should 
be so lucky as to obtain any, and not in investigating and 
exploring the science itself; and if he have no practice, why 
he has nothing to do, but to change his employment or starve. 

Sad alternative! Well, well, Dan, we have to live this life but 
once, and it ought to be our object, in whatever employment 
we may be engaged, so to conduct as to acquit our consciences, 
and promote the happiness of our fellow-travellers in the journey 
of life. 

I am now perusing Bohun's Institutio Legalis. It is pretty 
tough, and I believe very good. Mr. Sprague used to say, 
" To take up that, is like taking a bull by the horns," and you 
know I am not very stout, therefore I cannot manage it very 
well. 

I hear Mr. Campbell is chosen Register of Deeds for the 
county ; he now lives at Acworth, will probably move to Waipole. I saw Dr. Smith a few moments the other day, who tells 
me he has moved to Cornish, and Freeborn is there with him. 
He is one of those souls in whom goodness abounds. I give 
myself the pleasure to hope that I shall see him soon. I have 
not heard one word from my father since you left me ; so that I 
can tell you nothing about going to Concord in June. If he is 
wiUing and will help me off as I wish, I shall most assuredly 

visit you. L was extremely disappointed at not seeing 

Mr. Webster, and the only consolation appeared to be, " that 
you would call when you come again." Enos is well, and often 
speaks with pleasure of a certain Mr. Webster, " who made me 

a visit last fall," and sends his compliments to him. 

told me a few days since, that when I wrote I might give her 
love to you, if I thought you would accept it. She is a good 
girl if I am not mistaken. 

P. S. Give my love to your office-mates and others. 

Ever yours. 

JAMES H. BINGHAM. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 1 

May 15, 1803. 

DANIEL, It did cut truly and it was the unkindest cut of all. 
I hope we shall not have many more " slices from that loaf." I 
have hastily examined my own resources, and find them inade

quate to the management of such a work. Indeed, I never thought 
them competent. I have now no idea of undertaking the business, I could not afford to do it under two or three dollars a 
number, and Mr. Davis would be unwilling to give, perhaps, as 
many cents. It would be impossible that the editor should 
remain perfectly unknown, and he would be sure to have all the 
odium thrown upon him if it failed, and would receive no praise 
if it succeeded. Do not have an idea that I ever had vanity 
enough to think myself able to conduct such a work. Ascribe 
it to the want of money, which, at that moment, would have 
induced me to undertake any thing. Mr. Cook and Sam. Osgood were on the plain not long since. All well at Fryeburg, 
when they left the place. Sam. has an idea of entering Junior 
at Commencement. I do not know but I should accompany 
Sawyer to Salisbury, if our studies were not so very important, 
studies no less important and interesting than Euclid and Homer. I shall expect to see you here some time this month. I 
may want to see you by that time. Next Wednesday is Sophomore quarter day. Brown has the Latin; Lyman the Greek, 
and Whiting the English oration. 

Good-bye, E. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, May 18, 1803. 

DEAR HERVEY, Yours of April 8 was received at the very 
moment when I wished for it. This is the fortune which attends 
all your letters. At present, I suppose, Charlestown does not 
experience such a paucity of " law characters " as at the date of 
yours. It is a little presumptuous to expect you will find time 
to read this in the middle of a court week ; but I know you to 
be pretty industrious, and to find time for many things. 

The late term in this county was very interesting, as they say, 
for I had not the pleasure to attend. There were more indictments than have been known for a long time ; a sure proof how 
rapidly we advance in perfectibility. Hillsborough, you know, 
is the most democratic county ! 

Russell, the pure printer at Concord, has found it convenient 

to abscond. He happened very unfortunately to be engaged in 
counterfeiting money in Connecticut some years ago, and the 
vindictive tyranny of that Tory State hath pursued him to this 
very hour. His Godwin-taught friends, say, it is abominable to 
punish a citizen for mere misfortunes. Aye ! 

What you have said of the obstacles in the way to eminence 
in this country, hath much truth to support it. But what then ? 
Must we sit down contented in the lowly valley of inferiority ? 
This is a cold, poor, comfortless place. If the hill of difficulties 
be so high we cannot climb over it, yet perhaps we can make 
a shift to creep round it. At all events it is worth the trial. I 
do not soon expect to see in America, a Locke, a Newton, a 
Pope, or a Sir Joshua. But Mansfields and Kenyons, I believe, 
we shall rear in the next age ; and the reason of the difference is 
that eminence will be sought with more ardor in the lucrative 
professions, than in the abstract sciences and the fine arts. 

Lemy Bliss was this way the other day, and has passed into 
Vermont in character of a preacher. Success to him ! 

At present I peruse Hume and Woodeson. Next week I 
expect with all deference and modesty to introduce myself to 
that prince of the laws, Sir Edward Coke. If any difficulty 
arises between him and me, as no doubt there will, my master 
T. is ready to appear in character of umpire. 

The first day of June, about nine o'clock in the morning, I 
shaU see you, I am sure I shall, at Stickney's in Concord. Till 
then, and forever after, good-bye. 

Yours in truth, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. The compliment you communicated, strongly fastens 
on the memory of the heart. Proffer a great share of my love 
in return. 

Mention me to your cousin Enos, whenever you have not 
something better to say to him. D. W.

EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Hanover, May 21, 1803. 

DANIEL, I acknowledged, in my letter by Mr. Sawyer, the 
receipt of the cash you sent me, and for which, if you think 
proper, you will give my thanks to Mr. T. T. 

Though that sum relieved me from many embarrassments, 
yet I assure you my finances are not in the most prosperous 
condition. My note to Pomroy was upwards of forty dollars, 
besides many other bills of minor amount. You hinted to me 
in your last, that I should have some money soon. The very 
suggestion seemed to dispel the gloom that was thickening 
around me. It seemed like a momentary flash that suddenly 
bursts through a night of clouds, or as Young says : 

" So looked, in chaos, the first beam of light." 

You informed me that you were to meet in council at Concord. Whenever you meet, let money be the object of your 
consultation. Mr. Davis no doubt will wish you to write for 
his paper, The Tablet, should he commence its publication. 
But whatever celebrity a newspaper essayist may gain, unless 
accompanied by something more substantial, it will never feed 
or clothe him, it will never buy him a pair of boots or purchase 
a nightcap. I shall send your boots by mail. Since I began 
to write this letter, I have heard something which so agitates 
me, I can neither think nor write. I may let you know what it 
is next Saturday. 

Good-bye and may God bless us. 

E. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Dartmouth College, May 28, 1803. 

DEAR DANIEL, In my last letter I informed you, that a little 
affair had taken place which so discomposed me, that I had 
neither the control of my thoughts nor the command of my pen. 
The little affair was nothing less than the discovery of a plot, 
which had for its object the destruction of the Fraternity, and 

not merely the Fraternity, but the conspirators aimed at the 
abolition of every society in college. With the secrecy of 
Jesuits, they drew up a paper to that effect and used all their 
influence to procure signers. And they were but too successful 
A solitary few only, 

" Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto," 

remained unshaken ; but one in the Freshman class, one in the 
Sophomore class, and three in mine. Many of our best members, however, were absent. By a little exertion, we procured 
more than one fourth, a number sufficient to prevent the alteration of any article in the constitution. The conspirators, driven 
to despair by this measure, and conscious of possessing a large 
majority, made an effort to expel those members who were opposed to them, and then they could alter the constitution, or 
destroy it at their pleasure. Seaver was designated as the first 
victim of their cursed policy. But the attempt failed, and we 
are yet members. I am sorry to tell you that every fellow from 
Salisbury, but myself, enlisted under the banner of the conspirators. The Social Friends witnessed like troubles with ourselves ; but they began at their last meeting a glorious work, 
and may they perfect it. They expelled two, and others will 
have to walk soon. It is but right that the person who raises a 
storm should perish in its ravages. 

This conspiracy, I believe, is unparalleled. It does not resemble that of Brutus, for Caesar was a tyrant, and Brutus an 
" honorable man." It is not like Catiline's, for Catiline himself 
was a saint compared with some of the fellows who plotted this 
scheme. If it has its parallel, it is in the conspiracy of the 
Pazzi against the celebrated Lorenzo the Magnificent. 

At the next meeting is our election. They will carry every 
thing before them. "Well, let them, for the triumphing of the 
wicked is short. You have probably received your boots. If 
they do not suit, you have the liberty of returning them. I wish 
you a good and happy election. 

E. WEBSTER. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Salisbury, July 2, 1803. 

ESQUIRE WELD, Your last kind letter was not answered by 
the next post, as you requested, and for a very good reason. I 
was about going to " the college," and delayed writing, that I 
might give you some account of things there. Well, now you 
are all alive to hear the news, as in due order you shall. I arrived there just as St. John was receiving the compliment of a 
sermon from brother Barber, and an address from brother Wm. 
Woodward. This over, your humble servant had the honor of 

dining with General B.'s daughter S . O ! how deliciously 

the dinner tasted ! Then, after strolling up to college and down 
to brother Davis's, your servant aforesaid, walked down towards 
the bridge to the house of Deacon Fuller, if you recollect where 
it stands. There he found Mr. Preceptor Merrill in the wickedness of a game of backgammon. A cup of tea, however, induced 
him to forbear reproaching them for gambling, and he almost 
wished he could play himself. 

About nine he wandered " unfriended and alone " into the 
ball-room. What a congregation of beauty ! Whose heart but 
must flutter a little at so many pretty faces ? Ah ! here was all 
one's safety ; attention was so much divided, that it could not 
fasten anywhere, and though he " trod among a thousand perils," 
came off unhurt. About eleven I tumbled into bed, at Dewey's, 
with our old friend Campbell, but the witches were so much in 
his head I could not sleep. By the way, Campbell told me he 
is going to Portland in August. Saturday I wasted in troubling 
brother Davis and a few other good folks, and Monday went off 
for Woodstock. I saw some of the nice Vermont folks, and 
Monday returned to Hanover. Tuesday afternoon visited with 
a thousand good people at Deacon Fuller's ; really Weld, bad as 
you are, I should have been glad to see you there, merely because 
it would have been more like old times. On retiring, the possessor of my arm was so preposterous as to say, " Weld is truly 
very sprightly and amiable ! " With all the rhetoric I had, I 
could not beat her out of this foolish idea, and I believe in my 
soul she will carry it to her grave with her. Alas, alas, the perversity of female minds ! As you are now purchasing probably 

in the District of Maine, and will not settle your possessions in 
this State, I wish to bargain with you at Commencement for a 
quitclaim of all right and title, in possession or expectancy, to 
the premises hereafter laid, as I have thought of pitching that 
way. Among sixty Misses in the ball-room I could not discover the paragon, till she was pointed to me. Her features had 
strayed out of my mind in the roll of two years, though youi 
memory, I fancy, is something more tenacious. 

Nabby R. is gone, gone, gone. " Happy the man." 
I will not fail to scold Bingham, as you request, when I write 
to him next. 

You know what will oblige me ; writing immediately to your 
brother student, brother college-mate, brother class-mate, brother 
Frater, brother Adelphian, and friend, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 

N. B. The narrative part of this epistle is equal to the travels 
of Robert Wren. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Salisbury, July 30, 1803. 

FRIEND MERRILL, What kind of punishment you will inflict 
on me for taxing you with this at the present time I cannot say. 
I only know that you are a man of clemency, and shall not 
think myself hardly dealt with, if you do nothing more than 
retaliate. 

In truth, I am solicitous to draw from you a letter, and send 
this very much for that purpose, although you will think it doing 
evil, that good may come, and therefore contrary to sound morality. When I saw you last you talked of writing me soon, 
and I have been " punctual as lover to the moment sworn " in 
my semi-weekly attendance at the post-office, ever since. 

Peter Pindar singeth that " man's thoughts are ever busy, all 
alive," and I believe he singeth truly. My own thoughts, I am 
sure, are the most industrious members of my commonwealth, 
and they travel all around the circuit of the spheres in the little 
space of time in which I am snuffing my candle. In this journey they will sometimes stop at Hanover, as the end of their 
road, merely, I suppose, because you and Zeke live there. I 
dare not suspect any other reason, for sending a flight of the 
mind that way, because he that suspects is in a fair way to be 
convinced. You know what the scripture saith of him that 
doubteth, and, more to my present purpose, you know what the 
poet saith, 

" And you're undone, the fatal shaft has sped, 
If once you doubt whether you love or no," . . . 

These reasons determine me to be convinced that it is only 
on account of my male friends, that I ever think of Hanover. I 
can perfectly see you at this moment, with an aspect half smiling, and half satirical, as you have read above and are now saying, 

" Ah, brother Dan! brother Dan! Mary has caught thee, and 
holds thee fast as the folks did the spirit in " Lob's pound." 
Ha, ha ! Tommy, I wish I could see you, and convince you 
how much you are mistaken. But I believe you must live in 
your prejudice until Commencement, and when brother Herbert 
takes her by the foretop and saith, " Thou art mine," you will 
see how gladly and cheerfully I will part with what I never 
owned. I rejoice at a little bit of news I hear from college, in 
which I think I can trace the marks of your own finger. Zeke 
tells me that H. H. are letters component of P. B. K. Good ! 

I saw our classmate Noyes this week. His orbit of pedagogical fame is very bright. I think they will never consent to 
part with him at Concord. 

Good-bye. As to love and compliments I send no particular 
directions, you know I trust all to your disposal. 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Pardon this valetudinary epistle ; excessive heats you 
know dissipate ideas as well as strength. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 



Salisbury, September 3, 1803. 

IT is something uncertain, brother Jemmy, whether I am indebted to you in the sum of one letter, or you to me ; but I am 

resolved to place it beyond all doubt. The last I had from your 
Honor gave me a good account of the Federalism of your own 
town, Lempster. It is to be hoped, notwithstanding the efforts 
of the redoubtable Mr. Haines, that Lempster will not worship 
idols, as the fashion of many is, at this day, of Jacobinism and 
iniquity, which two words are so closely allied in signification, 
that the latter always follows the former, just as in grammar, 
" the accusative case follows the transitive verb." Friend Flavel 
is yet, in some respects, as appears by the toast he gave, much 
too honest for a democrat. 

I expected somewhat to hear from you from Commencement, 
as I was informed from the sweetest lips on all these plains, as 
I verily believe, although entirely upon credit, that your fair and 
good cousin Mary was to be there, in company with her friend 
Miss Laura Hubbard, and of such a party I concluded your 
philosophy would not restrain you from being one ; if it should, 
thought I, 'tis a very bad philosophy ; worse, much worse, in 
my opinion, than that new species against which our Federal 
clergymen so loudly and justly declaim. But, if Zeke is to be 
believed, you did not show yourself at college. You were perhaps more happy at home ; or perhaps you thought as I did, 
that a dozen dollars would slide out of the pocket in a Commencement jaunt much easier than they would slide in again 
after you got home. This was the exact reason why I was not 
there, for there were some people there whom I much wished to 
see. I flatter myself that none of my friends ever thought me 
greatly absorbed in the sin of avarice, yet I assure you, Jem, that 
in these days of poverty I look on a round dollar, if it be my 
own, with a great deal of complacency. These rascal dollars are 
so necessary to the comfort of life, that next to a fine wife they 
are most essential, and their acquisition an object of prime importance. Oh, Bingham, how blessed it would be to retire with 
a decent, clever bag of Bixes to a pleasant country town, and 
follow one's own inclination without being shackled by the duties 
of a profession ! But this is a dream, and it vanishes soon. 

Zeke says that Bracket gave a poem to the P. B. K. which 
was really dulce, full of the " grit," as Corey used to say. It will 
be printed. I am glad that the New York climate has not corrupted his heart, and turned his head. Say, James, when I am 
to see you here. It seems to me I have some strong claims on 
you for a visit, and shall begin to complain gently if you do 
not perform it soon, very soon ; you know how your promise 
stands. 

Accompanying this is one to good old Corey, send it to him 
when you have an opportunity. Give my compliments, if you 
please, to Mr. Briggs, and my love to Harry, if he is in town ; 
same sort of currency to our Mend Hall ; and last of all, but not 
least of all, present me, in whatever manner will be most acceptable, to your and my friends Polly and Enos. 

I am, Sir, your most dutiful, most obliged, most obsequious, 
most loving, most unworthy, ever grateful, ever affectionate, 
and ever during friend, and humble servant, client, tenant, and 
bondman. 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

October 6, 1803. 

HERVEY, One Joseph "W. Brackett probably handed you an 
urbanic letter from me,' written at Hanover, in which I promised 
to send you soon an epistle, "three feet long," in answer to 
several questions you ask respecting my wanderings to and fro. 
Here then you shall have the three feet. 

And first, my father has an important suit at law pending before the Supreme Court of Vermont. This has frequently called 
me into that realm, in the course of the past summer. Mr. 
Marsh of Woodstock is of counsel to us, wherefore I have made 
him several visits, in arranging the necessary preliminaries to 
trial. This circumstance, I fancy, originated the suggestion that 
I contemplated reading in his office. In reality, I have no such 
idea in my head at present. Heretofore I have been inclined to 
think of Vermont as a place of practice, and as preparatory therefor have thought it possible that I might read a year in that 
State ; but I never carried my views so far as to fix on an office, 
and at this time have no views at all of that kind. 

Secondly. You have heard that I contemplated finishing my 
studies in Massachusetts. There is more foundation for this 
than the other. It is true I have laid many plans to enable myself to be some time in Boston, before I go into practice, but I 

did not know that I had mentioned the circumstance abroad, 
because it is all uncertain. I believe that some acquaintance in 
the capital of New England, would be very useful to us, who 
expect to plant ourselves down as country lawyers. But I cannot control my fortune ; I must follow wherever circumstances 
lead. My going to Boston is therefore much more a matter of 
hope, than of probability ; unless something like a miracle puts 
the means in my hands, I shall not budge from here very soon. 
Depend on it, however, James, that I shall some time avail myself of more advantages than this smoky village affords. But 
when or where you and I know equally well. If my circumstances were like yours, I would by all means pass a six months 
in Boston. The acquaintances you would be likely to form 
there, might help you to much business in the course of life. 
You can pass that time there just as well as not, and I therefore 
advise to it, as far as I ought to advise to any thing. But 
" some men are born with a silver spoon in their mouths, and 
others with a wooden ladle ! " Would not you thank me to 
mend my pen ? 

If you can tell what it is to read Coke in black letter on a 
day too warm for a fire and too cold to be without one, it will 
save me any description of myself. When tired of old Coke, I 
look at Smollett's continuation of Hume's history. The whole 
of my reading, however, does not amount to much. I can hardly 
be called a student at law. The law question that no\V puzzles 
us in this quarter, is whether Bonaparte, when he shall have 
gone to John Bull's palace, and taken hold of the ring of the 
door in the name of seizin of the whole Island, will be such a 
king against whom it will be treason, in an Englishman, to 
fight ? But they may settle this among them ; you and I will 
not give our opinion without a fee ! 

I shall be alone here for three weeks. Why will you not just 
take your horse and gallop down here ? Do come, pray do. 
'Twill take but just a day from your father's. I will tell you 
when you must come. On the 15th instant. I shall be at 
Warner, which is not more than twenty-five miles from Lempster ; come then and find me there will you not be there ? Say 
" aye," do. I shall look for you. 

I am, as I have been time whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, your friend, D. WEBSTER. 
VOL. i. 13 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Salisbury, October 6, 1803. 

DEAR FULLER, The burden of my letters has been so much 
an account of some jaunt, that I have made to Connecticut 
River, that you will ere long suspect me of having particular 
business to transact in that quarter. However, I think I may 
say that I have lately performed the last tour that way, that is 
to be done for some time. Last week I was two days on " the 
plains," and passed them very pleasantly. I was at your 
Mend's ; passed an evening in a large circle at the Printer's, 
where was the Paragon, and M. W., and Sophia, &c. " And 
there were many more, too many for me to name." As I did 
not expect to behold their faces very soon again, I felt much like 
enjoying their enrapturing conversation a few evenings more, 
but it was not very convenient. There I found J. W. Brackett, 
on his way to New York. Jo. means to figure in the world, 
and I say fortune speed him. He is a clever fellow, and if you 
and I had a little of his dash, it would be better for us. The 
world is governed more by appearance than reality, and therefore 
it is fully as necessary to seem to know something, as to know 
it in reality. A perfect character in these respects is he who has 
a good deal of outside with a good deal within, but if one must 
be dispensed with, it is deserving some consideration which is 
most important, the appearance of knowledge, or the reality 
of it. 

There were some fellows at college with us, who were quite 
as much in the " nine holes " respecting cash as you and I. 
These fellows are doing finely, and if we will but aspire, we 
may do finely also. Brackett left college as poor as Phi Beta ; 
he has read his profession under fine advantages, and is now 
able to figure with horse and chaise. Clark has become a 
quaker, associated himself with a rich house in New York, and 
gone to India with good prospects. How well you are doing I 
cannot tell, but I am just as I was, neither poorer nor richer ; 
more studious or less so ; but having a little more ambition to 
court the muse of law, and no desire to court anybody else 
hardly. 

You are pleased to say that it would be agreeable to see me 

on the Kennebec in the course of the year. That is not likely, 
unless I go that way to tarry. The next time I set off, I bid 
farewell to this spot. Pray write me what your circumstances, 
advantages, hopes, and prospects are, whether there be any little 
nook left unoccupied where one might get a living, &c., and, 
where do you intend to plant yourself? 

In answer to all this, write soon, and oblige your friend, 

D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Hanover, October 18, 1803. 

DEAR DANIEL, Having no news to communicate, I must 
have recourse to such thoughts as my studies suggest, to fill up 
my sheet. 

Horace very justly observes that it is pleasant, sometimes, to 
relax the mind and dissipate attention ; and he might have 
added with equal propriety, that it is also useful and requisite ; 
for relaxation from study is as necessary to the mind as rest 
from labor to the body. The strongest intellect cannot bear constant exertion without impairing its faculties. The bow which 
is always kept in tension loses its elasticity. Nor can the bird 
of Jove, though the boldest and strongest in flight, always keep 
upon the wing. Since the mind is not capable of uninterrupted 
exercise, it becomes a matter of great importance to discover 
what will best recreate and strengthen its debilitated powers. 
Here the physicians of the mind, no less than those of the body, 
have differed in their prescriptions. One advises us to frequent 
company; another exhorts us to retire into solitude. Cicero 
tells us that he used to withdraw from the fatigue and bustle of 
the forum, into his closet, and there relax and refresh his wearied 
mind by reading the poetry of Ennius and Archias. Their 
writings must have afforded infinite pleasure to a person of a 
taste so exquisite as was Cicero. He was philosopher enough 
to know that whatever pleases the mind enlivens it ; whatever 
delights, invigorates. Perhaps the poetry of no nation ever 
abounded more in ingenious fiction and agreeable narratives 
than the Latin ; and consequently, none was ever better adapted 
to relieve and renovate the jaded intellect. Unhappily, English 
poetry affords no such amusement. Although it contains every 
thing that is brilliant in imagery, splendid in sentiment, or elegant in diction, yet it wants that gay fancy, that innocent 
humor, which can 

" light up a smile on the aspect of woe." 

Departing from its original intention, which was to please, it 
assumes the austerity of the moralist and indulges in the subtle 
refinements of the metaphysician. The student who resorts 
to poetry, fondly hoping to find something that shall recreate, 
soon discovers that he is reading, in verse, the metaphysics of 
Locke, or the philosophy of Newton. Whether poetry has 
suffered by the change, I presume not to say, but will venture 
to affirm that it is less suited to repair the intellect when weakened by intense application to scientific or abstruse subjects. 
Here, when poetry fails us, we find the advantage of novels, a 
species of writing in which fancy lives, wit sparkles, and sentiment animates. The censure cast upon novels has been as extravagant as undeserving. The commission of almost every 
crime has been ascribed to the perusal of a novel or romance. 
Amid such a variety, that there should be some poor ones, is not 
questioned ; that they frequently produce bad effects, is not disputed. If it be an objection to novels that they may be perverted from their original purpose, the same may be made to 
every kind of writing and to every branch of science. It may be 
urged against natural philosophy and metaphysics. Where did 
Hume and Berkeley learn to live upon ideas but from the study 
of metaphysics ? Where did Herbert, Bolingbroke, and Shaftesbury imbibe their deistical principles but from the study of 
natural philosophy ? These are consequences infinitely more 
injurious to society than that the tear of sensibility should start 
over a tale of fictitious woe, or that compassion should be 
awakened for sorrows that were never felt ; yet no one has ever 
made this a serious objection to the study of metaphysics or 
natural philosophy. The great benefit of novels is, that they 
agreeably entertain, during a vacant hour, and vacant hours 
men must have; that they are better adapted than any other 
kind of writing to restore the powers of the mind, when exhausted ; to regale it, when saddened ; to enliven it, when languid ; to 
strengthen and invigorate it, when weakened. If they are not 

essential to an education, they are not entirely useless. If they 
are not the corner-stone of our intellectual structure, they are 
the minor decorations of the work, which give grace and beauty 
to the whole. They instruct as well as please. Milton w'as 
particularly fond of novels and works of fiction ; and by them 
he sublimated that imagination which so astonishes throughout 
his writings. They are often the convenient medium of imparting moral lessons. Men are peculiarly fond of instruction 
conveyed by fable ; and when the story of a well-written novel 
is plain, its language chaste, and its sentiments pure, a work 
of fiction possessing these qualities and portraying human character with accuracy will ever find readers and ever captivate 
their souls while men remain true to their nature. Here I must 
suspend my remarks for the present. Write soon. 

Yours, as ever, 

E. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Salisbury, November 11, 1803. 

WHETHER you see fit to knight me for a fool or a philosopher is not very material. The characters, I believe, suit me 
about alike. But true it is, I am so much of one or of the other, 
that I was quite able to understand the whole of your letter 
from beginning to end, notwithstanding the modest things you 
are pleased to say about its want of connection. Without a 
compliment, friend Merrill, you have really the art of writing a 
very interesting letter ; either by the choice of your subject, or 
by the management of it, or both, you contrive to engage all my 
attention. Your last was received on a Sunday's noon. It a 
little injured the effect of a good sermon ; but that is a trifle. You 
have confirmed what I have long strongly suspected, and I shall 
have reasons for thanking you for telling me the truth, as it came 
to your knowledge, " without partiality and without hypocrisy." 
So then, Merrill, it is so. It is so absolutely ; I have no doubt 
of it, and every dictate of prudence and propriety enjoins me to 
be silent, and let it be so. But I have heard that Lucan, of old 
time, could not tell how to determine the cause, when the deities 
espoused one side and Cato the other ; and although all the 
13* 
dictates of prudence and propriety be arrayed in argument, if 

be opposed to them, how can I but hesitate ? But I 

do not hesitate, the thing is as good as at an end. It is known 
only to you and me ; when we meet we will drink a toast to the 
power of forgetfulness. You shall agree to forget all the weakness and vanity which this unreserved intimacy has disclosed ; 
and on my part I will promise to forget to forget forget every 
thing. The summer is now over ; its fervors no longer inflame 
the fancy. Winter is at hand ; he is a sober moralist, and will 
doubtless lesson me into moderation, and into hopes not above 
my desert. Philosophy and tobacco, too, beside winter, are fine 
emollients. What I can expel by reflection, and what will go off 
infumo,at the end of my cigar, will leave me little of disappointment and nothing of uneasiness. It is now probable that your 
friend D. W. will much sooner be saying, " May it please your 
honors," and " Gentlemen of the Jury," than " celestial maid," 
and " angelic creature." But although I shall be sufficiently 
satisfied with myself, if I can at any time attract a little attention 
when it is not otherwise directed, and never aspire to be able to 
turn the current into one channel when it is strongly impelled 

in another, yet I still believe that all 's love in this case 

will be lost. My opinion of F. is just what it has been, and it 
is confirmed by hearing that he has been violently in love, since 
he left college, with a lady in Massachusetts, whom he knew, at 
the time, to be engaged. FINIS. 

Enviable was my fortune last week in having Bingham with 
me three days. Seven years' intimacy has made him dear to me ; 
he is like a good old penknife, the longer you have it the 
better it proves, and wears brighter till it wears out. I believe 
he will do better in life than many who figured beyond him in 
the university, because he has a " spirit of detail ; " he is minute 
and particular ; he adjusts trifles, and these trifles compose 
most of the business and the happiness of life. Great events 
happen seldom and affect few ; trifles every moment happen 
to everybody, and though one occurrence of them adds little to 
the happiness or misery of life, yet the sum total of their continual repetition is highly consequential. 

Accuracy and diligence are much more necessary to a lawyer, 
than great comprehension of mind, or brilliancy of talent. His 

business is to refine, define, and split hairs, to look into authorities, and compare cases. A man can never gallop over the fields 
of law on Pegasus, nor fly across them on the wing of oratory. 
If he would stand on terra firma he must descend ; if he would 
be a great lawyer, he must first consent to be only a great drudge. 
Bingham and I passed a unanimous vote that you ought to be 
here with us. What a fine triumviri we should have made ; too 
fine to meet often in these regions. This is modest. 

Compliments to whomever they will pass, and assurances of 
friendship and esteem to yourself sendeth 

Your friend, D. WEBSTER. 

1 hope you have destroyed the letter to J. D. Esquire. Whenever you feel uncommonly lazy and insipid sit down and see if 
you can write a letter as foolish and as full of I's and Me's as 
this. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Salisbury, December, 1803. 

WHAT a fine time to write to Merrill by Capt. Woodward, if 
Merrill had only answered my last! Oh, the rogue, of how 
much happiness has he deprived himself by delay ! For although 
my letter should be a very poor one, it would be received in a 
manner to make it acceptable. Capt. W. would say : " Mr. Merrill, there is at our house a letter for you, will you call ? " So 
after tea Merrill would jog up to Professor W.'s, and being there 
he would pleasantly pass an hour in company with the Queen 
of hearts, that peerless Virgo, with whom, if one might unite 
himself, and thereby become Gemini, he would be the most enviable of all the constellations. 

For his sake then I will away with ceremony, stumble head 
and shoulders into his presence, and salute him. 

DEAR MERRILL, I have more than one, or two, that is to say 
I have three reasons for writing you now, although my last has 
not been answered. The first is, to give you the pleasure in 
the above eloquent soliloquy mentioned ; the second, because 
I do not wish our correspondence to assume an air of formality, 
but that an unexpected epistle may arrive now and then fresh 
and warm 'from the heart ; the third, that, having a little bit of 
leisure, I know not how to employ myself better. 

Virgil says ; you know I always loved Virgil ; I never laid 
him aside for Pope or Peter Pindar, for poetry or politics ; I never 
neglected him to talk about the Muses and Parnassus, and Helicon, and the Pierian Spring, to write learned essays for debating 
clubs or squibs for the newspapers ; and without irony, I never 
put him by, thank Providence, for Martin's Philosophy or Watt's 
Logic ; Virgil says, in the character of ^Eneas, the brave boy who 
bore his father from his burning capital, just as an affectionate 
rat will lug off a decrepit parent from a building in flames ; Virgil says: " Pulchrum inter arma moriri." Yes, Virgil, thou 
speakest sapiently ; it sure is " a pleasant thing to die in arms," 
and, reverently be it spoken, it is a pleasant thing to live so too. 

There, Thomas, this is the essence and quintessence of my 
thoughts upon matrimony ; and much as you read eulogies upon 
that subject, I will bet five pence you never before heard this 
passage of Virgil made use of for that purpose. I am a surprising creature at invention ! ! ! 

John Porter, in his official capacity, has notified me of the 
wishes of the P. B. to write them a poem. If six of the nine 
Muses were to stand at my elbow and promise that, according to 
their best skill and discretion, they would inspire every line, word, 
and syllable, semicolon, and comma, I should not choose to undertake to write a poem. I left making rhymes when I left college ; and as to poetry, I do not know that I ever made any. So 
you must put your heads together and make another, and I hope 
a better choice. If Mr. Everett, of Amherst, could be prevailed 
upon to undertake it, he would do great credit to the society 
and the university. I do wrong to tell you that I have made no 
rhymes since I was graduated. Two great occasions have called 
forth each a wondrous piece of verse ; one, I shall some time 
show you, to make you laugh ; the other, I have put down to 
make you cry ; for, if an author may judge his own works, it is 
by far the most sublime and pathetic I ever wrote. But I must 
disclose the occasion of such a daring effort. On the afternoon 
preceding the evening of a ball, a lady of my acquaintance trod 
upon some sharp tool and cut her foot. On this, my Muse, who 
had slept some years, broke out, " like an Irish rebellion," when 

nobody expected it, and produced the following, which in point 
of sentiment and language, I know you will think equal to any 
thing in Homer ! ! Here it is, read it. 

Rust seize the axe, the hoe, or spade, 
Which in your foot this gash has made ! 
Which cut thro' kid and silk and skin, 
To spill the blood that was within ; 
By which you're forced to creep and crawl, 
Nor frisk and frolic at the ball ! 

But Clara, Clara! were thy heart 
As tender as thy pedal part ; 
From thy sweet lips did love but flow, 
Swift as blood gushes from thy toe, 
So many beaus would not complain 
That all their bows and vows are vain ! 

There, Merrill, is not this Homerican ? Adieu ! 

D. WEBSTER. 

I have not space here to put down all I hear of the popularity 
of a certain friend of mine, nor how he becomes a, tutor without 
ceasing to be a gentleman, a sight I would give more to behold 
than to see the transit of Venus. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, December 23, 1803. 

DEAR HERVEY, I cannot say that your last arrived as soon 
as I looked for it ; for 1 am always looking for your letters ; 
but I had it as soon as I had a right to expect it. Frequent 
letters are not, perhaps, absolutely essential to friendship ; but 
they are the best and most natural consequence of it. You 
and I should certainly be always friends, if we never wrote 
another syllable to each other ; but we should be friends to 
little purpose, if we never mutually contributed any thing to 
soften care and cheer the heart. Your letters have become a 
settled portion of my happiness ; the force of habit is added to 
the force of esteem, and if you should intermit writing for a 
long time, there would be a kind of vacuum in my pleasures 
that I could not handily fill with any thing else. 

I verily believe you had a jaunt in getting home, and was 
really alarmed for you, when you gave the description of your 
dangers among the rocks and hills of Warner and Boscawen ; 
but I recollected that you were snug by the office fire, and, 
though the rocks might tumble, you were safe. Your patience, 
I trust, was as long as the road, and Enos's colt I believe to be 
a match for all the hills between this and " No. 4." As to the 
" amusement and information which you found at Salisbury," 
you speak very complaisantly. You learned, perhaps, a little 
in the shooting way, and you heard an elegant strain of music, 
of a fine morning, from the top of a tree, and played some 
backgammon with Phebe ; these are, I believe, ah 1 the items of 
your "instruction and amusement," and they do not form a 
very long list. But whatever pleasure you received, you certainly conferred much. The squirrels chipper now undisturbed, 
and I shall suffer none to trespass on our ground till you come 
again. 

I have had a letter from Fuller, and one from Freeborn. The 
former can't help saying a little about the girls, and after praising them very judiciously, concludes by saying he sees them 
very seldom. You and I make no such pretensions to philosophy. If I could be more among good girls than I can, I 
should certainly avail myself of the opportunity. I consider 
such company the school of refinement, and quite necessary to 
prevent those roughnesses of temper and manners that a clouted 
student and a man absorbed in business are certain to contract. 
It is not he who spends most hours over his books that is the 
most successful student. It is impossible to keep the mind on 
the stretch forever; it wiU sometimes relax; and though we 
may keep our eyes on our books, it will steal away to easier 
contemplations, and we may run over pages without receiving an idea. I know this is the case with myself, and believe 
it is with others. The true science of life is to mingle amusement and business, so as to make the most of time. " Every 
man," says Johnson, " must sometimes trifle ; and the only question is, whether he shall do it alone or in company ; " whether 

he shall waste his hours in solitary visions and drowsy contemplations, or, mingling in society, partake of that cheerfulness 
and joy that give new energy to the mind, and promise to 
reward exertion with new success. Here is the end of my sermon. Freeborn has gone to the South, I know not how far. 

Zeke is at Sanbornton. He comes home once in a while, sits 
down before the kitchen fire, begins to poke and rattle the andirons ; I know what is coming, and am mute. At length he 
puts his feet into the oven's mouth, places his right eyebrow up 
on his forehead, and begins a very pathetic lecture on the evils 
of poverty. It is like church service ; he does all the talking, 
and I only say, " Amen, amen." 

Your little sister's death, I hope you consider as you ought. 
I have no great opinion of the goodness of that heart, on which 
such things make no impression. Innocent little thing! thou 
hast been a stranger to guilt, and therefore art such to grief. 
Sweet be thy rest ! 'tis the repose of innocence. Respected be 
thy memory ! for thou wert the sister of my friend. 

Give my love to " our folks," and believe me, dear Bingham, 

Yours, affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER. 



A FRAGMENTS 



HAIL, Poesy ! thou nymph of every grace ! 
In form unrivalled, of angelic face ! 
Far brighter beauties on thy brow appear, 
Than Thomson found to deck the rolling year ; 
More dulcet nectar gathers on thy lip, 
Than Virgil's Gods of old were wont to sip. 
Who can resist thine all-subduing charms ? 
Heaven in thy smiles, Elysium in thine arms ! 
But hold, Encomium, while the bard shall trace 
The nymph's descent from some illustrious race, 
To what great sire her lineage shall he follow ? 
Say, who begat her, Denham, Wash, or Waller ? 

l The original of this, in Mr. Webster's handwriting, is believed by Thomas 
Porter, Esq., who furnished it, and who was graduated in 1803, to have been 
written while Mr. Webster was in college. 
Whom does she call her father, Smith or Broom, 
Yalden or Dryden, King or Sprat, or whom ? 
A dubious case ! Old Johnson, critic sage, 
Says she was born in many a different age, 
That Chaucer first produced her to the light, 
Next solemn Milton, ere he lost his sight, 
From ravished Genius gave the damsel birth, 
Who grew from him, like giants from the earth : 
Decrepit Pope, for one poor weak embrace, 
Is called the sire of that immortal race, ' 
Whose poetry now thunders round the ball, 
And tells how heroes or how sparrows fall, 
Princes or parrots meet some dire mischance, 
Ladies lose hearts or garters at a dance. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. DAVIS. 

Boston, January 18, 1804. 

MY FRIEND, You have been too long a citizen of this 
world to expect permanency in any of its enjoyments. Untried, 
as you may be, in the school of affliction, and few and light as 
have been your misfortunes, compared with those of others, 
you must yet have seen, what every one sooner or later is compelled to see, that he who would raise a column of durable 
happiness, must not lay its foundation in the earth. Of all 
calamities, the loss of friends impresses us most solemnly, because it is irretrievable. Ruined fortunes may be repaired ; 
reputation, unjustly ravished, may be restored ; enfeebled health 
may be renovated. But what shall repair the ruins of the 
grave ? What shall restore the breathless object of former affection ? What shall renovate the slumberer beneath the clods of 
the valley ? At this moment I know you are lamenting the 
loss of an excellent woman whom you loved as a parent, and 
whom all justly loved for the surpassing benevolence of her 
heart, and the sterling goodness of her character. 

During my residence at Hanover, I had more than one opportunity of witnessing the unwearied kindness and attention of 
Mrs. Fuller to the sick and the necessitous. I have seen the 

aspect of disease brighten at her approach, and sorrow and 
anguish banished by her kind and tender solicitude. I have 
seen her house and her heart open to receive friendless strangers, 
and to soothe and comfort the sick and the forlorn. 

Yet, however useful, human life must end. Though crowded 
with virtues, its date is momentary ; though all be done that 
can be done, how little is the amount! It is the tenure by 
which we hold all our friends, that when He calls, whose right 
to them is greater than ours, we must give them up. It is the 
part of wisdom to think, often and seriously, on the title to the 
good things we enjoy; and first and chiefly, to be anxious of 
placing our happiness where vicissitudes cannot change, nor 
accident destroy it. Low, and cold, and silent as your parent 
now is, must you, and I, and all our friends be. Happy, then, 
if we shall deserve to have shed on our graves the tears that 
bedew hers. I know nothing so mortifying to the vanity of the 
heart as the reflection, that we must one day depart, without 
having our absence felt beyond the circle of a small acquaintance. Yes, it is a truth, more solemn than the language it is 
conveyed in, that when 

" You and I are gone, 



This busy world will still jog on ; 

Will sing, and dance, and be as hearty ^ 

As if we still were of the party." 

Well and wisely is it ordained that men shall see then* own 
presumptuous folly in the fate of others. Good or great characters decease, are lamented, and in a few brief moments forgotten. 

Who, then, shall be mad enough to think himself of consequence ? 

" Rebuking Heaven ne'er called with louder voice, 
On swelling mortals to be proud no more." 

Adieu, my good friend, 

D. WEBSTER. 

VOL. i. 14 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. DAVIS. 

Salisbury, February 5, 1804. 

DEAR SIR, A part of a cold Sunday shall be employed in 
writing to you. Prevented by the weather from manifesting 
my devotion at church, I will manifest my friendship. 

It was the hope of indemnification that induced me to write 
to you, and as long as that hope continues, I shall be punctual. 
There is nothing which gives me more pleasure than a sociable 
family letter, filled up with those thoughts which swim on the 
surface of the mind. Such letters savor of conversation, and 
are a tolerably good substitute for it. But I did not intend 
here to give a lecture on letter-writing. 

I went to Concord a few days since, just to see Sophia and 
get my cheats, &c., &c. ; and so I was really cheated. She 
had taken the liberty to go home. Well, tell her not to hurry 
in making my flamadiddles. I shall not want them till Commencement. I have chatted with my brother about the matters and things which you mentioned to me. If he goes on 
again, he will probably accommodate you with any attentions 
in his power to bestow. But it is uncertain whether he ever 
summers among you again. This is told you in confidence. 
I pray you not to mention it to any person. If it be of any 
importance to you to know, I will inform you shortly of his 
going, or not going again to Hanover, with certainty. 

Cold fingers, you know, make short letters. 

Adieu. 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. No progress in electioneering as yet. I believe they 
at Portsmouth begin to stir. Those folks, you know, " are very 
busy, all alive." The Federalists, as their manner is, sit still 
and sigh at the depravity of the times. But sighs, and tears, 
and broken hearts are not worth a biscuit ; they cannot get a 
vote. Colonel K. will probably be candidate for senator in this 
district against Esquire Bradley. The prospect is that a good 
democrat will be chosen. In Concord, J. Green, Esq., is mentioned as Kent's successor as representative. 

I believe I mentioned to you that I have had a notion of 

making a communication to Miss Hough on the subject of L.'s 
property in the office at Concord. I should have done it before 
now were it not for the fear of saying something which might 
possibjy injure the feelings of Mrs. K. and her friends. If it 
were practicable to go clear of that, I believe it would do good 
to have the thing known. I expect you will write me by the 
bearer, whether such a thing would not, in your opinion, be 
advisable. Pray let me hear from you and of the health of 
Mrs. Davis, as I understand she left Concord unwell. If you 
follow my example in making a short letter, pray follow it also 
in adding a long postcript. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, March 16, 1804. 

GOOD OLD COMPANION, I have a thousand things which are 
secrets, and as many which are no secrets, to say to you in this 
letter. I hardly know where to begin, for there is such a struggle 
in my brain as to what shall be said first, that likely enough I 
may run over two pages before I say any thing. 

Yours of 22d February, was received March 12. " Hope deferred maketh the heart sick." I pray you never to delay writing 
so long again for any event ; for even one so important as the 
commencement of your labors as a lawyer, hardly atones for so 
long waiting. 

By this time you have decided where you intend to advertise 
writ making ; let me know about it directly. 

Several gentlemen of the profession have mentioned to me 
two or three towns, in Cheshire county, where an industrious 
young man might probably make a moderate living. Washington, Westmoreland, and Chesterfield have been named. As to 
the first, if you settle at Lempster, as I suppose you will, it will 
be too near to you ; so let that go. The other two I wish you 
to write me about as particularly as you can. I know I am in 
great season, as I have a year longer to read, but there are some 
other reasons, which induce me to wish to know generally what 
part of the country I shall inhabit. It is more than probable that 
I shall be leaving this place in April or May. If I could think 
it likely that I should hereafter find a resting-place at some 
town in Cheshire, I should be fond of reading in that quarter a 
while. Now, you know, if I could have my wish, I should be 
as fond of being in Mr. West's office as anywhere. Silence ! 
Don't whisper a word; don't ever think aloud; but ponder 
these matters a little at the bottom of your heart, and write 
me. Inquire if any charitable clever fellow at Charlestown 
would keep me, and get his pay when he could. Utter not a 
word for the soul of you ; but let me hear from you forthwith. 

So, by the help of a little good testimony, you came off victorious in your first attempt. Well, that is a good omen ; go on 
as you have begun, always, unless when your client's cause is 
an unjust one. 

I was lately in Concord, where I heard of our friend Mary. 
I shall not put down here all the civil things that were said of 
her, because, you know, I should make a bad figure in reciting 
compliments. My brother Zeke has made his bow, by letter, 
to President Wheelock, and gone to Boston. He has there 
taken a school, which I engaged for him in January, for you 
must know I have been at Boston since I last wrote you, and 
has the prospect of making something a little decent. Merrill 
was this way at the close of the last term. He is quite a beau 
for a tutor. 

Whitaker has opened his office in Providence. Fuller wrote 
me about two months ago ; he will probably settle in Augusta. 

As the last dull paragraph to a very dull letter I will tell you, 
that I have been out of health for some weeks, that writing is 
very uneasy to me, and that this is, I believe, the only letter of 
friendship, which I have undertaken to write these two months. 

Sick or well, however, I am not the less your friend, 

D. W. 

Write me forthwith. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 



Salisbury, March 16, 1804. 

YES, Merrill, a comparative estimate of the pleasures of ambition and of friendship will set the latter in an enviable view. 
Fame, if obtained at all, costs much. The pursuer after this 

ever flying goddess must climb over cliff and hill, " o'er many a 
frozen, many a fiery alp." Men are inclined to throw every 
thing in his way, and he must therefore prepare to counteract 
everything. Men's passions may be split, like the earth, into 
zones, and in every region the ardent follower of fame will find 
obstacles. First, there is that cold, arctic indifference that will 
not take the trouble to admire or applaud anybody, or any 
thing ; next, there is temperate reserve, prudence, discretion, or 
whatever you call it, that dares not praise, lest the object of its 
praise, by some possibility > be unworthy ; and last, and worst 
of all, come the torrid heats of resentment, rivalry, emulation, 
and opposition. But suppose your candidate for the caresses 
of Madam Fame survive all this ; suppose he pursue unremittingly the object of his love through " antres vast and deserts 
idle," through every difficulty, and over every obstacle, till at 
last he overtakes her ladyship, and is permitted to kiss the hem 
of her garment on Mount Immortality, what will the dear-bought 
damsel boot him ? If he take her to his bosom, she has no flesh 
and blood to warm it ; if he search her pocket, he finds nothing 
but poverty ; if he taste of her lip, there is no more nectar in it 
than there are sunbeams in a cucumber ; every rascal who has 
been bold and fearless enough, Nimrod, Catiline, Cromwell, and 
Tom Paine, all those have had a smack at her before him ; 
they have all, "more or less," become famous, and will be 
remembered much longer than better men. 

Yet, Merrill, you and I have some ambition ; so has, or so 
ought to have, every one. So much ambition as shall prompt 
to laudable exertion and industry ; so much as is well consistent 
with the duties and the honest pleasures of life ; as induces a 
wish to make ourselves respected by our friends and not entirely 
despised by our enemies ; and on the score of property, so much 
ambition as instigates to the acquirement of a decent, competent estate, enabling us to treat our friends as they deserve, and 
to live free from embarrassment; this degree of ambition is 
rational and necessary. 

Mr. Noyes handed me your letter written at Newburyport, 
which was cordially received, as any thing of the kind from you 
always will be. You must have seen Miss Thompson at Newburyport, because she mentions you in some of her letters to her 
friends here. She is one of our sort of girls exactly. You must 
14* 
have been pleased with Miss T.'s countenance, and, take my 
word for it, the whole volume, as far as I have perused it, is 
equally fair as the title-page. 

When you have an opportunity, if you please, you may mention my esteem as a friend to M. W. and N. R. Write me 
when you have leisure, which I hope you will find directly. 

Yours in all sincerity, 

D. WEBSTER. 

N. B. My brother has taken up his residence in Boston. 
He bids me mention his respects to you as a private gentleman 
and as an officer of college. 

I was within half a dozen miles of you about 20th of January, but did not know it till afterward. 

If you write Tenney, give him my compliments. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

P. S. The top of a letter is a new place for a postscript ; 
excuse it, for its design is to beg you to give my love to your 
and my Mends P. and E. 

Salisbury, April 3, 1804. 

GOOD HERVEY, I am really much obliged by your ready 
attention to my requests ; as also by your saying, that as Mr. 
West leaves the matter with you, I " may venture to jog on." 
Captain Enos is precisely the man for me ; if ever I eat bread 
at " No. 4," it will be at his table. The distance from the office 
is not too great in dry weather, and in wet times one has 
nothing to do in Charlestown, but just to step " the other side 
of the street." 

I am now going, James, to give you a full survey of the 
" whole ground," as it respects my prospects, hopes, and wishes. 
The great object of a lawyer is business ; but this is not, or 
ought not to be, his sole object. Pleasant society, an agreeable 
acquaintance, and a degree of respectability, not merely as a 
lawyer, but as a man, are other objects of importance. You 
and I commenced the study, you know, with a resolution which 
we did not say much about, of being honest and conscientious 

practitioners. Some part of this resolution is, I hope, still 
hanging about me, and for this reason I choose to settle in a 
place where the practice of the bar is fair and honorable. The 
Cheshire bar, as far as I have learned, is entitled to a preference 
in these respe.cts over that of any county in the State. You 
know my partiality for Connecticut River folks generally. Their 
information and habits are far better, in my opinion, than those 
of the people in the eastern part of the State. These reasons 
compel me to say with you, " it is a goodly land," and to make 
it my wish to settle therein. 

E contra,. Many of my friends are desirous that I should 
make an attempt to live in Portsmouth. Mr. Thompson, my 
good master, knows every thing about the comparative advantages of different places, everywhere in New Hampshire, except 
Cheshire county. He has frequently suggested to me, that 
Portsmouth would be a good place for a young man, and the 
other evening when I hinted my inclination for Cheshire, he 
said he had a high esteem for the people that way, but added 
that he still wished me to consider Portsmouth. He says there 
are many gentlemen of character there, who would patronize a 
young lawyer, and thinks that even Mr. Attorney- General 
would be fond of the thing. 

Mr. T. will have business, on which I shall be at Portsmouth 
as soon as the roads are passable, and out of respect to his 
opinion, I shall make no certain arrangements for my future 
reading till that time. At present, I do not feel that Portsmouth 
is the place for me. 

In the way of study, my present pursuit is some little knowledge of pleading. I am reading what Bacon has collected on 
that subject, and yesterday, you will hardly believe me, I travelled through a case in Saunders of eight Latin pages. Saunders inserts all the pleas, and abridges the arguments of counsel ; 
he is therefore, I take it, very useful to those who, like myself, 
are a good deal ignorant of the forms of pleading. I mean to 
lay my hands heavily upon him, and in one month I hope to be 
able to give some account of him. The winter has passed away 
more pleasantly than any I ever before passed at Salisbury, as 
far, I mean, as my health, which has not been the best, would 
suffer it to be pleasant. Mr. T.'s sisters have been in this realm, 
and being very excellent folks, added much to what was before 
very small society in Salisbury. Miss Poor is in town, yet it 
would please her vastly if you would just call and play a game 
at backgammon with her again. She says I unreasonably 
monopolized your company last fall, at the expense of the folks 
in the house. I told you how all that matter was and would 
be ; I don't see how I can live any longer without having a 
friend near me, I mean a male friend, just such a friend as one 
J. H. B. Yes, James, I must come ; we will yoke together again ; 
your little bed is just wide enough ; we will practise at the same 
bar, and be as friendly a pair of single fellows as ever cracked a 
nut. We perhaps shall never be rich ; no matter, we can supply 
our own personal necessities. By the time we are thirty, we will 
put on the dress of old bachelors, a mourning suit, and having 
sown all our wild oats, with a round hat and a hickory staff we 
will march on to the end of life, whistling as merry as robins, 
and I hope as innocent. Good-bye to this nonsense, and, by 
way of contrast, good-bye to you. D. W. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, April 4, 1804. 

DEAR DANIEL, I most readily concur in the opinion that the 
present scene of your life as well as my own, is marked with 
" dark traces and heavy shades." The map of human life is 
checkered with misfortunes and disappointments. A continual 
sunshine of prosperity does not accompany man in his transit 
from the cradle to the grave. Penumbral shadows of doubt, 
perplexity, and anxious care mark the pathway of the most fortunate through the course of life; and often the moment of 
greatest obscuration is the very period when he is about to enter 
upon a new profession. Yet, at solemn and distant intervals, 
a ray breaks through this gloom and opens to the imagination a 
vista of better times. Let this ray cheer and console us. It is 
a sweet delusion. I am glad that you feel no " depression of 
spirits." I cannot see any reason for an indulgence of melancholy, though there appears abundant cause. Fortune is a mistress not to be melted into pity by the plaintive lamentations of 
her stricken votary. Persevering enterprise alone withstands 

her frowns. Agreeably to your injunction, I have thought and 
meditated upon your letter, for three days, and for no inconsiderable portion of three nights, and I now give you the result as 
freely as I earnestly wish your welfare. I am directly opposed 
to your going to New York; and for several reasons. First, 
the expensiveness of a journey to that city, and of a residence in 
it, is with me a material objection. Secondly, the embarrassments to which you will be liable, without friends to assist or 
patronage to support you. Thirdly, I fear the climate would 
be injurious to your constitution. I have now told you what I 
w T ould not have you do, and I also tell you what I wish you to do. 
I would have you decamp immediately with all your baggage, 
from Salisbury, and march directly to this place. This is the 
opinion I have maturely formed for which a thousand reasons 
might be urged. They are too numerous to be mentioned, nor 
is it perhaps necessary, for I say to you imperatively, " come." 
It is the easiest thing in the world for a fellow of any enterprise 
or ability to support himself here, very handsomely, without 
descending to any business incompatible with the situation of a 
gentleman. Here, too, is the focus of information. Any person, however stupid and inefficient, cannot but learn something. 
With a head ever so impenetrable, some ideas will penetrate it. 
I will state to you a single circumstance which, I think, will 
remove all doubt about paying your way. I have now eight 
scholars, in Latin and Greek, whom I shall be obliged to dismiss 
if I cannot have an assistant, and I dare not, at present, hire one. 
The tuition of these eight scholars will pay for your board. They 
recite twice in a day, and it will take you about three fourths of 
an hour to hear them, each time. Here, then, you can support 
yourself by the labor of one hour and a half each day. If you 
will spend that time in my school daily, I will board you at as 
genteel a boarding-house as you can wish or the place affords. 
Consult father, the family, and your friends, and start for Boston 
the next day after the receipt of this letter. Another such an 
opportunity may never occur. Come, and if you don't find 
every thing to your liking, I will carry you back to Salisbury, 
with a chaise and six, and pay you for your time. I must say 
again, consult father ; if he approves, take the patriarchal blessing and come. 

, I am as usual, &c., 

E. WEBSTER. 
N. B. Be careful to remember those books. If you do not 
come, write immediately. 

Remember me most affectionately to the family. 

E. W 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Salisbury, May 1, 1804. 

DEAR MERRILL, There is no business so pressing, and no 
amusement so entertaining, from which the heart will not sometimes stray away to repose itself in the contemplation of old 
and undiminished friendship. I sometimes sit down to my 
books, transport myself to the court-house in London, and listen 
to wise judges and ingenious lawyers. But ere I am aware, 
thought wings itself to Hanover, to Charlestown, or the residence of some other friend, and I awake from the pleasant little 
vision, scarcely knowing where I left off in the lawyer's argument, 
or his Lordship's charge. A little business, which I shall mention anon, affords me a pretty fair excuse for writing you at this 
time. I am glad it is so. I am happy in the opportunity of 
spending, I mean of enjoying, a half hour with Merrill. What 
is this world worth without the enjoyment of friendship, and the 
cultivation of the social feelings of the heart ? For a life consumed in money-seeking, fame-seeking, and noise-making, I 
would not give more than eighteen pence, which is seventeen 
pence halfpenny, one farthing more than it is worth. 

O, Thomas, Thomas ! I wish I could see you. Since I last 
pressed your hand, my life has abounded in some incidents 
which I could magnify into matters of mighty little consequence. 
Poh! poh! What trumpery ! How microscopical is self-love! 
It makes us think that trifles, light as air, affect our friends because they affect us, or, to speak metaphorically, it swells a little 
piece of salt not bigger than a chestnut, into an immense mountain forty-five miles long. My heart is now so full of matters 
and things impatient to be whispered into the ear of a trusty 
friend, that I think I could pour them into yours till it ran over. 
But perhaps if we were to meet this hour, I should not be able 
to make out one sentence of any consequence. I have often 
been caught so, and have been so much mortified, that all my 

boasted sources of conversation could hardly be formed into a 
paragraph long enough for the use of two commas and a semicolon. 

I desire most earnestly to hear from you, to hear directly from 
your heart and your heart's concerns. Pray how do you feel in 
and about the heart ? And how does it feel about the heart of 
? Well, pardon me ; I am apt to put impertinent inquiries ; but they allow you an opportunity of exercising your virtue 
in forgiving ; a good trade, and which you will never find opportunity to leave off, so long as your acquaintance with me continues. Pray tell me all that may be told. 

Now, business. We are informed that a new statute of the 
corporation of the college has ordained that a student forfeits 
his connection with college, by an absence of so long a time ; 
how long a time, and what is the whole account of the business? 

These inquiries, as you will guess, are on account of my 
brother. I wish to know whether it is probable he can be graduated with his class. I believe he wrote the President and 
asked him that question, but I do not learn that he ever has received an answer. If the President forgets to give himself the 
trouble to answer him, he will expect me to get him the information some other way. You can if you will, and you will if 
you can, tell me all I want to know about the college laws in 
this respect. I should be sorry to have the old fellow trudge all 
the way from Boston to Commencement for nought. 

I look forward to Cambridge Commencement as the time 
when I shall see you ; perhaps it may come before, and whenever it does come, it will be welcome. 

I can think of nobody at Hanover to whom my compliments 
would be worth six pence. So Merrill must keep the whole ; 
they will do him little good, but they will cost him nothing. 
Very sincerely yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 


DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Salisbury, May 5, 1804. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Salisbury, you perceive, as yet heads my 
letters ; and how much longer it may, I can hardly tell. I know 
it is much better for me to be absent, and I am zealously laboring to put myself into a new situation. If I recollect, I informed you my intention was to depart, as soon as it is possible 
for me to get a little cash, to enable me to rig out ; for when I 
leave this vale, emphatically a " vale of tears," I am determined 
to be under no obligations to anybody in the neighborhood, except those of gratitude and friendship. I never heard what particular substance Archimedes wished his desired fulcrum to be, 
resting on which, he was going to move the world ; but if his 
design had been to move every thing in it, he would have wished 
it cash ; of all things of a perishable nature, it is worth the most. 
It ever did, does now, and ever will, constitute the real, unavoidable aristocracy that exists and must exist in society. I had an expectation of putting into execution a plan that would have made 
me able to see you immediately. It was well laid, and I begged 
of father to attend to it last week, at court, but he forgot it. 

I shall continue to scrape round me and let you hear how I 
speed. John Smith has left college ; he never sent me any word 
about your matters, and believes I have not heard from Hanover 
since I saw you. I have been thinking that if it can be well 
dispensed with, you would choose not to attend Commencement. 
You have never written me any word about your finances at 
present ; but if you could get forty or fifty dollars in the course 
of this month, you had better transmit it . to me, and send me 
on to Hanover with it, to intercede with his excellency about 
giving a degree without your presence ; and to secure the trifles 
you have there, and to pay the aforesaid forty or fifty dollars 
to your creditors. Father has sent 0000 to Mr. Lang, and I 
don't believe he will ; I don't honestly see how he can. Let 
me hear from you what you think in respect to this idea. I 
should abominate to look over your shoulder, in Boston, and 
see you break a seal and read : " Dear Sir, the little trifle you 
owe me," &c. 

You see, I suppose, the accounts of our governor election as 

readily as I do. If all the votes be returned, Oilman will creep 
in, on the force of about one hundred and fifty majority. Pray 
write, forthwith. 

Give my love to our friends. D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, May 10, 1804. 

DANIEL, I received yours of the 5th instant, and agreeably 
to your request shall give you an account of my finances. The 
report will not be very elaborate ; nor shall I be able to grace the 
cadence of many sentences with " money in the treasury." You 
know the conditions on which I took the school. The tuition 
of those attending the then present quarter was to be given to 
the Doctor; and, as luck would have it, not his sagacity, I 
found that almost all the quarters had expired, and were then 
commencing anew, when I undertook to teach the school. I 
would not mention this as any thing against the Doctor ; for 
he certainly treated me with great politeness. It is mentioned 
only as it proves that I could not receive much money until I 
had kept two quarters. One for him and the other for myself 
must be out before I could have any demands for money. 
This, however, is not the case with all. A few will expire in 
July. Until then I have no way to make or receive a cent but 
by admission. This is not a very abundant source of supply. 
The sum is only two dollars, and this never to be received but 
once for any one scholar. Once admitted, and the scholar may 
stay in my school forever and for aye, without paying again his 
entrance money. I brought a few dollars from home with me, 
you know ; but, as soon as I got into town, I found it necessary to new-habit myself; and, following your advice, I was 
determined to contract no debts while my money continued. 
Thus, dear Daniel, the end of the whole matter is that I am 
able to send you neither forty dollars, nor twenty dollars at 
present. However, I think it will not be a long time before I 
can say I owe no man any thing but " love and gratitude." I 
should be as unwilling as yourself to have you read over my 
shoulder, " Pay that thou owest." Saving debts of some few 
VOL. i. 15 
dollars, I owe no man any thing at Hanover but Mr. Lang and 
the authority. These debts are large enough to make them 
respectable. If these are demanded, they will be demanded in 
an honorable manner. They will not sell them to a friend, nor 
will they " tuck you by the arm " at every corner you may 
chance to meet them. In this situation, I thought and do still, 
it was best for you to come into town. The prospect may 
brighten, it cannot darken. I told you, in my last, a few dollars 
would be a pretty thing to bring ; because, as I have written 
above, my bills will not become due till July. Pray, write often 
until you come, and let me know every thing local. Contradictory reports reach us concerning the New Hampshire election. 
Give me some account of it, in every letter, until you come. 
Old South continues laboring in the " good cause," sometimes 
under one signature and sometimes under another. Like Goldsmith's redoubtable gander, he is determined to defend the 
" wash-pond " of democracy as long as he has a " quill to 
brandish or a tongue to hiss." If John Smith has left college 
permanently, I must write to some friend to see to my affairs 
there, if neither you nor myself should go thither. 

I am, &c. 

EZEK. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Salisbury, May 28, 1804. 

AND if it were a pleasant evening, thought I, as I read yours 
of the 16th if it were a pleasant moonlight evening, I should 
be willing to meet Merrill half-way, for sake of an hour's chat, 
even though that half-way might happen " in a marsh, or on a 
lake," or anywhere except in Ben. Thompson's tavern. I suppose I never shall have a heartier desire to see a male friend 
than I have to see your tutorship; but this, like some other 
more important wishes of the same heart, is not likely to be 
gratified. The first leisure, since the receipt of yours, is employed in answering it ; for when you are wrong, I wish to have 
you right as soon as may be. My former letter was probably 
written hastily. I am not now fully possessed of the contents 
of it, but it is probable I said a good many things which I did 

not mean, and left unsaid a good many things which I might 
have said, and which it rested with your sagacity to discover. 
From what I wrote, you conclude that I am " about to be 
caught in the toils of wedlock." Ay, an ambiguity! Pray, do 
you mean the snares or the labors of wedlock ? But you are 
wrong ; there is no such thing, nor any thing very much like it. 
This said wed-lock is a very dangerous sort of a lock. Once 
fastened, it is fastened forever. It is a lock that one can't unlock ; 
you can't break it, you can't pick it. Therefore I say again 
that this is a very dangerous one. In that idle reverie of the 
imagination that is called a " brown study," I have sometimes 
fancied myself a king, governing by wise maxims ; a priest, 
making good sermons; a doctor, a lawyer, and a thousand 
other things ; but in the most wayward frolic of fancy, I never 
dreamed myself to be a husband. A husband ! ! My pen flies 
and hurries from that word with an unusual degree of speed, 
and I am not sure that I could prevail on myself even to write 
it again. 

But this is all nonsense. I will try to be serious, for you 
appear to be so. Seriously then, Merrill, I am making no 
progress towards matrimony. In point of time, I am twentythree years nearer to it than when I was born ; but, in point of 
probability, I cannot say that I am any. You ask me to mention names, and say you would trust as much as that to a mail 
carrier. Really, Thomas, I love your zealous cordiality. Your 
earnestness to know the truth of your conjectures, I regard as a 
proof of friendship, and of the interest you take in my welfare. 
You have a right to know all, and, tempore proprio, you shall 
know ah 1 . I can say that there is no name which I could write, 
that is, or ever probably will be, in any way connected with 
mine. All I have said does not prove that I carry about in my 
bosom a stony heart, unpenetrated and impenetrable; much 
less are you to understand from it that disappointment is about 
driving me from this world " by cold submersion, razor, rope, or 
lead." You are great in arithmetic. I will give you a problem; but, on a second thought, it belongs rather to algebra 
than arithmetic. As known quantities, take partiality and 
esteem, on one side, to an indefinite degree, which Judge 
Woodward says is much the same as an infinite degree. On 
the other side, take charitv and condescension, but take with 
them also something like an alter amator et connexio precedens. 
Now, Mr. Algebraist, what is the result ? Ah ! it will be minus ! 

All these matters and things must rest here till I see you. 
There is no knowing what may be. Perhaps you and I shall 

cast lots for the privilege of making bows to M y. Be 

not alarmed, for if it fall to my fortune, I will seh 1 you my right, 
verily believing that before I see her again, her " Little Beater " 
(Bingham's name for heart) will be in the safe-keeping of my 
friend M. 

You have very much bound me, by your attention to my 
brother's matters. When I write him next, I will mention the 
subject of an oration. He has some reluctance to public exhibition, and perhaps will hardly be willing to prepare, under the 
idea that the occasion might happen. If not absolutely the 
last, this is near to being the last letter which I shall write you 
from Salisbury. I am now pretty well determined to go to 
Boston, about the first of July. I am now ready for my departure, and only wait to give myself the pleasure of a ride to the 
upper part of Maine, to accompany thither Miss Poor, who has 
been a while in Mr. Thompson's family, and whom you have 
heard mentioned. In this route I shah 1 see Mr. Dana's folks. 
If they are as inquisitive as ever, they have probably learned 
something of their cousin's state of mind. If they say any 
thing interesting to you, like as not I sh%ll tell you of it; 
though, by the way, I suppose you know much more than they 
do. I shall hardly see Hanover at Commencement. Good old 
village, adieu ! You ask me to tell you what to do. I would 
if I could ; but am scarcely able to direct myself. My wish is 
that you should be, in a great degree, what I can sincerely say 
I think you in a very respectable one, learned, deeply learned in 
biblical erudition. At this time more than any other, we need 
ministers who can furnish us with weapons to defend our faith. 

Pray, write me in season, so that I may receive your letter 
before I set out on my journey, about 15th of June. Tell me 
whether you shall, and be sure to say you will, be at Cambridge Commencement. Tell me every thing about everybody, 
and what everybody says about every thing. 

Who is more heartily yours than 

D. W.? 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Salisbury, June 10, 1804. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Yesterday evening I returned from election, 
in about as good spirits as you would naturally suppose, after 
being witness to the triumph of democracy. J. T. Oilman is 
elected Governor by a majority of one hundred and thirty-two 
votes, if I recollect right. The Senate is seven Democrats and 
five Federalists. Nicholas Oilman is President. John Langdon 
is Speaker of the House, by a majority of twelve. Nat. Oilman 
was yesterday elected Treasurer, by three votes majority; but 
on examination it was found that there were several more votes 
received than there were voters in the house ! What an everlasting disgrace to New Hampshire that there are such scoundrels 
in her government. This is about as clever as a Boscawen town 
meeting. To-day, at ten o'clock, they were to proceed to a new 
choice for Treasurer. I have not heard the result. Bradley and 
Bingham bring me the only word I have heard from you, since 
Mr. Greenleaf 's return from Boston. The former tells me he 
understands you intend putting your name in some office, forthwith, after Commencement. That is right. Make a good choice 
of an office ; he mentioned old Judge Sullivan's ; I should think 
that might do very well. 

Feeling some anxiety about your " sheep-skin," I wrote to 
Merrill, and begged him to put his finger on the President's pulse, 
and tell me how it beat. He writes in return that if you 
attend Commencement there is no doubt you will have your 
degree. He said that it would be well for you to prepare an 
English oration for Commencement. I promised to mention 
the thing to you. If you should have one of the very first 
stamp I should like it. 

I talk of going for Mr. T. to East Andover, to accompany 
Miss Poor to her friends. As soon as this is over I intend 
going to Boston. 

For cash I have made out. Perhaps in three weeks you may 
see me in Short street. Our cousin Nat. is getting better. 
Aunt Esther is about rushing into wedlock ; next week she sets 
out into life. Zeke, I don't believe but that Providence will do 
well for us yet. We shall live, and live comfortably. I have 
15* 
this week come within an ace of being appointed clerk of the 
Court of Common Pleas for Hillsborough county. Well, you 
will say, you are no better off than if you had not come within 
an ace. Perhaps I am ; say nothing, but think a good deal, 
and do not distrust the gods. 

I shall write you before I go to East Andover, if I go at all ; 
if I do not go I intend seeing you directly. 

Keep the contents of this page a close secret ; write me immediately, and believe me, 

Yours affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBS X TER. 

Boston, June 17, 1804. 

GOOD DANIEL, I was not very well the day our friend Bingham left town, or I should have written by him. I had not 
written immediately before, for I thought if you were about 
coming into town, you would make it in your way to be here 
about election time in this State, and concluded it might be 
probable that while my letter was finding its way to Salisbury, 
you might be moving towards Boston. Your last, however, lets 
me know that you are still in Squam, but will be in " Short 
street " in about three weeks.. A very delightful place ! We 
shall be glad to see you. Come as soon as convenient. Mr. 
Thompson sends you upon business to East Andover? Be 
faithful to your employer, and do not lay your action so as to 
be nonsuited; for you must remember that nothing but the 
death of the party will enable you to bring a new suit. I 
think, Daniel, you made a very good supper upon a " white 
raven," when you were going to have so cleverly the clerkship 
of Hillsborough county. It would, though, be a very pretty 
thing and I advise you to use all honest means to procure it. 
It will answer very well for the present. In that office you may 
make a little money, become acquainted with the forms of legal 
business, and be prepared to enter your profession with many 
advantages with which you could not at present. You know, 
however, much better about this than myself. Ask me about a 
school and I am equal to you. Democracy has triumphed in 

New Hampshire. It is nothing more than I expected, and 
what I told you. In my opinion there is not a nook or corner 
in the United States that will not be revolutionized. The contagion of democracy will pervade every place and corrupt every 
generous and manly sentiment. It cannot be successfully 
resisted. The pestilence will spread in a favorable state of the 
atmosphere, notwithstanding all the medical exertions of the 
most skilful physicians. 

I am glad Nat. is getting better, and that aunt Esther is about 
to be married. 

Remember me to all the family, and tell them all to write me 
by you. Good health, a pleasant journey, and a quick arrival at 
this place. 

I am, &c. E. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Salisbury, June 18, 1804. 

JEM, By this time you are seated fair and easy at your office 
table, and ready to receive communications from your friends. 
" Communications ! " What have I to communicate ? Alas, 
alas, my noddle affords an argument against the old maxim of 
the Schools, that nature abhors a vacuum. I believe I told you 
every thing in the short space of time we chum'd together at 
Polly's house, and among other things I told you I would write 
you in a week. It is for the sake of fulfilling this promise, and 
not because I have any thing, black, white, or gray to write to 
you, that I now lay aside my garden hoe, and take up an instrument which I handle much more bunglingly, a pen. To-morrow 
morning, if the wind blows precisely from a N. N. W. point ; 
if the sun puts on a cool garment, and does not sweat himself to 
death, as he has done a week past, with his fearnought ; if the 
great sieve of the skies does not drop down its waters too 
copiously ; if every thing is fair and handsome, cool, and comfortable, why then I shall set out for East Andover to gallant 
Miss Poor to her friends. 

Our honorable court are going on finely. They have passed 
a set of resolves approbatory of the present administration ; they 
have agreed to the amendments to the Constitution, by a majority of seven. They intend, as we hear, to district the State 
for the choice of Representatives to Congress. The electors, they 
say, shall be chosen by the people on a general ticket ; and the 
people are to be told to be sure to vote for the democratic 
ticket. Mr. T. told me that Mr. West was to be candidate for 
a seat in the Senate, about to be vacated by the expiration of 
Judge Olcott's time. And this is all the political news, which 
has yet transpired from the Honorable General Court of New 
Hampshire. 

A few days since I received a letter from Freeborn ; he is in 
Edgefield District, South Carolina. He writes that he has a 
good stand for the distribution of medicine, but says the ribs 
that way are rather ugly. He passed some time at Washington, 
Norfolk, and Charleston, and seems to write in his usual flow 
of spirit. 

I shall see Cook ; shall I give your Honor's love to him ? Ay, 
I will even venture it ; give mine to Harry. There was something which I intended to have said to him in a P. S., but just 
at this time I can't recall it. 

On a review of this letter, I find that if my character for letterwriting were not already established, this would fix it completely. 

Good-bye. You will never have another such an interesting 
letter as this. Two prodigies come not in one age.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Salisbury, June 18, 1804. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Day after to-morrow, if the wind blows from 
the right point, I start for East Andover ; on this tour I expect 
to be absent about twelve days ; and soon after my return here, 
I expect to be in Boston. The season is now so far advanced, 
I intend to make my calculation, so as to be merely seasonably 
in town, to learn the arrangements of your school and be able 
to manage it, till you go after your degree. Now I want you 
to be particular. Some time ago you mentioned to me a few 
Latin and Greek scholars ; since then you keep glued lips on 

the subject of your school. I desire to know whether you can 
employ me ; how many hours per day ; in what doing, and for 
what reward ? All these questions you must certainly answer ; 
and have your answers here by the time I return. Tell me into 
whose office I had better go ; whether letters of introduction 
and from whom would be useful ; in short, tell me every thing ; 
and as an inducement I will now tell you all I know about our 
New Hampshire politics. 

The propositions in amendment of the Constitution passed 
by a majority of seven. It is probable Nicholas Oilman or 
Jonathan Steele will be elected Senator to Congress, in the 
place of Judge Olcott, whose time expires next March. Mr. 
West will be the Federal candidate. I know not if this election 
is to be made this session. It is said the representatives to 
Congress will be chosen by districts. I know not who are candidates on either side. The electors, they say, are to be chosen 
by the people on a general ticket. The Democratic candidates 
are thought to be Goddard, Langdon, Allen, Tarlton, Obed, 
Hall, &c. The Federalists meet to-night to agree on their list. 
The probability is, it will contain the names of Jere. Smith, 
Tim. Farrar, Ben. West, perhaps T. W. Thompson, Arthur 
Livermore, Wm. Hale, Oliver Peabody. This is my conjecture, 
perhaps I am incorrect. The court have had the grace to add 
five hundred dollars to Chief Justice Smith's salary ; this, it is 
thought, will keep him on the bench. 

Apropos, they have passed a set of resolves complimentary to 
the present administration ! 

In the neighborhood, we have nothing new. Everybody is 
well except Uncle Will, and he has just told me to say to you 
he is better. Aunt Jones is married to old Uncle Adams. 
Hymen came down one evening and did himself the honor to 
unite the glowing lips of youth and beauty. 

Mr. Davis was this way at election time ; he brought nothing 
from Hanover, worthy to be told. 

Adieu. Pray do not fail to write me, so that I may find your 
letter here when I return. Give my love to Doctor and Mrs. 
Perkins. 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



DIARY. 



[THE following fragment of a Diary, kept by Mr. Webster 
while a student at law> being all that has been preserved, is inserted here, in the order of time, and is interesting as containing 
sketches of some of the eminent men then at the Massachusetts 
bar.] 

July 17th, 1804. Arrived in Boston. 

19th. Paid Elijah Chamberlain thirty-nine dollars and fortyeight cents, for my friend D. Abbott, Esq. 

20th. Waited on Mr. Gore ; and, by the kindness of my friend 
Bradley, prevailed upon him to receive me into his office. Paid 
two dollars to Dr. Perkins's boy for Repertory. Paid Mr. Bradley three dollars for tickets. 

24th. Entered the office of the Honorable C. Gore, as a student at law. Bought annu. pro mea 

28th. Took up at Mr. Chamberlain's three dollars twelve and 
a half cents. 

29th. Wrote Sarah. 

30th. Paid seventy-five cents for thread gloves. 

August 1st. Scripsi mece 

2d. Dr. P., debtor, fifty-four cents, paid. Wrote Freeborn 
Adams, a few days ago. 

5th. Dr. P., debtor, twenty-five cents. 

7th. Pay to J. Bradley, for J. McGaw, Esq., two dollars and 
fifty-six cents; handed it to S. Bradley. Bought, yesterday, 
Pursuits of Literature, for one dollar and sixty cents. Wrote 
Mr. Hough for Courier, 4th instant ; also, wrote Bingham, same 
day. Paid twenty-five cents, for Dr. Perkins, to Bradley, in way 
of tickets. 

10th. Finished reading Ward's Law of Nations, two vols., 
and began Vattel. 

18th. Went from Dr. P.'s to McC.'s to board. Sent by E. 
twenty dollars to Mr. Abbott. Paid one dollar and fifty cents 
for door keys ; one dollar and eighty cents for locks and keys. 

31st. Attended the trial of Blood, for passing counterfeit bills ; 
heard Otis, in his defence ; very fluent, rapid, and ingenious ; 
Davis, on the part of the government, shrewd and dextrous, but 
using language incorrect and often inelegant. 

September 1st. Handed Dr. P. thirteen dollars. 

4th. Finished reading Evans's Essays on the " Account for 
money had and received," and bills of exchange. Wrote to 
J. McGaw, Esq., yesterday. 

14th. Paid S. A. Bradley five dollars for some small notes, 
et cetera. Wrote Mr. Bigelow. Finished Evans on Insurance, 
some time ago ; read Boswell's Hebrides. 

17th. Professional life affords fewer prospects of making great 
estates, but more certainty of earning a comfortable living. 
Mercantile business is precarious though often exceedingly lucrative ; professional, seldom very lucrative ; but generally, certain ; 'therefore, I rejoice that I am in the way of a profession. 
Oh, Instability ! To-day, I have heard of mercantile failures. 
I philippize against that employment now ; to-morrow, perhaps, 
I shall hear of great and heavy gains, and shall then eulogize it. 

22d. Returned from Worcester ; heard A. Walcott say that 
the Democrats had lost ground in Connecticut, at this fall election ; that the constitution plan was rather unpopular ; and, as 
he thought, premature. 

24th. Socrates said, if you marry, you will repent ; if you 
neglect it, you will repent. Read Viner's Title of Pleadings 
yesterday, and to-day. It is not so copious nor so instructive 
as what Bacon says, under the same title. Wrote Mr. Peirce, 
some days ago. 

26th. Read one hundred pages in Abbott on Shipping ; derived much instruction from it. " If a captain in his voyage 
hypothecates his ship to different loaners, and to a greater 
amount than the value of the ship, the last loaner shall be 
entitled to priority of payment ; because it is that loan which 
preserved the ship." 

October 1st. Finished Abbott on Shipping ; a valuable treatise : " If C. D., by a proper deed, authorize A. B. to execute a 
bond or other deed for him, A. B. may do this either by writing 
C. B. by A. B., his attorney, or by writing A. B. for C. D., provided he delivers the instrument as the deed of C. D," page 300. 
I prefer the former mode. 

4th. Read the first volume of Moore's Travels. 

5th. Finished Vattel, for the third time in my life. " If goods 
are found remaining in the hands of an insolvent factor, they 
may be claimed by the consignor ; because a delivery to a factor 
does not of itself alter the property." Abbott on Shipping, page 
233. By the civil law, and by the laws of Russia and France, 
if a man become bankrupt, the seller of any goods to him, if he 
could identify the goods unsold, in the hands of the bankrupt, 
might claim them, and should not be compeUed to divide them 
with other creditors. This is very different from the law of 
England, by which goods become, by actual or constructive 
possession, the absolute property of another and equally liable 
to all creditors' claims. 

9th. Looked through the " Elements of Common Law," by 
F. Bacon, Lord Verulam. If there be any ambiguity apparent 
in a deed, it shall not be allowed to clear it by averment of matter of fact ; this is dmbiguitas patens, namely, the uncertainty 
appears by inspecting the deed ; this is to be cleared by construction, not by averment. But if there appear no uncertainty in the 
deed or will, but yet certain facts exist which create an uncertainty, then it is proper to aver ; as if A., by will, give an estate 
to his son ; here is no ambiguitas patens ; but, if it be afterwards 
known that A. have two sons, then it may be allowed to aver 
that he intended his eldest son. 

Tilth. Read Viner. Title, Obligation. If three bind themselves and each of them, it seems that two of them cannot be 
sued. If a bond be written jointly and severally, though the 
delivery be at several times and places, it is yet both joint and" 
several. If a man covenants with ten and each of them to make 
sea banks in D., and does not, whereby the lands of two are 
injured, those two may have their actions." Bond to two, for 
two thousand pounds, to pay one hundred to one and one hundred to the other ; if one obligee die, qucere, if the other shall 
have the two thousand pounds ; I think not ; but there is authority of contrary opinion. See Dyer, p. 350, and Bacon in loco. 

If condition for an obligation be insensible and contradictory, it 
shall be rejected, and the obligation shall stand. If A. promise 
to pay ten, without saying to whom he promises, it shall be intended that the promise is made to the person to whom the payment is to be made. This ought to be alleged in the writ, 
otherwise it will not appear that the plaintiff is entitled. Littleton. If a man bind his heirs to pay a sum and does not bind 
himself, it is void ; for no man can charge his heir but as part 
of himself. If three are bound and one is impleaded and the 
plaintiff recovers, and after impleads another, the first recovery 
is no bar; for, judgment is not satisfaction; contrary, if plaintiff take execution, by his recovery, a co-obligor must plead satisfaction. If two are jointly bound, and one die, you can only 
sue the survivor, and not the executor of the deceased also ; 
otherwise, if they are bound jointly and severally. After assignment of a bond, the money is the assignees' ; and payment 
to the obligee, after notice of the assigpment, is not good. 

" My heart still hovering round about you, 
I thought I could not live without you ; 
Now we have been two months asunder, 
How I lived with you is the wonder." 

Empedocles Behemoth scarlet die. 

16th. Bought hat for seven dollars. 

18th. Read Bacon's Title, Obligation. If two are bound 
jointly, and one dies, the survivor shall be alone chargeable ; and 
the executor of the deceased shall not be bound. In this case, 
the declaration v. survivor should state the death of the co-obligor. 
Dyer, 19, 310. If two are jointly and severally bound in an 
obligation, and the obligee releases one, both are discharged ; 
and, a fortiori, if it be a joint bond. Coke, Litt. 232. One 
surety may compel another to contribute. If the condition of 
an obligation consist of two parts in the disjunctive, both possible 
at the time of making, and after, one becomes impossible, by the 
act of God, the obligor is not bound to perform the other. Ray, 
373. The alternative is for the benefit of the obligor. A bond 
with condition to kill J. S., is void ; but a feoffment, on such 
condition is good, for the law will, in each case, remove the 
temptation to do evil. C. Litt. 206. If I contract to deliver 
forty yards of cloth, and cut it in pieces, and then deliver it, 'tis 
a breach. If a man be bound to pay money, at a day, and he 
VOL. i. 16 
pay it before His due, 'tis a good payment, and such payment 
may be given in evidence, under solvit ad diem. Coke L. 212. 
A bond, dated May 12, payable on the 13th of May following, is 
payable on the 13th of May next year. In cases where notice 
and request are necessary, yet the obligor is disabled by his own 
act from performing his bond, it is forfeited without notice. In 
debt on a bond, for the performance of several things, it is not 
enough for the defendant to plead that the condition is not 
broken ; he ought to show how it is performed. This sort of 
general pleading was never admitted. In debt on obligation the 
defendants cannot plead nil debet; he must plead non estfactum, 
or a release, &c. N. B. Scripsi, 4 Man. ; C. W. ; Judge Wood ; 
New Hamp. Mem. Con. 

November 28th. Returned from Albany. 

30^. Wrote my father, Mr. Thompson, and T. A. Merrill. 

December 6th. I have to-day paid Mr. Chamberlain thirtyfour dollars ; fourteen in specie, at the shop ; twenty in bills, at 
the house. Lent him one hundred and ten dollars ; received it. 
Wrote to Mr. Caldwell, and requested him to serve the summons, 
Gore v. Brazer. Wrote to Dinsmore, Esq., Keene, and enclosed 
Lowe's receipt. 

January 2d. Mr. Gore told me that when he was in practice 
in this town, formerly, he made from one thousand five hundred 
to two thousand guineas, the year. Judge Tudor, Messrs. Morton, Hitchborn, Lowell, and Edwards, were the chief men then 
in practice. He was invited to be Comptroller of the Treasury, 
but declined. Mr. Davis was then appointed. When Mr. Gore 
went to Europe, he recommended Mr. Dexter to be his successor. 
Mr. Dexter declined, and General Washington appointed Mr. 
Davis. 

19th. Finished reading Gifford's Juvenal. 

March 5th. This day, in one of the rooms of the state house, 
in presence of Isaac P. Davis, and Samuel A. Bradley, and 
Jem Dix, Jr., I examined the letters to Callender from Jefferson. 
Mr. Dix told me he had often seen the signature of Mr. J., and on 
being asked whether he doubted that Mr. J. really signed the 
letters in question, he said, " he did not." I preserve this precious confession against a time of need. 

SOME CHARACTERS AT THE BOSTON BAR, 1804. 

THEOPHILUS PARSONS, Esq. is now about fifty-five years old ; 
of rather large stature and inclining a little to corpulency. His 
hair is brown and his complexion not light. His face is not 
marked by any striking feature, if we except his eyes. His forehead is low and his eyebrows prominent. He wears a blue coat 
and breeches ; worsted hose, a brown wig, with a cocked hat. 
He has a penetrating eye of an indescribable color. When, 
couched under a jutting eyebrow, it directs its beams into the 
face of a witness, he feels as if it looked into the inmost recesses 
of his soul. When Parsons intends to make a learned observation, his eyebrow sinks ; when a smart one, for he is, and wishes 
to be thought, a wit, it rises. The characteristic endowments of 
his mind are strength and shrewdness. Strength, which enables 
him to support his cause ; shrewdness, by which he is always 
ready to retort the sallies of his adversary. His manner is steady, 
forcible, and perfectly perspicuous. He does not address the 
jury as a mechanical body to be put in motion by mechanical 
means. He appeals to them as men, and as having minds 
capable of receiving the ideas in his own. Of course, he never 
harangues. He is never stinted to say just so much on a point, 
and no more. He knows by the juror's countenance, when he 
is convinced ; and therefore never disgusts him by arguing that 
of which he is already sensible and which he knows it impossible 
more fully to impress. A mind thus strong, direct, prompt, and 
vigorous is cultivated by habits of the most intense application. 
A great scholar in every thing, in his profession he is peculiarly 
great. He is not content with shining on occasions ; he will 
shine everywhere. As no cause is too great, none is too small 
for him. He knows the great benefit of understanding small 
circumstances. 'Tis not enough for him that he has learned the 
leading points in a cause ; he will know every thing. His argument is, therefore, always consistent with itself ; and its course 
so luminous that you are ready to wonder why any one should 
hesitate to. follow him. Facts which are uncertain, he with so 
much art connects with others well proved, that you cannot get 
rid of the former, without disregarding the latter. He has no 
fondness for public life, and is satisfied with standing where he 
is, at the head of his profession. 
J. S. is a man of some understanding and a great deal of ambition. He is the reverse of Parsons in many respects. He has 
less learning, less perspicuity, less force, less pertinency. He 
rolls on his cause with an immense labor, deals in much sour 
invective, and acts in that way, as if he supposed the court and 
jury against him. He has, however, much industry, and is said 
to be a man of excellent private character. I should think him 
near sixty. 

Samuel Dexter, Esq., is about forty years old ; a man of large 
size and noble appearance. His complexion is dark and his eyes 
dark, large, and prominent. In point of character, Dexter undoubtedly stands next to Parsons, at the Boston bar ; and in the 
neighboring counties and States, I suppose he stands above him. 
He has a strong, generalizing, and capacious mind. He sees his 
subject in one view, and in that view single and alone he presents 
it to the contemplation of his hearer. Unable to follow Parsons, 
in minute technical distinctions, Parsons is unable to follow him 
in the occasional vaultings and boundings of his mind. Unlike 
Parsons too, he cannot be great on little occasions. Unlike him, 
Parsons cannot reject every little consideration on great occasions. Parsons begins with common maxims, and his course to 
the particular subject and the particular conclusion brightens 
and shines more and more clearly to its end. Dexter begins 
with the particular position which he intends to support. Darkness surrounds him. No one knows the path by which he 
arrived at his conclusion. Around him, however, is a circle of 
light, when he opens his mouth. Like a conflagration seen at a 
distance, the evening mists may intervene between it and the eye 
of the observer, though the blaze ascend to the sky and cannot 
but be seen. Mr. l)exter is not a great student. Early attention has stored his mind with an immense fund of general principles, and he trusts his own powers in the application. He is 
generally opposed in causes to Parsons, and their contest is that 
of exalted minds. No fretting, no bickering, no personal asperity 
ever exists between them. Dexter is not rich. He lives upon 
his profession, which, as I was told, by a pupil of his, affords him 
an income of near five thousand dollars. He once received fourteen hundred dollars for arguing a cause for the Spanish consul. 



DANIEL WEBSTER 185 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Boston, August 4, 1804. 

DEAR HERVEY r Boston, this marvellous town, full as you 
know it is of every thing of every sort, has not altogether enough 
in it, nevertheless, to fill the whole capacity for happiness. 

Neither business nor amusement hath charm enough to supersede the use of friendships, " ancient and honorable." I am in 
great want of a letter from you ; and as the readiest way of getting it, I write this as a sort of dun, a creature handily manufactured by one of our profession. 

I have been in Boston, according to Sir Isaac Bickerstaff, 
" the full term of twenty days," in which I have enjoyed good 
health, the use of a good office, and the company of some good 
friends, three as comfortable things as a body could wish for. 
I am in the office of the Hon. Christopher Gore, lately returned 
from London, where he has resided the eight last years, as a 
commissioner under the British treaty. I neither knew him, nor 
had letters to him when I came into town, nor was I acquainted 
with anybody that did know him. I was pleased with his reputed character, and knew that the chance was, that he would 
not have a great deal of small business to do in his office ; such 
was the office I wished to enter. On the whole, I preferred it 
to any office in town, and had reason to suppose that it would 
not be disagreeable to him to take a clerk. What was to be 
done ? How should I become known to him ? I meditated on 
these questions a day or two, and, at last, luckily thought that 
I had a tongue in my head ; and that, Deo volente, et modestia 
non pugnante, I could tell him my own name. I consulted with 
Bradley, and on the whole we concluded that being both strangers, we would go and introduce each other. We succeeded 
admirably. Mr. Gore agreed to receive me, but not understanding Bradley very distinctly when he mentioned my name, I had 
been in the office a week or so before Mr. Gore knew the name 
of his clerk ! ! ! . This I call setting out in the world ! Mr. Gore 
is a fine man ; learned and communicative, and I could not possibly be better situated ; but I most devoutly hope that I shall 
never have to set out again. 

Jerome, the brother of the Emperor of the Gauls, is here ; 
16* 



186 PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE O* 

every day you see him whisking along Cornhill, with the true 
French air, and his wife by his side. The lads say, that they 
intend to prevail on American Misses to receive company in 
future after the manner of Jerome's wife ; that is, in bed. The 
gentlemen of Boston treat Monsieur with cold and distant respect. They feel, and every honest man feels, indignant at seeing this lordly grasshopper, this puppet in Prince's robes, dashing through the American cities, luxuriously rioting on the 
property of Dutch mechanics or Swiss peasants. 

Will you do me a favor ? Mr. Sumner is Coleman's agent to 
receive payments for the New York Herald. I began to take 
the paper some time in the fall of 1802; can't say exactly when. 
I have sent to the printer three dollars. Now I wish you to pay 
Mr. Sumner what there is due, and send me an account of it, 
and I will forward it to you again by the next mail. I would 
send it now, but cannot tell within a dollar or two what is due. 
If you will attend to this thing and write me forthwith, you will 
oblige me. I wish to have the paper stopped. Give my love 
to our friends, and believe me yours affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Boston, September 14, 1804. 

DEAR HERVEY, I should be glad if I could think of a great 
many wise and useful things to say to you nowj just as you are 
preparing to clothe yourself in the character of a lawyer. Having 
however a subject nearer home, for all the admonitions with 
which my mind furnishes me, I shall leave you unadvised. 

I wish you were here. Boston would please you as a place of 
professional study. I could, however, only wish you here under 
particular circumstances. You say the want of cash prevents 
you, and if it were not for that you would pass a six months 
here. I do not know whether I should advise it. You are now 
ready to open an office, open ; you are ready to make writs, 
make them ; you are ready to go about getting money, get it. 
This is my advice. If I had gone my time, I would not stop to 
study law anywhere ; not because I think it a good calculation 
to hurry into life ; but I am argued into the notion by that all
powerful argument, the necessity of being in business. Write 
me in less than two minutes after you receive this, and let me 
know where you are going to. fix yourself. Having settled, for 
I suppose you intend to stay in Cheshire county, I wish you to 
give your opinion of the then best vacancy in Cheshire, together 
with the opinion of others whom you hear mention the subject. I 
mean to stay here, if I can, till my time is out, and in the interim I wish to inform myself, so as to be at no great loss for a 
stand. If I am not earning my bread and cheese, in exactly nine 
days after my admission, I shall certainly be a bankrupt. Fuller 
was lately here. He said much about Bingham, and appointed 
once or twice to write to you, but something prevented. He 
had with him a Miss, who is said to be his intended. She appears a very sensible, agreeable girl. Mary Smith is in town. 
I have made her my humblest bow. Last evening I was at 
Perkins's ; some one knocked ; the door was opened ; when, with 
precisely the old swing, entered that "urbanic and extended 
figure," Augustus Alden. He is very well ; resides at Augusta, 
a student at law. Adieu, good fellow, adieu, 

D. WEBSTER. 

Give me information about my newspapers, that I may reimburse your expenditures on the subject. Zeke sends love. 



MR. EBENEZER WEBSTER TO HIS SONS. 

Salisbury, October 6, 1804. 

DEAR SONS, I received a letter from you by Mr. Sawyer. I 
was very happy to hear that you were in good health. I have a 
sufficient reason for my not writing by the last mail. A week 
ago last Tuesday, I attended the funeral of Benjamin Page ; 
came home and went to bed as well as usual. About twelve 
o'clock, I was taken with a violent pain in my side, which terminated in a pleurisy fever. I had a physician sent for as soon as 
possible. He took some blood from my arm, which gave me 
some relief ; but I lay in this distressed situation until Thursday, 
before I could be moved, even to have my bed made. The 
fever has now abated, so that I am able to walk about a little. 
Had I sent for you when I was first taken, I thought it impossible for me to live in such distress until a messenger could get 
half-way to Boston ; if I had written by the mail, it might have 
given you anxious feelings for me ; for these reasons I have 
omitted writing until now. I wish you to write by the next 
mail, by all means. Your mother's health is much better than 
when you left her, though very poor now. We have got our 
new cider made, and this day began to gather our corn ; our 
potatoes are dug. I have great reason to be thankful that I am 
able to subscribe myself your living and affectionate father. 

EBENEZER WEBSTER. 



MR. THOMAS W. THOMPSON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Salisbury, October 17, 1804. 

DEAR SIR, I returned from Haverhill and Hanover last Sunday, after an absence of nearly three weeks. Upon my return I 
received yours of the 27th ultimo. 

Unfortunately the rule of the bar is as you suspect, and the 
business entirely escaped my mind at September court. I was 
at the court but about an hour. I did not attend October court 
at all, I feel criminally negligent, and to quiet my own mind 
and make you some amends, I have written this day a circular 
letter to each gentleman of the bar in the county, propounding 
you for admission, and preparing their minds to dispense with 
the letter of the rule, considering it was established when the 
terms were three months only apart. An association of ministers 
meet this day at Mr. Worcester's, and your father has undertaken to disperse the letters by the mail and by those ministers. 
I flatter myself this propounding will answer your purpose. If 
not, I feel confident the court will admit you without the recommendation of the bar. No exertion shall be wanting on my part 
to procure you the recommendation of the bar. 

The death of President Willard affected me very sensibly. I 
not only esteemed and respected him very highly, but I loved 
him. My two years' residence at Cambridge as a tutor, gave 
me an opportunity of knowing him perfectly. To strangers his 
address was rather of the repellant sort, to his friends he was 
amiable in the highest degree. My opinion is that the corpora
tion cannot select a more suitable person to fill the vacancy occasioned by his death than Judge Davis. If Judge Davis had 
more dignity of person, his appearance would I think, be more 
presidential. This is a trifling exception. I can't help feeling a 
strong attachment to my Alma Mater, and this attachment, together with my general regard for the interests of literature and 
religion, creates a strong anxiety to have that chair filled by the 
very best man that can be had. The influence of a President 
of that university may be of incalculable importance. Why is 
not a Professor of Divinity chosen ? I wish you to unravel this 
mystery. I suspect the corporation have different views upon 
the subject; some wish for a Calvinist, others for an Arminian. 
I conjecture that the difficulty of supplying that vacancy results 
more from something of that kind than from a lack of candidates 
of respectability, who would accept the appointment. I wish 
you to inform me. 

I am much pleased with the communications signed Mass. 
and W. 1 and I can assure you they have excited a very interesting inquiry for the author. The former I recognized ; the 
latter I had not seen till after the receipt of your letter. Go on. 
Catch every leisure moment. If pecuniary compensation should 
not follow, you wih 1 have a satisfaction of a higher nature. 

It gave me no small pleasure to learn that you had found a 
seat in Mr. Gore's office, and I made an effort, the effect of 
which I have never learned, to interest Mr. Gore's feelings in 
your favor. Mr. Saml. Torrey is his brother-in-law, and my 
effort was directed through him. 

I wish you could persuade Park or some other good soul to 
preserve a volume of the best eulogies on Hamilton. I am confident a subscription for that purpose would run well. The best 
I have seen are Nott's, Mason's, Otis's, and Ames's. Cheetham's 
ought not to be omitted. 

If you propose to pass the winter in Boston, I should like to 
know it in order to give you some commissions of a troublesome kind. I shall wish you to write to me often, and you 
must pardon me if I insist upon paying the postage upon my 
own and your letters. At some distant period I shall not object 
to your paying your proportion. 

1 The Editor has not been able to find these communications. 
1 hope you keep up your acquaintance with my friend, Captain Wm. Parsons. Say, how is this ? 

We have had as yet very few particulars of the destruction 
done by the late storm in your quarter. At that time I was at 
Hanover with my family, and was obliged to remain there three 
days before I dared set out for home, and then I was two days 
and a half travelling home. One person counted one hundred 
and sixty trees, which were blown across the turnpike between 
dough's in Enfield and Thompson's in Andover. The snow 
in the woods was from one to two feet deep. When I came 
through on Saturday it was upon an average one foot deep, and 
so solid as to bear me for miles without leaving scarcely any 
impression of my foot. We were eight hours in the carriage, 
riding eighteen miles. At the Plain, the snow was about six 
inches deep after the storm, and very solid. The orchards and 
woods through the country have sustained immense damage. 

I have for a long time endeavored to purchase, without success, 
Roscoe's Life of Lorenzo de Medicis. Will you purchase it for 
me and send it up by some of our traders ? My wife has heard 
much of a novel called The Minstrel, and wishes you to purchase it for us. Please to let me know the prices, and I will 
transmit you the money by the return of the mail. 

Should you have occasion to borrow money, please to let me 
know it, and if I have it on hand I will accommodate you with 
it as long as you please, at six per cent, annually. 

Your friends here are in usual health, excepting Mrs. Hadduck, who is quite unwell yet. 

My regards to Ezekiel. 

I am, dear Sir, affectionately yours, 

THOS. W. THOMPSON. 

N. B. I wish you to procure me a copy of the act incorporating the Exchange Bank, or such parts of it as will be necessary to show the principles of that institution. If it is published 
with the public acts, perhaps you can procure a printed copy, 
and forward to me. Furnish me, if you please, with any information you may possess that will be useful in understanding 
the manner in which it is conducted. 

Enclosed is a ten dollar bill, for which you will please give me 
credit towards the disbursements I have requested. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Boston, October 17, 1804. 

DEAR FULLER, If it be as cold at Augusta as it is here, and 
if you were called up last night, as I was, tf> see a house burn 
down, you will wonder how I happen to take a notion to write 
to you this morning. The motive is, I have several things to 
say to you, which I had better say now while they are recent. 
Day before yesterday I had a letter from brother Davis; all 
finely at Hanover ; pumpkin pie and professors plenty ; wheat 
and poetry a good deal blasted ; girls and gingerbread as sweet 
as ever. Last Sunday evening, to-day is Wednesday, I had 

the pleasure of a moment's chat with . She appears 

much out of health, and though she laughs as heartily as usual, 
I suspect the good girl is declining. She was here on a short 
visit, and has returned. I could not parry several questions she 

asked me concerning my friend , and concerning certain 

other things that concern him. I was obliged to tell all I knew, 
how could a body help it? One cannot get rid of a lady's 
question by evasion ; she will immediately assail in another 
shape ; she will know the truth and the whole truth. Even if I 
had the honor of being interrogated by a female with respect to 
any affair of my own, I should recite the facts and answer her 
questions in as simple and plain a style as John Bunyan's ; for 
I hold it an established point, that when a woman has a right 
to know a thing, you cannot content her with any thing short 
of the whole matter. 



Once or twice I have had the honor of bowing to Miss Paine 
in the streets. Possibly, it may be well that I am not in a way 
to cultivate the acquaintance to which you introduced me. She 
might perhaps write her name upon my heart as fairly as I can 
write it upon paper. Yet that would not be a singular case, 
for there has been many a lover before me, who has had Pain in 
his heart. 

Freeborn has written me a very pretty letter. He likes every 
thing in Carolina except the ribs; those he thinks poorly 
polished. Charles Gilbert has been in town since you were 
here. His health is very low, but he flatters himself that it is 
mending. 

********** 

I owe you one dollar and ten cents, and interest three years ; 
this shall be as good as a note for it till it is paid. 

Make my best respects and present my best wishes to Miss G. 
I am not the less interested in the welfare of a good woman, 
because her welfare is a part of the happiness of my friend 
Fuller. 

Adieu, my dear Sir, Adieu. 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Worcester, Tuesday Evening, November 5, 1804. 

DEAR ZEKE, So far so well. Mr. Chamberlain thinks of 
setting out this week for Canaan, N. H. 

The object of this is to request you to go to him and beg him 
not to say to anybody in or about Salisbury, that I am gone on 
this journey. I forgot it You will find some cash with him, 
unless you have got it. 

Adieu. If I go to Connecticut River, I will write you thence. 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Springfield, November 9, 1804. 

DEAR ZEKE, I write to fulfil my promise, and not for the 
purpose of disburdening myself of the history of any events 
which have happened on the road. In travelling from Worcester 
to Albany, the direct path is through Northampton; yet one 
may go by way of Springfield, if he will. " For which reason we 
resolved to go by Springfield." Don't impeach the strength of 
this motive. It is not solely on a journey performed in a postchaise that caprice chalks out the route. 'Tis the same on the 
journey of life. 

We are below Northampton some twenty miles, and on the 
east side of the river ; ten miles south of this is the north line 



DANIEL WEBSTER 193 

of the land of " Steady Habits." Riding from Boston here, is 
just like riding through New Hampshire and Vermont. The 
same prospects, the same people, the same modes and manners 
of life. An uneven, mountainous surface extends from the neighborhood of Boston to within ten miles of this place. These ten 
miles are measured over a dead, flat plain, covered with pitch 
pines. In my course hitherto I have met with nothing novel 
or unusual to me, if I except a toasting-iron, which I saw at 
Brookfield. Ardent of knowledge and desirous of making the 
most of my travels, I seized my pencil, "warm and glowing" 
like the object, and sketched a likeness of this toaster on a leaf 
of my pocket-book. 

This day is a very snowing one. We shall be embargoed if the 
weather does not change soon. It not only confines us to this 
town, but even to the house. I can see nothing. I recollect 
of hearing father speak often of the marvellous elm trees in 
Springfield. I intended to enclose two or three of the largest 
and handsomest of them in this letter, for your use ; and ten 
minutes ago sallied out with great coat and umbrella, in order 
to examine them ; but the storm drove me into the house again 
before I had gotten three rods from the door stone. I shall, 
however, keep the said trees in my mind, and visit them the 
moment it leaves snowing. 

Here is before me the oddest picture I ever noticed. I know 
not what it is designed to represent ; but I believe it must be 
Venus and some female attendants taming some Cupids. The 
old lady has one of her sons in a cage, out of which he is sticking his nose and lamenting like a thrush. She has another fast 
by one wing, while he flutters in the air like a wounded partridge ; and, as we suppose, exclaiming most dolefully. One of 
the attendants has another little god between her knees, and 
while his lower extremities are thus confined, he is striving and 
fluttering like a bird, which endeavors to rise with a strap at its 
legs. Now, I suspect that on paper all these make but a poor 
show ; but they look well on canvas ; and if you will not believe 
me, you may come and see. 

Thank the storm for this letter ; for had the weather been fair 
I should this moment have been rolling on to the " high houses, 
with the gable ends towards the street."

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Boston, November 30, 1804. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Having been absent from town some 
weeks, yours of October 20, did not reach my hand till day before yesterday. Ah 1 that I know about " evanescent subtenses " 
or " conterminous arches " might be collected on the pupil of a 
gnat's eye, without making him wink. This, however, I know, 
that my friendship for Merrill is a sentiment in no degree evanescent, an arch both ends of which rest in the foundation of my 
heart. I was sadly grieved that you did not write me sooner. 
My heart suggested a thousand excuses. " Merrill is busy ; new 
employments fill up all his time ; he is making his acquaintances, 
and has much visiting to do ;" but I never suspected that you 
were ignorant of the place of my residence. W. Woodward, 
Esquire, made me your compliments just before I left Salisbury, 
and in your behalf asked me where a letter would find me. I 
told him Boston. As Dr. Perkins and my brother were at 
Commencement, I took it for granted you knew that I was in 
this marvellous town. So much for explanation. I am now 
here, believe me ; you are at Middlebury ; and let us take care to 
remind each other of these facts often. Now hear me talk a 
little about myself. I am in the office of Christopher Gore, Esq., 
who has lately returned from London, where he has resided for 
eight years, as an American commissioner, to settle commercial 
claims between the two nations. He is a lawyer of eminence, 
and a deep and various scholar. Since I left John Wheelock, I 
have found no man so indefatigable in research. He has great 
amenity of manners, is easy, accessible, and communicative, and, 
take him all in all, I could not wish a better preceptor. My 
acquaintance here does not extend very far. It were much 
easier for me to form connections than to support them. There 
are many young men of my own age with whom it would be 
easy to associate ; but a young man who has a fortune to spend, 
is not a proper companion for another who has a fortune to 
make. There are, however, some families into which I have 
free ingress here. I resort sometimes to play backgammon with 
the girls, in order to keep off the glooms, 

" With speech so sweet, so sweet a mien, 
They excommunicate the spleen." 

There are many fellows in this town from abroad, who like 
myself fall under the general class of adventurers. Some for 
knowledge, some for fame, and some for cash. A similarity of 
pursuits attaches these to each other ; and, if I must say the 
truth, I think they are rather envied than despised by the natives 
of the peninsula. You would be astonished at the portion of 
the active business of the place, of every kind, that is done by 
men who moved here from the country. Yet, as far as my circumstances will admit, 'tis my endeavor to become acquainted 
with the aboriginal Bostonians. It is not the locality of the 
town, it is not a sight of Beacon Hill, or the Long Wharf, that 
renders Boston useful as a place of residence for a stranger ; but 
the conversation, the acquaintance, the connection, the intimacy 
which one has with the Boston folks. An English lord, when 
he travels to view the continent, carries with him English companions, English servants, and English books. He will stop 
nowhere but at an English inn, and converse with nobody but 
his countrymen. How superlatively ridiculous th^s is ! What 
use is there in going to France, if he must carry England with 
him ? Now this is quite too much the case with young gentlemen who come here from the country to read professions. They 
associate together; they almost invariably fall into the same 
boarding-houses ; and of the manners of Boston folks they catch 
none hardly of the spirit ; of their habits they learn few beside 
the bad ones. 

Dear Merrill, I reciprocate your wishes for a meeting most 
cordially. Why were not you at Cambridge Commencement ? 
I explored every countenance I met, with the strictest scrutiny, 
to see if I could not make M.'s face out of it, but M.'s face was 
gone to Middlebury. Of the heart and the heart's concerns I 
can say nothing, for want of room to say enough. Merrill, if in 
your walks you should happen to meet with Wisdom and Folly, 
in whose hands should you look for the sceptre of this world ? 
For my part, I deny mente et lingua, pugnis et calcibus, unguibus 
et rostro, the old Grecian definition of human nature. "Animal, 
bipes, implumis, rationalis ;" so says Plato of Man. I contradict 
him ; and to put the thing beyond doubt, I will write my verdict 
in poetry of the most sublime kind, -favete Musce audi Merrill ! 
What nonsense lurked within the pate, oh ! 

Of definition-making Plato, 

Who sang in philosophic metre 

" Man is a rational and biped creature ? " 

Many do think, and so do I, 

Old codger, that you told a lie ; 

And yet, perhaps, you surly lout, 

There is a hole where you'll creep out ; 

Males you call rational, but no man 

E'er heard you say the same of woman ! 

Yet I do believe we are pretty much alike. I should rejoice to 
chat with you, and inquire and inform about all matters and 
things. Pray write me all you know about Hanover, and write 
me as soon as you receive this. A letter in four or five months 
is four or five times too seldom. Adieu. 

D. WEBSTER. 



MISS SALLY WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Salisbury, December 21, 1804. 

DEAR BROTHER, With pleasure I can now inform you that 
your friends in this place are all in good health, except Mrs. 
Hadduck, who is very unwell, but we think her some better than 
when we wrote before. Before we received your letters by the 
mail, we heard that you were gone to New York, with a gentleman, at the moderate price of seven dollars a day for your 
company. It seems, Daniel, that your company is very agreeable in Boston, as well as in Salisbury. We should all be willing to give as much to see you in this town, if we had the change 
as handy as you have in Boston. I cannot think of any news 
to write to you about at present ; the people here move on in 
the same old way as when you were here. Sometimes we have 
junkets, sometimes we have freewillers' meetings. I had almost 
forgotten to do my errand to you. A gentleman called here the 
other day, and asked me if my brother Daniel was then in Boston, and if I had heard from him lately ; and he would have me 
by all means write to you and send his most profound respects, 
as his regard for you was very great. I asked him to sit down, 

but he could not tarry a moment longer than to do his errand. 
I have now done mine, and if you can ever find him out or tell 
me what his name is, I shall be very glad to know, as T never saw 
the man before, or any thing that looked like him. Before I 
have finished my nonsense, I must tell you that our neighbors, 
opposite the door, fought a duel the other day, one with the 
gridiron, the other with a candlestick. The female, however, 
came off victoriously, and he, with all speed, ran here for some 
lint and rum, to be applied immediately, for he was bleeding to 
death with a wound in his head, caused by the gridiron. I fear 
you will now say : " If Salisbury females fight with such weapons as gridirons, it is best for me to stay where I am," and by 
that means we shall not see you this winter. I hope Ezekiel will 
write soon if he is not too much engaged in his school. We have 
no school here now, but expect one soon. Moses will go all the 
time. Do write every opportunity, and consider that if my letters 
are not agreeable to you, yours are both pleasing and instructive 
to me. Mother sends her love to you both, and thanks you for 
your wishes to send her a present, but as she is in no present 
want of any thing you can get, she will not trouble you for any 
thing now. I must now end my letter by subscribing myself 
your friend and often obliged sister, 

SALLY WEBSTER. 

[Postscript dictated by Judge Webster to his daughter, and 
signed by him.] 

DEAR SONS, Governor Oilman has called on me for money. 
He has a large payment to make out soon, and wishes my assistance. If you can hire me forty or fifty pounds, at Boston, and 
send it on by the next mail, I will return it as soon as I can. Perhaps I cannot before March court. I can settle with Mr. Whitehouse without troubling you, but I cannot make out for the 
governor as I should be glad to, unless I can hire some money. 
Nathaniel Webster would like to take your horse and sleigh and 
meet you at Dunstable, or go on to Boston, if you think it best, 
and will write to us when you wish to leave Boston. We received a very acceptable present from you, which makes us very 
comfortable this cold weather. As to the place of your settlement you must determine for yourself. Esquire Bowers, Mr. 
17* 
Greenleaf, and others, are very anxious to have you at the Centre 
road. Write by the next mail whether you can obtain the 
money or not. 

EBN. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Dear Boston, January 2, 1805. 

DEAR SQUIRE, A letter from you always gives me two happy 
half hours, one when it is received, and another when it is answered. Figure to yourself, then, a large room in the third story 
of a brick building, in the centre of Boston, a sea-coal fire, and a 
most enormous writing-table with half a cord of books on it. 
Then figure further to yourself your most obedient, with his 
back to the fire, and his face to the table, writing by candlelight, 
and you will precisely see a " happy fellow." There, now, is a 
famous dash at description ! Now let me try my talents at narration. Well, then, on the fifth day of November, being election 
day, at just twenty-seven minutes and a half past twelve, I left 
Mrs. Whitwell's, Court street, Boston, and on the twenty-eighth 
day of the same month, at one o'clock, p. M., arrived at the same 
Mrs. Whitwell's, in the same Court street. You can easily determine, from the above account, where I went ! ! If, however, 
you should be puzzled, I will tell you ; to Albany. Yes, James, I 
have even been to Albany. I cannot now tell you why, nor for 
what, but it was in a hackney coach, with a pair of nimble trotters, a smart coachman before, and a footman on horseback behind. There's style for you ! More than all this, I had my friend 
at my elbow% Now why the deuce must I ruin this account by 
informing you that it was a male friend ? Yet this regard to 
truth must be kept up, though it is a shackling thing. Well, to 
proceed : my expenses were all amply paid, and on my return, 
I put my hand in my pocket, and found one hundred and twenty 
dear delightfuls ! Is not that good luck ? And these dear delightfuls were, 'pon honor, all my own ; yes, every dog of 'em. Now 
don't you think I would jump to go to Albany again ? But to 
be serious. I really went to Albany, in November, with a gentleman of this town, for which I received the above reward; 
and I'm so proud to have a dollar of my own, I was determined 

to tell you of it. Of my journey and all that I saw and heard, I 
cannot give you a particular account now. 

At Hartford, I saw Simeon Lyman. He is a merchant. I 
dared not go to see Fanny ; though I would not for any thing 
have her know that I passed so near her. Do you ever hear 
from her ? How is she ? Does she mention my name in her 
letters to you ? At Providence I saw Nye, who is a student at 
law ; and Whitaker, who is a husband and a practitioner. On 
my journey, I met with F. Hunt, at a tavern. He is settled in 
Hampshire county, Mass., not far from the line of Connecticut. 

Well, my dear friend, I rejoice that you are settled under circumstances so promising; you have passed. the crisis; you 
lived through the hour of anxiety and uncertainty, and you see 
before you a respectable living. I rejoice ; and while you prosper, I will rejoice. I expect to be admitted in March, at Amherst, 
or in April, here. 'Tis not true that I determined to open an 
office here. I have no thought of it. I thank you for the information you give me about Cheshire County. At present, I 
incline to think it not unlikely that I shall go to some of the 
places you mention. But before three months expire, somebody may pop into them all ; there is no knowing. Do let me 
hear from you often, and believe me yours, firm and strong. 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Boston, March 10, 1805. 

DEAR FULLER, Whenever I see the face of Mr. Whitwell, I am 
reminded of my duty. For two months, he has been a standing 
monitor, notifying me every time I enter the State House, to 
write to Fuller. Not that he has ever spoken to me, or I to him, 
but that he always brings you to my mind ; and being remembered, you call on me for an answer to your last. Since I saw 
you, I have flown to Albany ; rested my wing for a while, and 
next perched at Hudson ; oiled my feathers there, and proceeded 
to Hartford and Providence, and after cooing and chattering with 
Nye and Whitaker, fluttered into Boston. Shortly after, the ill 
health of my father summoned me to Salisbury. I went, had 
the pleasure of seeing him recover, took his blessing, and hied 
back again. In two weeks I again put myself in motion, and 
like Noah's dove, shall flutter, with faint and wearied wing, over 
the deluge of this world, seeking for rest. In some country town 
in New Hampshire I shall probably put off my character of a 
rover, and fix my feet for a season. Having been for the winter 
a wandering comet, in the spring I become a falling star, and 
shall drop from the firmament of Boston gayety and pleasure, 
to the level of a rustic village, of silence and of obscurity. From 
this village, however, wherever it is situated, the voice of friendship will issue ; you will hear my accents and be invited to 
answer to them. In the meanwhile, wish me well, as the only 
service you can for the present render me. 

The discussion you had with the " five ladies in Boston," on 
the question whether Mr. W. was a " plain man," must have been, 
I think, very edifying. It requires, certainly, a vast variety of 
knowledge to manage this question creditably. You must, for 
instance, know geometry ; for how could you speak of the angles 
of his phiz, unless you understood decagons and rhomboides ? 
And chemistry, and sculpture, and architecture, and gardening 
would all be necessary. If, however, you will admit the reasoning of Granger, the Parisian, I can easily prove that I am the 
handsomest man in New England. This is the process : Boston 
is the handsomest town in New England ; Tremont is the handsomest street in Boston ; Scollay's are the handsomest buildings 
in Tremont street ; Christopher Gore's office is the handsomest 
room in Scollay's buildings ; and I am (now) the handsomest 
man in Christopher Gore's office, ergo, I am the handsomest 
man in New England ; Q. E. D. Now if this cause stands over 
for second argument, I shall entreat my counsel to make use of 
this reasoning. We had fine fun here of "Allen's motion ; " the 
poor fellow now sits in his seat, still as a sitting hen ; scathed 
and blistered by the thunderbolts that knocked him down, he 
has such a dread of making motions, that he seems afraid to 

move his limbs. is acquitted. So much for and ; 

so much for and the devil. These four illustrious personages I consider the real agents in the whole business ; though 
perhaps not in equal degrees, for I take it the last-mentioned 
gentleman has more modesty than to come in for an equal share. 
If the devil has any regard for truth, he must confess that, at the 

head of Club, either of the other gentlemen is much more 

of a devil than himself. 

Make a low bow for me to Miss G., and assure her I esteem 
her for your sake and her own. 

Yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Boston, March 10, 1805. 

DEAR MERRILL, You did not knock at our office door. 
" Come in," said I, the moment my ear informed me that any 
knuckle was in contact with the panel. " Come in," said I 
many times, when the knock existed only in my imagination. 
But Merrill came not. Well, "pie fata decernunt" I shall now 
never see the rogue in Boston. 'Tis no matter ; I shall see him 
somewhere else. I write you this, to inform you that you need 
not write me until you hear from me again. I shall leave this 
town in twelve days, and that part of terra flrma where I shall 
next perch is at present terra incognita. If, however, it should 
be within mail-shot of Otter Creek, I will salute you from my 
new residence immediately. 

So Merrill has preached. I congratulate you on having entered your profession. The moment when we first make trial 
of our talents in that employment which we have chosen for 
life, is a most solemn one. What conflicts, what alternate triumphs between the rival powers of Hope and Fear ! Feeling 
ah 1 these myself, I heartily rejoice that you have got over them 
and made a beginning. I only saw Professor Shurtleif in public, and had no opportunity of asking him how Merrih 1 appeared 
in the desk. But I have no fears ; 'tis not for friends to flatter ; 
but I am sure you will do well. Now perhaps you would say 
something like this to me. Poor human nature! How entirely 
sure we are and easy about everybody's fortune but our own. 

As it is a principal object in the correspondence of scholars to 
commune together on their studies and pursuits, I should now 
be very glad to rehearse to you a long list of corpulent volumes 
which I have read, and inform you of new regions of literature 
which I have explored. But alas, alas ! if I except a few slender 
and lean professional books, the rest and residue of my reading 
would make a sorry account. I could hardly get beyond item 
the second. Gifford's Juvenal has amused me for some evenings. 
Gibbon's Life and posthumous works, Moore's Travels in France 
and Italy, et pauca alia simUla, have rescued me from the condemnation of doing nothing. At present, I am earnest in the 
study of the French language, and can now translate about as 
much, for a task, as we could of Tully in our Freshman year. 

Political altercation is very warm here, both within the legislature and without. Mr. Allen, a Democratic member of the 
House, made a motion to dismiss the State printers from their 
employment for publishing some gross reflections on Mr. Jefferson. The orator was proceeding with great zeal to represent 
the sin of this conduct in the printers, when one of the Federalists arose and knocked him down with an unexpected thunderbolt. He produced proofs and documents to establish all the 
charges made in the paper. But you have seen all this in the 
newspapers. You did not tell me any thing of our friend 

M y W d. Pray who is to lead her off? I hear nothing 

of those things here ; inform me if you know. Dear damsel ; I 
should like once more to survey her tenement of clay, and listen 
to the accents dictated by the inhabitant within. But when, 
or where, or whether at all, all is uncertain. Yes, every thing is 
uncertain except one thing, which is that I am your sincere 
friend. D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, April 25, 1805. 

DEAR BROTHER, I had learned the loss of my money from 
Mr. Fifield's own mouth, whom I happened to see in Newburyport, before the reception of yours. I am far from feeling any 
uneasy sensations on that account. It was mere misfortune, 
nobody is to blame ; the sum was eighty-five dollars. 

I believe that in writing a hasty epistle to D. Abbott, and 
another to yourself, last Saturday, I sent yours to him and his to 
you. You were probably perplexed to understand what you 
received. Father's ill health and other circumstances induced 
me to take a stand here. My prospects of business are moderate 
at present. 

It is utterly out of my power to repair the loss of eighty-five 

dollars. I hired that money of a friend in Salisbury, and cannot, 
as I know, hire a like sum. My hopes from T. W. T. all failed. 

If Mr. Parker 1 can be persuaded to retain the books till next 
week, I will write you again, and inform you whether there 
exists a probability of my being able to take them. My trunk 
of clothes I will thank you to put into Bancroft's stage-coach, and 
send to D. A.'s office in Dunstable. He will forward it to me 
by a stage-coach, which runs from Dunstable to this place. 
Please to coil a rope or line round the trunk to prevent it from 
bursting; see it in the coach yourself; tell Bancroft I am an 
old customer, and he must be very careful about it. 

I do not think there is any chance of my getting Mr. Parker's 
money. I will however try, and write you again by the mail, 
which arrives in Boston Saturday, next week. Folks at Salisbury are all well as usual. Father is getting abroad cleverly. 

Adieu, D. W. 

P. S. Thursday Evening. Since writing this letter, I have 
been to Hopkinton and have just returned. I cannot say that I 
have a prospect of forwarding the money for my books. In 
June I expect to be in Boston. If in your opinion it is best, 
you may pay Mr. Parker his outsets and break up the bargain ; 
or if you can find any one who is fool enough to lend you the 
money till June, and you think you can make out a part of the 
money then, you may send me the books, and you shall own 
the proportion for which you pay. However, I have no expectation of this kind. I have seen Fletcher to-day. He is earnest to 
make a bargain with you ; and on the whole, I incline to think 
you had better make up your mind to that purpose. My business 
is worth a little. I believe I earn my daily bread. With a premium, it might possibly be effected that Mr. Parker, with Mr. 
Thacher's security, would wait all June for his money ; could 
you in that case make out a part of it ? Try Parker, and if so, 
I will, being notified, write to Mr. Thacher on the subject. 

Write to me every week for the present. B , your eight 

dollar friend, is not heard of. The opinion prevalent is, that he 
was a spirit, come from the " vasty deep," for some unknown 
purpose. The academy has walked down to the south road. 

1 Samuel H. Parker, Esq., now living, in good health. He has stated to the 
Editor that he remembers the matter of the books very well.

Mr. Eastman has undertaken to keep a grammar school going 
in it ten years, on condition the neighbors will board for seven 
shillings and sixpence the week. Mr. Fifield's family felt pretty 
sensibly Jonathan's misfortune ; but I believe are now reconciled 
to it. 

Fol de dol, dol de dol, di dol ; 

I'll never make money my idol ; 

For away our dollars will fly all.

I'm twenty times richer,

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, April 30, 1805. 

DEAR ZEKE, As yet I find it not in my power to procure any 
money for the purpose of paying for my books. I therefore am 
under the necessity of requesting you to make my peace with 
Mr. Parker. Give him something, if aught you have to give, 
to indemnify him for his trouble and expense, and ask him to put 
the books again on his shelves. In the course of the summer 
perhaps I might find a chance to procure the cash ; but probably he would be unwilling to keep the books any longer in 
uncertainty. The books which I own, he will give to you, and 
you may, at some convenient time, send them td me. Considering your circumstances, I do not imagine it to be in your power 
to borrow the cash for a couple of months in Boston. If you 
should providentially light on a chance, and it should be necessary to procure a surety, be pleased to carry this letter to my 
friend, Mr. Thacher, and I think he will be friendly in the case, 
as I have in many instances found him so before. 

My residence here is tolerably pleasant. I live with Mr. 
French. Some little business is done here, and I get a part. 
In time, perhaps, I shall gratify my moderate, rational wishes. 

Mr. Putney has failed. Mr. D is convalescent from his 

sickness of the purse, and expects to be in business again soon. 

Mr. Lovejoy will shortly occupy the store in which Mr. Putney 
traded. 

At Salisbury, the folks are in usual health. Father is much 
better than in the winter. N. Webster keeps school in his own 
district ; his health is tolerable. Pray write me often ; without 
books and with little business, I have much leisure to peruse 
and answer letters. 

Make my love to my friends. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Since sealing this, my books have arrived all safe. I 
owe Mr. Parker many thanks for his friendly conduct respecting 
them. I do not find a list or bill of prices of the books among 
them. I wish you would ask him for it, and enclose it to me. 
I shall take true care that the contract within be punctually 
fulfilled. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, May 3, 1805. 

GOOD DANIEL, In one of my late letters I requested some 
particular information respecting the probable conditions on 
which the clerk's office might be obtained, and likewise the 
probable emoluments of the office. I confess, Daniel, my acquaintance with the business of teaching a school does not 
increase my love of it. If ever I have built any castles in the 
air, I demolish them as readily as ever you saw me demolish a 
potato when we travelled over the Zahara of America. It 
would be the consummation of my wishes to get into some business which would be adequate to the support of a small family. 
I hope you will embrace the safe opportunity to write, particularly by Mr. Fifield, and give me your advice without any 
reserve. Colonel Sam. Thatcher has given me a pretty good 
offer to go into his office ; it would be something more than 
pretty good, if I contemplated a settlement in that section of the 
country. I am glad you do not make money your idoL If I 
should ever worship it, 'twould be from the same motives from 
which the Indians worship the devil ; to deprecate evils. As to 
the politics of this place, I can probably give you nothing new. 
VOL. i. 18 
The election occurs next week. The legislature is to fill the office 
of Lieutenant- Governor. A majority of the members elect are 
undoubtedly Federalists. As Mr. French does not leave town 
till to-morrow, I shall send by Mr. Fifield the letter I prepared 
for him. I shall write too by Mr. Fifield to father. You have 

never told me how you came to dine on a white raven of 's 

cooking. He was the last man in the world who would have 
prescribed that dish for your stomach. Write me very often 
and believe me, Yours, E. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Boscawen, N. H., May 4, 1805. 

DEAR BINGHAM, You must know that I have opened a shop 
in this village for the manufacture of justice writs. Other mechanics do pretty well here, and I am determined to try my luck 
among others. March 25. I left Boston, with a good deal of 
regret, I assure you. I was then bound for Portsmouth, but I 
found my father extremely ill and little fit to be left by all his 
sons, and therefore partly through duty, partly through necessity, 
and partly through choice, I concluded to make my stand here. 
Some little business is doing in the neighborhood, and of that 
little I hope to get a little part. This is all that I can at present 
say of my prospects. For one thing I ought to be thankful. If 
poverty brings me so near the wind that I cannot stay here, in 
duty to my stomach, I have only to take my hickory and walk. 
The disagreeable incumbrances of houses, lands, and property 
need not delay me a moment. Nor shall I be hindered by love, 
nor fastened to Boscawen by the power of beauty. 

Our friend Lovejoy will open a store in this place next week, 
in which he will put Warren, his brother, and Thomas, son of 
Major Taylor. I shall be glad to have them here. One disaster has happened to me. With the assistance of my friends, 
I collected eighty-five dollars and sent to Boston for the payment of a bookseller, with whom I had contracted for a few 
volumes. But the cash was stolen from the pocket of the 
bearer, after he got into Boston, and I lose all. Books, therefore, I must go without for the present. 

When I have more leisure, I will write you more at length 
The object of this is only to tell you that I am here, and pray 
you to write to me. How much did you pay Mr. Sumner for 
my New York paper ? 

Adieu, my old, good friend, 

D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, May 12, 1805. 

DANIEL, Your letter of April 30 came to hand last evening. 
Some person, in his great wisdom, erased Boston from the back 
of it, and wrote Boscawen, N. H., which officiousness probably 
prevented my receiving it before. You know the state of my 
finances and my wish to assist you. Whatever is possible for 
me to do, shall be done. I will confer with Mr. Parker on the 
business to-morrow, and let you know the result immediately. 
If you have no business or but very little, you ought at least 
to have books, so that you may become learned, if not rich. If 
I should not be able to send your books, you must turn author, 
and write your dissertation on the Constitution of New Hampshire. Before you assume this new character, I will say to you 
in the indignant language of Johnson : 

" Yet think what ills the scholar's life assail ; 
Pride, envy, want, a patron, and the jail." 

With respect to the Fletcher business, I leave it to be managed 
very much according to your discretion. To me there seems 
a degree of meanness or of disgrace, in seeming to purchase 
an office. I hope I do not feel too squeamish or over-delicate 
on this point ; and I am confident, likewise, that you would 
never agree to my taking it on terms inconsistent with the 
character of a gentleman. Have you ever mentioned it to the 
court, and what say they ? Who, in point of law and equity, 
should lose the eighty-five dollars, you or Mr. Fifield ? With 
me there is a doubt. Osgood thinks that himself should lose 
twenty ; Fifield twenty ; you twenty, and I twenty ; or more 
accurately, that each of us should lose a quarter of the whole 
sum. I shall direct this letter to Salisbury ; and if that be not 
the best place for you to receive your letters, inform me. Did 
you secure Mr. Gore's debt against Putnam? Have you 
received your trunk in safety ? How do you like " Democracy 
unveiled ? " 

Give my respects to Mr. Wood's family, for I fancy you see 
them occasionally. Tell the family at home that I am well 
and want to see them very much. 

Yours truly, 

E. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Boscawen, N. H., May 14, 1805. 

DEAR MERRILL, When I wrote you last I was in Court 
street, Boston, and now I am in Court street, Boscawen. March 
24. I left the lively capital of New England, not without regret. 
Whether a good or evil star led me to this little village, I know 
not. All that I can say about myself at present is, here I am. 
If you pass this way you will find me just as happy to see you 
as ever ; and happy I should be at such an event at Iceland, or 
the Cape of Good Hope. Not a sentence which had Merrill's 
name in it has sounded in my ear this many a day ; you, yourself, uttered the last. Not a soul from Hanover have my eyes 
beheld who could say anything about you. I presume, however, that if I give this a direction to Middlebury, it will hit you. 
Where will it find you? How employed? My heart feels a sort 
of vacuum when it cannot fancy the situation of my friends. 
While you resided at Dartmouth College, I could trace you in 
your morning vocations and in your evening walks. At sunset 
I could see you enter the chapel, could hear the bell, and follow 
you through every scene of business and amusement. How is 
it at Middlebury ? You have there too, I suppose, vocations, 
and walks, and chapels, and bells. But I know nothing of 
them ; tell me, therefore. 

It was a part of our original plan of correspondence, I think, 
to inform each other of our studies. I have no great feats in 
that way to recount at present. In Boston, I was not altogether 
idle, but my reading was mostly appropriate to my profession. 
Gifford's Juvenal I looked at, and Gibbon's Life and posthumous 

works by Sheffield ; Moore's Travels in Italy and France ; 
Paley's Natural Theology, and a few others. Natural Theology 
is an ingenious little thing. Giftbrd's Juvenal is worth perusing 
on more accounts than one, though I believe that work is 
daubed with too much indiscriminate praise. GifTord was certainly a very accomplished scholar, was originally the tenant of 
an easy seat, with three legs, in vulgar dialect called a shoemaker's bench. But he ran away from his leather apron and 
his lapstone, and fled to Parnassus. Gibbon's Life is the history of a Deist. He was, as I think, a learned, proud, ingenious, 
foppish, vain, self-deceived man. If unbelief be a crime, how 
criminal is he who exercises talents and learning to infuse it 
into his own heart ? Gibbon, from Protestant connections and 
family, deserted to the faith of the church of Rome, and thence 
to the faith of Tom Paine. 

Our friends, dear Merrill, are every day disappearing. Alas, 
poor Gilbert ! The herds of the valley graze the turf that lies 
upon thy bosom ! But Merrill and Webster will preserve thy 
memory in the urn of their hearts. 

Adieu, my good friend ; write me forthwith, I pray you. If 
this letter is dull and insipid, impute it to dull weather, headache, east wind, or any thing else, so you hold me faultless. 

Yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, May 16, 1805. 

DEAR ZEKE, This will be handed you by Mr. French ; if you 
have any thing to send to me, he will bring it. I was at Salisbury yesterday. The family are well as usual. Father is desirous you should write to him and you must do so forthwith. 

Adieu, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I greatly need a few small blank books, which Mr. 
Parker prepared for me. 

18* 


MISS SALLY WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, May 25, 1805. 

DEAR BROTHER, What can be the reason of my not receiving 
any letters from you for so long a time ? Are you so much 
confined in your school, that you have not time to write, or can 
it be that you are so much delighted with the people of Boston, 
as to forget your friends in the country ? No ; I cannot think 
that to be the case. I would rather impute your neglect in 
writing to hurry of business, want of conveyance, or any thing 
than want of friendship. 

You will conclude by the date of this letter tfrat I am at 
Boscawen. I left home one week since, and left your friends 
well. Father's health is much better than it was last winter, 
and I hope that, by proper care, he will yet be able to attend to 
business for years to come. Joseph expects to go up country 
this summer to buy him a farm, which I think will be the best 
thing he can do. Daniel is at the other end of the room, filling 
a blank ; he looks very pleasant. I suppose he intends to get a 
dollar for it, towards the eighty he has lost. It has been 
remarked by some one that a bad beginning makes a good end ; 
if that is the case, I think he will undoubtedly have a good end. 

Uncle Webster's family are well, and some of them employed 
in the business of instructing youth, which I think must be very 
agreeable. Nath'l is keeping school at the Corner. Polly 
begins next week at Danbury. Ruth is expected to keep in 
some part of town. Betsey Quinby is to begin a school next 
week in N. Chester; L. T. somewhere else. So you see we 
have instructors as plenty as in Boston. I wish you to let me 
know when you expect to come home. 

Miss R. Fifield expects to spend, I understand, some part of 
the summer in Boston with her brother, which I think will be a 
very pleasant thing for a young lady. 

Do, Ezekiel, write me a letter by the next mail after you 
receive this, if you think it worth answering, and consider that 
letters from you are not only pleasing but instructive ; be assured that no person would more gladly receive instruction 
than your sister, 

SALLY WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, May 19, 1805. 

DEAR DANIEL, Before Mr. French had given me your letter, 
I had forwarded your trunk, with the blank books you so much 
need for the entry of your fourteen actions. When Mr. Parker 
consented to send you the books, I called on Mr. Thacher, as 
you directed, and requested of him the favor of his signature, 
with mine, to a note of one hundred dollars, to Mr. Parker. He 
consented to do it with pleasure, and very politely went with me 
to Mr. Parker ; but the latter did not wish it ; so I gave him my 
note for the sum, on demand. 

Mr. Thacher sent me a book directed to you. I fancy it is 
" Democracy naked." You may guess the design, if he has not 
mentioned it in his letter. I had the honor to dine with Mr. 
Emerson, and he made particular inquiry concerning you, and 
added that you write very handsomely. Mr. Fifield goes on 
Friday to Salisbury ; I shall write to father by him, and likewise to yourself. Let me hear from you often, and know whenever you have swelled the number of your entries to fifteen. 
Every particular will be pleasing. 

Just meeting-time ; farewell. E. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, May 30, 1805. 

THE letter sent by Miss Fuller, will fully compensate for the 
negligence alleged in your complaint against me. If you charge 
me again, I shall put in what I believe, in law, is called a rebutter. Yesterday was election. For clerk of the House, Tillinghast had 175 votes ; C. P. Sumner had 146 ; T. Bigelow had, 
for Speaker, 169 ; P. Morton, 151. The last vote was the best 
test of the strength of the parties. The Federalists had a 
majority of eighteen. The whole number in the House, was 324. 
Otis was declared President of the Senate. This morning they 
fill the senatorial vacancy for the county of York. Had the 
votes been legally returned from the little town of Shapleigh, 
Heath would have been chosen Lieutenant Governor. As these 
votes will probably be rejected, the choice will devolve on the 
Legislature. When Mr. Parker gave me the books, he said you 
had taken a bill of them, and was to leave it with me for him 
to sign, when I took the books. You probably have it among 
some of your papers. 1 called, however, for a new one this 
morning, and was unable to get it seasonably for this communication, on account of his absence. The business of Mr. Thacher 
has, before this time, explained itself; and the weather-bound 
letters have arrived. Do you find any business that ever calls 
you to Concord ? Write soon. E. WEBSTER. 

Sally will have a letter from me immediately. I am under 
an engagement this morning, which prevents my writing to her 
by Mr. Fuller. E. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Sunday, June, 1805. 

DEAR ZEKE, I got home alive last evening, although most 
killed by hot weather ; have not seen our folks, but hear they are 
well. Pray send me a pair of gaiters like Fifield's. In going 
to church to-day, I felt that man is dust, and can think of 
nothing to guard against sand better than they do. 

Adieu, which is a very affectionate term from the French a dieu, 
and is synonymous with, " I commend you to God." 

Mr. French keeps at French's. D. W. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, July 10, 1805. 

GOOD DANIEL, Your letter by Mr. French was given to me at 
half-past ten o'clock on the day on which Mr. French was to leave 
town at eleven. I roamed about town till twelve o'clock, to find 
the said gaiters, but could not hear of any ; nor have I been able 
since to see any in the shops. I shall keep them in remembrance, 
and the first pair that is to be bought, shall be sent to you. We 

had two orations in this town. French, I am told, is a young 
tallow-chandler in this place. His oration, of course, must have 
been warm and fluent. I fancy his eloquence bordered a little 
on that species which the rhetoricians call the oily or smooth. 
Tell me what was done at Salisbury, and in what manner. 
The bell is now tolling for the funeral of Mrs. Howe, the former 
owner of Rowe's pasture, adjoining my school-house. It is in 
contemplation to erect a market there, for the convenience of the 
people at the south part of the town. I am determined, I think 
unalterably, to leave my school in April. Look about you a 
little, and see where there is a good place for me in New Hampshire. It is probable that I shall leave town about the time in 
which I leave my school. Is Grace in Salisbury, and is B. attentive to her ? Do you go to Commencement ? I shall send 
you Button's oration, if I see the man who carries the letter. I 
did not hear it, nor have I read it. It was said not to be very 
extraordinary. Let me know if Chandler is in town for I want 
to write to him. 

I am yours, in haste, 

EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, July 28, 1805. 

DEAR ZEKE, If I have not written you for some weeks, it is 
not owing to pressure of business, want of remembrance, or any 
other describable cause. It is one of those omissions which 
occur in life without bringing with them any color of excuse, 
and for which we offer no apology, because we wrongly think 
them unimportant. 

In the history of myself, I believe my last chapter left me just 
arrived from Boston. Shortly after, the 4th of July appeared, 
and I made my bow and my speech to the Salisburians. Both 
parties celebrated the day, and Mr. Pettingill entertained his 
Democratic friends with an oration on the Centre road. The 
Federalists dined at Rogers's ; the Democrats, at Caleb 
Gushing' s. Shortly after 4th July, I began to wane in health, 
and am now quite out of sorts ; able, however, to keep about 
and perform all the business I can find. 
I shall make about as many entries at the next courts as I 
expected to ; perhaps a few more. I pick up, however, but very 
little cash, hardly laying my hand upon a dollar. 

What shall we do with Parker? The folks at Salisbury 
enjoy about their usual health, and things there remain in statu. 
Fifield's father and mother were at South road, the 4th, and 
very well. James Brackett spent a day with me last week ; he 
is gone to Londonderry, and perhaps to Boston. Chandler is 
not in town, and is not expected until Commencement. 

This will be left in the post-office by Mr. Dix ; you will probably find him at Wyman's, and he will bring any communications you may wish to make, as also my gaiters, &c. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

N. B. Do you think that Dr. Perkins would loan us fifty 
dollars, for Parker, till September ? 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, August 1, 1806. 

GOOD DANIEL, Mr. Dix very politely handed me your letter. 
Your ill health is a sufficient excuse for not writing. I should 
have written myself before this, but waited, expecting to receive 
a letter from you, by every mail. 

You will be glad to hear that the health of the inhabitants of 
this town is as good as it has been for many years. There is 
no case of yellow fever, or any other epidemic. Its appearance 
in Providence and New Haven alarmed the people here very 
much, and called forth some pretty rigorous and necessary regulations from the board of health. Favorable official communications from those places, have induced the board to admit 
travellers from them, without subjecting them to the process of 
purification. I have sent you a pair of gaiters. There were none 
for sale ; but Mr. F. was so kind as to part with his. Mr. Thacher 
wished me to mention to you, when I should write, that he had 
looked for something from you. I can hardly tell what shall be 
done for Mr. Parker. I will make an attempt ; and if I can get 
thirty or forty dollars, I will pay them to him. You observe a 

smart quill war between P. and H. The latter appears most 
valorous when writing a paragraph in the Chronicle office. I 
am so languid and indolent this afternoon that I cannot fill the 
next page. Write soon. God bless you. 

E. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, August 9, 1805. 

DEAR ZEKE, Mr. Fletcher having failed and shut up, it seems 
probable that something will now be done about the clerkship. 
Mr. F. is in your favor, and we shall endeavor to make matters 
work at September court. 

The legislature have diminished the fees somewhat ; but it is 
now worth one thousand dollars per annum. Write me by Mr. 
French, without fail, whether you wish it. 

D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, August 14, 1805. 

DANIEL, When I heard of Fletcher's failure, I concluded that 
there was, on that account, less probability of a vacancy in the 
clerkship. In answering your question, I hardly know what to 
say. I should wish it, if I considered that I might do better 
than in a profession. In that office, you know, a man stands on 
a mine which may be sprung at any moment. In a profession, 
he is on a little surer ground. When the storm beats he can 
buffet it. Men must be sick ; and they will be dishonest ; and 
the few upright will want lawyers to protect them from rogues, 
and physicians to heal their maladies. The fees of the clerk may 
be frittered down, till they bear no proportion to the labors to be 
performed. These are the considerations which suggest themselves to me, on thinking of the clerkship ; I mean, in thinking 
of its dark side. On the other hand, a thousand dollars step up 
and demand for themselves much consideration. Another circumstance of considerable weight is, that it might be three or 
four years before I shall be able to do any thing, if ever, in the 
practice of the law. In the office, the emoluments will be immediately consequent upon the earning of them. In law, we 
let out, on interest, the study of Coke, &c. &c. What part of 
my time will the business of the office occupy, and where must 
the office be kept ? The answers to these questions would have 
some influence upon my determination. The conclusion of the 
whole matter, in my own mind, is perplexing. You know the 
whole ground better than myself. If you and father think it 
best for me to seek it, I shall think so, and thank you for any 
assistance you may afford. 

I am as ever, yours, 

E. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

September 15, 1805. 

DANIEL, I take a little from this day, to write you. Perhaps 
you have heard alarming stories respecting the health of this 
place. It is indeed pretty sickly among children, but not more 
so than usual among grown people. No case of yellow fever has 
occurred. Private letters say it is very malignant in New York, 
and considerably so in Philadelphia. I have enjoyed always 
perfect health since I wrote you. I was one evening quite 
sick, took an emetic, and in the morning was well ; never less 
languid and weak at this season of the year. 

I have heard Mr. Nott preach this morning. I cannot say of 
him as my dear Cicero said of Archias, the expectation formed 
of him was great, and he surpassed it. He is, however, a man 
of abilities, and a scholar. The object of his discourse was to 
prove the resurrection of our Saviour. His subject did not admit of much embellishment. He managed it very ingeniously, 
and argued like a man who had not learned his logic from the 
syllogisms of Watts. 

I saw, in the Chronicle, a puff for Mr. Langdon and the legislature, in granting aid to Dartmouth College. Will you give me 
a few facts respecting it ? Did not Langdon oppose every petition offered while he was in the House ? Did he not object to 
the judges of the Supreme Court being a committee to report 

the expediency of giving assistance ? Did he not, when that 
committee had reported one thousand dollars, vote for Dr. L.'s 
motion to have it five hundred? What was the late grant? 
Had he any official business in it ? Will you, if convenient, 
give me answers to these questions ? Langdon's speech, and 
Colman's anecdotes of Bradley, do not seem to make the people 
in this place think him worthy of their late honors. I saw a few 
remarks, made in the Gazette, respecting them. Did Bradley 
ever have a college education ? Will you tell me, too, how the 
thing happened ? Did J. T. consent ? 

Should you go within ten or twenty miles of Hanover, it 
would be well to call there and have the few old books we have, 
put into a chest, which I believe is in Jarvis's room, and sent 
home. 

I often see Mr. Thacher, and he as often inquires for you. 
He expects something from you, at least a letter. 

If the letter I wrote you in Latin frightened you, only tell 
me and I never will write you another. Pray, pray send me a 
letter soon, and tell our folks you have had this from me. 

In my next, I shall be able to let you know when I shall be at 
Salisbury. 

I am yours, EZEK. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, October 17, 1805. 

I DO assure you, Daniel, I was serious in stating to you the 
reasons for my not coming to Salisbury. I thought you in 
earnest in requesting it ; and I was in hopes that the inconveniences I mentioned, would appear as formidable to you and 
the family, as they did to me. I have no reason to think I was 
hypochondriacal when I wrote that letter ; that a sickly imagination swelled molehills into mountains ; or that indolence cried, 
" Behold a lion in the way." I wanted to see the family and 
yourself, and I thought that you wished to see me. 

I believe your situation to be distressing enough ; but I do 
not know how I could help you, if I were present. As to arVOL. i. 19 
rangements to be made, I know of none but to pay the debts, 
and make the family as comfortable as we can. 

A few days after I wrote you, Mr. Parker called at my schoolhouse and told me that he wanted the remainder of my note of 
one hundred dollars. I borrowed thirty and gave him. He 
said he expected the rest to be paid this month, and wished you' 
to settle your notes with him within the same time. I understand Mr. P. to mean, that he is obliged to make out some 
money at that time, and that he depends upon receiving all the 
money due from you and me. From this statement you can 
judge, as well as myself, what sum will answer for him. I can 
only say, God bless you ; for I fear Mr. White will leave town 
before I can deliver this to him.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, November 15, 1805. 

DEAR ZEKE, I should be inexpressibly gratified if you would 
accompany Nat. into this quarter. But there will be so many 
folks in the chaise with him, I suppose it will be inconvenient. 
Besides, as there is nobody in Boston that can read or write 
except yourself, it will be next to impossible for you to leave 
your school. 

Again, as there is no stage-coach running on any part of the 
road from Boston here, no chaises passing, and not a horse in 
the country, nobody knows how you will get back again. 

With affection, but in despair of ever seeing you, 

Yours, &c. D. W. 

N. B. Forty dollars enclosed for Mr. Parker ; I wish you to 
tell him, I hope to get his Carrigain money early next month. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Boscawen, December 7, 1805. 

DEAR HERVEY, You and I hear of each other as seldom as 
if we were in different kingdoms. This is not as it should be. 
We are not kings, nor emperors, nor presidents, and therefore 
have not such a pressure of state affairs on our hands, as to 
afford an excuse for neglect of private friendship. Nor is either 
of us, that I know of, in love up to desperation ; and as to myself, I can say safely, that writ-making does not in toto absorb 
me. Wherefore it seems proper for us to point our pens again, 
and to scribble and figure away on paper, as in time of old. 

I have been thinking you would visit the Legislature at 
Portsmouth, and come this way. I should press this point, if I 
was not going to Boston. About the 22d instant, I shall be, I 
expect at Portsmouth, and why may I not find you there ? We 
will stroll round town a day or three together, then you shall 
come to Boscawen and see Counsellor Webster's office, &c., 
and the Counsellor and Barrister Bingham will have many 
learned conversations, &c., all tending to the benefit of society. 
Say will you come, most noble Barrister ? 

Enclosed are two shot, which I wish you to discharge by 
means of your Shrieve, and send the same to me by mail before 
Amherst Court. If you cannot go to Portsmouth, write me the 
very next mail. 

Holloa ! A client. Good-bye. Yours with undiminished love 
and tenderness, D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Boscawen, January 19, 1806. 

DEAR OLD FRIEND, I now sit down to give you some account 
of myself; a thing which I have long neglected, and which, like 
other accounts, swells rapidly by being let alone. I have no 
expectation of redeeming by this letter the vacuity and nothingness of the last I wrote you, which, when nihilities shall all be 
collected and classed, will hold a conspicuous rank. 

In truth, I have observed an oyster-like silence, which would 
be very laudable towards my enemies ; absque hoc, that you are 
one of that number. I now mean to treat you with a course of 
epistles, thick at least, if not charming, and to make my winter 
evenings pleasant, at the expense perhaps of the pleasure and 
tranquillity of yours. 

Since I last saw James H. Bingham, I have passed through a 
variety of scenes, if scenes they can be called which affect only 
an individual. It is now eight months since I opened an office 
in this town, during which time I have led a life which I know 
not how to describe better than by calling it a life of writs and 
summonses. Not that I have dealt greatly in those articles, but 
that I have done little else. My business has been just about 
so, so ; its quantity less objectionable than its quality. I shall 
be able at the end of the year to pay my bills, and pay perhaps 
sixty pounds for my books. I practise in Hillsborough, Rockingham, and Grafton. Scattering business over so much surface 
is like spilling water on the ground. In point of profit I should 
do better, much better, if it were convenient to attend the courts 
in one county only. So much for business. Now as to fame. In 
this point I am rather waning. When I was in college, Bliss, 
and the Smiths, and Crowel used to come to me to correct their 
themes, and I thought myself a promising character ; my creditors thought so also. At present, I believe I am in the rear of 
them all. Of the Smiths, one I hear is a minister, and one a 
major. Yes, Wm. Coit is a major. Bliss is stuck on to the 
side of the great hill, that lies between you and me, and certainly 
holds a more elevated station than I can boast. I make no 
poetry ; five lines to D. Abbott are the Alpha and the Omega 
of my poetical labors for a year. In this particular, however, I 
mean to reform. How would it do, think ye, to write writs in 
verse? For instance, let one be clausum in his verbis, that is to 
say, being interpreted, wrapt up in these words : 

All good sheriffs in the land, 

We command, 
That forthwith you arrest John Dyer, 

Esquire, 
If in your precinct you can find him, 

And bind him, &c., &c., &c. 

If the legislature will but put our writs into a poetical and 
musical form, it will certainly be the most harmonious thing 

they ever did, and you and I shall like them vastly better than 
we do now. 

In the next place, as to politics. Here my lips are glued. I 
live in a family who think differently from me on political questions, and it is therefore decent to be silent. They are charitable 
enough, however, to tolerate my errors, and I, at length, feel no 
restraint arising from the propriety of being silent ; though you 
know there is a great regeneration to be wrought before I shall 
feel democratically. Last year I wrote a political pamphlet in 
two days, which I have had the pleasure of seeing kicked about 
under many tables. But you are one of the very few who 
know the author of the Appeal to the Old Whigs. Keep the 
precious secret. 

Now, having told you all about my business, my fame, and 
my politics, there is but one point more to be discussed before I shall have completed the account of myself ; and that one 
point is love. On this head, which, like a good many other 
heads, is rather barren, I can at present say nothing only that I 
am not married, and seriously am inclined to think I never shall 
be. The example of my friends sometimes excites me, and certain narratives I hear of you, induce me to inquire why the 
deuce female flesh and blood was not made for me as well as 
others ; but reasons, good or bad, suppress hope and stifle incipient resolution. 

Thus far I have dilated on that dear, precious, ever present, and 
ever unexhausted subject, self. I thought proper to give you the 
above description, because our correspondence has been so long 
intermitted, that though you are acquainted with my " rise and 
progress," you might yet know nothing of my " present state." 

Three weeks since, this day, I dined in Boston, at the table 
of Mr. Thacher, and in company with Mr. Buckminster. They 
inquired very particularly after you. Pray, James, why do you 
never visit Boston ? You would certainly find it for your interest, 
as well as amusement, to extend your acquaintance there. If 
you feel what I feel, the burden of perpetual solitude and seclusion, you would sometimes run away eagerly to the busy haunts 
of men. Since I returned from Boston, I have attended the 
Common Pleas at Portsmouth. Your old and valued friend, 
Saltonstall, was there ; he is growing to be quite unwieldy in 
size, but has good-nature in proportion. A large man, who is 
19* 
surly, is a frightful thing, and the species ought to take arms 
against him. Lawrence is settled in Epping; you probably 
remember him, which, inter nos, is not requiring of your memory 
to retain much. 

Solon, your cousin, seems fast rising into business and reputation ; he is an intelligent, gentlemanly man. I believe he 
studies, and have no doubt he will succeed to every rational 
expectation. Study is truly the grand requisite for a lawyer. 
Men may be born poets, and leap from their cradle painters ; 
nature may have made them musicians, and called on them 
only to exercise, and not to acquire, ability. But law is artificial. It is a human science to be learnt, not inspired. Let 
there be a genius for whom nature has done so much as apparently to have left nothing for application, yet to make a lawyer, 
application must do as much as if nature had done nothing. 
The evil is, that an accursed thirst for money violates everything. 
We cannot study, because we must pettifog. We learn the 
low recourses of attorneyism, when we should learn the conceptions, the reasonings, and the opinions of Cicero and Murray. 
The love of fame is extinguished ; every ardent wish for knowledge repressed ; conscience put in jeopardy, and the best feelings of the heart indurated, by^ the mean, money-catching, 
abominable practices, which cover with disgrace a part of the 
modern practitioners of the law. The love of money is the 
ruling passion of this country. It has taken root deeply, and I 
fear will never be eradicated. While this holds everything in 
its gripe, America will produce few great characters. We have 
no patronage for genius ; no reward for merit. The liberal professions are resorted to, not to acquire reputation and consequence, but to get rich. Money is the chief good ; every eye 
is on it ; every heart sighs for it. When the day will come 
when these things shall be ordered better, you and I cannot tell, 
but will hope that it will come some time. Our profession is 
good if practised in the spirit of it ; it is damnable fraud and 
iniquity, when its true spirit is supplied by a spirit of mischiefmaking and money-catching. 

I have looked to see you this way this winter. Shall you not 
come ? Will it be easy for you, if you cannot come, to attend 
Amherst Court in March ? Pray invent some way wherein I 
may have the pleasure of seeing my ancient and honorable 

friend. I never hear from Fanny. Alas ! Poor girl, if you live, 
I pity your sufferings, and if your sufferings are over, my heart 
shall embalm your memory ! If you know any thing about this 
interesting object of regard and compassion, pray impart the 
knowledge to me. Make my respectful compliments to your 
father when you see him ; he has probably nearly forgotten me. 
Six winters ago, you and I were together in his house. What 
a considerable portion of human life is six years ; and yet how 
short the retrospect ! 

Adieu, my dear friend. Yours affectionately, 

D. W. 



Boscawen, January 12, 1807. 

DEAR M'GAW, You call yourself such hard names in your 
letter that I begin to think they are well applied. I was entirely 
unsuspicious before, but I know nothing against your credit as 
a witness, and if you affirm that you are a " lazy scoundrel," the 
point must be considered as proved. But I forgive you, fully, 
freely, frankly. A man that hath both a fame to regard, a purse 
to regard, and a wife to regard, must be excused from any particular attention to his friends. A wife, I take it, reverently be 
it spoken, is like a burning-glass, which concentrates every ray 
of affection that emanates from a husband's heart. We single 
dogs have attachments which are dispersed over society, our 
friendships are scattered all over the world, and we love at a 
thousand places at the same moment ; but you husbands carry 
all your wares to the same market. You have one bank, in 
which you deposit all your tender sentiments, wherefore I hold 
you all pardonable for forgetting your friends. Now all this is 
very pretty ; but while I thus philosophize, my heart is in my 
throat, and tells me at every syllable that I lie. It tells me that 
its attachment to any one object, however ardent, however near 
approaching to adoration, could never sever the ties that hold it 
to its friends, and that in the commerce of affection there can 
be no monopoly ; it rebels against the doctrine of concentration 
aforesaid, and kicks the business of the burning-glass to the devil. 
However, these things are all mysteries to us, the uninitiated, 
and it is presumption to reason about them. You husbands, 
happy race, could, if you would, tell us all about it. But I have 
said I forgive you, and though you were ten times more guilty 
than you are, yet, I being your confessor, either with or without 
reason, your sins would all be absolved. In August last, I was 
at the old place of our friendship, Fryeburg. I have no other 
sorrow for your leaving that town, than that you are so much 
further from the spot of earth I live on. And even this sorrow is diminished by my ignorance of the place which may 
hereafter be burdened by me. At present, my mind is not entirely easy at the idea of being long here. But habit, you know, 
does great things. And while I think little of any removal, I 
say nothing. Parker and wife are as comfortable as fancy can 
feign. When I call of an evening, I find them as snug and 
close as " Will and Mary, on the coin." Brother Eastman lost 
his wife of a consumption in November ; he is becoming a gay 
yourtg spark again. Mr. Thompson left his family at Salisbury, 
South Road, while he passes his winter, for the last time at 
present, as they say at the theatre, at the city of Washington. 
New Hampshire is precisely what you saw it last, and if I 
were to write till my fingers ached, I doubt whether I could give 
you an item that you would give a fig to know. The little 
quotation which you copied into yours, fresh from the lips of 
somebody, who stood at your elbow while you wrote, I was 
very much pleased with. I protest I think it the most eloquent 
little saying I have met with. Will you be pleased to ascertain 
how much of my love it is lawful for me to send to your wife, 
and when you have settled the quantity to a scruple, I pray you 
give it to Phebe, with the lowest bow you can make. 

I am, dear Sir, very sincerely your friend and obedient servant, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. If you should be at Merrimac, let me hear of it. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MERRILL. 

Boscawen, March 8, 1807. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Yours of February 13, accompanied by 
your election sermon, were duly received. I pray you, accept 
my most hearty thanks for both. How happy, my good friend, 
am I when the tedium of business is relieved by a communication of this sort. And I am more abundantly grateful, if the 
communication is a little moral or serious, because I am happy 
to have my mind called back from the pursuit of ordinary affairs 
to a contemplation of serious things. 

As to your sermon, I cannot say what I think of it without 
seeming to flatter you. When I took it up, I took my pen 
determined to mark such passages " as pleased me." I assure 
you I have blurred and blotted you pretty well. Page 10 contains some paragraphs of excellent ideas ; pages 14, 15, 16, and 
17, are favorites with me. The comparison between Rome and 
JEtna, page 21, is entirely new, and, I think, highly striking and 
just. 

It is indeed alarming, that private character weighs nothing 
in the scale of qualification for public office : as if a man had 
two hearts ; a deceitful, depraved, wicked one towards his neighbor ; an honest, pure, godly one toward his country ! I cannot 
indulge myself in reflections on the growth of this and a thousand other pernicious sentiments among us, without falling into 
the horrors. Indeed, I fear that our country is growing corrupt 
at a rate which distances the speed of every other. I do not 
say that the degree of positive corruption at present is so great, 
but the course towards total depravity is swift. Nevertheless, 
you say truly, " The Lord reigneth ; " and while I write that 
sentence, I feel a consolation in my heart which I would not exchange for the sceptre of Bonaparte. You observe, " that however melancholy prospects may be in this country, they are far 
worse in Europe." I thought you were going to say, " they are 
bright in heaven." As to any human exertions being able 
to rectify the disordered affairs of this world, it is all out of the 
question. Empires are crushed in a day. All that is ancient, 
all that is venerable, all that is valued in Europe, is overwhelmed 
by the mighty torrent of French power. Yet so did Cyrus, and 
so may God do, by means of any instruments, and you and I 
will endeavor, with his assistance, to rely on his protection. 

The times are such I am surprised at nothing. If, before I 
rise from my table, I should learn that Bonaparte is in London, 
it would not astonish me. I am persuaded that a great revolution is taking place, not only in Europe, but through the world. 
Society is deeply shaken everywhere. The minds of men are 
flying from all steadfast principles, like an arrow from the bow. 
Principles are called prejudices, and duty, scrupulosity. Where 
all this will end, you and I cannot tell. May we at all times 
have grace to say, with honest and sincere hearts, " Father in 
heaven, thy will be done." 

I rejoice that you have so comfortable a cage. A bird you 
cannot but find easily. Your friend Webster has neither cage 
nor bird. However, he lives in hopes. 

I have no very great objections to sending you a copy of my 
Phi Beta Kappa speech; a small one, however, is, that not being 
printed I should be obliged to write it off. You must not disappoint us next Commencement. A journey over the mountain 
will do you no injury. Pray do not fail. When I have better 
health than at present, for you must know I am quite out of 
health, I will, I think, write you a better letter. 

In the mean time remind me of the promise. 

Adieu, D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. FULLER. 

Portsmouth, December 2, 1807. 
DEAR SIR, I have received yours of the 27th November, and 

will regard its contents. 

#****** 

I agree with you that it is strange we have not interchanged 
letters oftener. 

If you have an excuse, in the pressure of family matters, I am 
clearly without one. I have not feasted the appetite of my eyes 
on the Paragon this long time. Yet I can well believe all you 
say of her, for I know you observe such things nicely. 

I like very much your notion of coming this way with Mrs. 

Fuller. If the fates are propitious, I hope I shall be able to 
afford you a shelter, in a year or two. I have been a young dog 
long enough, and now think of joining myself, as soon as convenient, to that happy and honorable society of which you are 
one ; the society of married men. Can I do better"? 

I think when I saw you last I was about removing to this 
place. As yet I have little opportunity of forming any opinion 
of my prospects ; in short, I do not regard prospects ! 

I am made up in my opinion to stay, and therefore, what I 
should see to be before me, would not alter my resolution. I 
do not look out, therefore, lest I should not be pleased with the 
view. 

In all sorts of weather, however, I am and always shall be, 
Your obed't serv't, 

D. WEBSTER. 

I like the alteration of your name. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Portsmouth, February 27, 1808. 

DEAR BINGHAM, " Friendship, like love, is destroyed by long 
absence, though it may be increased by short intermissions." I 
this moment read this sentence in one of the numbers of The 
idler, and as I read, the idea of my old friend Hervey rushed 
into my mind. 

What a horrible thing it is, my dear friend, that I have neither 
heard from you nor written to you for twelve months. How is 
it that our lips have been sealed so long ? I would not have 
believed such a thing could happen, though ten wise men had 
foretold it. But so it is. When busied about many things, the 
mind is easily persuaded to defer until to-morrow that which 
there is no pressing necessity of doing to-day. 

Since I have seen you and written you, I have changed my 
residence from Boscawen to this place. Some brief narration 
of my life since June, 1806, seems necessary to bring up the 
view of the present, so that we may go on in the old way of 
correspondence; for if ever I neglect writing you so long a 
time again, I shall have lost my senses. 
My business at Boscawen was tolerable, but not altogether 
to my mind. A little money might be made there, but no pleasure of a social sort enjoyed. My brother Ezekiel was admitted to the bar in September last, and to him I made an offer of 
my office. The truth is, our family affairs at Salisbury rendered 
it necessary for one of us to reside in that neighborhood, and 
not being very willing to take charge of the farm, I concluded 
to indorse over to my brother both farm and office, if he would 
take both together. Being thus left ,to seek a new place of 
abode, I came to this town, a measure which I had in some degree contemplated for a length of time. I found myself here the 
latter part of September. I knew few people here, and Mr. 
Adams was the only person who advised to the measure. 

Hitherto, I have done as much business as I ought to expect. 
There are eight or nine of us who fill writs, in town. Of course 
my share cannot be large, even if I should take my equal dividend. On the whole, however, I am satisfied that I did right to 
come, and suppose shall meet as much success as I deserve. I 
have a pleasant room, in a good situation ; have made some 
additions to my library, which is, nevertheless, yet very small ; 
have some pleasant acquaintances in town, and time rolls along 
pretty agreeably ; "jam satis est." I will expatiate no further 
on that endearing subject, self. Now, my dear Bingham, a little 
account from you, to balance this, would be truly a precious 
morsel, and I trust I shall not long be without it. Mr. Stevens, 
your cousin, I see often, and the oftener I see the better I like 
him. He boards with me, when here, and we have become a 
good deal acquainted. He tells me many things of you which 
I am fond of hearing. Among the good people of Alstead, I 
know you must be esteemed, and I fancy with the bad you will 
not be unpopular. 

Pray write me a long epistle, and in the mean time give my 
love to the amiable P y. 

I am, dear James, with undiminished affection, your friend, 

D. WEBSTER. 

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

(EXTRACT.) 

Portsmouth, March 3, 1808. 

DEAR E. I am just now distressed for some Hillsborough 
blanks. I must have twenty. If you send a coach with them, 
let me have that number by next Wednesday. It would seem 
a small business to send a boy down upon, but it is of very considerable consequence to me to have them, and if they cannot 
come otherwise, despatch J. Oilman, not telling him or any 
body what the business is. 

Money I have none ; I shall certainly be hanged before three 
weeks, if I cannot get some. What can be done ? 

Sue every body. I send the copy of the Peterson note. Sue 
young Doctor, without fail. Mr. Ladd, the bearer, is entitled 
to receive two hundred and ten dollars of J. Wilcox. Have 
you heard any thing about it ? 

Yours always, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I shall almost perish if I have not my twenty Hillsborough blanks by Wednesday night. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 
(EXTRACTS.) 

Portsmouth, March 9, 1808. 

DEAR SQUIRE, I have just been favored by the sight of Sir 
James Atkinson, Bart., convoying a few blanks, for which I arn 
much obliged to you. He brings but twenty-one, of which I 
shall take the greater part, and send you the lesser. 

#***### 

I have already got to the second item in my will ; expecting 
to be hanged, as I said ; but not quite so soon. I think I shall 
subsist until March. " Sue every body ; " that's the word. 

As to the Gunpowder, he is gone a journey ; if I have no earlier chance to send him, shall ride to Amherst, but think I shall 
send him sooner. 

Tell Nat. that I do not thank him for his love. It is like the 
priest's blessing ; if it were worth any thing he would not bestow 
VOL. i. 20 
it. If it were as valuable as ten minutes' time, I should not receive it, because he will not use so many minutes in writing to 
me. Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Hopkinton, May 5, 1808. 

I AVAIL myself of Mr. Adams's politeness to give you thanks 
for yours of April 17. I do not charge you with that species of 
flattery of which deceit makes any portion, but the partiality of 
your feelings leads you to* some rather warm and unjust opinions. I have nothing to charge against fortune, on the score of 
professional success, and yet I have nothing to boast, beyond the 
ordinary success of young men. I am earning a small living, 
and have long been convinced that I never shall be rich. 

Horace Hall, our friend, told me in March that some of your 
friends intended to nominate you for a county office, which 
he named. I imagine your happiness depends very little on 
any thing of that sort, although I believe the office to be gainful. I was once a candidate for a similar office. I was 
anxious to obtain it for some time. At length it was offered 
me ; but I had then grown sick of the scheme, and would not 
accept it. On the whole, I should advise you, if you should 
be invited to accept that office, to follow your feelings. If it 
will enable you to live in a more pleasant place, if it is pleasant 
to Madam, if it is more lucrative than your practice, all these 
things are in favor of acceptance. On the other hand, the 
duties are probably more irksome than professional practice, 
perhaps not more laborious, but probably more tedious. 

I am glad your list is so good. Your practice must be much 
above mediocrity, and I am sure that what you get you will 
hold. 

I had forgotten that I owed Mr. Temple, and now enclose you 
three dollars for him. 

Give my love to P. and assure her I should be extremely 
happy to see her, either in her present name or any other that 
she may choose to assume. 

I am, dear Hervey, yours, sincerely, 

D. WEBSTER. 

N. B. I forgot to tell you, that in June next, I contemplate 
to set my bachelor friends a laudable example. 

Excuse a blunder ; I write in court ; the region of blunders. 



NOTE. The last line refers to his having begun his letter on the second page 
of the sheet. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Portsmouth, March 2, 1810. 

DEAR ESQUIRE. 

******* 

Mr. K. writes that there is reason to fear that Boscawen will 
not be quite so Federal as last year. This will never do. Your 
characters are committed. Make Boscawen "toe the mark" 
once more, as nobly as last year. I cannot think you will fail 
in this respect. As to the Representative let that go easy. If 
the G.'s. and C.'s are disposed that you should go, go ; if not, 
altogether and heartily, stay. It would be weakening rather 
than increasing your personal influence, to go, unless it were 
nem. con. I should like, well enough, to gratify the good old 
Captain once. The time is nearly expired when we promised 
the Captain to take up his name. If he wishes it, it shall be 
done. Please see him immediately on the subject. Enoch G. 
of Canterbury, is the man I intend to obtain in his room. It 
would be expensive for me to go up on purpose. Will you, or 
can you, effect it for me ? Please inform me by next post. I 
must entreat your special attention to this. 

We must make one extra effort, this time, to bear down all 
vice and immorality. 

You may depend on hearing that we do our duty this way. 
For Reputation's sake do yours. 

Yours, &c., 

D. WEBSTER. 



PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

February, 1811. 

DEAR ESQUIRE, I send you the jalap, the gum opium, and 
some lemons, instead of oranges, of which there are none in 
town. If I can find any balsam-tolu, I will send it; as yet, 
have found none. 

Our court is yet in session ; this is Monday, the third week. 
I have no leisure at all. Am glad to hear your prospects are so 
good. Unless we are very much deceived, we shall do well. I 
do not think we shall get half ; but I do think we shall come 
within seventy-five. Indeed, it is not impossible we may get 
half. 

I am exceedingly alarmed about Sally. 1 The moment the 
court rises, I shall set out to see her, and, if possible, carry my 
wife. I hope you will attend her daily. Do not fail to write to 
me by next conveyance. If Mr. Wood does not come, put your 
letter into mail ; I shall get it Tuesday. 

We are all bustle adieu. May God, in his great mercy, 
preserve us and bless us, and our friends. 

Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Concord, Friday evening, 6 p. M. June 4, 1813. 

DEAR DANIEL, The great men of the realm met here Wednesday. For Speaker, T. W. Thompson, 106 ; C. Storer, 75 ; scattering, 2. H. Hutchinson, Clerk of the House ; Oliver Peabody, 
President of the Senate ; S. A. Kendal, Clerk. Chase and Taylor elected by the people. No choice of counsellors, in Grafton, 
(according to the report of the committee,) Colby and Merrill, 
the candidates. Mr. Gilman's plurality over P. 809. Some 
votes given for Mr. G. were not legally returned ; had they been, 
the plurality would have been as above ; it will now be less. 

His Excellency has been escorted this afternoon, from Pem
i A sister, Sarah Jane Webster, who not long afterwards died of a consumption. 

broke, by a more respectable and numerous escort than Concord 
ever witnessed, under the direction of Marshall s W. Webster, 
and H. G. Cilley. At this moment the bells are ringing and 
cannon firing, in demonstration of the people's joy. Thirsty, 
wearied, and covered with dust, I am now writing. At a previous meeting, Tuesday evening, it was unanimously agreed to 
support Upham, for Speaker ; he, however, declined. To-morrow morning, ten o'clock, we go into the choice of Senator. 
Mr. Goddard our first choice ; if he declines, Jeremiah Mason 
will certainly be the man. You may depend on this. It will be 
so. 

I have given you good news enough for one letter. Pray 
write me often and long. 

Yours, in love, 

E. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Washington, June 4, 1813. 

DEAR BINGHAM, I have nothing in the world to say to you 
of any importance ; but after struggling with my conscience 
for some time on the point, I cannot make that out to be a 
good apology for not writing. It is sometimes important to 
know that nothing important can be told. In our political 
capacity, we, that is, the House of Representatives, have done 
little or nothing. The time for us to be put on the stage and 
moved by the wires, has not yet come. I suppose the " show " is 
now in preparation, and at the proper time the farce of legislating 
will be exhibited. I do not mean to say that the "projects" 
will not be opposed, as far as may be, nor is it certain that all 
the Democrats will "hang together," on the great subject of 
taxes; but before any thing is attempted to be done here, it 
must be arranged elsewhere. 

Thus far the weather has been comfortable, and so long as 
one keeps within doors, the heat is not oppressive. Much walking, however, is not practicable, especially as there are few trees 
in this city, to keep off the sun. We have the advantage of you, 
in a better ro'om to sit in, in having less to do, and in the means 
of acquaintance with a greater variety of characters. You have 
20* 
over us the advantage of having a majority on your side, as 1 
trust ; the prospect of a short session ; the hope of doing some 
good, and a little society, pleasantly mixed, instead of the unvarying masculinity of our circles here. A few ladies, indeed, are 
to be seen by going to the weekly rout at the palace ; but they 
are there only as so many curiosities rarce aves fit for all the 
purposes of social life, save only the unimportant particulars of 
speaking and being spoken to. I understand that in the winter 
session, when there are more ladies in the city, the aforesaid evil 
is in some degree mitigated. I have been to the levee or drawing room, but once. It is a mere matter of form. You make 
your bow to Mrs. Madison, and to Mr. M., if he comes in your 
way, but he being there merely as a guest, is not officially 
entitled to your cong6. Monsieur Serurier, Madame Bonaparte, the Russian Minister, heads of departments, and tails 
of departments, members of congress, &c., &c., here and there, 
interspersed with military and naval hat and coat, make up the 
group. You stay from five minutes to an hour, as you please ; 
eat and drink what you can catch, without danger of surfeit, 
and if you can luckily find your hat and stick, then take French 
leave ; and that's going to the " levee." 

Yours, with great esteem, 

D. W. 

I hope you will be mindful of us while you are at Concord. 
Very little of the proceedings of our general court, you know, 
ordinarily get into the papers. We shall, of course, be much 
dependent on the communications of our friends. If any thing 
should occur here, seeming to be interesting or important, I shall 
remember you. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Saturday, June 5, 1813. 

DEAR DANIEL, I wrote you last evening, giving some account of our doings. We have not done much to-day, save 
choosing a Senator in Congress. I imagine I shall be able to 
write you on Monday evening, and inform you whether Dr. Goddard accepts or declines. In case of the latter, we shall proceed 

anew, in the choice, and shall elect Mr. Mason. Of this I am 
confident. It must be so. 

The judiciary and the election bills are now before the committees. Mr. Oilman has been qualified to-day, and has made 
his speech. 

I have been told the President's message has a pacific aspect 
in the apprehension of many Federalists, in this quarter. I think 
it very warlike. If he has given the basis on which the treaty 
is to be made, under the Russian mediation, there can be no 
hopes of a treaty being concluded. If I understand him the 
British are to surrender the right of search for British goods or 
British subjects. The war, then, will be likely to continue as 
long as even the Kentuckians will desire. I expect no peace till 
the people make it. It will be, whenever it does come, the 
people's peace. We must make peace by speaking through our 
representatives. They must give the public mind an impression 
and direction, and that in its turn will strengthen their hands 
and encourage their hearts. You are in congress at a time when 
men who love their country and have talents to promote her 
best interests, would like to be there. It is a time for men to 
act in. 

I have received three letters from you, and hope to receive 
many more. I should like to see the Intelligencer, if it is perfectly convenient. We have heard of the capture of The Chesapeake, and we all lament it. It is a great loss. 

Monday, June 7. We have chosen the old Secretary, Treasurer, and Asa Dearborn, Commissary- General. Dr. Goddard 
refuses to go to see you. To-morrow morning is assigned for 
making a choice of Senator. 

I will send you his letter next mail. 

Yours, &c., E. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, June 28, 1813. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have not written you for some time, principally for the reason that I have had nothing to say. My last 
accounts from Concord are to the 21st instant. You had then 
refused to postpone the judiciary bill. I hope, and have no 
doubt, you passed it. You have learned the fate of my resolu-. 
tions. 1 We had a warm time of it, for four days, and then the 
other side declined further discussion. I had prepared myself 
for a little speech, but the necessity of speaking was prevented. 
I went with Rhea of Tennessee, to deliver the resolutions to 
the President. I found him in his bed, sick of a fever. I gave 
them to him, and he merely answered that they would be 
attended to. We have received no answer. The President 
remains sick, although he is thought to be getting better. 

We shall probably get up some resolutions, directly attacking 
the war. If so, I suppose I shall shoot my little gun. We have 
some fine fellows on our side of the House. 

The weather has been tolerable, except four or five days. I 
should not like to stay here after the first week in July. As 
soon as my vote on the taxes is recorded, I intend setting out. 
The taxes will probably be laid ; but it is not certain. ^ 

Mr. Mason 2 has been here a week. He will certainly obtain 
great weight in the Senate. 

Give us a letter often. Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

The British are in great force down the bay. Hampton, near 
Norfolk, has fallen into their hands. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, July 4, 1813. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, You have done a great work at Concord ; 
may your reward be great. I have received the judiciary bill, 
&c. All is right. I have no objection to the candidates you 
mention for judicial offices. I do not hear whether L. came 
into this. 

We are yet on the taxes ; they will probably pass. It will 
take so long to adjust the details, and to bring the bills before 

1 Resolutions offered by Mr. Webster, calling upon the President for information with regard to the French Decrees, repealing the Berlin and Milan Decrees, 
&c. &c. June 10, 1813. 

2 Jeremiah Mason. 

the House to be discussed on their general principles, that I very 
much doubt whether any full discussion of the war will be had 
this session. For myself, I am determined not to remain here 
more than ten days. The weather is already very hot ; more so 
than ever I experienced. 

The President has sent no answer yet. I must in decency 
stay till he does, if it comes in any season, in order to see if 
supplementary questions are necessary. He will be followed 
up on that subject. An inquiry into the failure on the frontier 
is talked of; I think there will not be any time this session. 

We have several projects, and a good many good hands to 
give a lift. We are trying to organize our opposition, and bring 
all our forces to act in concert. 

There is recently appointed a kind of committee, to superintend our concerns, viz : Pickering, Webster, Wm. Reed, Baylies, 
Porter, Pitkin, Grosvenor, Oakley, Stockton, Ridgely, Hanson, 
Sheffey, and Gaston. 

It will take us this session to find one another out. 

Yours, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 29, 1813. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I arrived here last evening, and here learned 
of the Portsmouth fire and the consumption of my house. I 
have only time to say, that the safety of my family compensates 
the loss of the property. Mr. Mason urges me that Mrs. Webster may remain at his house till spring ; I think this will be 
best, except perhaps a short visit, if the travelling should be 
good, into your quarter. I have not time to say more, but 
thought you would be glad to hear that I am in possession of 
myself after the knowledge of such a loss. 

I am yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. I. P. DAVIS. 

Washington, January 6, 1814. 

DEAR SIR, Our town has met with another conflagration. I 
heard not a syllable of it till I reached here. I found a letter 
from my wife, but so horrible was the general account which 
the people about me gave, that it put my firmness to a severe 
test to open it. When I found nothing lost but house and 
property, you may well imagine how much I felt relieved from 
distress. 

You will be glad to learn that my houseless family have 
found a good shelter for the winter. Whether at Mr. Mason's, 
or with my friends in the country, I do not yet know. They 
were offered an asylum at either place. I had at first almost 
made up a resolution to return immediately. Mrs. Webster 
had anticipated such a resolution, and in her first letter advised 
against it. On the whole, considering how critical the times are 
here, I shall, I believe, stay through the winter. 

The great news from Europe comes seasonably ; at least to 
me. It enables one to forget in some degree his own misfortunes. We have all been in danger of worse evils than burnings, 
and exposed to a foe more merciless than all the elements. I 
trust Providence has delivered us. 

Bonaparte's disasters produce a visible effect here. The 
administration seems to be appalled. It seems at present to be 
suspending its war measures, and taking time to consider, and 
perhaps also to ascertain whether the voice of the party is still 
for war. There are evident symptoms of schism in the Cabinet, 
and in the party in Congress. Some construe the despatches 
to be pacific, others say they will bear no such construction. 
That is, those who are still for war, say there is nothing in the 
despatches ; those who begin to grow sick of it, affect to see 
new evidence of a pacific disposition on the part of England, in 
these despatches, and in the speech of the Prince Regent. One 
of the leading Democratic Senators detained me half an hour 
to hear his comment on the word " Reciprocity " in the Prince 
Regent's speech. He thinks it a word full of peace, and hangs 
all his hopes on " Reciprocity." Monroe will have it, that the 
despatches are pacific ; whence it is inferred that his " thoughts 

are turned on peace." In truth, his thoughts are turned principally on the next election. Armstrong can see nothing in the 
despatches which looks like sentiments of returning justice in 
the minds of the British ministry. He is still for trying the tug 
of war. 

Monroe and Armstrong cannot go on long together. I have 
no doubt Armstrong will fall. Vide Democratic Press. If any 
thing prevents, it will be the influence of Clay, Grundy, and the 
other lights of the West, who are supposed to be for more war, 
and for Armstrong. Excuse a long letter ; which when begun, 
was meant only for an envelop. Make my respects to Mrs. 
Davis and believe me with esteem, 

Yours, Stc., D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 30, 1814. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I enclose you a few creatures, called 
speeches. One of them you will find I have corrected, in some 
of its printer's errors, with my pen ; please do the same to the 
rest, before they go out of your hands. I shall send a few to 
your townsmen, you will learn who by looking at the post-office, 
for I have not my list by me now, and so cannot say exactly for 
whom I shall send to you. Of those that come to your hands, 
give them in my name to those you think proper, Federalists or 
Democrats. 1 

The speech is not exactly what it ought to be. I had not 
time. I had no intention of speaking till nine o'clock in the 
morning, and delivered the thing about two. I could make it 
better, but I dare say you think it would be easier to make a 
new one, than to mend it. It was well enough received at the 
time, and our side of the House said they would have it in this 
form. So much for speeches. 

What do you do with such a house full of women and children ? Especially, how do you make out to keep the house quiet, 
with those two black-eyed, brown-headed, chattering, romping 

1 Speech on the " Encouragement of Enlistments," January 14, 1814. 
cousins in it, and more especially with that one, which, though 
youngest, is yet biggest ; but though biggest, I fear not best ? 
As to him who sleeps in his borrowed cradle, and bears the loss 
of his own with so much moderation of temper, I trust he is 
born to be a philosopher. To all these, together with their 
mothers, you must give my love, for I have not time to-day to 
write more than this letter. 

To whatever projects for carrying on the war government 
may adopt, they will find obstacles. There will yet be much 
discussion in both houses. Some excellent speeches have been 
made in the Senate, especially one on the non-importation bill, 
by Mr. Gore. As to the prospect of peace, my opinion is this : 
If the administration can get an army, they will still contend 
for Canada. If the high bounty will not obtain men, they will 
certainly try conscription. If Bonaparte rises, they will rise ; if 
he is kept down and they can get no army, they will have peace, 
if they can get it. Write me often. Do you yet talk about the 
election ? Who are candidates ? &c. &c. 

Yours as ever, D. W. 

P. S. To MRS. GRACE WEBSTER, I am sorry the Rev. 
Ephraim has got our little white house, but we will find another. I hope you will do a good deal of visiting this winter, 
because it seems to be a leisure time. You must especially go 
and visit Mr. Wood and Mr. Price, and Deacon Gerrish, &c. ; 
also all the Squire's neighbors, as well as the Salisbury 
quality." 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, Friday, February 5, 1814. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I received yours of the 23d yesterday, and 
Grace's of same date. You may depend upon our discussing 
public subjects here, at least freely and with spirit ; of the ability, 
the public must judge. They are determined not to take up my 
resolutions this session ; of this I am certain. But on the loan 
bill we hope to get a blow at them. That bill must go to a 
committee of the whole, by the rules ; and the previous question 
cannot be called in committee of the whole. Gaston and Gros
venor are prepared to give great speeches on that subject. I do 
not think myself of trying again, unless my friends at the North 
should be of opinion that I can do better. 

Mr. Gore's speech, a very good one, I shall be able to send 
you in the course of a few days. On the Maryland Memorial, 
a very animated debate happened in both Houses. Mr. King 
came out for the first time. You never heard such a speaker. 
In strength, and dignity, and fire ; in ease, in natural effect, 
and gesture as well as in matter, he is unequalled. He did not 
make a set speech, and did not expect to speak at all, but the 
administration hands objected to printing the memorial. He 
made a few remarks on that point ; somehow Giles got into the 
debate on the wrong side ; I do not know how it happened, but 
one thing led to another till Mr. King came out in plump terms 
on the right of remonstrance and of resistance ; he said it was 
a mere question of prudence, how far any State would bear the 
present state of things, &c., &c. 

Are you safe in your election ? Pray be in season in your 
measures. Who is councillor for Hillsborough ? how does the 
New Hampshire sheriff manage ? &c., &c. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. C. B. HADDOCK. 

Washington, February 7, 1814. 

MY DEAR NEPHEW, Although I have seen so little of you 
since you were a child, I yet take a great interest in your 
welfare as well on your own account as from an affectionate 
remembrance of your dear mother. Learning from your uncle 
Ezekiel, that you are passing the winter at Salisbury, I take the 
opportunity of writing to you, and of desiring you in turn to 
write to me. 

You are now, I think, in your Sophomore year. I recollect 
that year was an interesting one to me from the studies that 
belonged to it. I suppose the course of studies is since that 
time a good deal altered ; but it was then Geography, Logic, 
Mathematics, &c. As we had before been confined altogether 
to Latin and Greek, these other pursuits, in addition to their 
VOL. i. 21 
real importance, possessed the charm of novelty. Geography, 
especially, is an entertaining study ; and its usefulness is as great 
as its pleasure. It is an indispensable preliminary to history, 
the ancient Epic poetry, and almost every other literary pursuit. 
I would advise you never to read the history of any country, 
till you have studied its geography. If it be ancient history, 
you must have before you maps of the country, with its ancient 
names and divisions. If it be modern history, you must have 
maps with modern names and divisions. You should learn to 
use the globes easily, and'should use them frequently and freely. 
If you form at first incorrect ideas of the situations of the continents, the great seas, &c., you will find it very difficult to 
correct them afterwards. 

The favorable accounts, my dear nephew, which I hear of 
your progress in your studies, make me hope that I can be in 
some degree useful to you by my advice. If I can, it will give 
me great pleasure. I wish you to write to me often and on any 
subject you please. I shall remember to write to you as frequently as my leisure will permit. I hope you will see your 
grandmother and aunt, and let them know you have heard from 
me. Make my respects to your father and mother, and remember me to William and Moses. When you have opportunity, I 
hope you will visit your little cousins at Boscawen. 

Adieu, my dear nephew, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 7, 1814. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, There has been hardly any thing transpiring 
here this month out of which one could find materials for a 
letter. 

A bankruptcy bill is reported ; probably it will not be acted 
upon this session. A bill making great alterations in the judiciary will most likely take the same fate, and indeed I am 
doubtful whether the important subject of the new tariff will 
not be postponed. If these things should all take place, we 
may adjourn next month ; I think we shall. 

The spring is coming forward here. The ground is settled 

and dry ; the birds are appearing, and the grass is green. But 
spring does not rush forward here, as it does in New Hampshire 
after it has commenced. It lingers and gets along by imperceptible degrees. 

Almost all that I know about your election, I gather from the 
papers. They look well; especially Portsmouth and Keene. 
But before you receive this, the matter will be settled ; so I will 
not trouble you on that subject. I imagine you will not be in 
a condition to like to talk about it ; at least I fear so. 

I have no faith in C ; I believe he will shrink and give 

in, and be paid for his compliance by the seals of state. 

Mr. King will stand candidate for New York. There will be 
a severe contest in that State. 

I think the nomination of General Brooks a wise measure. 

Give my love to mother and your family, and let me hear 
from you. D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 28, 1814. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I send you to-day Sheffey's speech. You 
will at least like its length and substance. We are yet to have 
one or two more in pamphlet form, which I will endeavor to 
obtain and send. In relation to the offer made by England to 
renew Jay's treaty, I intend to see and collect, and carry home, 
what evidence there is on the point. The news brought by The 
Rambler, has just arrived here ; we have not had time to consider it. It is vast and momentous. 

Most of the subjects intended to be acted upon this session 
are through. One of great importance has lately been started, 
viz : another bank project. The loan will fail, unless they can 
help it on by a bank. The National Intelligencer says it is 
necessary ; and seems to intimate that that consideration ought 
to supersede constitutional scruples. Of course, I cannot desert 
my post here, while so important a project is in agitation. If 
this should go by, I may, and think I shall, be at your Hopkinton court. I have written the Chief Justice to send Judge E. to 
Haverhill. In the Supreme Court I showed myself once, twice, 
or thrice. In one case I charged a New Yorker three hundred 
dollars, and in two other cases, a hundred dollars each. So 
much for prize causes, &c. 

There is no man in the court that strikes rne like Marshall. 
He is a plain man, looking very much like Colonel Adams, and 
about three inches taller. I have never seen a man of whose 
intellect I had a higher opinion. 

The court adjourned about two weeks ago. The Yazoo bill 
is through, passed by eight majority. It excited a great deal of 
feeling. All the Federalists supported the bill, and some of the 
Democrats. Georgians, and some Virginians and Carolinians, 
opposed it with great heat. Oakley made the principal speech 
of the Federalists in its support. Our feeling was to get the 
Democratic support of it. Clark of Kentucky, a pretty clever 
fellow, made a handsome speech in support of it. 

Mason is going to be a great man. He ranks in the Senate, 
I think, next to King and Gore. He has made some very 
excellent speeches. 

I give you joy of the election. We had here a great deal of 
distress about it, and could not have stood a defeat. You gave 
an enormous vote, nearly forty thousand. I do not hear who 
rides for Boscawen, but I suppose some of the old school. Your 
vote in Boscawen was a glorious one, but nothing gave me 
more pleasure than the regeneration of Salisbury. I hope that 
town may be kept right hereafter. 

I have sent Gaston's speech to Captain Benj. Pettengill, who 
I hear is one of us ; if not, it will do him no hurt. I think I 
shall send a speech or something to Caleb Knight. These 
speeches are a little too much like treatises. 

Yours as ever, D. W. 

Give my love to all your numerous family. I have to-day 
had a letter enclosing other letters, enclosing locks of hair, &c. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, May 29, 1814. 

CONGRESS adjourned yesterday, after half an hour's session. 
Two elections will be contested ; Bayley's and Hungerford's, 



DANIEL WEBSTER 245 

by Barret and Taliaferro. Messrs. King and Gore took their 
seats yesterday. There will be a new Senator from Delaware, 
Wells or Vandyke. 

There is no present prospect, as I think, of peace, although 
the Madison men appear to be very confident of such a result 
from the Russian embassy. There will be difficulty about 
the taxes, inasmuch as the war party will be divided in 
respect to the objects of taxation. The whiskey tax will not 
be high. The domestic dram-drinking interest is astonishingly 
powerful. 

I am going to-day with Col. Pickering, Mr. Stockton, and a 
few others, to dine with Judge Washington, at Mount Vernon. 
House adjourned yesterday to Monday. 

Yours, D. W. 






DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 
(EXTRACT.) 

Washington, October 30, 1814. 
DEAR EZEKIEL, 

******* 

We have as yet done little. The taxes are before us. I have 
marked out my course respecting them, and shall vote for 
nothing but the whiskey tax. This I am anxious to have laid. 
It will stop distillation in New England ; a practice which is 
drawing upon our sources of life, and rendering us far more 
dependent than we otherwise should be upon others for bread. 
A few of our best Federalists feel an inclination to vote for the 
taxes, owing to circumstances, and the particular state of public 
opinion in their districts. 

The terms offered by England, struck our folks differently at 
first from what they do on reflection. For my part, I expected 
no better ; so feeble has the government shown itself, and so 
little able to carry on the war successfully. 

We have a plan for a conscription. I think I have sent you 
its outlines. The bill is drawn principally on Mr. Monroe's 
21* 
first plan. Of course we shall oppose such usurpation all we 
can. 

I should like to hear from you, respecting what is the present 
tone of public sentiment among you? What do Federalists 
think we ought to do here ? 

Yours, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, November 8, 1814. 

DEAR SIR, We are now taking up the conscription ; we shall, 
I think, let Mr. Troup fill up the blanks, &c. before we state our 
objections to it. I doubt whether it will pass ; but what else 
can government do ? Voluntary enlistments will not answer. 
They must put themselves upon some measure of force, to get 
men. This they suppose will answer ; but I suppose no such 
measure can be executed. 

We have had a good deal of debate upon a certain volunteer 
bill ; its object was to get up a sort of mongrel corps, in which 
members of congress could serve ; half-way between regulars 
and militia. It contained, also, a provision for exempting 
these corps, after serving a time, from all further militia duty, 
either to the general government or the State. We finally laid 
the bill aside for the present. There is great distrust, jealousy, 
and division among the majority ; but I know not whether any 
good will come of their schisms. 

We have not heard any thing from New England, though we 
want to know how the tone of public feeling among you is. 

The taxes will be upon you directly. The bank is uncertain. 
If they make a proper bank, some Federalists will vote for it ; it 
is uncertain whether they will do this or not. 

Give my love to mother and your family. I am in very good 
health. Yours, 

D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, November 21, [1814.] 

DEAR EZEKIEL, At present we are engaged about a bank. 
The project brought in by the new secretary of the treasury was 
calculated only for the benefit of the holders of the stock, created 
since the war. The assessments on the shares were to be paid 
in, in such stock, principally at par ; it being now much depreciated, this was giving its proprietors a great boon. After some 
days' discussion, this plan was abolished, and a new one is now 
before us ; this is, that every share shall be paid for by the subscribers, as follows, namely, one tenth in gold or silver, and nine 
tenths in treasury notes ; whole capital to be fifty millions. If 
this plan succeeds, the capital of the bank, when all paid in, will 
consist of forty-five millions treasury notes, and five millions 
specie ; these treasury notes the government is to issue in payment of its debts, and it is expected that they will be received, 
and even bought up, by those who wish to become stockholders 
in the bank. After getting into the bank in this way, they are 
to be turned into government stock, bearing an interest of six 
per cent, and payable at the pleasure of government, so that the 
capital will then be forty-five millions stock, and five millions 
specie. 

In the present plan, all Presidential interference in choosing 
directors, &c., and all obligation to lend the government money 
is struck out. Federalists have generally voted for the amendment in preference to the first plan, but they are pretty indifferent 
about any bank. 

Mr. Mason's speech is published ; it was well received, and is 
a solid argument. 

We cannot learn whether the conscription will be brought up 
on Monroe's plan, in this House. Indeed, the party are all in a 
swamp, and I should not be surprised at any thing's taking 
place. Yours, 

D. W. 


DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 22, [1814.] 

DEAR EZEKIEL, We have done nothing here lately, except 
with reference to taxes. They have all passed this House, except the land tax of six millions, last year three, which will be 
read the third time to-day. Giles's militia draft bill, which was 
altered in this House, so as to reduce the term from two years 
to one. The Senate have voted to disagree to the amendment. 
A conference will ensue, and the Senate will in the end probably 
recede from their disagreeing vote. This bill, as you will see, 
cannot be carried into effect if the state governments do not 
lend their aid to it. On a motion to strike out the first section 
of this bill, and on a motion to postpone indefinitely, the usual 
manner of moving to reject a measure, we made speeches; 
Stockton, Grosvenor, Shepherd, Ward, Miller, &c. Miller's and 
Stockton's are in the press ; I shall send you sundry copies of 
each. Mine I have written out, but upon the most wise reflection, I have laid it up in the drawer ; it will not, in my opinion, 
answer the expectation of those who heard it, and therefore I 
shall not publish it at present. Perhaps, during the session, we 
shall have conscription up in a worse form, though I believe the 
party are a good deal frighted at it. 

We are expecting every day to hear from New Orleans. It 
seems certain that the English have sent an expedition thither ; 
on its result, perhaps, the question of peace may depend. 

Give my love and duty to our mother, and my love to your 
family. I intend coming home in February. 

As to governor, let the people have their choice. Strengthen 
the state governments as much as possible ; especially see if 
something cannot be done for the council. 

Yours, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 9, 1815. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, As conscription has gone by for the present 
at least, I thought that you might like to see the several documents. I send you Monroe's letter, Giles's bill, and the bill reported by our military committee. 

The bank bill has passed our House in a form very much 
amended ; it will now be harmless, as we think. We had a 
hard task to prevent its passing in its worst shape. 

We hear that the British are near New Orleans ; as that place 
is likely to become the theatre of interesting operations, I shall 
try to send you a map, &c. 

I hear you talk of Mr. West for governor. If he will accept, 
and will be acceptable, it will do well ; he would make an excellent governor. I think Cheshire would give him a great vote. 

The taxes have mostly passed. The government put off the 
necessary work so long that they have been obliged to lay more 
than I think the people can pay ; I have no belief they can be 
collected. 

Mr. King is getting a good deal of popularity for having 
moved the postponement of Giles's bill ; it was accidental and 
unpremeditated, and there was no debate. After we passed 
the bill with amendments, it was bandied about several days 
from house to house, on account of the disagreeing votes relative to the amendments. Being one day before the Senate, and 
it being known that public sentiment had terrified the vehement 
senators, Mr. King made the motion, some members happened 
to be out, it was immediately put and carried. 

Mr. Gore has recently made a very great speech. I understand it is to be published, and shall send it to you. I know 
not whether occasion will offer for general discussion in our 
House soon, but expect it before we go. We shall take up the 
investigating report one of these days, and talk over the Bladensburg business. 

Give my love to mother, and your family. 

Yours, D. W. 
DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 22, 1815. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, 

******* 

We have nothing from New Orleans later than the evening 
of 23d, the night after the first battle. 

We had yesterday a letter from Secretary Dallas, giving a 
bad account of the treasury ; five millions more of new taxes 
must be collected within this year, in order to get money enough 
out of all our ways and means to pay the interest of the debt, 
still leaving the whole expense of the year, forty millions at least, 
to be provided for by loans ! 

The administration is completely foiled in it's bank scheme. 
It has been a hard battle, and the defeat is complete. We were 
obliged to make a bank or let Dallas's plan go. A hundred of 
the narrowest chances alone saved us from a complete papei 
money system, in such a form as was calculated and intended 
to transfer the odium of depreciation from the government to 
the bank. It will be the subject of a week's talk when I see 
you. The present bank can probably do nothing ; certainly 
very little during the war. When peace comes, it will be likely 
to do good. 

There is no great business at present before us ; what new 
projects will be got up I cannot say. I expect some great 
explosion yet before the session closes, on account of the state 
of the treasury. 

I have sent you Stockton's and Ward's speeches ; also my 
little talk about the bank. 1 My conscription speech must rest 
till another day. If a good occasion presents, I will shoot one 
little gun more, as Nat. says, this session. But I intend to go 
home, so as to be at February court. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

1 Speech on the incorporation of a Bank of the United States, January 2, 
1815. See Everett's edition of the Works of Daniel Webster, page 35. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 30, 1815. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I send you the Intelligencer containing our 
latest advices from New Orleans. 

The President has negatived the bank bill. So all our labor 
is lost. I hope this will satisfy our friends, that it was not a 
bank likely to favor the administration. What is to be done 
next nobody can tell. 

One or two more- taxes are expected to be passed, one on 
income ; I think the others recommended by the secretary will 
not go. 

My intention is to depart hence in about eight or ten days, 
so as to be home at court, at which time and place you must 
come and see me. 

I shall not probably find an occasion to say something which 
I should like to say; but I hope and think that Mr. Mason will 
discuss some subjects of interest, in a manner to awaken the 
attention of the people a little. 

We are getting printed a little abstract of reports, bills, &c. 
tending to show the design of government on conscription, &c. 
I shall send a number of them to you for circulation. Give my 
love to our mother, your wife and children. 

Yours, D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. D


Portsmouth, August 25, 1815. 

DEAR SIR, On my return from Exeter to-day, I found your 
letter from Hanover. On the subject of the dispute between 
the President and the trustees, I am as little informed as any 
reading individual in society ; and I have not the least inclination to espouse either side, except in proceedings in which my 
services may be professional. It was intimated to me last 
spring, that the President might possibly institute process 
against the trustees for the recovery of money due him from 
them ; that proceedings might also be commenced in the courts 
of law, to determine whether there had been a perversion of the 
Phillips fund ; and that in case these events should happen, the 
President would be glad to engage my assistance as counsel. 
At Concord, the President suggested, in general terms, that he 
might wish to obtain my professional assistance on some future 
occasion, which I readily promised him. After Dr. Haven had 
left this place for Hanover, I received the President's letter, 
desiring me to be at Hanover at a time which had then already 
elapsed. I answered it by mail, not quite so soon as I should 
have done, if I had not expected some private conveyance ; and, 
if I had not known that an answer by any conveyance would 
have been wholly immaterial at that time. If I had received it 
earlier, I could not have attended, because the court engaged 
me at home ; and I ought to add here, that if I had had no 
other engagements at the time, and had also been seasonably 
notified, I should have exercised my own discretion about undertaking to act a part before the committee at Hanover. I 
regard that as no professional call, and should consider myself 
as in some degree taking side personally and individually for 
one of the parties, by appearing as an advocate on such an 
occasion. This I should not desire to do, until I know more of 
the merits of the case. As to the letter you enclose, and the 
mention made in it of myself, I can only say that I have no 
particular recollection of any conversation in which, more than 
on any other occasion when I talked of the subject, I expressed 
what is ascribed to me. Undoubtedly, however, the substance 
of what I should say on that subject, at any time, would be, that 
the trustees should make a reply ; and that whatever they allege, 
they should fully prove by affidavits or otherwise. If, by " putting down a certain man," is meant a refutation of the charges 
contained in his publications, I certainly have felt, in common 
with every body else, as I suppose, a very strong desire that the 
trustees, for many of whom I have the highest respect, should 
be able to refute, in the fullest manner, charges which, if proved 
or admitted, would be so disreputable to their characters. My 
" desire " on the subject is just what I had imagined every one 
else felt, who wished to see a controversy cleared up and to 
learn the truth. 

As to what you are pleased to say about my extricating myself from this affair, or of its being otherwise unpleasant to me ; 


as also what you observe of a suspicion entertained by some 
that Mr. Thompson had employed me to feel of Mr. Haven on 
the subject ; give me leave to say that I should know better 
how to answer these remarks, if I were not writing to one for 
whom I have the highest and warmest esteem, and of whose 
sense of delicacy and propriety very few, certainly, at any time, 
have had occasion to complain. Towards those who harbor 
such a suspicion, I entertain no sentiment but contempt. On 
the merits of this dispute I perceive you are decided and warm. 
This is natural to the generosity of your nature, and the sincerity 
and warmth of your friendship. You speak in terms of pretty 
strong decision of individuals whom I regard as among the most 
valuable and honorable men in the community; but on this 
account I neither bring accusation nor insinuation against you. 
No suspicion of the purity of your motives, or the uprightness 
of your conduct, has come near my mind. I am not quite so 
fully convinced as you are, that the President is altogether right 
and the trustees altogether wrong. When I have your fulness 
of conviction, perhaps I may have some portion of your zeal. 
Whenever I have said any thing to either side, it has been to 
impress the necessity of moderation and candor, as they will do 
me the justice, I trust, to acknowledge. 

If the friends of the President have any thing in any degree derogatory to the character of Judge Farrar, it will certainly 
have its weight ; but it is not likely that the great body of the 
Federalists in the State will take much on trust from Democratic newspapers ; they will look to the result of the inquiry by 
the committee. You may be well assured that in our nomination of governor, we have regarded nothing but the political 
interests of the State. I can but flatter myself that if you were 
better acquainted with circumstances, you would think less 
unfavorably of the conduct of your Federal friends. I am quite 
sure your patriotism and your candor will lead you to a thorough 
inquiry before you pronounce your disapprobation. In the mean 
time, give me leave to hope that Vermont, in which, I trust, this 
controversy has not been much felt, will set us so good an 
example next month, as will make us quite ashamed of apathy 
or disunion. 

I am, dear Sir, with sincere and great regard, 

Yours, &c. DANIEL WEBSTER. 

VOL. i. 22 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. W. SULLIVAN. 

Washington, January 2, 1816. 
Do not read this while you have any thing else to do. 

DEAR SIR, I am glad to find you so well employed as in 
chasing whales, though they be dead whales. Having seen you 
last in your own chamber, I was glad to learn that you have got 
into court, and are fit to engage in such arduous enterprises as 
whaling. 

Your account reminded me of some very ingenious and 
laughable remarks of Lord Erskine, in a crim. con. case, some 
twenty years ago. They are in one of the volumes of the 
Annual Register. Mr. Ers^ine was for the defendant ; his 
defence was that the plaintiff had abandoned his wife, and put 
her to separate maintenance, and having thus voluntarily relinquished the comfort and society of his wife, he could not pretend 
that the defendant, by his interposition, had deprived him of 
these enjoyments. He then went on to say that the law of 
England in respect to wives, was just like the law of the Greenland fishery in respect to whales; whoever struck the whale, 
had a right to him, so long as he held on by the line. However 
the fish might plunge, or flounce, or curvet, though he should 
go to the bottom, or run away to the temperate or the torrid 
zone, while the striker held on by his line, the animal, however untamed or untamable, remained his property, and woe 
betide the wrongdoer that should interfere ; but the moment 
he lets go his line, the animal, in the eye of the law, was ferce 
natures, and became the rightful property of the first taker. So, 
in the case of wives ; while the husband holds on by his matrimonial string, however far the wife strays, to whatever great 
distances she may run out from the path of duty, or however 
crooked and eccentric her course, the law still regards her in 
custodia viri, and will allow no interference of third persons; 
but if the husband will choose to let this little cord drop out of 
his hand, in an instant all is over! The wife then runs "unclaimed of any man," and like the wounded whale, becomes the 
property of the next striker. 

We are doing nothing now but to quarrel with one of our 
laws of the last session, called the horse law, its object being to 

pay the Kentucky men for all the horses which died in that 
country during the war. So far very well; but there was a 
section put in to pay for all houses and buildings burned by 
the enemy, on account of having been a military depot. This 

played the very d . All the Niagara frontier, the city of 

Washington, &c., wherever the enemy destroyed any thing, was 
proved to have been a military depot ; one tavern, twenty-seven 
thousand dollars, because some officers or soldiers lodged in 
the house a day or two before the burning ; one great rope-walk, 
because a rope had been sent there to mend from the navy yard, 
&c. &c. Some say the fault is in the law, some say it is in 
the commissioner who executed the law, others say there is no 
error in either, and others insist that there are errors in both. I 
agree with the last, as the most probable proposition. 

The bankrupt bill will be tried next week. It will be hard 
pressed by Hopkinson, but I cannot foresee its fate. 

We then have the compensation to repeal, which I trust will 
not take us long. I fear a bare repeal of the law of last session 
will take place ; then the judiciary projects must be disposed of. 
Then comes from the Senate the conscription law, as you justly 
call it. What inducement has one to resist this or any thing 
else ? Two years ago, with infinite pains and labor, we defeated 
Mr. Monroe's conscription; nobody thanked us for it. Last 
winter our friends in the Senate got this militia bill thrown out; 
nobody knew or cared any thing about it. For two or three 
years Massachusetts has been paying from ten to twenty-five 
per cent, more duties on importations than Pennsylvania or 
Maryland. At the close of the last session, we tried to do something for her relief ; but her Federal legislature takes no notice of 
the abominable injustice done her, or the plain violation of the 
constitution and laws, which has taken place to her great injury. 
All are silent and quiet. But when her Federal members who 
come here to be kicked, and stoned, and abused in her behalf, 
think proper to raise their compensation, so that it will defray 
their expenses, she denounces them, man by man, without an 
exception. No respect for talents, services, character, or feelings, 
restrains her from joining with the lowest democracy in its 
loudest cry. 

Having thus written you a very long and dull letter, and come 
near to finishing with a fit of the spleen, I will conclude by 
sending to your household our sincerest gratulations, at the 
opening of the new year, and our wishes that all its days may 
be pleasant to you. I must add also, which you will be very 
sorry to hear, that the illness of our little daughter at Cambridge, 
has very much alarmed us, and we are in expectation that 
Mrs. Webster will be compelled to return. If so, she will be 
accompanied by her brother, to whom I have written to come 
here for that purpose, unless I should make such disposition of 
my business at the court as to permit me to return with her, 
which I do not expect. Yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 26, 1816. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have settled my purpose to remove from 
New Hampshire in the course of the summer. I have thought 
of Boston, New York, and Altyany. On the whole I shall, 
probably, go to Boston; although I am not without some 
inducements to go into the State of New York. Our New 
England prosperity and importance are passing away. This 
is fact. The events of the times, the policy of England, the 
consequences of our war, and the Ghent Treaty, have bereft us 
of our commerce, the great source of our wealth. If any great 
scenes are to be acted in this country within the next twenty 
years, New York is the place in which those scenes are to be 
viewed. More of this hereafter. 

We are now coming to the end of the session. The bank is 
before the Senate, and in my opinion, wih 1 be a law in a week. 
Dallas is to quit the treasury, to be president of it. 

The tariff is the only other important article before us. In 
three weeks I intend to be off. As to circuit, I decline Hillsborough and Cheshire, but perhaps shall be obliged to go to 
Grafton. 

I am very sorry to hear of mother's continued ill health. The 
weather has now turned warm, and I hope she will experience 
the benefit of it. Here it has been very cold for three or four 
weeks ; but spring seems now coming in earnest. 

Give my love to mother and your family. 

Ever yours, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, April 11, 1816. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I received yours yesterday, and I learned 
with great sorrow the illness of our mother and Mary. I have 
hardly a hope that the former can now be living. If she should 
be, on the receipt of this, tell her I pray for her everlasting peace 
and happiness, and would give her a son's blessing for all her 
parental goodness. May God bless her, living or dying ! 

If she does not survive, let her rest beside her husband and 
our father. 

I hope Mary is not dangerously ill. You must write to me, 
addressed to New York, where I expect to be on my way home 
about the 28th or 30th instant. Congress will probably rise 
about the 22d or a few days later. 

We have got through most of the important public business 
of the session. 

Give my love to your wife and children, and may Heaven 
preserve you all. 

Most affectionately yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. E. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

April 29, 1816. 

DEAR CHARLES, Your grandmother continued to decline 
from the time you saw her, till one o'clock on Friday last. She 
was very sensible of the event of her sickness ; and to that event 
she looked forward with perfect composure and resignation. 
She was buried yesterday at Salisbury, by the side of her 
mother and her husband. She spoke of you with great affection, 
and wished you all happiness in this world and the world to 
come. May God have us all in his holy keeping. 

Yours affectionately, 

E. WEBSTER.

[In the early part of 1816, Mr. Randolph and Mr. Webster had some misunderstanding in the House of Representatives, which led to a challenge on the 
part of Mr. Randolph. The matter was, however, by the interposition of friends, 
amicably adjusted, and the following correspondence will show how entirely to 
the satisfaction of both parties. 

It would seem that Mr. Webster kept no copy of his reply to Mr. Randolph's 
message, but after all was settled, wrote to him to request one, which Mr. 
Randolph forwarded to him.] 

MR. RANDOLPH TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Davis's, nine miles from Washington, on the Baltimore Road, 

April 30, 1816. 

SIR, Your polite and friendly note was put into my hands 
this morning, under circumstances that did not permit me to 
write. I now regret very much that I did not leave Georgetown 
with you this morning. I have just dined where you breakfasted 
this morning with a most pleasant party. That reflection seems 
to add to the uncomfortable feel of solitariness that now assails 
me. Below you have the " Copy " of the paper, which you 
desired me to forward to you. Accept my acknowledgments 
for the terms in which that request is made, and believe me 
with very high respect and regard, 

Your obedient servant, 

JOHN RANDOLPH, of Roanoke. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. RANDOLPH. 

SIR, For having declined to comply with your demand 
yesterday in the House, for an explanation of words of a 
general nature, used in debate, you now " demand of me that 
satisfaction which your insulted feelings require," and refer me 

to your friend, Mr. , I presume, as he is the bearer of your 

note, for such arrangements as are usual. 

This demand for explanation, you, in my judgment, as a 
matter of right, were not entitled to make on me ; nor were the 
temper and style of your own reply to my objection to the 
sugar tax of a character to induce me to accord it as a matter 
of courtesy. 

Neither can I, under the circumstances of the case, recognize 
in you a right to call me to the field to answer what you may 
please to consider an insult to your feelings. 

It is unnecessary for me to state other and obvious considerations growing out of this case. It is enough that I do not feel 
myself bound at all times and under any circumstances, to 
accept from any man, who shall choose to risk his own life, an 
invitation of this sort ; although I shall be always prepared to 
repel in a suitable manner the aggression of any man who may 
presume upon such a refusal. 

Your obedient servant, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO REV. F. BROWN. 

Portsmouth, June 4, 1816. 

MY DEAR SIR, I received yours last evening. You do not 
feel a stronger wish than I do, that nothing may take place at 
this session detrimental to the college, and I am willing to do 
any thing in my power to soften the irritated feelings of democracy towards it. I am under engagements to go to Boston 
to-morrow, and shall be in that town four or five days. From 
Boston I can go direct to Concord, if it should be thought useful. 
Mr. Mason will go up, I believe, the first of next week. I have 
some hope that the legislature will do nothing ; partly, because 
I hope they will be satisfied in some measure with the report, 
and partly from the hopeless state of Dr. W.'s health. It is a 
favorite idea with some to create a new college. Would it not 
be well if this idea could be encouraged, and to let the ill 
humors work off in that direction? Suppose a proposition 
should be made for a committee to report at next session, upon 
the expediency of making a new college at Concord, and what 
donations, &c., could be obtained for such an object. 

" Resolved, that a joint committee of both Houses be appointed to take into 
consideration the expediency of establishing a Seminary of Learning, in some 
part of this State, to be called the University of New Hampshire, and to ascertain what endowment for such institution could be obtained from private 
donation, and also what grants of land or money could be properly and conveniently made to the same by the State ; and also to prepare a draft of a 
charter for such seminary ; and to report at the next session of the Legislature." 
Perhaps if something of this sort should be brought forward 
by somebody who has been favorably inclined to Dr. W., but 
who would wish to prevent violent measures, it might do good. 

Mr. Tilton of Exeter, I should think, might do it to advantage. Think of this; Mr. Cutts, the bearer of this, is an 
intelligent friend of mine, and capable of being useful at Concord. I recommend it to you to cultivate his acquaintance, 
while there. He is intimate with Mr. Tilton, and indeed with 
most other leading men in the legislature. Any thing that shall 
postpone the subject, will give time to the present feelings to 
cool and evaporate. 

I am, dear Sir, yours with esteem, 

D. WEBSTER. 

N. B. The resolution might say the charter should be drawn 
on the following principles : 

1. A board of trustees, to be inserted in the bill by the legislature, to fill up their own vacancies. 

2. A board of overseers, viz : governor, senators, counsellors, 
and speaker of House of Representatives for time being. 

3. An unlimited right of conscience, in officers, and students ; 
no test, creed, or confession to be required of either, nor any 
preference, direct or indirect, of one religion over another. If 
any thing of this sort be done, it ought to be done early. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Portsmouth, June 26, 1816. 

MY DEAR NEPHEW, Nothing could have given me more 
pleasure than your letter, which I have received to-day. I was 
yesterday in conversation about you with Dr. Mussey, and 
begged him to make a communication to you, respecting your 
future course. Your letter gives me an occasion to write to 
you and to give you my advice. 

I entirely agree in thinking that you ought to look around a 
little time, after leaving college, before you apply yourself to 
professional studies. A little leisure time and a little travel, 
will contribute to the improvement both of body and mind 

Although I have no reason to doubt that you have made the 
most of your advantages, yet the manner and system of education in this State are necessarily much confined. A view of the 
world, a little broader and more extensive than you have yet had 
opportunity to take, is much to be desired. As to the project of 
employment in the line of instruction, I have no doubt it can 
be accomplished, if it should be finally your wish. Situations 
of that sort are readily enough found, I believe, by worthy 
young men, in the southern States and cities. I shall probably 
go to the South in the fall, and if you should incline to go with 
me, I dare say you would light on a situation to suit you. 
After your examination, I wish you to come and see me. You 
have often talked of this, but it has never been done. This 
summer will give you leisure. If you wish to prepare your 
Commencement exercises, you shall have a room for your 
studies. Perhaps I may go to Commencement. However that 
may be, I hope you will come and see me. Please let me know 
whether I may not expect you. I have it in contemplation to 
remove to Boston this summer or fall, though I do not, as yet, 
say much about it. If your inclination should lead you in that 
case to spend a few months there, in the fall or winter in pursuit of general literature, we would try to make your abode 
with us agreeable to you. Let me expect to hear from you. 
I am, dear Charles, yours affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER, 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Portsmouth, July 30, 1816. 

DEAR SIR, In the change which has taken place in the 
judiciary of this State, I feel a strong desire that a friend of 
mine should have a proper place in the new establishment. In 
this wish, I am influenced, I trust, not more by sentiments of 
personal respect than by a regard to the public interest. I refer 
to Mr. Adams. He has been for many years clerk of the 
Supreme Court ; and during the period in which you honored 
us with an occasional attendance at our bar, you were sufficiently acquainted with the manner in which he discharged the 
duties of his office. I think him the best clerk I ever saw. If 
others do not agree to all this, they will hardly be able to mention many whom they think better. By the new law, the 
Supreme Court is to have a clerk in each county. Probably 
some gentlemen intended, by this, to effect a junction of the 
officers of County Common Pleas Clerk, and County Supreme 
Court Clerk. But this can only be done by consent of the two 
courts, for each has by the Constitution the appointment of its 
clerk. 

What would be agreeable to Mr. Adams, and I think useful 
to the county, is that he should be clerk of both courts for this 
county. I imagine the justices of the Supreme Court will at 
once appoint him their clerk for this county. But this office 
would be very small of itself. It seems necessary to add to it 
the clerkship of the Common Pleas. I have no doubt Chief 
Justice Richardson will use his influence with the Court of 
Common Pleas for Mr. Adams's appointment. That court 
consists of Dan. M. Durell, Esq., Chief Justice, and Levi Bartlett, Esq., Associate. There is one vacancy. 

I have thought, Sir, that it would be useful on this occasion, 
for these judges to know, that gentlemen of other States, who 
have been in our courts, have a favorable opinion of the official 
conduct of Mr. Adams, and I have ventured to think, that with 
others you have entertained that opinion, and that the expression of it by you would have its weight. New judges perhaps 
are not likely to appreciate the force of Lord Bacon's remarks 
upon the usefulness of a skilful and experienced clerk : and not 
having seen, some of them, many courts, they may not at once 
know the difference between good clerks and indifferent ones. 

Your professional and judicial life has already been long 
enough to enable you to estimate these things justly. 

Having said so much, may I now beg of you to write on this 
subject to your friend Chief Justice Richardson ? This would 
give weight to his representation to the justices of the Court of 
Common Pleas, and if you should also address Chief Justice 
Durell on the subject, if you know him sufficiently, it would 
probably be extremely useful. I suppose the appointment will 
be made soon. 

Pardon me for giving you trouble, and accept the assurances 
of my respect. 

Your humble servant, DAN'L WEBSTER. 

N. B. The health of the present incumbent renders some 
change necessary soon in the clerkship of the Court of Common Pleas. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, January 19, 1817. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Grace's illness has brought me home. We 
arrived four days ago. She has been declining almost ever 
since we left her, the middle of November, and was so low on 
our arrival, that we entertained very faint hopes of her recovery. 
Her case is consumption, and seems a good deal like dear little 
Mary's. Since our return, her symptoms have been a little more 
favorable, and might almost encourage a slight hope of ultimate 
recovery. Dr. Warren thinks, at least, that for a week she is no 
worse. She seems a little less languid, and has coughed less 
to-day than any day for a fortnight. My engagements in the 
court at Washington are such that, if possible, I must return. If 
Grace should grow no worse, I intend going about Thursday or 
Friday. We found little trouble in opening our house and collecting our family. Both Hannah and Phila are here. Eliza 
Buckminster is coming to stay with us awhile. We came home 
very quickly from Philadelphia, in four days. Mrs. W. stood the 
journey wonderfully well, and took no cold. I have not been 
out so much as to my office. 

If your courts do not prevent, I wish you would run down 
and see the family. 

We desire our love to all your family most affectionately, and 
to Mr. Kelly. 

Most affectionately yours, 

D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, Sunday, 1817. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Our dear little daughter has followed yours. 
She died on Thursday evening at eleven o'clock, and was interred yesterday. Her death, though I thought it inevitable, was 
rather sudden when it happened. Her disease, the consumption, 
had not apparently attained its last stages. She had suffered 
very little. The day of her death, she was pretty bright in the 
forenoon, though weak. In the afternoon, she grew languid 
and drowsy. She, however, desired her friends to read and 
talk with her until a few minutes before eleven, when her countenance suddenly altered, and in five or six minutes she expired. 

Mrs. Webster, though in great affliction, is in tolerable health. 
Our little boy is very well. To-morrow morning I set out on 
my return to Washington. 

Eliza Buckminster is with us, and Anne Paige also arrived 
last evening. We desire our most affectionate regards to Alice 
and the children. 

Ever yours, D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Boston, June 21, 1817. 

MY DEAR NEPHEW, I wish I was competent to give you 
useful advice on the subject of your letter. In general, it is a 
safe rule when a profession is chosen, to pursue it without distraction by other objects and engagements ; but there may be 
cases fit to be exceptions. I have not much belief in the edifying nature of a tutor's employment. Many tutors have been 
good scholars, it is true ; and so they probably would have been, 
had they not been tutors. To teach others the Latin classics, 
naturally renders one critical in the classics, as far as he goes 
in his instructions, but would not after all, give him much Latin. 
If you were to walk every day from Andover to Reading, and 
from Reading back to Andover, you would know the road very 
well from Andover to Reading ; but this daily itineration over 
the same ground, would never bring you to Boston. The 
Latin should be learned for the sake of the good things which 
are in Latin. It is folly to learn a language and then make no 
use of it. What you should do, is not to go back again to 
prosody and syntax, but to read the whole of Cicero and Livy, 
and Quintilian, and the other great writers. This, I imagine, 

would be better done at Andover, where I presume are scholars, 
" ripe and good ones," than in the company of the Freshman 
class at Hanover. 

There is also, generally, an advantage to be derived from 
varying a little the place and means of instruction. An entire 
education at Hanover, I should think, would be too confined. 
There art>, however, considerations of another sort which we are 
often obliged to regard. How far the pay of a tutor may be 
convenient to you, I cannot say. You will perceive, on the 
whole, that I rather agree in the resolution you formed, while at 
Hanover. I dare say President Brown will find a very good 
tutor in your place ; and as you are designed for a profession, 
I think he should leave you to pursue it. But I would not have 
you trust much to my opinion ; for, after all, progress in knowledge depends less frequently on the opportunities enjoyed than 
on the use made of them. 

I am, my dear nephew, your affectionate 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, September 4, 1817. 

DEAR SIR, We are happy to hear that Mrs. Mason arrived 
safe, and hope that Jane's illness was not of long continuance. 
We think it would have been wise in you to have been here at 
the time of Commencement. It was, I thought, a pleasant occasion. I went to Waltham, and passed a few hours at Mr. 
Gore's, while Mr. King was there. Mr. King expressed great 
regret at your leaving him. He thinks you underrate the good 
which might have been done, but at the same time does not 
doubt that you will find it more agreeable to be at home. 

Mr. Gore was pleased to have given you a mark of the 
esteem in which the learned hold you. As he is so much confined, it would be a very good thing for you to come and see 
him, if you should find it convenient, in the course of the 
autumn. 

Judge Smith has written to me, that I must take some part 
in the argument of this college question. I have not thought 
of the subject, nor made the least preparation ; I am sure I can 
VOL. i. 23 
do no good, and must, therefore, beg that you and he will follow 
up in your own manner, the blows which have already been so 
well struck. I am willing to be considered as belonging to the 
cause and to talk about it, and consult about it, but should do 
no good by undertaking an argument. If it is not too troublesome, please let Mr. Fales give me a naked list of the authorities 
cited by you, and I will look at them before court. I do this 
that I may be able to understand you and Judge Smith. 

I hope you will do the needful about our lodgings at Exeter. 
I should not like to be too much crowded at Mr. Gardner's. 
Yours, with great regard, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, November 27, 1817. 

DEAR SIR, President Brown has written to me respecting the 
college cause in its further progress. I have engaged to keep 
hold of it if I go to Washington this winter. He seems desirous 
of a final decision this winter. To this end it is necessary that 
the record should be forwarded as soon as possible. If you can 
have it sent to me, I will send it along. Mr. Brown does not 
know the necessary steps in order to the getting up and getting 
along the writ of error, and relies on you and Judge Smith. 
Causes, as you know, are entered at the supreme court, upon 
the arrival of the record. I should like to know something of the 
court's opinion ; I wish you or Mr. Farrar could get a copy for 
me. If I go to Washington, and have this cause on my shoulders, I must have your brief, which I should get of course without difficulty, and Judge Smith's. 

I must also have somebody to help me at Washington. I 
can think of nobody better for such a question than Hopkinson. 

We have no news here. The court has commenced its 
session, and the chief justice intends to get through next month. 
Not a word is said about our congress election, since it is over. 

Mr. Gore seemed to be very well, for him, a fortnight ago, and 
I believe continues so. 

Will you inform me whether a copy of Judge Richardson's 
opinion can be had, and whether you can devise a mode in 

which I can get Judge Smith's minutes if I should go to Washington ? 

With many salutations for Mrs. Mason and the children, 

I am yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH. 

Boston, December 8, 1817. 

DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 4th, yesterday. In relation to the special verdict, my impression has been that we 
should insert every thing to show, as far as we can, that the 
State did not found and endow the college. I should wish it 
rather to appear what they had not done, than what they had ; 
but probably the one can only be shown, by showing the other. 
Therefore I think the jury had better find certain acts, grants, &c. 
and find that they are all the grants and acts made by the State. 
For the like reason, I should think it well to find the original 
grants, gifts, or endowments upon which the college set out. 
Perhaps these are well enough recited in the charter. 

I should like to have all the late obnoxious acts found by the 
verdict. As to the assignment of errors, you will see the provision of the twenty-fifth section of the judiciary act. It will probably be better to assign the error relied on, namely, that the said 
statutes, of the said State of New Hampshire, are repugnant to 
the constitution of the United States and void. I do not know 
whether the general assignment would not be sufficient, but 
should prefer a special assignment also. 

It is our misfortune that our cause goes to Washington on a 
single point. I wish we had it in such shape as to raise all the 
other objections, as well as the repugnancy of these acts to the 
constitution of the United States. I have been thinking whether 
it would not be advisable to bring a suit, if we can get such 
parties as will give jurisdiction in the circuit court of New 
Hampshire. I have thought of this the more, from hearing of 
sundry sayings of a great personage. Suppose the corporation 
of Dartmouth College should lease to some man of Vermont 
(e. g. C. Marsh) one of their New Hampshire farms, and that 
the lessee should bring ejectment for it. Or suppose the trustees 
of Dartmouth College should bring ejectment in Vermont in 
the circuit court for some of the Wheelock lands. In either of 
these modes the whole question might get before the court at 
Washington. 

I suggest this only for consideration. Perhaps the known 
pendency of such a suit might induce Judge Smith, who fully 
intends to make the court's opinion in this case, to consider all 
the questions in the present cause. 

If I argue this cause at Washington, every one knows I can 
only be the reciter of the argument made by you at Exeter. You 
are, therefore, principally interested, as to the matter of reputation, in the figure I make at Washington. Nothing will be 
expected of me but decent delivery of your matter. This seerns 
perfectly well understood this way, and I have been often complimented by gentlemen saying that, if the cause goes to Washington, they shall have a chance of hearing something of Judge 
Smith's argument. 

I have some notion of coming to Exeter for a day or two, to 
practise and rehearse before I go to Washington. To be 
serious, however, you and Mason must help me arrange the 
argument. The best mode will be, to have it written out, or all 
collected in notes, so that I can write it out. 

For this purpose, I will see you or him, or both, before I go 
to Washington. As we know pretty well what will be the argument on the other side, at least you do, who have heard Chief 
Justice Richardson's opinion, we ought, in the opening argument, to cover the whole case. 

I here subjoin a printed form of writ of error, and the copy of 
a citation, which I find in the district clerk's office. 

Yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH. 

Boston, January 9, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I was not a little disappointed at your sudden 
departure from this town. Being under an obligation to go to 
Cambridge on Thursday, and expecting to meet you at Mr. 
Prescott's on Friday, it was quite unexpected to hear that you 

had left us. I wished to have said something on the college 
case confidentially. I shall now say it to Mr. Mason, whom I 
must see before I go, and he will communicate with you. My 
hopes of ultimate success are at present somewhat stronger 
than they ever have been. I must beg the favor of all your 
notes. I have not assurance enough, although not entirely destitute, to think of arguing this cause on my own strength. To 
argue it as you did would be more than I shall ever be able to 
do. I wish to present the cause fully and fairly to the court, 
and your notes will enable me so to do. If anybody is coming 
over, pray let me have them soon, and all of them. If you have 
no opportunity to send them direct, please forward them enclosed, to Mr. Mason. I am writing to him to-day, and will 
ask him to take care of the packet and to send it to me 
directly. 

I am, dear Sir, with unabated regard, yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, January 9, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, Mrs. Webster's situation will compel me to be 
at home some days to come. I know not how many. I must, 
at all events, see you before I go south, and if I cannot go 
down you must come up. I have something to say to you on 
the college cause, as well as many things to talk over on other 
topics. I must leave here about February 1. If by the 20th 
instant I can leave home, I shall go down and stay a day with 
you ; if not, you must come up. 

Judge Smith has been here. I heard of him at the theatre, 
the assembly room, &c., and I saw him a little at my own house, 
but had not half the necessary conversation with him. I have 
written to him to-day for his notes, and desired him to send 
them to me or to you to be sent to me. Be good enough to 
send yours, as I wish to be preparing a little. 

I have seen very little of Judge Otis. If, when I see him, he 
has any thing to say of Washington, I will let you know 
what it is. 

23* 
Mrs. Webster is very well, and desires her love to your 
family. 

I am, dear Sir, as ever yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I understand President Brown will be here next week. 
I shall send him home by Portsmouth. I hear nothing bad 
about the college case. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, January, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I must either accept your proposition to meet 
you at Newburyport, or persuade you to come here. Our 
court yet holds on; and since I last wrote you, I have been 
requested to take charge, at Washington, of a cause of much 
earlier standing on the docket than any in which I had previously a concern. The consequence is, that I must depart 
somewhat sooner than I intended, and that I shall be pressed 
much for time while I stay. If I go to Portsmouth, there are 
persons who will expect to see me there ; and indeed if I only 
allow the time necessary to go and return, staying a day with 
you, it will be more than I know how to spare. I must try to 
get off for Washington this day week. If you cannot come 
here, I will meet you at Newburyport, say on Sunday morning, 
if I hear from you to that effect. I hope, however, you will find 
it convenient to come here. You will have motive enough, in 
the natural desire of seeing Mary. If you will come up on 
Saturday, my house shall be closed upon us, we being in it, 
until your departure, on Monday morning, if such is your wish. 
On any other occasion, or at any other time, I would go a hundred miles to see you. I profess to be a sort of attendant on 
your course, in your orbit. But at present, if you can vary a 
little to accommodate the secondary planet, it would be a great 
favor. In addition to events in the house, I have been engaged for a fortnight, forenoon and afternoon, in indispensable 
drudgery. 

Under these circumstances, I shall wait to hear from you by 

Saturday morning's mail. I shall contrive to get to Newburyport by Sunday morning, if you so write. But I should esteem 
it a very particular obligation, which I would not request on 
slight reasons, if you could any way make it convenient to 
come here. 

Mrs. Webster is getting along very well. The daughter is 
in good health, and seems to take the world easy. 

With unabated regard yours, 

D. WEBSTEH, 

P. S. I saw Judge Story as he went on. He said he had 
had a correspondence with you about " things ; " but company 
being present, did not say what things. As usual, he told our 
lawyers here, that Mr. Mason was decidedly the first lawyer in 
New England. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Washington, February 22, 1818. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have hardly found enough to write about 
to make a letter, since I have been here. I wrote Judge Bell 
some time since, and nothing new has occurred in his case since, 
which you will please to inform him. I have hopes it will go 
over, but it is yet a little uncertain. The docket is not quite so 
formidable as was expected. The college case is not yet 
argued ; we expect it on this week. Wirt and Holmes are for 
defendant. Wirt is a man of . a good deal of ability ; he is 
rather more of a lawyer than I expected. 

I have been once or twice in the house. Those New Hampshire members to whom I had ever been known came to see me, 
except the judge ; I have seen nothing of him. 

The bankruptcy bill, I fear, will hardly pass, though it will 
come near it. The western gentlemen say the circuit courts 
must be established this session. On the whole, I think there 
is a fair chance for the adoption of the measure. 

The judge volunteered to tell me what correspondence had 
taken place, and he seems to be fixed in his purpose in that particular. You have a very ardent friend in Colonel Williams. 
I dined with him not long since. He took occasion to speak of 
you in such a manner that I had a pretty full conversation with 
him. He is a very good fellow. I only wish to say on this 
subject as much as shall let you know that at present all things 
wear a very favorable appearance. 

Mrs. Bagot inquires for Mrs. Mason, and Madame De Neuville asks for my brother-in-law, Mr. Mason ; I informed her that 
my brother-in-law was very well. The ministers are hospitable 
as usual. I have been once at Mrs. Monroe's ; it was very full. 
I have dined with the President. His style of life exceeds that 
of his predecessors. Washington is in all things pretty much 
what it was last year. I hope to get away from here early 
next month ; but I shall stay a week or two if necessary, to observe the course of things. Give my love to Mrs. Mason ; ask 
her to write often to Mrs. Webster. 

Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SULLIVAN. 

Washington, February 27, 1818. 

MY DEAR SIR, The Divina Pastora has not yet come on, 
but I have no doubt it will, at this term. I have attended to 
the case, and am as ready for it as I shall be. The prosecution 
against Palmer et al. adjourned here from Boston, presents 
many questions much connected with The Pastora. I expected 
that would be argued first, but it seems at present it will not 
I must, therefore, begin on the affairs of The Pastora. 

The bankrupt bill is lost ; it might have been carried if all 
New England had been in favor of it. I did not hear the debates, but report speaks well of the efforts of some of the Massachusetts members, particularly Mills and Whitman. I have 
hardly been half an hour in either House of Congress since I came 
here, a proof, I hope you will think, that I have no wish to get 
back there. Mr. and Mrs. Otis live within three doors, but I see 
little of them. Mr. Ashmun, I believe, has gone home. There 
are in the city a great number of Bostonians, more than I ever 
saw before at once. Brother John has arrived, and, going to 




work on Congress pretty much as he does on the New Hampshire legislature, has got a bill through the committee of the 
Senate about patents. Col. Perkins is expected to-day, I believe. 
Brother Amory and I are all the brethren of the Boston bar here, 
I forgot Mr. Blake. Ogden, and a Mr. Baldwin from New 
York ; Hopkinson, Sergeant, and C. J. Ingersoll, Philadelphia ; 
Harper, Winder, Baltimore; Wickham, Leigh, and Nicholas, 
from Virginia; Berrien, from Georgia, and the gentlemen of 
this District. Gaston was expected, but has not come. Court 
meets at eleven, hears long speeches till four, and adjourns. I 
have dined abroad every day since I came but one ; and the 
principal reason is, that the only boarding-house where I could 
get a: seat at table, is one in which one would seldom wish to 
dine at home. I have a room and a bed at a friend's house, 
Dr. Hunter's, and get my coffee in the morning with his family. 
So, on the whole, I am better off than most of my neighbors. I 
am filling up this sheet without saying what I had in view, 
principally, in writing to-day here it is. 

There is a prospect that the bill establishing circuit courts 

may pass at this term, making one judge on each circuit. 

and , as well as Mr. , will probably seek to be made 

judges. 

There is some chance, I think, of having a word to say on 
that subject ourselves. Therefore I am very desirous that Governor Brooks, Chief Justice Parker, General Sullivan, Mr. Prescott, and other such men, should not commit themselves to any 
candidate hastily, on the supposition that there is nothing but 
a choice of evils. You know Governor Brooks better than I do. 
Is there not danger of his lending his influence to some person, 
out of his disposition to oblige, before he knows the whole 
ground ? 

What induces me to write this, is that if such an office should 
be created, certain republican gentlemen here, would make an 
effort to get the appointment for Mr. Mason of New Hampshire. 
Judge Story, I believe, would exert himself to that end. Mr. 
Mason has left a high law character here, and several of the 
Democratic Senators, from the East and the West, would like 
to show him their respect, by recommending his appointment to 
such a place. Some of the Democratic gentlemen from New 
Hampshire would also urge his appointment. Now, if Gover' 



274 PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OP 

nor Brooks and the Suffolk bar think they can do no better, 
would it not be well for them to hold themselves free to support 
Mr. Mason in case, &c. ? This, of course, is pretty confidential. 
You may mention it, if you see fit, to Mr. Prescott, or a few 
other friends, but I would not have it spoken of aloud. As soon 
as the least chance of passing the bill appears, the candidates 
will spring up. No time should be lost to put Governor Brooks 
on his guard, if done at all. 

1 do not write to my wife to-day ; will you let her know of 
my welfare, and will you make a bow to Mrs. Sullivan, and 
shake hands with her, on my account ? 
Yours, dear General, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO REV. MR. BROWN. 

Washington, March 13, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, The argument in the cause of the college was 
finished yesterday. It occupied nearly three days. Mr. Holmes 
ventured to ask the court whether it was probable a decision 
would be made at this term. 

The chief justice in answer, said, that the court would pay to 
the subject the consideration due to an act of the legislature of 
a State, and a decision of a State court, and that it was hardly 
probable a judgment would be pronounced at this term. You 
can draw any inference from this which you think warranted. 
If the court saw no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that 
the decision in New Hampshire was right, it is not probable 
that, knowing the state of the college, they would put off the 
final decision for a twelve months. Mr. Wirt said all that the 
case admitted. He was replied to in a manner very gratifying 
and satisfactory to me by Mr. Hopkinson. 

Mr. Hopkinson understood every part of the cause, and in his 
argument did it great justice. No new view was suggested on 
the other side. I am informed that the bar here are decidedly 
with us in opinion. 

On the whole we have reason to keep up our courage. I am 
particularly glad that an ejectment is brought. It is just what 
should l)e done. You will see the necessity of not giving too 

much publicity to any thing written by me on this subject. 
You may say, however, to your friends, and give the students 
to understand, as far as useful, that the cause looks well here. 
I think it does look so at present, although I am not perhaps 
the best judge. The inference, too, to be drawn from the court's 
postponing the decision, is a very fair one to be used in the 
extent stated above, by you. 

As to the opinions of the bar, you would do well not to state 
that on my authority, although I believe what I have said to be 
strictly true. If any thing further occurs relative to the case, I 
shall write you again. 

Yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR, MASON. 

Washington, March 13, 1818. 

MY DEAR SIR, The argument in the college case terminated 
yesterday, having occupied nearly three days. On being inquired of by defendant's counsel whether the court would probably give a decision at this term, the chief justice answered 
" that the court would not treat lightly an act of the legislature 
of a State and the decision of a State court, and that the court 
would not probably render any judgment at this term." The 
cause was opened on our side by me. Mr. Holmes followed. 
His propositions, as near as I recollect were, 1. No jurisdiction, 
because both parties in same State. 2. Charter of 1769 not a 
contract ; trustees, public officers, like judges, and sheriffs, &c. ; 
college a part of government, &c. 3. All corporations abolished 
by Revolution. 4. If charter a contract, not impaired, a great 
kindness to old trustees to send them new assistants, &c. Upon 
the whole, he gave us three hours of the merest stuff that was 
ever uttered in a county court. Judge Bell was present, and 
had the pleasure of hearing him, but could not stay out his 
speech. Wirt followed. He is a good deal of a lawyer, and 
has very quick perceptions, and handsome power of argument ; 
but he seemed to treat this case as if his side could furnish 
nothing but declamation. He undertook to make out one legal 
point on which he rested his argument, namely, that Dr. Wheelock was not founder. In this he was, I thought, completely 
unsuccessful. He abandoned his first point, recited some foolish 
opinions of Virginians on the third, but made his great effort to 
support the second, namely, that there was no contract. On 
this he had nothing new to say. The old story of the public 
nature of the use a charter for the ultimate benefit of the people 
in the nature of a public institution like towns, &c. He 
made an apology for himself, that he had not had time to study 
the case, and had hardly thought of it, till it was called on. 

Upon the whole, no new matter or reasoning was brought 
forward ; and, in my opinion, the argument upon the law of the 
case on our side is not answered. Mr. Hopkinson made a most 
satisfactory reply, keeping to the law, and not following Holmes 
and Wirt into the fields of declamation and fine speaking. One 
pleasant thing occurred ; Holmes said, that " really, for his part, 
he could not see how nine could be a majority of twenty-one." 
Hopkinson looked up with much good-nature, and said aloud, 
that " he could make that out if any body could." 

I believe I may say that nearly or quite all the bar are with 
us. How the court will be I have no means of knowing. I 
shall write you again before I leave the place. 

Ever yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO- CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH. 

Washington, March 14, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, Our college cause has been argued, and its present posture is stated in the Intelligencer. I have no accurate 
knowledge of the manner in which the judges are divided. The 
chief and Washington, I have no doubt are with us. Duval 
and Todd perhaps against us; the other three holding up. I 
cannot much doubt but that Story will be with us in the end, 
and I think we have much more than an even chance for one of 
the others. I think we shall finally succeed. 

I opened the case with most of the principles and authorities 
on which we relied at Exeter. Your notes I found to contain 
the whole matter. They saved me great labor ; but that was 
not the best part of their service ; they put me in the right path, 

and conduct, as I think, to an irresistible conclusion. On some 
parts of the case, I have varied my views a little. The rogues 
here in congress, complain that the cause was put on grounds 
not stated in the court below. There is little or nothing in this. 
I labored the point that it was a private corporation, a charity. 
Eleazar Wheelock, its founder, as such, entitled generally by 
law to be visitor ; all the power of visitor assigned, in law, by 
him to the trustees, &c. The only new aspect of the argument 
was produced by going into cases to prove these ideas, which 
indeed lie at the very bottom of your argument. My talk occupied nearly a whole sitting. Holmes followed. He spoke three 
or four hours. His points were : 1. No jurisdiction because 
parties live in same State. 2. All corporations abolished by 
Revolution; and this never revived by constitution of New 
Hampshire. 3. Charter, not a contract, a mere appointment to 
office ; trustees agents of government ; property in fact given to 
the people. 4. If a contract, not impaired; only nine more 
assistants in their public duties, &c. Holmes did not make a 
figure. I had a malicious joy in seeing Bell sit by to hear him, 
while every body was grinning at the folly he uttered. Bell 
could not stand it. He seized his hat and went off. Mr. Wirt 
followed Holmes. He denied : 1. That Eleazar Wheelock was 
founder ; said he never gave any thing ; read Belknap, &c. not in 
the words of course. 2. Not a contract because not beneficial ; 
here came in all the New Hampshire opinion. 3. Not impaired 
(as Holmes) being only officers, the acts only gave them assistance, &c. &c. Wirt has talents, is a competent lawyer, and 
argues a good cause well. In this case he said more nonsensical things than became him. Hopkinson, in concluding, confined himself strictly to replying, and acquitted himself with 
ability. We finished with the third day. The next morning, 
yesterday, the chief justice told us the court had conferred; that 
there were different opinions, and that some judges had not 
formed opinions; consequently, the cause must be continued. 
When I began this letter, I supposed some little account of what 
I have now mentioned was in the Intelligencer of this morning ; 
but I since see that it is not. Bullard v. Bell has not come on. 
The court will rise this day. I depart to-morrow. 

Yours, 

D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, March 22, 1818. 

MY DEAR SIR, I arrived last evening from Washington^ 
having left the great city this day week. Of course I have little 
news to tell you. On the subject of the college cause, you 
know all I have to say. I send you your brief, and Judge 
Smith's ; you may both probably need those hereafter. I believe it is fully expected that a case, raising the question in the 
amplest form, will be presented at the circuit court. I have 
given some reason to expect this, and, unless for good causes, 
should be mortified if it were not so. 

Nothing seems likely to be done at Congress this session 
about the judiciary. I am rather glad of it ; for, upon consideration, I am exceedingly doubtful on the constitutional point. 
Others are the same way of thinking; at least the objection 
would be plausible. 

I conferred with very few on this subject. In general, I found 
what I thought -to be a sincere desire to accomplish an object 
particularly important to myself and others. One reason why 
nothing is Likely to be done this session is, that members of 
congress, at least some of them, are willing enough not to be 
excluded from the list of candidates. I think this weighs with 
certain Senators of Rome. 

Mrs. Webster is not very well. She has had a fair trial of 
her nursing talent, and is obliged to yield the point. 

We are procuring a wet-nurse for the child. When she is 
obtained, I have little doubt Mrs. Webster will enjoy full health. 

I send you three or four seed potatoes. 1 I brought them in 
rny trunk from New Jersey. The species is lately imported 
from England, and is a great favorite where known. 

Be good enough to plant them in your garden, and raise 
enough to see what they are. 

Mrs. Webster desires her love to Mrs. Mason, and beg to 
add my regards. 

Yours, truly, 

D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, March 30, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 14th or thereabouts, which 
had gone to Washington for me, and was returned hither by 
Mr. Hopkinson. I am glad an action is brought, and hope it 
will come on regularly at the May term. I doubt whether 
Judge Story will incline to give an opinion, and rather think he 
will prefer that the case should go directly to Washington. In 
this particular, however, he must take his own course. My 
reasons for thinking he would prefer deferring an opinion till 
next winter in the Supreme Court, are only general. I do not 
expect to be at Haverhill in May. I understand that Judge 
Story and Mr. Mason will both be there. It would be advisable, I think, that you should be personally at Portsmouth at 
the Circuit Court. In relation to what transpired at Washington, I do not know that I have any thing new to say. I believe 
I gave you in a letter from that place a general account of the 
trial. 

I have seen with particular regret some advertisement about 
dividing the society libraries ; what good can come from entertaining or talking of such purposes ? The course for yourself 
and friends, and the students under your care, seems to be, to 
act as if you expected a favorable result. If it should turn out 
otherwise, it will be time enough then for adopting such measures as the exigency may require. 

Do you expect to be this way this spring ? 

I am, dear Sir, yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I do not know whether I shall have any occasion to 
go to Portsmouth at the Circuit Court. If I should not, I will 
send to Mr. Mason my minutes, if he wishes it, that he may get 
any thing out of them if he can, to assist him in the argument 
of the cause. He, however, as well as Judge Smith, was, as 
you know, well prepared. I shall write Mr. Mason. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, April 12, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, Yours of the 7th came this morning, and as the 
mail returns, I believe to-morrow, I answer it this evening. 
Mr. Marsh miscalculates the probable delay of the actions. 

There is very little business in the Circuit Court in New 
Hampshire, and I have no great doubt the cause will be disposed of in some way within the first three days of the term. 
If Mr. Marsh intends seeing his counsel, he has no time to lose. 
He would do well to be at the court. If he is not, you must be 
there if possible. A client's presence is of no small importance 
on such occasions. 

I do not know that I shall have any business which will take 
me to Portsmouth, at the Circuit Court, and therefore shall not 
attend on account of these causes, unless you and your friends 
should have a distinct desire that I should so do ; I do not think 
it of the least importance. 

If you are this way you can look at my minutes, and such 
notes as I took at Washington of the arguments of others. 

You must not be too sanguine of ultimate success. All I 
would say is, that I think our chance now quite as good, if not 
a little better, than it ever was before. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, April 23, 1818. 

MY DEAR SIR, The plaintiff in the Edson cause requested 
my attendance at Portsmouth at the Circuit Court. I have 
agreed to go on his performance of certain conditions precedent; 
and probably it rests on this, whether I shall attend the court. 
As to the college cause, I cannot argue it any more, I believe. 
I have told you very often that you and Judge Smith argued it 
very greatly. If it was well argued at Washington, it is a 
proof that I was right, because all that I said at Washington 
was but those two arguments, clumsily put together by me. J 

do not mean to hold you answerable for any deficiencies ; but 
in truth have little right to claim the merit, if there be any, in 
the opening of our case. Since I came home, a young man in 
my office has assisted me to copy my minutes, and I have been 
foolish enough to print three or four copies. I committed this 
folly principally on the motion of some friends here, who were 
anxious to know something of the grounds of our case, of which 
they have been most deplorably uninformed. These copies are 
and will remain, except when loaned for a single day, under my 
own lock and key. They are hastily written off, with much 
abbreviation, and contain little else than quotation from the 
cases. All the nonsense is left out. There is no title or name 
to it. These precautions were taken to avoid the indecorum of 
publishing the creature. If I have a safe conveyance, I shall 
send one to you. You must not let Farrar see it, because he 
would wish to show it to President Brown and all. And perhaps I should do better to burn it, than to send it at all. Judge 
Story has been recently in town. I have no doubt he will 
incline to send up the new cause in the most convenient manner, without giving any opinion, and probably without an 
argument. If the district judge will agree to divide without 
argument, pro forma, I think Judge Story will incline so to dispose of the cause. A special verdict is the most convenient 
mode, I think. The verdict in the other cause I think very 
right, and from the same minutes one can be drawn in the 
present case. I shall be at Portsmouth whether I hear from 
Edson or not, unless I should be engaged at Ipswich. 

Mr. Prescott is judge, a very good thing for the county of 
Suffolk, and not so bad a thing for himself as it might at first 
seem. He will receive about three thousand dollars per annum. 
He does not wish and has repeatedly declined a seat on the 
other bench, on account of its great labor, and being willing to 
leave the bar pretty soon, this seems to be an eligible retirement. 
We shall endeavor to get along without him at the bar, and 
bear our loss as well as we can. 

We expect Mrs. Mason to see us next month, and she has 
partly promised to bring her husband. 

Yours truly, D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Boston, May 14, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, Among those who have applied for the appointment of an appraiser under the late law, is Mr. Isaac P. Davis. 
He thinks the aid of your neighbor, Mr. Silsbee, to whom he is 
well known, would be useful to him. The object of this is, if 
you should see Mr. Silsbee to-day, to beg of you the favor of 
suggesting the thing to him, that if he should see fit he may 
address a line to any of his friends at Washington. There 
have been many previous applications, and some of them, and 
as far as I know all, by very fit and proper men. I think Mr. 
Davis's chance of success not great; but it would be gratifying 
to himself and friends that he should be well recommended. 
You, yourself, can best judge whether it would be worth while 
for you to give him a letter. I say this confidentially ; because 
as there is no great prospect of success, you might incline to 
think that your name and influence should be reserved for a 
more promising occasion. It will be time enough to think of 
this part of the case after you arrive here. In the mean time, 
if you should have occasion to see Mr. Silsbee, and should 
suggest to him Mr. Davis's wish, it would oblige him and his 
friends. 

I am, dear Sir, as always, with great regard yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Ipswich, April 28, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, Mr. March's account of the probable disposition 
of the college actions, seems to leave no occasion at all for my 
be ing at Portsmouth, and my engagements here render it truly 
considerably inconvenient. I could not leave at all till Friday 
evening ; and your court will probably rise on Saturday. 

I saw Judge Story as I came along. He is evidently expecting a case which shall present all the questions. It is not of 
great consequence whether the actions or action, go up at 






DANIEL WEBSTER. 

this term, except that it would give it at an earlier standing on 
the docket next winter. 

The question which we must raise in one of these actions, is, 
"whether, by the general principles of our governments, the 
State legislatures be not restrained from divesting vested 
rights?" This of course, independent of the constitutional 
provision respecting contracts. On this question I have great 
confidence in a decision on the right side. This is the proposition with which you began your argument at Exeter, and 
which I endeavored to state from your minutes at Washington. 
The particular provisions in the New Hampshire Constitution 
no doubt strengthen this general proposition in our case ; but 
on general principles, I am very confident the court at Washington would be with us. 

If so, then nothing will remain but this : " Are the powers, 
privileges, or authorities of the trustees under this charter rights, 
within the meaning of the proposition ? Are they franchises, 
liberties, or privileges, such as the law protects, or are they 
merely disinterested duties, or official services." I cannot state 
this question very accurately, but this is the general idea. If 
we get up one of these cases in due form, we shall defeat our 
adversaries. 

I shall come and stay a week with you, as soon as our 
Circuit Court is over. One reason for not going now, is that 
Mrs. Webster cannot go, and I could not stay. I want to make 
a bargain with you for a summer trip somewhere this year ; say 
Albany, &c., or Montreal, &c. Think of these things a little. 
The robbery trial commences to-morrow morning. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Judge Story goes down in the stage-coach on Friday 
morning. 



MR. WEBSTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH. 

Boston, July 2, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, President Adams has expressed a wish to see 
Chalmers's opinions of eminent men, and I have promised him 
a sight of it. If you will have the goodness to send the volumes 
up, they will be much at your service another time, if you 
should need them. I suppose he wishes to see them now, as 
he is writing on colonial affairs. They will come safely by the 
driver of the stage-coach, I believe, if no other mode offers. If 
they can be left at Langmaid's, to be brought by the driver of 
the mail stage-coach, I shall get them without difficulty. 

Yours as ever, 

D. WEBSTER. 

[NOTE. On the next page of the sheet on which the above letter was written, 
is a sketch of Judge Smith's answer, in the last part of which there is something 
so characteristic of him, that it was thought best not to resist the inclination to 
transcribe it.] 

Exeter, July 7, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I did not receive yours of the 2d till last evening. 
I shall endeavor to send the books this evening to Langm aid's 
for the mail stage-driver, and will bribe him to fidelity, the only 
way to make a stage-coach man honest. On the subject of 
colonial ambiguities, there are so few capable of illustrating 
them, that every attempt of that sort deserves encouragement. 
I hope the old gentleman will persevere to the end and leave the 
world some fruits of his long and laborious life. It is a provoking thing to have knowledge, which, God knows, the living 
need, covered up in the grave with these vile bodies. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, July 16, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, You are not much accustomed, I believe, to forget your duties ; and some apology would seem necessary for 
reminding you of things, which in all probability you have fully 
attended to. There are two topics, however, upon each of 
which I will repeat the expression of a wish. The first is the 
letter to Mr. Hopkinson ; the second, care to prevent any public 
use being made of our argument. Mr. Gilbert informs me that 
a copy has been given to the students, and I am fearful their 
zeal in a good cause may lead them possibly to make an indiscreet use of it. I rely on you for safety against such evils. I 

am quite satisfied our course is right. The argument will cease 
to do good, if used in any other way than that in which we 
have used it. Pray caution the students against publishing it, 
or any part of it. The printer also should be admonished not 
to say any thing about it. 

We have nothing new about the final result. As far as I 
learn, those who have paid attention to the question are more 
and more convinced that we have the right side. 

Very truly yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. D. PUTNAM TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Brooklyn, Conn., July 17, 1818. 

SIR, I have read with deep interest and great satisfaction 
an article in the North American Review, vindicating the character of General Putnam and his conduct on the 17th of June, 
1775. If the attack was violent and unexpected, the defence 
has been valiant and effectual to the satisfaction of the public 
mind. For the distinguished part which your love of justice 
has contributed towards it, I pray you to accept the grateful 
thanks of the family, and my own individual acknowledgment 
of obligation, greater than it will ever be in my power to repay. 

It is due however to the relation I stand in to General Putnam, to maintain with modesty what he always asserted with 
confidence, that the command on Bunker Hill was his. If this 
could not be done without taking from the gallant and deserving Prescott, any part of the glory which always has and I 
hope ever will be awarded by his grateful country, for the persevering valor with which he defended the principal objects of 
assault, I should be among the last to make the claim, in 
favor even of a father. 

But this business has been candidly and I hope satisfactorily 
stated in the last of a series of numbers in the Centinel, which 
do honor to the head and heart of the writer, and give to Putnam and Prescott the commendation appropriately due to each ; 
leaving nothing for the friends of either to wish or regret. 

I have the honor to be, most respectfully, Sir, 

Your most obedient and much obliged servant, 

DAN'L PUTNAM. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Boston, August 16, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I have been looking over a file of English 
newspapers, in order to learn the proceedings of Parliament, at 
its late session, on the subject of redressing abuses in charities. 
The measure originated with Mr. Brougham. The complaint 
was, that funds given to charitable purposes, especially such as 
were connected with education, were often abused, unproductive, &c. fec. The remedy proposed was a commission to inquire into the state of such charities. What was to be done 
in the end was not provided for in the bill. The object of the 
bill was merely to obtain information. The universities and 
the great schools were excepted out of the provisions of the 
bill. When it got to the House of Lords, it met with opposition, on several grounds. In its progress, Lord Eldon took 
occasion to say something on the right of legislative interference. I send you herewith the paper which contains his 
remarks. In the further progress of the bill in the House of 
Lords, it was amended by excepting from its operation " all 
charitable endowments having special visitors ; " thus amended, 
it passed both Houses with Lord Eldon's concurrence. 

As nothing but inquiry was proposed, I do not see any 
great objection to the bill, as it was, but I think its history 
shows, 1. That the English lawyers recognize a difference 
between charities having visitors, and such as have none. Indeed, I did not observe, till lately, that the commissions, issued 
under the statute of Elizabeth, do not extend to charities with 
visitors. 2. I think we may see that Parliament is not supposed to have the power of new-modelling, and directing to 
new uses, at its own pleasure, charitable funds, arising from 
donations of individuals, and by them subjected to the forum 
domesticum. I do not find the debate in the House of Lords, 
when the amendment stated above was introduced. If I 
should light upon it, I will preserve it. 

According to your wish, I send you a copy of such memoranda of cases, &c., as I have met with, relative to the college 
question. They are of small importance. 

Yours, with the greatest regard, 

D. W. 

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

September 9, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I send you five copies of our argument. If you 
send one of them to each of such of the judges as you think 
proper, you will of course do it in the manner least likely to 
lead to a feeling that any indecorum has been committed by 
the plaintiffs. The truth is, the New Hampshire opinion is able, 
ingenious, and plausible. It has been widely circulated, and 
something was necessary to exhibit the other side of the question. 

I have read the article on " Maritime Law " with the highest 
delight. There is a great deal that is new to me, and will be 
most useful to thej)rofession. Your compliment to Chancellor 
Kent was happily turned, and well deserved. His brother, 
Moss Kent, of Albany, is a personal acquaintance of mine, and 
not knowing how many copies of the North American Review 
might be taken in Albany, I yesterday sent one to him. I 
think this Number a very good one. 

To-day I have been at work for Wheaton, although I have 
not seen the book yet. Whatever I write must pass your 
revision. Very truly, your obedient servant, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, November 9, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I received yours yesterday. It will not be 
necessary to decide on the subject of other counsel until I see 
you. You do not appear to apprehend my reasons exactly, and 
I can explain them better ore tenus; suffice it to say, at present, 
that, although if nothing- should be necessary in the way of 
argument but a reply, Mr. Hopkinson, or myself, might do 
that, yet if it should be necessary to go over the whole ground 
again, some new hand must come into the cause. My own 
impression is to apply, in case of need, to some gentleman 
there on the spot. Let this rest till January. 

As to money and compensation, &c., I hardly know what 
to say about it. As to myself, considerations of that sort have 
not added greatly to my interest in the case. I am aware also, 
that others, whose labors are more useful than mine, are obliged 
to confer gratuitous services. The going to Washington, however, is no small affair, and is attended with great inconvenience 
to my practice here. My other inducements to attend the ensuing term are not great, not so much so as last year, while the 
sacrifice here will be greater. 

As to Mr. Hopkinson, he has put the case on such ground, 
that nothing can be done about his compensation till a final 
decision. If that should be as we hope, something honorable 
must be done for him ; towards which I expect to contribute in 
proportion to my means, and in common with other friends. 
I hope you will be here a little sooner than January 15, as I 
hope to be able to set off by that time. I rely on you for all 
necessary knowledge of Moore's Charity School; not caring, 
however, so much about it as you seem to. The cause has 
gone too far to be influenced by small circumstances of variance. 

I hear nothing unfavorable. Our friends say sometimes that 
the university people abate nothing of their confidence, which, I 
confess, a little surprises me, as I think they cannot but observe 
the general tendency of professional opinion. Mr. Hough says, 
u hundred and fifty copies of our argument have been printed 
at the Patriot office and distributed. I hope they will do no 
hurt. Yours, very truly, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 

P. S. I wish you to understand that if I go to Washington, 
and am paid for it, anything necessary for new counsel there, I 
shall pay. It is not my intention that any arrangement of this 
sort shah 1 increase expense. I am not certain that a new argument will be ordered, and am still more doubtful whether a 
new opening on our side will be called for. But this is possible, and if so, some gentleman must repeat our view, and add 
what he or we may have obtained new. This event or course 
of things is not probable, but possible. 



MR. HOPKINSON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Washington, November 17, 1818. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, On my arrival here I received your letter 
of the 9th instant, just as I was about to write to you on the 

same subject. In my passage through Baltimore, I fell in with 
Pinkney, who told me he was engaged in the cause by the present University, and that he is desirous to argue it, if the court 
will let him. I suppose he expects to do something very extraordinary in it, as he says Mr. Wirt " was not strong enough for 
it, has not back enough." There is a wonderful degree of harmony and mutual respect among our opponents in this case. 
You may remember how Wirt and Holmes thought and spoke 
of qach other. On receiving this information from Mr. Pinkney, 
I seriously reflected upon the course it would be proper forjis to 
take ; and I assure you most truly, I decided precisely in favor 
of that suggested by you. It cannot be expected we shall repeat 
our argument merely to enable Mr. Pinkney to make a speech, 
or that a cause shall be re-argued, because, after the argument 
has been concluded, and the court has the case under advisement, either party may choose to employ new counsel. I think 
if the court consents to hear Mr. Pinkney, it will be a great 
stretch of complaisance, and that we should not give our consent to any such proceeding ; but if Mr. Pinkney, on his own 
application, is permitted to speak, we should claim our right of 
reply. The court cannot want to have our argument repeated ; 
and they will hardly require us to do it for the accommodation 
of Mr. Pinkney. However, we shall have an opportunity to 
consult more fully on these matters. 

We shall have the message, I presume, to-day, and I shall 
send you one. Interesting matter is looked for; but this is 
usual. As to the bankrupt law, I shall feel about, and if I discover any chance of success, I shall make another effort for it. 
Perhaps it will be advisable to get another vote upon it, without again discussing the whole subject at large, as it is the 
same congress. 

God bless you, yours truly, 

J. HOPKINSON. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 



Boston, December 6, 1818. 

DEAR SIR, I was very glad to receive yours, as I wished to 
know something of your health, having heard of your indisposiVOL. i. 25 
tion. I trust you will by no means expose yourself until your 
recovery is complete. As to money concerns, I am of opinion, 
which I speak freely, that little is to be accomplished here without you. If the professors, &c. can employ the vacation in 
recruiting for the immediate wants of the college government, 
each in that region of the country where he may have most 
friends, it may be very well. This quarter, I think, had better 
be left till you shall be able to visit it. As far as relates to any 
provision for the expenses at Washington, &c., I would have 
every thing remain as it is, unless you should be able to come 
down, and would by no means have you come unless your 
health should be altogether restored. I must try to get along 
with things as well as I can. However, if you should think fit 
to try what can be done here without yourself, I think it would 
be useful, if practicable, to join such a man as Mr. Pay son or 
Mr. Olcott with such a man as Dr. Payson. 

I am as yet not well informed on the topics connected with 
the will, and with the school. I hope your health will enable 
you to give me some view of this subject. It will save me both 
labor and time ; the latter of which I shall have little to spare 
between this and the 15th January. I have read the will. The 
general impression I took from it was not at all unfavorable to 
our general doctrine. Perhaps a second reading might enable 
me to see something else. As to the school, if you wish the act 
of 1807, in the verdict, which is perhaps admissible, I think you 
had better write to Judge Smith on the subject soon. I think 
I heard that all papers were to be furnished, so as to make up 
the case by January 1. I do not think it will be easy, perhaps not 
possible, to get the court to say any thing about the school. 
They will think that " sufficient, " &c. At the same time I 
should not expect much difficulty about the school, if the question should be decided right with the college. 

Let me hear from you every week, respecting your health. If 
any thing further occurs to me I shall write again. Writing 
lately to Dr. P. to acknowledge a copy of his " Eulogy," I took 
occasion to ask whether Mrs. W. intended to enter her appearance voluntarily in the suit now at Washington. If not, I am 
inclined to give her notice so to do. 

Yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, January 10, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, A letter came to me to-day, addressed to you, 
bearing the Hanover postmark. As it was not superscribed in a 
lady's hand, I presumed it might relate to the common cause, 
and might be intended to communicate information important 
for me to have. I therefore opened it. It was from Mr. Shurtleff, containing some little account of movements on the other 
side. I do not think it necessary to send it back to you. 

I have nothing new to say. No public or general opinion 
seems to be formed of the opinion of any particular judge. I 
hope no judge, if he has formed an opinion, will communicate 
it, or hint what it is ; inasmuch as it would commit him, which 
would be likely to make him more tenacious, and so be worse 
for us, if his opinion should be against us, or it might diminish 
the weight of his opinion upon others, if it should be in our 
favor. I hope the judges will come together without its being 
known at all what opinions any particular judge may have 
formed. 

I have received the records from Mr. Farrar, and I believe am 
prepared with aU necessary papers. The book of memoirs I 
shall not carry. Dr. Perkins can lend me one, if I should 
want it. 

If any thing new occurs before I leave home, I shall write you. 
You may expect early and frequent intelligence from Washington. Very truly, yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH. 

Washington, February 2, 1819. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have the pleasure to tell you that the college 
cause has been decided in our favor. The Chief Justice, 
Washington, Livingston, Johnson, and Story, Justices, concurrentibus ; Duval, Justice, dissentients ; absente^ Todd. The 
opinion was delivered by the chief. I believe other judges also 
drew up opinions, which I hope to see published. 

With all reasonable congratulation and rejoicing, I am, dear 
Sir, Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, February 2, 1819. 

MY DEAR EZEKIEL, All is safe. Judgment was rendered this 
morning, reversing the judgment in New Hampshire. Present : 
Marshall, Washington, Livingston, Johnson, Duval, and Story. 
All concurring but Duval ; and he giving no reason to the contrary. The opinion was delivered by the Chief Justice. It was 
very able and very elaborate ; it goes the whole length, and 
leaves not an inch of ground for the University to stand on. 
Yours affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER, in court 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Washington, February 2, 1819. 

MY DEAR SIR. All is safe and certain. The Chief Justice 
delivered an opinion this morning, in our favor, on all the points. 
In this opinion, Washington, Livingston, Johnson, and Story, 
Justices, are understood to have concurred. Duval, Justice, it 
is said, dissents. Mr. Justice Todd is not present. The opinion 
goes the whole length, and leaves nothing further to be decided. 
I give you my congratulations on this occasion ; and assure you 
that I feel a load removed from my shoulders much heavier than 
they have been accustomed to bear. 

Very truly, yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. HOPKINSON TO MR. BROWN. 

Washington, -February 2, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, I have the pleasure of enclosing you a letter informing you of great matters. Our triumph in the college cause 
has been complete. Five judges, only six attending, concur 
not only in a decision in our favor, but in placing it upon principles broad and deep, and which secure corporations of ttis 
description from legislative despotism and party violence for the 
future. The Court goes all lengths with us, and whatever trouble 
these gentlemen may give us in future, in their great and pious 
zeal for the interests of learning, they cannot shake those principles which must and will restore Dartmouth College to its 
true and original owners. I would have an inscription over the 
door of your building, " Founded by Eleazar Wheelock, E,efounded by Daniel Webster." 

I wish you, Sir, much happiness and success in promoting the 
usefulness of the institution, and proving to the world that it has 
changed hands. Most respectfully, 

Your obedient servant, 

Jos. HOPKINSON. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Washington, February 23, 1819. 

MY DEAR SIR, In the action The Trustees v. Woodward, 
judgment is entered, nunc pro tune, as of last term. This 
relieves us from any difficulty that might arise from Mr. Woodward's death. The other causes are not yet reached, but I am 
inclined to think they will take this course, namely : They must, 
in any event, go back to the Circuit Court for judgment. Of 
course, in that event, if other material facts exist, the parties 
would have an opportunity of establishing those facts. You 
understand that the cause comes here, not for judgment, but 
for a direction to the Circuit Court what judgment to give on 
the verdict in that court. But after having received direction 
what judgment to give on that verdict, the circuit might, in 
its discretion, give the party an opportunity of altering the 
VOL. i. 26 
state of facts, if he could. This is but the common case of 
granting a new trial, which is frequent. I do not see that it 
would do us any good to get a direction from the court here to 
the Circuit Court what judgment to render on this verdict, 
because, the parties say, they have new facts, and they may, for 
aught I know, be permitted to prove these new facts in this 
very cause. As to arguing the case here, upon admissions of 
new facts, it is out of all question. They will state one fact, 
we shall state an inconsistent or repugnant fact, what judgment 
can be formed on such materials ? The impossibility of this 
will be seen just as soon as we approach the question. If, 
therefore, the other side have an argument here, it must be on 
precisely the old facts. Now I think Mr. P. and Mr. W. 
having seen the opinions of the court, will hardly attempt that. 
It will therefore come to this. The cause will be sent back 
without further discussion here. These verdicts will be set 
aside, so far as to admit proof of other pertinent facts. They 
will then, if they please, offer proof of a particular fact. We 
shall object on the ground that that fact is not material, or pertinent. The judge will decide this, and if they do not like the 
decision, they will tender a bill of exceptions. Of all the 
courses which offer themselves, this seems to be the most safe 
and easy for us. All this goes on the ground that there should 
remain a serious intention of further litigation. But I am of 
opinion, inter nos, that any such intention will be abandoned, 
that counsel here will be willing to be rid of it, and do not wish 
to argue it again. For the moment there is fermentation in 
New Hampshire ; I suspect it will go off with the election ; and 
when the case is printed, I do not think any counsel will advise 
to any further contest. At any rate, the course above indicated 
seems to me the natural one for the business to take. I am 
persuaded it will take it. You will not, therefore, probably hear 
of any new arguments at this term. I hope to get away from 
this place in season to get home by March 10 or 15. 

I am, dear Sir, yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Washington, February 25, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, Yours I received last evening. The new causes 
will be disposed of as I mentioned to you in my last. I am 
quite satisfied with this arrangement, and do not expect much 
further trouble in the case. We shall get a judgment, 1 trust, 
at May term, even if the friends of the University should be 
advised that it is worth their while to attempt to renew the 
contest. I hope they will be better advised, both for their own 
sake and yours. You need the use of the buildings, and I 
hope they will admit you to possession without further inconvenience or delay. I am quite confident that there can be no 
reasonable expectation of changing the decision ; and though it 
may be inconvenient to you, it can do no good to the other side 
to continue the contest. 

I hope to be at home by the 15th March. I should be glad to 
see you at that time ; some things which must be done, may 
better be done then than afterwards. I shall carry with me the 
materials for the book ; and if it is made, it ought to be put to 
press without a day's delay. Let me at least find a letter from 
you at Boston on my arrival, say the 13th. The sooner after 
that that you are there, the better. 

Very truly yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, April 14, 1819. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am happy to hear that Mrs. Woodward is so 
well advised as to be disposed to surrender the property according to agreement. I should be equally happy to see the President 
of the University wise enough to deliver the books and apparatus, and retire from the contest without giving anybody further 
trouble. His own reputation and character, I should think, would 
be as much benefited by that course as your convenience. Tf 
he thinks otherwise, however, he has a right to judge for himseif. 
I do not know any thing which is necessary to be done by way 
of preparation. I have written to Mr. Mason repeatedly. Mr. 
Olcott must be there ; his presence will be essentially necessary 
on many accounts. I wish him to bring with him your affidavit of the notice given by you to Mr. Allen and Dr. Perkins, of 
our intention to proceed to final judgment in these causes this 
term, and the time of giving such notice. Mr. Mason has given 
notice to the counsel. I flatter myself the cause will not be put 
off to October term without reason. 

The University folks should understand, very distinctly, that 
we are resolved to bring this controversy to an immediate end, 
and that they are to have no delay, except such as they can 
obtain by law. There is a fable of the old man and the boy 
who stole his apples, which it would be edifying for the gentlemen connected with the University to read. 

I think of nothing necessary to be done by the trustees 
particularly. 

As to the proposals, I hear little of them. Mr. Lamson of 
Exeter was here, and finding nothing done, attempted gratuitously to do something ; and I helped him as I could. Nothing 
effectual will be done from Portsmouth on that subject. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, April 14, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, 1 write this to add that I think it would be very 
fortunate if President Allen, Dr. Perkins, and their friends, 
should be at Portsmouth. 

I have reason to think they would learn that the new grounds 
upon which they wish to put their case, would not change the 
opinion of the judges, or any of them, in any respect. Perhaps, 
however, you could not suggest this to them ; I think you cannot. But if they should attend of their own heads, it would be 
well. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 



MR. HOPKINSON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Bordentown, April 19, 1819. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, It is but time and labor thrown away to 
attempt to do that which we know to be impossible. This 
proposition seems to me to be so clear that nobody but Luther 
Martin, who delights in amplitude, or P. Barbour, whose logical 
head disdains to take any thing for granted, would give a 
moment to prove it. I shall presume that you admit it, and 
proceed to say that this is precisely the case, in relation to 
making up either the speech I did make or one I did not make, 
in our college cause, from the notes which served well enough 
to guide me through the argument at the time of the trial. The 
chain of connection, the whole course of thought, are now so 
entirely lost and gone with the things " beyond the flood," that 
they are as much out of my power as Noah's ark, or Jacob's 
ladder. All I can do is to give good counsel instead of a bad 
speech, to wit, that it be stated in its proper place in the big 
book, that the argument of Mr. Hopkinson at large could not be 
obtained, but that it consisted of a repetition of the principles 
opened by Mr. Webster, enforcing and illustrating them by 
various cases and arguments ; and giving full and satisfactory 
answers to the arguments urged by the counsel on the other 
side. Something of this will answer all the purpose. 

I will write to you shortly on our matter of business. 

God bless you, yours, 

J. HOPKINSON. 

P. S. I have heard you Boston folks brag that the codfish 
we get are not the thing ; but you have a certain animal called 
a " Dun fish," much superior. Can you procure me a box, and 
send it to Philadelphia? Cost and charges will be cheerfully 
paid by J. H. 

26* 


MR. WEBSTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH. 

Boston, May 12, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, I send you by Judge Peabody your argument 
and Mason's, bungingly put together by me. Right or wrong, 
I have done the deed. So great, and how great you know, was 
the want of information on this subject by our best men, that I 
could endure it no longer. Some few copies are printed, not to 
be published, but to be read by those who ought to understand 
the subject a little. I shall take all care I can not to let the 
things get much abroad. It is, as you see, nameless ; and it 
may go "unclaimed of any man." I have been more than 
usually silly on this occasion ; ascribe it to having been six 
weeks at Washington. Mr. Wells has received a few new 
books ; not yet opened. If you wish any particular book which 
he is likely to have, I will look out for it, if you let me know 
soon. I believe he has the latest reports. 

Always very truly yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, May 30, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, James T. Austin, Esq., in behalf of the University, presented the new facts to Judge Story on Thursday. They 
were what we expected and no more. The judge said, he saw 
nothing to vary at all the case, as it had been considered and 
decided. None of these " facts," if true, changed the ground ; 
nor did he see any the least contradiction between any of these 
facts and the recitals of the charter. He was willing, however, 
to take the papers and read them attentively, to the end that he 
might fully ascertain whether they presented any new point 
which could be material. He accordingly took home the papers, 
and to-morrow or the next day, will probably announce his final 
decision. There is no doubt about it. These new facts, 
whether true or false, have nothing to do with the question ; 
and you may expect judgment and execution in the causes in 
the Circuit Court, June 10, as by arrangement made at Ports
mouth. I am glad you have made a bargain for the house, 
provided it is a good bargain. The house, I think, will suit 
your purpose, and a house you needed. If in order to furnish 
it, you have occasion to order any articles from here, you will 
do me a favor by directing the venders to present their bills to 
me ; I will pay them, and be reimbursed at your convenience. 

Very truly yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I trust you will write me before you leave Concord, 
and let me know what temper you find prevalent there. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, June 28, 1819. 

DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 13th, and have felt in too 
much spleen to answer it. Whoso meddleth with type-setters 
gets into trouble. You have narrated the progress, present state, 
and prospects of our book, in a manner to make one's blood 
run cold. 

It appears to me as desperate as it does to you, and I believe the safest way is to make up our minds that we shall have 
no book ; none at least in this generation. I wrote to Mr. Farrar, have got his answer, and written again. He thinks the 
book will be out at Commencement. If it should not be well 
printed, and on our good paper, it will not sell, and a new book 
will be published. I have so stated to Mr. Farrar, and he may 
be assured it is true. . . 

I suppose you go to Haverhill about this time. My wife and 
I have made up our minds to a journey, which will occupy us 
till toward the end of July. We shall go to the North River, 
and perhaps to the Springs. We expect to leave here about the 
5th July. I am sorry to inform you that Mr. Gore is ill again. 
His other knee has become affected. It is now some time since 
this was the case, and I have heard within a day or two of his 
being a little better, still he is quite unwell. We have no news 
here, nor is any thing doing. 

It is very much my wish that you would not decline the 
trusteeship. It will give great satisfaction this way, and by 
staying a single year, you can do a great deal of good. Judge 
Story is going to Commencement, with his wife. We will 
make a party, and go your way, and take you and Mrs. Mason. 

Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, August 10, [1819.] 

MY DEAR SIR, We have at length returned from an unexpectedly long journey. Our trip extended to Philadelphia, and on 
our return, we went up the North River as far as Albany, from 
which place we came home without finding it necessary on 
account of health to drink the Spring waters. Mrs. Webster 
is for the present satisfied with riding and will not think of 
going to Hanover ; I believe I shall attempt it. As you have 
been somewhat stationary through the summer, I hope you will 
come up. I propose to go from here in such season as to be at 
Concord or Boscawen on Sunday evening. It is then an easy 
day's ride to Hanover ; I shall go up in my chaise, and should 
be particularly glad to meet you at Concord. I do not think 
Judge Story will go up ; he has engagements here which he 
cannot well leave. I shall ask the driver of the stage-coach to 
deliver you this, and to take an answer, if you have one. It 
will be very gratifying if I should learn that you contemplate 
this expedition. 

Mrs. Webster and myself desire our best respects to be given 
to Mrs. Mason. 

Yours truly, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I possibly may go from here on Friday morning, and 
so shall not get your answer unless you send it to-morrow by 
the driver. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, September 26, [1819.] 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I have received yours this moment, and 
shall be most happy to give you and procure for you all letters 
in my power. Be good enough to let me know when it will be 
seasonable to write you at Hanover, and when you may probably go. It will give me the most sincere gratification to give 
you letters to my friends in Philadelphia, Charleston, Washington, 
and Savannah ; but as in some of these places my acquaintance 
is not great, I shall be happy to find you letters from other gentlemen. Have the goodness to say what places you may be 
likely to visit, and in the mean time I shall be preparing letters 
to gentlemen in the places where I have acquaintance. I will 
obtain letters, as I am sure I can, from Judge Story and Dr. 
Kirkland. 

I rejoice in every amendment of your health, and am most 
truly, Your friend, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Please let me hear from you by return of mail. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BROWN. 

Boston, October 5, 1819. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have paid Mr. Lang's draft, eighty dollars, 
and have also given him one hundred dollars for you. For the 
balance, three hundred and twenty dollars, you can either draw 
your bill, or order, in such sums as suit you, and at times convenient, on your journey, as you may direct me to send it to you, 
at New York or Philadelphia; in either of which cases your 
commands will be obeyed. If you prefer the money to be sent 
you, write me to that effect before you leave Hanover. Mr. 
Professor Haddock, being himself a traveller, can tell you what 
will be most convenient for you in that respect. Mr. Lang's 
departure is to be so soon that I shall not be able, with entire 
convenience, to send up the balance by him. I can easily, however, cause it to meet you, either in Philadelphia or New 
York. 

I send you a few letters, and hope to have some from Dr. 
Kirkland to meet you in Philadelphia. I shall send them to the 
care of Charles Chauncey, Esq., counsellor at law, Walnut 
street, to whom you have a letter. I have asked Mr. Dwight 
for letters, which he has kindly furnished, and which I enclose. 
I hope you will see Mr. Wolsey in New York, a brother-in-law 
of the late President Dwight, and an excellent man. 

I have written two letters to Charles March, Esq., New York. 
He is a merchant, a son of Dr. Clement March, deceased, Greenland, New Hampshire. One is a letter of introduction, the 
other you will see and use or not use according to your occasion. I will only add that you must omit nothing beneficial 
to your health on account of expense. If the " ways and 
means " fall short, write to me from any place, at any time, and 
some way or another we will see your necessary funds forthcoming. 

May God bless and preserve you and yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

Mr. C. March is now here, and I told him you would call on 
him, probably in New York. He will be glad to see you. 
Since writing I enclose fifty dollars. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, Saturday evening, 8 o'clock, October, 1819. 
MY DEAR SiR,-^Enclosed you have a letter from Mr. Gore. 
Mrs. Webster and I have been there to-day, where we had 
the pleasure of meeting Mr. King. Mr. King expressed a great 
wish to see you ; said he had thought of going as far as Portsmouth, but could not well go there, without going further, and 
it would not be convenient at this time to go to Maine. The 
object of this is to join Mr. and Mrs. Gore, and Mr. King, in the 
wish that you and Mrs. Mason would come up next week and 
make us a visit. Mr. King will probably stay at Mr. Gore's 
until the latter part of next week. I hope you and Mrs. Mason 

will find it convenient to come up, as it will give us great 
pleasure to see you, and it will also gratify Mr. Gore and Mr. 
King. Our household is now well. We have a chamber, as 
usual, for you, and shall depend on your coming directly here. 
The circuit court sits here next week ; there is nothing to do in 
it ; it is as lean as your Exeter circuit court, and, as far as I now 
know, will not engage me a single day. On all accounts it 
would be pleasant to have a visit from you now. I send this 
by the driver, in order to anticipate a day, as the mail for tomorrow is closed. Please favor me with a line to-morrow 
afternoon, in answer to this, and be kind enough to say that 
you will be her.e on Tuesday. 

Mrs. Webster desires me to say to Mrs. Mason that she 
must come ; and that, you know, is the end of a lady's argument. 

In the hope of seeing you, 

I am yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

N. B. As I always choose to end my own arguments, I take 
the liberty to fill this little space in my husband's letter, my 
dear Mrs. Mason, to beg that you and Mr. Mason will gratify 
us with a visit next week. We are quite alone, and I am ready 
to attend you any where, being very much at leisure, and shall be 
very much disappointed if you do not come. With much love, 

Truly yours, 

G. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, Sunday evening, [1819.] 

DEAR SIR, I send the creature, and commend it to your 
creet use. I hope you will find that I have not abandoned the 
old ground, notwithstanding the high authority of a newspaper. 
I already repent of having this thing printed, but must make 
the best of it now. 

There is one point on which I have suspected that my opinion differs from Judge Smith's; I think that the trustees are 
most clearly visitors, and that this lies at the bottom of our case, 
and as visitors, I think they are not answerable in any court, 
while acting within the scope of their visitatorial power. I 
should be glad you would think of this a little. If I am in an 
error, it is a pretty important error. 

I think I shall be at Portsmouth, but am not absolutely certain. If I can go without a good deal of sacrifice, I will present 
myself. I will write you again on this point. Mrs. Webster 
must put off her journey to another occasion, on account of my 
expected detention. She acquiesces in this the more cheerfully, 
as she expects the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Mason this way soon. 

Ever yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

(EXTRACT.) 

Boston, August 17, 1820. 
DEAR EZEKIEL, 

* * * * * * * 

As to a president, I have weighed the subject very much in 
my own mind, and conversed on it on every occasion with the 
friends of the college. My mind is not made up in favor of any 
candidate. The gentleman whom you and I thought most of 
when I saw you, is not, I fear, in all respects the most eligible. 
I learn that he has not much energy of character, and as to 
scholarship, not more than respectable. And if as much fitness 
for the office could be found in a man ten years younger, it 
would be much better. The more I think of it, the more I incline to a younger man. At fifty, not enough of life remains to 
acquire much ; whereas at thirty or thirty-five a man is young 
enough to form himself to be president. I cannot yet fix on 
any body. Mr. Spring of New York, son of the late Dr. Spring, 
has been mentioned by some. I think Mr. Lord's fitness should 
be considered. On the whole, my opinion at present is, that 
you should fill up the board, and postpone the appointment of 
president for the present. 

I have been industrious to collect the opinion of our best and 
most intelligent friends in Essex, and it seems to be against the 
appointment which you contemplated as most probable. I am 

willing you should show this letter to Mr. Thompson, Mr. 
March, and Mr. Pay son, or other friends. The trustees can inquire and correspond through the autumn, on this important 
subject, and when they come to a conclusion, a quorum can 
meet, and make the appointment. 

I hope, therefore, you will on all accounts take further time. 
It is not only an important question, so far as the college itself 
is concerned, but it is of importance also, generally, to show 
that a college not under legislative control can nourish. I 
believe I may say that all our friends this way recommend 
further consideration. 

As to the LL. D., I thought best to speak directly to the 
gentleman concerned. I saw him day before yesterday, and he 
thinks so recent are certain things, that a compliment of that 
sort to him had better be deferred to next year. I told him I 
would give you this hint. I am, on the whole, of the same 
opinion. 

I hope your board will remember Mr. Wood. He at least 
deserves well of the college, having sent a hundred of us, such 
as we are, to be educated in it. 

[The remainder of the letter is wanting.] 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Philadelphia, January 3, 1821. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am not content to wait till I get to Washington, without giving you some account of myself and my 
travels. I left Boston in the mail stage-coach Saturday noon 
the 29th, with Mr. Perkins, T. Parsons, and William Gardiner. 
We kept with the mail to New Haven, where we found ourselves Sunday, 3 o'clock. Here we remained through that day, 
and finding an accommodation stage-coach going the next day 
to New York, we took it to ourselves, and reached that city 
early the evening of the same day. From New York we came 
hither in a new line of stage-coaches, called the Union line, 
which we are bound to speak well of. It gave us a whole 
coach for forty dollars, and allowed us to take our own hours. 

VOL. i. 27 
We left New York at three or four o'clock Tuesday afternoon, 
lodged at New Brunswick, and arrived here to dine "Wednesday, 
yesterday. Our journey was safe and expeditious. I mention these circumstances for your benefit, knowing that in three 
weeks you are to be on our track, although I am well aware 
that Mrs. Story would scold me, if she could scold, for ad's erting to such a disagreeable topic. 

Everybody is in expectation here of receiving your opinion in 
the case of " The Young Eugenie." It must come out, and that 
soon. I beg you to tell Mason either to publish it at once in a 
pamphlet, or to let Hale publish it in the paper. I last evening 
referred some gentlemen to the case of " The Amedie, which they 
had overlooked. In relation to this case of The Amedie," I was 
very negligent, which I confess with shame. I quoted it only 
from the note in Dodson ; whereas the whole case is in Acton, 
and there is there one pretty strong expression of Sir W. Grant, 
not found in the note in Dodson. I mention this lest my unpardonable negligence may have misled you ; for not hearing 
your judgment, I do not know whether you cited the case as 
from Acton. I think Judge Davis's suggestion, of publishing 
with the opinion a summary of the English cases, a very good 
one. Here I find Hopkinson up to his neck in business. He 
seems to have stepped right off into deep water. He has an 
interesting charter case, in which he says he made some use of 
a little bit of an opinion about Dartmouth College. 

Adieu, my dear Sir; I shall write you again from Washington, 
where I hope also to hear from you. 

I am, both at home and abroad, yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, June 17, 1821. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have received yours of Friday. Mr. Olcott 
wrote me on this same subject of the overseers. I am very 
doubtful whether any good would come of the project. Who 
would the Board be ? Every thing depends on that. It would 
be injurious, I think, to propose to take this important alteration in the charter before the ground was well explored, and 

some security obtained that the concession should not be 
abused. 

On the whole, it strikes me that the project, so far as it relates to getting money, is impracticable, and the whole of it not 
without danger. 

I hope to be able to leave here about the 25th. It depends 
on the adjournment of the court, which is still sitting, and I 
know not exactly when to expect its adjournment. 

Your governor seems to have made a pretty good speech; 
certainly better than the average of such things. He talks 
against false economy very justly, and as if he had never shared 
in the benefit derived from the currency of opposite sentiments. 
I think you will have a pleasant session. Your house has good 
men enough in it to prevent great mischief, even if you shall 
not effect much positive good ; and it is a great thing, nowadays, to keep things from growing worse. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Boston, July 9, 1821. 

DEAR SIR, I think this No.i exceedeth all its predecessors in 
glory. I have read three articles. 1. Yours, in answer to the 
new magazine, of which I do most honestly admire both the 
right spirit and the able execution. 2. Florida, by which I 
am greatly edified and instructed. 3. St. Pierre, which is a 
very entertaining romance. 

I verily think we have had nothing so good as this number. 
Sic itur ad astra. 

Thine, D. WEBSTER. 

i The number of the North American Review for July, 1821. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Boston, September 24, 1821. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am happy to hear that you are coming up 
to-morrow, to dine with the commodore. Mr. Baker, the British 
consul-general, is in town. He called on me to-day, and expressed a wish to see you. I have invited him to pass an hour 
with me to-morrow evening, and have promised him your company ; and he has accepted, on the strength of that promise. 

Will you be kind enough to bring up with you the last 
Dodson. I wish to look at the recent case about the slavetrade. I very much fear my Lord Stowell has missed a figure. 
However, I suppose, as usual, he has given plausible reasons. 

We shall have some interesting questions here on this subject, 
and that shortly. 

Very truly yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I am greatly delighted at this notion of going to 
Worcester. I know nothing of that county, where so many 
venues were laid, and I think we shall meet some good men. 
Bainbridge means to go with us. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, October 4, 1821. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I like your project of a course of proceeding 
for the trustees very much. I have no doubt something like 
that would be very judicious. I think it of great importance 
that you should come down here before you go to Hanover, if 
you can possibly. Judge Story and Mr. Mason will probably 
both be here on the 15th, and they both feel a strong wish that 
the Board should take a right course. If you can possibly come, 
I hope you will, in the stage-coach on Saturday, the 13th. I 
have no doubt, by putting all our heads together, we can do 
something. I would go up and see you if it were not almost 
impossible, and if it were not much more advantageous that 

you should be here, where you can confer with many others. 
Please let me hear, by the earliest mail, whether you can probably 
come. 

Yours affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Boston, November 7, 1821. 

DEAR SIR, I am puzzled to know how the law stands respecting appeals in equity cases, from circuit court to supreme 
court by defendants. Must the defendant in all cases give bond 
to fulfil the final decree ? I know not what construction to put, 
in this respect, on the provisions of the act of March 3, 1803. 
On looking to the only case of the kind in which I have been 
concerned, namely, Oilman v. Brown, I find no such bond given. 
When you have read this, will you say in two words, how it is ? 
I suppose it is somewhere settled. A line this afternoon or 
to-morrow morning will greatly oblige 

Your often obliged, 

D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, Sunday evening, [1821.] 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Judge Story has written a letter to Judge 
Paine. I enclose it by this mail, to the care of Mr. Olcott. 
Mr. Mason has not been here, but is expected on Tuesday. I 
had a good deal of conversation with him in the summer, on the 
subject of the college, and I have no doubt he agrees with the rest 
of us, who think the safe way is to proceed very slowly, in relation to the next appointment. My own opinion is most decidedly in favor of postponing any choice till next spring. I will 
thank you to mention that such is my opinion to Mr. March 
and Mr. Payson. We can lose no great advantage by delay, 
and a better choice can in all probability be made. I assure you 
it is the universal sense of all the friends of the college here 
27* 
whom I have spoken with, and I have spoken with many, that 
the prudent course is to put off the appointment. 

I shall be particularly anxious to know the result of your 
meeting. 

Affectionately yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



PRESIDENT JOHN ADAMS TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Montezlllo, December 23, 1821. 

DEAR SIR, I thank you for your discourse, delivered at Plymouth on the termination of the second century of the landing 
of our forefathers. Unable to read it, from defect of sight, it 
was last night read to me, by our friend Shaw. The fullest 
justice that I could do it, would be to transcribe it at full length. 
It is the effort of a great mind, richly stored with every species 
of information. If there be an American who can read it without tears, I am not that American. It enters more perfectly 
into the genuine spirit of New England, than any production I 
ever read. The observations on the Greeks and Romans ; on 
colonization in general ; on the West India Islands ; on the past, 
present, and future in America, and on the slave-trade, are 
sagacious, profound, and affecting in a high degree. 

Mr. Burke is no longer entitled to the praise the most consummate orator of modern times. 

What can I say of what regards myself? To my humble 
name, " Exegisti monumentum cere perennius" 

This oration will be read five hundred years hence, with as 
much rapture as it was heard. It ought to be read at the end 
of every century, and indeed at the end of every year, for ever 
and ever. 

I am, Sir, with the profoundest esteem, your obliged friend, 
and very humble servant, 

JOHN ADAMS. 

The Honorable Daniel Webster. 



CHANCELLOR KENT TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Albany, December 29, 1821. 

MY DEAR SIR, Be pleased to accept my thanks for the receipt 
and perusal of your Plymouth discourse, which came by yesterday's mail. The reflections, the sentiments, the morals, the 
patriotism, the eloquence, the imagination of this admirable production are exactly what I anticipated ; elevated, just, and true. 
I think it is also embellished by a style distinguished for purity, 
taste, and simplicity. Excuse me for this once, and I will not 
trespass in this manner again. I am proud to be able to trace my 
own lineage back to the Pilgrims of New England, and prouder 
still that I have been thought deserving of the esteem and friendship of some of the brightest of their descendants. 

Permit Mrs. Kent and me to unite in presenting our best 
respects, and the compliments of the season, to Mrs. Webster, 
and be assured of the constant esteem and regard of your friend 
and most obedient servant, 

JAMES KENT. 

Honorable D. Webster. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Washington, January 14, 1822. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for yours of the 
8th, which I have just received. I came on very safe and sound, 
and am lodged comfortably, but not on the Capitol Hill ; which, 
for some reasons, I regret. I learn that somebody has made 
provision for the court at, or near, the old spot. I will, however, 
speak to Mr. Caldwell. 

There is much stir and buzz about Presidential candidates 
here. Mr. Clay's friends are certainly numerous; whether it 
be because his is the most recent nomination, or for what 
other reason, the fact is he is just now much talked about. I 
think it will be a busy winter, in talking and electioneering. 
My own opinion is, but I would not intimate it to others, that 
Mr. Clay considers himself a candidate, and means to run the 
race. More hereafter on these subjects. 

Mr. Hopkinson desired me to beseech you to give him a day, 
as you come on. I promised him to write you, and mention his 
request. He wishes much to see you, and to give some of his 
friends that pleasure. If, on your arrival, you contrive to send 
him notice, to No. 196, Chestnut street, he will esteem it a great 
favor. 

I am glad your opinion is coming out. It is much asked for. 

Mr. Johnson of Kentucky, has to-day, I learn, made a long 
speech in favor of his proposed amendment. He has dealt, they 
say, pretty freely with the supreme court. Dartmouth College, 
Sturgis and Crowninshield, et cetera, have all been demolished. 
To-morrow he is to pull to pieces the case of the Kentucky betterment law. Then Governor Barber is to annihilate Cohens v. 
Virginia. So things go ; but I see less reality in all this smoke 
than I thought I should, before I came here. 

I hope you will call and see my wife, and my boys, what few 
there are of them ; not forgetting Miss Julia. 

Give my love to Mrs. Story, and believe me, most truly 

Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Washington, August 6, 1822. 

MY DEAR SIR, This gentleman, the Rev. Mr. Gurley, comes 
recommended by our friends at the South, on the subject of the 
Colonization Society. He has with him some very interesting 
publications of the African Institution in London, as well as 
the reports of the society here, and appears to be a very agreeable and intelligent man. 

I feel inclined to do whatever duty requires on this subject. 
You know that my opinion has not been the most favorable, and 
yet I would wish to pay proper deference to such excellent 
men as Judge Washington and Mr. Kay. 

Mr. Gurley will probably be in this neighborhood till Commencement, and if you think it proper that some bread should 

be cast on the waters in this case, I am willing to follow the 
example. 

While I cannot, conscientiously, very confidently recommend 
the cause of this society as being a great attainable good, I am 
still willing to confide in those good men, who have more confidence, so far as to contribute my own little mite to the object in 
view. 

At any rate, my dear Sir, you have discharged your duty before God and man, on the subject of African slavery ; and you 
must not be surprised if more should be expected from him who 
has done so much and so admirably. 

With perpetual regard, dear Sir, 

Yours, DANIEL WEBSTER.

DEAR SIR, We, the undersigned, having been chosen at a 
meeting of delegates from all the wards, held at Concert Hall 
on Thursday evening last, a committee to acquaint you, that at 
that meeting you were unanimously selected to be recommended to the support of their fellow-citizens, to represent the 
District of Suffolk, in the next Congress of the "United States ; 
and having been, by your absence from town, unable to wait 
upon you personally, have the pleasure to address you, to communicate the above fact ; and we beg you to be assured, that in 
the performance of this duty we experience a peculiar satisfaction, which will be greatly enhanced by the knowledge of your 
consent to conform, upon this occasion, to the wishes of your 
friends, in the number of which we hope to be considered, and 
with the highest respect and esteem remain,

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Boston, November 13, 1822. 

DEAR SIR, I went to Salem yesterday rather unexpectedly ; 
a cause in which I was concerned having been called on. I 
found myself too unwell to try it, and so got delay, and returned 
last night. I feel pretty well while I am quiet and keep house, 
but I am not able to make any effort without pain, and renewing a half feverish feeling. My wish now is to remain at home 
till Saturday, go on that day to Providence, and I believe I 
shall take my wife with me, and get well enough, if I can, to 
iry the Gold cause on Monday. I am afraid, however, that 
parties will be prepared on Friday, and that, on account of the 
number of witnesses, any delay will be inconvenient. In this 
case the cause must go on without me. 

I am desirous to see you as you pass along to-morrow, and 
the particular object of this is to inquire, at what time and what 
place I may hope to find you in this town to-morrow. The 
bearer will take your answer, and bring it to me. 

I saw Dr. Warren on my return last evening, and he has put 
me on a regimen for three days with medicine, &c. I hate all 
physic. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 25, 1823. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I am detained here still by the affairs of the 
Commission, and do not expect to leave before ten or fifteen 
days. It is our expectation to go to Dorchester for the summer, 
and I intend to move the second day of May. Soon after that 
I hope you will come down, as I shall want to see you very 
much on more accounts than one. 

You have accomplished a great affair in New Hampshire. I 
know not whether it is a triumph, but it is at least a change, 
and for the present it seems for the better. I have seen the 

returns, and it is clear enough which way the Federal votes 
went. 

As to the great Presidential question, my opinion is, that it 
was never more uncertain than now who will succeed. It is 
time to prepare public opinion in our quarter, for certain contingencies which may arise. 

Who would New Hampshire be for, in your opinion, if it 
were certain that Mr. Adams would not succeed, or who would 
she prefer next to him ? I wish you would write me an answer 
to this question, with or without the reasons on which your 
opinion rests, so as to reach me here by the tenth or twelfth of 
April. This can be done, if you will sit right down to it, on 
receipt of this. I would thank you also to express your own 
preference. 

Yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. You will probably hear from Portsmouth soon, on 
another subject. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

April 3, 1823. 

DEAR DANIEL, I received yours this morning. Of all the 
candidates named for the Presidency, the people of New Hampshire would undoubtedly prefer Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams being 
out of the question, I think Mr. Calhoun would be their choice. 
I think neither Jackson, Crawford, nor Clay could ever obtain 
the votes of this State. They would prefer to have a Northern 
man for the President, and I think would vote for Mr. Clinton, 
if there should be any prospect of his being chosen. It seems 
to me there is among us a pretty strong local feeling, something 
like a very general wish that the next President should be from 
the North. There is a kind of presentiment that, after this 
election, we may give up all further expectation. 

Of all the persons named I reply Calhoun. Yet, if a prominent man from New England, New York, or Pennsylvania 
should be put in nomination against him, I think he would 
obtain the electoral vote. 
Consulting my own feelings and wishes at this time, I should 
put the candidates in this order, Adams, Calhoun, Clinton. I 
am, however, very incompetent to judge correctly of their qualifications. 

For the time we had to labor we did something. Every 
department of the government will be what is called here antiHill. Some good will result from the change, not immediately 
perhaps, but in time. 

The result of the election was one of the most unexpected, 
and yet one of the most natural events that could be imagined. 
Here is a paradox, I give no more. 

I intend to be in Boston the 3d day of May, as I have 
some engagements after the 10th that will require me to be at 
home. 

Yours affectionately, 

EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Washington, April 10, 1823. 

DEAR SIR, Mr. John D. Williams of Boston informs me 
that he has written requesting you to go to Portland, at the 
Circuit Court, and argue his cause against Mr. Reed. I hope 
you will be able to go. He is a very worthy man, and an 
exceeding good client. He will satisfy you well ; and his case 
you will easily understand. Mr. Greenleaf, who is in the cause 
for the plaintiff, Williams, is a very correct and able lawyer of 
his age, and will have the case duly prepared. It is a case of 
some importance and some expectation ; and I would not for a 
good deal, as we say, that any thing should prevent your attention to it. I cannot be home in season to rest and then go to 
Portland. I have no other engagements there, and do not 
intend practising in that court. You are sixty miles nearer the 
court than I am, and I am sure you would find it much to your 
advantage to attend regularly. 

When you see Judge Story, ask him to show you a letter 
which I wrote him about the appointment of a judge. 

I grow very anxious to get home. The commissioners are 
here yet, and will remain probably ten days longer. 

I have got through the bulk of all the cases committed to my 
care, and hope now to have a little repose. I shall be ready for 
any scheme of play which you can get up. 

Yours very sincerely, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Boston, May 12, 1823. 

MY DEAR SIR, It will give us great pleasure to go to Portsmouth, especially in company with you and Mrs. Story. I 
believe there is very little to do in the Circuit Court. For myself 1 have next to nothing. There will probably be one capital 
trial, as I learn from Mr. Blake, which he thinks must be postponed for a short time from the commencement of the court ; 
so that on the whole there will probably be no inconvenience in 
adjourning the court over next week. 

I never felt more down sick on all subjects connected with 
the public, than at the present moment. I have heretofore 
cherished a faint hope that New England would some time or 
other get out of this miserable, dirty squabble of local politics, 
and assert her proper character and consequence. But I at 
length give up. I feel the hand of fate upon us, and to struggle 
is in vain. We are doomed to be hewers of wood and drawers 
of water ; and I am prepared, henceforth, to do my part of the 
drudgery, without hoping for an end. You know I am not 
disappointed at the result of the election for governor. ]My 
" agony " was over before the election took place, for I never 
doubted the result. Indeed, on the grounds on which the controversy was placed, I could have enjoyed the triumph of 
neither party. What has sickened me beyond remedy is the 
tone and temper of these disputes. We are disgraced beyond 
help or hope by these things. There is a Federal interest, a 
Democratic interest, a Bankrupt interest, an Orthodox interest, 
and a Middling interest, but I see no national interest, nor any 
national feeling in the whole matter. 

I am, dear Sir, your true but despairing Mend, 

D. WEBSTER.

MISS TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Columbia, May 29, 1823. 

SIR, You have probably before this time entirely forgotten 
that you ever had an acquaintance by the name of Fanny. It 
is a long time since I have heard any thing of you. I lately, by 
accident, heard that you were settled in Boston, and in affluence. 
Very different is my situation. I live in this town with my 
aged parents, who are unable to do any thing towards supporting themselves. I have one sister ; we have nothing but our 
hands to support our parents and a helpless brother. As a help 
towards doing this, I took an orphan child under my care. I 
was to receive six dollars per month for board and tuition ; I 
have kept the child two years, and received but forty dollars, 
and have no expectation of ever receiving more. His guardian 
has failed and fled to parts unknown. I agreed with a merchant 
in this vicinity for some of the necessaries of life, expecting to 
receive payment quarterly, and pay it to him ; he now calls 
loudly for his pay, and I have nothing to pay with ; I expect 
'he will take the steps of the law ; in that case you know how 
dreadful would be the situation of a poor defenceless female. I 
can do nothing towards paying the debt unless some of my rich 
friends will help me. The debt due to me is about eighty 
dollars, and the debt which I owe about fifty dollars. Should 
you feel able and willing to bestow some pecuniary assistance, 
you will please to send by mail. I live in Columbia, Brooklyn 
County, Connecticut. Should you not find it convenient to 
assist me, I should be glad to hear of your health and happiness 
and that of your dear ones. If you could make it convenient 
to answer this the first mail after receiving it, you would much 
oblige 

Your unfortunate friend. 

P. S. Where is Hervey Bingham, and what is his situation ? Do you correspond with him ? Perhaps you would be 
willing to state my condition to him. My great anxiety to do 
all in my power to render the few remaining days of my parents 
iii some measure comfortable, is all the apology I can offer for 
thus troubling you. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BINGHAM. 

Boston, June 9, 1823. 

DEAR BINGHAM, I this morning received this from our old 
acquaintance. I have never heard of her before, since we left 
college. She seems to be in want and trouble. I have sent her 
a little money, and, according to her request, enclose the letter 
to you. 

You seem to have given up the good custom of an annual 
visit this way. We should be very glad to see you and your 
wife. Yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Boston, November, 1823. 

I AM sure, my dear Sir, Lord Coke never looked so gay before ; l but this is only another proof how much the most obsolete 
subjects are improved in passing through your hands. I shall 
certainly cultivate his acquaintance in some interval or intermission of the Waverley Novels, and will hereafter tell you what I 
think of him. For the present accept my thanks. 

It will rejoice my heart that you should come to Washington. 
If nobody does .it' who can do it better, I shall certainly say 
something of the Greeks. The miserable issue of the Spanish 
Revolution makes the Greek cause more interesting, and I begin to think they have character enough to carry them through 
the contest with success. Let me know when you are coming 
to Washington, and in the mean time let me hear from you. 
You cannot do me so great a favor as to suggest to me any 
thoughts that occur respecting matters and things in general. 
Adieu, yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 

l A set of Lord Coke's Reports. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

New York, November 16, 1823. 

I have found leisure here, and not until now, to read your admirable article 1 on the Greeks. Since I left Boston, also, we 
have had important information from them. I feel a great 
inclination to say or do something in their behalf early in the 
session, if I know what to say or to do. If you can readily 
direct me to any source from which I can obtain more information than is already public respecting their affairs, I would be 
obliged to you so to do. 

I have not yet seen Wheaton, nor other wise men of Manhattan. Yours always, 

D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Princeton, November 20, 1823. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I left New York yesterday, having remained 
there two or three days, which was long enough to learn the 
strange confusion and division of opinion which exists there in 
relation to prominent public subjects. It seems to be generally 
believed that Mr. Crawford's friends have no longer any reasonable hope of success in that State. This point being agreed, 
every thing else is controverted. I was altogether astonished at 
the confidence which the friends of Mr. Clinton expressed, of their 
ability to secure to him the votes of that State. It is certain 
that his popularity has experienced a sudden and most extraordinary revival, so much so as to inspire unlimited expectations. The canal has done this. It is said also, with great confidence, that Ohio is better inclined towards Mr. Clinton than 
any body else. On the other hand, the friends of Mr. Adams, 
Mr. Calhoun, and Mr. Clay, say that although Mr. Clinton may 
be gaining strength, it is impossible he can obtain the votes of 
New York, and impossible at all events that he can be President. The friends of Mr. Calhoun, especially, regret that Mr. 
Clinton should be brought forward, apprehending it may have 

1 North American Review, October, 1823. 

the effect of reuniting the fragments of the old republican party, 
in favor of Mr. Crawford, through the operation of strong feelings of dislike towards Mr. Clinton. As far as I could understand, the Mends of these two gentlemen in that State are 
inclined to no mutual hostilities, but willing to leave public 
sentiment as between those two to declare itself. 

In the mean time it is thought Mr. Adams has a very large, 
though not an increasing number of friends. I should not be at 
all surprised if the reaction, which has begun evidently to take 
place in Mr. Clinton's favor, together with the canal and other 
local considerations, should give him the State. It seems undoubted that the legislature, which assembles in January, will 
send the election to the people, on a general ticket, and then, 
I presume the friends of the parties will array themselves. 
Many of the Federalists in the western district, it is supposed, 
favor Mr. Adams ; otherwise, in the city and its neighborhood. 

This State of New Jersey is thought likely enough to be in 
favor of Mr. Calhoun, unless it should be inundated by an overflow of Mr. Clinton's popularity from New York. 

We have got along thus far without accident, and shall resume our journey immediately. 

Yours, affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Washington, November 30, [1823.] 

DEAR SIR, We arrived here on Wednesday evening safe and 
well, after a journey which, on the whole, was pleasant and 
agreeable. Our lodgings were ready and are very comfortable. 
The attendance of members is uncommonly large, and we 
shall have a quorum, no doubt, to-morrow. Mr. Clay arrived 
last evening. He will doubtless be Speaker, although I understood Mr. Barbour's friends intend to run him. It will not go. 
Mr. Clay's popularity as Speaker is great, and he is in many 
respects a liberal and honorable man. His health is not good, 
but I fancy not so bad as to induce him to decline the chair. 

Although I think him tolerably liberal, and not unfriendly in 
his general feeling, yet I do not suppose that, in the organization 
28* 
and arrangement of the affairs of the House, he will venture to 
disregard old lines of distinction. 

Mr. King has arrived, but I have not seen him. Both your 
senators are here. 

I have not seen much here yet to add to my stock of knowledge on the subject of the Presidential election. It looks to me, 
however, at present, as if it might happen that Mr. Crawford 
would ere long be given up, and his friends go off in a direction 
to Mr. Clay. 

It appears to me to be our true policy to oppose all caucuses ; 
so far our course seems to me to be clear. Beyond that I do 
not think we are bound to proceed at present. To defeat caucus nominations, or prevent them, and to give the election, 
wherever it can be done, to the people, are the best means of 
restoring the body politic to its natural and wholesome state. 

Mrs. W. sends a great deal of love to you all. 
Yours, most truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I hope you have not abandoned an idea which you 
intimated to me at Dorchester. I think you will do exceedingly 
right to take that step, and am sure you will not regret it. 

It will excite no jealousy or suspicion here, at all ; and you 
have reasons which will allay any that might arise at home. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 4, [1823.] 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have received yours, covering three letters, 
to-day. My information as to what Mr. H. said in New York, was 
from the editor of the Statesman ; but I suppose he would not 
wish to have it known. He is now here ; I shall see him and will 
endeavor to put him in the right way. Mr. Parrot lodges in 
the same house with us. He said to-day, speaking of New 
Hampshire affairs, that if there were any objection to Governor 
W., he could not be chosen ; that Mr. Morrill was talked of, 
but he thought that would hardly do, and that if Judge L. were 
a candidate, he probably might and would succeed. 



DAMEL WEBSTER. 331 

One thing I hold to be material get on without a caucus. It 
will only require a little more pains. It is time to put an end to 
caucuses. They make great men little, and little men great. 
The true source of power is the people. The Democrats are 
not democratic enough. They are real Aristocrats. Their 
leaders wish to govern by a combination among themselves, and 
they think they have a fee-simple in the people's sum-ages. 

Go to the people, and convince them that their pretended 
friends are a knot of self-interested jobbers, who make a trade 
of patriotism and live on popular credulity. 

We have as yet done little or nothing here. The choide of 
Speaker should be considered as indicating nothing but a sense, 
in the House, of Mr. Clay's fitness for that place. He had nearly 
all the northern votes. How he will discharge the important 
duties of the chair, in arranging the business of the House, we 
shall know to-morrow. I have no doubt of the liberality of his 
feelings, and can hardly persuade myself that he will be afraid 
to shake off trammels. Yet in the present condition of things, 
he may perhaps keep on the safe side, as he may think it. We 
shah 1 see. 

Nothing very new and important has transpired in relation to 
the Presidential election. I remain of opinion the choice must 
come to the House. 

I shall write you often, and should be glad to hear from you 
twice a week. These are interesting times, and we ought to 
keep awake. What think you of doing or saying something in 
favor of the Greeks ? 

Mr. Longfellow has not yet arrived. I note your request, and 
will see him. Yours, faithfully, 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 



Washington, December 5, 1823. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have gone over your two manuscripts with 
the map before me, and think I have mastered the campaigns 
of 1821-1822, historically and topographically. My wonder 
is, where and how your most extraordinary industry has been 
able to find all the materials for so interesting and detailed a 
narrative. I hope you will send me a digested narrative of the 
events of this year, so far as they are to be learned from the last 
accounts. 

I have spoken to several gentlemen on the subject of a motion 
respecting Greece, and all of them approve it. The object 
which I wish to bring about, and which I believe may be brought 
about, is the appointment of a commissioner to go to Greece. 
Two modes present themselves. A motion to that effect, and a 
speech in support of it, giving some account of the rise and progress of the Greek revolution, and showing the propriety and 
utility of the proposed mission. The other is to raise a committee on the subject, and let there be a report containing the 
same matter. The first would be the easier to be done ; the 
last would be the more grave and imposing. Whichever may 
be adopted, your communications are invaluable ; and I wish 
you would tell me frankly how far I can use them without injury to your January article in The North American. 

We can wait until that article is out if you think best, but my 
impression is we should do well to bring forward the subject 
within ten or twelve days from this time, while the House is 
not yet much occupied, and while the country feels the warmth 
communicated by the President's message. I intend to see, in 
the course of this day and to-morrow, Mr. R. King, Mr. Clay, 
and perhaps the President, and learn their views of this matter. 

I shall send you every thing in the shape of a document that 
is printed this session. These are interesting times ; let us improve them. Yours, most devotedly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Washington, December 6, 1823. 

MY DEAR SIR, There was, as I believe, a meeting of the 
members of the administration yesterday, at which, inter alia^ 
they talked of Greece. The pinch is, that in the message, the 
President has taken, as is supposed, pretty high ground as to 
this continent ; and is afraid of the appearance of interfering in 
the concerns of the other continent also. This does not weigh 

greatly with me ; I think we have as much community with 
the Greeks as with the inhabitants of the Andes, and the dwellers on the borders of the Vermilion sea. 

If nothing should occur to alter my present purpose, I shall 
bring forward a motion on the subject on Monday, and shall 
propose to let it lie on the table for a fortnight. 

If you can find any tolerable map of modern Greece, I wish 
you would send it to me for Mr. Calhoun. I write this at his 
request, who desires me to say to you that he is as friendly to 
the Greeks as yourself. 

I am glad to see that you publish, in the Daily, your narrative. It will be well received, and do much good. 

There seems to be here a good-natured and liberal spirit on 
all subjects. Yours, most sincerely, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BLAKE. 

Washington, December 20, 1823. 

MY DEAR SIR, I believe Mrs. W. is meditating a letter to Mrs. 
B. to-day ; but as she told me this morning it was uncertain 
whether engagements of business would allow her time to write, 
she directed me to indite a line to Mrs. B. to be inclosed in this, 
which I told her I was about writing to you. 

The object of this is to call your attention to Mr. Fuller's resolution respecting the law of 1814, that partial and odious act. 
The resolution is now before our committee. We shall act 
upon it soon, and probably report a bill to repeal the act of 
1814; probably in twelve days we shall be acting on the matter 
in our House. I wish you, therefore, to do two things : First, 
to write to me, giving me your ideas, and any information which 
you may think useful ; and, secondly, to write to Mr. Mills to 
look after the matter if it should get to the Senate. 

I have a belief, perhaps it is unfounded, that it will pass our 
House. I shall be very glad, if the first thing I do here, in addition to its being just and proper, shall also be something not 
unfavorable to you. 

As to the business of the court, I have not yet paid much attention to it. My Spanish claims have called for all the time 
at my command. They are now pretty much finished, at least 
so far as not to be extremely burdensome on my time. 

As to great political affairs, we, who are not in secrets, know 
here very little more than is known in Massachusetts. Some 
say there is to be a caucus, and some say there is not. I think 
it yet uncertain whether there will be one or not. I suppose 
the members of the House have all their preferences, but, so far, 
there is great abstinence in the House from all topics connected 
with the election. I hope this will last. 

I write this in the House, not now in session, and your friend, 
Mr. Buchanan, is here, and he desires me to make his remembrances to you and Mrs. Blake. He means to write to you soon, 
and he just now says, " Mr. Blake is one of the most agreeable 
men I have ever known." What a poor judge of such matters 
he is ! If he always judges so wrong he will not do to be followed ! 

Pray let me hear from you soon, and believe me, most truly, 

Yours, always, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. BLAKE. 

Washington, December 20, 1823. 

MY DEAR MADAM, It is Mrs. Webster's intention to write 
you immediately, in her proper person, in answer to yours of 
the eleventh. Not to suffer, however, so great a favor to remain 
altogether unnoticed, even for a short time, she commands me 
to write to you to acknowledge its receipt, and to assure you 
of the pleasure it gives us to hear from you. It is true that we 
find objects here which may well enough fill up the attention 
for a time ; and, truth to tell, I really think Mrs. Webster likes 
Washington tolerably well. Nevertheless, we need your and 
Mr. Blake's society very much. There is nobody here to come 
in of an evening, and pull off his overshoes, coats, and handkerchiefs, and sit down to a regular social talk, like your husband. 
For my part I would give something just to see that blue handkerchief. Our evenings are sometimes not a little lonesome. 
However, I occasionally, though seldom, take a nap ; and as you 
speak of dreaming away the long nights, you hit me on a tender 



DANIEL WEBSTER 335 

point, since I am always accused, very unjustly of course, of no 
little love of the good thing, sleep. However, I will not altogether deny it, and in respect to good dreams, I am, I am sure, 
surpassed by nobody ; I believe I have a talent that way. Our 
evening parties are not yet numerous; we have been but to 
two, one at General Brown's, the night before last, and one at 
Mrs. Adams, ten days ago. Report runs that the drawingroom at the White House will be opened on New Year's day, 
and afterward as usual. There are several handsome female 
faces here that I have not seen before ; especially two or three 
ladies from the South. We may be in some danger, my dear 
lady, of losing the reputation of the North, if you do not come 
on to sustain us against this southern competition. You must 
remember that our northern forces are much weakened since 
your beautiful friend Miss Dickinson stays out of the combat. 
For this, as well as other reasons, I hope you will allow me to 
entreat you to accompany your husband. 

You have a great friend here in the person of Master Edward. 
He desires all sorts of affectionate remembrance. I think both 
he and his sister may speak well of the bread and butter of the 
Potomac. I will thank you to remember me to Miss Helen. 
I regret that you are so soon to lose her pleasant society. Give 
our love to George. Mrs. Webster will probably write you in a 
day or two. 

Yours with most sincere regard, 

DANIEL WEBSTER, 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Washington, December 21, 1823. 

MY DEAR SIR, Two days ago I received your Greek statistics, and to-day your letter of the 13th. I pray you not to 
think my engagements are such as to make your correspondence inconvenient. In the first place, I write you only when I 
can with convenience, and as to my duties in the judiciary 
committee, most of the topics coming up there are pretty 
familiar to me, and are consequently disposed of without great 
labor. 

As to the Greek subject, the resolution will be taken up 
to-morrow fortnight, not yesterday fortnight, as mentioned in 
yesterday's Daily Intelligencer. I believe there will be a good 
deal of discussion, although, if any, pretty much on one side. 
While some of our Boston friends, as I know, think this resolution even Quixotic, leading to crusade, it will be objected to 
strongly by many, on account of its tame milk and water character. The merchants are naturally enough a little afraid about 
their cargoes at Smyrna ; besides, Greece is a great way off, &c. 

I find your communications of the utmost utility. In regard 
to the history of the campaigns, I could have done nothing 
without your aid. 

My intention is to justify the resolution against two classes 
of objections, those that suppose it not to go far enough, and 
those that suppose it to go too far. Then, to give some little 
history of the Greek revolution, express a pretty strong conviction of its ultimate success, and persuade the House, if I can, to 
take the merit of being the first government, among all the 
civilized nations, who have publicly rejoiced in the emancipation of Greece. 

There will be speeches enough, some of them no doubt, tolerably good. Whatever occurs to you, if it be but a scrap, in 
season to be sent here, pray forward it. Mr. Calhoun is greatly 
obliged to you for your map. 

I hope to hear from you a short word at least every day 
or two. Yours always truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I feel now as if I could make a pretty good speech for 
my friends the Greeks, but I shall get cool in fourteen days, 
unless you keep up my temperature. 



[The following lines, with prefatory note by Mr. Webster in his own handwriting, were found among his papers. Ed.] 

THE LAST NIGHT OF THE SESSION. 

THE following lines, so descriptive of the condition of the 
two Houses of Congress at the end of the session, were written 

at the termination of the session of 1823-1824, by the late 
Governor Lincoln of Maine, then a member of the House. Of 
the six persons mentioned, three, as well as the writer, have paid 
the debt of nature. 

D. W. 

" What guardian power my country's glory keeps, 
When Senates doze, and e'en her Webster sleeps ? 
When Clay, out-watched, forsakes the empty chair, 
And Warfield winks, amidst the dusky air ? 
Thro' the dun hall the wandering echoes stray 
And yawning messengers look out for day. 
Cutt's laboring tongue can scarce pronounce the bills, 
And Cocke himself forgets his country's ills. 
Sigh answers sigh, and snore resounds to snore, 
Like billows bursting on some dreary shore. 
With lazy pace, the long, long hours return, 
While worn-out Sibley cries, " Adjourn, adjourn." 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. LANGDON ELWYN. 

Washington, January 2, 1824. 

THE season approaches, my dear Madam, in which we may 
be allowed to expect the pleasure of seeing you and Miss 
Langdon Elwyn, in this place. I have accordingly been 
looking out for your commands. Although you may be very 
much interested and delighted in Philadelphia, you must remember that this great city is the national capital, and that the 
court is here. I assure you, my dear Madam, that you are very 
much needed here. The North needs reinforcements, as well in 
your department as in ours. There is a brilliant circle of 
beauties from the South, while that from the North, if not less 
brilliant than usual, is yet less than usual. 

We all went yesterday to the President's, and had a very 
splendid New Year. Mrs. Webster, I perceive, lays it up 
against Messrs. Gales and Seaton, that in their account of the 
matter, in the paper of this morning, nothing is said of the 
ladies. That, certainly, was a capital omission. Mrs. Monroe 
was not well enough to be seen, but the honors of the occasion 
were well performed by Mrs. Hay. 
VOL. i. 29 
Mrs. Webster begs me to make her love to yourself and Miss 
Emily. I pray, also, to be remembered ; and, in the hope of soon 
being able to pay my respects in person, 

I am, Madam, with true regard, your obedient servant, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Washington, January 2, 1824. 

DEAR SIR, I send you the answer to the call for information 
respecting the Greeks. If I mistake not, it will, with the 
country, very much raise the Greek stock. As to the danger, 
from my motion, of offending the Turk, I think we may disregard that, when we see the Secretary of State corresponding 
with a Greek agent in London, wishing him and his nation all 
success, and publishing the correspondence. 

It is possible my motion may be put off till we get an answer 
to Mr. Mallory's motion, so as to debate our whole foreign relations at once. We shall have the nation ; and if Mr. Monroe 
does not do speedily as much as I have suggested, he will soon 
be obliged to do more. 

I mean to say as much to him, this day or to-morrow. 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Washington, January 4, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am in great trouble and perplexity on this 
subject of the courts ; and often wish I was almost any where 
rather than where I am. There are difficulties, inherent in the 
subject; there are others, more formidable, arising from the 
state of men's opinions. 

In the first place, I cannot get over my own objections to 
separating your bench entirely from the circuits. I trust you 
know, that so far as that course would be convenient to the 
members of the court, it would be most desirable to me to follow it. But my convictions of the public interest are the other 
way, and are very strong. Suffice it for the present to say, that 

if we separate your bench from the circuit, and reduce it to five, 
I should expect to see it, in a very few years, the most unpopular tribunal that ever existed. 

In the second place, I cannot persuade others to come into my 
views, which would be to appoint circuit judges for some circuits. The objection is, that this mode would have the effect of 
producing anti-equality. Some circuits would have a supreme 
judge, others a subordinate judge ; and that this inequality, 
which is offensive, and touches feeling, would be necessarily 
permanent ; as when a vacancy should happen on the supreme 
bench, an appointment to fill it must be made with reference to 
the circuit duties performed by the last incumbent. It is impossible, at least it seems so, to procure the support of the 
West to this system ; and, as the West alone is much interested in the change, nothing of course will be done which they 
are not reconciled with. 

One suggestion is, to elevate the condition of the district 
judges, give them better salaries, &c., and to make circuit courts 
by the association of district judges. This, in my mind, is 
liable to the first objection, it disconnects your court from the 
circuits. 

I wish you would now tell me, just as strongly as you feel 
them to be, what and how great would be the disadvantages of 
increasing your bench to nine ? 

Some of them are obvious ; such as the difficulty of commanding the attention of nine men to a cause, particularly as 
in cases of equity and admiralty, where evidence is to be examined, &c. There are many others which occur to me ; and 
more will occur to you. And yet I confess I cannot make so 
strong a case against that measure as I thought I could when 
it was first suggested. On interesting constitutional questions, 
I rather think it would be an advantage. 

My impression is that, with such increase, we could get along 
probably for twenty years, cr forever ; for I am inclined to think 
there will be a gradual and progressive improvement in the district courts, and that so far as the business becomes incapable 
of being performed by the nine supreme judges on the circuit, 
the duties of the circuit court will be devolved on the district 
judge. We shall not in my opinion be likely to have intermediate circuit judges. Suppose, for example, we should lose 
the district judge of New Hampshire ; we would try to get Mr. 
Mason appointed, lop off New Hampshire from your circuit, 
and make him a circuit court. 

I think we should get pretty good judges if appointments 
were now to be made. I mean, of two on your bench. There 
is no doubt Judge Woodbury would be one, and he is as sound 
a man as I know of. It is said Mr. Burnet, of Ohio, would be 
the other. 

On all these subjects do pray write me, and tell me what to 
do. I have not heard a word from you. 

I am quite well, except that the winding off the Spanish 
commissions has made me write my fingers off. Before you 
get through this long epistle, you will wish that were true. 

Yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. I. P. DAVIS TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Boston, January 6, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, I feel greatly obliged by your kind attention 
in sending the canvas-back ducks. They arrived in excellent 
order, in a very short passage from Baltimore. I made the distribution as you directed. Your club met with Mr. Dutton, and 
they made a very favorable report of the good quality of the birds. 
Gorham, who is now called an excellent judge, decides them to 
be the very best ever seen this side of Havre de Grace. 

I was so fortunate as to have them in season for my club to 
feast on them. Callender and Perkins had their wing a-piece. 
We drank your health and a happy New Year in a bumper of 
" Black top." I sent a very fine pair to our friend Blake. As 
he leaves this to-morrow for Washington, he will make his own 
report. 

I should be greatly delighted to visit Washington in February, 
and think Bliss is quite disposed ; if I can make any excuse I 
shall certainly do it. A party propose going on in a few days ; 
Messrs. J. Russell, Cod man, and Lee, if they are not discouraged 
by a cold storm. 

Mr. Lowell has been writing on the subject of the Greeks ; his 

signature is " A Calm Man." It appears to me he is the only 
one that is not perfectly so among us. The rich are not much 
disposed to aid by giving money, and the merchants have some 
fears of the trade at Smyrna. Perkins writes in the Daily 
Advertiser the piece signed " A Merchant." 

We are pleased to have a good report of Jeannette, and I hope 
she will continue to deserve it. The token you enclosed for her 
sister was received and delivered. My wife's love to you and 
yours, and many happy returns of a New Year, in which I most 
heartily join. 

Yours as ever, 

I. P. DAVIS. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Washington, January, 1824. 

DEAR SIR, You are in a long confabulation a short word to 
write when one is in a hurry with the Secretary of State, and 
my coachman complains of the tempestuous night. Good-bye. 
Give my love to your wife. 

I shall send my speech ] along forthwith, in multitudes, " like 
which the populous North," &c. 

Can you leave me the French author ? I will send it by Mr. 
Coolidge, if needful, three days hence. 

Your documents shall go regularly, and also any letters that 
may come, to me for you. I hope the inclemency of the weather 
may induce you to postpone your departure another day. If so, 
pray let me see you or hear from you in the morning. Adieu. 

Yours, 

D. W. 



MR. HOPKINSON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Philadelphia, January 23, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, The report of your speech, meagre as it is, 
shows the foot of Hercules ; but we want the whole body and 

1 Speech on the Revolution in Greece, January 19, 1824. 

29* 
soul, and trust you will give it to us. Mr. Hempbill wrote me 
it was the best he ever heard. I published his letter in Walsh's 
Gazette. 

I scribbled some New Year's rhymes, you know what such 
things are, for Poulson's paper, and am struck with some coincidences in our notions about the Holy Alliance, and the Greek 
cause. I enclose you a copy, not because the verses are worth 
a farthing as poetry, but because I now think they have some 
value as far as they are coincident with your views. In my 
rhymes of the former year, upon the same subject, I stated that 
it was a combination of all kings against all people ; and suggested the hope you also entertain, that the time is approaching 
when the moral and intellectual power of man will be united 
with his physical force, and overthrow the unnatural and degrading slavery that now oppresses him. I confess this hope is considerably darkened by the late events in Italy and Spain. 

Most truly yours, 

Jos. HOPKINSON. 

EXTRACT FROM THE ADDRESS. 

Not so the Greeks, who still maintain their right, 
And bravely meet their tyrants in the fight ; 
Still keep undaunted the embattled field, 
Where they may perish but will never yield. 
What nobler cause can fire the human breast, 
Than thine, O ! Greece, so long, so low opprest ? 
What is there sacred in the heart of man, 
Dear to his soul since life and light began, 
That meets not in your cause, afflicted race, 
And recommends it to the Throne of Grace ? 
Religion, Liberty, Home, Children, Life, 
All hang suspended on this awful strife ;< 
May Heaven afford the aid which Man denies, 
And crown your efforts with the hard-earn'd prize. 
Christians of Europe ! Burn ye not with shame ? 
Christians ye are not, only in the name ; 
The Turk, exulting, mocks your God and creed ; 
Beneath his sabre, hosts of Christians bleed ; 
And ye look on and coldly count the cost, 

The policy of battles won and lost. 

Your monarchs meet and hold a grave debate, 

Weighing this cause against some trick of state ; 

Find it is best the Crescent should prevail, 

And sink the bleeding Cross O shameful tale ! 

The Turk himself can scarce believe it true ; 

He would not thus abandon Turk to you. 

Holy Allies your flag is now unfurl'd, 

No longer can you cheat and mock the world ; 

Ambition, power, and avarice, are the ties 

That bind these generous, great, and good Allies. 



MR. HOPKINSON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Philadelphia, February 1, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, Now that your Greek resolution, like poor 
Fidele, is laid in its tomb, decked with flowers of every hue, I 
hope you will have time to think of your living friends in Philadelphia, who never cease to think of you. By your letter to our 
friend Walsh, I find you are preparing a proper publication of 
your speech. I pray you to take pains with it. You are generally too careless of yourself and your reputation ; and, content 
with doing a thing well, you have too little solicitude about the 
proof of it to the world. Your views of the character, object, 
and extent of the Holy Alliance have particularly attracted 
public attention for their strength and novelty in many particulars. Develop yourself fully on this subject; it is of vast interest, and may be illustrated with great force by their declarations 
and conduct for the last two years. It is, in one respect, a 
misfortune for a man to obtain a high eminence of character ; 
he is required always to maintain it, and this calls for a constant vigilance and effort which are not always convenient. 
Besides, few have judgment to know of what a subject is capable, and expect to see the same power displayed, whether an 
oak is to be uprooted, or a rose plucked from its bush. 1 agree 
with Mr. Randolph in his surprise that you should find so much 
to be well said on your resolution. It is only a mind of great 
resources, with a genius creative and prolific, that could have 
connected it with so much important and interesting matter.. 
Not one of your opponents has met you fairly on your own 
ground. Some have treated the resolution as an abstract 
Declaration of War, and others have assumed that it would certainly lead to war ; and thus mounted on a monster of their own 
creation, they have gone off at full speed, spreading devastation 
and terror in their path. It is thus with men who must speak, 
and can't argue. Of this genus^ I have seen so many, especially 
in the great hall of Congress, that I know them from the first 
jump they take. 

I saw our friend Judge Story during the short time he gave 
us in Philadelphia, and was delighted to find him in high health 
and spirits. He is ready for a tough campaign; but on his 
return, I shall look for paler cheeks and dimmer eyes. Your 
duties with the court, commission, and congress will now be 
heavy ; but nobody is more able to bear them. God bless you 
and yours ever and forever. 

Truly yours, 

Jos. HOPKINSON. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 27, 1824. 

I HAVE omitted for a long time to write to you, principally 
because I have had nothing important to say, and partly because I have had little leisure. I shall send you my Greek 
speech in a pamphlet form, in a few days. You notice the 
occurrence between Mr. Speaker and Mr. Bartlett. I am inclined to think Mr. Bartlett will find it necessary to do something, in consequence of what happened, by way of obtaining a 
pacific explanation. He will, as you see, get no explanation in 
the House, and yet it would seem he is bound to obtain explanation. I presume some friends will undertake to set matters 
right. 

I have conversed about the mail contracts. There is the best 
disposition at the department to do what is right, but the question is, how ? The contracts are not out till next year, and if a 
law were to pass excluding printers, still, printers' friends would 

bid. Some one else must offer lower, there is no other 
remedy. 

******* 

The Presidential question is still in the clouds. We know 
no more here than you do, and such as you and I have nothing 
to do but keep quiet. 

I think your course is right about your next governor. Take 
care to open the door, and let the people say who shall go in. 
For certain reasons, I should wish Mr. Livermore might be 
chosen. For certain others, I should not regret Mr. Merrill's 
elevation. Let us know how things are going on. 

Of all your representatives I have seen most of Mr. Plumer, 
and am thus far quite well pleased with him. 

Yours always, 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Washington, February 13, 1824. 

MR. BLISS can furnish you the report of the commissioners 
under the Louisiana Treaty ; there is a copy in my drawer in 
the office. 

I have sent you sundry speeches ; if you think it worth while, 
you may send one to any friend on the other side the Atlantic. 
There is no export duty ; it is casus omissus in the new tariff. 
On this same tariff we are now occupied ; it is a tedious, 
disagreeable subject. The House, or a majority of it, are apparently insane, at least I think so. Whether any thing can be 
done to moderate the disease, I know not. I have very little 
hope. I am aware that something is expected from me, much 
more than I shall perform. It would be easy to make a speech, 
but I am anxious to do something better, if I can, but I see not 
what I can do. 

The caucus is to-morrow ; I intend to learn what transpires 
in it, and write a line to Mr. Hale, after it is over, in the 
evening. 

Thine, D. W. 


DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, February 22. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I will send you the book you wish. 

I imagine that New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, 
and Georgia, have always chosen on a general ticket. Vermont 
and New Jersey sometimes, but not always. The rest of the 
States probably never. But I will make some inquiries among 
the members and inform you of the result. 

The caucus has hurt nobody but its friends, as far as I can 
now judge. Mr. Adams's chance seems to increase, and he and 
General Jackson are likely to be the real competitors at last. 
General Jackson's manners are more presidential than those of 
any of the candidates. He is grave, mild, and reserved. My 
wife is for him decidedly. 

We are going on in debating the tariff. The result is uncertain ; with some modification the bill would pass, and probably 
may as it is. 

I think your friend Governor W. will probably be reflected 
for want of some one to be set up against him. 

Yours, D. W. 

P. S. We shall beat our adversaries, I trust, in the Steamboat cause. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, Saturday Morning, [1824.] 

DEAR EZEKIEL, The matters of business I wrote you about 
in my last, have all been attended to on my part. 

As to politics, we are all in a ferment, as you will see. By 
the way, Governor Morrill has been in town, and I have heard 
of his saying that he should favor the election of General 
Miller and yourself. That he should give his support to the 
gallant general is easy enough to be believed ; but how he 
should happen to think so well of you as to say, voluntarily, 
that he should support your election, can be accounted for only 

on the principle of the near approach, or actual arrival, of the 
" era of good feeling." 

But to advert to matters that come nearer home; Mrs. 
Webster wants half a dozen barrels of your best potatoes sent 
down by the boat ; the flour has arrived, &c. 

Yours, in haste, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 14, 1824. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I fully agree with you that it is unfortunate 
that Judge Smith should be set up for Governor, but, as it is all 
over by this time, it is in vain to repine. I feel confident from 
all accounts, there will be no choice, and incline to think M. and 
W. will be the highest candidates ; in which event, I presume the 
former will be chosen. It may be as well to try him. I hope 
to see a number of good men chosen into the Legislature. 

The tariff is yet undecided. It will not pass, I think, in its 
present shape, and I doubt if it will pass at all. As yet I have 
not interfered much in the debate, partly because there were 
others more desirous to discuss the details than I arn, and 
partly because I have been so much in the court. I have done, 
however, with the court, and the whole tariff subject is yet 
open. I shall be looking after it, although I should prefer it 
should die a natural death, by postponement or other easy violence. We shall not do much with the judiciary, and yet we 
shall do something. 

As to President, Jackson seems to be making head yet, 
Arbuthnot and Ambrister notwithstanding. The truth is, he is 
the people's candidate in a great part of the southern and 
western country. I hope all New England will support Mr. 
Calhoun for the Vice-Presidency. If so, he will probably be 
chosen, and that will be a great thing. He is a true man, and 
will do good to the country in that situation. 

The court will sit a week longer. My engagements in it this 
term have not been few nor small, and have kept me pretty 
busy. The Spanish affairs are nearly through. 
Mrs. Webster sends her love to you and the children. She 
will write you shortly, and I believe is expecting a communication from you. 

Yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Washington, April 10, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am happy to hear, through Mr. Paige, that 
you were at home so seasonably and so safe ; and I hope to 
learn soon from yourself, that you had the pleasure of finding 
Mrs. Story and the children well. I have not had an earlier 
opportunity of writing to you, although I wished to call your 
attention to two or three things, in regard to which you 
promised me the benefit of your opinions. We have had a 
busy time of it since you left us. For myself, I am exhausted. 
When I look in the glass, I think of our old New England saying, " As thin as a shad." I have not vigor enough left, either 
mental or physical, to try an action for assault and battery. 
However, the fine weather has come on, I have resumed the 
saddle, and hope to " pick up my crumbs " again soon. You 
see the condition of the tariff. The great struggle has been on 
the iron ; and our majority yesterday was unexpectedly great. 
The speeches on the side of the bill have been very impressive 
and captivating on the general question ; on the ability of protecting domestic industry, raising prices of agricultural products 
by manufactures, working up our own materials, &c. Accompanying sentiments of this sort, we have had much from the 
Philadelphia school, of the adverse balance of trade, exportation 
of specie, loss of foreign markets, &c. But I think some impression has been made against arguments of this class. For 
myself, I have really wished some proper and reasonable bill to 
pass, that the business might be settled. I would not oppose 
the bill, I think, if hemp should be struck out, and some other 
minor amendments made. The molasses, I presume, will come 
out. The minimum ought to be struck out of the woollens. 
And if possible, there should be a change in a variety of provisions about hardware. It is a great object to settle the 

concerns of the community ; so that one may know what to 
depend on. I am apprehensive, however, that our vote yesterday has made the bill so unacceptable to its friends, that it is 
very probable they may abandon it. 

I shall call up some bills reported by our committee, as soon 
as possible. The gentlemen of the West will propose a clause, 
requiring the assent of a majority of all the judges to a judgment, which pronounces a state law void, as being in violation 
of the constitution or laws of the United States. Do you see 
any great evil in such a provision? Judge Todd told me he 
thought it would give great satisfaction in the West. In what 
phraseology would you make such a provision ? 

As to the bankrupt law, pray give me your ideas of an outline, as I must bring forward some resolutions on that subject 
before the end of the session. I know how much you are 
employed, but still I must have one half hour. 

Mrs. Webster desires her best regards to Mrs. Story rand 
yourself. I will also beg to be remembered to Mrs. Story. I 
hope you will allow me to hear from you soon. 

With constant regard, yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Sunday Morning. I hardly know what our votes of 
yesterday indicate, as to the final decision on the tariff. My 
impression rather is, that the bill will hardly get through our 
House. It certainly would not, if there were not so many 
members who vote on the judgment of their constituents, not 
on their own. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, April 18, 1824 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Mr. Clay's speech is printed ; mine is in 
press, and both shall be sent to you in pamphlet. 1 

I hope to get away by 12th May ? and to be at home in season 
to see you at Dorchester the week before the General Court 
meets at Concord. The ensuing summer I shall do nothing 

i Speech on the Tariff, April 1 and 2, 1824, 
VOL. i. 30 
but move about and play. I shall certainly spend a fortnight 
with you at Boscawen, and the rest you must spend with us. 
August we will pass together on Cape Cod. My wife wants 
some one to ride about with her, while I am shooting, &c. 

The tariff will not pass the Senate without great amendment. 

We have struck a mortal blow on the tariff principle. If it 
were not for instruction and other nonsense, two thirds nearly 
of our House would be against it. It would be a noble thing 
for Mason, Haven, and yourself, to draw up resolutions that 
should be just and sensible on that subject, and pass them 
through the New Hampshire Legislature. 

There is nothing new about President, except that I think 
Mr. Adams's prospects have grown more favorable for a few 
weeks. 

I enclose you three letters by way of samples of my correspondence. I shall answer none of them. If you see my " old 
friend D. Dyer," I have no objection to your telling him that I 
remember him, and that I wished you to make him a present 
of a few dollars in my name, if he be poor as represented. I 
have many more letters equally interesting. My wife and 
children are well, and send their love to you and yours. 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Washington, May 4, 1824. 

DEAR SIR, We had the Supreme Court before us yesterday, 
rather unexpectedly, and a debate arose which lasted all day. 
Cohens v. Virginia, Green and Biddle, &c. were all discussed. 
Most of the gentlemen were very temperate and guarded ; there 
were, however, some exceptions, especially Mr. Randolph, 
whose remarks were not a little extraordinary. Mr. Barbour 
re-argued Cohen's case ; Mr. Letcher and Mr. Wickliffe did the 
same for Green and Biddle ; I said some few things, eo instanti, 
which I thought the case called for. The proposition for the 
concurrence of five judges will not prevail. This morning I 
have submitted my own proposition, which I apprehend will 
receive very general assent. 

Just as I was getting out of other troubles, this business of 
Mr. Edwards came upon me. I could not avoid it. 

This fine weather passes off without my knowing whether it 
rains or shines. From nine in the morning till eleven at night, I 
am shut up either in the House or the committee rooms. I am, 
however, remarkably well for me; and have, I believe, in a 
month picked up some pounds avoir du pois of flesh. 

My wife sends her love to you and yours. We are " dreadful 
homesick." 

Yours always, D. WEBSTER. 



GOVERNOR GORE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Waltham, May 11, 1824, 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for an excellent speech, lately 
received, on the tariff, replete in my estimation with true principles and sound doctrines, which, if acted upon, would promote 
the individual objects exclusively intended to be fostered, at 
the same time that the other great interests of the community 
would be preserved. 

No one rejoices more sincerely than myself at witnessing 
your advance in the public mind. There is hardly cavil and 
carping enough to relieve you from the denunciation pronounced against him of whom all speak well. 

Governor Eustis will ride triumphantly into the chair of 
State, and has the cheering prospect of being buried under 
arms ; that, to a minister of war, and one who has been in the 
field of Waterloo, must brighten his setting sun. 

I owe a bill to Gales and Seaton for The Intelligencer from 
some time in 1822 or 1823. Be so good as to pay the amount 
and to the end of the current year of my subscription. I will 
repay you on your return. 

With great regard, I remain, my dear Sir, your affectionate 
friend, and obedient servant, 

C. GORE. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. BLAKE. 

Washington, June 9, 1824. 

MY DEAR MADAM, Mrs. Coyle has granted me the honor of 
franking a letter to you, which, in her opinion, contains something which in its perfect state a good deal resembled yourself. 
I presume on the further liberty of writing this, just to inform 
yourself and husband that I am yet alive, and do not hope to 
be quite forgotten. I have been as far as Philadelphia with 
Mrs. Webster; there we parted, and I suppose she will have the 
pleasure of seeing you next week. I am yet busy, with little 
to do ; and hope to leave a P. P. C. with the whole of Washington in four or five days. 

You will not expect me to say how suddenly and how really 
all things seemed changed here, when you and your husband 
departed. No talks, no music, no rides, no little suppers on the 
light stand, no birthnight balls. And now, since Mrs. Webster 
and Julia, and that good-for-nothing Ned, are gone, it is lonely 
enough. 

I pray you tell Mr. Blake, that after I get home, if I ever 
should do so, I expect to find him ready for play the residue of 
the summer. I am yet not so reduced but that I could walk 
with a bit of iron on my shoulder. Truth to tell I am extremely homesick ; and I shall reckon it a happy day, when I 
set my face northward. 

I hope George has become quite well, and that he has kept a 
controlling eye on Master Daniel, during his vacation. You 
have done the said master a great favor by allowing him a 
shelter. 

I pray you, my dear lady, to make my love to your husband, 
and to believe me with great truth and regard, 

Yours, DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BLAKE. 



Washington, June 16, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been thinking a good deal of you foi 
the last three days. It is very unhappy to associate the idea of 

one's friend with anything disagreeable, ugly, or abominable. 
And yet, my dear Sir, that unluckily happens to me. And 
what disagreeable or abominable thing do you think it is which 
brings you to my mind, and keeps you there ? Simply our old 
enemy, the east wind. Here he is, however little you might 
suspect it, in great strength and true character. I have tasted it 
for three successive mornings. It has its old flavor. I have 
never known certainly such weather here, at this season. It 
was cold enough yesterday morning for a frost. I am here yet 
on a certain committee. We hope to get through the evidence 
to-day, and then to wind up our labors soon. I am, in the 
mean time, trying to get along with a few Spanish claims, in 
which I have made some little progress. All that I can do here, 
I wish to do, while I have the aid of Mr. Jaudon, and all the 
papers. I have, for this reason, dispersed what I have received 
as fast as possible among those to whom it belongs, saving a 
little to buy a few articles that may be necessary about August. 

I trust I shall get away before the week is out. I am homesick homesick homesick. I learn that Mrs. Webster was to 
embark yesterday from New York for New Haven. I presume 
she will be in Dorchester by the time you receive this. 

We have no news here worth communicating. Pray give 
my most profound regards to Mrs. Blake. If I live to get home, 
I shall be glad. 

Yours, D. W. 

P. S. Have you been at Cohasset or Chelsea Beach ? Are 
you ever found riding with an umbrella 1 in your chaise? 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, November 6, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, I was about writing to you this morning, 
when I received your letter. I assure you few things of the

you on my return from New Hampshire. But truly, we could 
not do it. There were strong reasons why I should come by 
way of Dunstable, or go there after I got home ; and I found I 
could not have time for the latter. I came home from Washington so late, that there has been no summer. But I am still 
more disappointed at your abandonment of the intention of 
coming here. I beg you to reconsider that matter. It is yet a 
fortnight before you are wanted at Concord. Pray come over 
the ensuing week, and stay a day or two, if no more. I shall 
be at home, as I expect, every day, and with no engagement of 
business. By the 16th or 17th, I must be off. If you are afraid 
to come to Boston, I will meet you, any day, except Friday, at 
Salem, on a little notice. But it will be no more trouble for 
you to come here. You need see nobody, unless you choose. 
We are in town, safe and snug, and can give you a bed. Pray 
come if you can, and write me on Monday to let me know if 
we may look for you. 

I am quite astonished at New Hampshire votes. From the 
Concord and the Keene papers, I should think probably that 
Ezekiel Webster is chosen, though by no means certain ; but at 
any rate, the result shows some new movements and workings 
in the public mind. 

I shall write to Mr. Haven next week, unless I learn that you 
are coming up. You certainly do very right to go to Concord. 
My brother has been here this week ; he thinks there are very 
good prospects of a pleasant session. Interested individuals 
may pretend that the result of the late voting proves only a 
surprise on the old democratic party, I think otherwise. It 
appears to me to indicate a diminution of party feeling, and a 
growing regard to personal character. 

Yours always, with much love from Mrs. Webster to you and 
yours. I shall hear from you by Tuesday; I hope, that you 
are coming ; don't disappoint us. 

Yours always, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 4, 1824. 

MY DEAR LOVE, I have made an engagement to take 
lodgings at a Mr. Mcln tire's, Pennsylvania Avenue, between 
Mrs. Peyton's and Brown's on the opposite side. It is a new 
house, and the people seem to be good people. I have a large 
room in front to myself, and a very comfortable lodging-room. 
There are some other persons living in the house, but my 
establishment is all to myself. Charles is to be my servant ; I 
am to take possession to-morrow, and present prospects are 
favorable. 

I dined to-day at Mrs. Coyles. Her house is not yet full. 
She says she has never had so much difficulty in making up a 
mess. Mr. Williams, Mr. Baylies, Mr. McKee, and Mr. Storrs, 
are there, and nobody else at present. You will hardly be sorry 
to hear that poor old Mary is dead. She was sick all summer, 
and Mrs. Coyle says she was a perfect slave to her many 
months ; not an unjust retribution. She died a month ago. 

I am going up this evening to see the President. 

Yours always, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I have your letter of Thanksgiving day and William's 
from New York. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 6, 1824. 

MY DEAR LOVE, I am so happy as to have received yours 
of the 2d instant, and to hear of the health and happiness of 
you all. 

For two days I have been busy in getting into my new 
lodgings ; and by to-morrow evening hope to have all things in 
order. I am a good deal like Robinson Crusoe; I have an 
outer room, and an inner one for retreat, and a man Friday ; 
and except Friday, am quite alone. 

Thus far every thing looks well. The keepers of the house 
seem to be very obliging, neat, good people ; and for convenience of work and business, I have never been better off here. 
1 am sorry to find that my books have suffered much. They 
look as if they had all been tumbled into the cellar together. 
However, I hope in a day or two to get the mould off, though 
the scratches and bruises are likely to remain. 

Mrs. Brown gave her first party last night. Having occasion 
to go to the President's, I called on my return. It was the 
assemblage pretty much of a Washington party of last year. 
Mrs. Johnston was there and spoke of you with great kindness, 
and inquired for you very particularly. Her youngest boy is 
six weeks old. Many other ladies, and gentleman also ! asked 
after your welfare with much apparent interest, and one of them 
pronounced you a favorite of the whole city. Mr. Vaughan is 
unbounded in his thanks for what he calls our kindness at 
Boston, and by way of proof has invited me to a small dinner 
on Monday. Mrs. Lowell has a party on Friday, and this I 
believe is all the Washington news I have. 

I thank Julia for her very good and kind letter, and Master 
D. for his imitation of an obedient medal. Whatsoever is 
properly obedient I hope he will continue successfully to 
imitate. 

I shall write Julia soon. I hope Edward will not surfer me 
much longer to languish for a letter from his pen. A single 
one of his delicate and delightful scrawls would give me 
pleasure. 

Adieu, my dear Grace, give my love "to all the house." 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 8, 1824, Friday evening. 

MY DEA.R LOVE, I am happy to have a letter to-day from 
Uncle William, under a Boston date. He seems to have had a 
rapid passage home, and informs me you were all welJ Monday 
morning. 

I am at length pretty well settled in my new abode, and well 
pleased with it. 

Together with this, I send a little box, in which, when you 
have taken all the papers off and opened it, you will find two 
little bits of articles l designed as presents. One of them, if you 
like it, you will place in your own cap ; and the other in Col. 
Paige's ruffle. Give him a box on the ear, and tell him to be a 
good boy. The one intended for him is that with a single stone 
and pillar. If you do not fancy yours, you can return it to me 
in the same little box, and the proprietor will take it back again. 
If he does not fancy his, tell him he is no true man. Intending 
to put a thing of this kind in the Colonel's shirt, I sent for one, 
and the jeweller sent me two, to make a choice from. They 
both seemed pretty ; and Mr. "Wallenstein thought the one with 
three stones would be very proper for a lady ; so I send both. 

Mrs. Lowell has a party to-night, and if I am not too sleepy 
at eight o'clock, I intend to go. 

I hope to hear from you to-morrow, as I have no letter to-day. 

Adieu, with love to all. 

Yours always, D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Washington, December 23, 1824. 

MY DEAR CHARLES, I have received your letter, and under 
present circumstances, you must expect only a brief answer. 

I hope you will write your oration for the Phi Beta Kappa. 
The subject you speak of is a good one ; but will lead you, I 
fancy, to this result, that is, that the period of literature " most 
adapted to form the character of those who are to bear a part 
in our future transactions," is the present period. This is an 
age of free, powerful, and intense thinking, rather than an age 
of fine writing. The wits of Anne's time were fit to polish the 
age, perhaps more than to advance it in positive acquirement. 
If I have leisure, I will sometime give you my thoughts on this 
matter at large, but I am so poor a manager of the great 

1 Two diamond pins. 
treasure, time, that I never have on hand any stock to disburse. 
And this metaphor brings me to the other part of your letter, 
on which I have to say, that if you think you can do any thing 
useful with a thousand dollars, you may have that sum in the 
spring, or sooner if need be, on the following conditions : 1. You 
must give a note for it, with reasonable security. 2. The interest must be payable annually, and must be paid at the day 
without fail. And so long as this continues to be done, the 
money not to be called for, the principal, under six months' 
notice. 

I am thus explicit with you, because you wish me to be so ; 
and because, also, having a little money, and but a little, I am 
resolved on keeping it. My days of hard work have been many, 
too many to be repeated. I must now live, principally upon 
what I have got ; and though I am willing to loan to my friends 
in preference to other modes of investment, in some cases, yet 
in no case can I do so on other conditions than as above. 
Your hard-hearted uncle, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

December 28, 1824. 

DEAR DANIEL, The Concord Register, under its editorial 
head, gives a pretty correct account of the closing scene in our 
Senate. The Journal of the same day, last Saturday, has a 
statement under the hand of Mr. Haven. I think our Senate 
are in a promising way to be as immortal as the New York 
seventeen. 

If a majority of our Senate are to be believed, Mr. Mason was 
chosen. When you have the facts, I should like very well to 
have an article appear in the National Intelligencer, on the extraordinary conduct of a majority who denied the inquiry into 
the mistake, &c. It should appear as editorial. If it could not 
appear in the Intelligencer, it might perhaps be inserted in the 
National Journal. A well-written article would count here. 

Our object now is to secure such a Senate and House as will 
elect Mr. Mason next June. We feel the importance of having 
such a man of talents and integrity in our national councils. 

We shall make an effort from a sense of duty. If you notice any 
thing which will have a favorable bearing, please to forward it. 

We had a campaign of seven weeks. We kept our armor 
buckled on and slept upon our arms, and the New Hampshire 
troops never did themselves more credit since they fought at 
Bunker Hill and Bennington. 

Yours, &c., E. WEBSTER. 



MRS. WEBSTER TO MR. WEBSTER. 

[Boston,] December 28, 1824. 

I HAVE a great desire to write to you, my beloved husband, but 
I doubt if I can Write legibly, as I can hold my pen but in my 
fingers. 1 I have just received your letter in answer to William, 
which told you that dear little Charley was no more. I have 
dreaded the hour that should destroy your hopes, but trust you 
will not let this event afflict you too much, and that we both 
shall be able to resign him without a murmur, happy in the reflection that he has returned to his Heavenly Father pure as 
I received him. It was an inexpressible consolation to me, when 
I contemplated him in his sickness, that he had not one regret 
for the past, nor one dread for the future ; he was patient as a 
lamb during all his sufferings, and they were at last so great, I 
was happy when they were ended. 

I shall always reflect on his brief life with mournful pleasure, 
and, I hope, remember with gratitude all the joy he gave me ; 
and it has been great. And oh ! how fondly did I flatter myself 
it would be lasting. 

" It was but yesterday, my child, thy little heart beat high ; 

And I had scorned the warning voice that told me thou must die." 

Dear little Charles ! He sleeps alone under St. Paul's. I cannot 
express how much I regret that it did not occur to any one of 
us to have the dear remains of Grace removed. I thought much 
of it when the tomb of Mr. Sullivan was opened for Mrs. Sullivan's little boy. I regretted you were not here to consult upon 

l Mrs. Webster had received an injury on the thumb of the right hand. 
the subject. Oh, do not, my dear husband, talk of your own 
"final abode;" that is a subject I never can dwell on for a 
moment. With you here, my dear, I can never be desolate ! 
O may Heaven in its mercy long preserve you ! and that we 
may ever wisely improve every event, and yet rejoice together 
in this life, prays your ever affectionate 

G. W. 

I ought to mention William's unwearied attention and kindness to dear little Charles. His grief is great at the loss. Poor 
Nancy came last Friday ; she is much afflicted that she did not 
come in time to see the dear little boy once more. She begs you 
to accept her sympathy and love. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Washington, December 29, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR, We have heard of the adjournment of the 
Legislature of New Hampshire without having effected a choice 
of Senator. Seeing, towards the close, that the Senate were 
equally divided, I had some hope that a choice might be made. 
But, on a general view, the result is more favorable than there 
was reason to expect. So decisive a feeling in the House, and an 
equality in such a Senate, were circumstances showing very solid 
strength. I am sure, my dear Sir, you have no reason to regret 
the occurrences of the session. They have shown to the public 
your personal weight and consideration with the State ; and they 
have also given an opportunity for the people of the State to 
learn your standing with the community generally. Public opinion, whenever expressed, has been uniformly in your favor. Here, 
I may assure you, all considerable men, of all parties and all associations, have felt and expressed the same wishes. Mr. Parrot 
is generally respected, and while he was of the number of candidates, being the present incumbent, a desire to have you here 
was naturally a little mitigated by a feeling of unwillingness to 
dispossess him. But, he being out of the case, if there were any 
who did not wish your success, there were none who ventured 
to express such feelings. Looking at the matter at a distance, 

and judging only from the operation of general causes, I should 
think your election was only postponed ; nothing else can happen, certainly, if the House, now soon to be elected, be like its 
predecessor. I should not think it of first importance to turn out 
those Senators ; if the House remain of the same opinion, the 
Senate must come to it. 

I have been home from Virginia a week. My intention was to 
go to Richmond and Norfolk, from Monticello, but intelligence 
from home induced me to return, without accomplishing that 
part of my intention. We were two days at Mr. Madison's. He 
was very agreeable, and treated us with much hospitality. He 
keeps alive a stronger interest in passing events than his more 
advanced friend. Mrs. Madison is in perfect health, and remembers all her Washington acquaintances. At Mr. Jefferson's, 
we remained five days. This was something longer than our 
intention, but there came rains, which prevented our departure. 
Mr. Jefferson is a man of whom one may form a very just account, as to person and manners, from description and pictures. 
We met him in the road, and I knew him at once, although he 
was on horseback, something straighter, and freer from the debility 
of age than I had expected. We found him uniformly pleasant, 
social, and interesting. He talked less of present things than 
might be expected, although in the intercourse with gentlemen 
under his own roof, he did not keep back his opinions on men 
or things. But if I were to say what appeared to be the leading 
topics with him, and those to which his mind habitually turned 
itself, I should mention three : early anecdotes of revolutionary 
times ; French society, politics, and literature such as they were 
when he was in France, and general literature ; and the Virginia 
university. On these three general topics he has much to say, 
and he says it all well. 

Since I returned here, I have not been in the way of hearing 
much said on the election of President. It would be difficult, in 
my opinion, to say which of the two leading candidates has the 
best chance, but if I were to express an opinion, such as it is, it 
would be at this moment that Mr. Adams's chance is best. New 
England, 6 ; New York, Delaware, Virginia, Georgia, North 
Carolina, Ohio, Louisiana, Illinois, out of these 14, I think it 
not unlikely Mr. Adams may get 13. He may also get New 
Jersey. It seems to me that there is, at this moment, rather a 
VOL. i. 31 
reaction against General Jackson ; a feeling somewhat adverse 
to giving the Presidency to mere military character. 

I propose to do nothing this session myself but a few useful 
and necessary things ; such as to provide for the punishment of 
some crimes, now unprovided for, &c. My health is very good. 
You see what Mr. Randolph said about his letter. He had 
talked with some of the committee, and told a story, material or 
immaterial, which he thought they would confirm. I had not 
been spoken to ; it occurred to me at the moment to be the right 
course to put the main question to him, coolly and quietly, and 
let him answer or evade it, as he chose. His course was open 
enough to remark, but I did not wish to have a quarrel, or to go 
further than the strict necessity of self-defence. Whether I 
judged right or not, I cannot tell. 

I should be glad to hear from you, now that you have returned 
from your Concord expedition. Give my remembrance, affectionately, to your family, and believe me truly, 

Yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 29, 1824. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have not heard from you for a long time, nor 
had much leisure to write since my return from Virginia. The 
information which has reached me from home 1 must have 
reached you sooner. I think of this loss with great grief ; but I 
think also that you lost all your little boys ; and I hope to sustain 
myself with the consciousness, that my blessings are still much 
more numerous than my afflictions. I wish you would sometimes write to my wife, it would give her great pleasure, as I 
think her affection for you is pretty much her first feeling out of 
her own family. 

I had a pleasant journey, on many accounts, in Virginia. Saw 
many things and some men, and had a pretty fair opportunity 
of learning what Virginia is. In the ensuing month, I must pay 

i Of the death of his youngest son, Charles. 

some little attention to the public business. There is nothing 
of great importance or peculiar interest in which I expect to be 
concerned. February must be devoted to the court, and early in 
March I hope to be home. 

I have seen your legislative proceedings through. You have 
come out about where we expected, except that having got unexpectedly half the " committee on the change of names," you 
unexpectedly, I should think, failed to get one more. 

Every thing now depends on the new House. If that remains 
firm and strong, no matter who the Senators are they must 
come in. I do not see but you must go once more into the 
House, though I regret it, as I had laid out for a journey next 
June. Constancy to Mr. Mason seems to require it. I should 
like to know what you think of your congressional chance. 

Does the law confine the votes to you and Mr. Healey ? 

Will this struggle for Senator make a pretty active election, 
and will that help or hurt you ? You have districted the State. 
Does Merrimac County form precisely one district ? 

I wrote you, some time ago, for your and Mr. Mason's opinion about Bunker Hill ; you have not given it to me. In hopes 
of hearing from you soon, I am, Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 


MEMORANDUM 



OF MR. JEFFERSON'S CONVERSATIONS. 

[In December, eighteen hundred and twenty-four, Mr. Webster, with a party 
of friends, visited Mr. Madison and Mr. Jefferson at their respective residences 
in Virginia. He afterward noted down portions of the conversations, during the 
visit to Mr. Jefferson, which, as they are very entertaining and instructive, are 
subjoined.] 

December, 1824. 

MR. JEFFERSON is now between eighty-one and eighty-two, 
above six feet high, of an ample, long frame, rather thin and 
spare. His head, which is not peculiar in its shape, is set rather 
forward on his shoulders; and his neck being long, there is, 
when he is walking or conversing, an habitual protrusion of it. 
It is still well covered with hair, which having been once red, 
and now turning gray, is of an indistinct sandy color. 

His eyes are small, very light, and now neither brilliant nor 
striking. His chin is rather long, but not pointed. His nose 
small, regular in its outline, and the nostrils a little elevated. 
His mouth is well formed and still filled with teeth ; it is 
strongly compressed, bearing an expression of contentment and 
benevolence. His complexion, formerly light and freckled, now 
bears the marks of age and cutaneous affection. His limbs are 
uncommonly long ; his hands and feet very large, and his wrists 
of an extraordinary size. His walk is not precise and military, 
but easy and swinging. He stoops a little, not so much from 
age as from natural formation. When sitting, he appears short, 
partly from a rather lounging habit of sitting, and partly from 
the disproportionate length of his limbs. 

His dress, when in the house, is a gray surtout coat, kerseymere stuff waistcoat, with an under one faced with some material of a dingy red. His pantaloons are very long and loose, 
and of the same color as his coat. His stockings are woollen 
either white or gray ; and his shoes of the kind that bear his 
name. His whole dress is very much neglected, but not slovenly. 
He wears a common round hat. His dress, when on horseback, 
is a gray straight-bodied coat and a spencer of the same material, 

both fastened with large pearl buttons. When we first saw him, 
he was riding ; and, in addition to the above articles of apparel, 
wore round his throat a knit white woollen tippet, in the place 
of a cravat, and black velvet gaiters under his pantaloons. His 
general appearance indicates an extraordinary degree of health, 
vivacity, and spirit. His sight is still good, for he needs glasses 
only in the evening. His hearing is generally good, but a 
number of voices in animated conversation confuses it. 

Mr. Jefferson rises in the morning as soon as he can see the 
hands of his clock, which is directly opposite his bed, and 
examines his thermometer immediately, as he keeps a regular 
meteorological diary. He employs himself chiefly in writing 
till breakfast, which is at nine. From that time, till dinner, he 
is in his library, excepting that in fair weather he rides on horseback from seven to fourteen miles. Dines at four, returns to 
the drawing-room at six, when coffee is brought in, and passes 
the evening till nine in conversation. His habit of retiring at 
that hour is so strong, that it has become essential to his health 
and comfort. His diet is simple, but he seems restrained only 
by his taste. His breakfast is tea and coffee, bread always 
fresh from the oven, of which he does not seem afraid, with 
sometimes a slight accompaniment of cold meat. He enjoys 
his dinner well, taking with his meat a large proportion of 
vegetables. He has a strong preference for the wines of the 
continent, of which he has many sorts of excellent quality, having been more than commonly successful in his mode of importing and preserving them. Among others, we found the following, which are very rare in this country, and apparently not at 
all injured by transportation : L'Ednau, Muscat, Samian, and 
Blanchette de Limoux. Dinner is served in half Virginian, half 
French style, in good taste and abundance. No wine is put on 
the table till the cloth is removed. 

In conversation, Mr. Jefferson is easy and natural, and apparently not ambitious ; it is not loud, as challenging general 
attention, but usually addressed to the person next him. The 
topics, when not selected to suit the character and feelings of 
his auditor, are those subjects with which his mind seems particularly occupied ; and these, at present, may be said to be 
science and letters, and especially the University of Virginia, 
which is coming into existence almost entirely from his exer31* 
tions, and will rise, it is to be hoped, to usefulness and credit 
under his continued care. When we were with him, his favorite subjects were Greek and Anglo-Saxon, historical recollections 
of the times and events of the Revolution, and of his residence 
in France from 1783-4 to 1789. 

[In the course of the evening when the preceding was written, from Mr. 
Webster's dictation, the following anecdotes from Mr. Jefferson's conversation 
were recalled and written down : ] 

PATRICK HENRY. 

Was originally a bar-keeper. He was married very young, and 
going into some business, on his own account, was a bankrupt 
before the year was out. When I was about the age of fifteen, 
I left the school here, to go to the college at Williamsburgh. I 
stopped a few days at a friend's in the county of Louisa. There 
I first saw and became acquainted with Patrick Henry. Having 
spent the Christmas holidays there, I proceeded to Williamsburgh. Some question arose about my admission, as my preparatory studies had not been pursued at the school connected 
with that institution. This delayed my admission about a fortnight, at which time Henry appeared in Williamsburgh, and 
applied for a license to practise law, having commenced the 
study of it at or subsequently to the time of my meeting him 
in Louisa. There were four examiners, Wythe, Pendleton, 
Peyton Randolph, and John Randolph ; Wythe and Pendleton 
at once rejected his application. The two Randolphs, by his 
importunity, were prevailed upon to sign the license ; and having obtained their signatures, he applied again to Pendleton, 
and after much entreaty and many promises of future study, 
succeeded in obtaining his. He then turned out for a practising lawyer. The first case which brought him into notice, 
was a contested election, in which he appeared as counsel 
before a committee of the House of Burgesses. His second 
was the Parsons cause, already well known. These and similar 
efforts soon obtained for him so much reputation, that he was 
elected a member of the legislature. He was as well suited to the 
times as any man ever was, and it is not now easy to say what 
we should have done without Patrick Henry. He was far before 
all in maintaining the spirit of the Revolution. His influence 



DANIEL WEBSTER 367 

was most extensive with the members from the upper counties, 
and his boldness and their votes overawed and controlled the 
more cool or the more timid aristocratic gentlemen of the lower 
part of the State. His eloquence was peculiar, if indeed it 
should be called eloquence ; for it was impressive and sublime, 
beyond what can be imagined. Although it was difficult when 
he had spoken to tell what he had said, yet, while he was speaking, it always seemed directly to the point. When he had 
spoken in opposition to my opinion, had produced a great effect, 
and I myself been highly delighted and moved, I have asked myself when he ceased : " What the d 1 has he said ? " I could 
never answer the inquiry. His person was of full size, and his 
manner and voice free and manly. His utterance neither very 
fast nor very slow. His speeches generally short, from a quarter to a half an hour. His pronunciation was vulgar and vicious, 
but it was forgotten while he was speaking. 

He was a man of very little knowledge of any sort ; he read 
nothing, and had no books. Returning one November from Albemarle court, he borrowed of me Hume's Essays, in two volumes, 
saying he should have leisure in the winter for reading. In the 
spring he returned them, and declared he had not been able to go 
further than twenty or thirty pages in the first volume. He wrote 
almost nothing he could not write. The resolutions of '75, 
which have been ascribed to him, have by many been supposed 
to have been written by Mr. Johnson, who acted as his second on 
that occasion ; but if they were written by Henry himself, they 
are not such as to prove any power of composition. Neither in 
politics nor in his profession was he a man of business ; he was 
a man for debate only. His biographer says that he read Plutarch every year. I doubt whether he ever read a volume of it 
in his life. His temper was excellent, and he generally observed 
decorum in debate. On one or two occasions I have seen him 
angry, and his anger was terrible ; those who witnessed it, were 
not disposed to rouse it again. In his opinions he was yielding 
and practicable and not disposed to differ from his friends. In 
private conversation, he was agreeable and facetious, and, while 
in genteel society, appeared to understand all the decencies and 
proprieties of it ; but, in his heart, he preferred low society, and 
sought it as often as possible. He would hunt in the pine woods 
of Fluvannah, with overseers, and people of that description, 
living in a camp for a fortnight at a time without a change of 
raiment. I have often been astonished at his command of 
proper language ; how he attained the knowledge of it, I never 
could find out, as he read so little and conversed little with 
educated men. After all, it must be allowed that he was our 
leader in the measures of the Revolution, in Virginia. In that 
respect more was due to him than any other person. If we had 
not had him we should probably have got on pretty well, as you 
did, by a number of men of nearly equal talents, but he left us 
all far behind. His biographer sent the sheets of his work to 
me as they were printed, and at the end asked for my opinion. 
I told him it would be a question hereafter, whether his work 
should be placed on the shelf of history or of panegyric. It is a 
poor book written in bad taste, and gives so imperfect an idea 
of Patrick Henry, that it seems intended to show off the writer 
more than the subject of the work. 



Throughout the whole Revolution, Virginia and the four 
New England States acted together ; indeed, they made the 
Revolution. Their five votes were always to be counted on ; 
but they had to pick up the remaining two for a majority, when 
and where they could. 



About the time of the Boston Port Bill, the patriotic feeling 
in Virginia had become languid and worn out, from some 
cause or other. It was thought by some of us to be absolutely 
necessary to excite the people ; but we hardly knew the right 
means. At length it occurred to us to make grave faces and 
propose a fast. Some of us, who were the younger members 
of the assembly, resolved upon the measure. We thought 
Oliver Cromwell would be a good guide in such a case. So 
we looked into Rushworth, and drew up our resolutions after the 
most pious and praiseworthy examples. It would hardly have 
been in character for us to present them ourselves. We applied 
therefore to Mr. Nicholas, a grave and religious man ; he proposed them in a set and solemn speech ; some of us gravely 
seconded him, and the resolutions were passed unanimously. 
If any debate had occurred, or if they had been postponed for 

consideration, there was no chance that they would have been 
passed. The next morning Lord Bottetourt, the governor, summoned the assembly to his presence, and said to them : " I have 
heard of your proceedings of yesterday, and augur ill of their 
effects. His Majesty's interest requires that you be dissolved, 
and you are dissolved." Another election taking place soon 
afterwards, such was the spirit of the times, that every member 
of the assembly, without an individual exception, was re-elected. 
Our fast produced very considerable effect. We all agreed 
to go home and see that preachers were provided in our counties, 
and notice given to our people. I came home to my own 
county, provided a preacher, and notified the people, who came 
together in great multitudes, wondering what it meant. 



Lord Bottetourt was an honorable man. His government had 
authorized him to make certain assurances to the people here, 
which he made accordingly. He wrote to the minister that he 
had made these assurances, and that, unless he should be enabled 
to fulfil them, he must retire from his situation. This letter he 
sent unsealed to Peyton Randolph for his inspection. Lord 
Bottetourt's great respectability, his character for integrity, and 
his general popularity, would have enabled him to embarrass the 
measures of the patriots exceedingly. His death was, therefore, 
a fortunate event for the cause of the Revolution. He was the 
first governor in chief that had ever come over to Virginia. 
Before his time, we had received only deputies, the governor 
residing in England, with a salary of five thousand pounds, and 
paying his deputy one thousand pounds. 



When Congress met, Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee 
opened the subject with great ability and eloquence. So much 
so, that Paca and Chase, delegates from Maryland, said to each 
other as they returned from the House : " We shall not be 
wanted here ; those gentlemen from Virginia will be able to do 
every thing without us." But neither Henry nor Lee were men 
of business, and having made strong and eloquent general 
speeches, they had done aU they could. 

It was thought advisable that two papers should be drawn up, 
one, an address to the people of England, and the other, an address, I think, to the king. Committees were raised for these 
purposes, and Henry was at the head o the first, and Lee of 
the second. 

When the address to the people of England was reported, 
Congress heard it with utter amazement. It was miserably 
written and good for nothing. At length Governor Livingston 
of New Jersey, ventured to break silence. After complimenting 
the author, he said he thought some other ideas might be usefully added to his draft of the address. Some such paper had 
been for a considerable time contemplated, and he believed a 
friend of his had tried his hand in the composition of one. He 
thought if the subject were again committed, some improvement 
in the present draft might be made. It was accordingly recommitted, and the address which had been alluded to by Governor 
Livingston, and which was written by John Jay, was reported 
by the committee, and adopted as it now appears. 

It 18^ in my opinion, one of the very best state papers which 
the Revolution produced. 



Richard Henry Lee moved the Declaration of Independence, 
in pursuance of the resolutions of the assembly of Virginia, 
and only because he was the oldest member of the Virginia 
delegation. 



The Declaration of Independence was written in a house on 
the north side of Chestnut street, Philadelphia, between third 
and fourth, not a corner house. Heiskell's tavern, which has 
been pointed out as the house, is not the true one. 



For depth of purpose, zeal, and sagacity, no man in Congress 
exceeded, if any equalled Sam. Adams; and none did more 
than he to originate and sustain revolutionary measures in 
Congress. But he could not speak ; he had a hesitating, grunting manner. 

John Adams was our Colossus on the floor. He was not 
graceful, nor elegant, nor remarkably fluent ; but he came out, 



DANIEL WEBSTER., 371 

occasionally, with a power of thought and expression that 
moved us from our seats. 



I feel much alarmed at the prospect of seeing General Jackson President. He is one of the most unfit men I know of for 
such a place. He has had very little respect for laws or constitutions, and is, in fact, an able military chief. His passions 
are terrible. When I was President of the Senate he was a 
Senator ; and he could never speak on account of the rashness 
of his feelings. I have seen him attempt it repeatedly, and as 
often choke with rage. His passions are no doubt cooler now ; 
he has been much tried since I knew him, but he is a dangerous 
man. 



When I was in France, the Marquis de Chasteleux carried 
me over to BufTon's residence in the country, and introduced 
me to him. 

It was Buffon's practice to remain in his study till dinner 
time, and receive no visitors under any pretence ; but his house 
was open and his grounds, and a servant showed them very 
civilly, and invited all strangers and friends to remain to dine. 
We saw Buffon in the garden, but carefully avoided him ; but 
we dined with him, and he proved himself then, as he always 
did, a man of extraordinary powers in conversation. He did 
not declaim ; he was singularly agreeable. 

I was introduced to him as Mr. Jefferson, who, in some notes 
on Virginia, had combated some of his opinions. Instead of 
entering into an argument, he took down his last work, presented it to me, and said, " When Mr. Jefferson shall have read 
this, he will be perfectly satisfied that I am right." 

Being about to embark from Philadelphia for France, 1 
observed an uncommonly large panther skin at the door of a 
hatter's shop. I bought it for half a Jo (sixteen dollars) on the 
spot, determining to carry it to France to convince Monsieur 
Buffon of his mistake in relation to this animal ; which he had 
confounded with the cougar. He acknowledged his mistake, 
and said he would correct it in his next volume. 

I attempted also to convince him of his error in relation to 
the common deer, and the moose of America ; he having confounded our deer with the red deer of Europe, and our moose 
with the reindeer. I told him that our deer had horns two 
feet long; he replied with warmth, that if I could produce a 
single specimen, with horns one foot long, he would give up the 
question. Upon this I wrote to Virginia for the horns of one 
of our deer, and obtained a very good specimen, four feet long. 
I told him also that the reindeer could walk under the belly of 
our moose ; but he entirely scouted the idea. Whereupon I 
wrote to General Sullivan of New Hampshire. I desired him 
to send me the bones, skin, and antlers of our moose, supposing 
they could easily be procured by him. Six months afterwards 
my agent in England advised me that General Sullivan had 
drawn on him for forty guineas. I had forgotten my request, 
and wondered why such a draft had been made, but I paid it at 
once. A little later came a letter from General Sullivan, setting 
forth the manner in which he had complied with my request. 
He had been obliged to raise a company of nearly twenty men, 
had made an excursion towards the White Hills, camping out 
many nights, and had at last after many difficulties caught my 
moose, boiled his bones in the desert, stuffed his skin and 
remitted him to me. This accounted for my debt and convinced Mr. Buffon. He promised in his next volume to set 
these things right also, but he died directly afterwards. 



Madame Houdetot's society was one of the most agreeable 
in Paris when I was there. She inherited the materials of 
which it was composed from Madame de Terrier and Madame 
Geoffrin. St. Lambert was always there, and it was generally 
believed that every evening on his return home, he wrote down 
the substance of the conversations he had held there with 
D'Alembert, Diderot, and the other distinguished persons, who 
frequented her house. From these conversations he made his 
books. 



I knew the Baron de Grignon very well ; he was quite ugly, 
and one of his legs was shorter than the other ; but he was the 
most agreeable person in French society, and his opinion was 

always considered decisive in matters relating to the theatre and 
painting. His persiflage was the keenest and most provoking 
I ever knew. 



Madame Necker was a very sincere and excellent woman, 
but she was not very pleasant in conversation, for she was 
subject to what in Virginia we call the " Budge," that is, she was 
very nervous and fidgety. She could rarely remain long in the 
same place, or converse long on the same subject. I have 
known her get up from table five or six times in the course 
of the dinner, and walk up and down her saloon to compose 
herself. 



Marmontel was a very amusing man. He dined with me 
every Thursday for a long time, and I think told some of the 
most agreeable stories I ever heard in my life. After his death, 
I found almost all of them in his memoirs, and I dare say he 
told them so well because he had written them before in his 
book. 



I wish Mr. Pickering would make a radical lexicon. It would 
do more than any thing else in the present state of the matter, to 
promote the study of Greek among us. Jones's Greek Lexicon 
is very poor. I have been much disappointed in it. The best 
J have ever used is the Greek and French one by Planche. 



VOL. I. 


DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 13, 1825. 

I AM much obliged to you for yours of the 10th. It gave me 
much information that I wanted. I trust you have not forgotten to write me again, having seen Mr. Mason at the court. 

I Hope you will pay all proper attention to your approaching 
election. The Patriot man, I perceive, is very angry, and will 
be very active. If you save the House you will save all. I hope 
that public opinion everywhere for Mr. Mason, will have some 
effect on the people of New Hampshire. 

As the 9th February approaches, we begin to hear a little 
more about the election. I think some important indications 
will be made soon. A main inquiry is, in what direction Mr. 
Clay and his friends will move. There would seem at present 
to be some reason to think they will take a part finally for Mr. 
Adams. This will not necessarily be decisive, but it will be 
very important. After all, I cannot predict results. I believe 
Mr. Adams might be chosen if he or his friends would act 
somewhat differently. But if he has good counsellors, I know 
not who they are. If Mr. Clay's friends should join Mr. Crawford's, it would probably put him ahead of Mr. Adams, the first 
ballot, and, that being done, I know not what might follow. 

I should like to know your opinion of what is proper to be 
done in two or three contingencies. 

1. If on the first or any subsequent ballot Mr. Adams falls 
behind Mr. Crawford, and remains so a day or two, shall we 
hold out to the end of the chapter, or shall we vote for one of 
the highest? 

2. If for one of the highest, say Jackson and Crawford, for 
which ? 

3. Is it advisable, under any circumstances, to hold out and 
leave the chair to Mr. Calhoun ? 

4. Would or would not New England prefer conferring the 
power on Calhoun, to a choice of General Jackson ? 

On these and other similar points, I want your full opinion 
by the first of next month. 

I shall write you again in a day or two. 

Yours, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

January 15, 1825. 

I HAVE written to the boys, 1 that I will help them a little, if 
you are satisfied it would do them good. I have told them 
that one of them would do well to come to Boscawen. I am 
willing to give them outright what I can afford ; or to help 
them in any other way you may think best. If two hundred 
dollars each would certainly pay their debts, it is pity -they 
should not have it. Please write them an encouraging word ; 
and if they come down let them have what you think proper ; 
preferring, if it can be done, to make a small gift rather than a 
large loan. I would be willing to give them one hundre-d dollars each. 

Yours, D. W. 



MRS. WEBSTER TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Saturday Morning, January 22, 1825. 

MY DEAR HUSBAND, I was sitting alone in my chamber 
reflecting on the brief life of our sainted little boy, when your 
letter came enclosing those lines of yours, which to a " mother's 
eye " are precious. O ! my husband, have not some of our 
brightest hopes perished ! " Our fairest flowers are indeed blossoms gathered for the tomb." But do not, my dear husband, do 
not let these afflictions weigh too heavily upon you ; those dear 
children who had such strong holds on us while here, now 
allure us to Heaven. 

" On us with looks of love they bend, 
For us the Lord of life implore, 
And oft from sainted bliss descend, 
Our wounded spirits to restore." 

Farewell, my beloved husband ! I have not time to write more, 
only to say I regret you have lost the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs. 

1 Nephews residing in Canada. 
Ticknor's society, which you so much need. I fear Mrs. 
Dwight is not much benefited by her voyage, so the last accounts appear ; though at first they thought her better. 

The children are tolerably well, though not free from colds. 
Your ever affectionate, G. W. 



LINES ON THE DEATH OF HIS SON CHARLES, BY MR. WEBSTER. 

MY son, thou wast my heart's delight, 
Thy morn of life was gay and cheery ; 
That morn has rushed to sudden night, 
Thy father's house is sad and dreary. 

I held thee on my knee, my son ! 

And kissed thee laughing, kissed thee weeping ; 

But ah ! thy little day is done, 

Thou'rt with thy angel sister sleeping. 

The staff, on which my years should lean, 
Is broken, ere those years come o'er me ; 
My funeral rites thou shoulds't have seen, 
But thou art in the tomb before me. 

Thou rear'st to me no filial stone, 

No parent's grave with tears beholdest ; 

Thou art my ancestor, my son ! 

And stand'st in Heaven's account the oldest. 

On earth my lot was soonest cast, 
Thy generation after mine, 
Thou hast thy predecessor past ; 
Earlier eternity is thine. 

I should have set before thine eyes 
The road to Heaven, and showed it clear ; 
But thou untaught springs't to the skies, 
And leav'st thy teacher lingering here. 

Sweet Seraph, I would learn of 'thee, 
And hasten to partake thy bliss ! 

And oh ! to thy world welcome me, 
As first I welcomed thee to this. 

Dear Angel, thou art safe in heaven ; 
No prayers for thee need more be made ; 
Oh ! let thy prayers for those be given 
Who oft have blessed thy infant head. 

My Father ! I beheld thee born, 
And led thy tottering steps with care ; 
Before me risen to Heaven's bright morn, 
My son ! My Father ! guide me there. 



MR. WARFIELD TO MR. WEBSTER. 

( CONFIDENTIAL . ) 

Washington, February 3, 1825. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am induced from the good feelings which I 
trust have always existed between us, to make to you this 
communication. The approaching presidential election gives 
me great anxiety. I am peculiarly situated; for although 
directly and indirectly I have been applied to, at least, I am 
sure, in a hundred instances, I have never expressed to a human 
being the vote I intend to give. The representation, as you 
know, is composed of nine members from Maryland ; every 
member except myself has expressed his opinion. The awful 
responsibility of the vote of that State may devolve on me. 
Nay, more, situated as the votes of the different States are, 
Maryland may make the President on the first ballot. Now, 
Sir, I am oppressed with this difficulty. Those with whom I 
am in the habit of associating in Maryland, are for the most 
part called Federal, and they constantly express to me their 
apprehensions that, should Mr. Adams be the President, he will 
administer the government on party considerations; that the 
old landmarks of party distinction will be built up ; that an 
exclusion of all participation in office will be enforced with 
regard to those who have hitherto been denominated Federals. 
I cannot for my own part believe that such a course would be 
32* 
pursued. I should trust that Mr. Adams's administration would 
be conducted on liberal and independent grounds; and that, 
regardless of names, he would not deny to talent, integrity, and 
competency a due participation. For in truth I consider all the 
old party distinctions to exist only in the name. I shall feel 
particularly obliged if you will give me your candid opinion on 
these points. 

I am with true esteem, yours, 

HENRY R. WARFIELD. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WARFIELD. 

House of Representatives, February 5, 1825. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your note of yesterday, and 
reflected on its contents, and am very willing to answer it, as 
far as I can, without incurring the danger of misleading you in 
the discharge of the delicate and important trust belonging to 
your present situation. 

I must remark in the first place, that my acquaintance with 
Mr. Adams, although friendly and respectful, I hope, on both 
sides, certainly so on mine, is not particular. I can say nothing, 
therefore, on the present occasion, by any authority derived from 
him. 

Being in a situation, however, not altogether unlike your own, 
I have naturally been anxious, like yourself, to form an opinion 
as to what would be his course of administration, in regard to 
the subject alluded to by you. For myself, I am satisfied, and 
shall give him my vote, cheerfully and steadily. And I am 
ready to say that I should not do so, if I did not believe that he 
would administer the government on liberal principles, not excluding Federalists, as such, from his regard and confidence. 

I entertain this feeling not because I wish to see any number 
of offices, or any particular office, given to those who have 
been called Federalists ; nor because there is a number of such 
individuals, or any one, that I particularly desire to see employed 
in the public service ; but because the time is come, in my opinion, when we have a right to -know whether a particular political 
name, in reference to former parties, is, of itself, to be regarded 
as cause of exclusion. 

I wish to see nothing like a portioning, parcelling out, or 
distributing offices of trust among men called by different denominations. Such a proceeding would be to acknowledge and 
to regard the existence of distinctions ; whereas my wish is, that 
distinctions should be disregarded. What I think just and reasonable to be expected, is, that by some one clear and distinct 
case, it may be shown that the distinction above alluded to does 
not operate as cause of exclusion. Some such case will doubtless present itself, and may be embraced, probably, in proper 
time and manner, if thought expedient to embrace it, without 
prejudice to the pretensions or claims of individuals. The government will then be left at liberty to call to the public service 
the best ability and the purest character. It will then be understood that the field is open, and that men are to stand according 
to their individual merits. So far as this, I think it just to expect 
the next administration to go. At any rate, it is natural to wish 
to know what may probably be expected in this regard. 

While with these sentiments, which, my dear Sir, are as strong 
in my breast as they can be in yours, I am willing to support 
Mr. Adams, and to give him my vote and influence, I must 
again remind you that my judgment is made up, not from any 
understanding or communication with him, but from general 
considerations ; from what I think I know of his liberal feelings, 
from his good sense and judgment, and from the force of circumstances. I assure you, very sincerely, that I have a full 
confidence that Mr. Adams's administration will be just and 
liberal towards Federalists as towards others ; and I need not 
say that there is no individual who would feel more pain than 
myself, if you and the rest of our friends should ever find 
reason to doubt the solidity of the foundation on which this 
confidence rests. 

NOTE. I read this, precisely as it now stands here, to Mr. 
Adams, on the evening of February 4. He said, when I had got 
through, that the letter expressed his general sentiments, and such 
as he was willing to have understood as his sentiments. There 
was one particular, however, on which he wished to make a 
remark. The letter seemed to require him, or expect him, to 
place one Federalist in the - administration. Here I interrupted 
him, and told him he had misinterpreted the writer's meaning. 
That the letter did not speak of those appointments called cabinet 
appointments particularly, but of appointments generally. With 
that understanding he said the letter contained his opinions, and 
he should feel it his duty, by some such appointment, to mark 
his desire of disregarding party distinctions. He thought either 
of them, if elected, must necessarily act liberally in this respect. 
In consequence of this conversation, I interlined, in this letter, 
the words, " in proper time and manner." I made no other 
alteration in it. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

February 4, [1825.] 

WE have a little excitement here, as you will see ; but there 
is less than there seems. Mr. Clay's ill-judged card has produced an avowal, or sort of avowal, which makes the whole 
thing look ridiculous. Mr. Kremer is a man with whom one 
would think of having a shot, about as soon as with your neighbor, Mr. Simeon Atkinson, whom he somewhat resembles. 

Mr. Adams, I believe, and have no doubt, will be chosen, 
probably the first day. 

Judge L. means to go home so as to be at Haverhill, C. C. P. 
He has received Mr. Kelly's letter, and expresses, in general 
terms, friendly feelings towards him. 

How do you come on in your various matters ? 

Yours, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, February 16, 1825. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, You are acquainted with all the particulars 
of the election. The appointments are now under consideration. 
Mr. Clay will be Secretary of State ; Mr. Southard, &c. will 
remain. For the War, De Witt Clinton, John W. Taylor, and 
Mr. McLean, the present Postmaster-General, are spoken of. 

For Treasury, Mr. Cheves. I know not now how these appointments will go ; but, perhaps, may know before evening. If there 
is any faith in man, we shall have a liberal administration. I 
think it not unlikely that if it were pressed, there might be a 
Federalist in the cabinet, but our friends are not at all satisfied 
that such a measure would be discreet at this moment. No 
doubt the true course at present is to maintain the administration, and give it a fair chance. We may be deceived, but if we 
are, it will be gross deception. 

I have strong hopes that Mr. Mason will be elected, unless 
your spring elections should go very bad. He will stand as a 
friend to the government and the new elected President, and 
his principal opponent will be e contra. In this state of the 
question causes will then act strongly which last session only 
acted feebly. Mr. Dinsmore will not be chosen, I predict. It 
will lie between Mr. Mason and Mr. Parrott. 

I see by the New Hampshire papers that the State is getting 
a little excited. I should like to hear how things look, and to 
know whether every body acquiesces in the election quietly. 

Yours, 

D. W. 

Evening, I have more to say than a P. S. will suffice for. 
Go on ; support Mr. A. Get elected if you can. There is no 
great danger of Mr. Mason; there is more time in his case. 
Every thing looks well. 

D. W. 



MR. MADISON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Montpelier, February 25, 1825. 

DEAR SIR, I must not let the session of Congress close without returning my thanks for the printed documents for which I 
was indebted, as appeared, to your friendly politeness. Though 
they find their way to me through the daily vehicles, there is an 
advantage in possessing them in a more compact as well as less 
perishable form. Among the characteristic attributes of our 
government is its frankness in giving publicity to proceedings, 
elsewhere locked up as arcana of state ; and it will always be 
happy when they will so well bear the light ; or rather, so much 
contribute to the reputation of our own country and the edification of others. 

Be pleased to accept, Sir, assurances of my high esteem and 
cordial respect. 

JAMES MADISON. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 
(EXTRACT.) 

Washington, March 15, [1825.] 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I expected a letter from you to-day, with 
regard to the election. As it has not come, I infer that you 
have little good to communicate ; an inference in which I am 
strengthened by seeing the disagreeable result in Portsmouth. 

I still believe that this is but the last gasp of selfishness and 
party, and that better days are coming. At any rate, he who 
loses only an office, loses nothing that he need break his heart 
about. I should have been glad that we should have been here 
a year or two together, but it is not essential to the happiness 

of either of us. 

******* 

I am busy, very busy, in the court, and shall be to the moment 
of my departure. 

Yours truly, as always, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO JUDGE STORY. 

April 8, 1825. 

MY DEAR SIR, I enclose you a letter I received yesterday, for 
you, from Mr. Palfrey. 

You will have heard of the bloodless duel ; I regret it very 
much ; but the conduct of Mr. Randolph has been such that I 
suppose it was thought that it could not longer be tolerated. 
We have had something like it in the House of Representatives, 
but not so bad. In truth, the manner of debate adopted by 
certain gentlemen in both Houses, is without a parallel in the 
history of this country. 

We have done nothing since you left. The bankruptcy has 
not been called up. The Senate do little or nothing. Mr. Randolph occupies about three hours every day, be the subject what 
it will ; and then the Senate adjourns. I know not what will be 
the result, but public business has come pretty much to a stand. 
I intend to report a bankrupt bill to our House this week. 

The Senate has agreed to Rowan's amendment to the judiciary 
bill. I presume we shall reject it ; and if the Senate adhere, I 
trust the bill will be lost. If it passes, I think the appointments 
will be satisfactory. We hope to finish Panama in our House 
by Wednesday. 

The Massachusetts claim has been discussed. Some heats 
were created, but in general the claim has gained much by the 
discussion. Almost all, or quite all, of the active opposition, 
has come from a certain quarter, and has been made, no doubt, 
with a view to certain effects. 

Mrs. Webster desires her remembrance ; and your friend 
Edward is particular in his love to Judge Story. 
Yours, always truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. ISAAC P. DAVIS. 

April 11, 1825. 

DEAR SIR, I shall be very glad to get something done for 
your cordage if I can. If Mr. De Wolfe's bill comes down 
from the Senate, we will do what we can for it. 

I have grown very tired, and want to go home. I cannot 
think of failing to hold the Sandwich court, at the usual season. 

Mrs. Webster, and the children, and Jeanette are all well, and 
all send their love to Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Davis, and yourself and 
boys. Ned, however, says he has sent so much love to every 
body, that he has none left. 

Notwithstanding the mildness of the winter, March has been 
cold, and the spring is backward. I hope we shall rise by the 
10th or 12th of May. I know not what to say about the tariff, 
except that there is an increased probability that it will not pass, 
even through our House. There are members who are influenced by their instructions, or afraid of their constituents ; otherwise there would be, I have no doubt, a decided majority for 
giving the bill its repose upon the table. 

Yours always, 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO CHANCELLOR KENT. 

Boston, May 23, 1825. 

MY DEAR SIR, You know Judge Smith of New Hampshire, 
at least in his public and professional character. I wish to 
recommend him to you, on the score of private worth and social 
qualities. There are few men in the world I think more to 
your taste. 

I entertain for him the highest regard, and true gratitude. 
When I came to the bar, he was chief justice of the State. It 
was a day of "the gladsome light" of Jurisprudence. His 
friends, and I was one of them, thought he must be made governor. 

For this office we persuaded him to leave the bench, and that 
same " gladsome light " cheered us no longer. Ponto nox incubat atra. I need not continue Virgil, nor say how the east wind, 
and the north wind, and the stormy south wind, all rushed out 
together, and what a shipwreck they made both of law and 
parties. 

Judge Smith has since occasionally practised the law, but for 
some years has lived entirely, I believe, with his books and his 
friends. He knows every thing about New England, having 
studied much its history and its institutions ; and as to the law, 
he knows so much more of it than I do, or ever shall, that I forbear to speak on that point. 

Indeed, I am ashamed to find myself commending to you one 
so well known to you and all other good men ; but hearing he 
was about to visit your city, I could not resist the temptation 
afforded by the occasion of mentioning my regard for him, and 
of recommending him to the regard and friendship of yourself 
and friends. 

Yours, always truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. GEORGE BLAKE. 

Niagara Falls, July 15, 1825. 

MY DEAR MRS. BLAKE, It is one of my most agreeable duties, 
before leaving this place, to write to you, to tell you how much 
we have admired the great spectacle here, and how sincerely we 
have lamented every hour that you were not with us, to partake 
and increase our pleasure. This is the third day of our being 
here ; the weather has been uniformly fine, and we have seen 
the Falls under all advantages. You have of course read many 
accounts of this Fall, to which no account can do justice ; and 
although I am disposed to say something on the subject, I expect 
no better success than others who have undertaken the description. 

The Niagara River, at the moment of leaving Lake Erie, is one 
mile in width. It runs nearly directly north with a rapidity 
of six miles and a half an hour. We crossed it from the east 
side to the west, at the village of Black Rock, two miles and a 
half below the end of the lake. Here its current is less rapid, 
running probably about four miles an hour. This river, being 
fed frbm such vast reservoirs above, is subject to little variation 
in the height of its waters. Its annual rise does not exceed a 
foot ; and it may give some idea of the immense distance through 
which its waters have flowed, to mention that the spring " fresh" 
is not felt here till July. It is now just about the time of high 
water. It is truly a noble river ; rapid, but smooth and glassy ; 
always full, but never overflowing : 

" Tho' deep, yet clear ; tho' gentle, yet not dull ; 
" Strong, without rage ; without o'erflowing, full." 

We passed down its western shore, along the bank close 'to 
the water's edge, and over a level road. Lake Erie is 330 feet 
higher than Lake Ontario ; but in descending the river from Lake 
Erie, one perceives no very considerable or great descent, 
although the current is all the way rapid, till we get nearly 
down to the Falls. A little below the village of Black Rock, 
perhaps about five miles from Lake Erie, the river divides into 
two channels, forming a large island in the centre, called Grand 
Isle, about twelve miles long, and in some places six or seven 
broad. This island terminates, and the two channels unite

PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF 

again, just at the head of what are called The Rapids, a mile or 
a mile and a half above the great Falls. These Rapids are a 
succession of cascades, spreading over the whole river, of different and various heights and appearances, rendering the whole 
breadth of the stream, which is here not less than two miles, 
white with foam. They would form a fine object, if there were 
nothing near which called the attention another way. Midway of these Rapids is Goat Island, which divides the river into 
two unequal parts, about one third in breadth being on the 
Eastern, or American side, and two thirds on the Western, or 
British. This island runs down to the very brink of the Falls, 
and there terminates in a perpendicular precipice, or wall of 
rock, which is part of the same great declivity over which the 
river pours. This island thus divides the river, so that it falls 
over the precipice in two sheets. The length of the Fall on the 
American side is estimated at 380 yards, then the distance 
across the end of Goat Island, 330 yards, and the length of the 
fall on the British side, 700 yards. On the east side of Goat 
Island, is another small island ; I know not its name, but it is 
separated from Goat Island by twenty or thirty yards of water, 
which pours over here and makes a beautiful object by itself, 
being wholly separate and distinct from the two great Falls. 
The Fall is reckoned to be highest on the American side, being 
there 165 feet ; and on the British side 150. Vastly the greatest 
portion of water, I should think three fourths or even more, 
runs over on the British side. 

I have seen no description which correctly represents the line 
of these Falls. I, also, shall fail in attempting to describe it to 
you ; but, nevertheless, I will make the attempt. But, in the 
first place, you must remember that the land, or country, does 
not descend, or fall off, at the Falls. From the end of Lake 
Erie to Lewiston, which is seven miles below the Falls, the surface of the earth is uncommonly level ; but here, at Lewiston, is 
a great descent, from the level of Lake Erie to that of Lake 
Ontario. Therefore, as you come along down the river from 
Lake Erie, when you get to the Falls, the river seems to fall 
away from your feet, and to pitch right down into the earth. 
Many miles before you reach the Falls, you see the mist or 
spray rising up like a cloud. But this does not seem to be rising from the earth into the air, so much as from the centre of 

the earth to the surface. It appears to be coming out of the 
ground. From the bottom of the Falls to Lewiston, seven 
miles, the whole channel of the river is one great trough, 100 or 
150 feet deep, with sides of perpendicular rock. This has given 
currency to the opinion that the Falls were once seven miles 
lower down than they now are ; and that the force of the water, 
in time has worn away the rocks and forced the Falls back to 
their present position. 

Now, as to the line of the Falls, as it appears to me, at the 
moment of writing this, from the upper rooms in Forsyth's 
Hotel. The American Fall may be said to be straight. There 
are some little inequalities in the line, but on the whole it is very 
regular ; next comes the little island, near Goat Island, a little 
advanced beyond the great American Fall ; then the little 
separate Cascade, a little more advanced ; then the end of Goat 
Island, about on a line with the little Cascade ; and then the 
great British Fall. The line of this Fall, leaving the point of 
Goat Island, advances, makes a bend forward, a sort of gentle 
sweep or graceful arch, perhaps two hundred yards in length, 
then retreats again till it gets a little further back than the point 
of the island, where it set out, and making now an angle or 
rather a curve, it goes downward, and across the river, and joins 
the western bank at Table Rock, which is a good deal below 
the end of Goat Island. This last-mentioned bend or curve in 
the line of the Falls, is commonly called the Horseshoe ; for no 
reason, that I know of, except that a horseshoe is a ready figure to 
express any curving line. On the earth at the bottom of the 
Falls, among the rocks, I succeeded, with a walking-stick six 
feet long, in drawing pretty accurately the line of the Falls. I 
cannot do it on paper. The enclosed is as near as I can come. 

But I wish now to state something which I have seen mentioned in no printed account, but which is absolutely essential 
to any correct understanding of the subject. At the very foot 
of the Falls the whole river turns suddenly to the right ; and runs 
off in that direction. So that the water which falls over on the 
British side, runs along at the foot of the American Fall. The 
American Fall faces, exactly and completely, the western bank 
of the river. As you walk along down from the Table Rock, 
you have the American Fall precisely in front. Just at the bottom of the American Fall is the ferry. We land at the very 
edge of this Fall. But, on the other side, we set out near half 
a mile below the Table Rock. The whole, I think, may be 
understood, by bearing in mind that, at the very Fall, the river 
makes a sudden turn to the right, so that all the Fall, out of 
the Horseshoe, and especially the American Fall, fronts not 
down the river, but directly across it. 

I am afraid, after all, my dear lady, that you are little the 
wiser for this attempt at description. I can draw nothing ; but 
if I find you in the. dark on the subject when I get home, I 
think, with a piece of shingle and a penknife, I may explain my 

ideas. 

The Falls are seen from many different points, and the views 
are very various. I write this, in an upper parlor, in Forsyth's 
Hotel, on the Canada side ; the entire line of the Falls is in 
my view, but the whole is below me. The view, however, of 
the great curve, or Horseshoe, is very good from this spot ; I 
think as perfect as from any point. I can see the water as it 
pours over, nearly all round the semicircle. The sheet has all 
appearances of being very thick ; probably, it is thought, fifteen 
or twenty feet. Its surface, as it falls over, is streaked with alternate white, caused by the foam, and the most brilliant emerald. 
In descending to get a nearer view, we go down a steep hill, 
or what may be called the upper part of the bank, about 100 
feet This is about as much descent as the river makes in the 
Rapids above the Falls, so that, having come down this distance, 
we are on the level of the water at the head of the Falls. Here 
are several acres of flat land, between the foot of this hill and 
the water's edge, thickly covered with trees and shrubbery. A 
planked walk leads along towards the river, and I do not 
know that my attention has been more strongly arrested 
by any thing than by the view which occurs, as we walk 
along this path. The water is seen rather suddenly and unexpectedly through a vista, or avenue of trees. It is nearly, 
and seems to be quite, on your own level. Great and unbroken ridges of billows come hastening and bounding along, 
and rush forward to the precipice, which, as yet, the spectator 
does not see. The magnitude, the strength, and the hurry of 
the mighty stream, create deep and instant consternation. Proceeding onward, and turning a little down the stream, we come 
to the water's edge, at the top of the Fall. The water is even 

with the bank, and we can wash our hands in safety in the 
river. Going along, now, on the Table Rock, we have what is 
generally thought the best view of the whole Falls. 

Fronting us is the American Fall, and the little Cascade ; 
further to the right Goat Island, and the commencement by it 
of the British Fall ; and further to our right is the great circular 
Fall, or Horseshoe, which will hardly allow the eyes to be 
withdrawn long enough to look at any thing else. You may 
stand by the water just where it falls off, and if your head does 
not swim, you may proceed to the brink of Table Rock, and 
look down into the gulf beneath. This is all foam, and froth, 
and spray. As you stand here, it looks as if all the water of 
the globe was collected round this circle, and pouring down 
here into the centre of the earth. As we stood to-day at noon, 
on the projecting point of Table Rock, we looked over into this 
abyss, and far beneath our feet, arched over this tremendous 
aggregate of water, foam, and vapor, we saw a perfect and 
radiant rainbow. This ornament of heaven does not seem out 
of place, in being half-way up the sheet of the glorious cataract 
It looked as if the sides themselves paid homage to this stupendous work of nature. From Table Rock, or a little further down, 
a winding staircase is constructed, down which we descend 
from the level of Table Rock, 95 feet. This brings us to the 
bottom of the perpendicular rock, and from this place we descend 50 or 60 feet further, over large fragments of rock and 
other substance, down to the edge of the river. We went this 
afternoon a little lower down the river than the upper staircase, 
almost indeed down to the ferry, and getting out on a rock, in 
the edge of the river, we thought the view of the whole Falls 
the best we had obtained. If, at the bottom of the staircase, instead of descending further, we choose to turn to the right, and 
go up the stream, keeping close at the foot of the Table Rock, 
or the perpendicular bank, we soon get to the foot of the Fall, 
and approach the edge of the falling mass. It is easy to go in 
behind, for a little distance, between the falling water and the 
rock over which it is precipitated ; this cannot be done, however, without being entirely wet. From within this cavern there 
issues a wind, occasionally very strong, and bringing with it 
such showers and torrents of spray, that we are soon as wet as 
if we had come over the Falls with the water. As near to the 
33* 
Fall in this place as you can well come, is perhaps the spot on 
which the mind is most deeply impressed with the whole scene. 
Over our heads hangs a fearful rock, projecting out like an unsupported piazza. Before us is a hurly-burly of waters, too 
deep to be fathomed, too irregular to be described, shrouded in 
too much mist to be clearly seen. Water, vapor, foam, and the 
atmosphere, are all mixed up together, in sublime confusion. 
By our side, down xiomes this world of green and white waters, 
and pours into the invisible abyss. A steady, unvarying, lowtoned roar, thunders incessantly upon our ears ; as we look up, we 
think some sudden disaster has opened the seas, and that all 
their floods are coming down upon us at once ; but we soon 
recollect, that what we see is not a sudden or violent exhibition, 
but the permanent and uniform character of the object which 
we contemplate. There, the grand spectacle has stood, for centuries, from the creation even, as far as we know, without 
change. From the beginning, it has shaken, as it now does, the 
earth and the air; and its unvarying thunder existed before 
there were human ears to hear it. Reflections like these, on 
the duration and permanency of this grand object, naturally 
arise, and contribute much to the deep feeling which the whole 
scene produces. We cannot help being struck with a sense of 
the insignificance of man and all his works, compared with what 
is before us. 

" Lo ! where it comes, like an eternity, 

As if to sweep down all things in its track ! " 

I shall not, my dear Mrs. Blake, attempt any full description 
of this scene ; and still less to represent its whole effect on the 
mind. It must be seen ; it is something which speaks to the 
senses ; no description can set it forth. 

The ferry, as I believe I have already stated, leaves the British 
shore near half a mile below the Fall on that side, and passes 
over to the American shore just at the lower edge of the Fall 
there. The view of the whole Fall, from the boat, is very perfect ; as much so, perhaps, as from any spot, From the landingplace on the American side, a new and well-built staircase 
brings us up, close along by the falling water, to the top of the 
bank. We there walk along up the river, and see that the 
American branch is not only less wide but much less deep than 
the British. The Cascades, however, are beautiful on this side. 

About half a mile above the Fall a good bridge is thrown over 
to Goat Island. This is a charming place, containing sixty or 
seventy acres of ground covered with large and handsome trees. 
We may walk all round it, and see the E-apids to great advantage, in both divisions of the stream. Its lower end also presents 
some good views of the Falls. We see here that the American 
Fall is not so straight as it seems from the other side, but has 
various projections and indentations. The little stream, running 
at the east corner of Goat Island, and forming, as it falls, the 
little Cascade, is quite accessible, and might almost be waded 
over. In the morning the bow is very fine, from this point. I 
saw one this morning caused by the spray from the American 
Fall. It seemed to spring up from the little house in which the 
ferry-man lives, on the British side, and swelling up along the 
Bank it came down again near the Table Rock. The depth of 
the water in the river below the Falls, is very great. It is said 
to have been lately sounded, by public authority, where the ferry 
is, and found to be more than 300 feet. It would seem to be 
dangerous, where the boat passes, but I believe it is not so. The 
water is a good deal agitated, but it does not run with any current too strong to be encountered. 

The rock over which the waters of the Cataract fall is limestone. No doubt the same sort of rock underlies this whole 
country, for a great extent. The banks of the river, and the 
wall over which the Falls run, show great regularity of formation. In building the stairs, on the American side, lately, the 
workmen have blown away the rock in the side of the bank, for 
some distance, to make room for the staircase, and here the successive strata are seen, generally from six inches to three feet 
thick, laid up with the precision of masonry. 

We have been here now the whole or a part of three days ; 
and although our eyes are not satisfied with seeing, yet some 
of us complain of weary limbs, from walking about so much, 
and going down and climbing up the banks so often. 

We shall leave probably to-morrow. It will not be without 
pain that I part from the Falls. 

And now, my dear Mrs. Blake, let me repeat how much we 
lament that you and your husband have not been with us on 
this visit. Our whole party desire their best respects to you 
both. Mrs. Webster particularly sends her love to you, and 
thinks you will deserve well, if your patience holds out through 
this long letter. However that may be, I assure you I have 
had much pleasure in writing it, and, if I could think of any 
thing more to say on the subject, should write still longer. But 
be not alarmed, I am through ; and have only to add that I 
am, most affectionately, Yours, always, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. GEORGE BLAKE. 

Niagara Falls, July 17, 1825. 

MY DEAR MRS. BLAKE, Before leaving here I wish to say an 
additional word or two on the subject of the Falls, by way of 
explaining or correcting some things in my letter. 

In the first place I said, I think, that Goat Island was midway 
of the Rapids. This may lead to an erroneous opinion. The 
Rapids in fact, commence precisely at the head of Goat Island, 
We may stand at the head of the island, and look up and see 
a mild and even surface. The shore is level to the water, and 
we may amuse ourselves by throwing in sticks, and speculating 
on their course, either to the British or American Fall. 

In the next place, I am convinced that I over-estimated both 
the breadth of the stream and the amount of water on the 
American side. I think the stream is not more than one fourth 
as wide as on the other side ; and the proportion of water still 
less. 

In the last place, when saying that the rock over which the 
river falls is limestone, I ought to have added that this limestone 
constituted but a part of the bank or wall. The first, or upper 
fifty feet, is limestone, lying in regular strata, as I have mentioned ; the next hundred feet is a soft slate stone, which yields 
in some measure to the action of air, frost, and water. It comes 
off in small parcels, and is easily picked out of the sides of the 
bank. I pulled off a piece six feet long, as straight as a walking stick, and not much larger. As these pieces fall down they 
become pulverized, and turn to a sort of earth. The wearing 
away of this slate stone necessarily lets fall the limestone from 
above. Table Rock is the projecting platform of limestone. 

The slate stone underneath it is already worn away a great 
depth into the bank ; and Table Rock will one day doubtless 
precipitate itself into the river. 

At the bottom of this course of slate stone, just about even 
with the surface of the river, commences another kind of stone. 
It seems to be a red sandstone, lying in very thin layers. It is 
of so bright a color that it may sometimes be seen, forming the 
bottom of the river, where the water is very deep. 

You will excuse me, my dear Mrs. Blake, for adding these 
remarks to my long and tedious letter. It is doubtful whether 
I shall ever see the Falls again. You will be here at some 
time, and I hope soon. I will not promise myself, that, as you 
view the scene, you will find any great correspondence between 
the view itself and my account of it ; but I trust you will call to 
mind those who have been over the spot before you, and be 
willing to remember even this unsuccessful attempt to describe 
it to you by 

Your affectionate and faithful, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. We set out this morning for home. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 

Utica, July 8, 1825. 

DEAR WILLIAM, You perceive that our flight is not very 
rapid. We arrived here evening before last, at the moment of 
the arrival of your letter, which, you may be assured, it gave us 
no small pleasure to receive. Yesterday we went to visit Trenton Falls, a famous lion, fifteen miles from this place. It is a 
succession of cascades, or water falls, in a stream called " West 
Canada Creek," for a mile and a half or two miles. On either 
side, for the whole distance, is a wall of rock nearly perpendicular, and varying in height from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet. The passage to view the Falls is at the 
bottom of this bank of rocks, and at the very edge of the torrent. 
It is difficult, and in some places I think dangerous ; there are 
however chains fastened in the rock in the most critical spots, to 
hold on by. Our ladies accomplished the object of getting a 
full view, although it rained like a torrent, and to have fallen 
over would not have soaked them more thoroughly. We find 
all the inns, and all the roads, full of travellers, many of them 
from Boston. This country is all alive ; it is new, growing, and 
highly excited. A universal competition prevails in every 
thing; carriages, public houses, boats, all much more abundant 
than would seem strictly necessary, and all competitors. We 
leave this morning at nine, if our party should wake up by that 
time ; I intend going forty or fifty miles to-day. 

It will be Sunday before we reach Canandaigua, where we 
hope to find some of your'letters. We often wish some of our 
friends were with us, when we see the great sights. We dined 
on very fine trout, caught in the Falls, where some are found 
weighing five pounds. We have heard of nothing very good 
in Mr. Blake's particular line. 

I do not know whether Mrs. Webster has any thing to send, 
but love. I presume she is dreaming about you all. Give my 
own to the children, and to Mr. and Mrs. Blake, and believe me, 

Truly yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 

Niagara Falls, American side, July 16, 1825. 

MY DEAR WILLIAM, I believe Mrs. Webster wrote you from 
Buffalo. We found letters from you at Utica, Canandaigua, Buffalo, and two here. At Canandaigua, we got them Monday morning, the moment of our departure. I believe we have received 
all that you have written. We came down from Buffalo on 
Wednesday, on the west side, stayed at Forsyth's until yesterday, when we came across to this place. We have all been 
greatly delighted with the Falls; they have exceeded our expectations. I have written a long and poor account of the 
matter to Mrs. Blake. I presume you will find twenty others, 
much more full and accurate, though I do not remember to 
have seen any description, which I now think just. Many 
people are disappointed at not finding the Falls appear higher. 
This is very natural ; one hundred and sixty five feet, when 
applied to a great object, is no very vast height of itself, and the 

great breadth of the Fall, the magnitude of the volume of water, 
and the circumstance that you generally see it first from the top, 
all conspire to make you incredulous as to the reputed height. 
But there is no mistake as to the height. A line dropped from 
Table Rock to where it strikes below, will convince any one. 
Or, when we are down at the water's edge, we look up to the 
bottom of the staircase, then compare that distance with the 
height of the staircase, which we know to be ninety-five feet, we 
shall be satisfied that the distance through which the water 
falls has not been overstated. 

We have examined the Falls from all accessible points of 
view. Yesterday afternoon, we crossed from this side over to 
Goat Island, on a bridge, and had a fine ramble. Here is a small 
village, and on the rapids above and below the bridge, are some 
little mills. By the enclosed, you will see that the proprietors 
of the shores on this side would be glad to dispose of the water 
power of Niagara Falls, what little there is of it, to " Eastern 
capitalists." 

To-day we have made a ride down the river two or three 
miles, to a place called the " Whirlpool." It is a fearful eddy ; 
we look upon it from a height, I suppose, of two hundred and 
fifty feet. No man can approach it; the whole river is in a 
whirl. It is said that trees and logs, getting in there, will sometimes be carried round for days and weeks before they get out 
of the eddy. They are tossed about in all directions, sometimes 
standing up perpendicularly, and going down, and reappearing. 
I regretted that I had not a glass, that I might better have 
examined this great boiling caldron. Just below this is another place, called the " Devil's Hole." It is a kind of cut, made 
into the bank, on this side. In the French war, a party of English were stationed on the bank here to guard the portage round 
the Falls ; they were surprised by a party of French and Indians, all surrounded, and pushed off. Of course they were all 
killed, except one drummer ; he caught by his belt, upon some 
limb of a tree, running out from the bank, or as some say, fell 
on his drum. At any rate he survived the fall, and, as I understand, was living in Canada ten years ago. 

But enough of Niagara and story-telling. It has taken us so 
long a time to get here, and must take us so much to get home, 
that I despair of Canada. I fancy we shall go to Rochester, 
Utica, Lake George, Burlington, home ; but this is only my 
nrivat* opinion. We shall set off East to-morrow, and shall 
soon determine our course. I will write to you again, say from 
TWhpster Yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 

p S I am going to try to wet a line at the foot of the Falls. 
Saturday 5, p. M., and all well; 23 days out, no news; calicoes wet and heavy. 



MR. MADISON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Montpelier, August 12, 1825. 

DEAR SIR, I have received the copy of your oration delivered 
at Bunker Hill, on the occasion presented by the 17th of June 
last. It merits all the praise which has been bestowed on it; 
and I tender you many thanks for the pleasure it has afforded 
me. With assurances of my distinguished consideration, 

I am yours truly, 

JAMES MADISON. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Boston, October 13, 1825. 

DEAR CHARLES, Your Mr. Perkins called here this morning, 
at a moment when I happened to be so much occupied with 
gentlemen in the office, that I could not even read your letter 
through. Unfortunately, his engagements were so stringent, 
that he could not flatter me with a hope of another call tomorrow morning. If any auspicious changes in his affairs 
should enable him to call again, or if your next agent should be 
willing to wait till I could catch my breath even, I shall endeavor to comply with your wishes. If no other arrangement 
occur, draw on me for the sum, say $500, at three days' sight, 
and as soon as convenient send me such a note as you propose. 

I had true pleasure in reading your Bible Society speech. Certainly I think it the best, far the best, which I have seen. We 

hear much of your Commencement oration. When are we to 
see it ? Print it by all means ; especially if it be half so good as 
report makes it. The tendencies of a college life are doubtless 
drowsy ; and you deserve therefore the more praise for showing 
signs of life. It is not always that a pulsation manifests itself 
in those sons of leisure, who, having no absolute engagements 
for the future, refer to the blank of to-morrow whatever might 
have made to-day something better than a blank. 

Yours most truly always, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO DR. WARREN. 

November 17, 1825. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am highly pleased with the idea of a gymnasium; it is a subject which has often occupied my thoughts, 
and in relation to which it has appeared to me that the fashion 
of the times needs to be changed. Those who have the charge 
of education seem sometimes to forget that the body is a part 
of the man. The number of young men who leave our colleges, 
emulous indeed, and learned, but with pale faces and narrow 
chests, is truly alarming. The common rustic amusements 
hung about our literary institutions for a long time ; but they 
at length seem to have been entirely abandoned, and nothing, at 
least nothing useful, has succeeded them. If it be desirable that 
there should be cultivated intellect, it is equally so, as far as 
this world is concerned, that there should be also a sound body 
to hold it in. 

I shall most gladly assist in your endeavors ; thinking that I 
do some service when I aid any measure calculated to enforce 
on the rising generation a sense of the invaluable advantages of 
temperance and exercise. 

I am, dear Sir, most truly yours, 

DAN'L WEBSTER.

PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF 

LAFAYETTE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

La Grange, December 28, 1825. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have had the pleasure to receive your letter 
by the Reverend Mr. Palfrey, of whose church in Boston I am 
one of the oldest parishioners ; nor have I been a little surprised 
after I had left him in his pulpit, to see him on a sudden entering my room in Paris. He has since favored us with a visit at 
La Grange, and went to Geneva on his way to Italy. 

You are by this time at Washington, with many others of 
my friends, occupied in the day with concerns most interesting 
to me, and spending every evening in those parties which I 
have happily enjoyed last winter. I wish I could again, some 
time in the session, share with you in that most pleasing way of 
life ; and this not being the case, my best mode of existence, on 
this side of the Atlantic, is to be on my farm with my family 
and kind visitors ; yet I will be obliged by the middle of January to go to the city for two or three months, with my children 
and grandchildren, however partial they are, along with me, 
to our retirement of La Grange. Here we have been threatened 
with the greater calamity by the illness of one of my granddaughters; she is now recovered. The less happy Mr. Clay 
has been more severely treated in his parental fondness. 

From every quarter you will hear the great news of the death 
of the Emperor Alexander ; from each quarter a different story 
about the mode of his exit ; the most natural in that family is 
murder. How it may affect the concerns of general freedom is 
the important point. Nothing worse can be apprehended in a 
state of things, when the main object with every European, 
continental, and insular cabinet, is to stifle the spirit of freedom 
in this, and to introduce, if they can, aristocracy and monarchy 
in the better hemisphere. Should they quarrel together, something nr\v may come out of it. It is said the King of Portugal 
cannot live long ; let Don Pedro be sent to succeed him, and 
Brazil be raised to the dignity of a Commonwealth. At Panama, 
good and candid advice will be very seasonable. So it would 
be in Greece, whose situation appears to be now better than 
it was reported to be some weeks ago, and where the jealousies 
between Russia and Great Britain may give rise to new com
binations. I hope the two frigates building at New York will 
be gone before you receive this letter. I wish our steamboat 
plan may have succeeded. There is in their moral influence 
upon the political civilization of mankind, something very gratifying and honorable to the character of the United States. 

My brother officers of Massachusetts and Connecticut have 
communicated to me a proposed application to Congress relative to the pension law and their pecuniary situation, of which 
you are the better informed, as you will probably be one of its 
supporters. You know, my dear friend, how far I am from 
availing myself of my happy situation, honored as I am with a 
precious share of popular affection, to launch into political 
improprieties. But in this particular case it seems to me that 
the very favors of which I have been the object, one of them 
peculiarly added to my community of services and fraternity 
with those gallant and beloved companions in arms, entitle me 
to express more of my opinion and wishes, than it would be 
proper to do in any other instance. I took the liberty to write 
to the President and the Secretary of War, as I do now to you, 
my dear Sir; and indeed, the more bounteous Congress have 
been to me, the more happy I will be if they do something in 
explanation of the bill to confer additional comfort, where so 
much merit is acknowledged. 

I am eagerly waiting for news from Washington. The President's " Message," the Greek business, the resolutions respecting my excellent friend Colonel Monroe's statement, combine 
to make me very anxious to hear and read. Be pleased, my 
dear Sir, to present my affectionate respects to Mrs. Webster, 
Mr. Boyd and families, to Mr. Everett, to all friends about you. 
My son begs to be remembered, and so would Le Vasseur, if he 
was at La Grange. 

I don't know what business had the ministerial papers of 
England to encourage the French government not to pay the 
American claims. Madame De la Rue and her husband, my 
former aid-de-camp, came to see me, and was very desirous to 
obtain a declaration from Congress, stating what you consider, 
I think, as a matter of fact, that the President is entitled to 
make their claim an object for negotiation with the French 
cabinet along with the business of American reclamation, when 
they cannot be effectuated. 
Adieu, my dear Sir, believe me forever your affectionate, 

grateful friend, 

LAFAYETTE. 

P. S. Your Bunker Hill has been translated in French and 
other languages, to the very great profit of European readers. 
My gallant and eloquent friend, Foy, has lived long enough to 

enjoy it. 

Permit me confidentially to mention an object for which I 
hope there will be no occasion. It came round to me that 
some friends had contemplated moving Congress for an appropriation, relative to a compensation due by me to the proprietors 
of The Cadmus, which they have hitherto declined to receive, 
as it would be in fact paying more money on my account. You 
must feel the impropriety of the proposal, and will of course 
prevent it, if it did chance to be made. But would consider it 

as an additional service, if Mr. W may be prevailed upon 

by our common friends to accept from me this debt to him. 



MR. WEBSTER TO JUDGE STORY. 

Washington, December 31, 1825. 

DEAR SIR, By direction of our committee I brought in today a resolution for a bankrupt law. I think there is some 
chance for it if we get a good bill. I must call it up on Monday, the 16th instant, by which time I hope to hear from you. 
What say you to the following : 

" Resolved, that all merchants, &c. (using the common terms,) 
committing an act of bankruptcy, shall be liable to a commission, at suit of creditors, &c. ; and that other persons, not 
merchants and traders, who shall file a voluntary declaration of 
insolvency, shall be subject to the law," &c. 

Unless we make some provision for the non-traders, we cannot possibly carry along the bill. 

I shall call up the judiciary bill to-morrow. I know not what 
will be its fate. I was for two judges, but a majority of the committee were for three. A great majority in committee were 
against separating your court from the circuit. I shall consent 

to it, if nothing else can be done, but shall give my feelings on 
the subject fully to-morrow. I hope I shall commit no contempt. 

An opposition is evidently brewing. It will show itself on the 
Panama question. When that discussion comes on, you will 
probably see reason to think that the government has decided 
wisely about the mission. The nominations are yet before the 
Senate. As soon as they are confirmed, if they shall be so, a 
proposition will be made in our House for an appropriation, 
and then we shall have a grand debate. 

My health is good, never better, not having yet worked off 
the strength obtained at Niagara, and at Sandwich. Mrs. 
Webster sends a great deal of love to Mrs. Story and yourself. 
Pray let me hear from you by the 16th. 

Yours truly, DAN'L WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 29, 182G. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, Nearly two months of the session have 
passed away, without producing much of particular interest. I 
think I have never known a session, in which there seemed 
more reluctance to go early to work. Indeed, there is not a 
great deal that is absolutely necessary to be done. 

The judiciary bill will probably pass the Senate, as it left our 
House. There will be no difficulty in finding perfectly safe 
men for the new appointments. The contests on those constitutional questions in the West, have made men fit to be judges. 

After a week's squabbling about the appropriation bills, I 
suppose we shall have a debate of a week on Mr. McDuffie's 
constitution-amendment-motion. Probably the subject will end 
with the debate. The Panama mission is yet undecided in the 
Senate. It is supposed to furnish some plausible grounds for 
opposition, and there will be a rallying of forces on the occasion. 
We do not know, of course, what takes place in the secret sessions of the Senate, but it is understood that the subject is to 
be debated next Wednesday. 

I have no doubt the mission will be approved, and the nomi34* 
nations confirmed by a large majority. Perhaps it might have 
been desirable, that the new government should have held no 
Congress, or should not have invited the presence of ministers 
of the United States ; but when the correspondence is seen, it 
will probably be generally thought that the President decided 
right. We expect to have the matter discussed in our House 
publicly, on the question of the appropriation to pay the 
expense. 

The bankrupt bill will be introduced, and has a fair chance of 
being passed. I hope it will be first brought into the Senate, but 
if it does not soon make its appearance there, I shall begin the 
business in the House. The late revision of the English system 
has greatly facilitated our labors. 

The political aspect of things here is well enough. A good 
degree .of civility and kind feeling prevails, and I cannot help 
hoping that time and event may abate the malignity that still 
rages in some quarters. I have not had the pleasure of making 
the acquaintance of your new members from New Hampshire. 
There are so many new members in the House, it requires a 
great while to find them out. The new senator keeps pretty 
close ; a little inclined to oppose, as is thought, but perhaps not 
quite certain how it might turn out. I believe Mr. Bell is 
sincerely friendly to the President, and much more inclined to 
act and think generously and liberally than he has heretofore 
been supposed to be. 

I seldom see a New Hampshire paper, and hear nothing of 
New Hampshire politics. If there be any thing passing worth 
telling of, please write about it. 

As to domestic matters, we get on tolerably well. Fletcher 
lives at Dr. Sewall's, and goes to school. The other two children are with us. Julia has been a little unwell, but is better, 
and the rest of us have good health. We beg to give our 
love to your wife and children, and hope to hear from you. 

Yours always, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



LAFAYETTE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

La Grange, March 12, 1826. 

MY DEAR SIR, While you are on the duties of congressional 
business, I make some escapes from town to my farm, and, 
having no public task to perform, I am active in the thought of 
what is probably going on in Washington, in my enjoyment 
of usual prosperity ; and in my anticipations of every circumstance which can maintain and forward the felicity and dignity 
of the United States, placed as they are at the head of human 
civilization, their moral influence cannot but be confidently 
exerted for the instruction and happiness of mankind. 

The arrival of Mr. Palfrey has been welcomed with the feelings of a faithful parishioner and friend. He is now in Italy, 
and I much wish he may embark from France, as he will then 
favor us with another visit at La Grange. 

By the last accounts from Washington, the Panama Tnission 
was still debated in the Senate. Sorry I would be to think the 
former Spanish colonies, now independent and well disposed 
republics, have been deprived of the only honest advice they can 
expect. On none of the European governments can they 
depend. They, all of them, are determined to favor a creeping 
of monarchy and aristocracy into those countries, and the Court 
of Brazil is by them considered as the head-quarters of their 
plots, corruption, and intrigues. Nothing, of course, seems to 
me more desirable, than to see the United States maintain their 
hold in the confidence of the Southern Republic, and the Empire of Brazil converted into a good democratic commonwealth. 

Is it not very amusing to find, that while the Russian autocrat was watching, advising, lecturing about the possibility of 
plots and insurrection wherever he had no right to meddle, he 
was himself surrounded with a vast conspiracy of his own 
nobles and favorites ? It is to me a daily diversion to pursue 
the contrast between a presidential election, under a representative democracy, and the succession to the throne, in the bosom 
of the most complete monarchical good order, supported by all 
the blessings of aristocracy, without the encumbrance of any 
thing like a nation. It seems that jealousy and selfishness have 
worked the Western governments, and Austria herself, to a 
degree, into a better mood with respect to the Greeks than 
could have been produced by a sense of honor, compassion, or 
Christianity. As they are afraid to see Emperor Nicholas carried 
away by his troops into a war against the Ottoman empire, 
which might give him a supremacy over the people and the 
territory of Greece, they now incline towards an arrangement 
favorable to Grecian independence ; an inadequate substitute, in 
their minds, to a total and speedy destruction of the insurgents, 
but where as little of republican freedom as possible should be 
admitted. There are already popping out from every country 
candidates for the sovereignty over this gallant people, whom 
nature has, still more especially than any other, marked for a 
republican confederacy. Here, I confess, comes again my proud 
sense of the moral influence of the United States. I hope Commodore Rodgers's squadron will be seen in those seas ; and I 
much lament the frigates, that were building in New York, are 
not yet arrived. From the European governments, without 
exception, not one honest feeling nor one disinterested advice 
can be by them expected. Not so with private persons. The 
day before I left town, an express arrived from Missolonghi to 
the French committee, announcing a want of ammunition and 
other necessaries in that fortress, upon which twelve thousand 
dollars were sent the same night to Leghorn, to purchase and 
ship off those articles. 

I have not heard the result of the position of the revolutionary 
officers ; but from my happy knowledge of the feeling toward 
tin-in, and of the disposition of Congress in their favor, and my 
grateful experience of what they have done for one of them, I 
fondly hope my beloved comrades will not have been disappointed. 

Be so kind, my dear Sir, as to present my best respects to 

.Mrs. Webster and family, and to your brother, to our friends at 

Washington and Boston. I hope the President and family are 

well. My son and Le Vasseur beg to be remembered. Has 

our friend Everett tried his splendid talents in the House of 

lepraentatires? His brother and Mrs. Everett I expect 1o 

before long^ as Mr. Adam Smith has gone to Madrid, and 

hf will, it is said, improve the first moment he can properly 

te, to a visit to the North. Most truly and forever 

Your affectionate friend, LAFAYETTE. 



CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Richmond, April 3, 1826. 

DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure of receiving a few days past, 
under cover from you, the documents accompanying the late 
message of the President to the House of Representatives on 
the Panama mission. We anticipate a tolerably animated discussion of this subject. I thank you very sincerely for this 
mark of polite recollection, and beg you to believe that I remain 
with sincere regard, 

Yours, JOHN MARSHALL. 






MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Washington, May 8, 1826. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letter written at Portland, and will not fail to attend to the subject of it. I had 
already found my attention turned towards the proposed law, 
which I very much dislike, and shall take care to oppose. 

The fate of the judiciary bill is quite uncertain. The Senate 
show much pertinacity in regard to their amendment ; and it is 
doubtful whether the House will ever consent to it. You will 
have noticed the proceedings thus far. If the Senate decline a 
conference, the bill is certainly lost. If they agree to a conference, and in that conference consent to abandon that part of 
their amendment which does not relate to the districts, it is 
possible, and only possible, the bill may finally pass. The real 
truth is, the gentlemen in the Senate who are called the Opposition, do not wish the bill to pass ; even those of them who are 
from the West have but a cool desire for it. I suppose the 
reason is, they do not wish to give so many important appointments to the President. I think we stand pretty well, either 
way. If the bill passes, well ; if not, we have made a fair offer, 
and the court will remain at seven some years longer. Judge 
Trimble's nomination is not yet acted on. 

There remain no very important measures now before congress, although there is a mass of subordinate business, and of 
private bills. 
My plan is to leave here on the 15th ; to send the horses along 
three or four days earlier, so as to proceed rapidly ourselves to 
New York. I shall hardly be more than seven or eight days 
going home ; so that I intend to be in your court, the second 
week of its sitting. I believe I have very little to do there, and 
I shall write to Mr. Bliss to postpone to next term, at once, all 
that can be so disposed of. After the second week of the court 
comes election week, a week not convenient for courts ; so that 
I think the business of the term had better be wound up, if 
practicable, the second week. I shall write to Mr. Blake to 
that effect, as well as Mr. Bliss. My health is good ; but still I 
am not anxious to go immediately to much hard work when I 
get home. From the first day of December, I have not been an 
inch from my place till Saturday, when I rode a few miles on 
horseback. I need motion and air, more than a court. If any 
thing occurs to change my present purposes, respecting the time 
of my departure, &c. I shall give you timely notice ; this letter 
I direct to Salem. Very probably I may write you again in a 
day or two, under cover to Mr. Bliss. 

Mrs. Webster joins me in love to you, and we both join in 
one other thing, that is the most affectionate remembrance to 
Mrs. Story. 

Yours truly, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Richmond, May 20, 1826. 

DEAR SIR, I returned yesterday from North Carolina, and 
had the pleasure of finding your speech on the mission to Panama, under cover from yourself. I had previously read it with 
deep interest, but was not on that account the less gratified at 
this politr mark of your attention. I can preserve it more certainly in a pamphlet form, than in that of a newspaper. 

Whatever doubts may very fairly be entertained respecting 
the policy of the mission, as an original measure, I think it was 
not involved in much difficulty when considered as it came 
before the House of Representatives. 

I congratulate you on closing a most laborious session, and 
am with great and respectful esteem, 

Your obedient servant, 

J. MARSHALL. 



LAFAYETTE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

La Grange, July 26, 1826. 

I HAVE been happy to hear from you, my dear Sir, and to 
welcome Mr. Bond at La Grange. My family have shared in 
the gratification, and I was preparing to offer at some length 
my acknowledgments, when I am informed this evening that 
Mr. Bigelow must have my letters to-morrow in town. I must 
therefore this time content myself with a few lines, in the hope 
they will speedily reach Boston. I wish I could say the like of 
the writer. 

It is superfluous to tell you I have with patriotic eagerness 
followed your long congressional debates ; nor can you doubt 
my having been highly gratified to read your eloquent and substantial observations, particularly when you have claimed the 
credit due to the people of the United States, their representatives, and the chief magistrate of the Union, for the eminent 
service rendered to the cause of South America and Mexico. 
My friend President Monroe's message did evidently put an end 
to the plots of the Holy Alliance, and drag the government of 
Great Britain into an immediate recognizance of the American 
republics. 

Notwithstanding the disaster of Missolonghi, and the abominable conduct of the European cabinets, the affairs of Greece 
wear a better aspect than had been, even by many of their 
friends, anticipated. They have found a providential auxiliary 
in the internal convulsions of the Ottoman Empire soon after 
the British policy had succeeded in queUing the co-religionary 
sympathies of Russia. The ardor of the Greeks is far from 
being abated. The most lively interest in their cause pervades 
every community, particularly in France, and it is not the only 
complete contrast between the governors and the governed in 
this side of the Atlantic. Lord Cochrane's private expedition 
in the service of Greece promises great deal. I ardently wish 
the frigates built in New York may arrive in time for assistance. I want the people of the United States to have as much 
credit as possible in this so very interesting cause of Greece ; it 
is with unspeakable pleasure and a due sense of pride, that I 
have a few days ago taken by the hand Captain Allen, a gallant 
citizen of New York, who, after having served four years in the 
United States navy as a midshipman, went to Greece a few 
days after my arrival in America, and since that time has been 
highly serviceable, being now flag captain to Admiral Miaulis 
and his intimate friend. He has been on a mission to London, 
but found time to stop a few hours at La Grange. 

Be pleased to present my affectionate regards to Mrs. Webster, your brother, Mr. and Mrs. Boyd, and our other friends in 
Boston. I must, to my great regret, leave you to-day ; but not 
before I have mentioned my son and Le Vasseur. 

Most cordially and forever your affectionate friend, 

LAFAYETTE. 

P. S. Present me very affectionately to my old friend John 
Adams, when you see him. I wish it may be in the power of 
the President to pay him a visit this summer ; should he and 
his lady be with you when you receive my letter, mention me 
most affectionately to them. 



MR. QUINOY TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Boston, August 3, 1826. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your perfect success yesterday ought to be 
as satisfactory to you as it is to your friends. I think nothing 
has ever exceeded or perhaps equalled it. 

In consequence of a controversy I had yesterday with a 
friend, I deem it an act of friendship to draw your attention to 
one part If it be as I understood it, there can be no possible 
objection. But if it be as he and I find others understood it, 
then it is desirable that it should be well considered in the 
aspect in which it may be viewed. 

I understood you, in that part in which you give an imaginary debate, relative to the expediency of a declaration of independence, to represent Hancock as the presiding officer ; an 
objector not prepared for the declaration addressing him, in 
opposition to it ; but I did not understand you as intending to 
attach those arguments against independence, to any person 
whatsoever, particularly not to Hancock ; because, being in the 
chair, he could not have partaken in that debate. To this 
state of the scene there can be no possible objection. 

I find, however, that the general, and I believe the universal 
impression, is that the argument against the declaration was 
put by you into the mouth of Hancock, and intended to attach 
to his character ; and that, in point of form, it was bringing 
Hancock and J. Adams on the arena in direct opposition to 
each other on this point. 

As my own impressions at the time of delivery were different, 
1 have no difficulties in the case ; all was perfectly satisfactory to 
me. But, if I am mistaken, and the general impression concerning this part of your discourse be correct, then permit me, in 
that deep sentiment of respect and affection which I entertain 
for your name, fame, and influence, all which I would have as 
spotless as it is brilliant, to inquire 

1. Is there any fact in history which justifies the attaching 
more doubt or hesitation, at that moment, to the character of 
Hancock than to that of Adams. If not, why should Hancock 
be made the channel for the communicating the timid and temporizing policy in argument, as though it was his opinion. In 
sketches of fancy, to which the names of great men are attached, 
we owe to them a scrupulous justice. If Hancock did not take 
that ground, it ought not to be attached to his memory. 

2. If he did, and in' his anxiety to prevent the declaration, he 
abandoned the chair, and took the ground of opposition, still, I 
respectfully inquire, is it worth while to keep that fact in 
memory against him, by a formal register of a speech made on 
that ground ? Will not the effect be just as strong, by representing the speech in opposition to have been made by some 
nameless individual, who may be considered as concentrating 
in his own argument, whatever may be urged in opposition, 
without making any individual responsible for it ? I seated to 
you, in the beginning, this was my understanding of your 

VOL. i. 35 
speech. But I find both clergymen and lawyers, and, I am 
certain, the multitude, received it otherwise. 

The argument of Adams was noble and characteristic. The 
point of the objection you will see. If there be any grounds for 
it, I wish you to consider it If, as I believe, there is none, 
then I have nothing to say except that now as ever I am 

Yours, JOSIAH QuiNcv. 1 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Boston, October 14, 1826. 

DEAR SIR, I do not know that I am acquainted with any 
sources of information, on the subject mentioned in your letter 
which are not probably known to you. We do not know as 
much of the first settlers of New' Hampshire as of those of Massachusetts. The two colonies came for different purposes and 
under different auspices. Dr. Belknap found out a greater part 
of what is to be learned of the New Hampshire settlers. He 
was a very thorough and diligent searcher among all the early 
legislative and judicial records of the province. Possibly some 
of the old families in Portsmouth may have valuable materials, 
but I doubt it. Mr. Adams, in his annals of Portsmouth, has 
been able to add but little to the stock of knowledge. Before 
the peace of Paris, 1763, the settlements in New Hampshire were 
very limited. Concord and Charlestown were the frontier. 
When, by that peace, the Indian hostilities were terminated, 
new settlements spread over the State. These settlers were most 
of them from Massachusetts and Connecticut. The original 
settlers, therefore, are only those who planted themselves on the 
Piscataqua, and its branches ; and I doubt whether there remain 
any unexplored sources affording information as to their early 
history. Your industry, however, will glean something, and the 
subject is a proper one for research and discussion. 

It would give us much pleasure to see you here with your 
wifr, and to receive a good visit from you. Your stops here are 
are all too short ; at least we think them so. 

I am, my dear nephew, yours affectionately, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

1 Mr. Quincy's understanding of the remarks was the correct one. No such 
reference to Mr. Hancock was intended by Mr. Webster. 



DAXIEL WEBSTER 411 

P. S. In regard to the moral character generally of our ancestors, the settlers of New England, my opinion is that they 
possessed all the Christian virtues but charity ; and they seem 
never to have doubted that they possessed that also. And 
nobody could accuse their system or their practice but of one 
vice, and that was religious hypocrisy, of which they had an 
infusion without ever being sensible of it. 

It necessarily resulted from that disposition which they cherished, of subjecting men's external conduct, in all particulars, to 
the influence and government of express rule and precept, either 
of church or state. That always makes hypocrites and formalists ; it leads men to rely on mint and cummin. A man 
thought it an act of merit, if we may take the blue laws of Connecticut for authority, not to walk within ten feet of his wife in 
their way to church ; as some parents, nowadays, think it a 
merit to restrain their daughters from a village dance ; one is 
quite as sensible and as much to do with religion as the other. 
Indeed, it is the universal tendency of strong religious excitement, 
a tendency of our infirm nature, growing out of our weaknesses 
and our vices, to run into observances, and make a strong merit 
of external acts. Our excellent ancestors did not escape the 
influence of this propensity ; but they had so many high and pure 
virtues, that this spot should not give offence. They were a 
wonderful people. This very failing, of which I have spoken, 
leaned so much on the virtues of decision, sense of duty, and the 
feeling that will bear no compromise with what it thinks wrong, 
that I forgive it to them. The determined spirit with which 
they resisted every approach of what they thought evil, was itself 
a great virtue. Of itself it is harmless, but it leads, or may lead 
to evil." This was their answer, and perhaps there is something 
in it ; but then it may be said of almost everything. The vice 
of the argument, as an argument, is, that it proves too much. 
Eating, drinking, sleeping, conversation, are all equally under 
its condemnation. But though indefensible as a rule of conduct, 
some general consequences followed from the spirit which accompanied it, which consequences are extremely useful. It 
sharpened the sight for the discovery of political evils. The tea 
tax, for example, was not oppressive, as a tax ; it was too small 
for that. It was opposed on principle. " It led or might lead 
to other taxes." Our fathers acted on system ; and the inquiry 
with them was, not whether the thing was bearable but whether 
it was right. I verily believe, although I do not like Breeds 
rrli-ious matters, that creeds had something to do with the Revolution. In their religious controversies, the people of 
England had always been accustomed to stand on points; and 
when Lord North undertook to tax them, they stood on points 
also. It so happened, fortunately, that their opposition t< 
North was a point on which they all united. 
But enough of this postscript. 



MR. WEBSTER TO JUDGE STORY. 

Washington, December 26. 

DEAR SIR, I rose this morning with a resolution not to 
let the day pass without writing you one word, although it 
should be but one. I have long intended, every day, to do the 
same thing, but something has constantly happened to prevent 
it. Thus far, I have been laboring hard to get the Spanish 
claims off my hands, so as to be able to attend, without distraction, to my other duties. But these things together, and 
some new engagements for the court, leave me quite too little 
time for correspondence. The private affairs with which a 
member from a large town is necessarily charged, are very 
numerous. To be a public man, I ought to represent one of the 
inland counties of my good native State, or else a borough. 

You will have seen in a late National Intelligencer, the report 
of last year, respecting the courts. Something undoubtedly 
will be done on that subject this session. What shall we do ? 
Shall we increase your bench by two ? Shall we relieve your 
bench from all circuit duties, and establish a uniform system 
of circuit courts ? . Shall we provide circuit judges for the westcm districts ? 

I must entreat your sentiments fully on these matters. I feel 

1 1 objection to either of the first two propositions ; others have 

objections to the last They make a kind of point of honor to 

have supreme judges in the circuit courts, if other circuits have 

such. 

My plan, if it deserve the name, would be to appoint three or 

four circuit judges in the West ; to provide also, if we could, for 
the appointment of a circuit judge contingently in the East, in 
the next vacancy. 

My object, in short, would be to provide, that all the judges of 
the supreme court should perform some circuit duty ; and as 
much as they could conveniently; that there should be circuit 
judges enough to perform the rest; and that such arrangements 
should be made in this respect, as, when vacancies occur on your 
bench, giving the opportunity, two supreme judges should be 
allotted to the West ; in other words, that the West should have 
two judges on the supreme bench. 

Is this a right object ? If it be, tell me how I shall accomplish 
it. By the middle of the next month, I must report some plan. 
Pray sit down, think, and write. We are all well ; my wife 
is very happy. We have good rooms, good fires, good company, and good spirits, in quomodo sensu, intelligitur. Mrs. 
Webster sends her love to Mrs. Story and yourself. I beg to 
make a large addition to it, as it passes through my hands. 

Yours always, 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. EVERETT. 

Washington, December 31, 1826. 

DEAR SIR, Mr. Vaughan called here yesterday, and invited 
me to dine with him to-morrow, en famille, and particularly 
requested me to see you and your ladies, and beg of you and 
them the favor to be of the party. Mrs. Bankhead will be there 
to keep your wife and Miss Brooks in countenance. If you 
will signify to me, through the bearer, your good inclinations 
in regard to this matter, I will make them known. 

It was so cold yesterday that I could not persuade myself 
to leave my room, or I should have called at your house. As 
near as I recollect, though my memory is a good deal chilled, it 
is now about a week since I was warm, out of bed. 
Yours, however, very warmly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SPRAGUE. 

Washington, January 10, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am quite obliged to you for your letter, 
although I confess it has caused me some uneasiness. I cannot 
persuade myself that the legislature, under present circumstances, 
will omit to reelect Mr. Mills. Here, I assure you, we are all 
of one mind on the subject. We think there is nothing in his 
health to make it improper, and that every thing else is in favor 
of it. If the legislature will not agree to that, I hope the election may be postponed. For mercy's sake, do not weaken our 
power in the Senate. When all the Philistines are against us, 
do let us have all the strength we can have. If Mr. Mills lives, 
he is second to no man in the Senate among our friends. Why 
then should he be now superseded ? We shall know more of 
his health in June ; and June is early enough for the election. 
But, as I will answer for it, that he will not hold the office any 
longer than he is able to discharge its duties, I should hope he 
would be now reflected. 

Having so settled an opinion as to what is fit to be done, 
namely, to reelect Mr. Mills, or postpone the choice, I really 
have not thought of what would be best in case neither of these 
two things can take place. Of that, my dear Sir, you can better judge than I. I only say that if you are governed by a disposition to sustain Mr. Adams, and help on the public business, 
you will, in all events, elect a man of the very best talents 
which are at your disposal. I pray you let no local, nor temporary, nor any small consideration induce you to refrain from 
electing the fittest man that can be found, and that can possibly 
be prevailed on to take the place. The present moment, be 
assured, is a crisis in the affairs of Massachusetts and all the 
North. 

I am, dear Sir, very truly yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

Londonderry, January 17, 1827. 

DEAR DANIEL, I came here yesterday. My wife has been 
here a fortnight with Alice, who has been ill. She is gaining 
slowly, and it will probably be another fortnight before she will 
be able to go home. Governor Bell and his friends took the 
course I anticipated. They called, by a printed notice, a meeting 
of the Republican friends of the administration at the court 
house. This adjective was inserted before deliberation or consultation. I did not attend, feeling myself excluded by the terms 
of the invitation. The meeting was large, and many speeches 
were made by Governor Bell, Bartlett, Governor Morrill, Richard 
Bartlett, and Speaker Hubbard. The object of all the speakers, 
except Governor Bell, was to prove Mr. Adams to be a democrat, his administration strictly democratic, and more purely and 
actively so than Monroe's, Madison's, or Jefferson's. They 
vindicated him from the charges of being a Federalist, or inclining to favor the Federalists. This was the substance of their 
speeches. After the meeting, Governor Bell wished to see me, and 
I called upon him. He said the manner of calling the meeting 
might not be satisfactory to me ; he hoped it would be upon 
reflection ; that he and his friends had determined to have resolutions introduced into the House approving the measures of the 
administration, and hoped that the Federalists would support 
them. He repeated very much his former conversation, renewed 
his declarations of good feeling, &c., &c. In reply, I calmly 
told him that, in our former conversation, I had suggested to him 
the course which I thought the republican friends of the administration ought to pursue ; but I was willing that he and his 
friends should adopt the principles on which they would support 
the administration in this State ; and, as far as I was concerned, 
they might support it on their own principles as well as they 
could. But if those principles were exclusive, or prescriptive 
of the Federalists, they could not complain if they had not the 
aid or assistance of the Federalists. I remarked that he knew 
that the course of the Federalists had been honorable in New 
Hampshire, and marked by the strictest integrity ; that in all 
divisions of the republican party, whether upon men or measures, 
the Federalists had voted for the best men and the best measures; that when gentlemen of the republican party were candidates for office, they were very desirous to appear to have no 
intercourse with Federalists ; but they had no objection to the 
receiving of federal vo$es, and federal support. At other times, 
the Federalists were treated as outcasts and aliens. I referred 
him to the conduct of the Federalists in this very legislature, in 
the organization of the House and in the choice of commissarygeneral. I reminded him that the friends of the administration 
had represented to us that the political salvation of Portsmouth, 
certainly, and perhaps that ef the State, depended upon this 
election, insignificant as was the office ; that it was made a party 
question ; that on this vote the Jackson men were to rally, and if 
Nelson, their candidate, succeeded, it would give such confidence 
to the friends of Jackson in Portsmouth, that they would carry 
every election in the town ever afterwards. Such was their representation to us, and they courted the influence and solicited the 
votes of the Federalists ; and the Federalists did give their votes, 
to a man, for their candidate, and elected him ; yet, in two days, 
these gentlemen, in express terms, declared that they would not 
admit us to the meeting of the friends of the administration. I 
told him that I considered this treatment of the Federalists from 
the republican friends of the administration as ungenerous and 
unjust; and such as Federalists, who had any self-respect, would 
not submit to. I inquired of him why the friends of the administration did not support that administration in New Hampshire on their own principles, and whether they expected the aid 
of Federalists in other States, when they proscribed them in 
this ? He said, in reply, that his own feelings were liberal, and 
that the time would certainly come when there might be a union 
with Federalists, on the principles mentioned by me; but as 
yet, the public sentiment was not ripe. I replied, that, on that 
point, I differed from him; that I believed the public sentiment 
to be in favor of such a union at this moment ; that it was not 
the sentiment of the people that needed to be corrected, but the 
sentiments of those who affected to be leaders of the people; 
and that, in my opinion, the public feeling would be right, in 
this respect, whenever he and his friends wished to have it so ; 
that this was a matter altogether with him and his friends ; that 
whenever they were willing to unite with the Federalists, they 

might expect their aid, and not before, whether in favor of their 
resolutions or any other measure. We parted under a good 
deal of excitement. The resolutions, I suppose, will be introduced on Monday ; and if they should be, a motion will be 
made to postpone them indefinitely, for which I shall vote, if no 
other man does. My present intention is to have the resolutions 
postponed ; and if it becomes necessary in the debate on that 
question, to give to the House the true reasons plainly and 
frankly for the motion, I shall do it. If that motion fail, and 
we are obliged to act upon them, T shall endeavor to amend 
them, giving them force and character, and then advocate thenpassage, giving my hearty and zealous support to the administration on its own principles, and not on those of its exclusive 
friends in this State. 

We are glad to hear of Mrs. Webster's recovery; 

Let us know the appearances of things in New York, &c. 

Yours truly, 

E. WEBSTER 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

I 
Boston, April 10, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, You will have heard from Mary, since her 
arrival here. We had a pleasant passage, and I was glad of 
her company. Since I have been at home, my attention has 
been occupied with various matters, private and professional. I 
have, nominally, some little business yet in the State courts ; although my long absences have very much severed me from them. 
In the neighboring counties, where courts are held at seasons 
when I am at home, I have also an occasional engagement, and 
these affairs have required my attention since my return. 

The business in the State court at Washington was heavy, 
as you have seen ; and my participation in it greater than usual. 
We got on with the Virginia cause famously; you will see, 
when you see the report, that our friend Judge Story laid out 
his whole strength and made a great opinion. The attorneygeneral argued the cause with me. It was not one of his happiest efforts. By the aid of your brief, I got on tolerably well, 
and took the credit, modestly, of having made a good argument ; 
at any rate, I got a very good fee ; and although I shaU not send 
you your just part of it, I yet enclose a draft for the least sum 
which I can persuade myself you deserve to receive. 

I was sorry not to be able to get good materials from you, in 
the lottery case, also. But we got along with the cause, and 
hope sometime to get the money. 

As to political matters, I wish to say something, but hardly 
know where to begin. A survey of the whole ground leads me 
to believe, confidently, in Mr. Adams's reelection. I set down 
New England, New Jersey, the greater part of Maryland, and 
perhaps all Delaware, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and 
Louisiana for him. 

We must then get votes enough in New York to choose him, 
and I think cannot fail of this. It is possible we may lose four 
votes in Kentucky, but I do not expect it. At the same time 
it is not impossible that Pennsylvania may go for Mr. Adams. 
Beyond doubt, public opinion is taking a very strong turn in 
that State, and it is not now easy to say how far the change may 
proceed. That there is a change, and a great change, is too clear 
to be questioned. 

In New York, affairs wear the common complexion of New 
York politics. Mr. Clinton and some few of his friends have 
the credulity to think that he has yet some chance of being President two years hence. They flatter themselves that General 
Jackson's friends will abandon the General, and take him up. 
You will think none can be so weak or so ill-informed as to 
entertain such a hope, but, in truth, there are such men, and Mr. 
Clinton is himself one of them. The choice is with the people 
in districts, and unless some change takes place, Mr. Adams 
will get a majority, perhaps a large one. 

You perceive how local questions have split up our good 
people here. You see the worst of it. In truth, right feeling 
very generally prevails, and nothing but prudent conduct is 
necessary to manifest it. Measures are in train, in relation to 
the ensuing choice of representatives, which I think will show 
that Boston is yet Boston. Care will also be taken to induce 
other towns to send good, and a good many, members to the 
general court We shall have a Senator to elect. Our difficulty will be to find a man fit for the place, and with popularity 
to carry the election. 

I had a great deal of conversation with Mr. Bell, in the course 
of the session, respecting the state of affairs with you. I have 
confidence in his good dispositions, but I do not think his policy 
bold enough. He understands my opinion, and guesses at 
yours, on that point. Experience, one would think, must have 
taught him by this time that there is but one course ; and that 
is to rally, as administration men, without reference to bygone distinctions. 

I wish you could see and converse with him, about the 19th 
or 20th. I shall go up to Boscawen to see my brother. If I 
can persuade him to accompany me, I would return by way of 
Portsmouth, to pass a single day with you. It seems, that 
without his consent or knowledge, he is chosen to the State 
legislature. He is so much displeased and dissatisfied with the 
course adopted by Mr. Adams's republican friends, in New 
Hampshire, that I know not whether he can be persuaded to do 
any thing. I have, however, thought it would be worth considering whether he should not bring forward resolutions, approving the conduct of the administration, and disapproving 
that of the opposition, and supporting them by a good strong 
speech. This would, perhaps, have two good effects ; it would, 
in the first place,' compel Mr. Adams's friends to act with him, 
and, in the second place, it would oblige Mr. Hill's friends to 
take their side. All this, however, is for future consideration. 

When you have time, not better employed, I shall be glad to 
hear from you. If I should not return from Boscawen by your 
way, I shall take another early opportunity to go to Portsmouth. 

To-morrow, Thursday, I am going down to dine with the 
judge. Yours, always truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. MILLS TO MR. WEBSTER. 



New York, June 9, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just learned the result of the choice of 
Senator, on the part of the House of Representatives, and I assure you, with the utmost sincerity, that it is as gratifying to me 
as it is creditable to the House, and will be beneficial to the 
Commonwealth and the nation. 

I regret, however, that I had not known your views in season 
to prevent any votes being thrown away upon me. I should 
certainly have done so, had I not been assured, by an extract 
of a letter, read to me as coming from you, that you would not 
consent to be a candidate ; and that the choice would probably 
fall on Mr. John Mills. This I was willing to prevent, I confess ; 
and in consequence of all this, I now appear before the public 
as an unsuccessful candidate for an office which, Heaven knows, 
I sincerely wished not to hold, and as having incurred an implied vote of censure for my past services. I have the vanity to 
believe, however, that this was not intended, and that T shall 
have credit for honest intentions and pure motives in the discharge of my public duties, and of having served the State, 
which has so long honored me with its confidence, with fidelity 
and zeal, and a sincere desire to promote its honor and interests, 
however inadequate my capacity may have been to accomplish 
the object. The consciousness of this will, at any rate, be a 
source of no small gratification to me through life. 

My health is gradually improving, and I hope to reach home 
in the course of next week. I shall leave New York on Monday, and probably stop a few days in New Haven. 

With great regard and esteem, I am, dear Sir, very respectfully, Your obedient servant, 

E. H. MILLS. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SPRAGUE. 
[PRIVATE.] 

Boston, June 20, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I must not omit longer to thank you for all 
the kind things you have said and done in connection with recent events. 

I beg yon to be assured that I am not and shall not be insensible to the effect which your good wishes and good efforts 
have produced. I hope to have a long memory for friendship 
and kindness, as I desire a short one for injuries and acts of 

injustice ; none of which last, however, have I ever received at 
your hands. 

They appear to go on nobly in New Hampshire, except in one 
respect. They confined their call for an administration meeting to " Republicans " exclusively ; thereby shutting out more 
than one third of the legislature, and nearly all men of talents, 
though all well disposed. Mr. Bell means well, but he is yet 
afraid of Hill. 

I rejoice that you are going to Harrisburg. It will be an excellent thing, both for you and the public. I mean to persuade 
my brother, who is appointed to go from New Hampshire, to 
accept the appointment. I venture to say you will be pleased 
with him, as a man of sense and information. I hope to see 
you before your departure. Mrs. Webster has been quite ill. 
She is now well enough to ride, and I propose taking a journey 
with her, and then I go to the court at Nantucket, from all 
which, however, I expect to be home by the 10th or 15th of July, 
which will be before you set off. 

Yours, very truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, July 20, 1827. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have received yours from Londonderry. 
You cannot disapprove and dislike the party proceeding at 
Concord, more than I do. I hold it equally unjust and impolitic. I would not support the administration one hour if 1 
supposed it countenanced such a narrow and bigoted policy. 
Of this sentiment I make no secret. Governor Bell means well, 
as I believe, but I do think he has made a great mistake. It is 
miserable, it is miserable indeed, if those who are inclined to 
support the administration, find it or think it necessary to 
make an apology for such an act as the appointment of Mr. 
King. 

If you find it necessary, for your own justification, to speak 
on these subjects, tell the whole truth, right out, plainly, and go 
VOL. i. 36 
at once to the people ; they will be with you. I hope, however, the resolutions maybe of a character so liberal as that you 
can 'support them. I am more and more persuaded that the 
true way was for you, or some of your friends, to have introduced the resolutions yourselves. 

I am glad you go to Harrisburg. It will be both useful and 
pleasant to you. I shall of course see you here a day or two, 
on your way. By all means go. Make some arrangement of 
your Concord court business. Make Mr. Mason attend to it, or 
Brother Stevens. 

The meeting, I hear, is now expected to be on the 30th July. 
It is precisely the season to see Pennsylvania. Mrs. Webster 
is getting well. At the end of this week I take her to Sandwich; thence I go to Nantucket court, return by Plymouth 
court, and get home the 10th August. 

All is well in New York. We can do without New Hampshire, if narrow counsels make it necessary to give her up. 
Yet I should be ashamed if our native State should act 
foolishly. Yours, 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SILSBEE. 

New York, December 1, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am kept here by a concurrence of unfortunate circumstances. Mrs. Webster's health was not entirely 
good when we left home, but still, such as to allow the hope 
that we should be able to travel with ordinary speed. Our 
unfortunate passage from Providence increased her debility, and 
since she has arrived here, an accidental cause has contributed 
to make her case worse. From this last, however, she is now 
fast recovering, and I trust will be able to travel on Monday. 
To-day I have myself a very painful attack of rheumatism, 
occasioned, I suppose, by a violent cold I took on the way ; 
and am not now able to leave my room. This will be better, 
however, I trust soon ; so that my present hopes are to set forward on Monday. We shall not make a moment's stop for 
any purpose not connected with health. I hope I may not be 
needed before I can arrive with my family. But if it were likely 

that I should be, I would leave them, at whatever inconvenience, 
and proceed by the most rapid conveyance, if my own health 
should be such as to allow of it. You will receive this on 
Monday, and I will thank you to write me, addressed to Philadelphia, saying whether any thing is expected to occur, in 
which my vote may be essential. I am fully aware of the 
general importance of every member's presence at this moment 
in the Senate ; and I feel extreme anxiety in consequence of my 
own unavoidable absence, even for a single day. Still, I am 
desirous of keeping my wife and children with me, if possible ; 
as I should otherwise be obliged to return for them. Let me 
hear from you as above requested. I write this not without 
great inconvenience. I can neither walk nor sit upright. 

Yours, DAN'L WEBSTER. 



MR. MILLS TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Northampton, December 3, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, If you will put the enclosed in a way of 
speedily reaching Mr. Barrell, you will confer a favor on both 
him and me. If time permitted I should probably give you 
some further trouble, but must postpone it for a day or two. 
At present, I can only say that my health is considerably 
improved since I left Boston, although the cold weather has 
shut me up, I suppose for the winter, if I live through it. My 
professional pursuits are entirely suspended, and all continued 
efforts of the lungs forbidden. I congratulate you, my dear 
Sir, on your preservation through the perils of your steamboal 
passage, and most sincerely hope you experienced a continuance 
of the same providential protection through your journey, and 
are now safely located with your family in comfortable quarters. 
Although I truly rejoice that I am not obliged to mingle in the 
strifes and debates of the Capitol, I am very anxious to hear 
how they are managed and how they terminate. Should your 
multiplied engagements allow you to drop me a few lines 
occasionally, I assure you they will contribute much towards 
rendering my solitude less dreary. I am so well acquainted 
with most of your fellow-laborers that all their movements pos


PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF 

*PS3 with me no little interest. Even the solemn foppery of 
Colonel K. and the mock-heroics of Governor B., ridiculous as 
they are, afford me amusement when higher matter fails. But 
I am already trespassing upon the mail hour. Mrs. Mills unites 
with me in cordial regards to Mrs. Webster and family, and 

believe me, 

Dear Sir, yours truly, 

E. H. MILLS. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 

New York, December 5, 7 p. M., 1827. 

DEAR WILLIAM, I must now write you more fully upon the 
afflicting state of Mrs. Webster's health. Dr. Post, a very 
eminent physician and surgeon, has to-day been called into 
consultation with Dr. Perkins. Their opinion, I am distressed 
to say, is far from favorable. I believe they will recommend her 
return to Boston as soon as convenient. They seem to think 
that it is very uncertain how fast or how slow may be the progress of the complaint ; but they hold out faint hopes of any cure. 
I hope I may be able to meet the greatest of all earthly afflictions with firmness, but I need not say that I am at present 
quite overcome. I have not yet communicated to Mrs. Webster 
what the physicians think. That dreadful task remains. She 
will receive the information, I am sure, as a Christian ought. 
Under present circumstances, I should be very glad if you could 
come here, although I would not wish you to put yourself to 
too much inconvenience. I should be very glad myself to go to 
Washington, though it were but for a single day, but J should 
not do that unless in the mean time Mrs. Webster could be on 
her return. I shall now make no move until I hear from you 
in :ui<\v<r to this letter. If you come on, I think the best way 
will be to take the mail stage-coach, with the chance of finding 
ar. evening boat at New Haven. You must let Fletcher know, 
without alarming him too much, that his mother's health is 
precarious, and that she will probably return home. I am not 
yet able to write, as you see, though I think I am getting better. 

Yours truly, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 

P. S. 8 o'clock. I would fain hope that the foregoing is of 
too alarming a character. I have since seen Mrs. Webster and 
told her the doctors' opinions. She says she still has courage. 
If you can come on so as to accompany Mrs. Webster home, it 
will not be necessary that you should set out the very day you 
receive this. But I shall not myself go to Washington until I 
hear from you that you can come to take Mrs. Webster home, 
if need be. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SILSBEE. 

New York, December 9, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am sorry not to be able to give you a better 
account of myself, and especially that I am obliged to speak so 
unfavorably of Mrs. Webster's health. I have not yet been able 
to leave the house, nor indeed was I able to quit my own room 
till yesterday evening. I am getting better, hoyever, and if the 
weather were not so particularly unfavorable, I should have 
hopes of setting forward in a day or two. 

My great affliction is the state of Mrs. Webster's health. 
Whether it is best for her to return to Boston, or to remain 
some time here, with a hope of being able hereafter to proceed 
to Washington, is a question difficult to decide. She is very 
unwilling to return ; and the physicians do not encourage her 
further progress South. I am now in the hourly expectation 
of the arrival of her brother, Mr. Paige, when we shall determine 
on something. It is most probable, I think, that she will return 
to Boston with Mr. Paige, and that I shall proceed South without her. It is possible, however, she may stay here, in the hope 
of being able to accompany Mr. and Mrs. Story, some three 
weeks hence, to Washington, as I have already said. 
Yours, with most true regard, 

DAN'L WEBSTER.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, December 17, 1827. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I arrived here but last night, and have first 
to say that I left my wife sick at New York. Her complaint, 
which is partly local, has been of some time standing, but we 
did not think much of it till lately. I fear now it is dangerous. 
She was much more comfortable when I left New York than 
she had been for a fortnight; but whether permanently better 
I know not. Mr. Paige is now there with her, at Dr. Perkins's. 
If she should get so well as to be able to travel, I shall go back 
for her. On the other hand, if she grow worse, I must go and 
stay with her. I know not how Providence will dispose of this 
threatening case; but at present it fills me with the keenest 

anxiety. 

I find here two letters from you, and have received another 
to-day. As soqn as I have been here long enough to learn 
what is the state of things, I will write you on political matters. 
I find our friends here not despairing. 

Yours as ever, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO JUDGE STORY. 

Washington, December 18, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, Yours of the 13th, addressed to New York, 
has followed me hither. My own health was so far restored, 
that on Thursday, the 13th, I ventured to set forth, and arrived 
here Sunday evening, the 16th, without inconvenience, and 
with far better health than I had when I left New York. I do 
not now write myself an invalid. 

I left Mrs. Webster at New York. Her health was bad, 
though better than it had been. I know not whether you are 
acquainted with the nature of her complaint ; though Dr. Warren or Mr. Ticknor will readily explain it to you. My last letter, 
December 16, says she is on the whole " better than any time 
before since she came to New York." I am still in great hopes 
of her being able to join me here. Mr. Paige is now with her, 

and will stay till Christmas. If she should be able to travel, I 
expect to go for her and bring her along. I desired Mr. Paige 
to keep you informed. 

Our rooms I found all ready and in order ; and notwithstanding Mrs. Webster's illness they will be kept for her, and for you 
and Mrs. Story. Our good landlady has done all in her power 
to prepare for us ; and if my poor wife had health, I should look 
forward to a happy session. And as it is I hope for the best. 
You say you shall set out by the 29th. I have given that 
information this morning to Mr. Silsbee's and Mr. Crowninshield's families, and they hope only that it may be earlier. I 
am sure Mrs. Story will find herself pleasantly situated here. 
As to political affairs, I have not been here long enough to 
learn much. I find our friends not discouraged. Virginia appears to be showing great strength for the administration, and 
many hopes are entertained of her final vote that way The 
weather has been so bad, I have as yet seen very few persons, 
since I came here. 

I am glad Mason succeeded in The Argonaut. It is a good 
cause, whatever Judge P. may think of it, and must finally prevail. It would not give rise to a serious doubt in any other 
part of the Union, at least I think so. 

I shall write you again shortly ; and in the mean time am, 
with all my heart, 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. Remember my regards to Mrs. Story. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MILLS. 

Washington, December 19, 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I arrived here only on Sunday evening, the 
16th instant. You are acquainted probably with the causes of 
my detention for a fortnight in New York. I left Mrs. Webster 
there still quite unwell. My last letters represent her as much 
more comfortable and free from pain than she had been, but I 
feel the greatest anxiety as to the original cause of her illness. 

I found here your letter of the 3d, and despatched its 



4->s PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF 

enclosure to Mr. Barrell. It gave me great pleasure to hear 
from you, and to know that thus far you are getting along 
through the winter with less inconvenience than was expected. 
I hope we shall have little weather more severe than was 
experienced the latter part of last month. 

As yet I feel new and strange in the Senate. My habits 
have become conformed to the course and manner of things elsewhere ; and it will require time to enable me to feel at home 
where I now am. According to present appearances, there will 
be little for me to do. Our adversaries undoubtedly have a 
majority, and I think the true course is to let them exercise it, 
as seems to them good. Why should we be responsible for 
what we cannot control ? 

To-day we have heard Colonel Johnson's " Annual" on 
abolition of imprisonment; sound, practical, systematic, and 
coherent ! 

The good Deacon Bradford is here, a sort of agent for the 
revolutionary officers. He has, as you will see, trusted their 
cause in the Senate to Mr. Woodbury. Be it so. No considerable debate has arisen yet in either House. P. P. Barber's 
resolution, to sell out of the bank, is expected to be called up 
to-morrow. 

The Senate room is transmogrified since last session. The 
Vice-President sits opposite the main door, and faces his former 
seat The seats are crowded, and altogether the arrangement 
is not good. My place, Hobson's choice, is nearest the chair 
on its left hand. It was left by forty-seven wiser heads than 
mine, and yet I believe it the best seat in the chamber. 

Mrs. Adams's first drawing-room was last night; I was 
not there, but believe she is not at all well. The President 
is tolerably well, and Mr. Clay also, whose faith and courage 
still hold out. I hear he has thought it necessary to put 
forth another publication on the combination question, which 
is expected soon to appear. I regret it ; though I am told it 
is very satisfactorily done. This, I believe, is not yet a public 
matter. 

It will be one of my most agreeable duties, my dear Sir. to 
writr to you. and to forward you -any thing to occupy your 
hours; it will !>.> still more gratifying to be useful to you in any 
more important respect 

When you have leisure and strength, I shall be happy to hear 
from you. 

Yours always truly, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 

December 25, Christmas noon, 1827. 

DEAR WILLIAM, Your letter of Sunday has this moment 
reached me, in which you say Mrs. Webster would be glad if it 
should be quite convenient for rne that I would come to New 
York to meet Judge Story, and I certainly shall do so. I cannot go for a day or two, because my cold is too severe ; but there 
is nothing to prevent my setting off so soon as I am quite well. 
Judge Story wrote me that he should probably set out about the 
29th, which is next Saturday. 

Possibly I may not leave here before Monday, the 31st ; but 
even then I shall be in New York as soon as the judge. On 
receipt of this, I will thank you to write me, saying whether 
Mrs. Webster wishes me to bring any of hers or the children's 
things along with me. Your letter, if written on Friday morning, will be here on Sunday, so that if I happen to stay till 
Monday, I shall get it* Probably I shall go off before Monday ; 
this will depend a little as well on the weather and the state of 
the public conveyances as on my getting rid of my cold. 

I hope, if it be not too inconvenient, you will stay till I come, 
and then we can talk about Grace's going to Boston, or Washington. The tone of your letters, for three or four days, has 
been so much more favorable than before, that I feel encouraged. 
It will be dull to her, I fear, to be left again by me, after you 
are gone ; but then I must come here, despatch some few things, 
and return to her again. I shall let no business, public or private, prevent attention to her, as the first duty. 

My cold is better to-day, but still I am not quite well. Indeed, 
tj much of rheumatism, and then so severe a cold, have rather 
reduced this corporeal system of mine to some little degree of 
weakness. Two or three days of good weather, which I know 
not when we shall see again, would do me a great deal of 
good. 
You will of course send this to Grace, as I shall not write 

another to-day. 

Yours always truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 
P. S. Again to-morrow. 

My Christmas dinner is a handful of magnesia, a bowl of 
gruel. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Washington, December 26, 1827. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I cannot write you now a political letter, 
but must tell you something about me and mine. I came here 
the 17th, pretty free of rheumatism, but have since had a violent 
and obstinate cold, which finally has brought me to keep house. 
It is now, I think, better ; but it will be two or three days before 
I shall be well again, at best. Mrs. Webster, as you know, I 
left in New York, quite sick. She has been perhaps, on the 
whole, from the time of my departure to the date of my last 
letter, a good deal more comfortable and free from pain than for 
the fortnight I was in New York. I cannot say that her substantial cause of illness is better ; but Mr. Paige writes on the 
23d that he thinks more favorably of the future progress and 
final result of the complaint than I did, when I left New 
York. It is a tumor of rather anomalous character, and the 
best surgeons look upon it with much fear of consequences. It 
seems to have a tendency to break out ; this they dread, and try 
to disperse it ; although its real character, perhaps, can only be 
fully known when that shall take place. I would not alarm 
myself or my friends, unnecessarily ; but, to say the truth, my 
dear Sir, I fear the worst. I shall leave here, if I am well 
enough, on Saturday, for New York. There I expect to meet 
the Judge and Mrs. Story. Whether I shall return hither with 
her, or stay at New York, or endeavor to get Mrs. Webster 
home, must be decided by the state of things which I shall find 
in- wli.-n I get there. If it should be probable, which the 
surgeons somewhat incline to suppose, that my wife may remain 
for a considerable time without essential change, I do not see 
that the superior duty of being with her must not lead to the 

vacation of the situation which I fill here. I should be very 
glad to hear from you, directed to New York, care of Dr. Perkins, Fulton street. 

I am, dear Sir, most truly yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. SILSBEE. 

New York, January 4, 1828. 

MY DEAR SIR, I arrived here yesterday at eleven o'clock, 
after a very tolerable journey, and without having added any 
thing to my cold. Indeed, I think it is better than when I left 
Washington. 

I find Mrs. Webster more comfortable, on the whole, than I 
expected. She has now enjoyed more rest and repose, and more 
freedom from pain, for three days together, than in any equal 
time since we came here, six weeks ago. She has lost flesh since 
I left her, however, and is now feeble. 

As to the original cause of her illness, I do not know exactly 
what to think of it. Some symptoms are certainly a little 
more favorable. I cannot help getting a little new hope, on the 
whole ; though I fear I build on a slight foundation. 

I find here Judge Story and his wife. They are in very good 
health. He has not looked so well for a long time. It is a 
great thing to get him out of his study. They set off this afternoon, being anxious to get over the Chesapeake before the 
boat stops. They will take possession of the rooms at Mrs. 
Mclntyre's, where I hope to join them soon. Mr. Paige went 
to Boston yesterday. As soon as he shall be able to return, 
which I think will be in a few days, I shall return to Washington, if Mrs. Webster remains as comfortable as at present. 
I am, my dear Sir, with most true regard, yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

P. S. Mr. Clay's address seems to meet with universal approbation. 
MB. WEBSTER TO MR. SJLSBEE. 

New York, January 8, 1828. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for your letter of the 4th, and for 
the friendly manner in which you applied for my leave of absence. 

Mrs. Webster remains essentially the same as when 1 wrote 
you last, except that I think she had not quite so comfortable a 
night last night. * * * 

Of the three physicians who have attended her here, (Dr. Perkins, Dr. Post, and Dr. Hosack,) the former only thinks he ever 
saw such a case before. A description of it, made out by Dr. 
Perkins, has been sent to Dr. Physick, and also to Dr. Nathan 
Smith of New Haven, for their opinion and advice. I have 
written an urgent letter to Dr. Warren, to come to New York, 
to consult with the physicians here. 

My own health is mending, and if we could have a little clear 
weather, I think I should soon be well. 

We have no news here. The thick weather is supposed to 
have kept back the packets. That of November 24, is not yet 
arrived. Yours very truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 

P. S. I suppose Judge Story will be with you nearly as soon 
as you receive this, unless he stopped in Philadelphia. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

New York, January 8, 1828, 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I came here from Washington on Friday 
the 4th. There are so many friends to write to on the subject 
of Mrs. Webster's health, that I fear I may neglect some ; and 
hardly know how long it is since I wrote you. William, however, has written occasionally to his friends in your vicinity. 

I cannot say any thing new in regard to Mrs. Webster. Her 
case is most serious. It is one of rare occurrence ; no physician 

here, but Dr. Perkins, thinking he ever saw one like it. The 
tumor has not yet broke out, but threatens it, and will, doubtless, soon. Its character will be then better known, and I fear the 
worst. Dr. Nathan Smith, Dr. Physick, &c. have been written to 
for opinions and advice ; and I have written an urgent letter to 
Dr. Warren to come here. After all, the case is very much out 
of the reach of medical application, or surgical aid. The 
tumor is so large, so situated, embracing so many muscles, 
nerves, and blood vessels, that an operation is not to be thought 
of. Internal remedies do not reach it, and external applications 
have little effect. The result must be left with Providence ; but 
you must be prepared to learn the worst. For three or four 
days, she has been more free from pain than for some time before ; but yesterday she was a good deal distressed again. 
William Paige went home the day I came. He thinks he can 
return in a week or ten days, and stay till I make a visit to the 
court at Washington, if Mrs. Webster should be so as to allow 
of my leaving her. You will, of course, riot alarm your wife and 
Mrs. Kelly, and Nancy, too much in regard to Grace. There is 
yet a hope; but I have thought it best to tell you my real 
opinion. 

My own health has suffered from continued colds and catarrhs. 
Though not quite well even yet, I have no dangerous or bad 
symptoms. I feel no inflammation of the lungs, or soreness of the 
chest, nor any febrile symptoms. An epidemic cold is all about 
here, and I partake in it ; but it appears to be getting better, and 
I have no doubt that two or three clear days would finish it. 
Julia and Edward are pretty well ; they go to school. Grace 
and the children desire their best love to Mrs. Webster and the 
little girls, as well as to you. 

Yours always truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

New York, January 15, 1828. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for your kind and friendly letter, 
and wish I could feel justified in confirming those favorable 
hopes which your friendship leads you to form, in regard to my 
VOL. i. 37 
sick wife. Would to God I were able to encourage my own 
hopes, and yours also. But I fear, greatly fear, that Providence 
has not so ordered it. Although she is better one day than 
another, that is, more comfortable, more free from severe pain, 
yet I do not see any material change in that which has occasioned her illness. The tumor remains as hard and unmanageable as ever. It seems altogether beyond the reach of human 
art. Nothing removes, nothing softens it. In the mean time, 
so much pain and illness begin to affect the general health, and 
some indications appear of what I have all along feared, since 
I formed any notion of the disease, of an affection produced by 
it on the chest and lungs. For the last two days there has been 
less of acute pain in the limb, but more of stiffness and numbness ; I mean in the whole limb below the tumor. She has 
complained also of weakness of the breast, and manifested considerable difficulty in breathing. Large glandular swellings 
appear also in other parts of the body, especially about the abdomen. On the whole, though there is less of suffering, I think 
the danger is plainly increased. The tumor itself has not yet 
broken through the skin, and does not look quite so much threatening to-day as it did yesterday. 

After ah 1 , my dear Sir, we have a ray of hope. I try to keep up 
my courage, and to strengthen hers ; but it is due to our friendship that I tell you the whole truth. I have endeavored to prepare myself for that event of all others the most calamitous to 
me and to my children. 

I thank you for your advice as to myself, and shall certainly 
follow it. In all probability, I shall stay here for some time yet. 
I fear circumstances will not be such as that I can leave, even 
after Mr. Paige comes, nor am I very anxious to do so. There 
seems nothing important in Congress ; and I must try to make 
some arrangement of my business in court. 

My health, though not entirely confirmed, is daily improving. 
I have the remnant of an epidemical cold, a little loose cough and 
catarrh ; no soreness of breast, nor inflammation of the lungs, 
nor any feverish tendency. Be assured, my dear Sir, I shall 
take all possible care of my own health. 

Ten o'clock p. M. Mrs. Webster is now asleep, and is free 
from severe pain, but breathes not easily. She is a good deal 
inclined to sleep. I leave a space to tell you how she may be 
in the morning. 

Wednesday morning, eight o'clock. Mrs. Webster passed 
rather a comfortable night. She had less cough than I apprehended, and seems calm and quiet this morning. She thinks 
she breathes a little easier than yesterday. Her voice is faint, 
but natural in its tones. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

New York, January 17, 1828. 

MY DEAR BROTHER, I cannot give you any favorable news 
respecting my wife. She is no better, and I fear is daily 
growing weaker. She is now exceedingly feeble. Dr. Perkins 
thinks she has altered very much the last three or four days. 

The prospect nearly confounds me ; but I hope to meet the 
event with submission to the will of God. 

I expect Mr. Paige to-morrow morning. He or I will write 
you again, soon. 

Yours affectionately, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



Monday Morning, January 21. 

DEAR BROTHER, Mrs. Webster still lives, but is evidently 
near her end. We did not expect her continuance yesterday, 
from hour to hour. 

Yours affectionately, 

D. W. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Monday Morning, 9 o'clock. 

MY DEAR SIR, Mrs. Webster still lives, but cannot possibly 
remain long with us. We expected her decease yesterday, from 
hour to hour. 

I received Mrs. Mason's letter, but could not communicate it. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 
DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Monday, i past 2 o'clock. 

DEAR BROTHER, Poor Grace has gone to Heaven. She haa 
now just breathed her last breath. 

I shall go with her forthwith to Boston, and on receipt of 
this, I hope you will come there if you can. 

I shall stay there some days. May God bless you and yours, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. LEE. 

Monday, i past 2 o'clock. 

MY DEAR ELIZA, The scene is ended, and Mrs. Webster has 
gone to God. She has just breathed her last breath. How she 
died, with what cheerfulness and submission, with what hopes 
and what happiness, how kindly she remembered her friends, 
and how often and how affectionately she spoke of you, I 
hope soon to be able to tell you ; till then, adieu. 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. We shall all proceed immediately to Boston. 



MRS. LEE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Tuesday Morning, January 22, 1828. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Before this reaches you, our beloved 
friend must be beyond the want of our care or our alleviations. 
She is happy ! Oh, that we might soon go to meet her, where 
1 lii-re is no more sorrow. I should not write to you at such a 
moment, for I know that the deepest sympathy cannot lessen 
your affliction, but I wish to ask you to let the children come 
to me, when you think best to send them to Boston ; and to let 
Julia remain with me, as long as it is agreeable to you and to 
her. My husband joins in this request. My dear friend once 

said to me, that if she should be called to leave her children, she 
should feel happy in leaving them to my care. But this might 
have been the feeling of the moment, and you know, my dear 
friend, her last wishes on this subject. If I can in any way 
lessen your cares on this account or any other, you know my 
heart and you will trust to it. Poor Daniel, I fear, did not 
reach New York to see his mother. Give my love to the 
children, and to William. He must feel this very much. When 
I think of you and of them, my own loss seems as nothing ; but 
I feel that it is irreparable, and that no one else can fill the 
place to me. 

I am always yours, 

ELIZA LEE.

SKETCH 

OF MRS. G. F. WEBSTER BY MRS. E. BUCKMINSTER LEE. 

January 23, 1856. 

Mv DEAR FLETCHER, I very gladly comply with your request, 
to furnish you with some memorials of your mother and of your 
sister Grace, in order to assist your too early and indistinct recollection of those precious relatives; for although they are to 
me beings of the shadowy past, they can never fade from their 
place in my memory, where the individuality and beauty of 
their characters are as fresh as when retouched every day by 
their presence. And indeed, to borrow the thought of another, 
when the precious memories of youth revive, the present seems 
to vanish and become indistinct, and the long past to be the 
only reality. 

But it will be impossible for me to think or speak of your 
mother apart from the relation she held to your father. Her 
being was inwrought with his. The tender and silken thread of 
her life was inwoven with his " purple and gold." She not only 
lived in his shadow, but her pulses seemed to " beat double " 
with his and her life. 

My earliest recollection of your father is when he came to 
Portsmouth in 1808 to open his law office. His appearance 
was very striking. Slender, and apparently of delicate organization, his large eyes and massive brow seemed very predominant 
above the other features, which were sharply cut, refined, and 
delicate. The paleness of his complexion was heightened by 
hair as black as the raven's wing. 

I will mention a little anecdote connected with his first appearance. He had arrived in Portsmouth at the close of the 
week, and the next day being Sunday, the sexton, as was the 
custom in those days, introduced the stranger to the minister's 
pew. My eldest sister was at church, and when she came home 

she said " there had been a remarkable person in the pew with 
her, that he riveted her attention, and that she was sure he had 
a most marked character for good or for evil." After a short 
time we became acquainted with Mr. Webster, and tt ere was 
no longer a problem connected with him. 

Mr. Webster took lodgings very near our house, and we soon 
saw enough of him to appreciate in some degree, young as we 
were, his extraordinary genius, and the noble qualities of his 
character. The genial and exceedingly rich humor that he so 
often exhibited, was perhaps at this time more prized by us 
than any other of the diversified talents we admired in him. 
He soon formed a circle around him of which he was the life 
and soul. We young people saw him only rarely in friendly 
visits. I well remember one afternoon that he came in, when 
the elders of the family were absent. He sat down by the 
window, and as now and then an inhabitant of the small town 
passed through the street, his fancy was caught by their appearance and his imagination excited, and he improvised the most 
humorous imaginary histories about them, which would have 
furnished a rich treasure for Dickens, could he have been the 
delighted listener, instead of the young girl for whose amusement this wealth of invention was expended. Hon. Mr. Mason 
of Portsmouth, who delighted in the rich humor so often displayed by Mr. Webster, used to say, " that there was never such 
an actor lost to the stage as he would have made had he chosen 
to turn his talents in that direction." 

My father, Dr. Buckminster, took the liveliest interest in Mr. 
Webster, and as he remarked at this time the apparent frailty 
of his constitution, he urged upon his young friend his sure 
remedy for slight indisposition. This was half an hour of 
wood-sawing before breakfast, with a long two-handed saw, 
himself holding the end opposite to that of his young friend. 
We young people were always delighted when this strong 
medicine was taken before breakfast, for however disagreeable 
in itself, Mr. Webster appeared at our breakfast afterwards with 
his genial humor unimpaired. 

The following June your father left Portsmouth for a visit, 
as we thought, to his native place, without communicating, 
previously, a word of his intention. He did not come back 
alone ; and, with no change in the domestic arrangements, the 
wife he brought with him added the charm of her presence to 

our society. 

Grace Fletcher was the daughter of the Rev. Elijah Fletcher 
of Hop,unton, New Hampshire. The clergy of New Hampshire were at that time a class of superior men. It was before 
the parishes had been rent asunder and divided into a multitude 
of religions sects, and, together with the rest of the clergy of 
New England, they included in their ranks, men, who in 
any age would have been marked for their talents and learning. 
Living as they did, with the frugal simplicity characteristic of 
the early days of New England, without worldly possessions, 
they were every where honored as guides in religious faith, and 
as the guardians of the best interests of society. It is true that 
the cultivation of the female intellect scarcely entered into the 
range of their duties, yet their daughters could not dwell, even 
in the atmosphere of their scanty libraries, or listen to the conversation of their clerical visitors, without attaining a certain 
mental development ; and the desire for improvement was then 
answered by the best authors of England, rather than with the 
miscellaneous ephemera of the circulating library. Mrs. Webster's mind was naturally of a high order, and whatever was 
the degree of culture she received, it fitted her to be the chosen 
companion and the trusted friend of her gifted husband. 

She was sincerely and deeply religious, and to this divinely 
operating principle was it to be attributed that she was never 
elated, never thrown off the balance of her habitual composure, 
by the singular early success of her husband, and the applause 
constantly following him. I remember a remark of the Rev. 
Dr. Parker of Portsmouth, " that it was a striking peculiarity of 
Mrs. Webster that she was always equal to all occasions ; that 
she appeared with the same quiet dignity and composed selfpossession in the drawing-room in Washington, as in her own 
quiet parlor ;" it was only when an unexpected burst of applause 
followed some noble effort of her husband, that the quickened 
pulse* sent the blood to her heart, and the tear started to her 
eye. Uniting with great sweetness of disposition, unaffected, 
frank and winning manners, you will readily believe that no 
>n<- could approach your mother without wishing to know her, 
and no one could know her well, without loving her. 

When Mr. Webster had brought this interesting companion 

to Portsmouth, the circle that gathered around them became 
more intimate and was held by more powerful attractions. 
There certainty was never a more charming room, than the lowroofed, simple parlor, where, relieved from the cares of business, 
in the full gayety of his disposition, he gave himself up to relaxation. 

Those who only knew Mr. Webster in the later years of his 
life can never believe how gracefully, and with what infinite 
humor he could lend himself to the amusement of the hour. 
There were other evenings given to more serious occupation, 
when he would read parts of the plays of Shakspeare to a circle 
of young friends, or keep them enchained by the eloquent charm 
of his own conversation. 

The happiness of these Portsmouth days was within two 
years increased by the birth of a daughter, who bore her mother's 
name. I can hardly trust myself to speak of this child, so little 
to be relied on are the reports of precocious children. But as 
I recall some of the peculiarities of this little girl, she certainly 
appears, at three and four years old, wonderfully intelligent, and 
a most agreeable companion. There was no one so much in 
demand as the little Grace; her mother's friends constantly 
sending for her, and delighting themselves with her sweet simplicity, and, if such an expression can be allowed, her infantile 
sagacity. 

Her young soul seemed to dwell very near the author of her 
being. Her mother once said to a friend, " I wish I could feel 
the presence of God as little Grace seems to feel it. Not only 
did " Heaven lie about her in her infancy," but she knew that 
God was always near her. 

Another peculiarity was the tenderness she felt for the poor 
and unhappy. Beggars were frequent at this time. There 
were few relief societies, and begging from door to door was not 
forbidden. Grace would never consent that an asker of charity 
should be sent away empty. She would bring them herself 
into the house, see that their wants were supplied, comfort them 
with the ministration of her own little hands, and the tender 
compassion of her large gray eyes. If her mother ever refused, 
those eyes would fill with tears, and she would urge their requests so perseveringly that there was no resisting her. 

But God's hand soon beckoned her away. Her parents in 



H-2 PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF 

th' mean time had left Portsmouth for their residence in Boston, 
and Mr. Webster had gone the second time from New Hampshire to serve a session in Congress, when that insidious 
disease, to which delicate organizations so often become a prey, 
began to impair the health of the little Grace. The progress of 
the disease was so rapid, that her parents had only time to 
hasten from Washington to their house in Boston, where their 
child, whose short life had been lived, as it were, on the threshold of heaven, passed with gentle and painless steps within 
the veil which hides from us the great mysteries of the future. 
Grace woke from a sweet sleep, and asked for her father. He 
was instantly called, and placing his arm beneath her, he drew 
her towards him, when a smile of singular love and sweetness 
passed over her countenance and her life was gone. Mr. Webster turned away from the bed, and great tears coursed down 
his cheeks. I have three times seen this great man weep convulsively. Another time was when death deprived him of that 
brother, so tenderly loved, with whom, as we learn from the 
autobiography, and from his own lips, there was so close a 
union, that till both of them had families which drew them 
from each other, there had been between them but one aim, one 
purse, one welfare, and one hope. 

Mr. Webster says in his autobiography, that after he had 
finished his session in Congress from New Hampshire, he came 
to Boston and gave himself with diligence to the business of 
his profession. 

He was now thirty-five years old, and certainly in the perfection of all the powers of body and mind. The majestic beauty 
of his countenance was never more striking than at this period. 
There is a miniature taken at this time which gives a most 
agreeable impression of his features, but which those who knew 
him only in the later years of his life, would hardly accept as 
a perfect likeness. The noble expansive brow, and deep set 
melancholy eyes, do justice to those features ; but the tender, 
flexible lips, although expressing the sweetness of his character 
at that period of his life, have not the expression of intense 
firmness, which afterwards gave such character to his countenance. 

As I had the privilege of being often a visitor in his family, a 
recapitulation of the course of his every day life may be more 
interesting to you than any thing else. 

Mr. Webster was always an early riser. There is an eloquent 
letter which expresses his true feeling upon the influence of the 
morning hours. Like most of the great and good men we read 
of, the hours of the early morning were the most cheerful of the 
day. The drowsy in his own house were awoke by his joyous 
voice singing some cheerful carol, such as, 

" The east is bright with morning light." 
" Uprose the king of men with speed," &c. 

At breakfast, before the cares of business began, he was 
cheerful but thoughtful, courteous and genial towards every one ; 
listening to the prattle of the children, and kindly attentive to 
all their little requests. When he returned, at two or three 
o'clock, weary from the courts, or from his office, the promptly 
ready service of Hannah, a woman who had been in his family 
many years, was always welcome. She knew the sound of the 
door when opened by Mr. Webster, and it was scarcely closed 
before she was at his side. He was dependent upon services 
prompted by affection, and loved those spontaneous offerings 
which came from the heart. 

After dinner, Mr. Webster would throw himself upon the sofa, 
and then was seen the truly electrical attraction of his character. 
Every person in the room was drawn immediately into his 
sphere. The children squeezing themselves into all possible 
places and postures upon the sofa, in order to be close to him ; 
Mrs. Webster sitting by his side, and the friend in the house, or 
social visitor, only too happy to join in the circle. All this 
was not from invitation to the children; he did nothing to 
amuse them, he told them no stories; it was the irresistible 
attraction of his character, the charm of his illumined countenance, from which beamed indulgence and kindness to every 
one of his family. In the evening, if visitors came in, Mr. 
Webster was too much exhausted to take a very active part in 
conversation. He had done a large amount of work before 
others were awake in the morning, and in the evening he was 
ready for that sweet sleep which " God gives to his beloved." 

At the period I now speak of, the children of Mr. and Mrs. 
Webster were four. The youngest, Charles, was taken from 
them in the winter of 1825. This lovely child, at three years 
old, indicated singular attractiveness of mind and character. 
His illness was short, and had hardly impaired the fresh beauty 
of his countenance ; but shortly after his death, when the round 
contour of the cheeks had a little fallen away, his face and 
head were like a perfect miniature cast of his father. No 
marble bust can ever present a more perfect likeness of his 
noble father. 

Mrs. Webster was the most tender of mothers. Many persons thought, that devoted as she was to her husband and 
children, the whole tenderness of her nature was absorbed by 
her home and its exacting duties. It was not so. She had 
much to give to many. She loved to collect around her a small 
number of intimate friends, when, without form, or etiquette, 
they could enjoy the pleasure of each other's society. Mr. 
Webster never appeared so truly charming as when thus the 
centre of a circle of intimate and trusted friends. 

I would fain linger a little longer upon the memory of your 
mother, and upon those bright and happy years before the 
clouds gathered, and that fatal disease began to show itself, 
which made all those who loved her tremble. 

But while they trembled she was firm, and those lessons of 
faith and submission, which in her days of joy she had learned 
with Christian docility, were now to be tried and tested, and 
they did not fail. She had determined to go with her husband 
in the winter of 1828 to Washington, but her disease made 
such fearful progress, that she was arrested in New York; 
where in the midst of devoted friends, with husband and 
children around her, she passed beyond the reach of our 
affection, but forever followed by tender regrets and blessed 
memories,

MR. JUSTICE STORY TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 27, 1828. 

MY DEAR SIR, I received in the course of the mail your 
letter announcing the melancholy news of the death of Mrs. 
Webster. It has sunk Mrs. Story and myself in deep affliction. 
And prepared as we were for the heavy intelligence, it yet 
came, at last, with a most distressing power over our minds. 
We do, indeed, most sincerely and entirely from our whole 
hearts sympathize with you, and partake largely of your 
sorrows. We have long considered Mrs. Webster one of our 
best and truest friends, and. indeed, as standing to us almost in 
the relation of a sister. We have known her excellent qualities, 
her kindness of heart, her generous feelings, her mild and conciliatory temper, her warm and elevated affections, her constancy, purity, and piety, and her noble disinterestedness, and 
excellent sense. Such a woman, and such a friend, must be at 
all times a most severe loss, and to us, at our age, is irreparable ; 
we can scarcely hope to form many new friendships, and our 
hope, our dearest hope, was to retain what we had. We have 
so hoped in vain. I can say with Young, in deep humiliation 
of soul, 

" Our dying friends come o'er us like a cloud, 

To damp our brainless ardor, and abate 

That glare of life, which sometimes blinds the wise." 

Of the loss to you, I can and ought to say nothing. I know 
that if we suffer, your sorrows must be unspeakable. And I 
can only pray God to aid you by His consolations and to suggest to you, that, after your first agony is over, her virtues and 
your own admirable devotion to her cannot but be sources of 
the most soothing recollection to you. I know well that we 
may do mischief by intermeddling with a heart wounded by 
grief ; and it must be left to itself to recover its powers, and to 
soften its anguish. What some of us think of the dead, you 
may read in the National Intelligencer of Saturday. 

In going to Boston, and attending the funeral obsequies, I 
entirely agree with your own judgment. I should have done 
the same under the like circumstances, as most appropriate to 
VOL. i. 38 
my own feelings and to public propriety. We have in spirit 
followed your wife to the grave with you. 

I do not urge your immediate return here. But yet, having 
been a like sufferer, I can say, that the great secret of comfort 
must be sought, so far as human aid can go, in employment. 
It requires effort and sacrifices, but it is the only specific remedy 
against unavailing and wasting sorrow; that canker which eats 
into the heart, and destroys its vitality. If you will therefore 
allow me to advise, it would be that you should return here aa 
soon as you can gather up your strength, and try professional 
and public labors. Endeavor to wear off that spirit of despondency which you cannot but feel, and which you will scarcely 
feel any inclination to resist. Saying this, I have said all that 
I ought, and I know that you can understand what is best, 
better than I can prescribe. 

Mrs. Story desires her most affectionate regards to you and 
the children, and I join in them, being always affectionately, 

Your friend, 

JOSEPH STORY. 



MR. WEBSTER TO DR. PERKINS. 

Boston, Monday, January 28, 1828. 

MY DEAR SIR, You have learned by Mr. Paige's letter, that 
we reached Boston on Friday evening, and on Saturday committed Mrs. Webster's remains to the tomb. We used the occasion to bring into our own tomb the coffin containing the 
remains of our daughter Grace, who died January 23, 1817. 
My dear wife now lies with her oldest and her youngest ; and I 
hope it may please God, when my own appointed hour comes, 
that I may rest by her side. 

Mrs. Bryant came immediately to see me and the children, 
and manifests the kindest sympathy in the calamity which has 
befallen us. She is an excellent woman, and one whom Mrs. 
Webster very much regarded and loved. All our friends have 
received us with a sincerity of condolence and sympathy which 
we can never forget. The children are well. Daniel will resume 
his usual residence and occupation in a day or two. Mrs. Lee, 
(Eliza Buckrainster,) Mrs. Ticknor, Mrs. Hall, Mrs. Appleton, 

and others, have offered, in the most friendly manner, to take 
care of Julia and Edward, for the winter. We have not yet 
decided how we shall dispose of them. 

I pray you to give my most affectionate regards to Mrs. Perkins. I never can express how much I feel indebted to her 
kindness and friendship. If Mrs. Webster had been her sister, 
she could have done no more. 

In a few days, I intend to set out for Washington. If there 
should come a flight of snow, so as to make sleighing, I shall 
immediately improve the occasion to get over the hills to New 
Haven. I am, dear Sir, most truly, 

Yours, always, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, January 29, 1828. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for your kind letter of yesterday. 
It would give me great pleasure to see you, but I do not expect 
you to make a journey hither, at this season. I know also that 
your engagements must be pressing. I am at present at Mr. 
Blake's, with the children. My brother came down yesterday. 
It is my purpose to stay till towards the end of this week, or to 
the first of next, according to the weather, and then proceed 
South. My own health is pretty good, although I feel in some 
measure fatigued and exhausted. I shall travel slowly, and 
must necessarily stay two or three days in New York. 

As to my children, I think I shall dispose of them in this 
town for the present, without inconvenience. Daniel is perfectly well disposed of where he is. Mrs. Lee (Eliza B.) lays 
claim to Julia, of right, and would be glad of Edward ; also, Mrs. 
Ticknor, Mrs. Hale, Mrs. Appleton, and others, have kindly 
offered to take them. I feel a reluctance to separate these two 
little ones, but still incline to think the best thing will be to let 
Julia go to Mrs. Lee's, and turn Edward, for the winter, into 
Mrs. Kale's little flock. 

As far as I have thought at all on my future arrangements, 
my inclination is to make no more change in my course and 
mode of life than the event necessarily produces. 

I think I shall leave orders to have the furniture put up, in 
the house, with a view of taking home the children when I return, and, with the aid of Mr. Paige, keeping the family together. 
Except, perhaps, that it may be best that Julia should stay 
principally with Eliza, or in some other family, where there is a 
lady. Very probably both the little children may pass the summer at their uncle's. 

I pray you give my most affectionate remembrance to Mrs. 
Mason. Mrs. Webster spoke of her often, and always with the 
strongest sentiments of esteem and affection. Her last letter 
was received, I think, before Mrs. Webster's death ; but when 
she was not in a condition to read it, or hear it. 

In regard to this calamity, my dear Sir, I feel that every thing 
has conspired to alleviate, as far as possible, the effects of the 
calamity itself. All was done that could be done ; the kindness 
of friends had no bounds ; and it is now continued, also, towards 
me and the children. The manner of the death too, was, in all 
respects, such as her dearest friends would have wished. 
Adieu, my dear Sir, 

Yours, always truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO FLETCHER WEBSTER. 

Senate Chamber, Tuesday, February 17, 1828. 

MY DEAR SON, I have received a letter from you to-day, before I have found time to answer your last. That gave me 
singular pleasure, as it contained a very gratifying report from 
Mr. LrviTTtt. I have nothing more at heart, my dear son, than 
your success and welfare, and the cultivation of your talents 
and virtues. You will be, in the common course of things, 
coming into artivr life, when, if I live so long, I shall be already 
an old man, and shall have little left in life but my children, and 
their hopes and happiness. In contemplation of these things, I 
look with the most affectionate anxiety upon your progress, con


DANIEL WEBSTEK. 449 

sidering the present as a most critical and important period in 
your life. 

Such reports as that last received, give me good spirits ; and 
I doubt not, my dear son, that the consciousness that your good 
conduct and respectable progress in your class, and among your 
fellows, gives me pleasure, will stimulate your affectionate heart, 
with other motives, to earnest and assiduous endeavors to excel. I pray Heaven to bless you and prosper you. 

At present my time is exceedingly occupied between the 
Senate and the court, and I suppose it will continue so to be, 
till the 3d of March. It is very cold here ; much the severest 
winter I ever experienced at Washington. 

Yours, most affectionately, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. HADDOCK TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Dartmouth College, March 12, 1828. 

MY DEAR UNCLE, My last interview with you was a painful 
one, more painful than I can express. But I did not feel at 
liberty to revive in your mind ideas and feelings which had 
already but too much oppressed you. In your loss I suffered 
deeply ; in all your sorrows I was afflicted. To that dear aunt 
I had long cherished a fond attachment. Her sickness I did not 
suppose so severe, or so dangerous as it really was, until just before 
the intelligence of her death arrived. I received it at Concord. 
It was too late for me to reach Boston, before the funeral solemnities. It would have been grateful to my feelings to have 
joined in the sacred duty to one so dear to me, and of whose 
kind regard I had received so many demonstrations. How pleasant, how inexpressibly precious, in the seasons of reflection upon 
this event, is the conviction, which we cherish, that she is as 
the " angels of God which are in heaven." It takes away the 
keenest sting of affliction. It may be unjust to the society of 
the Saviour, and the communion with God, in which the sacred 
writers place so much of the happiness of heaven, but I cannot 
resist the feeling excited anew by every victory of death among 
38* 
my Christian friends, that we shall derive no inconsiderable part 
of our eternal happiness from the renewal of earthly friendships. 
I know not why this feeling should strengthen as I grow older, 
unless it may possibly be, that the heart feels more sensibly its 
dependence upon the few whom nature, or youthful love, has 
bound to us, as death rapidly narrows the little circle. It may 
seem misanthropic, I know not that it is common or just, but, 
though not greatly disappointed, indeed, on the whole, remarkably favored by the approbation of those whose approbation I 
have sought, I have a horror of depending for my social happiness 
on persons to whom I have felt no natural ties, and with whom 
I have formed no early habits of affection. So that I feel, when 
a friend dies, that another hold on life is broken, another reason 
for wishing to live, removed. Could I feel, in my own heart, in 
the same proportion, prepared to meet death, and the momentous 
scenes after it, it would give me the truest joy. I hope, dear 
uncle, that on this subject you have obtained a state of mind, 
for which I look, but which I have imperfectly, if at all, enjoyed. 
I am satisfied from the cases of Job, Joshua, Stephen, Paul, and 
others, and from the strong language of the New Testament, 
that there must be a strong Christian faith and confidence attainable. It is worthy of the heart's desire and prayer. 

With sentiments of the highest respect and affection, I am, 
dear uncle, Your nephew, 

CHARLES B. HADDOCK. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 



Washington, Sunday Evening, 1828. 

DEAR WILLIAM, I found divers letters of yours here yesterday, and have another to-day ; for all which I thank you. A 
lin<; from you, as often as you can write one, will always give 
me pleasure and satisfaction. I sometimes feel as if I were 
troubling you too much, with so much care of the children, and 
so much attention to my concerns. But I trust you will not 
suffer me to wear out your patience and kindness. Notwithstanding the blessed spirit that has so long been the common 

bond of union between us, is now on earth no more, you will 
ever be to me one of the nearest and dearest objects in life ; 
nearer and dearer, indeed, from this very calamity. Enough ! 

I find Judge Story and his wife very well. Mrs. Story has 
had the company of Mrs. Laurence, and has not been therefore , 
lonely. But, alas ! it is not such a winter as she promised herself. I have not been out of the house to-day. A great many 
people have been to see me. To-morrow, I shall probably go 
into court. Yours, dear William, 

Most faithfully, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 

Wednesday Evening, Washington, 1828. 

DEAR WILLIAM, I have received to-day your letter of Saturday, which makes me feel a good deal better. I have seldom 
been five days before without hearing from home ; and although 
I have lost what mainly made home dear to me, there is yet 
that in it which I love more than all things else in the world. I 
could not get along without cherishing the feeling that I have 
a home notwithstanding the shock I have received. You must 
try to make the children write, when you cannot, so that I may 
hear from some of you ; one every two or three days at least. 

This morning was devoted to General Brown's funeral ; and 
I went into court at one o'clock. For some days to come, 
indeed, as long as the court continues, I expect no leisure. Time 
has been when I should not have cared much about it ; and as 
it is, I shall get through somehow or other. Mr. Belknap will 
not be tried probably till next week. 

The arrangement you suggested some time ago, as to the 
children's all dining with you on Sunday, and occasionally with 
our other friends, pleases me very well. I hope they* are happy. 
Edward, I am sure, is as well off as he can be, and since you 
cannot spare him, I am content he should remain where he is. 

Eiley's trunk is here. I shall send it the very first opportunity. 
He will receive it, I trust, in a week or two. I am sorry to hear 
Mary is sick, and hope her illness will not be of long duration. 
Remember me kindly to Mr. Blake. I would write him if I 
had time to-night, but must put it off for a day or two. 

Give my love to all the children. I wish I had one of them 

here. 

Good-night. D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. B. B. LEE. 

Washington, March 15, 1828. 

DEAR ELIZA, I return you Mr. Parker's letter, which I have 
read, as you may well suppose, with great pleasure. Nothing 
is more soothing and balmy to my feelings, than to dwell on the 
recollection of my dear wife, and to hear others speak of her, 
who knew her and loved her. My heart holds on by this thread, 
as if it were by means of it to retain her yet here. Mr. and 
Mrs. Parker were always kind to us, and are among those 
Portsmouth friends whom time f nd distance never separated 
from our acquaintance and affection. Mrs. Webster had very 
high esteem for them both. 

I hear from Mr. Paige, and from Julia, and from Edward, that 
you are well. Julia has told me all about your party, and how 
long she sat up. I hear from others, as well as herself, that she 
is happy as possible under the protection of your care and kindness. You will love her, I know, for her mother's sake, and I 
hope for her own also ; and I trust she will make herself agreeable to your husband. You are kind enough to say, that 
concern for Julia need not lead me to forbear any purpose 
which I might otherwise have, of crossing the water. It would 
be unpleasant, certainly,- to leave the children, and especially a 
little girl of Julia's age, but I should not feel uneasy about her 
at all, while under your guardianship. There are other considerations, however, which are well to be weighed before I am 
water-borne. Even if what you allude to were supposed to be 
at my own option, and however desirable it might be in itself, 
times and circumstances may nevertheless be such as " give me 
pause." This is all I can say about it at present; except that 
I am now too old to do any thing in a hurry. I believe this is 
almost the only time that I have alluded to the subject, to any 

one ; and would not wish to be quoted as having said one word 
respecting it. 

Mrs. Story left us the day before yesterday. The Judge goes 
in a day or two. I shall be sorry to lose him, though quite 
willing to have the court break up. 

I have a very kind letter indeed from Mrs. Everett, respecting 
the name of her youngest daughter ; I wish uncle would carry 
Julia out to see her. 

Is your husband a document reader? I should be glad to 
send him some of our papers, speeches, &c., but have been 
afraid he would vote it a bore. Pray give my love to him, and 
believe me, as 

Ever yours, DAN'L WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 20, 1828. 

DEAR BROTHER, I wrote you yesterday. The object of this 
is more private and personal. I want you to tell me what you 
think best for the administration, and for me in relation to a 
subject upon which the newspapers continue to be loquacious. 1 
Give your advice without favor or affection, and as a man 
who is " looking before and after." 

Yours, as always, 

DAN'L WEBSTER 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Washington, March 21, 1828. 

MY DEAR NEPHEW, I thank you for your kind and affectionate letter, and assure you its suggestions are all in strict 
accordance with my own feelings. It does not appear to me 
unreasonable to believe that the friendships of this life are perpetuated in heaven. Flesh and blood, indeed, cannot inherit 
the kingdom of God ; but I know not why that which constitutes a pure source of happiness on earth, individual affection 
and love, may not survive the tomb. Indeed, is not the prin
1 A report that Mr. Webster was to be sent minister to England. 
ciple of happiness to the sentient being essentially the same in 
heaven and on earth ? The love of God and of the good beings 
whom he has created, and the admiration of the material 
universe which he has formed, can there be other sources of 
happiness than these to the human mind, unless it is to alter 
its whole structure *nd character ? And again, it may be asked 
how can this world be rightly called a scene of probation and 
discipline, if these affections, which we are commanded to 
cherish and cultivate here, are to leave us on the threshold of 
the other world ? These views and many others, would seem 
to lead to the belief that earthly affections, purified and exalted, 
are fit to carry with us to the abode of the blessed. Yet it must 
be confessed, that there are some things in the New Testament 
which may possibly countenance a different conclusion. The 
words of our Saviour, especially in regard to the woman who 
had seven husbands, deserve deep reflection. I am free to confess that some descriptions of heavenly happiness are so ethereal 
and sublimated as to fill me with a strange sort of terror. Even 
that which you quote, that our departed friends " are as the 
angels of God," penetrates my soul with a dreadful emotion. 
Like an angel of God, indeed, I hope she is, in purity, in happiness, and in immortality ; but I would fain hope, that in kind 
remembrance of those she has left ; in a lingering human sympathy and human love, she may yet be as God originally 
created her, a little lower than the angels. 

My dear nephew, I cannot pursue these thoughts nor turn 
back to see what I have written. 

Adieu, D. W. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 23, 1828. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I have received yours of the 17th, and am 
glad you propose to write Governor Bell. If you have not 
already done so when you receive this, lose no time in accomplishing your purpose. 

I cannot listen for a moment to what you say about not being 
a candidate. I never shall consent to your declining, if you have 
a fair opportunity. Be assured it will do you much good to be 

here a year or two, and you will lose nothing by it. I beg of 
you by no means to come to a different conclusion, at least till 
I come home. 

The New Hampshire election has produced vastly more impression here than I had expected from it. It seems quite 
certain that a pretty strong confidence of success was entertained by General Jackson's friends. I was told to-day that Mr. 
Harvey, shortly since, expressed the strongest belief that New 
Hampshire would go for the military candidate. 

I send you to-day, a militia document. The preface and 
notes, &c., are understood to have been drawn up by Mr. Storrs, 
though I suppose if this be so, it it intended to be kept private. 
I think you will find it a thing to make the people think ; I 
shall send you several copies. 

We need much a list of names, in Mr. Harvey's district, of 
intelligent people, to whom this and other documents can be 
sent. Who is there in Warren, Sutton, Fisherville, Hancock, 
Henniker, &c. &c., to whom the New Hampshire members 
might send something calculated to enlighten the people and 
to give them the truth ? I really feel it a duty to give the 
people light, in regard to the present state of public affairs. 

We have every reason to think the tide has turned in New 
York, and is setting the other way with prodigious force. Something of the same nature is visible in Kentucky. Depend upon 
it, with proper exertions, we may yet save the country. 

Yours, always truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. I am anxious for your answer to my last. 



BZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

March 31, 1828. 

DEAR DANIEL, I have written Governor Bell to-day. I have 
stated to him my opinion of our present condition. It is the 
best opinion I can form. I suggested to him both the importance and necessity that our representatives in Congress should 
make an address to the people of this State under their own 
signatures. They should speak out. Something of this kind 
is certainly needed. It should be published in a pamphlet form 
of thirty thousand copies at least. The people want information, light, knowledge of the character and measures of the 
administration. 

I may say to you what I may to no person here, we cannot 
carry the election next November without the greatest exertions. 
Bold and manly measures only can defeat the Jackson party in 
this State. It is necessary that every man should put into the 
support of the good cause all his talents, all his personal character, personal influence, and exertions. The contest must be 
made to resemble the ancient battle, where every man grapples 
with his adversary. The crisis is extraordinary. The contest 
is extraordinary. Both the crisis and the contest call for extraordinary efforts. Let our representatives give us the example ; 
let them make an appeal to the good sense of the people and 
warn us of our dangers. Let them lead, and there will be enough 
to follow. The public sentiment, enlightened and informed by 
the address itself, will support them, and carry them and the 
State triumphantly through the contest. 

The present delusion is astonishing ; no man who does not 
witness it, can believe it. 

Mr. Healey can do more in those towns you mention, than 
any other man. He should have documents plentifully. He 
knows to whom it would be useful to send, better than any 
other person. 

I have received the militia document. I think an edition of 
it will be printed in this State. 

Yours always, 

E. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, April 4, 1828. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, I send you Mr. Davis's tariff speech, and shall 
send you others. Having some numbers of an English newspaper published in Paris, for th benefit, I presume, of English 
residents there, I enclose them to you, as you will find in them 

full accounts of the late ministerial changes in England, Mr. 
Brougham's speech on the laws, &c., &c. 

I believe what you advise in relation to a certain question 
is right, and I presume the matter will have that termination. 

I have had a good deal of conversation here about the Hampshire matters, with certain friends. I think a good disposition 
prevails, and that a satisfactory arrangement in regard to future 
proceedings may be made in June. But you will find it indispensable to this arrangement, that you be a candidate for a seat 
here. To that there will be no objection, I imagine, but on the 
contrary, a hearty assent. Other propositions would or might 
create difficulty. For one I shall never agree to let you off. 

It is quite uncertain whether any tariff bill will pass. Nothing 
new has developed itself for a week in regard to the subject. 

Yours always, D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. E. B. LEE. 

Washington, May 18, 1828, Sunday Evening. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, Your very kind letter of the 12th was received to-day. I cannot sufficiently thank you for your goodness and affection towards Julia. Certainly you come nearer 
to supplying her loss than anybody else. I believe she loves 
you best of any j and it is my wish, my dear friend, that you 
should make her as much your own as your feelings prompt 
you to do. She cannot be better than with you, and I incline 
to leave it very much to your choice, how much she shall be 
with you, and when it is best for her to be elsewhere. You 
have a right to her, if you choose to have, which nobody else 
will ever divide. You have been among our dearest friends 
from the day of our marriage, and, as Julia is left motherless, I 
know not what to do for her so well as to leave her with you, 
whenever it is agreeable to yon to have her with you. If you 
think her education would not suffer, I should be quite willing 
she should be with you most of the summer ; though I hope to 
have her with me some of the time. 

I thank you, my dear friend, for all your kind remembrance 
and good wishes. Your regard and friendship are among the 
VOL. i. 39 
objects which make me willing to live longer, and which I 
shall never cease to value while I do live. You say Mr. Sullivan thought me depressed. It is true. I fear I grow more and 
more so. I feel a vacuum, an indifference, a want of motive, 
which I cannot well describe. 

I hope my children, and the society of my best friends, may 
rouse me ; but I can never see such days as I have seen. Yet 
I would not repine ; I have enjoyed much, very much; and if I 
were to die to-night, I should bless God most fervently that I 
had lived. 

Adieu, my dear friend ; I hope to be in better spirits when I 

see you. 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Boston, June 19, 1328. 

MY DEAR EZEKIEL, I hardly know what to say, in reply to 
yours, about going to Boscawen. I had firmly resolved to go 
up last Saturday with Mr. Paige, Julia, and Edward, but was 
persuaded to give it up, and to stay and argue a cause here in 
the Supreme Court, on Tuesday last. For the rest of this week 
I have nothing to do ; but by the middle of next week shall be 
obliged to go to Nantucket, as I expect. That is the only professional engagement which I expect for the summer. It will 
occupy me sometime, and perhaps I cannot calculate on being 
back till the 10th of July. I should be glad to have the children, 
especially Edward, pass some time with you, during the hot 
weather. Julia will be very well for some time at Mrs. Lee's, at 
Brookline. We are now in our own house, and comfortably 
situated. 

I wish to make a little journey on to Connecticut River this 
season. If you would join me, I would go to Cabot, if Uncle 
Ben. should be living. I could be at your house July 15, 
go to Cabot, return to Hanover, and proceed further clown the 
river or not, according to circumstances. 

One thing more. I shall not probably go to Sandwich, because there is no one to go with us; but if your wife and 
daughters will come down and go and stay there, while you are 

holding your August court, I and the children will go with 
them. 

I will write you further before I go to Nantucket. I resisted 
going there for a long time ; but it was of some importance to 
my employers, and they made it of some importance to me. 

You say nothing of what is done, or doing at Concord, except that all is by this time done ; I hope well done. 

Yours, D. W. 



CHIEF JUSTICE SMITH TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Exeter, August 10, 1828. 

DEAR SIR, The trustees of the academy have usually convened on Wednesday noon, this year 22d, to attend examination ; and for business, Thursday morning. 

It is understood this year that the Principal intends to resign 
before the meeting with his friends on Thursday. Under these 
circumstances, I have supposed it proper that the trustees should 
meet Wednesday morning, for business, so that Thursday may 
be devoted to the fete. The examination and the exhibition 
in the academy are to be dispensed with ; I hope we shall have 
the pleasure of your attendance on the going out and coming in 
of Mr. Prince to the trustees, not a mere ceremony. Colonel 
Bell will not attend, and circumstances may, without you, 
prevent a quorum. 

I am, as always, with sincere regard yours, 

JEREMIAH SMITH. 



MR. TUDOR TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Rio Janeiro, August 26, 1828. 

DEAR WEBSTER, I had at length the pleasure of receiving a 
letter from you a few days since, and being one of the most 
placable of men, forgot the preceding enormous neglect. In 
the events that tried you last winter, I need not tell you I sympathized, not only from affection towards you, but towards her 
whom you lost. After wrestling for a time with feeling, and 
gaining a partial victory by aid of time, placed as you are, a 
man is obliged, out of regard to her he laments, to supply her 
place with some one to watch over the pledges she left him. 
To this conclusion you must come at last ; and, strange as it 
may seem, though the last person in the world to be a matchmaker, there is a young native woman of New Hampshire, who 
I thought would be a suitable person. I would have wished 
you had gone to St. James, for your own gratification, your 
further preparation for being the person hereafter to approve the 
laws instead of making them, and for the advantage of the 
United States. But I suppose you cannot be spared for a year 
or two ; but at any rate you must get a run through London, 
Paris, and Edinburgh, some vacation, instead of going to Sandwich ; you may do it all in four months out and home ; Perkins 
would say, in less time. 

I do not like to express myself about our opposition, lest it 
might possibly be the result of any interested feeling, which I 
cannot detect after self-examination. I see but few of thenpapers, and seldom read them when seen ; but I will say, nothing 
more indecent, mischievous, flagitious, than the gang that has 
conspired together to make use of the poor General's name, ever 
disgraced a free country. That T. T. L. should have waded 
deliberately into such a slough, is strange, though it always 
seemed that there was a want of heart to keep the head he 
has in a right course, but I hope it is only a transient error, and 
that he will get out, take a warm bath, and again be able to 
mix with gentlemen. 

As to my affairs here, they have caused me considerable 
anxiety, being with people who, from a complication of weaknesses, vanity, presumption, timidity, &c., are difficult to manage, and especially involved as they are, or rather have been, 
for they are now about being relieved, in a maze of difficulties, 
growing out of this stupid war. Their object was to turn, to 
double, and delay, to gain time if possible. The short-course 
process, that of force, we might have used very effectively ; but 
the danger was, that they are so feeble, we could *not have 
handled them without breaking their shell. Our intercourse is 
too considerable and too fast increasing not to be fostered and 
put on a good footing. I hope I shall be able to effect this in 
season to be submitted to you this winter ; they seem to me 

to be really desirous of making a treaty, and of being on good 
terms. I shall try to strengthen these inclinations. 

If I can get through the business intrusted to me in season 
to have the treaty ratified this winter, I propose to ask the 
President to give me leave to resign, being tired of South 
America. There are many sacrifices to be made, beside that 
of health, in a long residence. This country about Rio, its 
magnificent bay, surrounding mountains, all forming the most 
varied and picturesque outline, a landscape painter would be in 
ecstasy at the endless number of studies it offers; but the 
society is nothing. Besides, it is hard to live here on our salary; 
and as promotion is very uncertain, the service with us not 
being regular, commanders-in-chief being in most instances 
taken from the militia, there is little motive to stay abroad on a 
bare subsistence, though in a respectable station ; and though I 
have not a very pleasant prospect before me in returning, a very 
dismal one if my mines in Peru do not yield something, I 
hope to see you early next summer. Never having had an 
opportunity before, I must trouble you to make my affectionate 
compliments to Mrs. S. Lee. 

Yours sincerely, 

W. TUDOR. 



MR. TUDOR TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Legation of the United States of America, August 29, 1828. 

DEAR WEBSTER, The Macedonian has been delayed, waiting to carry the news of peace, the preliminaries of which I 
think were signed yesterday, though I do not know it certainly. 
I made a sortie from the heaps of papers, in which I am obliged 
to burrow, to breathe a freer air, and write a postscript to what I 
have already addressed to you, by this same frigate. 

I forgot to touch upon a subject I had in my mind. If opposition can go on in the unprincipled manner it has done the last 
four years, for a few years longer, in my opinion they will break 
down the government by the mere weight of filth they will heap 
upon it. 

There seems to be a concerted plan to destroy every branch 
of the public service. I believe that the greatest abuses of our 
39* 
government are now to be found in Congress, and that they are 
getting into more vicious courses every day. It will eventually, 
if unchecked by public opinion, become only an arena, where 
every profligate demagogue will attempt to court public applause 
by doing his uttermost to blast, rather than to sustain, the government. I touched upon the subject, in a moment of vexation, 
in an article in The North American Review, the only scrap I 
have written for type since I left home. I think either in that 
or Walsh's, a powerful article, written with temper, energy, and 
knowledge of the subject, as a kind of appeal to the nation, to 
pounce upon the recent conduct of their servants, in the two 
Houses who have sacrificed their duty in the mad career of 
faction would be salutary, and would have its effect. 

The disregard of the interests of the country in an endeavor 
to embarrass the administration by want of timely legislation in 
the United States question ; the attempt to break down the army 
by abolishing the poor office of a solitary major-general; the 
keeping down the navy by the refusal to appoint flag officers ; 
the excessive mischief that has been caused by refusing to make 
a quarter's advance in the appropriations for the navy until the 
present year, a chairman of a naval committee declaring that 
merchant captains might be taken as they should be wanted to 
command our ships of war! which is either ignorance or treachery without example, and fifty other items that I cannot particularize, but of equal, or greater moment ; the making the 
tariif bill as bad as they could avowedly ; the patronage of ruffians in the capitol, like the editors of The Telegraph, &c., &c., 
&c. Pray have this matter thought about by those who are 
capable. 

You alluded to what I hastily wrote you on the subject of 
conveying back the commerce of the western side of this continent to Panama. It would take a quire to develop the subject, but be assured it is the most important object that can be 
effected for the increase of our foreign commerce. This point, 
that of settling the West India's question, with the English, (I 
think I shall be able to make Brazil a potent ally against the 
colonial system,) the obtaining payment for the claims on France, 
and the restoring Spain to her former prosperity and power by 
persuading her to recognize South America, are the great desiderata, in my humble opinion, of our foreign policy. 

The preliminaries of peace are undoubtedly signed. I expect 
to be able to communicate officially, though I only know it as 
yet second hand from Sir Robert Otway, the English admiral. 
Excuse a very hurried epistle from 

Yours, truly and affectionately, 

W. TUDOR. 



MR. WEBSTER TO REV. MR. BRAZER. 

Boston, November 10, 1828. 

DEAR SIR, I part with Whately, not without regret, as I have 
not had leisure to go through him regularly, although I have 
had some good snatches here and there. It is a good book. If 
it were not for an appearance of self-conceit, I would say that I 
have found in it twenty things which I have thought of often, 
and been convinced of long, but never before saw in print. He 
shows sense, especially in the prominence which he gives to perspicuity and energy, as qualities of style. I like his hatred of 
adjectives, his love of Saxon words, and his idea of the true use 
of repetition ; this last might be much further explained than 
it is done by him. There is something which may be called 
augmentative repetition, that is capable sometimes of producing 
great effect. " The author of the murder stood by the side of 
his victim, wet, bathed with the blood he had shed," or, " the 
murderer stood by the side of the slain, his sandals wet with the 
blood, the warm, gushing blood of his victim." In this last case, 
by the way, adjectives do their office ; they add definite ideas. 

What Mr. Whately says upon the effect of particularization, is 
just, especially as applied to pathetic description. The skilful, 
and apparently natural enumeration of particulars, is certainly, in 
its proper place, one of the very best modes of producing impression. All the standard works are full of instances of this sort of 
composition. 

Perhaps the very best and most touching, is in the 12th verse 
of the 7th chapter of Luke. Here are comprised, in one short 
and single paragraph : 
A death ; a funeral ; the death of a young person, for his 
mother was living ; the death of a son ; the death of an only 
son ; the son of a living mother ; that mother a widow. 

You remember, much better than I do, what a burst Massillon 
has, at the opening of his sermon on this text. This fine passage 
would have been tame enough, if, sinking all particulars, it had 
only recited, that, " when he came to the city, he met the funeral 
of one who had died under very afflicting circumstances." 

Additional effect is given to the incident, by fixing so nearly 
the place where it was, nigh to the gate of the city. This minute 
statement of place, as well as of time, gives great naturalness to 
narrative compositions. Homer and De Foe, I regard as the 
greatest masters of this part of their art, always excepting the 
Scriptures. 

Mr. Whately's rejection of expletives and epithets, shows his 
just perception of strength and beauty. Yet, particularization 
is sometimes out of place. There are cases in which comprehension or generalization is altogether preferable. Suppose one 
should say, " The distinction of the Christian revelation is, that 
it is addressed not only to Englishmen, but also to Frenchmen, 
Spaniards, Germans, Italians, Russians, Prussians," &c., &c. 
This would be feeble. Better thus. " The distinction of the 
Christian revelation is, that it reveals important truths, not to a 
few favored individuals, but to all the race of men ; not to a 
single nation, but to the whole world." A book might be written 
on this little question, " When is effect produced by generalization ; when by particularization ? " At least, a book might be 
filled with opposite instances of both kinds, from our English 
classics, especially the Scriptures, Shakespeare, and Milton. An 
accurate writer should avoid generalities sometimes, not always ; 
but when, it would require a treatise to expound. I rejoice to 
see one Rhetorician who will allow nothing to words but as they 
are signs of ideas. The rule is a good one, to use no word which 
does not suggest an idea, or modify some idea already suggested. 
And this should lead writers to adopt sparingly the use of such 
words as " vast," " amazing," " astonishing," &c. For, what do 
they mean ? Dr. Watts, who by the way, I do not deem altogether a bad poet, somewhere speaks of the flight of an angel 
as being with " most amazing speed." But what idea is conveyed by this mode of expression ? What is " amazing speed ? " 

It would amaze us, if we saw an oyster moving a mile a day. 
It would not amaze us to see a greyhound run a mile in a 
minute. 

On the other hand, see with what unequalled skill Milton 
represents both the distance through which, and the speed with 
which, Mulciber fell from heaven : 

From morn 

To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve, 
A summer's day ; and with the setting sun, 
Dropt from the zenith, like a falling star. 

What art is manifest in these few lines ! The object is to 
express great distance, and great velocity, neither of which is 
capable of very easy suggestion to the human mind. We are 
told that the angel fell a day, a long summer's day ; the day is 
broken into forenoon and afternoon, that the time may seem to 
be protracted. 

He does not reach the earth till sunset ; and then, to represent 
the velocity, he " drops," one of the very best words in the language, to signify sudden and rapid fall, and then comes a simile, 
" like a falling star." 

Excuse, my dear Sir, this very hurried and very presumptuous 
letter. You have, I hope, leisure to study rhetoric by investigating 
its principles. I have given little time, for I have had little time 
to give, to the systematic authors ; but I have observed something of the effect of speaking and writing, and have endeavored 
to analyze " the causes of effects." " After all," says Cobbett, 
" he is a man of talent that can make a thing move." And after 
all, say I, he is an orator that can make me think as he thinks, 
and feel as he feels. 

And I pray you, my dear Sir, both to think and to feel, that I 
am, with much regard, 

Your obedient servant, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 





EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

January 9, 1829. 

MY DEAR BROTHER, The legislature adjourned on Saturday 
last, the 3d instant, after having a very long session and doing 
a good deal of business. You will see by the papers that a 
nomination was made of candidates for Congress. To be 
frank with you, I did not wish nor intend to be a candidate 
myself. My only wish is to lead a quiet and peaceable life in 
domestic happiness and peace. But circumstances left me no 
choice; they did not permit me to consult my own feelings 
and wishes. My friends determined to act for me, and thought 
1 had no right to act for myself. And so I am up. The result 
of the election is pretty doubtful, and especially in regard to my 
own. There are, I have no doubt, a good many Republicans 
in the administration party who will not vote for a Federalist, 
and they, of course, will strike off my name. 

I should like to learn the aspect of things at Washington as 
soon as you have leisure. How is Mr. Clay's health ? 

Yours truly, 

EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, January 17, 1829. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, The enclosed will give you a brief of all 
that is to be said of the state of things here. 

I came here on the 12th, after a severe cold journey. But 
three judges are yet here ; we expect a fourth to-night, and I 
must go into court on Monday. Not much is doing in the 
Senate. Mr. Wickliffe's motion about the mode of choosing 
officers of the House, which was intended mainly to affect the 
choice of printer, was to-day laid on the table by a majority of 
seven or eight votes. 

You did right to go on the ticket. I showed Mr. Bell your 
letter. He says your fears, that republicans will strike off 
your name, are groundless, and that you will get as many votes 
as any of the rest. I believe you will all be chosen. Let me 

know from time to time how the prospect is. Mr. Moore's 
remark in a late journal is true ; it is the most important election in New Hampshire since the adoption of the Constitution. 
I hope our friends will not lose it for want of attention. 
Let me hear frciu you. D. W. 



[Inclosed in letter dated January 17, 1829.] 

General Jackson will be here about 15th February. 

Nobody knows what he will do when he does come. 

Many letters are sent to him ; he answers none of them. 

His friends here pretend to be very knowing ; but be assured, 
not one of them has any confidential communication from him. 

Great efforts are making to put him up to a general sweep, 
as to all offices ; springing from great doubt whether he is disposed to go it. 

Nobody is authorized to say, whether he intends to retire 
after one term of service. 

Who will form his cabinet is as well known at Boston as at 
Washington. 

The present apparent calm is a suspension of action, a sort 
of syncope, arising from ignorance of the views of the President 
elect. 

My opinion is, that when he comes he will bring a breeze 
with him. Which way it will blow I cannot tell. 

He will either go with the party, as they say in New York, or 
go the whole hog ? as it is phrased elsewhere, making all the 
places he can for friends and supporters, and shaking a rod of 
terror at his opposers. 

Or else he will continue to keep his own counsels, make 
friends and advisers of whom he pleases, and be President upon 
his own strength. 

The first would show boldness where there is no danger, and 
decision where the opposite virtue of moderation would be more 
useful. The latter would show real nerve, and if he have talents 
to maintain himself in that course, true greatness. 

My fear is stronger than my hope. 

Mr. Adams is in good health, and complains not at all of the 
measure meted out to him. 
Mr. Clay's health is much improved, and his spirits excellent. 
He goes to Kentucky in March, and, I conjecture, will be 
pressed into the next House of Representatives. His chance of 
being at the head of affairs is now better, in my judgment, than 
ever before. 

Keep New England firm and steady, and she can make him 
President if she chooses. 

Sundry important nominations are postponed, probably to 
know General Jackson's pleasure. 

The above contains all that is known here, at this time. 
[Indorsed 1829.] 



MR. WOOD TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Boscawen, January 31, 1829. 

HONORED AND DEAR SIR, It is with pleasure that I perform 
an office in the object of which I am much interested. I say 
interested, because it gives me an opportunity to do that officially, which I have considered as incumbent on me to do as 
an individual. 

I present you the enclosed, as expressive of the feelings of the 
friends, and especially the trustees, of Boscawen Academy. 

You will perhaps ask after my health, as I was feeble when I 
saw you last. Sir, I have reason to be thankful that my health 
is such as that I am able to preach on the Sabbaths and to 
attend to some other duties. It is my prayer that you may 
have wisdom from on high to direct you in the important station 
which you are called to fill. 

Your affectionate friend, 

SAMUEL WOOD. 

Honorable Daniel Webster. 

Voted, That the thanks of this Board of Trustees be presented to 
the Honorable Daniel Webster for his very generous donation 
of a suitable bell for our academy ; and that the president communicate the same. 

From the Record. EBEN. PRICE, Secretary. 



EZEKIEL WEBSTER TO DANIEL WEBSTER. 

February 15, 1829. 

DEAR DANIEL, I do not write to you oftener for two reasons ; 
one, I have nothing to say ; the other, that you have no leisure 
to read letters that say nothing. I can give you nothing new in 
regard to affairs in New Hampshire. 

The truth is that the people made such an effort last fall, 
were so disappointed in the result, and so disgusted with the 
conduct of Mr. Adams, that they have not any heart to make 
any exertions. They always supported his cause from a cold 
sense of duty, and not from any liking of the man. We soon 
satisfy ourselves that we have discharged our duty to the cause 
of any man, when we do not entertain for him one personal 
kind feeling, nor cannot, unless we disembowel ourselves, like a 
trussed turkey, of all that is human nature within us. During 
the last contest, this cause alone had no little effect in producing 
all its disasters. 

If there had been at the head of affairs a man of popular character, like Mr. Clay, or any man whom we were not compelled 
by our natures, instincts, and fixed fate to dislike, the result 
would have been different. 

People cannot have strong affections for the cause, and strong 
dislike for the man. The measures of his administration were 
just and wise, and every honest man should have supported 
them, but many honest men did not, for the reason I have mentioned. 

At what time do you intend to be home ? 

We are anxious here to see the first movements of General 
Jackson, as this will indicate the course of his policy. 

I hear from Boston often, and you, I suppose, every day. 

Yours truly, 

E. WEBSTER. 

VOL. I. 40 


MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. E. WEBSTER. 

Senate Chamber, February 19, 1829. 

MY DEAR SISTER, I must begin with apology ; or let me rather 
say, with confession ; for though I am willing to confess great 
and censurable omissions, I have little to urge by way of apology, 
;md nothing which amounts to justification. Let me pray you 
therefore, in the exercise of your clemency, to adopt the rule 
which Hamlet prescribes for passing judgment on the players. 
Do not treat me according to my deserts, for if so, " who would 
escape whipping," but according to your own bounty and dignity; the less I deserve forgiveness, the more will forgiveness 
exalt your forbearance and mercy. 

The children under your good superintendence have written 
me continually, day by day, very good letters. Mr. Paige also 
has been kind, as he always is. Your own letters have completed 
my circle of domestic correspondence, and I must say that it has 
been very punctual, and highly gratifying. And now what can 
I tell you worth hearing ? 

General Jackson has been here about ten days. Of course 
the city is full of speculation and speculators. " A great multitude," too many to be fed without a miracle, are already in the 
city, hungry for office. Especially, I learn, that the typographical corps is assembled in great force. From New Hampshire, 
our friend Hill; from Boston, Mr. Greene; from Connecticut, 
Mr. Norton ; from New York, Mr. Noah ; from Kentucky, Mr. 
Kendall, and from everywhere else, somebody else. So many 
friends ready to advise, and whose advice is so disinterested, 
make somewhat of a numerous council about the President 
elect ; and, if report be true, it is a council which only " makes 
that darker, which was dark enough before." For these reasons, 
or these with others, nothing is settled yet, about the new 
cabinet I suppose Mr. Van Bnren will be Secretary of State ; 
but beyond that, I do not think any thing is yet determined. 

For ten or twelve days, our Senate has been acting with 
closed doors, on certain nominations to office by Mr. Adams 
What we have done is not yet known, though one day it will 
be probably. 

The general spirit prevailing here, with the friends of the new 

President, is that of a pretty decided party character. It is not 
quite so fierce as our New England Jackson men are actuated 
by, still, I think it likely to grow more and more bitter, unless, 
which is highly probable, the party itself should divide. 

We have all read the dispute between Mr. Adams and the 
Boston gentlemen. Thus far I believe the universal feeling is, 
that Mr. Adams has the worst side of it. I hear, however, that 
he is about to reply in another pamphlet ! ! 

The fashionable world is and has been full and gay. Crowds 
have come and are coming to see the inauguration, &c. I have 
been to three parties, to wit, Mrs. Adams's last, Mrs. Clay's last, 
and Mrs. Porter's last. Mrs. Porter, wife of the Secretary of 
War, is a fine woman, whom we visited at Niagara, when there 
four years ago. With these manifestations of regard for the setting sun and stars, I have satisfied my desire of seeing the social 
circles. If there should be a ball on the 22d, I shall attend as 
usual, to commemorate the great and good man born on that day. 

Judge Story is well, and in his usual spirits. The court is 
deeply engaged, and as soon as I get rid of these secret sessions 
of the Senate, I have enough to do in it. 

We are looking to New Hampshire. I shall not engage lodgings for you and your husband next winter, till I see the returns. 
[Conclusion cut off.] 



MR. WEBSTER TO MARY ANN WEBSTER. 

Washington, February 23, 1829. 

MY DEAR MARY ANN, I am exceedingly sorry that you are 
so ill that your thoughts cannot flow from your own pen. I 
trust, however, that your little fever, which the Doctor calls a 
slow one, will hasten off with a quickened pace. Your sister 
and Julia will, I hope, not fail to let me know, every day, how 
you get along, as I shall be anxious till I hear that you are quite 
well. You may safely tell Alice and Julia to do their best to 
run away from you if they can. You will overtake them when 
you get well. Tell them to fly on in music, dancing, and 
French. Give my love to mother and all the rest. 
Your affectionate uncle, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. E. WEBSTER. 

Washington, Sunday morning, March 2, 1829. 

DEAR SISTER, I had letters yesterday from Mr. Paige and 
from Alice, which ought to have been received two days earlier. 
This, I suppose, is to be placed to the account of your great 
.-torm. 

With less snow, we have very cold weather here. There has 
not been a warm day since I came here, although I have often 
seen the peach-trees in blossom in February*. The ground is 
still covered with snow, the river hard frozen, and the weather 
steadily cold. It will make bad travelling for those who leave 
here the 4th. 

Tuesday is the last day of the session of Congress. A special 
session of the Senate is called to meet on Wednesday, the 4th. 
I suppose it will not last beyond two or three days. General 
Jackson will then nominate his new cabinet, and make such 
changes in office as he sees fit. On this latter subject very little 
is known about his intentions ; probably he will make some 
removals, but I think not a great many immediately. But we 
shall soon see. 

The court will probably continue its session a fortnight longer, 
and then I shall set my face northward. I hope your patience 
will hold out. Consider how cold it must be up at Boscawen, 
and how busy your husband is now, and how soon he will come 
to Boston, after the 10th, either for congratulation or condolence. He will need a week in either case, and that will bring 
March so far along, that I trust you will be able to content yourself till I come. 

My health is good, but I find, to confess the truth, that I am 
growing indolent. I would be glad to have more decisive volitions. I do nothing in Congress or the court, but what is clearly 
necessary ; and in such cases, even, my efforts " come haltingly 
off." In short, I believe the truth is, that I am growing old, and 
age you know, or rather you have heard, requires repose. 
Adieu, yours, with much affectionate regard, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. E. WEBSTER. 

Washington, March 4, 1829. 

[First year of the administration of Andrew Jackson, and the first day.] 

MY DEAR SISTER, I thank you for yours, received to-day, and 
thank you both for the letter itself and for your pardon which it 
contains, and of which I stood in so much need. Your benignity 
is memorable and praiseworthy. To be serious, however, my 
dear sister, let me say once for all, that I have a very affectionate 
regard for you ; that I am very glad you are my sister, and the 
wife of the best of all brothers ; and that if, like him, I am not the 
most punctual of all correspondents, I am like him in sincerity 
and constancy of esteem. If you find in your connection with 
my own little broken circle but one half as much pleasure as 
you bestow, you will have no reason to regret it. Your presence 
with my children, through the winter, has relieved me from a 
pressing weight of anxiety. 

To-day we have had the inauguration. A monstrous crowd 
of people is in the city. I never saw any thing like it before. 
Persons have come five hundred miles to see General Jackson, 
and they really seem to think that the country is rescued from 
some dreadful danger. 

The inauguration speech you will see. I cannot make much 
of it, except that it is anti-tariff, at least in some degree. What 
it says about reform in office may be either a prelude to a general change in office, or a mere sop to soothe the hunger, without 
satisfying it, of the thousand expectants for office who throng 
the city, and clamor all over the country. I expect some changes, 
but not a great many at present. The show lasted only half an 
hour. The Senate assembled at eleven, the judges and foreign 
ministers came in, the President elect was introduced, and all 
seated by half-past eleven. The Senate was full of ladies ; a 
pause ensued till twelve. Then the President, followed by the 
Senate, &c., went through the great rotunda, on to the portico, 
over the eastern front door ; and those went with him who could, 
but the crowd broke in as we were passing the rotunda, and 
all became confusion. On the portico, in the open air, the day 
very warm and pleasant, he read his inaugural, and took the 
oath. A great shout followed from the multitude, and in fifteen

minutes, " silence settled, deep and still." Every body was dispersed. As I walked home, I called in at a bookstore, and saw 
a volume which I now send you ; it may serve to regulate matters of etiquette at Boscawen. 

I hope to write Edward to-night. If not, I shall not fail to 
do so to-morrow. 

Yours very sincerely and truly,

DANIEL WEBSTER TO EZEKIEL WEBSTER. 

Washington, Sunday evening, March 15, 1829. 

DEAR EZEKIEL, The Senate will probably adjourn to-morrow, 
and I hope the court will rise, or at least will dismiss me by 
Wednesday or Thursday. I shall be immediately off. My 
books are in trunks. I shall hear from New Hampshire tomorrow, and dispose of them according to circumstances. If 
no change takes place in my own condition, of which I have not 
the slightest expectation, and if you are not elected, I shall not 
return. This, inter nos, but my mind is settled. Under present 
circumstances, public and domestic, it is disagreeable being here, 
and to me there is no novelty to make compensation. It will 
be better for me and my children that I should be with them. 
If I do not come in a public, I shall not in a professional 
character. I can leave the court now as well as ever, and can 
earn my bread as well at home as here. 

Your company and that of your wife, would make a great 
difference. I have not much expectation that you will be returned. Our fortune is, as connected with recent and current 
political events, that if there be opposite chances, the unfavorable one turns up. You had a snow of five feet, which of itself 
might turn the election against the well-disposed and indifferent, 
:ind in favor of the mischievous and the active. I shall not be 
disappointed if I hear bad news. 

I make my point to be home the first day of April, when I 
trust I shall meet you. We will then settle what is best to do 
with the children. I shall want Julia and Edward to stay a 
little while with me. Edward, I think, should then go to Bos
cawen. I hardly know what I shall think best to do with 
Julia. 

Yours as ever, 

D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. We have had one important cause here. It is from 
New York, respecting what is called the Sailors' Snug Harbor. 
I have made a greater exertion in it than in any other since 
Dartmouth College v. Woodward, or than it is probable I ?hall 
ever make in another. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. E. WEBSTER. 

Boston, April 15, 1829. 

MY DEAR SISTER, We had a very good journey home, and 
arrived last evening at about eight o'clock. Mr. Paige is here ; 
he reached home from New York on Sunday evening. No 
news reached him till he came into the house here. Julia has 
come home this morning ; she seems well, except her usual 
cough. I think I shall consult Dr. Warren as to that. My 
losses have been such that I feel alarmed for every thing that 
remains. 

Mary will put up your articles and Edward's clothes, and, 
perhaps, we may send them by the coach which carries this. I 
hear that Mrs. Ticknor and Mrs. Hale are well as usual. 

Your house, my dear sister, is not alone solitary and melancholy. It is the same here. 

Yours truly and affectionately, 

DANIEL WEBSTER, 



MR. WEBSTER TO DR. PERKINS. 

Boston, April 17, 1829. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, You will have heard of the sudden death 
of my brother. The event necessarily called me to Boscawen, 
from which place I returned a day or two ago. It has quite 
overwhelmed us all. Mrs. Webster and the oldest daughter 
were here, when it happened. The messenger brought us the 
news at three o'clock, on Saturday morning, the llth instant 
The death took place the previous afternoon at four o'clock. 
You will probably have seen some account of it. It seems to 
me I never heard of a death so instantaneous. He fell in an 
instant, without any effort to save himself, and without any 
struggle or sign of consciousness, after he reached the floor. On 
receiving the tidings, Mrs. Webster and her daughter, and myself and two sons, set off immediately, and arrived at Boscawen 
that evening at nine o'clock. The funeral was attended the 
next day. Mrs. Webster's constitution is feeble, and I knew 
not how she would get through the dreadful scene; yet she 
did get through. I left her far better than was to have been 
expected ; and a letter received to-day says she continues so. 
It was not possible for me to stay long from home, on so sudden a call ; but I must return in two or three days to Boscawen, 
to pay proper attention to the circumstances of the family. My 
brother has left two daughters, one fourteen and one twelve 
years old; and a wife, a fine woman, to whom he had been 
married about four years. He has left a competency to those 
dependent on him ; but it will require care and oversight to 
preserve it, and make the most of it. 

This event, my dear Sir, has affected me very much. Coming 
so soon after another awful stroke, it seems to fall with double 
weight. He has been my reliance, through life, and I have 
derived much of its happiness from his fraternal affection. I 
am left the sole survivor of my family. Yet I have objects of 
affection in my children, and I do not intend to repine ; though 
I confess I cannot well describe the effect of this event on my 
feelings. 

I ought to acknowledge the receipt of two letters from you, 
yet unanswered. It is probable, that but for this melancholy 
occurrence, I should have been in New York the first of May. 
Now, it is hardly likely I shall be there before the sitting of the 
court, on the 25th. 

I pray you give our love to Mrs. Perkins. We know she 
sympathizes with jis, in all our afflictions. Remember me also 
to Mr. Clarke's family, whom I had not the pleasure of seeing 
as I came home. 

Yours always truly, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Boston, April 19, 1829. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for your kind letter. You do 
not and cannot overrate the strength of the shock which my 
brother's death has caused me. I have felt but one such in life ; 
and this follows that so soon that it requires more fortitude 
than I possess to bear it with firmness, such perhaps as I ought. 
I am aware that the case admits of no remedy, nor any present 
relief; and endeavor to console myself with reflecting, that I 
have had much happiness in lost connections ; and that they 
must expect to lose beloved objects in this world, who have 
beloved objects to lose. My life, I know, has been fortunate 
and happy beyond the common lot, and it would be now ungrateful, as well as unavailing, to repine at calamities of which, 
as they are human, I must expect to partake. But I confers 
the world, at present, has for me an aspect any thing but cheerful. With a multitude of acquaintance, I have few friends ; my 
nearest intimacies are broken, and a sad void is made in the 
objects of affection. Of what remains dear and valuable, I need 
not say that a most precious part is the affectionate friendship 
of yourself and family. I want to see you very much indeed, 
but know not whether I shall be able soon to visit Portsmouth. 
You will be glad to know that my own health is good. I havt 
never, for ten years, got through a winter without being more 
reduced in health and strength. My children also are well. 
Edward is at Boscawen, where he will probably stay through 
the summer, or as long as the family may be kept together 
there. Daniel hopes to go to college in August. Julia proposes 
to pass the summer, or part of it, with Mrs. Lee, and must afterwards be disposed of as best she may. 

This occurrence is calculated to have effect on the future 
course of my own life, and to add to the inducements, already 
felt, to retire from a situation in which I am making daily 
sacrifices and doing little good to myself or others. Pray give 
my love to your family. 

Yours affectionately and entirely, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 


MR. M'GAW TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Bangor, May 1, 1829. 

DEAR SIR, There are seasons, that sooner or later present 
themselves to us, which are too sacred to admit the presence of 
even dear friends. But these seasons are hallowed by the 
knowledge that the same friends share our griefs or our joys 
with us. My own experience leads to the conclusion that 
others possess these feelings in common with me. 

How to approach the subject, with which my heart is full, 
and yours is overflowing, I do not know. 

Bereavement of friends who were dear to you is not a new 
event, though the arrows of affliction have not fallen thick upon 
you, that I know of. If, however, your wounds had been quite 
numerous, few, very few of them could have been so severe as 
tu2 one recently received. 

A State has lost one of her most highly valued citizens, and 
the bar of New Hampshire one of its brightest ornaments ; but 
some other citizen may supply his place to the State, and some 
other lawyer adorn the bar of which he was the pride. Would 
to God, it were possible that another brother, possessing equal 
excellence and equal love with him whom you have lost, could 
be granted you. I know that it is unavailing to utter such a 
wish, but it is a privilege to mourn in such cases. 

The friends of my youth are pretty fast dropping off, and leaving me with few, and that number constantly diminishing, who 
are really dear to me ; and though my heart clings close to 
those friends who remain, yet on the whole my desire of living 
becomes weaker and weaker every year. 

Amid the vicissitudes and trials of life, there is consolation 
in the assurance that though no chastening for the present 
seemeth to be joyous, but grievous, nevertheless afterward it 
yieldeth the peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which 
are exercised thereby. 

That every dispensation of Divine Providence may bring you 
to the enjoyment of more of the smiles of our blessed Saviour, 
is the earnest prayer of, 

Your friend, 

JACOB McGAW. 



[Mr. Webster, in connection with some other gentlemen, was interested in 
some wild land in the northern part of New Hampshire. 

He paid little attention to the matter, apparently, and the occupier of the 
town of Dixville addressed him a remonstrance on the subject of the place, and 
its means of communication and transport, which, as it represents a' not very 
flourishing state of things, in a good-natured style of reproach, I have thought 
might not be without amusement in its perusal.] 



MR. WHITTEMORE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Dixville, June 22, 1829. 

SIR, The inhabitants of this town are now reduced to two ; 
my children are all gone but my youngest daughter, and if there 
is no better prospect we must quit before winter. The roads 
are so bad there is but little travel. Last year the bridges were 
all carried off, and two large slides came down in the Notch. 
We did seventy days' work on the road before teams could 
pass ; Mr. Parsons and others worked about twenty more ; the 
prospect was so bad that my sons were determined not to 
winter here again. Mr. Gerrish told me the last time I saw him, 
that you and he had agreed not to sell any single lots, nor do 
any thing on the road. Now, Sir, if this is right, I ought not 
to complain, but I must hear some other reasons for its being 
just, before I can believe it. We have done at least five hundred days' work on the road, and the proprietors have done 
nothing. I am no beggar ; all I ask is justice amongst men. 
Your much lamented brother told me that Daniel would be willing to lay out a hundred or two dollars on the road, if that 
would satisfy me, but that you considered such sum only as 
an entering wedge for a larger sum ; but I am not lawyer 
enough to see the propriety of such argument. Besides, two 
hundred dollars, well laid out, with what the people would do, 
provided that sum was promised to be paid those that should 
do the work, when done, under the superintendence of some 
good man that feels an interest in the road, would make it 
tolerable good, so that the reverse of curses would rest on the 
proprietors' heads. You can guess pretty near what men say, 
when they get their horses off the Notch, and have them lay in 
the gulf two or three days, which has several times been the 
case. I think it would be for your interest to sell the land by 
lots to settlers, and I should like good neighbors very much. 
Now, Sir, if you will assist in repairing the road, you will let 
me know how and when. General Town from Charlton has 
been here; if you see him, he can tell you my situation and that 
of the road. 

I am your long neglected and very humble servant, 

JOHN WHITTEMORE. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. LANGDON ELWYN. 

Boston, September 8, 1829. 

MY DEAR MRS. LANGDON ELWYN, I have been long your 
debtor for two kind letters, received by me early in the season. 
I know not how to account for, much less excuse, so long a 
delay. But the summer has been running away, and occurrences happening which occupied my attention from week to 
week. My brother's death was an unexpected stroke, and has 
devolved on me, in addition to the pain arising from the loss of 
so good a brother, many new cares and duties. I have lived to 
be the last of a pretty large circle of brothers and sisters. It 
not only fills me with wonder, but with melancholy, to look 
round about the places of my early acquaintance. Every body 
is gone. While my brother lived, there was yet something to 
hold to ; but now, the last attraction is gone. There was a 
large, valuable, and most pleasant farm which belonged to us, 
and which he had ;taken excellent care of for years, but it 
causes me great pain now to visit it. A new generation has 
sprung up around it, and I see nothing interesting to me but 
the tombs of my parents, and my brothers and sisters. 

I have been from home but once, except to New Hampshire. 
Julia and I went to Brattleboro' in July, and intended to visit 
Lake George. I proceeded to Albany where I was to be joined 
by Mr. Hunt's family, of Brattleboro', and Julia, but Mrs. Hunt 
was taken sick, so that part of the journey failed, and I returned 
to Brattleboro' and thence home. I got home just in season to 
see your neighbor and my friend in the stage-coach, passing out of town on her return home. If all Boston talk be 

true, it is possible we may have the pleasure of seeing her 
again in this quarter. Some people's hearts, it seems, are not 
so cold as their occupations. 

We have had sundry and divers good citizens of the South 
among us in the course of August ; among others your neighbor, 
Mr. Biddle, was here just long enough to let us look at him. 
H-? is always most welcome, as he is always most agreeable ; 
but, if instead of cashiers and other officials, he would bring 
fellow travellers of another kind with him, it would enhance 
our pleasure. Our Yankees have a great opinion of him. 
They think he takes good care of their money ; although they 
do not see in him any of the marks of one of the children of 
Israel. He will have told you, that he had occasion to visit our 
town of Portsmouth. Mr. Mason was recently here, and expressed high satisfaction at the result of Mr. Biddle's visit, and 
much respect for him. 

Of news in our circle, I dare say your daughters know more 
than I do. All that has corne to my knowledge is, that Mr. 
Charles Adams and Miss Brooks are married, and saw their 
friends last evening ; and that Mr. Gorham is engaged to Mrs. 
Coles. The latter fact I learn from Mr. Gorham himself, and 
the former I infer from having received a legal portion of wedding cake. 

I send you a copy of Mr. Sprague's poem, which I did not 
hear, and have not read ; but I subscribed for six copies, being 
told it was a poetical poem. I have seen no such production 
among us, lately, though I have met with several prose ones. 
Judge Story edified us with a good discourse, on his inauguration as professor. 

What shall I say of your friend Mr. Blake ? He has been 
very gay and gallant through the season of company, and is in 
fine health and spirits. I know not if he intends becoming a 
relative of yours, but I believe that when he goes out for a 
drive, if no special order be given, the coachman sets off, as of 
course, for Mrs. Eustis's. 

I hear with much regret of the illness of Mrs. R., understanding she is in Portsmouth. I hope she will find an atmosphere somewhat less damp than that of New York, favorable to 
her. We saw little of Charles while he was here, everybody 
was engaged. I sought him diligently, to have his company at 
VOL. i. 41 
dinner with Mr. Biddle, but he had gone to carouse with the 
Phi Beta Kappa. 

I pray you make my best respects to Emily and Matilda. 
For all I have heard of them lately, I am mainly indebted to 

Mr. Wallenstein, whom also I salute. Say to I have still 

in my eye the parting but reproachful shake of her finger 
through the coach window. She cannot say, I did it, " never 

shake," &c. 

Yours always, very truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO FLETCHER WEBSTER. 

New York, December 14, 1829. 

MY DEAR SON, You have been informed that an important 
change in my domestic condition was expected to take place. 
It happened on Saturday. The lady who is now to bear the 
relation of mother to you, and Julia, and Edward, I am sure 
will be found worthy of all your affection and regard ; and I am 
equally certain that she will experience from all of you the 
utmost kindness and attachment. She insists on taking Julia 
with us to Washington, thinking it will be better for her, and 
that she will also be good company. 

We shall leave New York in about a week. I read your first 
letter, which gave me pleasure, and hope to have another from 
you before I leave New York. You will not fail to write me 
once a week, according to arrangement. The enclosed note 
you will of course answer. If you despatch your answer at 
once, without waiting for the keepsake, it will arrive here before 
our departure. Let it come enclosed to me. The " keepsake " 
is an elegant gold watch. You must send for it to Mr. Paige, 
by a careful hand. Mr. Paige will not be home under ten days 
from this time. 

I hope, my dear son, that I shall continue to hear good 
accounts of you. 

I am always, with much affection, your father, 

D. WEBSTER. 

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BUTTON. 

(EXTRACT.) 

Washington, January 15, 1830. 

As to Washington occurrences I hardly know whether there 
be any thing of novelty. We have a plentiful parcel of persons 
here, many of them from Massachusetts, who having received 
commissions from the President since March, find it necessary 
to take care that they do not lose them. The great batch of 
appointments is not yet acted on in the Senate. Before particular cases shall be taken up, it is probable a general discussion 
will be had in open or secret session upon the course of the 
administration in regard to removals and appointments. I 
never did intend to trouble myself with another debate, on such 
questions, being as tired of them as I am of constitutional questions in the courts ; but if I could see clearly what was the true 
ground, I fear I might break my resolution. The power of removal, as a distinct power, and as residing in the President 
alone, has been often exercised ; but I confess I doubt its existence. It seems to me to be only incident to the power of 
appointment, and to belong therefore where that power belongs, 
that is to say, to the President and Senate. Pray, while you 
are making one turn in the Mall, give this subject one turn also 
in your thoughts. 

The tariff sleepeth. It may be jogged a little during the session, but I think not awakened. Let them go on to spin at 
Lowell, with the persuasion that if then: condition be not made 
better, it will still not be made worse. I think the duties on 
tea and coffee will be reduced; and that then reduction will 
stop. The general face of things appears here, I presume, much 
as it does with you. Mr. Van Buren has evidently, at this moment, quite the lead in influence and importance. He controls 
all the pages on the back stairs, and flatters what seems to be 
at present the Aaron's serpent among the President's desires, a 
settled purpose of making out the lady, of whom so much has 
been said, a person of reputation. It is odd enough, but too 
evident to be doubted, that the consequence of this dispute in 
the social and fashionable world, is producing great political 
effects, and may very probably determine who shall be successor 
to the present chief magistrate. " Such great events, &c. &c. &c." 
Our good chief justice has not yet arrived, but is expected 
this evening, the convention at Richmond having agreed on a 
constitution, by a majority of ten, as the report is this morning. 
The court meantime is proceeding diligently with its docket of 
causes. Judge Story is well and in good spirits. The weather 
to-day is like May. Neither House sits. My wife is gone to the 
Capitol, House of Representatives, to hear Mr. Everett's address 
to the Columbia Institute. Julia is at her writing master's, and 
while a gentleman is occupying the attention of the court with 
thf reading of a shocking long record, I have found time to 
write you a shocking long letter, which an apology would but 
further protract. 

Yours always, 

D. WEBSTER. 



DANIEL WEBSTER TO MRS. E. WEBSTER. 

January 17, 1830. 

MY DEAR SISTER, I have not heard from you since I left 
Boston, until this day, when I received a letter from C. B. Haddock. He informs me you are at Concord, where your mother 
is dangerously ill. I grieve for this new calamity. Providence 
has seen fit to let your sorrows and misfortunes come together. 
Be assured no one can feel for you more sympathy than myself, 
who know how much you have suffered for those dear to me. 
Your mother, however, has arrived at good old age, and her 
departure from this to a better state, would not and ought not 
to be so violent a disruption of strong ties as some that you 
have felt. 

I parted with you, I think, the first day of October, not ai, all 
foreseeing what was to happen to myself in so short a time. I 
am now here, settled down for the session, with Mrs. Webster 
;ind Julia. When I left home, I did not expect to bring Julia 
further than New York. She was to have returned with Mr. 
Paige ; but Mrs. Webster chose to have it otherwise, and I believe it is much better as it is. Julia seems exceedingly happy. 
Her health is better than I ever saw it, and she is much attached 
to her new mother. With this last personage, I am sure you 
will be pleased. You will find her amiable, affectionate, pru
dent, and agreeable ; as these are good sober words, you must 
take them as used for what they ought to mean, and not as the 
rhapsody of a new husband. It will not be many months, however, I hope, before I shall bring her and yourself face to face, 
and then you can judge for yourself. 

I hope you will write to me, and let me know how and where 
the children are. Send them my love, and remember me to 
Mrs. French. 

I am, my dear sister, with unabated affection and regard, yours 
truly, 

D. WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Washington, January 19, 1830. 

MY DEAR NEPHEW, If Messrs. Perkins and Marvin choose 
to run the risk of such a publication as you mention, I do not 
know as I can reasonably object to it; though, sure enough, I 
shall be ashamed to see the likeness of my face in the shop windows, as I go from my house to Court street. 

As to any introductory notice, or family memoir, I shall leave 
that to your own good taste, with the reservation that I must 
see whatever is prepared before it is published. I hardly know 
what there is, not already known as mine, which it would be worth 
while to print. There are, however, some reviews, and an address to the Phi Beta Kappa, in 1806, which for a boy I thought 
pretty good ; but I have not read it since it was delivered. I 
remember, among other things in it, I urged the necessity of 
forming agricultural and historical societies, when there were 
no such things in the State. 

. Joshua Coffin has looked up some genealogical dates, &c., 
as you will see by the enclosed letter, which you will please 
preserve. Major Bohonon sent me a minute of some dates, which 
might help you, in regard to the gravestones, but I left them in 
Boston. I think the best way is to send to Mr. Farley whatever is ready, and let him go on with that. 

I am glad you are going to take an active part in the settlement 
of affairs at Boscawen. The faster things are adjusted the better. As to the farm, I would have you, of course, consider what 
41* 
will be best for your wards. It is not essential to sell before my 
return. I will buy, rather than suffer it to remain as it is, if it be 
thought best by you to sell it for what I can afford to give. I 
have no doubt what is for the children's interest, my only hesitation is, as to what I can afford to do myself. The whole farm 
would yield very little income to me, and yet I feel unwilling to 
sell it altogether ; I wish you were rich enough to own it. Let 
me hear from you when you get your letter of guardianship, and 
as much sooner as you find it convenient. 

I am affectionately yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



CHANCELLOR KENT TO MR. WEBSTER. 

New York, January 21, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, I ought to have replied earlier to your letter of 
the 15th instant ; but I have been diverted by a number of perplexing avocations, each of them, singly, petty in its nature ; but 
conjointly such things make up the sum of the life of ordinary 
minds. And now to the purpose. I beg leave to decline any 
opinion on the question you state. 1. I have not time to do it 
justice and render any thing I could say worthy of you. 2. I 
am not going to undertake to instruct a Senatorial statesman, 
who has thought on the subject infinitely more than I have, for 
it comes officially before him. 

Hamilton, in The Federalist, No. 77, was of opinion that the 
President could not remove without the consent of the Senate. 
I heard the question debated in the summer of 1789, and Madison, Benson, Ames, Lawrence, &c., x were in favor of the right 
of removal by the President, and such has been the opinion 
ever since, and the practice. I thought they were right, 
because I then thought this side uniformly right. Mr. White 
of Virginia, was strenuously opposed to that construction. You 
will find the discussion in Fenno's United States Gazeteer for 
July or August, or September, 1789. Mr. Madison reasoned 
technically like a lawyer. Now, when I come to think on the 
subject, with my confirmed wary views of things, I pause and 
doubt of the construction, on account of the word " advice." 
That word is pregnant with meaning, and means something 

beyond consent to nominations, or it would not have been inserted. The consent, so it might be argued, applies to the 
individual named ; the advice to the measure itself, which 
draws to it the whole ground of the interference. Again, it is a 
great and general principle, in all jurisprudence, that when there 
is no positive provision in the case regulating the principle, the 
power that appoints is the power to determine the pleasure of 
the appointment and the limitation. It is the power to reappoint ; and the power to appoint and reappoint, when all else is 
silent, is the power to remove. I begin to have a strong suspicion that Hamilton was right, as he always was on public 
questions. 

On the other hand it is too late to call the President's power in 
question, after a declaratory act of Congress and an acquiescence 
of half a century. We should hurt the reputation of our government with the world, and we are accused already of the 
Republican tendency of reducing all executive power into the 
legislative, and making Congress a national convention. That 
the President grossly abuses the power of removal is manifest, but it is the evil genius of Democracy to be the sport of 
factions. Hamilton said in The Federalist, in his speeches, and a 
hundred times to me, that factions would ruin us, and our government had not sufficient balance and energy to resist the propensity to them, and to control their tyranny and their profligacy. 
All theories of government that suppose the mass of the people 
virtuous, and able and willing to act virtuously, are plainly 
Utopian, and will remain so until the return of the Saturnian 
age. 

Yours very sincerely, 

JAMES KENT. 

P. S. I never heard of any such book written by Mr. Wells, 
and I don't believe he ever wrote any such. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

Washington, February 27, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, The press has sent abroad all I said in the late 
debate, and you will have seen it. I have paid what attention 
I could to the reporter's notes ; but, in the midst of other pressing engagements, I have not made either speech what it ought 
to be ; but let them go. The whole matter was quite unexpected. I was busy with the court, and paying no attention to 
the debate which was going on sluggishly in the Senate, without exciting any interest. Happening to have nothing to do for 
the moment, in court, I went into the Senate, and Mr. Hayne, 
so it turned out, just then rose. When he sat down, my friends 
said he must be answered, and I thought so too, -and being thus 
got in, thought I must go through. It is singular enough, though 
perhaps not unaccountable, that the feeling of this little public 
is all on our side. I may say to you that I never before spoke 
in* the hearing of an audience so excited, so eager, and so sympathetic. 

The appointments are not yet acted on, though I am expecting them to be taken up daily. Hill's chance is just about even. 
It depends on a single vote, or two at most, and they keep their 
own counsels, so that we shall never know till the time of voting 
comes. Decatur's chance is not equal. I think he will be 
rejected. I have some hopes that all the printers will be thrown 
out ; but there is no certainty about it. Calhoun is forming a 
party against Van Buren, and as the President is supposed 
to be Van Buren's man, the Vice- President has great difficulty 
to separate his opposition to Van Buren from opposition to the 
President Our idea is to let them pretty much alone ; by no 
means to act a secondary part to either. We never can and 
never must support either. 

While they are thus arranging themselves for battle, that is, 
Calhoun and Van Buren, there are two considerations which are 
likely to be overlooked, or disregarded by them, and which are 
material to be considered. 1. The probability that General 
Jackson will run again ; that that is his present purpose, I am 
quite sure. 2. The extraordinary power of this anti- Masonic 
party, especially in Pennsylvania. 

Judge Story has been ill, so as to be out of court for three or 
four days. He is now well again. Mr. Justice Baldwin is 
thought to give promise of being a very good judge. The other 
new judge, I fear, has his head turned too much to politics. 

I have been written to, to go to New Hampshire to try a cause 
against you next August, brought by Mrs. Mellen v. Dover 
Company. Where is the August court holden ? I suppose up at 
the Lakes. If it were an easy and plain case on our side, I 
might be willing to go ; but I have some of your pounding in 
my bones yet, and don't care about any more till that wears 
out. 

Yours ever truly, with regards to your family, 

DANIEL WEBSTER. 



MR. A. LAWRENCE TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Boston, March 3, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, Permit me to indulge my feelings, after the 
banquet I have just had in reading your speech, by expressing 
to you my grateful sense of obligation, for the favor conferred 
on me, in common with every other son of New England, for 
your triumphant vindication of her character from the foul 
aspersions cast upon it by the South ; and to assure you that 
my sense of the value and importance of this service, will only 
cease with the healthy exercise of my mind. I thank you as a 
citizen of Massachusetts, of New England, of the United States, 
not only for myself, but for my children. The vindication of 
New England is not more complete than is that of the Constitution of the United States, from the libels which these same 
citizens of the South would fasten upon it. The doctrines you 
have laid down are sound doctrines, and stated so plainly that 
all may understand them, and they will prove a safe political 
manual for our children after us. 

Again I thank you. This humble tribute I pray you to 
accept with the assurance that I offer it, not less to gratify my 
own feelings, than from a sense of obligation for a great favor 
received by your unfeigned friend, 

AMOS LAWRENCE. 


MR. WEBSTER TO MR. HADDOCK. 

Washington, March 4, 1830. 

DEAR CHARLES, I received duly yours of the 17th of February. Affairs at Salisbury may as well remain as they are, till I 
get home. We will then endeavor to meet in that region, and 
settle some arrangements. I am glad that Mrs. Webster and the 
children are with you, and pray you to remember me to them. 
We ourselves are all well. 

As to my " Works," if a book is to be made, I should think 
the following might be selected : 

1. Plymouth Discourse ; I think this the best of my efforts. 
2. Bunker Hill. 3. Adams and Jefferson. 4. Greek Speech. 
5. Tariff Speech of 1824. 6. Panama Mission. 7. Bank 
Speech. 8. Currency Speech, 1816, which I have caused to be 
copied and now send ; but I have not read a word of it since it 
was delivered. Dinner Speeches, Boston. Faneuil Hall, Election Speeches. Two Speeches of this Session. Speech, 
Revolutionary Officers ; there are two of this description, pretty 
much alike. I do not know which is best ; but one of them 
should be printed. 

If any law speeches be printed, I think the following the 
best iDartmouth College case, Steamboat case, and Prescott's 
defence ; but I have never read this ; I have quite forgotten it. 

You speak of the Dedham speech ; I do not know what you 
refer to. I defended Judge Haven on an indictment, growing 
out of an ecclesiastical dispute at Dedham ; but the speech was 
never published, to my knowledge. The Address to the Mechanics' Association might be rigged up and put in for variety. 
I doubt whether there is any thing readable in what I said in 
Convention. Those debates might be looked to. I doubt 
whether it will be worth while to begin the work till I get home. 
A good deal of care should be bestowed upon it ; and such a 
publication at the present moment will have so many bearings, 
that it must be well considered what it should contain. We 
can have no family memoir. As to biographical notices, if any, 
they must be exceedingly brief. If, however, it is matter of 
importance to the printers to begin earlier, you may let me 

know it. The picture is by Stewart ; it is at Mr. I. P. Davis's. 
I suppose that he would suffer it to be used by a distinguished 
engraver, if it were thought best to have an engraving. If I 
could pick up what I said year before last to your boys at 
Hanover, and what I said last year to those of Amherst, they 
could be put together and make something which would eke 
out variety. 

With regards to your family, 

Yours, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. One volume would be enough in all conscience. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PLEASANTS. 

[Draft of a letter found in Mr. Webster's handwriting.] 

(PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.) 

Washington, March 6, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, Soon after I had posted a speech to you this 
morning, I received yours of the 4th instant. I am glad you 
have written to me on general accounts ; I need not say how 
much I am gratified to learn there are some in Virginia who 
think of my efforts without disrespect. To tell you the truth, I 
have sometimes felt that while political foes have- dealt to me 
in your good State, a large measure of abuse, political friends 
have not always interposed a shield, under circumstances when 
perhaps it might have been expected by one engaged in the 
same general public cause. But I have no hard feeling in this 
respect. I knew there were reasons why some of us should bear 
abuse, without expecting to be defended. That time I hope 
has gone by ; at any rate I should not hope to find myself in 
such a condition again. I am willing to correspond with you j 
freely, but in entire and sacred confidence. Through life, thus 
far, I have been as much guarded as possible against the accidents of the post-office and other accidents attending confidential 
correspondence. Nevertheless, the times require occasional confidence, and that some hazards be run. I am willing therefore 
to write you an occasional letter, knowing that I shall be safe, 
even if I had secrets to communicate, which will not often be 
the case. I shall be glad also to hear from you often. You 
may rely on confidence on my side. 

At present there is not much to be said, growing out of the 
state of things here. The most objectional nominations have 
not yet been acted on. It is quite uncertain how they will 
be disposed of. The Senate will be so nearly equally divided, 
that a vote or two will decide sundry nominations, and no one 
can say how these votes may be given. There will be close 
voting certainly in several cases. I agree with you, it is a 
balanced question, whether more good will flow from the rejection than from the confirmation. It would disappoint individuals, doubtless ; but would it not, on the whole, rather strengthen 
the administration to send Hill, Kendall, &c. home ? As to 
future operations, the general idea here seems to be this ; to 
bring forward no candidate this year, though doubtless the 
general impression is that Mr. Clay stands first and foremost in 
the ranks of those who would desire a change. I do not think 
there is the least abatement of the respect and confidence entertained for him. As to the other Western gentleman whom 
you mention, he must not be thought of, for he is not with us. 
Depend upon it, there is a negotiation in train to bring him out 
as Vice-President, to run on the ticket with Mr. Calhoun. In my 
opinion he has very little weight or influence in the country, and 
that is fast declining. Our friends in the West will quit him, 
of course, in that event, as he must give up their interests. I 
write now to say, that two things are not to be omitted when 
we speculate on the future; first, that General Jackson will 
certainly be candidate again, if he live and be well; I say certainly, I mean only that I have no doubt of it. Second, that 
we cannot now foresee what events will follow from what is 
p;i ing in Pennsylvania and New York on the subject of antiMasonry ; this matter, be assured, is not to be disregarded. 

In the mean time it seems to me our course must be this. 
Expose the selfishness and pretence of the men in power, as 
much as possible; taking care to let the ministers be made 
responsible for at least their full share. The acts will be theirs 
in most cases ; and therefore they ought to be responsible for 
them themselves. 

Show ourselves uniform and just, by acting according to our 
principles, and opposing only such measures as deserve no 
support. 

As to tariff subjects, we of the North must hold on where we 
are, and as to internal improvements, we also must go temperately and cautiously for them also. 

Agree in all measures having in view the payment of the 
debt. 

To hold ourselves absolutely aloof from Mr. Van Buren and 
Mr. Calhoun, and be ready to act for ourselves when the proper 
time comes, and to maintain our own men and defend our own 
friends. 

Finally, cultivate a truly national spirit ; go for great ends, 
and hold up the necessity of the Union, &c. &c. 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 



MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BUTTON. 

Washington, March 8, 1830. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for your friendly and flattering 
letter. Your commendation of my speech is measured less by 
its merits than by your bounty. If it has gratified my friends 
at home, I am rewarded for any little trouble it has cost me. 
The whole debate was matter of accident. I had left the court 
pretty late in the day, and went into the Senate with my court 
papers under my arm, just to see what was passing. It so 
happened that Mr. Hayne very soon rose in his first speech. I 
did not like it, and my friends liked it less; some of them 
reminded me, that some years ago a debate had happened in 
the House of Representatives, in which Mr. M'Duffie and myself 
had expressed opinions exactly the reverse of what was now 
ascribed respectively to the South and East. I had forgotten 
the circumstance, but promised to turn back to the debates to 
see how the matter was ; I did so, and found it as stated, and 
referred tc it. This was one of the things that excited General 
Hayne ; he found his narrow policy near home. Another was 
an allusion made by me, without any studied respect, I acknowlVOL. i. 42 
edge, to their Carolina notions. He was very angry, and when 
he rose to oppose a day or two's postponement, as I wished to 
be in the court, talked perhaps a little too largely of what he 
was going to do. One thing is singular enough, and I can 
mention it to you without danger of your ascribing the remark 
to any wrong cause. I never spoke in the presence of an audience so eager and so sympathetic. The public feeling here 
was on our side almost universally. This is partly owing, no 
doubt, to the system of reform which has been brought to 
bear on so many individuals and so many families here. In 
the pamphlet I sent, some strange errors are corrected. In 
looking over the printed notes, I made them read, in one place, 
" There is no such thing as half allegiance and half rebellion ; no 
treason made easy ! " in allusion to books, you know, entitled 
" geometry made easy ! " " logic made easy," &c. The printer 
put it " treason madcosy ! " Twice I corrected the proof, and 
wrote, as I thought, plain enough, " made easy.*' But I could 
not make it easy, and so it has gone through the Union : 
" Treason madcosy ! " Pray, what did you think that meant ? 
Finally, I went to the press and had the whole sentence struck 
out. 

Pray give my best regards to Mrs. Dutton. Mrs. Webster 
reciprocates your and her good wishes with all her heart. She 
has fully made up her mind, she says, to like New England, and 
is not quite certain, moreover, that it will require any great 
effort. I believe she is predestinated to be a good New Englander. Our excellent friend, Judge Story, is well and in good 
spirits. He seems to like his new associate, Judge Baldwin, 
quite well D. WEBSTER. 



MR. MASON TO MR. WEBSTER. 



Portsmouth, March 8, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, Not being on good terms with Mr. A., and not 
liking to write him on the subject you mention, I have requested 
Robert Means to make the desired inquiries. If any thing can 
be ascertained from him, I think it can be done better by conversation than by writing. When I know the result, I will 

inform you. I have no recollection of ever writing to him on 
the subject alluded to. I have read your last speech with great 
delight; it was sent me in pamphlet form from Boston. My 
expectation was highly raised, and I can truly say it has been 
fully satisfied. Your defence of New England is all that could 
be desired, and you have been most fortunate in effecting it, 
without polluting your own hands with any of the filth that 
was so abundantly collected round you. But the constitutional 
argument is of vastly greater importance. I have read that 
with great attention, and I think it unanswerable. If I mistake 
not, it cannot fail of producing a sensible effect even in South 
Carolina. If Colonel Hayne's answer is received as the true 
construction of the Constitution, our government is at an end. 
The sophistical Virginia resolutions of 1798, afford the only 
support of this wild doctrine. Mr. Madison, by adopting your 
gloss upon his resolutions, might atone for all his political sins, 
and confer a greater benefit on his country than he has done by 
the labor of a long life. But of his doing this I fear there is no 
hope. 

This is our election day. Colonel Upham has a majority of 
about one hundred in this town; I do not know the exact 
number. We have succeeded in choosing five anti- Jackson 
representatives. Strong hopes are entertained of an anti-Jackson House of Representatives. This is important, as a senator 
of the United States is to be chosen. Upham's chance for 
governor is thought to be tolerable. The forged papers, lately 
returned by Hill, from Washington, have done much for him 
about here. If they have been as efficient in other parts of the 
State, he is elected. The papers were lately brought here, and 
pronounced to be forgeries by all who saw them, except I. W. 
and E. W. W. is supposed to have the promise of Decatur's 
place, in case he should be rejected by the Senate. 

The suit of Mrs. Mellen against the Dover Manufacturing 
Company must, I believe, end in nothing. If there be any 
thing to argue in it, it must be a mere question of law, which I 
think cannot come on at the next term, which is to be held at 
Gilford, If you are inclined to come again to the old county 
of StrafFord to argue a cause, you had best be engaged for the 
defendants, who are able and will be willing, if the case raises 
any question, to pay you good fees. The plaintiff has, I believe, 
spent all her money already. I think you had best not engage 
before I see you. 

Affectionately yours, 

J. MASON.

MR. MADISON TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Montpelier, March 15, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, I return my thanks for the copy of your late very 
powerful speech in the Senate of the United States. It crushes 
" nullification," and must hasten an abandonment of secession. 
But this dodges the blow by confounding the claim to secede at 
will, with the right of seceding from intolerable oppression. 

The former answers itself, being a violation without cause, of 
a faith solemnly pledged. The latter is another name only for 
revolution, about which there is no theoretic controversy. Its 
double aspect, nevertheless, with the countenance received from 
certain quarters, is giving it a popular currency here, which may 
influence the approaching elections, both for Congress and for 
the State legislatures. It has gained some advantage also by 
mixing itself with the question, whether the Constitution of the 
United States was formed by the people or by the States, now 
under a theoretic discussion by animated partisans. 

It is fortunate when disputed theories can be decided by 
undisputed facts. And here the undisputed fact is that the 
Constitution was made by the people, but as embodied into the 
several States who were parties to rt, and therefore made by the 
States, in their highest authoritative capacity. 

They might by the same authority and by the same process 
have converted the confederacy into a mere league or treaty, or 
continued it with enlarged or abridged powers; or have embodied the people of their respective States into one people, 
nation, or sovereignty; or, as they did by a mixed form, make 
them one people, nation, or sovereignty, for certain purposes, 
and not so for others. 

The Constitution of the United States, being established by 
si competent authority, by that of the people of the several 
States, who were the parties to it, it remains onlyto inquire 
the Constitution is, and here it speaks for itself. It organizes a government into the usual legislative, executive, and 
judiciary departments ; invests it with specified powers, leaving 
others to the parties to the Constitution ; it makes the government to operate directly on the people ; places at its command 
the needful physical means of executing its powers ; and finally 
proclaims its supremacy, and that of the laws made in pursuance of it, over the Constitution and laws of the States ; 
the powers of the government being exercised, as in other 
elective and responsible governments, under the control of its 
constituents, the people and legislatures of the States, and subject to the revolutionary rights of the people, in extreme cases. 

Such is the Constitution of the United States de jure and de 
facto; and the name, whatever it be, that may be given to it, 
can make it nothing more nor less than what it actually is. 

Pardon this hasty effusion, which, whether according or not 
precisely with your ideas, presents, I am aware, none that are 
new to you. 

With great esteem and cordial salutation, 

JAMES MADISON.

MR. SULLIVAN TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Boston, March 23, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, I have not done justice to you or myself in not 
having sooner acknowledged the favor conferred by you, in sending to me your speeches on Mr. Foote's resolution. The delay 
enables me to speak confidently of public opinion on your 
achievements ; an opinion not formed under sudden impulses, 
but with good judgment and full means of using it. This 
opinion appears to me to be, that your speeches on this occasion not only excel all former ones, made by you, but by every 
other man in our own country ; and that out of it, we must go 
back to the days of Burke, Chatham, &c. to find objects of 
comparison. This is the opinion of the club ; and some of its 
members, you know, are judges, and very good ones. It seems 
to me, iliat the most valuable quality of these speeches is, that 
they teach the citizens in general what their relation to the 
Federal government is ; and in a manner so comprehensible 
and satisfactory that every one not only assents, but is surprised that the doctrine should not have been familiar to him, 
and even that the same train of thought should not have occurred to his own mind. It is a pleasure to your friends here 
to be able to infer, from the effect produced in different parts of 
the Union, that an individual, even without the aid of war, and 
great public excitement, can raise himself to an elevation, on 
which he may be viewed from all parts of an extensive empire, 
with an honorable national pride. This is something to set off 
against military delusion. 

I presume we have here as you have in Washington, many 
groundless assertions and items of news. Of late the rumors have 
turned on new coalitions ; the latest is, I think, to this effect ; 
that Mr. Van Buren and yourself have come to an understanding, but whether with the consent and approbation of Mr. Clay, 
or without consulting him, rumor seems not to know. 

The election pending here is of considerable importance ; but 
I do not find that any influential and discreet men are attempting to give it a proper direction. The representation of the 
county in the Senate is of much importance the coming year, 
on account of the valuation. The court are sitting, and will 
continue to sit about a fortnight longer. They have a great 
deal to do; and more than four men can possibly do. The 
subjects apart from home politics most spoken of here, are the 
discouraging state of things in England, and the want of talent 
in the public men there ; some persons intimating that great 
changes must soon occur ; and the continuance of similar embarrassments in this region. I do not hear any one speak of 
changes for the better, or even the hope of them. 

As to mere town news, Mr. Thorndike is said to be much 
indisposed. Mr. Ritchie is to review Jefferson's works; Alex. 
E. is said to have become proprietor of the North American 
Review. Mr. Otis has been well enough to dine with the 
" Young Fish " lately. Mr. Sears and family are coming home 
in the spring. My own family are well; I noticed last evening 
that some of them were busy in making extracts from the poets, 
on small slips of paper, to be deposited in the cornucopia of the 
confectioners for future use. 

It is a cold snowy day, the wind from the northeast; and 
one of those days in which one must plunge into business or 
pleasure within doors, to escape the misery of feeling what is 

going on without. An excellent day it might be made around 
a table, with six or eight congenial minds, with something fit 
thereon for use. Formerly, when the wind was damp and eastwardly, a small piece of salmon, and a brant apiece for six. in 
a snug room, with something liquid that could tell of the last 
century, had a tendency to make one forget which way the 
wind was. Whether the times are so bad that the like effects 
would not follow from such causes, is a point which I should be 
willing to test by actual experiment. 

I beg leave to tender my best respects to Mrs. Webster ; if you 
should know when the ladies of Boston may expect the pleasure 
of seeing her among them, and should tell me of it, I should be 
glad to be the medium of such news. 

With great regard, respect, and thankfulness as your fellowcitizen, your obliged friend, 

WM. SULLIVAN.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. DAVIS. 

Washington March 29, 1830. 

MY DEAR SIR, I perceive the booksellers are threatening to 
afflict the community with a book, made up of my Speeches. 
This offence is one for which they are answerable only to the 
public, and to their own pockets. Bat it seems further intended 
that I shall be compelled to lend my countenance to the undertaking ; to this I demur. By an advertisement which happened 
to catch my eye in the National Intelligencer this morning, it 
would seem that the book is to have a head in it from Stuart's 
picture. This is without my consent ; and I suppose it is only 
said subject to a tacit condition that such consent should be 
first had and obtained. I have written the proposed publishers 
on the subject The object of this is merely to repeat to you 
the substance of what I have said to them. If they insist, first 
on making the book, which I suspect they had better not do ; 
and, secondly, on having a head in it, which I do not at all desire they should, but prefer much they should not, I am willing 
to take the proper course to have a correct and handsome engraving from Stuart's picture, or from one to be made by Harding. 
I am against all lithographic things. 
As yet I have not consented that any body should make an 
engraving from Stuart 

You will see the proposed publishers easily, and can learn 
from them their wishes more at large. I should like your opinion, whether to have an engraving from Stuart, or to give Harding a sitting for that purpose. 

Mrs. Webster will leave me in about three weeks for New 
York. I shall hasten thither, and thence to Boston, the moment 
the session closes. I hope to be home by the 25th of May. If 
I should, we must once more wet a line together in Marshfield. 

Remember me kindly to Mrs. Davis, and believe me truly 
yours, 

D. WEBSTER

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. BUTTON. 

Washington, May 9, 1830. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you for your favor of April 19. To 
receive a letter at Washington which says nothing of business, 
little of politics, and gives a little honest Boston talk, such as 
the writer and the reader might hold together if they were taking 
a turn in the Mall, is quite refreshing. In general, when I open 
a letter, the silent question which I put to myself is, who is this 
that wants a cadetship or a midshipman's warrant, or an office, 
or an errand done at one of the departments ? Now and then, 
it is true, there is a professional letter of rather more agreeable 
contents. My new wife ran away a fortnight ago, and took 
Julia with her. She is visiting her friends and leaving her 
P. P. C.'s in New York ; so that when I catch up with her, as 
the boys say at school, she may be ready for transplantation 
to Boston. When that will be I cannot exactly tell. Nothing 
moves me but time, or rather, we aU keep in motion without 
making progress; like that movement among soldiers which 
3 called marking time, when they lift up their feet and put 
them down again, without going forward. We have been principally occupied in marking time since the first Monday in 
December. 

For the next two weeks, we shall have a scene of confusion ; 
some pressing to take up particular measures, some pressing to 

keep them off. " Indian Bill," " Tariff," " Massachusetts Claim," 
" Time of adjournment." A din will come from all these, and 
twenty more such, enough to split the ear. 

The tariff bill improperly so called will pass the House 
and probably the Senate. Our Massachusetts delegation in the 
House have greatly distinguished themselves on that measure. 
They appear to me to have overcome the Southrons in the judgment of all the impartial. Mr. Gorham made an excellent 
speech ; it was clear, strong, and manly. There was less o f his 
peculiar ingenuity than I have witnessed in some former instances, but far more decision and force than in any other effort 
of his, within my knowledge. Davis had immediately preceded 
him, and necessarily occupied some of his ground. You know 
little probably of Davis. He is a singularly clear-headed man. 
You will read his speech with great pleasure, that is, if you can 
ever read with pleasure, speeches on questions of political economy, and connected with it. For my part, though I like the 
investigation of particular questions, I give up what is called 
the " science of political economy." There is no such science. 
There are no rules on these subjects so fixed and invariable as 
that their aggregate constitutes a science. I believe I have 
recently ran over twenty volumes, from Adam Smith to Professor Dew, of Virginia, and from the whole, if I were to pick out 
with one hand all the mere truisms, and with the other all the 
doubtful propositions, little would be left. 

On Monday we propose to take up Kendall and Noah. My 
expectation is that they will both be confirmed by the castingvote of the Vice-President, if the Senate should be full, as I 
think it will be. A week ago I was confident of their rejection, 
but one man who was relied on will yield, I am fearful, to fhe 
importunities of friends and the dragooning of party. We have 
had a good deal of debate in closed session, on these subjects, 
and sometimes pretty warm. Some of the speeches, I suppose, 
will be hereafter published, none of mine, however. Were it 
not for the fear of the out-door popularity of General Jackson, the 
Senate would have negatived more than half his nominations. 

There is a burning fire of discontent, that must, I think, some 
day break out. When men go so far as to speak warmly against 
things which they yet feel bound to vote for, we may hope they 
will soon go a little further. No more of politics. We have 
now and then a Bostonian or two here. Your Jackson friends 
would not stay long enough to see or be seen. William Sawyer 
and Powell Mason are here, bound to Cincinnati. Mr. D. P. 
Parker is here also, with his daughter, and so is my countryman, 
that good citizen of the world, Mr. A. E. Belknap. 

I am right down homesick ; I want to go to Sandwich with 
I. P., first having had a look at you all. At any rate, I wish to 
shift this present scene; to get out of the Pennsylvania Avenue ; 
to hear no more of bills, resolutions, and motions. I never felt 
more completely weary of a session. If it do not terminate 
soon, I shall run away and leave it. 

I pray you to make my very best regards to Mrs. Dutton. 
Yours ever truly, D. WEBSTER. 

P. S. If, instead of a letter, I could send you peas and strawberries, which were very fine on our table yesterday, I think it 
would bo a better offering.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WILLIAM SULLIVAN. 

Washington, May 22, 1830. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter gives me an opportunity of talking freely on a subject which has been suggested to me from 
various quarters, and about which I have not said much. I am 
inclined to avail myself of this opportunity to talk right out, and 
give you the whole of my notions in regard to the matter. 

1. I have heard that the good people of Boston would, some 
of them, like to show me some proof of kindness by a dinner, a 
ball, or something else. 2. That the mode or manner is not yet 
decided, and that all rests, as yet, in intention. Now I shall 
open my heart to you without reserve. 

As to a dinner, there seem to me to be insuperable objections 
to it. I have received that compliment once, as you know, two 
years ago ; it would, therefore, be nothing new. But what is 
more important, other persons' feelings might be injured. Our 
immediate representative has acquitted himself very ably in the 
House of Representatives, and done great honor to the State ; 
so has Davis, and so has Everett. In truth, our whole delega
tion in the House of Representatives is uncommonly able, and 
all true. My colleague, too, though an unpretending man, has 
been entirely true, and very useful in more cases and ways 
than one. Now it would be invidious to select me alone, as the 
object of any particular expression of regard ; I should, myself, 
feel that it would be in some measure unjust ; I should think 
they would have a right to feel hurt. 

And further, my friends know me, I know them ; a public 
dinner would be no additional proof of regard ; I am as sun; 
of their good wishes and esteem as if they were to give me a 
dozen dinners, and ring all the bells for a fortnight. Then, 
would it do good elsewhere ? I think not. It would necessarily 
have some political cast, and, however prudently it might be 
conducted, I suspect it could hardly do good abroad. I am, 
therefore, my dear Sir, against a dinner, and, indeed, against all 
ostentation and show, and parade. I believe the interest as 
well of my constituents as of myself, is likely to be better promoted by abstaining from all such things. I shall see all Boston, 
and much of the Commonwealth, in the course of the summer, 
and shall have an opportunity of seeing and shaking hands with 
most, or many, of those who take an interest in me, or would 
wish to give me congratulation. 

As to a ball, the sun rides too high for that. Let us think of 
that in October. 

And now I will tell you what may be done if you and others 
see fit. If fifty gentlemen are inclined to make a subscription 
for a piece of plate, say an urn or some such thing, let them do 
so. One single article, of size to bear an inscription, would 
probably be better than more and smaller ones. Yet even this 
last, which is your suggestion, would be perfectly well. 

I have thus spoken to you in confidence, freely and unreservedly. Whatever you and others do, or omit, excepting always 
a dinner, and any thing else that is ostentatious, will be perfectly 
satisfactory to me. I know you will, some of you at least, be 
glad to see me, and that itself is high gratification. I owe my 
neighbors infinitely more than they can ever owe me ; and I am 
satisfied, and gratified, and more than compensated a thousand 
times, for any labors or efforts of mine, by the consciousness 
that I am thought to have done some little good. 

God bless you. Yours, D. W.

MR. CLAY TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Ashland, June 7, 1830. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your favor of the 29th ult. is duly received. 
The decision of my friends at Washington to stand still for the 
present, and to leave the first movement to Maryland, was best 
under all circumstances. Their opinion that I should go nowhere for political effect, is in conformity to my judgment and 
to my principles. I could not have gone every where that I was 
pressed to go, and dissatisfaction might have been given at 
places which I did not visit. I think further that you are right 
in supposing considerations of policy to be opposed to a nomination at present in Massachusetts. To me personally it would 
be highly gratifying, but then the question is not, what is most 
agreeable, but what is most expedient. 

The exercise of the veto on the Maysville bill has produced 
uncommon excitement in Kentucky. I have not yet heard from 
other States. Prior to it, the public discontent with Mr. Bibb 
broke out in violent forms ; and in the neighboring village of 
Lexington, most of the respectable, and some of the least worthy 
of Jackson's supporters have openly renounced their faith. 

We shall attack 4he veto, by proposing an amendment 
of the constitution to restrict it, so as to require a majority of 
all the members elected to each branch of the Congress, instead 
of two thirds, subsequently, to pass the bill. I think such an 
amendment right, otherwise I would discountenance it. It is 
conformable to the analogy of many of the State constitutions, 
including our own; and it is in the spirit of our institutions. 

The policy of such an attack is obvious. The other party will 
of course defend it, and we shall get the weather-gage of them. 
We will put them on the aristocratic bench, and more than balance the account of their proposition to amend the constitution 
in regard to the Presidential election. 

You will consider how far it may be right and expedient, in 
proper time, to cooperate in this subject. 

The Maysville road leads entirely across that third part of 
Kentucky that was most favorable to Jackson. You can imagine, then, what effect must be produced by this event. We 
were safe before. Now, I think, we may be considered as abso


DANIEL WEBSTEK. 505 

rutely certain ; and we shall send you some good and true man, 
I hope Crittenden or Letcher, in place of Rowan. From all 
other parts of the West information continues to be good. 

I wish you were now in the House of Representatives, but I 
doubt whether you ought to return to it. You need make no 
change to advance your fame ; you may rest entirely satisfied 
with what you have. The example to which you refer is not 
precisely in point ; I had never served in the House of Representatives, and I was about thirty-two. You have served long 
there, and you are forty-eight. 

I am happy to tell you that the very best effects have been 
produced by your vote, and that of our New England friends 
generally, for the Maysville road. It will not be forgotten. 

To guard against the treachery of the post-office, if you write 
me, put your letters under cover to James Harper, Lexington. 
To whom should I address mine ? 

Ever yours cordially, 

H. CLAY.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. DAVIS. 

Washington, June 30, 1830. 

DEAR SIR, I have received your letters, and am paying all 
due attention to the subject of cordage. I have drawn an 
amendment, like General Dearborn's in effect, and sent it to the 
committee, to whom the tariff bill is referred. I have spoken to 
four, out of five, of the committee, and I have no doubt they will 
report the desired amendment, and that it will pass. Depend 
upon it, I shall follow it up. It will not be either overlooked 
or overwhelmed by cries of " question," " question." 

I am almost worn out, and am getting to be as thin as a 
hatchet. I sigh for the seaside, and for repose. The House of 
Representatives will probably go to work on the Bank to-day, 
and soon settle it, one way or the other. Probably they will 
pass it, and probably too, as I think, the President will place 
his negative upon it. Others think otherwise. We shall see. 

Yours truly,

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. JUSTICE STORY. 

Salem, Wednesday, one o'clock, 11 August, 1830. 

MY DEAR SIR, J. J. Knapp's trial commenced yesterday 
morning, and has made little progress. The A. M. yesterday 
was occupied in impanelling a jury ; the p. M. mainly in debating whether the attorney-general had a right to bring in other 
counsel; on this question, their honors deliberated, and this 
morning agreed to let me in, I having stated to them that I appeared at the request of the attorney-general, and had not received, and should not receive, any fee in this case ; which, of 
course, was and is true. This A. M. has been employed in discussing the admissibility of the confessions, and the court holds 
the point under advisement. I expect they will be ruled out. 
If they be not, I shall not send you this letter ; if they be, then 
I shall find myself in such a situation, as that I shall be compelled to take some course, respecting the Rhode Island court. 
If the confessions be ruled out, there is no chance of finishing 
the cause, this week ; and I must inevitably abandon it, unless I 
can make some disposition about the time of hearing the cause 
of Farnham v. The Blackstone Canal. My engagement in that 
cause is early, absolute, and indispensable. It will come on, I 
suppose, Monday or Tuesday ; and the only question is, whether 
you can name a day next week for hearing it, at Providence, so 
late as to be certain of allowing me to be there. If not, I must 
leave this case on Saturday evening, at all events. 

I write you thus early, because I know not what else to do ; 
and because, if any thing is done, I must send off an express to 
Rhode Island. It is of great importance to the Messrs. Farnham, and I believe it is also the wish of the other party, to have 
the cause argued this term. Counsel on the other side do not 
consent to argue it in Boston, so I must go to Providence ; and 
the only question is, whether you can, at all events, stay at 
Providence till I can come. 

On reflection, I think it best to send this to you at once, 
because, even if the confession is admitted, the defendants' 
counsel may, under pretence of impeaching Frank Knapp's conviction, spin out the cause till Monday. 

The bearer of this will bring an answer. 

Yours always, D. WEBSTER.

MY DEAR FRIEND, I cannot tell you, indeed I cannot, how 
much I am distressed by the calamity which has fallen on you 
and your wife ; of all others, it seemed the least likely to happen. So mighty a loss, and so unexpected, does indeed require 
of you both all the exercise of your patience and submission. 
It has made a very deep impression on all our household ; and 
we all give you, in large measure, all we can give, our sympathy, and our participation in your grief. We can only pray 
God to succor and console you. 

I returned but last evening from Salem, after near a week's 
absence. On Monday, if weather permits, Mrs. Webster and 
her sisters leave this place for New York. I go with them, as 
far as Providence, whence I expect to return, and to remain at 
home till about December. I am most anxious to see you, and 
to help soothe, if I can, your great affliction. 
With the most fervent prayers for you both, I am, as ever, 
most sincerely and affectionately, yours,

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. C. B. HADDOCK. 

Washington, February 6, 1831. 

MY DEAR NEPHEW, I heard from you, at the early part of 
the session, and have omitted to answer longer than I intended. 
I was at Salisbury after I saw you, and gave directions about 
the farm. I think it best to put an end to separate interests 
there as soon as convenient. I suppose you have by this time 
obtained your license to sell. My hope and expectation now 
are to be in Boston the first day of April ; perhaps a little earlier. 
If you could arrange the sale for about the middle or 20th of 
April, I could conveniently attend it, as I propose to visit Salisbury in that month. In May and June, I doubt whether it will 
be in my power. If events come about according to my wishes, 
I hope to run away to Ohio, about the 1st of May. 

Partly on my own motion, and partly at the request of 
friends, I have been putting into writing something of my early 
history, dates, incidents, &c., touching early years. I have not 
made much progress, nor is there indeed much to be said, but I 
have run over a few sheets of paper. It has occurred to me, in 
connection with this subject, to suggest to you the expediency, 
as of your own motion, of writing to Rev. Dr. Wood of Boscawen, who, I hope, is yet living. He may have few or no incidents to relate, but his general recollection may possibly be worth 
preserving. I need not enlarge; you will understand me. It 
may be well to tell him, that the object is to preserve materials, 
not to be used in his lifetime or mine. I wish he would say 
something of my brother, whom he knew so well, and so long.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. MASON. 

New York, April 26, 1831. 

MY DEAR SIR, I came here Saturday, to bring my wife back 
to Boston, after spending a few days here with her friends. 
Having leisure this p. M. I incline to give it to the purpose of 
writing to you ; but I am not about to speak on the subject of 
the resignation of our wise ministry at Washington, or any 
other public subject. It is to talk of yourself. Before I left 
home last fall, I had resolved to make one more effort to bring 
you up to Boston. For particular reasons, then existing, I was 
induced to postpone the mentioning of the subject. I write 
now, simply to execute that intention; and to entreat you, 
earnestly, to consider of the expediency of such a measure. I 
will not presume to enter into the consideration which recommended it, at least in my opinion; but I will say that my 
opinion is strong and decisive on the point. I am persuaded 
a removal will add to your happiness, and that of your family. 
You will find as much professional employment as you may 
wish to engage in ; and you will find yourself surrounded by 
warm friends, who estimate you, as you deserve to be estimated. Your boys are now provided for. Your daughters are 
better at Boston than Portsmouth ; at Boston, you will find associations, topics, congenial minds, and objects of greater interest than now surround you. New York, perhaps, might be 
still better. But Boston is something. 

I am persuaded you dislike the idea of removal, and that 
that is the main obstacle. But that is a thing of a week. Once 
settled, and all that feeling is over. 

My dear Sir, although it would add greatly to my happiness, 
43* 
that you should come to Boston, I would not advise it, certainly, if I did not think it would promote yours, and promote 
it greatly. Indeed, I reproach myself for not having urged this 
point with you oftener. I wish to do it now, with earnestness ; 
I am sure I do it with sincerity. 

Ever truly and affectionately your friend,

DEAR WILLIAM, I am off to-morrow for Baltimore, thence

I am going down in aid of the railroad. My cold goes oft' 
slowly, but keeps going. Mrs. Webster and Julia were well at 
the last dates. I have a letter to-day from Fletcher ; please give 
my love to him, and tell him I will answer it as soon as I

I pray my best love to Harriette ; I hope she is by this time

oyster suppers. Remember me also to Mr. White and the girls. 
Do they talk and laugh as usual, or has the cold weather sealed

Mr. Appleton, our partner, and I get on quite well. He is

MR. WEBSTER TO MRS. TICKNOR. 

Washington, January 8, 1832. 

MY DEAR MRS. TICKNOR, Although I hardly know what to 
say to you by way of condolence in your affliction, yet I cannot 
bear to say nothing ; I am so desirous you should know how 
truly and deeply I sympathize with you, who have been near 
and most kind to me in my greatest trials. 

Your last severe affliction a good deal resembles my last; 
except that Providence, in taking one brother, has left you another, and has left beloved sisters also. When my poor brother 
fell, I was bereft of everything near to me in blood, except the 
little saplings of my own household. But I know that in these 
cases the heart does not reconcile itself to its loss by recollecting what it retains, though sometimes it clings the closer to 
what remains. In the ordinary losses of life, in disappointed 
hopes, in loss of fortune, and the whole train of common ills, a 
firm and elastic spirit gathers consolation and new hopes from 
various sources. But for that anguish of the heart which the 
death of beloved objects creates, there is no solace but 
Christian resignation ; no balm, but in the soft effusions of 
that spirit which can say, " Not as I will, but as thou wilt ! " 
Affliction, I am persuaded, properly borne, not only purifies 
but elevates the mind. Its tendency is to strengthen religious 
feeling, and to bring into more vigorous exercise, and to 
increase by such exercise, that devout trust which teaches 
us that all is in His hand, and assures us the end will be 
right. 

I pray you, my dear friend, to believe that, from the moment 
I first heard of Mr. Eliot's death, I have thought of you constantly and most affectionately, and I could not longer forbear 
some expression of my sympathy and regard. I implore for 
you and yours the best blessings of Heaven. 

Perhaps Mr. Ticknor will sometimes write me; I shall be 
very desirous of hearing from some of you. 

When a proper time comes, and you have a fit opportunity, I 
beg you to mention me to Mrs. Dwight, and tell her I share her 
sorrows. 

My own health, which has at various times since I left home, 
suffered from the prevailing epidemic, is now good. The court 
commences to-morrow. Judge Story has not arrived, but is 
looked for soon. I feel anxious about him, only because the 
weather has been so severe, and the journey by land is so 
tedious. 

With my most cordial regards to your husband, and love to 
your little ones, I am, dear Mrs. Ticknor, 

Truly and affectionately yours,

Washington, Tuesday Evening, January 3, 1832. 

DEAR WILLIAM, You will be glad to hear that I am safe 
back from Annapolis ; arrived at sunset this evening, having 
come across the country and not round by way of Baltimore. 
We were seven days, all of us, arguing our cause ; I used only 
part of one. It is not yet decided, though we left the judges 
there, and shall know in a day or two. The controversy is 
about a narrow pass, which both companies have occasion to 
occupy on the banks of the Potomac River, at the foot of a 
perpendicular precipice, where the river breaks through the 
Catoctin Mountain, one of the ridges of the Alleghany, or part 
of the Blue Ridge, more properly. There is not room enough 
for both routes. between the river and the foot of the mountain, 
and neither can take any other course without enormous expense. 
The canal has the oldest charter, but the railroad located first 
on this particular spot. The chances of the decision are thought 
to be about even ; I incline to think they preponderate a little 
in our favor. 

I pray you say to Mr. White, I thank him for his letter, and 
shall write him to-morrow. I see Mr. Worcester of Salisbury is 
dead. Love to Mrs. Paige and Edward.

MR. MERCER TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Fredericksburg, April 10, 1832. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received with great pleasure the 
pamphlet, which you have been so good as to forward to me. 
The same mail brought me, from Judge John Pitman of Providence, R. I., an oration delivered by him on the same interesting 
occasion, " The Centennial Birthday of Washington." 

I was associated with Judge Pitman some years ago on a 
board of visitors at West Point, and was much gratified in 
forming an acquaintance with a gentleman in all respects so 
estimable. This simultaneous proof of your regard and his is a 
very pleasing coincidence, and is much valued by me. 

I will ask your acceptance of an Eulogium pronounced by 
Bishop Madison on the death of General Washington, under 
the resolution of Congress ; which, as a profound statesman and 
American patriot, will afford you pleasure. There is a beautiful 
and eloquent allusion made to my revered father, whose character and services belong to the nation, and I have endeavored to 
preserve the discourse to our country, by having it republished 
in Philadelphia during the last summer. I hope you will approve of my having in this manner discharged what I thought 
was a filial, pious, and patriotic duty to my country, whose 
adopted son I am. 

Congress resolved in April, 1777, that monuments should be 
erected to the memory of General Warren and my father ; that 
the eldest son of General Warren and the youngest son of General Mercer should be educated at the public expense. I am 
that son, and since I reached my years of discretion and reflection, have had a steady eye upon the responsibilities which the 
sacred connection imposed on me. I was but five months of 
age when my venerated parent sealed with his blood his devotion to the cause of our Independence. His adopted country 
has not been ungrateful; his memory is embalmed in the 
reverence and affection of the whole American people. 

I had the honor of being introduced to you two years ago in 
the Senate Chamber ; had my stay afterwards in Washington 
permitted, I should certainly, as I very much desired, have 
waited upon you at your lodgings, as you kindly invited me to 
do. In a short conversation I had with you, you spoke with 
touching and patriotic sensibility of having visited the house, 
still standing near Princeton, in which my father died under his 
wounds. In July last I was in Philadelphia ; I made a visit to 
Princeton as privately as I could ; visited the battle-field and 
house, and waited upon two very venerable and respectable 
Quaker sisters in the vicinity, but occupants of the house in 
January, 1777, who assisted in nursing my gallant and dying 
father. This visit was surely of the most sacred character, and 
I felt it to be so. The maiden name of those sisters, still living, 
no doubt, is Clarke; one a widow, the other never having 
changed her state; one eighty-two years of age, the other 
seventy-eight. What remarkable circumstances, and how 
closely allied with one of the most interesting epochs in our 
revolutionary history ! They were much gratified upon my at 
length informing them who I was, and my object in visiting 
them; they gave me many interesting particulars of their 

attendance on my father. You are perhaps apprised that the 
body was removed under a military escort to Philadelphia. It 
was exposed one day in the coffee-house of that city to the 
army and people, and was then committed to the tomb in Christ 
churchyard, " followed by thirty thousand sympathizing mourners." j The monuments have not been reared, but the resolution 
of Congress, enrolled among the archives of the government, 
will endure with the republic, and will be more durable than 
monumental brass or marble. 

When in Philadelphia, about eighteen years ago, I felt a 
wish to place some memorial over the grave. The venerable 
gentleman, Mr. Dalby, who was sexton of the church at the 
time of the funeral, was living, and still the sexton. This information was given me by Bishop White, one of the chaplains to 
the army. I ascertained the residence of Mr. Dalby, (now numbered among the dead,) called on him, mdde myself known, and 
told him the object of my visit. He said he recollected well 
and never could forget " the great funeral ; " we met at Christ 
churchyard next morning at nine. Mr. Dalby pointed to a spot : 
" Underneath are the remains of your father." He called my 
attention to the letters G. M., rudely scratched on the brick wall 
immediately over the spot. They are intended, he said, for 
" General Mercer." Those letters were then plain, and easily 
seen ; time has since obliterated them entirely. I directed a plain 
marble slab with a simple inscription to be placed over the spot, 
and the venerable and excellent Bishop White was so good as

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PAIGE. 

Washington, Tuesday morning, April 24, 1832. 

DEAR WILLIAM, I have received yours respecting the lining 
of the chaise. I do not like a dark lining ; such linings look 
hot in summer, and in winter I go in a sleigh. I reject blue ; 
therefore, the body and carriage being dark, I suppose alight 
drab would not answer, and dark drab looks dull. On the 
whole, I am for a brown, or a claret, though if I know what a 
claret is, it is rather darker than I should like, yet I think it will 
do very well. Please ask Harriette, whether it shall be a claret 
or a brown, and decide according to her response, as I hope she 
will sometimes do my new chaise the honor to take a drive 
in it. 

I hear that Mr. White and daughters left Baltimore yesterday 
morning. Of course, Mr. A. and Mrs. White did not reach 
them there ; they will, doubtless, overtake them this night, at 
Philadelphia. I am happy to say that my letters this morning, 
dated Sunday morning, represent Mrs. Jones as a good deal 
better. Yours truly, 

D. WEBSTER.

CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Richmond, June 6, 1832. 

MY DEAR SIR,- I thank you very sincerely for the copy with 
which you have favored me of your speeches on the bill for renewing the charter of the Bank of the United States. I need 
not say that I consider an accommodation of the tariff question 
itself as scarcely more interesting to our country than the passage of that bill. Your argument presents the subject in its 

strongest point of view, and to me seems unanswerable. Mr. 
Ritchie, in his Inquirer, informs the people of Virginia that Mr. 
Tazewell has refuted you completely. This he may have done 
in the opinion of Mr. Ritchie. I have not seen Mr. Taze well's 
speech, and do not understand from The Inquirer whether his 
refutation applies to your speech in favor of the bill or to that 
against the amendment offered by Mr. Moor. By the way, 
your argument against that amendment is founded in an idea 
which to me is quite novel. I had often heard it advanced that 
the States have no constitutional power to establish banks of 
circulation, but never that Congress might not introduce into the 
charter a restraining principle, which might prohibit branches 
altogether, or require the assent of a State to their introduction, 
or a principle which might subject them to State taxation. This 
may be considered not as granting power of taxation to a State, 
for a State possesses that power ; but as withdrawing a bar 
which the constitution opposes to the exercise of this power 
over a franchise created by Congress for national purposes, unless the constitution of the franchise in its creation has this 
quality engrafted on it. I however am far from undertaking to 
dissent from your proposition ; I only say it is new, and I ponder on it. 

With great and respectful esteem, I am your obedient 
servant, J. MARSHALL. 

P. S. I only meant to express my obligation for your attention, and I have betrayed myself into the politics of the day.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WHITE. 

Washington, June 28, 1832. 

MY DEAR SIR, The tariff bill was engrossed yesterday, in the 
House of Representatives, and will probably pass to-day. It 
contains many good and some bad things, and was carried in 
the House by a strangely mixed vote. Many gentlemen south 
of the Potomac River voted for it, as did Mr. Adams, and 
Mr. Appleton, and others. John Davis, Mr, Choate, and others, 
voted against it. Its great objection is, that it leaves the broadcloths unprotected. In this respect we shaU try to mend it; 
and I have hopes of success. One thing seems certain ; if the 
bill passes, nullification is at an end. There are too many 
southern votes for it, to admit the idea of its being nullified by 
southern votes. If we can make the bill what it ought to be, in 
regard to woollen cloths, it will do much good. Some other 
things must be attended to. Say to Mr. I. P. Davis, that I do 
not draw back from attention to drawbacks ; and that I am 
bound by strong cords to the interest of cordage. Lead goes 
very heavily, in the present bill ; but my ever vigilant colleague 
will look out for Salem, and all its interests urban and suburban. In some other particulars we shall try our hand at 
amendments. Let us hope for the best and be prepared for the 

worst.

I suppose my wife is this day in Boston ; I pray you take 
good care of her. Give my love to Mr. and Mrs. Paige, and 
show him this letter ; and give my love also to the damsels. 

Yours ever and a day, 

D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WHITE. 

Marshfield, Sunday, August 2, 1832. 

MY DEAR SIR, I did not write you, as I promised, on Friday, because, so soon as it ceased raining in the morning, there 
were certain flocks seen on the meadows, whose visits it was 
necessary to regard, and Mr. Blake came that evening, and took 
the field yesterday, so that I was occupied with him. We embarked in Mr. Hatch's boat, at the boat-house, head of South 
River, and went down to the mouth thereof, through the 
marshes, and returned the same way. We found some birds, 
though the meadows are not sufficiently mown to make them 
constantly plenty. Immediately after the rain, they were in 
great numbers, all round us. I have not followed the seas at 
all, since I saw you last. I reserve the pleasure of renewing 
that sort of life till you come again, and until The Calypso J 

l A yacht presented to Mr. Webster by Mr. White. 

makes her appearance on this coast. Meantime, Peterson takes 
care that we do not suffer for the want of a fish or two. 

I have occasion to be in Boston on Wednesday, for a few 
hours; and now intend to send Peterson up, by one of the 
packets, on Tuesday, or else to get him along by the Hingham 
steamboat, on Wednesday morning, so as to be in Boston as 
soon as I am, say, Wednesday, twelve o'clock. If he has a fair 
chance to go by the packet, I shall let him take some man or 
boy with him, so as to have a full crew. If he goes in the other 
mode, he must ship a hand in Boston, unless you should fee] 
inclined to take the helm yourself. Nothing happening, I hope 
to see you in Boston Wednesday, twelve o'clock; and bring 
you down with me on Thursday, unless you choose to come in 
the boat. From Thursday the 16th, to Monday the 28th, I 
wish you to be with us here, as much as you can ; and on the 
last-mentioned day, viz : Monday, the 28th, we must go with 
our two boys to Chatham direct, and create a sensation among 
the curlews. I will stay with you at Cherry Hill, one week 
after our return from Chatham, at any time in September or 
October, as may be most convenient. I should like to hit on 
nearly the same period as last year, well recollecting how pleasant and agreeable every thing then looked. We will try to kill, 
not another horse, but another teal.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WHITE. 

Boston, Sunday, twelve o'clock, at Mr. Paige's, 1832. 
MY DEAR SIR, I arrived here Friday noon, and was exceedingly sorry to find you had left, and more especially for the 
cause thereof. Yesterday, I despatched my little concern in 
court, and Mr. Paige and I had made arrangements to set forth 
this morning for Cherry Hill, when, lo ! at five o'clock Mrs. 
Paige and little " h," and the two Carolines drove up. All this 
made it quite impossible to move Mr. Paige towards Cherry 
Hill, or in any other direction leading from the two " H's " 
to-day. 

44* 
I saw your letter to him ; you do quite right to keep still and 
quiet for some days, when I doubt not you will be well again. 
I shall not leave Boston till to-morrow, which will give me opportunity to see all attended to which you suggested touching 
the boat; your notions are all right and good. Commodore 
Morris and Mr. I. P. Davis insist that safety chests shall be 
placed under the thwarts, which the Commodore says will make 
it certain, in all cases, that if accident happen, the boat will still 
float. I know not much about the matter, but shall inquire tomorrow morning. Ought not a small axe to be put in a proper 
place, to cut a mast, in case of need, or carry on a quarrel with 
a shark, &c. ? Notwithstanding that I shall give all needful 
directions to-morrow morning, I shall not let the ship be stirred 
till you see her, and pronounce all to be right. Commodore 
Peterson is very impatient to have his broad pennant flying at 
her mast's head. He says that her sails must of course have 
reefs, therefore he wishes not an inch of her masts to be 
taken off. 

I hope, my dear Sir, you will be able to be in town in three 
or four days, and to take Mr. Paige over the waves to Green 
Harbor. Your arrival shall be duly honored. 

I notice that the Nah'ant sales are absolutely fixed for Wednesday. As you said something of a partly-formed intention 
of buying one of the cottages, I take the liberty, which I hope 
you will excuse, of suggesting whether you might not safely 
postpone the execution of that intention. 

I give the following reasons : 1. These cottages, or some of 
them, will be in the market, no doubt, and may be purchased 
whenever you please hereafter. 2. I want you to take a look 
at the south shore, from Quincy to Cohasset, inclusive. Come 
up by way of Hingham, and across the harbor in a boat, and 
look a little at certain localities which I wish you to see, before 
you fix on a spot for a marine villa. 

Let me hear from you, my dear Sir, as soon as you are able ; 
and remember that no fish will have the honor of being brought 
on board The Calypso, till you throw a line over her bulwarks. 

Yours most faithfully always, 

DAN'L WEBSTER. 

P. S. I forgot to say that I expect to be in Boston about 
Wednesday, the 15th, to stay one night. If I should not see 
you before that time, I shall hope to meet you there, then. 
There are some matters of business which will call me up at 
that time, and though I shall not probably stay long, yet I hope 
to be able to find time to see you and other friends, as may be 
convenient.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WHITE. 

Green Harbor, August 17, half-past twelve, 1832. 

MY DEAR SIR, I arrived at sunset yesterday, and found all 
well. Mr. Paige had been busily engaged all day, either shooting or driving out with the ladies. Mrs. Paige seems quite 
well ; and as for the amiable and interesting Miss Paige, she is 
as gay as a lark and as fat as a plover. 

The Calypso anchored in the inner roads last evening, before 
dark, out about seven or eight hours from Boston, and for some 
time becalmed off the cliffs ; all well ; spoke nothing. The 
Commodore speaks of her in the highest manner, as a sea boat. 
In her build and equipment he holds her unsurpassed. She will 
proceed on no cruise for halibut, cod, or haddock, until you shall 
be on board. 

We look for you, of course, on Monday, rain or shine. I 
saw Mr. Blake after leaving you. He seemed disposed to return > 
and commissioned me to inquire him out some rooms. I think 
he can be accommodated at Captain Hewitt's, which you know 
is close by. I shall write him this post. You will, of course, 
arrange that Joseph shall rendezvous here by the end of next 
week, so as to be ready for a punctual departure for Chatham 
on Monday the 27th, at five A. M. 

The shooting is fine this morning. Mr. Paige shot a dozen 
birds in the Captain's pond. I have made the number twenty 
without going far beyond the barn. He is now at Peterson's, 
and will be home to dine with a dozen more. 

On reflection, I think Joseph ought to come down here, so as 
to have two or three days' shooting next week ; I understand 
that the state of the tides and of the mowing on the meadows, 
will render that period auspicious. The shooting here is now 
good ; the true way is, to hasten down, enjoy it, but not to proclaim it ; don't speak too goldenly of it to Mr. Blake ; it is not 
necessary to bring half the town into the Old Colony, by inflamed 
account of sports. Remember that this hint is not for yourself, 
for you have no tongue, except when tongues would be serviceable. 

Give my love to the damsels. 

Yours truly ever, 

D. WEBSTER.

undergo Marshfield for a week, we shall be glad to see them.

MY DEAR SIR, We only reached Quincy last night, nor did 
we accomplish that without a ducking. Nevertheless, we arrived here quite well, and without colds, at ten, A. M. 



1 A letter from Mrs. Webster, inviting Mr. White's two daughters to visit 
Green Harbor, with their father and brother Joseph, and to remain there during the contemplated visit to Chatham. 

We have had a laugh at dinner, though we had to force it a 
little. We have found out that although we fobbed you off 
with some thin claret on Sunday, we were really rich, in various 
good wines, with which your kindness had supplied us. To 
prevent or alleviate extreme mortification, we have affected to 
make a joke of it, and tried hard to laugh. The truth is, I 
found a bottle of brandy, and two bottles of Sherry, in the 
cooler, neither seeing any more nor hearing of any more ; and 
then, Mr. Paige having spoken of only a bottle or two, I thought 
I had seen all ; and Henry, who knew all, being absent on Sunday, I was left to remain in my error. I pray you, in accepting 
thanks for your kindness, to accept also an apology for such a 
blunder. I assure you, it is not often that good wine is under 
any roof where I am without my knowing it. 

Notwithstanding the copious shower which fell in Boston and 
its immediate vicinity, there was not a drop of rain here yesterday ; nor hardly any as far on the road as Weymouth. 

After I saw you, I was forced to agree to go to Boston, to 
argue a cause in the supreme court, for Messrs. Peters and Pond. 
I suppose it will be heard on Saturday next, though the time is 
not positively fixed. I pray you give my love to Mrs. Paige 
and the damsels, including Miss Paige. All have sent you the 
kindest remembrance. I am going over this p. M. to see Commodore Peterson. 

Yours ever, truly and faithfully,

Green Harbor, September 14, Friday evening, 1832. 
MY DEAR SIR, Mrs. Webster's health improves rapidly. She 
has had a drive to-day, and if she continues to improve and the 
weather should be fine, we shall set off for Cherry Hill Monday 
morning. We may probably cut Boston altogether, and dine 
at the Norfolk House, or elsewhere, and bring up at Cherry Hill at 
night. If we judge the day's drive too long, we shall of course 
stop by the way. From us to you, round Boston, is fiftyfive miles, or thereabout, a pretty long drive for a convalescent 
lady. 
As 1 was sitting down to dinner yesterday, I was told that 
five teal had sat down in the water just below the dike. I went 
out and shot three of them, and brought them in before the 
beefsteak had cooled. This afternoon I strayed down to the 
rock with Henry, just to look. We saw several small pods of 
coots go by ; one of them came so near that I brought down 
one of the number composing it, with bird shot. But it fell in 
the sea, and we had no boat, and so we lost it. 

Just at dusk this evening, a woodcock undertook to fly over 
our premises, but not steering well run afoul of the pig-pen 
fence and almost killed himself. He got off with difficulty. If 
he be a bird of any spirit, he must be mortified at the laugh 
which the bystanding unfeathered bipeds raised at this clumsy 
specimen of aerial navigation. 

I believe I have now told you all the Marshfield incidents. 
To-morrow, if the weather should be fine, I intend to wet a line 
in the salt seas. 

Mrs. Webster desires her best love to you and the girls. 
I am, dear Sir, as always yours,

MR. WEBSTER TO CHANCELLOR KENT. 

Boston, October 29, 1832
MY DEAR SIR, Mr. Calhoun, as you are doubtless aware, has 
published a labored defence of nullification, in the form of a letter, 
to Governor Hamilton. It is far the ablest and most plausible, 
and therefore the most dangerous vindication of that particular 
form of revolution, which has yet appeared. 

In the silence of abler pens, and seeing as I think I do, that 
the affairs of this government are rapidly approaching a crisis, 
I have felt it to be my duty to answer Mr. Calhoun, and, as he 
adopted the form of a letter, in which to put forth his opinions, 
I think of giving my answer a similar form. The object of this 
is, to ask your permission to address my letter to you. I propose to feign that I have received a letter from you calling rny 
attention to Mr. Calhoun's publication ; and then, in answer to 
such supposed letter, to proceed to review his whole argument 
at some length, not in the style of a speech, but in that of cool, 
constitutional, and legal discussion. If you feel no repugnance 
to be thus written to, I will be obliged to you for your assent ; 
on the other hand if any reasons suggest themselves to your 
mind against such a form of publication, another can be readily 
adopted. I cannot complete the paper before the election, as I 
am at present a good deal pressed with professional affairs, but 
I hope to bring it into light in the course of the next month. 

I have little to say to you, my dear Sir, upon political sub
ects. The whole ground is open to you. I trust you will be 

one of those who will have votes to give, and devoutly pray 

you may yet see some way of so uniting the well-disposed, as 

to rescue us from our peril. 

I am, dear Sir, with most sincere and true regard, yours, 

DANIEL WEBSTER.

CHANCELLOR KENT TO MR. WEBSTER. 

New York, October 31, 1832. 

DEAR SIR, I have no objection that you should address in 
the form of a letter or letters to me your remarks on the VicePresident's scheme of nullification, and that you should assume 
it to be in answer to a letter from me relative to that subject. I 
shall deem it an honor to be addressed by you while engaged in the 
investigation of such an interesting subject. The Vice-President 
enclosed one of his pamphlets to me, and I read it attentively. 
It is ingeniously written ; but such a construction of the constitution, and such principles as he deduces, are visionary and 
most unsound and sophistical. His repugnance to all solid constitutional principles would fix a deadly power of destruction in 
the very vitals of the government. 

The crisis is indeed portentous and frightful. We are threatened with destruction all around us, and we seem to be fast 
losing our original good sense and virtue. The Democracy of 
this city require all their candidates to Congress to give another 
pledge to support all the measures of the administration. Can 
any thing be more degrading and monstrous ? Is the proud 
House of Representatives and the grand inquest of the nation to 
be composed of such materials ? 
If we succeed in our election, I shall take the liberty of writing you again, and ask for a free communication of sentiments. 
If we fail, then indeed we may hang our harps upon the willows or on the witch hazel that shades Saint Fillan's Spring ! 

Your speech at Worcester was admirable for its logic as well 
as for its fervor and its force. If we are to be saved we shall 
be largely indebted to you, &i Pergama^ &fc.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WILLIAM SULLIVAN. 

Washington, January 3, 1833. 

MY DEAR SIR, I am glad to receive your letter. We are 
surrounded with difficulties here, of various sorts ; and it is not 
a little uncertain how we shall get out of them. At the present 
moment, it would seem that public opinion, and the stern rebuke 
by the executive government, had, in a great measure, suppressed 
the immediate danger of nullification. As far as we see the 
results of the legislation of South Carolina, her laws limp far 
behind her ordinance. For aught that appears, nothing will 
interrupt the ordinary collection of duties, after February 1, 
unless some individual chooses to try the nullifying remedy. If 
any importer should suffer a seizure to be made, and should endeavor to replevy, under the State process, the collector would 
probably not deliver up the goods to the sheriff; nor suffer his 
own goods to be taken in withernam. This, probably, would 
bring on a trial of strength. 

But our more imminent danger in my opinion is, that, seizing 
on the occasion, the anti-tariff party will prostrate the whole 
tariff system. You will have seen the bill, reported by Mr. 
Verplanck. Great and extraordinary efforts are put forth, to 
push that bill rapidly through Congress. It is likely to be finally 
acted upon, at least in the House of Representatives, before the 
country can be made to look on it, in its true character. On 
the other hand, our friends will resist it, of course, and hold on 
to the last A vigorous opposition will at least, it may be 

hoped, be made, and, as I believe, produce the necessity, on the 
part of the supporters of the measure, to make some beneficial 
amendments in it, before even it can get through the House of 
Representatives. 

Under these circumstances, it seems to me it would be 
extremely useful that the legislature of Massachusetts should 
express its temperate but firm opinion, first, against the doctrine 
of nullification ; secondly, on the violation of the public faith, 
which would be perpetrated by this thorough and sudden prostration of the protective system. 

On this ground of vested interest, we can make, if well sustained at home, the most efficient stand against the threatened 
ruin. We mean to occupy this ground, and to make the most 
of it. 

If the bill were now in the Senate, it would not pass ; but 
how far individuals may be brought over by party discipline, in 
the drill of a month, it is impossible to say. 

I do not believe the President himself wishes the bill to pass. 
E contra, I fancy he would prefer the undivided honor of suppressing nullification, now, and to take his own time, hereafter, 
to remodel the tariff. But the party push on, fearing the effect 
of the doctrines of the proclamation, and endeavoring to interpose, and to save Carolina, not by the proclamation, but by 
taking away the ground of complaint. 

But against this, again, there is some degree of under current; because there are some who think that, surrendering 
the tariff to the menaces of nullification, would be voting a 
triumph to Mr. Calhoun, at the expense of Mr. Van Buren's 
expectations, &c. 

I shall be glad to hear from you, and other friends ; especially 
if you can give me any good advice. 

Yours, ever truly, 

DANIEL WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE LIVERMORE. 

Washington, January 5, 1833. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of December 29 is received, and 
has given me pleasure. I regard you, my dear Sir, not only as 
an acquaintance of many years' standing, but also as one whose 
countenance and kindness were important to me in youth. I 
shall be sure to send you any thing which I may think you 
would like to receive, and I beg of you not to take the trouble 
to acknowledge receipts. It will be quite enough that I understand generally that such communications are welcome. 

The impression here to-day, seems to be that nullification 
has assumed a less threatening aspect. At least the danger of 
immediate collision appears less. The act, passed by the legislature of South Carolina, to carry the ordinance into effect, does 
not come up to the ordinance. It may happen that, notwithstanding the ordinance and the act, things may go on much as 
they have done. 

Nothing is more uncertain than the fate of the new tariff bill. 
It will pass the House, if the President desires it ; but that is 
doubtful. If it were now in the Senate, it would be postponed 
from an indisposition to act again on that subject so soon ; but 
I do not know what will be done with it, should it come to us 
a month hence. 

It is sometimes said that, in so changing a world, if people 
will but stand still, others sooner or later will come to them. 
Were you not struck with this truth, in seeing the proclamation ? 
I am, dear Sir, with constant regard, 

Yours,

WE have little news, politically. In a day or two, the President is to send us a communication about nullification. It will 

probably bring on some debates. The House of Representatives 
seems to be pressing on the new tariff bill ; but still there are 
suspicions that the bill will not get through that House, and this 
impression now daily gains strength. Look at Mr. Krebb's resolutions, in Pennsylvania. I hope Massachusetts will do something in the same way. Yours truly,

MY DEAR FATHER, I received your beautiful present a few 
days since, and was very much pleased with it. I think it contains some very fine faces, and I like the stories much better 
than those usually found in " Souvenirs," or " Annuals.' Your 
letter preceded it a few days, and I beg you, my dearest Father, 
to accept your little daughter's best thanks for them both. 

I am staying with cousin Eliza, and am passing my time 
most pleasantly. I find it very convenient as regards my school, 
as I am never late now, which used sometimes to be the case. 
I have not commenced any new study since I last wrote you. 
I think I should like to study Italian very much, as I have not 
much to do. 

I hope we shall soon see you in Boston, as Congress has risen, 
and we are very anxious to see you at home once more. Although spring has in reality begun, you would not imagine it to 
be so by the weather, which is intensely cold; the ground is 
covered with snow, and the thermometer last night was eleven 
degrees below zero. Fletcher dined with us yesterday, it being 
Saturday. I suppose you have heard he is to have a part at the 
next exhibition. Dr. and Mrs. Kirkland dined here to-day ; the 
latter had, as usual, a good deal to say. I saw Edward yesterday, he was very well. 

I went on Wednesday with cousin Eliza to hear a lecture on 
hieroglyphics, delivered by Mr. J. Pickering. It was very interesting, but he did not tell us as much upon the principal subject 
as I should have liked to have heard. A considerable part of 
it, was upon the necessity of attention, which he addressed 
principally to his younger hearers. 

I heard two very good sermons to-day from Mr. Greenwood, 
one of which I shall make an abstract of, for my composition. 
It was upon the resignation of the Shunamitish woman, when 
she lost her only son. Cousin Eliza says she wishes you would 
come home, for she thinks if you were to, we should not think 
any more of the snow or the cold, for it would make sunshine 
in Boston. She also unites with me in a great deal of love tj 
you, and believe me ever, dear father,

mother's absence, I have felt quite easy about you, since I 
learned you were to spend your time at cousin Eliza's. Everybody is happy where she is. 

I am quite glad to hear that Fletcher has a part at exhibition. 
You do not mention the time ; I fear it will be before I get 
home. 

We have the same cold weather here, at least in some degree, 
of which you speak. The last ten days have been the severest 
part of the winter. Some signs of relenting begin now to appear. 

I heard yesterday from your mother in New York. I have 
written her, preferring that she should meet me in Philadelphia, 
as I shall be obliged to stay there on business, for a day or 
two. 

The court will rise about the fifteenth, and by the end of next 
week, say by the sixteenth, I hope to take leave of Washington. 

I must pray you to remember me most kindly to Mr. and 
Mrs. Lee. Give my love also to Edward, and to uncle Paige, 
and aunt Harriette, not forgetting the amiable Miss Paige. 
Adieu ! my dear daughter, 

Ever your most affectionate father, 

DANIEL WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. TICKNOR. 

Washington, April 8, 1833. 

MY DEAR SIR, * I have 

read Tom Moore's first volume of Byron's Life. Whatever human imagination shall hereafter picture of a human being, I shall 
believe it all within the bounds of credibility. Byron's case shows 
that fact sometimes runs by all fancy, as a steamboat passes a 
scow at anchor. I have tried hard to find something in him to 
like, besides his genius and his wit ; but there was no other likeable quality about him. He was an incarnation of demonism. 
He is the only man in English history, for a hundred years, that 
has boasted of infidelity and of every practical vice, not included 
in what maybe termed, what his biographer does term, meanness. 
Lord Bolingbroke, in his most extravagant youthful sallies, and 
the wicked Lord Littleton, were saints to him. All Moore can 
say is, that each of his vices had some virtue or some prudence 
near it, which in some sort checked it. Well, if that were not so 
in all, who could 'scape hanging ? The biographer, indeed, says 
his moral conduct must not be judged of by the ordinary standard! And that is true, if a favorable decision is looked for. 
Many excellent reasons are given for his being a bad husband ; 
the sum of which is, that he was a very bad man. I confess I 
was rejoiced then, and am rejoiced now, that he was driven out 
of England by public scorn ; because his vices were not in his 
passions, but in his principles. He denied all religion and all 
virtue from the house-top. Dr. Johnson says, there is merit in 
maintaining good principles, though the preacher is seduced into 
violations of them. This is true. Good theory is something. 
But a theory of living, and of dying too, made up of the elements of hatred to religion, contempt of morals, and defiance of 
the opinion of all the decent part of the public, when before has 
a man of letters avowed it ? If Milton were alive to recast cer45* 
tain prominent characters in' his great Epic, he could embellish 
them with new traits, without violating probability. Walter 
Scott's letter toward the end of the book, is much too charitable. 
I find in one of Lord Byron's letters a suggestion, that part, 
or the whole of Robinson Crusoe was written while in prison, 
by the first Lord Orford, (Robert Harley,) and by him given to 
Defoe. Is there any such suggestion anywhere else ? I do not 
believe it, Defoe's (his true name was Foe) other works show 
he could write Robinson Crusoe. Harley has left no proof of 
his capacity for such a work. While on the subject of books, 
whither I have strayed, I know not how, allow me to say there 
is one I want to see. It is Johnson's Shakespeare. I covet a 
sight of that book, just as Sam. Johnson left it. His first edition 
was about 1765 or 1766. Did he publish a second ? You are 
not only a man for books in general, but for Shakespeare in 
particular, and can tell me. If you have the book, I shall get a 
reading of it ; if you have it not, I wish you would order it on 
my account, the next time you write Mr. Rich. I suppose the 

first edition was folio, but know not. 

##***** 

I shall make no more speeches. What I have done, even, 
was not with malice prepense. Make our best regards to Mrs. 
Tick nor, and believe me always truly, 

Yours, D. WEBSTER.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. PERRY. 

Boston, April 10, 1833. 

MY DEAR SIR, I was gratified by the receipt of your letter of 
the 1st of this month, and thank you for the favorable and friendly 
aentiments which you express in regard to an effort of mine, at the 
late session of Congress, in a cause which I deemed all-important to the country, and to which I had already learned you were 
us much devoted as myself. I am not at all surprised, my dear 
Sir. at the opinions you express, as to the ultimate object of those 
who have raised the flag of nullification. Circumstances, full of 
meaning, attracted my attention to it early ; and in December, 
1828, 1 became thoroughly convinced that the plan of a southern 
confederacy had been received with favor, by a great many of 
the political men of the South, especially of your State. 

I agree with you also entirely in the opinion that the danger 
is not over. A systematic and bold attack, now but just begun, 
will be carried on, I apprehend, against the just and constitutional powers of the government, and against whatsoever 
strengthens the Union of the States. 

For my own part I look forward to an animated controversy 
on these points, for years to come ; and if we can sustain our 
side of the controversy, my dear Sir, with success, as I hope and 
believe we may, we shall transmit to posterity an inheritance 
above all price. 

I do not apprehend any further difficulty with Georgia. 
There was not the slightest reference to the Georgia case, in 
my mind, or ever, as far as I know, in that of any other gentleman, in preparing and passing the bill for the better collection 
of the revenue. It is true that some of the provisions of the 
bill ought, in my judgment, to be permanent. If they iiad 
previously existed, the idea of putting the doctrines of nullification in practice, in the mode recently adopted at least, would 
probably not have been entertained. I have expected what I 
see now publicly announced, that the effort will be to repeal 
this law, so soon as Congress shall assemble. 

It is probably expected that since the occasion has passed by 
many will be willing to repeal the law, although they were in 
favor of its passage at the time ; and it is hoped that, by the 
repeal of this act, it may be considered as decided, that Congress 
is hereafter to take no step to execute any laws which are 
resisted by State authority. 

The high regard I feel for the patriotic gentlemen with whom 
you act in your own State, and the respect which I have been 
led to entertain for yourself, induces me, my dear Sir, to express 
a wish to hear from you, on the interesting subjects which at 
present occupy the public attention, whenever your convenience 
may allow. 

With friendly salutations, I remain your obedient servant, 

DAN'L WEBSTER.

MR. CASS TO MR. WEBSTER. 

Washington, April 17, 1833. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just received your kind letter, and 
sincerely thank you for your recollection of me. I think the 
President will visit New England this season ; if he does, he 
will leave here about the first of May, and he is desirous that I 
should accompany him. I shall accordingly do so; and I 
presume we shall be in Boston not far from the 20th of June. 
I cannot ask you to postpone your intended journey till after 
this time, as it might expose you to much inconvenience. Still, 
I will confess to you, that the hope of meeting you and of revisiting with you the scenes and friends of our youth, has dwelt 
upon my mind, since we first conversed together on the subject. 
Nothing could give me greater pleasure than such an occasion ; 
and if more pressing engagements should require your absence, 
at the time I have mentioned, I shall still look forward at a 
future day to realize this hope. 

With sincere regard, I am, my dear Sir, truly your friend, 

LEWIS CASS.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. CASS. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letter of the 17th instant. 
A journey to the West has long been in contemplation by me, 
but I have not yet been able to accomplish it. Every other 
year the session of Congress has been so far protracted as to forbid the undertaking for that season, and professional duties have 
allowed me no leisure, hitherto, in the intervening years. In 
addition to these causes, the political state of things has, for 
some time been such, that the motive and objects of such a tour 
would have been very likely to be misinterpreted and misunderstood. 

In this last respect, the present moment seems favorable ; and as 
I have found myself able to make the necessary arrangements 
with my professional engagements, I have thought it not well 
to defer, longer, the execution of that which has been already a 
good while postponed. 

Nevertheless, I am very unwilling to miss your visit to New 
England ; and although I might even make that sacrifice in the 
hope that you would, as you suggest, hereafter repeat your visit, 
I still feel great reluctance in being from home, when the President comes to Massachusetts. In the first place, it would give 
me pleasure to see him, and to extend to him and his party the 
hospitalities of my house, as well as to unite with my friends 
and neighbors in such manifestations of respect as are due to 
him. And in the next place, my absence on such an occasion, 
when it was known that a visit from him to this part of the 
country was intended, may be liable to much misconstruction. 

I am inclined, therefore, at all events, to be at home by the 
time the President reaches Boston. My plan has been to return 
by the first of July, if I shall not be able to accomplish all I intend, and return earlier than that day. But under present circumstances, I shall abridge the extent of my travels, so as to be 
able to return to Boston by the 20th of June. 

D. W.

MR. WEBSTER TO MR. WILLIAM SULLIVAN. 

Friday, April 19, 1833. 

MY DEAR SIR, I must thank you for your kind and friendly 
note of the 15th. I have passed an arduous winter, but am 
richly repaid for all my labors, if those, whose esteem I value, 
think I have done any thing for the good of the country. All 
things have not happened as I could wish ; but on the whole, I 
think the events of the winter have tended to strengthen the 
union of the States, and to uphold the government. But it has 
many and powerful enemies, not easily subdued, and never to 
be reconciled. 

Your prophecies, or hopes, for certain future events, are a 
good deal influenced, I suspect, by your private friendship. I do 
not indulge in any expectations ; nevertheless, I thank you for 
all your favorable sentiments and kind wishes. We must one 
day, a warm one, take a walk round the Common, and talk 
over matters. 

Yours, always truly, 

DAN'L WEBSTER.

DANIEL WEBSTER TO FLETCHER WEBSTER. 

Steubenville, July 1, 1833. 

MY DEAR SON, I am at last arrived at the borders of Ohio, 
though, it is true, at a very late period. I have found it absolutely impossible to get on further, without giving offence. I 
cross the river this morning, go down to Wheeling, stay there a 
part of to-morrow, and then go East. My purpose is to get to 
New York as soon as possible. If it be within the reach of 
possibility, I will be home before July 15, so as to hear your 
oration. At present there is no doubt of it, provided I find 
your mother at New York. 

I pray you, spare no pains in regard to that effort. Consider how much depends on it, and how much you owe to 
those who elected you. Make it long ; you will be likely to 
err on the other extreme. Do not omit a few flowers and flourishes ; they become young orators. Let not your taste be too 
severe. Above all things, be sure to have it perfectly committed, and rehearse and practise it till you feel that you can 
deliver it perfectly well. 

My health is entirely good, but I long to get home. Give 
my love to Uncle's and Mr. A's family. It is a long time since 
I heard from Boston, or from mother and Julia. 

Your affectionate father, 

D. WEBSTER.
