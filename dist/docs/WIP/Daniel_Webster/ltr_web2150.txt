</p><p>
My dear Sir, - We are all with the foot in the stirrup, and are 
not leaving in a very composed state. The passage of the Indian bill, and the rejection of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=maysville" rel="city">maysville</a> Turnpike bill, have occasioned unusual excitement. The quarrel, yesterday, between Stansbury and others who voted for the bill, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jkp" rel="colleague">Polk</a>, Bell, etc., was -very warm. There is more ill blood raised, I 
should think, than would easily be quieted again. 
</p><p>
We think all recent occurrences have been quite favorable, 
and that the present prospect is cheering. We have had no formal 
meeting. After much consideration, that idea was given up. 
We found it difficult to assemble a few friends without giving 
offense ; or a great number without the danger of attracting too 
much notice. We have had, however, a very full and free interchange of opinions, for the last three weeks, and are all harmonious in purpose and design, and in good spirits. We incline 
to think no formal nominations at present advisable, though 
friends press us to such a measure from divers quarters of the 
country. It has seemed to us, on the whole, that a formal 
nomination would not be popular enough in its character and 
origin, to do good. It would be immediately proclaimed to be 
the act of your friends acting at your instance. It would excite 
jealousies on the one hand, which are now fast dying away, and 
on the other, check discontents and schisms among our opponents, from which much is now to be hoped. Such is our 
view. 
</p><p>
I am much pressed to assent to a nomination of you by the 
Massachusetts Legislature now in session. Bat to this I steadily 
object, on the ground that every body knows we are perfectly 
safe and strong in Massachusetts, and a nomination there would 
only raise the cry of coalition revived. It has seemed to me the 
proper scene for the first formal action is Maryland. Her Legislature is elected in October. Our friends have the utmost confidence they will carry the State. Indeed there can be little doubt 
of it. In that event, the Maryland Legislature, next December, 
will occupy a position from which they can speak to advantage. 
Without detail, you will see, I think, at once, many advantages 
in a nomination from this quarter. None could be more favorable, unless it be 
, or Pennsylvania, neither of which, I fear, is as likely to be so soon ready for it. 
</p><p>
I hope you will think that, under all circumstances, we have 
done wisely in doing nothing. If you run against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a>, there will be an election by the electors ; and, as you justly state. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> will be chosen, unless either Virginia, 
Pennsylvania, or New York can be detached from him. Of the 
three, I have, at present, most hope of New York, and least of 
Virginia. Late occurrences will strengthen <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> in 
Virginia, and weaken him much in Pennsylvania, and perhaps 
also in New York. I am in hopes that "working men", "antimason", and "anti-auction men," etc., etc., will break down the regency. This we shall know in October. If it should turn 
out so, New York will then open a very fair field. For myself, 
I reckon on recent events as having insured us Maryland, Ohio, 
Kentucky and Indiana. This is one very good breadth. South 
of it I look for nothing but Louisiana, every thing north of it is worth a contest. 
</p><p>
I hope your friends at the West keep a steady regard to Missouri. I am told there is a good chance, or some chance, of Mr. Barton's re-election. This is matter of very great importance. 
Nothing, indeed, is more momentous to the country than the approaching election of Senators to the next Congress. 
</p><p>
On the whole, my dear sir, I think a crisis is arriving, or 
rather has arrived. I think you can not be kept back from the 
contest. The people will bring you out, nolens volens. Let 
them do it. I advise you, as you will be much watched, to stay 
at home ; or, if you wish to travel, visit your old. friends in Virginia. We should all be glad to see you at the North, but not now. You will hear from the North, every town and village in 
it, on the 4th of July. Parties must, now, necessarily, be started 
out anew ; and the great ground of difference will be Tariff and 
Internal Improvements. You are necessarily at the head of one 
party, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="colleague antagonist met">General Jackson</a> will be, if he is not already, identified with the other. The question will be put to the country. Let the country decide it. 
</p><p>
I had intended to say a word about myself, but it would be to 
make a long letter still longer. When I came here it was my 
purpose to follow your example, and to vacate my seat at the end 
of this session. Events have suspended the execution of that 
purpose. How I shall think of it when I get home, I do not know. 
</p><p>
I pray kind remembrance to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=lhc" rel="aquaintance met">Mrs. Clay</a>, and beg to assure you 
of my unaltered regard and attachment.
