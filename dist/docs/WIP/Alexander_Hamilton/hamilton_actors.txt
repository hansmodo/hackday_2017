WILLIAM DUER TO ABRAHAM TEN BROECK. 

Philadelphia, April 17, 1777. 

I am extremely sorry to inform you, that notwithstanding the invasion which threatens this city, a languor prevails amongst the inhabitants of almost all ranks. The 
disputes about their constitution, and a want of vigilance 
and vigour in detecting and defeating the designs of the 
disaffected, have given the malignants a dangerous ascendency. The depreciation of the continental money is astonishingly rapid, and I see, with concern, that no attempts 
are made to check so fatal a measure. You will see by 
the enclosed resolutions of congress of the 14th and 15th 
of April, that they have been under the necessity of supplying an executive authority in this state. 

"By the recess of the Supreme Executive Council, there 
was an absolute interregnum, and if congress had not interposed, this state would have fallen an easy prey to a very 
small body of the enemy's army. Only six hundred and 
eighty-five men at Ticonderoga fit for duty, including one 
hundred and twenty artificers. I have the pleasure to assure the convention, that the state of New- York stands in 
a very high point of light in the eyes of the continent, and 
that General Washington, in his public letters to congress, 
gives the most honourable testimonials in its favour. These, 
sir, are the happy effects of our unanimity and vigour." 

It is also stated, " the disputes in Pennsylvania grew out 
of no want of attachment to the cause, but from disputes 
about the constitution. I wish the establishment of new 
forms of government had been deferred. The union, vigour, and security derived from conventions and committees, 
are not to be found in any state under its new constitution." 

The severe campaign of the preceding year, though one 
of continued successes until the affair of Trenton, had been 
productive of little service to the British cause, excepting 
the capture of New-York ; for the enemy could boast nothing more than the ground which their armies occupied. 
Sir William Howe now judged that the honour of the British arms required some new enterprise worthy of the force 
under his command. 

None seemed more imposing than that of Philadelphia. 
It was regarded as the capital of the country. It was the 
seat of government of Pennsylvania, and the most important 
city of the colonies ; and although, as a military post, its 
possession would yield few advantages, its occupation by an 
enemy would weaken the cause of America in Europe, 
strengthen the hands of the British ministry, and produce, 
he hoped, such a depressing effect on the minds of the Americans, as might predispose them to yield more readily to 
conciliator}' propositions. Having in vain essayed every art 
to bring on a general engagement, and not daring to venture on the bold experiment of crossing the Delaware with 
an enemy in his rear, the English general decided upon a 
new plan of operations. His whole force now exceeded 
forty thousand men ; from these, leaving a sufficient strength 
to protect New- York, he selected eighteen thousand of his 
choicest soldiers, and about the middle of July embarked at 
mboy. During this interval of inactivity, the attention of 
the Americans was principally directed to the operations on 
the northern frontier ; and the advance of one army towards 
Albany, and the embarkation, at the same time, of another 
for an apparently remote expedition, baffled speculation. 
The following letter from Colonel Hamilton, to a friend, 
written at this time, marks the state of opinion.

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 

Albany, December 8th, 1777. 

SIR, 

I shall not attempt to describe what, as a private gentleman, I cannot help feeling, on representing to my mind the 
disagreeable situation in which confidential letters, when 
exposed to public inspection, may place an unsuspecting 
correspondent ; but as a public officer, I conjure your excellency to give me all the assistance you can, in tracing 
out the author of the infidelity which put extracts from 
General Conway's letters to me into your hands. 

Those letters have been stealingly copied, but which of 
them, when, and by whom, is to me yet an unfathomable 
secret. 

There is not one officer in my suite, nor amongst those 
who have free access to me, upon whom I could, with the 
least justification to myself, fix the suspicion, and yet my 
uneasines may deprive me of the usefulness of the worthiest men. It is, I believe, in your excellency's power to 
do me and the United States a very important service by 
detecting a wretch who may betray me, and capitally injure the very operations under your immediate directions. 
For this reason, sir, I beg your excellency will favour me 
with the proof you can procure to that effect. But the crime 
being eventually so important, that the least loss of time 
may be attended with the worst consequences, and it being 
unknown to me whether the letter came to you from a member of congress or an officer, I shall have the honour of 
transmitting a copy of this to the president, that the congress 
may, in concert with your excellency, obtain as soon as possible a discovery which so deeply affects the safety of the 
states. Crimes of that magnitude ought not to remain unpunished. I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your excellency's most humble 

And most obedient servant, 

HORATIO GATES.
 
His Excellency General Washington. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 

SIR, 

The letter of the 4th inst. which I had the honour to receive yesterday from your excellency, has relieved me from 
unspeakable uneasiness. I now anticipate the pleasure it 
will give you when you discover that what has been conveyed to you for an extract of General Conway's letter to 
me, was not an information which friendly motives induced a man of honour to give, that injured virtue might be 
forewarned against secret enemies. The paragraph which 
your excellency has condescended to transcribe is spurious. 
It was certainly fabricated to answer the most selfish and 
wicked purposes. 

I cannot avoid sketching out to your excellency the history of General Conway's letter from the time that it came 
to my hands, by Lieutenant-Colonel Troup, my aid-decamp, to whom General Conway delivered it at Reading, 
on the llth of October, to this time, as far as it has affected 
me, and the officers of my family. 

That letter contained very judicious remarks upon that 
want of discipline which has often alarmed your excellency, and I believe all observing patriots. The reasons 
which, in his judgment, deprived us of the success we would 
reasonably expect, were methodically explained by him ; 
but neither the weakness of any of our generals, nor " bad 
counsellors," were mentioned, and consequently cannot be 
assigned or imagined as part of those reasons to which 
General Conway attributed some of our losses. He wrote 
to me as a candid observer, as other officers in every service write to each other for obtaining better intelligence 
than that of newspapers, and that freedom renders such 
letters thus far confidential in some measure. The judgment of the person who received them points out to him, 
according to time and circumstances, the propriety or impropriety attending their being communicated when no 
particular injunction of secrecy was requested. 

Particular actions, rather than persons, were blamed, 
but with impartiality ; and I am convinced that he did not 
aim at lessening, in my opinion, the merit of any person. 
His letter was perfectly harmless : however, now that various reports have been circulated concerning its contents, 
they ought not to be submitted to the solemn inspection of 
those who stand most high in the public esteem. 

Anxiety and jealousy would arise in the breast of very 
respectable officers, who, rendered sensible of faults which 
inexperience, and that alone may have led them into, 
would be unnecessarily disgusted, if they perceived a probability of such errors being recorded. 

Honour forbids it, and patriotism demands, that I should 
return the letter into the hands of the writer. I will do it, 
but at the same time I declare that the paragraph conveyed 
to your excellency as a genuine part of it, was in words as 
well as in substance, a wicked forgery. 

About the beginning of December I was informed that 
letter had occasioned an explanation between your excellency and that gentleman. Not knowing whether the whole 
letter or part of it had been stealingly copied, but fearing 
malice had altered its original features, I own, sir, that a 
dread of the mischiefs which might attend the forgery I 
suspected would be made, put me for some time in a most 
painful situation. When I communicated to the officers in 
my family the intelligence I had received, they all entreated me to rescue their characters from the suspicions they 
justly conceived themselves liable to until the guilty person 
should be known. To facilitate the discovery, I wrote your 
excellency; but unable to learn whether General Conway's letter had been transmitted to you by a member of 
congress, or a gentleman hi the army, I was afraid much 
time would be lost in the course of the inquiry, and that the 
states might receive some capital injury from the infidelity 
of the person who I thought had stolen a copy of the obnoxious letter, was it not probable that the secrets of the 
army might be attained and betrayed through the same 
means to the enemy ? 

For this reason, sir, not doubting that congress would 
most cheerfully concur with you in tracing out the criminal, I wrote to the president, and enclosed to him a copy of 
my letter to your excellency. 

About the same time I was forwarding these letters, Brigadier General Wilkinson returned to Albany. I informed 
him of the treachery which had been committed, but I concealed from him the measures I was pursuing to unmask 
the author. Wilkinson answered, he was assured it never 
would come to light, and endeavoured to fix my suspicions on Lieutenant-Colonel Troup, who said he might 
have incautiously conversed on the substance of General 
Conway's letter with Colonel Hamilton, whom you had 
sent not long before to Albany. I did not listen to this insinuation against your aid-de-camp and mine. I considered 
it ungenerous ; but the light your excellency has just assisted me with, exhibiting the many qualifications which 
are necessarily blended together by the head and heart of 
General Wilkinson, I would not omit this fact. It would 
enable your excellency to judge whether or not he would 
scruple to make such a forgery as that which he now stands 
charged with, and ought to be exemplarily punished. To 
attempt sowing dissensions among the principal officers of 
the army, and rendering them odious to each other by false 
suggestions and forgeries, is, in my opinion, a crime of the 
first magnitude, and involves with it all the consequences of 
positive treason. That the forgery now in view was machinated for injuring General Conway, and perhaps myself, 
in your judgment, is now evident to me ; and I trust the 
detection will operate, as it ought to operate, upon your excellency, as well as the members of the congress before 
whom your letter necessitates me to lay this answer. The 
station of the calumniator seems to justify your excellency 
for having believed till now that the extract was genuine : 
and yet, sir, I cannot help wishing you had sent me a copy 
of it immediately after your explanation with General 
Conway. 

Would that your excellency's prediction relative to him 
had not been inserted in your letter which came to me unsealed, through the hands of congress. I sincerely wish the 
detection of this forgery may render us all more cautious ; 
and that to procure a fair and dispassionate explanation 
whenever insinuations are made to the prejudice of respected characters, may become an established rule in society, 
as well as in public business throughout the United States. 
I am with unfeigned respect, sir, 

Your excellency's most humble and 
Most obedient servant, 

HORATIO GATES.

LAURENS TO HAMILTON. 

December 18, 1779. 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

On my arrival in town, I was informed by the President, 
that congress had suspended the business of appointing a 
secretary to their minister plenipotentiary at Versailles until my return, in hopes that I might still be prevailed upon 
to accept the office. I replied, that I thought my letter upon 
the subject sufficiently explicit, and assured him of my sincere desire to be excused from serving in that capacity at 
the present juncture of our affairs. 

He urged the unanimity of the choice with respect to me 
the difficulty of uniting the suffrages of all parties, in case 
of a new nomination, and the advantages of this union. Several delegates of congress declared to me the embarrassment of congress since I had declined. One, in particular, 
suggested to me his apprehension of interest being made for 
a late delegate of New- York, who is candidate for the office, 
and to whom the world in general allows greater credit for 
his abilities than his integrity ; and said, " he was determined to oppose him with all his influence." When I quitted 
town the sixteenth, these matters crowded into my mind. 
I fell into a train of serious reflections and self-examination, 
endeavoured to investigate whether I had acted consonantly to the xaXov xai ayadov, and fulfilled the duties of a 
good citizen in the transaction. In fine, I agitated the grand 
question, whether a citizen has a right to decline any' office 
to which his countrymen appoint him ; upon what that 
right is founded, and whether it existed in my case. 

After undergoing the severest conflict I ever experienced, sometimes reproaching, sometimes justifying myself, 
pursuing my journey, or turning retrograde, as the arguments on the one side or the other appeared to prevail, I 
determined that I had been deficient in the duties of a good 
citizen. I returned to Philadelphia, communicated my sentiments to the President and two other members ; declared 
to them that I thought it incumbent on me, in the first place, 
to recommend a person equally qualified in point of integrity, and much better in point of ability. That if, unhappily, they could not agree on Colonel Hamilton, and that I 
was absolutely necessary to exclude a dangerous person, or 
to prevent pernicious delays, I should think it my duty to 
obey the orders of congress. The persons now in nomination, are, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Lovell, Mr. G. Morris, 
Major Stewart. Great stress is laid upon the ability and 
integrity of the person to be employed in this commission. 
I have given my testimony of you in this and the other 
equally essential points. 

My love, as usual. Adieu. 

JOHN LAURENS.

HARRISON TO HAMILTON. 

October 27, 1780. 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

We are only leaving Philadelphia. The most flattering 
attentions have been paid to Meade and myself, and such 
as would not permit us to progress before, unless we had 
shown ourselves entirely disregardless of the great world ; 
besides, motives of a public nature concurred to make us 
stay thus long. From all I have seen and heard, there is a 
good disposition in congress to do all they can for the army 
and the public interest, and there are many very sensible 
men among them. In general, they are most warmly attached to the General, and his recommendations will have 
their weight, while the same spirit prevails. It is said, there 
has been infinitely more harmony among them for some time 
past, than has appeared since the first years of their appointment. I am not, however, without some apprehension, that 
if they proceed in the case of Lee, &c. the MONSTER (PARTY,) 
may show itself again, and that we may have a second 
edition of the measures adopted in the instance of Deane. 
Our friends Sullivan and Carroll have been of great service; 
and gentlemen who are, or pretend to be, in the secrets of the 
cabinet, say they have contributed immeasurably, by their 
independent conduct, to destroy the EASTERN ALLIANCE. 
Bland is very clever, and without question wishes to push on 
in the true and right road. Grayson says this is the best 
congress we have had since the first. Our dear Laurens 
respects many of the members ; and General Greene's appointment, I believe, is entirely consonant to the wishes of 
congress in general, though we have heard there were members much disposed, if facts had not been so obstinate, to 
excuse General Gates. The former is here, and I suppose 
will set out in a day or two ; Meade and I will serve him 
all we can. We have done what we could already. Apropos, you delivered him my letter. Our finances are entirely 
deranged, and there is little or no money in the treasury. 
1 believe they are a subject of much consideration and puzzlement ; the supplies of the army are also matters of present attention, but I don't know what will be done. I hope 
we shall, by Christmas, have some clothing from the West 
Indies, if the moth have not destroyed it ; a quantity it is 
said has, been lying there. It is much to be wished that 
General Greene were at the south. The delegates from 
that quarter think the situation of Cornwallis delicate, and 
that by management, and a proper application and use of 
the force there, the late check given Ferguson might be improved into the Earl's total defeat. This, I fear, is too much 
even to hope. The sending the Baron is considered, as far 
as I have heard, perfectly right, and Lee's corps give great 
satisfaction. I am just about to mount my horse, and therefore shall say but little more. Laurens will write unto you 
in a few days, I suppose, and communicate any new occurrences. My love to the lads of the family, the same to 
you. May you be long happy. My most respectful compliments to the General. 

Most truly and affectionately, 

ROB. H. HARRISON. 

P. S. The Board have been absolutely too poor to procure parchment for the many promotions that have been 
required.

GENERAL GREENE TO COLONEL HAMILTON. 

January 10th, 17S1. 

MY DEAR COLONEL, 

General Du Portail being on his way to the northward, 
gives me an opportunity to write you, which I should have 
done before, had not my letters to his excellency contained 
as full information of the state of things as I was able to 
give, from the little time I had been in the department. 

When I was appointed to this command, I expected to 
meet with many new and singular difficulties ; but they infinitely exceed what I apprehended. This is really carrying on a war in an enemy's country ; for you cannot establish the most inconsiderable magazine, or convey the 
smallest quantity of stores from one post to another, without being obliged to detach guards for their security. The 
division among the people is much greater than I imagined, 
and the whigs and tories persecute each other, with little 
less than savage fury. There is nothing but murders, and 
devastations, in every quarter. 

The loss of our army at Charleston, and the defeat of 
General Gates, has been the cause of keeping such shoals 
of militia on foot, and their service has been accompanied 
with such destruction and loss, as has almost laid waste the 
whole country. Nothing has been more destructive to the 
true interest of this country, than the mode adopted for its 
defence. Two misfortunes happening, one after the other, 
may have rendered it unavoidable the last season ; but 
should it be continued, the inhabitants are inevitably ruined, 
and the resources of the country rendered incapable of affording support to an army competent to its defence. Government here is infinitely more popular than to the northward, and there is no such thing as national character or 
national sentiment. The inhabitants are from all quarters 
of the globe, and as various in their opinions, projects, and 
schemes, as their manners and habits are from their early 
education. Those in office, from a vanity to be thought 
powerful, join in the measure of imposing upon the public 
respecting the strength and resources of these southern 
states ; and while congress, and the minister of France, are 
kept under this fatal delusion, I fear little support will be 
given to this department. The inhabitants are numerous ; 
but they would be rather formidable abroad than at home. 
They are scattered over such a vast extent of country, that 
it is difficult to collect, and still more difficult to subsist 
them. There is a great spirit of enterprise among the back 
people, and those that come out as volunteers are not a little formidable to the enemy. There are, also, some particular corps, under Sumpter, Marion, and Clarke, that are 
bold and daring ; the rest of the militia are better calculated to destroy provisions than oppose the enemy. 

At Philadelphia, and all my journey through the country, 
I endeavoured to impress upon those in power, the necessity of sending clothing, and supplies of every kind, immediately to this army. But poverty was urged as a plea, in bar 
to every application. They all promised fair, but I fear 
will do but little : ability is wanting with some, and inclination with others. 

Public credit is so totally lost, that private people will not 
give their aid, though they see themselves involved in one 
common ruin. It is my opinion, that General Washington's 
influence will do more than all the assemblies upon the continent. I always thought him exceeding popular; but in 
many places he is little less than adored, and universally 
admired. His influence in this country might possibly 
effect something great. However, I found myself exceedingly well received, but more from being the friend of the 
General, than from my own merit. 

This country wants for its defence a small, but well appointed army, organized so as to move with great celerity. 
It should consist of about five thousand infantry, and from 
eight hundred to a thousand horse. The enemy cannot 
maintain a large force in this quarter, neither can we. The 
resources of the country are too small to subsist a large 
body of troops at any one point ; and to draw supplies from 
a distance through such long tracts of barren land, will be 
next to impossible, unless the business can be aided by a 
water transportation, and in cither case, it will be accompanied with an amazing expense. Could we get a superiority 
of horse, we could soon render it difficult for Lord Cornwallis to hold his position so far in the country. Nor should 
I be under any apprehension with a much inferior force to 
his, of taking post near him, if I had but such a body of 
horse. But the enemy's horse is so much superior to ours, 
that we cannot move a detachment towards them, without 
hazarding its ruin. 

When I came to the army, I found it in a most wretched 
condition. The officers had lost all confidence in the General, and the troops all their discipline. The troops had not 
only lost their discipline, but they were so addicted to 
plundering, that they were a terror to the country. The 
General and I met at least upon very civil terms; and he 
expressed the greatest happiness at my being appointed to 
succeed him. 

General Smallwood and he were not upon good terms ; 
the former suspected the latter of having an intention to 
supplant him, but many think without reason. Others^ 
again, are of opinion, his suspicions were well founded, and 
that Smallwood was not a little mortified at my being appoint^ 
ed to this department, and got outrageous when he heard 
Baron Steuben was coming also. How the matter was, I 
know not ; certain it is, he is gone home, having refused to 
act under Baron Steuben, and declares he will not serve at 
all, unless congress will give him a commission, dated at 
least two years before his appointment. This, I think, can 
never happen, notwithstanding his private merit, and the 
claim of the state. The battle of Camden.here is represented widely different from what it is to the northward. 
Colonel Williams thinks that none of the general officers 
were entitled to any extraordinary merit. The action was 
short, and succeeded by a flight, wherein every body took 
care of himself, as well officers as soldiers. Not an officer, except Major Anderson, and one or two captains, that 
brought off the field of battle a single soldier. The Colonel also says, that General Gates would have shared little 
more disgrace, than is the common lot of the unfortunate, 
notwithstanding .he was early off, if he had only halted at 
the Waxhaws or Charlotte ; the first about sixty, and the 
last about eighty miles from the field of battle. What little incidents either give or destroy reputation ? How many 
long hours a man may labour with an honest zeal in his 
country's service, and be disgraced for the most trifling error either in conduct or opinion? Hume very justly observes, no man will have reputation, unless he is useful to society, be his merit or abilities what they may. 
Therefore, it is necessary for a man to be fortunate, as well 
as wise and just. The greater part of the loss of the Maryland line, in the action of Camden, happened after they began to retreat : indeed,. this was the case with all the troops. 
What gave Smallwood such great reputation, was his halt 
at Salisbury, which was nothing but accident. You know 
there are great parties prevailing in the Maryland line, and 
perhaps his merit is not a little diminished on that account. 
I think him a brave and good officer, but too slow to effect 
any thing great in a department like this, where embarrassments are without number ; and where nothing can be effected without the greatest promptitude and decision. This 
army is in such a w r retched condition, that I hardly know 
what to do with it. The officers have got such a habit of 
negligence, and the soldiers so loose and disorderly, that it 
is next to impossible to give it a military complexion. 
Without clothing, I am sure I shall never do it. I call no 
councils of war, and I communicate my intentions to very 
few. The army was posted at Charlotte when I came up 
with it, and in a council, it had been determined to winter 
there ; but the difficulty of procuring subsistence, and other 
reasons, induced me not only to take a new position, but to 
make an entire new disposition. All this I effected by a 
single order, having first made the necessary inquiry respecting the new positions, by sending a man to examine the 
grounds and other requisites. If I cannot inspire the army 
with confidence, and respect by an independent conduct, I 
foresee it will be impossible to instil discipline and order 
among the troops. General Leslie has arrived, and joined 
Lord Cornwallis, whose force now is more than three times 
larger than ours ; and we are subsisting ourselves by our 
own industry, and I am not without hopes of forming something like a magazine. I am labouring also to get clothing 
from every quarter ; Baron Steuben is in Virginia, and is 
indefatigable in equipping and forwarding the troops from 
that state. I left General Gates in Maryland for the same 
purpose ; but I have got nothing from there yet, nor do I 
expect much for months to come. The North Carolina 
state have such a high opinion of the militia, that I don't 
expect they will ever attempt to raise a single continental 
soldier; notwithstanding the most sensible among them 
will acknowledge the folly of employing militia. 

But I must have tired your patience, and therefore will 
make a full stop concerning matters in this department, 
and inquire how you go on to the northward. \ Have you 
got married ? If you have, please to present my compliments to Mrs. Hamilton ; if not, to Miss Schuyler, and to 
the General and family in either case. 
I beg my compliments to General Washington's family, 
to General Knox and his family, and all other of my acquaintances. 

I shall be exceedingly obliged to you if you will communicate to me, with great freedom, every thing worthy of 
note that is said or respects this department.

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Paramus, November 28, 1780. 

DEAR HAMILTON, 

Here I arrived last night, and am going to set out for 
Philadelphia. Gouvion goes straight to New- Windsor, and 
by him I write to the General. I speak of Hand and Smith, 
whom I recommend, and add, If, however, you was to 
ca'st your eye on a man who, I think, would suit better than 
any other in the world, Hamilton is, I confess, the officer 
whom I would like best to see in my *****. Then I go 
on with the idea, that at equal advantages, you deserve from 
him the preference ; that your advantages are the greatest ; 
I speak of a co-operation ; of your being in the family ; and 
conclude, that on every public and private account, I advise 
him to take you. 

I know the General's friendship and gratitude for you, 
my dear Hamilton ; both are greater than you perhaps imagine. I am sure he needs only to be told that something 
will suit you, and when he thinks he can do it, he certainly 
will. Before this campaign I was your friend, and very 
intimate friend, agreeable to the ideas of the world ; since 
my second voyage, my sentiment has increased to such a 
point, the world knows nothing about. To show both, from 
want and from scorn of expressions, I shall only tell you 
adieu. 

Yours, 

LA FAYETTE.

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Philadelphia, December 9th, 1780. 

DEAR HAMILTON, 

On my arrival at Paramus, I wrote a letter to the General, which Colonel Gouvion was to deliver to himself at 
New- Windsor; so that more expedition had been made than 
you had thought. But the General having unfortunately 
altered his mind, and taken the road to Morristown, another 
misfortune threw Hand in his way, and remembering your 
advices on the occasion, he hastened to make him the proposition, and in consequence of it wrote his letter to congress. From Paramus I went myself to the Lots, and from 
thence to Morristown, where I met the General, and knowing that my letter could not reach him under some days, I 
became regardless of your wishes, and made a verbal application in my own name, and about the same time that had 
been settled between us. I can't express to you, my dear 
friend, how sorry and disappointed I felt, when I knew from 
him, the General, that (greatly in consequence of your advice,) he had settled the whole matter with Hand, and written for him to congress. I confess, I became warmer on 
the occasion than you would perhaps have wished me to 
be, and I wanted the General to allow my sending an express, who would have overtaken the letter, as it was in the 
hands of General St. Clair ; but the General did not think 
it to be a convenient measure, and, I confess, I may have 
been a little blinded on its propriety. I took care not to 
compromise you in this affair, when the General expressed 
a desire to serve you, and in a manner you would have been 
satisfied with. Now for the voyage to France. 

Congress seem resolved that an Envoy be sent in the way 
you wish, and this was yesterday determined in the house. 
Next Monday the gentleman will be elected. I have already 
spoken to many members ; I know of a number of voices 
that will be for you. This day and that of to-morrow will 
be by me employed in paying visits. As soon as the business is fixed upon, I shall send you an express; I think 
you ought to hold yourself in readiness, and in case you are 
called for, come with all possible speed ; for you must go 
immediately, that you may have returned before the beginning of operations. If you go, my dear sir, I shall give you 
all public or private knowledge about Europe I am possessed of. Besides many private letters, that may introduce 
you to my friends, I intend giving you the key of the cabinet, as well as of the societies which influence them. In a 
word, my good friend, any thing in my power shall be entirely yours.

[On the sixteenth of January, Colonel Hamilton, whose correspondence with General Schuyler became frequent, 
wrote to him, informing him of these events, and declining 
a very liberal offer of pecuniary aid. On the twenty-fifth 
he received the following reply : ]

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday I received your favour of the sixteenth instant. It affords me pleasure to learn that the Pennsylvania line is reduced to order ; but we, in this quarter, are 
on the point of experiencing a similar commotion. The 
two regiments threaten to march to head quarters, unless 
some money is paid them ; the certificates for the depreciation expedited, and in future to be supplied with provisions. 

Yesterday about three thousand bushels of wheat, six 
hundred pound's worth of beef, and three or four thousand 
dollars, were subscribed. I am in hopes we shall procure 
what will afford each man about ten dollars, and I have 
some hopes that this, with a little management, will render 
them tolerably quiet.* 

You cannot, my dear sir, be more happy at the connexion you have made with my family, than I am. Until the 
child of a parent has made a judicious choice, his heart is 
in continual anxiety ; but this anxiety was removed on the 
moment I discovered it was you on whom she had placed 
her affections. I am pleased with every instance of delicacy in those who are so dear to me ; and I think I read 
your soul on the occasion you mention. I shall, therefore,

enlistment had expired, had repaired, in large numbers, to the seaports, in order to engage themselves in privateering ; that an embargo had been laid for 
the purpose of filling their battalion; and unless Massachusetts and RhodeIsland acted in concert, her soldiers would repair to their ports with the same 
intent ; and therefore Connecticut requested those states to lay and continue 
embargoes for the same purpose.

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Elk, April 10th, 1781. 

Where is, for the present, my dear Hamilton ? This 
question is not a mere affair of curiosity. It is not even 
wholly owing to the tender sentiments of my friendship. 
But motives, both of a public and private nature, conspire 
in making me wish that your wo be not accomplished. 
Perhaps you are at head quarters, perhaps at Albany ; at 
all events, I'll tell you my history. 

Had the French fleet come in, Arnold was ours. The 
more certain it was, the greater my disappointment has 
been ; at last it has become necessary for them to return 
to Rhode-Island. I think they have exerted themselves for 
the common good, and this has been a comfort in our misfortune. Having luckily arrived at Elk by water, which 
at first I had no right to expect, I have received the General's letter. If you are at head quarters, you will have 
seen my correspondence with the General ; if not, I tell you 
that I am ordered to the southern army, and the General 
thinks that the army under his immediate command will 
remain inactive. After a march of forty days, we will arrive at a time when the heat of the season will put an end 
to operations. This detachment is so circumstanced, as to 
make it very inconvenient for officers and men to proceed. 
Before we arrive, we shall perhaps be reduced to five or 
six hundred men. 

There will be no light infantry formed, no attack 
against New- York, none of those things which had flattered my mind. 

If a corps is sent to the southward by land, it ought to 
have been the Jersey line, because if we weaken ourselves, 
New- York will be out of the question. 

Monsieur Destouches will, I think, propose to the General to send to Philadelphia 1'Eveille, and all the frigates ; 
these, with the frigates now at Philadelphia, would carry 
fifteen hundred men to whatever part of the continent the 
General would think proper. We could then go to Morristown, there to form a new corps of light infantry upon 
the principles at first intended, and embarking in the first 
days of May, we could be at Wilmington, Georgetown, or 
any where else, sooner than we can now be by land. 

I would have the battalions composed of six companies ; 
colonels employed, Webb, Sprout, Huntington, Olney, 
Hull, Barber, Gimat, Laurens ; Majors Willet, Fish, Gibbes, Inspector Smith, , and another ; Brigadier General Huntington and Scamell, and a good corps of artillery under ******. My dear friend, you would be more 
important at head quarters ; but if you don't stay there, 
you know what you have promised to me. Adieu. Write 
me often and long letters. It is probable I will be in the 
southern wilderness until the end of the war, far from head 
quarters, from the French army, from my correspondence 
with France ; but the whole good I could have operated, in 
this last instance, must have taken place by this time. My 
best respects and affectionate compliments wait on Mrs. 
Hamilton. 

Most friendly, yours, 

LA FAYETTE.

On the eighteenth, (April,) he writes him from the Susquehanna : 

DEAR HAMILTON, 

You are so sensible a fellow, that you can certainly explain to me what is the matter that New-York is given up ; 
that our letters to France go for nothing ; that while the 
French are coming, I am going. This last matter gives 
great uneasiness to the Minister of France. All this is not 
comprehensible to me, who having been long from head 
quarters, have lost the course of intelligence. 

Have you left the family, my dear sir ? I suppose so ; 
but from love to the General, for whom you know my affection, I ardently wish it was not the case ; many, many 
reasons conspire to this desire of mine. But if you do leave 
it, and if I go to exile, come and partake it with me. 

Yours, 

"1. f."

[Within a short time after this correspondence closed, a 
letter was received from La Fayette, dated Richmond, 
May 23, 1781.] 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

I have been long complaining that I had nothing to do ; 
and want of employment was an objection I had to my 
going to the southward. But for the present, my dear 
friend, my complaint is quite of an opposite nature ; and I 
have so many arrangements to make, so many difficulties 
to combat, so many enemies to deal with, that I am just 
that much of a general as will make me an historian of misfortunes, and nail my name upon the ruins of what good 
soldiers are pleased to call the army in Virginia. 

There is an age past since I heard from you. I acknowledge that, on my part, I have not written so often as I 
ought to have done ; but you will excuse this silence in 
favour of my very embarrassing circumstances. However 
remote you may be from your former post of aid-de-camp 
to the commander-jn-chief, I am sure you are nevertheless 
acquainted with every transaction at head quarters. My 
letters have served to your information, and I shall consequently abstain from repetitions. 

Our forced march saved Richmond. Philips w r as going 
down, and thus far I am very happy. Philips' return, his 
landing at Brendon, south side of James river, and the unmolested joining of Lord Cornwallis through North Carolina, made me apprehensive of the storm that was gathering. I advanced towards Petersburg, and intended to have 
established a communication upon James and Appamatox 
rivers. Had Philips marched to Halifax, I was determined 
to follow him, and should have risked every thing rather 
to omit making a diversion in favour of Greene. But that 
army took possession of Petersburg, and obliged me to 
stick to the side of the river, whence reinforcements are 
expected. Both armies have formed their junction of between four and five thousand men. We have no continentals ; their infantry is near five to one; their cavalry ten to 
one. Our militia are not numerous, without arms, and are 
not used to war. Government wants energy ; and there 
is nothing to enforce the laws. General Greene has directed me to take command in this state, and I must tell 
you, by the way, his letter is very polite and affectionate. 
It then became my duty to arrange the departments, which 
1 found in the greatest confusion and relaxation ; nothing 
can be obtained, and yet expenses are enormous. The Baron, and the few new levies we could collect, are ordered 
to South Carolina. I am glad he goes, as the hatred of the 
Virginians to him was pretty hurtful to the service. Is it 
not strange that General Wayne's detachment cannot be 
heard of? They are to go to Carolina ; but should I have 
them for a few days, I am at liberty to keep them. This 
permission I will improve so far as to receive one blow, 
that, being beat, I may at least be beat with some decency. 
There are accounts that Lord Cornwallis is very strong, 
others make him very weak. In this country there is no 
getting good intelligence. I request you will write me, if 
you approve of my conduct. The command of the waters, 
the superiority in cavalry, and the great disproportion of 
forces, gave the enemy such advantages that I durst not 
venture out, and listen to my fondness for enterprise ; to 
speak truth, I was afraid of myself as much as of the enemy. Independence has rendered me the more cautious, as 
I know my own warmth ; but if the Pennsylvanians come, 
Lord Cornwallis shall pay something for his victory. 
I wish a reinforcement of light infantry, to recruit the 
battalions, or a detachment under General Huntington was 
sent to me. I wish Laurens or Sheldon were immediately 
despatched with some horse. Come here, my dear friend, 
and command our artillery in Virginia. I want your advices and your exertions. If you grant my request, you 
will vastly oblige your friend, 

LA FAYETTE.

ROBERT MORRIS TO HAMILTON. 

Office of Finance, Philadelphia, May 2d, 1782.
 
SIR, 

Mr. Charles Stuart, late commissary general of issues, 
has informed me that you are disposed to quit the military 
line, for the purpose of entering into civil life. He, at the 
same time, induced me to believe that you would accept the 
office of receiver of the continental taxes in the state of NewYork. The intention of this letter is to offer you that appointment. The duties of the office will appear, in a great 
degree, from the publications made by me on this subject. 
In addition, it will be necessary that you correspond with 
me frequently, and give accurate accounts of whatever 
may be passing in your state, which it may be necessary 
for this office to be acquainted with. For the trouble of 
executing it, I shall allow a fourth per cent, on the monies 
you receive. The amount of the quota called for from 
New-York for the current year is, as you know, three hundred and seventy-three thousand five hundred and ninetyeight dollars. 

I make no professions of my confidence and esteem, because I hope none are necessary ; but if they are, my wish 
that you would accept the offer I make, is the strongest 
evidence I can give of them." 

Hamilton made the following reply. " I had this day the 
honour of receiving your letter of the second instant, and 
am much obliged by the mark of your confidence which it 
contains, and to Colonel Stuart for his friendly intentions 
upon the occasion. 

My military situation has indeed become so negative, 
that I have no motives to continue in it, and if my services 
could be of importance to .the public in any civil line, I 
should cheerfully obey its command. But the plan which 
I have marked out for myself is the profession of the law, 
and I am now engaged in a course of studies for that purpose. 
Time is so precious to me, that I could not put myself in 
the way of any interruptions, unless for an object of consequence to the public or to myself. The present is not of 
this nature. Such are the circumstances of this state, that 
the benefit arising from the office you propose, would not, 
during the war, yearly exceed one hundred pounds ; for 
unfortunately, I am persuaded, it will not pay annually into 
the continental treasury forty thousand pounds ; and on a 
peace establishment this will not be, for some time to come, 
more than doubled. You will perceive that an engagement of this kind does not correspond with my views, and 
does not afford a sufficient inducement to relinquish them. 

I am not the less sensible to the obliging motives which 
dictated the offer, and it will be an additional one to the 
respect and esteem with which I have the honour to be, 
very truly, sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant."

[On the twenty-sixth of May, the following reply was received from the Superintendent of Finance.] 
</p><p>
ROBERT MORRIS TO COLONEL HAMILTON. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
It is some time since I received your performance, dated 
the thirtieth Apnjl last. I have read it with that attention 
which it greatly deserves, and finding many points of it to 
coincide with my own opinions on the subject, it naturally 
strengthened that confidence which every man ought to 
possess, to a certain degree, in his own judgement. You 
will very soon see the plan of a bank published, and subscriptions opened for its establishment, having already met 
with the approbation of congress. It only remains for individuals to do their part, and a foundation will be laid for 
the anticipation of. taxes and funds, by a paper credit that 
cannot depreciate. The capital proposed, falls far short of 
your idea, and, indeed, far short of what it ought to be ; but 
the capital may afterwards be increased to almost anv 
amount. To propose a larger sum in the outset, and fail 
in the attempt to raise it, might prove fatal ; to begin with 
what is clearly in our power to accomplish, and on that beginning to establish the credit that will inevitably command 
the future increase of capital, seems the most certain road 
to success. I have thought much about interweaving a 
land security with the capital of this bank, but am apprehensive it would convey to the public mind an idea of paper 
being circulated on that credit ; and that the bank, of consequence, must fail in its payments in case of any considerable run on it, and we must expect that its ruin will be 
attempted by external and internal foes. I have, therefore, 
left that point to the future deliberations of the directors of 
this bank, to whom, in due time, I shall communicate your 
address. I esteem myself much your debtor for this piece, 
not merely on account of the personal respect you have 
been pleased to express, but also on account of your good 
intentions ; and for these, and the pains you have taken, I 
not only think, but on all proper occasions shall say, the 
public are also indebted to you. 
</p><p>
My office is new, and I am young in the execution of it. 
Communications from men of genius and abilities will always 
be acceptable, and yours will ever command the attention of 
Sir, your obedient, humble servant, 
</p><p>
ROBT. MORRIS. 
</p><p>
Col. Alex. Hamilton, of the Artillery.
