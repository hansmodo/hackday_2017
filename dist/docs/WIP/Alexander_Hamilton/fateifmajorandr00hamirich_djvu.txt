Since my return from Hartford, my dear Laurens, 
my mind has been too little at ease to permit me to 
write to you sooner. It has been wholly occupied by 
the affecting and tragic consequences of Arnold s 
treason. My feelings were never put to so severe a 
trial. You will no doubt have heard the principal 
facts before this reaches you; but there are particulars to which my situation gave me access, that cannot 
have come to your knowledge from public report, 
which I am persuaded you will find interesting. 

From several circumstances, the project seems to 
have originated with Arnold himself, and to have 
been long premeditated. The first overture is traced 
back to some time in June last. It was conveyed in a 
letter to Colonel Robinson, the substance of which was, 
that the ingratitude he had experienced from his country, concurring with other causes, had entirely changed 
his principles; that he now only sought to restore him 
self to the favour of his king by some signal proof of 
his repentance, and would be happy to open a correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton for that purpose. 
About this period he made a journey to Connecticut; 
on his return from which to Philadelphia, he solicited 
the command of West Point, alleging that the effects of 
his wound had disqualified him for the active duties 
of the field. The sacrifice of this important post was 
the atonement he intended to make. General Washing 
ton hesitated the less to gratify an officer who had 
rendered such eminent services, as he was convinced 
the post might be safely entrusted to one who had given 
so many distinguished proofs of his bravery. In the 
beginning of August he joined the army, and renewed 
his application. The enemy at this juncture had em 
barked the greatest part of their force on an expedition 
to Rhode Island, and our army was in motion to compel them to relinquish the enterprise, or to attack New 
York in its weakened state. The General offered Arnold the left wing of the army, which he declined, on 
the pretext already mentioned, but not without visible 
embarrassment. He certainly might have executed the 
duties of such a temporary command, and it was expected from his enterprising temper, that he would 
gladly have embraced so splendid an opportunity. But 
he did not choose to be diverted a moment from his favourite object; probably from an apprehension, that 
some different disposition might have taken place 
which would have excluded him. The extreme solicitude he discovered to get possession of the post, would have led to a suspicion of treachery, had it been possible, from his past conduct, to have supposed him capable of it. 

The correspondence thus begun, was carried on between Arnold and Major Andre, Adjutant General to 
the British army, in behalf of Sir Henry Clinton, under 
feigned signatures, and in a mercantile disguise. In 
an intercepted letter of Arnold, which lately fell into 
our hands, he proposes an interview "to settle the risks 
and profit of the copartnership/ and in the same style 
of metaphor intimates an expected augmentation of the 
garrison, and speaks of it as the means of extending 
their traffic. It appears by another letter, that Andre 
was to have met him on the lines, under the sanction of 
a flag, in the character of Mr. John Anderson. But 
some cause or other, not known, prevented this inter 
view. 

The twentieth of last month, Robinson and Andre 
went up the river in the Vulture sloop of war. Robin 
son sent a flag to Arnold with two letters, one to General Putnam, enclosed in another to himself, proposing 
an interview with Putnam, or in his absence with Arnold, to adjust some private concerns. The one to 
General Putnam was evidently meant as a cover to the 
other, in case, by accident, the letters should have fallen 
under the inspection of a third person. 

General Washington crossed the river on his way to 
Hartford, the day these despatches arrived. Arnold, 
conceiving he must have heard of the flag, thought it 
necessary, for the sake of appearances, to submit the 
letters to him, and ask his opinion of the propriety of 
complying with the request. The General, with his 
usual caution, though without the least surmise of the 
design, dissuaded him from it, and advised him to reply 
to Robinson, that whatever related to his private affairs must be of a civil nature, and could only properly 
be addressed to the civil authority. This reference 
fortunately deranged the plan, and was the first link 
in the chain of events that led to the detection. The interview could no longer take place in the form of a 
flag, but was obliged to be managed in a secret manner. 
Arnold employed one Smith to go on board the Vulture the night of the twenty-second, to bring Andre on 
shore with a pass for Mr. John Anderson. Andre came 
ashore accordingly, and was conducted within a picket 
of ours to the house of Smith, where Arnold and he remained together in close conference all that night and 
the day following. At daylight in the morning, the 
commanding officer at King s Ferry, without the privity of Arnold, moved a couple of pieces of cannon to a 
point opposite to where the Vulture lay, and obliged her to take a more remote station. This event, or some 
lurking distrust, made the boatmen refuse to convey the two passengers back, and disconcerted Arnold so 
much, that by one of those strokes of infatuation which often confound the schemes of men conscious of guilt, 
he insisted on Andre s exchanging his uniform for a 
disguise, and returning in a mode different from that 
in which he came. Andre, who had been undesignedly 
brought within our posts, in the first instance, remonstrated warmly against this new and dangerous expedient. But Arnold persisting in declaring it impossible 
for him to return as he came, he at length reluctantly 
yielded to his direction, and consented to change his 
dress, and take the route he recommended. Smith furnished the disguise, and in the evening passed King s 
Ferry with him, and proceeded to Crompond, where 
they stopped the remainder of the night (at the instance 
of a militia officer), to avoid being suspected by him. 
The next morning they resumed their journey, Smith 
accompanying Andre a little beyond Pine s Bridge, 
where he left him. He had reached Tarrytown, when 
he was taken up by three militia men, who rushed out 
of the woods, and seized his horse. At this critical 
moment, his presence of mind forsook him. Instead 
of producing his pass, which would have extricated 
him from our parties, and could have done him no 
harm with his own, he asked the militia men if they 
were of the upper or lower party, distinctive appellations known among the refugee corps. The militia 
men replied, they were of the lower party; upon which 
he told them he was a British officer, and pressed them 
not to detain him as he was upon urgent business. This 
confession removed all doubt; and it was in vain he 
afterwards produced his pass. He was instantly forced 
off to a place of greater security; where, after a careful search, there were found concealed in the feet of his 
stockings, several papers of importance delivered to 
him by Arnold. Among these there were a plan of 
the fortifications of West Point, a memorial from the 
engineer on the attack and defence of the place, returns 
of the garrison, cannon, and stores, copy of the minutes 
of a council of war held by General Washington a few 
weeks before. The prisoner at first was inadvertently 
ordered to Arnold; but on recollection, while still on 
the way, he was countermanded and sent to Old 
Salem. 

The papers were enclosed in a letter to General Washington, which having taken a route different 
from that by which he returned, made a circuit, that 
afforded leisure for another letter, through an ill- 
judged delicacy, written to Arnold, with information 
of Anderson s capture, to get to him an hour before 
General Washington arrived at his quarters, time 
enough to elude the fate that awaited him. He went 
down the river in his barge to the Vulture, with such 
precipitate confusion, that he did not take with him 
a single paper useful to the enemy. On the first notice of the affair he was pursued, but much too late to be overtaken. 

There was some colour for imagining it was a part of 
the plan to betray the General into the hands of the 
enemy : Arnold was very anxious to ascertain from him 
the precise day of his return, and the enemy s movements seem to have corresponded to this point. But if 
it was really the case, it was very injudicious. The 
success must have depended on surprise, and as the 
officers at the advanced posts were not in the secret, 
their measures might have given the alarm, and General Washington, taking the command of the post, 
might have rendered the whole scheme abortive. Arnold, it is true, had so dispersed the garrison as to have 
made a defence difficult, but not impracticable; and 
the acquisition of West Point was of such magnitude 
to the enemy, that it would have been unwise to connect it with any other object, however great, which 
might make the obtaining of it precarious. 

Arnold, a moment before his setting out, went into 
Mrs. Arnold s apartment, and informed her that some 
transactions had just come to light, which must forever 
banish him from his country. She fell into a swoon 
at this declaration, and he left her in it to consult his 
own safety, till the servants, alarmed by her cries, came 
to her relief. She remained frantic all day, accusing 
every one who approached her with an intention to 
murder her child (an infant in her arms), and exhibit 
ing every other mark of the most genuine and agonizing distress. Exhausted by the fatigue and tumult of 
her spirits, her phrenzy subsided towards evening, and she sunk into all the sadness of affliction. It was impossible not to have been touched with her situation ; every 
thing affecting in female tears, or in the misfortunes of 
beauty, everything pathetic in the wounded tenderness 
of a wife, or in the apprehensive fondness of a mother, 
and, till I have reason to change the opinion, I will add, 
everything amiable in suffering innocence, conspired 
to make her an object of sympathy to all who were present. She experienced the most delicate attentions, and 
every friendly office, till her departure for Philadelphia. 

Andre was, without loss of time, conducted to the 
headquarters of the army, where he was immediately 
brought before a board of general officers, to prevent 
all possibility of misrepresentation or cavil on the part 
of the enemy. 

The board reported that he ought to be considered as a spy, and according to the laws and usages of nations, to suffer death, which was executed two days after. 

Never, perhaps, did any man suffer death with more 
justice, or deserve it less. The first step he took after 
his capture, was to write a letter to General Washing 
ton, conceived in terms of dignity without insolence, 
and apology without meanness. The scope of it was 
to vindicate himself from the imputation of having 
assumed a mean character, for treacherous or interested 
purposes; asserting that he had been involuntarily an imposter; that contrary to his intention, which was to 
meet a person for intelligence on neutral ground, he 
had been betrayed within our posts, and forced into 
the vile condition of an enemy in disguise; soliciting 
only that to whatever rigour policy might devote him, 
a decency of treatment might be observed due to a per 
son who, though unfortunate, had been guilty of nothing dishonourable. His request was granted in its full 
extent; for in the whole progress of the affair, he was 
treated with the most scrupulous delicacy. When 
brought before the board of officers, he met with every 
mark of indulgence, and was required to answer no interrogatory which would even embarrass his feelings. 
On his part, while he carefully concealed everything 
that might implicate others, he frankly confessed all 
the facts relating to himself, and upon his confession, 
without the trouble of examining a witness, the board 
made their report. The members were not more impressed with the candour and firmness, mixed with a 
becoming sensibility, which he displayed, than he was 
penetrated with their liberality and politeness. He acknowledged the generosity of the behaviour towards 
him in every respect, but particularly in this, in the 
strongest terms of manly gratitude. In a conversation 
with a gentleman who visited him after his trial, he 
said, he flattered himself he had never been illiberal; 
but if there were any remains of prejudice in his mind, 
his present experience must obliterate them. 

In one of the visits I made to him (and I saw him several times during his confinement) , he begged me to be the bearer of a request to the General, for permission to send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton. "I 
foresee my fate," said he, "and though I pretend not to play the hero, or to be indifferent about life, yet I am reconciled to whatever may happen, conscious that 
misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon me. There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquility. Sir Henry Clinton has been too good to me; he has been lavish 
of his kindness; I am bound to him by too many obligations, and love him too well to bear the thought that he 
should reproach himself, or others should reproach him, on the supposition of my having conceived myself 
obliged, by his instructions, to run the risk I did. I would not, for the world, leave a sting in his mind 
that should embitter his future days." He could scarce finish the sentence, bursting into tears, in spite of his efforts to suppress them, and with difficulty collecting 
himself enough afterwards to add, "I wish to be permitted to assure him, I did not act under this impression, not submitted to a necessity imposed upon me, 
as contrary to my own inclinations, as to his orders." 
His request was readily complied with, and he wrote 
the letter annexed, with which I dare say you will be as 
much pleased as I am, both for the sentiment and diction. 

When his sentence was announced to him, he re 
marked, that since it was his lot to die, there was still a choice in the mode, which would make a material difference to his feelings; and he would be happy, if possible, to be indulged with a professional death. He 
made a second application by letter, in concise but persuasive terms. It was thought that this indulgence, 
being incompatable with the customs of war, could not 
be granted ; and it was, therefore, determined, in both 
cases, to evade an answer, to spare him the sensations, 
which a certain knowledge of the intended mode would 
inflict. 

In going to the place of execution, he bowed familiarly as he went along, to all those with whom he had 
been acquainted in his confinement. A smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude of his mind. 
Arrived at the fatal spot, he asked, with some emotion, 
"must I then die in this manner?" He was told it had 
been unavoidable. "I am reconciled to my fate (said 
he) , but not to the mode." Soon, however, recollecting 
himself, he added, "it will be but a momentary pang;" 
and springing upon the cart, performed the last offices 
to himself, with a composure that excited the admiration and melted the hearts of the beholders. Upon be 
ing told the final moment was at hand, and asked if he 
had anything to say, he answered, "nothing, but to re 
quest you will witness to the world, that I die like a 
brave man." Among the extraordinary circumstances 
that attended him, in the midst of his enemies he died 
universally regretted, and universally esteemed. 

There was something singularly interesting in the 
character and fortunes of Andre. To an excellent understanding, well improved by education and travel, 
he united a peculiar elegance of mind and manners, 
and the advantage of a pleasing person. It is said, he 
possessed a pretty taste for the fine arts, and had him 
self attained some proficiency in poetry, music, and 
painting. His knowledge appeared without ostentation, and embellished by a diffidence that rarely accompanies so many talents and accomplishments, which left you to suppose more than appeared. 

His sentiments were elevated, and inspired esteem; 
they had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocution was handsome; his address easy, polite, and insinuating. By his merit, he had acquired the unlimited 
confidence of his General, and was making a rapid 
progress in military rank and reputation. But in the 
height of his career, flushed with new hopes from the 
execution of a project the most beneficial to his party 
that could be devised, he was at once precipitated from 
the summit of prosperity, and saw all the expectations 
of his ambition blasted, and himself ruined. 

The character I have given of him, is drawn partly 
from what I saw of him myself, and partly from in 
formation. I am aware, that a man of real merit 
is never seen in so favourable a light as through the 
medium of adversity. The clouds that surround him 
are shades that set off his good qualities. Misfortune 
cuts down the little vanities, that in prosperous times 
serve as so many spots in his virtues, and gives a tone 
of humility that makes his worth more amiable. His 
spectators, who enjoy a happier lot, are less prone to 
detract from it through envy; and are more disposed 
by compassion to give him the credit he deserves, and 
perhaps even to magnify it. 

I speak not of Andre s conduct in this affair as a 
philosopher, but as a man of the world. The authorized maxims and practices of war are the satires of 
human nature. They countenance almost every species 
of seduction, as well as violence; and the General who 
can make most traitors in the army of his adversary 
is frequently most applauded. On this scale we acquit 
Andre, while we would not but condemn him if we 
were to examine his conduct by the sober rules of 
philosophy and moral rectitude. It is, however, a blemish on his fame, that he once intended to prostitute a 
flag, about this, a man of nice honour ought to have 
had a scruple; but the temptation was great. Let his 
misfortunes cast a veil over his error. 

Several letters from Sir Henry Clinton, and others, 
were received in the course of the affair, feebly at 
tempting to prove that Andre came out under the protection of a flag, with a passport from a general officer 
in actual service; and consequently could not be justly 
detained. Clinton sent a deputation, composed of 
Lieutenant-General Robinson, Mr. Elliot, and Mr. William Smith, to represent, as he said, the true state 
of Major Andre s case. General Greene met Robin 
son, and had a conversation with him, in which he 
reiterated the pretence of a flag, urged Andre s re 
lease as a personal favour to Sir Henry Clinton, and 
offered any friend of ours in their power in exchange. 
Nothing could have been more frivolous than the plea 
which was used. The fact was, that besides the time, 
manner, object of the interview, change of dress, and 
other circumstances, there was not a single formality 
customary with flags; and the passport was not to 
Major Andre, but to Mr. Anderson. But had there 
been, on the contrary, all the formalities, it would be 
an abuse of language to say, that the sanction of a flag, 
for corrupting an officer to betray his trust, ought to 
be respected. So unjustifiable a purpose would not only 
destroy its validity, but make it an aggravation. 

Andre himself has answered the argument, by ridiculing and exploding the idea, in his examination be 
fore the board of officers. It was a weakness to urge it. 

There was, in truth, no way of saving him. Arnold 
or he must have been the victim ; the "former was out of 
our power. 

It was by some suspected, Arnold had taken his 
measures in such a manner, that if the interview had 
been discovered in the act, it might have been in his 
power to sacrifice Andre to his own security. This 
surmise of double treachery, made them imagine Clinton would be induced to give up Arnold for Andre; 
and a gentleman took occasion to suggest the expedient to the latter, as a thing that might be proposed by 
him. He declined it. The moment he had been capable of so much frailty, I should have ceased to esteem him. 

The infamy of Arnold s conduct, previous to his desertion, is only equalled by his baseness since. Besides 
the folly of writing to Sir Henry Clinton, that Andre 
had acted under a passport from him, and according 
to his directions, while commanding officer at a post, 
and that therefore he did not doubt he would be immediately sent in, he had the effrontery to write to General Washington in the same spirit, with the addition of a 
menace of retaliation, if the sentence should be carried 
into execution. He has since acted the farce of send 
ing in his resignation. This man is, in every sense, despicable. In addition to the scene of knavery and prostitution during his command in Philadelphia, which 
the late seizure of his papers has unfolded, the history 
of his command at West Point is a history of little as 
well as great villanies. He practised every art of peculation; and even stooped to connexion with the 
suttlers of the garrison to defraud the public. 

To his conduct, that of the captors of Andre formed 
a striking contrast. He tempted them with the offer 
of his watch, his horse, and any sum of money they 
should name. They rejected his offers with indignation; and the gold that could seduce a man high in the 
esteem and confidence of his country, who had the 
remembrance of past exploits, the motives of present 
reputation and future glory, to prop his integrity, had 
no charms for three simple peasants, leaning only on 
their virtue and an honest sense of their duty. While 
Arnold is handed down, with execration, to future 
times, posterity will repeat with reverence the names 
of Van Wart, Paulding, and Williams. 

I congratulate my friend on our happy escape from 
the mischiefs with which this treason was big. It is a 
new comment on the value of an honest man, and, if 
it were possible, would endear you to me more than 
ever. Adieu.
