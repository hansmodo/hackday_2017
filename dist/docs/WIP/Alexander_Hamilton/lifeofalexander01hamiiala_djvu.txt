PREFACE 



^ IT is generally known, that the charge of pre- 

paring a BIOGRAPHY OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON 
x has been committed to different gentlemen of dis- 
J tinguished abilities, by whom, from various and 
*\ sufficient causes, it was not performed. 

After the lapse of many years, I was requested 
to undertake this work ; but a deep conviction of 

* my incapacity, the want of the necessary prepar- 


atory studies, and a distrust of the natural bias of 

my feelings, prompted me to decline it. 
vi An earnest appeal was then made by me to an 

J individual, whose eminent qualifications indicated 
him as the most appropriate Biographer of his 
" 

* friend,^ but without success. Thus often disap- 
pointed in an object of very dear interest, the 
request was renewed from a quarter which I felt 
I had not the right to refuse ; and I yielded a 
reluctant, though, I fear, it will be deemed a too 
ready assent. 

After these pages had been laid aside for fu-

ture revision, and while engaged in researches * 
relating to this subject, it was ascertained that a * 
hurried narrative was in progress. 

An anxiety to prevent the promulgation of new 
errors, and the earnest wishes of my friends, in- 
duced me to waive the benefits of a more delibe- 
rate examination ; and I consented to commit 
this production to the press, imperfect as it is. Y

THE LIFE OF 



ALEXANDER HAMILTON 



CHAPTER I. 

xj L*>/ 

ALEXANDER HAMILTON was born in the island of Nevis, 
on the eleventh of January, seventeen hundred and fifty- 
seven. On his father's side his origin was Scottish, and 
his lineage may be traced in " the Memoirs of the House 
of Hamilton,"* through the Cambuskeith branch of that 
House to a remote and renowned ancestry. 

His grandfather, "Alexander Hamilton of Grange," (the 
family seat situate in Ayrshire,) about the year seventeen 
hundred and thirty, married Elizabeth, the eldest daughter 
of Sir Robert Pollock, and had a numerous issue, of whom, 
James, his fourth son, was the father of the subject of this 
memoir. 

Being bred a merchant, and the West Indies opening an 
extensive field to commercial enterprise, he left Scotland 
for St. Christopher's, where, though at first successful,

derson, Licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh. 1825.

a THE LIFE OF 

through a too generous and easy temper he failed in bu- 
siness, and was, during the greater part of his life, in re- 
duced circumstances. 

In the early period of his reverses, he was supported by 
his friends in Scotland, and in his advanced age, by his son 
Alexander. He died in St. Vincents in the year seven- 
teen hundred and ninety-nine, having declined, by the 
advice of his physicians, the earnest solicitations of his son 
to join him in the United States. 

On his mother's side Hamilton's descent was French. 
His maternal grandfather was a Hugonot, a race to which 
America owes many of her most illustrious sons, who in this 
remote region, and after a lapse of two centuries, proved, 
during the war of independence, how proudly they had che- 
rished the virtuous and determined spirit of their progeni- 
tors. 

His name was Faucette. In the general expatriation of 
his protestant countrymen, which followed the revocation 
of the edict of Nantes, he emigrated to the West Indies, and 
settled in Nevis, where he successfully pursued the practice 
of medicine. 

He was a man of letters and of polished manners ; 
whether his original profession was that of a physician, or 
it was assumed after his emigration, is not ascertained. 

Hamilton was the offspring of a second marriage. His 
mother's first husband was a Dane, named Lavine, who, 
attracted by her beauty, and recommended to her mother 
by his wealth, received her hand against her inclination. 

The marriage proving unhappy, she applied for and ob- 
tained a divorce, and removing to St. Christopher's, there 
married the father of the subject of these notices, and had 
by him several sons, of whom Alexander was the youngest. 

His mother died when he was a child ; but the traces of 
her character remained vividly impressed upon his memory. 
He recollected her with inexpressible fondness, and often 



HAMILTON. 3 

spoke of her as a woman of superior intellect, highly cul- 
tivated, of elevated and generous sentiments, and of unusual 
elegance of person and manner. 

On her decease, the indigence of her husband threw their 
only surviving child upon the bounty of his mother's rela- 
tives, Mr. Peter Lytton and his sister, (afterwards Mrs. 
Mitchell,) who resided at Santa Cruz, where he received 
the rudiments of his education, commencing at a very ten- 
der age. 

As an instance of which, rarely as he dwelt upon his 
personal history, he mentioned his having been taught to 
repeat the Decalogue in Hebrew, at the school of a Jewess, 
when so small that he was placed standing by her side on 
a table. 

Many endearing traits of that generous and independent 
temper which were so conspicuous in his after life, appear- 
ed during his childhood. Hence, though his superiority 
occasionally awakened the envy of his comrades, it was 
soon disarmed by the amenity of his manners. 

There is reason to believe, from the low standard of edu- 
cation in the West Indies, that the circle of his early stu- 
dies was very limited, probably embracing little more than 
the rudiments of the English and French languages, the 
latter of which he subsequently wrote and spoke with the 
ease of a native. 

It is not, however, to be inferred, that his boyhood was 
spent in indolence ; with a strong propensity to literature, 
he early became a lover of books, and the time which other 
J youth employ in classical learning, was by him devoted 
| to miscellaneous reading, happily directed by the advice of 
/ Doctor Knox, a respectable presbyterian divine, who, de- 
lighted with the unfolding of his mind, took a deep interest 
\ in his welfare. 

\ The fervent piety of this gentleman, whose society he 
frequently enjoyed, gave a strong religious bias to his feel- 



4 THE LIFE OF 

ings ; and the topics of their conversation, opened to him 
an early glimpse of those polemical controversies which 
have called forth the highest efforts of intellect. 

In the autumn of seventeen hundred and sixty-nine, he 
was placed in the counting house of Mr. Nicholas Cruger, 
an opulent merchant, and most worthy man, then residing 
at Santa Cruz. Foreign as such an avocation was to his 
inclinations, he nevertheless gave to it all his habitual assi- 
duity, and soon mastered its details ; but the inward prompt- 
ings of his mind looked far beyond it. He thought of im- 
mortality, and fondly contemplated from his island home, 
those fields of glory and summits of honour which displayed 
themselves to his imagination from beyond the deep. > 

The kindness of an early friend preserved the following 
letter, written at this time to his school-fellow, Edward 
Stevens, in which his youthful aspirations are fully de- 
veloped. 

St Croix,Nov. 11, 1769. 
DEAR EDWARD, 

This serves to acknowledge the receipt of yours per 
Capt. Lowndes, which was delivered me yesterday. The 
truth of Capt. Lightbowen and Lowndes' information is now 
verified by the presence of your father and sister, for whose 
safe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that satisfac- 
tion to your soul, that must naturally flow from the sight of 
absent friends in health ; and shall for news this way, refer 
you to them. 

As to what you say, respecting your soon having the hap- 
piness of seeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of 
your hopes, provided they are concomitant with your wel- 
fare, otherwise not ; though doubt whether I shall be pre- 
sent or not, for to confess my weakness, Ned, my ambition 
is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling condition of 
a clerk, or the like, to which my fortune condemns 



HAMILTON. 5 

me, and would willingly risk my life, though not my cha- 
racter, to exalt my station. I am confident, Ned, that my 
youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate prefer- 
ment, nor do I desire it ; but I mean to prepare the way 
for futurity. I'm no philosopher, you see, and may be justly 
said to build castles in the air ; my folly makes me ashamed, 
and beg you'll conceal it ; yet, Neddy, we have seen such 
schemes successful, when the projector is constant. I shall 
conclude by saying, I wish there was a war. 
I am, 

Dear Edward, 
Yours, 

ALEX. HAMILTON. 

P. S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, 
and pleased to see you give such close application to study. 
Addressed to " Edward Stevens, in New-York" 

Such was Hamilton before he had reached the age of 
thirteen. 

xfruring the period which followed the peace of Paris, an 
unusual impulse was given to the commerce of the West 
Indies, and an active traffic being kept up by a free inter- 
course with the American colonies, the duties of his count- 
ing house became very laborious. 

His aptitude in conforming himself to his situation was 
such, and his advancement so rapid in the confidence of his 
respected principal, that before he reached his fourteenth 
year he was left by Mr. Cruger, who made a visit* to the 
American continent, at the head of his extensive establish- 
ment. 

Such of his letters as are preserved in the books of his 
employer, written to various persons in the islands, in Eu- 
rope and in America, display a capacity for business, which 
shows that this unusual trust was not misplaced. 

*1770. 



6 THE LIFE OF 

This occupation was the source of great and lasting be- 
nefit to him ; he felt himself amply rewarded for his labours, 
by the method and facility which it imparted to him ; and 
amid his various engagements in after years, adverted to 
it as the most useful part of his education. 

The little leisure which he could command from his mer- 
cantile duties was devoted to study: his knowledge of 
mathematics was enlarged ; he became fond of chemistry ; 
and although his proficiency in it was small, he often urged 
it as a pursuit well adapted to excite curiosity and create 
new combinations of thought. 

Among the books to which he had access, he preferred 
those which treat of some branch of ethics. His fa- 
vourite authors were Pope and Plutarch ; on the latter of 
which there remain several curious observations from his 
youthful pen ; but even these were often laid aside for 
the more profound researches of severer writers. 

He often also, at this time, exercised himself in compo- 
sition on moral topics, to which he afterwards occasionally 

^J 

I resorted as a relaxation from the arduous labours of his 
professional life ; and thus, by his varied studies, his mind 

N became rich in materials awaiting his call. S 

His aversion to mercantile pursuits, and his aspiring tem- 
per, leave little reason to suppose that he could have con- 
formed his life to the sphere in which it commenced. 

While "arms" seemed to have been his predominant 
passion, the world was at peace. Fortune appeared to have 
cut him off from every avenue to political distinction, and 
thus without a theatre of action, or prospect of preferment, 
it would be difficult to pronounce what, at this time, was 
his probable destiny ; but an event which would seem to 
be the last that could bode good to any being, lifted the 
veil. 

'f In August, seventeen hundred and seventy-two, soon after 
he had returned from a commercial expedition to St. Eu- 



HAMILTON. 7 

statia, the Leeward Islands were desolated by one of those 
terrific hurricanes which so often visit the tropics. Before 
the terrors of the scene had worn off, and while its effects 
were still visible, a description of it appeared, which though 
published in the neighbouring island of St. Christopher's, 
attracted universal attention at St. Croix ; and such was 
the impression it produced, that the governor and some of 
the principal persons of the island made an especial effort 
to discover its author, and ultimately traced it to Hamilton. 
This simple incident decided his fate. His wishes were 
consulted, and it was determined to send him to New- York 
to complete his education/ 

A short time after he left the West Indies in a vessel 
bound for Boston, where he arrived in the month of Octo- 
ber, 1772, having escaped during his passage an imminent 
peril; for, as he approached the American continent, the 
vessel was discovered to be on fire, which was with diffi- 
culty extinguished. 

He proceeded thence to New- York, where, through the 
kindness of his friend Dr. Knox, he was introduced to 
Doctors Rogers, Mason, and other gentlemen of distinc- 
tion. 

His relations had provided him with ample funds, and 
had made arrangements for future remittances. It 
only remained for him to choose the place of his instruc- 
tion. By the advice of these friends, he joined a celebrated 
grammar school at Elizabethtown, which was conducted 
under the patronage of Governor Livingston and Mr. Bou- 
dinot, in whose families he became intimate./ 

The principal of this school was Francis Barber ; a man 
of strong sense, considerable attainments, and respectable 
connexions. Fired by the prospect of distinction, and by 
his love of country, he broke up his school at the commence- 
ment of the revolution, entered the army, soon rose to 
the rank of colonel, and in the course of the contest was 



O THE LIFE OF 

often and much distinguished. Among his school-fellows 
were Jonathan Dayton, afterwards Speaker of the House of 
Representatives, Brockholst Livingston, and other indi- 
viduals, who subsequently acquired celebrity. 
yHis industry at this school kept pace with his enlarged 
prospects. During the winter, while at the house of Go- 
vernor Livingston, he was accustomed to labour until mid- 
night. In summer, it was his habit to retire at dawn to 
the quiet of a neighbouring cemetery, where he was often 
seen preparing his lessons for the day. By these exertions, 
he made rapid progress. 

During this time, his habits of composition were continu- 
ed : his essays occasionally touched upon political topics. 
He wrote an elegy on the death of a young lady in whose 
family he was intimate, which is remembered as possess- 
ing much merit. He also composed a prologue and epi- 
logue for a play, which was performed by the officers of a 
company of British soldiers stationed in the vicinity of 
Elizabethtown./ 

His friend, Mr. Boudinot, having lost an infant, he sat up 
to watch the corpse the night prior to its interment. During 
the performance of this gloomy office of friendship, he wrote 
some consolatory verses, which were presented to its mo- 
ther as a tribute of regard, and were long preserved with 
great interest. 

/Before the end of the year, he was deemed by his instruc- 
tor qualified to enter college / and after returning to New- 
York, proceeded with Mr. Hercules Mulligan,* in whose 

* Mr. H. Mulligan was a brother of Mr. M., of the firm of Kortwright & 
Co., to whom West India produce was consigned, to be sold and appropriated 
to the support of Hamilton. He outlived most of the revolutionary race, and 
had been very active in its earliest scenes. He was chosen by the citizens of 
New- York one of the revolutionary committee of one hundred ; and after the 
battle of Long Island, left the city, was captured on his journey, and detained 
there during the war. After Hamilton entered the family of Washington, 
Mulligan became the confidential correspondent of the commander-in-chief, 



HAMILTON. 9 

house he subsequently lodged, and from whom many of the 
incidents of his youthful life are derived, on a visit to Doc- 
tor Witherspoon, then president of the college at Princeton. 
On his introduction to this distinguished individual, he 
underwent a private examination. He then stated his de- 
sire to be admitted to either class which his attainments 
would justify ; but upon the condition that he might be per- 
mitted to advance from class to class, with as much rapidity 
as his exertions would enable him to do. The president, 
after listening to this novel proposition, replied that it was 
a subject resting in the discretion of the trustees, and pro- 
mised him an early decision. On his return to New-York, 
an answer was received from the president, that the esta- 
blished usages of the institution forbade a compliance with 
his wishes, but expressive of regret that he could not be 
admitted on his own terms, " inasmuch as he was convinced 
that the young gentleman would do honour lo any semina- 
ry in which he should be educated."/ He then entered 
Kings, (now Columbia College,) in the city of New- York, 
and under the auspices of that liberal institution, with 
the aid of a tutor, proceeded in the plan which he had 
marked out for himself, having been received as a private 
\ student, and not attached to any particular class/ 

'jTo his collegiate studies, he soon added that of anato- 
my, attending the lectures of Doctor Clossey ; a branch 
of knowledge which he was anxious to acquire, having been 
led from his early fondness for chemistry, to entertain the 
idea of selecting the practice of medicine as his permanent 
pursuit. 

Here, together with his earliest companion, Stevens, and 
his long-cherished and devoted friends, Robert Troup and 
Nicholas Fisn, he joined a debating club, which continued 

and furnished the most important intelligence. On the evacuation of that city, 
Washington commimented him by taking his first breakfast with the patriotic 
tailor. \

10 THE LIFE OF 

in existence until the college was dispersed, where they 
relate, that " he gave extraordinary displays of richness of 
genius and energy of mind." 

" At this time," says Colonel Troup, in a letter to a friend, 
" the general was attentive to public worship, and in the 
habit of praying on his knees night and morning. I lived 
in the same room with him for some time, and I have often 
been powerfully affected by the fervor and eloquence of his 
prayers. He had read many of the polemical writers on 
religious subjects, and he was a zealous believer in the fun- 
damental doctrines of Christianity. I confess, that the 
arguments with which he was accustomed to justify his be- 
lief, have tended in no small degree to confirm my own faith 
in revealed religion." 

This religious temperament is strongly contrasted with 
the bold and energetic character of his ambition, but they 
may be traced to a common source. The ardour of his 
feelings clothed every object of his attention with a power- 
ful interest ; and the wise instruction of his youth had taught 
him that the flame of devotion does not burn less purely 
for being kindled on the same altar with the fires of a vir- 
tuous emulation. 

A hymn, written at this time, entitled the " Soul enter- 
ing into Bliss," has been preserved, possessing not a little 
poetical merit, and strongly illustrative of the state of his 
feelings. 

This train of sentiment did not cast a melancholy shade 
over his character. Constitutionally happy, he mingled 
gaily with his friends ; and often, as Mr. Mulligan relates, 
" used to sit the evening with his family, writing doggrel 
verses for their amusement, and was always amiable and 
cheerful." Histalentfor satire was also frequently exercised. 
"John Holt," says Troup, "who then published a whig paper 
in New-York, had, by his zeal in the American cause, drawn 
upon himself the invectives of all the ministerial writers ; 



HAMILTON. 11 

these invectives Hamilton burlesqued in doggrel rhyme, 
with great wit and humour. He also presented me with 
a manuscript of fugitive poetry, which I considered as a 
strong evidence of the elasticity of his genius, and have often 
lamented that it was lost with my books and papers during 
the war." 

But the term of his youthful studies was fast approaching 
its close. The repeated invasions of the rights of the colo- 
nists, gave an impulse to the public mind, which could not 
be restrained ; and the unbounded prosperity which they 
had so long enjoyed was soon to be succeeded by the deso- 
lating scenes of civil war./ 

A brief sketch of the events which led to this result, as 
connected immediately with the province of New- York, the 
youthful theatre of Hamilton's life, must, for a short space, 
interrupt the progress of this narrative. 



CHAPTER II. 

AMONG the conflicting claims for precedence, in resist- 
ing the aggressions of the mother country, the early stand 
taken by New-York, has been in a great measure over- 
looked. 

Peculiar causes concurred to give an unusual share of 
influence to the ministerial party in that colony, and to 
render the adoption of a course of resistance the subject of 
much cautious consideration: among these, its exposed 
geographical position, diversity of population, discordance 
of religious creeds, unequal distribution of property, the pe- 
culiar tenure of the landed interest, and the limited provision 
for education, are most prominent. With these also were 
united the influence of a large expenditure and extensive 
patronage, and the fearful apprehension which the exist- 
ence of hordes of savages roaming within its limits, or 
hovering on its frontiers, necessarily kept alive. Notwith- 
standing which, the records of this colony show, that from 
the earliest period of its existence, the colonial rights were 
maintained, and usurpations resisted with a vigorous and 
determined spirit. 

During its first struggles, most of the dissensions which 
arose were usually healed by the removal of an obnoxious 
Governor, and by a temporary compliance with public feel- 
ing. But the great question of supplies which began to be 
discussed in British America at the commencement of the 
eighteenth century, continued to be a fruitful source of con- 
troversy until closed by the Revolution. 

As early as seventeen hundred and eight, the Assembly 
of New- York avowed the principle that, as freemen, their 
rights of property were unalienable, and not to be controlled 



14 THE LIFE OF 

except with their own consent ; and to the assertion of this 
First Great Principle of Representative Government and of 
Liberty, on which the whole question of the Revolution 
turned, they adhered during a period of nearly seventy 
years. The administration of Sir George Clinton, which 
preceded the war of seventeen hundred and fifty-six, had 
been unusually turbulent, and the assembly for a long time 
gave a surly compliance to his requisitions, and observed 
a watchful supervision of the civil expenditures. With a 
temper little disposed to conciliation, and unable to control 
by patronage the growing dissatisfaction, application was 
made by him to the British ministry to interpose their 
authority, which at last departed reluctantly from their 
systematic policy, and addressed a letter to the assembly 
of New-York, urging them to abandon their practice of 
annual appropriations, and to provide a civil list for a term 
of years. This unexpected interference was met with an 
angry remonstrance, and was pronounced a gross usurpa- 
tion of their colonial rights. 

The war which ensued with France diverted the atten- 
tion of the assembly from this subject ; but, within a year 
after its close we find the same colony adopting a spirited 
address in opposition to the statutes which had been re- 
cently enacted, designated under a common appellation 
as " The Acts of Trade," claiming their repeal on the same 
principle, " that the colonists could only be taxed with their 
own consent." 

This elevated tone did not proceed from these acts alone, 
the conferring upon their judges equity powers was another 
source of complaint ; but the great cause of umbrage was 
an act of parliament restricting the emission of colonial 
bills of credit. 

This expedient had been resorted to in the year seventeen 
hundred and nine. The redemption of the issues was se- 
cured by duties, and by an excise on the imports, and a 



HAMILTON. 15 

measure embraced at first from necessity, had from the same 
cause grown into a usage. The colony had emerged from 
the late war with a heavy debt, and this ill-timed restric- 
tion, connected with the commercial check produced by the 
acts of trade, threatened an almost universal bankruptcy. 

While a system of unlimited issues upon government 
credit was justly condemned, those who looked beyond the 
immediate effect of this parliamentary interference regarded 
it as part of a systematic plan to wrest from New- York the 
control of her resources, and to appropriate them to the 
purposes of a national revenue. 

The stamp act, which soon followed, dispelled all doubts 
upon this subject ; and, though the governor of New- York 
sought by repeated prorogations to prevent opposition, yet 
at their first meeting, (although the stamp act had been re- 
pealed,) the assembly renewed the declaration of their right 
" only to be taxed with their own consent." 

The repeal of these obnoxious laws seemed to have pro- 
duced at this time a general conciliation ; and the various 
legislatures were seen pouring forth grateful addresses for 
the clemency of their prince, and vying with each other in 
assurances of their loyalty. But among the mass of the 
people a new spirit had gone abroad : exultation at 
their successful resistance ; pride in the self-denial which 
had sustained them ; confidence in their righteous cause, 
and in their strength for future emergencies, were min- 
gled with that ambition which saw in the defence of colonial 
rights a loftier object of distinction than the highest favours 
which the government could confer. 

The colony of New- York was not long permitted to 
enjoy this calm ; the same year* that gave birth to the 
stamp act, produced the statute for quartering troops in 
America, subsequently called the billeting or mutiny acts, 

* December, 1765. 



10 THE LIFE OP 

and the first demand under them of provision for the 
troops was made upon the assembly of New-York. 

That body firmly resisted the demand, justly viewing it 
as an attempt to establish a standing army in America, to 
enforce the illegal exactions of parliament. 

In seventeen hundred and sixty-six, the demand was re- 
newed ; and the assembly, weary of the contest, then gave 
the first evidence of vacillation, by passing a law making 
a grant for a single year, but, at the same time, refusing a 
formal compliance with the bill, for which cause it was re- 
jected by the crown. 

A similar result occurred in the ensuing year, but before 
the intelligence of it reached England, the suspending act 
had been passed, by which all right of legislation was with- 
held, until the mutiny bill was literally carried into effect ; 
a measure concurred in by the friends of the colony in parli- 
ament, as among the most lenient which could be resorted to. 

Overawed by this bold usurpation, the assembly, at its en- 
suing session, made the grant, but studiously avoided to 
sanction the mutiny acts, and the ministry, not caring to 
press the question of their supremacy, approved it. 

The government now proceeded to consummate their 
design, and the final measures were taken of imposing a 
duty on tea, and other articles, made payable at the colo- 
nial custom houses. 

The proceeds of these duties were, at the same time, ap- 
propriated to the support of the colonial civil list, and the 
officers of the crown, appointed at its pleasure, were ren- 
dered wholly independent of the people upon whose rights 
they were to decide. 

To ensure the success of the system, a new class of offi- 
cers was created, subject to a board of trade, established 
at Boston, with full powers of search and seizure, and de- 
clared to be wholly irresponsible to the laws" of the colonies. 

This monstrous usurpation admitted of no compromise. 



HAMILTON. 17 

The provincial assemblies pronounced it arbitrary and un- 
constitutional. The rights of the colonies became the theme 
of general discussion. Public opinion soon ripened to the 
conviction, that the distinction between internal and exter- 
nal taxes was wholly chimerical. The parliamentary su- 
premacy was denied, and a concerted opposition was formed 
throughout the American continent. 

The circular letter of Massachusetts, in February,* and 
the determined resolves of Virginia in May, were re-echoed 
by the assembly of New-York, into whose councils the in- 
trepid spirit of Philip Schuyler and George Clinton had in- 
fused new vigour, and resolutions were adopted, denying 
the whole assumed power of the parliament. As in Virgi- 
nia and Massachusetts, so in New- York, these proceedings 
were punished by a dissolution of the assemblies. 

The elections which ensued, aroused all the latent feel- 
ings of the American people, and every artificial excitement 
was called in aid to secure an undivided opposition in the 
popular bodies. 

A " Journal of Occurrences " was regularly published at 
Boston, and industriously circulated, full of details of the 
insults of the soldiery, and of the arbitrary severity of the 
new commissioners of the revenue. Effigies of the minis- 
try were carried in procession, and the anniversary of the 
repeal of the stamp act was celebrated in all parts of the 
country, with deep interest and studious pomp. 

During these stirring events, the government party in 
New-York had not been inactive, and though the assembly 
still concurred in opposition to the laws which most infla- 
med the people, a majority was found sufficiently servile to 
re-enact the mutiny bill, and to defeat a proposition autho- 
rizing the vote by ballot, a measure to which the patriots 
had looked with the utmost anxiety. An incident occurred 
at this time, which gave a new character to the opening

18 THE LIFE OF 

drama ; and to the firmness of one individual, may, in a 
great measure, be attributed the rapid growth of that popu- 
lar excitement, which ultimately overcame the influence of 
the ministerial party. 

While the grant to the troops was under discussion be- 
fore the assembly, an address, under the title of a " Son of 
Liberty to the betrayed Inhabitants of the Colony of New- 
York," issued from the press,* in which the conduct of that 
body as contrasted with that of their predecessors, and of 
South Carolina and Massachusetts, was severely censured, 
and the subserviency of the majority held up to merited 
indignation. 

This bold rebuke was laid before the house by its speak- 
er,! an( J a resolution was adopted, declaring it to be " an 
infamous and seditious libel." On a division of a full 
house upon this question, Philip Schuyler stood alone in the 
negative. A proclamation followed for the discovery of 
the author, and Captain Alexander McDougal, to whom it 
was traced, was seized by order of the governor, and com- 
mitted to prison. When arrested, he declared, " I rejoice 
that I am the first sufferer for liberty since the commence- 
ment of our- glorious struggles." The effect of this pro- 
ceeding was electric. Public meetings were called to vin- 
dicate his opinions, and from being a martyr he became 
the idol of the patriots.J 

In this excited state of feeling, trifling occurrences be- 
came of moment. The liberty pole erected by the people 
in commemoration of the repeal of the stamp act, was cut 
down by the garrison, a second was erected, and again 

* December 16, 1769. f December 19, 1769. 

J The Chief Justice, before whom he was taken on a bench warrant, said 
to him, " Well, you have brought yourself into a pretty scrape." " That," he 
replied, " must be judged of by my peers." " There is full proof you are the 
author of an infamous and seditious libel." " This must also be tried by my 
peers." 



HAMILTON. 10 

cut down : a general meeting of the citizens was then 
convened, and after denouncing the soldiers as enemies to 
the people, a new liberty staff, clamped with iron, was ele- 
vated amid the shouts of the populace, which defied further 
violence, and long stood an emblem of their opposition. 

The excitement which had been thus aroused, did not 
soon subside. A strife arose between the civil and military 
authorities ; daily rencontres with the soldiers ensued ; 
acts of violence soon followed ; a serious riot occurred ; 
and a breach was now opened not to be healed. In the 
midst of these scenes, intelligence was received of the mas- 
sacre at Boston of the fifth of March, an event which, 
more than any other, accelerated the revolution. 

During this period, McDougal, undismayed by his situa- 
tion, poured forth from his prison continual appeals to the 
people, teeming with scornful reproaches of his oppressors, 
and the boldest avowals of revolutionary sentiments. The 
cause of McDougal soon became the cause of every liberal 
mind. To soften the rigours of his confinement, to evince 
by every attention a detestation of its authors, and, in his 
person, to plead the cause of liberty, became an act of con- 
spicuous patriotism. Ladies of the first distinction throng- 
ed to his prison. The character of every individual enga- 
ged in the controversy, became the subject of comment, 
and the applause which attended the name of Schuyler, 
gave a new value to the popularity which his firmness in 
the legislature had acquired. 

McDougal was a man born among the people, and at a 
time when aristocratic feelings were prevalent, the im- 
portance attached to an individual of obscure birth, elevated 
the commonalty above all artificial distinctions, and com- 
mended to the aspiring spirits of the day, the lesson of re- 
sistance. 

The servile agents of government added new causes of 
dissatisfaction. After an imprisonment of three months, a 



20 THE LIFE OF 

grand jury was packed, composed of the dependants of the 
governor. The government press was full of addresses, 
urging his conviction. The speaker, and other official per- 
sons, took their seats with the court, and, yielding to this 
corrupt influence, an indictment was found against him. 
At the ensuing session of the assembly,* he was brought 
before the bar of the house, and although he had already in- 
curred the penalty of the law, on a refusal to ask pardon, 
he was again imprisoned : a leading member proposing 
that the infliction of peine forte et dure should be imposed 
to extort a humiliating recantation from his lips. But his 
spirit was too firm to be intimidated, and to this brutal 
threat, he replied, " That rather than resign the rights and 
privileges of a British subject, he would suffer his right hand 
to be cut off at the bar of the house." 

Baffled in their attempt to levy a duty on tea, through 
the ordinary channels of commerce, the ministry next re- 
sorted to the expedient of introducing it through the agency 
of the East India Company. On information of this pro- 
ject^ the press teemed with addresses, exhorting to resist- 
ance. An association was formed, which denounced all 
aiders and abettors in the introduction of this article, as 
enemies to the liberties of America; and public opinion, more 
powerful than the laws, lent its aid to enforce decrees which 
required no other sanction. 

On the arrival of the first cargo, the governor proposed 
as a compromise, that it should be landed at the fort ; but 
the citizens resolutely refused, and, influenced by the patri- 
otic example of Boston, threw it into the bay. The re- 
maining cargo was then removed from the harbour, and 
the day of its departure was celebrated with tumultuous 
rejoicings.J

J April 18, 1774, the Nancy, tea ship, Captain Lockyer, arrived. Applica- 
tion was made to the city committee to land. A sloop with a body of men was

HAMILTON. 21 

The infatuated ministry now determined to resort to 
compulsion ; and the first fruit of their policy was, a bill to 
close the port of Boston, a measure bearing on its fea- 
tures every mark of tyranny. 

The whole continent saw in this step the fate to which 
they were doomed ; and the proposition to hold a general 
congress became the favourite topic of discussion, and 
seemed to open the only prospect of relief. 

The election of the New-York delegates to this congress 
was not free from difficulty. The committee of the assem- 
bly appointed to sit in its recess, and which was raised ex- 
pressly to paralyze the opposition, claimed the right of 
nomination, and their claim was enforced by many of the 
merchants, and by all the dependants of the crown. 

The only course which remained was, to wrest the 
choice from this body, and submit it to the people at large. 
Parties immediately formed on this ground, and for some 
time it was doubtful which had the preponderance. After 
various preparatory measures, a general assemblage of the 
citizens was determined upon, and on the sixth of July 
seventeen hundred and seventy-four, a large concourse met, 
long remembered as " the great meeting in the fields." 

The measures of this meeting were of the deepest mo- 
ment. The more cautious policy of the committee of cor- 
respondence had not kept pace with the feelings of the 
people at large, nor with those of their more ardent lead- 
ers ; and it was determiued by a decisive act to take a 
position from which the colony could not recede. 

To add to the solemnity of the occasion, the persecuted 
McDougal was invited to preside, and resolutions framed 

despatched to watch the vessel at Sandy Hook. April 22, Captain Chambers 
arrived with a small adventure of tea ; a number of people at 8 P. M. took out 
the tea, and started it into the sea, persons of reputation superintending it. 
At 10 the people dispersed quietly, and on the succeeding day the bells rang, 
and a large meeting was held at the liberty pole. 



22 THE LIFE OF 

by him were adopted, inveighing against the Boston Port 
Act ; exhorting the contemplated congress to prohibit all 
commercial intercourse with Great Britain ; pledging the 
colony to be governed by its resolutions, and recommend- 
ing the important and definitive measure of an election by 
the several counties of deputies to a colonial convention, 
for the express purpose of choosing delegates to the gene- 
ral congress ; with a request that if any of the counties 
considered this mode impracticable or inexpedient, that 
they should give their approbation to the deputies chosen 
in the city of New- York a suggestion which was adopted. 

It was on this interesting occasion that Hamilton, then 
seventeen years of age, first took part in the public delibe- 
rations. 

y^lt has been related to have been his habit to walk seve- 
ral hours each day under the shade of some large trees 
which stood in Batteau, now Dey-street, talking to himself 
in an under tone of voice, apparently engaged in deep 
thought, a practice which he continued through life. 

This circumstance attracted the attention of his neigh- 
bours, to whom he was known as the " young West In- 
dian," and led them to engage in conversation with him. 
One of them remarking the vigour and maturity of his 
thoughts, urged him to address this meeting, to which all 
the patriots were looking with the greatest interest. 

From this seeming intrusion, he at first recoiled ; but, 
after listening attentively to the successive speakers, and 
finding several points untouched, he presented himself to 
the assembled multitude. 

The novelty of the attempt, his youthful countenance, his 
slender and diminutive form, awakened curiosity and ar- 
rested attention. Overawed by the scene before him, he 
at first hesitated and faltered ; but as he proceeded almost 
unconsciously to utter his accustomed reflections, his mind 
wanned with the theme, his energies were recovered ; and, 



HAMILTON. 23 

after a discussion clear, cogent, and novel, of the great 
principles involved in the controversy, he depicted in 
glowing colours the long continued and long endured op- 
pressions okthe mother country ; he insisted on the duty 
of resistance, pointed to the means and certainty of success, 
and described the waves of rebellion sparkling with fire, 
and washing back on the shores of England the wrecks of 
her power, her wealth, and her glory. The breathless 
silence ceased as he closed ; and the whispered murmur, 
" it is a collegian ! it is a collegian !" was lost in loud ex- 
pressions of wonder and applause at the extraordinary 
eloquence of the young stranger. / 



CHAPTER III. 

/ THE enthusiasm which led Hamilton to appear thus 
early before the public had been kindled by a visit to Bos- 
ton, a short time after the destruction of the tea. 

He found the public mind in that place in the utmost 
agitation. Excited by the high tone which prevailed there, 
his attention was directed to the leading topics of this great 
controversy. He had previously formed and entertained, 
as he himself relates, " strong prejudices on the ministerial 
side, until he became convinced by the superior force of the 
arguments in favour of the colonial claims." On his re- 
turn to New- York, he enlisted warmly on the side of Ame- 
rica, and gave this early and public pledge of his devotion 
to her cause. A short time only elapsed before he hastened 
to redeem it./ 

The elections held for the choice of delegates to the ge- 
neral congress, which met at Philadelphia in September, 
seventeen hundred and seventy-four, had given such strong 
indications of the growth of popular sentiments in the colony 
of New-York, that the government party became exceed- 
ingly embarrassed. But unwilling to retire from the con- 
test without a further effort, they resolved to endeavour by 
a combined series of publications to check the progress of 
revolutionary opinions. 

This office of loyalty was undertaken by the gentlemen 
composing the episcopal clergy, a body who, looking to 
the monarch as the head both of the church and state, 
regarded with horror every attempt to impair the royal 
prerogative, had long been conspicuous as its most zea- 
lous supporters, and who being accomplished scholars and 

VOL. i. 4 



26 THELIFEOF 

able writers, entered the lists of controversy with unhesi- 
tating confidence. 

Of these, Dr. Myles Cooper, the president of Kings Col- 
lege, an Englishman by birth, held the first rank. Among 
the other clerical gentlemen, Doctor Inglis, the father of 
the present Bishop of Nova Scotia ; Seabury, subsequently 
Bishop of Connecticut ; Doctor Samuel Chandler, and Mr. 
Isaac Wilkins of Westchester, afterwards the Reverend 
Doctor Wilkins, were the most prominent. 

Of the champions for the colonies, Governor Livingston 
of New-Jersey, a gentleman who to the purest and most in- 
trepid patriotism united great sagacity, refined manners, 
and a highly cultivated taste, and his son-in-law, Mr. Jay, 
were the most conspicuous. To these was now to be 
added the name of Hamilton. On his return from Boston 
he had published a Defence of the Destruction of the Tea, 
and had kept up in the columns of Holt's paper* a spirited 
attack upon the measures of the ministry, in which he was 
found breaking a lance with his master, Doctor Cooper. A 
more important controversy now awaited him. 

Within a short time after the adjournment of the first 
congress, among several publications, two tracts appeared 
more distinguished than the rest, which were the joint pro- 
ductions of Doctor Seabury and Mr. Wilkins, the latter of 
whom had recently occupied a prominent place in the de- 
liberations of the New- York assembly. The first bore the 
title of " Free Thoughts on the Proceedings of the Conti- 
nental Congress," the other was entitled " Congress Can- 
vassed, by a Westchester Farmer."f 

These publications were chiefly directed against the

he makes." 

t November 24, 1774. 



HAMILTON. 27 

"non-importation, non-consumption, and non-exportation 
agreements," which had been recommended by the con- 
gress. 

In the first, the writer with much art, endeavours to im- 
press the minds of the colonists with the dangers of restric- 
tive measures ; to excite the jealousy of the farmers against 
the merchants, alleging that the whole object was to en- 
gross a monopoly of goods ; anticipates, as the probable 
consequence, the closing of the port, and the suspension of 
justice, and remarks, with great ingenuity, on the inconsis- 
tency of a congress, which, pretending to protect the liber- 
ties of the people, had sanctioned the invasion of every 
private right, and recommended inquisitorial powers to the 
committees, to enforce their worse than fruitless agree- 
ments ; artfully directing the attention of the people to the 
assembly of the province, as the only legitimate and ade- 
quate medium of redress. 

In the second address, the illegality of the recent elec- 
tions is strongly urged ; the appropriation of the proceeds 
of goods sold for the infraction of the restrictive associa- 
tions to the use of the people of Boston, is condemned as a 
violation of all the rights of property ; the danger of ter- 
ritorial encroachments is strongly depicted ; and displaying 
in full array the omnipotence of England, the chimera of a 
commonwealth of congresses being able to cope with the 
vigour of the monarchy, is powerfully ridiculed. 

The wide, industrious, and gratuitous circulation of these 
pamphlets, inducing the belief that they had the sanction 
of the government, they soon became the text book of the 
tories, and were applauded by them as containing irrefuta- 
ble arguments against the measures of the " sons of liberty." 

The zeal with which they were extolled by the friends 
of government, invited the loudest condemnations of the 
popular party. 

They were believed to have been the productions of a 



28 THE LIFE OF 

clergyman of the church of England, who had been con- 
spicuous in the support of the ministry. This circumstance 
was connected in the public mind with the recollection of 
the course adopted by the spiritual lords in parliament, and 
new feelings of quickened asperity were aroused. The 
efforts to introduce an episcopacy into America were re- 
curred to, and the abject devotion displayed by some of the 
clerical dependants of the crown, and their unguarded 
avowal of their sentiments, increased the odium. 

In the journal of the whigs, (as they were then called,) 
the zealots of the day proposed that the author and pub- 
lisher should be indicted for treasonable designs ; and in a 
neighbouring colony the exasperation rose so high, that, at 
a meeting of the county, the pamphlets were tarred and 
feathered, and nailed to the pillory, amid the shouts of the 
people. Within a fortnight after the second tract had is- 
sued from the press,* a pamphlet appeared under the title of 
" A Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress from the 
Calumnies of their Enemies, in answer to a Letter under 
the signature of A W. Farmer ; whereby his sophistry is 
exposed, his cavils confuted, his artifices detected, and his 
wit ridiculed, in a General Address to the Inhabitants of 
America, and a Particular Address to the Farmers of the 
Province of New-York. Veritas magna est et praevalebit. 
Truth is powerful, and will prevail. New-York. Printed 
by James Rivington. 1774." 

After a just tribute to that distinguished body, of which 
he says, " distinguished, whether we consider the charac- 
ters of the men who composed it, the number and dignity 
of their constituents, or the important ends for which they 
were appointed," the writer, in the outset, meets the 
question of the supremacy of parliament, and pointing out 
Ihe distinction between freedom and slavery, contends that

HAMILTON. 29 

representation is essential to the validity of every tax ; jus- 
tifies the measures of congress, as proceeding from neces- 
sity, and shows the utter inefficacy of petitions and remon- 
strances, as evinced by their repeated failure. "When 
the political salvation," he says, "of any community is 
depending, it is incumbent upon those who are set up as its 
guardians, to embrace such measures as have justice, vi- 
gour, and a probability of success to recommend them. 
If, instead of this, they take those measures which are 
themselves feeble and little likely to succeed, and may, 
through a defect of vigour, involve the community in still 
greater danger, they may justly be considered its betrayers. 
It is not enough, in times of imminent peril, to use only 
possible means of preservation. Justice and sound policy, 
dictate the use. of probable means." " We can have no 
resource but in a restriction of our trade, or a resistance 
vi et armis." 

He next proceeds to vindicate the policy of congress, and 
to defend the principle of the restrictive measures, then 
much contested. 

In reply to the argument as to the impoverishing effects 
of these measures, he urges, as a necessary consequence, 
the encouragement of manufactures, and the benefits of 
emigration, which would be induced by the loss of the 
American market, and the "rapid growth of domestic re- 
sources, which would place the country beyond the capri- 
ces of foreign powers." " If, by the necessity of the thing," 
he says, "manufactures should once be established and take 
root among us, they will pave the way, still more, to the 
future grandeur and glory of America, and by lessening its 
need of external commerce, will render it still securer 
against the encroachments of tyranny." 

Deriving arguments from his knowledge of the West 
Indies, he illustrates, in a close detail of consequences, the 
efficacy of those measures, in inducing their concurrence, 



30 THE LIFE OF 

and by affecting their interests and those of the other parts 
of the empire, " would rouse them from their neutrality, and 
engage them in a common opposition to the lawless hand 
of tyranny, which is extended to ravage our liberty from 
us, and might soon be extended for the same purpose to 
them." In answer to the alarm which had been sounded 
as to the blockade of the port, he shows the impracticabi- 
lity of a permanent embargo, which, if persisted in, would 
produce a permanent severance of the empire. 

Having controverted the general arguments of his oppo- 
nents, the writer proceeds to address the farmers as a class, 
and says, " I do not address you in particular, because I 
have any greater connexion with you than with other peo- 
ple. / despise all false pretensions and mean arts. Let 
those have recourse to dissimulation, who cannot defend 
their cause without it. 'Tis my maxim to let the plain na- 
ked truth speak for itself." " 'Tis the farmer who is most 
oppressed in all countries where slavery exists." After a 
rapid sketch of the grievous burthens of England, he inquires 
why, if the principle is once admitted, such consequences 
should not follow, and asks what limit there is to taxation ? 

He then displays, in glowing colours, the injustice of the 
Boston port bill, and directs the confidence of the colonists 
to the wisdom of congress to redress their grievances ; and 
after lauding the discretion of that body, which, while it 
restricts the commerce of the country, continues to petition, 
he closes his summary of their injuries, with the exclama- 
tion, the farmer cries "tell me not of delegates, congresses, 
committees, mobs, riots, insurrections, and associations, 
a plague on them all ! Give me the steady, uniform, un- 
biassed influence of the courts of justice. I have been 
happy under their protection, I shall be so again." 

" I say, tell me not of the British commons, lords, minis- 
try, ministerial tools, placemen, pensioners, parasites, I 
scorn to let my life and property depend upon the pleasure

of any of them. Give me the steady, uniform, unshaken 
security of constitutional freedom. Give me the right of 
trial by a jury of my own neighbours, and to be taxed by 
my own representatives only. What will become of the 
law and courts of justice without this? The shadow may 
remain, but the substance will be gone. I would die to 
preserve the law upon a solid foundation ; but take away 
liberty, and the foundation is destroyed." 

A short time after,* a reply followed, entitled " A View 
of the Controversy, by a Westchester Farmer," marked 
with still greater asperity than the former, and pressing its 
object with new arguments. The inertness of the colony 
is shown, to prove the narrow circle of factious principles ; 
the right of legislation in the colonies is denied, on infer- 
ences drawn from the tenor of the colonial charters ; the 
effect of an embargo, to sever from them their English 
friends, is alleged ; the dangers of a civil war strongly 
deprecated, and a remedy proposed of vesting in parlia- 
ment the enactment of general laws, reserving to the legis- 
latures the mere right of taxation. 

Within a month,! this paper was followed by a more 
elaborate answer, of seventy-eight pages, entitled " The 
Farmer Refuted ; or a more Comprehensive and Impartial 
View of the Disputes between Great Britain and the Co- 
lonies, intended as a Further Vindication of the Congress, 
in answer to a Letter from A W. Farmer, entitled A View

the measures of the congress as tending to resolve society 
into its elementary principles, and reduce it to a state of 
nature. His " Refuter" compares his idea of a state of 
nature with that of Hobbes, " that moral obligation is con- 
ventional, and virtue purely artificial ;" and sarcastically 
implies in him a similar sentiment, denying the exist- 
ence and supremacy of a Deity. " For," he says, " to 
grant that there is a Supreme Intelligence who rules the 
world, and has established laws to regulate the actions 
of his creatures, and still to assert that men are in a state 
of nature, may be considered as perfectly free from all 
restraints of law and government, appear to a common 
understanding altogether irreconcilable." He then gives 
a just and philosophical definition of " natural rights," and 
deduces from them the rights of the colonies, in contra- 
distinction to the rights of parliament assuming the 
position, that the principle of colonial connexion is by 
grant from the crown, he distinguishes between the alle- 
giance due to a common sovereign, and the authority of the 
commons, which is commensurate only with the sphere of 
their election ; and admitting the incidental power of par- 
liament over the colonies as derived from their consent, 
he shows that the extent of that consent is the only just 
measure of their authority, and the true principles of free 
government implying a share in legislation : " You are 
mistaken," he says, " when you confine arbitrary govern- 
ment to a monarchy. It is not the supreme power being 
placed in one, instead of many, that discriminates an 
arbitrary from a free government. When any people 
are ruled by laws in framing which they have no part, 
that are to bind them to all intents and purposes, with- 
out in the same manner binding the legislature them- 
selves, they are in the strictest sense slaves, and the go- 
vernment with respect to them is despotic ; and hence the 
authority of parliament over the colonies would in all pro- 



HAMILTON. 33 

bility be a more intolerable and excessive species of despo- 
tism than the most absolute monarchy, as the temptation to 
abuse would be greater. He contends that the right of co- 
lonial legislation is an inherent right, " and that the foun- 
dation of the English constitution rests upon the principle, 
that laws have no validity without the consent of the peo- 
ple; " "natural liberty is a gift of the beneficent Creator to 
the whole human race ; civil liberty is founded on it ; civil 
liberty is only natural liberty, modified and secured by civil 
society." In answer to the inferences, from the charters, he 
proceeds to take a survey of the political history of the co- 
lonies, and proves from the terms of the charters that the 
idea of parliamentary supremacy is excluded, and an express 
exemption reserved from duties on exports and imports : 
and in confirmation of the sense of the crown on this ques- 
tion, he adverts to the historical facts, that when a bill to 
give to British subjects the privilege of fishing on the Ame- 
rican coast was introduced into the house of commons, it 
was announced from the throne " that America was not 
annexed to the realm, and that it was not fitting that parli- 
ament should make laws for those countries." And, that in 
a succeeding reign the royal assent was refused to a simi- 
lar bill, on the ground " that the colonies were out of the 
realm and jurisdiction of parliament ;" that on the passage 
of the first act to impose duties, it was opposed in Virginia, 
and, to satisfy that high spirited colony, a declaration was 
given under the privy seal, " that taxes ought not to be laid 
without the consent of the general assembly." Canvassing 
carefully each successive charter, he shows, that the com- 
mon principle extends through them all, and that a different 
doctrine is contrary "to the sacred rights of mankind, which 
are not to be rummaged for among old parchments, or 
musty records : they are written, as with a sunbeam, in 
the whole volume of human nature, by the hand of the 
VOL. i. 5

Divinity itself, and can never be erased or obscured by 
mortal power." 

Having closed the argument against the authority of 
parliament, as founded either on the British constitution, the 
natural rights of man, or the several charters of the colony, 
he admits their right to regulate trade, but as a right con- 
ceded to them by the colonies, and only to be exercised on 
principles which induced the concession, common to all 
the subjects of the realm. 

Pursuing the argument of his adversary, he again vindi- 
cates the proceedings of congress ; and after reciting the 
successive acts of usurpation, and the inefficacy of petitions, 
from the fact that parliament had never abandoned the 
right of taxation, remarks, that the violence of the minis- 
try demanded the adoption of efficacious measures as our 
only security :" and after eloquently picturing the blockade 
of Boston, which led to the convention of congress, he thus 
replies to its alleged illegality : " When the first princi- 
ples of civil society are violated, and the rights of a whole 
people are invaded, the common forms of municipal law are 
not to be regarded. Men may then betake themselves to 
the law of nature ; and if they but conform their actions 
to that standard, all cavils against them betray either igno- 
rance or dishonesty. There are some events in society to 
which human laws cannot extend ; but when applied to 
them, lose all their force and efficacy. In short, when hu- 
man la\vs contradict or discountenance the means which 
are necessary to preserve the essential rights of any society, 
they defeat the proper end of all laws, and so become null 
and void." 

Having given an able sketch of the commercial relations 
of the two countries, he shows our means of self-depend- 
ence, and confuting his antagonist, who had ridiculed the 
impotence of our resistance, meets him on the broad ground 
of arms and independence : confidently affirms our ability 



HAMILTON. 35 

to support our freedom, and by a system of protracted war- 
fare, with the aid of foreign succour, to weary out the 
mother country, and exhaust her strength. 

The following extracts show how far at this early age 
he anticipated our future resources : " With respect to 
cotton, you do not pretend to deny that a sufficient quan- 
tity of that may be produced. Several of the southern co- 
lonies are so favourable to it, that, with due cultivation, in 
a couple of years they would afford enough to clothe the 
whole continent. As to the expense of bringing it by land, 
the best way will be to manufacture it where it grows, 
and afterwards transport it to the other colonies. Upon 
this plan, I apprehend, the expense would not be greater 
than to build and equip large ships to import the manufac- 
tures of Great Britain from thence. If we were to turn 
our attention from external to internal commerce, we would 
give greater stability and more lasting prosperity to our 
country than she can possibly have otherwise. We should 
not then import the vices and luxuries of foreign climes, 
nor should we make hasty strides to public corruption and 
depravity. Those obstacles which to the eye of timidity 
and apprehension appear like the Alps, to the hand of re- 
solution and perseverance become mere hillocks." In re- 
ference to the mode of conducting the war, he remarks : 
" Let it be remembered there are no large plains for the 
two armies to meet in and decide the contest by some de- 
cisive stroke, where any advantage gained by either side 
must be prosecuted, till a complete victory is obtained. 
The circumstances of our country put it in our power to 
evade a pitched battle. It will be better policy to harass 
and exhaust the soldiery by frequent skirmishes and incur- 
sions, than to take the open field with them, by which means 
they would have the full benefit of their superior regularity 
and skill. Americans are better qualified for that kind of 
fighting, which is most adapted to the country, than regu- 



36 THELIFEOF 

lar troops : should the soldiery advance into the country, as 
they would be obliged to do, if they had any inclination to 
subdue us, their discipline would be of little use to them. 
Whatever may be said of the disciplined troops of Britain, 
the event of the contest must be extremely doubtful. There 
is a certain enthusiasm in liberty, that makes human nature 
rise above itself in acts of bravery and heroism." Speak- 
ing of foreign succour, he observes : " The most that can 
be expected from France, Spain, and Holland, is, that they 
would refrain from an open rupture with Great Britain. 
They would undoubtedly take every clandestine method to 
introduce among us supplies of those things which we stood 
in need of, to carry on the dispute. They would not ne- 
glect any thing in their power to make the opposition on 
our part as vigorous and obstinate as our affairs would ad- 
mit of. But it seems to me a mark of great credulity to be- 
lieve, upon the strength of their assurance, that France and 
Spain would not take a still more interesting part in the 
affair. The disjunction of these colonies from Britain, and 
the acquisition of a free trade with them, are objects of too. 
inviting a complexion to suffer those kingdoms to remain 
idle spectators of the contention. If they found us inclined 
to throw ourselves upon their protection, they would ea- 
gerly embrace the opportunity to weaken their antagonist, 
and strengthen themselves. Superadded to these general 
and prevailing inducements, there are others of a more 
particular nature. They would feel no small inconvenience 
in the loss of those supplies they annually get from us, and 
their islands w r ould be in the greatest distress for the want 
of our trade. From these reflections it is more than pro- 
bable, that America is able to support its freedom, even by 
the force of arms, if she be not betrayed by her own sons." 
The firm and confident temper manifested in these pam- 
phlets, gave them a most rapid and extensive popularity. 
They were immediately appealed to by the whigs, as tri- 



HAMILTON. 37 

umphant defences of their opinions and conduct, and curio- 
sity was alive to discover their author. They were gene- 
rally attributed to Governor Livingston and to Mr. Jay, 
and these distinguished men gained from them, for a time, 
increased celebrity ; but when, on the inquiry to which of 
these two individuals the public were indebted for this 
great service, the author was ascertained to be Alexander 
Hamilton, a youth about eighteen, but recently admitted to 
college, and new to the country, admiration of the works 
was lost in surprise at the discovery. By many it was 
doubted. " I remember," says Colonel Troup, " that in a 
conversation I once had with Doctor Cooper about the an- 
swer, he insisted that Mr. Jay must be the author of it, it 
being absurd to imagine that so young a man as Hamilton 
could have written it ;" and the positive assertions of Troup 
and Mulligan, to whom parts of it had been read in the 
progress of composition, seemed hardly sufficient to dispel 
the doubt.* 

Signal distinction followed the disclosure. Hamilton 
was at once regarded as a prodigy of intellect : anxious 
inquiries poured in from the other colonies. " Sir," said 
the gallant Willet, " Sears was a warm man, but with little 
reflection ; McDougal was strong-minded, and Jay appear- 
ing to fall in with the measures of Sears, tempered and 
controlled them ; but Hamilton, after these great writings, 
became our oracle ;" and from being known in New-York 
as the eloquent collegian, he was distinguished in the pub- 
lic press by the appellation of "The Vindicator of .Con- 
gress." 

When the vigour and terseness of style, the mass of in- 

* The importance of gaining such an adversary, was felt by the friends of 
the crown ; and it is related by a cotemporary of his, now living, that a most 
liberal offer was tendered to Hamilton by Dr. Cooper, if he would consent to 
write in behalf of the ministry. It is unnecessary to add, that it was rejected.

formation, the closeness of reasoning, the happy exposition 
of the weak points of his antagonist, the clear perception 
of the principles of political liberty which the American 
revolution has rendered familiar, and chiefly the compre- 
hensive and prophetic view which is taken of the great 
questions then discussed, and which involved not less the 
destinies of the British empire, than of all others, are con- 
sidered, these pamphlets will be admitted to possess merits 
of which the most practised statesman might be proud, and 
when regarded as the productions of such a youth, are un- 
rivalled. 

The latter of these publications appeared in February, 
seventeen hundred and seventy-five, at that gloomy period of 
suspense when every eye was directed to England, waiting 
the result of the proceedings of the late congress, and when 
not a ray of relief broke upon the view. The rejection of 
Lord Chatham's conciliatory bill, which was soon after 
known, dissipated every remaining hope of peaceable re- 
dress. 

In New-York, the ministerial party maintained their as- 
cendency in the assembly, although not without a severe 
and persevering conflict. Not daring longer to defend the 
measures of the ministry, they sought by holding out the 
prospect of a favourable answer to their petitions, and by 
assuring to their constituents a special exemption from the 
common calamity, to quiet the minds and paralyze the 
efforts of the people. The opposition in this body was still 
led by two men of the most determined resolution, Phi- 
lip Schuyler and George Clinton, who, together with 
John Jay, were the leading patriots of New- York ; and 
when the importance of the concurrence of this province, 
and the embarrassments with which it was surrounded, are 
taken into view, contending, at the same time, with the 
whole influence of the ministry, with the power of the co- 



HAMILTON. 39 

lonial government, adroitly exercised, with a large body of 
its wealthy proprietors actively co-operating with the timid 
portion of the mercantile community, amid a divided popu- 
lation and distracted councils, it is difficult to measure the 
value of their services. 

The first of these, Colonel Schuyler, had been a partizan 
officer in the war of seventeen hundred and fifty-six. By 
his fertility of resource and unyielding energy, he rendered 
distinguished services to the British commander,* who fell, 
lamented, by his side, and to him the honour of his inter- 
ment was confided. Descended from one of the early 
Dutch settlers of this province, the influence and respecta- 
bility of whose family had been transmitted through suc- 
cessive generations, he exercised an almost unrivalled sway 
over the minds of the descendants of a people, whose first 
mention in history, as a distinct political community, is as- 
sociated with the assertion of their liberties. 

Possessed of great wealth, he embarked it in the contest, 
as a pledge of his patriotism, and, in the course of the re- 
volution, sacrificed as much of fortune and of feeling, as any 
other individual in America. 

Party to the most secret councils of the continent, he had 
staked every thing on the issue of the conflict, and had ac- 
quired a weight of influence which led both Virginia and 
Massachusetts to regard him as the connecting link in the 
great purposes at which they aimed. " On the shoulders 
of this great man," said Judge Benson, " the conduct of 
New- York rested." 

His love of fame was less than his love of country ; and 
when the misadventures of sonie robbed him of the glory 
to which he was entitled, and while artifice withheld from 
him an opportunity of vindication, he is not seen indulging 

in invidious comments on the successes of others, but con-

tinuing within the sphere of his great influence and resour- 
ces, to advance the cause of his early preference. Thus, 
his strength of character sustained him when other men 
sink, and his adversity gave him more true honour than he 
could have derived from success.* Sullied by no private 
vices, and misled by no small passions, his path through life 
was high, unspotted, equal ; and he died with a reputation, 
which those who knew and followed him, have contended 
to perpetuate. 

Sprung from a family of Irish descent, which counted 
among their ancestry a gallant officer of the cavaliers who 
fell with Charles the First, George Clinton, in a nobler 
cause, displayed all the perseverance and courage of his 
blood. 

In early youth he broke from the thrall of parental au- 
thority, and exchanged for his father's house, a birth on 
board of a privateer, in which he made a cruise during the 
French war. He is next seen in service with his father 
and brother, in an attack which resulted in the capture of 
Frontignac. He then became a lawyer, and was placed 
soon after in that sphere in which he was the associate 
of Schuyler, in opposition to the. influence of the crown. 
Transferred by the popular choice to the continental con- 
gress, he took part in the measures of 1775 and 1776, and 
on the formation of the constitution of the state of New- 
York, was chosen its governor, and filled that station during 
a period of eighteen years. On the first call to arms, he 
was appointed a brigadier general, and during the most 
trying years of the war commanded in the Highlands, 
and held the keys of that natural citadel. In intrepidity, 

* " I hope," said Mr. Jay, " you will seriously determine to serve your 
country, at least in a legislative capacity. Class yourself with those great men 
of antiquity, who, unmoved by the ingratitude of their country, omitted no op- 
portunities of promoting the public weal." 12th February, 1778. 



HAMILTON. 41 

perseverance, and love of liberty, he was not less distin- 
guished than his great compatriot ; but in the modes of at- 
taining their objects, and in their political views, they were 
most unlike. By Schuyler, the declaration of independ- 
ence was regarded but as the first step toward the creation 
of a great nation, pledged to the principles which that in- 
strument proclaimed. With Clinton, the love of liberty 
was a fiercer passion. 

In Schuyler, it was a principle of high benevolence, en- 
larging with the sphere of action. With Clinton, it was a 
jealousy of power, contracting and deforming the object of 
his adoration. The one, conscious of his own imperfec- 
tions, regarded mankind with a kindred feeling, as full of 
weaknesses from which they were to be protected. The 
other, with a profound knowledge of human nature, and 
consummate talents for popularity, looked more to the pas- 
sions of men, as a field from which could be gathered a 
store of influence for his own advancement. The one aided 
in building up the constitution of the United States on the 
basis of a firm and perpetual union. The other, had he 
prevailed, would have doomed them to perpetual anarchy. 

John Jay, younger than either, was educated for the bar, 
and had already acquired celebrity in his profession. His 
father, the descendant of a persecuted Hugonot, establish- 
ed himself in the vicinity of New-Rochelle, where, sur- 
rounded by a small community who traced their origin and 
their adversities to the same source, he pursued an agricul- 
tural life, and preserved all the simplicity of habits and pu- 
rity of character, which had been cultivated by the protes- 
tants in France, amid the various vicissitudes of their for- 
tunes. Educated in such a school, he espoused the cause 
of liberty, with an ardour equal to the zeal with which he 
defended it, and soon acquired the ascendency, to which 
his probity, and the soundness of his understanding, enti- 
tled him.

By some, his jealousy of error was supposed to have run 
into a proneness to suspicion ; and his strict adherence to 
right, to have bordered on severity ; but the basis of his 
character was a lofty virtue and manly self-dependence. 
Elevated by these qualities in the public confidence, he rose 
to some of the highest stations in the civil branch of the 
government, and long shone conspicuous among the great 
lights which ushered this nation into existence, a pure, 
consistent, and unyielding patriot. 

Sustained by the ardent feelings of the other colonies, the 
exertions of these men to secure the concert of the go- 
vernment of New- York were unremitting, but vain. The 
majority of the assembly would not be diverted from their 
servile counsels, and although their efforts towards concilia- 
tion had been treated by the ministry with contumely and 
neglect, they still refused their sanction to those commercial 
restrictions which the congress had recommended, and a 
motion to appoint delegates to the second congress, was 
negatived by a majority of two to one. 

To counteract this influence, the popular committees in- 
creased their numbers and their activity, and taking advan- 
tage of every violation of the associations, kept alive the 
spirit of their partizans by glowing appeals to their love of 
country. All expectation of obtaining the concurrence of 
the assembly being at last abandoned, on the fifth day of 
March, seventeen hundred and seventy-five, a meeting of 
the citizens of New- York was convened, in order to obtain 
a representation in the approaching congress. The minis- 
terial party determined to put down this attempt, and as 
soon as the patriots assembled, resorted to violence. The 
popular party was surprised and defeated, but soon rallied, 
and having collected arms, routed their antagonists. The 
victory was decisive.* The election of delegates to a pro-

vincial convention was held, and the concurrence of New- 
York ultimately secured. 

This body met in the ensuing month, and even in that 
assemblage was found much of the timidity which had 
characterized the representatives they were chosen to suc- 
ceed. While they recommended to their constituents to 
exercise themselves with arms, they still indulged the de- 
lusive hope of redress. Day after day, in the earlier part 
of their session, they remonstrated against the incursions 
into Canada, and finally* adopted a plan of accommodation 
with the ministry.f But the battle of Lexington had been 
fought ; the war cry was raised, and the American people 
were convinced that nothing remained to them but an ap- 
peal to the sword. 

In New-England the hardy yeomanry abandoned their 
homes and husbandry, and rushed to the conflict. In the 
other colonies, as the intelligence reached them, on all 
sides were heard bursts of popular indignation, and cries 
to arms. In New-Jersey the provincial treasury was seized. 
In Philadelphia the shipping was embargoed ; and in Ma- 
ryland and Virginia the public arms and ammunition were 
secured. When the news of the skirmish reached New- 
York, and it was announced in the concluding words of a 
letter " that the crimson fountain was opened, and God only 
knew when it would close," tumultuous menace and exe- 
cration followed. Patroles were immediately employed 
and, directed by Sears and Willet, the popular leaders, 
took their rounds throughout the night as if the enemy were 
at their doors. Mobs assembled ; the keys of the custom 
house were seized, the armory broken open ; and, dis- 
mayed by the irresistible impetuosity of the populace, a

battalion of the royal troops was compelled to surrender 
their weapons and leave the city. 

Congress met in May, 1775, and intelligence being re- 
ceived of the destination of forces for America, assumed all 
the powers of a paramount superintending sovereignty, and 
exercised some of its highest attributes. They proceeded 
to organize an army, and to establish a general post. Wash- 
ington was elected commander-in-chief ; the accession 
of Georgia completed the confederacy ; and, as the point 
most exposed, five thousand men were ordered to be raised 
for the protection of New-York. In that colony the lead- 
ers were now on the alert. Positions were taken to com- 
mand the Hudson ; alarm posts were established ; the coun- 
ties were divided into military districts ; officers were cho- 
sen under the superintendence of committees, which were 
then the chief engines of government. The members of 
the provincial convention partaking of the general enthu- 
siasm, pledged their personal responsibility for loans made 
to the colony, and with a signal magnanimity and self-de- 
votion, a letter was addressed by the committee of safety 
to General Lee, the commanding officer in New-York, on 
the twenty-first of January, 1776, in which some of them 
held large estates, authorizing him to devote the city to 
flames, if he deemed it a necessary sacrifice for advancing 
the cause of the revolution. 

After the expulsion of the royal troops, that city remained 
quiet until the arrival of Tryon, late governor of North 
Carolina, recently appointed to the government of New- 
York, a man of energy, courage, and decision. 

His arrival reanimated the royalists ; and although the 
patriots retained their ascendency, a sufficient diversion 
was created to keep up a feverish alarm. 

While these events were passing in rapid succession, 
Hamilton was not inactive. His mind roused to enthu- 
siasm in the cause which he had espoused, was constantly 



HAMILTON. 45 

generating new arguments to sustain it ; and the leisure 
which he had from his collegiate duties was employed in 
frequent contributions to the press. In June, seventeen 
hundred and seventy-five, with a view to confirm the opin- 
ion that the English ministry had abandoned every regard 
to the principles of her constitution, he published a series of 
" Remarks on the Quebec Bill," a measure which had been 
resisted in the British Parliament by the whole force of the 
opposition, and kindled in the bosoms of the Americans, at 
this moment of irritation, the most angry suspicions. Unable 
to discover the particular motive of policy which prompted 
such an enactment at this time, they viewed it as contain- 
ing some hidden purpose of hostility to themselves, and 
as an example of the extent to which a British ministry 
would exercise an arbitrary authority over the other colo- 
nies, if the least encroachment was submitted to. 

While Canada was a French province, the French laws 
and customs were in force there, which were regulated in 
conformity with the genius and disposition of a despotic 
government. When it fell under the dominion of Britain, 
these laws gave place to the milder influence of the English 
laws ; and all persons who settled in Canada were, by a 
proclamation of the king of Great Britain, assured a full 
enjoyment of the rights of British subjects. By this act, 
that proclamation and the government exercised under it, 
were annulled after the first of January, 1775. The French 
laws were restored, and a power reserved to the executive 
authority of the provinces of altering the laws at pleasure, 
and, by a further provision, the free exercise of the Roman 
catholic religion (subject to the king's supremacy) was 
guarantied to the people ; and the clergy of that church 
were declared entitled to hold and enjoy their accustomed 
dues and rights. 

The " Remarks" were published in two numbers. The 
first on the fifteenth of June, 1775, in a brief, but close ex- 



46 THE LIFE OF 

amination of the terms of the act, commented forcibly on 
the arbitrary character of this bill, which placed the laws 
and government of the province under the sole discretion 
of the prince ; conferred on him the most extraordinary and 
dangerous prerogative, that of creating courts of criminal, 
civil, and ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and appointing tempo- 
rary judges, whose commissions were revocable at plea- 
sure ; and that of making the trial by jury dependent on the 
will of the provincial legislature ; thus showing that an ar- 
bitrary government had been established in that extensive 
region. 

The purport of the second number, was to prove that the 
church of Rome had the sanction of a legal establishment 
in that province. It is an able refutation of an essay, which 
professed to show, that by this act, the catholic religion 
was merely tolerated ; and giving a very precise and accu- 
rate definition of an established religion, it deduces clearly 
from the terms of the act, that the catholic religion is placed 
on the footing of a regular establishment, while the protes- 
tant is " left entirely destitute and unbefriended." 

The dangers to their protestant neighbours of the vicinity 
of a colony of Roman catholics, allured in great numbers 
by the favour of government, with a dependent clergy, dis- 
posed to support absolute power, are strongly portrayed, and 
an earnest appeal is made to the jealous feelings of the 
protestant colonies. 

These essays are an interesting specimen of the early 
reach of thought, and precision of language, which were 
afterwards disclosed by him in so remarkable a degree. 

He also repeatedly took part in the public deliberations. 
One instance is related by a highly respectable member of 
the Society of Friends. It was a meeting of merchants. 
Soon after the discussion had opened, Hamilton rose to 
address them : " Ah," said the gentleman, " what brings 
that lad here ? the poor boy will disgrace himself." It

was a question as to the non-importation agreement. He 
argued the necessity of adhering to it while in force, both 
from obligation and the influence of example, but, at the 
same time, seeing the approach of war, he contended, that 
having been adopted only as a measure of resistance, and 
stronger measures being inevitable, that good policy requi- 
red the rescinding the agreement by congress, and that those 
who had violated it should be forgiven, as indirectly bene- 
fitting the public. 

Congress having published a declaration of their deter- 
mination to resist by force, and having recommended the 
embodying throughout the continent of organized compa- 
nies of militia, Hamilton joined a volunteer corps, command- 
ed by Major Fleming, who had been an adjutant in the Bri- 
tish service, and was a skilful and exact disciplinarian. 
" Under his command he acquired a knowledge of the rudi- 
ments of military science, and became expert in its details."* 

This company was composed chiefly of young gentlemen 
of the city, anxious to acquire a knowledge of tactics, with 
a view to future promotion. 

They met for daily exercise in the churchyard of St. 
George's chapel, early in the morning, before the com- 
mencement of their college duties. They assumed the name 
of " Hearts of Oak," and in their green uniforms and leath- 
ern caps, bearing the ominous inscription of " Freedom or 
Death," attracted the attention of the inhabitants, and are 
still recollected with enthusiasm by the few survivors of the 
scene. In this corps were several of the personal friends 
of Hamilton, among whom were Colonel Fish, afterwards 
eminently distinguished at the siege of York Town, and 
Colonel Troup, who served with credit in the northern de- 
partment, and received the thanks of congress. 

While Hamilton was a member of this corps, it was em- 
ployed in a service of some danger. Having been required

by the committee to remove the cannon from the Battery, 
while they were thus occupied, a boat of the Asia, man-of- 
war, approached, with the design, as was believed, of pre- 
venting their removal. The boat was fired upon by the 
citizens, which drew a broadside from the ship, " during 
which, Hamilton, who was aiding in the removal of the 
cannon, exhibited the greatest unconcern, although one of 
his companions was killed by his side," and was thus con- 
nected in the minds of the people with the first act of re- 
sistance to the first act of violence offered to the province. 

A violent commotion was the consequence of this attack. 
The liberty mobs collected and traversed the streets, threat- 
ening personal injuries to every adherent of the crown. In 
the height of their excitement, they approached the college, 
with a view to seize the person of the president, Doctor 
Cooper, an obnoxious tory. As they drew near his resi- 
dence, Hamilton and Troup ascended the steps, and fearful 
lest in this moment of irritation they might commit some 
excess, Hamilton, in order to give the president time to es- 
cape, harangued the mob, with great eloquence and ani- 
mation, " on the excessive impropriety of their conduct, 
and the disgrace they were bringing on the cause of liber- 
ty, of which they professed to be the champions." He suc- 
ceeded in diverting their attention, until the alarmed cler- 
gyman (who, at first, imagining he was exciting the popu- 
lace, exclaimed from an upper window, " Don't listen to 
him, gentlemen, he is crazy, he is crazy !") took refuge in 
the ship of war.* 

By a similar exhibition of firmness, he interposed with 
a concourse of people known as " Travis' mob," and divert- 
ed their rage from Mr. Thurman, whose conduct as a mem- 
ber of one of the committees, had aroused their indignation, 
and whose life was menaced. 

* Letter of Colonel Troup to Colonel Pickering. 



HAMILTON. 49 

At this time, the popular commotions became frequent ; 
the royalists who had fled from the other colonies to New- 
York for safety, were compelled to leave it ; and such was 
the distempered state of feeling, that Tryon, the last royal 
governor, a man of intrepid courage, fearful of his life, took 
refuge on board the Halifax packet, whence he issued his 
disregarded mandates. 

The press of Rivington, the tory printer, was the last ob- 
ject of attack. By occasionally printing for the popular 
side, he had preserved some appearance of neutrality, but 
as the controversy ripened, he took a decided part with the 
royalists. On the twenty-third of November, a party of 
horse from Connecticut, under the command of Sears, ap- 
peared in the city, with the avowed design of destroying 
his press. Heading the mob, they proceeded in the dusk 
of evening to rifle its contents. Hamilton again appeared 
the advocate of order, and relying on his former success, 
renewed his appeals to the discretion of the citizens, and, 
indignant at the encroachment of unlicensed troops from 
another colony, offered to join in opposition to the intruders, 
and check their progress. His exhortation was unsuccess- 
ful. The outrage was perpetrated, but his interference 
was not without happy consequences. It elevated him 
still more in the estimation of the patriots, who saw in his 
love of order and respect for the authority of the laws, as- 
surances of those high qualities which, rising above the wild 
uproar of the times, disdained to win popularity from popu- 
lar delusion.

CHAPTER IV. 

DURING the winter of seventeen hundred and seventy- 
six, while England was making a powerful effort for the 
subjugation of her colonies, and an act of parliament had 
been passed declaring them in open rebellion, the general 
congress were chiefly occupied with measures to repair 
the losses that attended the northern campaign, which, after 
the most arduous exertions, had terminated with the fall of 
Montgomery, before the walls of Quebec ; an event which, 
from the recollection of the death of Wolfe, the heroism of 
the attempt, the immense efforts which had been made, 
and the hardships encountered, deeply engaged the sym- 
pathies of his countrymen, and caused his loss to be de- 
plored as a great national calamity.* 

The failure of this expedition changed the whole aspect 
of affairs. Instead of securing the co-operation of the Ca- 
nadas, and presenting to the enemy an unbroken line of 
hostility, the utmost exertions were requisite to maintain 
the posts which had been won with so much gallantry in 
the preceding spring, to suppress the disaffection that eagerly 
displayed itself, and to prevent a junction of the forces of 
the enemy, which must have left the larger portion of the 
colonies an easy and unassisted prey to their overwhelming 
numbers. 

/Hamilton, during the previous winter, foreseeing tha.t the 
course of events must soon lead to an open rupture, deter- 
mined to apply himself to the study of arms, and before any 
steps were taken to organize a regular force, had by great

assiduity, made such progress as books and the instruction 
of a British bombardier could give him in pyrotechnics and 
gunnery. 

The convention of New-York having determined to aug- 
ment its military establishment, among other arrangements 
ordered a company of artillery to be raised.* Hamilton 
seized this opportunity to enter the service, and was recom- 
mended to the convention by his friend McDougal, who 
had been appointed colonel of the first regiment raised in 
the province. A doubt having been intimated of his know- 
ledge of that branch of arms, McDougal proposed that he 
should undergo an examination, and on a certificate being 
given of his competency, he was appointed, on the four- 
teenth day of March, seventeen hundred and seventy-si*, 
" Captain of the Provincial Company of Artillery," and 
within a short time after was directed to guard the records 
of the colony. " Hamilton," says Mulligan, by whom he 
was aided, " recruited his men, and with the remnant of the 
second and last remittance which he received from Santa 
Cruz, equipped them. He attended to their drill and his 
other duties with a degree of zeal and diligence which soon 
made his company conspicuous for their appearance, and 
the regularity of their movements." 

His first lieutenant having been transferred to another 
command, he took this occasion to enforce, in a letter to 
the convention, the policy of advancing officers in succes- 
sion, in which he added, " I would beg the liberty warmly 
to recommend to your attention the first sergeant in my 
company, a man highly deserving notice and preferment. 
He has discharged his duty in his present station with un- 
common fidelity, assiduity, and expertness ; he is a very 
good disciplinarian, possesses the advantage of having seen 
a good deal of service in Germany, and has a tolerable share

of common sense. In a word, I verily believe he will make 
an excellent lieutenant, and his advancement will be a 
great encouragement and benefit to my company in parti- 
cular, and will be an animating Example to all men of merit 
to whose knowledge it comes." Hamilton, in this sugges- 
tion, paid a debt of gratitude, and, at the same time, incul- 
cated a measure, the efficacy of which w r as demonstrated 
in various instances. 

The convention adopted the suggestion. The brave 
bombardier was promoted to a lieutenancy, and rising to 
the command of a company, Captain Thomson fell at the 
battle of Springfield, at the head of his men, after gallantly 
repulsing a desperate charge of the enemy. A general 
resolution was at the same time published by the conven- 
tion, assuring " promotion to such privates and non-commis- 
sioned officers as should distinguish themselves." Captain 
Hamilton seems not to have permitted the duties of his pro- 
fession to divert him wholly from the course of study in 
which he had been engaged. His military books of this 
period give an interesting exhibition of his train of thought. 
In the pay book of his company, amid various general spe- 
culations and extracts from the ancients, chiefly relating to 
politics and war, are intermingled tables of political arith- 
metic, considerations on commerce, the value of the rela- 
tive productions which are its objects, the balance of trade, 
the progress of population, and the principles on which de- 
pend the value of a circulating medium ; and among his 
papers, there remains a carefully digested outline of a plan 
for the political and commercial history of British Ameri- 
ca, compiled at this time. 

Thus a fund of knowledge was early gathered by him, 
which his powerful intellect soon after applied to the con- 
dition of the new republic, and rapidly matured into results 
of extensive utility. J 

But the term of these studies was soon closed. The 



54 THELIPEOF 



independence of the American states was declared by con- 
gress, and on the same day Lord Howe with his invading 
army landed in the vicinity of New-York. 

The heights of Brooklyn, a small village opposite New- 
York, on the southern banks of the Sound, was the posi- 
tion selected by General Lee to meet the first impression 
of the enemy. Its natural advantages for defence were 
not great. The extensive line of approach rendered a di- 
vision of the defensive force unavoidable, and there was 
little in its situation to prevent the expected battle being 
fought on nearly equal terms, while the difficulty of retreat 
filled the minds of the undisciplined troops with dismay. 

Washington balanced between the dangers of this post, 
and the alarming effects which he apprehended from a 
surrender of New- York without an attempt at defence. 
The British took advantage of the interval, and the battle 
of Long Island ensued. 

The result of this action proved the perilous position of 
the army ; and although the mode of its escape was a sub- 
ject of commendation, yet the course of the engagement 
and conduct of the troops disclosed to the eye of the com- 
mander all the weakness and disorganized state of his forces, 
and filled his mind with a sad presage of the future. In the 
retreat, Captain Hamilton brought up the rear, having lost 
his baggage and a field-piece. 

An important question as to the course to be pursued 
with regard to the city of New- York had meanwhile occu- 
pied the mind of Washington. Was it to be destroyed or 
not ? The subsequent events of the war proved the impo- 
licy of the national councils on this point ; but the follow- 
ing extract from a letter* of the commander-in chief to con- 
gress shows, that in this decision he had no part. 

" If we should be obliged to abandon the town, ought it 
to stand as winter quarters for the enemy ? They would

HAMILTON. 55 

derive great convenience from it on the one hand, and much 
property would be destroyed on the other. It is an im- 
portant question, and will admit of but little time for deli- 
beration. At present, I dare say, the enemy mean to pre- 
serve it if they can. If congress should resolve upon the 
destruction of it, the resolution should be kept a profound 
secret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change 
in their plan." Congress resolved to save the city.* 

Immediately after the action, the Americans evacuated 
the city of New-York, leaving a small force in the field- 
works which had been erected on the eminences that skirted 
the Sound, opposite to which a portion of the British fleet 
were soon after moored, to cover the approach of that part 
of the troops which were ordered to take possession of the 
city. " I recollect," says a survivor of the scene, " as though 
it were yesterday, the day when the British fleet came up. 
Fascines had been extended across the Broadway near the 
Bowling Green, where the statue of Chatham was thrown 
down. On the west side of the town the barricades were 
built of a cargo of mahogany ; but this was all a show to 
keep up the spirits of the people'; for I myself heard Ge- 
neral Wooster laugh at the idea of defence. 

"Along the shores of the Hudson were piled in little heaps, 
by which the women and children were sitting, the gather- 
ed furniture of the timid, who were anxiously but vainly 
looking for the means of transportation from the opposite 
shores of the Jersey. The half-armed militia were seen 
parading in small parties through the streets, who, incensed 
at the approach of the enemy, every now and then dischar- 
ged a volley on some unfortunate tory who was skulking 
away ; while at intervals were heard the ringing of the 
small brass pieces on the battery, which the two frigates 
that passed up the Hudson hardly cared to answer. As the

boats came near, filled with soldiers, they were drawn by 
the tide into the form of a crescent. I never saw so beau- 
tiful a sight ; the sun shone out bright, and the water was 
without a ripple." 

The next position taken was the heights of Harlem, at 
which place, says Benson, Hamilton first attracted the ob- 
servant eye of Washington, who, on the inspection of the 
works which he was engaged in throwing up, entered into 
conversation with him, invited him to his marquee, and 
formed a high estimate of his military capacity. 

Captain Hamilton remained with the main army until 
the battle of White Plains,* where his conduct was remark- 
ed ; whence, on the retreat of Washington to North Cas- 
tle, and the advance of Knyphausen to Kingsbridge, he was 
detached to cover a post in the neighbourhood of Fort 
Washington, The fall of that fortress, which sealed the 
fate of the city of New- York, and cut off so large a portion 
of the army, awakened all the soldier's spirit in his breast ; 
and, after a careful observation of the post, he volunteered 
to General Washington to storm it ; saying, that if he 
would confide to him an adequate number of men, one half 
under the command of Major Stevens,! the residue of him- 
self, he would promise him success. But the small num- 
ber of the troops, and the position and strength of the ene- 
my forbade this gallant enterprise, to which Hamilton was 
encouraged by a knowledge of its defences, and by the ease 
with which it had fallen. 

After the British had crossed the Hudson, he succeeded 
in joining the army on the west side of that river. 

On the approach of the enemy, they retreated first to 
Hackensack, and thence to Newark. Here Washington, 
reinforced by Stirling's and Hand's brigades, called a coun- 
cil of officers.

By some of the members it was urged to move the army 
to Morristown, to form a junction with the northern troops, 
who were winding along the mountains of Sussex ; but 
Washington and Greene concurred in the more hazardous 
and intrepid determination, if possible, to make a stand at 
Brunswick ; but, at all events, to dispute the passage of the 
Delaware. 

After a short repose, with a force not exceeding three 
thousand men, half clothed, many of them unarmed, with- 
out cavalry to protect them from surprises, debilitated by 
fatigue, and worn down by a series of disasters, Washing- 
ton was compelled again to retire, closely pursued by a de- 
tachment of eight thousand men under the command of 
Lord Cornwallis. The Americans succeeded in making 
an undisturbed retreat until they approached the vicinity 
of New-Brunswick ; there, as the rear of the American 
levies crossed the Raritan, the van of the British came in 
sight. The bridge having been destroyed, and knowing 
that the river was fordable, Hamilton, while the army was 
parading, planted his field-pieces on the high grounds which 
command the river, and, by a spirited cannonade, aided in 
checking the progress of the British, while Washington de- 
camping after night-fall, reached Princeton on the morning 
of the first of December. 

" Well do I recollect the day," said a friend, " when Ha- 
milton's company marched into Princeton. /It was a model 
of discipline ; at their head was a boy, and I wondered at 
his youth ; but what was my surprise, when struck with his 
diminutive figure, he was pointed out to me as that Hamil- 
ton of whom we had already heard so much." / 

He continued with his company, which, from the severity 
of the weather, and its exposure in the brilliant enterprises 
of Trenton and Princeton, was reduced to a fragment of five- 
and-twenty men, until the establishment of head quarters 
at Morristown, when, at the invitation of General Wash-

58 THE LIFE OF 

ington, on the first of March, seventeen hundred and seven- 
ty-seven, he was appointed his aid-de-camp, with the rank 
of lieutenant colonel. 

The situation of New-Jersey during the progress of the 
hostile armies, was more calamitous than that of any por- 
tion of the country under all the trials of the revolution. 

Its position between the two great central colonies of 
America, had for a long time, protected it from the harass- 
ing exposure to which the out settlements were subject, and 
the great body of its people were pursuing their rural oc- 
cupations in quiet and security. 

With but little foreign commerce to feel directly the ex- 
actions of Great Britain, and with few causes of internal 
dissatisfaction with their governors, the spirit of resistance 
which this colony evinced, is a remarkable evidence of the 
rapid growth of popular sentiments. New-Jersey was, in 
fact, as to any present evils, scarcely a party to the question 
then in agitation ; but there, as in other parts of America, 
the love of liberty which had been cultivated in a few ge- 
nerous bosoms,* quickened the mass of the people, and no 
sooner was opposition aroused, than she was seen entrust- 
ing her fortunes to committees and conventions, the great 
instruments of political hostility. 

But the ardour which had enkindled the inhabitants of 
that colony, had neither anticipated nor prepared them for 
the scenes in which they were so early to participate. 

* The exertions of Mr. Alexander, (Lord Stirling,) were particularly con- 
spicuous. At the beginning of the controversy, he was a member of the king's 
council of that state, and his correspondence with the governor gives an amu- 
sing view of that doubtful allegiance to the king and to the people which was 
sought to be preserved and justified. He served through the war, and died 
in 1783, when Washington, in a letter to congress, paid this high tribute to 
his courage and patriotism, "The remarkable bravery, intelligence, and 
promptitude of his lordship, to perform his duty as an officer, had endeared him 
to the whole army, and now make his loss the more sincerely regretted."- 
Dated January 20, 1783. 



HAMILTON. 59 

The arrival of the British army in New- York seemed 
hardly to have awakened them from their security ; and 
when the determination of Washington to cross the Hud- 
son, threw upon them, of a sudden, the whole weight of war, 
scenes of unmitigated suffering ensued. 

In the track of the pursuing army bridges were broken 
down, dwellings destroyed, granaries plundered, and even 
the traces of the fugitives were seen printed on the snow 
with their blood. While many fled before the enemy, the 
condition of those who remained was doubly pitiable. Some 
sought security in protections ; intestine feuds followed ; eve- 
ry social feeling seemed to be suspended ; and in the gene- 
ral insecurity, suspicion was deemed a virtue. Straggling 
bands of plunderers were seen stealing along the margin of 
the water courses, and by the unfrequented roads. Parties 
of horse, foraging at a distance, broke in, during the night, 
upon the unhappy people who had taken shelter in the woods, 
directed by the fires near which they were cowering. The 
rich had removed their wives and children to New-Eng- 
land, while the women of the poor were seized, flying in 
terror to the interior, where, at the recital of the barbari- 
ties they had endured, parties were formed, who came down 
upon the disaffected with infuriated passions, to wreak ven- 
geance for their wrongs. Even the friends of the cause 
were compelled to wrestle with the famished American 
soldiers for their secreted provisions. 

Amidst all which, their patriotic governor was constantly 
issuing mandates against disaffection, and giving to resist- 
ance the stronger motive of religious duty. The places of 
worship were deserted, and the clergy were seen inciting 
the people to arms, thus rendering fiercer and more odious 
the ferocious face of war. 

The Americans, at the close of this campaign, were re- 
duced to few more than twelve hundred troops, enlisted 
for short terms of service, at the expiration of which, scarce- 



60 THE LIFE OF 

ly an inducement could be offered for their re-enlistment 
The selection of the post at Morristown was, under these 
circumstances, particularly eligible, and had been made at 
the instance of the unfortunate St. Clair. Protected by 
inaccessible heights and heavy forests from the approach 
of any large body of the -enemy, it had the advantage of 
being almost equi-distant from Amboy, Newark, and New- 
Brunswick, their principal positions, which were all held 
in check, while it was secure of a retreat by various defiles 
in its rear, leading to a fertile and well-peopled country. 

But deficient as was the army, if it may so be called, in 
numbers, the severe campaign of the Jersies had produced 
the happiest effect, in disclosing to the commander-in-chief 
the character of his officers, and in drawing around him in 
a common devotion to its cause, the most gallant patriots 
of the country. 

Surrounded by the greatest difficulties, they had them- 
selves learned, and their example had taught the American 
people the all-important lesson, that their enemy was not 
invincible, and their common dangers had inspired a mutual 
confidence, which, towards the person of their chief, rose to 
the highest point of enthusiasm. 

Indeed, in the long life of glory with which Washington 
was blessed, this may be selected as the moment when his 
popularity was greatest. The reverses which had befallen 
the army at the commencement of the campaign, had scarce- 
ly left a hope for America short of unconditional submis- 
sion ; but when, in the language of Colonel Hamilton,* 
" after escaping the grasp of a disciplined and victorious 
enemy, this little band of patriots were seen skilfully avoid- 
ing an engagement until they could contend with advan- 
tage, and then, by the masterly enterprises of Trenton and 
Princeton, cutting them up in detachments, rallying the

scattered energies of the country, infusing terror into the 
breasts of their invaders, and changing the whole tide and 
fortune of the war," a general spirit of enthusiasm per- 
vaded the nation, and every bosom swelled with gratitude 
to Washington and his illustrious companions. 

Among these, the reputation of General Greene de- 
servedly stood highest. 

Connected with every important movement of the main 
army from the investment of Boston until this moment, he 
displayed, in all its various difficulties, an unbending con- 
stancy, a readiness of decision, a fertility of resource, and 
a masterly self-possession, which proved him in every emi- 
nent military qualification second to no other officer of the 
army, and had given him an influence with the comman- 
der-in-chief, which in the future incidents of the revolution, 
was exerted most happily for the service. Of him it was 
not less truly than eloquently said, " that he carried in his 
native genius all the resources of war, and the balance of 
every extreme of fortune." His eminent and distinguished 
excellence early attracted the respect of Colonel Hamilton; 
an intimacy followed of the closest character ; by none of 
his comrades were the merits of General Greene more 
fully understood, and, as will be seen in the future pages 
of this work, by none could they have been more warmly 
portrayed. 

Next in rank to Greene was Major General Sullivan. 
This gentleman having acquired an extensive reputation as 
a lawyer in the colony of New-Hampshire, was elected to 
represent it in the celebrated congress of seventy-four. In 
this situation he commanded respect and confidence as a 
man of firmness and intelligence ; and having been re- 
elected a delegate, on the selection of the general staff of 
the army, Sullivan was appointed to the command of a bri- 
gade, then on duty near Boston. Early in seventy-six, he re- 
ceived orders for the northern army, with which he served 



62 THE LIFE OF 

until the approaching invasion of New- York, when he 
again rejoined the main army, and was captured in the bat- 
tle of Long Island. Immediately after his exchange, he re- 
sumed his command, and in the action of Trenton, at the 
head of the right wing, discovered equal gallantry and good 
conduct. Of proverbial courage, quick apprehension, and 
observing a scrupulous obedience to his instructions, he 
was usually selected for stations which required deter- 
mined intrepidity, and in no instance did he disappoint the 
trust which was reposed in him. 

The first regiment of artillery raised on the continental 
establishment had been confided to Henry Knox, a native 
of Boston, who, leaving a lucrative employment, joined the 
army as a volunteer in the battle of Bunker's Hill. Alarmed 
at the deficiency of ordnance which gave the enemy such 
vast superiority, Knox, full of ardour, hastened to the Ca- 
nadian frontier, where, by great personal exertions, he was 
enabled in some measure to supply this essential \vant. 
The enterprise he displayed in this instance received the 
grateful approbation of the commander-in-chief. He was 
appointed a colonel of artillery, and on the increase of that 
corps obtained the rank of Major General. 

Of great integrity, a sound understanding, and undaunt- 
ed courage, he was soon classed among the individuals who 
most deserved the public confidence ; and on occasions 
when the service was the more meritorious, because it was 
necessarily secret, he was eminently useful. Frank, open, 
and sincere, he won and preserved the regard of his bro- 
ther officers, and could boast that which was alone a suffi- 
cient passport to consideration, of being the man whom 
" Washington loved." 

But the officer who at this time, next to Greene, pos- 
sessed most the personal confidence of the commander, 
was General John Cadwallader. This gentleman, formed 
by education to adorn the most polished circles of society, 



H AM I L T O N . 63 

combined with a clear and vigorous understanding, a bold 
spirit of enterprise and generosity of temper, which rose 
above the difficulties of every situation, and inspired among 
his followers the highest sense of personal attachment. 

Hurried away by his ardour, he had suffered himself to 
be taken a prisoner at the same time with General Sullivan. 
His manly qualities made a strong impression in the camp 
of the enemy, and great, but vain, exertions were used to in- 
duce him to influence Washington in favour of conciliation. 
On his liberation, he returned to the army ; and in the bold 
attempts to repulse the British from the borders of the De- 
laware, he was entrusted with a most important and difficult 
share in the enterprise. His merits soon forced him upon 
the attention of Congress. At the close of the campaign he 
was promoted to the command of a brigade, and continued 
during a great part of the Revolution serving under the im- 
mediate eye of Washington. 

The gentlemen who at this time composed the personal 
staff of the commander-in-chief were, Colonel Robert H. 
Harrison, a native of Maryland, who at an early age 
removed to Alexandria, where, as a member of the bar, he 
was employed by Washington, who, soon after he took the 
command at Cambridge, wrote him an urgent letter to join 
the army, which he did, in the capacity of an aid-de-camp ; 
and, in the following year, was appointed his principal se- 
cretary ; to the performance of the arduous duties of which 
office his health, and ultimately his life, became a sacrifice.

HAMILTON. 65 

. 

CHAPTER V. 

[1777.] 

ON his appointment to the staff of Washington, Colonel 
Hamilton, immediately after his recovery from a very se- 
vere indisposition, induced by the hardships of the campaign, 
wrote to the New- York convention, apprizing them of his 
change of situation, and suggesting the transfer of his com- 
pany to the continental establishment. 

A reply was received from Messrs. Morris and Allison, 
announcing " that they had been appointed a committee of 
the New- York convention, to correspond with him at head 
quarters," and concurring in his suggestion, as to the dis- 
posal of his company. A long and interesting correspond- 
ence ensued, parts of which will be presented in their ap- 
propriate connexion. 

/ Having served with distinction through the most arduous 
campaign of the revolution, and having thus entitled him- 
self to rapid promotion in the line of the army, Hamilton 
hesitated much before he consented to relinquish this pros- 
pect for a place in the staff. His high sense of personal 
independence, had already induced him to decline a similar 
invitation from two general officers ; but influenced by the 
reputation of the commander-in-chief, he relinquished his 
objections, and entered upon the discharge of his duties 
with all the devotion due to his early and illustrious friend. 

This larger and more appropriate sphere of action, gave 
to his mind not only a wider but a loftier range. He was 
called, not merely to execute subordinate parts, but to assist 
in planning campaigns, in devising means to support them, 
in corresponding with the different members of this exten- 
sive empire, and in introducing order and harmony into the 
general system.

66 THELIFEOF 

The situation of an aid-de-camp to the commander-in- 
chief, from the position in which he stood, was among the 
most arduous that can be imagined. The pressure of the 
correspondence was that which the general principally felt ; 
and in the selection of the members of his staff, " as to mi- 
litary knowledge," he says in a letter to Colonel Harrison, 
of the 9th of January, 1777, "I do not expect to find gen- 
tlemen much skilled in it ; if they can write a good letter, 
write quick; are methodical and diligent, it is all I expect 
to find in my aids." And in a subsequent letter to congress,* 
calling for additional assistance, he remarks " the business 
that has given constant exercise to the pen of my secretary, 
and not only frequently, but always, to those of my aids-de- 
camp, has rendered it impracticable for the former to regis- 
ter the copies of my letters, instructions, &c. in books ; by 
which means, valuable documents, which may be of equal 
public utility and private satisfaction, remain in loose sheets, 
and in the rough manner in which they were first drawn." 

The principal labour of the correspondence fell upon 
Colonel Harrison ; and even to a limited knowledge of its 
extent, it is surprising how much and how well it was per- 
formed. Soon habituated to the mind of the commander- 
in-chief, with the brief memoranda which were before him, 
he seized upon his thoughts, and though in a style perhaps 
too diffuse, and sometimes hurried, placed them in a most 
perspicuous light. Tilghman's style partook more of the 
character of his sprightly temper. His sentences were 
brief and simple, giving results rather than the processes 
by which they were reached, and might often be supposed 
to have been written on the drum-head, but still always 
breathing throughout a general air of elegance. The more 
elaborate and important communications, which did not

Congress. 



HAMILTON. 67 

proceed from the commander-in-chief, devolved upon 
Hamilton. 

Soon after he had entered the General's family, having 
closed a correspondence with Governor Livingston as to 
the punishment of disaffected persons, he was called upon 
to serve him in that line in which he had become most con- 
spicuous. Amid the various high duties which engrossed 
his cares, the attention of Washington was at this time par- 
ticularly directed to a negotiation with the enemy relative 
to the exchange of prisoners, a matter always of difficult 
adjustment, and arousing much national feeling ; but in a 
civil war, such as this, where the policy of England was 
closely adhered to, of treating it as a rebellion, attended 
with peculiar embarrassments. 

The capture of St. Johns, in the preceding autumn, first 
invited the cares of congress to this interesting object. In 
a spirit not less dictated by a liberal view of the interests 
of nations at war, than by the humanity which is due to the 
subjects of its calamities, but which is so often forgotten, 
they immediately directed an equal exchange of prisoners, 
which was followed by successive resolutions, giving them 
a choice of residence ; directing them to be treated with 
kindness ; making the same provision for them as for their 
own troops ; appointing a commissioned officer to protect 
them from neglect ; and assigning the punctual payment of 
their allowance as the especial duty of the president of each 
state convention, or of the speakers of the assemblies. 

These regulations were strictly enforced, and every in- 
stance of inattention promptly redressed. 

The measures taken by the commander-in-chief had cor- 
responded fully with the intentions of congress, and from 
the commencement until the close of the contest, under the 
most trying circumstances, he sought every opportunity of 
adding to the valour of the American arms, the lustre of 
humanity. 



68 THELIFEOF 

An opposite line of conduct had been adopted by the 
enemy, and the greatest indignation had been excited by 
the recitals which were made of the indignities suffered by 
those Americans who had fallen into their hands. 

In the hope of establishing a general principle of ex- 
change, a negotiation had been opened with General Howe, 
before the commencement of the preceding campaign, to 
which he had acceded ; but, in his career of success, look- 
ing to an early triumph, this agreement had been departed 
from, and difficulty after difficulty arose in its execution. 

The treatment of the prisoners who capitulated at Fort 
Washington, had been keenly felt at head quarters, and had 
quickened Washington's anxiety to remove all artificial ob- 
stacles ; but the circumstance which at this time chiefly 
interested him, was the situation of General Lee, who had 
been captured at Baskenridge, by Colonel Harcourt, and 
carried to New- York. On learning this event, congress 
offered in exchange six field officers of inferior rank, one 
of whom was Colonel Campbell. This proposition was 
rejected, and General Lee was placed in close confinement, 
with an intimation that his treatment would be different 
from that usual towards prisoners of war. 

Congress, indignant at this procedure, immediately order- 
ed Colonel Campbell and the Hessian officers into close 
custody, and threatened retaliation for every indignity of- 
fered to the American prisoners. 

These decisive measures alarmed the enemy, and on the 
third of April, 1777, Lord Cornwallis enclosed to General 
Washington a letter from Colonel Walcott, which was al- 
leged to have been previously delivered to Colonel Harri- 
son, but had not been received. 

The temper displayed by the English commissioner evin- 
ced little disposition to produce a favourable issue. It 
seemed rather to have been his design to indulge in a tone 
of arrogant crimination of the American army, and im- 



HAMILTON. 69 

peachment of the integrity of Washington's motives, than 
to promote an object mutually desirable, and was conduct- 
ed in a spirit even more objectionable than that which had 
marked the correspondence of the preceding year. 

The importance of meeting these charges was strongly 
felt, and the task of vindicating the course which had been 
adopted, was imposed on Colonel Hamilton. " The pen 
for our army," says Troup, " was held by Hamilton ; and 
for dignity of manner, pith of matter, and elegance of 
style, General Washington's letters are unrivalled in mili- 
tary annals." 

The effort to establish a cartel failed, in consequence of 
the determination of Howe not to include Lee within the 
class of American prisoners ; and these unfortunate men 
were compelled still to endure the privations to which they 
had been subject ; but the negotiation itself was attended 
with flattering circumstances. The correspondence in- 
creased the esteem in which the American character was 
held in Europe ; and their friends proudly referred to it as 
another evidence that they were not less accomplished with 
the pen than with the sword. 

When the season for military operations opened, the 
greatest anxiety pervaded the United States as to the 
course of policy which would be adopted by the enemy. 

The concentration of an army in the north, and the ob- 
vious policy of seizing the passes in the Highlands, seemed 
to indicate them as the first object, not only because the 
campaign might be commenced earlier than in Pennsylva- 
nia, as the army would in one case move by water, but 
having the command of the Hudson, they might, by taking 
advantage of a southerly wind, run up that river in a few 
hours, destroy the boats which had been provided on its 
banks, thus prevent Washington's army from crossing until 
they had marched to Albany, and, after ravaging the state 
of New- York, enter Connecticut on the western side, where 



70 THE LIFE OF 

the disaffection of a part of the people would ensure them 
many friends. 

This course had also been indicated in the instructions 
from Great Britain, which directed a portion of the British 
fleet to be employed in making a diversion on the coast of 
New-England, and thus perhaps compel her to withdraw a 
part of her troops composing the northern army, and cer- 
tainly check the progress of enlistment. 

An expedition to Peekskill, late in March, (a post at the 
foot of the Highlands,) under the command of General 
McDoggal, where large munitions of war were supposed to 
be, and which the gallantry of Colonel Willet prevented 
from being more disastrous ; the destruction of the stores 
at Danbury, where the intrepid Wooster fell, and the move- 
ment of the enemy towards Amboy, all conspired to con- 
firm this supposition. To meet this event, the Convention 
of New- York strained every nerve, having authorized Go- 
vernor Clinton, to whom the security of the Highlands had 
been entrusted, to make such drafts from the militia as he 
might deem necessary, by whose orders every third man 
was drawn from the southern, and every fifth man from the 
northern counties. And, indeed, at no other moment were 
the duties of patriotism more urgent in that quarter. Of 
the fourteen counties of New-York, five, and a part of a 
sixth, were at this time in the possession of the enemy ; a 
single galley was riding the Hudson triumphant and unmo- 
lested ; the militia, harassed with repeated calls, had, in 
some instances refused to march until the Convention or- 
dered the recusants to be fired upon, and serious appre- 
hensions were entertained that the interior of the state 
would soon be lighted up with the fires of the savages, who 
were moving from their coverts. 

These appalling circumstances rendered the committee 
of the Convention exceedingly anxious for intelligence as to 
the designs of the enemy ; and an active correspondence 



HAMILTON. 71 

was kept up with Colonel Hamilton. The following letter 
in reply to one from Robert R. Livingston, since so distin- 
guished in the history of his country, in behalf of that body, 
mentioning the arrival of a vessel with arms from France, 
and their having authorized a draught of militia to meet an 
apprehended descent of the enemy high on the banks of the 
Hudson, to destroy the boats provided for the army, will 
indicate the appearances at this time. 

HAMILTON TO A COMMITTEE OF THE PROVINCIAL 
CONGRESS. 

Head Quarters, Morristown, April 5th, 1777. 
GENTLEMEN : 

Since my last I have had the pleasure of receiving your 
reply to my two favours of 29th ultimo and 2d current. I 
am happy enough to be able to inform you, that my indis- 
position, which was the occasion of my brevity when I last 
wrote, is now removed. 

The opinion I advanced respecting the enemy's not mov- 
ing before the beginning of May, seems to be shaken, though 
not entirely overthrown, by some present appearances. We 
have received information, that they are embarking about 
three thousand men on board of transports, which are lying 
at the Hook, by way of Staten Island. This, it is conjec- 
tured, is with a view to the Delaware ; and the supposition 
is confirmed, by the circumstance of a confederacy lately 
detected at Philadelphia, who, among other things, were 
endeavouring, by the temptation of fifty pounds, to engage 
persons as pilots up that river. The extreme difficulties 
they must labour under for want of forage, and the infinite 
hazard they must run by moving with a small body of about 
five thousand men, with an enemy in the rear, incapable of 
sparing any considerable body of troops to form a post be- 
hind, and be an asylum to them in case of accident, these 
circumstances will hardly allow me to think they will be 



72 THELIPEOF 

daring enough to make the attempt at this time. But on 
the other hand, as they know we are in a progressive state 
as to numbers, and other matters of importance, and as they 
have no prospect of early reinforcement, and are in a state 
of uncertainty as to any, from the bustling aspect of Euro- 
pean affairs, it is probable they may conceive a necessity of 
making a push at all risks. Perhaps, however, this embar- 
kation is intended for some other purpose ; to make a di- 
version, or execute some partizan exploit elsewhere. On 
the whole, I find it difficult to believe they are yet ready 
for any capital operation. 

As to your apprehensions of an attempt up the North 
river, I imagine you may discard any uneasiness on that 
score, although it will be at all times advisable to be on the 
watch against such a contingency, it is almost reduced to a cer- 
tainty, that the principal views of the enemy in the ensuing 
campaign will be directed towards the southward, and to 
Philadelphia more immediately ; of which idea, the disco- 
very before mentioned, with respect to pilots, is no incon- 
siderable confirmation. Philadelphia is an object calcu- 
lated to strike and attract their attention. It has all along 
been the main source of supplies towards the war, and the 
getting it into their possession would deprive us of a wheel 
we could very badly spare, in the great political and mili- 
tary machine. They are sensible of this, and are equally 
sensible, that it contains in itself, and is surrounded by a 
prodigious number of persons attached to them, and inimi- 
cal to us, who would lend them all the assistance they could 
in the further prosecution of their designs. It is also a 
common and well-grounded rule in war, to strike first and 
principally at the capital towns and cities, in order to the 
conquest of a country. 

I must confess I do not see any object equally interesting 
to draw then- efforts to the northward. Operations merely 
for plundering and devastation can never answer their end ; 



HAMILTON. 73 

and if they could, one part of the continent would do nearly 
as well as another. And as to the notion of forming a 
junction with the northern army, and cutting off the com- 
munication between the northern and southern states, I 
apprehend it will do better in speculation than in practice. 
Unless the geography of the country is far different from 
any thing I can conceive, to effect this would require a 
chain of posts, and such a number of men at each, as would 
never be practicable or maintainable, but to an immense 
army. In their progress, by hanging upon their rear, and 
seizing every opportunity of skirmishing, their situation 
might be rendered insupportably uneasy. 

But for fear of mistake, the general has determined to 
collect a considerable body of troops at or about Peekskill, 
which will not be drawn off till the intentions of the enemy 
have acquired a decisive complexion. These will be rea- 
dy, according to conjunctures, either to proceed northerly or 
southerly, as may be requisite. Every precaution should 
be taken to prevent the boats from being destroyed, by col- 
lecting them at the first movement of the enemy under 
cover of one of the forts, or into some inlet, difficult of ac- 
cess and easily defensible with a small number of men. 
The loss of them would be an irreparable disadvantage. 

The enemy's attempt upon Peekskill is a demonstration 
of the folly of having any quantity of stores at places so 
near the water, and so much exposed to a sudden inroad. 
There should never be more there than sufficient to answer 
present demands. We have lost a good deal in this way at 
different" times, and I hope experience will at last make 
us wiser. 

His excellency lately had a visit from the Oneida chief 
and five others. He managed them with a good deal of 
address, and sent them away perfectly satisfied. He per- 
suaded them to go to Philadelphia, but they declined it, 
alleging their impatience to return, and remove the errone- 

VOL. i. 10

ous opinions of their countrymen, from the misrepresenta- 
tions of British emissaries, which they were apprehensive 
might draw them into some rash proceedings. They part- 
ed, after having made the most solemn protestations of 
friendship and good will. His excellency has been very 
busy all day in despatching the southern post, which has 
prevented me giving him your resolve. It will, no doubt, 
be very acceptable ; and it is with pleasure I inform you, 
that the zeal and abilities of the New- York convention hold 
the first rank in his estimation. 

No news from France, save that the congress have ob- 
tained a credit there, for which they can draw bills to the 
amount of 100,000 sterling. This will be extremely ser- 
viceable in carrying on a trade with the French. The new 
troops begin to come in. If we can shortly get any con- 
siderable accession of strength, we may be able to strike 
some brilliant stroke. 

I am, Gentlemen, with the greatest respect, 
Your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

P. S. We have been some time endeavouring to nego- 
tiate a regular cartel ; but it has been lately broken off 
principally on account of Major General Lee. General 
Howe will not allow him to be comprehended under the 
general idea of American prisoners. 

On the 17th of the same month, he again wrote to the 
committee, giving a particular account of the attack of the 
enemy on the American troops commanded by General 
Lincoln, at Boundbrook, and informing them that three of 
the enemy's vessels had entered the Delaware, and that a 
vessel from France had been attacked in the river, and, to 
prevent her falling into their hands, was blown up. 

To aid in counteracting any sudden movement of the 
enemy, Washington extended his army from Morristown 



HAMILTON. 75 

to the high ground of Middlebrook, a strong position within 
a few miles of New-Brunswick, where the English had col- 
lected their principal stores, which enabled him, at the same 
time, to keep up his communication with Philadelphia, 
which he was confirmed in his belief was the enemy's 
ultimate destination. 

The state of the public mind in that city, at this expect- 
ed invasion, is strongly shown in the following letter from 
Mr. Duer, a very able and eloquent delegate in congress 
from New- York, whose conduct from the commencement 
of the revolution had been marked with boldness and in- 
telligence. 

WILLIAM DUER TO ABRAHAM TEN BROECK. 

Philadelphia, April 17, 1777. 

" I am extremely sorry to inform you, that notwithstand- 
ing the invasion which threatens this city, a languor pre- 
vails amongst the inhabitants of almost all ranks. The 
disputes about their constitution, and a want of vigilance 
and vigour in detecting and defeating the designs of the 
disaffected, have given the malignants a dangerous ascend- 
ency. The depreciation of the continental money is aston- 
ishingly rapid, and I see, with concern, that no attempts 
are made to check so fatal a measure. You will see by 
the enclosed resolutions of congress of the 14th and 15th 
of April, that they have been under the necessity of supply- 
ing an executive authority in this state. 

"By the recess of the Supreme Executive Council, there 
was an absolute interregnum, and if congress had not in- 
terposed, this state would have fallen an easy prey to a very 
small body of the enemy's army. Only six hundred and 
eighty-five men at Ticonderoga fit for duty, including one 
hundred and twenty artificers. I have the pleasure to as- 
sure the convention, that the state of New- York stands in 
a very high point of light in the eyes of the continent, and 



76 THE LIFE OF 

that General Washington, in his public letters to congress, 
gives the most honourable testimonials in its favour. These, 
sir, are the happy effects of our unanimity and vigour." 

It is also stated, " the disputes in Pennsylvania grew out 
of no want of attachment to the cause, but from disputes 
about the constitution. I wish the establishment of new 
forms of government had been deferred. The union, vi- 
gour, and security derived from conventions and committees, 
are not to be found in any state under its new constitution." 

The severe campaign of the preceding year, though one 
of continued successes until the affair of Trenton, had been 
productive of little service to the British cause, excepting 
the capture of New-York ; for the enemy could boast no- 
thing more than the ground which their armies occupied. 
Sir William Howe now judged that the honour of the Bri- 
tish arms required some new enterprise worthy of the force 
under his command. 

None seemed more imposing than that of Philadelphia. 
It was regarded as the capital of the country. It was the 
seat of government of Pennsylvania, and the most important 
city of the colonies ; and although, as a military post, its 
possession would yield few advantages, its occupation by an 
enemy would weaken the cause of America in Europe, 
strengthen the hands of the British ministry, and produce, 
he hoped, such a depressing effect on the minds of the Ame- 
ricans, as might predispose them to yield more readily to 
conciliator}' propositions. Having in vain essayed every art 
to bring on a general engagement, and not daring to ven- 
ture on the bold experiment of crossing the Delaware with 
an enemy in his rear, the English general decided upon a 
new plan of operations. His whole force now exceeded 
forty thousand men ; from these, leaving a sufficient strength 
to protect New- York, he selected eighteen thousand of his 
choicest soldiers, and about the middle of July embarked at 



HAMILTON. 

Amboy. During this interval of inactivity, the attention of 
the Americans was principally directed to the operations on 
the northern frontier ; and the advance of one army towards 
Albany, and the embarkation, at the same time, of another 
for an apparently remote expedition, baffled speculation. 
The following letter from Colonel Hamilton, to a friend, 
written at this time, marks the state of opinion. 

Head duarters, Smith's Clove, July 22d, 1777. 

Your favour of the eighteenth, from Saratoga, reached 

me yesterday Your pronouncing Fort Edward among 

the other forts, indefensible, surprises me a little, as it is 
entirely contrary to the representations of several gentle- 
men of judgment, who have had an opportunity of seeing 
and considering its situation, by whom we have been taught 
to believe that it would be an excellent post, at least for 
checking and retarding Burgoyne's progress. I agree with 
you that our principal strength in the quarter you are, will 
be in the forests and natural strength of the country, and in 
the want of forage, provisions, carriages, &c. in which the 
enemy may easily be thrown, by taking away what there 
are of those articles which you observe have never been in 
great abundance. 

I am doubtful whether Burgoyne will attempt to pene- 
trate far, and whether he will not content himself with ha- 
rassing our back settlements by parties, assisted by the sa- 
vages, who, it is to be feared, will pretty generally be 
tempted by the enemy's late successes, to confederate in 
hostilities against us. 

This doubt arises from some appearances that indicate a 
southern movement of General Howe's army, which if it 
should really happen, will certainly be a barrier agains: 
any further impressions of Burgoyne ; for it cannot be sup- 
posed he would be rash enough to plunge into the bosom of 
the country without an expectation of being met by Ge- 



78 THELIFEOF 

neral Howe. Things must prove very adverse to us in- 
deed, should he make such an attempt and not be ruined 
by it. I confess, however, that the appearances I allude 
to do not carry a full evidence in my mind ; because they 
are opposed by others of a contradictory kind, and because 
I cannot conceive upon what principle of common sense or 
military propriety Howe can be running away from Bur- 
goyne to the southward. 

It is much to be wished he may, even though it should 
give him the possession of Philadelphia, which, by our re- 
moteness from it may very well happen. In this case we 
may not only, if we think proper, retaliate, by aiming a 
stroke at New- York ; but we may come upon him with the 
greatest part of our collective force, to act against that 
part which is under him. We shall then be certain that 
Burgoyne cannot proceed, and that a small force of conti- 
nental troops will be sufficient for that partizan war which 
he must carry on the rest of the campaign. 

A small force will also be sufficient to garrison the posts 
in the Highlands, and prevent any danger there ; so that 
we shall be able to bring nearly the whole of the continen- 
tal army against Mr. Howe. The advantages of this are 
obvious. Should he be satisfied with the splendour of his 
acquisition, and shut himself up in Philadelphia, we can 
ruin him by confinement. Should he leave a garrison 
there, and go forward, we can either fall upon that or his 
main body, diminished as it will be by such a measure, 
with our whole force There will, however, be many dis- 
agreeable consequences attending such an event ; amongst 
which, the foremost is, the depreciation of our currency, 
which, from the importance in which Philadelphia is held, 
cannot fail to ensue. 

I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

ALEX. HAMILTON.

HAMILTON. 79 

A fragment of a letter written by him about this time 
to his venerable friend Doctor Knox, who warmly espou- 
sed the American cause, will be read with interest, as ex- 
hibiting more at large the prospects and views of policy 
which he entertained. 

" This event [the evacuation of Ticonderoga*] redounds 
very little to our credit. For, if the post was untenable, 
or required a larger number of troops to defend it than 
could be spared for the purpose, it ought long ago to have 
been foreseen and given up. Instead of that, we have kept 
a large quantity of cannon in it, and have been heaping up 
very valuable magazines of stores and provisions, that in 
the critical moment of defence are abandoned and lost. 
This affair will be attended with several evil consequences ; 
for, besides the loss of our stores, which we cannot well 
afford, it opens anew and easy door by which to penetrate the 
northern states. It will fix the hitherto fluctuating disposi- 
tion of the Indians in that quarter, in their favour, and ex- 
pose the frontiers of the adjacent country to their depreda- 
tions. But, though it is a misfortune we have reason to la- 
ment, I dare say it will be regarded with you as much 
more important than it really is, and as materially endanger- 
ing the success of our cause, which is by no means the case. 
Our opposition is at this time too well matured, and has too 
great stability to be shaken by an accident of that kind. 
While we have a respectable army in the field, and resources 

to feed, clothe, and arm them, we are safe We have had 

a force sufficient for the foregoing part of the campaign, to 
maintain such a superiority over the main army of the enemy 
as effectually to hinder them from attaining any of their pur- 
poses. And, to the northward, with the reinforcements 
sent up to succour the retreating garrison of Ticonderoga, 
and the militia flocking in from New-England, I think there 
is little doubt we have by this time a force adequate to give 

* July 5th, 1777. 



80 THB LIFE OF 

Mr. Burgoyne a seasonable check. One good effect will 
result from the misfortune, which is, that it will stimulate 
the eastern states to greater exertions than they might other- 
wise make. 

" By our last advices, the enemy were in possession of all 
the country between Ticonderoga and Fort George, and 
our army, nearly equal in number to them, were about to 
take post somewhere between Fort Edward and Saratoga. 

" The consequences of this northern affair will depend 
much upon the part that Howe acts. If he were to co-ope- 
rate with Burgoyne, it would demand our utmost efforts to 
counteract them. But, if he should go tow r ards the south- 
ward, all, or most of the advantages of Burgoyne's success 
will be lost. He will either be obliged to content himself 
with the possession of Ticonderoga, and the dependent for- 
tresses, and with carrying on a partizan war the rest of the 
campaign, or he must precipitate himself into certain ruin 
by attempting to advance in the country with a very in- 
competent force. 

" Appearances lead us to suppose that Howe is fool enough 
to meditate a southern expedition ; for he has now altered 
his station at Staten Island, mentioned above, and has fallen 
down to the Hook. Judging it morally certain that there 
would be a co-operation of the two armies, we thought it 
expedient to march northerly, and had accordingly reached 
within fourteen miles of New-Windsor, the place where we 
could cross the North river without danger of interruption. 
But this new movement of the enemy's fleet has induced us 
to return a few miles, and make a disposition for marching 
southerly. We shall, however, be cautious how we pro- 
ceed on that course, lest nothing more than a feint is intend- 
ed to divert us from the real object. 

" If they go to the southward in earnest, they must have 
the capture of Philadelphia in view, for there is no other 
sufficient inducement. We shall endeavour to get there in 



H A M I LTON. 81 

time to oppose them, and shall have the principal part of 
the continental force, and a large body of spirited militia, 
many of them from their services during the last campaign 
pretty well inured to arms to make the opposition with. 
Yet I would not have you to be much surprised if Philadel- 
phia should fall ; for the enemy will doubtless go there with 
a determination to succeed at all hazard, and we shall not 
be able to prevent them without risking a general action, the 
expediency of which will depend upon circumstances. If 
the militia turn out with that zeal we have a right to expect 
from their conduct when the enemy made their last experi- 
ment in the Jersies, and were supposed to be going to Phi- 
ladelphia, we may do it without much inconvenience. If 
they fall materially short of it, we shall be obliged to confine 
ourselves to a skirmishing opposition, which w r e cannot ex- 
pect will be effectual. It may be asked, if to avoid a gene- 
ral engagement we give up objects of the first importance, 
what is to hinder the enemy from carrying every important 
point, and ruining us ? My answer is, that our hopes are not 
placed in any particular city or spot of ground, but in the 
preserving a good army, furnished with proper necessaries 
to take advantage of favourable opportunities, and waste 
and defeat the enemy by piecemeal. Every new post they 
take requires a new division of their forces, and enables us 
to strike with our united force against a part of theirs ; and 
such is their present situation, that another Trenton affair 
will amount to a complete victory on our part, for they are 
at too low an ebb to bear another stroke of the kind. Per- 
haps before I may have an opportunity of ending this, facts 
will unfold what I am now endeavouring to anticipate by 
conjecture. 

" You will expect some animadversions on the temper 
and views of the French nation. I presume you are nearly 
as well acquainted with the assistance they are giving us, as 

VOL. I. 11 



82 THELIFEOF 

I am, both by their intrigues in foreign courts, and by sup- 
plies of every kind of warlike stores and apparatus. 

" It does not admit of a doubt that they are interested to 
wish us success ; and their conduct plainly shows they are 
willing to give us every aid essential to our preservation. 
But it is natural they should desire to do it with as much con- 
venience to themselves as they can. I apprehend they are 
not overfond of plunging themselves into awar with England 
if they can avoid it, and still answer the end they have to 
pursue ; and, indeed, from the evident reluctance shown on 
the part of the latter to do any thing that may bring about 
such an event, it becomes extremely difficult to draw her 
into it. The conclusion we may make is, that France will 
not wish to force England into a war, unless she finds our 
affairs require it absolutely : and England will not enter 
into one till she is compelled to do it. 

" My best respects to all friends ; and I beg you will be- 
lieve me to be with unabated regard, 
" Dear sir, 

" Your most obedient servant, 

"A. HAMILTON." 

From the time which elapsed since the British fleet was 
seen off the Capes of the Delaware, there was reason to in- 
fer that a more remote expedition than Philadelphia was hi 
view, and it became an important question what destination 
to give to the American forces. 

Two projects promised great advantages: either an 
attack upon New- York, or a rapid movement on the Hud- 
son, to check the advance of Burgoyne. The importance 
of this step, induced Washington to call a council of w r ar, 
who unanimously concurred in advising the latter object ; 
and on the twenty-first of August, Hamilton was despatch- 
ed to congress, to confer with that body, and communicate 



HAMILTON. 83 

their sentiments to the commander-in-chief ; the result of 
which interview was anticipated in the preceding letter. 

Intelligence of the enemy's fleet near the Capes of Vir- 
ginia, determined the question. Washington immediately 
pushed forward to Pennsylvania, and crossing the Delaware, 
established himself on the Forks of the Brandywine, to re- 
lard their progress to Philadelphia, the chief object of all 
Howe's movements. 

The battle which ensued, owing to a successful feint of 
the British, and a judicious movement of Cornwallis, was 
little creditable to the American arms ; but it was a con- 
test between new raised levies, concentrated for a moment, 
and then ready to disperse, intimidated by crowds of fugi- 
tives, who, with imaginations filled with the recitals of the 
cruelties which had been suffered in New-Jersey, deserted 
their homes, and were seen flying in every direction, spread- 
ing a panic throughout the adjacent country, and a disci- 
plined body of fifteen thousand veterans, armed at all points, 
and confident of victory, and yet it was an action in the open 
field, and by no means decisive. 

The supineness of the British commander, who never 
knew how to use a victory, again permitted the Americans 
to make good their retreat. They retired to Chester, whence 
crossing the Schuylkill, they moved on to Swedes Ford, 
within sixteen miles of Philadelphia, where they recrossed 
the river, and came into a position for a second engage- 
ment. There, as the van of the armies met, a violent storm 
arose and dispersed the combatants. As Howe was about 
to cross the Schuylkill on his march to Philadelphia, an in- 
cident occurred full of imminent peril to the subject of this 
memoir. Directly in the route of the British, at a short 
distance in their advance, a quantity of flour had been 
stored, which it was thought important to destroy ; for this 
perilous service Colonel Hamilton went forward, attended 
by Captain Lee, (an officer already eminently distinguish- 



84 THELIFEOF 

ed for his gallantry and enterprise,) with a small party 
of horse. The approach to the mills was by a road de- 
scending a long hill to a bridge over the Schuylkill. On 
the summit of this hill two videttes were posted, to give 
intelligence of the enemy's advance. Soon after the party 
reached the mills, Hamilton secured a flat bottomed boat, 
by which he could effect his escape should the enemy over- 
take them ; a few moments showed the necessity of this 
precaution. While thus occupied, the videttes gave the 
alarm ; four of the dragoons, with Hamilton, jumped into 
the boat, and the enemy's horse came clattering down the 
hill, just in the rear of the flying videttes. Lee, hoping to 
regain the bridge, trusted to his horse. This diverted the 
pursuing party for a moment, and Hamilton, struggling 
against the furious current of the river, swoln by the recent 
tempest, gained the shore in safety, though vollies, which 
were returned at intervals, were poured into the boat, by 
which three of the party were wounded. Lee, equally for- 
tunate, owed his escape to the fleetness of his horse. 

The British continued to advance towards the capital, 
which it was impossible to save. During their slow pro- 
gress, Hamilton was despatched to Philadelphia by Wash- 
ington ; on his approach to which, as appears from the 
following letter, he was a second time exposed to a surprise. 

TO THE HONOURABLE JOHN HANCOCK, PRESIDENT 
. OF CONGRESS. 

September 18th, 1777, 9 o'clock at night. 
SIR, 

I did myself the honour to write you a hasty line this even- 
ing, giving it as my opinion that the city was no longer a place 
of safety for you. I write you again lest that letter should 
not get to hand. The enemy are on the road to Swedes 
Ford, the main body about four miles from it. They sent a 
party this evening to Daviser's ferry, which fired upon me and 



HAMILTON. 85 

some others in crossing it, killed one man, wounded another, 
and disabled my horse. 

They came on so suddenly, that one boat was left adrift 
on the other side, which will of course fall into their hands, 
and by the help of that, they will get possession of another, 
which was abandoned by those who had the direction of it, 
and left afloat, in spite of every thing that I could do to the 
contrary. These two boats will convey fifty men across at 
a time, so that in a few hours they may throw over a large 
party, perhaps sufficient to overmatch the militia who may be 
between them and the city. This renders the situation of 
congress extremely precarious, if they are not on their guard : 
my apprehensions for them are great, though it is not impro- 
bable they may not be realized. 

The most cogent reasons oblige me to join the army this 
night, or I should have waited upon you myself. I am in 
hopes our army will be up with the enemy before they pass 
Schuylkill ; if they are, something serious will ensue. 
I have the honour to be, 
With much respect, 

Sir, your most obedient, 
A. HAMILTON. 

Soon after his return to camp, he was again directed to re- 
turn to Philadelphia, to concert future measures with some of 
the members of congress, to execute the unpleasant task of 
impressing the property of the citizens, and to superintend 
the collection of stores, and its embarkation in the shipping. 

This duty was performed in a manner highly satisfactory 
to the commander-in-chief, in whose name Colonel Hamilton 
addressed a letter to the ladies of that city, enforcing upon 
them the claims of their country, of which he spoke as the 
most successful of his youthful productions. 

On his arrival at Philadelphia, he addressed a letter, dated 
the 22d September, to the President of Congress, stating, 



86 THELIFEOF 

" I left camp last evening, and came to this city to superintend 
the collection of blankets and clothing for the army. Mr. 
Lovell sends to inform me there is an express going off to con- 
gress, and I do myself the honour to communicate a brief state 
of things when I left camp. The enemy moved yesterday 
from where they lay opposite to Valley Forge, &c. higher up 
the river, on their old scheme of gaining our right. I don't 
know precisely where they halted, but our army was prepa- 
ring to move up also to counteract them. 

"I am this morning told they marched about twelve o'clock 
at night for that purpose. The general opinion was, that the 
enemy would attempt crossing this day, every appearance 
justified the supposition. 

" We had intelligence that the enemy had the night before 
last surprised Generals Smallwood and Wayne, and conse- 
quently dispersed them, after a small opposition. The loss, it 
is said, was not great, and our troops were re-assembling fast 
at the Red Lion. This seems to have been a bad look out, 
and is somewhat disconcerting. 

" By a letter from General McDougal, received this morn- 
ing, it appears he was on the 20th, in the morning, at Second 
river, just setting out on his march towards Woodbridge. He 
is pressing forward with all possible expedition. The troops 
were pretty well refreshed, and in good spirits." 

Finding all resistance vain, the Americans took post sixteen 
miles from Philadelphia, in a strong situation, on the eastern 
side of the Schuylkill, covered by a stream known as the 
Skippach creek. 

Sir William Howe meanwhile crossed that river with his 
army, and having ordered Cornwallis to take possession of 
the city, encamped at Germantown. 

Each position was taken with reference to the fortifications 
which had been erected on the Delaware, with immense la- 
bour, under the eye of Du Portail,who was soon after appoint- 
ed a general of brigade. 



HAMILTON. 87 

Howe, considering the removal of these obstructions essen- 
tial to his security, weakened his army by detachments for 
that purpose. Washington, strengthened by a reinforcement 
from Maryland, and by McDougal's brigade from New- York, 
regarded this as a favourable moment to surprise the enemy. 
The battle of Germantown ensued. The surprise was less 
complete than had been hoped, and after a vigorous onset, in 
which the divisions under Wayne and Sullivan displayed the 
greatest gallantry, the Americans were compelled to retreat. 
The object was not, however, wholly unattained. The army 
had felt the importance of an action; an impression was made 
on their adversary, that even in a close engagement, without 
the advantage of ground, the gallantry and discipline of this 
inferior force was a just object of vigilance. The common 
sentiment of the country called for the attempt, and such was 
its influence on the mind of General Howe, that within two 
days after the attack, he drew in his lines, and retreating to 
Philadelphia, permitted the Americans to remain within his 
reach, without any serious molestation. 



CHAPTER VI. 

[1777.] 

WHILE the main army was thus employed in resisting the 
attempts on Philadelphia, events of the utmost importance had 
occurred on the northern frontier. On the day of Hamilton's 
appointment to the staff, he addressed, in the name of Gene- 
ral Washington, an urgent letter to the committee of New- 
York, incidentally mentioning the difficulty of supplying the 
troops with arms, from the practice which had prevailed 
among the militia of taking them with them when their terms 
of service expired ; and endeavouring to impress upon the 
state the necessity of the most unwearied activity in arming 
their quotas, he then replies to an application for reinforce- 
ments at the north, " that the advanced season of the year 
renders an attack upon Ticonderoga over the ice not so much 
to be feared as to induce him to provide against a possible in- 
convenience there, at the expense of not guarding effectually 
against a certain one here, wherefore I have determined to 
send no more battalions to that place, having ordered a suffi- 
cient force from the east." 

This unavoidable decision of the commander-in-chief, ex- 
cited the greatest alarm among the inhabitants of New- York, 
and led them to wait, with the most eager anxiety, the march 
of the eastern troops. 

The hostile feelings which had been nourished among the 
Dutch population towards their eastern neighbours, were now 
carried to the highest point. 

Engaged in a common conflict, the people of New- York 
regarded the tardy measures of New-England as proceeding 
from a fixed determination to surrender them an easy prey 
to the enemy, relying on their dense population for their 
own security, and shunning a warfare so remote, and attend- 
ed with so many hardships. Hence proceeded the most 

VOL, I. 12 



90 THELIFEOF 

gloomy alarms, followed by embittered rancour. In a letter 
from Governor Clinton, it is stated, " that Connecticut and 
Massachusetts have not furnished a man for the southern de- 
partment ; nay, scarcely answered the letters sent to them. 
General Gates is ordered to take the command of the north- 
ern army, and General Schuyler to join General Washing- 
ton. The New-England men will now be gratified, and 
ought to turn out, but I fear they will not behave better un- 
der any command. 

" The New- York militia have turned out with the greatest 
alacrity and spirit, leaving their harvests in the fields." 

In a letter from the Albany committee, it is mentioned, "our 
affairs grow more gloomy every day. The New-England 
states are still indifferent to all entreaty. All the militia of 
Albany are sent to the army. The people in Schoharie say 
they must lay down their arms if Albany falls. Only two 
hundred savages have driven in the inhabitants within fifty 
miles. What would be the case if a thousand are let loose ? 
Trumbull writes that no aid is to be expected from Connecti- 
cut." In another communication, the delegates from New- 
York write, " General Gates is far from partial to our state ; 
you cannot be at a loss for the reason. Our revolters* seem 
to possess his esteem here, and he has left a most extraordi- 
nary recommendation in their favour." 

About the same time, the council of Albany prepared a 
declaration, (stating "the pain it gave them to find that a mea- 
sure so absurd and probably chimerical as the surrender of 
Ticonderoga, should be imputed to the directions of General 
Schuyler" in whose zeal, vigilance,and integrity, they express 
the highest confidence,) which they addressed to General 
Putnam, enclosing an extract from a letter of General Schuy- 
ler, from Fort Edward, of the ninth of July, expressing his 
astonishment at the conduct of the officers who had evacuated 
that post. 

* The people of Vermont. 



HAMILTON. 91 

These contemporary monuments of history evince, in a 
strong light, the alarming condition of affairs in New- York, 
where the people were unable to stifle their deep-rooted hos- 
tility to their New-England neighbours, and where state pride 
looked with indignation at the decision which had supplanted 
their most popular chief, who, perhaps, entered too warmly 
into the local feelings of his state, to make room for an indi- 
vidual, whose capacity was distrusted by men of discernment, 
and whose title to command was deemed the more invidious, 
as being founded on his popularity with a community with 
whom they had long been engaged in territorial disputes. 

This scene of discord produced deep dismay at head quar- 
ters, where the necessity of silencing all local differences had 
been among the most important, as it was the most difficult 
of duties. 

While the imminent danger which menaced the army un- 
der his immediate command, would seem to have required 
all his care, Washington failed in none of the great trusts of 
his high station, but with that presiding superiority and high 
tone of mind which distinguished him, he is seen stemming 
the tide of discontent around him, cheering the faltering 
spirits of congress, stimulating the then sluggish councils of 
New-England, and, at the same time, soothing the alarms of 
the unhappy sufferers of New-York. The following letter, 
written by Hamilton at his instance, and addressed to the 
committee of that state, is a highly interesting exhibition of 
the temper of his patriotic mind. 

Head Quarters, Philadelphia, August 4th, 1777. 

I have been duly honoured by your several favours of the 
25th, 27th, and 30th of July. The misfortune at Ticonde- 
roga, has produced a very disagreeable alteration in our af- 
fairs, and has thrown a gloom upon the favourable prospect 
which the campaign previous to that event afforded. But I 
am in great hopes, the ill consequences of it will not continue 



92 TIIEMFEOF 

to operate long, and that the jealousies and alarms which so 
sudden and unexpected an accident has occasioned in the 
minds of the people both of your state and to the eastward, 
will shortly subside, and give way to the more rational dic- 
tates of self-preservation and regard to the common good. 
In fact, the worst effect of that disaster is, that it has served 
to create those distrusts and apprehensions ; for if the mat- 
ter were coolly and dispassionately considered, there would 
be found nothing so formidable in Mr. Burgoyne, and the 
force under him, with all his successes, as to countenance 
the least languor or despondency, and experience would 
show that a tolerable degree of vigour in the states more 
immediately interested, would be sufficient to check his 
career, and perhaps convert the advantages he has gained 
into his ruin. But while people continue to view what has 
happened through the medium of supineness or fear, there is 
no saying to what length an enterprising genius may push 
his good fortune. I have the fullest confidence that no en- 
deavours of the council will be omitted to bring your state 
(with the distresses of which I am sensibly affected,) to every 
effort it is capable of making in its present mutilated condi- 
tion, and they may rely upon it no means in my power will 
be unemployed to co-operate with them in repelling the dan- 
ger that threatens the state, and through it the continent. 
If I do not give as essential aid as might be wished to the 
northern army, it is not from want of inclination, nor from 
being too little impressed with the importance of doing it. 
It would be the height of impolicy to weaken ourselves too 
much here, in order to increase our strength there, and it must 
certainly be more difficult, as well as of greater moment, to 
control the main army of the enemy, than an inferior, and, I 
may say, dependent one ; for it is pretty obvious, if General 
Howe can be completely kept at bay, and prevented effect- 
ing any capital purposes, the successes of General Burgoyne, 
whatever they may be, must be partial and temporary. 



HAMILTON. 93 

Nothing that I can do shall be wanting to rouse the east- 
ern states, and excite them to those exertions which the exi- 
gency of our affairs so urgently demands. I lament that they 
have not yet done more, that so few of their militia have 
come into the field, and that those few have been so precipi- 
tate in returning home at this critical period ; but I have, 
nevertheless, great reliance upon those states. I know they 
are capable of powerful efforts, and that their attachment to 
the cause, notwithstanding they may be a little tardy, will not 
allow them long to withhold their aid, at a time when their 
own safety, and that of a sister state, and, in a great measure, 
the safety of the continent, calls for their greatest zeal and 
activity. 

I flatter myself the presence of General Arnold and Ge- 
neral Lincoln in the Northern Department will have a happy 
effect upon them. Those gentlemen possess much of their 
confidence, particularly the latter, than whom there is, per- 
haps, no man from the state of Massachusetts, who enjoys 
more universal esteem and popularity. And in addition to 
that, they are both to be considered as very valuable officers. 
You intimate a wish that some assistance could be drawn 
from the southern states at this time. But while things re- 
main in their present posture, and appearances, however 
illusory they may prove in the issue, afford the strongest rea- 
son to keep their force at home, to counteract the seeming 
intentions of General Howe, I could neither ask nor expect 
them to detach succours to the northern states, who are so 
well able to defend themselves against the force they now 
have to oppose. 

I hope an exaggerated idea of the enemy's numbers may 
have no injurious influence on our measures. There is no 
circumstance I am acquainted with that induces me to be- 
lieve General Burgoyne can have more than five or six 
thousand men; and if the force left in Canada is so consi- 
derable as the information you send me makes it, he can- 



94 THELIFEOF 

not have even so many. The representations of prisoners 
and deserters in this respect are of little validity ; their 
knowledge is always very limited, and their intentions, par- 
ticularly the former, very often bad. 

Beyond what regards their own companies, little or no 
attention is due to what they say ; the number of regi- 
ments your informant mentions corresponds with other 
accounts ; but the number of men in each company he 
gives the establishment, is not, I am persuaded, their actual 
state. The enemy's army in Canada last campaign, though 
they suffered little by action, must have decreased mate- 
rially by sickness and other casualties ; and if the recruits 
to them, both from England and Germany bore any pro- 
portion to those which have reinforced General Howe, the 
state of their regiments must be greatly inferior to what 
your information holds forth. ******** 

The appointment of General Clinton to the government 
of your state, is an event that, in itself, gives me great plea- 
sure, and very much abates the regret I should otherwise 
feel for the loss of his services in the military line. That 
gentleman's character is such, as will make him peculiarly 
useful at the head of your affairs, in a situation so alarming 
and interesting as that which you now experience. 

These paternal councils had the happiest effect in silen- 
cing the jealousies which prevailed at Albany, where the 
arm of the government was invigorated by the personal 
energy of Clinton. 

Schuyler, by a series of masterly movements, and by in- 
terposing innumerable obstacles, delayed the progress of 
the enemy, weakened by the diversions of Stark at the 
east, and Willet at the west. The eastern troops, convinced 
of their common interest in repelling the invasion of that 
state, poured in to the aid of New- York; and while the ad- 
vance of Burgoyne was looked upon with consternation, by 



HAMILTON. 95 

a series of unparalleled sufferings which no energy could 
surmount, he was gradually broken down, until a brief con- 
test compelled him to surrender at Saratoga ; an event 
which, maturing the confidence that the battle of German- 
town had inspired in the councils of France, confirmed her 
determination openly to espouse the cause of the United 
States. 

Intelligence of this event reached the head-quarters of 
Washington at the close of the month of October, a few days 
after his army had removed to Whitemarsh, and he immedi- 
ately addressed a letter to Gates, in which, after congratula- 
ting him on his success, and expressing his regret " that a 
matter of such magnitude should have reached him by report 
only, or through the chance of letters, instead of an authen- 
tic communication under his own signature," he says, " Our 
affairs having terminated to the northward, I have, by the 
advice of the general officers, sent Colonel Hamilton, one of 
my aids, to lay before you a full state of our situation, and 
that of the enemy in this quarter. He is well-informed up- 
on the subject, and will deliver my sentiments upon the 
plan of operations that is now necessary to be pursued. I 
think it improper to enter into a detail. From Colonel Ha- 
milton, you will have a clear and comprehensive view of 
things ; and I persuade myself you will do every thing in 
your power to facilitate the objects I have in contempla- 
tion." On the 30th of October Colonel Hamilton departed 
under the following instructions : 

WASHINGTON TO HAMILTON. 

Head Quarters, Philadelphia county, 30th Oct. 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

It having been judged expedient by the members of a 
council of war held yesterday, that one of the gentlemen of 
my family should be sent to General Gates, in order to lay 
before him the state of this army and the situation of the ene- 



06 THE LIFE OF 

my, and to point out to him the many happy consequences 
that will accrue from an immediate reinforcement being sent 
from the northern army, I have thought it proper to appoint 
you to that duty, and desire that you will immediately set 
out for Albany, at which place, or in the neighbourhood, I 
imagine you will find General Gates. 

You are so fully acquainted with the principal points on 
which you are sent, namely, the state of our army and the 
situation of the enemy, that I shall not enlarge on those heads. 
What you are chiefly to attend to, is to point out in the clear- 
est and fullest manner to General Gates, the absolute neces- 
sity that there is for his detaching a very considerable part 
of the army at present under his command to the reinforce- 
ment of this ; a measure that will in all probability reduce 
General Howe to the same situation in which General Bur- 
goyne now is, should he attempt to remain in Philadelphia 
without being able to remove the obstructions in the Dela- 
ware, and open a free communication with his shipping. The 
force which the members of the council of war judge it safe 
and expedient to draw down at present, are the three New- 
Hampshire and fifteen Massachusetts regiments, with Lee's 
and Jackson's two of the sixteen, additional. But it is more than 
probable that General Gates may have detained part of those 
troops to the reduction of Ticonderoga, should the enemy not 
have evacuated it, or to the garrisoning of it. If they should, in 
that case the reinforcement will be according to circumstan- 
ces ; but, if possible, let it be made up to the same number 
out of other corps. If upon your meeting with General 
Gates, you should find that he intends, in consequence of his 
success, to employ the troops under his command upon some 
expedition, by the prosecution of which the common cause 
will be more benefitted than by their being sent down to re- 
inforce this army, it is not my wish to give any interruption 
to the plan. But if he should have nothing more in contem- 
plation than those particular objects which I have mentioned 



HAMILTON. 97 

to you, and which it is unnecessary to commit to paper, in 
that case you are to inform him that it is my desire that the 
reinforcements before mentioned, or such part of them as 
can be safely spared, be immediately put in motion to join 
the army. 

I have understood that General Gates has already de- 
tached Nixon's and Glover's brigades to join General Put- 
nam, and General Dickinson informs me, Sir Henry Clin- 
ton has come down the river with his whole force ; if this 
be a fact, you are to desire General Putnam to send the two 
brigades forward with the greatest expedition, as there can 
be no occasion for them there. 

I expect you will meet Colonel Morgan's corps upon their 
way down; if you do, let them know how essential their 
services are to us, and desire the Colonel or commanding 
officer to hasten their march as much as is consistent with 
the health of the men after their late fatigues. 

G. W. 

P. S. I ordered the detachment belonging to General 
McDougal's division to come forward. If you meet them, 
direct those belonging to Greene's, Angel's, Chandler's, and 
Duryee's regiments not to cross Delaware, but to proceed 
to Red Bank. 

Colonel Hamilton proceeded by way of New- Windsor to 
Fishkill, the head quarters of General Putnam, from whence 
he addressed the following letter to General Washington, 
on the second of November. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
DEAR SIR, 

I lodged last night in the neighbourhood of New- Wind- 
sor. This morning early I met Colonel Morgan with his 
corps, about a mile from it, in march for head quarters. I 

VOL. i. 13 



98 THE LIFE OF 

told him the necessity of making all the despatch he could, 
so as not to fatigue his men too much, which he has pro- 
mised to do. 

I understood from Colonel Morgan, that all the northern 
army were marching down on both sides the river, and 
would, probably, be to-morrow at New-Windsor and this 
place ; and that General Putnam had held a council for 
the general disposition of them, in which it was resolved to 
send you four thousand men, and to keep the rest on this 
side the river. I came here in expectation that matters 
were in such a train as to enable me to accomplish my 
errand without going any farther, unless it should be to 
hasten the troops that were on their march ; but on my 
arrival, I learned from Mr. Hughes, an aid-de-camp of Ge- 
neral Gates, that the following disposition of the northern 
army had taken place. 

General Patterson's, Glover's, and Nixon's brigades and 
Colonel Warner's mountain boys to remain in and about 
Albany, barracks building for them. General Poor's 
brigade marching down this side of the river to join Gene- 
ral Putnam, will be here probably to-morrow. General 
Learned's brigade, Morgan's corps, Warner's brigade of 
Massachusetts militia, and some regiments of New- York 
militia, on their march on the west side of the river. 

I have directed General Putnam, in your name, to send 
forward with all despatch to join you, the two continental 
brigades and Warner's militia brigade ; this last is to serve 
till the latter end of this month. Your instructions did not 
comprehend any militia, but as there are certain accounts 
here that most of the troops from New- York are gone to 
reinforce General Howe, and as so large a proportion of 
continental troops have been detained at Albany, I conclu- 
ded you would not disapprove of a measure calculated to 
strengthen you, though but for a small time, and have ven- 
tured to adopt it on that presumption. 



HAMILTON. 99 

Being informed by General Putnam, that General Wynds, 
with seven hundred Jersey militia was, at King's Ferry, with 
intention to cross to Peekskill, I prevailed upon him to re- 
linquish that idea, and send off an immediate order for them 
to march towards Red Bank. It is possible, however, un- 
less your excellency supports this order by an application 
from yourself, he may march his men home, instead of march- 
ing them to the place he has been directed to repair to. 

Neither Lee's, Jackson's regiments, nor the detachments 
belonging to General McDougal's division have yet march- 
ed. I have urged their being sent, and an order has been 
despatched for their instantly proceeding. Colonel Hughes 
is pressing some fresh horses for me. The moment they 
are ready, I shall recross the river in order to fall in with 
the troops on the other side, and make all the haste I can 
to Albany to get the three brigades there sent forward. 

Will your excellency permit me to observe, that I have 
some doubts, under present circumstances and appearances, 
of the propriety of leaving the regiments proposed to be left 
in this quarter ? But if my doubts on this subject were 
stronger than they are, I am forbid, by the sense of council, 
from interfering in the matter. 

General Poor's brigade is just arrived here ; they will 
proceed to join you with all expedition. So strongly am I 
impressed with the importance of endeavouring to crush 
Mr. Howe, that I am apt to think it would be advisable 
to draw off all the continental troops. Had this been de- 
termined on, General Warner's sixteen hundred militia 
might have been left here. 

I have the honour to be, 

With the warmest esteem and respect, 
Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 



100 THE LIFE OF 

On Hamilton's arrival at Albany, he had an interview 
with General Gates, the result of which is stated in the 
following letter to General Washington. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

Albany, November, 1777. 
DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here yesterday at noon, and waited upon Ge- 
neral Gates immediately On the business of my mission, but 
was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours, 
for drawing off the number of troops you directed. I used 
every argument in my power to convince him of the pro- 
priety of the measure, but he was inflexible in the opinion 
that two brigades at least of continental troops should re- 
main in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having gone to join 
Howe was not sufficiently authenticated to put it out of 
doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his return- 
ing up the river, which might expose the finest arsenal in 
America (as he calls the one here,) to destruction, should 
this place be left so bare of troops as I proposed, and that 
the want of conveniences and the difficulty of the roads 
would make it impossible to remove artillery and stores 
for a considerable time ; that the New-England states would 
be left open to the depredations and ravages of the enemy ; 
that it would put it out of his power to enterprise any thing 
against Ticonderoga, which he thinks might be done in the 
winter, and which he considers it of importance to under- 
take. 

The force of these reasons did by no means strike me ; 
and I did every thing in my power to show they were un- 
substantial ; but all I could effect was to have one brigade 
despatched in addition to those already marched. I found 
myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. 
I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as pos- 



HAMILTON. 101 

sible ; but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconve- 
niences in acting diametrically opposite to the opinion of a 
gentleman whose successes have raised him to the high- 
est importance. 

General Gates has won the entire confidence of the east- 
ern states. If disposed to do it, by addressing himself to 
the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which it might be said with plau- 
sibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose 
them to unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding their exer- 
tions during the campaign had given them the fullest title 
to repose and security. General Gates has influence and 
interest elsewhere ; he might use it, if he pleased, to dis- 
credit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared 
to me dangerous to insist on sending more troops from hence, 
while General Gates appeared so warmly opposed to it. 
Should any accident or inconvenience happen in conse- 
quence of it, there would be too fair a pretext for censure, 
and many people are too well disposed to lay hold of it. 
At any rate, it might be considered as using him ill, to take 
a step so contrary to his judgment in a case of this nature. 
These considerations, and others which I shall be more ex- 
plicit in when I have the pleasure of seeing you, determin- 
ed me not to insist upon sending either of the other bri- 
gades remaining here. I am afraid what I have done may 
not meet with your approbation, as not being perhaps fully 
warranted by your instructions ; but I ventured to do what 
I thought right, hoping that at least the goodness of my in- 
tention will excuse the error of my judgment. 

I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, as I 
had directed to be sent on two thousand militia which were 
not expected by you, and a thousand continental troops out 
of those proposed to be left with General Putnam, which I 
have written to him since I found how matters were cir- 
cumstanced here, to forward to you with all despatch. I 



102 THE LIFE OF 

did this for several reasons : because your reinforcement 
would be more expeditious from that place than from this ; 
because two thousand continental troops at Peekskill will 
not be wanted in its present circumstances, especially as 
it was really necessary to have a body of continental troops 
at this place for the security of the valuable stores here, 
and I should not, if I had my wish, think it expedient to 
draw off more than two of the three brigades now here. 

This being the case, one of the ends you proposed to be 
answered, by leaving the ten regiments with General Put- 
nam, will be equally answered by the troops here ; I mean 
that of covering and fortifying the eastern states, and one 
thousand continental troops in addition to the militia collect- 
ed and that may be collected here, will be sufficient in the 
Highlands for covering the country down that way, and 
carrying on the works necessary to be raised for the de- 
fence of the river. 

The troops gone and going to reinforce you are near five 
thousand rank and file continental troops, and two thousand 
five hundred Massachusetts and New-Hampshire militia. 
These, and the seven hundred Jersey militia, will be a lar- 
ger reinforcement than you expected, though not quite an 
equal number of continental troops, nor exactly in the way 
directed. General Lincoln tells me the militia are very ex- 
cellent, and though their times will be out by the last of this 
month, you will be able, if you think proper, to order the 
troops still remaining here,to join you by the time their term 
of service expires. 

I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct should 
prove displeasing to you, but I have done what, consider- 
ing all circumstances, appeared to me most eligible and pru- 
dent. Vessels are preparing to carry the brigade to New- 
Windsor, which will embark this evening. I shall, this 
afternoon, set out on my return to camp, and on my way 
shall endeavour to hasten the troops forward. 



HAMILTON. 103 

Disappointed in the orders issued by General Gates, Ha- 
milton, in pursuance of the requisition of the commander- 
in-chief, addressed him on the 5th November, prior to his 
departure from Albany, in the following decisive tone. 

COLONEL HAMILTON TO GENERAL GATES. 

Albany, November 5, 1777. 
SIR, 

By inquiry, I have learned that General Patterson's bri- 
gade, which is the one you propose to send, is by far the 
weakest of the three now here, and does not consist of more 
than about six hundred rank and file fit for duty. It is 
true, that there is a militia regiment with it of about two 
hundred, but the time of service for which this regiment is 
engaged is so near expiring, that it would be past by the 
time the men could arrive at their destination. 

Under these circumstances, I cannot consider it either as 
compatible with the good of the service, or my instructions 
from his excellency General Washington, to consent that 
that brigade be selected from the three to go to him, but I 
am under the necessity of desiring, by virtue of my orders 
from him, that one of the others be substituted instead of 
this, either General Nixon's or General Glover's, and that 
you will be pleased to give immediate orders for its embar- 
kation. 

Knowing that General Washington wished me to pay the 
greatest deference to your judgment, I ventured so far to 
deviate from the instructions he gave me, as to consent, in 
compliance with your opinion, that two brigades should 
remain here instead of one. At the same time, permit me 
to observe, that I am not myself sensible of the expediency 
of keeping more than one, with the detached regiments in 
the neighbourhood of this place, and that my ideas coincide 
with those gentlemen whom I have consulted on the occa- 
sion, whose judgment I have much more reliance upon than 



104 THE LIFE OF 

on my own, and who must be supposed to have a thorough 
knowledge of all the circumstances. Their opinion is, that 
one brigade and the regiments before mentioned would 
amply answer the purposes of this post. When I prefer- 
red your opinion to other considerations, I did not imagine 
you would pitch upon a brigade little more than half as 
large as the others, and finding this to be the case, I indis- 
pensably owe it to my duty to desire, in his excellency's 
name, that another may go instead of the one intended, and 
without loss of time. As it may be conducive to despatch 
to send Glover's brigade, if agreeable to you, you will give 
orders accordingly. 

On the receipt of this letter, General Gates gave the or- 
der, and soon after wrote to General Washington, stating 
as his reason for not having readily complied with the re- 
quest made to him, an apprehension that the forces at Peeks- 
kill could not prevent the enemy from destroying the city of 
Albany and the arsenal, and that he was entirely averse 
from sending more than one brigade, lest every good effect 
of the ruin of Burgoyne's army should be totally lost by the 
possession of that town. 

Colonel Hamilton having concluded his mission to Gene- 
ral Gates, returned to New- Windsor, whence, on the 10th 
November, he addressed the commander-in-chief to this 
effect. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
DEAR SIR, 

I arrived here last night from Albany. Having given 
General Gates a little time to recollect himself, I renewed 
my remonstrance on the necessity and propriety of sending 
you more than one brigade of the three he had detained 
with him, and finally prevailed upon him to give orders 



HAMILTON. 105 

for Glover's in addition to Patterson's brigade to march 
this way. 

As it was thought conducive to expedition to send the 
troops by water as far as it could be done, I procured all 
the vessels that could be had at Albany fit for the purpose, 
but could not get more than sufficient to take Patterson's 
brigade. It was embarked the 7th instant, but the wind has 
been contrary ; they must probably be here to-day. Ge- 
neral Glover's brigade marched at the same time, on the 
east side of the river, the roads being much better than on 
this side. I am this moment informed, that one sloop with 
a part of Patterson's has arrived, and that the others are in 
sight. They will immediately proceed by water to King's 
Ferry, and thence take the shortest route. 

I am pained beyond expression to inform your excellency 
that on my arrival here, I find every thing has been neg- 
lected and deranged by General Putnam, and that the two 
brigades, Poor's and Learned's, still remain here and on the 
other side of the river at Fishkill. Colonel Warner's mili- 
tia, I am told, have been drawn to Peekskill, to aid in an ex- 
pedition against New-York, which it seems is, at this time, 
the hobby-horse with General Putnam. Not the least at- 
tention has been paid to my order in your name for a de- 
tachment of one thousand men from the troops hitherto sta- 
tioned at this post. Every thing is sacrificed to the whim 
of taking New- York. 

The two brigades of Poor and Learned, it appears, would 
not march for want of money and necessaries ; several of 
the regiments having received no pay for six or eight 
months past. There has been a high mutiny among the 
former on this account, in which a captain killed a man, 
and was himself shot by his comrade. These difficulties, 
for want of proper management, have stopped the troops 
from proceeding. Governor Clinton has been the only 
man who has done any thing towards removing them, but 

VOL. i. 14 



106 THE LIFE OF 

for want of General Putnam's co-operation, has not been 
able to effect it. He has only been able to prevail with 
Learned's brigade to agree to march to Goshen, in hopes 
by getting them once on the go, to induce them to continue 
their march. On coming here, I immediately sent for Co- 
lonel Bailey, who now commands Learned's brigade, and 
persuaded him to engage to carry the brigade on to head 
quarters as fast as possible. This he expects to effect by 
means of five or six thousand dollars, which Governor Clin- 
ton was kind enough to borrow for me, and which Colonel 
Bailey thinks will keep the men in good humour till they 
join you. They marched this morning towards Goshen. 

I shall, as soon as possible, see General Poor, and do 
every thing in my power to get him along, and hope I shall 
be able to succeed. 

The plan I before laid having been totally deranged, a 
new one has become necessary. It is now too late to send 
Warner's militia ; by the time they reached you, their term 
of service would be out. The motive for sending them, 
which was to give you a speedy reinforcement has, by the 
past delay, been superseded. 

By Governor Clinton's advice, I have sent an order in the 
most emphatical terms to General Putnam, immediately to 
despatch all the continental troops under him to your assist- 
ance, and to detain the militia instead of them. 

My opinion is, that the only present use for troops in this 
quarter is, to protect the country from the depredations of 
little plundering parties, and for carrying on the works ne- 
cessary for the defence of the river. Nothing more ought 
to be thought of. 'Tis only wasting time and misapplying 
men to employ them in a suicidal parade against New- 
York, for in this it wil undoubtedly terminate. New- 
York is no object, if it could be taken, and to take it would 
require more men than could be spared from more substan- 
tial purposes. Governor Clinton's ideas coincide with mine. 



HAMILTON. 107 

He thinks that there is no need of more continental troops 
here than a few to give a spur to the militia in working 
upon the fortifications. In pursuance of this, I have given 
the directions before mentioned. If General Putnam at- 
tends to them, the troops under him may be with you nearly 
as early as any of the others, (though he has unluckily 
marched them down to Tarrytown,) and General Glover's 
brigade, when it gets up, will be more than sufficient to 
answer the true end of this post. 

If your excellency agrees with me in opinion, it will be 
well to send instant directions to General Putnam to pur- 
sue the object I have mentioned, for I doubt whether he will 
attend to any thing I shall say, notwithstanding it comes in 
the shape of a positive order. I fear unless you interpose, 
the works here will go on so feebly for want of men, that 
they will not be completed in time ; whereas, it appears to 
me of the greatest importance they should be pushed with 
the utmost vigour. Governor Clinton will do every thing 
in his power. I wish General Putnam was recalled from 
the command of this post, and Governor Clinton would ac- 
cept it : the blunders and caprices of the former are end- 
less. Believe me, sir, no body can be more impressed with 
the importance of forwarding the reinforcements coming 
to you with all speed, nor could any body have endeavour- 
ed to promote it more than I have done ; but the ignorance 
of some, and the design of others, have been almost insu- 
perable obstacles. I am very unwell, but I shall not spare 
myself to get things immediately in a proper train, and for 
that purpose intend, unless I receive other orders from you, 
to continue with the troops in the progress of their march. 
As soon as I get General Poor's brigade in march, I shall 
proceed to General Putnam's at Peekskill. 

On the twelfth of November, he addressed another let- 
ter to General Washington, in which he says, " I have been 



108 THE LIFE OF 

detained here these two days by a fever and violent rheu- 
matic pains throughout my body. This has prevented my 
being active in person for promoting the purposes of my 
errand, but I have taken every other method in my power, 
in which Governor Clinton has obligingly given me all the 
aid he could. In answer to my pressing application to Ge- 
neral Poor for the immediate marching of his brigade, I was 
told they were under an operation for the itch, which made 
it impossible for them to proceed, till the effects of it were 
over. By a letter, however, of yesterday, General Poor* 
informs me he would certainly march this morning. I must 
do him the justice to say, he appears solicitous to join you, 
and that I believe the past delay is not owing to any fault 
of his, but is wholly chargeable on General Putnam. In- 
deed, sir, I owe it to the service to say, that every part of 
this gentleman's conduct is marked with blunder and negli- 
gence, and gives general disgust. 

" Parson's brigade will join you, I hope, in five or six days 
from this ; Learned's brigade may do the same ; Poor's will, 
I am persuaded, make all the haste they can for the future, 
and Glover's may be expected at Fishkill to-night, whence 
they will be pushed forward as fast as I can have any influ- 
ence to make them go ; but I am sorry to say, the disposition 
for marching in the officers and men does not keep pace with 
my wishes or the exigency of the occasion. They have un- 
fortunately imbibed an idea that they have done their part of 
the business of the campaign, and are now entitled to repose. 
This, and the want of pay, makes them averse to a long march 
at this advanced season. 

" * * * * In a letter from General Putnam, just now receiv- 
ed by Governor Clinton, he appears to have been the 10th

HAMILTON. 109 

answer to my last applications. The enemy appear to have 
stripped New- York very bare. The people there, that is the 
tones, are in a great fright : this adds to my anxiety that 
the reinforcements from this quarter to you are not in greater 
forwardness and more considerable. 

" I have written to General Gates, informing him of the ac- 
counts of the situation of New- York with respect to troops, 
and the probability of the force gone to Howe being greater 
than was at first expected, to try if this will not extort from him 
a farther reinforcement. I don't, however, expect much from 
him, as he pretends to have in view an expedition against Ti- 
conderoga, to be undertaken in the winter, and he knows that 
under the sanction of this idea, calculated to catch the eastern 
people, he may, without censure, retain the troops ; and as I 
shall be under the necessity of speaking plainly to you when I 
have the pleasure of seeing you, I shall not hesitate to say, I 
doubt whether you would have had a man from the northern 
army if the whole could have been kept at Albany with any 
decency. Perhaps you will think me blameable in not having 
exercised the powers you gave me, and given a positive order. 
Perhaps I have been so ; but deliberately weighing all cir- 
cumstances, I did not, and do not think it advisable to do it." 

Hamilton then crossed the river to Fishkill, in order to have 
another interview with General Putnam, whence he wrote 
a second letter to General Gates. 

HAMILTON TO GATES. 

November 12th, 1777. 
SIR, 

Ever since my arrival in this quarter, I have been endeav- 
ouring to collect the best idea I could of the state of things in 
New- York, in order the better to form a judgment of the pro- 
bable reinforcement gone to General Howe. On the whole, 
this is a fact well ascertained, that New- York has been strip- 



110 THE LIFE OF 

ped as bare as possible ; that in consequence of this, the few 
troops there and the inhabitants are under so strong appre- 
hensions of an attack, as almost to amount to a panic ; that 
to supply the deficiency of men, every effort is making to ex- 
cite the citizens to arms for the defence of the city. For this 
purpose, the public papers are full of addresses to them, that 
plainly speak the apprehensions prevailing on the occasion. 

Hence I infer that a formidable force is gone to General 
Howe. The calculations made by those who have had the 
best opportunities of judging, carry the number from six to 
seven thousand. If so, the number gone and going to Gene- 
ral Washington is far inferior. five thousand at the utmost. 
The militia were all detained by General Putnam, till it be- 
came too late to send them. 

The state of things I gave you when I had the pleasure of 
seeing you, was, to the best of my judgment, sacredly true. 
I give you the present information, that you may decide whe- 
ther any farther succour can with propriety come from you. 

The fleet, with the troops on board, sailed out of the Hook 
the 5th instant. This circumstance demonstrates, beyond 
a possibility of doubt, that it is General Howe's fixed intention 
to endeavour to hold Philadelphia at all hazards, and removes 
all danger of any farther operations up the North river this 
winter; otherwise Sir Henry Clinton's movement at this 
advanced season is altogether inexplicable. 

If you can with propriety afford any farther assistance, the 
most expeditious mode of conveying it, will be to acquaint Ge- 
neral Putnam of it, that he may send on the troops with him, 
to be replaced by them. You, sir, best know the uses to 
which the troops with you are to be applied, and will deter- 
mine accordingly. I am certain it is not his excellency's wish 
to frustrate any plan you may have in view for the benefit of 
the service, so far as it can possibly be avoided, consistent 
with a due attention to more important objects. 

I am, with respect, sir, your most obedient, 

ALEX. HAMILTON, A. D. C. 



HAMILTON. HI 

He proceeded through the Highlands to Peekskill, where 
becoming seriously indisposed, he addressed a letter to Gene- 
ral Washington, dated November 15, Mr. Kennedy's House. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

I arrived at this place last night, and unfortunately find my- 
self unable to proceed any farther. Imagining I had gotten 
the better of my complaint which confined me at Governor 
Clinton's, and anxious to be about attending to the march of 
the troops, the day before yesterday I crossed the ferry in or- 
der to fall in with General Glover's brigade, which was on its 
march from Poughkeepsie to Fishkill. I did not, however, 
see it myself, but received a letter from Colonel Shepherd, 
who commands the brigade, informing me he would be last 
night at Fishkill, and this night at King's Ferry. Wagons, &c. 
are provided on the other side for his accommodation, so that 
there need be no delay but what is voluntary; and I believe 
Colonel Shepherd is as well disposed as could be wished to 
hasten his march. General Poor's brigade crossed the ferry 
the day before yesterday. Two York regiments, Cortland's 
and Livingston's, are with them : they were unwilling to be 
separated from the brigade, and the brigade from them. 
General Putnam was unwilling to keep them with him, and if 
he had consented to do it, the regiments to replace them 
would not join you six days as soon as these. The troops 
now remaining with General Putnam, will amount to about 
the number you intended, though they are not exactly the 
same. He has detached Colonel Charles Webb's regiment 
to you. He says the troops with him are not in a condition 
to march, being destitute of shoes, stockings, and other neces- 
saries ; but I believe the true reasons of his being unwilling 
to pursue the mode pointed out by you, were his aversion to 
the York troops, and his desire to retain General Parsons with 
him. I am, with much respect and esteem, 

Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 



112 THELIFEOF 

His delicate frame, exhausted by his exertions, sunk under 
the fatigue, and he was prevented by indisposition from re- 
joining the army until a short time before it entered into win- 
ter quarters at Valley Forge. While anxiously waiting his 
recovery, in the expectation of participating in the decisive 
blow which he still cherished the hope might be given to the 
enemy, he had the gratification of receiving a letter from 
General Washington, dated November 15, 1777. 



DEAR SIR, 



I have duly received your several favours from the time 
you left me to that of the 12th instant. I approve entirely of 
all the steps you have taken, and have only to wish that the 
exertions of those you have had to deal with, had kept pace 
with your zeal and good intentions. I hope your health will, 
before this, have permitted you to push on the rear of the 
whole reinforcement beyond New-Windsor. Some of the 
enemy's ships have arrived in the Delaware, but how many 
have troops on board, I cannot exactly ascertain. The ene- 
my has lately damaged Fort Mifflin considerably, but our 
people keep possession, and seem determined to do so to the 
last extremity. Our loss in men has been but small, Cap- 
tain Treat is unfortunately among the killed. I wish you a 
safe return, and am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

G. WASHINGTON. 

A careful survey of Hamilton's letters, justifies the conclu- 
sion, that it would have been difficult to have adopted a hap- 
pier mode of attaining the objects of his mission. The situa- 
tion in which he was placed was extremely difficult, one 
which required the most careful examination of opposite con- 
siderations, in which an error might have involved his prin- 
cipal in the greatest embarrassment, and might have resulted 
in the overthrow of all his youthful hopes. 



HAMILTON. 113 

An ordinary mind, overawed by the imposing situation of 
General Gates, would have acquiesced in the reasons assign- 
ed by him for the retention of the troops. 
/A determined youth, clothed with plenary powers, might 
have yielded to the tempting impulse of showing his authority, 
by requiring the whole force by a peremptory order, which 
if obeyed, might have produced a general discontent towards 
Washington, that would have been augmented by the cla- 
mours of the partizans of Gates in congress, and by his un- 
bounded popularity in the eastern states, and if disobeyed, 
would have brought his authority into contempt. 

Hamilton was aware of the difficulties of his situation, and 
while he fulfilled his orders, he shielded the commander-in- 
chief from all possible censure, and by his prudence deprived 
his enemies of every pretence of complaint ; but after having 
ascertained that public opinion would sustain him in a more 
peremptory procedure, that the shallowness of General Gates' 
objections were perceived by all the military men at Albany, 
and that the people disbelieved the existence of any public 
necessity for the detention of the troops ; penetrating the 
real motives of the delay, and believing this policy to be in 
subservience to that dangerous ambition which menaced the 
most alarming consequences to the republic, though still 
mingling mildness with energy, he assumed a bolder tone of 
remonstrance, made manifest the misconduct of Gates, and 
obtained more than his nice discretion had at first ventured to 
insist upon. 

This deportment of a lad of twenty, negotiating with an 
officer buoyed up with his recent successes, already placed 
before the popular eye as the rival of Washington, sustained 
by a majority of congress, and hoping soon to supplant him, 
will be regarded as not the least remarkable, nor the least in- 
teresting incident of his life ; by Washington it never was 
forgotten. /

ful to raise the veil, and to dissipate those pleasing illusions, 
cherished from childhood, towards every eminent actor in 
the revolutionary struggle, which have ripened into a sen- 
timent little short of personal attachment, more especially 
when the person inculpated is General Putnam. 

Of some of these individuals, political differences have 
tinged the character with its baneful hues, and the merit of 
winning national independence has been forgotten, orthrown 
far into the shade by the more prominent interests which 
have since agitated the commonwealth ; but the claims of 
Putnam stand alone upon-his military achievements, and the 
story of his wondrous perils, and of his eminent prowess, is 
intermingled with, and has become a part of our national 
romance, so that we cannot endure that even the truth 
should lessen aught of the brightness of his glory. His 
rustic manners, and his imperfect education, have rather 
added to his reputation with the people, delighted to approxi- 
mate him to themselves, and to appropriate a part of his 
fame ; and he is associated in their minds with the rural con- 
suls and dictators of uncorrupted Rome ; but higher duties 
are to be fulfilled than to gratify national pride, and the 
story of the revolution is but half told when those difficul- 
ties are concealed, which were encountered and overcome 
by the men who achieved the liberty of their country. 

The consequences of the delays which had been inter- 
posed in reinforcing the army were soon and sadly felt. 
The fall of Fort Mifflin was a prelude to the ev acuation of 
Red Bank. A reinforcement from New- York, enabled 
Cornwallis, with a detachment of two thousand men, to 
cross the river; from the procrastination in forming a 
junction with Glover's brigade, then on their march through 
the Jersies, General Greene found himself too weak to in- 
tercept his adversary, and on the night of the twentieth of 
November, after the waste of so many lives, the water guard 
was destroyed, and the defences of the Delaware fell into 



HAMILTON. 115 

the hands of the enemy.* Howe, strengthened by the suc- 
cours which now reached him, was enabled to hold posses- 
sion of Philadelphia during the ensuing winter, "though just 
before the reduction of the forts, he balanced upon the point 
of quitting that city." 

A letter from General Washington to congress, of the 
tenth of December, in which he mentions the movement of 
the enemy to Chestnut Hill, and their sudden retreat, ex- 
presses " a regret that they had not come to an engagement." 
This retreat was unquestionably owing to a discovery of the 
increased strength of the Americans. From this may be 
inferred Howe's condition at that moment, and it justifies 
the conclusion, that a prompt obedience to the orders con- 
veyed by Hamilton, on the parts of Gates and Putnam, 
would not only have saved the defences of the river, so long 
and gallantly maintained, but by enabling the Americans 
to take a strong position in the vicinity of Red Bank, would 
have cut off the communication between the British army 
and fleet, and fulfilling Washington's prophecy, Howe would 
have been reduced to the situation of Burgoyne, thus pro- 
bably terminating the war in the second year of our inde- 
pendence.f 

* A very elaborate and able letter, August, 1777, discussing at great length 
the nature of the river defence proper to be adopted, is on file at Washing- 
ton, in the handwriting of Hamilton. 

t The conduct of Putnam, on this occasion, entered deeply into the breast 
of Washington ; and we find him, in a letter from Valley Forge, dated March 
6, 1778, thus expressing himself, in reference to the command at Rhode Island : 
" They also know with more certainty than I do, what will be the determina- 
tion of congress respecting General Putnam; and, of course, whether the ap- 
pointment of him to such a command as that at Rhode Island would fall within 
their views. It being incumbent on me to observe, that with such materials as 
I am furnished, the work must go on, whether well or ill is another matter. 
If, therefore, he and others are not laid aside, they must be placed where they 
tan least injure the service.'" 



CHAPTER VII. 

[1777.] 

THE history of the Revolution, as it has usually been 
told, is full of the marvellous. It is the portraiture of a 
civil conflict without vices or intrigues ; the narrative of 
a league without refractory members. 

Three millions of people have been represented as burst- 
ing from the bondage of Great Britain, and submitting 
without a question to the mild control of a government of 
their own choice ; and the curious inquirer, looking for the 
usual play of the passions which marks the conduct of 
men under such circumstances, has been asked to believe 
that, in this instance, all former experience was false ; that 
the sudden assumption of political rights was unattended 
with abuse, and that in America, resistance to oppression 
clothed all the leaders of the opposition with more than 
human virtues. 

Yielding to this pleasing illusion, and pointing to the 
light bonds of the confederacy, it has been inferred that 
man can dispense with government, and that here at last 
has been found that which the wildest enthusiast hardly 
dared to hope , a state of society where " men created 
free and equal," require nothing more to make them vir- 
tuous and happy. 

Without examining the premises from which this infer- 
ence is derived, reason and the experience of this country 
prove the falsity of the conclusion ; and it is believed, that 
a true narrative of the twelve years which preceded the 
adoption of the present constitution of the United States, 
would show, that never did a people placed under circum- 
stances so propitious to their well-being incur more unne- 



118 THE LIFE OF 

cessary suffering, privation, and wrong than the American ; 
and that this is chiefly attributable to the jealousy of power 
which was encouraged by demagogues, and to the feeble- 
ness of the league whose powers they often arbitrarily ad- 
ministered. 

These false appearances have been assumed to amuse 
the public mind ; and in the emulation of flattery, truth in 
all its just proportions has been excluded from the view. 

The glory which the two first congresses shed upon the 
revolution seems to have dazzled every judgment as to the 
conduct of their successors ; and instead of those salutary 
lessons which are to be derived from their errors and mis- 
conduct, the freedom of history has been restrained, and 
those lights and shades which form part of every picture in 
which man is exhibited, are merged in a general blaze of 
indiscriminate admiration. 

He will approach nearer to the truth, who while he re- 
presents the American people at first earnestly hoping a re- 
conciliation with Great Britain, then angered by her mena- 
ces, and exasperated by her measures of coercion, entering 
upon the contest, stimulated by a sudden and intense desire 
of independence, as the only refuge, in its progress some- 
times doubting, often misled, but always true to their prin- 
ciples, and in all the ordinary features of their character 
raised and exalted, shows that they were sustained through- 
out this arduous struggle by the eminent qualities and pre- 
eminent popularity of one man, aided by the enlightened 
counsels of a few virtuous friends, who seemed raised up by 
providence to establish a great nation. 

Among the arts of a later period, it has been contended 
as an evidence of the virtues of the times, but for the pur- 
pose of shielding individual misconduct, that Washington's 
course was unimpeded by opposition ; and that a man raised 
far above his cotemporaries, and resting on the support of 
a body as variable as the congress of the confederation, was 



HAMILTON. 119 

not an object of envy, and was at all times secure and firm 
in his position when every thing around him was in a state 
offluctuation. 

It falls, in natural connexion with the incidents of the 
preceding chapter, to show that it was the want of power, 
not the want of inclination, which prevented Washington, 
now revered as the Father of his Country, from being treat- 
ed as a mere soldier of fortune. 

The materials for this purpose, from the silence of the 
journals of congress, are imperfect ; but from amidst the 
errors which have been promulgated respecting the pro- 
ceedings of those secret councils where falsehood lies in 
ambush, enough may be gathered to establish this allega- 
tion. 

As the origin of the great parties which have since divi- 
ded this country had an intimate connexion with the pro- 
ject of forcing General Washington from the command of 
the army, a brief narrative of these events comes within 
the scope of this work. 

On the fifteenth of June, 1775, Colonel Washington was 
unanimously elected, and on the seventeenth, the day on 
which the battle of Bunker's Hill was fought, was commis- 
sioned as commander-in-chief. 

The enviable distinction of having nominated him to this 
place belongs to Thomas Johnson of Maryland, who soon 
after signalized his patriotism by hastening from civil life 
with a body of Maryland troops, to join the army during its 
retreat through New-Jersey, and who as a just tribute to 
his virtues and talents was elected the first governor of that 
state. 

As this circumstance is not only one of great public in- 
terest, but had an important bearing on the political desti- 
nies of the country, and more especially as it has been er- 
roneously supposed that this honour was claimed by John 
Adams, a distinguished member of that congress, it becomes 



120 THE LIFE OF 

important to give the evidence on which this statement rests. 
It is found in the following extract of a letter from that gen- 
tleman to Colonel Pickering, dated August 6th, 1822. After 
giving an account of his journey to Philadelphia in 1775, 
in company with Gushing, Samuel Adams, and Paine, "four 
poor pilgrims," Mr. John Adams says, " they were met at 
Frankfort by Doctor Rush, Mr. Mifflin, Mr. Bayard, and 
others, who desired a conference, and particularly caution- 
ed not to lisp the word ' Independence.' They added, you 
must not come forward with any bold measures ; you must 
not pretend to take the lead ; you know Virginia is the most 
populous state in the union ; they are very proud of their 
ancient dominion, as they call it ; they think they have a 
right to take the lead, and the southern states and middle 
states are too much disposed to yield it to them. This was 
plain dealing, Mr. Pickering ; and, I must confess, that 
there appeared so much wisdom and good sense in it, that 
it made a deep impression on my mind, and it had an equal 
effect on all my colleagues. This conversation, and the 
principles, facts, and motives suggested in it, have given a 
colour, complexion, and character to the whole policy of 
the United States from that day to this. Without it, Mr. 
Washington would never have commanded our armies, nor 
Mr. Jefferson have been the author of the declaration of in- 
dependence, nor Mr. Richard Henry Lee the mover of it, 
nor Mr. Chase the mover of foreign connexions. 

" If I have ever had cause to repent of any part of this 
policy, that repentance ever has been, and ever will be, una- 
vailing. I had forgot to say, nor had Mr. Johnson ever 
have been the nominator of Washington for General" 

The signal merit which he had evinced in the war of 
seventeen hundred and fifty-six, justly secured to him a pre- 
ference over every native American, and public feeling 
would have endured no other than a native. 

Congress duly appreciated the popular sentiment, and 



HAMILTON. 



121 



while they gladly availed themselves of foreign military ex- 
perience, two days after* selected Artemas Ward of Mas- 
sachusetts, as second in command, to fill the vacancy which 
might occur in case of the fall of Washington ; thus care- 
fully avoiding the possibility of a foreigner being at the 
head of their armies. 

In a season of profound peace, the revolution opened an 
attractive prospect to military men ; and foreigners in crowds 
proffered their services, urging their pretensions at a time 
when it was imagined that military experience could not 
be purchased at too high a price. 

Of those who were first employed, the most conspicuous 
was General Charles Lee, a native of England, who had 
served in the British army in America. His romantic 
temper led him to seek distinction in the most remote and 
opposite regions of Europe ; he became a soldier of fortune, 
and served with equal interest in Portugal against the 
Spaniards, and in Poland against the Turks. Conscious of 
his own superiority, though of humble birth, he endured 
with bitter discontent the preference which he alleged, in 
his native country, interest enjoyed over unassisted merit. 
A sense of disappointment rankled in his breast, and yield- 
ing to this influence, and to the impulses of a wayward na- 
ture, he became an impetuous republican. With such feel- 
ings, the new world suddenly opened an unlimited sphere 
to his ambition, and, at the same time, presented to him the 
prospect of contending in arms against the men whom pa- 
tronage had preferred to him, and of avenging himself upon 
those privileged orders, which, in his own estimate of his 
talents, he imagined had been the only obstacle to his ad- 
vancement. Opinions so congenial with those which were 
beginning to prevail in America, strongly recommended 
him, and in the first selection of the general staff, he was 

* June 17, 1775. 
VOL. I. 16 



122 THE LIFE OF 

appointed a Major General, next in rank to Ward, on whose 
resignation he became second in command. 

Although his military experience was considerable, such 
were the singular eccentricities of his character, that he 
soon alarmed those who guided the early councils of the 
country, by the most arbitrary acts and startling indiscre- 
tions. But nevertheless, he enjoyed the confidence of the 
people, who mistook his extravagances for genius, and who 
imagined that they saw even in the irregularities of his mind 
evidences of resources which only waited an opportunity 
for their display. 

Led away by the impetuosity of his temper, he often 
transcended the strict bounds of his profession ; but for 
every violation of discipline, his ready wit furnished a plau- 
sible excuse, while his reputed knowledge gave him an in- 
fluence with the uninformed, to whom he was the more 
recommended by the pointed sarcasms which were always 
at his command. 

His sneers and his apothegms were widely circulated, 
and men yielded a tacit approbation to covert jests, which 
would have been withheld from an open avowal of disap- 
probation. 

Under this malign influence, the public consideration of 
the commander-in-chief, after the defeat on Long Island, 
the evacuation of New- York, the surrender of Fort Wash- 
ington, and the retreat through the Jersies, though exalted 
by the brilliant enterprises of Trenton and Princeton, be- 
gan to diminish. But happily for Washington, most hap- 
pily for his country, while disaffection was concentrating 
on this half hero, half madman, he was captured, under cir- 
cumstances little creditable to his reputation. 

The individual who next presented himself to the eye of 
faction, was Horatio Gates. Of humble origin, but usher- 
ed into life under the auspices of nobility, Gates was ap- 
pointed an ensign in the British army, and served in the 



HAMILTON. 123 

West Indies, where he was distinguished by being selected 
as bearer of the despatches announcing the capture of Mar- 
tinique. He subsequently visited America, and was with 
Washington in the defeat of Braddock, in which engage- 
ment he received a wound. 

He returned to England for a short time, but induced 
by similar considerations with those which actuated Gene- 
ral Lee, he revisited America, and retired to a plantation 
in Virginia, endeavouring there to forget that his native 
country had not duly appreciated his value. 

At the opening of the revolution, and, it has been stated, 
upon the recommendation of General Washington, he was 
appointed Adjutant General of the army, and in May, 1776, 
was elected a Major General, Thomas Mifflin being cho- 
sen to fill the vacancy which the promotion of Gates had 
created. In the ensuing month he was directed to take the 
command in Canada, and such was the temper he thus 
early displayed, that congress found it necessary, soon af- 
ter, to pass a resolution, that they had no design to invest 
him with a superior command to Schuyler, while the troops 
were within the bounds of the states. 

By a series of intrigues, he recommended himself to the 
favour of a large party in congress, and soon after Schuy- 
ler had taken all the preparatory steps for the capture of 
Burgoyne, such was the clamour raised against him by the 
New-England troops, that he was superseded just in time 
to transfer his laurels to the brow of Gates. 

The capture of a British army swelled his fame ; the 
people, bewildered with his success, turned in murmurs to- 
wards Washington, and forgetting what he had done, de- 
manded, with the levity of recent good fortune, why more 
had not been accomplished ? Emboldened by this feeling, 
the enemies of the commander-in-chief now cast their hopes 
upon his rival, as a fit instrument of their designs. 

But never was a cabal more unfortunate in its selection. 



124 THE LIFE OF 

Weak and vainglorious, Gates had precisely those traits of 
character which would recommend him to the designing, 
without the penetration to discover that he was used as a 
tool. Presumptuous and irresolute, he engaged in intrigues 
which he had not the sagacity to direct, and sought respon- 
sibilities which he had not the firmness to sustain. 

This man, the giddy object of the hopes and fears of the 
discontented, was, through the arts of his partizans, pos- 
sessed of the entire confidence of the New-England states,* 
where Washington, though idolized at subsequent periods 
of his life, was, at this time, far from being a favourite. 

The cause of this may be assigned without difficulty. 
Of the members which composed the American confedera- 
cy, the two in all respects the most important and influen- 
tial, were the states of Virginia and Massachusetts. Vir- 
ginia was the asylum of the cavaliers, Massachusetts of 
the puritans ; and the marked and distinctive traits of cha- 
racter of the early settlers, and their attendant prejudices, 
continued to present obstacles to any cordiality of feeling. 

Their different modes of life, also had an influence in per- 
petuating the mutual dislike. The hardy sons of labour in 
the east, looked down with disdain, perhaps with envy, on 
wealth acquired without personal toil ; while the almost 
lordly planter, returned with indignation the temper which 
could question the tenure of his wealth. With such pre- 
disposing causes of collision, it is not matter of surprise that 
in New-England, with her more concentrated population 
and active capital, the less informed of the people should 
ill have brooked that the control of armies, which her war- 
like sons principally filled, should be conferred on a soldier 
of the south. The jealousy which this selection inspired, 
was believed to have led to the resignation of General 
Ward, and was not softened by the presence of Washing- 

* "He is their idol," said Schuyler, " because he is at their discretion." 



HAMILTON-. 

ton before Boston, though followed by the evacuation of 
that town, and the removal of the seat of war. 

The superior and general intelligence of this population, 
imparted to them a spirit of inquiry and vigilance of tem- 
per, which entered deeply into the composition of their 
character. 

Hence flowed their just and early estimate of their co- 
lonial rights, which, extending widely through the country, 
established the standard of public opinion. Hence an ac- 
tive and unceasing supervision of the conduct of their rulers, 
which constituted each individual a guardian of the inte- 
rests of his immediate community. Hence a confidence 
of opinion, a steadiness of purpose, and an untiring perse- 
verance, which form their peculiar, and, perhaps, most va- 
luable characteristics. 

With these energetic features of character were con- 
nected qualities springing from the same source ; which, 
when they were withdrawn from their ordinary avoca- 
tions, produced a spirit of insubordination that rendered 
them prone to discontent and difficult of conciliation. 

The exertions of Washington to introduce discipline, had 
furnished early and unceasing causes of dissatisfaction 
among the militia drawn from this section of the country, 
who found in the forbearance and connivance of many of 
their inferior officers, not only occasions of panegyric, but 
motives of continued hostility and embittering comparison : 
forming a very large proportion of the combattants during 
all the war, they claimed a right to direct, and to control 
the councils of their superiors ; and while their numbers 
gave importance to their clamours, it increased the neces- 
sity of yielding to them on occasions, when to yield was to 
surrender every principle of authority. 

In the frequent drafts made upon her patriotism, the 
feelings of the soldiers rapidly extended to the mass of the 
people of New-England ; and while no portion of the union 



126 THE LIFE OF 

displayed more devotion to the cause of the revolution, in 
none was jt more difficult to silence the clamours of the dis- 
contented. The superior population, the larger quotas 
furnished to the army, the more faithful discharge of the 
public burthens, were among the topics which their pride 
naturally dwelt upon, and not without reason ; for one state 
alone furnished a fourth of the troops which sustained 
the revolution : and not less just than forcible was the de- 
claration of Hamilton, when, to express his high respect 
for her exertions, he said "that Massachusetts was the 
pivot on which the revolution turned." The consciousness 
of this gave rise to claims of superiority, which were che- 
rished by several of the leading individuals of that part of 
the country, who, by encouraging these sentiments served 
their own popularity at home, and, as they imagined, con- 
firmed their title to a preponderance in the confederacy. 

The calamities which befel the army on the invasion of 
Canada, and the series of disasters which followed the 
battle of Long Island, were alike attributed by them to the 
incapacity of the commander-in-chief ; and they were only 
waiting until some officer should be presented to the na- 
tion in a favourable point of view, to support him as a rival 
for public confidence, and the highest command. 

It has been mentioned that the capture of Lee removed 
him from the public eye, and that the same party then di- 
rected their attention to General Gates. The evacuation 
of Ticonderoga, by St. Clair, though wholly unknown to 
General Schuyler, was a reverse of fortune magnified and 
misrepresented, and the opportunity of bestowing on their 
favourite so important a command, outweighed every con- 
sideration of delicacy to Schuyler, and was the more rea- 
dily embraced because it was contrary to the known wishes 
of Washington, the judgment of Jay, and the feelings of 
New- York, which had evinced a steady determination to 
support the commander-in-chief. The hostility of this party, 



HAMILTON. 127 

which was disarmed by the success at Trenton, began to 
indicate itself anew after the affair of Germantown, when 
the misconduct of part of the troops called forth censures 
from head quarters, and led to numerous arrests. 

On such occasions, the bravest officers cannot always 
escape unmerited obloquy ; and, unfortunately, individuals 
were found among them who too readily listened to over- 
tures to join the cabal. 

Letters, written under feelings of irritation, were address- 
ed to the northern army, and circulated throughout the 
country. The newspapers were called in aid to dissemi- 
nate the poison, and as soon as the victory of Saratoga was 
announced, the designs of the faction, which was known as 
the " Monster Party," were openly evinced in the most as- 
siduous attentions to Gates, and extravagant eulogiums on 
his conduct, and in marked disrespect of Washington, and 
undisguised censures of his policy. 

Among the most active partizans of the opposition, were 
a few foreigners, who arriving in this country with preten- 
sions to the first grades in the army, had been found not to 
possess any real title to preferment. Of these, the foremost 
was Thomas Conway, who appearing before congress with 
the rank of Colonel in the French army, and decorated with 
the cross of the order of Saint Louis, a vain, weak intri- 
guer, had been, in the preceding spring, elected to the com- 
mand of a brigade. Soon understood by Washington, 
Conway became his enemy, and opened a correspondence 
with Gates, in which, by flattering his vanity, and ridicu- 
ling the commander-in-chief, he confirmed him in the idea 
that he might easily supplant him. 

Winter had now closed in, and while Washington was 

engaged in efforts to provide for his famishing and almost 

naked army, a communication was received from General 

Gates, marked with all the insolence of anticipated triumph. 

A paragraph in a letter from Conway to Gates, " in which 



M_. f -* 

128 THE LIFE OF 

General Washington's conduct was made the subject of 
free discussion and injurious remark, was the first occur- 
rence which called forth the attention of the commander-in- 
chief ; to this correspondence Gates lent a willing ear, and 
his answers to General Conway's letters were very much 
the echoes of the sentiments those letters contained."* The 
inquiries which ensued on the disclosure of this correspond- 
ence alarmed Gates, who with a view to fix the imputation 
on General Washington of having practised indirect means 
to arrive at the contents of his confidential correspondence, 
wrote him the letter referred to, throwing out an imputa- 
tion that the extracts had been " stealingly copied," which 
was transmitted to him through the hands of the President 
of Congress. 

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 

Albany, December 8th, 1777. 
SIR, 

I shall not attempt to describe what, as a private gentle- 
man, I cannot help feeling, on representing to my mind the 
disagreeable situation in which confidential letters, when 
exposed to public inspection, may place an unsuspecting 
correspondent ; but as a public officer, I conjure your ex- 
cellency to give me all the assistance you can, in tracing 
out the author of the infidelity which put extracts from 
General Conway's letters to me into your hands. 

Those letters have been stealingly copied, but which of 
them, when, and by whom, is to me yet an unfathomable 
secret. 

There is not one officer in my suite, nor amongst those 
who have free access to me, upon whom I could, with the 
least justification to myself, fix the suspicion, and yet my 
uneasines may deprive me of the usefulness of the wor-

thiest men. It is, I believe, in your excellency's power to 
do me and the United States a very important service by 
detecting a wretch who may betray me, and capitally in- 
jure the very operations under your immediate directions. 
For this reason, sir, I beg your excellency will favour me 
with the proof you can procure to that effect. But the crime 
being eventually so important, that the least loss of time 
may be attended with the worst consequences, and it being 
unknown to me whether the letter came to you from a mem- 
ber of congress or an officer, I shall have the honour of 
transmitting a copy of this to the president, that the congress 
may, in concert with your excellency, obtain as soon as pos- 
sible a discovery which so deeply affects the safety of the 
states. Crimes of that magnitude ought not to remain un- 
punished. I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, 
Your excellency's most humble 

And most obedient servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 
His Excellency General Washington. 

Washington thus replied : 

WASHINGTON TO GATES. 

Valley Forge, January 4th, 1777. 
SIR, 

Your letter of the 8th ultimo, came to my hands a few 
days ago, and to my great surprise informed me that a copy 
of it had been sent to congress, for what reason I find my- 
self unable to account ; but as some end, doubtless, was in- 
tended to be answered by it, I am laid under the disagree- 
able necessity of returning my answer through the same 
channel, lest any member of that honourable body should 
harbour an unfavourable suspicion of my having practised 
some indirect means to come at the contents of the confi- 
dential letters between you and General Conway. 

VOL. i. 17 



130 THE LIFE OF 

I am to inform you, then, that Colonel Wilkinson, on his 
way to congress, in the month of October last, fell in with 
Lord Stirling at Reading, and not in confidence, that I ever 
understood, informed his aid-de-camp, McWilliams, that 
General Conway had written thus to you : " Heaven has 
been determined to save your country, or a weak general 
and bad counsellors would have ruined it." Lord Stirling, 
from motives of friendship, transmitted the account, with 
this remark, " the enclosed was communicated by Colo- 
nel Wilkinson to Major McWilliams. Such duplicity of 
conduct I shall always think it my duty to defeat." 

In consequence of this information, and without having 
any thing more in view than merely to show that gentleman 
that I was not unapprized of his intriguing disposition, I 
wrote him a letter in these words : " Sir, A letter which I 
received last night, contained the following paragraph in a 
letter from General Conway to General Gates, he says, 
' heaven has been determined to save your country, or a 
weak general and bad counsellors would have ruined it.' 
I am," &c. 

Neither this letter, nor the information which occasioned 
it, was ever directly or indirectly communicated by me to 
a single officer in this army out of my own family, except- 
ing the Marquis de la Fayette, who having been spoken to 
on the subject by General Conway, applied for, and saw, 
under injunctions of secrecy, the letter which contained Co- 
lonel Wilkinson's information. So desirous was I of con- 
cealing every matter that could in its consequences give the 
smallest interruption to the tranquillity of this army, or afford 
a gleam of hope to the enemy by dissensions therein. 

Thus, sir, with openness and candour, which I hope will 
ever characterize and mark my conduct, have I complied 
with your request. The only concern I feel upon the occa- 
sion, finding how matters stand, is, that in doing this, I have 
necessarily been obliged to name a gentleman whom I am 



HAMILTON. 131 

persuaded, (although I never exchanged a word with him 
on the subject,) thought he was rather doing an act of jus- 
tice, than committing an act of infidelity ; and sure I am, 
that till Lord Stirling's letter came to my hands, I never 
knew that General Conway (whom I viewed in the light of a 
stranger to you,) was a correspondent of yours, much less 
did I expect that I was the subject of your confidential let- 
ters. Pardon me, then, for adding, that so far from con- 
ceiving that the safety of the states can be affected, or in 
the smallest degree injured by a discovery of this kind, or 
that I should be called on in such solemn terms to point out 
the author, that I considered the information as coming from 
yourself, and given with a friendly view to forewarn, and, 
consequently, forearm me against a secret enemy ; or in 
other words, a dangerous incendiary, in which character, 
sooner or later, this country will know General Conway. 
But in this, as in other matters of late, I have found myself 
mistaken. I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 
The Hon. Major General Gates. 

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 
SIR, 

The letter of the 4th inst. which I had the honour to re- 
ceive yesterday from your excellency, has relieved me from 
unspeakable uneasiness. I now anticipate the pleasure it 
will give you when you discover that what has been con- 
veyed to you for an extract of General Conway's letter to 
me, was not an information which friendly motives indu- 
ced a man of honour to give, that injured virtue might be 
forewarned against secret enemies. The paragraph which 
your excellency has condescended to transcribe is spurious. 



132 THE LIFE OF 

It was certainly fabricated to answer the most selfish and 
wicked purposes. 

I cannot avoid sketching out to your excellency the his- 
tory of General Conway's letter from the time that it came 
to my hands, by Lieutenant-Colonel Troup, my aid-de- 
camp, to whom General Conway delivered it at Reading, 
on the llth of October, to this time, as far as it has affected 
me, and the officers of my family. 

That letter contained very judicious remarks upon that 
want of discipline which has often alarmed your excel- 
lency, and I believe all observing patriots. The reasons 
which, in his judgment, deprived us of the success we would 
reasonably expect, were methodically explained by him ; 
but neither the weakness of any of our generals, nor " bad 
counsellors," were mentioned, and consequently cannot be 
assigned or imagined as part of those reasons to which 
General Conway attributed some of our losses. He wrote 
to me as a candid observer, as other officers in every ser- 
vice write to each other for obtaining better intelligence 
than that of newspapers, and that freedom renders such 
letters thus far confidential in some measure. The judg- 
ment of the person who received them points out to him, 
according to time and circumstances, the propriety or im- 
propriety attending their being communicated when no 
particular injunction of secrecy was requested. 

Particular actions, rather than persons, were blamed, 
but with impartiality ; and I am convinced that he did not 
aim at lessening, in my opinion, the merit of any person. 
His letter was perfectly harmless : however, now that va- 
rious reports have been circulated concerning its contents, 
they ought not to be submitted to the solemn inspection of 
those who stand most high in the public esteem. 

Anxiety and jealousy would arise in the breast of very 
respectable officers, who, rendered sensible of faults which 
inexperience, and that alone may have led them into, 



V 
HAMILTON. 133 

would be unnecessarily disgusted, if they perceived a pro- 
bability of such errors being recorded. 

Honour forbids it, and patriotism demands, that I should 
return the letter into the hands of the writer. I will do it, 
but at the same time I declare that the paragraph conveyed 
to your excellency as a genuine part of it, was in words as 
well as in substance, a wicked forgery. 

About the beginning of December I was informed that 
letter had occasioned an explanation between your excel- 
lency and that gentleman. Not knowing whether the whole 
letter or part of it had been stealingly copied, but fearing 
malice had altered its original features, I own, sir, that a 
dread of the mischiefs which might attend the forgery I 
suspected would be made, put me for some time in a most 
painful situation. When I communicated to the officers in 
my family the intelligence I had received, they all entreat- 
ed me to rescue their characters from the suspicions they 
justly conceived themselves liable to until the guilty person 
should be known. To facilitate the discovery, I wrote your 
excellency; but unable to learn whether General Con- 
way's letter had been transmitted to you by a member of 
congress, or a gentleman hi the army, I was afraid much 
time would be lost in the course of the inquiry, and that the 
states might receive some capital injury from the infidelity 
of the person who I thought had stolen a copy of the ob- 
noxious letter, was it not probable that the secrets of the 
army might be attained and betrayed through the same 
means to the enemy ? 

For this reason, sir, not doubting that congress would 
most cheerfully concur with you in tracing out the crimi- 
nal, I wrote to the president, and enclosed to him a copy of 
my letter to your excellency. 

About the same time I was forwarding these letters, Bri- 
gadier General Wilkinson returned to Albany. I informed 
him of the treachery which had been committed, but I con- 



134 THE LIFE OF 

cealed from him the measures I was pursuing to unmask 
the author. Wilkinson answered, he was assured it never 
would come to light, and endeavoured to fix my suspi- 
cions on Lieutenant-Colonel Troup, who said he might 
have incautiously conversed on the substance of General 
Conway's letter with Colonel Hamilton, whom you had 
sent not long before to Albany. I did not listen to this in- 
sinuation against your aid-de-camp and mine. I considered 
it ungenerous ; but the light your excellency has just as- 
sisted me with, exhibiting the many qualifications which 
are necessarily blended together by the head and heart of 
General Wilkinson, I would not omit this fact. It would 
enable your excellency to judge whether or not he would 
scruple to make such a forgery as that which he now stands 
charged with, and ought to be exemplarily punished. To 
attempt sowing dissensions among the principal officers of 
the army, and rendering them odious to each other by false 
suggestions and forgeries, is, in my opinion, a crime of the 
first magnitude, and involves with it all the consequences of 
positive treason. That the forgery now in view was ma- 
chinated for injuring General Conway, and perhaps myself, 
in your judgment, is now evident to me ; and I trust the 
detection will operate, as it ought to operate, upon your ex- 
cellency, as well as the members of the congress before 
whom your letter necessitates me to lay this answer. The 
station of the calumniator seems to justify your excellency 
for having believed till now that the extract was genuine : 
and yet, sir, I cannot help wishing you had sent me a copy 
of it immediately after your explanation with General 
Conway. 

Would that your excellency's prediction relative to him 
had not been inserted in your letter which came to me un- 
sealed, through the hands of congress. I sincerely wish the 
detection of this forgery may render us all more cautious ; 
and that to procure a fair and dispassionate explanation 



HAMILTON. 135 

whenever insinuations are made to the prejudice of respect- 
ed characters, may become an established rule in society, 
as well as in public business throughout the United States. 
I am with unfeigned respect, sir, 

Your excellency's most humble and 
Most obedient servant, 

HORATIO GATES. 

January 23d, 1778. 

This extraordinary attempt, after having substantially ad- 
mitted in his first letter the genuineness of the extract from 
Conway's letter, to induce the belief that it was a forgery, 
and a forgery committed by Colonel Wilkinson, a member 
of his own staff, was thus commented upon. 

WASHINGTON TO GATES. 

Head Quarters, Valley Forge, February 9th, 1778. 

SIR: 

I was duly favoured with your letter of the 23d last 
month, to which I should have replied sooner, had I not 
been delayed by business that required my more imme- 
diate attention. 

It is my wish to give implicit credit to the assurances of 
every gentleman ; but on the subject of our present cor- 
respondence, I am sorry to confess, there happens to be 
some unlucky circumstances which involuntarily compel 
me to consider the discovery you mention, not so satisfac- 
tory and conclusive as you seem to think it.* 

* In a private letter from General Washington to Mr. Jay, dated April 14, 
1779, he observes, " I discovered very early in the war, symptoms of coldness 
and constraint in General Gates' behaviour to me. These increased as he rose 
into greater consequence, but we did not come to a direct breach till the begin- 
ning of last year. This was occasioned by a correspondence, which I thought 
made rather free with me, between him and General Conway, which acci- 
dentally came to my knowledge. The particulars of this affair, you will find 
delineated in the packet herewith, endorsed ' Papers respecting General Con- 



136 THE LIFE OF 

I am so unhappy as to find no small difficulty in recon- 
ciling the spirit and import of your different letters, and 
sometimes the different parts of the same letter with each 
other. 

It is not unreasonable to presume, that your first informa- 
tion of my having notice of General Conway's letter, came 
from himself; there were very few in the secret, and it is 
natural to suppose, that he being immediately concerned, 
would be the most interested to convey the intelligence to 
you. It is also far from improbable, that he acquainted you 
with the substance of the passage communicated to me ; 
one would expect this, if he believed it to be spurious, in 
order to ascertain the imposition and evince his innocence, 
especially as he seemed to be under some uncertainty as to 
the precise contents of what he had written, when I signi- 
fied my knowledge of the matter to him. If he neglected 
doing it, the omission cannot easily be interpreted into any 
thing else than a consciousness of the reality of the extract, 
if not literally, at least substantially. If he did not neglect 
it, it must appear somewhat strange that the forgery re- 
mained so long undetected, and that your first letter to me 
from Albany, of the eighth of December, should tacitly re- 
cognise the genuineness of the paragraph in question; while 
your only concern at that time seemed to be, the " tracing 
out the author of the infidelity, which put extracts of Gene- 
ral Conway's letters into my hands." Throughout the 
whole of that letter, the reality of the extracts is, by the fair- 
est implication, allowed, and your only solicitude was to find 
out the person who brought them to light. After making 
the most earnest pursuit of the author of the supposed 
treachery, without saying a word about the truth or false- 
hood of the passage, your letter of the twenty-third ultimo, 

way.' Besides the evidence contained in them of the genuineness of the of- 
fensive correspondence, / have other proems still more convincing, which having 
been given me in a confidential way, I am not at liberty to impart." 



HAMILTON. 137 

to my great surprise, proclaims it in words, as well as sub- 
stance, a " wicked forgery." 

It is not my intention to contradict this assertion, but 
only to intimate some considerations, which tend to induce 
a supposition, that though none of General Conway's letters 
to you contain the offensive passage mentioned, there might 
have been something in them too nearly related to it, that 
could give such an extraordinary alarm. It may be said, 
if this were not the case, how easy, in the first instance, to 
declare there was nothing exceptionable in them, and to 
have produced the letters themselves in support of them ? 
This may be thought the most proper and effectual way of 
refuting misrepresentations, and removing all suspicion. 
The propriety of the objections suggested against submitting 
them to inspection, may very well be questioned ; the vari- 
ous reports circulated concerning their contents were, per- 
haps, so many arguments for making them speak for them- 
selves, to place the matter upon the footing of certainty. 
Concealment, in an affair which had made so much noise, 
though not by my means, will naturally lead men to con- 
jecture the worst, and it will be a subject of speculation 
even to Candour itself. The anxiety and jealousy you ap- 
prehend from revealing the letter, will be very apt to be 
increased by suppressing it. It may be asked, why not 
submit to inspection a performance perfectly harmless, and 
of course conceived in terms of proper caution and delicacy? 
Why suppose that " anxiety and jealousy" would have ari- 
sen in the breasts of very respectable officers, or that they 
would have been necessarily disgusted at being made sen- 
sible of their faults when related with judgment and impar- 
tiality by a candid observer ? Surely they could not have 
been unreasonable enough to take offence at a performance 
so perfectly inoffensive, " blaming actions rather than per- 
sons," which have evidently no connexion with one ano- 
ther, and indulgently "recording the errors of inexperience." 

VOL. i. 18 



138 THELIFEOF 

You are pleased to consider General Conway's letters 
as of a confidential nature, observing, that "time and cir- 
cumstances must point out the propriety or impropriety of 
communicating such letters." Permit me to inquire, whe- 
ther, when there is an impropriety in communication, it is 
only applicable with respect to the parties who are the sub- 
ject of them ? One might be led to imagine this to be the 
case, from your having admitted others into the secret of your 
confidential correspondence, at the same time that you 
thought it ineligible it should be trusted to those officers 
whose actions underwent its scrutiny. Your not knowing 
whether the letter under consideration " came to me from 
a member of congress or from an officer," plainly indicates 
that you had originally communicated it to at least one of 
that honourable body ; and I learn from General Conway, 
that before his late arrival at York-Town, it had been com- 
mitted to the perusal of several of its members, and was 
afterwards shown by himself to three more. It is some- 
what difficult to conceive a reason, founded in generosity, 
for imparting the free and confidential strictures of this in- 
genuous censor on the operations of the army under my 
command, to a member of congress ; but, perhaps, " time 
and circumstances pointed it out." It must be indeed ac- 
knowledged, that the faults of very respectable officers, not 
less injurious for being the result of inexperience, were not 
improper topics to engage the attention of members of con- 
gress. 

It is, however, greatly to be lamented, that this adept in 
military science, did not employ his abilities in the progress 
of the campaign, in pointing out those wise measures which 
were calculated to give us "that degree of success we 
might reasonably expect." The United States have lost 
much by that unseasonable diffidence, which prevented his 
embracing the numerous opportunities he had in council, of 



HAMILTON. 139 

displaying those rich treasures of knowledge and experi- 
rience he has since so freely laid open to you. I will not 
do him the injustice to impute the penurious reserve, which 
ever appeared in him on such occasions, to any other cause 
than an excess of modesty ; neither will I suppose he pos- 
sesses no other merit than of that kind of sagacity, which 
qualifies a man better for profound discoveries of errors 
that have been committed, and advantages that have been 
lost, than for the exercise of that foresight and provident 
discernment, which enable him to avoid the one and anti- 
cipate the other ; but, willing as I am to subscribe to all his 
pretensions, and believe that his remarks on the operations 
of the campaign were very judicious, and that he has saga- 
ciously descanted on many things that might have been 
done, I cannot help being a little sceptical as to his ability 
to have found out the means of accomplishing them, or to 
prove the sufficiency of those in our possession. These 
minutiae, I suspect, he did not think worth his attention, 
particularly as they might not be within the compass of his 
views. 

Notwithstanding the hopeful presages you are pleased to 
figure to yourself of General Conway's firm and constant 
friendship to America, I cannot persuade myself to retract 
the prediction concerning him, which you so emphatically 
wish had not been inserted in my last. A better acquaint- 
ance with him than I have reason to think you have had, 
from what you say, and a concurrence of circumstances 
oblige me to give him but little credit for the qualities of his 
heart, of which, at least, I beg leave to assume the privi- 
lege of being a tolerable judge. Were it necessary, more 
instances than one might be adduced from his behaviour and 
conversation, to manifest that he is capable of all the ma- 
lignity of detraction, and all the meanness of intrigue, to 
gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity, or to 



HO THE LIFE OF 

answer the purposes of personal aggrandizement, and pro- 
mote the interest of a faction. 

I am, with respect, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 

Major General Gates. 

fc~;i t * 

To this biting sarcasm, which no man conscious of his 
innocence would have brooked, General Gates gave the 
following submissive reply. 

GATES TO WASHINGTON. 
SIR, 

I yesterday had the honour to receive your excellency's 
letter of the 9th instant, and earnestly hope no more of that 
time, so precious to the public, may be lost upon the sub- 
ject of General Conway's letter. Whether that gentleman 
does or does not deserve the suspicions you express, would 
be entirely indifferent to me, did he not possess an office of 
high rank in the army of the United States ; for that rea- 
son solely, I wish he may answer all the expectations of 
congress. 

As to the gentleman, I have no personal connexion with 
him, nor had I any correspondence previous to his writing 
the letter which has given offence, nor have I since written 
to him, save to certify what I know to be the contents of 
the letter. He, therefore, must be responsible ; as I 
heartily dislike controversy, even upon my own account, 
and much more in a matter wherein I was only accident- 
ally concerned. In regard to the parts of your excellency's 
letter addressed particularly to me, I solemnly declare, that 
I am of no faction, and if any of my letters, taken aggregately 
or by paragraphs, convey any meaning which, in any con- 
struction, is offensive to your excellency, that was by no 
means the intention of the writer. After this, I cannot be- 



HAMILTON. 141 

lievef your excellency will either suffer your suspicions, or 
the prejudices of others, to induce you to spend another 
moment upon the subject. 

With great respect, I am, sir, 

Your excellency's most obedient, humble serv't, 

HORATIO GATES. 

" General Wilkinson," says Colonel Troup, " by his acti- 
vity and talents, and by the influence he had acquired over 
Gates' mind, rendered himself very important in the ope- 
rations which led to the convention of Saratoga. The con- 
sequent kindness of Gates honoured Wilkinson with being 
the bearer of Gates' despatches to congress ; and, during 
this event, Wilkinson, in carrying the despatches, loitered 
so long on his way that the intelligence preceded him r 
which induced Roger Sherman, a shrewd member from 
Connecticut, to move in Congress that Wilkinson should 
be complimented with a pair of spurs. In the course of 
some weeks afterwards, Gates was informed that the sub- 
stance of the correspondence was known to General Wash- 
ington. 

" The information excited such unpleasant feelings in the 
breast of General Gates, as to impel him to make inqui- 
ries among the gentlemen of his family to discover the 
traitor. These gentlemen positively disavowed all know- 
ledge of the traitor, and declared their inability even to 
suggest any clue to his detection. 

" It cannot be matter of surprise, in the absence of all 
other evidence, that circumstances so colourable should have 
made a serious impression on General Gates. The impres- 
sion was more serious against Colonel Hamilton than Co- 
lonel Troup ; for the former, though very young, had, by 
his extraordinary talents, and the correctness of his con- 
duct, acquired a standing at head-quarters that kindled the 
jealousy of some officers who were inclined to think unfa- 



142 THE LIFE OF 

vourably of General Washington. Not long after, the mys- 
tery was unravelled by satisfactory proof that General 
Wilkinson was the traitor. It appeared that in going to 
congress with despatches, he fell in with a part of General 
Washington's army at Reading : there, in a convivial party 
of which an aid of Lord Stirling was one, Wilkinson dis- 
closed the substance of the correspondence, and his lord- 
ship on receiving the fact from his aid, hastened to commu- 
nicate it to General Washington, whereby the honour of 
Colonel Troup and Colonel Hamilton were left without 
the shadow of reproach. 

" The treachery of Wilkinson had the effect of severing 
the ties which had long bound him and General Gates to 
each other ; and in the end it likewise produced a duel be- 
tween them, which fortunately terminated without the 
shedding of blood." 

The communications with Gates were closed on the 24th 
February, 1778, with a cold, dignified, and withering as- 
sent to his humble proposition to bury all that had passed 
in oblivion. 

WASHINGTON TO GATES. 

Valley Forge, February 24th, 1778. 

SIR: 

I yesterday received your favour of the 19th instant. I am 
as averse to controversy as any man ; and had I not been 
forced into it, you never would have had occasion to im- 
pute to me even a shadow of a disposition towards it. 
Your repeatedly and solemnly disclaiming any offensive 
views in these matters which have been the subject of our 
past correspondence, makes me willing to close with the 
desire you express, of burying them hereafter in silence ; 
and, as far as future events will permit, oblivion. 

My temper leads me to peace and harmony with all 
men ; and it is particularly my wish to avoid any personal 



HAMILTON. 143 

feuds or dissensions with those who are embarked in the 
same great national contest with myself; as every differ- 
ence of this kind must, in its consequences, be injurious. 
I am, Sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

GEORGE WASHINGTON. 
Major General Gates. 

This correspondence, written on the part of Washing- 
ton, with a master's hand, while it covered Gates with 
shame and confusion, afforded to Hamilton abundant cause 
of exultation in so triumphant a vindication of his own cha- 
racter, and of the conduct of his chief. 

The justice of General Washington's charge that a fac- 
tion existed both in congress and the army, has never until 
recently been made a subject of doubt. 

The proceedings of congress, the attestation of the few 
survivors of the revolution, and the confidential corres- 
pondence of the officers, place the fact beyond all question. 
It rests, exclusive of other evidence, on the testimony of 
Washington, Greene, and La Fayette, Colonels Harrison, 
Hamilton, and Laurens. 

On the seventeenth of October, 1777, congress, departing 
from their established practice of confining such powers to 
their own body, determined to create a Board of War, to 
consist of three persons, not members of congress, which, 
among various other duties, was directed " to superintend 
the several branches of the military establishment ;" all 
officers were enjoined to observe its directions, and the states 
were recommended to give this board all necessary assist- 
ance in the execution of the business of their department. 

On the thirty-first of October, Colonel Wilkinson announ- 
ced officially to congress the capture of Burgoyne, of which 
they had been previously advised ; and a committee, con- 
sisting of Samuel Adams, Richard Henry Lee, and Mr. Ro- 



144 THE LIFE OF 

berdeau, was appointed to prepare a recommendation to the 
states to set apart a day of thanksgiving for this signal suc- 
cess, which on the ensuing day was reported to congress, 
and breathed all the deep-toned fervour of religious enthu- 
siasm which mark the character of Samuel Adams. 

On the fourth of November, resolutions of thanks to Ge- 
neral Gates and to the officers serving under him, which this 
important event justly called for, were passed by congress. 
The friends of Gates were not content with this ; and not- 
withstanding he had volunteered through Wilkinson an apo- 
logy for the terms of the capitulation, which had already 
called forth the loudest public reprobation, and than which 
nothing could have been more futile ; " that the reduction 
of Fort Montgomery, and the enemy's progress up the river 
endangered the arsenal at Albany, a reflection which left 
him no time to contest the capitulation," these terms were 
" pronounced honourable and advantageous to the states." 
At the same time, the committee to whom the motion for 
directing the future operations of the army under General 
Gates was referred, brought in a report, which, after de- 
bate, was committed, and Mr. Duer added to the com- 
mittee ; and, on the ensuing day a report was introduced, 
upon which it was resolved, "that General Washington be 
informed that it is the earnest wish of congress to regain 
the possession of the forts and passes of the Hudson river," 
and that for that purpose General Gates should remain in 
command in that quarter, and that Putnam join the main 
army with such a detachment from Gates' army " as Gene- 
ral Washington may think can be spared, not exceeding twen- 
ty-five hundred men, including Colonel Morgan's corps." 
Authority was given Gates to order such of the continental 
troops and militia as were posted near the Hudson to join him ; 
and he was empowered to call on the several states for such 
number of militia as he shall judge necessary, to maintain 



HAMILTON. 145 

the posts on the river, " to the end that his army may be in 
readiness to pursue such operations as congress shall direct." 
He was also authorized to ask all farther means he required. 
The governor and council of New-York were directed to be 
furnished with copies of these resolutions ; to appoint a com- 
mittee to assist Gates, which committee were requested and 
empowered to call on the states of New-Hampshire, Mas- 
sachusetts, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New- York, and New- 
Jersey, to furnish such number of men as he should require 
for this object ; and farther authority was given to him to 
call for all the necessary aids to reduce Ticonderoga and 
Fort Independence ; to which was added a resolution, 
" That if General Washington, after consulting General 
Gates and Governor Clinton, shall be of opinion that a lar- 
ger reinforcement can be detached to the main army, con- 
sistent with the attainment of the objects, (previously speci- 
fied,) in such case he be directed to order such farther rein- 
forcements to the main army, as may be thought conducive 
to the general welfare, any thing in the preceding resolution 
to the contrary notwithstanding."* 

In debating the last resolution, it was moved after " di- 
rected" to insert " with their concurrence" which was ne- 
gatived by a vote of all the states except Massachusetts and 
one vote from Rhode-Island, and the general resolutions 
were adopted by every state except Massachusetts, which 
was divided, and by one vote from Rhode-Island.f 

* This resolution appears on the journals as a part of the report of this 
committee. This would seem to be an error ; as its effect is to defeat the 
intention of the report, the probability is, that it was proposed to be appended 
to the report with that view, and that on that motion the amendment was sug- 
gested. 

t The votes were as follows : For inserting " with their concurrence." 

Affirmative. Messrs. Samuel Adams, John Adams, Gerry, Marchant, 
Dyer. 5. 

Negative. Messrs. Folsom, Lovell, Law, Williams, Duane,Duer, Elmer, 
VOL. I. 19 



146 TIIE LIFE OP 

The importance of drawing reinforcements, at this time, 
from the northern army, and the disastrous consequences 
which resulted from General Gates' conduct, have been seen 
in the previous chapter. 

Early in the month of October, General Vaughan, in or- 
der to create a diversion in favour of Burgoyne, moved up 
the Hudson, came in sight on the fifth, and on the night of 
the sixth of that month attacked the Forts Clinton and Mont- 
gomery. The former, a circular height, defended by a line 
for musketry, with a barbet battery in the centre of three 
guns, and flanked by two redoubts : the latter, "strongly 
fortified by nature, almost inaccessible in itself, and suffi- 
ciently manned," were both, " after a feeble and unskilful de- 
fence, carried by storm," and the greater part of the troops 
captured, with the loss of cannon and stores of immense 
value, and of two frigates. Governor Clinton, who com- 
manded, a man of courage, and, on most occasions, active 
and vigorous, having escaped. 

On the fifteenth of the same month, the enemy made a 
descent on Esopus, which, with a barbarity that affixed in- 
famy on the expedition, was burnt to the ground ; no de- 
fence other than the scattered firing of the inhabitants being 
offered, while a large body of troops remained unemployed 
in the vicinity. 

While Gates assigned to Hamilton " a projected attack on 
Ticonderoga, and the importance of the arsenal at Albany," 
as the pretext for maintaining an army around him, the re- 
covery of these fortresses was deemed by his party in con- 
Morris, Roberdeau, Clingan, Smith, Rumsey, Jones, F. L. Lee, Harvie, Penn, 
Harriett, Laurens. 18.

gress a more adequate reason ; but it was a wholly insuffi- 
cient one. 

On the first of November, Washington had addressed an 
official letter to that body, informing them that he had writ- 
ten to Generals Dickinson and Forman, to afford every aid 
in their power to the posts on the Delaware ; mentioning 
the mission of Hamilton to Gates ; that the enemy were 
stronger than he had supposed ; that reinforcements were 
coming in to General Howe, while by the departure of the 
Virginia militia, he had no aid to the continental troops other 
than a body from Philadelphia and a few from Maryland, 
and giving indisputable reasons for his not attempting to dis- 
lodge the enemy from Philadelphia. 

Notwithstanding these circumstances, the Cabal had given 
to Gates an independent command ; had limited, by its first 
resolution, the succours which Washington was to receive to 
two thousand five hundred men, although he had deemed 
nearly three times that number necessary to enable him to give 
a decisive blow to the enemy ; and had sought by the last, to 
render the extent of the reinforcements, and the measures of 
the main army dependent on the concurrence of an inferior 
and a rival ; as to whom it was the intention, that he should 
add to his newly-earned honours, the easy recovery of the 
Highland passes, " to the end that his army might be in rea- 
diness to pursue such operations as congress shall direct ;" 
while, in the mean time, the fall of the posts on the Delaware, 
and the undisturbed possession of Philadelphia by the ene- 
my, would have produced such invidious contrasts, and art- 
fully excited discontent would have become so loud, and 
calumny so bold, that an apparent deference to public opin- 
ion might have justified the sacrifice of Washington. 

The refusal of the commander-in-chief to march directly 
to Philadelphia, on the embarkation of Howe, in the pre- 
ceding spring, was one of the earliest avowed causes of 
dissatisfaction. 



148 THE LIJB OF 

The state of Pennsylvania, which had hitherto escaped 
the calamities of invasion, readily listened to the suggestions 
which were thrown out against Washington ; and many 
members of congress, who looked to the preservation of 
that city as the principal subject of solicitude, were willing, 
for this purpose, to sacrifice the more important object of 
preventing a junction of the British forces. 

These feelings, unfortunately for the service, found a 
powerful auxiliary in General Mifflin, a native of Pennsyl- 
vania, of extensive influence, great activity and great per- 
sonal popularity, but of a hot, impatient temper, an ambition 
little disposed to be satisfied with a fair share of favour, and 
a judgment, which, though prompt, was not free from the 
influence of flattery or prejudice. 

This gentleman had performed, at the beginning of the 
revolution, the duties of Quarter-master-general, a station 
which he left ; but, after serving a short time in the line of 
the army, resumed, at the request of congress, in the autumn 
of 1776, and continued to fill until just before the army retired 
from the field. 

A committee of congress, appointed to investigate the state 
of that department, made a report conveying the most seri- 
ous censures upon General Mifflin. The public property was 
represented as being scattered in every direction, and only 
saved by the casual interference of some officer of the line. 
"Not a gentleman of any rank in this department is in 
camp, although the duties of the office require constant and 
unremitting attention. Not a moment's time," say they, 
" is to be lost, in placing a man of approved abilities and 
extensive capacity at the head of the department, who will 
restore it to some degree of order and regularity, whose 
provident care will immediately relieve the wants of the 
army, and extend itself to those which must be satisfied, be- 
fore we can expect vigour, enterprise, and success." 

Such censure, the frequent, nay constant and unavoid- 



HAMILTON. 149 

able complaints of Washington, and his earnest desire to place 
Greene at the head of this department, between whom and 
Mifflin unkind feelings existed, were alike calculated to irri- 
tate his mind, and embitter his hostility to the commander- 
in-chief. 

On the 8th of October he addressed a letter to congress 
requesting leave to resign his commission as major-general 
and quarter-master-general, on account of ill health. 

Compelled by the force of public opinion, congress ac- 
cepted his resignation as quarter-master-general, but resol- 
ved that his rank and commission as major-general should 
be retained, but without pay, until their farther order. 
And yet on the same day, such was the influence of the 
cabal in congress, that, in the selection of the members of 
the board of war, Mifflin was placed at its head ; while to 
render it less offensive to Washington, Colonel Pickering, 
and Colonel Harrison, the general's secretary, were asso- 
ciated with him. 

Notwithstanding the language of congress respecting the 
terms of the convention with Burgoyne, the public discon- 
tent could not be stifled. The committee of New- York 
wrote in terms of the strongest censure ; and it became 
necessary to bring the subject again under the considera- 
tion of congress. The committee to which it was referred 
brought in a report ;* but in the belief that more time was 
necessary to obtain a proper knowledge of the facts, it was 
proposed to postpone the consideration of it, which was 
adopted,! but not without a wide division of opinion. J This 
subject was subsequently resumed, when motions for a 
committee of inquiry, and for obtaining intelligence, were 
defeated ; and yet such was the dissatisfaction of subsequent

congresses with this capitulation, that the obligations of good 
faith were forgotten at least, never fulfilled. 

General Mifflin and Colonel Pickering accepted seats at 
the board of war, but Colonel Harrison, from considerations 
of delicacy arising from his relation to the commander-in- 
chief, declined the appointment. 

Within a short interval, a report of the board of war 
stated, that, after a conference with General Mifflin, they 
were of opinion, that " a sufficient number of commissioners 
had not been appointed in order to give due weight to the 
execution of the regulations which might be recommended 
by the board, and adopted by congress, and particularly for 
enabling one of the board to visit, from time to time, the 
different armies, in order to see that their regulations were 
executed, and to examine what the wants of the army were, 
and what defects or abuses prevail from time to time in 
the different departments." Upon this report it was resolved 
that two additional commissioners be appointed ; and on 
the 27th of November three commissioners were elected, 
and General Gates appointed President of the board of 
war. A resolution was also adopted, that the President of 
congress should inform General Gates of his appointment, 
expressing " the high sense congress entertain of his abili- 
ties and peculiar fitness to discharge the duties of that im- 
portant office, upon the right execution of which the success 
of the American cause does eminently depend that it is 
the intention of congress to continue his rank as major-ge- 
neral, and that he may officiate at the board or in the field, 
as occasion may require ; and that he be requested to re- 
pair to congress with all convenient despatch, to enter upon 
the duties of his appointment." 

The whole of the proceedings following the events which 
have been related were distinctly understood, as prepara- 
tory to more decisive measures of hostility : and the selec- 
tion of General Mifflin in the first instance, known to be 



HAMILTON. 151 

hostile to the commander-in-chief, and the choice of Gates 
as a coadjutor, at the head of a department, invested with a 
control of all the military operations with which Washing- 
ton had immediate intercourse, and upon which he must 
chiefly depend, left no room to doubt the nature of the in- 
fluence which then controlled the policy of congress. If 
any question could have existed, it was soon after removed 
by an act of the most unequivocal hostility this was, a 
resolution founded upon a report of the board of war, to 
whom were referred the letters of Brigadier Conway, " that 
it was essential to the promotion of discipline in the Ame- 
rican army, and to the reformation of the various abuses 
which prevail in the different departments, that an appoint- 
ment be made of Inspectors-General, agreeable to the prac- 
tice of the best disciplined armies in Europe" that this 
appointment be conferred on experienced and vigilant ge- 
neral officers, who are acquainted with whatever relates 
to the general economy, manreuvres, and discipline of a 
well-regulated army." 

Powers were conferred on this office in effect para- 
mount to those of the commander-in-chief. It was resolved 
that two inspectors-general should be appointed ; and on the 
same day* Conway was elected inspector-general, and also 
appointed a major-general of the army the man who had 
been detected intriguing with Gates, and whom Washington 
denounced as a " dangerous incendiary." 

This last step following the recent advancement of Wil- 
kinson to the grade of brigadier, was resented by the army 
as a gross indignity. General Greene in a manly and inde- 
pendent letterf rebuked the conduct of congress. A re- 
monstrance was presented by the general and field officers 
without the knowledge of Washington Conway was com- 
pelled to retire from the inspectorship, and Wilkinson to 
resign his short-lived honours. 

* December 13th, 1777. f Dated January 12th, 1778. 



152 THE LIFE OF 

The communications received by Washington from vari- 
ous parts of the country, and from his friends in congress, 
fully confirmed the belief that a party had been formed 
against him in that body, and was rapidly extending. 

Rumours were put in circulation, that, yielding to the 
public feeling, he purposed to resign, and to such an extent 
was the impression created, that some of his warmest 
friends were alarmed, lest, under all the pressure of cir- 
cumstances he might be led to this sacrifice. But Washing- 
ton was surrounded by men who knew his value, and would 
have sustained his determination had it faltered ; but never 
for an instant did he indulge a purpose of such fatal 
tendency. " The moment," said he, " I become sensible the 
majority of the people wish me out, I will resign ; until then 
I am determined to withstand this intrigue." 

His course was obvious : relying with confidence and 
security on his well-founded popularity, he assumed a tone 
of decision and independence in his correspondence with 
congress, which at once proved his fearlessness of the char- 
ges which were maliciously circulated against him, and his 
consciousness, that in an issue between that body and the 
nation, his policy would receive its just estimate. 

A short time after the appointment of Conway as in- 
spector-general, the same faction, in full pursuit of their 
object, though a committee had recently visited the camp, 
and reported measures of reform in the different depart- 
ments of the army, adopted with the concurrence of Wash- 
ington and Greene, succeeded in the election of a new 
committee* of three members of congress and three mem- 
bers of the board of war, to repair to head-quarters, with 
general powers, " to reorganize the different battalions ; to 
recommend the appointment of general officers ; to remove 
officers in the civil departments of the army, and to adopt 

* January 10th, 1778. 



HAMILTON. 153 

such measures as they should judge necessary for introdu- 
cing economy, and promoting discipline and good morals in 
the army." 

A committee with such powers, could be viewed in no 
other light than as a permanent court of inquiry on the con- 
duct of the commander-in-chief, to exercise the most rigid 
inquisition. The members of the committee were Messrs. 
Dana, Reed, and Folsom of congress, and Generals Gates, 
Mifflin, and Colonel Pickering of the board of war. 

Aware of the distressed situation of the army from the 
reiterated representations of the commander-in-chief, the 
same faction, as though their intention was to accumulate 
insult upon insult, adopted a resolution,* " applauding the 
rising spirit of the people of Pennsylvania to recover their 
capital, declaring the readiness of congress to aid in it, and 
directing the committee in camp to consult with the President 
and Council of Pennsylvania, and with General Washington, 
on the practicability of an attack." At the same time, 
anonymous charges were addressed to the President of 
Congress, to provoke the angry feelings of that body, and 
the excitement of the legislature of Pennsylvania was called 
in aid to co-operate with the projects of the Cabal. The 
language of this resolution, called forth an indignant remon- 
strance from the commander-in-chief, in which, after por- 
traying the condition of the army, destitute of food, cloth- 
ing, and shelter, he animadverted strongly on the reckless 
indifference to their sufferings, evinced by these agitators.f 

An incident occurred at this time, which marks the effect 

* January 16, 1778. 

| " I can assure those gentlemen, that it is a much easier and less distress- 
ing thing to draw remonstrances in a comfortable room, by a good fire-side, 
than to occupy a cold, bleak hill, and sleep under frost and snow, without 
clothes or blankets. However, although they seem to have little feeling for 
the naked and distressed soldiers, I feel superabundantly for them, and from 
my soul pity those miseries which it is not in my power to relieve or to pre- 
vent"

of the letter of the ninth of January, addressed by Washing- 
ton to Gates. It will be observed, that the appointment of 
the committee to visit camp, was made on the twelfth of 
January. That letter was received about this time ; for it 
will be perceived, by a juggle with his partizans, a resolu- 
tion was adopted on the twentieth of January, " that the 
members attending the business of the board of war, inquire 
of General Gates whether he can go to camp agreeably to 
his appointment, for the purpose expressed in the resolution 
of the tenth instant, and when he can set out on that busi- 
ness ;" and on the afternoon of the same day, " the members 
of the board of war reported to congress sundry reasons as- 
signed by General Gates why the members of the board of 
war ought immediately to enter on the business of that de- 
partment ;" and it was resolved tha't General Gates and Ge- 
neral Mifflin should be excused from attending camp, and 
Messrs. Morris and Carroll, (for the tide had already begun 
to turn,) known friends of Washington, were substituted. 
At the close of the preceding year, Messrs. Lee and Lo- 
vell, two members of the committee of foreign affairs, had 
enclosed to the commander-in-chief, a plan and various re- 
solutions of congress, for an attack upon Canada, during the 
next campaign, in conjunction with a body of French troops. 
In a very able letter received by congress from Washing- 
ton, all the bearings of this project were examined : The 
force necessary for success, the requisite supplies, the na- 
ture and extent of the resistance, the obstacles to be over- 
come, and the uncertainty of results depending on a co- 
operation upon so extensive and complex a plan, ( and requi- 
ring a coincidence of circumstances too fortunate to be hoped 
for ; and the scheme, it was supposed, had been abandoned ; 
but the successes on the northern frontier had, at this time, 
so much inflated the minds of that body, that a new pro- 
ject was brought forward and countenanced, for a winter 
expedition into Canada, and a committee was appointed to 



HAMILTON. 155 

confer with Washington on the means of carrying on this 
campaign. 

This committee, in an interview with him, had been fully 
satisfied that the project was impracticable, and, for a time, 
this design appeared also to have been relinquished. 

The Cabal had, however, decided not to yield their pur- 
pose, (a favourite object with the people,) which might have 
the double effect of adding lustre to their influence, and 
giving an opportunity to their favourite Conway to gather 
laurels, where Schuylerand St. Clair had been unfortunate. 

Notwithstanding the ascertained wants of the army* had 
induced congress, (forgetful of the principles which had so 
lately introduced into the confederation, the narrow clauses 
which were productive of so much subsequent inconveni- 
ence,) only a month prior to this time, to take the extraor- 
dinary step of recommending the enactment of laws, by 
the several legislatures, of the most oppressive and arbitrary 
character.! Within a week after the resolution to capture 
Philadelphia, the board of war, to whom the subject had 
been transferred from the committee previously appointed, 
introduced a report, which was adopted,^ recommending 

* Washington, in a circular, states, " that there were, on the twenty-ninth 
of December, two thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight men unfit for duty, 
by reason of their being barefoot and otherwise naked." December 29, 1777. 

f On the twentieth December, 1777, the legislatures were earnestly recom- 
mended forthwith to enact laws, appointing suitable persons to seize and take 
for the use of the continental army of the said states, all the necessary articles 
suitable for the clothing of the army ; to empower the commissary-general to 
seize stock and every kind of provision necessary for the army ; and among 
other things, to enact laws limiting the number of retailers of goods, who were 
to be compelled to take licenses and execute bonds ; that no person should sell by 
wholesale except the importer, and then only to such licensed retailers ; and pror 
viding, that no person, not licensed, should be permitted to buy more than was 
necessary for their domestic use. An address was published by congress to the 
states, in which a hope was expressed, that these measures would be carried 
into execution as secretly and expeditiously as possible. 

{ January 22, 1778. 



150 TUB LIFE OF 

that an irruption be made into Canada, and investing them- 
selves with authority, for the execution of this scheme 
under such general officers as congress should appoint, 
and to apply for such sums of money as they should think 
proper and requisite for the expedition, entirely departing 
from the established courtesy of consulting Washington. 

The succeeding day was chosen for the appointment of 
these officers ; when the Marquis de la Fayette, (to cultivate 
whose favour, after long delay, congress on the first of De- 
cember, had resolved it would be agreeable to them should 
be appointed to the command of a division,) Generals 
Conway and Stark were elected. , 

To use the language of La Fayette,* " among the gene- 
ral attacks upon the confidential friends of General Wash- 
ington, for it would have been too unpopular to have in- 
dulged in open attacks upon him personally, in which his 
pretended incapacity had rendered the campaign in the south 
so different from that in the north, under a general conver- 
sant with European tactics, and the much-lamented influence 
of such men as Greene, Knox, and Hamilton, over the sub- 
jugated mind of the commander-in-chief, were artfully sug- 
gested and circulated. It had not been deemed expedient 
to include La Fayette ; a better use, it was supposed, 
might be made of his growing popularity with the country, 
and of his correspondence with his friends in Europe." 

With this view, the selection of him had been made, 
though then but twenty years of age, and only six months 
in the country, to the command of a department attended 
with innumerable local difficulties, which no other than a 
native could surmount ; augmented by the character of the 
troops to whom the service must be confided, and depend- 
ing principally on militia, from whom nothing but the per-

HAMILTON. 157 

sonal influence of the general or the most exact discipline 
could derive any essential aid. 

The prospect of glory and separate command, it was 
supposed, would dazzle the youthful and ardent mind of 
La Fayette, and tempt him to become a partizan to their de- 
signs, while the real conduct of the enterprise would devolve 
on Conway. 

The proceeding of the board of war towards Wash- 
ington, on carrying this point, was in a similar spirit. The 
official letter from General Gates was transmitted to La 
Fayette, through the hands of Washington, without any ex- 
planation. 

Obvious as was the purpose of this insult, the delicacy of 
Washington did not permit him, on the delivery of the 
packet to the marquis, to say more than this : " Since it 
is to be so, I had rather it was you than any body else." 

" La Fayette, struck with the proffered opportunity of coun- 
teracting a measure, the tendency of which was not less in- 
jurious to the cause, than invidious to his paternal friend, 
under the pretence that it was necessary for him to visit 
congress to arrange the measures for the expedition, pro- 
ceeded immediately to York Town,* and there omitted no 
arguments with Gates,, and in his conferences with Laurens, 

* An incident occurred at this place, perhaps too minute to he recorded. Ge- 
neral Gates, soon after he was placed at the head of the board of war, thought 
fit to assume some appearance of state. His table was filled with plotting 
civilians, discontented officers, and favour-seeking foreigners ; and never was 
this giddy man more happy than when he saw assembled around him a little 
court, basking under the sunshine of his new fortunes. His festive air and 
high hilarity, were contrasted with the sober decencies which surrounded 
Washington, and seemed appropriate to one who carried fortune in his train. 
It was during a scene of this kind that La Fayette arrived, when, after much 
gayety, finding the standing toast omitted, he requested the gentlemen again 
to be seated, and said, " You have forgotten our beloved commander-in-chief, 
General Washington, and the army." This open avowal, by one whose in- 
fluence with France was so well known, alarmed those who had calculated 
on her aid, through the assurances of Conway, and dispelled the dream. 



158 THE LIFE OF 

the President of congress, to convince them that the whole 
charge of the military operations should be under the con- 
trol of the commander-in-chief. Finding that his views were 
little in accordance with the intentions of the faction, he 
firmly resisted the temptations which were offered by the 
glory and facilities of an independent command, and stated 
that, considering himself as one of Washington's family, he 
could not accept the trust, except on the condition that he 
should act under Washington's immediate orders." 

To this proposition the board of war were compelled to 
accede, and at the request of La Fayette, Baron de Kalb, a 
senior officer to Conway, was attached to the command. 

La Fayette having rendered this important service to the 
country, after a conference with Washington, proceeded 
immediately to Albany ; where, in pursuance of the instruc- 
tions of the board of war, he ought to have found a body of 
two thousand five hundred men, besides militia, at the Co- 
hoes, and all the means " of acting on the ice on lake Cham- 
plain and burning the British flotilla, whence he was to 
proceed to Montreal/' 

On his arrival at Albany, Schuyler, deeply affected with 
his recent conduct to Washington, generously volunteered 
to aid the marquis in the objects of his expedition, but the 
preparations being insufficient, the project was abandoned. 
La Fayette was rewarded for his alacrity by the thanks of 
congress, and retained this department through the winter ; 
while Conway, having on the failure of this plan been 
thrown out of command, was ordered to repair to the post 
at Peekskill, under McDougall. Finding himself sinking 
rapidly in public esteem, as his intrigues became known, 
he resigned his commission, and then endeavoured to re- 
sume it. On the 27th May, 1778, General Gates wrote to 
congress stating, " I hope sir, congress will not think me 
importunate when I say, I wish that the only gentleman 
who has left France with the rank of colonel of foot, 



HAMILTON. 159 

should not be returned to his prince and nation in any 
other manner than such as becomes the gratitude, honour, 
and dignity of the United States ;" but the exhortation was 
in vain ; and on the 28th of April, on a formal vote of con- 
gress of twenty-one members, four only voted in his favour, 
Messrs. Gerry, Chase, F. Lee and Banister of Virginia. 

Washington soon reaped the fruits of his elevated for- 
bearance : the party which had erected themselves against 
him, despairing of success, were contented with interposing 
petty obstacles and vexatious embarrassments ; which, 
though they added to the sufferings of the army, only served 
to call forth more signal evidences of the zeal of the officers, 
and virtue and patriotism of the troops, who all exclaimed, 
" No Washington No Army !" 

While this series of acts of a character by no means 
equivocal occurred, a tale had been artfully circulated 
at the seat of government, of designs in the army, inimical 
to the liberties of the republic. Direct efforts were stated 
to have been made to overturn the system of the confede- 
ration, and to invest the commander-in-chief with all the 
powers of government ; and it was insinuated that the lead- 
ing officers in the army were in favour of this project, and 
that it required only time for its completion. 

These calumnies, for there never existed a particle of 
evidence on which to sustain them, were cherished by the 
faction ; apprehensions for the national liberties were feign- 
ed ; the necessity of keeping a check on the army, and ex- 
pelling from it individuals whom the faction both feared 
and hated, became with them a popular topic, and a resolu- 
tion was pompously introduced and adopted by congress,* 
in which the friends of Washington were compelled from 
policy to concur, requiring oaths of allegiance to the United 
States, and of abjuration of Great Britain, to be taken by 
all the officers in service of government, and certificates

to be filed with congress of their compliance with this 
measure. Had a new motive or any instance of treason 
occurred? Had the cause of the nation suffered materi- 
ally from any noted violation of public engagements, or 
any recent manifestation been given of a disposition to 
compromise the national interests, this harsh measure, 
of a nature* always little efficacious in preserving fidelity, 
might have been resorted to ; but as a new pledge required 
from an army, who under more severe trials, and exposed 
to the greatest temptations, had sustained a character of the 
highest and most uncorrupted fealty to their country, it 
was regarded at the time and must always be considered, 
as the unnecessary demand of a too jealous caution, or as 
an outrage on a patriotism, and a devotion never surpassed. 
As a closing scene in the fate of this Cabal, a resolution was 
passed by congress, stating that "alarming consequences 
are likely to ensue, from a longer delay of appointing 
proper persons to fill the quarter-master-general's depart- 
ment ; that the committee at camp, in conjunction with 
General Washington, be authorized forthwith to make 
proper appointments." The arrangement of this depart- 
ment, as framed by the board of war was abandoned, and 
General Greene was appointed in place of Mifflin, who 
upon an inquiry being instituted preliminary to a court- 
martial, requested leave to resign. 

General Gates, in the mean time, (every scheme of the 
board of war over which he had presided having been 
found impracticable,) was directed to take the command of 
the posts on the Hudson, with authority to call on the ad- 
jacent states for aid in fortifying and obstructing that 
river, but with a prudent proviso full of meaning, suggested 
by the result of Hamilton's important mission to him in the 
previous autumn, " that he be directed from time to time 
to afford every assistance in his power, in forwarding the 



HAMILTON. 161 

drafts and other reinforcements destined for the main 
army." 

The country had now passed through the most trying 
period of its history ; and when a true estimate is formed 
of its situation at that moment, the surrender at Sara- 
toga, the event which established the United States among 
nations, must be regarded as the occurrence which por- 
tended to it the most serious calamities. 

Until that time America had seen little else but disaster. 
She then began to triumph ; and as the intelligence of this 
success spread over the country, the public mind became 
intoxicated, and even congress lost its balance. 

This attempt to unveil the counsels of that secret con- 
clave which doomed Washington to disgrace, which, 
would, in all probability, have defeated the revolution, or if 
not, would have robbed America of the pride of boasting a 
native as her leader, has unavoidably been imperfect ; but 
enough of truth has been gathered to indicate the path of 
inquiry. 

When time shall give the whole of this eventful story, the 
historian will not forget to remark, among other incidents, 
that while Pennsylvania was chilled and dissatisfied, the 
votes of Maryland, of North Carolina and Georgia di- 
vided. his native Virginia misrepresented, the power- 
ful influence of New-England marshalled under adverse 
leaders ; that New- York, though her metropolis and her 
mountain passes were in the hands of the enemy, her tem- 
porary scat of government in ashes, though just relieved 
from subjugation by the capitulation of Burgoyne, thus 
dismembered, and dislocated, maintained all her constancy 
and all her firmness. 

Justice to those patriots who resisted and ultimately de- 
feated this Cabal, would seem to require that the persons 
who composed it should be indicated ; but, as the removal 
of the commander-in-chief was never brought to a direct

question, and as the votes on several of the prominent acts 
which have been referred to, are not recorded, much must 
remain in uncertainty. 

Among the friends of Washington, were to be remarked 
the manly sense, the practised wisdom, the unbending firm- 
ness of Robert Morris, detecting by his strong sagacity 
every intrigue of the opposition, and overcoming their ob- 
stinacy by his superior determination. There was also 
found Charles Carroll, whose high and generous constancy 
of character inspired confidence in his friends, and pre- 
vented the zeal of party from blinding those who were 
under its influence. There, also, the rich and varied powers 
of Gouverneur Morris were forever kept in play, surpri- 
sing all around him by the fertility of his erratic genius. 
There was Duer, with stores of wit that never were ex- 
hausted, and a rich, vivid, and spontaneous eloquence that 
rose with every renewed effort, braving, defying, and dis- 
concerting the hostile majority. There, also, were Bou- 
dinot of New-Jersey, Burke of North Carolina, Paca of 
Maryland, and others whose names are not distinguished. 

Of the individuals who were believed to have controlled 
the measures of the Cabal, the Lees and the Adamses* 
have been indicated as the most conspicuous. As to the 
former, the allegation has been denied ; and of the part 
taken by John Adams, who was nominated at the height 
of its influence a Commissioner to France, history is silent, 
and has directed its attention to Samuel Adams, whose 
early services, zeal, and proscription have imparted to his 
character a singular interest ; but who, born with all the 
qualities to aid in subverting an established government, 
was devoid of those necessary to build one up. 

Proceeding on the principle that all confidence is unsafe, 
he laboured to confine the powers of the confederation

HAMILTON. 103 

within the narrowest limits, and opposed with obstinacy 
every effort to enlarge them. 

This spirit of indiscriminate distrust darkened all his 
counsels, and was combined with a fanaticism which disre- 
garded experience, and undervalued human agency. Thus 
in the most alarming periods of the revolution, when the 
condition of the country ought to have unchained his mind, 
while he cheered the hesitating with reiterated appeals 
to Providence,* he opposed long enlistments, from an appre- 
hension of standing armies, and contended for a rotation in 
command, on the ground that if the precedent were once 
established, " no military chieftain could ever take a flight 
beyond the reach of vengeance." 

With these doctrines, he swayed for a time the coun- 
cils of the congress of seventeen hundred and seventy-seven, 
which he characterized " as the smallest but truest con- 
gress they ever had ;" and without, probably, any malevo- 
lence to Washington, or respect for Gates, he engaged 
warmly in the projects of the Cabal, to displace the former 
from the command and advance his rival. 

* An instance of this kind is related of this more than ordinary man, who 
led on the bold by his courage, and stirred up the tranquil by his arts ; and 
who though himself the victim of superstition, was not the less aware how 
deep its sources spring in the human breast. At a moment when congress 
was sitting disheartened and hesitating, the arrival of a vessel with military 
stores from France was announced. Availing himself of this intelligence, he 
arose from his seat, and exclaiming with extended arms " It is a sign from 
Heaven ! Providence, Providence is on our side!" dissipated the doubts of 
those around him. With the same sublimated feeling, when an unlimited 
price was offered him by an agent of the king, he replied in a determined 
manner : " I trust I have long since made my peace with the King of Kings. 
No personal consideration shall induce me to abandon the righteous cause of 
my country. Tell Governor Gage ' It is the advice of Samuel Adams to him 
to insult no longer the feelings of an exasperated people.' " 



CHAPTER VIII. 

[1778.] 

THE events of the last campaign had indicated the ne- 
cessity of more efficient measures for the organization of 
the army ; and congress, yielding to the earnest solicitation 
of Washington, now entered upon this duty. Before sta- 
ting the measures which were adopted, a few preliminary 
remarks may be necessary. 

Rarely were a people less prepared for arms than the 
American colonists at the commencement of the revolution. 
They had neither soldiers, generals, nor engineers ; neither 
the munitions* nor the knowledge of war; all were to 
be acquired by exertion and experience, and every thing 
to be surmounted by energy and fortitude. 

Among the few individuals who had reaped military in- 
formation in the war of seventeen hundred and fifty-six, 
Washington was the only American who had obtained an 
extensive reputation. Eminent as were the soldierly qua- 
lities which he there displayed, his experience was too limit- 
ed to entitle him to the principal command ; and on the 
large scale on which the war was to be conducted, he had 
almost all its science to learn. 

Philip Schuyler, known as Colonel Schuyler, was the 
only other member of the congress of seventeen hundred 
and seventy-five who had any pretensions to the character 
of a soldier ; the capacity in which he had previously served, 
had given him an accurate knowledge of the civil depart- 
ments of an army, but beyond this, his attainments did not 
extend ; and whatever other information he possessed, was 

*May 11, 1776, the leod was torn from the roofs of the Exchange and City 
Hall for bullets, and every article of brass taken from the houses. 



166 THE LIFE OF 

the acquisition of an active mind, fruitful in resource, and 
of great practical energy. 

The duty of organizing the military establishment was 
confided by congress to these two gentlemen.* The first 
object to which, after filling the general staff, congress di- 
rected their attention, was the organization of the militia. 
All the inhabitants of the colonies, fit for duty, were recom- 
mended to form military associations ; one-fourth of whom 
were to be chosen minute men, distributed into battalions 
and companies, to be relieved by new drafts, after perform- 
ing a tour of four months' duty ; the field officers to be ap- 
pointed by the conventions of the respective states. Such 
was the embryo of an army, destined to win the liberty of an 
extensive empire. 

Of this kind of force General Washington was authorized 
to employ a body, not to exceed twenty-two thousand 
troops, in the vicinity of Boston ; and five thousand more, 
under the command of General Lee, were directed to be 
mustered for the protection of New- York. 

At an adjourned meeting of congress,f a new continen- 
tal army was ordered to be enlisted for one year, by battal- 
ions, to be raised in the respective colonies, according to 
their numbers ; and of these, the forces intended to be en- 
camped near Boston, were to amount to twenty thousand 
men. 

Powers were, at the same time, conferred on the com- 
mander-in-chief, of impressing whatever might be necessary 
for its use, and of calling forth, from time to time, portions 
of the reserve. 

The enlistments, under this arrangement, gave little assu- 
rance of success in creating an efficient force. The spirit

of the people brought them rapidly into the field on an emer- 
gency ; but there were few of that order of men who 
would, from choice, endure the privations of a military life, 
augmented as they were by the defects of a new and very 
imperfect establishment. 

The prejudices of the country were also strong against 
any thing in the shape of a regular army. In vain were 
the militia required to submit, while in service, to the arti- 
cles of war. Both officers and men resisted every mea- 
sure for the introduction of discipline ; and it will be re- 
marked, as a strong indication of the prevailing jealousy 
of an exercise of power over the militia, that within a 
month after authorizing them to be called into service by 
the commander-in-chief, congress found it necessary, in 
compliance with public opinion, and at a time when they 
were waging a contest for their liberties with the greatest 
empire of Europe, to pass a resolution, that these powers 
were only to be exercised with the consent of the state 
authorities.* 

In the winter of the ensuing year, measures were taken 
for more efficient arrangements : of these, the division of 
the colonies, into military departments, was among the first. 
Those north of Virginia composed the northern ; the re- 
mainder the southern ; while, from the desire of preserv- 
ing the operations in that quarter distinct, that of Canada 
formed a third department. 

On the arrival of the English troops near New- York, 
more vigorous measures were adopted. An order was 
issued for a levy of thirteen thousand eight hundred men 
to reinforce the army, a flying camp of ten thousand more 
was directed to be embodied in the Jersies, and the gene- 
ral staff enlarged. 

These were, however, all temporary expedients. The

168 THE LIFE OF 

result of the contest on Long Island proved how little reli- 
ance could be placed on militia, for any other purpose than 
as transient auxiliaries ; and, although the exertions of their 
officers gave to particular corps discipline and system, yet 
for a general scale of connected operations, they were 
utterly inefficient. The letters of Washington are full 
of the most urgent solicitations for a permanent esta- 
blishment, without which he felt that he was waging a 
hopeless contest, alike disastrous to the American cause, 
and fatal to his own reputation. In one instance, he avows, 
after enumerating the difficulties under which he laboured, 
" If I were called upon to declare upon oath whether the 
militia have been most serviceable or hurtful, on the whole, 
I should subscribe to the latter." 

Experience did more to effect a change than the most 
cogent arguments ; and after a protracted discussion of 
a report from the Board of war, which had been elected 
in the preceding month of June, congress adopted a re- 
solution* to raise eighty-eight battalions, to be enlisted for 
three years, or during the war, to be apportioned among 
the several states, giving a bounty to those who served 
to its close ; at the same time jealously providing that 
the appointment of all, except general officers, should re- 
main with the states, though the commissions proceeded 
from congress, and confiding to the states the provision of 
arms and munitions for their respective quotas. 

This resolution, in pursuance of the suggestion of the 
commander-in-chief, was followed by the introduction of 
more efficient articles of war. 

At the close of the year,f the fears of congress extorted 
from them a resolution, investing Washington for a term 
of six months with general powers ; and their critical

HAMILTON. 169 

situation reconciled parts of the country to those powers 
being carried into operation.* 

But the progress of military discipline was slow : to 
define the duties of each station was not an easy task ; the 
exigencies of the army often excused the transition of the 
different departments from their proper spheres ; and even 
in the general staff, so prone was the disposition to question 
the authority of the commander-in-chief, that Washington 
found it necessary through the medium of General Greene, 
to obtain a declaration from congress, that it never was 
their intention that the commander-in-chief should be 
bound by the decision of a council of war. 

Great accessions were made to the science of the army 
in the progress of the campaign of 1777. France gave us 
La Fayette, the young enthusiast of liberty, who here 
offered his first vows to that cause with which his name 
will forever be identified ; the generous, the gallant, the 
gifted De Noailles the accomplished soldier Du Portail 
the unfortunate Custine the warm-hearted and volatile 
Fleury Du Plessis,f as modest as he was gallant, the 

* Congress made a communication to the convention of New- York, to 
soften their feelings as to this measure. The consideration of it was post- 
poned.

Brandywine, Gerraantown, and his distinguished services at Fort Mercer, 
where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artillery entitle him 
to the particular notice of congress. Whose conduct at Red Bank com- 
manded the highest applause, and who after the evacuation was determined 
upon, undertook as a volunteer, the hazardous operation of blowing up the 
magazine without the apparatus usual on such occasions. I must farther add 
that he possesses a degree of modesty not always found in men who perform 
brilliant actions. It is with pleasure that I recommend to congress to give 
him a brevet of lieutenant-colonel. I hope there will be no difficulty in 
antedating the brevet, that the recompense may more immediately follow the 
service which he has done."

inheritor of the virtues of his great ancestor* the three 
brothers Armand Ternant, afterwards ambassador from 
France, and many others not less ardent for distinction. 

Prussia gave us the veteran Steuben, previously the aid- 
de-camp of the great Frederic, and the founder of Ameri- 
can tactics ; and to Poland we owe Pulaski, who fell at 
Savannah, and the patriotic Kosciusko. 

The services of these individuals were soon appreciated 
by the army ; and those who survived the contest, retired 
from the country clothed with every mark of respect which 
an infant nation could confer. 

But, in addition to these, crowds of mercenary adventurers 
flocked to the American standard, seeking bread and pre- 
ferment, and indulging the most presumptuous and over- 
weening pretensions. The embarrassments produced by 
this circumstance were many and serious ; besides the dis- 
gust which was created in the minds of the American 
officers on finding themselves postponed to men who were 
generally their inferiors in character and talent, the army 
was constantly embroiled by a series of petty intrigues, 
having for their object the personal advancement of parti- 
cular individuals. 

This evil had been felt before the close of the first cam- 
paign; but the situation of Washington interposed con- 
siderations of delicacy as to his sentiments on this point 
being made public. They were, however, communicated 
to Colonel Hamilton, and within a short time after he had

entered the family of the commander-in-chief, he address- 
ed the following letter to Mr. Duer. 

HAMILTON TO THE HON. WILLIAM DUER. 

The bearer of this is Mr. Malmedi, a French gentleman 
of learning, abilities, and experience. I believe he thinks 
himself entitled to preferment, and comes to congress for 
that purpose. 

At the recommendation of General Lee, he was made 
brigadier-general by the state of Rhode-Island, and filled 
the station to the satisfaction of his employers, as appears 
by a letter from Governor Cook, speaking of him in the 
highest terms of approbation. 

This had led him to hope that he would be adopted by 
the continent on an equal footing. But in this he will no 
doubt be mistaken, as there are many insuperable objections 
to such a measure. 

Among others, it would tend to raise the expectations of 
the Frenchmen, in general already too high, to a pitch 
which it would be impossible to gratify or endure. It 
might not, however, be amiss to do whatever propriety 
would warrant to keep him in good humour, as he is a man 
of sense and merit. 

I think policy would justify the advancing him a step 
higher than his former continental rank. 

Congress, in the beginning, went upon a very injudicious 
plan with respect to Frenchmen. To every adventurer 
that came, without even the shadow of credentials, they 
gave the rank of field officers. This circumstance second- 
ing the aspiring disposition natural to those people, carried 
the expectations of those who really had any pretensions to 
the character of officers, to such a length, that exceeded all 
the bounds of moderation. As it was impossible to pursue 
this impolitic plan, the congress have begun to retrench their 



172 THE LIFE OV 

excessive liberality; and the consequence has been uni- 
versal disgust and discontent. 

It would perhaps be injurious, as the French are much 
addicted to national punctilio, to run into the opposite ex- 
treme to that first embraced, and by that mean create a 
general clamor and dissatisfaction. Policy suggests the 
propriety of discriminating a few of the most deserving, 
and endeavouring to keep them in temper, even by gratify- 
ing them beyond what they can reasonably pretend to. 
This will enable us to shake off the despicable part with 
safety, and to turn a deaf ear to the exorbitant demands 
of the many. It will be easily believed in France that 
their want of merit occasioned their want of success, from 
the extraordinary marks of favour that have been con- 
ferred on others ; whereas, the united voice of complaint 
from the whole, might make ill impressions in their own 
country, which it is not our interest should exist. 

We are already greatly embarrassed with the French- 
men among us, and from the genius of the people, shall 
continue to be so. It were to be wished that our agents in 
France, instead of courting them to come out, were in- 
structed to give no encouragement, but where they could 
not help it ; that is, where applications were made to them 
by persons countenanced and supported by great men whom 
it would be impolitic to disoblige. Be assured, sir, we shall 
never be able to satisfy them, and they can be of no use to 
us, at least for some time. Their ignorance of our lan- 
guage, of the disposition of the people, the resources and de- 
ficiencies of the country, their own habits and tempers, 
all these are disqualifications that put it out of their power 
to be of real use or service to us. You will consider what 
I have said as entirely my own sentiments, and believe me 
to be with regard, 

Sir, your most humble servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 



HAMILTON. 173 

The remonstrances which were made on this subject 
received little consideration ; and it was soon discovered to 
be the policy of the Cabal to foster these men ; who, find- 
ing Washington unwilling to promote their views at the sa- 
crifice of the public interests, became parties and active 
instruments of a faction, by which they had been led to in- 
dulge the most sanguine expectations. 

Amid the various objects of moment which occupied his 
mind, Washington's temper could ill brook the importuni- 
ties with which he was continually beset ; and he was occa- 
sionally drawn into expressions of opinion which were 
readily seized upon, and made the subject of the most un- 
generous comments. 

Another source of difficulty, and one productive of the 
most serious inconveniences, especially when viewed in 
connexion with the preceding topic, was the imperfect con- 
dition of the regiments. 

The field officers in commission were so numerous, that 
adequate commands were in vain sought to be provided 
for them. It became necessary to combine selections from 
different corps ; whence arose another difficulty, the ap- 
pointment of officers from one state, to the command of the 
troops of another. 

To remedy these defects to devise a plan for the re- 
duction of the regiments to regulate rank, and to intro- 
duce system into the civil departments of the army, were 
the first objects which the commander-in-chief desired to 
accomplish, and which he pressed upon the attention of 
congress with unremitting solicitude. 

To aid these designs, within a short time after the army 
had taken up their winter quarters,* a committee of five 
members of congress was appointed to proceed to Valley 
Forge, and confer with the General. 

* January 11, 1778. 



174 THE LIFE OF 

Soon after their arrival in camp, on the twenty-eighth of 
January, 1778, a paper was submitted to the committee, 
giving a general outline of the defects in, and proposed 
amendments to, the existing arrangements. This produc- 
tion was digested with great labour, and bears the marks of 
the most studied precision of language, and of the most 
careful arrangement of its parts. 

From two successive drafts in his hand-writing, on which 
are minute notes of reference for information to the heads 
of the different departments of the army, it is manifestly 
the work of Colonel Hamilton ; a duty the more readily 
imposed upon him, from his having cultivated every oppor- 
tunity which the society of the foreign officers gave him, of 
adding a knowledge of the most approved innovations of 
modern science, to those principles which previous research 
and a strong military talent had led him to adopt. 

The primary measure suggested in this plan, was the 
half-pay and pensionary establishment ; a measure strongly 
indicated by principles of justice, and by the numerous re- 
signations, and " more frequent importunities for permission 
to resign, and from some officers of the greatest merit." 

This is followed by suggestions of the most feasible mode 
of completing the regiments, and altering their establish- 
ment, and a sketch of the existing condition of the army 
of the military resources of the different states, and a mi- 
nute examination of the situation of each branch of the ser- 
vice, in its civil, military, and medical establishment ; a new 
organization of it into eighty battalions* was proposed, and 
suggestions made, for correcting the various abuses by which 
it was so much embarrassed. 

This plan was accepted by the committee, reported with 
some alterations, approved by congress, and became the 
basis of the military system of the revolution. One propo- 

* To compose a force of forty thousand and twenty rank and file. 



HAMILTON. 175 

sition alone, that of the half-pay, was attended with great 
difficulty. After various amendments and votes, half-pay 
for seven years was granted, excluding the officers while 
they held any office of profit, and limiting the general offi- 
cers to the half-pay of colonels ; an arrangement which 
was afterwards stripped of its more objectionable features, 
and half-pay for life established ; and on the twenty-se- 
venth of May the new army establishment was created. 

But the success of the efforts to restore a discipline, 
chiefly depended on the conduct of the Quarter-master-ge- 
neral's department, which had now been placed on a bet- 
ter basis ; for while the soldiers could, with justice, reproach 
their officers with a non-compliance with their engage- 
ments, subordination was hopeless. This object was at 
last happily attained. 

It has been previously remarked, that the committee of 
congress had expressed a strong censure upon the adminis- 
tration of that department for along time past, and "point- 
ed to the selection of a man of approved abilities and ex- 
tensive capacity at the head of that establishment," as the 
only mean of restoring it to order and regularity. After 
frequent solicitations from Washington and other influen- 
tial persons, General Greene, with great reluctance, con- 
sented to accept the appointment. A new plan for this de- 
partment was framed, instead of the four branches into 
which it had been subdivided, without any due subordina- 
tion. One Quarter-master-general and two Assistants were 
recommended. On the twenty-eighth of January, 1778, 
General Schuyler was proposed to congress by the com- 
mittee at camp, as Commissary-general, and his appoint- 
ment was ardently desired by Washington ; but the party 
of Gates was against him. At the instance of the same 
committee, Jeremiah Wadsworth, a man of great vigour, 
talent, and independence of character was appointed to that 
place. Concert with the general staff ensued ; and though 



176 THELIFBOF 

at an immense expense, the soldiers were in a measure se- 
cured from the recurrence of those evils which had been 
so long and vainly deplored. 

An important result was also at this time attained by the 
adoption of a new plan of an Inspectorship, to which office 
the Baron Steuben had recently been appointed. 

The introduction of a new system of tactics was soon 
perceived in the improved discipline of the army, in the 
control of the detached commands, and in the regulation of 
the jarring duties of the officers. 

This measure was, in its outset, not free from difficul- 
ties. The undefined duties of this station gave rise to the 
greatest dissatisfaction among the officers, and continued 
embarrassment to the commander-in-chief, and indicated 
the necessity of retrenching the authority which, in their 
jealousy of General Washington, and from a desire to la- 
vish on their favourite extraordinary powers, the hostile 
party had conferred upon Conway. 

To effect this object in a manner which would avoid 
compromitting the General, Colonel Hamilton addressed 
the following letter to his friend Mr. Duer : 

HAMILTON TO DUER. 

Head Quarters. 
DEAR SIR : 

I take the liberty to trouble you with a few hints on a 
matter of some importance. Baron Steuben, who will be 
the bearer of this, waits on Congress to have his office ar- 
ranged upon some decisive and permanent footing. It will 
not be amiss to be on your guard. The Baron is a gentle- 
man for whom I have a particular esteem, and whose zeal, 
intelligence, and success, the consequence of both, entitle 
him to the greatest credit. But I am apprehensive, with 
all his good qualities, a fondness for power and importance, 
natural to every man, may lead him to wish for more ex- 



HAMILTON. 177 

tensive prerogatives in his department, than it will be for 
the good of the service to grant. I should be sorry to ex- 
cite any prejudice against him on this account ; perhaps I 
may be mistaken in my conjecture. The caution I give 
will do no harm, if I am ; if I am not, it may be useful. In 
either case, the Baron deserves to be considered as a valu- 
able man, and treated with all the deference which good 
policy will warrant. 

On the first institution of this office, the General allowed 
him to exercise more ample powers than would be proper 
for a continuance. They were necessary in the commence- 
ment ; to put things in a train, with a degree of despatch 
which the exigency of our affairs required ; but it has been 
necessary to restrain them, even earlier than was intended. 
The novelty of the office excited questions about its boun- 
daries ; the extent of its operations alarmed the officers of 
every rank for their own rights. Their jealousies and dis- 
contents were rising fast to a height that threatened to 
overturn the whole plan. It became necessary to apply a 
remedy. The General has delineated the functions of the 
inspectorship in general orders, a copy of which will be 
sent to congress. The plan is good, and satisfactory to the 
army in general. 

It may be improved, but it will be unsafe to deviate es- 
sentially from it. It is, of course, the General's intention 
that whatever regulations are adopted by him, should un- 
dergo the revision, and receive the sanction of congress ; 
but it is indispensable, in the present state of our army, that 
he should have the power, from time to time, to introduce 
and authorize the reformations necessary in our system. 
It is a work which must be done by occasional and gradual 
steps, and ought to be entrusted to a person on the spot, 
who is thoroughly acquainted with all our defects, and has 
judgment sufficient to adopt the progressive remedies they 
require. The plan established by congress, on a report of 

VOL. i. 23 



178 THE LIFE OF 

the Board of war, when Conway was appointed, appears to 
me exceptionable in many respects. It makes the inspector 
independent of the commander-in-chief ; confers powers 
which would produce universal opposition in the army, and, 
by making the previous concurrence of the Board of war 
requisite to the introduction of every regulation which should 
be found necessary, opens such a continual source of delay 
as would defeat the usefulness of the institution. Let the 
commander-in-chief introduce, and the legislature after- 
wards ratify or reject, as they shall think proper. Perhaps 
you will not differ much from me, when I suppose, that so 
far as relates to the Board of war, the former scheme was 
a brat of faction, and therefore ought to be renounced. 

There is one thing which the Baron has much at heart, 
which, in good policy, he can by no means be indulged in : 
it is the power of enforcing that part of discipline, which 
we understand by subordination, or an obedience to orders. 
This power can only be properly lodged with the com- 
mander-in-chief, and would inflame the whole army if put 
into other hands. Each captain is vested with it in his 
company, each colonel in his regiment, each general 
in his particular command, and the commander-in-chief 
in the whole. 

When I began this letter, I did not intend to meddle with 
any other subject than the Inspectorship ; but one just 
comes into my head, which appears to me of no small im- 
portance. The goodness or force of an army depends as 
much, perhaps more, on the composition of the corps which 
form it, as on its collective number. The composition is 
good or bad, not only according to the quality of the men, 
but in proportion to the completeness or incompleteness of 
a corps in respect to numbers. A regiment, for instance, 
with a full complement of officers, and fifty or sixty men, 
is not half so good as a company with the same number of 
men. A colonel will look upon such a command as un- 



HAMILTON. 179 

worthy his ambition, and will neglect and despise it ; a 
captain would pride himself in it, and take all the pains in 
his power, to bring it to perfection. In one case, we shall 
see a total relaxation of discipline, and negligence of every 
thing that constitutes military excellence ; on the other, 
there will be attention, energy, and every thing that can be 
wished. Opinion, whether well or ill founded, is the go- 
verning principle of human affairs. A corps much below 
its establishment, comparing what it is, with what it ought 
to be, loses all confidence in itself, and the whole army 
loses that confidence and emulation which are essential to 
success. These, and a thousand other things that will oc- 
cur to you, make it evident, that the most important advan- 
tages, attend the having complete corps, and proportional 
disadvantages, the reverse. Ten thousand men, distributed 
into twenty imperfect regiments, will not have the efficiency 
of the same number, in half the number of regiments. The 
fact is, with respect to the American army, that the want 
of discipline, and other defects we labour under, are as 
much owing to the skeleton state of our regiments, as to 
any other cause. What then ? 

Have we any prospect of filling our regiments ? My 
opinion is, that we have nearly arrived to our ne plus ultra. 
If so, we ought to reduce the number of corps, and give 
them that substance and consistency which they want, by 
incorporating them together, so as to bring them near their 
establishment. By this measure, the army would be infi- 
nitely improved, and the state would be saved the expense-, 
of maintaining a number of superfluous officers. 

In the present condition of our regiments, they are incapa- 
ble even of performing their common exercises without join- 
ing two or more together, an expedient reluctantly sub- 
mitted to by those officers who see themselves made second 
in command of a battalion, instead of first, as their com- 



180 THE LIFE OF 

mission imports, which happens to every younger colonel 
whose regiment is united with that of an elder. 

What would be the inconveniences, while the officers 
who remain in command, and who might be selected from 
the others on account of superior merit, would applaud 
themselves in the preference given them, and rejoice at a 
change which confers such additional consequence on them- 
selves ? 

Those who should be excluded by the measure, would 
return home discontented, and make a noise, which would 
soon subside and be forgotten among matters of greater 
moment. To quiet them still more effectually, if it should 
be thought necessary, they might be put upon half-pay for 
a certain time. 

If on considering this matter, you should agree with me 
in sentiment, it were to be wished the scheme could be im- 
mediately adopted, while the arrangement now in hand is 
still unexecuted. If it is made, it will be rather inconve- 
nient immediately after to unhinge and throw the whole 
system again afloat. 

When you determined on your last arrangement, you did 
not know what success the different states might have had 
in drafting and recruiting. It would then have been impro- 
per to reduce the number of corps, as proposed. We have 
now seen their success ; we have no prospect of seeing the 
regiments filled ; we should reduce them. 
, Believe me to be, with great esteem and regard, 
Dear sir, your obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

The measures here suggested were frequently brought 
before the consideration of congress, and various steps were 
taken to remedy the evil ; but the reduction of the army, 
always difficult and embarrassing, especially in popular go- 
vernments, required great deliberation in a war where too

often the caprices of individuals were unavoidably more con- 
sulted, than the public interest. 

The proposed limitation of the office of Inspector-general 
was made, and among his papers a draft of a plan for that 
department of the army, exists in Hamilton's hand-writing. 
It was proposed to congress by General Washington, in 
lieu of the system which had been framed in 1777, and was 
adopted in part on the fifth of May, 1778. 

This plan proposed the establishment of one inspector- 
general, six deputy inspector-generals, and one inspector 
to each brigade ; defined the duties of the office, rendering 
it subordinate to congress, to the board of war, and to the 
commander-in-chief, at the head of which it was proposed 
to place Baron Steuben, and also to introduce into it Gene- 
ral Cadwallader and Colonel Fleming. Of the former of 
whom, it is remarked in a letter from Washington, " that he 
is a military genius, of a decisive and independent spirit, 
properly impressed with the necessity of order and disci- 
pline, and of sufficient vigour to enforce it. He would soon 
perfect himself in the practical part, and be fit to suc- 
ceed to the first place in the department." Of Colonel Fle- 
ming, who has been previously mentioned as the early in- 
structer of Hamilton, it is observed, " he is an excellent dis- 
ciplinarian, and from long practice in the British army, has 
acquired the necessary knowledge." The military arrange- 
ments were soon after improved, by the better organization 
of the armoury department, and measures taken connected 
with the corps of cavalry, at the head of which it was sub- 
sequently* proposed to place General Cadwallader. 

In effecting the contemplated change in the inspector- 
general's department, "the fondness for importance," of 
which Hamilton speaks, in his letter to Mr. Duer, as a trait 
of Steuben, was the source of many a disquietude, for the

Baron was too valuable to be offended, and too sensitive to 
be easily satisfied. 

This petted veteran has been much misunderstood. He 
has been regarded as the type of a race now gone by. It 
has been supposed that his mind was ever in the drill, that 
he considered mankind as born for arms, and believed that 
the business of society was war. But his character rose 
far above that of a mere soldier. While in Paris, he was 
invited by the Count St. Germains to visit America, as the 
General most competent to organize an army. He arrived 
in seventy-seven ; and of the extent and value of his servi- 
ces, the conduct of the troops at Monmouth is the best com- 
mentary. His exertions were so successful, that at the close 
of the war few countries could boast a better disciplined or 
more serviceable corps than the American army. That he 
stood high in the favour of the great Frederick, is a proof that 
he was more than an ordinary man. His information was 
various, his intellect active and comprehensive, his temper 
energetic and decisive, his knowledge of men great, and in 
the intercourse of life he showed himself an accomplished 
gentleman. His disposition being generous and jovial, and 
his conversation various and playful, he was fond of socie- 
ty, of which he was a favourite, where a little proneness to 
parade placed him sometimes too much in advance. But 
his character had in it nothing repulsive or selfish ; and amidst 
all his imprudences, there shone forth many a gleam of the 
warmest benevolence. Of Hamilton he became exceed- 
ingly fond, who repaid this preference by every office of 
friendship. Aware of his profusion, he became the volun- 
teer trustee of his funds, and often would the old General, 
smiling, declare "the Secretary of the Treasury is my 
banker my Hamilton takes care of me, when he cannot 
take care of himself." 

Another subject was at this time taken into serious con- 



HAMILTON. 183 

sideration, the policy to be adopted towards the numer- 
ous Indians who threatened the frontier of the republic. 

The reluctance of the United States to employ them as 
auxiliaries, is among the most gratifying incidents in the 
early history of the Revolution. But this disposition was 
at last changed by the different policy of the enemy; and in 
a report framed by Mr. Gouverneur Morris,* stating "that 
unless they were employed with them, they would be em- 
ployed against them," suggesting " that there is great reason 
to believe that the novelty of their appearance in the field, 
the circumstances of horror and affright which attend their 
attack, will have a great effect upon the minds of men wholly 
unacquainted with such an enemy," it is proposed that the 
Southern Indians should be embodied under General Gist, 
and the Oneidas employed as light troops among whom 
Louis, a chief of considerable talent, was soon after commis- 
sioned as colonel, and served with singular fidelity through^ 
out the war. 

The pacific conduct of a large portion of the Mohawks, 
had been chiefly attributable to General Schuyler. In the 
reign of Queen Anne, his ancestor had been employed as su- 
perintendent over this savage people, and he became so po- 
pular, that his portrait was preserved among them with the 
greatest care, and brought out at every important council 
they held. This influence descended in the family ; and du- 
ring the fiercest moments of the contest, instances and mes- 
sages of mutual kindness occurred. The wild imaginative 
sensibility of this race clothed the person of Schuyler with 
an almost supernatural sacredness ; and it is a remarkable 
fact, that on the very day on which Miss McCrea was mur- 
dered, his wife and second daughter passed these hordes un- 
molested. Even until the close of Schuyler's life, parties 
are remembered to have been seen encamping near his

residence at Albany, preferring confident claims upon his 
bounty, indulging in mimic representations of their savage 
sports, and reminding him that he was descended from their 
" Great Father Queedir." 

The rejection by congress of the conciliatory bills which 
had been proposed by the British government, in conse- 
quence of the state of our negotiations at Paris, was fol- 
lowed by the arrival of Mr. Deane, with copies of the trea- 
ties which had been concluded with France the preceding 
winter. 

The acknowledgement of our independence by the rival 
of England, and the assurances of aid which were given* 
was an event which, after the many delays that had been 
interposed, elevated the hopes of the nation to the highest 
point. Copies of the treaties were circulated by order of 
congress a general thanksgiving was appointed and to 
add to the effect, the army of Washington celebrated with 
military pomp the alliance of the nations. 

The spirit of exultation which followed the capture of 
Burgoyne, though checked by the subsequent reverses of 
the year, and by the distresses of the army through the 
winter, again revived ; and for a moment the country indul- 
ged in the fond hope that their sufferings were now to end. 

The provident mind of Washington took immediate alarm, 
which a letter drawn up by Colonel Hamilton, in reply to 
General Greene, strongly depicts. 

WASHINGTON TO GREENE. 

In answer to your favour of the third, I give it clearly 
as my opinion, that no change has happened in our affairs, 
which will justify the least relaxation in any of our military 
preparations, and consequently, that the provisions you have 
been, and are making in your department, ought to be con- 
tinued in their fullest vigour and extent. 



HAMILTON. 185 

The intelligence from abroad is extremely favourable, 
and affords us an earnest of success, with proper manage- 
ment, but there is nothing in it that can make it prudent to 
depart in the smallest degree from the exertion we should 
otherwise have made. There may still be business enough 
to call out our most strenuous efforts. Britain is a country 
full of resources. Her interest and connexions in Europe 
are great ; an union within, under a popular administra- 
tion, which a principle of common danger may produce, 
would render her capable of great internal exertions. 

The storm which now seems to be rising in Europe may 
subside, and a compromise ensue between the contending 
powers, from which a change in the system may result, very 
advantageous to the views of our enemies. All these are 
events which may happen ; and which, if there were no 
other considerations, would make it unwise to suffer our- 
selves to be lulled into security, or to remit any endeavours 
that may serve to put our military affairs upon the most 
respectable footing possible. 

But it is also to be remembered, that the British army in 
America is still very considerable ; and if collected, would 
be formidable to all the force we should be able to oppose to 
it. In all probability, it will either be withdrawn or assem- 
bled at one point, for some vigorous and enterprising push, 
if it were only to make the way for a negotiation. The for- 
mer is more to be wished than expected. British pride 
would never submit to it, but in the last extremity; and per- 
haps we should flatter ourselves too much, to suppose that 
extremity exists. If the latter should be the case, remissness 
in our present preparations might be fatal ; or at any rate, 
could not fail to have a very injurious influence. The ene- 
my might obtain successes which would have a most un- 
happy operation upon the current of our sentiments at home, 
and upon the progress of our negotiations and growing 
friendships abroad. 

VOL. I. 24 



186 THE LIFE OF 

If we had nothing to fear from any offensive operations of 
the enemy, policy may require very extensive and important 
offensive operations on our part, which will make it neces- 
sary we should be prepared in the amplest manner at all 
points. 

In a word, in what manner so ever the remainder of the 
contest is to be prosecuted, whether it is to depend upon 
fighting or negotiation, a powerful army, well furnished 
with every apparatus of war, will put it in our power to 
meet all contingencies, with confidence and advantage, and 
to pursue the true interests of these States, through any com- 
bination of circumstances that shall present itself, with firm- 
ness and decision. 

Whether any or what change may happen in the local 
situation of the army, in the approaching campaign, or what 
disposition in your department may be requisite in conse- 
quence, are matters which, for particular reasons, I cannot 
yet determine. A council will soon be held, in which will 
be decided a general plan of operations for the army. When 
this is done, you will receive your instructions accordingly : 
in the mean time, you will proceed in the plan already on 
foot. With great esteem, I am, sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

G. W. 

These sentiments were repeatedly urged upon congress 
by the commander-in-chief, and the utmost efforts were 
made to check the growth of that supineness which, che- 
rished by the false expectations of the country, threatened 
the most alarming consequences. 

Within a short time after the date of this letter, a nego- 
tiation was again opened for the exchange of prisoners. 

The report of the board of war had shown that there 
were in captivity, at the commencement of the year, nearly 
seventeen hundred men. 



HAMILTON. 187 

The treatment they received excited the utmost indig- 
nation. During the summer the privates had been crowd- 
ed into sugar houses, deprived of their clothing, kept on 
short allowances, and debarred the privileges of being visit- 
ed by an American commissary. During the winter, both 
officers and men were confined in the provost guard, or in 
prison-ships, enduring unparalleled rigour, and rapidly sink- 
ing under privations and disease. 

These circumstances operated strongly on the feelings 
of the army. The negotiations which had failed were re- 
newed, and, with the sanction of congress, it was deter- 
mined to proceed to an exchange, without reference to 
certain controverted points. With this view, on the fourth 
of June Washington addressed the following letter to Co- 
lonel Hamilton, paying him the gratifying compliment of 
discretionary powers. 

" SIR, 

" Mr. Loring having been sent by Sir Henry Clinton to 
meet Mr. Boudinot, or any other person appointed by me 
for the purpose of effecting an exchange of prisoners, I 
have therefore to desire you (Mr. Boudinot being absent) 
to hear any proposals Mr. Loring may have to offer on this 
subject, and to do definitively whatever may be necessary 
towards the execution of a general exchange of prisoners ; 
and I do hereby assure you, that your proceedings in this 
instance will be ratified by me. 

G. WASHINGTON. 

Lt. Col. Hamilton. 

The mission was in part successful, and an exchange of 
the prisoners in Philadelphia followed. 



CHAPTER IX. 

[1778.] 

WHILE the United States, strengthened by an alliance 
with France, were indulging the most sanguine anticipa- 
tions of success, the British councils were full of embar- 
rassment and uncertainty. Stimulated by hatred of their 
great rival, they found their generous people again rushing 
forward to lavish their treasures, and expend their blood 
in a cause which the national sentiment had at first con- 
demned ; but how to achieve their object, or what new 
system of warfare to adopt, which could promise a more 
favourable result, was the great, the perplexing question. 

It had been found that New-England was fully able to 
cope with any aggression that might be made upon her. 
The efforts in New-York, though more successful, had 
secured a station for one army, but had resulted in the 
capture of another. The campaign of the Jersies had 
been little more than a mere marauding inroad, and the 
possession of Philadelphia, after vast losses, without weak- 
ening the confidence of the Americans in their eventual 
success, had placed their enemy in a position to extricate 
themselves from which, seemed to be the great object of 
solicitude. Results, the obvious consequences of this mad 
attempt to subjugate a people, who must be divided and 
debased before they can be conquered, were attributed to 
the incapacity of Sir William Howe ; and, in the idle hope 
that a new leader of her armies might better reward the 
efforts of the nation, the command was confided to Sir 
Henry Clinton. 

The intelligence that a French armament was destined to 
America, confirmed the purpose which had long been enter- 



190 THK LIFE OF 

tained of surrendering the prize of the last campaign, and 
concentrating the whole strength at New- York, there to 
await such a plan of operations as future events should 
develope. 

The increased and augmenting force of the Americans, 
rendered then* position in a city without works, and incapa- 
ble of being fortified, extremely perilous. Subsistence for 
the army becoming daily more difficult of attainment, 
which a blockade of the Delaware, by a French fleet, would 
entirely intercept, and the effective strength which on its 
embarkation in the preceding year had reached nearly 
eighteen thousand men, notwithstanding the reinforcements 
in the autumn, was reduced by losses and desertions to little 
more than eleven thousand. 

What would be the future operations of the enemy, be- 
came now the interesting problem w r ith the Americans. 
By many it was supposed that the threatened danger of 
their West India possessions would be seized, as a pretext 
to withdraw from the United States, which was counte- 
nanced by the evacuation of the Fort's Lee* and Washing- 
ton, and by the reduced number of the troops in New- 
York, now amounting only to six thousand three hundred 
men. By others, an attempt on the Highlands was expect- 
ed ; but this belief, the inadequacy of the force in Canada, 
necessary to co-operate, did not justify : Washington mean- 
while had ascertained! their purposes, and hoped to crush 
them by a decisive blow. 

* May 21st, 1778. 

t The most active surveillance was kept up at this time as to the movements 
of the British army. This duty was especially confided to Captain Allan 
McLane, who rendered invaluable services by his zeal, intelligence, and 
activity. The following is a letter addressed to him by Colonel Laurens. 

Head-Quarters, May 26th, 1778. 
SIR: 

I have received your letter and communicated its contents to his excellency. 
Intelligence becomes every moment more interesting. The grand fact of the 



HAMILTON. 191 

The British army broke up from their encampment on 
the eighteenth of June, and proceeding down the Delaware, 
landed in New-Jersey, at Gloucester, and on the same day 
marched to Haddonsfield. As soon as this information 
reached head-quarters, the commander-in-chief having de- 
tached General Dickinson to collect the Jersey militia, 
who had received orders from Governor Livingston, al- 
ways zealous and on the alert, to hold themselves in imme- 
diate readiness, and having commanded General Maxwell 
to follow the route of the enemy, convened a council of 
war to decide upon the plan of operations. At this council 
it was determined by a majority of its members to avoid 
either a general or partial engagement in opposition to 
the sentiments of Greene, Wayne and Cadwallader, who 
urged the opinion, that their true policy was to harass the 
enemy on their retreat, and without an unnecessary ex- 
posure of the army to seize the first opportunity of bringing 
on an engagement. 

The opinion of General Lee, who was particularly stre- 
nuous in opposing an attack, and whose reputation for mili- 
tary experience gave it a preponderating weight, caused 

enemy's design to evacuate the city being ascertained, no pains should be 
spared to discover, if possible, the precise moment when the event is to take 
place, and the route which their army will pursue ; whether they mean to 
cross the Delaware and march through Jersey, or cross the Schuylkill and 
march down to Chester, to embark there, on account of the tedious navigation 
through the chevaux-de-f'rize, and because they may cover their real march by 
a pretended attempt on this army. Endeavour to discover the number of 
transports, their situation on the river ; as well as that of the ships-of-war. 
whether the horses that have been embarked were really dragoon horses, or 
only those that are superfluous, as their heavy artillery and baggage is em- 
barked, and they would march as light as possible through Jersies, provided 
they go that way. What are the bridge-boats that you speak of? do you 
mean those that may be put together for facilitating the embarkation on board 
the transports? His excellency desires if you have sufficient ground for 

suspecting , that you will immediately secure them and send them to 

camp." 



192 THE LIFE OF 

great offence to the personal friends of Washington. He 
not only urged the impolicy of active operations, but endeav- 
oured to sustain it on grounds extremely mortifying to the 
pride of the American army. 

Colonel Hamilton, whose ardour for battle was fully sup- 
ported by a sense of duty, in an eulogium which he pronoun- 
ced upon General Greene, thus expressed himself in refer- 
ence to this determination. 

" I forbear to lift the veil from off those impotent councils, 
which by a formal vote had decreed an undisturbed passage 
to an enemy retiring from the fairest fruits of his victories, 
to seek an asylum from impending danger, disheartened by 
retreat, dispirited by desertion, broken by fatigue ; re- 
treating through woods, defiles, and morasses, in which his 
discipline was useless, in the face of an army superior in 
numbers, elated by pursuit, and ardent to signalize their 
courage. 'Tis enough for the honour of Greene to say, that 
he left nothing unessayed to avert and to frustrate so degra- 
ding a resolution ; and it was happy for America, that the 
man whose reputation could not be wounded without 
wounding the cause of his country, had the noble fortitude 
to rescue himself and the army he commanded from the 
disgrace with which they were both menaced, by the cha- 
racteristic imbecility of a council of war." 

The first movements of Sir Henry Clinton, rendering it 
doubtful which course he proposed to take, Washington, em- 
barrassed by the decision of the council, and yet unwilling 
to assume the responsibility of precipitating an engagement, 
took a circuitous route, by which he reached Hopewell, a 
place about five miles from Princeton, about noon of the 
twenty-third of June, where he halted until the morning of the 
twenty-fifth, having detached a small force under Arnold to 
take possession of Philadelphia. Meanwhile the enemy, 
with Dickinson and Maxwell harassing their left, and Gene- 
ral Cadwallader and Colonel Morgan annoying their rear

and right flank, gained the vicinity of Allentown. A letter 
written by Hamilton, by the orders of General Washington, 
to Cadwallader, from this point, explains the delay of the 
army, which has been the subject of animadversion. 

" DEAR SIR, 

"I have just received yours this day from the Draw Bridge. 
The army marched this morning to this place. It was my 
intention to have taken post near Princeton ; but finding the 
enemy are dilatory in advancing, I am doubtful of the pro- 
priety of proceeding any farther, till their intention is as- 
certained. I wish you to inform me more particularly of 
the obstructions which have been thrown in their way, that 
I may be better able to judge whether their delay is owing 
to necessity or choice. Any circumstance that may serve 
to throw light upon this question, I shall be obliged to you 
for, as it is of very great importance. If their delay is vo- 
luntary, it argues a design to draw us into a general action, 
and proves that they consider this to be a desirable event. 
They may, perhaps, wish to draw us off from the Delaware, 
far to the left, and then by a rapid movement gain o jr right 
flank and rear. 

" I should be glad of your sentiments fuFy as to their pro- 
bable designs, and the conduct which it will be most proper 
for us to observe in consequence. You will be pleased to 
continue to advise me punctually of every movement and 
appearance of the enemy. 

"Let me remind you of mentioning always the hour at 
which you w r rite, which is of the greatest moment." 

While the army was at this post, and Sir Henry Clinton 
was balancing between the route to Staten Island, which 
would expose him to the danger of crossing the Raritan with 
an army in his rear, and that which, leading to Amboy by 
way of Monmouth, gave him the advantage, if necessary ,of 

VOL. i. 25 



194 THE LIFE OF 

entrenching himself on the high grounds of Middletown, 
Washington called a second council of general officers, in 
which, supported by Greene, Wayne, and La Fayette, he 
urged the policy of pursuing the enemy, and bringing on an 
engagement before they could reach the eminences in their 
front. 

The former opinion, by the overruling influence of Lee, 
still prevailed ; and Washington was thus again placed in 
the dilemma, either of assuming the responsibility of an at- 
tack, or of subjecting himself to the imputation of pusillani- 
mously sacrificing the opportunity, which the advantage of 
the ground, and his superior force seemed to promise of a 
decisive victory. As soon as the council had broken up, 
Colonel Hamilton, anxious for the fame of his chief, and fear- 
ing that he might yield to the perplexity of his situation, 
called upon General Greene, and urged him to unite with 
him in pressing Washington to force an engagement. As 
they approached the General, sitting in his tent, he arose, 
and said, " Gentlemen, I anticipate the object of your visit ; 
you wish me to fight." Greene and Hamilton then reca- 
pitulated the reasons which had been advanced in the 
council ; avowing it as their opinion, that if the British were 
suffered to retreat unmolested, they were disgraced. 
Washington concurred, and an attack was decided upon. 
Unable to induce the council to recede from their decision, 
he succeeded in obtaining their assent to the detachment 
of fifteen hundred men, under General Scott, to join the 
corps on the left flank of the enemy. Even the strength of 
this detachment was a subject of controversy ; but the lion- 
hearted Wayne, firmly resisting the idea of inactivity, refu- 
sed to sign the resolutions of the council, and the point was 
ultimately carried. 

General Washington determined to take decisive mea- 
sures. In pursuance of this purpose, Wayne was sent for- 
ward with a thousand men to join the advanced corps, 



HAMILTON. 195 

now exceeding four thousand troops. The strength of this 
body rendering it a command proper for a Major General, 
and Lee yielding his priority, La Fayette was assigned to 
it by Washington, with instructions to Colonel Hamilton 
to accompany him, and aid in the execution of their design. 

The orders pointed strongly to the junction of this de- 
tachment, with the troops under Scott, to harass the ene- 
my, impede their march, and if possible bring on an en- 
gagement. 

" As the detachment," observes the Marquis, began to 
march, Lee, hearing that his concession of the command 
was viewed with surprise, came up to La Fayette, and 
stating his feelings, said that to him he confided his ho- 
nour." The Marquis, too generous to resist this appeal, 
assured him, that if no action occurred that day, and Gene- 
ral Lee should come out with the next detachment, that he 
would yield him the command. 

Meanwhile the advanced detachment pushed forward to 
Cranberry, from whence Hamilton writes on the twenty- 
fifth, confirming the information that the enemy had filed 
off from Allentown, to the heights of Monmouth, the posi- 
tion it had been apprehended they would attain, and says, 
" I recommend to you to move towards this place as soon as 
the convenience of your men will permit. I am told that Co- 
lonel Morgan is on the enemy's right flank : we had a slight 
skirmish with their rear this forenoon, on the Monmouth 
road, leading from Allentown." On the twenty-sixth, he 
writes to General Washington, who had moved forward on 
the evening of the twenty-fifth, and arrived at Cranberry 
next morning. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

Robins' Tavern, 8 miles from Allentown, 12 o'clock. 
" SIR, 

" We have halted the troops at this place, eight miles from 



196 THE LIFE OF 

Allentown. The enemy, by our last reports, were four 
miles from this, and had passed the road which turns off 
towards South Amboy, which determines their route to- 
wards Shrewsbury. Our reason for halting is, the extreme 
distress of the troops for want of provisions. General 
Wayne's detachment is almost starving, and seem both un- 
willing and unable to march till they are supplied. If we 
do not receive an immediate supply, the whole purpose of 
our detachment must be frustrated. 

"On my arrival at Cranberry last evening, I proceeded, by 
desire of General the Marquis, immediately to Hyde's 
Town and Allentown, to take measures for co-operating 
with the different parts of the detachments, and to find what 
was doing to procure intelligence. I found every precau- 
tion neglected ; no horse was near the enemy, or could 
be heard of till late in the morning ; so that before we could 
send out parties, and get the necessary information, they 
were in full march, and as they have marched pretty expe- 
ditiously, we should not be able to come up with them 
during the day, even if we did not suffer the impediment we 
do on the score of provisions. 

" We are entirely at a loss where the army is, which is 
no inconsiderable check to our enterprise. If the army is 
wholly out of supporting distance, we risk the total loss of 
the detachment in making an attack. If the army will 
countenance us, we may do something clever. We feel 
our personal honour, as well as the honour of the army and 
the good of the service, interested, and are heartily desirous 
to attempt whatever the disposition of our men will second, 
and prudence authorize. It is evident, the enemy wish to 
avoid, not to engage us. An officer is just come in, who 
informs he left the enemy's force near five miles off, still in 
march. To ascertain more fully their route, I have order- 
ed a fresh party on their left, and towards the head of their 
column. They have three brigades in rear of their bag- 
gage." 



HAMILTON. 197 

In the after part of the same day he again writes to Ge- 
neral Washington, who, at the head of the main body, was 
detained at Cranberry by a heavy storm. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
" SIR, 

"The result of what I have seen and heard respecting the 
enemy is, that they have encamped with their van a little 
beyond Monmouth Court-House, and their rear at Mana- 
lapans river, about seven miles from this place. Their 
march to-day has been very judiciously conducted ; their 
baggage in front, and their flying army in the rear, with a 
rear guard of one thousand men about four hundred paces 
from the main body. 

To attack them in this situation, without being supported 
by the whole army, would be folly in the extreme. If it 
should be thought advisable to give the necessary support, 
the army can move to some position near the enemy's left 
flank, which would put them in a very awkward situation, 
with so respectable a body in their rear, and would put it 
out of their power to turn either flank, should they be so 
disposed. Their left is strongly posted ; and I am told 
their right is also. By some accounts, one part of his army 
lies in the road leading from the Monmouth road to South 
Amboy. It is not improbable that South Amboy may still 
be the object. I had written thus far when your letter to 
the Marquis arrived. This puts the matter on a totally dif- 
ferent footing. The detachment will march to-morrow 
morning at three o'clock to Englishtown." 

This order was given in consequence of the delay of the 
main body, by which the advanced corps, being too far on 
the right, would be unsupported, in case of an attack, as 
had been indicated in Hamilton's letter of the morning. 
Early on the twenty-seventh, the detachment under the 



198 THE LIFE OF 

Marquis moved forward to Englishtown. The change in 
the position of the enemy rendering it proper to reinforce 
the advanced corps, and partly to relieve Lee's feelings, 
Washington detached him with two brigades to English- 
town to support La Fayette. In order to assure his pur- 
pose, he was instructed, that any operation in which the 
advance had engaged, should be persevered in ; and with 
this understanding, the command was confided to him. 
The main body then moved forward, and encamped within 
three miles of that place, Morgan hovering on the right 
flank of the enemy, and Dickinson, with the Jersey militia, 
on the left. 

On the evening of the twenty-seventh, Hamilton, who 
had rejoined the main body by order of Washington 
wrote to General Lee, directing him, from the apprehen- 
sion that the enemy might move off at night, or early in the 
morning, to detach a party of six or eight hundred men, to 
lie near them, and to skirmish, so as to produce some de- 
lay ; while Lee was directed to give orders to Colonel 
Morgan to make an attack for a similar purpose : a pre- 
vious order had been issued to Lee to call the officers to- 
gether, and plan the attack ; and an hour was appointed 
by him for their conference ; but before they met, he rode 
out, and on the inquiry for orders, were informed that he 
had none to give. 

In the interim, the enemy had taken a strong position 
with their right flank, on the skirt of a small w r ood, and 
their left secured by a forest, and a morass running towards 
their rear, a wood also covering their front. 

The main body of the Americans being put in motion 
to support him, Lee was ordered to commence the attack. 
Colonel Hamilton, who had rejoined the Marquis before 
break of day, as soon as he saw the probability of the van 
of the advanced corps being engaged with the enemy, re- 
turned to Washington, who was coming up with the 



HAMILTON. 199 

main body, and advised* him to throw the right wing of 
the army round by the right, and to follow with the left 
wing directly in General Lee's rear, to support him ; and 
an order was immediately given to Greene to file off with 
the right wing, and take a position so as to protect the right 
of the army, which was done. Hamilton then went for- 
ward to reconnoitre. Lee, after having advanced a short 
distance, ordered a halt ; he then again moved forward, 
and in half an hour after, Wayne was directed by Lee to 
leave his own detachment, and take command of the front. 
Scott's brigade then advanced up the morass on one side, 
Varnum's following its rear. Wayne, on reaching the front, 
sent intelligence to Lee that the enemy were moving in 
great disorder, and urged him to push on the rear. He con- 
tinued to advance, crossing the morass near the road where 
they were marching. Their whole force then in view halt- 
ed ; a body of British horse, covered by infantry, instantly 
charged the foremost regiment under Colonel Butler, who, 
pouring in a well-directed fire, broke them, and threw their 
covering party into disorder. The pursuit was kept up, 
when the enemy opened a fire from their artillery inclining 
to the right of the Americans, in order to gain an eminence, 
where their veterans formed with admirable coolness, as 
they came up in succession. Wayne hoping to gain the ad- 
vantage of the ground, formed Scott's brigade, under a 
heavy discharge of artillery, and still pressed on, when 
an order was received from Lee, who Hamilton states 
" meditated the disgrace of the Americans," TO RETREAT. 
The enemy seeing the situation of this detachment whol- 
ly unsupported, passed a column through the village, and 
gained a position between it and the remainder of the 
army, when they again made a spirited charge with their

200 THE LIFE OF 

horse, and the whole advance was compelled to retire ; 
which they did, under cover of a wood, until they reached 
the body under Lee. Hamilton having urged in vain that 
possession should be taken of a hill which commanded the 
plain on which the enemy were coming up, and that there 
the battle should be fought,* rejoined Washington, to re- 
port what he had done. He thus represented the situation 
of the advance ;f that when he came up with Lee, the 
enemy was drawn up with their right near a wood, their 
left in open ground covered by cavalry ; that the American 
columns were within cannon shot of the enemy ; that he 
rode up to the front of the column, and perceiving that their 
cavalry were filing off towards the left, as if to attempt 
Lee's right, he suggested to him that a column should 
wheel on their right, and attack them. This suggestion was 
approved ; and Hamilton, by Lee's order, directed LaFay- 
ette to wheel by his right, gain, and attack the enemy's 
flank. At this instant, while Washington was standing 
with his arm extended over his horse, during a halt for a 
few moments, where the roads forked, a small party came 
rapidly up, from whom he learned that the advanced corps 
was on the retreat. He instantly, giving way to a burst of 
indignation, sprung upon his horse, and having ordered Co- 
lonel Harrison, who had returned from reconnoitring, to as- 
certain the truth, pushed forward to the rear of the advan- 
ced corps, and rallied the retreating troops. 

To every inquiry as to the cause of the retreat, an un- 
satisfactory answer was given. Colonel Ogden, who fol- 
lowed, exclaimed with an oath, "we are flying from a 
shadow." The troops were then in the greatest disorder, 
ignorant what direction to pursue. 

Washington meanwhile reached the knoll, where Lee 
was, he immediately ordered Wayne to renew the

HAMILTON. 201 

combat, directed cannon to be brought up, which was done 
by Colonel Oswald, and a brisk cannonade ensued. Then 
calling up Colonels Ramsay, and Stewart, he vehemently 
exclaimed, that they were the officers on whom he should 
depend to give the enemy a check. While these regiments 
were forming, Lee approached. Washington demanded of 
him, in haste, the cause of the retreat. He replied - Sir, 
Sir, with hesitation, stating that it was owing to contradic- 
tory information and disobedience of orders, and that he 
did not choose to beard the British army in such a situation ; 
and that besides, the attack was contrary to his opinion. 
Washington replied, that whatever was his opinion, he ex- 
pected his orders would have been obeyed. 

At this moment, Hamilton rode up, and exclaimed to Lee, 
" I will stay with you, my dear General, and die with you. 
Let us all die here, rather than retreat." Perceiving the 
enemy advancing on the artillery, which, by the orders of 
General Knox had been posted on the right,* he advised 
that a detachment should march to their succour; when, after 
a short interval, Colonel Livingston pushed forward and re- 
pulsed them with spirit. 

Hamilton then rode towards the rear; when finding Co- 
lonel Olneyf retreating, with Varnum's brigade, and fear- 
ing that the artillery in their front would be lost, he order- 
ed the brigade to form along a fence near him, with all pos- 
sible despatch, which they immediately did, and charged at 
the point of the bayonet, where Hamilton, who had assist- 
ed in forming them, and had placed himself at their head, 
had his horse shot under him ; when, hurt by the fall,J and 
overcome by the heat, (for he had ridden throughout the 
action without his hat,) he was compelled to retire. 

This party, after exchanging a sharp fire, gave tune for

202 THE LIFE OF 

the artillery to fall back ; but too weak to prevent the ene- 
my from outflanking them, retreated with considerable loss. 

These two successive checks by Livingston and Olney, 
afforded time to make a disposition of the left wing, and to 
form the second line of the army upon an eminence, and in 
a copse in the rear covered by a morass. On this elevation, 
Stirling, who commanded that wing, placed cannon, which 
protected the charges of the infantry, and produced a great 
impression on the enemy, and stopped their progress. 

Greene, as soon as he heard of the retreat, pushed for- 
ward, and selected a position on the right, which Hamilton 
had advised Lee to take, crowned it with artillery, and 
kept off the British advancing on the right, while he 
severely enfiladed the left. Wayne then advanced, and 
pouring in a close fire, drove the enemy beyond the morass, 
near which Butler had at first repulsed them. Washington 
followed up the attack, by orders to General Poor, with 
two brigades, to move on the right, and Woodford on their 
left, while Knox brought his artillery to bear upon their 
front. These dispositions were made ; but obstacles pre- 
vented their reaching the enemy until night had closed in. 

The Americans, worn out by the intense heat, reposed on 
the field of battle, hoping to renew the action in the ensu- 
ing day ; but the enemy taking advantage of the darkness, 
pressed on, and succeeded in embarking at Sandy-Hook. 
Washington, unfortunately, believing that no serious injury 
could be inflicted upon them, leaving only a small force to 
hover around them, moved up for the protection of the 
Hudson. 

This narrative shows the conspicuous services of Hamil- 
ton in this engagement ; and such was Washington's sense 
of their importance, that he caused a high eulogium upon 
him to be inserted in his despatch to congress, which 
Hamilton, from motives of delicacy, induced him to ex- 
punge. A letter from camp, published at that time, thus 



HAMILTON. 203 

speaks of the conduct of Washington's staff: " I am happy 
to have it in my power to mention the merit of Colonel 
Hamilton. He was incessant in his endeavours during the 
whole day, in reconnoitering the enemy, and in rallying 
and charging; but whether he or Colonel Laurens deserves 
most of our commendation is somewhat doubtful both 
had their horses shot under them, and both exhibited singu- 
lar proofs of bravery. They seemed to court death, under 
our doubtful circumstances, and triumphed over it as the 
face of war changed in our favour. Fitzgerald had a slight 
contusion with a musket ball ; he and Meade claim the 
highest encomiums. Colonel Olney at the head of Var- 
num's brigade, made a successful charge with the bayonet ; 
Colonel Barber received a ball through the side. The 
artillery under Knox and Oswald were much distinguished." 

The result of this engagement, so honourable to its valour, 
aroused the greatest indignation in the army. The im- 
mediate friends of Lee sought to exculpate his conduct on 
the ground of discretionary orders, and an alleged contra- 
diction of intelligence ; and when brought before a court- 
martial, he did not hesitate to claim merit from the course 
which he had taken : but a large majority of the general 
officers, those especially who had been sent forward 
to bring on an engagement, the whole of Washington's 
staff, and the colonels of the several regiments, who received 
the first impression of the enemy, indulged the loudest 
complaints. Wayne, whose valour had been on this occasion, 
as on every other, eminently conspicuous, demanded Lee's 
arrest ; and an investigation became unavoidable. 

The court over which Stirling presided commenced its 
session on the fourth of July, and adjourned on the twelfth 
of August, after several interruptions, having found him 
"guilty of disobedience of orders in not attacking the 
enemy ; of misbehaviour, by making an unnecessary and 



204 THE LIFE OF 

disorderly retreat ; and of disrespect to the commander-in- 
chief:" and Lee was suspended from his command for 
twelve months, which he never resumed, a sentence 
which, with a divided vote, was confirmed by congress.* 

The defence made by Lee, was regarded as highly dis- 
ingenuous ; and as will be seen from the following letter, 
an answer was contemplated by Colonel Laurens, but 
abandoned, from the delicacy due to an officer, whose 
sentence was then before congress. 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

You have seen, and by this time considered, General 
Lee's infamous publication. I have collected some hints 
for an answer ; but I do not think, either that I can rely upon 
my own knowledge of facts and style to answer him fully, 
or that it would be prudent to undertake it without counsel. 
An affair of this kind ought to be passed over in total si- 
lence, or answered in a masterly manner. 

The ancient secretary is the Recueil of modern history 
and anecdotes, and will give them to us with candour, ele- 
gance, and perspicuity. The pen of Junius is in your hand ; 
and I think you will, without difficulty, expose in his de- 
fence, letters, and last production, such a tissue of falsehood 
and inconsistency, as will satisfy the world, and put him 
forever to silence. 

I think the affair will be definitively decided in congress 
this day. He has found means to league himself with the 
old faction, and to gain a great many partizans.

Adieu, my dear boy : I shall set out for camp to-mor- 
row. 

JOHN LAURENS. 

Although this purpose was abandoned, the family of 
Washington could not endure the continued imputations 
cast upon him by Lee. The biting sarcasms, and offensive 
manner which he had evinced on his trial, towards Lau- 
rens particularly, rankled in the bosom of that officer, whose 
indignation was increased by the relation of very offensive 
epithets, said to have been applied by him to his command- 
er. Soon after the investigation by congress had been 
closed, a challenge was delivered on his behalf to General 
Lee, by his friend Hamilton, which resulted in a duel, in 
which Lee was slightly wounded, who subsequently disa- 
vowed the use of the language which had been imputed to 
him. 

Believing that no serious injury could be inflicted on the 
enemy, the army remained in New-Jersey until intelligence 
being received of the arrival of a French fleet, under Count 
D'Estaing, it crossed the Hudson, and took a position in the 
vicinity of White Plains, favourable to either of the objects 
which might be concerted, a descent on New- York or 
upon Rhode-Island. On the return of Laurens to head 
quarters, with information of the approach of the fleet, in- 
structions having been received from congress, Hamilton, 
whom Washington stated " was well informed of the situa- 
tion of the army, and of his sentiments on every point," 
was despatched to have an interview with the French ad- 
miral, and to give him a representation of the situation of 
the combatants. 

It being supposed that the entrance of the fleet into the 
harbour of New-York would be attended with great diffi- 
culty, an attempt on Rhode-Island was determined upon ; 
and with this design, two brigades under La Fayette were 



206 THE LIFB OF 

pushed on from the main army, and Laurens sent forward 
to consult with General Sullivan, then in command at New- 
port. 

The result of this attempt, in itself most disastrous, threat- 
ened a danger still more serious. In the ardour of his feel- 
ings, Sullivan imputed a want of conduct to the French 
commander ; which, though obvious, was impolitic. The 
wounded pride of D'Estaing took the alarm, and he was, 
with difficulty, soothed by the interposition of Greene and 
Washington. 

Nothing of interest occurred during the residue of the 
year with the main army, which was cantoned throughout 
the winter in a line extending from Fishkill to Danbury. 

The situation of the prisoners still remained a subject of 
great and increasing anxiety. Representations from head 
quarters had induced congress to depart, in some measure, 
from the strict line of retaliation they had adopted ; and 
although in respect to Burgoyne they were inexorable, yet 
many other sources of embarrassment had ceased, and the 
concurrent anxiety of our new ally with the wishes of 
Washington, seemed to open a prospect of a more success- 
ful negotiation. A new proposition being offered by Sir 
Henry Clinton, Washington was authorized by congress to 
appoint commissioners for that purpose ; and Colonels Ha- 
milton and Harrison were selected to meet the British 
commissioners, Colonels Hyde and O'Hara, at Amboy. The 
conference soon terminated ; the unexpected and novel de- 
mands of the enemy being rejected. One incident alone 
remains worthy of mention in this eventful year. 

Congress had adopted a plan for relieving the distresses 
of the army, which were very urgent. The plan was in- 
tended to be kept a profound secret. A member of con- 
gress, one of the Cabal, divulged it to certain friends, who 
were charged with having speculated with him in flour. 
The views of congress were in some measure defeated, and 



HAMILTON. 207 

the sufferings of the army prolonged. " Hamilton," says 
Troup, " was informed of the facts, and made them the 
subject of a series of letters, which had the effect of seri- 
ously injuring the character of the member; and they 
struck me as the closest imitation of Junius which I had 
ever read." They appeared under the signature of Publius, 
an appellation which was afterwards adopted by him on the 
publication of the Federalist. 



CHAPTER X. 

[1779.} 

THROUGH the exertions of General Greene and Colonel 
Wadsworth, and the system introduced under their admi- 
nistration of the Quarter-master-general and Commissa- 
riat departments, the army, although cantoned in a country 
already nearly exhausted, passed the winter in a great de- 
gree exempt from the sufferings which had attended it at 
Valley Forge. 

The measures which had been adopted with respect to 
its organization in the preceding year, though productive 
of very beneficial consequences, from the nature of the 
force employed, required frequent modifications ; and with 
a view to this object a committee of congress was appoint- 
ed to repair to head quarters. Its conferences with the 
commander-in-chief commenced on the eighth of January, 
at which time a plan was submitted to them, drawn up by 
Colonel Hamilton, under the eye of Washington, which 
gives a brief but interesting view of the various considera- 
tions that influenced the determinations which were sub- 
sequently taken as to the policy of the present year. 

"The first and great object is to recruit the army." 
First by enlisting all the men now in it during the war, 
who are engaged for any term short of that : for this pur- 
pose no bounty should be spared. 

Secondly, by drafting upon some such plan as was re- 
commended to the committee at Valley Forge last Feb- 
ruary. 

The next object is, to fix some ideas respecting the 
northern preparations, concerning which the commander- 
in-chief now finds himself in a dilemma, and respecting the 

VOL. i. 27 



210 THE LIFE OF 

operations of the next campaign in general, in order that 
measures may be taken systematically. The following 
questions, on which the foregoing will depend, ought to be 
considered and decided. 

First. If the enemy retain their present force at New- 
York and Rhode-Island, can we assemble a sufficient force 
and means to expel them ? 

Second. If we cannot, can we make a successful at- 
tempt against Niagara, and retain a sufficient force at the 
same time on the sea-board to keep the enemy within 
bounds ? 

Third. Are our finances equal to eventual preparations 
for both of those objects ? 

If the first is determined in the affirmative, and the ene- 
my keep possession, we ought to direct almost our whole 
force and exertions to that point ; and for the security of 
our frontiers, endeavour to make some expedition against 
Detroit and the Indian settlements, by way of diversion. 
Our preparations ought then to be adapted to this plan, and 
if we cannot conveniently unite our preparations for this 
object with an expedition against Niagara, we ought to re- 
nounce the latter. 

If the first question is answered negatively, and the se- 
cond affirmatively, and if it is judged expedient to make 
such an attempt, our preparations ought to have reference 
principally thereto, and we must content ourselves with a 
merely defensive conduct elsewhere, and should study eco- 
nomy as much as possible. It is in vain to attempt things 
which are more the objects of desire than attainment. 
Every undertaking ought at least to be regulated by the 
state of our finances, the prospect of our supplies, and the 
probability of success. Without this, disappointment, dis- 
grace, and an increase of debt will ensue on our part ; ex- 
ultation and renewed hope on that of the enemy. To 
determine, therefore, what we can undertake, the state of 



HAMILTON. 211 

the army, the prospect of recruiting it, paying, clothing and 
feeding it, the providing the necessary apparatus for offen- 
sive operations ; all these matters ought to be well and 
maturely considered. On them every thing must depend ; 
and however reluctantly we yield, they will compel us to 
conform to them, as by attempting impossibilities we shall 
ruin our affairs. 

If the third question is answered affirmatively, which it 
is much to be feared cannot be done, then eventual prepa- 
rations ought to be made for both. We shall then be best 
able to act according to future circumstances ; for though 
it will be impossible to unite both objects in the execution, 
yet in the event of the enemy's leaving these states, we 
should be ready to strike an important blow for the effectual 
security of our frontiers, and for opening a door to a far- 
ther progress to Canada. 

From the investigation of these points another question 
may possibly result. 

Will not the situation of our affairs, on account of the 
depreciated condition of our currency, deficiency of bread, 
scarcity of forage, the exhausted state of our resources in 
the middle department, and the general distress of the in- 
habitants, render it advisable for the main body of the 
army to lie quiet in some favourable position for confining, 
as much as possible, the enemy to their present posts, 
(adopting, at the same time, the best means in our power 
to scourge the Indians, and prevent their depredations,) in 
order to save expenses, avoid new emissions, recruit our 
finances, and give a proper tone to our money for more vi- 
gorous measures hereafter ? 

In determining a plan of operations for next campaign, 
much will depend on the prospect of European affairs ; 
what we have to expect from our friends ; what they will 
expect from us : and what the enemy will probably be able 
to do. These points should be well weighed, and every 



212 THE LIFE OF 

information concentered to throw light upon them. But 
upon the whole, it will be the safest and most prudent way 
to suppose the worst, and prepare for it. 

"It is scarcely necessary to say, that the providing ample 
supplies of arms, clothes, and ordnance stores, is essential, 
and that an uncertain dependence may not only be hurtful, 
but ruinous. Their importance demands that every possi- 
ble expedient should be, without delay, adopted, towards 
obtaining these articles in due season for the purposes of 
next campaign. 

"Heavy cannon, for posts in the Highlands, for battering, 
and for vessels, if offensive measures are to be pursued, 
must be immediately forwarded, and in considerable quan- 
tity. Large mortars, with a sufficient apparatus, will also 
be wanted. 

" The completing the arrangement of the army, without 
farther delay, is a matter of great importance, whatever 
may be our plan. The want of this is the source of infinite 
dissatisfaction to the officers in general, and continual per- 
plexity to the commander-in-chief. The want of brigadiers 
is a material inconvenience, and hath been the cause of 
much relaxation of discipline, discontent, and loss, in sev- 
eral instances." 

These remarks are followed by observations, indicating 
changes in the ordnance department, as suggested by Ge- 
neral Knox ; in the clothing, and in the hospital depart- 
ments. The immediate establishment of an inspectorship, 
on a definite plan, is strongly urged; and an improved ar- 
rangement of the engineering department. The communi- 
cation closes with a reference to the situation of the offi- 
cers, which is stated " to be so singularly hard, that the bare 
mention of their case is sufficient to bring it home to the at- 
tention and feeling of every man of reflection, and will leave 
no doubt of the necessity of applying a remedy the most 
speedy and effectual." 



HAMILTON. 213 

The views taken in this paper, were the ground- work of 
the deliberations of the committee ; and the plan of a de- 
fensive campaign, which was ultimately adopted, was en- 
forced by various considerations. 

The enemy's force, at New- York and Rhode Island, was 
at this time about twelve thousand men. From the cir- 
cular position of their posts, the strength of their fortifica- 
tions, and their shipping, it was believed, that to a success- 
ful attempt, double that number of effectives would be ne- 
cessary. These, both from the rate of wages and the high 
price of labour, it was impossible to get, beside the extreme 
difficulty of providing subsistence and forage for so large 
a force. 

For an attack upon the frontier posts of the interior, a 
body of permanent troops with auxiliaries, to the amount 
of more than twenty thousand men, was deemed requisite ; 
for the transportation of whom, ships were to be built, boats 
provided, and greater expense incurred, than would be ne- 
cessary for an attack on New-York. 

From the objections to these plans an expedition against 
the Indians was free, and attended with much less expense, 
while the country would, in the interval, be left to repose, 
the disbursements of the year diminished a general sys- 
tem of economy might be adopted, and enlistments made 
to continue during the war. 

But as to this latter course, indicated more by the na- 
tional necessities than by any other considerations, there 
were grounds of serious hesitation. " The very inactivity, 
it was naturally feared, might be attributed to the weakness 
of the United States, and thus affect their credit and import- 
ance abroad, and produce a most serious effect on their 
negotiations in Europe. It might also discourage the peo- 
ple, inspirit the disaffected, and give time for the discon- 
tented to combine and produce extensive divisions, while 
a successful blow given to the enemy, in the reduced state 



214 THE LIFE OF 

of the army, might compel them to evacuate the United 
States, to which there would be little probability of their 
return." But to this the finances of the country were in- 
competent ; and it was believed no adequate force could 
be assembled. 

After a deliberate view of the subject, a defensive plan 
was agreed upon, only to be departed from in the contin- 
gency of such reinforcements from France, as would justi- 
fy drawing on the resources of the country, to an extent 
that would ensure the accomplishment of some capital 
object. 

For the better organization of the army, in addition to 
the subjects previously submitted to the committee, the 
adoption of measures to relieve the officers was a primary 
consideration ; and in a letter received from head quarters, 
after stating "that the news of peace had diverted the minds 
of the officers at Valley Forge," it was urged, in order " that 
the officers should take pleasure in their situation, not mere- 
ly endure it ; which would render them an insipid and spi- 
ritless mass, incapable of acting with vigour, and ready to 
fall to pieces at every reverse of fortune ;" that they should 
be provided with clothing by public authority, at prices pro- 
portioned to their pay: that the rations and subsistence 
which they had received rendered their situation indigent 
and miserable, and an expedient of a periodical valuation 
of their rations was proposed. " To attach them heartily 
to the service, their expectations of futurity must be inter- 
ested." With this view, a half-pay or pensionary establish- 
ment for life was recommended, and not for a term of years, 
on the ground, " that the officer looks beyond a limited pe- 
riod, and naturally flatters himself that he will outlive it." 
The unpleasant restrictions which attended the resolves for 
seven years were condemned ; pensions for the widows of 
the officers were recommended ; and to the objection rais- 
ed to pensions, that they were inconsistent with the maxims 



HAMILTON. 215 

of government, it was answered, " that it equally applied 
to pensions for years as to those for lives." " It is alike a 
pension, in both cases ; in one, for a fixed and determinate 
period ; in the other, for a contingent period." Strongly as 
these views were taken, it was nevertheless cautiously sug- 
gested, " that the subject should not be brought forward un- 
less certain of success ; that it was a point on which the of- 
ficers' feelings were much engaged, and should not be awa- 
kened unless gratified." 

Within a few days after, a plan for a clothing depart- 
ment was proposed, establishing a subordination of officers, 
and recommending a distinct colour and uniform for each 
state corps ; to diminish the expense of competition for the 
same colour ; to distinguish the corps from each other ; to 
discriminate merit ; and to prevent expense to the officers 
by frequent changes. 

It has been previously observed, that on the appointment 
of Steuben, a brief plan of an inspectorship had been in 
part adopted by congress in the spring of 1778. This plan 
was subsequently modified and completed in the ensuing 
month of September, when the number of the regiments 
was allotted to each state. 

The system then introduced, proved imperfect ; and hav- 
ing been agreed to in committee, on the twenty-eighth of 
January of this year, a new plan for this department was 
reported by the committee of conference to congress, and 
passed on the eighteenth of February following. The re- 
port exists among the archives of the government in a rough 
state ; the preamble in another hand, but the body of it, 
with marks of alteration by him, in the autography of Ha- 
milton ; where may also be found a plan drawn up by him 
for completing the regiments, and changing their establish- 
ment, in which is a project for an annual draft. Induce- 
ments for reinlistments, and the modes of supplying the 
deficiency, are set forth with great perspicuity, giving the

general principles for such a procedure, which, in similar 
emergencies, might be adopted with advantage. 

While these topics were engaging their attention, con- 
gress was called, by a communication from Mr. Arthur Lee, 
and by a conference with the French minister, to a nego- 
tiation with Spain, involving points of great moment, the 
consideration of which is deferred to a subsequent part of 
this narrative. 

The inactivity of the preceding campaign, had induced a 
general languor in the national legislature, which gave scope 
to those dissensions from which public bodies, not acting 
under the pressure of controlling circumstances, are rarely 
free, and from which the short predatory invasion of Vir- 
ginia, by General Matthews, and the remote, though inter- 
esting events in Georgia and Carolina, were insufficient to 
arouse them. 

In early spring, the enemy, waiting reinforcements, were 
content to harass and alarm the states adjacent to New- 
York by sudden inroads, which did not advance in the least 
the great object of the contest, but only served to increase 
the horrors of war, by invading the unsuspicious security of 
the settlements near the coast. These incursions were ag- 
gravated by being chiefly undertaken by the American refu- 
gees ; who, forgetting their duty to their country, discarded 
all regard to the obligations of humanity, and evincing the 
cruelty, without the courage of other freebooters, rendered 
doubly afflicting this border warfare. 

Among other acts of this character, the expedition of 
Tryon into Connecticut, and an attack upon Tarrytown, 
were most conspicuous ; and being conducted, in these in- 
stances, by officers of the regular army, excited the loudest 
clamour. 

The debateable ground of Westchester, had long been a 
scene of the most wanton enormities. There parties were 
regularly organized, under the singular denominations of 






HAMILTON. 217 

skinners and cow-boys ; and as a natural consequence of 
this petty warfare, long continued, a great part of the com- 
munity were demoralized, and each combination formed 
itself into regular bands of depredators. 

But the principal seat of these outrages was in the lower 
districts of New-Jersey , which being easily accessible through 
its numerous inlets from the ocean, and having a sparse po- 
pulation, was kept in constant alarm. Small vessels were 
seen continually hovering along the coast, which made in 
upon them at midnight, carried off all the plunder they could 
find, fired the houses, murdered all who resisted, and perpe- 
trated shocking barbarities. Bands of robbers roamed over 
the less frequented regions, and along the barrens, who, 
excited to cruelty by their conflicts with the militia, mark- 
ed their path with rapine and with blood. 

The vigilance exerted by Governor Livingston, and the 
necessary severity exercised upon these outlaws, rendered 
him an object of their particular hostility, and plans were 
frequently formed to seize his person. On one occasion, 
intelligence of his being at a certain spot was given, a party 
was embodied to carry him off, and two men, bolder than 
the others, were sent forward to watch his movements. Ac- 
cident saved him. In the habit of riding at sunrise, he had, 
on the appointed day, awakened sooner than usual, and had 
just passed the place selected for his capture or destruction, 
when the party made their appearance a few moments too 
late. At another time a project was devised for carrying 
off the speaker* of the New-Jersey legislature, which was 
nearly successful. 

A similar design was formed on the person of Washing- 
ton. He had appointed to meet some officers at a desig- 
nated place. Information was given by a female in the 
tory interest, and the necessary arrangements were made 

* Mr. Hornblower.

218 THE LIFK OF 

to seize him ; but timely intelligence* frustrated the at- 
tempt. 

A more serious impression was made by a letter of Go- 
vernor Livingston, written about this time to Sir Henry 
Clinton, alleging that he had the most authentic proofs of a 
general officer under his command having offered a large sum 
for his assassination in case he could not be taken alive, 
and intimating that the person of General Clinton might be 
reached in retaliation, but exempting him from all know- 
ledge of this atrocious proposal. It is due to justice to state, 
that this charge was met on the part of the English com- 
mander with an explicit and indignant denial. 

The repetition of these attempts suggested the idea of 
making Sir Henry Clinton a prisoner ; and a plan for this 
purpose was devised and submitted to General Washing- 
ton. The British general was then occupying a house near 
the Battery, in New- York, situate a few yards from the 
Hudson river. Intelligence, through spies, had been ob- 
tained of the approaches to his bed-chamber. Light whale- 
boats, with muffled oars, were to be placed under the com- 
mand of Colonel Humphreys, of Connecticut ; and the par- 
ty, in full preparation, were waiting anxiously the approach 
of night for the execution of their purpose. 

Colonel Hamilton, in the interval, became informed of the 
intended enterprise. He observed to General Washington 
" that there could be little doubt of its success : but, sir," 
said he, " have you examined the consequences of it ?" The 
General inquired, " in what respect ?" " Why," replied Ha- 
milton, " it has occurred to me that we shall rather lose 

* A partizan officer, a native of New- York, called at the shop of Mulligan 
late in the evening, to obtain a watch-coat The late hour awakened curio- 
sity. After some inquiries, the officer vauntingly boasted, that, before another 
day, they would have his rebel General in their hands. This staunch patriot, 
as soon as the officer left him, hastened unobserved to the wharf, and des- 
patched a billet by a negro, giving information of the design. 



HAMILTON. 219 

than gain, by removing Sir Henry Clinton from the com- 
mand of the British army, because we perfectly understand 
his character ; and, by taking him off, we only make way 
for some other, perhaps an abler officer, whose character 
and dispositions we have to learn." The General acknow- 
ledged the force of the objection, and abandoned the project. 

The several occurrences which have been referred to, 
together with the more serious devastations committed at 
various points along the sea-board, as well as those in the 
interior, produced a stronger excitement in congress than 
in the army. For, it is among the remarkable incidents of 
this Revolution, that the military influence was constantly 
exerted to check the civil authorities in their disposition to 
retaliate ; and that in their disinclination to carry into effect 
the severe orders of congress, the army in numerous in- 
stances incurred almost the reproach of insubordination. 

Cold speculations on the past have reproved this want of 
vigour ; but who would willingly add another instance of 
retaliation to those to which his countrymen were reluct- 
antly compelled ? 

Of the force of this feeling with some members of con- 
gress, the following report, called the " Burning Report," 
from the hand of Mr. Gouverneur Morris 1 , is a strong illus- 
tration. 

" Your committee, to whom was referred General Wash- 
ington's letter of the thirteenth of July, 1779, with the en- 
closures, beg leave to report the following draft of a letter 
from the President to the minister plenipotentiary of the 
United States at the court of Versailles : 

" SIR, 

The burning of Suffolk in Virginia, Fairfield, East Haven, 
Green Farms, Norwalk in Connecticut, together with the 
ravages committed in Georgia and South Carolina, form a 
cruel commentary upon the proclamation of the British com- 



220 THE LIfE OF 

missioners. This proclamation was defended in their par- 
liament, as meaning no more than that in future the war 
was to be carried on against America as against other na- 
tions. It becomes, therefore, a common cause of all nations 
to punish a people who so daringly violate the rights of hu- 
manity : and it is particularly incumbent upon the United 
States, as well to check their present barbarities as to con- 
form to the manifesto published in answer to the procla- 
mation above mentioned, and to deter all others, by striking 
examples, from a breach of those laws which are held sacred 
among civilized nations. I am, therefore, to instruct you, 
that you employ incendiaries to set fire to the capital of the 
British dominions, particularly the royal palace, and to such 
other towns in Great Britain as may be most expedient ; 
and that as soon as some great object of this sort can be ac- 
complished, you do in a proper manifesto avow the same as 
having been by the order of congress declare that they 
are determined at all times to meet their enemies, in what- 
ever kind of war they shall choose to carry on, whether it 
be of civilized or of savage nations, and call upon all the 
powers of Europe, who may have formerly suffered by the 
pride and cruelty of Great Britain, or who feel a just indig- 
nation at her present conduct, to join their efforts in vindica- 
ting the insulted laws of humanity. I am," &c. 

It was read on the second of August, 1779 ; but it is hard- 
ly necessary to add, was never acted upon. 

Towards the last of the month of May, indications were 
given of designs of a more formidable character: and as 
the only probable objects of the enemy were either the 
fortifications in the Highlands, or an attempt to take a 
position between the different bodies of the American 
army, and to attack them in detail, Washington moved his 
principal force then at Middlebrook to Smith's Clove, on 
the west side of the Hudson, whence immediate reinforce- 



HAMILTON. 221 

ments could be sent in case of an attack upon West 
Point. 

Events soon proved the wisdom of this precaution. Sir 
Henry Clinton, on the return of a detachment from the 
South, moved up the Hudson, and made a sudden descent 
on Stony Point, which was abandoned. On the following 
day he reduced Fort La Fayette, and leaving a sufficient 
force to strengthen the works, deterred by the proximity 
of General Washington, relinquished his designs upon 
West Point, the great object of his movement, and re- 
turned to New- York. 

These positions being the keys of the Highlands, and 
commanding the only ferry in that vicinity, were esteemed 
of too great importance to be permitted to remain in the 
hands of the enemy, and it was determined to retake 
them. 

The possession of Stony Point, a rugged acclivity, 
which stretches so far into the channel of the Hudson, as 
to give to its upper waters the appearance of a lake 
embosomed in a vast and magnificent amphitheatre of 
mountains, commands the opposite fortress. Its reduction 
was confided to General Wayne, at the head of the light 
infantry. After taking every precaution to conceal his 
purpose, and issuing imperative orders to his men to hold 
their fire, he succeeded in surprising the garrison at mid- 
night, and with a trifling loss, notwithstanding numerous 
obstructions, and amid a heavy fire of musketry and grape, 
entered the works at the point of the bayonet, without 
having discharged a shot. 

Colonel Fleury, a young and titled soldier of France, 
whose ardent courage and admirable temper endeared him 
to the army, was the first to enter the fort and strike the 
British standard ; and with two others of the advanced 
party alone survived. Wayne, whose impetuous spirit had 
given him the epithet among his soldiers of " mad Anthony," 



222 THE LIFE OF 

received a wound in his head, and supposing it would 
terminate fatally, entreated his aids to convey him to the 
fort, there to die ; but the wound proved slight, and this 
gallant officer, who had been foremost in every preceding 
action, lived to add laurel upon laurel to his fame, until 
not an officer in the army could boast a prouder name.* 

The British general, either finding little glory to be won 
in New-England, or intent on the possession of these 
fortresses, with a view to some ulterior object, hastened to 
their recovery. Washington, unwilling to diminish his 
army by detaching a force adequate to their support, 
reluctantly determined to evacuate them ; and adhering to 
his defensive system, established his head-quarters at West 
Point. 

A letter from Mr. Duane, a delegate in congress from 
New- York, with whom Colonel Hamilton had formed an 
intimacy, thus refers to these incidents : 

" DEAR SIR, 

Accept my thanks for your favour of the t\venty-eighth 
of August, and your obliging assurances that you will com- 
ply with my request. Unless my anxiety in the events of 
the campaign had been very great, I should not have been 
so unreasonable as to impose this burthen on any of my 
much respected friends at head quarters, well knowing 
that they, of all others, have the least leisure. I find the 
British reinforcement is arrived. To me it brings no ter- 
ror, as I think we have the strongest evidence that it was 
not originally intended to exceed four thousand men, and 

* The report of this brilliant affair to congress, prepared by Hamilton, gives 
a vivid account of this attack. That body had previously expressed their sense 
of the importance of the attempt ; (June 1 1th, 1779,) they adopted resolutions, 
ordering medals to be struck in honour of Wayne, Colonel Fleury, and Major 
Stewart, and directed the value of the stores captured to be divided among 
the troops. 



HAMILTON. 223 

these raw recruits. You say Wayne is still safe. Let 
him keep a sharp look out ; for I still hold the opinion that 
Sir Henry Clinton is bound in honour to chastise him for 
one of the most daring and insolent assaults that is to be 
found in the records of chivalry : an achievement so bril- 
liant in itself, so romantic in the scale of British admira- 
tion, that none but a hero, inspired by the fortitude, in- 
structed by the wisdom, and guided by the planet of Wash- 
ington, could, by the exploit at Paulus Hook,* have furnish- 
ed materials in the page of history to give it a parallel. * * 
* * * You see, from this, how much I am at my ease. 
To know the value of domestic enjoyment, next to head 
quarters, I recommend the chair at the board of treasury 
for ten months of a session, in which both our friends and 
foes are waging a successful war against the public credit. 
Present my affectionate regard to his excellency and the 
family, and believe me, with every friendly sentiment, your 
affectionate and devoted servant, 

JAMES DUANE." 

In another letter of the sixteenth of September the same 
gentleman observes, " I perfectly agree in opinion with you 
what the enemy ought, in good policy, to attempt ; but they 
uniformly contravene their best interest, and pursue mea- 
sures which can produce the least possible advantage. I 
think I intimated to you, that I should not be surprised, if 
Count D'Estaing paid a visit to us early this fall. Reports 
prevail which announce his approach. In that case, they 
will be as safe in New-York as at Savannah or Charles- 
ton, and it is no slander to say lhat the safety of their army 
has all along been their first object. What will the world 
think of our spirit and resources, when, at the very instant 
our enemies, foreign and domestic, pronounce our imme-

224 THE LIFE OP 

diate ruin, from the embarrassment of our finances and a 
train of heavy calamities, they see their grand army cooped 
up in garrison, their forts taken from them by unparalleled 
valour, the country of their savage allies ravaged and de- 
stroyed without a single effort for their protection, and a 
capital naval armament, equipped by a single state, which 
it required misconduct perhaps on our part, and certainly 
the most hazardous efforts on theirs, to defeat ? The con- 
dition of our enemies, instead of being formidable, as they 
predicted, seems daily to become more feeble, and instead 
of the vigorous and decisive operations which can alone 
have revived their declining cause and kept up the spi- 
rits of their infatuated adherents, we see nothing but lan- 
guor, discontent, and disgust, in their army, their fleets, and 
their councils. Their king alone, as if hardened by a judi- 
cial blindness, persists in his obstinate folly, and courts the 
destruction of the British empire. If, in addition to this, 
sickness has taken a deep root among his troops, a decisive 
period must, in all probability, speedily be put to their mad 
career. 

" Count D'Estaing appears to have the ball at his feet. 
His command of the ocean must be undisputed, when he is 
joined by the Spanish squadron lately at Havannah. He 
may divide his force, subdue the West India Islands, and 
assist us in capturing the remnant of our enemies on this 
continent. I have, however, some distrust of the Count's 
planet. His former ill luck on our coast has led me to 
think that he is no Felix. How do you like the new minis- 
ter from France ?" 

The gentleman here referred to was Monsieur de la Lu- 
zerne, who is thus briefly noticed in a letter from Baron 
Steuben to Colonel Hamilton. 

" M. de la Luzerne desires me to join him on his route, 
to accompany him to head quarters. I shall depart on Tues- 
day morning for Providence, where I shall require three 



HAMILTON. 225 

days to review the regiments ; after which I shall return 
immediately to Hartford to join the minister. 

" I promised to give you a picture of his new excellency. 
He is about thirty-six years of age, though he appears 
younger. In the last war he was aid-de-camp to Marshal 
Broglio. He appears to me to be a man of solid sense, and 
less presumptuous than the people of quality of that country 
usually are. His manners are prepossessing; and they 
would be more so if he could speak English. His charac- 
ter appears to me good ; and he is less reserved than Euro- 
pean ministers usually are. His personal appearance will 
not displease the ladies of Philadelphia. He is a young 
chevalier of Malta, who is not so much imbrowned by his 
crusades, but that the American beauties will take pains to 
teach him English in a short time. His secretary, M. de 
Marbois, is a counsellor of Parliament, from Metz in Lor- 
raine speaks good English ; and is a man who shows much 
information and judgement." Hamilton briefly replied : 

" DEAR BARON I am at this moment honoured with 
your letter of the 30th ultimo, and have communicated that 
part of it which concerns M. de la Luzerne to the General ; 
agreeably to which we shall take our measures on the re- 
ception of this private public gentleman. We had prepared 
a party of cavalry to receive him at Fishkill, on the suppo- 
sition that he would set out with an escort from Boston ; 
but we have now sent orders to the party immediately to 
take the route you mention to Hartford, and there place 
themselves under your orders. 

" The General requests you will make his respectful com- 
pliments to your chevalier, and gives you carte blanche to 
say every handsome thing you think proper in his name, of 
the pleasure which this visit will give him. I have no doubt 
that your portrait, which appears to be executed en maitre, 
will be found a just representation of the original ; and if he 

VOL. i. 29 



226 THE LIFE OF 

is as happy as his predecessor in gaining the esteem and con- 
fidence of the men of this country, with so many talents to 
conciliate the leaders, his ministry will not be unsuccessful. 
I augur well for him. General Washington proposes to 
meet him, as a private gentleman, at Fishkill." 

The interview, at which Hamilton was present, was of 
the highest importance. A full and candid statement was 
given to the French minister of the resources and embar- 
rassments of the nation ; and he was duly impressed with 
the importance of obtaining such aids as the finances of the 
country required. 

The rumoured approach of Count D'Estaing being soon 
after confirmed by despatches from congress, Washington, 
who had stationed Major Lee in Monmouth county, with 
instructions to communicate to him the situation and force 
of the enemy, and to propose some preliminary movements, 
addressed a letter to the Count on the fourth of October, 
informing him that he had called in reinforcements from 
the neighbouring states, and that he was taking measures 
to prepare for a co-operation, with all the despatch and 
vigour his circumstances would permit, pointing out to 
him in detail the situation of New-York and Rhode-Island ; 
suggesting the necessary measures to render an attempt in 
either port successful ; and disclosing, in an explicit man- 
ner, all the difficulties attendant upon the enterprise. 

On the seventh of October, he farther writes : " Since my 
letter to your excellency on the fourth instant, I have had 
the honour of a visit from his excellency Monsieur Gerard. 
In the conversation we had relative to a co-operation with 
the fleet and troops under your command, he expressed his 
doubts of its being possible for you to continue such a length 
of time as may be essential to the success of the undertaking, 
and which alone could justify me in going into those exten- 
sive preparations absolutely necessary on our part. I have, 
therefore, appointed Brigadier General Du Portail and Co- 



HAMILTON 227 

lonel Hamilton to wait upon your excellency as speedily as 
possible, and explain to you fully my ideas of the proposed 
co-operation ; the means we shall be able to employ ; the 
obstacles we shall have to encounter on our side ; the plans 
which it may be proper to pursue, and the measures which 
are taking, and may be taken by the enemy to counteract 
them. This will enable your excellency to determine what 
you can with propriety undertake. I shall only add, that 
if your excellency will engage to co-operate with your whole 
naval and land force against the enemy's fleet and army at 
New-York, till the winter is so far advanced, that the ice 
will make it impracticable to remain with your fleet any 
longer in port, I will bring twenty-five thousand effective 
men into the field, and will exert all the resources of the 
country in a vigorous and decided co-operation. 

" Without this assurance on the part of your excellency, it 
would be inconsistent with my duty to the public, and to 
the common cause, to incur the expense and hazard which 
would be inseparable from the enterprise, and the more 
disagreeable consequences which would attend a failure. 
I flatter myself your excellency will be fully sensible of the 
weight of the reasons on which this declaration is founded, 
and will approve the frankness with which it is made, and 
with which I have instructed General Du Portail and Co- 
lonel Hamilton to disclose to you every circumstance, and 
every consideration, with which it is necessary you should 
be acquainted. If your determination should be in favour 
of the enterprise, I request you will honour me with a line 
expressive of your ultimate intentions, and that you will 
communicate to the gentlemen who now wait upon you, the 
previous measures you propose to pursue, and your senti- 
ments of the most eligible plan of co-operation. I shall act 
in consequence, till the period arrives for concerting a final 
and more determinate plan. 

" I would now observe to your excellency, that you may 



228 THE LIFE OF 

repose the most implicit confidence in General Du Portail 
and Colonel Hamilton, and I accordingly recommend them 
to your best civilities and esteem ; and having done so, I 
have only to renew the assurances of that sincere attach- 
ment and perfect respect, with which I have the honour 
to be, 

" Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

" GEORGE WASHIXGTON." 
His Excellency Count HEstaing. 

The utmost interest was, at this moment, awakened 
throughout the country. An interesting crisis was expect- 
ed ; and a long correspondence between Washington and 
Hamilton ensued, as the various intelligence was received, 
which would probably affect the intended enterprise. These 
letters fully disclose the anxiety of the Commander-in-chief, 
to fulfil, by a decisive blow, the high wrought expectations 
of the people. The enemy were, at this time, filled with 
dismay. The fortifications at New-York were carried on 
with the utmost activity ; the garrisons were withdrawn 
from the posts on the Hudson ; and the troops stationed at 
Newport, whom Washington had urged should be surprised, 
were finally transferred to New- York. 

But notwithstanding the most anxious solicitations to bring 
the French admiral to a decision, it was ascertained that no 
determinate resolution would be taken by him ; and after 
all the ardent hopes which had been encouraged, and the 
mighty achievements which were to be performed, the 
French fleet, early in the month of November, abandoned 
the American coast, and proceeded to France ; thus ful- 
filling the prophecy of Mr. Duane, " that the Count's planet 
could not be trusted." 

All prospect of active operations by the main army hav- 
ing ceased, Colonel Hamilton, weary of inactivity, and con- 
vinced that the policy of the enemy would henceforth direct 



HAMILTON. 229 

their efforts to the subjugation of the weaker states, influ- 
enced also by a desire to join his friend Laurens, and to 
obtain a separate command, applied to Washington for per- 
mission to proceed to the south ; but the proposal did not 
meet the views of the commander-in-chief, and his purpose 
was relinquished. 

The private letters which are to be found among Hamilton's 
papers, written at this uninteresting period of the revolution, 
have little other value than to exhibit the warm affections 
which prevailed in the army towards him, especially among 
the foreign officers, with whom his familiarity with their 
language, and easy manners, placed him on the happiest 
terms. Their situation, in a country as yet little advanced 
in the arts of social life, was, to men of artificial habits, 
educated amid all the luxuries of a court, often painful ; 
and they gladly availed themselves of his influence with the 
commander-in-chief, relating to him their thousand wants, 
and making him the confidant of their little secrets. Often 
as he was embarrassed by the extravagance of their expec- 
tations, he seems always to have indulged the kindest feel- 
ings towards them, and he frequently looked back to the 1 
services which he had rendered to those gallant men, with 
great satisfaction. 

The introduction of these letters would too much inter- 
rupt the progress of this narrative ; but the following will 
be perused with interest, as giving a brief but expressive 
picture of the condition of the soldiers. It is from Fleury, 
dated Light Infantry Camp, Highlands. 

" DEAR COL. 

" The officers of the two first battalions of light infantry, 
which I actually command, have applied to me for leave to 
run over these craggy mountains barefooted, and beg that I 
would write to head quarters to have an order from his ex- 
cellency to get a pare shoes for each. The shoes they 



230 THE LIFE OF 

hint to are at New-Windsor, and their intention is to pay 
for. 

" Do not be so greedy for shoes as for my blanket, and 
think that the most urgent necessity has determined their 
application. They are quite barefooted. 

" N. B. As his excellency could form a very advantageous 
idea of our condition in shoes, the appearance of the offi- 
cers who dined to.-day at head quarters and were not quite 
without, I beg you would observe to him, if necessary, that 
each company has furnished a shoe for their dressing" 

This intimate intercourse with these gentlemen, was often 
turned to a useful purpose. It enabled him to keep up a 
correspondence with France, and gave him the channel for 
many communications which reached her court, free from 
all official formality. With Du Plessis, who was in favour, 
he corresponded in cypher, and it is stated by Colonel 
Fish, as one of the incidents of this intimacy, that Hamilton 
was the first person to suggest the introduction of a French 
army into the United States.* 

* In a memoir of Colonel Fish, of date March twenty-first, 1822, it is sta- 
ted, "In one of our confidential conversations, Hamilton, speaking of the 
Marquis La Fayette, said, 'The United States are under infinite obligations 
to him beyond what is known, not only for his valour and good conduct as 
major-general of our army, but for his good offices and influence in our behalf 
with the court of France. The French army now here, co-operating with us, 
would not have been in this country but through his means.' He then said, 
that for some considerable time previous to the arrival of the French army 
under Count Rochambeau, he (Colonel Hamilton,) had conceived the idea 
and had weighed in his own mind the propriety of such a measure, and hav- 
ing satisfied himself on the subject, he had suggested the idea to the Marquis La 
Fayette, expressing to him at the same time, not only the powerful effect that 
would be produced in our army and country generally by the introduction of a 
small military force from France to co-operate with us, but the increased effect 
that would result should the Marquis himself be appointed to the command. 
This project met a welcome reception, and after some explanatory remarks as 
to the details of the plan, the Marquis, with all the zeal and promptitude which 



HAMILTON. 231 

The sprightly tone which these accomplished men im- 
parted to the camp, only caused the absence of Laurens, 
who added grace to every circle in which he moved, and 
interest to every subject on which he spoke, and who, led 
by attachment to his native state, had repaired to her amid 
her difficulties, to be the more regretted. 

On his departure from head quarters, Hamilton, who had 
seen similar corps in the West Indies, which suggested the 
idea of raising a body of black levies for the protection of 
South Carolina, gave him the following letter of introduc- 
tion to Mr. Jay. 

HAMILTON TO THE PRESIDENT OF CONGRESS. 
DEAR SIR, 

Colonel Laurens, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a pro- 
ject which I think in the present situation of affairs there, is 
a very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is, to raise two, three, or four bat- 
talions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that state, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail of 
his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by congress 
to the state, and as an inducement, that they would engage 
to take their battalions into continental pay. 

It appears to me, that an expedient of this kind in the 



characterised him, addressed the French government and their ambassador 
here on the subject, urging the advantages which would result to both nations 
from having a French military force in this country. This proposition was 
immediately patronized and enforced by the family and connexions of the Mar- 
quis, which were then in power and great influence in France, and adopted by 
that government. I deem it a duty incumbent on me, and a tribute due to his 
memory, that the knowledge of this fact should be recorded as an additional 
evidence of bis pre-eminent services to his country." 



232 THE LIFE OF 

present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations 
there are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have 
not the least doubt that the negroes will make very excel- 
lent soldiers, with proper management ; and I w r ill venture 
to pronounce that they cannot be put in better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, and 
enterprise, and every other qualification requisite to suc- 
ceed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and on this principle it is thought 
that the Russians would make the best soldiers in the world 
if they were under other officers than their own. The 
King of Prussia is among the number who maintains this 
doctrine, and has a very emphatic saying on the occasion, 
which I do not exactly recollect. I mention this because I 
have frequently heard it objected to the scheme of embodying 
negroes, that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This is 
so far from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think 
their want of cultivation, (for then- natural faculties are pro- 
bably as good as ours,) joined to that habit of subordination 
which they acquire from a life of servitude, will enable 
them sooner to become soldiers than our white inhabitants. 
Let officers be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer 
the soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the better. 

I foresee that this project will have to combat much oppo- 
sition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we 
have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us fan- 
cy many things that are founded neither in reason nor ex- 
perience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of so 
valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to show 
the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme 
which requires such sacrifices. But it should be consider- 



HAMILTON. 233 

ed, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the ene- 
my probably will, and that the best way to counteract the 
temptations they will holdout, will be, to offer them ourselves. 
An essential part of the plan is, to give them their free- 
dom with their swords. This will secure their fidelity, animate 
their courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence upon 
those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. 
This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in indu- 
cing me to wish the success of the project ; for the dictates 
of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favour 
of this unfortunate class of men. 

When I am on the subject of southern affairs, you will 
excuse the liberty I take in saying, that I do not think mea- 
sures sufficiently vigorous are pursuing for our defence in 
that quarter. Except the few regular troops of South 
Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the militia 
of that and the two neighbouring states. These will 
soon grow impatient of service, and leave our affairs in a 
miserable situation. No considerable force can be uni- 
formly kept up by militia ; to say nothing of the many ob- 
vious and well-known inconveniences that attend this kind 
of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, sir, that no time 
ought to be lost in making a draft of militia to serve a 
twelve-month, from the states of North and South Caro- 
lina and Virginia. But South Carolina, being very weak 
in her population of whites, may be excused from the draft, 
on condition of furnishing the black battalions. The two 
others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men, 
and be exempted, on that account, from sending any suc- 
cours to this army. The states to the northward of Virginia 
will be fully able to give competent supplies to the army 
here, and it will require all the force and exertions of the 
three states I have mentioned, to withstand the storm 
which has arisen, and is increasing in the south. 

The troops drafted must be thrown into battalions, and 

VOL. i. 30

officered in the best manner we can. The supernumerary- 
officers may be made use of as far as they will go. If 
arms are wanted for their troops, and no better way of 
supplying them is to be found, we should endeavour to levy 
a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraor- 
dinary exigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear 
this southern business will become a very grave one. 
With the truest respect and esteem, I am, sir, 
Your most obedient servant, 

ALEX. HAMILTON. 

Head Quarters, March 14, 1779. 

His Excellency John Jay, President of Congress. 

The following extract of a letter from Laurens to Hamil- 
ton, refers to this subject. 

LAURENS TO HAMILTON. 

Charleston. 

Ternant will relate to you how many violent struggles I 
have had between duty and inclination how much my 
heart was with you, while I appeared to be most actively 
employed here. But it appears to me that I should be in- 
excusable in the light of a citizen, if I did not continue my 
utmost efforts for carrying the plan of the black levies into 
execution, while there remain the smallest hopes of success. 

Our army is reduced to nothing almost, by the departure 
of the Virginians. Scott's arrival will scarcely restore us 
to our ancient number. If the enemy destine the reinforce- 
ments from Great Britain to this quarter, as in policy they 
ought to do, that number will be insufficient for the security 
of our country. The Governor, among other matters to be 
laid before the House of Assembly, intends to propose the 
completing our continental battalions by drafts from the mi- 
litia. This measure, I am told, is so unpopular that there 
is no hope of succeeding in it. Either this must be adopted, 



HAMILTON. 235 

or the black levies, or the state will fall a victim to the im- 
providence of its inhabitants. 

The House of Representatives have had a longer recess 
than usual, occasioned by the number of members in the 
field. It will be convened, however, in a few days. I in- 
tend to qualify, and make a final effort. Oh, that I were a 
Demosthenes ! The Athenians never deserved a more bit- 
ter exprobation than our countrymen. 

General Clinton's movement, and your march in conse- 
quence, made me wish to be with you. If any thing im- 
portant should be done in your quarter, while I am doing 
daily penance here, and making successless harangues, I 
shall execrate my stars, and be out of humour with the 
world. I entreat you, my dear friend, write me as fre- 
quently as circumstances will permit, and enlighten me 
upon what is going forward. 

Adieu. My love to our colleagues. I am afraid I was 
so thoughtless as to omit my remembrances to Gibbes. 
Tell him that I am always his sincere well-wisher, and hope 
to laugh with him again ere long. Adieu, again. 

Yours ever, 

JOHN LAURENS. 

P. S. You know my opinion of Ternant's value. His 
health and affairs call him to the North. If you can render 
him any services, they will be worthily bestowed. We have 
not hitherto availed ourselves of his zeal and talent. 

The following letter from Hamilton to Laurens is the 
only one which has met our inquiries. From the interest 
which this cotemporary correspondence gives to the story 
of the Revolution, it is to be regretted that so few re- 
mains exist of the extensive communications which he kept 
up with the officers of the army ; the want of which pre- 
vents that individuality being given to the early history of 



236 THE LIFE OF 

our country, from which, now that the general outlines are 
known, increased interest can only be derived. 

HAMILTON TO LAURENS. 

" Cold in my professions warm in my friendships I 
wish, my dear Laurens, it were in my power, by actions, 
rather than words, to convince you that I love you. I shall 
only tell you, that till you bid us adieu, I hardly knew the 
value you had taught my heart to set upon you. Indeed, 
my friend, it was not well done. You know the opinion I 
entertain of mankind ; and how much it is my desire to pre- 
serve myself free from particular attachments, and to keep 
my happiness independent of the caprices of others. You 
should not have taken advantage of my sensibility, to steal 
into my affections without my consent. But as you have 
done it, and as we are generally indulgent to those we love, 
I shall not scruple to pardon the fraud you have committed, 
on one condition ; that for my sake, if not for your own, 
you will continue to merit the partiality which you have so 
artfully instilled into me. 

" I have received your two letters ; one from Philadel- 
phia, the other from Chester. I am pleased with your 
success so far ; and I hope the favourable omens that pre- 
cede your application to the Assembly, may have as fa- 
vourable an issue ; provided the situation of affairs should 
require it, which I fear will be the case. But, both for 
your country's sake, and for my own, I wish the enemy 
may be gone from Georgia before you arrive ; and that 
you may be obliged to return, and share the fortunes of 
your old friends. In respect to the commission which you 
received from Congress, all the world must think your con- 
duct perfectly right. Indeed, your ideas upon this occasion 
seem not to have their wonted accuracy; and you have had 
scruples, in a great measure, without foundation. By your 



HAMILTON. 237 

appointment as aid-de-camp to the commander-m-chief, 
you had as much the rank of lieutenant-colonel as any offi- 
cer in the line. Your receiving a commission as lieutenant- 
colonel, from the date of that appointment, does not in the 
least injure or interfere with one of them ; unless by virtue 
of it you are introduced into a particular regiment, in vio- 
lation of the right of succession, which is not the case at 
present, neither is it a necessary consequence. As you 
were going to command a battalion, it was proper you 
should have a commission ; and if this commission had 
been dated posterior to your appointment as aid-de-camp, 
I should have considered it derogatory to your former rank, 
to mine, and to that of the whole corps. The only thing 
I see wrong in the affair is this : congress, by their conduct, 
both on the former and present occasion, appear to have 
intended to confer a privilege, an honour, a mark of dis- 
tinction, a something upon you, which they withheld from 
other gentlemen of the family. This carries with it an air 
of preference, which, though we can all truly say we love 
your character and admire your military merit, cannot fail 
to give some of us uneasy sensations. But in this, my dear, 
I wish you to understand me well. The blame, if there is 
any, falls wholly upon congress. I repeat it, your conduct 
has been perfectly right, and even laudable ; you reject- 
ed the offer when you ought to have rejected it, and you 
accepted it when you ought to have accepted it ; and let 
me add, with a degree of over-scrupulous delicacy. It was 
necessary to your project. Your project was the public 
good ; and I should have done the same. In hesitating, 
you have refined on the refinements of generosity. 

" There is a total stagnation of news here. Gates has 
refused the Indian command. Sullivan is come to take it. 
The former has lately given a fresh proof of his impudence, 
his folly, and his *********. 'Tis no great matter ; but a 
peculiarity in the case prevents my saying what. 



238 THE LIFE OF 

" Fleury shall be taken care of. All the family send love. 
In this join the General and Mrs. Washington ; and what is 
oest, it is not in the style of ceremony, but sincerity." 

The departure of D'Estaing leaving little prospect of ac- 
tive operations at the south, Laurens again rejoined the 
staff of Washington. On his return, he thus writes to his 
friend, from Philadelphia, where congress was in session. 

LAURENS TO HAMILTON. 

December 18, 1779. 

i 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

On my arrival in town, I was informed by the President, 
that congress had suspended the business of appointing a 
secretary to their minister plenipotentiary at Versailles un- 
til my return, in hopes that I might still be prevailed upon 
to accept the office. I replied, that I thought my letter upon 
the subject sufficiently explicit, and assured him of my sin- 
cere desire to be excused from serving in that capacity at 
the present juncture of our affairs. 

He urged the unanimity of the choice with respect to me 

the difficulty of uniting the suffrages of all parties, in case 
of a new nomination, and the advantages of this union. Se- 
veral delegates of congress declared to me the embarrass- 
ment of congress since I had declined. One, in particular, 
suggested to me his apprehension of interest being made for 
a late delegate of New- York, who is candidate for the office, 
and to whom the world in general allows greater credit for 
his abilities than his integrity ; and said, " he was determi- 
ned to oppose him with all his influence." When I quitted 
town the sixteenth, these matters crowded into my mind. 
I fell into a train of serious reflections and self-examination, 

endeavoured to investigate whether I had acted conso- 
nantly to the xaXov xai ayadov, and fulfilled the duties of a 
good citizen in the transaction. In fine, I agitated the grand 



HAMILTON. 239 

question, whether a citizen has a right to decline any' office 
to which his countrymen appoint him ; upon what that 
right is founded, and whether it existed in my case. 

After undergoing the severest conflict I ever experien- 
ced, sometimes reproaching, sometimes justifying myself, 
pursuing my journey, or turning retrograde, as the argu- 
ments on the one side or the other appeared to prevail, I 
determined that I had been deficient in the duties of a good 
citizen. I returned to Philadelphia, communicated my sen- 
timents to the President and two other members ; declared 
to them that I thought it incumbent on me, in the first place, 
to recommend a person equally qualified in point of inte- 
grity, and much better in point of ability. That if, unhap- 
pily, they could not agree on Colonel Hamilton, and that I 
was absolutely necessary to exclude a dangerous person, or 
to prevent pernicious delays, I should think it my duty to 
obey the orders of congress. The persons now in nomina- 
tion, are, Colonel Hamilton, Mr. Lovell, Mr. G. Morris, 
Major Stewart. Great stress is laid upon the ability and 
integrity of the person to be employed in this commission. 
I have given my testimony of you in this and the other 
equally essential points. 

My love, as usual. Adieu. 

JOHN LAURENS. 



CHAPTER XI. 

[1780.] 

THE war of the revolution having become a war of 
finance, Hamilton, with a mind awakened to every exigency 
of the country, now directed his attention to the embar- 
rassments of the treasury, and made his first effort in rela- 
tion to its finances. 

In connexion with this subject, a brief allusion to the state 
of the public credit, will not be deemed inappropriate. But 
for a better understanding of the national necessities, it may 
be proper to advert to the prospects of the country at this 
time. 

We have seen the previous year pass away without any 
occurrences of moment, in a military aspect ; and the only 
feature in the picture which engages the attention, is the 
reversed attitude of the belligerents. The Americans, no 
longer flying from a triumphant enemy, but seeking every 
opportunity to attack them ; the British, alarmed for their 
safety, tenaciously covering themselves under the protec- 
tion of their fortifications, and rejoicing at the fluctuating 
counsels of the French, to which they were indebted for 
their security. 

In the states north of the Potomac, the present year pre- 
sents a spectacle of little variety. Amidst discomfiture, 
disaster, and local dissensions, it had been ascertained, that 
upon them no permanent impression could be made. 
Hoping that the alliance with France might be dissolved, 
encouraged by the distresses which its embarrassed finan- 
ces had extended over the country, and which appeared to 
threaten an end of its resources, and stimulated by those 
feelings to which a proud and gallant nation would natu- 

VOL. i. 31 



242 THE LIFE OF 

rally be aroused by the interference of a foreign power, in 
their domestic broils, the British ministry still maintained 
the contest with obstinacy, and determined to subjugate 
the southern states, in the vain hope, that as their sufferings 
would be greater, their patriotism might be less than that 
of their northern brethren. 

The result of these attempts was seen in the capture of 
Charleston, after a gallant and protracted defence, and in 
the defeat of General Gates at Camden ; events which sus- 
tained the ministry, and enabled it to obtain a vote of credit 
for five-and-twenty millions sterling, to continue the war. 

These occurrences, the disappointment which had fol- 
lowed the highly excited expectations from the co-operation 
of France, and the determination which had been manifest- 
ed by the British government, to persevere in the conflict, 
induced a state of feeling in congress widely different from 
the delusive security which palsied their previous measures, 
and had led them to turn not only an inattentive, but an 
indignant ear to the urgent remonstrances of the command- 
er-in-chief and his circle of friends, who still foresaw a long 
series of obstacles to be overcome, before their independ- 
ence would be achieved. 

The difficulty of raising troops, which had so often ex- 
posed the army to disgrace and destruction, had so often 
been surmounted by the energy of Washington, that, per- 
plexing as it had been, it was but a minor evil compared 
with the alarming state of the finances, and the great and 
rapid depreciation of the currency, upon the issues of which 
congress were compelled principally to rely. 

The report of the Board of Treasury, in the autumn of 
seventeen hundred and seventy-nine, had shown an emission 
of bills in circulation amounting to the enormous sum of one 
hundred and sixty millions of dollars, together with a pub- 
lic debt of near forty millions, in foreign and domestic loans ; 
while the whole product of the latter, from the commence- 



HAMILTON. 243 

ment of the war, had but little exceeded thirty millions, 
and of the taxes three millions. 

With the faint hope of sustaining their credit, congress 
passed a vote, on the first of September of the same year, 
pledging themselves not to issue, in bills of credit, a sum 
exceeding two hundred millions ; which they proclaimed to 
the country, accompanied with an exposition of the extent 
of the national resources, and an assurance that full confi- 
dence might be placed in the public faith. 

The wants of the treasury had been so pressing, that in- 
termediate this declaration, and the end of the following 
month of November, the balance of this limited sum was 
issued, and congress were left destitute even of this appa- 
rently last resource. 

In this emergency, the committee of Ways and Means 
adopted, as the only remaining expedient, the negotiation of 
bills on the American envoys in Europe ; which, through 
the recent advices of Monsieur De la Luzerne, they had 
reason to expect would be provided for by the aid of France. 

The sale of these bills was directed to be made at the 
rate of twenty-five dollars in continental bills of credit, for 
four shillings and sixpence sterling, with the condition, that 
the purchasers should lend a sum equal to the cost of the 
bills, at an interest of six per cent. 

In March, seventeen hundred and eighty, the loan which 
had been authorized on the basis of an advance of two 
month's interest to the lender, not being filled, a NEW EMIS- 
SION of bills was ordered, at the rate of forty for one, paya- 
ble in six years, bearing an interest of five per cent., to be 
issued on the faith of the individual states, in proportion to 
their quotas, and a revision of the laws recommended, which 
rendered the continental bills a legal tender.* 

* There were, at this time, three kinds of paper afloat : one bearing an 
interest payable in sterling money, one an interest payable in currency, and 
the third without interest. The two first were called Loan Office Certificates, 



244 THE LIFE OF 

These financial embarrassments, had given rise to scenes 
of extravagant, and, in many instances, profligate specula- 
tion. Going into the market with a currency stamped with 
disgrace, not only was government compelled to purchase 
below the fixed discount of their paper, and thus increase its 
discredit, but individuals, whose resources created confi- 
dence, came forward as competitors, and engrossed the 
supplies, which they dealt out to the administration on their 
own terms. Apprehensions of greater depreciation, indu- 
cing the holders of the paper to force it into the market, 
with a view to realize something intrinsically valuable, 
raised the price of every article ; while many capitalists, 
unable to loan securely, withheld their funds from circula- 
tion. 

The excitement produced by these circumstances, can 
now be with difficulty imagined. On the one hand, the most 
violent denunciations were uttered against "engrossers, 
forestallers and monopolizers," on the other, outcries were 
raised against the public agents, who frequently abused their 
trust ; an internal war ensued between debtor and creditor, 
threatening the most alarming consequences.* 

and, like the bills of credit, were payable to bearer ; but though resting on the 
same security, were in lower credit. To absorb this paper, it was proposed, 
in a series of ingenious essays, signed An American, to create a stock, re- 
deemable by instalments after the war ; but what circulating medium was to 
be substituted, and how the interest on this stock was to be discharged, it is 
believed was not shown. 

* It is curious to remark the extravagant and crude schemes to which this 
state of things gave rise. Among others, it was proposed in Virginia to abo- 
lish all private commerce, and establish companies, including a state, or parts 
of one, in districts. The commercial operations to be represented by stock : 
the prices of every article to be fixed by. the companies ; and to confer on them 
the power of taking private goods into their custody. The project was re- 
commended as a scheme for "appreciating the currency, and reducing the 
prices of necessaries." It was soon followed by an embargo on provisions 
July 17, 1780. 

An enumeration of the flagrant oppressions which were quietly endured by 



HAMILTON. 245 

These were evils in a great degree necessarily inciden- 
tal to the state of the country, with a small capital, and 
deprived of foreign commerce ; but there were others 
wholly attributable to the feeble operation of the confede- 
racy. 

The administration of government by congress, through 
the medium of committees and boards, greatly augmented 
the civil expenditure ; prevented the possibility of secrecy 
or system, and the numerous expedients which exigencies 
suggested, had resulted in the creation of various and con- 
flicting chambers. 

The Board of Treasury, which was established in seven- 
teen hundred and seventy-six, had struggled through two 
years of confusion and delay ; frequently changing its mem- 
bers, after which period were added to it the offices of comp- 
troller, auditor, and treasurer, and two chambers of ac- 
counts. The duties of these were so defined, as to consti- 
tute them checks upon each other : there being, however, 
in no one, that superintendence which was necessary to a 
systematic management of the finances. A twelvemonth 
had not elapsed when it was found necessary to change 
this arrangement, and a new organization was adopted. 

By this scheme, the Board of Treasury was composed of five 
commissioners, of whom three were permitted to hold their 
seats only six months in continuance, and the offices of 
auditor general, treasurer, two chambers of accounts, and 
six auditors, were substituted for the previous plan. To 
this complicated system it was afterwards deemed expe- 
dient to add an extra chamber of accounts. This last body 
had just commenced its operations, when the interference 
with the Board of Treasury in their respective duties, led 

the people, from legislative interference with private rights, tender acts, and 
other encroachments, would be not a little interesting : the results of a govern- 
ment not dealing fairly with the people, and too feeble to enforce, or perhaps, 
even to respect good faith. 



246 THE LIFE OF 

to the necessity of declaring that board paramount to all 
the other branches of the treasury department. 

The delays attendant upon this state of things in settling 
the public accounts, added to the inconveniences which the 
condition of the currency had produced, and the fluctuating 
measures of the treasury, deprived it of all confidence, and 
gave sanction to the most crude and absurd schemes of 
finance. 

The assurances which had been given to the new minis- 
ter from France, of bringing into the field an army of five- 
and-twenty thousand men, had excited the greatest anxiety 
in congress to expedite the requisitions on the states. The 
recently proposed change in the currency was based on 
their co-operation ; and yet the legislatures of many of them 
adjourned without having delegated powers to any member 
of their governments to meet the propositions of congress ; 
and the returns of others, indicated a reluctant and tardy 
compliance with the urgent demands of the confederation. 

As the pressure was more immediately felt at head 
quarters, the financial difficulties urged themselves upon 
the individuals there with peculiar force. The situation of 
Hamilton, in the family of Washington, rendering him the 
confidant of all the secret embarrassments of his chief, 
opened to him an enlarged view of the situation of the 
country ; and enforced upon him more strongly the necessity 
of decisive and immediate relief. His intimacy also with 
the French officers, enabled him to judge of the extent of 
their expectations, and led him to look forward with appre- 
hension to a failure in the engagements with France, as an 
event which might, with other causes, lead, if not to an 
entire abandonment by our ally, to very partial and reluc- 
tant succours. 

The recent debates in the British parliament , had also shown 
the strong hopes of the ministry, that the resources of the 
United States were nearly exhausted, and their expectation 



HAMILTON. 247 

that a continuance of the war might lead to a dissolution of 
the union, which the distempered state of some parts of 
the confederacy seemed at a distance to indicate as not 
improbable. 

Influenced by these considerations, Colonel Hamilton, 
soon after the army had entered winter quarters at Mor- 
ristown, addressed an anonymous letter to Robert Morris, 
then a delegate from Pennsylvania to Congress. In this 
letter he states his plan " to be the product of some read- 
ing on the subjects of commerce and finance, and of occa- 
sional reflections on our particular situation ; but that a 
want of leisure had prevented its being examined in so many 
lights, and digested so maturely, as the importance requires." 
He requests, that if the outlines are thought worthy of atten- 
tion, and any difficulties occur which demand explanations, 
that a letter should be directed to James Montague, to be 
lodged in the post office at Morristown ; and that though 
the writer has reasons which make him unwilling to be 
known, if a personal conference should be thought material, 
that he would endeavour to comply, and asks the letter to 
be regarded as a hasty production. 

In this letter, after giving as his reasons for not address- 
ing him through the press, the extreme delicacy of the sub- 
ject, and the effect of discussion in increasing the evil "by 
exposing our weak sides to the popular eye, and adding 
false terrors to well-founded apprehensions," he proceeds 
to examine the object of principal concern, the state of 
the currency, as to which he observes, that in his opinion, 
all the speculations of the country were founded in error, 
combats the idea that the depreciation could have been 
avoided, and the impression which had been entertained 
that the money might be restored by expedients within our 
own resources ; and to this dangerous and prevalent error 
he attributes the delay in attempting a foreign loan. 

He shows that the badness of the money was originally 
the effect of the condition of the country, and of the exer- 



248 THE LIFE OF 

tions made beyond its strength, and not the cause, though, 
at that time, it partook of the nature of both ; that as 
prices rose, the value of money fell ; and that as the public 
expenditures became immense, no taxes which the people 
could bear on that quantity of money which is deemed a pro- 
per medium, would have been sufficient for the current de- 
mands of the nation, had it been gold instead of paper ; that 
the idea was chimerical, that without resorting to foreign 
loans, we could do otherwise than augment the quantity 
of our artificial wealth beyond those bounds which were pro- 
per to preserve its credit. 

That the quantity of money in circulation, previous to the 
revolution, was about thirty millions of dollars, which was 
barely sufficient for our interior commerce, the foreign trade 
being carried on by barter ; and as the balance of our prin- 
cipal trade was against us, and the specie was transferred 
to meet that balance, no part of it entered into the home 
circulation ; and that it would have been impossible, by 
loans and taxes, to bring such part of it into the public cof- 
fers as would have served the purposes of the war, without 
obstructing commercial operations. 

He next shows, that the product of the taxes, both from 
the peculiar situation of the country, and by reference to 
the condition of other countries, would necessarily be ina- 
dequate to our wants. 

Hence he infers, that congress, when their emissions rose 
to thirty millions, were obliged, in order to keep up the sup- 
plies, to go on creating artificial revenues by new emissions ; 
and that the only remedy then was a foreign loan, which 
judiciously applied, and assisted by a vigorous taxation, 
would have created a credit that might have prevented the 
excess of emissions. He contends, on the same principles, 
that in proportion to the extent of the depreciation at that 
time, was the impossibility of raising the money value by 
any other means, and that in the existing situation of the 
country, a FOREIGN LOAN was the only expedient. 



HAMILTON. 249 

He adds, " these reasonings may prove useless, as the ne- 
cessity of a loan is admitted, but that his object is to establish 
good principles, the want of which has brought us to the 
desperate crisis we have arrived at, and may betray us into 
fatal mistakes." 

The next inquiry raised is, How is the loan to be em- 
ployed ? Two plans were stated to have been in contem- 
plation : one, that of buying up the paper, which he shows 
would have been impracticable, from the rapid artificial 
appreciation of it, which would require means far beyond 
the compass of the national resources, while this apprecia- 
tion would be more relative to the purchasing medium, than 
to the prices of commodities, as the value of the paper might 
be raised by the combination of individuals, while the re- 
duction of prices must necessarily be slow, depending, as it 
would, on the sentiments of the great body of the people. 

The result of this plan, he states, would be " that the 
money would return into circulation almost as fast as it was 
drawn out, and at the end of the year the treasury would be 
completely empty; the foreign loan dissipated, and the 
state of the finances as deplorable as ever. It would be 
much better, instead of purchasing up the paper currency, 
to purchase the supplies with the specie or bills." "A 
great source of error," he observes, " in disquisitions of this 
nature, is the judging of events by abstract calculations, 
which, though geometrically true, are false as they relate 
to the concerns of beings governed more by passion and 
prejudice, than by an enlightened sense of their interests. 
A degree of illusion mixes itself in all the affairs of society. 
The opinion of objects has more influence than their real 
nature. The quantity of money in circulation, is certainly 
a chief cause of its declining ; but we find it is depreciated 
more than five times as mush as it ought to be : the ex- 
cess is derived from opinion, a want of confidence. In 
like manner, we deceive ourselves, when we suppose the 

VOL. i. 32 



250 THE LIFE OF 

value will increase in proportion as the quantity is lessened; 
opinion will operate here also, and a thousand circumstan- 
ces may promote or counteract the principle." 

The other plan proposed, was to convert the loan into 
merchandise, and import it on public account. This plan, 
though better than the former, he deems also liable to great 
objections, but not wholly to be rejected ; and after suggest- 
ing a tax in kind, he contends, that "the only plan which 
can preserve the currency, is one that will make it the im- 
mediate interest of the moneyed men to co-operate with go- 
vernment in its support. This country is in the same pre- 
dicament in which France was previous to the famous Mis- 
sissippi scheme, projected by Mr. Law. Its paper money, 
like ours, had dwindled to nothing, and no efforts of the 
government could revive it, because the people had lost all 
confidence in its ability. Mr. Law, who had much more pene- 
tration than integrity, readily perceived that no plan could 
succeed, which did not unite the interest and credit of rich in- 
dividuals with those of the state ; and upon this he framed 
the idea of his project, which so far agreed in principle with 
the Bank of England, the foundation was good, but the 
superstructure too vast. The projectors aimed at unlimit- 
ed wealth, and the government itself expected too much, 
which was the cause of the ultimate miscarriage of the 
scheme, and of all the mischiefs that befel the kingdom in 
consequence. It will be our wisdom to select what is good 
in this plan, and in any others that have gone before us, 
avoiding their defects and excesses. Something on a simi- 
lar principle in America, will alone accomplish the resto- 
ration of paper credit, and establish a permanent fund for 
the future exigencies of government." 

He then states his plan to be an American bank, to be 
instituted by congress for ten years, under the denomination 
of " The Bank of the United States." 

The basis of this bank was to be a foreign loan of two 



HAMILTON. 251 

millions sterling, to be thrown into the bank as a part of its 
stock ; a subscription to be opened in the currency of two 
hundred millions of dollars, and the subscribers to be incor- 
porated ; the payment of which to be guarantied by the 
government on the dissolution of the bank, by ten millions 
of specie, being at the rate of one for twenty, or by a cur- 
rency bona fide equivalent, and the annual money taxes to 
become part of the stock. 

All the remaining paper to be called in, (at the option of 
the possessor,) and bank notes to be issued in lieu of it for so 
much sterling, payable to the bearer in three months from 
the date, at two per cent, per annum interest ; a pound 
sterling to be estimated at two hundred and sixty-six and 
two-thirds of the existing dollars ;* the interest payable 
punctually in specie at the end of the three months, when 
the possessor might have the bank notes renewed, or receive 
the sum deposited in the old paper ; all the money issued 
from the bank to be of the same denomination, and on the 
same terms. 

An annual loan of two millions sterling to be furnished 
to congress by the bank, at four per cent., and the whole, 
or part of the stock, by arrangement between the bank and 
a Board of Trade, which he contemplated, to be employed 
in commerce. If only a part, the residue to be loaned oc- 
casionally, by permission of congress, in such sums as may 
be thought expedient, at an interest of six per cent., on 
private securities ; the government to hold one half of the 
stock, and the bank to be managed by trustees of the stock- 
holders, under the inspection of the Board of Trade. 

The part of the manuscript which details the effect of the 
commercial operations, is mutilated; but the result is sta- 
ted to be, that the war might be carried on three years, and 
the government incur a debt of only four hundred and 

* Sixty dollars for one dollar of four shillings and sixpence sterling. 



252 THE LIFE OF 

twenty thousand pounds sterling, above the guaranty of 
the subscription, which it is probable would not be requi- 
red, as the corporation would find it their interest to obtain 
a renewal of their charter. 

Having presented his plan, he observes, " that he does 
not believe that its advantages will be as great as they ap- 
pear in speculation, from a less profitable commerce than 
is supposed, and from other causes. I am aware how apt 
the imagination is to be heated in projects of this nature, 
and to overlook the fallacies which often lurk in first prin- 
ciples. But when I consider, on the other hand, that this 
scheme stands on the firm footing of public and private faith, 
that it links the interest of the state in an intimate connex- 
ion with those of the rich individuals belonging to it ; that 
it turns the wealth and influence of both into a commercial 
channel for mutual benefit, which must afford advantages 
not to be estimated ; that there is a defect of a circula- 
ting medium, which this plan supplies by a'sort of creative 
power, converting what is so produced, into a real and effi- 
cacious instrument of trade ; I say, when I consider these 
things, and many more that might be added, I cannot for- 
bear feeling a degree of confidence in the plan, and at least 
hoping that it is capable of being improved into something 
that will give relief to our finances." 

To enlarge its advantages, he suggests that a variety of 
secondary expedients may be invented, and the whole scheme 
of annuities engrafted upon it. 

That the European loan might be converted into a Euro- 
pean bank, to aid the American bank, by engaging the inte- 
rests of the wealthy, and that the bank might also make con- 
tracts with the government for the supplies of the army, on 
terms mutually beneficial. He then expatiates on the rea- 
sons for giving one half of the stock to the government, and 
answers the objection that the plan might be prejudicial to 



HAMILTON. 253 

trade, by proposing a guaranty from the government not 
to grant any monopolies. 

To the scheme, notes are appended, explanatory of the 
operation of the project ; in one of which he states, "a Board 
of Trade ought immediately to be established. The royal 
council of France, and the subordinate chambers in each 
province, form an excellent institution, and may, in many 
respects, prove a model. Congress have too long neglect- 
ed to institute a good scheme of administration, and throw 
public business into proper executive departments. For 
commerce, I prefer a board ; but for most other things, sin- 
gle men. We want a Minister of War, a Minister of Fo- 
reign Affairs, a Minister of Finance, and a Minister of Ma- 
rine. There is always more decision, more despatch, more 
secrecy, and more responsibility where single men, than 
where bodies are concerned. By a plan of this kind, we 
should blend the advantages of a monarchy and of a repub- 
lic, in a happy and beneficial union. Men will only devote 
their lives and attention to a profession on which they can 
build reputation and consequence, which they do not share 
with others. If this plan should be approved, congress 
ought immediately to appoint a Minister of Finance. He 
ought to be a man of ability, to comprehend it in all its con- 
sequences, and of eloquence to make others comprehend 
and relish it. He ought, besides, to have some general 
knowledge of the science, and to address himself to some 
of the most suitable moneyed men, to convince them of the 
utility of the project. The congress must establish the 
bank, and set it agoing. I know of no man that has better 
pretensions than yourself, and shall be very happy to hear 
that congress have said, ' Thou art the man.' " 

The first essay of an individual, who has been designated 
as " the Founder of the public credit of the United States," 
will have interest, (although his project was not adopted in 
all its parts,) as evincing the progressive growth of his mind. 



254 THE LIFE OF 

At a time when the intricate science of finance was little 
understood in the United States, the statesman will per- 
ceive the clear and sound views which are taken of the 
condition of the currency ; and will remark, with admira- 
tion, how far the author of this plan rose above all the crude 
opinions of that day ; rejecting the whole scheme of legis- 
lative expedients, and pointing out, as the only basis of a 
permanent system, the combination of public with private 
capital. It has been observed, that this project was not 
embraced in all its parts ; but it had, nevertheless, its influ- 
ence on the mind of the eminent financier of the revolution ; 
for within a short time after, a plan of a bank in Pennsyl- 
vania was introduced by him, founded on private contribu- 
tions, to the amount of 300,000 sterling, by patriotic indi- 
viduals, to furnish the army with a temporary supply of pro- 
visions, which, though limited in its views, led on to farther 
results of moment. The idea of executive departments, 
also, from this time, became a topic of discussion in con- 
gress ; which, as will be seen hereafter, was more earnest- 
ly pressed upon the consideration of that body by him, and 
was ultimately adopted, almost in the terms proposed by 
Hamilton. 

A question has been recently raised, as to the merit of 
having first suggested an American bank. It would be idle 
to allege, that with similar institutions existing in Europe, 
it was not a topic frequently adverted to by thinking men 
in America ; and there is found, within a short time after 
the date of Hamilton's communication, a suggestion, in a 
gazette of Massachusetts, of the Bank of Amsterdam as a 
model for such an institution ; but the most careful research- 
es show, that Hamilton's first revolutionary plan had more 
than a twelvemonth's priority* over that of the Superin- 

* This remark refers to the Bank of North America. Hamilton's first plan 
was addressed to Robert Morris, in 1779. The Bank of Pennsylvania was 



HAMILTON. 255 

tendent of finance, of which the merit is claimed by his as- 
sistant.* 

Although the idea of a bank, with powers to carry on 
commercial operations, may be regarded with some dis- 
trust, and the extent of the plan may be supposed to dero- 
gate from its merit, yet a careful examination of this scheme 
will show, that it was the only one, proposed at that time, 
which could have absorbed the depreciated paper, and have 
restored a sound currency ; which the other projects could 
not have effected. The idea of using the credit of govern- 
ment in mercantile adventures, which is the only objectional 
part of the scheme, as a general one, was peculiarly felici- 
tous at the time it was suggested, and might have been in- 
strumental in producing a uniform sytem of commercial re- 
gulations. As a mere temporary expedient, it did not es- 
cape the vigilant observation of Robert Morris, who enter- 
ed into several commercial adventures, on account of the 
United States, to pay the interest on the foreign debt, which 
proved a great convenience to the treasury, and resulted in 
a small profit to the government. 

During the series of military disasters at the south, the 
sufferings of the army at Morristown, in a winter of memo- 
rable severity, baffle description ; a post from which, in 
the reduced numbers of his men, Washington could not 
move with safety, and which possessed advantages that 
more than counterbalanced the inconvenience of its rugged 
and snow-clad hills. These sufferings were much increased 
by the introduction of a new system of requisitions, and by 
a most unwise interference with the civil staff of the army, 

reported to congress June 22d, 1780. The Bank of North America, it will be 
ubsequently seen, was proposed by Robert Morris, in May, 1781. 

* Mr. G. Morris was appointed assistant to R. Morris, July 6th, 1781. It 
is stated, in a letter of Mr. G. Morris to a friend " The first bank in this coun- 
try was planned by your humble servant" Life qfG. Morris, vol. i, p. 235. 



256 THE LIFE OF 

which led to the resignation of General Greene, as quarter- 
master-general. 

To meet this emergency, a committee was appointed by 
congress, to confer with the commander-in-chief, of which 
General Schuyler was the leading member. This gentle- 
man, disgusted with the injuries he had received, after the 
sentence of a court martial, (which was long cruelly with- 
held from his most urgent solicitations,) acquitting him of all 
misconduct, and declaring that he was entitled to the high- 
est honours,* had been recently returned to congress ; hav- 
ing determined never more to fill any other stations than 
such as w r ere derived directly from the people, to whom he 
chose only to be responsible. His arrival in camp was wel- 
comed by Washington, with all the ardour of devoted friend- 
ship ; and the result of their conferences, aided by General 
Greene, was a plan investing the commander-in-chief with 
powers adequate to the exigency. But an over-cautious 
congress withheld from him a trust, which had been before 
exercised with unexampled moderation, and with infinite 
public advantage. f 

The golden opportunity of regaining New- York was thus 
lost ; and Washington, with victory in his grasp, was com- 
pelled to submit to the insulting inroads of the enemy, from 
a want of means to put his little army in motion. But even 
thus situated, he was unwilling to be inactive ; and learning 
that a body of the enemy was stationed at Staten Island, 
he despatched Lord Stirling to attack them, accompanied 

* Mr. Jay, in a letter of February 12th, 1778, says: "Congress has refused 
to accept your resignation. Twelve states are represented ; New-England 
and Pennsylvania against you. The delegates of the latter are new men, 
and not free from the influence of the former. From New- York, south, you 
have fast friends. I have the best authority to assure you, the commander- 
in-chief wishes you to retain your commission." 

f And yet, soon after, martial law was proclaimed in Pennsylvania, (June 
9th, 1780,) in order to enable the state officers to procure supplies, and to 
drive strangers from Philadelphia. 



HAMILTON. 257 

by Colonel Hamilton to aid in the execution of the project. 
But it appears, from a letter of the latter, written on the 
night selected for the attack, that the ice at Bergen Point 
was impassable ; and the expedition returned, without hav- 
ing effected any thing of moment. 

The situation of the prisoners being still a source of great 
disquietude, Hamilton was sent on a commission, with Gene- 
ral St. Clair and Colonel Carrington, (with the latter of 
whom he maintained an intimacy through life, founded on 
the highest respect for his character and abilities,) to meet 
certain British commissioners at Amboy. 

He writes thence, on the seventeenth of March, " that the 
enemy, as was supposed, had no idea of treating on mutual 
ground ; that the commission was broken up ; and that they 
were in private conversation, entertaining hopes that the 
liberation of our prisoners would be effected on admissible 
terms." This desirable result was not attained. 

The sufferings of the army now produced an effect which 
had long been apprehended. " Two regiments of Connec- 
ticut paraded under arms, with a declared resolution to re- 
turn home, or obtain subsistence at the point of the bayo- 
net. The interference of the officers, and decisive mea- 
sures, soon suppressed the mutiny; a discovery was made, 
that they had been tampered with by the enemy, who, ho- 
ping to take advantage of their supposed disaffection, moved 
a force suddenly to Springfield."* To counteract this move- 
ment, General Greene was sent forward by General Wash- 
ington, and Hamilton was directed to reconnoitre. The 
battle of Springfield ensued, " in which the veteran Knyp- 
hausen was baffled and almost beaten, by the gallantry of 
Greene, at, the head of a force of continentals and militia, 
amounting to little more than a third of the enemy,"f the 
last of his distinguished achievements at the north.

258 THE LIFE OF 

The anxiety produced by the discontents of the army, and 
the views entertained at head quarters of the national pros- 
pects, are strongly depicted in a letter transmitted by the 
commander-in-chief to Messrs. Schuyler and Peabody, a 
committee of congress. After a few preliminary observa- 
tions, it states : " The view given of our situation by con- 
gress, is just, full, and explicit. The measures they have re- 
commended are well adapted to the emergency, and of in- 
dispensable necessity. I very freely give it as my opinion, 
that unless they are carried into execution, in the fullest ex- 
tent, and with the greatest decision and rapidity, it will be 
impossible for us to undertake the intended co-operation 
with any reasonable prospect of success. 

"The consequences you have well delineated. The suc- 
cour designed for our benefit will prove a serious misfor- 
une ; and instead of rescuing us from the embarrassments 
we experience, and from the danger with which we are 
threatened, will, in all probability, precipitate our ruin. 
Drained and weakened as we already are, the exertions we 
shall make, though they may be too imperfect to secure 
success, will at any rate be such as to leave us in a state of 
relaxation and debility, from which it will be difficult, if 
not impracticable, to recover. The country exhausted, the 
people disheartened, the consequence and reputation of 
these states in Europe sunk, our friends chagrined and 
discouraged, our enemies deriving new credit, new confi- 
dence, and new resources, we have not, nor ought we to 
wish, an alternative. The court of France has done so 
much that we must make a decisive effort on our part. 
Our situation demands it, 'tis expected. We have the 
means to success, without some unforeseen accident ; and 
it only remains to employ them. But the conjuncture re- 
quires all our wisdom, and all our energy. Such is the 
present state of this country, that the utmost exertion of 
its resources, though equal, is not more than equal, to the 



HAMILTON. 259 

object, and our measures must be so taken as to call them 
into immediate and full effect." After some observations, 
indicating the necessity of obtaining a larger supply of men, 
it is stated : " Unless the principal part of the force be com- 
posed of men regularly organized, and on the continuance 
of whose services we can rely, nothing decisive can be at- 
tempted. The militia are too precarious a dependence to 
justify such an attempt, where they form a particular part 
of the plan. Militia cannot have the necessary habits, nor 
the consistency, either for an assault or a siege. In em- 
ploying them essentially, we should run the risk of being 
abandoned in the most critical moments. 

" The mode by draft is, I am persuaded, the only effica- 
cious one to obtain men. It appears to me certain, that it 
is the only one to obtain them in time ; nor can the period 
you have appointed for bringing them into the field be de- 
layed, without defeating the object. I have little doubt, 
that at any time, and much less at the present juncture, the 
power of government, exerted with confidence, will be equal 
to the purpose of drafting. The hopes of the people, ele- 
vated by the prospect before them, will induce a cheerful 
compliance with this and all the other measures of vigour 
which have been recommended, and which the exigency 
requires." 

Similar views were, with the greatest solemnity, and most 
eloquently, presented to congress throughout the year. 

The anticipated reinforcements from France, to which 
this extract refers, and which excited the expectations of 
the country to so great a degree, arrived off the coast early 
in July. 

Soon after the intelligence was received at head quarters, 
a letter was addressed to the committee of co-operation, 
stating, " that the Guadaloupe had arrived in New- York, 
and brought an account that she had fallen in with a large 
French fleet, consisting of several sail of the line, and a num- 



260 THE LIFE OP 

her of transports, between the Capes of Virginia and Dela- 
ware. This intelligence has every appearance of authen- 
ticity ; and, if true, the arrival of the fleet on the coast may 
instantly be looked for. This, indeed, must be the case at 
any rate from the time they are said to have sailed. It 
cannot be too much lamented, that our preparations are 
still so greatly behind hand ; not a thousand men, that I have 
heard of, have yet joined the army, and in all probability 
the period for commencing our operations is at hand. I am 
happy to learn, that a spirit of animation has diffused itself 
throughout the states, from which we may expect the hap- 
piest consequences. But the exigency is so pressing, that 
we ought to multiply our efforts, to give new activity and 
despatch to our measures ; levying and forwarding the men, 
providing the supplies of every sort required ; forage and 
transportation, demand particular attention. After what 
had been preconcerted with the honourable the congress, 
after two month's previous notice of the intended succour, 
if our allies find us unprepared, and are obliged to wait se- 
veral weeks in a state of inaction, it is easy to conceive how 
unfavourable will be the impressions, which if improved with 
all the vigour in our pow r er, is less than were to be wished for 
an undertaking of so arduous and important a nature. So 
much is at stake, so much to be hoped, so much to be 
lost, that we shall be inexcusable if we do not employ all 
our zeal and all our exertion." 

The arrival of these reinforcements awakened a new in- 
terest to effect a descent on New- York. 

A plan of operations was immediately forwarded to Cape 
Henry, with a communication, apprizing the French com- 
manders, Rochambeau and De Ternay, of the naval force 
and position of the enemy ; indicating a station off Sandy 
Hook for the purpose of intercepting the troops which had 
embarked at Charleston on their return to New- York, and 
proposing a combined attack on that place. 



HAMILTON. 261 

Intelligence being received of the arrival of Admiral 
Greaves, a letter was prepared by Colonel Hamilton, urging 
the French commanders, in case of the superiority of their 
force, still to proceed to Sandy Hook ; in which he states, 
that later information had led them to believe that the har- 
bour of New-York was more practicable than had been sup- 
posed, and strongly inciting them by " the greater glory 
which would be derived from overcoming increased diffi- 
culties," to adhere to the original plan. The French were, 
however, unwilling to encounter the enemy, and made sail 
for Newport ; whither Sir Henry Clinton, apprehensive of 
losing it, made a rapid movement. Washington, on his de- 
parture, instantly pushed for New-York, when Clinton sud- 
denly returning, the Americans recrossed the Hudson. From 
this period, the respective armies retired to their former 
quarters, the Americans waiting farther reinforcements from 
France. 

The uncertain counsels which seemed to have governed 
the French commanders, and the course of the correspond- 
ence with them from head quarters, notwithstanding the 
mission of La Fayette to Newport, rendered a personal in- 
terview between them and Washington desirable, in order 
to efface an impression entertained by Rochambeau, that his 
communications had received less attention than he ima- 
gined them entitled to ; a measure which Hamilton ad- 
vised, influenced by letters from Colonel Fleury. 

With this view, General Washington having ordered Ge- 
neral Greene to move to Tappan, in order to protect West 
Point, proceeded with*La Fayette, Hamilton, and McHen- 
ry, to meet the Count and Admiral at Hartford, on the 
twentieth of September. 

The arrival of Rodney, rendering the projected attack on 
New-York impracticable, it was reluctantly abandoned ; 
and after some general conversation as to the probable 
strength of the reinforcements, and the policy of their future 



262 THE LIFE OF 

operations, the commanders returned to their respective 
quarters. 

During this journey, an event occurred which threatened 
the most alarming consequences to the country, and was 
attended with circumstances of the deepest interest. 

As Washington and La Fayette were returning from 
Hartford, the former proposed to visit some works which 
had been recently erected, and as General Arnold, who had 
command at West Point, was waiting breakfast for them, 
Hamilton and McHenry proceeded to his quarters, at the 
house of Mr. Beverley Robinson, to announce the approach 
of the General. 

While they were sitting at table, Arnold received a note, 
stating the arrest of Major Andre. He immediately left 
the table, ran up stairs, mentioned the event to his wife, and 
left her, though fainting, under the pretence of preparing 
for the reception of the commander-in-chief at West Point. 

The General and a part of his suite learning Mrs. Ar- 
nold's indisposition before they entered the house, embark- 
ed for the Point, and were astonished to find that Arnold 
was not there. During their absence, Colonel Hamilton 
received the papers which had been despatched from the 
lines in quest of the commander-in-chief, and sent him the 
alarming tidings. Hamilton and McHenry rode instantly 
to the water's edge in pursuit of the traitor, who had, by 
this time, proceeded some distance in a barge, which con- 
veyed him on board the Vulture, whence he addressed an 
audacious letter to Washington. 

Irritated and appalled as Washington was, his first thought 
was to send a message to Mrs. Arnold, stating that although 
his duty had rendered it necessary to endeavour to capture 
her husband, he found pleasure in soothing her sorrows, by 
the assurance that he was safe ; while Hamilton wrote to 
General Greene, who was uninformed of the extent of the 
treason, to put his army under marching orders. 



HAMILTON. 263 

" The feelings of the whole army," says La Fayette, from 
whom these incidents are derived, " were most liberal in 
behalf of Andre ; but none was more impressed with those 
sentiments of generosity and sympathy than Colonel Ha- 
milton. He was daily searching some way to save him. 
Every wish to that effect having proved impossible, Hamil- 
ton, who was as sensible as any other of that impossibility, 
and one of those who lamented it the most, published a nar- 
rative of the events, and a portraiture of the unfortunate 
Andre, which is a masterpiece of literary talents and amia- 
ble sensibility." As it embraces all the essential circum- 
stances of this interesting scene, and has been erroneously 
published, it may not improperly be introduced into the 
biography of its author. 

HAMILTON TO LAURENS. 

Since my return from Hartford, my dear Laurens, my 
mind has been too little at ease to permit me to write to 
you sooner. It has been wholly occupied by the affecting 
and tragic consequences of Arnold's treason. My feelings 
were never put to so severe a trial. You will no doubt 
have heard the principal facts before this reaches you ; but 
there are particulars to which my situation gave me access, 
that cannot have come to your knowledge from public re- 
port, which I am persuaded you will find interesting. 

From several circumstances, the project seems to have 
originated with Arnold himself, and to have been long 
premeditated. The first overture is traced back to some 
time in June last. It was conveyed in a letter to Colonel 
Robinson, the substance of which was, that the ingratitude 
he had experienced from his country, concurring with other 
causes, had entirely changed his principles ; that he now 
only sought to restore himself to the favour of his king, by 
some signal proof of his repentance, and would be happy 
to open a correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton for that 



264 THE LIFE OF 

purpose. About this period he made a journey to Connecti- 
cut ; on his return from which to Philadelphia, he solicited 
the command of West Point, alleging that the effects of 
his wound had disqualified him for the active duties of the 
field. The sacrifice of this important post was the atone- 
ment he intended to make. General Washington hesitated 
the less to gratify an officer who had rendered such eminent 
services, as he was convinced the post might be safely 
entrusted to one who had given so many distinguished 
proofs of his bravery. In the beginning of August he 
joined the army, and renewed his application. The ene- 
my at this juncture had embarked the greatest part of their 
force on an expedition to Rhode-Island, and our army was 
in motion to compel them to relinquish the enterprise or to 
attack New-York in its weakened state. The General of- 
fered Arnold the left w r ing of the army, which he declined, 
on the pretext already mentioned, but not without visible 
embarrassment. He certainly might have executed the 
duties of such a temporary command, and it was expected 
from his enterprising temper, that he would gladly have 
embraced so splendid an opportunity. But he did not 
choose to be diverted a moment from his favourite object ; 
probably from an apprehension, that some different dispo- 
sition might have taken place which would have excluded 
him. The extreme solicitude he discovered to get posses- 
sion of the post, would have led to a suspicion of the trea- 
chery, had it been possible, from his past conduct, to have 
supposed him capable of it. 

The correspondence thus began, was carried on between 
Arnold and Major Andre, Adjutant General to the British ar- 
my, in behalf of Sir Henry Clinton, under feigned signatures, 
and in a mercantile disguise. In an intercepted letter of Ar- 
nold,which lately fell into our hands, he proposes an inter- 
view " to settle the risks and profits of the copartnership," 
and in the same style of metaphor intimates an expected aug- 



HAMILTON. 265 

mentation of the garrison, and speaks of it as the means of 
extending their traffic. It appears by another letter, that 
Andre was to have met him on the lines, under the sanc- 
tion of a flag, in the character of Mr. John Anderson. But 
some cause or other, not known, prevented this interview. 

The twentieth of last month, Robinson and Andre went 
up the river in the Vulture sloop of war. Robinson sent a 
flag to Arnold with two letters, one to General Putnam, 
enclosed in another to himself, proposing an interview with 
Putnam, or in his absence with Arnold, to adjust some pri- 
vate concerns. The one to General Putnam was evidently 
meant as a cover to the other, in case, by accident, the let- 
ters should have fallen under the inspection of a third per- 
son. 

General Washington crossed the river on his way to 
Hartford, the day these despatches arrived. Arnold, con- 
ceiving he must have heard of the flag, thought it necessa- 
ry, for the sake of appearances, to submit the letters to 
him, and ask his opinion of the propriety of complying 
with the request, The General, with his usual caution, 
though without the least surmise of the design, dissuaded 
him from it, and advised him to reply to Robinson, that 
whatever related to his private affairs must be of a civil 
nature, and could only properly be addressed to the civil 
authority. This reference fortunately deranged the plan, 
and was the first link in the chain of events that led to the 
detection. The interview could no longer take place in 
the form of a flag, but was obliged to be managed in a se- 
cret manner. 

Arnold employed one Smith to go on board the Vulture 
the night of the twenty-second, to bring Andre on shore 
with a pass for Mr. John Anderson. Andre came ashore 
accordingly, and was conducted within a picket of ours to 
the house of Smith, where Arnold and he remained together 
in close conference all that night and the day following. 

VOL. i. 34 



266 THE LIFE OF 

At day light in the morning, the commanding officer at 
King's Ferry, without the privity of Arnold, moved a couple 
of pieces of cannon to a point opposite to where the Vul- 
ture lay, and obliged her to take a more remote station. 
This event, or some lurking distrust, made the boatmen re- 
fuse to convey the two passengers back, and disconcerted 
Arnold so much, that by one of those strokes of infatuation 
which often confound the schemes of men conscious of 
guilt, he insisted on Andre's exchanging his uniform for a 
disguise, and returning in a mode different from that in 
which he came. Andre, who had been undesignedly 
brought within our posts, in the first instance, remonstrated 
warmly against this new and dangerous expedient. But 
Arnold, persisting in declaring it impossible for him to 
return as he came, he at length reluctantly yielded to his 
direction, and consented to change his dress, and take the 
route he recommended. Smith furnished the disguise, and 
in the evening passed King's Ferry with him, and proceeded 
to Crompond, where they stopped the remainder of the 
night, (at the instance of a militia officer,) to avoid being sus- 
pected by him. The next morning they resumed their journey, 
Smith accompanying Andre a little beyond Pine's Bridge, 
where he left him. He had reached Tarrytown, when he 
was taken up by three militia men, who rushed out of the 
woods, and seized his horse. At this critical moment, his 
presence of mind forsook him. Instead of producing his 
pass, which would have extricated him from our parties, 
and could have done him no harm with his own, he asked the 
militia men if they were of the upper or lower party, dis- 
tinctive appellations known among the refugee corps. The 
militia men replied, they were of the lower party ; upon 
which he told them he was a British officer, and pressed 
them not to detain him as he was upon urgent business. 
This confession removed all doubt ; and it was in vain he 
afterwards produced his pass. He was instantly forced off 



HAMILTON. 267 

to a place of greater security ; where, after a careful search, 
there were found concealed in the feet of his stockings, se- 
veral papers of importance delivered to him by Arnold. 
Among these there were a plan of the fortifications of West 
Point, a memorial from the engineer on the attack and de- 
fence of the place, returns of the garrison, cannon, and 
stores, copy of the minutes of a council of war held by Ge- 
neral Washington a few weeks before. The prisoner at 
first was inadvertently ordered to Arnold ; but on recollec- 
tion, while still on the way, he was countermanded and 
sent to Old Salem. 

The papers were enclosed in a letter to General Wash- 
ington, which having taken a route different from that by 
which he returned, made a circuit, that afforded leisure for 
another letter, through an ill-judged delicacy, written to 
Arnold, with information of Anderson's capture, to get to 
him an hour before General Washington arrived at his 
quarters, time enough to elude the fate that awaited him. 
He went down the river in his barge to the Vulture, with 
such precipitate confusion, that he did not take with him 
a single paper useful to the enemy. On the first notice" of 
the affair he was pursued, but much too late to be Over- 
taken. 

There was some colour for imagining it was a part of 
the plan to betray the General into the hands of the ene- 
my: Arnold was very anxious to ascertain from him the 
precise day of his return, and the enemy's movement seem 
to have corresponded to this point. But if it was really 
the case, it was very injudicious. The success must have 
depended on surprise, and as the officers at the advanced 
posts were not in the secret, their measures might have 
given the alarm, and General Washington, taking the com- 
mand of the post, might have rendered the whole scheme 
abortive. Arnold, it is true, had so dispersed the garrison 
as to have made a defence difficult, but not impracticable ; 



268 THE LIFE OF 

and the acquisition of West Point was of such magnitude 
to the enemy, that it would have been unwise to connect 
it with any other object, however great, which might make 
the obtaining of it precarious. 

Arnold, a moment before his setting out, went into Mrs. 
Arnold's apartment, and informed her that some transac- 
tions had just come to light, which must forever banish 
him from his country. She fell into a swoon at this decla- 
ration, and he left her in it to consult his own safety, till 
the servants, alarmed by her cries, came to her relief. She 
remained frantic all day, accusing every one who ap- 
proached her with an intention to murder her child, (an 
infant in her arms,) and exhibiting every other mark of the 
most genuine and agonizing distress. Exhausted by the 
fatigue and tumult of her spirits, her phrenzy subsided to- 
wards evening, and she sunk into all the sadness of afflic- 
tion. It was impossible not to have been touched with her 
situation ; every thing affecting in female tears, or in the 
misfortunes of beauty, every thing pathetic in the wounded 
tenderness of a wife, or in the apprehensive fondness of a 
mother, and, till I have reason to change the opinion, I 
will add, every thing amiable in suffering innocence, con- 
spired to make her an object of sympathy to all who were 
present. She experienced the most delicate attentions, 
and every friendly office, till her departure for Philadel- 
phia. 

Andre was, without loss of time, conducted to the head 
quarters of the army, where he was immediately brought 
before a board of general officers, to prevent all possibility 
of misrepresentation or cavil on the part of the enemy. 

The board reported that he ought to be considered as a 
spy, and according to the laws and usages of nations, to 
suffer death, which was executed two days after. 

Never, perhaps, did any man suffer death with more 
justice, or deserve it less. The first step he took after his 



HAMILTON. 269 

capture, was to write a letter to General Washington, con- 
ceived in terms of dignity, without insolence, and apology 
without meanness. The scope of it was to vindicate him- 
self from the imputation of having assumed a mean cha- 
racter, for treacherous or interested purposes ; asserting that 
he had been involuntarily an impostor; that contrary to his 
intention, which was to meet a person for intelligence on 
neutral ground, he had been betrayed within our posts, 
and forced into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise ; 
soliciting only that to whatever rigour policy might devote 
him, a decency of treatment might be observed due to a 
person who, though unfortunate, had been guilty of nothing 
dishonourable. His request was granted in its full extent ; 
for in the whole progress of the affair, he was treated with 
the most scrupulous delicacy. When brought before the 
board of officers, he met with every mark of indulgence, 
and was required to answer no interrogatory which would 
even embarrass his feelings. On his part, while he care- 
fully concealed every thing that might implicate others, he 
frankly confessed all the facts relating to himself, and upon 
his confession, without the trouble of examining a witness, 
the board made their report. The members were not 
more impressed with the candour and firmness, mixed with 
a becoming sensibility which he displayed, than he was 
penetrated with their liberality and politeness. He ac- 
knowledged the generosity of the behaviour towards him 
in every respect, but particularly in this, in the strongest 
terms of manly gratitude. In a conversation with a gen- 
tleman who visited him after his trial, he said, he flattered 
himself he had never been illiberal; but if there were any 
remains of prejudice in his mind, his present experience 
must obliterate them. 

In one of the visits I made to him, (and I saw him se- 
veral times during his confinement,) he begged me to be 
the bearer of a request to the General, for permission to 



270 THE LIFE OF 

send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton. " I foresee my 
fate," said he, " and though I pretend not to play the hero, 
or to be indifferent about life, yet I am reconciled to what- 
ever may happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has 
brought it upon me. There is only one thing that disturbs 
my tranquillity. Sir Henry Clinton has been too good to 
me ; he has been lavish of his kindness ; I am bound to 
him by too many obligations, and love him too well to bear 
the thought that he should reproach himself, or others 
should reproach him, on the supposition of my having con- 
ceived myself obliged, by his instructions, to run the risk I 
did. I would not, for the world, leave a sting in his mind 
that should embitter his future days." He could scarce 
finish the sentence ; bursting into tears, in spite of his ef- 
forts to suppress them, and with difficulty collected himself 
enough afterwards to add, " I wish to be permitted to as- 
sure him, I did not act under this impression, but submit- 
ted to a necessity imposed upon me, as contrary to my own 
inclination, as to his Orders." His request was readily com- 
plied with, and he wrote the letter annexed, with which I 
dare say you will be as much pleased as I am, both for the 
sentiment and diction. 

When his sentence was announced to him, he remarked, 
that since it was his lot to die, there was still a choice in 
the mode, which would make a material difference to his 
feelings ; and he would be happy, if possible, to be indulged 
with a professional death. He made a second application 
by letter, in concise but persuasive terms. It was thought 
this indulgence, being incompatible with the customs of war, 
could not be granted ; and it was, therefore, determined, in 
both cases, to evade an answer, to spare him the sensations, 
which a certain knowledge of the intended mode would in- 
flict. 

In going to the place of execution, he bowed familiarly as 
he went along, to all those with whom he had been acquaint- 



HAMILTON. 271 

ed in his confinement. A smile of complacency expressed 
the serene fortitude of his mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, 
he asked, with some emotion, " must I then die in this man- 
ner ?" He was told it had been unavoidable. " I am re- 
conciled to my fate, (said he,) but not to the mode." Soon, 
however, recollecting himself, he added, " it will be but a 
momentary pang ;" and springing upon the cart, performed 
the last offices to himself, with a composure that excited the 
admiration and melted the hearts of the beholders. Upon 
being told the final moment was at hand, and asked if he 
had any thing to say, he answered, " nothing, but to request 
you will witness to the world, that I die like a brave man." 
Among the extraordinary circumstances that attended him, 
in the midst of his enemies he died universally regretted, 
and universally esteemed. 

There was something singularly interesting in the cha- 
racter and fortunes of Andre. To an excellent understand- 
ing, well improved by education and travel, he united a pe- 
culiar elegance of mind and manners, and the advantage of 
a pleasing person. It is said, he possessed a pretty taste for 
the fine arts, and had himself attained some proficiency in 
poetry, music, and painting. His knowledge appeared with- 
out ostentation, and embellished by a diffidence that rarely 
accompanies so many talents and accomplishments, which 
left you to suppose more than appeared. 

His sentiments were elevated, and inspired esteem ; 
they had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocu- 
tion was handsome ; his address easy, polite, and insinua- 
ting. By his merit, he had acquired the unlimited confi- 
dence of his General, and was making a rapid progress in 
military rank and reputation. But in the height of his ca- 
reer, flushed with new hopes from the execution of a pro- 
ject the most beneficial to his party that could be devised, 
he was at once precipitated from the summit of prosperity, 



272 THE LIFE OF 

and saw all the expectations of his ambition blasted, and 
himself ruined. 

The character I have given of him, is drawn partly from 
what I saw of him myself, and partly from information. I 
am aware, that a man of real merit is never seen in so fa- 
vourable a light as through the medium of adversity. The 
clouds that surround him are shades that set off his good 
qualities. Misfortune cuts down the little vanities, that in 
prosperous times serve as so many spots in his virtues, and 
gives a tone of humility that makes his worth more amia- 
ble. His spectators, who enjoy a happier lot, are less prone 
to detract from it through envy ; and are more disposed by 
compassion to give him the credit he deserves, and perhaps 
even to magnify it. 

I speak not of Andre's conduct in this affair as a philoso- 
pher, but as a man of the world. The authorized maxims 
and practices of war are the satires of human nature. They 
countenance almost every species of seduction, as well as 
violence ; and the General who can make most traitors in 
the army of his adversary is frequently most applauded. 
On this scale we acquit Andre, while we would not but 
condemn him if we were to examine his conduct by the 
sober rules of philosophy and moral rectitude. It is, how- 
ever, a blemish on his fame, that he once intended to pros- 
titute a flag, about this, a man of nice honour ought to 
have had a scruple ; but the temptation was great. Let 
his misfortunes cast a veil over his error. 

Several letters from Sir Henry Clinton, and others, were 
received in the course of the affair, feebly attempting to 
prove that Andre came out under the protection of a flag, 
with a passport from a general officer in actual service ; and 
consequently, could not be justly detained. Clinton sent a 
deputation, composed of Lieutenant General Robinson, Mr. 
Elliot, and Mr. William Smith, to represent, as he said, the 
true state of Major Andre's case. General Greene met 



HAMILTON. 273 

Robinson, and had a conversation with him, in which he re- 
iterated the pretence of a flag, urged Andre's release as a 
personal favour to Sir Henry Clinton, and offered any friend 
of ours in their power in exchange. Nothing could have 
been more frivolous than the plea which was used. The 
fact was, that besides the time, manner, object of the inter- 
view, change of dress, and other circumstances, there was 
not a single formality customary with flags ; and the pass- 
port was not to Major Andre, but to Mr. Anderson. But 
had there been, on the contrary, all the formalities, it would 
be an abuse of language to say, that the sanction of a flag, 
for corrupting an officer to betray his trust, ought to be re- 
spected. So unjustifiable a purpose would not only destroy 
its validity, but make it an aggravation. 

Andre himself has answered the argument, by ridiculing 
and exploding the idea, in his examination before the board 
of officers. It was a weakness to urge it. 

There was, in truth, no way of saving him. Arnold or 
he must have been the victim ; the former was out of our 
power. 

It was by some suspected, Arnold had taken his mea- 
sures in such a manner, that if the interview had been dis- 
covered in the act, it might have been in his power to sacri- 
fice Andre to his own security. This surmise of double 
treachery, made them imagine Clinton would be induced 
to give up Arnold for Andre ; and a gentleman took occa- 
sion to suggest the expedient to the latter, as a thing that 
might be proposed by him. He declined it. The moment 
he had been capable of so much frailty, I should have ceased 
to esteem him. 

The infamy of Arnold's conduct, previous to his desertion, 
is only equalled by his baseness since. Besides the folly of 
writing to Sir Henry Clinton, that Andre had acted under 
a passport from him, and according to his directions, while 
commanding officer at a post, and that, therefore, he did not 

VOL. i. 35 



274 THE LIFE OF 

doubt he would be immediately sent in, he had the effrontery 
to write to General Washington in the same spirit, with the 
addition of a menace of retaliation, if the sentence should be 
carried into execution. He has since acted the farce of 
sending in his resignation. This man is, in every sense, 
despicable. In addition to the scene of knavery and prosti- 
tution during his command in Philadelphia, which the late 
seizure of his papers has unfolded, the history of his com- 
mand at West Point, is a history of little as well as great 
villanies. He practised every art of peculation ; and even 
stooped to connexion with the suttlers of the garrison to de- 
fraud the public. 

To his conduct, that of the captors of Andre formed a stri- 
king contrast. He tempted them with the offer of his watch, 
his horse, and any sum of money they should name. They 
rejected his offers with indignation ; and the gold that could 
seduce a man high in the esteem and confidence of his coun- 
try, who had the remembrance of past exploits, the motives 
of present reputation and future glory, to prop his integrity, 
had no charms for three simple peasants, leaning only on their 
virtue and an honest sense of their duty. While Arnold is 
handed down, with execration, to future times, posterity will 
repeat with reverence the names of Van Wert, Paulding, 
and Williams. 

I congratulate my friend on our happy escape from the 
mischiefs with which this treason was big. It is a new com- 
ment on the value of an honest man, and, if it were possi- 
ble, would endear you to me more than ever. Adieu. 

A. HAMILTON. 

In a letter of the twenty-fifth of September, addressed to 
Miss Schuyler, he thus adverts to this affecting story : 

" Arnold, hearing of the plot being detected, immediately 
fled to the enemy. I went in pursuit of him, but was much 
too late ; and could hardly regret the disappointment, when 



HAMILTON. 275 

on my return, I saw an amiable woman, frantic with dis- 
tress for the loss of a husband she tenderly loved, a trai- 
tor to his country and to his fame, -^- a disgrace to his con- 
nexions ; it was the most affecting scene I ever was witness 
to. She, for a considerable time, entirely lost herself. The 
General went up to see her, and she upbraided him with 
being in a plot to murder her child. One moment she raved, 
another she melted into tears. Sometimes she pressed her 
infant to her bosom, and lamented its fate, occasioned by 
the imprudence of its father, in a manner that would have 
pierced insensibility itself. All the sweetness of beauty, all 
the loveliness of innocence, all the tenderness of a wife, and 
all the fondness of a mother, showed themselves in her ap- 
pearance and conduct. We have every reason to believe, 
that she was entirely unacquainted with the plan, and that 
the first knowledge of it, was when Arnold went to tell her 
he must banish himself from his country and from her for- 
ever. She instantly fell into a convulsion, and he left her 
in that situation. 

" This morning she is more composed. I paid her a visit, 
and endeavoured to soothe her by every method in my pow- 
er ; though you may imagine she is not easily to be consoled. 
Added to her other distresses, she is very apprehensive the 
resentments of her country will fall upon her, (who is only 
unfortunate,) for the guilt of her husband. 

" I have tried to persuade her that her fears are ill found- 
ed ; but she will not be convinced. She received us in bed, 
with every circumstance that would interest our sympathy, 
and her sufferings were so eloquent, that I wished myself 
her brother, to have a right to become her defender ; as 
it is, I have entreated her to enable me to give her proofs 
of my friendship. Could I forgive Arnold for sacrificing his 
honour, reputation, and duty, I could not forgive him for 
acting a part that must have forfeited the esteem of so fine 



276 THE LIFE OF 

a woman. At present, she almost forgets his crime in his 
misfortunes ; and her horror at the guilt of the traitor, is lost 
in her love of the man. But a virtuous mind cannot long 
esteem a base one, and time will make her despise, if it can- 
not make her hate." 

One circumstance in this melancholy scene dwelt deep- 
ly on the mind of Hamilton. It is that to which, in the 
beautiful tribute of an eloquent female,* to the memory 
of Andre, she most feelingly alludes, the manner of 
his death. On the day of his execution, Hamilton thus 
writes.f 

"Poor Andre suffers to-day; every thing that is amiable 
in virtue, in fortitude, in delicate sentiment, and accom- 
plished manners, pleads for him ; but hard-hearted policy 

calls for a sacrifice. He must die . I send you my 

account of Arnold's affair, and to justify myself to your 
sentiments, I must inform you, that I urged a compliance 
with Andre's request to be shot, and I do not think it 
would have had an ill effect, but some people are only 
sensible to motives of policy, and sometimes, from a nar- 
row disposition, mistake it. 

" When Andre's tale comes to be told, and present resent- 
ment is over, the refusing him the privilege of choosing 
the manner of his death will be branded with too much 
obstinacy. 

"It was proposed to me to suggest to him the idea of 
an exchange for Arnold ; but I knew I should have for- 
feited his esteem by doing it, and therefore declined it. 
As a man of honour, he could not but reject it ; and I 
would not for the world have proposed to him a thing 
which must have placed me in the unamiable light of sup- 
posing him capable of a meanness, or of not feeling my- 
self the impropriety of the measure. I confess to you, I

had the weakness to value the esteem of a dying man, be- 
cause I reverenced his merit."* 

The eloquent and feeling narrative contained in these 
letters, which does so much honour to the sentiments of their 
author, is a just tribute to the character of the captive, and 
to the temper of the army. 

Andre, educated amidst a circle of devoted relatives, 
and habitually indulging every ardent impulse of his gene- 
rous nature, had torn himself from their reluctant arms to 
win honour in the field. Commended to the notice of Sir 
Henry Clinton, he rose fast in his esteem, and was often 
selected for those delicate duties which serve to mitigate 
the miseries of war. 

In the performance of these, his deportment often formed 
a strong contrast with that of his less polished brethren ; 
and such was the impression on the minds of those Ameri- 
cans who had been prisoners, that when the news of this 
event arrived, great as was the rejoicing at the detection 
of the plot and the capture of the spy, every bosom swelled 
with regret to learn that that spy was Andre. 

Shocked as Hamilton was with the danger of this con- 
spiracy, and his indignation heightened by the belief that 
it was intended to reach the person of Washington, his ge- 

* The following note was addressed by Andre to General Washington, on 
the day previous to his execution. 

Tappan, October 1, 1780. 

"Buoyed above the terror of death, by the consciousness of a life devoted 
to honourable pursuits, and stained with no action that can give me remorse, 
I trust that the request I make to your excellency, at this serious period, and 
which is to soften my last moments, will not be rejected. 

" Sympathy towards a soldier, will surely induce your excellency, and a 
military tribunal, to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a man of 
honour. 

" Let me hope, sir, if aught in my character impresses you with esteem to- 
wards me, if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of policy, and 
not of resentment, I shall experience the operation of these feelings in your 
breast, by being informed that I am not to die on a gibbet" 



278 THE LIFE OF 

nerous feelings, nevertheless, seemed wholly to take posses- 
sion of him, and during all the period of Andre's confine- 
ment and trial, he exhausted every means to alleviate his 
sufferings, and to withdraw him from the bitterness of his 
reflections. 

As soon as he was brought in, addressing to a much loved 
friend the unnecessary request, he said, " Major Jackson, 
I have learned that Andre was very kind to you when you 
were a prisoner, will you not visit him ?" Thus awakening 
the sympathies of the army, he turned their resentment 
upon the traitor, to whose criminal arts the British officer 
had unhappily lent himself. The conduct of Andre's cap- 
tors was the theme of honest pride, and every soldier in the 
camp participated in their triumph ; but when the day of 
his execution came, he was followed only by the brigade on 
duty, and with the exception of those officers who sur- 
rounded the scaffold to soothe its victim, not an officer or 
soldier was to be seen as a spectator. All retired to their 
tents, exhibiting that delicacy and sensibility which became 
the soldiers of such a cause. 

It is, indeed, impossible to trace the annals of the revo- 
lution without remarking the kind temper of the Americans 
towards their enemies, and the happy commingling of the 
heroic with the milder virtues, both in the army and in the 
people. 

Habituated to all the comforts, indeed luxuries, which 
render the condition of the American commonalty an ob- 
ject of envy among those of less happy regions, and free as 
the wilderness which surrounded them, the aggravated pri- 
vations that followed the march of war, aggravated by 
the insolent bearing of an enemy, who threatened to visit 
on them the calamities which their own nation had expe- 
rienced in a former age, and avowed the dispossession of 
the inhabitants, and the disherison of their progeny, as the 
reward promised to the subjugation of rebels, amid ra- 



HAMILTON. 279 

pine and devastation, when even congress felt it necessary 
to advise the people to erect places of refuge in the forest, 
far from their dwellings, for their aged parents, their chil- 
dren, and their wives, yet whenever the instruments of 
these evils fell into their hands, they are seen nursing their 
wounds, fostering them amid their sufferings, and winning 
them by their kindnesses to a detestation of the cause in 
which they had embarked. In vain are sought instances of 
cruelty to the enemy. It would have been too great a vio- 
lation of public sentiment, and would have doomed its per- 
petrators to infamy. 

This virtue of a humane people, was followed by its re- 
ward. The enemy lost more by desertion than by the 
sword, especially among the mercenaries of the continent ; 
and thus the seeds of those kind feelings were planted in the 
midst of war, which have drawn within the bosom of our 
country, and linked to her institutions, the oppressed of 
every other.

DURING the series of events which have been related in 
the preceding chapter, the mind of Hamilton, roused to the 
great political questions which engaged so strongly the 
public attention, though oppressed with the various labours 
of his situation, to which the letters of his friends frequently 
advert, turned with eager aptitude to an examination of 
the defects of the existing government, and the remedies 
which might be applied. 

Mere military movements had become of secondary in- 
terest ; temporary expedients for the financial embarrass- 
ments were sought in vain ; and while the public press 
was engaged in the discussion of transient questions, he 
was looking with intense anxiety to the adoption of some 
great and effectual mean by which the distresses of the 
country might be reached at their sources. 

From his first entrance into the public service, he felt 
the necessity of a more energetic system ; and it was ob- 
jected to him then, as it has been since, that he looked 
with too fearful an apprehension upon a government merely 
federative and advisory. 

An attempt, the most flagitious, was made on this ground, 
to produce a breach between him and the commander-in- 
chief, which was detected, exposed, and defied with a lofty 
tone of conscious purity.* 

The same sense of the public dangers, influenced in com- 
mon the minds of Washington and Hamilton ; and while 

* The instrument was Doctor Gordon, author of the History of the Ame- 
rican War.

the former in his addresses to congress was enforcing his 
apprehensions with all the solemnity which the dignity of 
his station authorized, the other, by letters to his friends, 
and by personal solicitation, sought, within a more limited 
sphere, to urge attention to this great object of his just and 
honest solicitude. In a letter to Isaac Sears, with whom 
his intimacy had been formed in the early struggles of New- 
York, he thus expresses himself: 

" I was much obliged to you, my dear sir, for the letter 
which you did me the favour to write me since your return 
to Boston. I am sorry to find that the same spirit of indif- 
ference to public affairs prevails. It is necessary we should 
rouse, and begin to do our business in earnest, or we shall 
play a losing game. It is impossible the contest can be 
much longer supported on the present footing. We must 
have a government with more power. We must have a 
tax in kind. We must have a foreign loan. We must 
have a bank, on the true principles of a bank. We must 
have an administration distinct from congress, and in the 
hands of single men under their orders. We must, above 
all things, have an army for the war, and an establishment 
that will interest the officers in the service. 

" Congress are deliberating on our military affairs ; but I 
apprehend their resolutions will be tinctured with the old 
spirit. We seem to be proof against experience. They 
will, however, recommend an army for the war, at least as 
a primary object. All those who love their country, ought to 
exert their influence in the states where they reside to de- 
termine them to take up this object with energy. The states 
must sink under the burden of temporary enlistments, and 
the enemy will conquer us by degrees during the intervals 
of our weakness. 

"Clinton is now said to be making a considerable detach- 
ment to the southward. My fears are high, my hopes low. 
We are told here, there is to be a congress of the neutral 



HAMILTON. 283 

powers at the Hague, for mediating of peace. God send 
it may be true. We want it ; but if the idea goes abroad, 
ten to one if we do not fancy the thing done, and fall into a 
profound sleep, till the cannon of the enemy awaken us 
next campaign. This is our national character. I am, 
with great regard, dear sir, your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON." 

On these measures he seemed, at this time, perpetually to 
descant. Many of his letters have been lost, others cannot 
be obtained ; but in all that are known, his mind appeared 
intent on the accomplishment of what he early foresaw could 
alone save the country 7 , a re-organization of the govern- 
ment. 

A letter written at this period, to his friend Duane, con- 
tains a comprehensive view of the subjects which engrossed 
his thoughts, and will give a clear insight into the character 
of his mind. 

In this will be seen, how early and how deeply he looked 
into the wants of the country ; and with what enlarged ideas 
he projected a form of government, by which congress 
should have complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, 
peace, trade, and finance, and to the management of foreign 
affairs ; reserving merely to the states, that part of internal 
police which relates to the rights of property and life among 
individuals, and to raising money by internal taxes, the 
distribution of the powers of the government into separate 
departments, recruiting the army on a permanent esta- 
blishment, and an extensive and comprehensive system for 
drawing out the resources of the country, and rendering 
them most effectually applicable to its necessities. 

The admirable perspicuity of his style, the extraordinary 
faculty which he showed in what he terms " a hastily writ- 
ten production," and when, as he says, " he is merely skim- 
ming the surface," of comprehending in a summary of his 



284 THE LIFE OF 

thoughts every particular essential to the developement of 
them ; but what will be especially observed, the ripeness of 
his views, and that keen insight into the nature and opera- 
tion of political institutions, which have given to his opinions 
such an authoritative influence, are here strongly manifested. 
He not only suggests the adoption of many of the leading 
measures which were soon after introduced, but points to a 
CONVENTION OF THE STATES, for the creation of a FEDERAL 
CONSTITUTION ; suggests the mode of enforcing its necessity 
on the minds of the people, by " sensible and popular wri- 
tings;" thus hinting at the idea which gave birth to the "Fe- 
deralist," and unfolding some of those far-reaching views of 
national polity, which are there more fully developed. 

COLONEL HAMILTON TO THE HON. JAMES DUANE. 

Liberty Pole, 1780. 
DEAR SIR, 

Agreeable to your request, and my promise, I sit down to 
give you my ideas of the defects of our present system, and 
the changes necessary to save us from ruin. They may, 
perhaps, be the reveries of a projector, rather than the sober 
view's of a politician. You w r ill judge of them, and make 
what use you please of them. 

The fundamental defect is a want of power in congress. 
It is hardly worth while to show in what this consists, as it 
seems to be universally acknowledged ; or to point out how 
it has happened, as the only question is how to remedy it. 
It may, however, be said, that it has originated from three 
causes, an excess of the spirit of liberty, which has made 
the particular states show a jealousy of all power not in 
their own hands ; and this jealousy has led them to exercise 
a right of judging, in the last resort, of the measures recom- 
mended by congress, and of acting according to their own 
opinions of their propriety or necessity; a diffidence in 
congress of their own powers, by which they have been 



HAMILTON. 285 

timid and indecisive in their resolutions ; constantly making 
concessions to the states, till they have scarcely left them- 
selves the shadow of power ; a want of sufficient means 
at their disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of 
vigour to draw forth those means, which have occasioned 
them to depend on the states, individually, to fulfil their en- 
gagements with the army ; the consequence of which has 
been to ruin their influence and credit with the army, to 
establish its dependence on each state, separately, rather 
than on them ; that is, than on the whole collectively. 

It may be pleaded that congress had never any definitive 
powers granted them, and of course could exercise none, 
could do nothing more than recommend. The manner in 
which congress was appointed would warrant, and the pub- 
lic good required, that they should have considered them- 
selves as vested with full power to preserve the republic 
from harm. 

They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, 
which were always cheerfully submitted to ; the declara- 
tion of independence, the declaration of war, the levying 
an army, creating a navy, emitting money, making alliances 
with foreign powers, appointing a dictator, &c. &c. ; all 
these were implications of a complete sovereignty, were 
never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the 
whole conduct of administration. Undefined powers are 
discretionary powers, limited only by the object for which 
they were given ; in the present case, the independence 
and freedom of America. The confederation made no 
difference ; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had 
no operation. 

But, from what I recollect of it, congress have even de- 
scended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives 
them ; while the particular states have no farther attended 
to it, than as it suited their pretensions and convenience. 
It would take too much tir.ie to enter into particular in- 



286 THE LIFE OF 

stances ; each of which, separately, might appear inconsi- 
derable, but united are of serious import. I only mean to 
remark, not to censure. 

But the confederation itself is defective, and requires to 
be altered ; it is neither fit for war, nor peace. The idea 
of an uncontrollable sovereignty in each state, over its in- 
ternal police, will defeat the other powers given to con- 
gress, and make our union feeble and precarious. There 
are instances, without number, where acts necessary for 
the general good, and which rise out of the powers given 
to congress, must interfere with the internal police of the\ 
states ; and there are as many instances in which the par- 
ticular states, by arrangements of internal police, can ef- 
fectually, though indirectly, counteract the arrangements 
of congress. You have already had examples of this, for 
which I refer you to your own memory. 

The confederation gives the states, individually, too much 
influence in the affairs of the army ; they should have no- 
thing to do with it. 

The entire formation and disposal of our military forces 
ought to belong to congress. It is an essential cement of 
the union ; and it ought to be the policy of congress to de- 
stroy all ideas of state attachments in the army, and make 
it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all appoint- 
ments, promotions, and provisions whatsoever, ought to be 
made by them. It maybe apprehended, that this may be 
dangerous to liberty. But nothing appears more evident to 
me, than that we run much greater risk of having a weak 
and disunited federal government, than one which will be 
able to usurp upon the rights of the people. 

Already some of the lines of the army would obey their 
states in opposition to congress, notwithstanding the pains 
we have taken to preserve the unity of the army. If any 
thing would hinder this, it would be the personal influence 
of the General a melancholy a nd mortifying consideration. 



HAMILTON. 287 

The forms of our state constitutions must always give them 
great weight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to 
blind them to the pursuit of a common interest, too easy to 
oppose whatever they do not like, and to form partial com- 
binations, subversive of the general one. There is a wide 
difference between our situation and that of an empire un- 
der one simple form of government, distributed into coun- 
ties, provinces, or districts, which have no legislatures, but 
merely magistratical bodies to execute the laws of a com- 
mon sovereign. Here the danger is, that the sovereign will 
have too much power, and oppress the parts of which it is 
composed. In our case, that of an empire composed of con- 
federative states, each with a government completely or- 
ganized within itself, having all the means to draw its sub- 
jects to a close dependence on itself, the danger is directly 
the reverse. It is, that the common sovereign will not have 
power sufficient to unite the different members together, and 
direct the common forces to the interest and happiness of 
the whole. 

The leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof 
of this. They were continually at war with each other, and 
for want of union fell a prey to their neighbours. They fre- 
quently held general councils, but their resolutions were no 
farther observed, than as they suited the interests and in- 
clinations of all the parties, and, at length, they sunk entirely 
into contempt. 

The Swiss cantons are another proof of the doctrine. 
They have had wars with each other, which would have 
been fatal to them, had not the different powers in their 
neighbourhood been too jealous of one another, and too 
equally matched, to suffer either to take advantage of their 
quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all, 
is to be attributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and 
to the cause just mentioned. These ties will not exist in 
America. A little time hence, some of the states will be 



288 THE LIFE OF 

powerful empires ; and we are so remote from other na- 
tions, that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we 
can wish to cut each other's throats. 

The Germanic corps might also be cited as an example 
in favour of the position. 

The United Provinces may be thought to be one against 
it. But the family of the Stadtholders, whose authority is 
interwoven with the whole government, has been a strong 
link of union between them. Their physical necessities, 
and the habits founded upon them, have contributed to it. 
Each province is too inconsiderable by itself to undertake 
any thing. An analysis of their present constitution would 
show, that they have many ties which would not exist in 
ours ; and that they are by no means a proper model for us. 

Our own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the 
difficulty of drawing out the resources of the country, and 
inducing the states to combine in equal exertions for the 
common cause. The ill success of our last attempt is stri- 
king. Some have done a great deal ; others little, or scarce- 
ly any thing. The disputes about boundaries, &c. testify 
how flattering a prospect we have of future tranquillity, if 
we do not frame in time a confederacy capable of deciding 
the differences, and compelling the obedience of the respect- 
ive members. 

The confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too 
entirely to the state legislatures. It should provide perpe- 
tual funds in the disposal of congress, by a land tax, poll tax, 
or the like. All imposts upon commerce ought to be laid 
by congress, and appropriated to their use ; for without cer- 
tain revenues, a government can have no power ; that pow- 
er which holds the purse strings absolutely, must rule. This 
seems to be a medium, which, without making congress al- 
together independent, will tend to give reality to its autho- 
rity. 

Another defect in our system is, want of method and 



HAMILTON. 289 

energy in the administration. This has partly resulted from 
the other defect ; but in a great degree from prejudice and 
the want of a proper executive. Congress have kept the 
power too much in their own hands, and have meddled 
too much with details of every sort. Congress is properly 
a deliberative corps, and it forgets itself when it attempts 
to play the executive. It is impossible that a body, nume- 
rous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever act with suffi- 
cient decision, or with system. Two thirds of the members, 
one half the time, cannot know what has gone before them, 
or what connexion the subject in hand has to what has been 
transacted on former occasions. The members who have 
been more permanent, will only give information that pro- 
motes the side they espouse, in the present case, and will as 
often mislead as enlighten. The variety of business must 
distract, and the proneness of every assembly to debate, 
must at all times delay. 

Lately, congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have 
gone into the measure of appointing boards. But this is, in 
my opinion, a bad plan. A single man, in each department 
of the administration, would be greatly preferable. It would 
give us a chance of more knowledge, more activity, more 
responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention. 
Boards partake of a part of the inconveniences of larger as- 
semblies ; their decisions are slower, their energy less, 
their responsibility more diffused. They will not have the 
same abilities and knowledge as an administration by single 
men. Men of the first pretensions will not so readily en- 
gage in them, because they will be less conspicuous, of less 
importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing them- 
selves. The members of boards will take less pains to in- 
form themselves and arrive at eminence, because they have 
fewer motives to do it. All these reasons conspire to give 
a preference to the plan of vesting the great executive de- 
partments of the state in the hands of individuals. As these 

VOL. i. 37 



THE LIFE OF 



men will be, of course, at all times under the direction of 
congress, we shall blend the advantages of a monarchy and 
republic in one constitution. 

A question has been made, whether single men could be 
found to undertake these offices. I think they could ; be- 
cause there would be then every thing to excite the ambi- 
tion of candidates. But in order to this, congress, by their 
manner of appointing them, and the line of duty marked 
out, must show that they are in earnest in making these of- 
fices, offices of real trust and importance. 

I fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrange- 
ments, as thotfgh they would lessen the importance of con- 
gress, and leave them nothing to do. But they would have 
precisely the same rights and powers as heretofore, happi- 
ly disencumbered of the detail. They would have to in- 
spect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their 
plans, originate others for the public good, only observ- 
ing this rule, that they ought to consult their ministers, and 
get all the information and advice they could from them, be- 
fore they entered into any new measures, or made changes 
in the old. 

A third defect is, the fluctuating constitution of our army. 
This has been a pregnant source of evil ; all our military 
misfortunes, three-fourths of our civil embarrassments, are 
to be ascribed to it. The General has so fully enumerated 
the mischiefs, in a late letter to congress, that I could only 
repeat what he has said, and will, therefore, refer you to 
that letter. 

The imperfect and unequal provision made for the army, 
is a fourth defect, \vhich you will find delineated in the same 
letter. Without a speedy change, the army must dissolve ; 
it is now a mob rather than an army, without cloth- 
ing, without pay, without provision, without morals, with- 
out discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neg- 
lect of us ; the country begins to hate us for our oppressions 



HAMILTON. 291 

of them. Congress have long been jealous of us ; we have 
now lost all confidence in them, and give the worst con- 
struction to all they do. Held together by the slenderest 
ties, we are ripening for a dissolution. 

The present mode of supplying the army by state purchases 
is not one of the least considerable defects of our system. 
It is too precarious a dependence, because the states will ne- 
ver be sufficiently impressed with our necessities. Each will 
make its own ease a primary object, the supply of the ar- 
my a secondary one. The variety of channels through 
which the business is transacted, will multiply the number 
of persons employed, and the opportunities of embezzling 
public money. From the popular spirit on which most of 
the governments turn, the state agents will be men of less 
character and ability ; nor will there be so rigid a responsi- 
bility among them as there might easily be among those in 
the employ of the continent ; of course not so much dili- 
gence, care, or economy. Very little of the money raised 
in the several states will go into the continental treasury, 
on pretence that it is all exhausted in providing the quotas 
of supplies, and the public will be without funds for the 
other demands of government. The expense will be ulti- 
mately much greater, and the advantage much smaller. 
We actually feel the insufficiency of this plan, and have 
reason to dread, under it, a ruinous extremity of want. 

These are the principal defects in the present system that 
now occur to me. There are many inferior ones in the 
organization of particular departments, and many errors 
of administration, which might be pointed out ; but the 
task would be troublesome and tedious, and if we had once 
remedied those I have mentioned, the. others would not be 
attended with much difficulty. 

I shall now propose the remedies which appear to me 
applicable to our circumstances, and necessary to extri- 
cate our affairs from their present deplorable situation. 



292 THE LIFE OF 

The first step must be to give congress powers compe- 
tent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two 
ways : one by resuming and exercising the discretionary 
powers I suppose to have been originally vested in them 
for the safety of the states, and resting their conduct on the 
candour of their countrymen and the necessity of the con- 
juncture ; the other, by calling immediately a convention 
of all the states, with full authority to conclude finally upon 
a general confederation, stating to them beforehand expli- 
citly the evils arising from a want of power in congress, 
and the impossibility of supporting the contest on its pre- 
sent footing, that the delegates may come possessed of 
proper sentiments, as well as proper authority, to give effi- 
cacy to the meeting. Their commission should include a 
right of vesting congress with the whole or a proportion of 
the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of 
raising a revenue, reserving the jurisdiction to the states by 
w 7 hom they are granted. 

The first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an ex- 
pedient by the generality of congress ; and, indeed, their 
practice hitherto has so rivetted the opinion of their want 
of power, that the success of this experiment may very 
well be doubted. 

I see no objection to the other mode that has any weight 
in competition with the reasons for it. The convention 
should assemble the first of November next ; the sooner 
the better ; our disorders are too violent to admit of a com- 
mon or lingering remedy. The reasons for which I re- 
quire them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority arc, 
that the business may suffer no delay in the execution, and 
may in reality come to effect. A convention may agree 
upon a confederation ; the states, individually, hardly ever 
will. We must have one, at all events, and a vigorous 
one, if we mean to succeed in the contest and be happy 
hereafter. As I said before, to engage the states to com- 



HAMILTON. 293 

ply with this mode, congress ought to confess to them, 
plainly and unanimously, the impracticability, of supporting 
our affairs on the present footing, and without a solid co- 
ercive union. I ask that the convention should have a 
power of vesting the whole or a part of the unoccupied 
lands in congress, because it is necessary that body should 
have some property, as a fund for the arrangements of 
finance ; and I know of no other kind that can be given 
them. 

The confederation, in my opinion, should give congress a 
complete sovereignty ; except as to that part of internal 
police which relates to the rights of property and life 
among individuals, and to raising money by internal taxes. 
It is necessary that every thing belonging to this should be 
regulated by the state legislatures. Congress should have 
complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace, 
trade, finance ; and to the management of foreign affairs ; 
the right of declaring war, of raising armies, officering, 
paying them, directing their motions in every respect ; of 
equipping fleets, and doing the same with them ; of build- 
ing fortifications, arsenals, magazines, &c. &c. ; of making 
peace on such conditions as they think proper ; of regulat- 
ing trade, determining with what countries it shall be car- 
ried on; granting indulgences; laying prohibitions on all 
the articles of export or import ; imposing duties, granting 
bounties and premiums for raising, exporting, or importing ; 
and applying to their own use the product of these duties, 
only giving credit to the states on whom they are raised 
in the general account of revenues and expense ; institut- 
ing admiralty courts, &c. ; of coining money, establishing 
banks on such terms, and with such privileges, as they 
think proper ; appropriating funds, and doing whatever 
else relates to the operations of finance ; transacting 
every thing with foreign nations ; making alliances, offen- 
sive and defensive, treaties of commerce, &c. &c. 



294 THE LIFE OF 

The confederation should provide certain perpetual reve- 
nues, productive and easy of collection ; a land tax, poll 
tax, or the like, which, together with the duties on trade, 
and the unlocated lands, would give congress a substantial 
existence, and a stable foundation for their schemes of 
finance. What more supplies were necessary, should be 
occasionally demanded of the states, in the present mode of 
quotas. 

The second step I would recommend is, that congress 
should instantly appoint the following great officers of 
state : A Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; a President of 
War ; a President of Marine ; a Financier ; a President of 
Trade ; instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be pre- 
ferable, as the regulations of trade are slow and guarded, 
and require prudence and experience, (more than other 
qualities,) for which boards are very well adapted. 

Congress should choose for these offices, men of the first 
abilities, property, and character, in the continent ; and 
such as have had the best opportunities of being acquainted 
with the several branches. General Schuyler, whom you 
mentioned, would make an excellent President of W^ar ; 
General McDougal a very good President of Marine ; Mr. 
Robert Morris would have many things in his favour for 
the department of Finance. He could, by his own per- 
sonal influence, give great weight to the measures he should 
adopt. I dare say, men equally capable may be found for 
the other departments. 

1 know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Fi- 
nancier be President of the Board of Trade ; but he should 
only have a casting voice in determining questions there. 
There is a connexion between trade and finance, which 
ought to make the director of one acquainted with the 
other; but the financier should not direct the affairs of 
trade, because, for the sake of acquiring reputation by in- 
creasing the revenues, he might adopt measures that would 



HAMILTON. 295 

depress trade. In what relates to finance he should be 
alone. 

These officers should have nearly the same powers and 
functions as those in France analogous to them, and each 
should be chief in his department, with subordinate boards, 
composed of assistants, clerks, &c., to execute his orders. 

In my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceiv- 
able utility to our affairs ; its benefits would be very speed- 
ily felt. It would give new life and energy to the opera- 
tions of government. Business would be conducted with 
despatch, method, and system. A million of abuses now 
existing would be corrected, and judicious plans would be 
formed and executed for the public good. 

Another step of immediate necessity is, to recruit the 
army for the war, or at least for three years. This must 
be done by a mode similar to that which is practised in 
Sweden. There the inhabitants are thrown into classes of 
sixteen, and when the sovereign wants men, each of these 
classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of mo- 
ney, and if one of the class is willing to become a soldier, 
he receives the money and offers himself a volunteer ; if 
none is found to do this, a draft is made, and he on whom 
the lot falls, receives the money, and is obliged to serve. 
The minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this 
kind ; the heavy bounties they have been obliged to pay 
for men to serve a few months, must have disgusted them 
with this mode, and made them desirous of another, that 
will, once for all, answer the public purposes, and obviate 
a repetition of the demand. It ought by all means to be 
attempted ; and congress should frame a general plan, and 
press the execution upon the states. When the confede- 
ration comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this, by 
a fundamental law ; and hereafter there would be no doubt 
of the success. But we cannot now wait for this : we 
want to replace the men whose times of service will ex- 



296 THE LIFE OF 

pire the first of January ; for then, without this, we shall 
have no army remaining, and the enemy may do what 
they please. The General, in his letter already quoted, 
has assigned the most substantial reasons for paying imme- 
diate attention to this point. 

Congress should endeavour, both upon their credit in Eu- 
rope, and by every possible exertion in this country, to pro- 
vide clothing for their officers, and should abolish the whole 
system of state supplies. The making good the deprecia- 
tion of the currency, and all other compensations to the 
army, should be immediately taken up by congress, and 
not left to the states ; if they would have the accounts of 
depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given 
for what is due, in specie, or an equivalent to specie, it 
would give satisfaction, appointing periodical settlements 
for future depreciation. 

The placing the officers upon half-pay, during life, would 
be a great stroke of policy, and would give congress a 
stronger tie upon them than any thing else they can do. 
No man, that reflects a moment, but will prefer a perma- 
nent provision of this kind, to any temporary compensa- 
tion ; nor is it opposed to economy ; the difference between 
this, and what has been already done, will be insignificant. 
The benefit of it to the widows, should be confined to those 
whose husbands die during the war. As to the survivors, 
not more than one-half, on the usual calculation of men's 
lives, will exceed the seven years for which the half-pay is 
already established. Besides this, whatever may be the 
visionary speculations of some men at this time, we shall 
find it indispensable, after the war, to keep on foot a con- 
siderable body of troops ; and all the officers retained for 
this purpose, must be deducted out of the half-pay list. If 
any one will take the pains to calculate the expense on 
these principles, I am persuaded he will find the addition 



HAMILTON. 297 

of expense from the establishment proposed, by no means 
a national object. 

The advantages of securing the attachment of the army 
to congress, and binding them to the service, by substantial 
ties, are immense. 

We should, then, have discipline ; an army in reality, as 
well as in name. Congress would then have a solid basis 
of authority and consequence ; for with me it is an axiom, 
that in our constitution an army is essential to the Ameri- 
can union. 

The providing of supplies, is the pivot of every thing 
else ; (though a well constituted army would not, in a small 
degree, conduce to this, by giving consistency and weight 
to government,) there are four ways, all which must be 
united, a foreign loan, heavy pecuniary taxes, a 
tax in kind, a bank founded on public and private credit. 

As to a foreign loan, I dare say, congress are doing every 
thing in their power to obtain it. The most effectual way 
will be, to tell France that without it, we must make terms 
with Great Britain. This must be done with plainness and 
firmness,but with respect and without petulance ; not as a me- 
nace, but as a candid declaration of our circumstances. We 
need not fear to be deserted by France ; her interest and 
honour are too deeply involved in our fate ; and she can 
make no possible compromise. She can assist us, if she is 
convinced it is absolutely necessary, either by lending us, 
herself, or by becoming our surety, or by influencing Spain. 
It has been to me astonishing, how any man could have 
doubted, at any period of our affairs, of the necessity of a 
foreign loan. It was self-evident that we had not a fund 
of wealth in this country, capable of affording revenues 
equal to the expenses. We must, then, create artificial re- 
venues, or borrow ; the first was done, but it ought to have 
been foreseen, that the expedient could not last, and we 
should have provided in time for its failure. 

VOL. i. 38 



298 THE LIFE OF 

Here was an error of congress. I have good reason to 
believe, that measures were not taken in earnest early 
enough to procure a loan abroad : I give you my honour, 
that from our first outset, I thought as I do now ; and wished 
for a foreign loan, not only because I foresaw it would be 
essential, but because I considered it a tie upon the nation 
from which it was derived, and as a mean to prop our cause 
in Europe. 

Concerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes, I 
need say nothing, as it is a point in which every body is 
agreed; nor is there any danger, that the product of any 
taxes raised in this way, will overburthen the people, or ex- 
ceed the wants of the public. Indeed, if all the paper in 
circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it would 
neither do one nor the other. 

As to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this 
principle, that the money in circulation is not a sufficient 
representative of the productions of the country, and conse- 
quently no revenues raised from it, as a medium, can be 
a competent representative of that part of the products 
of the country, which it is bound to contribute to the support 
of the public. The public, therefore, to obtain its due, or 
satisfy its just demands and its wants, must call for a part 
of these products themselves. This is done in all those 
countries which are not commercial ; in Russia, Prussia, 
Denmark, Sweden, &c., and is peculiarly necessary in our 
case. 

Congress, in calling for specific supplies, seem to have 
had this in view ; but their intention has not been answer- 
ed. The states, in general, have undertaken to furnish the 
supplies by purchase, a mode, as I have observed, at- 
tended with every inconvenience, and subverting the prin- 
ciple on which the supplies were demanded, the insuffi- 
ciency of our circulating medium, as a representative for 
the labour and commodities of the country. It is, there- 



HAMILTON. 299 

fore, necessary, that congress should be more explicit; 
should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and re- 
commend it to the states, as a measure of absolute neces- 
sity. 

The general idea I have of a plan is, that a respectable 
man should be appointed by the state in each county to 
collect the taxes, and form magazines ; that congress should 
have in each state an officer to superintend the whole, and 
that the state collectors should be subordinate and respon- 
sible to them. This continental superintendent might be 
subject to the general direction of the quarter-master-gene- 
ral, or not, as might be deemed best ; but if not subject to 
him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to the 
President at War, who should instruct him what propor- 
tion to deliver to the quarter-master-general. It may be 
necessary, that the superintendents should sometimes have 
power to dispose of the articles in their possession, on pub- 
lic account ; for it would happen, that the contributions, 
in places remote from the army, could not be transported 
to the theatre of operations without too great expense ; in 
which case, it would be eligible to dispose of them, and 
purchase with the money so raised in the counties near the 
immediate scene of war. 

I know the objections which may be raised to this plan, 
its tendency to discourage industry and the like ; but 
necessity calls for it ; we cannot proceed without, and less 
evils must give place to greater. It is, besides, practised 
with success in other countries, and why not in this ? It 
may be said, the examples cited are from nations under 
despotic governments, and that the same would not be 
practicable with us ; but I contend, where the public good 
is evidently the object, more may be effected in govern- 
ments like ours, than in any other. It has been a constant 
remark, that free countries have ever paid the heaviest 
taxes ; the obedience of a free people to general laws, how- 



300 THE LIFE OF 

ever hard they bear, is ever more perfect than that of 
slaves to the arbitrary will of a prince. To this, it may be 
added, that Sweden was always a free government, and 
is so now, in a great degree, notwithstanding the late re- 
volution. 

How far it may be practicable to erect a bank on the faint 
credit of the public, and of individuals, can only be certainly 
determined by the experiment ; but it is of so much import- 
ance that the experiment ought to be fully tried. When I 
gaw the subscriptions going on to the bank established for 
supplying the army, I was in hopes it was only the embryo 
of a more permanent and extensive establishment. But I 
have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not 
seem to be at all conducted on the true principles of a bank. 
The directors of it are purchasing with their stock, instead 
of bank notes as I expected ; in consequence of which, it 
must turn out to be a mere subscription of a particular sum 
of money, for a particular purpose. 

Paper credit never was long supported in any country, 
on a national scale, where it was not founded on the joint 
basis of public and private credit. An attempt to establish 
it on public credit alone, in France, under the auspices of 
Mr. Law, nearly ruined the kingdom. We have seen the 
effects of it in America ; and every successive experiment 
proves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is de- 
preciating almost as fast as the old, though it has, in some 
states, as real funds as paper money ever had. The rea- 
son is, that the moneyed men have not an immediate interest 
to uphold its credit. They may even, in many ways, find 
it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner 
to obtain a permanent paper credit, is to engage the moneyed 
interest immediately in it, by making them contribute the 
whole or part of the stock, and giving them the whole or 
part of the profits. 

The invention of banks, on the modern principle, origina- 



HAMILTON. 301 

ted in Venice. There, the public, and a company of mo- 
neyed men, are mutually concerned. The Eank of England 
unites public authority and faith, with private credit ; and 
hence we see what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised on 
a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would 
never have found sufficient funds to carry on her wars ; but 
with the help of this, she has done, and is doing, wonders. 
The Bank of Amsterdam is on a similar foundation. 

And why cannot we have an American bank ? Are our 
moneyed men less enlightened to their own interest, or less 
enterprising in the pursuit ? I believe the fault is in go- 
vernment, which does not exert itself to engage them in 
such a scheme. It is true, the individuals in America are 
not very rich ; but this would not prevent their instituting 
a bank; it would only prevent its being done with such 
ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient 
confidence in the government, and in the issue of the cause ? 
Let the government endeavour to inspire that confidence, 
by adopting the measures I have recommended, or others 
equivalent to them. Let it exert itself to procure a solid 
confederation, to establish a good plan of executive ad- 
ministration, to form a permanent military force, to ob- 
tain, at all events, a foreign loan. If these things were in 
a train of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring 
to our affairs ; government would recover its respectability, 
and individuals would renounce their diffidence. 

The object I should propose to myself, in the first in- 
stance, from a bank, would be an auxiliary mode of sup- 
plies ; for which purpose contracts should be made between 
government and the bank, on terms liberal and advanta- 
geous to the latter. Every thing should be done, in the first 
instance, to encourage the bank ; after it gets well establish- 
ed, it will take care of itself, and government may make the 
best terms it can for itself. 

The first step to establishing the bank, will be to engage 



302 TIM. LIFE OF 

a number of moneyed men of influence to relish the project, 
and make it a business. The subscribers to that lately es- 
tablished, are the fittest persons that can be found ; and their 
plan may be interwoven. 

The outlines of my plan would be to open subscriptions, 
in all the states, for the stock, which we will suppose to be 
one million of pounds. Real property, of every kind, as 
well as specie, should be deemed good stock ; but at least 
a fourth part of the subscription should be in specie or 
plate. There should be one great company, in three di- 
visions ; in Virginia, Philadelphia, and at Boston ; or two, 
at Philadelphia and Boston. The bank should have a right 
to issue bank notes, bearing two per cent, interest for the 
whole of their stock ; but not to exceed it. These notes 
may be payable every three months, or oftener ; and the 
faith of government must be pledged for the support of the 
bank. It must, therefore, have a right, from time to time, 
to inspect its operations ; and must appoint inspectors for 
the purpose. 

The advantages of the bank may consist in this : in the 
profits of the contracts made with government, which should 
bear interest, to be annually paid in specie ; in the loan of 
money at interest, say six per cent. ; in purchasing lives by 
annuities, as practised in England, &c. The benefit result- 
ing to the company is evident, from the consideration, that 
they may employ in circulation a great deal more money 
than they have specie in stock, on the credit of the real 
property which they will have in other use. This money 
will be employed, either in fulfilling their contracts with 
the public, by which, also, they will gain a profit, or in 
loans, at an advantageous interest, or in annuities. 

The bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion, 
and coin money, allowing government a part of the profit. 

I make the bank notes bear interest, to obtain a readier 
currency, and to induce the holders to prefer them to spe- 



HAMILTON. 303 

cie, to prevent too great a run upon the bank, at any time, 
beyond its ability to pay. 

If government can obtain a foreign loan, it should lend to 
the bank, on easy terms, to extend its influence, and facili- 
tate a compliance with its engagements. If government 
could engage the states to raise a sum of money in specie, 
to be deposited in bank, in the same manner, it would be 
of the greatest consequence. If government could prevail 
on the enthusiasm of the people, to make a contribution in 
plate, for the same purpose, it would be a master stroke. 
Things of this kind sometimes succeed in popular contests; 
and if undertaken with address, I should not despair of its 
success ; but I should not be sanguine. 

The bank may be instituted for a term of years, by way 
of trial ; and the particular privilege of coining money be 
for a term still shorter. 

A temporary transfer of it to a particular company can 
have no inconvenience, as the government are in no condi- 
tion to improve this resource ; nor could it, in our circum- 
stances, be an object to it, though with the industry of a 
knot of individuals, it might be a valuable one to them. 

A bank of this kind, even in its commencement, would 
answer the most valuable purposes to government, and to 
the proprietors ; in its progress, the advantages will exceed 
calculation. It will promote commerce, by furnishing a 
more extensive medium, which we greatly want, in our cir- 
cumstances. I mean a more extensive, valuable medium. 
We have an enormous nominal one at this time ; but it is 
only a name. 

In the present unsettled state of things, in this country, 
we can hardly draw inferences, from what has happened in 
others ; otherwise I should be certain of the success of this 
scheme ; but I think it has enough in its favour to be wor- 
thy of trial. 

I have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects 



304 THE LIFE OF 

I have introduced. Should the plans recommended come 
into contemplation in earnest, and you desire my farther 
thoughts, I will endeavour to give them more form and 
particularity. 

I am persuaded a solid confederation, a permanent ar- 
my, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it, would give us 
treble consideration in Europe, and produce a peace this 
winter. 

If a convention is called, the minds of all the states and 
the people ought to be prepared to receive its determina- 
tions by sensible and popular writings, which should conform 
to the views of congress. There are epochs in human af- 
fairs, when novelty even is useful. If a general opinion 
prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and 
this obstructs or relaxes the operations of the public ser- 
vice, a change is necessary if it be but for the sake of 
change. This is exactly the case now. 'Tis an universal 
sentiment that our present system is a bad one, and that 
things do not go right on this account. The measure of a 
convention would revive the hopes of the people, and give 
a new direction to their passions, which may be improved 
in carrying points of substantial utility. The eastern states 
have already pointed out this mode to congress : they ought 
to take the hint, and anticipate the others. 

And in future, my dear sir, two things let me recommend, 
as fundamental rules for the conduct of congress : to attach 
the army to them by every motive, to maintain an au- 
thority, (not domineering,) in all their measures with the 
states. The manner in which a thing is done, has more in- 
fluence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed 
by opinion : this opinion is as much influenced by appear- 
ances as by realities. If a government appears to be con- 
fident of its own powers, it is the surest way to inspire the 
same confidence in others. If it is diffident, it may be cer- 
tain there will be a still greater diffidence in others, and 



HAMILTON. 305 

that its authority will not only be distrusted, controverted, 
but contemned. 

I wish, too, congress would always consider, that a kind- 
ness consists as much in the manner as in the thing. The best 
things, done hesitatingly, and with an ill grace, lose their 
effect, and produce disgust rather than satisfaction or grati- 
tude. In what congress have at any time done for the army, 
they have commonly been too late. They have seemed to 
yield to importunity, rather than to sentiments of justice, or 
to a regard to the accommodation of their troops. An at- 
tention to this idea is of more importance than it may be 
thought. I, who have seen all the workings and progress 
of the present discontents, am convinced that a want of 
this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes. 

You will perceive, my dear sir, this letter is hastily writ- 
ten, and with a confidential freedom, not as to a member 
of congress, whose feelings may be sore at the prevailing 
clamour ; but as to a friend, who is in a situation to remedy 
public disorders, who wishes for nothing so much as truth, 
and who is desirous for information, even from those less 
capable of judging than himself. I have not even time to 
correct and copy,* and only enough to add, that I am, very 
truly and affectionately, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

Such were the plans which his extensive genius origi- 
nated, to raise this country above all the chances of the revo- 
lution, to give to it a national government, to call out 
all its resources, and to relieve it from that entire depend- 
ence on France, which, though not a native, he felt with all 
a native's pride.

306 TUB LIFE OF 

This feeling is strongly indicated in the following letter 
to congress from head quarters. 

****** We may soon be reduced to the humiliating 
condition of seeing the cause of America, in America, up- 
held by foreign arms. The generosity of our allies has a 
claim to all our confidence and all our gratitude ; but it is 
neither for the honour of America, nor for the interest of 
the common cause, to leave the work entirely to them." 

The measures thus suggested by Hamilton, were before 
the times. His remark, that the people were proof against 
experience, was too true ; and the moment when a govern- 
ment, possessing all the energies necessary for its own pre- 
servation, and all the checks essential to freedom, might 
have been formed, passed away. 

A short time after this subject was brought before con- 
gress, the news of the defeat of Gates, at Camden, was re- 
ceived, and a deeper gloom was spread over the public 
mind, now sadly disappointed in the fond hopes which had 
been indulged, of the benefits to be derived from the co- 
operation of France. Hamilton thus speaks of this event, 
in a letter of the sixth of September, written to a near friend 
in perfect confidence. 

" Most people here are groaning under a very disagree- 
able piece of intelligence, just come from the southward, 
that Gates has had a total defeat near Camden, in South 
Carolina. Cornwallis and he met in the night of the fif- 
teenth, by accident, marching to the same point. The ad- 
vanced guards skirmished, and the two armies halted and 
formed till morning. In the morning a battle ensued, in 
which the militia, and Gates with them, immediately ran 
away, and left the continental troops to contend with the 
enemy's whole force. 

"They did it obstinately, and probably are most of them 
cut off. Gates, however, who writes to congress, seems 
to know very little what has become of his army. He 



HAMILTON. 307 

showed that age, and the long labours and fatigues of a 
military life, had not in the least impaired his activity ; for 
in three days and a half he reached Hillsborough, one hun- 
dred and eighty miles from the scene of action, leaving all 
his troops to take care of themselves, and get out of the 
scrape as well as they could. He has confirmed, in this 
instance, the opinion I always had of him. This event 
will have very serious consequences to the southward. 
People's imaginations have already given up North Caro- 
lina and Virginia ; but I do not believe either of them will 
fall. I am certain Virginia cannot. This misfortune af- 
fects me less than others, because it is not in my temper to 
repine at evils that are past, but to endeavour to draw 
good out of them, and because I think our safety depends 
on a total change of system, and this change of system will 
only be produced by misfortune." 

On being informed of this disaster, congress wisely con- 
fided to Washington the selection of a successor to the un- 
fortunate general. The importance of this trust, was strongly 
felt at head quarters, and though Washington preferred 
Greene, yet when called upon to act under the resolution 
of that body, he duly appreciated the full extent of their 
confidence, and with that slow, but sure discretion, which 
rarely erred, he weighed every circumstance connected with 
the station. Respect for local feelings, might have led him 
to prefer a general officer from the south, had any such been 
deemed equal to this high command ; a regard, also, for the 
prejudices of certain members of congress against Greene, 
and the injurious conduct which had been exhibited to him 
as quarter-master-general, gave rise to a fear that he might 
not receive that support which the scene of his operations 
eminently demanded. These well-grounded reasons for 
hesitation, induced the ardent friendship of Hamilton to ap- 
prehend, lest, in the interval of decision, some circumstance 
might occur to bias the judgement of the commander-in- 



308 THE LIFE OF 

chief, and lose to the country the services of a man, in whose 
superior qualifications he had unmeasured confidence. He 
immediately exerted all his influence to induce an instant 
decision. The other members of the family, in whom the 
character of Greene had inspired similar sentiments, con- 
curred in urging his selection ; and Washington, thus sus- 
tained by his disinterested and most confidential advisers, 
chose a Deliverer for the south, a choice which, under the 
peculiar circumstances which existed, is perhaps among the 
most exalted acts of his life. 

" This choice," says La Fayette, " when made public, was 
generally approved by the army, but not to the high degree 
in which it was afterwards applauded; Congress and the 
country supposed the share of friendship in the choice, 
greater than it had been. Many suspended, or flatly denied 
their approbation, until it was universally acknowledged, 
that in General Greene were united all the abilities and 
virtues which fitted him for this important command." 

A letter from Colonel Harrison, written at this time 
marks the state of opinion in congress on this subject. 

HARRISON TO HAMILTON. 

October 27, 1780. 
MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

We are only leaving Philadelphia. The most flattering 
attentions have been paid to Meade and myself, and such 
as would not permit us to progress before, unless we had 
shown ourselves entirely disregardless of the great world ; 
besides, motives of a public nature concurred to make us 
stay thus long. From all I have seen and heard, there is a 
good disposition in congress to do all they can for the army 
and the public interest, and there are many very sensible 
men among them. In general, they are most warmly at- 
tached to the General, and his recommendations will have 
their weight, while the same spirit prevails. It is said, there 



HAMILTON. 309 

has been infinitely more harmony among them for some time 
past, than has appeared since the first years of their appoint- 
ment. I am not, however, without some apprehension, that 
if they proceed in the case of Lee, &c. the MONSTER (PARTY,) 
may show itself again, and that we may have a second 
edition of the measures adopted in the instance of Deane. 
Our friends Sullivan and Carroll have been of great service; 
and gentlemen who are, or pretend to be, in the secrets of the 
cabinet, say they have contributed immeasurably, by their 
independent conduct, to destroy the EASTERN ALLIANCE. 
Bland is very clever, and without question wishes to push on 
in the true and right road. Grayson says this is the best 
congress we have had since the first. Our dear Laurens 
respects many of the members ; and General Greene's ap- 
pointment, I believe, is entirely consonant to the wishes of 
congress in general, though we have heard there were mem- 
bers much disposed, if facts had not been so obstinate, to 
excuse General Gates. The former is here, and I suppose 
will set out in a day or two ; Meade and I will serve him 
all we can. We have done what we could already. Apro- 
pos, you delivered him my letter. Our finances are entirely 
deranged, and there is little or no money in the treasury. 
1 believe they are a subject of much consideration and puz- 
zlement ; the supplies of the army are also matters of pre- 
sent attention, but I don't know what will be done. I hope 
we shall, by Christmas, have some clothing from the West 
Indies, if the moth have not destroyed it ; a quantity it is 
said has, been lying there. It is much to be wished that 
General Greene were at the south. The delegates from 
that quarter think the situation of Cornwallis delicate, and 
that by management, and a proper application and use of 
the force there, the late check given Ferguson might be im- 
proved into the Earl's total defeat. This, I fear, is too much 
even to hope. The sending the Baron is considered, as far 
as I have heard, perfectly right, and Lee's corps give great 



310 THE LIFE OF 

satisfaction. I am just about to mount my horse, and there- 
fore shall say but little more. Laurens will write unto you 
in a few days, I suppose, and communicate any new occur- 
rences. My love to the lads of the family, the same to 
you. May you be long happy. My most respectful com- 
pliments to the General. 

Most truly and affectionately, 

ROB. H. HARRISON. 

P. S. The Board have been absolutely too poor to pro- 
cure parchment for the many promotions that have been 
required. 

Greene, on the annunciation to him of his appointment, 
by Hamilton, proceeded to head quarters,* and, after an 
interview with Washington, visited Philadelphia, to con- 
cert the measures necessary for the supplies of his army ; 
and having made every exertion to secure the co-operation 
of individuals possessing influence, near the scene of his fu- 
ture operations, arrived at Charlotte, the head quarters of 
the army, on the second of December, where he received 
a letter from Hamilton, directing him to call a court mar- 
tial on Gates, without delay, and give him every facility for 
an immediate defence, who wrote to Congress,-]- com- 
plaining of his not being notified, in due time, of his being 
superseded. The defeat of King's Mountain induced Corn- 
wallis to order a detachment, under Leslie, of three thou- 
sand men, which Clinton had sent on to co-operate in Vir- 
ginia, to join him by the way of Charleston ; and as it was 
advancing in the direction of Camden, Greene moved with 
his main body to the vicinity of the troops under General 
Morgan. 

The situation of the country, and of the army, when 
Greene took the command, is thus described, in a letter 

* October 22d, 1780. t January 3d, 1781. 



HAMILTON. 311 

from him to Colonel Hamilton, written from the camp, at 
the falls of the Pedee. 

GENERAL GREENE TO COLONEL HAMILTON. 

January 10th, 17S1. 
MY DEAR COLONEL, 

General Du Portail being on his way to the northward, 
gives me an opportunity to write you, which I should have 
done before, had not my letters to his excellency contained 
as full information of the state of things as I was able to 
give, from the little time I had been in the department. 

When I was appointed to this command, I expected to 
meet with many new and singular difficulties ; but they in- 
finitely exceed what I apprehended. This is really carry- 
ing on a war in an enemy's country ; for you cannot esta- 
blish the most inconsiderable magazine, or convey the 
smallest quantity of stores from one post to another, with- 
out being obliged to detach guards for their security. The 
division among the people is much greater than I imagined, 
and the whigs and tories persecute each other, with little 
less than savage fury. There is nothing but murders, and 
devastations, in every quarter. 

The loss of our army at Charleston, and the defeat of 
General Gates, has been the cause of keeping such shoals 
of militia on foot, and their service has been accompanied 
with such destruction and loss, as has almost laid waste the 
whole country. Nothing has been more destructive to the 
true interest of this country, than the mode adopted for its 
defence. Two misfortunes happening, one after the other, 
may have rendered it unavoidable the last season ; but 
should it be continued, the inhabitants are inevitably ruined, 
and the resources of the country rendered incapable of af- 
fording support to an army competent to its defence. Go- 
vernment here is infinitely more popular than to the north- 
ward, and there is no such thing as national character or 



312 TH E LIFE OF 

national sentiment. The inhabitants are from all quarters 
of the globe, and as various in their opinions, projects, and 
schemes, as their manners and habits are from their early 
education. Those in office, from a vanity to be thought 
powerful, join in the measure of imposing upon the public 
respecting the strength and resources of these southern 
states ; and while congress, and the minister of France, are 
kept under this fatal delusion, I fear little support will be 
given to this department. The inhabitants are numerous ; 
but they would be rather formidable abroad than at home. 
They are scattered over such a vast extent of country, that 
it is difficult to collect, and still more difficult to subsist 
them. There is a great spirit of enterprise among the back 
people, and those that come out as volunteers are not a lit- 
tle formidable to the enemy. There are, also, some parti- 
cular corps, under Sumpter, Marion, and Clarke, that are 
bold and daring ; the rest of the militia are better calcula- 
ted to destroy provisions than oppose the enemy. 

At Philadelphia, and all my journey through the country, 
I endeavoured to impress upon those in power, the necessi- 
ty of sending clothing, and supplies of every kind, immedi- 
ately to this army. But poverty was urged as a plea, in bar 
to every application. They all promised fair, but I fear 
will do but little : ability is wanting with some, and incli- 
nation with others. 

Public credit is so totally lost, that private people will not 
give their aid, though they see themselves involved in one 
common ruin. It is my opinion, that General Washington's 
influence will do more than all the assemblies upon the con- 
tinent. I always thought him exceeding popular; but in 
many places he is little less than adored, and universally 
admired. His influence in this country might possibly 
effect something great. However, I found myself exceed- 
ingly well received, but more from being the friend of the 
General, than from my own merit.

HAMILTON. 313 

This country wants for its defence a small, but well ap- 
pointed army, organized so as to move with great celerity. 
It should consist of about five thousand infantry, and from 
eight hundred to a thousand horse. The enemy cannot 
maintain a large force in this quarter, neither can we. The 
resources of the country are too small to subsist a large 
body of troops at any one point ; and to draw supplies from 
a distance through such long tracts of barren land, will be 
next to impossible, unless the business can be aided by a 
water transportation, and in cither case, it will be accompa- 
nied with an amazing expense. Could we get a superiority 
of horse, we could soon render it difficult for Lord Corn- 
wallis to hold his position so far in the country. Nor should 
I be under any apprehension with a much inferior force to 
his, of taking post near him, if I had but such a body of 
horse. But the enemy's horse is so much superior to ours, 
that we cannot move a detachment towards them, without 
hazarding its ruin. 

When I came to the army, I found it in a most wretched 
condition. The officers had lost all confidence in the Gene- 
ral, and the troops all their discipline. The troops had not 
only lost their discipline, but they were so addicted to 
plundering, that they were a terror to the country. The 
General and I met at least upon very civil terms; and he 
expressed the greatest happiness at my being appointed to 
succeed him. 

General Smallwood and he were not upon good terms ; 
the former suspected the latter of having an intention to 
supplant him, but many think without reason. Others^ 
again, are of opinion, his suspicions were well founded, and 
that Smallwood was not a little mortified at my being appoint^ 
ed to this department, and got outrageous when he heard 
Baron Steuben was coming also. How the matter was, I 
know not ; certain it is, he is gone home, having refused to 
act under Baron Steuben, and declares he will not serve at

314 THE LIFE OF 

all, unless congress will give him a commission, dated at 
least two years before his appointment. This, I think, can 
never happen, notwithstanding his private merit, and the 
claim of the state. The battle of Camden.here is repre- 
sented widely different from what it is to the northward. 
Colonel Williams thinks that none of the general officers 
were entitled to any extraordinary merit. The action was 
short, and succeeded by a flight, wherein every body took 
care of himself, as well officers as soldiers. Not an offi- 
cer, except Major Anderson, and one or two captains, that 
brought off the field of battle a single soldier. The Colo- 
nel also says, that General Gates would have shared little 
more disgrace, than is the common lot of the unfortunate, 
notwithstanding .he was early off, if he had only halted at 
the Waxhaws or Charlotte ; the first about sixty, and the 
last about eighty miles from the field of battle. What lit- 
tle incidents either give or destroy reputation ? How many 
long hours a man may labour with an honest zeal in his 
country's service, and be disgraced for the most trifling er- 
ror either in conduct or opinion? Hume very justly ob- 
serves, no man will have reputation, unless he is use- 
ful to society, be his merit or abilities what they may. 
Therefore, it is necessary for a man to be fortunate, as well 
as wise and just. The greater part of the loss of the Mary- 
land line, in the action of Camden, happened after they be- 
gan to retreat : indeed,. this was the case with all the troops. 
What gave Smallwood such great reputation, was his halt 
at Salisbury, which was nothing but accident. You know 
there are great parties prevailing in the Maryland line, and 
perhaps his merit is not a little diminished on that account. 
I think him a brave and good officer, but too slow to effect 
any thing great in a department like this, where embarrass- 
ments are without number ; and where nothing can be ef- 
fected without the greatest promptitude and decision. This 
army is in such a w r retched condition, that I hardly know 



A MILTON. 315 

what to do with it. The officers have got such a habit of 
negligence, and the soldiers so loose and disorderly, that it 
is next to impossible to give it a military complexion. 
Without clothing, I am sure I shall never do it. I call no 
councils of war, and I communicate my intentions to very 
few. The army was posted at Charlotte when I came up 
with it, and in a council, it had been determined to winter 
there ; but the difficulty of procuring subsistence, and other 
reasons, induced me not only to take a new position, but to 
make an entire new disposition. All this I effected by a 
single order, having first made the necessary inquiry re- 
specting the new positions, by sending a man to examine the 
grounds and other requisites. If I cannot inspire the army 
with confidence, and respect by an independent conduct, I 
foresee it will be impossible to instil discipline and order 
among the troops. General Leslie has arrived, and joined 
Lord Cornwallis, whose force now is more than three times 
larger than ours ; and we are subsisting ourselves by our 
own industry, and I am not without hopes of forming some- 
thing like a magazine. I am labouring also to get clothing 
from every quarter ; Baron Steuben is in Virginia, and is 
indefatigable in equipping and forwarding the troops from 
that state. I left General Gates in Maryland for the same 
purpose ; but I have got nothing from there yet, nor do I 
expect much for months to come. The North Carolina 
state have such a high opinion of the militia, that I don't 
expect they will ever attempt to raise a single continental 
soldier; notwithstanding the most sensible among them 
will acknowledge the folly of employing militia. 

But I must have tired your patience, and therefore will 
make a full stop concerning matters in this department, 
and inquire how you go on to the northward. \ Have you 
got married ? If you have, please to present my compli- 
ments to Mrs. Hamilton ; if not, to Miss Schuyler, and to 
the General and family in either case. 



316 THE LIFE OF 

I beg my compliments to General Washington's family, 
to General Knox and his family, and all other of my ac- 
quaintances. 

I shall be exceedingly obliged to you if you will commu- 
nicate to me, with great freedom, every thing worthy of 
note that is said or respects this department. 

While the important question of a successor to Gates 
was under consideration, a project was in agitation, partly 
the result of discontent with the feeble measures of con- 
gress, but principally induced by the apprehensions which 
the defeat at Camden had produced, for the appointment 
of " a Supreme Dictator and Vice Dictators in each state, 
with all the powers conferred by the Roman people." 

The difficulty of supplying the armies, and the necessity 
of some general concert, had led to the determination of 
holding a convention at Hartford, to be composed of the 
five New-England states and the state of New-York ; by 
which latter state, Judge Hobart, Egbert Benson, then at- 
torney general, and General Schuyler,were selected as com- 
missioners. It was, for a time, contemplated by the legisla- 
ture, to give them instructions " to propose that a dictator 
should be appointed, for which a majority in the more popu- 
lar branch were believed to be favourable." " This mad pro- 
ject," as Hamilton designated it, was communicated to him 
by General Schuyler, in a letter of the sixteenth of Septem- 
tember, 1780. As soon as Hamilton heard of it, it met 
with his instant disapprobation, and he discouraged it in 
the most earnest manner. General Schuyler, upon w T hom 
this duty would have been imposed, relinquished his purpose 
of attending at Hartford, where the consultations were con- 
fined to the consideration of measures for supplying the 
army, which is stated to have resulted in the project of a 
national impost. Thus do we observe Hamilton, while 
urging the establishment of an efficient government, con- 



HAMILTON. - 317 

fining his views to the distribution of its powers in various 
well-defined departments, securing to each its necessary 
action and reciprocal dependence, the whole emanating 
from, and resting upon, a free and deliberate popular will. 
This project of a dictator was regarded by him as " a 
temporary effusion," but as a strong example of the rea- 
diness with which " the human passions flow from one ex- 
treme to the other." It had a decisive influence on his 
determination to endeavour to give such stability to go- 
vernment as would protect the people from the danger 
which sudden emergencies might produce, of conferring 
extraordinary powers on its head, and of rendering neces- 
sary and palatable, expedients which would lead from tem- 
porary to permanent usurpations.* 

About the time of General Greene's departure for the 
south, a plan of an attack upon the British troops, then on 
Staten Island, was in contemplation, which had originated 
with Hamilton, and in which it was arranged that La Fay- 
ette was to command. In a letter from him to Colonel 
Hamilton, calculations of the means necessary to ensure 
success are presented, and at the same time a project of a 
different nature is adverted to, in which Hamilton was to 
have a share. After some consideration, it was determined 
that the intended attempt on Staten Island should be a feint, 
and that while the British forces were drawn off into New- 
Jersey, a descent should be made upon New-York. Ha- 
milton, tired of inactivity, and anxious to signalize himself, 
became intent on obtaining a separate command, in which 
he hoped to succeed, aided by the influence of the Marquis. 
In order to give a more full exposition of his wishes, he ad- 
dressed to General Washington the following letter. 

* This scheme of a dictator, never ripened into a deliberate and extensive 
plan. It was strongly opposed by Governor Clinton, to whose exertions, on 
this occasion, great respect is due. 



318 THE LIFE OF 



HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 

November 22d, 1780. 
DEAR SIR, 

Some time last fall, when I spoke to your excellency about 
going to the southward, I explained to you candidly my 
feelings with respect to military reputation, and how much 
it was my object to act a conspicuous part in some enter- 
prise, that might perhaps raise my character as a soldier 
above mediocrity. You were so good as to say, you would 
be glad to furnish me with an occasion. When the expe- 
dition to Staten Island was afoot, a favourable one seemed 
to offer. There was a battalion without a field officer, the 
command of which, I thought, as it was accidental, might 
be given to me without inconvenience. I made an appli- 
cation for it through the Marquis, who informed me of your 
refusal on two principles, one, that the giving me a whole 
battalion might be a subject of dissatisfaction ; the other, 
that if any accident should happen to me in the present state 
of your family, you would be embarrassed for the necessa- 
ry assistance. 

The project. you now have in contemplation affords an- 
other opportunity. I have p. variety of reasons, that press 
me to desire ardently to have it in my power to improve it. 
I take the liberty to observe, that the command may now 
be proportioned to my rank, and that the second objection 
ceases to operate, as during the period of establishing our 
winter quarters, there will be a suspension of material busi- 
ness ; besides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, 
call me away from the army in a few days, and Mr. Har- 
rison may be expected back early next month. My com- 
mand may consist of one hundred and fifty or two hundred 
men, composed of fifty men of Major Gibbes' corps, fifty 
from Colonel Meigs' regiment, and fifty or an hundred more 
from the light infantry, Major Gibbes to be my major. 



HAMILTON. 319 

The hundred men from here may move on Friday morning 

towards , which will strengthen the appearances for 

Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side of the 
Passaic; 

I suggest this mode, to avoid the complaints that might 
arise from composing my party wholly of the light infantry, 
which might give umbrage to the officers of that corps, who 
on this plan can have no just subject for it. 

The primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to at- 
tempt with my detachment Byard's Hill. Should we ar- 
rive early enough to undertake it, I should prefer It to any 
thing else, both for the brilliancy of the attempt in itself, and 
the decisive consequences of which its success would be pro- 
ductive. If we arrive too late to make this eligible, (as 
there is reason to apprehend,) my corps may form the van 
of one of the other attacks, and Byard's Hill will be a pre- 
text for my being employed in the affair, on a supposition of 
my knowing the ground, Which is partly true. I flatter 
myself, also, that my military character stands so well in 
the army, as to reconcile the officers in general to the mea- 
sure. All circumstances considered, I venture to say any 
exceptions which might be taken, would be unreasonable. 

I take this method of making the request to avoid the 
embarrassment of a personal explanation. I shall only add, 
that however much I have the matter at heart, I wish your 
excellency entirely to consult your own inclination, and not 
from a disposition to oblige me, to do any thing that may be 
disagreeable to you. It will, nevertheless, make me singu- 
larly happy if your wishes correspond with mine. 

This negotiation was entrusted to La Fayette, whose de- 
sire to advance the views of his friend, are thus strongly 
expressed in the following letters. 



320 THE LIFE OF 

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Paramus, November 28, 1780. 
DEAR HAMILTON, 

Here I arrived last night, and am going to set out for 
Philadelphia. Gouvion goes straight to New- Windsor, and 
by him I write to the General. I speak of Hand and Smith, 
whom I recommend, and add, If, however, you was to 
ca'st your eye on a man who, I think, would suit better than 
any other in the world, Hamilton is, I confess, the officer 
whom I would like best to see in my *****. Then I go 
on with the idea, that at equal advantages, you deserve from 
him the preference ; that your advantages are the greatest ; 
I speak of a co-operation ; of your being in the family ; and 
conclude, that on every public and private account, I advise 
him to take you. 

I know the General's friendship and gratitude for you, 
my dear Hamilton ; both are greater than you perhaps ima- 
gine. I am sure he needs only to be told that something 
will suit you, and when he thinks he can do it, he certainly 
will. Before this campaign I was your friend, and very 
intimate friend, agreeable to the ideas of the world ; since 
my second voyage, my sentiment has increased to such a 
point, the world knows nothing about. To show both, from 
want and from scorn of expressions, I shall only tell you 
adieu. 

Yours, 

LA FAYETTE. 

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Philadelphia, December 9th, 1780. 
DEAR HAMILTON, 

On my arrival at Paramus, I wrote a letter to the Gene- 
ral, which Colonel Gouvion was to deliver to himself at 
New- Windsor; so that more expedition had been made than 
you had thought. But the General having unfortunately 



HAMILTON. 321 

altered his mind, and taken the road to Morristown, another 
misfortune threw Hand in his way, and remembering your 
advices on the occasion, he hastened to make him the pro- 
position, and in consequence of it wrote his letter to con- 
gress. From Paramus I went myself to the Lots, and from 
thence to Morristown, where I met the General, and know- 
ing that my letter could not reach him under some days, I 
became regardless of your wishes, and made a verbal ap- 
plication in my own name, and about the same time that had 
been settled between us. I can't express to you, my dear 
friend, how sorry and disappointed I felt, when I knew from 
him, the General, that (greatly in consequence of your ad- 
vice,) he had settled the whole matter with Hand, and writ- 
ten for him to congress. I confess, I became warmer on 
the occasion than you would perhaps have wished me to 
be, and I wanted the General to allow my sending an ex- 
press, who would have overtaken the letter, as it was in the 
hands of General St. Clair ; but the General did not think 
it to be a convenient measure, and, I confess, I may have 
been a little blinded on its propriety. I took care not to 
compromise you in this affair, when the General expressed 
a desire to serve you, and in a manner you would have been 
satisfied with. Now for the voyage to France. 

Congress seem resolved that an Envoy be sent in the way 
you wish, and this was yesterday determined in the house. 
Next Monday the gentleman will be elected. I have already 
spoken to many members ; I know of a number of voices 
that will be for you. This day and that of to-morrow will 
be by me employed in paying visits. As soon as the busi- 
ness is fixed upon, I shall send you an express; I think 
you ought to hold yourself in readiness, and in case you are 
called for, come with all possible speed ; for you must go 
immediately, that you may have returned before the begin- 
ning of operations. If you go, my dear sir, I shall give you 
all public or private knowledge about Europe I am possess-

ed of. Besides many private letters, that may introduce 
you to my friends, I intend giving you the key of the cabi- 
net, as well as of the societies which influence them. In a 
word, my good friend, any thing in my power shall be en- 
tirely yours. 

The earnest desire, evinced by this letter, that Hamilton 
should proceed to the Court of France, was a common sen- 
timent among the foreign officers, with whom he was the 
medium of communication, and who anticipated, with the 
most sanguine hopes, the benefits of his appointment. 

During the progress of these interesting occurrences, 
Hamilton formed an engagement with the second daughter 
of General Schuyler, to whom he was married on the four- 
teenth of December, 1780, at the residence of her father in 
Albany, and thus became permanently established in the 
state of New- York. 



HAMILTON. 323 



CHAPTER XIII, 

[1781.] 

THE privations endured by the army had, at the com- 
mencement of this year, produced a general and serious 
discontent, which first showed itself in a mutiny of the 
Pennsylvania line, stationed at Morristown. Disregarding 
the efforts of their officers, and insensible even to the popu- 
larity of their commander, General Wayne, they abandon- 
ed their quarters, and marched to the vicinity of Trenton, 
determined to exact relief from the civil authorities, who 
were obliged to comply with their demands. Within a 
short time after, a similar spirit manifested itself in a part 
of the Jersey line ; on the intelligence of which General 
Washington wrote* to congress, stating his determination 
"to quiet them by force," and Hamilton, by his instruc- 
tions, directed Colonel Barber " to compel them to uncon- 
ditional submission," by whose prompt and vigorous mea- 
sures they were restored to obedience. 

The mutineers were invited, by every inducement that Sir 
Henry Clinton could offer, to join him ; but the soldiers, with 
indignant patriotism, rejected the temptation, and seized 
and delivered up his emissaries, who were executed on the 
succeeding day. Congress, cherishing this patriotic feel- 
ing, on the representation of Washington, sent them three 
month's pay in specie. This small aid, though inadequate 
to their wants, restored them to the belief that the poverty, 
and not the remissness of the government, had produced 
their sufferings. 

On the sixteenth of January, Colonel Hamilton, whose 

* January 23, 1781. 



1 11 U LIFE OF 

correspondence with General Schuyler became frequent, 
wrote to him, informing him of these events, and declining 
a very liberal offer of pecuniary aid. On the twenty-fifth 
he received the following reply : 

DEAR SIR, 

Yesterday I received your favour of the sixteenth in- 
stant. It affords me pleasure to learn that the Pennsylva- 
nia line is reduced to order ; but we, in this quarter, are 
on the point of experiencing a similar commotion. The 
two regiments threaten to march to head quarters, unless 
some money is paid them ; the certificates for the depre- 
ciation expedited, and in future to be supplied with provi- 
sions. 

Yesterday about three thousand bushels of wheat, six 
hundred pound's worth of beef, and three or four thousand 
dollars, were subscribed. I am in hopes we shall procure 
what will afford each man about ten dollars, and I have 
some hopes that this, with a little management, will render 
them tolerably quiet.* 

You cannot, my dear sir, be more happy at the connex- 
ion you have made with my family, than I am. Until the 
child of a parent has made a judicious choice, his heart is 
in continual anxiety ; but this anxiety was removed on the 
moment I discovered it was you on whom she had placed 
her affections. I am pleased with every instance of deli- 
cacy in those who are so dear to me ; and I think I read 
your soul on the occasion you mention. I shall, therefore, 

* Governor Trambull stated that the Connecticut soldiers, whose terms of 
enlistment had expired, had repaired, in large numbers, to the seaports, in or- 
der to engage themselves in privateering ; that an embargo had been laid for 
the purpose of filling their battalion; and unless Massachusetts and Rhode- 
Island acted in concert, her soldiers would repair to their ports with the same 
intent ; and therefore Connecticut requested those states to lay and continue 
embargoes for the same purpose. 



HAMILTON. 325 

only entreat you to consider me as one who wishes, in 
every way, to promote your happiness ; and. I shall never 
give or lend but with a view to such ends. Entreat the 
General and his lady to accept my best wishes. Do not 
forget to remember me to Harrison and Tilghman. 
Adieu, dear sir, 

Most affectionately, 
Yours, &c. 

PlI. SCHUYLER. 

Col. Hamilton. ' . 

In the preceding year, Hamilton, seeing the constant 
danger of the dissolution of the army for want of supplies, 
projected a plan for that purpose, which he anxiously press- 
ed upon congress. The recent occurrences had increased 
his solicitude to have it brought forward, and he again re- 
called the attention of General Schuyler to this subject, in 
reference to which he received a letter of the fifth of Feb- 
ruary, 1781. 

" The reward refused by the Pennsylvania line, evinces 
a becoming sense of propriety and gallantry. What might 
not our soldiery be brought to, if properly fed, paid, and 
clothed ? 

" The plan you mention for supplying the armies in Ame- 
rica, I should be exceedingly happy to see attempted ; but 
I fear congress will not venture on it, although they should 
be convinced of its eligibility. In the course of the last year, 
I proposed it repeatedly to individual members, who gene- 
rally approved, and once or twice took occasion to mention 
it in congress. 

" I am persuaded, if it was adopted, that a saving, at pre- 
sent almost inconceivable, would be induced, and an order 
and economy in the public expenditures, whilst it would 
reconcile the minds of men to bear the public burthens with 
alacrity, would effectually eradicate the fears which too ge- 



326 THE LIFE OF 

nerally prevail, that we shall sink under the enormous weight 
of our expenses. I have been a committee of the senate to 
prepare a letter to congress. It will go by this conveyance. 
I shall not detail the subject of it, as a copy of it is directed 
to be sent to the General. I have written for some refuse 
clothing for the Indians. Permit me to entreat your in- 
terposition, to procure some carriages for the transporta- 
tion of them. Very affectionately, and very proudly, 
" Your obedient, humble servant, 

"PH. SCHUYLER." 

Colonel Hamilton. 

These instances of insubordination hastened the depart- 
ure of the special envoy, whom congress had chosen to 
proceed to France. The interesting letter of Colonel Lau- 
rens to Hamilton of the eighteenth December, 1779, will be 
recollected ; in which the appointment of the latter, as se- 
cretary to the minister at Versailles, is mentioned as having 
been strongly urged by him. Within a short time after its 
date, intelligence was received, that his father, Henry Lau- 
rens, who had been appointed a commissioner to negotiate 
a treaty with the United Provinces, had been captured on 
his voyage, and was immured in the Tower. 

This wanton act of severity had excited no less sensa- 
tion in Europe than in America, and brought out, in a 
bolder light, the character of this distinguished personage, 
recently the President of the American Congress, now a 
prisoner of state. 

The appointment of an envoy had been deferred until the 
latter part of the preceding year. The necessity of a loan, 
which had been so strongly urged by Hamilton, had led him 
to advise another visit to France by La Fayette, whose in- 
fluence had been increased by a recent change in the minis- 
try, and the idea was entertained, that Hamilton might be 
associated with him, in this interesting mission. But the 
prospect of active service in the south, had greater charms 



HAMILTON. 327 

for the Marquis, and it was determined, that a member of 
Washington's family should be appointed in his stead. 

The choice was between the two friends, Laurens and 
Hamilton. The idea of the mission having originated with 
Hamilton, induced Laurens to defer to him an appointment, 
which the dull prospects of the army, his sense of the im- 
portance of an energetic negotiation, and the high distinc- 
tion, rendered an object of desire. On the other hand, the 
news of the capture of his father, would naturally inspire 
his son with a wish to seize this opportunity of obtaining his 
release. Hamilton immediately relinquished his preten- 
sions ; but the warmth of Laurens' friendship triumphed 
over his filial feelings, and he urged the consent of Hamil- 
ton, with an avowal, that he would prefer confiding to him 
the fate of his father. A scene of generous contention en- 
sued, mutually honourable, and characteristic. Hamilton 
prevailed ; and on the eleventh of December, Laurens, 
having signified his assent to congress, was unanimously 
elected. 

The importance of giving a correct view of the state of 
affairs at this juncture, suggested to Hamilton the idea of a 
special letter of instructions, in addition to that which had 
been given to the envoy by congress, being addressed to him 
by General Washington, which, in the opinion of La Fay- 
ette, it was supposed would add additional weight to his 
representations. This important duty was delegated to 
Hamilton by Washington, and will be read with interest, as 
containing a full exposition of the resources and situation of 
the country at that critical juncture. 

WASHINGTON TO LAURENS. 

"In compliance with your request, I shall commit to 
writing the result of our conferences on the present state of 
American affairs ; in which I have given you my opinion 
with that freedom and explicitness, which the objects of 



328 



THE LIFE OF 



your commission, my entire confidence in you, and the exi- 
gency of our affairs demand. 

" 1st. To me it appears evident, that, considering the dif- 
fused population of these states, the consequent difficulty of 
drawing together their resources, the composition and tem- 
per of a part of their inhabitants, the want of a sufficient 
stock of national wealth, as a basis for revenue, and the al- 
most total extinction of commerce, the efforts that we have 
been compelled to make for carrying on the war, have ex- 
ceeded the natural abilities of this country, and, by degrees, 
brought us to a crisis that makes the most efficacious and 
immediate succour from abroad indispensable to our safety. 

" 2d. That notwithstanding, from the confusion insepara- 
ble from a revolution ; from our having governments to 
frame, and every species of civil and military institutions to 
create ; from that inexperience in affairs necessarily inci- 
dent to a nation in its commencement, some errors may 
have been committed in the administration of our finances, 
to which a part of our embarrassments may be attributed ; 
yet they are principally to be ascribed to an essential de- 
fect of means, the want of a sufficient stock of wealth, as 
mentioned in the first article, which want, continuing to 
operate, will make it impossible, by any interior exertions, 
to extricate ourselves from those embarrassments, restore 
the public credit, and furnish the requisite funds for cany- 
ing on the war. 

" 3d. That experience has demonstrated it to be impossi- 
ble long to support a paper credit without funds for its re- 
demption ; that the depreciation of our currency \vas in 
the main a necessary effect of the want of those funds ; 
and that its restoration is impossible for the same reason, 
to which the general diffidence which has taken place 
among the people is an additional, and, in the present state 
of things, an insuperable obstacle. 

" 4th. That the mode which for want of money has been 



HAMILTON. 329 

substituted for supplying the army, by assessing a portion 
of the productions of the earth, has hitherto been found to be 
ineffectual ; has frequently left the army to experience the 
most calamitous distress, and from its novelty and incom- 
patibility with ancient habits is regarded by the people as 
burthensome and oppressive ; has excited serious discon- 
tents, and in some states there appear alarming symptoms 
of opposition. That this mode has, besides, many particu- 
lar inconveniences, which contribute to make it inadequate 
to our exigencies, and ineligible but as an auxiliary. 

" 5th. That the resource of domestic loans is inconsidera- 
ble ; .because there are, properly speaking, few moneyed 
men in this country, and the few there are, can employ 
their money to more advantage otherwise ; besides which, 
the instability of our currency, and the want of funds, have 
impaired the public credit. That from the best estimates 
of the annual expense of the war, and the annual revenues 
which these states are capable of producing, there is a large 
balance to be made up by public credit. 

" 6th. That the patience of the army, from an almost un- 
interrupted series of complicated distress, is now nearly 
exhausted ; their discontents are matured to an extremity 
which has recently had the most disagreeable consequen- 
ces, and demonstrates the absolute necessity of speedy re- 
lief. You are too well acquainted with all their sufferings, 
for want of clothing, for want of subsistence, for want of 
pay. 

" 7th. That the people begin to be dissatisfied with the 
present system for the support of the war ; and there is 
cause to apprehend that evils actually felt in the prosecu- 
tion of it, may weaken those sentiments which, began it, 
founded, not on immediate sufferings, but on a speculative 
apprehension of evils to arise in future from the depriva- 
tion of our liberties. There is danger that a commercial 
and free people, little accustomed to heavy burdens, presa-

330 THE LIFE OF 

ed by impositions of a new and odious kind, may not make 
a proper allowance for the necessity of the conjuncture, 
and may imagine they have only exchanged one tyranny 
for another. 

" 8th. That from all the foregoing considerations results, 
first, the absolute necessity of an immediate, ample, and 
efficacious succour of money, considerable enough to be a 
foundation for permanent arrangements of finance ; to re- 
store the public credit, and give new life and activity to 
our future operations. Secondly, the vast importance of a 
decided effort of the allied arms upon this country the en- 
suing campaign, to give a fatal blow to the power of the 
enemy, and secure the great objects of the war, the liber- 
ty and independence of these states. Without the first, we 
may make a feeble and expiring effort the next campaign, 
which would, in all probability, be the period of our oppo- 
sition. With it, we should be in a condition to continue 
the war as long as the obstinacy of the enemy might re- 
quire. The first is essential to the last : both combined, 
would at once bring the contest to a glorious issue ; put 
the objects of the alliance out of the reach of contingen- 
cies ; crown the obligations which America already feels 
to the magnanimity and generosity of her allies, and per- 
petuate the union by those ties of gratitude and affection, 
as well as mutual advantage, which alone can render it so- 
lid and indissoluble. 

" 9th. That next to a loan of money, a constant naval su- 
periority on these coasts, is the object which most interests 
us. This would instantly reduce the enemy to a difficult 
defensive, and by depriving them of all prospect of extend- 
ing their acquisitions, would take away the motives for 
prosecuting the war. Indeed, it is not easy to conceive, 
how they could subsist a large force in this country, if we 
had the command of the seas to interrupt the regular trans- 
mission of supplies from Europe. This superiority (with 



HAMILTON. 331 

an aid of money) would enable us to convert the operations 
of the war into a vigorous offensive. I say nothing of the 
advantages to our trade, nor how infinitely it would facili- 
tate our supplies. In short, it seems to be a deciding point. 
It appears, too, to be the interest of our allies, abstract- 
ed from the immediate benefits to this country, to transfer 
the whole naval war to America. The number of ports 
friendly to them and hostile to the British ; the materials 
this country affords for repairing the disabled ships ; the 
large quantities of provisions towards the subsistence of 
the fleet ; are circumstances which would give a palpable 
advantage to our allies in a naval contest in these seas. 

" That notwithstanding the embarrassments under which 
we labour, and the inquietudes prevailing among the peo- 
ple, there is still a fund of inclination and resources in this 
country, equal to great and continued exertions ; provided 
we have it in our power to stop the progress of disgust, by 
changing the present system, by restoring public credit, 
and by giving activity to our measures ; of all which, a 
powerful succour of money might be the basis. The peo- 
ple are dissatisfied ; but it is with the feeble and oppressive 
mode of conducting the war, not with the war itself. They 
are not unwilling to contribute to its support, but they are 
unwilling to do it in a way that renders private property 
precarious, a necessary consequence of the fluctuation of 
the national currency, and of the inability of government 
to perform its engagements coercively made. A large ma- 
jority are still firmly attached to its independence ; abhor a 
re-union with Great Britain ; and are affectionate to the 
alliance with France : but this disposition cannot supply the 
place of the means essential in war, nor can we rely on its 
continuance amid the perplexities, oppressions, and misfor- 
tunes that attend the want of them. 

" That no nation will have it more in its power to repay 
what it may borrow than this. Our debts are small ; the 



832 THE LIFE OF 

immense tracts of unlocated lands ; the variety and fertili- 
ty of soils ; the advantages of every kind which we possess 
for commerce, insure to this country a rapid progress in 
population and prosperity, and a certainty, its independ- 
ence being established, of reducing, in a short term of years, 
the comparatively inconsiderable debts we may have occa- 
sion to contract. 

" If the foregoing observations will be of any use to you, 
I shall be happy. I wish you a safe and pleasant voyage, 
the full accomplishment of your mission, and a speedy re- 
turn ; - being, with sentiments of perfect friendship, regard, 
and affection, dear sir,

Colonel Laurens sailed from the United States in the 
Alliance frigate, on the sixteenth of February, accompanied 
by Major Jackson, an officer of distinguished gallantry, 
whose important services during the mission, called forth 
his repeated and warmest acknowledgements. 

Hamilton had now been in the family of the commander- 
in-chief near four years, and the extent of his services has 
been partly shown. This connexion, under circumstances 
of such interest, terminated within a few days after the de- 
parture of Laurens. It will be seen, that it was the desire 

It will be observed, by a comparison of this document with that inserted 
in the diplomatic correspondence, that there is a difference in the disposition of 
the parts of these instructions, and that the copy given to Laurens was fuller. 
The difference is not, however, important. The above is copied from the first 
draft, in Hamilton's autograph, with the exception of the four closing lines, 
which are added in the handwriting of Washington. Colonel Hamilton, also, 
a short time after, drew up a general view of the classification of crimes, and 
the apportionment of punishments, to be adopted in the army ; condemning 
the arbitrary punishments which a defective system had produced, and also 
making a very important suggestion as to the terms and forms of discharges 
to be granted to the soldiers, both as a reward of merit, and a prevention oi 
desertion,

of both parties that the breach which had occurred should 
be concealed ; but their relations were too conspicuous to 
admit of it, and when it became known, the circumstances 
were variously related, and the facts distorted. 

The erroneous statements which have been made on this 
subject, render necessary the publication of parts of a let- 
ter to General Schuyler, written by Hamilton, with the 
minutest accuracy, within two days after the occurrence, 
as a vindication of his conduct, in this, one of the most try- 
ing moments of his early life. 

Head Quarters, New- Windsor, February 18th, 1781. 
MY DEAR SIR, 

Since I had the pleasure of writing you last, an unex- 
pected change has taken place in my situation. I am no 
longer a member of the General's family. This informa- 
tion will surprise you, and the manner of the change will 
surprise you more. Two days ago, the General and I 
passed each other on the stairs ; he told me he wanted 
to speak to me, I answered that I would wait upon him 
immediately. I went below, and delivered Mr. Tilghman 
a letter to be sent to the commissary, containing an order 
of a pressing and interesting nature. 

Returning to the General, I was stopped on the way by 
the Marquis de La Fayette, and we conversed together 
about a minute on a matter of business. He can testify 
how impatient I was to get back, and that I left him in a 
manner which, but for our intimacy, would have been more 
than abrupt. Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in 
his room, I met him at the head of the stairs, where accost- 
ing me in an angry tone, " Colonel Hamilton, (said he,) 
you have kept me waiting at the head of the stairs these 
ten minutes ; I must tell you, sir, you treat me with dis- 
respect." I replied, without petulancy, but with decision, 
" I ain not conscious of it, sir, but since you have thought 



334 THE LIFE OF 

it necessary to tell me so, we part." " Very well, sir, (said 
he,) if it be your choice," or something to this effect, and we 
separated. I sincerely believe my absence, which gave so 
much umbrage, did not last two minutes. 

In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to me in the 
General's name, assuring me of his great confidence in my 
abilities, integrity, usefulness, &c., and of his desire, in a 
candid conversation, to heal a difference which could not 
have happened but in a moment of passion. I requested 
Mr. Tilghman to tell him, 1st. That I had taken my reso- 
lution in a manner not to be revoked. 2d. That as a con- 
versation could serve no other purpose than to produce ex- 
planations, mutually disagreeable, though I certainly would 
not refuse an interview, if he desired it, yet I would be hap- 
py, if he would permit me to decline it. 3d. That though 
determined to leave the family, the same principles which 
had kept me so long in it, would continue to direct my con- 
duct towards him when out of it. 4th. That, however, I 
did not wish to distress him, or the public business, by quit- 
ting him before he could derive other assistance by the re- 
turn of some of the gentlemen who were absent. 5th. And 
that in the mean time, it depended on him, to let our beha- 
viour to each other be the same as if nothing had happen- 
ed. He consented to decline the conversation, and thanked 
me for my offer of continuing my aid in the manner I had 
mentioned. 

I have given you so particular a detail of our difference, 
from the desire I have to justify myself in your opinion. 
Perhaps you may think I was precipitate in rejecting the 
overture made by the General to an accommodation. I 
assure you, my dear sir, it was not the effect of resentment ; 
it was the deliberate result of maxims I had long formed 
for the government of my own conduct. 

I always disliked the office of an aid-de-camp, as having 
in it a kind of personal dependence. I refused to serve in 



HAMILTON. 335 

this capacity with two Major Generals, at an early period 
of the war. Infected, however, with the enthusiasm of the 
times, an idea of the General's character overcame my 
scruples, and induced me to accept his invitation to enter 
into his family * * *. I(. has been often with great difficul- 
ty that I have prevailed upon myself not to renounce it ; 
but while, from motives of public utility, I was doing vio- 
lence to my feelings, I was always determined, if there 
should ever happen a breach between us, never to consent 
to an accommodation. I was persuaded, that when once 
that nice barrier, which marked the boundaries of what we 
owed to each other, should be thrown down, it might be 
propped again, but could never be restored. 

The General is a very honest man ; his competitors 
have slender abilities, and less integrity. His popularity 
has often been essential to the safety of America, and is 
still of great importance to it. These considerations have 
influenced my past conduct respecting him, and will influ- 
ence my future ; I think it is necessary he should be 
supported. 

His estimation in your mind, whatever maybe its amount, 
I am persuaded has been formed on principles, which a 
circumstance like this cannot materially affect ; but if I 
thought it could diminish your friendship for him, I should 
almost forego the motives that urge me to justify myself to 
you. I wish what I have said to make no other impres- 
sion, than to satisfy you I have not been in the wrong. It 
is also said in confidence, as a public knowledge of the 
breach would, in many ways, have an ill effect. It will, 
probably, be the policy of both sides to conceal it, and co- 
ver the separation with some plausible pretext. I am im- 
portuned by such of my friends as are privy to the affair, to 
listen to a reconciliation ; but my resolution is unalterable. 

As I cannot think of quitting the army during the war, I 
have a project of re-entering into the artillery, by taking 



THE LIFE OF 

Lieutenant Colonel Forrest's place, who is desirous of re- 
tiring on half-pay. I have not, however, made up my mind 
upon this head, as I should be obliged to come in the 
youngest lieutenant colonel instead of the eldest, which 
I ought to have been by natural succession, had I remained 
in the corps; and, at the same time, to resume studies re- 
lative to the profession, which to avoid inferiority, must be 
laborious. 

If a handsome command in the campaign in the light in- 
fantry should offer itself, I shall balance between this and 
the artillery. My situation in the latter would be more 
solid and permanent ; but as I ^hope the war will not last 
long enough to make it progressive, this consideration has 
the less force. A command for the campaign, would leave 
me the winter to prosecute studies relative to my future 
career in life * * *. I have written to you on this subject 
with all the freedom and confidence to which you have a 
right, and with an assurance of the interest you take in all 
that concerns me. 

Very sincerely and affectionately, 
I am, dear sir, 

Your most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

While giving this representation of an event attended 
with circumstances of so much delicacy, it is gratifying to 
remark, that an incident, which, in other individuals, might 
have tended to lessen our respect, either for one or both of 
the parties, serves only to add to our higher estimation of 
each. , 

Washington, to whom all the world was offering incense, 
betrayed into the indulgence of a momentary error of tem- 
per, makes an advance to conciliation with the friend whose 
feelings he had injured ; while Hamilton, with a high sense 
of character, and a strong self-reliance, relinquishes a situa- 



HAMILTON. 337 

tion, the object of ambition to many a gallant soldier, and 
of which the marked confidence of Washington had in- 
creased the importance, to re-enter the line of the army, 
with a doubtful prospect of employment, and possibly the 
object of hostility to the wounded pride of its chief, and 
that chief the man whom his country adored. 

But the result of his decision demonstrated its wisdom. 
Losing none of the confidence and respect of Washington, 
he continued, though unconnected with him by any imme- 
diate military relation, to aid him with his counsel on vari- 
ous occasions, until they are seen again, drawn together by 
mutual regard to the public interests, to the closest and 
most intimate connexion, which terminated only with their 
lives. 

From the moment Hamilton's separation from the family 
of Washington was known, such was his standing in the 
army, that the occurrence was generally regretted. Let- 
ters were addressed to him, expressive ,of the warmest at- 
tachment, which, though felt by many, was by none more 
strongly shown, than by the officers of France, who evinced 
the deepest interest in his welfare. His high place in the 
confidence of the commander, gave him an influence in 
rendering those kindnesses which the situation of foreigners 
peculiarly required ; and his readiness, on all occasions, to 
promote their wishes, led them to regret his leaving head 
quarters, as an event by which they had lost a friend, on 
whose affection they could repose every reliance. 

Considerations of mere gratitude or interest were not 
alone in recommending him to their regard. In the situa- 
tion of the country, few of its young soldiers had enjoyed 
those advantages, which enabled them to enter into the 
gayeties of French manners, and to give zest to a society, 
of which the usages were so unlike those then prevailing in 
America. His command of their language, a natural turn 
for pleasantry, a happy facility in adapting himself to the 

VOL. I. 43 



338 THE LIF OF 

character of his associates, a freedom from those prejudi- 
ces above which persons of the most distinguished merit 
do not always rise, and his warmth of heart, and romantic 
temper, rendered him a welcome inmate to their conviviali- 
ties, and gave him the first place among the American offi- 
cers in their affections. 

La Fayette, his early, his constant, his illustrious friend, 
as he had been privy to many of the most confidential inci- 
dents of Washington's life, and was aware of the import- 
ance of Hamilton's services, seemed most to have regretted 
it, and with the same warmth which he had shown in en- 
deavouring to promote Hamilton's wishes on former occa- 
sions, now sought to produce a reconciliation ; but, as he 
says, " when, after having explained the delay privately, he 
expressed to each of them his own feelings, he found each 
disposed to believe the other was not sorry for the separa- 
tion. It did not, however, go farther than leaving the fami- 
ly ; the advice of Hamilton has since, in several circum- 
stances, been friendly asked by the commander-in-chief." 

The following letters addressed to him, a short time after 
this event, are indicative of the feelings which were enter- 
tained towards him. 

LA FAYETTE TO HAMILTON. 

Elk, April 10th, 1781. 

Where is, for the present, my dear Hamilton ? This 
question is not a mere affair of curiosity. It is not even 
wholly owing to the tender sentiments of my friendship. 
But motives, both of a public and private nature, conspire 
in making me wish that your wo be not accomplished. 
Perhaps you are at head quarters, perhaps at Albany ; at 
all events, I'll tell you my history. 

Had the French fleet come in, Arnold was ours. The 
more certain it was, the greater my disappointment has 
been ; at last it has become necessary for them to return 
to Rhode-Island. I think they have exerted themselves for 



HAMILTON. 339 

the common good, and this has been a comfort in our mis- 
fortune. Having luckily arrived at Elk by water, which 
at first I had no right to expect, I have received the Ge- 
neral's letter. If you are at head quarters, you will have 
seen my correspondence with the General ; if not, I tell you 
that I am ordered to the southern army, and the General 
thinks that the army under his immediate command will 
remain inactive. After a march of forty days, we will ar- 
rive at a time when the heat of the season will put an end 
to operations. This detachment is so circumstanced, as to 
make it very inconvenient for officers and men to proceed. 
Before we arrive, we shall perhaps be reduced to five or 
six hundred men. 

There will be no light infantry formed, no attack 
against New- York, none of those things which had flat- 
tered my mind. 

If a corps is sent to the southward by land, it ought to 
have been the Jersey line, because if we weaken ourselves, 
New- York will be out of the question. 

Monsieur Destouches will, I think, propose to the Gene- 
ral to send to Philadelphia 1'Eveille, and all the frigates ; 
these, with the frigates now at Philadelphia, would carry 
fifteen hundred men to whatever part of the continent the 
General would think proper. We could then go to Mor- 
ristown, there to form a new corps of light infantry upon 
the principles at first intended, and embarking in the first 
days of May, we could be at Wilmington, Georgetown, or 
any where else, sooner than we can now be by land. 

I would have the battalions composed of six companies ; 
colonels employed, Webb, Sprout, Huntington, Olney, 
Hull, Barber, Gimat, Laurens ; Majors Willet, Fish, 

Gibbes, Inspector Smith, , and another ; Brigadier 

General Huntington and Scamell, and a good corps of ar- 
tillery under ******. My dear friend, you would be more 
important at head quarters ; but if you don't stay there, 



340 THE LIFE OF 

you know what you have promised to me. Adieu. Write 
me often and long letters. It is probable I will be in the 
southern wilderness until the end of the war, far from head 
quarters, from the French army, from my correspondence 
with France ; but the whole good I could have operated, in 
this last instance, must have taken place by this time. My 
best respects and affectionate compliments wait on Mrs. 
Hamilton. 

Most friendly, yours, 

LA FAYETTE. 

On the eighteenth, (April,) he writes him from the Sus- 
quehanna : 

" DEAR HAMILTON, 

" You are so sensible a fellow, that you can certainly ex- 
plain to me what is the matter that New-York is given up ; 
that our letters to France go for nothing ; that while the 
French are coming, I am going. This last matter gives 
great uneasiness to the Minister of France. All this is not 
comprehensible to me, who having been long from head 
quarters, have lost the course of intelligence. 

" Have you left the family, my dear sir ? I suppose so ; 
but from love to the General, for whom you know my af- 
fection, I ardently wish it was not the case ; many, many 
reasons conspire to this desire of mine. But if you do leave 
it, and if I go to exile, come and partake it with me. 

" Yours, 

"1. f." 

The approaching period of service, and the hopes which 
began to be indulged of an active campaign, inspired Ha- 
milton with a strong desire to obtain a situation in which 
he might seize the first opportunity to increase his reputa- 
tion. The letters of his friends, and especially those receiv- 



HAMILTON. 341 

ed from the Marquis, quickened his wishes, and with a de- 
termination to continue in the service until the independ- 
ence of the country was secured, he now resolved to renew 
his application for a separate command, which had failed 
in the preceding autumn ; and with this view addressed the 
following letter to the commander-in-chief. 

SIR, 

I imagine your excellency has been informed, that in 
consequence of the resolution of congress for granting com- 
missions to aid-de-camps appointed under the former esta- 
blishment, I have obtained one of lieutenant colonel in the 
army of the United States, bearing rank since the first of 
March, 1777. 

It is become necessary to me to apply to your excellency, 
to know in what manner you foresee you will be able to 
employ me in the ensuing campaign. I am ready to enter 
into activity whenever you think proper ; though I am not 
anxious to do it till the army takes the field, as before that 
period I perceive no object. 

Unconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no 
other command than in a light corps, and I flatter myself 
my pretensions to this are good. 

Your excellency knows I have been in actual service 
since the beginning of '76. I began in the line, and had I 
continued there, I ought, in justice, to have been more ad- 
vanced in rank than I now am. I believe my conduct in 
the different capacities in which I have acted, has appeared 
to the officers of the army in general such as to merit their 
confidence and esteem ; and I cannot suppose them to be 
so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have always had, 
of being useful to the United States. I mention these things 
only to show that I do not apprehend the same difficulties 
can exist in my case, (which is peculiar,) that have opposed 



342 THE LIFE OF 

the appointment to commands of some other officers, not 
belonging to what is called the line. 

Though the light infantry is chiefly formed, yet being 
detached to the southward, I take it for granted there will 
be a van guard by detachment formed for this army. 
I have the honour to be, very respectfully, 

Your excellency's most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 
De Peyster's Point, April 27, 1731. 

The following reply was immediately given. 

New- Windsor, April 27th, 1781. 
DEAR SIR, 

Your letter of this date has not a little embarrassed me. 
You must remember the ferment in the Pennsylvania line 
the last campaign, occasioned by the appointment of Major 
McPherson, and you know the uneasiness which at this 
moment exists among the eastern officers, on account of 
the commands conferred upon Colonel Gimat and Major 
Galvan, although it was the result of absolute necessity. 

Should circumstances admit of the formation of another 
advanced corps, of which I see very little prospect from 
present appearances, it can be but small, and must be 
composed almost entirely of eastern troops ; and to add to 
the discontents of the officers of those lines, by the farther 
appointment of an officer of your rank to the command of 
it, or in it, would, I am certain, involve me in a difficulty 
of a very disagreeable and delicate nature, and might, per- 
haps, lead to consequences more serious than it is easy to 
imagine. While I adhere firmly to the right of making 
such appointments as you request, I am, at the same time, 
obliged to reflect, that it will not do to push that right too 
far, more especially in a service like ours, and at a time so 
critical as the present. 



HAMILTON. 343 

I am convinced, that no officer can, with justice, dispute 
your merit or abilities. The opposition heretofore made 
had not been for the want of those qualifications in the 
gentlemen who are, and have been, the objects of discon- 
tent. The officers of the line contend, without having re- 
ference to particular persons, that it is a hardship and re- 
flection upon them, to introduce brevet officers into com- 
mands, (of some permanency,) in which there are more op- 
portunities of distinguishing themselves, than in the line of 
the army at large, and with the men they have had the 
trouble to discipline and to prepare for the field. My prin- 
cipal concern arises from an apprehension that you will im- 
pute my refusal of your request to other motives than those 
I have expressed, but I beg you to be assured, I am only 
influenced by the reasons which I have mentioned. 
I am, dear sir, 

Your obedient and humble servant, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 

Hamilton, deeming his case one which ought to be distin- 
guished from those which Washington had adduced as pre- 
cedents, wrote him a farther letter, on the second of May. 

SIR, 

I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you by my 
late application, and that you should think there are insu- 
perable obstacles to a compliance with it. Having re- 
nounced my expectations. I have no other inducement for 
troubling your excellency with a second letter, than to ob- 
viate the appearance of having desired a thing inconsistent 
with the good of the service, while I was acquainted with 
the circumstances that made it so. 

I was too interested a spectator of what happened in the 
case of Major McPherson, not to have remarked, and not 
to recollect, all the circumstances. The opposition turned, 



344 THE LIFE OP 

\ 

ostensibly, on his being a brevet officer, yet having a com- 
mand in a corps formed entirely from one line ; the pro- 
priety of his being employed in a detachment from the ar- 
my at large, so far as I remember, was not disputed. In 
delicacy to Major McPherson, no personal objections were 
formally made, but in reality they existed and contributed 
to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar hardship, that 
a gentleman who had, for a long time, fought against us, 
and had not taken part with us till a late period, and when 
our affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect, should 
be preferred in one of the most honorary commands of the 
service. Your excellency must be convinced, that I men- 
tion this in no other view than to show the sentiments of 
the officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the oppo- 
sition. My esteem for Major McPherson, and other rea- 
sons, make it impossible I can have a different intention. 

I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the cases 
of Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan ; but I have under- 
stood, that it is founded on their being appointed in the light 
corps for two successive campaigns. 

It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge, that I 
believe a disposition to exclude brevet officers in general 
from command, has a great share in the opposition, in every 
instance, and that so far it affects my case. But, at the same 
time, it appeans to me, this principle alone can never be pro- 
ductive of more than momentary murmurs, where it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced, 
that the Pennsylvania officers, for their own sakes, repented 
the rash steps they had taken, and, on cool reflection, were 
happy in an opportunity to relinquish their menaces of quit- 
ting a service to which they were attached by habit, inclina- 
tion, and interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, 
we shall never have a similar instance in the army, unless 
the practice should be carried to excess. Major Galvan, I 
am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will be 



HAMILTON. 345 

then the only brevet officer remaining in command. Your 
excellency is the best judge of the proper limits; and there 
can be no doubt, that the rights of particular officers ought 
to give place to the general good and tranquillity of the ser- 
vice. 

I cannot forbear repeating, that my case is peculiar, and 
dissimilar to all the former ; it is distinguished by the cir- 
cumstances I have before intimated, my early entrance 
into the service, my having made the campaign of '76, 
the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of a company 
of artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to a 
rank, equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I now pos- 
sess, my having made all the subsequent campaigns in 
the family of the commander-in-chief, in a constant course 
of important and laborious service. These are my preten- 
sions, at this advanced period of the war, to being employed 
in the only way which my situation admits ; and I imagine 
they would have their weight in the minds of the officers in 
general. I only urge them a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same light with 
your excellency, or to regard as impracticable my appoint- 
ment in a light corps, should there be one formed. I en- 
treat they may be understood in this sense only. I am in- 
capable of wishing to obtain any object by importunity. 

I assure your excellency, that I am too well persuaded of 
your candour, to attribute your refusal to any other cause 
than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the 
appointment. 

I have the honour to be, with perfect respect, sir, 

Your most obedient and humble servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

P. S. I have used the term brevet in the sense your excel- 
lency appears to have understood it, as signifying, in gene- 
ral, all officers not attached to any established corps. Con-

only a kind of warrant to those whom they designate as 
brevet officers ; mine is a regular commission. 

DC Peystcr's Point, May 2d, 1781. 

Within a short time after this correspondence closed, a 
letter was received from La Fayette, dated Richmond, 
May 23, 1781. 

MY DEAR HAMILTON, 

I have been long complaining that I had nothing to do ; 
and want of employment was an objection I had to my 
going to the southward. But for the present, my dear 
friend, my complaint is quite of an opposite nature ; and I 
have so many arrangements to make, so many difficulties 
to combat, so many enemies to deal with, that I am just 
that much of a general as will make me an historian of mis- 
fortunes, and nail my name upon the ruins of what good 
soldiers are pleased to call the army in Virginia. 

There is an age past since I heard from you. I acknow- 
ledge that, on my part, I have not written so often as I 
ought to have done ; but you will excuse this silence in 
favour of my very embarrassing circumstances. However 
remote you may be from your former post of aid-de-camp 
to the commander-jn-chief, I am sure you are nevertheless 
acquainted with every transaction at head quarters. My 
letters have served to your information, and I shall conse- 
quently abstain from repetitions. 

Our forced march saved Richmond. Philips w r as going 
down, and thus far I am very happy. Philips' return, his 
landing at Brendon, south side of James river, and the un- 
molested joining of Lord Cornwallis through North Caro- 
lina, made me apprehensive of the storm that was gather- 
ing. I advanced towards Petersburg, and intended to have 
established a communication upon James and Appamatox 



HAMILTON. 347 

rivers. Had Philips marched to Halifax, I was determined 
to follow him, and should have risked every thing rather 
to omit making a diversion in favour of Greene. But that 
army took possession of Petersburg, and obliged me to 
stick to the side of the river, whence reinforcements are 
expected. Both armies have formed their junction of be- 
tween four and five thousand men. We have no continen- 
tals ; their infantry is near five to one; their cavalry ten to 
one. Our militia are not numerous, without arms, and are 
not used to war. Government wants energy ; and there 
is nothing to enforce the laws. General Greene has di- 
rected me to take command in this state, and I must tell 
you, by the way, his letter is very polite and affectionate. 
It then became my duty to arrange the departments, which 
1 found in the greatest confusion and relaxation ; nothing 
can be obtained, and yet expenses are enormous. The Ba- 
ron, and the few new levies we could collect, are ordered 
to South Carolina. I am glad he goes, as the hatred of the 
Virginians to him was pretty hurtful to the service. Is it 
not strange that General Wayne's detachment cannot be 
heard of? They are to go to Carolina ; but should I have 
them for a few days, I am at liberty to keep them. This 
permission I will improve so far as to receive one blow, 
that, being beat, I may at least be beat with some decency. 
There are accounts that Lord Cornwallis is very strong, 
others make him very weak. In this country there is no 
getting good intelligence. I request you will write me, if 
you approve of my conduct. The command of the waters, 
the superiority in cavalry, and the great disproportion of 
forces, gave the enemy such advantages that I durst not 
venture out, and listen to my fondness for enterprise ; to 
speak truth, I was afraid of myself as much as of the ene- 
my. Independence has rendered me the more cautious, as 
I know my own warmth ; but if the Pennsylvanians come, 
Lord Cornwallis shall pay something for his victory. 



348 THE LIFE OF 

I wish a reinforcement of light infantry, to recruit the 
battalions, or a detachment under General Huntington was 
sent to me. I wish Laurens or Sheldon were immediately 
despatched with some horse. Come here, my dear friend, 
and command our artillery in Virginia. I want your ad- 
vices and your exertions. If you grant my request, you 
will vastly oblige your friend,

Having completed the details of circumstances of a per- 
sonal nature, we now return to events of more general in- 
terest. 

The suggestions which had been made by Hamilton to 
Mr. Duane, in the preceding summer, although they led to 
no immediate measures, were presented by the latter to the 
consideration of his friends in congress, and became the 
subject of much serious reflection. The diminished import- 
ance which that body felt would result from the proposed 
transfer of their direct patronage, by the abolition of the 
various subsidiary boards, to executive departments, and 
the vanity of individuals who had long been most active in 
the committees, all concurred to delay the measure ; but 
the good sense of congress at last prevailed. The new 
board of treasury, with all its complicated branches, was 
found wholly incompetent to its objects, and a committee of 
congress, which had been appointed to devise a system for 
the arrangement of " the civil executive departments," rer 
ported a plan for the establishment of a secretary of foreign 
affairs, which was followed by a farther report, recom- 
mending* the appointment of a superintendent of finance, 
a secretary of war, and of the marine ; and in the course 
of the year, Robert R. Livingston was chosen to the depart- 
ment of state, Robert Morris superintendent of finance, Ge^ 

'February, 1781. 



HAMILTON. 349 

neral McDougal secretary of the marine, and General Lin- 
coln secretary at war.* 

The pressure of the exigencies, and more enlightened 
counsels, which had induced congress to part with such an 
essential portion of their authority, in the creation of these 
departments, influenced them, at the same time, to adopt 
another measure, which, had it been carried into effect, 
would have at once restored the public credit, secured re- 
sources for the discharge of the debt, and established a per- 
manent basis for a general and adequate system of finance. 
It was a motion, by Dr. Witherspoon, that the United 
States should be empowered to superintend the commercial 
regulations of every state, so that none might take place 
that should be partial, or contrary to the common interest ; 
and that they should be vested with the exclusive right of 
laying duties on all imported articles; no restriction to be 
valid, and no such duty to be laid, but with the consent of 
nine states, with provisions to secure uniformity. The en- 
larged views embraced in this resolution were not sanc- 
tioned ; but another measure of great moment was recom- 
mended, that the states should confer on congress the 
power of levying an impost of five per cent, on imported 
articles, to be applied to the discharge of the debts incurred 
for supporting the war, and to continue until they were dis- 
charged. 

* In a letter from Samuel Adams, of the 9th December, 1783, he says, 
" Power will follow the possession of money, even when it is known that it 
is not the possessor's property; so fascinating are riches in the eyes 'of man- 
kind. Were our financier, I wap going to say, even an angel from heaven, I 
hope he will never have so much influence, as to gain the ascendency over 
congress, which the first lord of the treasury has long had over the parliament 
of Britain, long enough to-efiect the ruin of that nation. These are the fears 
which I expressed in congress, when the department was first instituted. I 
was told, that the breath of congress could annihilate the financier ; but I re- 
plied, that the time might come, and if they were not careful, it certainly 
would, when even congress would not dare to blow that breath : whether 
these fears are the mere creatures of the imagination, you will judge." 



350 THE LIFE OF 

On the thirtieth of July, 1777, an adjourned convention 
of delegates from several states was held at Springfield, 
which proposed the abolition of a limitation of prices ; the 
gradual "drawing in" of the paper money; and its being 
funded at an interest of six per cent., and a system of taxa- 
tion as a mean to this object. This subject was resumed by 
a convention which assembled at Hartford, in October, 1779, 
and which adjourned to meet in Philadelphia in the following 
January, when resolutions were adopted, recommending 
that Virginia should appoint commissioners to convene at 
Hartford in the ensuing autumn. The deliberations of this 
convention produced an early attention to this subject in 
congress ; and in March, 1780, a motion was made by Mr. 
Burke, of North Carolina, " that the stales be requested to 
pass laws, enabling congress to levy an impost of one per 
cent, on all exports and imports, as a fund for sinking the 
emissions for carrying on the present war ; to continue un- 
til a sum equal to the whole of the said emissions shall be 
collected," which was lost. 

Nine commissioners assembled at Hartford, in pursuance 
of their adjournment, among whom were Judge Hobart 
and Egbert Benson of New- York. Upon much delibera- 
tion, a paper was addressed to congress, which, after touch- 
ing upon several military matters, recommends, in the sixth 
article of their proceedings, that an estimate be made of all 
the interest due on loan office certificates, and on all other 
debts incurred by continental purchasing officers ; that 
taxes should be imposed by congress on certain specific ar- 
ticles ; or duties on imports, which the states should author- 
ize them to levy and collect. This authority only to take 
effect with the concurrence of all the states not in posses- 
sion of the enemy ; the proceeds to be appropriated to the 
payment of the interest of the debt. A return of the white 
and black inhabitants was also recommended, and a conti- 
nental judicature, of three persons, to try offences against 



HAMILTON. 351 

the laws of congress, was suggested. This letter was read 
in congress, on the twelfth of December, 1 780, and in Feb- 
ruary following, Egbert Benson was appointed procurator.* 

The important proposal of a national impost, which be- 
came the leading subject of controversy during many years, 
that on which the whole system of public credit depended, 
and which may be considered as the most prominent in 
the train of events that led to the adoption of the federal 
constitution, was resisted by the jealousy of several of the 
commercial states, who imagined, that by entrusting con- 
gress with the control of their customs, they were parting 
with every essential attribute of sovereignty. 

Nothing seemed left to relieve the finances of the coun- 
try, but the adoption of some measure by which a new 
" mass of credit" could be created, and the depreciated pa- 
per replaced by a currency of fixed value, adequately sus- 
tained. A recent resolution! of congress, passed with but 
one dissenting voice, " to pay all the debts which had been 
liquidated in specie value, or which had been, or should be, 
made payable in specie or its equivalent, actually in specie 
or its equivalent," and a recommendation to the states to 
amend their laws, making the bills of credit emitted under 
the authority of congress a legal tender, so that they should 
not be a tender in any other manner than at their current 
value, compared with gold and silver, gave evidence of a 
sound state of public opinion. 

Encouraged by these indications, Hamilton resumed his 

* Among the proposals to invigorate the confederation, was one made on 
the sixteenth March, 1781, that under a construction of the thirteenth article 
of the confederation, it should be so amended, " that if any state refused to ob- 
serve all the articles of the confederation, congress should be empowered to 
authorize the land and naval forces of the United States to compel such state 
to fulfil its federal engagements, and also to make restraint on its merchan- 
dise." 

t March sixteenth, 1781. 



352 THE LIFE OF 

plan of a national bank, of which the first suggestion was 
made by him to Robert Morris. 

The Bank of Pennsylvania, which had been established 
in June, though partial in its objects, having been a bank 
merely of deposit, not of issue, had given congress such 
aid as predisposed them to the adoption of a more exten- 
sive system. 

The character of the individual who had been elected su- 
perintendent of finance, encouraged Hamilton to hope for 
the attainment of his project ; and with this view, on the 
thirtieth of April, 1781, he addressed an elaborate letter to 
Mr. Robert Morris, the fruits of his leisure, since he had been 
relieved from the duties of aid-de-camp, discussing at large 
the causes of the depreciation, and indicating the means of 
raising the value of the currency, and at the same time en- 
closing a charter for a bank to be incorporated by congress. 

This plan was prefaced by the following observations : 

April 30th, 1781. 

I was among the first who were convinced that an ad- 
ministration by single men was essential to the proper 
management of the affairs of this country. I am persuaded 
it is the only resource we have to extricate ourselves from 
the distresses which threaten the subversion of our cause. 
It is palpable that the people have lost all confidence in our 
public councils, and it is a fact, of which I dare say you are 
as well apprized as myself, that our friends in Europe are 
in the same disposition. I have been in a situation that 
has enabled me to obtain a better idea of this than most 
others, and I venture to assert, that the court of France 
will never give half the succours to this country while con- 
gress hold the reins of administration in their own hands, 
which they would grant if these were entrusted to indivi- 
duals of established reputation, and conspicuous for probity, 
abilities, and fortune. 



HAMILTON. 353 

With respect to ourselves, there is so manifest and rooted 
a diffidence of the government, that if we could be assured 
the future measures of congress would be dictated by the 
most perfect wisdom and public spirit, there would be stiH 
a necessity for a change in the forms of our administration, 
to give a new spring and current to the passions and hopes 
of the people. To me it appears evident, that an executive 
ministry, composed of men wjth the qualifications I have 
described, would speedily restore the credit of government 
abroad and at home ; would induce our allies to great exer- 
tions in our behalf; would inspire confidence in moneyed 
men in Europe, as well as in America, to lend us those 
sums of which it may be demonstrated we stand in need, 
from the disproportion of our national wealth to the ex- 
penses of the war. 

I hope, sir, you will not consider it a compliment, when 
I assure you that I heard, with the greatest satisfaction, of 
your nomination to the department of finance. 

In a letter of mine last summer to Mr. Duane, urging, 
among other things, the plan of an executive ministry, I 
mentioned you as the person who ought to fill that depart- 
ment. I know of no other in America who unites so many 
advantages ; and, of course, every impediment to your ac- 
ceptance is to me a subject of chagrin. I flatter myself, 
congress will not preclude the public from your services, by 
an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions ; and as one 
deeply interested in the event, I am happy in believing you 
will not easUy be discouraged from undertaking an office, 
by which you may render America and the world no less a 
servipe than the establishment of American independence. 
.'Tis by introducing order into our finances, by restoring 
public credit, not by gaining battles, that we are finally to 
attain our object. 'Tis by putting ourselves in a condition 
to continue the war, not by temporary, violent, and unnatu- 
ral efforts to bring it to a decisive issue, that we shall in

THE LIFE OF 



reality bring it to a speedy and successful one. In the 
frankness of truth, I believe, sir, you are the man best capa- 
ble of performing this great work. 

In expectation that all difficulties will be removed, and 
that you will ultimately act on terms you approve, I take 
the liberty to submit to you some ideas, relative to the ob- 
jects of your department. I pretend not to be an able 
financier. It is a part of administration which has been 
least in my way, and of course has least occupied my inqui- 
ries and reflections ; neither have I had leisure or materials 
to make accurate calculations. I have been obliged to de- 
pend on memory for important facts, for want of the au- 
thorities from which they are drawn. 

With all these disadvantages, my plan must necessarily 
be crude and defective ; but it may be a basis for something 
more perfect, or if it contains any hints that may be of use 
to you, the trouble I have taken myself, or may give you, 
will not be misapplied. At any rate, the confidence I have 
in your judgement, assures me that you will receive with 
pleasure communications of this sort. If they contain any 
thing useful, they will promote your views, and the public 
benefit ; if not , the only evil is the trouble of reading them ; 
and the best informed will frequently derive lights even 
from the reveries of projectors and quacks. There is scarcely 
any plan so bad as not to have something good in it. I trust 
mine to your candour, with this apology, you will at least 
do justice to my intention. 

With these preliminary remarks, he proceeds to the in- 
quiry as to " what ought to be done in the finances of the 
United States ?" First, to estimate its capacity for reve- 
nue, and the proportion between its abilities and its wants, 
by examining the proportion the revenues other countries 
have borne to their wealth, and applying the rule to Ame- 
rica. Second, by comparing the result of that rule with the 



HAMILTON. 355 

product of taxes in those states which have been most ear- 
nest in taxation. 

The result obtained, by an examination applied to Great 
Britain, France, and the United Provinces was, that the re- 
venue is one fourth of the circulating cash in commercial 
countries, so far as this is a just representative of its labour 
and commodities. 

He then states the current cash of America, previous to 
the war, to have been about thirty millions of dollars, of 
which one eighth was specie ; and that the proper revenue, 
at that time, was seven and a half million of dollars. But 
as the system of taxation was carried to an extreme in those 
countries, that the rule is inapplicable in its full extent to 
the United States ; though a much larger amount than might 
be expected, could be levied during the war, without bur- 
thening the poorer classes, from the greater equality of for- 
tunes, and a more equal division of the public burthens. 
Making the necessary qualifications, he arrives at the re- 
sult, that the present revenue was one fifth less than it had 
been before the war. Having adverted to the causes of the 
diminished circulation, which he considers as principally 
artificial, he comes to the conclusion, allowing for the dimi- 
nution of foreign trade, and the loss of territory, that the 
states have a nett revenue of six millions of dollars ; a re- 
sult which is nearly confirmed by a detailed examination of 
the previous product of the taxes, of which Massachusetts 
was supposed to have raised one fifth. 

Taking this as the amount of revenue, he next proceeds 
to ascertain, by general rules, the military capacity of the 
country, which although it had at times risen to thirty thou- 
sand men, might be estimated at twenty thousand. The 
expenses incident to the support of which force, with the 
necessary civil expenditures, rendering the amount of the 
annual charges of the countiy less than eleven million of 
dollars, left a deficit of four and a half millions to be supplied 



356 THE LIFE OF 

by credit, foreign or domestic. He then examines the pros- 
pect from foreign loans, which taking into view the politi- 
cal and financial embarrassments of France, he supposes 
may justify an expectation of a loan annually of eight or ten 
million of livres, which would only meet a third of the na- 
tional wants. 

From Spain, after remarking on her cold and passive 
policy, in pursuance of which the bills drawn on her, though 
not rejected, had not been paid, he expects nothing. 
" Their method of prosecuting the war, can scarcely be re- 
solved into Spanish supineness, but seems to have a more 
corrupt original. A bigotted prince, governed by a greedy 
confessor, is a character on which little dependence can be 
placed," 

Holland, as a government, stands in need of all its credit 
for its own uses. But from the Dutch capitalists much 
might be expected, though not on the faith of the United 
States, by the establishment of a system such as he is about 
to propose. The prospects of internal loans to govern- 
ment, both from the want of confidence, and the more ad- 
vantageous terms of traffic in which individual wealth could 
be employed, he rates very low. 

"To surmount these obstacles," he observes, "and give 
individuals ability and inclination to lend, a plan might be 
devised which, by incorporating their means together, and 
uniting them with those of the public, will, on the founda- 
tion of that incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit 
that will supply the defect of moneyed capital, and answer 
all the purposes of cash. A plan which will not only ad- 
vance the interest of the lenders, secure the independence 
of their country, and in its progress have the most benefi- 
cial influence upon its future commerce, but be a source of 
national strength and wealth. I mean," he says, " the in- 
stitution of a national bank. This I regard, in some shape 
or other, as an expedient essential to our safety and sue- 



HAMILTON. 357 

cess, unless by a happy turn of European affairs, the war 
should speedily terminate, in a manner upon which it would 
be unwise to reckon. There is no other that can give to 
government that extensive and systematic credit, which the 
defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to 
its operations. The longer it is delayed, the more difficult 
it becomes. Our affairs grow every day more relaxed and 
more involved. Public credit hastens to a more irretrievable 
catastrophe. The means for executing the plan are exhaust- 
ed in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making 
in Massachusetts, would have gone a great way in esta- 
blishing the funds on which the bank must stand. 

" I am aware of all the objections that have been made to 
public banks, and that they are not without enlightened and 
respectable opponents. But all that has been said against 
them only tends to prove, that like all other good things, 
they are subject to abuse, and when abused, become per- 
nicious. The precious metals, by similar arguments, may 
be proved to be injurious. If is certain that the monies 
of South America have had great influence in banishing 
industry from Spain, and sinking it in real wealth and im- 
portance. Great power, commerce, and riches, or, in other 
words* great national prosperity, may, in like manner, be 
denominated evils ; for they lead to insolence, an inordi- 
nate ambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, 
and all those vices which corrupt a government, enslave the 
state, and precipitate the ruin of a nation. But no wise 
statesman will reject the good, from an apprehension of the 
ill. The truth is, in human affairs, there is no good, pure 
and unmixed. Every advantage has two sides ; and wis- 
dom consists in availing ourselves of the good, and guard- 
ing, as much as possible, against the bad. 

"The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and 
private credit. The former gives power to the state, for 
the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter fa- 



358 THE LIFE OF 

cilitates and extends the operations of commerce among in 
dividuals. 

" Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agri- 
culture and manufactures flourish, and herein consist the 
true wealth and prosperity of a state. 

" Most commercial nations have found it necessary to in- 
stitute banks ; and they have proved to be the happiest en- 
gines that ever were invented for advancing trade. Venice, 
Genoa, Hamburgh, Holland, and England, are examples of 
their utility. They owe their riches, commerce, and the 
figure they have made at different periods, in a great de- 
gree, to this source. Great Britain is indebted for the im- 
mense efforts she has been able to make in so many illus- 
trious and successful wars, essentially to that vast fabric of 
credit, raised on this foundation. Tis by this alone, she 
now menaces our independence. She has indeed abused 
the advantage, and now stands on a precipice. Her ex- 
ample should both persuade and warn us. 'Tis in repub- 
lics, where banks are most easily established and supported, 
and where they are least liable to abuse. Our situation 
will not expose us to frequent wars, and the public will 
have no temptation to overstrain its credit. 

"In my opinion, we ought not to hesitate, because we have 
no other resource. The long and expensive wars of King 
William had drained England of its specie ; its commerce 
began to droop for want of a proper medium ; its taxes 
were unproductive, and its revenues declined. The admi- 
nistration wisely had recourse to the institution of a bank, 
and it retrieved the national difficulties. We are in the 
same, and still greater want, of a sufficient medium. We 
have little specie ; the paper we have is of small value, and 
rapidly declining to less. We are immersed in a war for 
our existence as a nation, for our liberty and happiness as 
a people. We have no revenues, nor no credit. A bank, 
if practicable, is the only thing that can give us either the 



* HAMILTON. 359 

one or the other. Besides these great and cardinal mo- 
tives to such an institution, and the advantages we should 
enjoy from it in common with other nations, our situation, 
relatively to Europe and to the West Indies, would give us 
some peculiar advantages. 

" Nothing is more common than for men to pass from the 
abuse of a good thing to the disuse of it. Some persons, 
disgusted by the depreciation of the money, are chimerical 
enough to imagine it would be beneficial to abolish all pa- 
per, and annihilate the whole of what is now in circulation, 
and depend altogether upon specie, both for commerce and 
finance. The scheme is altogether visionary, and in the at- 
tempt would be fatal. We have not a competent stock 
of specie in this country, either to answer the purpose of 
circulation in trade, or to serve as a basis for revenue. 
The whole amount of what we have, I am persuaded, does 
not exceed six millions of dollars, one-fifth of the circulating 
medium before the war. To suppose this would be suffi- 
cient for the operations of commerce, would be to suppose 
that our domestic and foreign commerce were both reduced 
four-fifths ; a supposition that carries absurdity on the face 
of it. It follows, that if our paper money were destroyed, 
a great part of the transactions of traffic must be carried on 
by barter ; a mode inconvenient, partial, confined ; destruc- 
tive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of 
the paper we now have, this evil exists in too great a degree." 

Having shown that if all the specie could be drawn into 
the treasury annually, the consequence of such a measure, 
which never was effected in any country, would be a com- 
plete stagnation of business ; and that a recourse to taxes 
in kind, would prove wholly inefficacious, he proceeds to 
observe, 

" The error of those who would explode paper money 
altogether, originates in not making proper distinctions. 
Our paper was, in its nature, liable to depreciation, because 



360 

it had no funds for its support, and was not upheld by pri- 
vate credit. The emissions under the resolution of March, 
1780, have partly the former advantage, but are destitute 
of the latter, which is equally essential. No paper credit 
can be substantial or durable, which has not funds, and 
which does not unite immediately the interest and influence 
of the moneyed men, in its establishment and preservation. 
A credit begun on this basis will, in process of time, greatly 
exceed its funds ; but this requires time, and a well settled 
Opinion in its favour. 'Tis IN A NATIONAL BANK ALONE THAT 

WE CAN FIND THE INGREDIENTS TO CONSTITUTE A WHOLE- 
SOME, SOLID, AND BENEFICIAL PAPER CREDIT." 

The length to which these extracts have extended does 
not warrant the publication more at large of this elaborate 
document. A mere outline of the plan, consisting of twen- 
ty articles, is all that will now be given. 

The capital of the bank was to consist of a stock of three 
millions of dollars, divided into thirty thousand shares, to 
be exempted from all taxes and impositions. 

The subscription, according to the respective amounts, 
to be in proportionate quantities of specie, personal, and 
landed securities; the object being to secure the largest 
possible amount of specie. The bank to have all legal 
corporate immunities, and the stock to be protected from

to purchase estates, by principal or by annuities, to have 
the privilege of coining, to the amount of one half of its

which deposits were to be exempt from taxation, to have 
the right of contracting with the French government, for 
the supply of its fleets and armies in America, and to con-

to be chosen by the private proprietors, and four by con- 
gress ; the minister of finance having the privilege of in- 
specting all their proceedings. 

A full examination of the principles of the proposed in- 
stitution would exceed the proper limits of this work, but 
a few desultory observations on some of the features of this 
plan, may not be misplaced. 

The introduction of landed security, as a part of the capi- 
tal stock, is the provision which, in a merely commercial 
view, might perhaps have been deemed most objectionable. 
But it is to be remembered, that commercial convenience 
was merely an incidental consideration. The primary ob- 
ject was similar to that of the bank of England ; after ab- 
sorbing the previous issues, to obtain a monopoly of the cir- 
culation, and by that means to secure a safe and uniform 
currency. 

But had the sole purpose of Colonel Hamilton been the 
granting facilities to trade, it is by no means obvious that 
his plan would have been less effective. 

It is true, that the country would not furnish an adequate 
amount of specie, or of equivalent available personal secu- 
rities to fill the stock ; and that for this reason, the defici- 
ency was sought to be supplied by landed security. But 
this landed security, though less readily convertible than 
the government debt of England, which forms the basis of 
its bank, might be pledged for an amount of cash of rela- 
tive value, and there would still exist the use of the lands, 
and the use of the value of its representative. 

That the landed security was not convertible to meet the 
immediate wants of the bank, would be less objectionable, 
in the minds of those who entertain the opinion, not without 
strong reasons, that the capital of a bank should remain a 
permanent vested fund, upon which to base a credit, not a 
fund to be appropriated to its current uses. 

It is possible that this provision might have diminished 



HAMILTON. 363 

the number of merely moneyed subscribers ; but as this plan 
was to go into operation, at a time when the prevailing dis- 
trust of paper securities would dispose individuals, amidst a 
choice of evils, to prefer an institution which would furnish 
this additional support, to a capital of which the specie com- 
ponent was the most alluring ingredient, this disadvantage 
would have been more than compensated. 

The power of coining money, was introduced merely to 
enable the bank to convert its plate into specie ; but it was 
a power which, under proper checks, might have been ex- 
tended with advantage. 

The privilege of contracting with the French govern- 
ment, for the supply of its armies, was highly desirable 
from this consideration, that the greater part of the specie 
was derived from the expenditures of France, and passing 
through the bank, would have increased its credit and effi- 
ciency, while the great profits to be derived from the con- 
tracts, would have offered large inducements to subscri- 
bers. 

The article which rendered the bank responsible for the 
redemption of the existing paper, had in view the import- 
ance of relieving the country from a fluctuating medium, 
which infected all credit. The amount of the annuity to 
be secured by congress to the bank, was not fixed, from 
the difficulty of estimating the whole amount of the govern- 
ment issues; a difficulty which was increased by this 
circumstance, that this plan proposed to embrace all the 
State emissions, as essential to every efficient scheme of 
finance, a fact of high interest, in reference to the great 
question of the " Assumption," which threatened an insu- 
perable obstacle to the fiscal system of the present govern- 
ment. 

The permission to the bank to dissolve or sell at plea- 
sure, was introduced to encourage men to adventure in it, 



364 THE LIFE OV 

from a confidence, that when once engaged, the profits 
would induce them to continue. 

In reply to the inquiry, where funds are to be procured, 
in the present impotent state of the federal government, 
Colonel Hamilton says, " I answer, there are ample means, 
and they must be had. Congress must deal plainly with 
their constituents ; they must tell them that power without 
revenue, is a bubble ; that unless they give them substan- 
tial resources of the latter, they will not have enough of 
the former either to prosecute the war, or to maintain the 
union in peace ; that in short, they must, in justice to the 
public, and to their own honour, renounce the vain at- 
tempt of carrying on the war without either, a perse- 
verance in which can only deceive the people, and betray 
their safety. They must demand an instant, positive, and 
perpetual investiture of an impost on trade ; a land tax 
and a poll tax to be collected by their own agents. This 
act to become a part of the confederation. It has ever 
been my opinion, that congress ought to have complete so- 
vereignty in all but the mere municipal law of each state, 
and 1 wish to see a CONVENTION OF ALL THE STATES, with 
full power to alter and amend, finally and irrevocably, the 
present futile and senseless confederation." 
' After stating the plan of the bank, " these," he says, " as 
has already been observed, are only intended as outlines. 
The form of administration for the bank, and all other mat- 
ters, may be easily determined. If the leading principles 
are once approved, we shall find good models in the differ- 
ent European banks, which we can accommodate to our cir- 
cumstances. Great care, in particular, should be employed 
to guard against counterfeits ; and, I think, methods may 
be devised that will be effectual. 

" I see nothing to prevent the practicability of a plan of 
this kind, but a distrust of the final success of the war, which 
may make men afraid to risk any considerable part of their 



HAMILTON. 365 

fortunes in the public funds ; but without being an enthu- 
siast, I will venture to assert, that with such a resource as 
is here proposed, the loss of our independence is impossible. 
All we have to fear is, that the want of money may disband 
the army, or so perplex and enfeeble our operations, as to 
create in the people a general disgust and alarm, which may 
make them clamour for peace on any terms. But if a judi- 
cious administration of our finances, assisted by a bank, 
takes place, and the ancient security of property is restored, 
no convulsion is to be apprehended ; our opposition will 
soon assume an aspect of system and vigour, that will re- 
lieve and encourage the people, and put an end to the hopes 
of the enemy. 'Tis evident, they have it not in their pow- 
er to subdue us by force of arms ; in all these states they 
have not more than fifteen thousand effective troops, nor is 
it possible for them much to augment this number. The 
East and West Indies demand reinforcements. In all the 
islands they have not, at this time, above five thousand men ; 
a force not more than equal to the proper garrisoning of 
Jamaica alone, and which, the moment they lose a maritime 
superiority in those seas, will leave them much cause to fear 
for their possessions. They will probably send out fifteen 
hundred or two thousand men to recruit their regiments 
already here, but this is the utmost they can do. 

"Our allies have five thousand men at Rhode-Island, 
which in the worst event that can happen, will be recruit- 
ed to eight, to co-operate with us on a defensive plan. 
Should our army amount to no more than fifteen thousand 
men, the combined forces, though not equal to the expulsion 
of the enemy, will be equal to the purpose of compelling 
them to renounce their offensive, and content themselves 
with maintaining one or two capital points. This is on the 
supposition, that the public have the means of putting their 
troops in activity. By stopping the progress of their con- 
quests, and reducing them to an unmeaning and disgrace- 



366 THE LIFE OF 

ful defensive, we destroy the national expectation of suc- 
cess, from which the ministry draw their resources. They 
are in a situation, where the want of splendid successes is 
ruin. They have carried taxation nearly to its extreme 
boundary ; they have mortgaged all their funds ; they have 
a large unfunded debt, besides the enormous mass which is 
funded. This must necessarily create apprehensions in 
their most sanguine partizans, and if these are not counter- 
acted by flattering events, from time to time, they cannot 
much longer continue the delusion. Indeed, in that case, I 
suppose they must themselves despair. The game we play, 
is a sure game, if we play it with skill. I have calculated, 
in the preceding observations, on the most disadvantageous 
side ; many events may turn up in the course of the summer, 
to make even the present campaign decisive." 

On the twenty-sixth of May, the following reply was re- 
ceived from the Superintendent of Finance. 

ROBERT MORRIS TO COLONEL HAMILTON. 
SIR, 

It is some time since I received your performance, dated 
the thirtieth Apnjl last. I have read it with that attention 
which it greatly deserves, and finding many points of it to 
coincide with my own opinions on the subject, it naturally 
strengthened that confidence which every man ought to 
possess, to a certain degree, in his own judgement. You 
will very soon see the plan of a bank published, and sub- 
scriptions opened for its establishment, having already met 
with the approbation of congress. It only remains for indi- 
viduals to do their part, and a foundation will be laid for 
the anticipation of. taxes and funds, by a paper credit that 
cannot depreciate. The capital proposed, falls far short of 
your idea, and, indeed, far short of what it ought to be ; but 
the capital may afterwards be increased to almost anv 
amount. To propose a larger sum in the outset, and fail 



HAMILTON. 367 

in the attempt to raise it, might prove fatal ; to begin with 
what is clearly in our power to accomplish, and on that be- 
ginning to establish the credit that will inevitably command 
the future increase of capital, seems the most certain road 
to success. I have thought much about interweaving a 
land security with the capital of this bank, but am apprehen- 
sive it would convey to the public mind an idea of paper 
being circulated on that credit ; and that the bank, of con- 
sequence, must fail in its payments in case of any conside- 
rable run on it, and we must expect that its ruin will be 
attempted by external and internal foes. I have, therefore, 
left that point to the future deliberations of the directors of 
this bank, to whom, in due time, I shall communicate your 
address. I esteem myself much your debtor for this piece, 
not merely on account of the personal respect you have 
been pleased to express, but also on account of your good 
intentions ; and for these, and the pains you have taken, I 
not only think, but on all proper occasions shall say, the 
public are also indebted to you. 

My office is new, and I am young in the execution of it. 
Communications from men of genius and abilities will always 
be acceptable, and yours will ever command the attention of 
Sir, your obedient, humble servant, 

ROBT. MORRIS. 

Col. Alex. Hamilton, of the Artillery. 

The plan referred to in the preceding letter was submit- 
ted to congress on the seventeenth, adopted on the twenty- 
sixth*, and published, with an address from Mr. Morris, on 
the twenty-eighth of May, 1781. 

* The votes on this question, give an important indication of the views of 
congress, at that clay, on this " constructive power." Of the eleven states pre- 
sent, eight, viz. New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, New-Jersey, 
Maryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, were in favour. 
Massachusetts was against it, with one vote from Pennsylvania. Of the four 
members from Virginia, James Madison was alone in the negative.

368 THE LIFE OF 



The capital was four hundred thousand dollars, in shares 
of four hundred dollars each, payable in gold or silver. 
Its notes were made payable on demand, and receivable 
for taxes : a power was given to enlarge the capital : the 
superintendent of finance was authorized to inspect the 
books ; and on the last day of the year, an ordinance pass- 
ed, incorporating it under the name of the Bank of North 
America. 

Great as was the merit of Mr. Morris in the suggestion 
of this plan, he acquired a still stronger title to applause for 
the skill, energy, and judgement, with which it was carried 
into execution. 

His principal reliance for a supply of coin, was founded 
upon an engagement of the Governor General of Havan- 
nah to remit to the United States four hundred thousand 
dollars in specie, to be repaid by annual shipments of flour, 
which were to be guarantied by France, but which en- 
gagement was not fulfilled. 

It has been stated that the whole specie capital of this 
bank, when it commenced its operations, did not exceed 
forty thousand dollars ; and such was the apprehension of 
this small resource being exhausted, that persons were em- 
ployed, during the earlier part of its existence, to follow 
those who had demanded specie and obtain it from them, 
at any price, so as to return it into the coffers of the bank. 

This institution, nevertheless, soon obtained extensive 
confidence ; ministered largely to the wants of government ; 
and after its utility had been fully tested in furnishing a me- 
dium of exchange throughout the states, as safe and more 
convenient than the precious metals ; relief in the payment 
of the public burthens ; increased facilities to the internal 
and external commerce of the country ; the state of Penn- 
sylvania, by which it also had been incorporated, under the 
delusion of popular prejudice repealed its charter, on the 
extraordinary ground of the dangerous influence of foreign 



HAMILTON. 369 

capital on the free institutions of the country ; forgetting, 
that without such capital, that freedom, and those institu- 
tions, would probably not have been established : but the 
returning good sense of the state renewed the charter the 
ensuing year. 

O v 

The project for a convention of the states, which Hamil- 
ton first proposed in his letter to Mr. Duane, seems not to 
have met with much countenance in congress ; but the ex- 
position which he .had given of the defects of the existing 
government, enforced by the embarrassments with which 
that body found themselves perpetually clogged, rendered 
an enlargement of the powers of the confederation a sub- 
ject of frequent and anxious deliberation. 

Aware of the impediments which public opinion would 
interpose to the successful attainment of this great object, 
Hamilton commenced, at this time, a series of numbers, 
under the title of " The CONTINENTALIST." 

The earlier essays were published in July and August, 
1781. They were then suspended until after the surren- 
der of York Town, when they were resumed, at intervals, 
and continued during a part of the succeeding year. Many 
of them are lost, but a sufficient number remain to show 
the design of the publication. The first part was devoted to 
an examination of the defects of the existing league, and to 
an exposure of the groundless jealousy of power to which he 
attributed the hostility of the people to an enlargement of the 
authority of the federal government. Several of the essays 
on this branch of the subject, cannot be found. The succeeding 
numbers are occupied with a brief enumeration of the pow- 
ers with which the government ought to be clothed. Of 
these, the principal were, first, the power of regulating 
trade ;. comprehending a right of granting bounties and 
premiums, by way of .encouragement ; of imposing duties 
of every kind, as well for revenue as regulation ; of ap- 
pointing all officers of the customs, and of laying embar-

goes in extraordinary emergencies. Second, a moderate 
land tax, at a specific rate, to be granted to the federal go- 
vernment in perpetuity, and to be levied, (if congress think 
proper,) by their own collectors. Third, a moderate capi- 
tation tax. Fourth, the disposal of all unlocated land, for 
the benefit of the United States. Fifth, a certain propor- 
tion of the product of all the mines existing in the United 
States ; and sixth, the appointment of all the land and na- 
val officers by congress. 

Much space is allotted, to show the necessity of confer- 
ring on the general government specific funds, under their 
exclusive control, as a basis upon which he proposed to 
build up a system of public credit, and the same reasons 
are recapitulated at large, which are contained in the elabo- 
rate letter to Mr. Morris ; one consideration is worthy of 
remark, notwithstanding the zeal with which the esta- 
blishment of permanent funds is advocated, both in this, 
and all his other financial papers, there will be observed 
the most scrupulous care to introduce provisions in every 
scheme of finance, of which he was the author, to operate 
as a check upon the proneness of governments to incur 
debts, and insure their discharge, as fast as might be con- 
sistent with public convenience. 

The necessity of conferring the power of regulating 
trade, in its fullest sense, both by bounties and prohibitions, 
is clearly and strongly stated ; and the consequences of con- 
flicting state tariffs, distinctly portrayed. But while this essen- 
tial attribute of national sovereignty is claimed, a similar dis- 
cretion is evinced, as to the extent to which this power should 
be exercised. " Easy duties on commerce " are contended 
for, in order to lighten the charges on production ; and 
while the necessity is shown of granting to the federal go- 
vernment adequate funds, the policy of its relying on a com- 
pound of permanent and occasional supplies is exhibited. 
" The federal government," he says, " should neither be in- 



HAMILTON. 371 

dependent, nor too much dependent. It should neither be 
raised above responsibility or control, nor should it want 
the means of maintaining its own weight, authority, digni- 
ty, and credit. To this end, permanent funds are indis- 
pensable ; but they ought to be of such a nature, and so 
moderate in their amount, as never to be inconvenient." 

The collection of the national revenues, by officers ap- 
pointed by congress, is shown to be essential to the success 
of the system, and is urged from the farther consideration, 
that their appointment, and also that of all military officers, 
of every rank, would be the means of creating, in the inte- 
rior of each state, a mass of influence in favour of the fede- 
ral government. " The great danger," he says, has been 
shown to be, " that it will not have power enough to de- 
fend itself, and preserve the union; not that it will ever be- 
come formidable to the general liberty. A mere regard to 
the interests of the confederacy will never be a principle 
sufficiently active to curb the ambition and intrigues of dif- 
ferent members. Force cannot effect it. 

"A contest of arms will seldom be between the common 
sovereign and a single refractory member, but between dis- 
tinct combinations of the several parts against each other; 
a sympathy of situations, will be apt to produce associates 
to the disobedient. The application of force is always dis- 
agreeable ; the issue uncertain. It will be wiser to obviate 
the necessity of it, by interesting such a number of indivi- 
duals in each state in support of the federal government, as 
will be a counterpoise to the ambition of others, and will 
make it difficult for them to unite the people in opposition 
to the just and necessary measures of the union. There is 
something noble and magnificent in the perspective of a 
great FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC, closely linked in the pursuit of 
a common interest, tranquil and prosperous at home, re- 
spectable abroad ; there is something proportionably dimi- 
nutive and contemptible, in the prospect of a number of 



372 THE LIFE Of 

petty states, with the appearance only of union, jarring, 
jealous, and perverse, without any determined direction, 
fluctuating and unhappy at home, weak and insignifi- 
cant by their dissensions in the eyes of other nations. Hap- 
py America, if those to whom thou hast entrusted the 
guardianship of thy infancy, know how to provide for thy 
future repose, but miserable and undone, if their negligence 
or ignorance permits the spirit of discord to erect her ban- 
ners on the ruins of thy tranquillity 1" 

Such were the sentiments of a man, whose views have 
been so much, and so designedly misrepresented ; whose 
strong solicitude- for the liberties of America, saw in the 
constitutional strength of each department of government, 
the only security against usurpation ; who sought to con- 
nect with every grant of power, its appropriate check ; and 
who having advised every precaution for the public safety, 
which the most prudent foresight could suggest, believed 
that a generous confidence on the part of the people, was 
as essential to tliejr happiness, as an honest administration 
by their rulers.

CHAPTER XIV. 

[1781,] 

THE urgent representations made to congress by the. 
French minister, M. de la Luzerne, of the reluctance of 
the French court to extend their aids beyond what had al- 
ready been granted, the intimation that the state of Eu- 
rope might possibly lead France to an arrangement, which, 
as the best terms that could be obtained for the United 
States, would be founded on the principle of uti possidetis, 
and the difficulties which Colonel Laurens had encountered 
in his mission, all concurred to prompt an attempt upon 
New-York, which had been abandoned in the previous au- 
tumn, and which the letters of La Fayette show, was now 
in contemplation. General Washington, early in this year, 
(but at what precise time we are unable to state,) proceed- 
ed to Newport, for the . purpose of concerting measures 
with General Rochambeau, in which journey, it would ap- 
pear, from the following note, without date, that .notwith- 
standing their recent difference, he was attended by Colo- 
nel Hamilton, which is also of importance to show, that 
the difference which had taken place, had produced no di- 
minution of respect in the breast of the General. 

DEAR HAMILTON, 

I shall be obliged to you for the answer to the address, 
as soon as it is convenient to you. If we do not ride to 
the Point to see the fleet pass out, J am to have a confer- 
ence with Count de Rochambeau, and the engineer, di- 
rectly after breakfast, at which I wish you to be present. 
I am, sincerely and affectionately, yours, 

GEO. WASHINGTON. 

Half.past , A.M.

THE LIFE OP 



This interview having taken place, Washington returned 
to the army, and immediately ordered them from their quar- 
ters, with directions to encamp at Peekskill, whence they 
moved down the eastern banks of the Hudson, waiting the 
junction of the French forces, which soon after marched. 

The advance having arrived, on the sixth of July an ex- 
pedition was pushed forward, under General Lincoln, in 
the hope of surprising the enemy's works at King's Bridge. 
After an unimportant skirmish, the detachment returned to 
the main body, then at Dobbs' Ferry, a position on the Hud- 
son, a little more than twenty miles from New-York, where 
the American army crossed in the disastrous retreat of 1776. 

Hamilton, who had proceeded to Albany, after his return 
from Newport, anxious to take part in the interesting ope- 
rations which were about to occur, finding his application 
for a command unattended to, determined to bring the ques- 
tion to a definitive issue. The following extract from a let- 
ter written to Mrs. Hamilton, gives the course of this affair, 

Camp, near Dobbs' Ferry, July 10th, 1781. 

" The day before yesterday I arrived here, but for want 
of an opportunity could not write any sooner ; indeed, I 
know of none now. Finding, w r hen I came here, that no- 
thing was said on the subject of a command, I wrote the 
General a letter, and enclosed him my commission. This 
morning Tilghman came to me in his name, pressed me to 
retain my commission, with an assurance that he would en- 
deavour, by all means, to give me a command, nearly such 
as I could have desired in the present circumstances of the 
army. Though I know you would be happy to hear I had 
rejected this proposal, it is a pleasure my reputation would 
not permit me to afford you. I consented to retain my 
commission, and accept the command. I quarter, at present, 
by a very polite and warm invitation, with General Lincoln, 
and experience from the officers of both armies every mark 
of esteem." 



HAMILTON. 375 

It was at this post that Washington first received the in- 
telligence that the squadron of De Grasse was approach- 
ing the coast of Virginia. A council of war was held, to 
which Hamilton was invited by General Washington. The 
plan of a southern campaign was then discussed, and though 
reluctant to relinquish the attempt on New-York, so long 
entertained, it was determined, for the most cogent reasons, 
to make a forced march on Lord Cornwallis. 

It became of the utmost importance to conceal this pur- 
pose. The idea was thrown out, that the French fleet was 
expected at Shrewsbury, and that the army was to march 
and join it there ; and, to complete the deception, lines for 
an encampment were marked out on the Jersey side, ovens 
constructed, and a body of men advanced, as if to take a 
position for the combined forces. At this particular crisis, 
Washington felt the full value of his exertions in obtaining 
secret intelligence. A communication was constantly kept 
up with New-York, and it was soon ascertained that the 
deception was complete. The extent of the imposition on 
Sir Henry Clinton has always been a subject of surprise, 
but a stratagem which was adopted by Washington, and 
which fully succeeded, will serve to explain it. There was 
an individual in New-Jersey, who at one time held a con- 
siderable rank in the militia, and who had been employed 
by Washington to gain intelligence. In this service he had 
proved himself shrewd, observing, and alert ; and the in- 
formation he had given, at the commencement of his ca- 
reer, had been of much importance. Some time prior to 
this period, General Washington had discovered this man 
to be a traitor, and that, under cover of serving the Ameri- 
can cause, he was in fact in the pay of Sir Henry Clinton. 
He determined to take advantage of this discovery, and 
under the pretence of employing him to get farther advices, 
Washington sent for him to head quarters, where he threw 
in his way a map, prepared for the purpose, marked with 



376 

the pretended .route of the army to Shrewsbury, and with 
plans of the land and naval attack upon New-York. Anx- 
ious to confirm his. impressions by. every possible means, 
this same individual sought an interview with Colonel Ha- 
milton, and under semblance of a zeal for the American in- 
terests, inquired of him the destination of the army. Ha- 
milton, confident that a disclosure by him of the actual in- 
tentions of the commander-m-chief,. would be the most cer- 
taih means of deceiving him, as it could not be supposed 
that he .would communicate such an important and confi- 
dential 'secret, at once replied, "we are going to Virginia." 
The spy, thus completely duped, ha'stened with his informa- 
tion to the enemy, and communicated it to Sir Henry Clin- 
ton, who was in vain prompted by others to suspect the real 
designs of the Americans, and replied to every importunity, 
that he had information of a kind, and from a source, that 
could not be disputed. 

The intelligence of De Grasse's approach, had been com- 
municated to General Washington by the Superintendent 
of Finance, who immediately on the receipt of it, proceeded 
express to head quarters. The probability of Cornwallis' 
capture, now became strong. But a great obstacle existed : 
it was the utter incapacity of moving the army for want 
of funds. Robert Morris, on this occasion, rendered one of 
those great services to his country, which no other indivi- 
dual could have performed ; he assumed the responsibi- 
lity of moving the army. Washington, aware of the em- 
barrassed finances, inquired where were his means? He 
replied, that he did not himself know, but that he would find 
them. He immediately returned to Philadelphia, secured 
all the water craft on the Delaware, provided supplies on 
the route of the army, and while Washington was collecting 
a force to protect West Point, raised a large portion of the 
necessary funds on his personal responsibility. 
. Hamilton, in the mean time, had attained his wishes ; and 



HAMILTON. 377 

on the sixteenth of August, lie writes, " I wrote you by 
the last post, in which I informed you that I had taken com- 
mand of my corps. Major Fish is with me. I prize him 
both as a friend and an officer." And a few days after, he 
thus announces to his wife his departure for the south : 
" In my last letter, I informed you that there was a greater 
prospect of activity now, than there had been heretofore. 
I did this to prepare your mind for an event which, I am 
sure, will give you pain. I begged your father, at the same 
time, to intimate to you by degrees the probability of its 
taking place. I used this method to prevent a surprise, 
which might be too severe to you. A part of the army, my 
dear girl, is going to Virginia, and I must, of necessity, be 
separated at a much greater distance from my beloved wife. 
I cannot announce the fatal necessity, without feeling every 
thing that a fond husband can feel. I am unhappy ; I 
am unhappy beyond expression. I am unhappy, because I 
am to be so remote from you ; because I am to hear from 
you less frequently than I am accustomed to do. I am 
miserable, because I know you will be so ; I am wretched 
at the idea of flying so far from you, without a single hour's 
interview, to tell you all my pains and all my love. But I 
cannot ask permission to visit you. It might be thought 
improper to leave my corps at such a time, and upon such 
an occasion. I must go without seeing you, I must go 
without embracing you : alas ! I must go. But let no 
idea, other than of the distance we shall be asunder, disquiet 
you. Though I said the prospects of activity will be great- 
er, I said it to give your expectations a different turn, and 
prepare you for something disagreeable. It is ten to one 
that our views will be disappointed, by Cornwallis retiring 
to South Carolina by land. At all events, our operations 
will be over by the latter end of October, and I will fly to 
my home. Don't mention I am going to Virginia." 

The allied armies moved on the twenty-second of August,

and having taken a circuitous route to keep up the decep- 
tion, reached Philadelphia on the second of September, 
Generals Washington and Rochambeau then proceeded to 
an interview with De Grasse ; and General Lincoln, com- 
manding the Americans, and Baron De Viomenil the French, 
moved OB to the head of Elk, which they reached on the sixth 
of September, From this place, Hamilton again writes, 
" Yesterday, my lovely wife, I wrote to you enclosing you 
a letter in one to your father, to the care of Mr. Morris. 
To-morrow the post sets out, and to-morrow we embark 
for York Town. I cannot refuse myself the pleasure of 
writing you a few lines. Constantly uppermost in my 
thoughts and affections, I am happy only when my moments 
are devoted to some office that respects you. I would give 
the world to be able to tell you all I feel, and all I wish, but 
consult your own heart, and you will know mine. What 
a world will soon be between us ! To support the idea, all 
my fortitude is insufficient. What must be the case with 
you, who have the most female of female hearts ? I sink 
at the perspective of your distress, and I look to heaven to 
be your guardian and supporter. Circumstances which 
have just come to my knowledge, assure me that our ope- 
rations will be expeditious, as well as our success certain. 
Early in November, as I promised you, we shall certainly 
meet. Cheer yourself with this idea, and \vith the assu- 
rance of never more being separated. Every day confirms 
me in the intention of renouncing public life, and devoting 
myself wholly to you. Let others waste their time and their 
tranquillity in a vain pursuit of power and glory ; be it 
my object to be happy in a quiet retreat, with my better 
angel." Again he writes from Annapolis, " How che- 
quered is human life ? how precarious is happiness ? 
how easily do we often part with it for a shadow ? These 
are the reflections that frequently intrude themselves upon 
me, with a painful application. I am going to do my duty. 



HAMILTON. 379 

Our operations will be so conducted, as to economize the 
lives of men. Exert your fortitude, and rely upon heaven." 

These repeated expressions of attachment, are but the 
gentler declarations of the strong feelings which animated 
his breast, always full of tenderness to every object of his 
regard. It is apparent from his -correspondence at this 
time, that he entertained a fixed purpose, should the oppor- 
tunity offer, of establishing his military character on still 
higher ground, and winning a meed of fame, connected 
with the last great event in his country's early glory, and 
that he foresaw, with a deep foreboding of danger, the 
high enterprise to which his ambition pledged him. 

The transports which had been furnished by Barras, in 
the absence of De Grasse, reached the harbour between 
James Town and Williamsburg, on the twenty-second of 
September, with the advance of the Americans, where 
they disembarked, the residue soon following. The whole 
body moved forward, and on the twenty-eighth arrived 
within two miles of the enemy's works at York Town; 
Hamilton commanding a corps of light infantry, which was 
attached to the division of La Fayette, who had joined with 
the remains of the little army of Virginia. 

The selection of this position by Lord Cornwallis, under 
the circumstances in which he was placed, can by no means 
be regarded as exhibiting a want of military skill. Had 
the British General pursued his own wishes, he would have 
returned to the command of the army in South Carolina; 
but this would have been a violation of his orders from Sir 
Henry Clinton, who, apprehensive for his own safety, had 
directed a portion of the forces in Virginia to return to New- 
York. It had, also, been a favourite object with the Bri- 
tish ministry, to establish a permanent and central post, 
whence their naval enterprises could be more successfully 
conducted. Portsmouth, at first, attracted the attention of 
the British General, but was found wholly unsuited to his 



380 THE LIFE OF 

purpose. He next had in view the establishment of his 
army at Point Comfort, but greater objections existed to 
it, and York Town remained the only choice. 

This small village, lying on the south side of the noble 
stream whence it derives its name, is situated on the beau- 
tiful peninsula, formed by the York and the James, in their 
approach to the Chesapeake. 

Gloucester, which is on the north and opposite side of 
the York, projects so far into the river, that the distance 
between the headlands little exceeds a mile. 

Here Cornwallis, intercepted in his retreat to the inte- 
rior by La Fayette, who after a series of masterly move- 
ments, had completely kept him at bay, deterred, also, 
by the violent heats of the season, and cut off by De Grasse 
from all hopes of succour by sea, had concentrated his 
army, to the number of seven thousand men. 

On the west and northwest, his post was protected by an 
inlet from the river, a morass, and a deep ravine. On the 
high banks of the river to the north, batteries were erect- 
ed, which co-operating with those on the Gloucester side, 
controlled the river pass, which was narrowed by vessels 
sunk in the channel, and was also commanded by several 
ships of war stationed in the offing. The south and south- 
west, the most accessible points, were covered by an ex- 
tensive line of field fortifications, which his army were en- 
gaged in throwing up, when the Americans landed. 

On their approach, a show of opposition was made on 
their left, but a few pieces being advanced by Viomenil, 
the enemy receded. On the twenty-ninth of September, 
the Americans took their ground in front and on the left of 
their works, and kept up a light and scattering fusilade. 
The enemy, apprehensive they would get between their 
outworks and the town, evacuated the greater part of them 
on the following day, and they were occupied by the Ame- 
rican light infantry, supported by their allies. During the 



HAMILTON. 381 

ensuing days, the besiegers were engaged in throwing up 
redoubts, which was effected with great intrepidity, under 
a heavy cannonade. 

On the sixth of October, the army moved forward, and 
opened their first parallel, within six hundred yards of the 
enemy, under cover by day light. Hamilton now moved 
his corps of light infantry into the works, and planted their 
standards on the top of the line of the parallel. On the 
ninth and tenth, six heavy batteries, three French and three 
American, opened a heavy fire on the British, which dis- 
mounted some of their guns, injured their embrasures, and 
compelled them to shelter their cannon behind the merlons. 
This was followed by an almost entire suspension of the 
fire, and the loss of their heaviest vessel, the Charon, a 
forty-four gun frigate, by a hot shot from the French bat- 
tery, which burnt to the water's edge, presenting, in a serene 
night, a magnificent and melancholy spectacle. 

On the evening of the eleventh, the second parallel was 
opened by Steuben's division, which was carried on within 
three hundred and sixty yards of the enemy's batteries, 
with amazing rapidity during the night ; while their shot 
and shells kept up a continual and dazzling blaze, and was 
completed on the succeeding day. 

It now became necessary to obtain possession of two de- 
tached redoubts, which were advanced on the left of the 
enemy, within three hundred yards in their front, which 
enfiladed the whole line of the American entrenchments, 
and were supposed to command the communication be- 
tween York and Gloucester. The heavy and incessant fire 
which had been poured in upon them, it was bejieved, had 
rendered them practicable, and it was determined to carry 
them by assault. The work on the extreme left to be 
forced by the American light infantry, comprising a part of 
La Fayette's division ; that on the right, by a detachment of 



THE LIFE OF 

French grenadiers and chasseurs, commanded by De Vio- 
menil. 

This was the opportunity for which Hamilton had so 
long, so eagerly hoped, of signalizing himself by some act 
of distinguished prowess. But he was on the point of 
losing it. The fourteenth of October was his tour of duty, 
but from a supposed precedence due to that part of the 
light infantry which had made the Virginian campaign, 
Washington had determined to give the attack to Colonel 
Barber. 

The moment Hamilton learned this arrangement, he left 
Major Fish, proceeded immediately to the General's quar- 
ters and remonstrated with him, claiming the right of the 
attack, as the officer on duty. His appeal was successful, 
and Hamilton returned in the highest spirits, exclaiming to 
Fish, " We have it ! we have it !" The disposition was then 
made to advance in two columns. The right composed of 
Gimat's battalion, and Hamilton's, under Major Fish. The 
left, under Laurens, with a small body of picked men, who 
was directed to take them in reverse. 

The redoubt, on the right, was to be attacked by a body 
of grenadiers, under Count Deux Fonts and Colonel 
L'Estrade, supported by the regiment of Gatinois : a dis- 
position intended to prevent any jealousy between the ar- 
mies, and to excite their emulation. 

The signal of attack was a shell from the American bat- 
tery, with a corresponding one from the French. 

As soon as the first shell reached its zenith, that from the 
French battery also ascended. Hamilton then gave the 
order to advance at the point of the bayonet, pushed forward, 
and before the rest of the corps had ascended the abatis, 
mounted over it, stood for a moment on the parapet, with 
three of his soldiers, encouraging the others to follow, and 
sprung into the ditch. Fish followed. Gimat, receiving a 
wound from the first sentinel as they were unmasking, was 



HAMILTON. 383 

compelled to retire. The American infantry, animated by 
the address and example of their leader, pressed on, with 
muskets unloaded and fixed bayonets. They soon reached 
the counterscarp, under a heavy and constant fire from the 
redoubt, and surmounting the abatis, ditch, and palisades, 
mounted the parapet, and leaped into the work. 

Hamilton, who had pressed forward, followed by the 
van guard under Mansfield, was, for a short time, lost sight 
of, and it was feared he had fallen : but he soon re-appear- 
ed, formed the troops in the redoubt, and as soon as it sur- 
rendered gave the command to Major Fish. 

The impetuosity of the attack carried all before it, and 
within nine minutes from the time the abatis was passed, 
the work was gained. " Not a gun," says La Fayette, " was 
fired. The ardour of the troops did not give time for the 
sappers to derange the abatis ; and owing to the conduct 
of the commander, and bravery of the men, the redoubt 
was stormed with uncommon rapidity."* " Few cases," 
says Washington, " have exhibited greater proofs of intre- 
pidity, coolness, and firmness, than were shown on this oc- 
casion." 

Colonel Barber's battalion, the first in the supporting co- 
lumn/'arrived at the moment the advance were getting over 
the works, and executed their orders with the utmost ala- 
crity, (the Colonel being slightly wounded,) while the rest 
of the division, under Muhlenburg and Hagen, advanced 
with admirable firmness, and formed their columns with 
perfect silence and order, under the fire of the enemy. 

The gallantry of the storm was not less distinguished 
than the humanity of the victors. In the midst of the 
works, as soon as Hamilton saw the enemy driven back, 



* " Colonel Hamilton, whose well-known talents and gallantry were most 
conspicuous. Our obligations to him, to Colonel Gimat, and Colonel Lau- 
rens, and to each and all the officers and men, are beyond expression." 



384 THE 1,1 1 i; OF 

he ordered his men to halt, and excepting in the charge at 
the onset, not a man was injured. An incident occurred 
as soon as they entered the redoubt, to which Hamilton re- 
fers in his report. " Incapable of imitating examples of 
barbarity, and forgetting recent provocations, the soldiery 
spared every man who ceased to fight." . 

Colonel Scammel, of the light infantry, while reconnoi- 
tering, a few days before, was surprised by a party of 
horse, and after he was taken was wantonly wounded, of 
which wound he died. When Colonel Campbell, who 
commanded the redoubt, advanced to surrender, a captain* 
who had served under Scammel, seized a bayonet, and 
drew back with the intent of plunging it into his breast, 
when Hamilton turned it aside, and Campbell; exclaiming, 
" I place myself under your protection," was made prisoner 
by Laurens.* 

* Doctor Gordon, whose statements are often erroneous, says, in speak- 
ing of this affair, " The light infantry of the Americans were command - 
ed by Marquis La Fayette, and the service was allotted to a select corps. 
The Marquis said to General Washington, ' The troops should retaliate on 
the British for the cruelties they have practised.' The General answered, 
1 You have full command, and may. order as you please.' The Marquis or- 
dered the party to remember New-London, and to retaliate by putting the 
men in the redoubt to the sword, after having carried it. ********* 
Lieutenant Colonel Laurens personally took the commanding officer. ' The 
Colonel's humanity and that of the Americans, so overcame their resentments 
that they spared the British. When bringing them off, as prisoners, they said 
among themselves, 'Why, how is this? We were ordered] to put them to 
death.' Being asked by others why they had not done it, they answered, ' We 
could not, when they begged so hard upon their knees for their lives.'" To 
this shameful fabrication, the attention of Colonel Hamilton was drawn. It is 
thus refuted : 

To the Editor of the Evening Post. 

New- York, August 10, 1802. 

SIR, 

Finding that a story, long since propagated, under circumstances wliich it 
was expected would soon consign it to oblivion, (and by which I have been 



HAMILTON. 385 

The redoubt on the right was also taken, but with less 
celerity, the Americans having the work in their posses- 
sion, and being regularly formed, while their allies were 
yet engaged in removing the abatis. 

The fate of the enemy was now decided. The second 
parallel was continued during the night, the two redoubts 
enveloped, and a line of communication opened with the 
first before break of day. As a last effort, a sortie was 
made, towards day-light of the sixteenth, which proved un- 
successful. 

Cornwallis, who knew the weakness of his defences, 
and had pla*. ^d his only hopes on succour from New- York, 
resolved to make a uv^peyate attempt to cross to Glouces- 
ter, intending to escape by land to New- York. Boats were 
prepared, and a part of the troops embarked;, when a vio- 
lent storm arose, which drove the boats down the rivei, r^ 
prevented the completion of his bold design. New batteries 
were now finished by the Americans; the whole works 
were mounted, and a heavy and irresistible cannonade en- 
complimented at the expense of Generals Washington and La Fayette,) hag 
of late been revived, and has acquired a degree of importance by being repeat- 
ed in different publications, as well in Europe as America, it becomes a duty to 
counteract its currency and influence by an explicit disavowal. 

The story imports in substance, that General La Fayette, with the appro- 
bation or connivance of General Washington, ordered me, as the officer who 
was to command the attack on a British redoubt, in the course of the siege of 
York Town, to put to death all those of the enemy who should happen to be 
taken in the redoubt, and that through motives of humanity I forbore to execute 
the order. 

Positively and unequivocally I declare, that no such nor similar order, nor 
any intimation nor hint resembling it, was ever by me received, or understood 
to have been given. 

It is needless to enter into an explanation of some occurrences on the occa- 
sion alluded to, which may be conjectured to have given rise to the calumny. 
It is enough to say, that they were entirely disconnected with any act of either 
of the Generals who have been accused. 

With esteem I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

sued. On the morning of the seventeenth, while the light 
infantry were in the trenches, the chamade was beat, and 
propositions for surrender made. It is related by Colonel 
Fish, that when the sealed packet addressed to Washing- 
ton, which was delivered to La Fayette, came in, the Ge- 
neral was riding along the line. He had passed Hamilton, 
and as soon as he had read the despatch, sent for him, and 
asked his opinion as to the terms. After a short time, a 
suspension of hostilities was agreed to, and the enemy capi- 
tulated ; Laurens, at the surrender, representing the Ame- 
rican army, both as an honour due to his distinguished me- 
rits, and to remind the British king, that h^, Whose father 
was a prisoner in the Tower, held iirnis hands the fate of 
the commander of his privies'.* 

Congratulations n w poured in upon Washington, and 
Xjjxm his allies, from every quarter of the country ; the pub- 
lic bodies vicing with each other, in an emulation of grati- 
tude. A vote of thanks was rapturously passed by con- 
gress, a marble column was ordered to be erected at York 
Town, in commemoration of the event, and special honours 
were conferred on both commanders. 

While receiving the warmest expressions of admiration 
from the whole army, Hamilton, thus modestly, in a letter 
written to soothe the anxiety of his wife, adverts to what 
had passed. " Two nights ago,f my Eliza, my duty and my 
honour obliged me to take a step in which your happiness 
was too much risked. I commanded an attack upon one 
of the enemy's redoubts ; we carried it in an instant, and 
with little loss. You will see the particulars in the Phila- 
delphia papers. There will be, certainly, nothing more of 
this kind ; all the rest will be by approach ; and if there 
should be another occasion, it will not fall to my turn to 
execute it." 

* Cornwallis was, it is believed, at this time Constable of the Tower, 
f October 16th. 



HAMILTON. 887 

Washington, anxious to push his advantages, solicited 
De Grasse to co-operate in the relief of Wilmington and 
Charleston. The former object was at first assented to ; 
but the French admiral conceiving it his duty to return to 
the West Indies, changed his views. The plan was aban- 
doned, and after having completed the arrangements for 
the disposal of the captured army, while the French re- 
mained in Virginia, the Americans returned to the north, 
and were cantoned, in the latter part of November, in 
New-Jersey and in New- York. 

Washington, having concerted measures for the next 
campaign in a personal interview with congress, revisited 
Mount Vernon, loaded with laurels, and crowned with glo- 
ry, while Hamilton returned on furlough to his home. 

Gratifying as had been the result of this campaign, which 
sealed the national independence, and proud as were his 
reflections in reviewing the long series of services he had 
rendered his country, and in being connected so conspicu- 
ously with an event which may be regarded as the closing 
scene of the revolution, yet those reflections were not un- 
mingled with others of a deeply painful character. Though, 
with every uncorrupted mind, he deplored the miseries of 
war,* yet long service had confirmed in his bosom a fond- 
ness for military life. As an eloquent friend has well re- 
marked, " his early education was in the camp ; there his 
earliest and most cordial friendships were formed ; there 
he became enamoured of glory, and was admitted to her 

* Iu a letter to a friend, written after the close of the campaign of 1776, ha 
observes : " Your sentiments respecting war are perfectly just I don't wonder 
at your antipathy to it. Every fine feeling of a delicate mind revolts from the 
idea of shedding human blood, and multiplying the common evils of life by 
the artificial methods incident to that state. Were it not for the evident ne- 
cessity, and in defence of all that is valuable in society, I could never be re- 
conciled to a military character, and shall rejoice when the restoration of 
peace, on the basis of freedom and independence, shall put it in my power to 
renounce it" 



388 THE HFE OF 

embrace."* This life was now soon to end, and those 
friendships, so warmly cherished, could be cultivated only 
at intervals. 

Knowing also that the army was not a favourite of con- 
gress, he could not but survey, for the last time, with pain, 
the war-worn faces of those faithful men, who, while win- 
ning the liberties of their country, had won for her such im- 
perishable renown, requited, as he felt they were to be, by 
the grossest ingratitude. 

Of his immediate companions in the family of Washing- 
ton, with two he had already parted. Early in the year, 
Meade, who had recently married, retired from the service, 
and except by his gallantry in rushing to the aid of Steuben, 
and repulsing the advances of Arnold from his native state, 
was no longer known as a public man. 

The " Old Secretary," Harrison, as he was familiarly call- 
ed, left the army the previous spring, having been appoint- 
ed, by the state of Maryland, Chief Justice of its Supreme 
Court ; which situation he filled until the adoption of the 
Federal Constitution, when such was Washington's estimate 
of the claims of this meritorious individual upon his country, 
that he nominated him a Judge of the Supreme Court of 
the United States, immediately after its organization, which 
he declined.f 

* Fisher Ames. 

t The following letter, written by Colonel Harrison to Hamilton, as a vin- 
dication of his motives for leaving the army, may not be deemed inappropriate, 
as an act of justice to an early friend. 

"New-Windsor, , 1781. 

"I came here, my dear Hamilton, on Friday night to bid adieu to the Gene- 
ral, to you, and to my other friends as a military man, and regretted much that 
I had not the happiness of seeing you. To-morrow I am obliged to depart, 
and it is possible our separation may be forever. But be this as it may, it can 
only be with respect to our persons, for as to affection, mine for you will con- 
tinue to my latest breath. This event will probably surprise you, but from 
your knowledge of me, I rely you will conclude at the instant, that no light 



HAMILTON. 389 

Tilghman, McIIenry, and Laurens remained in the ser- 
vice. 

The first, whose social virtues were only equalled by his 
military daring, continued with the com mander-in-chief un- 
til his resignation, from whom he received the warmest ac- 
knowledgements of gratitude. He then established himself 
in Baltimore, where he died in seventeen hundred and eigh- 
ty-six. 

McHenry, whom Hamilton described " as sensible, judi- 
cious, well informed, of an intrepidity never questioned, and 
of a temper, which though firm in the support of principles, 
was full of moderation and amenity," returned to Maryland, 
where he exercised a salutary influence in the councils of 
that state, filled a seat in congress a short time, and closed 
his public life as Secretary at War. 

But the individual who held the first place in Hamilton's 

considerations would have taken me from the army ; and, I think, I might 
safely have rested the matter here. However, as the friendship between us, 
gives you a claim to something more, and as I am not indifferent about cha- 
racter, and shall be anxious to have the esteem of all who are good and virtu- 
ously great, I shall detail to you, my friend, the more substantial reasons which 
have led to my present conduct. I go from the army, then, because I have 
found, on examination, that my little fortune, earned by an honest and hard 
industry, was becoming embarrassed ; to attend to the education of my chil- 
dren ; to provide, if possible, for the payment of a considerable sum of money, 
with which I stand charged in the partition of my father's estate ; to save a 
house which I had begun, and without instant attention would be ruined ; and 
because the state of Maryland, in a flattering manner, have been pleased to 
appoint me to a place, very respectable in its. nature, corresponding with my 
former, and interesting to my whole future life and support : they have ap- 
pointed me to the chair of the Supreme Court. These, my friend, are the mo- 
tives to my present resolution. My own feelings are satisfied on the occasion, 
though I cannot but regret parting with the most valuable acquaintances I 
have, and I hope they will justify me most fully to you, my Hamilton, espe- 
pecially when you consider the time I have been in the service, and the com- 
pensation I have received * * *. Adieu. 

" Yours, in haste, most affectionately, 

"R.OBT. H. HARRISON-."

affections was Laurens,with whom he now parted, not again 
to meet. 

This heroic soldier joined the army in the beginning of 
seventeen hundred and seventy-seven ; distinguished him- 
self at Brandywine, and at Germantown only retired after 
an impetuous, though unadvised attempt upon Chew's house, 
from which Hamilton endeavoured to dissuade him, after 
having received a severe wound, and having left two-thirds 
of his men upon the field. 

At Monmouth, where every member of Washington's staff 
contended not only for their country, but for the honour of 
their chief, he was conspicuous in leading the soldiers to the 
charge, and rallying them on the retreat. At Rhode-Island, 
he commanded a regiment of infantry, and received the es- 
pecial thanks of Sullivan for his order and gallantry. 

He was incessantly employed in various operations while 
at the south. At the siege of Savannah, he gave a singular 
instance of his high-wrought feelings. After the defeat, he 
stood lost in abstraction, with his arms wide extended, in 
the midst of a heavy fire, and replied to a remonstrance on 
his rashness, " My honour does not permit me to survive the 
disgrace of this day ;" and was only recalled to his duty, by 
a peremptory order to cover the retreat. At Charleston, 
he sallied from the town, and frequently repulsed the be- 
siegers, and was again wounded. Having twice received 
the thanks of congress, he returned, after the surrender at 
York Town, to Carolina, where hearing of the approach of 
a party of the enemy, he arose from his sick bed, threw 
himself at the head of his corps, and fell in a trifling skir- 
mish near the banks of the Combahee. A short time before 
his death, he writes to Hamilton, complaining " that the ene- 
my's system was perfectly defensive, and rendered the cam- 
paign insipid. Many of our sanguine citizens have flatter- 
ed themselves with the idea of a prompt evacuation of 
Charleston. I wish the garrison would either withdraw or 



HAMILTON. 391 

fight us. Adieu, my dear friend. While circumstances 
place so great a distance between us, I entreat you not to 
withdraw the consolation of your letters. You know the 
unalterable sentiments of your affectionate Laurens." 

Of all the youthful soldiers of the revolution, there is not 
one upon whose story the recollections of his contemporaries 
have more fondly dwelt. His distinguished place in the 
affections of Washington, and the repeated public honours 
proffered to him by congress, his numerous and varied ser- 
vices, his address in negotiation, his gallantry in battle, his 
exalted zeal, and his lofty spirit, elevated him so far above 
his fellow-soldiers, that at his name every youthful aspira- 
tion of ambition was kindled. 

But Laurens was not alone a gallant soldier, a distinguish- 
ed patriot, a skilful diplomatist. To these he added all the 
endearing and social affections, all the attractions of a noble 
nature, all the graces of a refined and cultivated intellect, 
and an address which possessed an irresistable, an endless 
charm. 

Qualities which in other men might have offended by 
their contrast, in him only served to give richness of cha- 
racter, and create variety of interest. His intrepid spirit 
was coupled with a self-distrust, a confiding weakness of 
temper, which awakened in his friends surprise and love. 
While to others his heart was all kindness and benevolence, 
he was unjust only to himself; and while the world saw 
him graced with every virtue, he was still aspiring to some 
higher excellence, an ideal perfection, which is denied to 
our nature, and exists only in the warm conceptions of a 
mind deeply tinged with romance. Nothing can more fully 
express this inward struggle for superior excellence, than 
his letter to Hamilton, and the latter's elegant rebuke, that 
" he refined on the refinements of sensibility." 

With a bosom not less alive to the most generous emo- 
tions, but with a mind of a firmer texture, Hamilton repro- 



392 THE LIFE OF 

ved, in the noble spirit of his friend, an excess of that deli- 
cacy which he himself cherished. 

In the intercourse of these martial youths, there was a 
deep fondness of friendship, which approached the tender- 
ness of feminine attachment. On the annunciation of his 
sad fate, Hamilton writes to La Fayette, " Poor Laurens ! 
he has fallen a sacrifice to his ardour, in a 1 rifling skirmish 
in South Carolina. You know how truly I loved him, and 
will judge how much I regret him." 

This simple tribute of affection, conveyed a deeper mean- 
ing than is expressed ; for while his country deplored the 
untimely fate of this their favourite youth, cut off in the ca- 
reer of honour, his friend knew the deep wound he had re- 
ceived at an early period of his life, and that there was that 
upon his memory which made the latest moment the most 
desired of his existence.

CHATTER XV. 

[1732.J 

,-2- 

AT the close of the year, Hamilton, as has been previously 
mentioned, returned to Albany. 

There, amidst a circle of friends, to whom his social vir- 
tues more endeared him than the lustre of his reputation, 
he, whose lot from infancy had been cast among strangers, 
enjoyed all the happiness of finding in General Schuyler 
and his family a second parent, and new relatives. 

In this hospitable abode he remained until the ensuing 
spring, mingling cheerfully with the small society of a place, 
where a simplicity of manners then prevailed, almost patri- 
archal; and strengthening the intimacy he had already 
formed with Schuyler, who saw, with pride, the develope- 
ment of the powers of his mind, and with whom his life 
was a continued scene of uninterrupted regard, harmony, 
and confidence, j 

Although no definitive opinion could be formed in the 
course of the winter, as to the conclusion of a treaty, and 
the measures of congress, prompted by the zealous exhor- 
tations of General Washington, indicated a determination 
to prepare for a vigorous prosecution of the war, which the 
proceedings of the English parliament, at the beginning of 
its session evinced no disposition to discontinue, yet the 
advices received by Colonel Hamilton from the Marquis 
De La Fayette, who was in close conference with the Ame- 
rican negotiators, and lending all his influence to promote 
their views, and from the Viscount De Noailles, of the tem- 
per of the continental powers, with the situation of the Bri- 
tish army in the northern states, gave little reason to ex- 
pect an active campaign in that quarter. 

VOL. i. 50 . 



394 THE LIFE OF 

The birth of a son imposed on him new obligations; and, 
influenced by these considerations, he determined to pre- 
pare himself for the duties of private life. He selected the 
profession of the law, a pursuit which was justly deemed 
the most honourable in the country, and in which had been 
formed the largest number of its most conspicuous charac- 
ters. 

On the first intimation of this purpose, his friends, un- 
willing to lose his services to the public, strongly urged 
him to defer his purpose. The idea of his being appointed 
a commissioner to conclude a peace, w r as suggested to him, 
and the slow advances of the legal profession, in an impo- 
verished and inactive community were depicted, to deter him 
from making what was then deemed a sacrifice. 

But his ideas of personal independence, induced him to 
decline the most generous offers of aid from Schuyler, and 
to the dark professional prospects which were held up, he 
replied, with a modest, but confident expression of his re- 
liance on the certainties of perseverance, f 

With these views, he proceeded to Philadelphia, and, al- 
though his sole resources were in himself, addressed the fol- 
lowing letters to General Washington, strongly illustrative 
of the pride and disinterestedness of his character. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
SIR, 

I need not observe to your excellency, that respect for 
the opinion of congress will not permit me to be indifferent 
to the impressions they may receive of my conduct. On 
this principle, though I do not think the subject of the en- 
closed letter of sufficient importance to request an official 
communication of it, yet I should be happy it might in some 
way be known to the members of that honourable body. 
Should they hereafter learn, that though retained on the 
list of their officers, I am not in the execution of the duties 



HAMILTON. 395 

of my station, I wish them to be sensible, that it is not a di- 
minished zeal which induces me voluntarily to withdraw 
my services, but that I only refrain from intruding them, 
when circumstances seem to have made them either not ne- 
cessary, or not desired ; and that I shall not receive emolu- 
ments, without performing the conditions to which they 
were annexed. I also wish them to be apprized, upon 
what footing my future continuance in the army is placed, 
that they may judge how far it is expedient to permit it. I 
therefore take the liberty to request the favour of your ex- 
cellency to impart the knowledge of my situation, in such 
manner as you think most convenient. 
I have the honour to be, 

With perfect respect, 
Your excellency's 

Most obedient and humble servant. 

HAMILTON TO WASHINGTON. 
SIR, 

Your excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the 
force of this sentiment, that though it is the duty of a good 
citizen to devote his services to the public, when it has oc- 
casion for them, he cannot, with propriety or delicacy to 
himself, obtrude them, when it either has, or appears to 
have, none. 

The difficulties I experienced last campaign in obtaining 
a command, will not suffer me to make any farther applica- 
tion on that head. 

As I have many reasons to consider my being employed 
hereafter in a precarious light, the bare possibility of render- 
ing an equivalent, will not justify to my scruples, the receiv- 
ing any future emoluments from my commission. I there- 
fore renounce, from this time, all claim to the compensations 
attached to my military station during the war, or after it. 
But I have motives which will not permit me to resolve on 



396 THE MFE OF 

a total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous train of 
affairs may continue to make rt no inconvenience to decline 
the services of persons, whose zeal in worse times was found 
not altogether useless ; but as the most promising appear- 
ances are often reversed by unforeseen disasters, and as un- 
fortunate events may again make the same zeal of some 
value, I am unwilling to put it out of my power to renew 
my exertions in the common cause, in the line in which I 
have hitherto acted. 

I shall, accordingly, retain my rank, while I am permit- 
ted to do it ; and take this opportunity to declare, that I shall 
be at all times ready to obey the call of the public, in any 
capacity, civil or military, (consistent with what I owe to 
myself,) in which there may be a prospect of my contribut- 
ing to the final attainment of the object for which I em- 
barked in the service. I have the honour to be, 
Very respectfully, 

Your excellency's 

Most obedient servant, 

A. HAMILTON. 

Philadelphia, March 1, 1782. 

While at Philadelphia, he received a letter relating to the 
same subject, from his friend Colonel Meade, to which the 
following is a reply. 



Philadelphia, March, 178?. 

An half hour since brought me the pleasure of your let- 
ter of December last. It went to Albany and came from 
thence to this place. I heartily felicitate you on the birth 
of your daughter. I can well conceive your happiness upon 
that occasion, by that which I feel on a similar one. 

Indeed, the sensations of a tender father of the child of a 



HAMILTON. 897 

beloved mother, can only be conceived by those who have 
experienced them. 

Your heart, my Meade, is peculiarly formed for enjoy- 
ments of this kind. You have every right to be a happy 
husband, a happy father. You have every prospect of be- 
ing so. I hope your felicity may never be interrupted. 

You cannot imagine how entirely domestic I am grow- 
ing. I lose all taste for the pursuits of ambition. I sigh 
for nothing but the company of my wife and my baby. The 
ties of duty alone, or imagined duty, keep me from renoun- 
cing public life altogether. It is, however, probable, I may 
not be any longer actively engaged in it. 

I have explained to you the difficulties which I met with 
in obtaining a command last campaign. I thought it in- 
compatible with the delicacy due* to myself to make any 
application this campaign. I have expressed this senti- 
ment in a letter to the General, and, retaining my rank only, 
have relinquished the emoluments of my commission, de- 
claring myself, notwithstanding, ready at all times to obey 
the calls of the public. I do not expect to hear any of 
these, unless the state of our affairs should change for the 
worse, and lest, by any unforeseen accident that should 
happen, I choose to keep myself in a situation again to con- 
tribute my aid. This prevents a total resignation. 

You were right in supposing I neglected to prepare what 
I promised you. at Philadelphia. The truth is, I was in 
such a hurry to get home, that I could think of nothing else. 
As I set out to-morrow morning for Albany, I cannot, 
from this place, send you the matter you wish. 

Imagine, my dear Meade, what pleasure it must give 
Eliza and myself to know that Mrs. Meade interests herself 
in us. Without a personal acquaintance, we have been 
long attached to her. My visit at Mr. Fitzhugh's confirmed 
my partiality. Betsey is so fond of your family, that she 
proposes to form a match between her boy and your girl, 



398 THE LIFE OF 

provided you will engage to make the latter as amiable as 
her mother. 

Truly, my dear Meade, I often regret that fortune has 
cast our residence at such a distance from each other. It 
would be a serious addition to my happiness if we lived 
where I could see you every day ; but fate has determined 
it otherwise. I am a little hurried, and can only request, 
in addition, that you will present me most affectionately to 
Mrs. Meade, and believe me to be, with the warmest and 
most unalterable friendship, 

Yours, 

A. HAMILTON. 

Having completed his business at Philadelphia, he return- 
ed to Albany ; took a house in the vicinity of General Schuy- 
ler, to which he invited, as an inmate, his friend Colonel 
Troup, who had previously studied the law, and with his 
aid commenced to prepare himself for the practice of it. 

To this dull pursuit, so foreign to all his previous habits, 
such was his control of the powers of his intellect, that he 
devoted himself with the most unremitting labour. His 
retentive memory was tasked to its utmost. His habit 
was to read while walking to and fro, and so incessant were 
his labours, that his intimates would smile at the idea, that 
while prosecuting this study, with the same diligence, he 
might almost have inarched from one end to the other of 
the confederacy. At the ensuing July term of the supreme 
court, he obtained a licence to practise. 

Such was the knowledge he acquired during this short 
period of four months, " that he composed a Manual on the 
Practice of the Law," which, says Troup, " served as an 
instructive grammar to future students, and became the 
ground-work of subsequent enlarged practical treatises."* 

* There are gentlemen, now living, who copied this manual as their guide. 



HAMILTON. 399 

In the preceding autumn congress had recommended to 
the several states to levy a separate tax for continental re- 
quisitions, and had invested the Superintendent of Finance 
with the power of appointing an officer in each state to re- 
ceive these taxes ; an idea not improbably suggested by 
Hamilton's letter of September, 1780, intimating the im- 
portance of appointing in each state a " continental super- 
intendent." While engaged in the prosecution of his legal 
studies, he received the following letter from Robert Mor- 
ris. 

ROBERT MORRIS TO HAMILTON. 

Office of Finance, Philadelphia, May 2d, 1782. 
" SIR, 

" Mr. Charles Stuart, late commissary general of issues, 
has informed me that you are disposed to quit the military 
line, for the purpose of entering into civil life. He, at the 
same time, induced me to believe that you would accept the 
office of receiver of the continental taxes in the state of New- 
York. The intention of this letter is to offer you that ap- 
pointment. The duties of the office will appear, in a great 
degree, from the publications made by me on this subject. 
In addition, it will be necessary that you correspond with 
me frequently, and give accurate accounts of whatever 
may be passing in your state, which it may be necessary 
for this office to be acquainted with. For the trouble of 
executing it, I shall allow a fourth per cent, on the monies 
you receive. The amount of the quota called for from 
New-York for the current year is, as you know, three hun- 
dred and seventy-three thousand five hundred and ninety- 
eight dollars. 

" I make no professions of my confidence and esteem, be- 
cause I hope none are necessary ; but if they are, my wish 



400 THE LIFE OF 

that you would accept the offer I make, is the strongest 
evidence I can give of them." 

Hamilton made the following reply. " I had this day the 
honour of receiving your letter of the second instant, and 
am much obliged by the mark of your confidence which it 
contains, and to Colonel Stuart for his friendly intentions 
upon the occasion. 

" My military situation has indeed become so negative, 
that I have no motives to continue in it, and if my services 
could be of importance to .the public in any civil line, I 
should cheerfully obey its command. But the plan which 
I have marked out for myself is the profession of the law, 
and I am now engaged in a course of studies for that purpose. 
Time is so precious to me, that I could not put myself in 
the way of any interruptions, unless for an object of con- 
sequence to the public or to myself. The present is not of 
this nature. Such are the circumstances of this state, that 
the benefit arising from the office you propose, would not, 
during the war, yearly exceed one hundred pounds ; for 
unfortunately, I am persuaded, it will not pay annually into 
the continental treasury forty thousand pounds ; and on a 
peace establishment this will not be, for some time to come, 
more than doubled. You will perceive that an engage- 
ment of this kind does not correspond with my views, and 
does not afford a sufficient inducement to relinquish them. 

" I am not the less sensible to the obliging motives which 
dictated the offer, and it will be an additional one to the 
respect and esteem with which I have the honour to be, 
very truly, sir, 

" Your most obedient and humble servant." 

On the fourth of June Mr. Morris wrote to him, acknow- 
ledging the receipt of this letter, and stating, " I am much 
obliged by the friendly sentiments you express for me, 



HAMILTON. 401 

which, be assured, I shall retain a grateful sense of. I see 
with you, that the office I had the pleasure of offering, will 
not be equal to what your own abilities will gain in the profes- 
sion of the law ; but I did intend that the whole sum should 
have been paid, although the whole quota of the taxes had 
not been collected by the state ; consequently, the object 
is greater than you supposed, and the business might proba- 
bly be effected without more attention than you could spare 
from your studies. If so, I should still be happy in your 
acceptance, and will leave the matter open until I have an 
opportunity of hearing from you upon the subject." 
To which Hamilton gave the following answer : 

HAMILTON TO MORRIS. 

SIR, 

* * * * The explanation which you give of your inten- 
tion, in your late offer, makes it an object that will com- 
pensate fully for the time that it will deduct from my other 
occupations. In accepting it, I have only one scruple, 
arising from a doubt whether the service I can render in 
the present state of things, will be an equivalent for the 
compensation. The whole system, (if it may be so called,) 
of taxation in this state, is radically vicious, burthensome 
to the people, and unproductive to government. As the 
matter now stands, there seems to be little for a continen- 
tal receiver to do. The whole business appears to be 
thrown into the hands of the county treasurers ; nor do I 
find that there is any appropriation made of any part of the 
taxes collected for continental purposes, or any provision 
to authorize payment to the officer you appoint. This, 
however, must be made. There is only one way in which 
I c*an imagine a prospect of being materially useful ; that 
is, in seconding your applications to the state. In popu- 
lar assemblies much may sometimes be brought about by 
personal discussions, by entering into details, and combat- 

VOL. I. 51 



402 THE LIFE OF 

ing objections as they rise. If it should, at any time, be 
thought advisable by you to empower me to act in this ca- 
pacity, I shall be happy to do every thing that depends 
upon me to effectuate your views. I flatter myself, to you, 
sir, I need not profess that I suggest this, not from a desire 
to augment the importance of office, but to advance the 
public interest. 

It is of primary moment to me, as soon as possible to 
take my station in the law, and on this consideration I am 
pressing to qualify myself for admission the next term, 
which will be the latter end of July. After this, should you 
think an interview necessary, I will wait upon you in Phila- 
delphia. In the mean time, I shall be happy to receive your 
instructions, and shall direct my attention more particularly 
to acquiring whatever information may be useful to my fu- 
ture operations. I have read your publications at different 
times, but as I have not the papers containing them in my 
possession, it will be necessary that their contents should 
be comprised in your instructions. A meeting of the legis- 
lature is summoned early in the next month, at which, if I 
previously receive your orders, it may be possible to put 
matters in train. I am truly indebted to you, sir, for the 
disposition you have manifested upon this occasion, and I 
shall only add an assurance of my endeavours to justify your 
confidence. 

ALEX. HAMILTON. 

On the second of July following, Mr. Morris writes, en- 
closing the warrant of appointment and instructions, to 
which he adds the following observations : "It gives me 
singular pleasure, to find that you have yourself pointed out 
one of the principal objects of your appointment. You will 
find that it is specified in the enclosure. I must request 
you to exert your talents, in forwarding with your legisla- 
ture the views of congress. Your former situation in the 



HAMILTON. 403 

army, the present situation of that very army, your con- 
nexions in the state, your perfect knowledge of men and 
measures, and the abilities with which heaven has blessed 
you, will give you a fine opportunity to forward the public 
service, by convincing the legislature of the necessity of co- 
pious supplies, and by convincing all who have claims on 
the justice of congress, that those claims exist only by that 
hard necessity which arises from the negligence of the 
states. When to this you shall superadd the conviction, 
that what remains of the war being a war of finance, solid 
arrangements of finance must necessarily terminate favour- 
ably, not only to our hopes, but even to our wishes. Then, 
sir, the governments will be disposed to lay, and the people 
to bear those burthens which are necessary ; and then the 
utility of your office, and of the officer, will be as manifest 
to others as at present to me." 

On the receipt of this communication, Hamilton wrote 
the following letter, 

HAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

"I shall to-morrow morning commence a journey to 
Poughkeepsie, where the legislature are assembled, and I 
will endeavour, by every step in my power, to second your 
views, though I am sorry to add, without very sanguine ex- 
pectations. I think it probable the legislature will do some- 
thing, but whatever momentary effort they make, till the 
entire change of their present system, very little will be 
done. To effect this, mountains of prejudice and particu- 
lar interest are to be levelled. For my own part, consi- 
dering the late serious misfortune to our ally, the spirit of 
reformation, of wisdom, and of unanimity, which seems to 
have succeeded to that of blunder, perverseness, and dis- 
sension in the British government, and the universal reluc- 
tance of these states to do what is right, I cannot help view- 



404 THE LIFE OF 

ing our situation as critical, and I feel it the duty of every 
citizen to exert his faculties to the utmost to support the 
measures, especially those solid arrangements of finance, 
on which our safety depends. 

" It is not in the spirit of compliment, but of sincerity, I 
assure you, that the opinion I entertain of him who presides 
in the department, was not one of the smallest motives to 
my acceptance of the office, nor will that esteem and con- 
fidence which makes me -now sensibly feel the obliging ex- 
pressions of your letter, fail to have a great share in influ- 
encing my future exertions." 

On his arrival at Poughkeepsie, Hamilton addressed a 
letter, on the sixteenth July, to Governor Clinton, apprizing 
him of his appointment, and requesting the legislature to 
vest in him the necessary authority ; stating that it was " a 
part of his duty, to explain to the legislature, from time to 
time, the views of the Superintendent of Finance, in pursu- 
ance of the orders of congress, that they may be the better 
enabled to judge of the measures most proper to be adopt- 
ed for an effectual co-operation, and asking his excellency 
to impart his request, to have the honour of a conference 
withra committee of the two houses." 

This body had been convened, in an extra session, at the 
express instance of a committee of congress, and was open- 
ed with a forcible message from the Governor, urging the 
importance of a revisal of the tax laws, and calling upon 
the legislature to denounce the attempts of the British go- 
vernment to make separate treaties with the states, as a 
measure inevitably to be attended with ruin and infamy, 
and pressing the importance of the most strenuous exer- 
tions to expel the enemy from their territory, to which an 
answer, prepared by General Schuyler, who was the leader 
in the senate, responded in the strongest terms. On the 
twentieth July, the senate adopted a series of resolutions, 



HAMILTON. 405 

declaring their opinion, " that the present system of these 
states exposes the cause to a precarious issue ; that the 
radical source of most of the embarrassments is the want 
of sufficient power in congress to effectuate that ready and 
perfect co-operation of the different states, on which their 
immediate safety and future happiness depends ; that ex- 
perience had demonstrated the confederation to be defect- 
ive in several essential points, particularly in not vesting 
the federal government, either with a power of providing 
revenue for itself, or with ascertained and productive funds, 
secured by a sanction so solemn and general, as would in- 
spire the fullest confidence in them, and make them a sub- 
stantial basis of credit ; and that it is essential to the com- 
mon welfare, that there should be, as soon as possible, a 
conference of the whole states on the subject, and that it 
would be advisable, for this purpose, to propose to congress 
to recommend, and to each state to adopt, the measure of 
assembling a general convention of the states, specially au- 
thorized to revise and amend the confederation, reserving 
a right to the respective legislatures to ratify their deter- 
minations." 

These resolutions, in which the hand of Hamilton so dis- 
tinctly appears, were adopted unanimously,* and within 
two days after, a joint committee of both houses was, at his 
instance, appointed to report, at the next session, a system 
for establishing such funds, within the state, as were best 
suited to answer its purposes -and those of the United 
States, and for the more effectual collection of taxes, at 
the head of which was General Schuyler, through whose 
influence Hamilton was, on the same day, elected a Dele- 
gate to congress. 

It is interesting, in the progress of this work, to remark, 
that to him who had so long laboured to impress on others 

* July 22d, 1782. 



406 THE LIFE OF 

the importance of a new organization of the government, 
and who had so large a share in its formation, adoption, 
and exposition, is to be attributed, with the aid of Schuy- 
ler, the first action of the state of New-York, towards this 
primary object.* In a letter to Mr. Morris, of this date, 
Hamilton thus speaks of the result of his exertions : 

HAMILTON TO ROBERT MORRIS. 

" Poughkecpsie, July 22, 1782. 
" SIR, 

. " Agreeable to my letter to you from Albany, I came to 
this place, and had an interview with a committee of the 
legislature, in which I urged the several matters contained 
in your instructions. I strongly represented the necessity 
of solid arrangements of finance, and by way of argument, 
pointed out all the defects of the present system. I found 
every man convinced that something was wrong, but few 
that were willing to recognise the mischief when defined, 
and consent to the proper remedy. The quantum of taxes 
already imposed is so great, as to make it useless to impose 
any others to a considerable amount ; a bill has, however, 
passed both houses, payable in specie, bank notes, or your 
notes, for eighteen thousand pounds. 

"It is at present appropriated to your order, but I doubt 
whether some subsequent arrangement will not take place 
for a different appropriation. The commander-in-chief has 
applied for a quantity of forage, which the legislature is de- 
vising the means of furnishing, and I fear it will finish by 
diverting the eighteen thousand pounds to that purpose. I 
have, hitherto, been able to prevent this ; but as it is of 
indispensable importance to me to leave this place imme- 
diately, to prepare for an examination, for which I have 
pledged myself the ensuing term, which is at hand, it is 

* It is believed to be the first proceeding of any state on this subject. 



HAMILTON. 407 

possible, after I have left it, contrary ideas will prevail. 
Efforts have been made to introduce a species of negotiable 
certificates, which I have strenuously opposed. It has not 
yet taken place, but I am not clear how the matter will 
terminate. Should the bill for the eighteen thousand 
pounds go out, in its present form, I cannot hope that it 
will produce in the treasury above half the sum, such are 
the vices of our present mode of collection. A bill has 
also passed the assembly, for collecting arrearages of taxes, 
payable in specie, bank notes, your notes, old continental 
emissions at one hundred and twenty-eight for one, and a 
species of certificates issued by the state, for the purchase 
of horses. This is now before the senate ; the arrearages 
are very large. 

" Both houses have unanimously passed a set of resolu- 
tions, to be transmitted to congress and the several states, 
proposing a convention of the states, to enlarge the powers 
of congress, and vest them with funds. I think this a very 
eligible step, though I doubt of the concurrence of the other 
states ; but I am certain without it, they never will be 
brought to co-operate in any reasonable or effectual plan. 
Urge reforms or exertions, and the answer constantly is, 
what avails it for one state to make them, without the con- 
sent of the others ? It is in vain to expose the futility of this 
reasoning. It is founded on all those passions which have 
the strongest influence on the human mind. 

" The legislature have also appointed, at my instance, a 
committee to devise, in its recess, a more effectual system 
of taxation, and to communicate with me on this subject. 
A good deal will depend on the success of this attempt. 
Convinced of the absurdity of multiplying taxes in the pre- 
sent mode, when in effect the payment is voluntary, and 
the money received exhausted in the collection, I have la- 
boured chiefly to instil the necessity of a change in the 



408 THE LIFE OF 

plan, and though not so rapidly as the exigency of public 
affairs requires, truth seems to be making some progress. 

" There is no other appropriation to the use of congress 
than of the eighteen thousand pounds. 

"I shall, as soon as possible, give you a full and just view 
of the situation and temper of this state. This cannot be 
till after my intended examination ; that over, I shall lay 
myself out in every way that can promote your views, and 
the public good. I am informed, you have an appointment 
to make of a commissioner of accounts for this state. Per- 
mit me to suggest the expediency of choosing a citizen of 
the state, a man who, to the qualifications requisite for the 
execution of the office, adds an influence in its affairs. I 
need not particularize the reasons for this suggestion. In 
my next I will also take the liberty to mention some cha- 
racters. I omitted mentioning, that the two houses have 
also passed a bill, authorizing congress to adjust the quotas 
of the states, on equitable principles, agreeable to your re- 
commendation." 

After the adjournment of the legislature, and his admis- 
sion to the bar, Hamilton devoted himself assiduously to the 
duties which the urgent solicitations of Mr. Morris earnest- 
ly pressed. 

The pictures which are given in his letters of this period 
are of the most gloomy cast. Double sets of officers, 
with conflicting powers and duties, clogging their respec- 
tive operations ; taxes, far beyond the ability of the peo- 
ple, to be collected through a medium reduced to the low- 
est point, and almost consumed in the process of collection ; 
while a general system of connivance and fraud pre- 
vailed in many of the subordinate departments, which fur- 
nished the strongest inducements to check the inquiries, 
and prevent the adoption of the suggestions of an officer, 



HAMILTON. 409 

whose office itself was an object of the most jealous repug- 
nance,* 

To overcome these difficulties was an herculean task ; 
but he engaged in it with all his characteristic patience of 
investigation. Though the evils were too extensive, and 
laid too deep to be reached by any other means than a total 
change of system, yet he hoped, by scrutinizing the whole 
train of abuses, such data might be obtained as would ena- 
ble the office of finance to apply efficient remedies, and gra- 
dually to infuse such opinions as would convince the state 
of its errors, and induce a radical change of policy. 

During the interval of the appointment and meeting of the 
committee, he was constantly engaged in extensive corres- 
pondences throughout the state ; in circulars to the county 
treasurers, to ascertain the receipts and expenses of collec- 
tion ; in communications with the army contractors, Messrs. 
Duer and Sands, to learn the amount of expenditures and 
the quantity of specie, and to promote the circulation and 
increase the value of the notes of the financier and of the 
bank, and in devising means to defer and lighten the de- 
mands on the general treasury. 

While thus employed in fulfilling the calls of the finan- 
cier, he used the estimate which he obtained, (the incom- 
pleteness of which he laments,) as a basis for digesting a 
new plan of state taxation, which he proposed to submit to 
the legislature. 

The rule adopted in the confederation, after much angry 
discussion, for fixing the quota of each state, had proved a 
source of great delay and controversy. The valuation of 
land which it prescribed, had been found impracticable, and 
congress had been compelled to adhere to the original sys- 
tem of requisitions, on the basis of the population, as com- 

* From an entry in the diary of Mr. Morris, it appears that as late as the 
twenty-ninth of August, 1782, a committee of inquiry, appointed by congress, 
questioned his reasons for appointing continental receivers.

puted m seventeen hundred and seventy-five. Each state 
took advantage of the inaccuracy of this enumeration, and 
found a ready excuse for the deficiency of their supplies in 
the incorrectness of the estimate. 

To avoid this difficulty, and at the same time to extend 
the system of taxation as far as was possible, in order to meet 
the demands of the public, Hamilton framed anelaborate bill, 
in which, agreeably to a resolution of congress of the prece- 
ding February, and to the report of the financier, he proposed 
to abolish the method which existed, of taxing by arbitrary 
quotas and assessments, a source of the greatest injustice 
and inequality, and substituting for it a system of specific 
taxation on lands, distinguished by their character, as mea- 
dow or arable ; on salt by the bushel ; on tobacco by the 
pound ; on carriages ; plate ; on licenses of various kinds ; 
on menial servants ; on houses ; and a rate of specific du- 
ties on imports. 

The bill embraces a very minute and systematic scheme 
to render the assessment and collection easy and secure ; and 
with a view to prevent the confusion and neglect which had 
resulted from the proceeds of the taxes being thrown into 
a general mass, he suggested the appropriation of them to 
various objects ; that upon land, to the support of the inter- 
nal government ; on carriages, to the judicial establishment ; 
the house tax to congress, for supplementary funds ; the 
salt, license, and tobacco tax, for constituting a loan office, 
which seems to have been connected with the incorporation 
of a bank, of which a portion of the income was to be secu- 
red to that office.* The surplus of these taxes, and all 
others, to form an aggregate fund for contingencies, to sup- 

* A plan for a state bank and state loan office, is found among the papers, 
which contemplated one state bank to control the currency ; the general 
banking to be conducted by private bankers. It is not in Hamilton's hand- 
writing, and some features of the plan render it probable that it was a project 
submitted for his consideration, but which he could not have approved. 



HAMILTON. 411 

ply the Federal treasury. A plan of a lottery was also at 
this time devised by him, containing many ingenious sug- 
gestions, and evincing singular care to prevent frauds, from 
which a considerable sum was hoped to be derived in aid 
of the finances ; a mode of taxation which had been pro- 
posed by a committee of congress in seventeen hundred and 
eighty ; but which the enlightened sentiment of the present 
age has ceased to approve. 

Having obtained a license as an attorney in July, he, 
notwithstanding his public duties, continued to prosecute 
his legal studies, in order to prepare for admission to the 
bar as a counsellor, at the ensuing October term of the Su- 
preme Court. A letter to his friend Meade, shows his views 
on this subject, and gives a* pleasing exhibition of his do- 
mestic feelings. 

HAMILTON TO MEADE. 

Albany, August 27tli, 1782. 

I thank you, my dear Meade, for your letter of the first 
of this month, which you will perceive has travelled much 
faster than has been usual with our letters. Our corres- 
pondence hitherto has been unfortunate, nor in fact can 
either of us compliment himself on his punctuality ; but you 
were right in concluding, that however indolence or acci- 
dent may interrupt our intercourse, nothing will interrupt 
our friendship. Mine for you is built on the solid basis of 
a full conviction that you deserve it, and that it is recipro- 
cal, and it is the more firmly fixed, because you have few 
competitors. Experience is a continued comment on the 
worthlessness of the human race, and the few exceptions 
we find, have the greater right to be valued in proportion as 
they are rare. I know few men estimable, fewer amia- 
ble, and when I meet with one of the last description, it is 
not in my power to withhold my affection. 

You reproach me with not having said enough about our 



412 THE LIFE OF 

little stranger. When I wrote last, I was not sufficiently 
acquainted with him to give you his character. I may now 
assure you, that your daughter, when she sees him, will not 
consult you about the choice, or will only do it in respect 
to the rules of decorum. He is truly a very fine young gen- 
tleman, the most agreeable in his conversation and manners 
of any I ever knew, nor less remarkable for his intelligence 
and sweetness of temper. You are not to imagine, by my 
beginning with his mental qualifications, that he is defect- 
ive in personal. It is agreed, on all hands, that he is hand- 
some ; his features are good, his eye is not only sprightly 
and expressive, but it is full of benignity. His attitude, in 
sitting is, by connoisseurs, esteemed graceful, and he has a 
method of waving his hand that announces the future ora- 
tor. He stands, however, rather awkwardly, and as his 
legs have not all the delicate slimness of his father's, it is 
feared he may never excel as much in dancing, which is 
probably the only accomplishment in which he will not be 
a model. If he has any fault in manners, he laughs too 
much. He has now passed his seventh month. 

I am glad to find your prospect of being settled ap- 
proaches. I am sure you will realize all the happiness you 
promise yourself with your amiable partner. I wish fortune 
had not cast our lots at such a distance. Mrs. Meade, you, 
Betsey, and myself, would make a most affectionate and 
most happy partie quarre. 

As to myself, I shall sit down in New-York, when it 
opens, and the period we are told approaches. No man 
looks forward to a peace with more pleasure than I do, 
though no man would sacrifice less to it than myself, if I 
were not convinced the people sigh for peace. I have been 
studying the law for some months, and have lately been 
licensed as an attorney. I wish to prepare myself by Octo- 
ber for examination as a counsellor, but some public avoca- 
tions may possibly prevent me. 



HAMILTON. 413 

I had. almost forgotten to tell you, that I have been pretty 
unanimously elected by the legislature of this state, a mem- 
ber of congress, to begin to serve in November. I do not 
hope to reform the state, although I shall endeavour to do 
all the good I can. 

Suffer Betsey and me to present our love to Mrs. Meade. 
She has a sisterly affection for you. My respects, if you 
please, to Mr. and Mrs. Fitzhugh. God bless you. 

A. HAMILTON. 

The committee of the legislature, of which he speaks in 
his letter to Mr. Morris, met on the fifteenth of September, 
and notwithstanding his labour in devising a system of taxa- 
tion, such were his doubts of the tone of the public, that in 
a letter written to Mr. Morris on the evening prior to their 
meeting, he says, " I am at a loss to know whether I ought 
to press the establishment of permanent funds or not, though 
unless I receive your instructions, following my own appre- 
hensions of what are probably your views, I shall dwell 
upon this article." 

On the fifth of October, he writes as follows: "In my 
last I informed you that the committee appointed by the 
legislature on the subject of taxation were together. 

" In spite of my efforts, they have parted without doing 
any thing decisive. They have, indeed, agreed on several 
matters, and those of importance, but they have not redu- 
ced them to the form of a report, which, in fact, leaves 
every thing afloat, to be governed by the impressions of the 
moment, when the legislature meet. 

" The points agreed upon are these : that there shall 
be an actual valuation of land, and a tax of so much on the 
pound. The great diversity in the quality of land, would 
not suffer them to listen to an estimated valuation, or to a 
tax by the quantity, agreeable to the idea in your late re- 



414 THE LIFE OF 

port to congress, that there shall be also a tariff of all per- 
sonal property, to be also taxed at so much on the pound. 

" That there shall be a specific tax on carriages, clocks, 
watches, and other similar articles of luxury : That money 
at usury shall be taxed at a fixed rate in the pound, exclu- 
ding that which is loaned to the public : That houses in 
all towns shall be taxed at a certain proportion of the an- 
nual rent : That there shall be a poll tax on all single men 
from fifteen upwards ; and that the collection of the taxes 
should be advertised to the lowest bidder, at a fixed rate 
per cent., barring all subordinate expenses. 

"Among other things which were rejected, I pressed 
hard for an excise on distilled liquors, but all that could be 
carried in this article was a license on taverns. 

" The committee were pretty generally of opinion, that 
the system of funding, for payment of old debts, and for 
procuring farther credit was wise and indispensable ; but a 
majority thought it would be unwise in one state to contri- 
bute in this way alone. 

" Nothing was decided on the question of taxes, which 
the state was able to pay ; those who went farthest did not 
exceed seventy thousand pounds, of which fifty were for 
the use of the United States." 

An interesting correspondence continued between Mor- 
ris and Hamilton, in which the various measures for prop- 
ping up the credit of the financier, and introducing his notes 
into extensive circulation, as a common currency, are dis- 
cussed. In one of these, Hamilton speaks of an address of 
the public creditors in Albany to those of the whole United 
States, as having originated with himself, and containing 
ideas which ought to prevail. 

The suspension of interest on the loan office certificates 
issued at an early stage of the revolution, had produced 
great distress and discontent among the holders, the greater 
number of whom resided in Philadelphia. After frequent 



HAMILTON. 415 

consultation, a numerous meeting was convened in that 
city, and strong resolutions adopted, urging upon congress 
the necessity of granting them immediate relief. On the 
appearance of this document, Hamilton conceived the idea 
that a powerful influence might be exercised upon the mea- 
sures of congress by the co-operation of the creditors in 
other states, and with this view a meeting was held at Al- 
bany, where General Schuyler presided, at which was pro- 
posed a convention of county delegates at Poughkeepsie, 
and a state delegation to a general convention at Philadel- 
phia, from which he hoped incipient steps might be taken 
for the adoption of his favourite measure, a re-organiza- 
tion of the general government. These resolutions were 
accompanied by the following address, urging the establish- 
ment of permanent funds. 

" TO THE PUBLIC CREDITORS OF THE STATE OF 
NEW-YORK." 

The appellation by which we have chosen to address you, 
indicates at once the broad and equitable basis upon which 
we wish to unite the influence and efforts of those who are 
creditors of the public, to obtain that justice, which the ne- 
cessities of many, and the rights of all demand. What- 
ever distinctions may characterize the different classes of 
creditors, either of the United States, or of this state, 
whatever may be their different degrees of merit as pa- 
triots, or their comparative claims upon the gratitude or 
generosity of their country, in one circumstance they all 
agree, they have an equal claim upon the justice and 
plighted faith of the public. 

Alarmed by the successive violations of public engage- 
ments, and by that recent and distressing one, the with- 
holding the interest hitherto paid by bills on France, upon 
the monies loaned previous to first March, 1778, the public 
creditors in this city have thought it necessary to follow 



416 THE LIFE OF 

the example of those of the city of Philadelphia, and to 
convene and consult upon the measures proper to be taken 
for their own security. They will not dwell upon the 
measure alluded to, farther than to observe, that its weight 
is most oppressively felt by those whose zeal in the cause 
and confidence in their country have been most conspi- 
cuous ; who in times of danger, have demonstrated their 
concern for the common safety, by voluntary deposits, in 
some instances of the whole, in others of a large part of 
their fortunes in the public funds ; and who now, many of 
them at least, feel themselves reduced from affluence to 
indigence, from circumstances of ease and plenty, to 
penury and unaffected distress. 

They cannot but add, that there are others, not less me- 
ritorious, who have perhaps experienced even a worse fate ; 
those who, having made subsequent loans, have long since 
seen the payment of interest cease, and those who, when 
the distresses of the army have had no resource but in the 
patriotism of individuals, have cheerfully parted with the 
fruits of their industry, scarcely reserving a sufficiency for 
the subsistence of their own families, without any compen- 
sation since, besides the consciousness of having been the 
benefactors of their country. 

We entertain not so injurious an idea as to imagine, that 
levity or contempt of the obligations of national faith, or 
of the dictates of policy, have influenced those infringe- 
ments of the public engagements, which have too often 
happened. We have been sensible of the necessity which 
has, in some cases, produced them ; but we apprehend it 
to have resulted, not from the want of ability or means, 
but from the want of a proper system for the beneficial 
application of them. And we conceive it our duty to ac- 
quiesce in that necessity, only so far as there appears to 
be an unavoidable sacrifice to the urgent calls of particular 
conjunctions, followed by effectual endeavours to prevent 



HAMILTON. 417 

a continuance or return of the same necessity, or to make 
satisfaction in some other way. 

Few states have been without their vicissitudes, in which 
the strict obligations of good faith have been obliged to 
bend to momentary necessities ; but the example of all 
wise and happy ones, combine with reason and justice to 
establish this truth, that no time ought to be lost in pro- 
viding the means of repairing those breaches, and making 
compensation for the sufferers. 

Unfortunately for us, and for every citizen of the United 
States, (for the calamity directly or in its consequences is 
general,) the same policy has been too long delayed in this 
country ; the only expedient in our power for effecting the 
object, being still unattempted. We need no arguments to 
convince us, that it is not possible for these states, by any 
exertions they can make, to pay off at once the principal 
of the public debts, and furnish the supplies for the cur- 
rent demands of the war, and for the support of civil go- 
vernment. We even think it as manifest as experience 
and calculation can make it, that our abilities fall greatly 
short even of the two latter objects. This, in an infant 
country, will not surprise those who know that nations 
the most opulent, and in all the vigour of maturity, are 
compelled to have recourse to large loans in time of war, 
to satisfy the public exigencies. 

The quota of the present year has been fixed at eight 
millions of dollars, which we are to consider as the sum 
requisite for the annual expenditure .; and those accustomed 
to computations of such a nature, will be convinced that 
to make this sum suffice, requires economy and good ma- 
nagement. Have we a prospect of raising one third of 
this sum within the states? Those who have attended to 
the publications of the receipts on the continental account, 
will easily answer the question for themselves. If this 

VOL. I. 53 



418 TUB LIFE OF 

must be in the negative, the inquiry then becomes, what 
means have we to supply the deficiency? 

Admit that there are defects in the system of taxation 
in almost every state, and that more judgement and equali- 
ty in the manner of laying them, more energy and econo- 
my in the collection, would be more productive to the re- 
venue, and less burthensome to the people, still we cannot 
imagine that the reformation of these defects would aug- 
ment the product of the taxes in any proportion to the de- 
ficiency. 

It is plain, therefore, that the principal part of the ba- 
lance must be procured upon credit ; nor is it less plain, 
that this must chiefly be from individuals at home and 
abroad. We are assured, that the situation of our allies 
will not permit them to make us governmental loans, in 
any proportion to our wants, and without this assurance, 
we might have inferred it, from a consideration of the im- 
mense land and naval establishments which they are 
obliged to support in the prosecution of the war, on their 
own part. 

It may be asked, if such are the necessities of the pub- 
lic, how are they to spare any part of their funds for the 
payment of old debts? The answer is easy, those ne- 
cessities can only be supplied by a sound and healthy state 
of public credit, and there is only one way to effect the 
restoration of this credit, the putting the old debts in a 
course of redemption, or at least securing the punctual pay- 
ment of the interest, by substantial funds, permanently 
pledged for that purpose. 

It cannot be expected, that individuals in this country 
will hereafter lend to the public, unless they perceive a dis- 
position to do justice to its creditors. If, without providing 
for those who have already risked their fortunes, securities 
should be held out to invite future creditors, a suspicion of 
their faithful application would deter every prudent man. 



HAMILTON. 419 

There must be a good opinion of public faith, before there 
can be a confidence in public securities ; and this opinion 
can only be created by unequivocal demonstrations of a 
disposition to do justice; nor will any thing amount to a 
proof of this, short of the measure on which we insist. In 
common life, no credit would be given to any man who de- 
parted from these principles, and the same rule is not less 
applicable to nations. 

If individuals among ourselves would not have the ne- 
cessary confidence, it were chimerical to expect it from 
foreigners. Such of them as, having been already adven- 
turers in our funds, are holders of public certificates, would 
have little encouragement to adventure farther. 

No presumptions of the speedy termination of the war, 
will invalidate the force of these reflections. Not only the 
grounds of them are vague and uncertain, and it would be 
the extremity of folly to abandon an indispensable resource 
for continuing the war, because there was a possibility of 
its being ended. But the fullest assurance of the event, 
would not take away this irresistible argument, that public 
justice, and its inseparable companion, public credit, are 
alike essential to the prosperity of a nation in peace and 
war. 

We scruple not to assert, that these states might, with 
ease to themselves, provide the means requisite to fund the 
debts already incurred, and to procure farther loans. A 
moderate sum would be sufficient. It is an expedient 
which we conceive besides calculated to lighten the bur- 
thens of the people, and to increase then* ability to bear 
them. The more we can procure on credit, the less we 
. need exhaust ourselves in immediate taxation ; and the pub- 
lic creditors themselves will be enabled to bear a large 
share of the future burthen, which will, of course, diminish 
the contributions of others. We might expatiate on the 
influence of public credit over private industry, and on its 



420 THE LIFE OF 

tendency in that way to multiply the riches of the commu- 
nity, and we might add, that the wheels of circulation and 
commerce, now clogged by the want of an adequate me- 
dium, would derive new motion and vivacity from the in- 
crease of that medium, by rendering the public securities a 
valuable negotiable property. We have indulged in these 
reflections to show that patriotism, not less than necessity, 
interest, and safety, prompt us to an emphatical appeal to the 
justice and honour of our country. 

What will be the condition of individuals, if a disregard 
to the sanctity of public obligations should become the spi- 
rit of the public councils ? We indeed should be the imme- 
diate victims, but who can answer when his turn might 
come ? It is true, those who are not already embarked, 
may avoid hereafter becoming volunteers in their own ruin, 
but can they guard against the pressing calls of necessity, 
enforced by legislative coertions ? Should we see a renew- 
al of the distresses of the army, for want of subsistence, 
must not the inhabitants of this state again feel the weight 
of compulsory laws, and unless justice be done to the pre- 
sent creditors, what hope can they have of recompense ? 
What, in short, will be the security of private property, if 
the powers of government may be employed to take it from 
us, and no provision hereafter made to render satisfaction ? 

A purity of faith has ever been the more peculiar attri- 
bute of republics, the very being of which depends on vir- 
tue in all, and a Sacred regard to justice in those to whom 
the administration of affairs is entrusted. A contrary dis- 
position in these states, would be as novel as pernicious ; 
and we flatter ourselves, we never shall suffer such a stig- 
ma to be fixed upon our national character, especially on 
our first emerging into political existence. 

The propriety of introducing at large such a document, 
may, perhaps, be questioned ; but, when it is remembered, 



HAMILTON. 42 1 

that the fate of the American union depended on the ful- 
filment of its engagements ; with what difficulty its discor- 
dant members were induced to co-operate ; and when we 
view Hamilton as the great instrument in producing this 
result ; the knowledge of every circumstance which can 
throw light on the state of public opinion ; of every obsta- 
cle which was encountered ; and of every effort which was 
made ; becomes essential in enabling us to judge of the na- 
ture and extent of his services. 

There is another view, which has a deep and touching 
interest. Amidst the glare of war, the civil sufferers of the 
revolution have been little regarded ; and the individu- 
als who nerved the arm of the country with their wealth ; 
who parted with the fruits of their industry ; who were re- 
duced from affluence to indigence ; who had none of the 
quickening incentives of ambition to sustain them ; whose 
intelligence disclosed to them all the hazards they incurred ; 
and who leaned solely on an elevated and self-denying 
patriotism, were often remembered only to be stigmatized. 
They are brought before us here in person with all their 
unrequited wrongs ; standing before the altar of public 
faith ; claiming the fulfilment of its pledges for the sacri- 
fices they had made ; in the midst of them is seen Hamil- 
ton, pleading in their behalf for that justice which, though 
long delayed, it was reserved to his hand to administer. 

Most of the letters which passed, at this time, between 
the subject of this memoir and the Superintendent of Fi- 
nance are lost, and it is the more to be regretted, as, from 
the manner in which they are referred to, they appear to 
have contained full views of the many difficult questions 
which arose, connected with the restoration of public credit. 

From those which remain, we may infer, how early ri- 
pened were Hamilton's financial opinions, and may form a 
partial judgement of the extraordinary difficulties, labours, 
and capacity of Robert Morris, whose luminous views of 



422 THE LIFE OF HAMILTON. 

the interests of the country, are only less remarkable than 
the energy, firmness, and resource, with which he seemed 
to have borne on his shoulders its tottering fortunes. 

As the session of congress approached, Colonel Hamil- 
ton urged the necessity of a successor being appointed ; 
and on the last day of October relinquished his office of 
continental receiver, to commence the new and more im- 
portant career which was opening before him.
