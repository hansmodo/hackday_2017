DEAR EDWARD, 
</p><p>
This serves to acknowledge the receipt of yours per Capt. Lowndes, which was delivered me yesterday. The 
truth of Capt. Lightbowen and Lowndes' information is now verified by the presence of your father and sister, for whose 
safe arrival I pray, and that they may convey that satisfaction to your soul, that must naturally flow from the sight of 
absent friends in health ; and shall for news this way, refer you to them. 
</p><p>
As to what you say, respecting your soon having the happiness of seeing us all, I wish for an accomplishment of 
your hopes, provided they are concomitant with your welfare, otherwise not ; though doubt whether I shall be present or not, for to confess my weakness, Ned, my ambition is prevalent, so that I contemn the grovelling condition of 
a clerk, or the like, to which my fortune condemns me, and would willingly risk my life, though not my character, to exalt my station. I am confident, Ned, that my youth excludes me from any hopes of immediate preferment, nor do I desire it ; but I mean to prepare the way 
for futurity. I'm no philosopher, you see, and may be justly said to build castles in the air ; my folly makes me ashamed, 
and beg you'll conceal it ; yet, Neddy, we have seen such schemes successful, when the projector is constant. I shall conclude by saying, I wish there was a war. 
</p><p>
I am, 
</p><p>
Dear Edward,
</p><p>
Yours, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">ALEX. HAMILTON</a>. 
</p><p>
P. S. I this moment received yours by William Smith, 
and pleased to see you give such close application to study.

</p><p>
GENTLEMEN : 
</p><p>
Since my last I have had the pleasure of receiving your 
reply to my two favours of 29th ultimo and 2d current. I 
am happy enough to be able to inform you, that my indisposition, which was the occasion of my brevity when I last 
wrote, is now removed. 
</p><p>
The opinion I advanced respecting the enemy's not moving before the beginning of May, seems to be shaken, though 
not entirely overthrown, by some present appearances. We 
have received information, that they are embarking about 
three thousand men on board of transports, which are lying 
at the Hook, by way of Staten Island. This, it is conjectured, is with a view to the Delaware ; and the supposition 
is confirmed, by the circumstance of a confederacy lately 
detected at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, who, among other things, were 
endeavouring, by the temptation of fifty pounds, to engage 
persons as pilots up that river. The extreme difficulties 
they must labour under for want of forage, and the infinite 
hazard they must run by moving with a small body of about 
five thousand men, with an enemy in the rear, incapable of 
sparing any considerable body of troops to form a post behind, and be an asylum to them in case of accident, these 
circumstances will hardly allow me to think they will be 
daring enough to make the attempt at this time. But on 
the other hand, as they know we are in a progressive state 
as to numbers, and other matters of importance, and as they 
have no prospect of early reinforcement, and are in a state 
of uncertainty as to any, from the bustling aspect of European affairs, it is probable they may conceive a necessity of 
making a push at all risks. Perhaps, however, this embarkation is intended for some other purpose ; to make a diversion, or execute some partizan exploit elsewhere. On 
the whole, I find it difficult to believe they are yet ready 
for any capital operation. 
</p><p>
As to your apprehensions of an attempt up the North 
river, I imagine you may discard any uneasiness on that 
score, although it will be at all times advisable to be on the 
watch against such a contingency, it is almost reduced to a certainty, that the principal views of the enemy in the ensuing 
campaign will be directed towards the southward, and to 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> more immediately ; of which idea, the discovery before mentioned, with respect to pilots, is no inconsiderable confirmation. <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is an object calculated to strike and attract their attention. It has all along 
been the main source of supplies towards the war, and the 
getting it into their possession would deprive us of a wheel 
we could very badly spare, in the great political and military machine. They are sensible of this, and are equally 
sensible, that it contains in itself, and is surrounded by a 
prodigious number of persons attached to them, and inimical to us, who would lend them all the assistance they could 
in the further prosecution of their designs. It is also a 
common and well-grounded rule in war, to strike first and 
principally at the capital towns and cities, in order to the 
conquest of a country. 
</p><p>
I must confess I do not see any object equally interesting 
to draw then- efforts to the northward. Operations merely 
for plundering and devastation can never answer their end ; 
and if they could, one part of the continent would do nearly 
as well as another. And as to the notion of forming a 
junction with the northern army, and cutting off the communication between the northern and southern states, I 
apprehend it will do better in speculation than in practice. 
Unless the geography of the country is far different from 
any thing I can conceive, to effect this would require a 
chain of posts, and such a number of men at each, as would 
never be practicable or maintainable, but to an immense 
army. In their progress, by hanging upon their rear, and 
seizing every opportunity of skirmishing, their situation 
might be rendered insupportably uneasy. 
</p><p>
But for fear of mistake, the general has determined to 
collect a considerable body of troops at or about <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a>, 
which will not be drawn off till the intentions of the enemy 
have acquired a decisive complexion. These will be ready, according to conjunctures, either to proceed northerly or 
southerly, as may be requisite. Every precaution should 
be taken to prevent the boats from being destroyed, by collecting them at the first movement of the enemy under 
cover of one of the forts, or into some inlet, difficult of access and easily defensible with a small number of men. 
The loss of them would be an irreparable disadvantage. 
</p><p>
The enemy's attempt upon <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> is a demonstration 
of the folly of having any quantity of stores at places so 
near the water, and so much exposed to a sudden inroad. 
There should never be more there than sufficient to answer 
present demands. We have lost a good deal in this way at 
different" times, and I hope experience will at last make 
us wiser. 
</p><p>
His excellency lately had a visit from the Oneida chief 
and five others. He managed them with a good deal of 
address, and sent them away perfectly satisfied. He persuaded them to go to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, but they declined it, 
alleging their impatience to return, and remove the erroneous opinions of their countrymen, from the misrepresentations of British emissaries, which they were apprehensive 
might draw them into some rash proceedings. They parted, after having made the most solemn protestations of 
friendship and good will. His excellency has been very 
busy all day in despatching the southern post, which has 
prevented me giving him your resolve. It will, no doubt, 
be very acceptable ; and it is with pleasure I inform you, 
that the zeal and abilities of the New- York convention hold 
the first rank in his estimation. 
</p><p>
No news from France, save that the congress have obtained a credit there, for which they can draw bills to the 
amount of 100,000 sterling. This will be extremely serviceable in carrying on a trade with the French. The new 
troops begin to come in. If we can shortly get any considerable accession of strength, we may be able to strike 
some brilliant stroke. 
</p><p>
I am, Gentlemen, with the greatest respect, 
Your most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">A. HAMILTON.</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. We have been some time endeavouring to negotiate a regular cartel ; but it has been lately broken off 
principally on account of Major General Lee. General 
Howe will not allow him to be comprehended under the 
general idea of American prisoners.

</p><p>
Your favour of the eighteenth, from <a href='/results.php?city=saratoga' rel='city'>Saratoga</a>, reached me yesterday Your pronouncing <a href='/results.php?city=fort edward' rel='city'>Fort Edward</a> among 
the other forts, indefensible, surprises me a little, as it is 
entirely contrary to the representations of several gentlemen of judgment, who have had an opportunity of seeing 
and considering its situation, by whom we have been taught 
to believe that it would be an excellent post, at least for 
checking and retarding Burgoyne's progress. I agree with 
you that our principal strength in the quarter you are, will 
be in the forests and natural strength of the country, and in 
the want of forage, provisions, carriages, &c. in which the 
enemy may easily be thrown, by taking away what there 
are of those articles which you observe have never been in 
great abundance. 
</p><p>
I am doubtful whether Burgoyne will attempt to penetrate far, and whether he will not content himself with harassing our back settlements by parties, assisted by the savages, who, it is to be feared, will pretty generally be 
tempted by the enemy's late successes, to confederate in 
hostilities against us. 
</p><p>
This doubt arises from some appearances that indicate a 
southern movement of General Howe's army, which if it 
should really happen, will certainly be a barrier agains: 
any further impressions of Burgoyne ; for it cannot be supposed he would be rash enough to plunge into the bosom of 
the country without an expectation of being met by General Howe. Things must prove very adverse to us indeed, should he make such an attempt and not be ruined 
by it. I confess, however, that the appearances I allude 
to do not carry a full evidence in my mind ; because they 
are opposed by others of a contradictory kind, and because 
I cannot conceive upon what principle of common sense or 
military propriety Howe can be running away from Burgoyne to the southward. 
</p><p>
It is much to be wished he may, even though it should 
give him the possession of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, which, by our remoteness from it may very well happen. In this case we 
may not only, if we think proper, retaliate, by aiming a 
stroke at New- York ; but we may come upon him with the 
greatest part of our collective force, to act against that 
part which is under him. We shall then be certain that 
Burgoyne cannot proceed, and that a small force of continental troops will be sufficient for that partizan war which 
he must carry on the rest of the campaign. 
</p><p>
A small force will also be sufficient to garrison the posts 
in the Highlands, and prevent any danger there ; so that 
we shall be able to bring nearly the whole of the continental army against Mr. Howe. The advantages of this are 
obvious. Should he be satisfied with the splendour of his 
acquisition, and shut himself up in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, we can 
ruin him by confinement. Should he leave a garrison 
there, and go forward, we can either fall upon that or his 
main body, diminished as it will be by such a measure, 
with our whole force There will, however, be many disagreeable consequences attending such an event ; amongst 
which, the foremost is, the depreciation of our currency, 
which, from the importance in which <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> is held, 
cannot fail to ensue.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I did myself the honour to write you a hasty line this evening, giving it as my opinion that the city was no longer a place 
of safety for you. I write you again lest that letter should 
not get to hand. The enemy are on the road to Swedes 
Ford, the main body about four miles from it. They sent a 
party this evening to Daviser's ferry, which fired upon me and 
some others in crossing it, killed one man, wounded another, 
and disabled my horse. 
</p><p>
They came on so suddenly, that one boat was left adrift 
on the other side, which will of course fall into their hands, 
and by the help of that, they will get possession of another, 
which was abandoned by those who had the direction of it, 
and left afloat, in spite of every thing that I could do to the 
contrary. These two boats will convey fifty men across at 
a time, so that in a few hours they may throw over a large 
party, perhaps sufficient to overmatch the militia who may be 
between them and the city. This renders the situation of 
congress extremely precarious, if they are not on their guard : 
my apprehensions for them are great, though it is not improbable they may not be realized. 
</p><p>
The most cogent reasons oblige me to join the army this 
night, or I should have waited upon you myself. I am in 
hopes our army will be up with the enemy before they pass 
Schuylkill ; if they are, something serious will ensue. 
I have the honour to be, 
With much respect, 
</p><p>

</p><p>
I have been duly honoured by your several favours of the 
25th, 27th, and 30th of July. The misfortune at <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, has produced a very disagreeable alteration in our affairs, and has thrown a gloom upon the favourable prospect 
which the campaign previous to that event afforded. But I 
am in great hopes, the ill consequences of it will not continue 
to operate long, and that the jealousies and alarms which so 
sudden and unexpected an accident has occasioned in the 
minds of the people both of your state and to the eastward, 
will shortly subside, and give way to the more rational dictates of self-preservation and regard to the common good. 
In fact, the worst effect of that disaster is, that it has served 
to create those distrusts and apprehensions ; for if the matter were coolly and dispassionately considered, there would 
be found nothing so formidable in <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>Mr. Burgoyne</a>, and the 
force under him, with all his successes, as to countenance 
the least languor or despondency, and experience would 
show that a tolerable degree of vigour in the states more 
immediately interested, would be sufficient to check his 
career, and perhaps convert the advantages he has gained 
into his ruin. But while people continue to view what has 
happened through the medium of supineness or fear, there is 
no saying to what length an enterprising genius may push 
his good fortune. I have the fullest confidence that no endeavours of the council will be omitted to bring your state 
(with the distresses of which I am sensibly affected,) to every 
effort it is capable of making in its present mutilated condition, and they may rely upon it no means in my power will 
be unemployed to co-operate with them in repelling the danger that threatens the state, and through it the continent. 
If I do not give as essential aid as might be wished to the 
northern army, it is not from want of inclination, nor from 
being too little impressed with the importance of doing it. 
It would be the height of impolicy to weaken ourselves too 
much here, in order to increase our strength there, and it must 
certainly be more difficult, as well as of greater moment, to 
control the main army of the enemy, than an inferior, and, I 
may say, dependent one ; for it is pretty obvious, if General 
Howe can be completely kept at bay, and prevented effecting any capital purposes, the successes of <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a>, 
whatever they may be, must be partial and temporary. 
Nothing that I can do shall be wanting to rouse the eastern states, and excite them to those exertions which the exigency of our affairs so urgently demands. I lament that they 
have not yet done more, that so few of their militia have 
come into the field, and that those few have been so precipitate in returning home at this critical period ; but I have, 
nevertheless, great reliance upon those states. I know they 
are capable of powerful efforts, and that their attachment to 
the cause, notwithstanding they may be a little tardy, will not 
allow them long to withhold their aid, at a time when their 
own safety, and that of a sister state, and, in a great measure, 
the safety of the continent, calls for their greatest zeal and 
activity. 
</p><p>
I flatter myself the presence of <a href='/results.php?tla=bea' rel='colleague'>General Arnold</a> and <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> in the Northern Department will have a happy 
effect upon them. Those gentlemen possess much of their 
confidence, particularly the latter, than whom there is, perhaps, no man from the state of Massachusetts, who enjoys 
more universal esteem and popularity. And in addition to 
that, they are both to be considered as very valuable officers. 
You intimate a wish that some assistance could be drawn 
from the southern states at this time. But while things remain in their present posture, and appearances, however 
illusory they may prove in the issue, afford the strongest reason to keep their force at home, to counteract the seeming 
intentions of General Howe, I could neither ask nor expect 
them to detach succours to the northern states, who are so 
well able to defend themselves against the force they now 
have to oppose. 
</p><p>
I hope an exaggerated idea of the enemy's numbers may 
have no injurious influence on our measures. There is no 
circumstance I am acquainted with that induces me to believe <a href='/results.php?tla=jhb' rel='adversary'>General Burgoyne</a> can have more than five or six 
thousand men; and if the force left in Canada is so considerable as the information you send me makes it, he cannot have even so many. The representations of prisoners 
and deserters in this respect are of little validity ; their 
knowledge is always very limited, and their intentions, particularly the former, very often bad. 
</p><p>
Beyond what regards their own companies, little or no 
attention is due to what they say ; the number of regiments your informant mentions corresponds with other 
accounts ; but the number of men in each company he 
gives the establishment, is not, I am persuaded, their actual 
state. The enemy's army in Canada last campaign, though 
they suffered little by action, must have decreased materially by sickness and other casualties ; and if the recruits 
to them, both from England and Germany bore any proportion to those which have reinforced General Howe, the 
state of their regiments must be greatly inferior to what 
your information holds forth.
</p><p>
The appointment of <a href='/results.php?tla=gec' rel='colleague'>General Clinton</a> to the government 
of your state, is an event that, in itself, gives me great pleasure, and very much abates the regret I should otherwise 
feel for the loss of his services in the military line. That 
gentleman's character is such, as will make him peculiarly 
useful at the head of your affairs, in a situation so alarming 
and interesting as that which you now experience.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I arrived here yesterday at noon, and waited upon <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> immediately On the business of my mission, but 
was sorry to find his ideas did not correspond with yours, 
for drawing off the number of troops you directed. I used 
every argument in my power to convince him of the propriety of the measure, but he was inflexible in the opinion 
that two brigades at least of continental troops should remain in and near this place. His reasons were, that the 
intelligence of Sir Henry Clinton's having gone to join 
Howe was not sufficiently authenticated to put it out of 
doubt ; that there was, therefore, a possibility of his returning up the river, which might expose the finest arsenal in 
America (as he calls the one here,) to destruction, should 
this place be left so bare of troops as I proposed, and that 
the want of conveniences and the difficulty of the roads 
would make it impossible to remove artillery and stores 
for a considerable time ; that the New-England states would 
be left open to the depredations and ravages of the enemy ; 
that it would put it out of his power to enterprise any thing 
against <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, which he thinks might be done in the 
winter, and which he considers it of importance to undertake. 
</p><p>
The force of these reasons did by no means strike me ; 
and I did every thing in my power to show they were unsubstantial ; but all I could effect was to have one brigade 
despatched in addition to those already marched. I found 
myself infinitely embarrassed, and was at a loss how to act. 
I felt the importance of strengthening you as much as possible ; but, on the other hand, I found insuperable inconveniences in acting diametrically opposite to the opinion of a 
gentleman whose successes have raised him to the highest importance. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> has won the entire confidence of the eastern states. If disposed to do it, by addressing himself to 
the prejudices of the people, he would find no difficulty to 
render a measure odious, which it might be said with plausibility enough to be believed, was calculated to expose 
them to unnecessary dangers, notwithstanding their exertions during the campaign had given them the fullest title 
to repose and security. <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> has influence and 
interest elsewhere ; he might use it, if he pleased, to discredit the measure there also. On the whole, it appeared 
to me dangerous to insist on sending more troops from hence, 
while <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a> appeared so warmly opposed to it. 
Should any accident or inconvenience happen in consequence of it, there would be too fair a pretext for censure, 
and many people are too well disposed to lay hold of it. 
At any rate, it might be considered as using him ill, to take 
a step so contrary to his judgment in a case of this nature. 
These considerations, and others which I shall be more explicit in when I have the pleasure of seeing you, determined me not to insist upon sending either of the other brigades remaining here. I am afraid what I have done may 
not meet with your approbation, as not being perhaps fully 
warranted by your instructions ; but I ventured to do what 
I thought right, hoping that at least the goodness of my intention will excuse the error of my judgment. 
</p><p>
I was induced to this relaxation the more readily, as I 
had directed to be sent on two thousand militia which were 
not expected by you, and a thousand continental troops out 
of those proposed to be left with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, which I 
have written to him since I found how matters were circumstanced here, to forward to you with all despatch. I 
did this for several reasons : because your reinforcement 
would be more expeditious from that place than from this ; 
because two thousand continental troops at <a href='/results.php?city=peekskill' rel='city'>Peekskill</a> will 
not be wanted in its present circumstances, especially as 
it was really necessary to have a body of continental troops 
at this place for the security of the valuable stores here, 
and I should not, if I had my wish, think it expedient to 
draw off more than two of the three brigades now here. 
</p><p>
This being the case, one of the ends you proposed to be 
answered, by leaving the ten regiments with <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, will be equally answered by the troops here ; I mean 
that of covering and fortifying the eastern states, and one 
thousand continental troops in addition to the militia collected and that may be collected here, will be sufficient in the 
Highlands for covering the country down that way, and 
carrying on the works necessary to be raised for the defence of the river. 
</p><p>
The troops gone and going to reinforce you are near five 
thousand rank and file continental troops, and two thousand 
five hundred Massachusetts and New-Hampshire militia. 
These, and the seven hundred Jersey militia, will be a larger reinforcement than you expected, though not quite an 
equal number of continental troops, nor exactly in the way 
directed. <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a> tells me the militia are very excellent, and though their times will be out by the last of this 
month, you will be able, if you think proper, to order the 
troops still remaining here,to join you by the time their term 
of service expires. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear being uneasy lest my conduct should 
prove displeasing to you, but I have done what, considering all circumstances, appeared to me most eligible and prudent. Vessels are preparing to carry the brigade to NewWindsor, which will embark this evening. I shall, this 
afternoon, set out on my return to camp, and on my way 
shall endeavour to hasten the troops forward. 
Disappointed in the orders issued by <a href='/results.php?tla=hog' rel='colleague met'>General Gates</a>, Hamilton, in pursuance of the requisition of the commanderin-chief, addressed him on the 5th November, prior to his 
departure from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, in the following decisive tone.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
By inquiry, I have learned that General Patterson's brigade, which is the one you propose to send, is by far the 
weakest of the three now here, and does not consist of more 
than about six hundred rank and file fit for duty. It is 
true, that there is a militia regiment with it of about two 
hundred, but the time of service for which this regiment is 
engaged is so near expiring, that it would be past by the 
time the men could arrive at their destination. 
</p><p>
Under these circumstances, I cannot consider it either as 
compatible with the good of the service, or my instructions 
from his excellency <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, to consent that 
that brigade be selected from the three to go to him, but I 
am under the necessity of desiring, by virtue of my orders 
from him, that one of the others be substituted instead of 
this, either General Nixon's or General Glover's, and that 
you will be pleased to give immediate orders for its embarkation. 
</p><p>
Knowing that <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> wished me to pay the 
greatest deference to your judgment, I ventured so far to 
deviate from the instructions he gave me, as to consent, in 
compliance with your opinion, that two brigades should 
remain here instead of one. At the same time, permit me 
to observe, that I am not myself sensible of the expediency 
of keeping more than one, with the detached regiments in 
the neighbourhood of this place, and that my ideas coincide 
with those gentlemen whom I have consulted on the occasion, whose judgment I have much more reliance upon than 
on my own, and who must be supposed to have a thorough 
knowledge of all the circumstances. Their opinion is, that 
one brigade and the regiments before mentioned would 
amply answer the purposes of this post. When I preferred your opinion to other considerations, I did not imagine 
you would pitch upon a brigade little more than half as 
large as the others, and finding this to be the case, I indispensably owe it to my duty to desire, in his excellency's 
name, that another may go instead of the one intended, and 
without loss of time. As it may be conducive to despatch 
to send Glover's brigade, if agreeable to you, you will give 
orders accordingly.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Ever since my arrival in this quarter, I have been endeavouring to collect the best idea I could of the state of things in 
New- York, in order the better to form a judgment of the probable reinforcement gone to General Howe. On the whole, 
this is a fact well ascertained, that New- York has been stripped as bare as possible ; that in consequence of this, the few 
troops there and the inhabitants are under so strong apprehensions of an attack, as almost to amount to a panic ; that 
to supply the deficiency of men, every effort is making to excite the citizens to arms for the defence of the city. For this 
purpose, the public papers are full of addresses to them, that 
plainly speak the apprehensions prevailing on the occasion. 
</p><p>
Hence I infer that a formidable force is gone to General 
Howe. The calculations made by those who have had the 
best opportunities of judging, carry the number from six to 
seven thousand. If so, the number gone and going to <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a> is far inferior. five thousand at the utmost. 
The militia were all detained by <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a>, till it became too late to send them. 
</p><p>
The state of things I gave you when I had the pleasure of 
seeing you, was, to the best of my judgment, sacredly true. 
I give you the present information, that you may decide whether any farther succour can with propriety come from you. 
</p><p>
The fleet, with the troops on board, sailed out of the Hook 
the 5th instant. This circumstance demonstrates, beyond 
a possibility of doubt, that it is General Howe's fixed intention 
to endeavour to hold <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> at all hazards, and removes 
all danger of any farther operations up the North river this 
winter; otherwise Sir Henry Clinton's movement at this 
advanced season is altogether inexplicable. 
</p><p>
If you can with propriety afford any farther assistance, the 
most expeditious mode of conveying it, will be to acquaint <a href='/results.php?tla=isp' rel='colleague met'>General Putnam</a> of it, that he may send on the troops with him, 
to be replaced by them. You, sir, best know the uses to 
which the troops with you are to be applied, and will determine accordingly. I am certain it is not his excellency's wish 
to frustrate any plan you may have in view for the benefit of 
the service, so far as it can possibly be avoided, consistent 
with a due attention to more important objects. 
</p><p>
I am, with respect, sir, your most obedient,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=jol' rel='colleague'>Colonel Laurens</a>, who will have the honour of delivering 
you this letter, is on his way to South Carolina, on a project which I think in the present situation of affairs there, is 
a very good one, and deserves every kind of support and 
encouragement. This is, to raise two, three, or four battalions of negroes, with the assistance of the government of 
that state, by contributions from the owners, in proportion 
to the number they possess. If you should think proper to 
enter upon the subject with him, he will give you a detail of 
his plan. He wishes to have it recommended by congress 
to the state, and as an inducement, that they would engage 
to take their battalions into continental pay. 
</p><p>
It appears to me, that an expedient of this kind in the characterised him, addressed the French government and their ambassador 
here on the subject, urging the advantages which would result to both nations 
from having a French military force in this country. This proposition was 
immediately patronized and enforced by the family and connexions of the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>Marquis</a>, which were then in power and great influence in France, and adopted by 
that government. I deem it a duty incumbent on me, and a tribute due to his 
memory, that the knowledge of this fact should be recorded as an additional 
evidence of bis pre-eminent services to his country." 
present state of southern affairs, is the most rational that 
can be adopted, and promises very important advantages. 
Indeed, I hardly see how a sufficient force can be collected 
in that quarter without it ; and the enemy's operations 
there are growing infinitely serious and formidable. I have 
not the least doubt that the negroes will make very excellent soldiers, with proper management ; and I w r ill venture 
to pronounce that they cannot be put in better hands than 
those of Mr. Laurens. He has all the zeal, intelligence, and 
enterprise, and every other qualification requisite to succeed in such an undertaking. It is a maxim with some 
great military judges, that with sensible officers, soldiers 
can hardly be too stupid ; and on this principle it is thought 
that the Russians would make the best soldiers in the world 
if they were under other officers than their own. The 
King of Prussia is among the number who maintains this 
doctrine, and has a very emphatic saying on the occasion, 
which I do not exactly recollect. I mention this because I 
have frequently heard it objected to the scheme of embodying 
negroes, that they are too stupid to make soldiers. This is 
so far from appearing to me a valid objection, that I think 
their want of cultivation, (for then- natural faculties are probably as good as ours,) joined to that habit of subordination 
which they acquire from a life of servitude, will enable 
them sooner to become soldiers than our white inhabitants. 
Let officers be men of sense and sentiment, and the nearer 
the soldiers approach to machines, perhaps the better. 
</p><p>
I foresee that this project will have to combat much opposition from prejudice and self-interest. The contempt we 
have been taught to entertain for the blacks, makes us fancy many things that are founded neither in reason nor experience ; and an unwillingness to part with property of so 
valuable a kind, will furnish a thousand arguments to show 
the impracticability or pernicious tendency of a scheme 
which requires such sacrifices. But it should be considered, that if we do not make use of them in this way, the enemy probably will, and that the best way to counteract the 
temptations they will holdout, will be, to offer them ourselves. 
An essential part of the plan is, to give them their freedom with their swords. This will secure their fidelity, animate 
their courage, and, I believe, will have a good influence upon 
those who remain, by opening a door to their emancipation. 
This circumstance, I confess, has no small weight in inducing me to wish the success of the project ; for the dictates 
of humanity and true policy equally interest me in favour 
of this unfortunate class of men. 
</p><p>
When I am on the subject of southern affairs, you will 
excuse the liberty I take in saying, that I do not think measures sufficiently vigorous are pursuing for our defence in 
that quarter. Except the few regular troops of South 
Carolina, we seem to be relying wholly on the militia 
of that and the two neighbouring states. These will 
soon grow impatient of service, and leave our affairs in a 
miserable situation. No considerable force can be uniformly kept up by militia ; to say nothing of the many obvious and well-known inconveniences that attend this kind 
of troops. I would beg leave to suggest, sir, that no time 
ought to be lost in making a draft of militia to serve a 
twelve-month, from the states of North and South Carolina and Virginia. But South Carolina, being very weak 
in her population of whites, may be excused from the draft, 
on condition of furnishing the black battalions. The two 
others may furnish about three thousand five hundred men, 
and be exempted, on that account, from sending any succours to this army. The states to the northward of Virginia 
will be fully able to give competent supplies to the army 
here, and it will require all the force and exertions of the 
three states I have mentioned, to withstand the storm 
which has arisen, and is increasing in the south. 
</p><p>
The troops drafted must be thrown into battalions, and 
officered in the best manner we can. The supernumerary officers may be made use of as far as they will go. If 
arms are wanted for their troops, and no better way of 
supplying them is to be found, we should endeavour to levy 
a contribution of arms upon the militia at large. Extraordinary exigencies demand extraordinary means. I fear 
this southern business will become a very grave one. 
With the truest respect and esteem, I am, sir, 
Your most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Agreeable to your request, and my promise, I sit down to 
give you my ideas of the defects of our present system, and 
the changes necessary to save us from ruin. They may, 
perhaps, be the reveries of a projector, rather than the sober 
view's of a politician. You w r ill judge of them, and make 
what use you please of them. 
</p><p>
The fundamental defect is a want of power in congress. 
It is hardly worth while to show in what this consists, as it 
seems to be universally acknowledged ; or to point out how 
it has happened, as the only question is how to remedy it. 
It may, however, be said, that it has originated from three 
causes, an excess of the spirit of liberty, which has made 
the particular states show a jealousy of all power not in 
their own hands ; and this jealousy has led them to exercise 
a right of judging, in the last resort, of the measures recommended by congress, and of acting according to their own 
opinions of their propriety or necessity; a diffidence in 
congress of their own powers, by which they have been 
timid and indecisive in their resolutions ; constantly making 
concessions to the states, till they have scarcely left themselves the shadow of power ; a want of sufficient means 
at their disposal to answer the public exigencies, and of 
vigour to draw forth those means, which have occasioned 
them to depend on the states, individually, to fulfil their engagements with the army ; the consequence of which has 
been to ruin their influence and credit with the army, to 
establish its dependence on each state, separately, rather 
than on them ; that is, than on the whole collectively. 
</p><p>
It may be pleaded that congress had never any definitive 
powers granted them, and of course could exercise none, 
could do nothing more than recommend. The manner in 
which congress was appointed would warrant, and the public good required, that they should have considered themselves as vested with full power to preserve the republic 
from harm. 
</p><p>
They have done many of the highest acts of sovereignty, 
which were always cheerfully submitted to ; the declaration of independence, the declaration of war, the levying 
an army, creating a navy, emitting money, making alliances 
with foreign powers, appointing a dictator, &c. &c. ; all 
these were implications of a complete sovereignty, were 
never disputed, and ought to have been a standard for the 
whole conduct of administration. Undefined powers are 
discretionary powers, limited only by the object for which 
they were given ; in the present case, the independence 
and freedom of America. The confederation made no 
difference ; for as it has not been generally adopted, it had 
no operation. 
</p><p>
But, from what I recollect of it, congress have even descended from the authority which the spirit of that act gives 
them ; while the particular states have no farther attended 
to it, than as it suited their pretensions and convenience. 
It would take too much trouble to enter into particular instances ; each of which, separately, might appear inconsiderable, but united are of serious import. I only mean to 
remark, not to censure. 
</p><p>
But the confederation itself is defective, and requires to 
be altered ; it is neither fit for war, nor peace. The idea 
of an uncontrollable sovereignty in each state, over its internal police, will defeat the other powers given to congress, and make our union feeble and precarious. There 
are instances, without number, where acts necessary for 
the general good, and which rise out of the powers given 
to congress, must interfere with the internal police of the\ 
states ; and there are as many instances in which the particular states, by arrangements of internal police, can effectually, though indirectly, counteract the arrangements 
of congress. You have already had examples of this, for 
which I refer you to your own memory. 
</p><p>
The confederation gives the states, individually, too much 
influence in the affairs of the army ; they should have nothing to do with it. 
</p><p>
The entire formation and disposal of our military forces 
ought to belong to congress. It is an essential cement of 
the union ; and it ought to be the policy of congress to destroy all ideas of state attachments in the army, and make 
it look up wholly to them. For this purpose, all appointments, promotions, and provisions whatsoever, ought to be 
made by them. It maybe apprehended, that this may be 
dangerous to liberty. But nothing appears more evident to 
me, than that we run much greater risk of having a weak 
and disunited federal government, than one which will be 
able to usurp upon the rights of the people. 
</p><p>
Already some of the lines of the army would obey their 
states in opposition to congress, notwithstanding the pains 
we have taken to preserve the unity of the army. If any 
thing would hinder this, it would be the personal influence 
of the General a melancholy a nd mortifying consideration. 
The forms of our state constitutions must always give them 
great weight in our affairs, and will make it too difficult to 
blind them to the pursuit of a common interest, too easy to 
oppose whatever they do not like, and to form partial combinations, subversive of the general one. There is a wide 
difference between our situation and that of an empire under one simple form of government, distributed into counties, provinces, or districts, which have no legislatures, but 
merely magistratical bodies to execute the laws of a common sovereign. Here the danger is, that the sovereign will 
have too much power, and oppress the parts of which it is 
composed. In our case, that of an empire composed of confederative states, each with a government completely organized within itself, having all the means to draw its subjects to a close dependence on itself, the danger is directly 
the reverse. It is, that the common sovereign will not have 
power sufficient to unite the different members together, and 
direct the common forces to the interest and happiness of 
the whole. 
</p><p>
The leagues among the old Grecian republics are a proof 
of this. They were continually at war with each other, and 
for want of union fell a prey to their neighbours. They frequently held general councils, but their resolutions were no 
farther observed, than as they suited the interests and inclinations of all the parties, and, at length, they sunk entirely 
into contempt. 
</p><p>
The Swiss cantons are another proof of the doctrine. 
They have had wars with each other, which would have 
been fatal to them, had not the different powers in their 
neighbourhood been too jealous of one another, and too 
equally matched, to suffer either to take advantage of their 
quarrels. That they have remained so long united at all, 
is to be attributed to their weakness, to their poverty, and 
to the cause just mentioned. These ties will not exist in 
America. A little time hence, some of the states will be 
powerful empires ; and we are so remote from other nations, that we shall have all the leisure and opportunity we 
can wish to cut each other's throats. 
</p><p>
The Germanic corps might also be cited as an example 
in favour of the position. 
</p><p>
The United Provinces may be thought to be one against 
it. But the family of the Stadtholders, whose authority is 
interwoven with the whole government, has been a strong 
link of union between them. Their physical necessities, 
and the habits founded upon them, have contributed to it. 
Each province is too inconsiderable by itself to undertake 
any thing. An analysis of their present constitution would 
show, that they have many ties which would not exist in 
ours ; and that they are by no means a proper model for us. 
</p><p>
Our own experience should satisfy us. We have felt the 
difficulty of drawing out the resources of the country, and 
inducing the states to combine in equal exertions for the 
common cause. The ill success of our last attempt is striking. Some have done a great deal ; others little, or scarcely any thing. The disputes about boundaries, &c. testify 
how flattering a prospect we have of future tranquillity, if 
we do not frame in time a confederacy capable of deciding 
the differences, and compelling the obedience of the respective members. 
</p><p>
The confederation, too, gives the power of the purse too 
entirely to the state legislatures. It should provide perpetual funds in the disposal of congress, by a land tax, poll tax, 
or the like. All imposts upon commerce ought to be laid 
by congress, and appropriated to their use ; for without certain revenues, a government can have no power ; that power which holds the purse strings absolutely, must rule. This 
seems to be a medium, which, without making congress altogether independent, will tend to give reality to its authority. 
</p><p>
Another defect in our system is, want of method and 
energy in the administration. This has partly resulted from 
the other defect ; but in a great degree from prejudice and 
the want of a proper executive. Congress have kept the 
power too much in their own hands, and have meddled 
too much with details of every sort. Congress is properly 
a deliberative corps, and it forgets itself when it attempts 
to play the executive. It is impossible that a body, numerous as it is, constantly fluctuating, can ever act with sufficient decision, or with system. Two thirds of the members, 
one half the time, cannot know what has gone before them, 
or what connexion the subject in hand has to what has been 
transacted on former occasions. The members who have 
been more permanent, will only give information that promotes the side they espouse, in the present case, and will as 
often mislead as enlighten. The variety of business must 
distract, and the proneness of every assembly to debate, 
must at all times delay. 
</p><p>
Lately, congress, convinced of these inconveniences, have 
gone into the measure of appointing boards. But this is, in 
my opinion, a bad plan. A single man, in each department 
of the administration, would be greatly preferable. It would 
give us a chance of more knowledge, more activity, more 
responsibility, and, of course, more zeal and attention. 
Boards partake of a part of the inconveniences of larger assemblies ; their decisions are slower, their energy less, 
their responsibility more diffused. They will not have the 
same abilities and knowledge as an administration by single 
men. Men of the first pretensions will not so readily engage in them, because they will be less conspicuous, of less 
importance, have less opportunity of distinguishing themselves. The members of boards will take less pains to inform themselves and arrive at eminence, because they have 
fewer motives to do it. All these reasons conspire to give 
a preference to the plan of vesting the great executive departments of the state in the hands of individuals. As these men will be, of course, at all times under the direction of 
congress, we shall blend the advantages of a monarchy and 
republic in one constitution. 
</p><p>
A question has been made, whether single men could be 
found to undertake these offices. I think they could ; because there would be then every thing to excite the ambition of candidates. But in order to this, congress, by their 
manner of appointing them, and the line of duty marked 
out, must show that they are in earnest in making these offices, offices of real trust and importance. 
</p><p>
I fear a little vanity has stood in the way of these arrangements, as thotfgh they would lessen the importance of congress, and leave them nothing to do. But they would have 
precisely the same rights and powers as heretofore, happily disencumbered of the detail. They would have to inspect the conduct of their ministers, deliberate upon their 
plans, originate others for the public good, only observing this rule, that they ought to consult their ministers, and 
get all the information and advice they could from them, before they entered into any new measures, or made changes 
in the old. 
</p><p>
A third defect is, the fluctuating constitution of our army. 
This has been a pregnant source of evil ; all our military 
misfortunes, three-fourths of our civil embarrassments, are 
to be ascribed to it. The General has so fully enumerated 
the mischiefs, in a late letter to congress, that I could only 
repeat what he has said, and will, therefore, refer you to 
that letter. 
</p><p>
The imperfect and unequal provision made for the army, 
is a fourth defect, \vhich you will find delineated in the same 
letter. Without a speedy change, the army must dissolve ; 
it is now a mob rather than an army, without clothing, without pay, without provision, without morals, without discipline. We begin to hate the country for its neglect of us ; the country begins to hate us for our oppressions 
of them. Congress have long been jealous of us ; we have 
now lost all confidence in them, and give the worst construction to all they do. Held together by the slenderest 
ties, we are ripening for a dissolution. 
</p><p>
The present mode of supplying the army by state purchases 
is not one of the least considerable defects of our system. 
It is too precarious a dependence, because the states will never be sufficiently impressed with our necessities. Each will 
make its own ease a primary object, the supply of the army a secondary one. The variety of channels through 
which the business is transacted, will multiply the number 
of persons employed, and the opportunities of embezzling 
public money. From the popular spirit on which most of 
the governments turn, the state agents will be men of less 
character and ability ; nor will there be so rigid a responsibility among them as there might easily be among those in 
the employ of the continent ; of course not so much diligence, care, or economy. Very little of the money raised 
in the several states will go into the continental treasury, 
on pretence that it is all exhausted in providing the quotas 
of supplies, and the public will be without funds for the 
other demands of government. The expense will be ultimately much greater, and the advantage much smaller. 
We actually feel the insufficiency of this plan, and have 
reason to dread, under it, a ruinous extremity of want. 
</p><p>
These are the principal defects in the present system that 
now occur to me. There are many inferior ones in the 
organization of particular departments, and many errors 
of administration, which might be pointed out ; but the 
task would be troublesome and tedious, and if we had once 
remedied those I have mentioned, the. others would not be 
attended with much difficulty. 
</p><p>
I shall now propose the remedies which appear to me 
applicable to our circumstances, and necessary to extricate our affairs from their present deplorable situation. 
The first step must be to give congress powers competent to the public exigencies. This may happen in two 
ways : one by resuming and exercising the discretionary 
powers I suppose to have been originally vested in them 
for the safety of the states, and resting their conduct on the 
candour of their countrymen and the necessity of the conjuncture ; the other, by calling immediately a convention 
of all the states, with full authority to conclude finally upon 
a general confederation, stating to them beforehand explicitly the evils arising from a want of power in congress, 
and the impossibility of supporting the contest on its present footing, that the delegates may come possessed of 
proper sentiments, as well as proper authority, to give efficacy to the meeting. Their commission should include a 
right of vesting congress with the whole or a proportion of 
the unoccupied lands, to be employed for the purpose of 
raising a revenue, reserving the jurisdiction to the states by 
whom they are granted. 
</p><p>
The first plan, I expect, will be thought too bold an expedient by the generality of congress ; and, indeed, their 
practice hitherto has so rivetted the opinion of their want 
of power, that the success of this experiment may very 
well be doubted. 
</p><p>
I see no objection to the other mode that has any weight 
in competition with the reasons for it. The convention 
should assemble the first of November next ; the sooner 
the better ; our disorders are too violent to admit of a common or lingering remedy. The reasons for which I require them to be vested with plenipotentiary authority arc, 
that the business may suffer no delay in the execution, and 
may in reality come to effect. A convention may agree 
upon a confederation ; the states, individually, hardly ever 
will. We must have one, at all events, and a vigorous 
one, if we mean to succeed in the contest and be happy 
hereafter. As I said before, to engage the states to comply with this mode, congress ought to confess to them, 
plainly and unanimously, the impracticability, of supporting 
our affairs on the present footing, and without a solid coercive union. I ask that the convention should have a 
power of vesting the whole or a part of the unoccupied 
lands in congress, because it is necessary that body should 
have some property, as a fund for the arrangements of 
finance ; and I know of no other kind that can be given 
them. 
</p><p>
The confederation, in my opinion, should give congress a 
complete sovereignty ; except as to that part of internal 
police which relates to the rights of property and life 
among individuals, and to raising money by internal taxes. 
It is necessary that every thing belonging to this should be 
regulated by the state legislatures. Congress should have 
complete sovereignty in all that relates to war, peace, 
trade, finance ; and to the management of foreign affairs ; 
the right of declaring war, of raising armies, officering, 
paying them, directing their motions in every respect ; of 
equipping fleets, and doing the same with them ; of building fortifications, arsenals, magazines, &c. &c. ; of making 
peace on such conditions as they think proper ; of regulating trade, determining with what countries it shall be carried on; granting indulgences; laying prohibitions on all 
the articles of export or import ; imposing duties, granting 
bounties and premiums for raising, exporting, or importing ; 
and applying to their own use the product of these duties, 
only giving credit to the states on whom they are raised 
in the general account of revenues and expense ; instituting admiralty courts, &c. ; of coining money, establishing 
banks on such terms, and with such privileges, as they 
think proper ; appropriating funds, and doing whatever 
else relates to the operations of finance ; transacting 
every thing with foreign nations ; making alliances, offensive and defensive, treaties of commerce, &c. &c. 
The confederation should provide certain perpetual revenues, productive and easy of collection ; a land tax, poll 
tax, or the like, which, together with the duties on trade, 
and the unlocated lands, would give congress a substantial 
existence, and a stable foundation for their schemes of 
finance. What more supplies were necessary, should be 
occasionally demanded of the states, in the present mode of 
quotas. 
</p><p>
The second step I would recommend is, that congress 
should instantly appoint the following great officers of 
state : A Secretary for Foreign Affairs ; a President of 
War ; a President of Marine ; a Financier ; a President of 
Trade ; instead of this last, a Board of Trade may be preferable, as the regulations of trade are slow and guarded, 
and require prudence and experience, (more than other 
qualities,) for which boards are very well adapted. 
</p><p>
Congress should choose for these offices, men of the first 
abilities, property, and character, in the continent ; and 
such as have had the best opportunities of being acquainted 
with the several branches. <a href='/results.php?tla=pjs' rel='colleague met kin'>General Schuyler</a>, whom you 
mentioned, would make an excellent President of War ; 
General McDougal a very good President of Marine ; Mr. 
Robert Morris would have many things in his favour for 
the department of Finance. He could, by his own personal influence, give great weight to the measures he should 
adopt. I dare say, men equally capable may be found for 
the other departments. 
</p><p>
I know not if it would not be a good plan to let the Financier be President of the Board of Trade ; but he should 
only have a casting voice in determining questions there. 
There is a connexion between trade and finance, which 
ought to make the director of one acquainted with the 
other; but the financier should not direct the affairs of 
trade, because, for the sake of acquiring reputation by increasing the revenues, he might adopt measures that would 
depress trade. In what relates to finance he should be 
alone. 
</p><p>
These officers should have nearly the same powers and 
functions as those in France analogous to them, and each 
should be chief in his department, with subordinate boards, 
composed of assistants, clerks, &c., to execute his orders. 
</p><p>
In my opinion, a plan of this kind would be of inconceivable utility to our affairs ; its benefits would be very speedily felt. It would give new life and energy to the operations of government. Business would be conducted with 
despatch, method, and system. A million of abuses now 
existing would be corrected, and judicious plans would be 
formed and executed for the public good. 
</p><p>
Another step of immediate necessity is, to recruit the 
army for the war, or at least for three years. This must 
be done by a mode similar to that which is practised in 
Sweden. There the inhabitants are thrown into classes of 
sixteen, and when the sovereign wants men, each of these 
classes must furnish one. They raise a fixed sum of money, and if one of the class is willing to become a soldier, 
he receives the money and offers himself a volunteer ; if 
none is found to do this, a draft is made, and he on whom 
the lot falls, receives the money, and is obliged to serve. 
The minds of the people are prepared for a thing of this 
kind ; the heavy bounties they have been obliged to pay 
for men to serve a few months, must have disgusted them 
with this mode, and made them desirous of another, that 
will, once for all, answer the public purposes, and obviate 
a repetition of the demand. It ought by all means to be 
attempted ; and congress should frame a general plan, and 
press the execution upon the states. When the confederation comes to be framed, it ought to provide for this, by 
a fundamental law ; and hereafter there would be no doubt 
of the success. But we cannot now wait for this : we 
want to replace the men whose times of service will expire the first of January ; for then, without this, we shall 
have no army remaining, and the enemy may do what 
they please. The General, in his letter already quoted, 
has assigned the most substantial reasons for paying immediate attention to this point. 
</p><p>
Congress should endeavour, both upon their credit in Europe, and by every possible exertion in this country, to provide clothing for their officers, and should abolish the whole 
system of state supplies. The making good the depreciation of the currency, and all other compensations to the 
army, should be immediately taken up by congress, and 
not left to the states ; if they would have the accounts of 
depreciation liquidated, and governmental certificates given 
for what is due, in specie, or an equivalent to specie, it 
would give satisfaction, appointing periodical settlements 
for future depreciation. 
</p><p>
The placing the officers upon half-pay, during life, would 
be a great stroke of policy, and would give congress a 
stronger tie upon them than any thing else they can do. 
No man, that reflects a moment, but will prefer a permanent provision of this kind, to any temporary compensation ; nor is it opposed to economy ; the difference between 
this, and what has been already done, will be insignificant. 
The benefit of it to the widows, should be confined to those 
whose husbands die during the war. As to the survivors, 
not more than one-half, on the usual calculation of men's 
lives, will exceed the seven years for which the half-pay is 
already established. Besides this, whatever may be the 
visionary speculations of some men at this time, we shall 
find it indispensable, after the war, to keep on foot a considerable body of troops ; and all the officers retained for 
this purpose, must be deducted out of the half-pay list. If 
any one will take the pains to calculate the expense on 
these principles, I am persuaded he will find the addition 
of expense from the establishment proposed, by no means 
a national object. 
</p><p>
The advantages of securing the attachment of the army 
to congress, and binding them to the service, by substantial 
ties, are immense. 
</p><p>
We should, then, have discipline ; an army in reality, as 
well as in name. Congress would then have a solid basis 
of authority and consequence ; for with me it is an axiom, 
that in our constitution an army is essential to the American union. 
</p><p>
The providing of supplies, is the pivot of every thing 
else ; (though a well constituted army would not, in a small 
degree, conduce to this, by giving consistency and weight 
to government,) there are four ways, all which must be 
united, a foreign loan, heavy pecuniary taxes, a 
tax in kind, a bank founded on public and private credit. 
</p><p>
As to a foreign loan, I dare say, congress are doing every 
thing in their power to obtain it. The most effectual way 
will be, to tell France that without it, we must make terms 
with Great Britain. This must be done with plainness and 
firmness,but with respect and without petulance ; not as a menace, but as a candid declaration of our circumstances. We 
need not fear to be deserted by France ; her interest and 
honour are too deeply involved in our fate ; and she can 
make no possible compromise. She can assist us, if she is 
convinced it is absolutely necessary, either by lending us, 
herself, or by becoming our surety, or by influencing Spain. 
It has been to me astonishing, how any man could have 
doubted, at any period of our affairs, of the necessity of a 
foreign loan. It was self-evident that we had not a fund 
of wealth in this country, capable of affording revenues 
equal to the expenses. We must, then, create artificial revenues, or borrow ; the first was done, but it ought to have 
been foreseen, that the expedient could not last, and we 
should have provided in time for its failure. 
Here was an error of congress. I have good reason to 
believe, that measures were not taken in earnest early 
enough to procure a loan abroad : I give you my honour, 
that from our first outset, I thought as I do now ; and wished 
for a foreign loan, not only because I foresaw it would be 
essential, but because I considered it a tie upon the nation 
from which it was derived, and as a mean to prop our cause 
in Europe. 
</p><p>
Concerning the necessity of heavy pecuniary taxes, I 
need say nothing, as it is a point in which every body is 
agreed; nor is there any danger, that the product of any 
taxes raised in this way, will overburthen the people, or exceed the wants of the public. Indeed, if all the paper in 
circulation were drawn annually into the treasury, it would 
neither do one nor the other. 
</p><p>
As to a tax in kind, the necessity of it results from this 
principle, that the money in circulation is not a sufficient 
representative of the productions of the country, and consequently no revenues raised from it, as a medium, can be 
a competent representative of that part of the products 
of the country, which it is bound to contribute to the support 
of the public. The public, therefore, to obtain its due, or 
satisfy its just demands and its wants, must call for a part 
of these products themselves. This is done in all those 
countries which are not commercial ; in Russia, Prussia, 
Denmark, Sweden, &c., and is peculiarly necessary in our 
case. 
</p><p>
Congress, in calling for specific supplies, seem to have 
had this in view ; but their intention has not been answered. The states, in general, have undertaken to furnish the 
supplies by purchase, a mode, as I have observed, attended with every inconvenience, and subverting the principle on which the supplies were demanded, the insufficiency of our circulating medium, as a representative for 
the labour and commodities of the country. It is, therefore, necessary, that congress should be more explicit; 
should form the outlines of a plan for a tax in kind, and recommend it to the states, as a measure of absolute necessity. 
</p><p>
The general idea I have of a plan is, that a respectable 
man should be appointed by the state in each county to 
collect the taxes, and form magazines ; that congress should 
have in each state an officer to superintend the whole, and 
that the state collectors should be subordinate and responsible to them. This continental superintendent might be 
subject to the general direction of the quarter-master-general, or not, as might be deemed best ; but if not subject to 
him, he should be obliged to make monthly returns to the 
President at War, who should instruct him what proportion to deliver to the quarter-master-general. It may be 
necessary, that the superintendents should sometimes have 
power to dispose of the articles in their possession, on public account ; for it would happen, that the contributions, 
in places remote from the army, could not be transported 
to the theatre of operations without too great expense ; in 
which case, it would be eligible to dispose of them, and 
purchase with the money so raised in the counties near the 
immediate scene of war. 
</p><p>
I know the objections which may be raised to this plan, 
its tendency to discourage industry and the like ; but 
necessity calls for it ; we cannot proceed without, and less 
evils must give place to greater. It is, besides, practised 
with success in other countries, and why not in this ? It 
may be said, the examples cited are from nations under 
despotic governments, and that the same would not be 
practicable with us ; but I contend, where the public good 
is evidently the object, more may be effected in governments like ours, than in any other. It has been a constant 
remark, that free countries have ever paid the heaviest 
taxes ; the obedience of a free people to general laws, however hard they bear, is ever more perfect than that of 
slaves to the arbitrary will of a prince. To this, it may be 
added, that Sweden was always a free government, and 
is so now, in a great degree, notwithstanding the late revolution. 
</p><p>
How far it may be practicable to erect a bank on the faint 
credit of the public, and of individuals, can only be certainly 
determined by the experiment ; but it is of so much importance that the experiment ought to be fully tried. When I 
saw the subscriptions going on to the bank established for 
supplying the army, I was in hopes it was only the embryo 
of a more permanent and extensive establishment. But I 
have reason to believe I shall be disappointed. It does not 
seem to be at all conducted on the true principles of a bank. 
The directors of it are purchasing with their stock, instead 
of bank notes as I expected ; in consequence of which, it 
must turn out to be a mere subscription of a particular sum 
of money, for a particular purpose. 
</p><p>
Paper credit never was long supported in any country, 
on a national scale, where it was not founded on the joint 
basis of public and private credit. An attempt to establish 
it on public credit alone, in France, under the auspices of 
Mr. Law, nearly ruined the kingdom. We have seen the 
effects of it in America ; and every successive experiment 
proves the futility of the attempt. Our new money is depreciating almost as fast as the old, though it has, in some 
states, as real funds as paper money ever had. The reason is, that the moneyed men have not an immediate interest 
to uphold its credit. They may even, in many ways, find 
it their interest to undermine it. The only certain manner 
to obtain a permanent paper credit, is to engage the moneyed 
interest immediately in it, by making them contribute the 
whole or part of the stock, and giving them the whole or 
part of the profits. 
</p><p>
The invention of banks, on the modern principle, originated in Venice. There, the public, and a company of moneyed men, are mutually concerned. The Eank of England 
unites public authority and faith, with private credit ; and 
hence we see what a vast fabric of paper credit is raised on 
a visionary basis. Had it not been for this, England would 
never have found sufficient funds to carry on her wars ; but 
with the help of this, she has done, and is doing, wonders. 
The Bank of Amsterdam is on a similar foundation. 
</p><p>
And why cannot we have an American bank ? Are our 
moneyed men less enlightened to their own interest, or less 
enterprising in the pursuit ? I believe the fault is in government, which does not exert itself to engage them in 
such a scheme. It is true, the individuals in America are 
not very rich ; but this would not prevent their instituting 
a bank; it would only prevent its being done with such 
ample funds as in other countries. Have they not sufficient 
confidence in the government, and in the issue of the cause ? 
Let the government endeavour to inspire that confidence, 
by adopting the measures I have recommended, or others 
equivalent to them. Let it exert itself to procure a solid 
confederation, to establish a good plan of executive administration, to form a permanent military force, to obtain, at all events, a foreign loan. If these things were in 
a train of vigorous execution, it would give a new spring 
to our affairs ; government would recover its respectability, 
and individuals would renounce their diffidence. 
</p><p>
The object I should propose to myself, in the first instance, from a bank, would be an auxiliary mode of supplies ; for which purpose contracts should be made between 
government and the bank, on terms liberal and advantageous to the latter. Every thing should be done, in the first 
instance, to encourage the bank ; after it gets well established, it will take care of itself, and government may make the 
best terms it can for itself. 
</p><p>
The first step to establishing the bank, will be to engage 
a number of moneyed men of influence to relish the project, 
and make it a business. The subscribers to that lately established, are the fittest persons that can be found ; and their 
plan may be interwoven. 
</p><p>
The outlines of my plan would be to open subscriptions, 
in all the states, for the stock, which we will suppose to be 
one million of pounds. Real property, of every kind, as 
well as specie, should be deemed good stock ; but at least 
a fourth part of the subscription should be in specie or 
plate. There should be one great company, in three divisions ; in Virginia, <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, and at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; or two, 
at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. The bank should have a right 
to issue bank notes, bearing two per cent, interest for the 
whole of their stock ; but not to exceed it. These notes 
may be payable every three months, or oftener ; and the 
faith of government must be pledged for the support of the 
bank. It must, therefore, have a right, from time to time, 
to inspect its operations ; and must appoint inspectors for 
the purpose. 
</p><p>
The advantages of the bank may consist in this : in the 
profits of the contracts made with government, which should 
bear interest, to be annually paid in specie ; in the loan of 
money at interest, say six per cent. ; in purchasing lives by 
annuities, as practised in England, &c. The benefit resulting to the company is evident, from the consideration, that 
they may employ in circulation a great deal more money 
than they have specie in stock, on the credit of the real 
property which they will have in other use. This money 
will be employed, either in fulfilling their contracts with 
the public, by which, also, they will gain a profit, or in 
loans, at an advantageous interest, or in annuities. 
</p><p>
The bank may be allowed to purchase plate and bullion, 
and coin money, allowing government a part of the profit. 
</p><p>
I make the bank notes bear interest, to obtain a readier 
currency, and to induce the holders to prefer them to specie, to prevent too great a run upon the bank, at any time, 
beyond its ability to pay. 
</p><p>
If government can obtain a foreign loan, it should lend to 
the bank, on easy terms, to extend its influence, and facilitate a compliance with its engagements. If government 
could engage the states to raise a sum of money in specie, 
to be deposited in bank, in the same manner, it would be 
of the greatest consequence. If government could prevail 
on the enthusiasm of the people, to make a contribution in 
plate, for the same purpose, it would be a master stroke. 
Things of this kind sometimes succeed in popular contests; 
and if undertaken with address, I should not despair of its 
success ; but I should not be sanguine. 
</p><p>
The bank may be instituted for a term of years, by way 
of trial ; and the particular privilege of coining money be 
for a term still shorter. 
</p><p>
A temporary transfer of it to a particular company can 
have no inconvenience, as the government are in no condition to improve this resource ; nor could it, in our circumstances, be an object to it, though with the industry of a 
knot of individuals, it might be a valuable one to them. 
</p><p>
A bank of this kind, even in its commencement, would 
answer the most valuable purposes to government, and to 
the proprietors ; in its progress, the advantages will exceed 
calculation. It will promote commerce, by furnishing a 
more extensive medium, which we greatly want, in our circumstances. I mean a more extensive, valuable medium. 
We have an enormous nominal one at this time ; but it is 
only a name. 
</p><p>
In the present unsettled state of things, in this country, 
we can hardly draw inferences, from what has happened in 
others ; otherwise I should be certain of the success of this 
scheme ; but I think it has enough in its favour to be worthy of trial. 
</p><p>
I have only skimmed the surface of the different subjects 
I have introduced. Should the plans recommended come 
into contemplation in earnest, and you desire my farther 
thoughts, I will endeavour to give them more form and 
particularity. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded a solid confederation, a permanent army, a reasonable prospect of subsisting it, would give us 
treble consideration in Europe, and produce a peace this 
winter. 
</p><p>
If a convention is called, the minds of all the states and 
the people ought to be prepared to receive its determinations by sensible and popular writings, which should conform 
to the views of congress. There are epochs in human affairs, when novelty even is useful. If a general opinion 
prevails that the old way is bad, whether true or false, and 
this obstructs or relaxes the operations of the public service, a change is necessary if it be but for the sake of 
change. This is exactly the case now. 'Tis an universal 
sentiment that our present system is a bad one, and that 
things do not go right on this account. The measure of a 
convention would revive the hopes of the people, and give 
a new direction to their passions, which may be improved 
in carrying points of substantial utility. The eastern states 
have already pointed out this mode to congress : they ought 
to take the hint, and anticipate the others. 
</p><p>
And in future, my dear sir, two things let me recommend, 
as fundamental rules for the conduct of congress : to attach 
the army to them by every motive, to maintain an authority, (not domineering,) in all their measures with the 
states. The manner in which a thing is done, has more influence than is commonly imagined. Men are governed 
by opinion : this opinion is as much influenced by appearances as by realities. If a government appears to be confident of its own powers, it is the surest way to inspire the 
same confidence in others. If it is diffident, it may be certain there will be a still greater diffidence in others, and 
that its authority will not only be distrusted, controverted, 
but contemned. 
</p><p>
I wish, too, congress would always consider, that a kindness consists as much in the manner as in the thing. The best 
things, done hesitatingly, and with an ill grace, lose their 
effect, and produce disgust rather than satisfaction or gratitude. In what congress have at any time done for the army, 
they have commonly been too late. They have seemed to 
yield to importunity, rather than to sentiments of justice, or 
to a regard to the accommodation of their troops. An attention to this idea is of more importance than it may be 
thought. I, who have seen all the workings and progress 
of the present discontents, am convinced that a want of 
this has not been among the most inconsiderable causes. 
</p><p>
You will perceive, my dear sir, this letter is hastily written, and with a confidential freedom, not as to a member 
of congress, whose feelings may be sore at the prevailing 
clamour ; but as to a friend, who is in a situation to remedy 
public disorders, who wishes for nothing so much as truth, 
and who is desirous for information, even from those less 
capable of judging than himself. I have not even time to 
correct and copy, and only enough to add, that I am, very 
truly and affectionately, dear sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient servant,

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Some time last fall, when I spoke to your excellency about 
going to the southward, I explained to you candidly my 
feelings with respect to military reputation, and how much 
it was my object to act a conspicuous part in some enterprise, that might perhaps raise my character as a soldier 
above mediocrity. You were so good as to say, you would 
be glad to furnish me with an occasion. When the expedition to Staten Island was afoot, a favourable one seemed 
to offer. There was a battalion without a field officer, the 
command of which, I thought, as it was accidental, might 
be given to me without inconvenience. I made an application for it through the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>Marquis</a>, who informed me of your 
refusal on two principles, one, that the giving me a whole 
battalion might be a subject of dissatisfaction ; the other, 
that if any accident should happen to me in the present state 
of your family, you would be embarrassed for the necessary assistance. 
</p><p>
The project. you now have in contemplation affords another opportunity. I have p. variety of reasons, that press 
me to desire ardently to have it in my power to improve it. 
I take the liberty to observe, that the command may now 
be proportioned to my rank, and that the second objection 
ceases to operate, as during the period of establishing our 
winter quarters, there will be a suspension of material business ; besides which, my peculiar situation will, in any case, 
call me away from the army in a few days, and Mr. Harrison may be expected back early next month. My command may consist of one hundred and fifty or two hundred 
men, composed of fifty men of Major Gibbes' corps, fifty 
from Colonel Meigs' regiment, and fifty or an hundred more 
from the light infantry, Major Gibbes to be my major. 
The hundred men from here may move on Friday morning towards , which will strengthen the appearances for 
Staten Island, to form a junction on the other side of the Passaic; 
</p><p>
I suggest this mode, to avoid the complaints that might 
arise from composing my party wholly of the light infantry, 
which might give umbrage to the officers of that corps, who 
on this plan can have no just subject for it. 
</p><p>
The primary idea may be, if circumstances permit, to attempt with my detachment Byard's Hill. Should we arrive early enough to undertake it, I should prefer It to any 
thing else, both for the brilliancy of the attempt in itself, and 
the decisive consequences of which its success would be productive. If we arrive too late to make this eligible, (as 
there is reason to apprehend,) my corps may form the van 
of one of the other attacks, and Byard's Hill will be a pretext for my being employed in the affair, on a supposition of 
my knowing the ground, Which is partly true. I flatter 
myself, also, that my military character stands so well in 
the army, as to reconcile the officers in general to the measure. All circumstances considered, I venture to say any 
exceptions which might be taken, would be unreasonable. 
</p><p>
I take this method of making the request to avoid the 
embarrassment of a personal explanation. I shall only add, 
that however much I have the matter at heart, I wish your 
excellency entirely to consult your own inclination, and not 
from a disposition to oblige me, to do any thing that may be 
disagreeable to you. It will, nevertheless, make me singularly happy if your wishes correspond with mine.

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I had the pleasure of writing you last, an unexpected change has taken place in my situation. I am no 
longer a member of the General's family. This information will surprise you, and the manner of the change will 
surprise you more. Two days ago, the General and I 
passed each other on the stairs ; he told me he wanted 
to speak to me, I answered that I would wait upon him 
immediately. I went below, and delivered Mr. Tilghman 
a letter to be sent to the commissary, containing an order 
of a pressing and interesting nature. 
</p><p>
Returning to the General, I was stopped on the way by 
the <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>Marquis de La Fayette</a>, and we conversed together 
about a minute on a matter of business. He can testify 
how impatient I was to get back, and that I left him in a 
manner which, but for our intimacy, would have been more 
than abrupt. Instead of finding the General, as is usual, in 
his room, I met him at the head of the stairs, where accosting me in an angry tone, " <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel='me'>Colonel Hamilton</a>, (said he,) 
you have kept me waiting at the head of the stairs these 
ten minutes ; I must tell you, sir, you treat me with disrespect." I replied, without petulancy, but with decision, 
I am not conscious of it, sir, but since you have thought 
it necessary to tell me so, we part." " Very well, sir, (said 
he,) if it be your choice," or something to this effect, and we 
separated. I sincerely believe my absence, which gave so 
much umbrage, did not last two minutes. 
</p><p>
In less than an hour after, Tilghman came to me in the 
General's name, assuring me of his great confidence in my 
abilities, integrity, usefulness, &c., and of his desire, in a 
candid conversation, to heal a difference which could not 
have happened but in a moment of passion. I requested 
Mr. Tilghman to tell him, 1st. That I had taken my resolution in a manner not to be revoked. 2d. That as a conversation could serve no other purpose than to produce explanations, mutually disagreeable, though I certainly would 
not refuse an interview, if he desired it, yet I would be happy, if he would permit me to decline it. 3d. That though 
determined to leave the family, the same principles which 
had kept me so long in it, would continue to direct my conduct towards him when out of it. 4th. That, however, I 
did not wish to distress him, or the public business, by quitting him before he could derive other assistance by the return of some of the gentlemen who were absent. 5th. And 
that in the mean time, it depended on him, to let our behaviour to each other be the same as if nothing had happened. He consented to decline the conversation, and thanked 
me for my offer of continuing my aid in the manner I had 
mentioned. 
</p><p>
I have given you so particular a detail of our difference, 
from the desire I have to justify myself in your opinion. 
Perhaps you may think I was precipitate in rejecting the 
overture made by the General to an accommodation. I 
assure you, my dear sir, it was not the effect of resentment ; 
it was the deliberate result of maxims I had long formed 
for the government of my own conduct. 
</p><p>
I always disliked the office of an aid-de-camp, as having 
in it a kind of personal dependence. I refused to serve in 
this capacity with two Major Generals, at an early period 
of the war. Infected, however, with the enthusiasm of the 
times, an idea of the General's character overcame my 
scruples, and induced me to accept his invitation to enter 
into his family   . I(. has been often with great difficulty that I have prevailed upon myself not to renounce it ; 
but while, from motives of public utility, I was doing violence to my feelings, I was always determined, if there 
should ever happen a breach between us, never to consent 
to an accommodation. I was persuaded, that when once 
that nice barrier, which marked the boundaries of what we 
owed to each other, should be thrown down, it might be 
propped again, but could never be restored. 
</p><p>
The General is a very honest man ; his competitors 
have slender abilities, and less integrity. His popularity 
has often been essential to the safety of America, and is 
still of great importance to it. These considerations have 
influenced my past conduct respecting him, and will influence my future ; I think it is necessary he should be 
supported. 
</p><p>
His estimation in your mind, whatever maybe its amount, 
I am persuaded has been formed on principles, which a 
circumstance like this cannot materially affect ; but if I 
thought it could diminish your friendship for him, I should 
almost forego the motives that urge me to justify myself to 
you. I wish what I have said to make no other impression, than to satisfy you I have not been in the wrong. It 
is also said in confidence, as a public knowledge of the 
breach would, in many ways, have an ill effect. It will, 
probably, be the policy of both sides to conceal it, and cover the separation with some plausible pretext. I am importuned by such of my friends as are privy to the affair, to 
listen to a reconciliation ; but my resolution is unalterable. 
</p><p>
As I cannot think of quitting the army during the war, I 
have a project of re-entering into the artillery, by taking Lieutenant Colonel Forrest's place, who is desirous of retiring on half-pay. I have not, however, made up my mind 
upon this head, as I should be obliged to come in the 
youngest lieutenant colonel instead of the eldest, which 
I ought to have been by natural succession, had I remained 
in the corps; and, at the same time, to resume studies relative to the profession, which to avoid inferiority, must be 
laborious. 
</p><p>
If a handsome command in the campaign in the light infantry should offer itself, I shall balance between this and 
the artillery. My situation in the latter would be more 
solid and permanent ; but as I ^hope the war will not last 
long enough to make it progressive, this consideration has 
the less force. A command for the campaign, would leave 
me the winter to prosecute studies relative to my future 
career in life   . I have written to you on this subject 
with all the freedom and confidence to which you have a 
right, and with an assurance of the interest you take in all

SIR, 
</p><p>
I imagine your excellency has been informed, that in 
consequence of the resolution of congress for granting commissions to aid-de-camps appointed under the former establishment, I have obtained one of lieutenant colonel in the 
army of the United States, bearing rank since the first of 
March, 1777. 
</p><p>
It is become necessary to me to apply to your excellency, 
to know in what manner you foresee you will be able to 
employ me in the ensuing campaign. I am ready to enter 
into activity whenever you think proper ; though I am not 
anxious to do it till the army takes the field, as before that 
period I perceive no object. 
</p><p>
Unconnected as I am with any regiment, I can have no 
other command than in a light corps, and I flatter myself 
my pretensions to this are good. 
</p><p>
Your excellency knows I have been in actual service 
since the beginning of '76. I began in the line, and had I 
continued there, I ought, in justice, to have been more advanced in rank than I now am. I believe my conduct in 
the different capacities in which I have acted, has appeared 
to the officers of the army in general such as to merit their 
confidence and esteem ; and I cannot suppose them to be 
so ungenerous as not to see me with pleasure put into a 
situation still to exercise the disposition I have always had, 
of being useful to the United States. I mention these things 
only to show that I do not apprehend the same difficulties 
can exist in my case, (which is peculiar,) that have opposed 
the appointment to commands of some other officers, not 
belonging to what is called the line. 
</p><p>
Though the light infantry is chiefly formed, yet being 
detached to the southward, I take it for granted there will 
be a van guard by detachment formed for this army. 
I have the honour to be, very respectfully, 
</p><p>
Your excellency's most obedient servant,

<p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I am extremely sorry to have embarrassed you by my 
late application, and that you should think there are insuperable obstacles to a compliance with it. Having renounced my expectations. I have no other inducement for 
troubling your excellency with a second letter, than to obviate the appearance of having desired a thing inconsistent 
with the good of the service, while I was acquainted with 
the circumstances that made it so. 
</p><p>
I was too interested a spectator of what happened in the 
case of Major McPherson, not to have remarked, and not 
to recollect, all the circumstances. The opposition turned, ostensibly, on his being a brevet officer, yet having a command in a corps formed entirely from one line ; the propriety of his being employed in a detachment from the army at large, so far as I remember, was not disputed. In 
delicacy to Major McPherson, no personal objections were 
formally made, but in reality they existed and contributed 
to the discontent. It was thought a peculiar hardship, that 
a gentleman who had, for a long time, fought against us, 
and had not taken part with us till a late period, and when 
our affairs had assumed a more prosperous aspect, should 
be preferred in one of the most honorary commands of the 
service. Your excellency must be convinced, that I mention this in no other view than to show the sentiments of 
the officers at the time, and the whole grounds of the opposition. My esteem for Major McPherson, and other reasons, make it impossible I can have a different intention. 
</p><p>
I know less of the motives of dissatisfaction in the cases 
of Colonel Gimat and Major Galvan ; but I have understood, that it is founded on their being appointed in the light 
corps for two successive campaigns. 
</p><p>
It would be uncandid in me not to acknowledge, that I 
believe a disposition to exclude brevet officers in general 
from command, has a great share in the opposition, in every 
instance, and that so far it affects my case. But, at the same 
time, it appeans to me, this principle alone can never be productive of more than momentary murmurs, where it is not 
seconded by some plausible pretext. I also am convinced, 
that the Pennsylvania officers, for their own sakes, repented 
the rash steps they had taken, and, on cool reflection, were 
happy in an opportunity to relinquish their menaces of quitting a service to which they were attached by habit, inclination, and interest, as well as by patriotism. I believe, too, 
we shall never have a similar instance in the army, unless 
the practice should be carried to excess. Major Galvan, I 
am told, will probably be relieved. Colonel Gimat will be 
then the only brevet officer remaining in command. Your 
excellency is the best judge of the proper limits; and there 
can be no doubt, that the rights of particular officers ought 
to give place to the general good and tranquillity of the service. 
</p><p>
I cannot forbear repeating, that my case is peculiar, and 
dissimilar to all the former ; it is distinguished by the circumstances I have before intimated, my early entrance 
into the service, my having made the campaign of '76, 
the most disagreeable of the war, at the head of a company 
of artillery, and having been entitled, in that corps, to a 
rank, equal in degree, more ancient in date, than I now possess, my having made all the subsequent campaigns in 
the family of the commander-in-chief, in a constant course 
of important and laborious service. These are my pretensions, at this advanced period of the war, to being employed 
in the only way which my situation admits ; and I imagine 
they would have their weight in the minds of the officers in 
general. I only urge them a second time, as reasons which 
will not suffer me to view the matter in the same light with 
your excellency, or to regard as impracticable my appointment in a light corps, should there be one formed. I entreat they may be understood in this sense only. I am incapable of wishing to obtain any object by importunity. 
</p><p>
I assure your excellency, that I am too well persuaded of 
your candour, to attribute your refusal to any other cause 
than an apprehension of inconveniences that may attend the 
appointment. 
</p><p>
I have the honour to be, with perfect respect, sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
<a href="/results.php?tla=alh" rel="me">A. HAMILTON.</a>.
</p><p>
P. S. I have used the term brevet in the sense your excellency appears to have understood it, as signifying, in general, all officers not attached to any established corps. Congress, however, seem to have made a distinction ; they give 
only a kind of warrant to those whom they designate as 
brevet officers ; mine is a regular commission.

</p><p>
I was among the first who were convinced that an administration by single men was essential to the proper 
management of the affairs of this country. I am persuaded 
it is the only resource we have to extricate ourselves from 
the distresses which threaten the subversion of our cause. 
It is palpable that the people have lost all confidence in our 
public councils, and it is a fact, of which I dare say you are 
as well apprized as myself, that our friends in Europe are 
in the same disposition. I have been in a situation that 
has enabled me to obtain a better idea of this than most 
others, and I venture to assert, that the court of France 
will never give half the succours to this country while congress hold the reins of administration in their own hands, 
which they would grant if these were entrusted to individuals of established reputation, and conspicuous for probity, 
abilities, and fortune. 
With respect to ourselves, there is so manifest and rooted 
a diffidence of the government, that if we could be assured 
the future measures of congress would be dictated by the 
most perfect wisdom and public spirit, there would be stiH 
a necessity for a change in the forms of our administration, 
to give a new spring and current to the passions and hopes 
of the people. To me it appears evident, that an executive 
ministry, composed of men wjth the qualifications I have 
described, would speedily restore the credit of government 
abroad and at home ; would induce our allies to great exertions in our behalf; would inspire confidence in moneyed 
men in Europe, as well as in America, to lend us those 
sums of which it may be demonstrated we stand in need, 
from the disproportion of our national wealth to the expenses of the war. 
</p><p>
I hope, sir, you will not consider it a compliment, when 
I assure you that I heard, with the greatest satisfaction, of 
your nomination to the department of finance. 
</p><p>
In a letter of mine last summer to Mr. Duane, urging, 
among other things, the plan of an executive ministry, I 
mentioned you as the person who ought to fill that department. I know of no other in America who unites so many 
advantages ; and, of course, every impediment to your acceptance is to me a subject of chagrin. I flatter myself, 
congress will not preclude the public from your services, by 
an obstinate refusal of reasonable conditions ; and as one 
deeply interested in the event, I am happy in believing you 
will not easily be discouraged from undertaking an office, 
by which you may render America and the world no less a service than the establishment of American independence. 'Tis by introducing order into our finances, by restoring 
public credit, not by gaining battles, that we are finally to 
attain our object. 'Tis by putting ourselves in a condition 
to continue the war, not by temporary, violent, and unnatural efforts to bring it to a decisive issue, that we shall in 
reality bring it to a speedy and successful one. In the 
frankness of truth, I believe, sir, you are the man best capable of performing this great work. 
</p><p>
In expectation that all difficulties will be removed, and 
that you will ultimately act on terms you approve, I take 
the liberty to submit to you some ideas, relative to the objects of your department. I pretend not to be an able 
financier. It is a part of administration which has been 
least in my way, and of course has least occupied my inquiries and reflections ; neither have I had leisure or materials 
to make accurate calculations. I have been obliged to depend on memory for important facts, for want of the authorities from which they are drawn. 
</p><p>
With all these disadvantages, my plan must necessarily 
be crude and defective ; but it may be a basis for something 
more perfect, or if it contains any hints that may be of use 
to you, the trouble I have taken myself, or may give you, 
will not be misapplied. At any rate, the confidence I have 
in your judgement, assures me that you will receive with 
pleasure communications of this sort. If they contain any 
thing useful, they will promote your views, and the public 
benefit ; if not , the only evil is the trouble of reading them ; 
and the best informed will frequently derive lights even 
from the reveries of projectors and quacks. There is scarcely 
any plan so bad as not to have something good in it. I trust 
mine to your candour, with this apology, you will at least 
do justice to my intention. 
</p><p>
With these preliminary remarks, he proceeds to the inquiry as to " what ought to be done in the finances of the 
United States ?" First, to estimate its capacity for revenue, and the proportion between its abilities and its wants, 
by examining the proportion the revenues other countries 
have borne to their wealth, and applying the rule to America. Second, by comparing the result of that rule with the 
product of taxes in those states which have been most earnest in taxation. 
</p><p>
The result obtained, by an examination applied to Great 
Britain, France, and the United Provinces was, that the revenue is one fourth of the circulating cash in commercial 
countries, so far as this is a just representative of its labour 
and commodities. 
</p><p>
He then states the current cash of America, previous to 
the war, to have been about thirty millions of dollars, of 
which one eighth was specie ; and that the proper revenue, 
at that time, was seven and a half million of dollars. But 
as the system of taxation was carried to an extreme in those 
countries, that the rule is inapplicable in its full extent to 
the United States ; though a much larger amount than might 
be expected, could be levied during the war, without burthening the poorer classes, from the greater equality of fortunes, and a more equal division of the public burthens. 
Making the necessary qualifications, he arrives at the result, that the present revenue was one fifth less than it had 
been before the war. Having adverted to the causes of the 
diminished circulation, which he considers as principally 
artificial, he comes to the conclusion, allowing for the diminution of foreign trade, and the loss of territory, that the 
states have a nett revenue of six millions of dollars ; a result which is nearly confirmed by a detailed examination of 
the previous product of the taxes, of which Massachusetts 
was supposed to have raised one fifth. 
</p><p>
Taking this as the amount of revenue, he next proceeds 
to ascertain, by general rules, the military capacity of the 
country, which although it had at times risen to thirty thousand men, might be estimated at twenty thousand. The 
expenses incident to the support of which force, with the 
necessary civil expenditures, rendering the amount of the 
annual charges of the countiy less than eleven million of 
dollars, left a deficit of four and a half millions to be supplied 
by credit, foreign or domestic. He then examines the prospect from foreign loans, which taking into view the political and financial embarrassments of France, he supposes 
may justify an expectation of a loan annually of eight or ten 
million of livres, which would only meet a third of the national wants. 
</p><p>
From Spain, after remarking on her cold and passive 
policy, in pursuance of which the bills drawn on her, though 
not rejected, had not been paid, he expects nothing. 
Their method of prosecuting the war, can scarcely be resolved into Spanish supineness, but seems to have a more 
corrupt original. A bigotted prince, governed by a greedy 
confessor, is a character on which little dependence can be 
placed," 
</p><p>
Holland, as a government, stands in need of all its credit 
for its own uses. But from the Dutch capitalists much 
might be expected, though not on the faith of the United 
States, by the establishment of a system such as he is about 
to propose. The prospects of internal loans to government, both from the want of confidence, and the more advantageous terms of traffic in which individual wealth could 
be employed, he rates very low. 
</p><p>
"To surmount these obstacles," he observes, "and give 
individuals ability and inclination to lend, a plan might be 
devised which, by incorporating their means together, and 
uniting them with those of the public, will, on the foundation of that incorporation and union, erect a mass of credit 
that will supply the defect of moneyed capital, and answer 
all the purposes of cash. A plan which will not only advance the interest of the lenders, secure the independence 
of their country, and in its progress have the most beneficial influence upon its future commerce, but be a source of 
national strength and wealth. I mean," he says, " the institution of a national bank. This I regard, in some shape 
or other, as an expedient essential to our safety and suecess, unless by a happy turn of European affairs, the war 
should speedily terminate, in a manner upon which it would 
be unwise to reckon. There is no other that can give to 
government that extensive and systematic credit, which the 
defect of our revenues makes indispensably necessary to 
its operations. The longer it is delayed, the more difficult 
it becomes. Our affairs grow every day more relaxed and 
more involved. Public credit hastens to a more irretrievable 
catastrophe. The means for executing the plan are exhausted in partial and temporary efforts. The loan now making 
in Massachusetts, would have gone a great way in establishing the funds on which the bank must stand. 
</p><p>
I am aware of all the objections that have been made to 
public banks, and that they are not without enlightened and 
respectable opponents. But all that has been said against 
them only tends to prove, that like all other good things, 
they are subject to abuse, and when abused, become pernicious. The precious metals, by similar arguments, may 
be proved to be injurious. If is certain that the monies 
of South America have had great influence in banishing 
industry from Spain, and sinking it in real wealth and importance. Great power, commerce, and riches, or, in other 
words great national prosperity, may, in like manner, be 
denominated evils ; for they lead to insolence, an inordinate ambition, a vicious luxury, licentiousness of morals, 
and all those vices which corrupt a government, enslave the 
state, and precipitate the ruin of a nation. But no wise 
statesman will reject the good, from an apprehension of the 
ill. The truth is, in human affairs, there is no good, pure 
and unmixed. Every advantage has two sides ; and wisdom consists in availing ourselves of the good, and guarding, as much as possible, against the bad. 
</p><p>
"The tendency of a national bank is to increase public and 
private credit. The former gives power to the state, for 
the protection of its rights and interests, and the latter facilitates and extends the operations of commerce among individuals. 
</p><p>
Industry is increased, commodities are multiplied, agriculture and manufactures flourish, and herein consist the 
true wealth and prosperity of a state. 
</p><p>
Most commercial nations have found it necessary to institute banks ; and they have proved to be the happiest engines that ever were invented for advancing trade. Venice, 
Genoa, Hamburgh, Holland, and England, are examples of 
their utility. They owe their riches, commerce, and the 
figure they have made at different periods, in a great degree, to this source. Great Britain is indebted for the immense efforts she has been able to make in so many illustrious and successful wars, essentially to that vast fabric of 
credit, raised on this foundation. Tis by this alone, she 
now menaces our independence. She has indeed abused 
the advantage, and now stands on a precipice. Her example should both persuade and warn us. 'Tis in republics, where banks are most easily established and supported, 
and where they are least liable to abuse. Our situation 
will not expose us to frequent wars, and the public will 
have no temptation to overstrain its credit. 
</p><p>
"In my opinion, we ought not to hesitate, because we have 
no other resource. The long and expensive wars of King 
William had drained England of its specie ; its commerce 
began to droop for want of a proper medium ; its taxes 
were unproductive, and its revenues declined. The administration wisely had recourse to the institution of a bank, 
and it retrieved the national difficulties. We are in the 
same, and still greater want, of a sufficient medium. We 
have little specie ; the paper we have is of small value, and 
rapidly declining to less. We are immersed in a war for 
our existence as a nation, for our liberty and happiness as 
a people. We have no revenues, nor no credit. A bank, 
if practicable, is the only thing that can give us either the one or the other. Besides these great and cardinal motives to such an institution, and the advantages we should 
enjoy from it in common with other nations, our situation, 
relatively to Europe and to the West Indies, would give us 
some peculiar advantages. 
</p><p>
Nothing is more common than for men to pass from the 
abuse of a good thing to the disuse of it. Some persons, 
disgusted by the depreciation of the money, are chimerical 
enough to imagine it would be beneficial to abolish all paper, and annihilate the whole of what is now in circulation, 
and depend altogether upon specie, both for commerce and 
finance. The scheme is altogether visionary, and in the attempt would be fatal. We have not a competent stock 
of specie in this country, either to answer the purpose of 
circulation in trade, or to serve as a basis for revenue. 
The whole amount of what we have, I am persuaded, does 
not exceed six millions of dollars, one-fifth of the circulating 
medium before the war. To suppose this would be sufficient for the operations of commerce, would be to suppose 
that our domestic and foreign commerce were both reduced 
four-fifths ; a supposition that carries absurdity on the face 
of it. It follows, that if our paper money were destroyed, 
a great part of the transactions of traffic must be carried on 
by barter ; a mode inconvenient, partial, confined ; destructive both of commerce and industry. With the addition of 
the paper we now have, this evil exists in too great a degree." 
</p><p>
Having shown that if all the specie could be drawn into 
the treasury annually, the consequence of such a measure, 
which never was effected in any country, would be a complete stagnation of business ; and that a recourse to taxes 
in kind, would prove wholly inefficacious, he proceeds to 
observe, 
</p><p>
The error of those who would explode paper money 
altogether, originates in not making proper distinctions. 
Our paper was, in its nature, liable to depreciation, because it had no funds for its support, and was not upheld by private credit. The emissions under the resolution of March, 
1780, have partly the former advantage, but are destitute 
of the latter, which is equally essential. No paper credit 
can be substantial or durable, which has not funds, and 
which does not unite immediately the interest and influence 
of the moneyed men, in its establishment and preservation. 
A credit begun on this basis will, in process of time, greatly 
exceed its funds ; but this requires time, and a well settled 
Opinion in its favour. 'Tis IN A NATIONAL BANK ALONE THAT WE CAN FIND THE INGREDIENTS TO CONSTITUTE A WHOLESOME, SOLID, AND BENEFICIAL PAPER CREDIT." 
</p><p>
The length to which these extracts have extended does 
not warrant the publication more at large of this elaborate 
document. A mere outline of the plan, consisting of twenty articles, is all that will now be given. 
</p><p>
The capital of the bank was to consist of a stock of three 
millions of dollars, divided into thirty thousand shares, to 
be exempted from all taxes and impositions. 
</p><p>
The subscription, according to the respective amounts, 
to be in proportionate quantities of specie, personal, and 
landed securities; the object being to secure the largest 
possible amount of specie. The bank to have all legal 
corporate immunities, and the stock to be protected from 
attachment, making each member of the incorporation liable, by suit, to the extent of his stock. 
</p><p>
The privilege of subscribing for one half of the capital 
stock, to be reserved to the United States, to the particular states, or to foreigners, and the .United States to become conjointly responsible with the private proprietors, 
for all the transactions of the bank, which was to be authorized to issue notes, with and without interest, a part only 
payable in America, the residue in Europe. The aggregate 
of the notes not to exceed the amount of the bank stock ; 
with a power to lend at an interest not to exceed eight percent., and to borrow to the amount of one half of its stock, 
to purchase estates, by principal or by annuities, to have 
the privilege of coining, to the amount of one half of its 
stock, (the quantity of alloy, &c. to be determined by congress,) and to have, also, the power of discounting foreign 
bills of exchange, to receive deposits of plate or money, 
which deposits were to be exempt from taxation, to have 
the right of contracting with the French government, for 
the supply of its fleets and armies in America, and to contract with congress for the supply of their armies, with 
a condition to lend the United States, on a certain unalienable fund of one hundred and ten thousand four hundred 
pounds per annum, the sum of twelve hundred thousand 
pounds, at an interest of eight per cent., payable in twenty 
years, or sooner, at the option of congress, and a similar 
rate to govern all future loans ; for which fund the United 
States, and the individual states, to be severally pledged. 
</p><p>
The bank to become responsible for the redemption of 
all the paper ; the old, at forty for one, in parts of one third, 
at the end of every ten years, with interest at five per 
cent. ; the new, as specie, in six years, so as to fulfil the 
previous engagements of congress ; for which responsibility, adequate funds, payable to the bank, equal to the discharge of the whole paper currency in thirty years, bearing an interest of two per cent., were to be established. 
</p><p>
The bank notes to be received in payment of all public 
customs and taxes, at an equivalent with gold and silver, 
with power to dissolve itself at pleasure, having made 
effectual provision for the payment of its debts. Its stock 
to be transferable. To be chartered for thirty years, and 
no other bank, public or private, to be permitted during 
that period. Three offices to be established, one in each 
of the states of Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia, 
to facilitate the circulation and payment of the bank notes ; 
the whole to be managed by twelve general directors, eight 
to be chosen by the private proprietors, and four by congress ; the minister of finance having the privilege of inspecting all their proceedings. 
</p><p>
A full examination of the principles of the proposed institution would exceed the proper limits of this work, but 
a few desultory observations on some of the features of this 
plan, may not be misplaced. 
</p><p>
The introduction of landed security, as a part of the capital stock, is the provision which, in a merely commercial 
view, might perhaps have been deemed most objectionable. 
But it is to be remembered, that commercial convenience 
was merely an incidental consideration. The primary object was similar to that of the bank of England ; after absorbing the previous issues, to obtain a monopoly of the circulation, and by that means to secure a safe and uniform 
currency. 
</p><p>
But had the sole purpose of <a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel=''>Colonel Hamilton</a> been the 
granting facilities to trade, it is by no means obvious that 
his plan would have been less effective. 
</p><p>
It is true, that the country would not furnish an adequate 
amount of specie, or of equivalent available personal securities to fill the stock ; and that for this reason, the deficiency was sought to be supplied by landed security. But 
this landed security, though less readily convertible than 
the government debt of England, which forms the basis of 
its bank, might be pledged for an amount of cash of relative value, and there would still exist the use of the lands, 
and the use of the value of its representative. 
</p><p>
That the landed security was not convertible to meet the 
immediate wants of the bank, would be less objectionable, 
in the minds of those who entertain the opinion, not without 
strong reasons, that the capital of a bank should remain a 
permanent vested fund, upon which to base a credit, not a 
fund to be appropriated to its current uses. 
</p><p>
It is possible that this provision might have diminished 
the number of merely moneyed subscribers ; but as this plan 
was to go into operation, at a time when the prevailing distrust of paper securities would dispose individuals, amidst a 
choice of evils, to prefer an institution which would furnish 
this additional support, to a capital of which the specie component was the most alluring ingredient, this disadvantage 
would have been more than compensated. 
</p><p>
The power of coining money, was introduced merely to 
enable the bank to convert its plate into specie ; but it was 
a power which, under proper checks, might have been extended with advantage. 
</p><p>
The privilege of contracting with the French government, for the supply of its armies, was highly desirable 
from this consideration, that the greater part of the specie 
was derived from the expenditures of France, and passing 
through the bank, would have increased its credit and efficiency, while the great profits to be derived from the contracts, would have offered large inducements to subscribers. 
</p><p>
The article which rendered the bank responsible for the 
redemption of the existing paper, had in view the importance of relieving the country from a fluctuating medium, 
which infected all credit. The amount of the annuity to 
be secured by congress to the bank, was not fixed, from 
the difficulty of estimating the whole amount of the government issues; a difficulty which was increased by this 
circumstance, that this plan proposed to embrace all the 
State emissions, as essential to every efficient scheme of 
finance, a fact of high interest, in reference to the great 
question of the " Assumption," which threatened an insuperable obstacle to the fiscal system of the present government. 
</p><p>
The permission to the bank to dissolve or sell at pleasure, was introduced to encourage men to adventure in it, from a confidence, that when once engaged, the profits 
would induce them to continue. 
</p><p>
In reply to the inquiry, where funds are to be procured, 
in the present impotent state of the federal government, 
<a href='/results.php?tla=alh' rel=''>Colonel Hamilton</a> says, " I answer, there are ample means, 
and they must be had. Congress must deal plainly with 
their constituents ; they must tell them that power without 
revenue, is a bubble ; that unless they give them substantial resources of the latter, they will not have enough of 
the former either to prosecute the war, or to maintain the 
union in peace ; that in short, they must, in justice to the 
public, and to their own honour, renounce the vain attempt of carrying on the war without either, a perseverance in which can only deceive the people, and betray 
their safety. They must demand an instant, positive, and 
perpetual investiture of an impost on trade ; a land tax 
and a poll tax to be collected by their own agents. This 
act to become a part of the confederation. It has ever 
been my opinion, that congress ought to have complete sovereignty in all but the mere municipal law of each state, 
and 1 wish to see a CONVENTION OF ALL THE STATES, with 
full power to alter and amend, finally and irrevocably, the 
present futile and senseless confederation." 
' After stating the plan of the bank, " these," he says, " as 
has already been observed, are only intended as outlines. 
The form of administration for the bank, and all other matters, may be easily determined. If the leading principles 
are once approved, we shall find good models in the different European banks, which we can accommodate to our circumstances. Great care, in particular, should be employed 
to guard against counterfeits ; and, I think, methods may 
be devised that will be effectual. 
</p><p>
I see nothing to prevent the practicability of a plan of 
this kind, but a distrust of the final success of the war, which 
may make men afraid to risk any considerable part of their 
fortunes in the public funds ; but without being an enthusiast, I will venture to assert, that with such a resource as 
is here proposed, the loss of our independence is impossible. 
All we have to fear is, that the want of money may disband 
the army, or so perplex and enfeeble our operations, as to 
create in the people a general disgust and alarm, which may 
make them clamour for peace on any terms. But if a judicious administration of our finances, assisted by a bank, 
takes place, and the ancient security of property is restored, 
no convulsion is to be apprehended ; our opposition will 
soon assume an aspect of system and vigour, that will relieve and encourage the people, and put an end to the hopes 
of the enemy. 'Tis evident, they have it not in their power to subdue us by force of arms ; in all these states they 
have not more than fifteen thousand effective troops, nor is 
it possible for them much to augment this number. The 
East and West Indies demand reinforcements. In all the 
islands they have not, at this time, above five thousand men ; 
a force not more than equal to the proper garrisoning of 
Jamaica alone, and which, the moment they lose a maritime 
superiority in those seas, will leave them much cause to fear 
for their possessions. They will probably send out fifteen 
hundred or two thousand men to recruit their regiments 
already here, but this is the utmost they can do. 
</p><p>
"Our allies have five thousand men at Rhode-Island, 
which in the worst event that can happen, will be recruited to eight, to co-operate with us on a defensive plan. 
Should our army amount to no more than fifteen thousand 
men, the combined forces, though not equal to the expulsion 
of the enemy, will be equal to the purpose of compelling 
them to renounce their offensive, and content themselves 
with maintaining one or two capital points. This is on the 
supposition, that the public have the means of putting their 
troops in activity. By stopping the progress of their conquests, and reducing them to an unmeaning and disgraceful defensive, we destroy the national expectation of success, from which the ministry draw their resources. They 
are in a situation, where the want of splendid successes is 
ruin. They have carried taxation nearly to its extreme 
boundary ; they have mortgaged all their funds ; they have 
a large unfunded debt, besides the enormous mass which is 
funded. This must necessarily create apprehensions in 
their most sanguine partizans, and if these are not counteracted by flattering events, from time to time, they cannot 
much longer continue the delusion. Indeed, in that case, I 
suppose they must themselves despair. The game we play, 
is a sure game, if we play it with skill. I have calculated, 
in the preceding observations, on the most disadvantageous 
side ; many events may turn up in the course of the summer, 
to make even the present campaign decisive."

The day before yesterday I arrived here, but for want 
of an opportunity could not write any sooner ; indeed, I 
know of none now. Finding, when I came here, that nothing was said on the subject of a command, I wrote the 
General a letter, and enclosed him my commission. This 
morning Tilghman came to me in his name, pressed me to 
retain my commission, with an assurance that he would endeavour, by all means, to give me a command, nearly such 
as I could have desired in the present circumstances of the 
army. Though I know you would be happy to hear I had 
rejected this proposal, it is a pleasure my reputation would 
not permit me to afford you. I consented to retain my 
commission, and accept the command. I quarter, at present, 
by a very polite and warm invitation, with <a href='/results.php?tla=bel' rel='colleague met'>General Lincoln</a>,

Finding that a story, long since propagated, under circumstances which it

The redoubt on the right was also taken, but with less 
celerity, the Americans having the work in their possession, and being regularly formed, while their allies were 
yet engaged in removing the abatis.

The fate of the enemy was now decided. The second 
parallel was continued during the night, the two redoubts 
enveloped, and a line of communication opened with the 
first before break of day. As a last effort, a sortie was 
made, towards day-light of the sixteenth, which proved unsuccessful.

Cornwallis, who knew the weakness of his defences, 
and had planned his only hopes on succour from New- York, 
resolved to make a uv^peyate attempt to cross to Gloucester, intending to escape by land to New- York. Boats were 
prepared, and a part of the troops embarked;, when a violent storm arose, which drove the boats down the rivei, r^ 
prevented the completion of his bold design. New batteries 
were now finished by the Americans; the whole works 
were mounted, and a heavy and irresistible cannonade encomplimented at the expense of Generals Washington and <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>La Fayette</a>,) hag

counteract its currency and influence by an explicit disavowal.

The story imports in substance, that <a href='/results.php?tla=laf' rel='colleague friend met'>General La Fayette</a>, with the approbation or connivance of <a href='/results.php?tla=gwa' rel='colleague met'>General Washington</a>, ordered me, as the officer who

Positively and unequivocally I declare, that no such nor similar order, nor

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your excellency will, I am persuaded, readily admit the force of this sentiment, that though it is the duty of a good 
citizen to devote his services to the public, when it has occasion for them, he cannot, with propriety or delicacy to 
himself, obtrude them, when it either has, or appears to have, none. 
</p><p>
The difficulties I experienced last campaign in obtaining a command, will not suffer me to make any farther application on that head. 
</p><p>
As I have many reasons to consider my being employed hereafter in a precarious light, the bare possibility of rendering an equivalent, will not justify to my scruples, the receiving any future emoluments from my commission. I therefore renounce, from this time, all claim to the compensations 
attached to my military station during the war, or after it. But I have motives which will not permit me to resolve on 
a total resignation. I sincerely hope a prosperous train of 
affairs may continue to make rt no inconvenience to decline 
the services of persons, whose zeal in worse times was found 
not altogether useless ; but as the most promising appearances are often reversed by unforeseen disasters, and as unfortunate events may again make the same zeal of some 
value, I am unwilling to put it out of my power to renew 
my exertions in the common cause, in the line in which I 
have hitherto acted. 
</p><p>
I shall, accordingly, retain my rank, while I am permitted to do it ; and take this opportunity to declare, that I shall 
be at all times ready to obey the call of the public, in any 
capacity, civil or military, (consistent with what I owe to 
myself,) in which there may be a prospect of my contributing to the final attainment of the object for which I embarked in the service. I have the honour to be, 
Very respectfully,

An half hour since brought me the pleasure of your letter of December last. It went to <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a> and came from 
thence to this place. I heartily felicitate you on the birth 
of your daughter. I can well conceive your happiness upon 
that occasion, by that which I feel on a similar one. 
</p><p>
Indeed, the sensations of a tender father of the child of a 
beloved mother, can only be conceived by those who have 
experienced them. 
</p><p>
Your heart, my Meade, is peculiarly formed for enjoyments of this kind. You have every right to be a happy 
husband, a happy father. You have every prospect of being so. I hope your felicity may never be interrupted. 
</p><p>
You cannot imagine how entirely domestic I am growing. I lose all taste for the pursuits of ambition. I sigh 
for nothing but the company of my wife and my baby. The 
ties of duty alone, or imagined duty, keep me from renouncing public life altogether. It is, however, probable, I may 
not be any longer actively engaged in it. 
</p><p>
I have explained to you the difficulties which I met with 
in obtaining a command last campaign. I thought it incompatible with the delicacy due to myself to make any 
application this campaign. I have expressed this sentiment in a letter to the General, and, retaining my rank only, 
have relinquished the emoluments of my commission, declaring myself, notwithstanding, ready at all times to obey 
the calls of the public. I do not expect to hear any of 
these, unless the state of our affairs should change for the 
worse, and lest, by any unforeseen accident that should 
happen, I choose to keep myself in a situation again to contribute my aid. This prevents a total resignation. 
</p><p>
You were right in supposing I neglected to prepare what 
I promised you. at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The truth is, I was in 
such a hurry to get home, that I could think of nothing else. 
As I set out to-morrow morning for <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I cannot, 
from this place, send you the matter you wish. 
</p><p>
Imagine, my dear Meade, what pleasure it must give 
Eliza and myself to know that Mrs. Meade interests herself 
in us. Without a personal acquaintance, we have been 
long attached to her. My visit at Mr. Fitzhugh's confirmed 
my partiality. Betsey is so fond of your family, that she 
proposes to form a match between her boy and your girl, 
provided you will engage to make the latter as amiable as 
her mother. 
</p><p>
Truly, my dear Meade, I often regret that fortune has 
cast our residence at such a distance from each other. It 
would be a serious addition to my happiness if we lived 
where I could see you every day ; but fate has determined 
it otherwise. I am a little hurried, and can only request, 
in addition, that you will present me most affectionately to 
Mrs. Meade, and believe me to be, with the warmest and 
most unalterable friendship,

SIR, 
</p><p>
The explanation which you give of your intention, in your late offer, makes it an object that will compensate fully for the time that it will deduct from my other 
occupations. In accepting it, I have only one scruple, 
arising from a doubt whether the service I can render in 
the present state of things, will be an equivalent for the 
compensation. The whole system, (if it may be so called,) 
of taxation in this state, is radically vicious, burthensome 
to the people, and unproductive to government. As the 
matter now stands, there seems to be little for a continental receiver to do. The whole business appears to be 
thrown into the hands of the county treasurers ; nor do I 
find that there is any appropriation made of any part of the 
taxes collected for continental purposes, or any provision 
to authorize payment to the officer you appoint. This, 
however, must be made. There is only one way in which 
I can imagine a prospect of being materially useful ; that 
is, in seconding your applications to the state. In popular assemblies much may sometimes be brought about by 
personal discussions, by entering into details, and combating objections as they rise. If it should, at any time, be 
thought advisable by you to empower me to act in this capacity, I shall be happy to do every thing that depends 
upon me to effectuate your views. I flatter myself, to you, 
sir, I need not profess that I suggest this, not from a desire 
to augment the importance of office, but to advance the 
public interest. 
</p><p>
It is of primary moment to me, as soon as possible to 
take my station in the law, and on this consideration I am 
pressing to qualify myself for admission the next term, 
which will be the latter end of July. After this, should you 
think an interview necessary, I will wait upon you in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. In the mean time, I shall be happy to receive your 
instructions, and shall direct my attention more particularly 
to acquiring whatever information may be useful to my future operations. I have read your publications at different 
times, but as I have not the papers containing them in my 
possession, it will be necessary that their contents should 
be comprised in your instructions. A meeting of the legislature is summoned early in the next month, at which, if I 
previously receive your orders, it may be possible to put 
matters in train. I am truly indebted to you, sir, for the 
disposition you have manifested upon this occasion, and I 
shall only add an assurance of my endeavours to justify your 
confidence.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Agreeable to my letter to you from <a href='/results.php?city=albany' rel='city'>Albany</a>, I came to 
this place, and had an interview with a committee of the 
legislature, in which I urged the several matters contained 
in your instructions. I strongly represented the necessity 
of solid arrangements of finance, and by way of argument, 
pointed out all the defects of the present system. I found 
every man convinced that something was wrong, but few 
that were willing to recognise the mischief when defined, 
and consent to the proper remedy. The quantum of taxes 
already imposed is so great, as to make it useless to impose 
any others to a considerable amount ; a bill has, however, 
passed both houses, payable in specie, bank notes, or your 
notes, for eighteen thousand pounds. 
</p><p>
"It is at present appropriated to your order, but I doubt 
whether some subsequent arrangement will not take place 
for a different appropriation. The commander-in-chief has 
applied for a quantity of forage, which the legislature is devising the means of furnishing, and I fear it will finish by 
diverting the eighteen thousand pounds to that purpose. I 
have, hitherto, been able to prevent this ; but as it is of 
indispensable importance to me to leave this place immediately, to prepare for an examination, for which I have 
pledged myself the ensuing term, which is at hand, it is possible, after I have left it, contrary ideas will prevail. 
Efforts have been made to introduce a species of negotiable 
certificates, which I have strenuously opposed. It has not 
yet taken place, but I am not clear how the matter will 
terminate. Should the bill for the eighteen thousand 
pounds go out, in its present form, I cannot hope that it 
will produce in the treasury above half the sum, such are 
the vices of our present mode of collection. A bill has 
also passed the assembly, for collecting arrearages of taxes, 
payable in specie, bank notes, your notes, old continental 
emissions at one hundred and twenty-eight for one, and a 
species of certificates issued by the state, for the purchase 
of horses. This is now before the senate ; the arrearages 
are very large. 
</p><p>
Both houses have unanimously passed a set of resolutions, to be transmitted to congress and the several states, 
proposing a convention of the states, to enlarge the powers 
of congress, and vest them with funds. I think this a very 
eligible step, though I doubt of the concurrence of the other 
states ; but I am certain without it, they never will be 
brought to co-operate in any reasonable or effectual plan. 
Urge reforms or exertions, and the answer constantly is, 
what avails it for one state to make them, without the consent of the others ? It is in vain to expose the futility of this 
reasoning. It is founded on all those passions which have 
the strongest influence on the human mind. 
</p><p>
The legislature have also appointed, at my instance, a 
committee to devise, in its recess, a more effectual system 
of taxation, and to communicate with me on this subject. 
A good deal will depend on the success of this attempt. 
Convinced of the absurdity of multiplying taxes in the present mode, when in effect the payment is voluntary, and 
the money received exhausted in the collection, I have laboured chiefly to instil the necessity of a change in the 
plan, and though not so rapidly as the exigency of public 
affairs requires, truth seems to be making some progress. 
</p><p>
There is no other appropriation to the use of congress 
than of the eighteen thousand pounds. 
</p><p>
"I shall, as soon as possible, give you a full and just view 
of the situation and temper of this state. This cannot be 
till after my intended examination ; that over, I shall lay 
myself out in every way that can promote your views, and 
the public good. I am informed, you have an appointment 
to make of a commissioner of accounts for this state. Permit me to suggest the expediency of choosing a citizen of 
the state, a man who, to the qualifications requisite for the 
execution of the office, adds an influence in its affairs. I 
need not particularize the reasons for this suggestion. In 
my next I will also take the liberty to mention some characters. I omitted mentioning, that the two houses have 
also passed a bill, authorizing congress to adjust the quotas 
of the states, on equitable principles, agreeable to your recommendation."

</p><p>
I thank you, my dear Meade, for your letter of the first 
of this month, which you will perceive has travelled much 
faster than has been usual with our letters. Our correspondence hitherto has been unfortunate, nor in fact can 
either of us compliment himself on his punctuality ; but you 
were right in concluding, that however indolence or accident may interrupt our intercourse, nothing will interrupt 
our friendship. Mine for you is built on the solid basis of 
a full conviction that you deserve it, and that it is reciprocal, and it is the more firmly fixed, because you have few 
competitors. Experience is a continued comment on the 
worthlessness of the human race, and the few exceptions 
we find, have the greater right to be valued in proportion as 
they are rare. I know few men estimable, fewer amiable, and when I meet with one of the last description, it is 
not in my power to withhold my affection. 
</p><p>
You reproach me with not having said enough about our 
little stranger. When I wrote last, I was not sufficiently 
acquainted with him to give you his character. I may now 
assure you, that your daughter, when she sees him, will not 
consult you about the choice, or will only do it in respect 
to the rules of decorum. He is truly a very fine young gentleman, the most agreeable in his conversation and manners 
of any I ever knew, nor less remarkable for his intelligence 
and sweetness of temper. You are not to imagine, by my 
beginning with his mental qualifications, that he is defective in personal. It is agreed, on all hands, that he is handsome ; his features are good, his eye is not only sprightly 
and expressive, but it is full of benignity. His attitude, in 
sitting is, by connoisseurs, esteemed graceful, and he has a 
method of waving his hand that announces the future orator. He stands, however, rather awkwardly, and as his 
legs have not all the delicate slimness of his father's, it is 
feared he may never excel as much in dancing, which is 
probably the only accomplishment in which he will not be 
a model. If he has any fault in manners, he laughs too 
much. He has now passed his seventh month. 
</p><p>
I am glad to find your prospect of being settled approaches. I am sure you will realize all the happiness you 
promise yourself with your amiable partner. I wish fortune 
had not cast our lots at such a distance. Mrs. Meade, you, 
Betsey, and myself, would make a most affectionate and 
most happy partie quarre. 
</p><p>
As to myself, I shall sit down in New-York, when it 
opens, and the period we are told approaches. No man 
looks forward to a peace with more pleasure than I do, 
though no man would sacrifice less to it than myself, if I 
were not convinced the people sigh for peace. I have been 
studying the law for some months, and have lately been 
licensed as an attorney. I wish to prepare myself by October for examination as a counsellor, but some public avocations may possibly prevent me. 
I had. almost forgotten to tell you, that I have been pretty 
unanimously elected by the legislature of this state, a member of congress, to begin to serve in November. I do not 
hope to reform the state, although I shall endeavour to do 
all the good I can. 
</p><p>
Suffer Betsey and me to present our love to Mrs. Meade. 
She has a sisterly affection for you. My respects, if you 
please, to Mr. and Mrs. Fitzhugh. God bless you.
