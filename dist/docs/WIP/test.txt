Providence, 12 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I beg leave to congratulate your Excellency upon 
your being appointed General of the Armies of the 
United Colonies, which hath given sincere pleasure 
to every friend of America, and will, I hope, prove 
glorious to yourself, and be attended with essential 
advantages to your country. 
</p><p>
The General Assembly of this Colony have the 
deepest sense of the necessity of a strict union, and 
the most vigorous efforts, of the Colonies to preserve 
them from unlimited servitude ; and their utmost Exertions in the common cause may be depended upon. 
</p><p>
I also assure your Excellency, that I shall give 
you every possible assistance in my power; and that 
I am with very great regard, Sir, your Excellency's 
Most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
NICHOLAS COOKE.

Lebanon, 13 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Suffer me to join in congratulating you, on your 
appointment to be General and Commander-in-Chief of 
the troops raised, or to be raised, for the defence of 
American liberty. Men, who have tasted freedom, 
and who have felt their personal rights, are not 
easily taught to bear with encroachments on either, 
or brought to submit to oppression. Virtue ought 
always to be made the object of government. Justice is firm and permanent. 
</p><p>
His Majesty's ministers have artfully induced the 
Parliament to join in their measures, to prosecute 
the dangerous and increasing difference between Great 
Britain and these Colonies with rigor and military 
force y whereby the latter are driven to an absolute 
necessity to defend their rights and properties by 
raising forces for their security. 
</p><p>
The Honorable Congress have proclaimed a Fast to be 
observed by the inhabitants of all the English Colonies 
on this continent, to stand before the Lord in one day, 
with public humiliation, fasting, and prayer, to deplore 
our many sins, to offer up our joint supplications to 
God, for forgiveness, and for his merciful interposition 
for us in this day of unnatural darkness and distress. 
</p><p>
They have, with one united voice, appointed you to 
the high station you possess. The Supreme Director 
of all events hath caused a wonderful union of hearts 
and counsels to subsist among us. 
</p><p>
Now, therefore, be strong and very courageous. May the God of the armies of Israel shower down 
the blessings of his Divine Providence on you, give you wisdom and fortitude, cover your head in the 
day of battle and danger, add success, convince our 
enemies of their mistaken measures, and that all their 
attempts to deprive these Colonies of their inestimable 
constitutional rights and liberties are injurious and 
vain. I am, with great esteem and regard, Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
JONATHAN TRUMBULL.

FROM MAJOR-GENERAL PHILIP SCHUYLER. 
</p><p>
Saratoga, 15 July, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1775">1775</a>. 
</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since I did myself the honor to write to your Excellency from New York, nothing very material occurred 
until yesterday, when I received the inclosed letters. 
The accounts contained in that marked Number One are 
truly alarming, in the present defenceless state of the 
counties of Tryon and Albany, and especially as the 
assistance I can afford them either of men or money is 
next to nothing ; the few troops at Ticonderoga, &c., 
being at too great a distance, and not more than sufficient to guard the posts they occupy. I should have 
been at Ticonderoga this day, had not the information from Tryon county arrived, which may make my 
presence there absolutely necessary, if it should be 
confirmed. I therefore propose remaining here until 
to-morrow, when I hope to be further informed. 
</p><p>
I wish I may be able to proceed to Ticonderoga, 
as I am very much wanted there, the greatest confusion having taken place in the controversy between 
the officers claiming the command in that quarter. 
Some have taken the liberty to disband troops, others 
refused to serve unless this or that particular person 
commanded. The sloop is left without either captain 
or pilot, both of which are dismissed or come away; 
much provision wasted or embezzled,, and on the 7th 
instant only one barrel of flour at Ticonderoga. I 
shall have an Augean stable to clean there. 
</p><p>
I do myself the honor to inclose a return of the 
forces in this colony. It is doubtless imperfect, as 
I have been under a necessity of forming it out of 
the returns which were evidently so. I hope soon to 
send you a more complete one. 
</p><p>
Be assured, my General, that I shall use my best 
endeavours to establish order and discipline in the 
troops under my command. I wish I could add, that I 
had a prospect of much success in that way. It is extremely difficult to introduce a proper subordination 
amongst a people where so little distinction is kept up. 
</p><p>
Our accounts of the disposition of the Canadians and 
Canada Indians continue to be favorable, though the 
intelligence is nothing very authentic. I am your 
Excellency's 
</p><p>
Obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
