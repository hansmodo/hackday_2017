INTRODUCTION. 



THE fortune of Henry Thoreau as an author 
of books has been peculiar, and such as to indi- 
cate more permanence of his name and fame 
than could be predicted of many of his contem- 
poraries. In the years of his literary activity 
(twenty-five in all), from 1837 to 1862, when 
he died, not quite forty-five years old, he pub- 
lished but two volumes, and those with much 
delay and difficulty in finding a publisher. But 
in the thirty-two years since his death, nine vol- 
umes have been published from his manuscripts 
and fugitive pieces, the present being the 
tenth. Besides these, two biographies of Tho- 
reau have appeared in America, and two others 
in England, with numerous reviews and sketches 
of the man and his writings, enough to make 
several volumes more. At present, the sale of 
his books and the interest in his life are greater 
than erer; and he seems to have grown early 



vi INTRODUCTION. 

into an American classic, like his Concord neigh- 
bors, Emerson and Hawthorne. Pilgrimages 
are made to his grave and his daily haunts, as 
to theirs, and those who come find it to be 
true, as was said by an accomplished woman 
(Miss Elizabeth Hoar) soon after his death, 
that "Concord is Henry's monument, adorned 
with suitable inscriptions by his own hand." 
When Horace wrote of a noble Roman fam- 

iiy, 

Crescit occulto velut arbor aevo 
Fama Marcelli, 

he pointed in felicitous phrase to the only fame 
that posterity has much regarded, the slow- 
growing, deep-rooted laurel of renown. And 
Shakespeare, citing the old English rhyming 
saw, 

Small herbs have grace, 
Great weeds do grow apace, 

signified the same thing in a parable, the pop- 
ularity and suddenness of transient things, con- 
trasted with the usefully permanent. There 
were plenty of authors in Thoreau's time (of 
whom Willis may be taken as the type) who 
would have smiled loftily to think that a rustic 



INTRODUCTION. vii 

from the Shawsheen and Assabet could compete 
with the traveled scholar or elegant versifier 
who commanded the homage of drawing-rooms 
and magazines, for the prize of lasting remem- 
brance; yet who now are forgotten, or live a 
shadowy life in the alcoves of libraries, piping 
forth an ineffective voice, like the shades in 
Virgil's Tartarus. But Thoreau was wiser when 
he wrote at the end of his poem, " Inspiration," 

Fame cannot tempt the bard 
Who 'a famous with hia God ; 
Nor laurel him reward 
Who has his Maker's nod. 

He strove but little for glory, either immediate 
or posthumous, well knowing that it is the inevi- 
table and unpursued result of what men do or 
say, 

Our fatal shadow that walks by us still. 

The Letters of Thoreau, though not less re- 
markable in some aspects than what he wrote 
carefully for publication, have thus far scarcely 
had justice done them. The selection made for 
a small volume in 1865 was designedly done to 
exhibit one phase of his character, the most 
striking, if you will, but not the most native 



vih INTRODUCTION. 

or attractive. " In his own home," says Ellery 
Channing, who knew him more inwardly than 
any other, " he was one of those characters who 
may be called ' household treasures ; ' always on 
the spot, with skillful eye and hand, to raise the 
best melons in the garden, plant the orchard 
with choicest trees, or act as extempore me- 
chanic ; fond of the pets, his sister's flowers, or 
sacred Tabby ; kittens were his favorites, he 
would play with them by the half-hour. No 
whim or coldness, no absorption of his time by 
public or private business, deprived those to 
whom he belonged of his kindness and affec- 
tion. He did the duties that lay nearest, and 
satisfied those in his immediate circle ; and 
whatever the impressions from the theoretical 
part of his writings, when the matter is probed 
to the bottom, good sense and good feeling will 
be detected in it." This is preeminently true ; 
and the affectionate conviction of this made his 
sister Sophia dissatisfied with Emerson's rule of 
selection among the letters. This she confided 
to me, and this determined me, should occasion 
offer, to give the world some day a fuller and 
more familiar view of our friend. 



INTRODUCTION. ix 

For this purpose I have chosen many letters 
and mere notes, illustrating his domestic and 
gossipy moods, for that element was in his 
mixed nature, inherited from the lively maternal 
side, and even the colloquial vulgarity (using 
the word in its strict sense of " popular speech ") 
that he sometimes allowed himself. In his last 
years he revolted a little at this turn of his 
thoughts, and, as Channing relates, " rubbed out 
the more humorous parts of his essays, origi- 
nally a relief to their sterner features, saying, ' I 
cannot bear the levity I find ; ' " to which Chan- 
ning replied that he ought to spare it, even to 
the puns, in which he abounded almost as much 
as Shakespeare. His friend was right, the 
obvious incongruity was as natural to Thoreau 
as the grace and French elegance of his best 
sentences. Thus I have not rejected the com- 
mon and trivial in these letters ; being well as- 
sured that what the increasing number of Tho- 
reau's readers desire is to see this piquant original 
just as he was, not arrayed in the paradoxical 
cloak of the Stoic sage, nor sitting complacent 
in the cynic earthenware cave of Diogenes, and 
bidding Alexander stand out of his sunshine. 



x INTRODUCTION. 

He did those acts also ; but they were not the 
whole man. He was far more poet than cynic 
or stoic; he had the proud humility of those 
sects, but still more largely that unconscious 
pride which comes to the poet when he sees that 
his pursuits are those of the few and not of the 
multitude. This perception came early to Tho- 
reau, and was expressed in some unpublished 
verses dating from his long, solitary rambles, by 
night and day, on the seashore at Staten Island, 
where he first learned the sombre magnificence 
of Ocean. He feigns himself the son of what 
might well be one of Homer's fishermen, or the 
shipwrecked seaman of Lucretius, 

Saevis projectus ab undis 
Cui tantum in vita restet transire malonrm, 

and then goes on thus with his parable : 

Within a humble cot that looks to sea 
Daily I breathe this curious warm life, 

Beneath a friendly haven's sheltering lea 
My noiseless day with mystery still is rife. 

'T is here, they say, my simple life began, 

And easy credence to the tale I lend, 
, For well I know 't is here I am a man, 
But who will simply tell me of the end ? 



INTRODUCTION. n 

These eye*, fresh-opened, spied the far-off Sea, 

That like a silent godfather did stand, 
Nor uttered one explaining word to me, 

While introducing straight godmother Land. 

And yonder still stretches that silent Main, 
With many glancing ships besprinkled o'er : 

And earnest still I gaze and gaze again 

Upon the selfsame waves and friendly shore. 

Infinite work my hands find there to do, 

Gathering the relicts which the waves upcast : 

Each storm doth scour the sea for something new, 
And every time the strangest is the last. 

My neighbors sometimes come with lumbering carts, 
As if they wished my pleasant toil to share ; 

But straight they go again to distant marts, 
For only weeds and ballast are their care. 

44 Only weeds and ballast?" that is exactly 
what Thoreau's neighbors would have said he 
was gathering, for the most of his days ; yet now 
he is seen to have collected something more du- 
rable and precious than they with their imple- 
ments and market-carts. If they viewed him 
with a kind of scorn and pity, it must be said 
that he returned the affront ; only time seems 
to have sided with the poet in the controversy 
that he maintained against his busy age. 



xii INTRODUCTION. 

Superiority, moral elevation, without peev- 
ishness or condescension, this was Thoreau's 
distinguishing quality. He softened it with hu- 
mor, and sometimes sharpened it with indigna- 
tion ; but he directed his satire and his censure 
as often against himself as against mankind ; 
men he truly loved, if they would not obstruct 
his humble and strictly-chosen path. The let- 
ters here printed show this, if I mistake not, 
and the many other epistles of his, still uncol- 
lected, would hardly vary the picture he has 
sketched of himself, though they would add new 
facts. Those most to be sought for are his re- 
plies to the generous letters of his one English 
correspondent. 

The profile-portrait engraved for this volume 
is less known than it should be, for it alone 
of the four likenesses extant shows the aquiline 
features as his comrades of the wood and moun- 
tain saw them, not weakened by any effort to 
bring him to the standard of other men in garb 
or expression. The artist, Mr. Walton Ricket- 
son, knew and admired him.

FAMILIAR LETTERS OF THOREAU. 



I. YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. 

IT was a happy thought of Thoreau's friend 
Ellery Channing, himself a poet, to style our 
Concord hermit the " poet-naturalist ; " for there 
seemed to be no year of his life, and no hour of 
his day when Nature did not whisper some secret 
in his ear, so intimate was he with her from 
childhood. In another connection, speaking of 
natural beauty, Channing said, " There is Tho- 
reau, he knows about it; give him sunshine 
and a handful of nuts, and he has enough." He 
was also a naturalist in the more customary 
sense, one who studied and arranged methodi- 
cally in his mind the facts of outward nature ; a 
good botanist and ornithologist, a wise student 
of insects and fishes ; an observer of the winds, 
the clouds, the seasons, and all that goes to make 
up what we call " weather " and " climate." Yet 
he was in heart a poet, and held all the accumu- 
lated knowledge of more than forty years not so 
much for use as for delight. As Gray's poor 
friend West said of himself, " Lake a clear-flow-

ing stream, he reflected the beauteous prospect 
around ; " and Mother Nature had given Thoreau 
for "his prospect the meandering Indian River of 
Concord, the woodland pastures and fair lakes 
by which he dwelt or rambled most of his life. 
Born in the East Quarter of Concord, July 12, 
1817, he died in the village, May 6, 1862 ; he 
was there fitted for Harvard College, which he 
entered in 1833, graduating in 1837 ; and for 
the rest of his life was hardly away from the 
town for more than a year in all. Consequently 
his letters to his family are few, for he was 
usually among them ; but when separated from 
his elder brother John, or his sisters Helen and 
Sophia, he wrote to them, and these are the 
earliest of his letters which have been pre- 
served. Always thoughtful for others, he has 
left a few facts to aid his biographer, respecting 
his birth and early years. In his Journal of 
December 27, 1855, he wrote : 

"Recalled this evening, with the aid of 
Mother, the various houses (and towns) in 
which I have lived, and some events of my life. 
Born in the Minott house on the Virginia Road, 
where Father occupied Grandmother's * thirds ', 
carrying on the farm. The Catherines had the 
other half of the house, Bob Catherine, and 
[brother] John threw up the turkeys. Lived 
there about eight months ; Si Merriam the next

neighbor. Uncle David [Dunbar] died when I 
was six weeks old. 1 I was baptized in the old 
Meeting-house, by Dr. Ripley, when I was three 
months, and did not cry. In the Red House, 
where Grandmother lived, we had the west side 
till October, 1818, hiring of Josiah Davis, 
agent for the Woodwards; there were uncle 
Charles and cousin Charles (Dunbar), more or 
less. According to the Day-Book first used by 
Grandfather (Thoreau), 2 dated 1797 (his part 
cut out and then used by Father in Concord in 
1808-9, and in Chelmsford in 1818-21), Father 
hired of Proctor (in Chelmsford), and shop of 
Spaulding. In Chelmsford till March, 1821 ; 
last charge there about the middle of March, 
1821. Aunt Sarah taught me to walk there, 
when fourteen months old. We lived next the 
meeting-house, where they kept the powder in 
the garret. Father kept shop and painted 
signs, etc. . . . 

1 He was named David for this uncle ; Dr. Ripley was the 
minister of the whole town in 1817. The Red House stood 
near the Emerson house on the Lexington road ; the Wood- 
wards were a wealthy family, afterwards in Quincy, to which 
town Dr. Woodward left a large bequest. 

* John Thoreau, grandfather of Henry, born at St. Helier's, 
Jersey, April, 1754, was a Bailor on board the American priva- 
teer General Lincoln, November, 1770, and recognized La 
Terrible, French frigate, which carried John Adams from 
Boston to France. See Thoreau 's Summer, p. 102. This John 
Thoreau, son of Philip, died in Concord, 1800. 



4 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1821-1844. 

"In Pope's house, South End of Boston (a 
ten-footer) five or six months, moved from 
Chelinsford through Concord, and may have 
tarried in Concord a little while. 

" Day-book says, ' Moved to Pinkney Street 
(Boston), September 10, 1821, on Monday;' 
Whitwell's house, Pinkney Street, to March, 
1823 ; then brick house, Concord, to spring of 
1826 ; Davis house (next to Samuel Hoar's) to 
May 7, 1827 ; Shattuck house (now W. Mun- 
roe's) to spring of 1835 ; Hollis Hall, Cam- 
bridge, 1833 ; Aunts' house to spring of 1837. 
[This was what is now the inn called ' Thoreau 
House.'] At Brownson's (Canton) while teach- 
ing in winter of 1835. Went to New York with 
Father peddling in 1836." 

This brings the date down to the year in which 
Henry Thoreau left college, and when the family 
letters begin. The notes continue, and now 
begin to have a literary value. 

"Parkman house to fall of 1844; was gradu- 
ated in 1837 ; kept town school a fortnight that 
year ; began the big red Journal, October, 1837 ; 
found my first arrow-head, fall of 1837 ; wrote a 
lecture (my first) on Society, March 14, 1838, 
and read it before the Lyceum, in the Masons' 
Hall, April 11, 1838 ; went to Maine for a school 
in May, 1838 ; commenced school in the Park-

man house l in the summer of that year ; wrote an 
essay on ' Sound and Silence ' December, 1838 ; 
fall of 1839 up the Merrimack to the White 
Mountains; 'Aulus Persius Flaccus ' (first 
printed paper of consequence), February 10, 
1840 ; the Red Journal of 596 pages ended 
June, 1840 ; Journal of 396 pages ended Janu- 
ary 31, 1841. 

"Went to R. W. Emerson's in spring of 
1841 (about April 25), and stayed there till 
summer of 1843 ; went to William Emerson's, 
Staten Island, May, 1843, and returned in De- 
cember, or to Thanksgiving, 1843 ; made pen- 
cils in 1844 ; Texas house to August 29, 1850 ; 
at Walden, July, 1845, to fall of 1847 ; then at 
R. W. Emerson's to fall of 1848, or while he 
was in Europe ; then in the Yellow house (re- 
formed) till the present." 

1 This had been the abode of old Deacon Park n KIM. a grand- 
ancle of the late Francis Parkman, the historian, and son of 
the Westborotigh clergyman from whom this distinguished 
family descends. Deacon Parkman was a merchant in Con- 
cord, and lived in what was then a good house. It stood in 
the middle of the village, where the Public Library now is. 
The "Texas" house was built by Henry Thoreau and his 
father John ; it was named from a section of the village then 
called " Texas," because a little remote from the churches and 
schools; perhaps the name odd fancy that had bestowed the 
name of " Virginia " on the road of Thoreau's birthplace. 
The " Yellow house re-formed " was a small cottage rebuilt 
and enlarged by the Thoivaus in ls.~>O; in this, on the main 
street, Henry and lib father and mother died. 



6 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1700-1787. 

As may be inferred from this simple record of 
the many mansions, chiefly small ones, in which 
he had spent his first thirty-eight years, there 
was nothing distinguished in the fortunes of 
Thoreau's family, who were small merchants, 
artisans, or farmers, mostly. On the father's 
side they were from the isle of Jersey, where a 
French strain mingled with his English or Scan- 
dinavian blood ; on the other side he was of 
Scotch and English descent, counting Jones, 
Dunbar, and Burns among his feminine ances- 
tors. Liveliness and humor came to him from 
his Scotch connection ; from father and grand- 
father he inherited a grave steadiness of mind 
rather at variance with his mother's vivacity. 
Manual dexterity was also inherited ; so that he 
practiced the simpler mechanic arts with ease 
and skill; his mathematical training and his 
outdoor habits fitted him for a land-surveyor; 
and by that art, as well as by pencil-making, lec- 
turing, and writing, he paid his way in the world, 
and left a small income from his writings to those 
who survived him. He taught pupils also, as 
did his brother and sisters ; but it was not an 
occupation that he long followed after John's 
death in 1842. With these introductory state- 
ments we may proceed to Thoreau's first corre- 
spondence with his brother and sisters. 

As an introduction to the correspondence, and 



r. 20.] COMMENCEMENT CONFERENCE. 7 

a key to the young man's view of life, a passage 
may bo taken from Thoreau's " Part " at his col- 
lege commencement, August 16, 1837. He was 
one of two to hold what was called a " Confer- 
ence " on " The Commercial Spirit," his alter- 
ant ive or opponent in the dispute being Henry 
Vose, also of Concord, who, in later years, was 
a Massachusetts judge. Henry Thoreau, 1 then 
just twenty, said : 

"The characteristic of our epoch is perfect 
freedom, freedom of thought and action. The 
indignant Greek, the oppressed Pole, the jealous 
American assert it. The skeptic no less than 
the believer, the heretic no less than the faithful 
child of the Church, have begun to enjoy it. It 
has generated an unusual degree of energy and 
activity ; it lias generated the commercial spirit. 
Man thinks faster and freer than ever before. 
He, moreover, moves faster and freer. He is 
more restless, because he is more independent 
than ever. The winds and the waves are not 
enough for him ; he must needs ransack the 
bowels of the earth, that he may make for 
himself a highway of iron over its surface. 

Indeed, could one examine this beehive of 



the greater part of his college course he signed 
bimaelf I>. II. Thoreau, aa he was christened (David Henry); 
but being constantly called " Henry," he put this name fint 
about the tim-- In- left college, and was seldom afterwards 
known by the former initials.

ours from an observatory among the stars, he 
would perceive an unwonted degree of bustle in 
these later ages. There would be hammering 
and chipping in one quarter ; baking and brew- 
ing, buying and selling, money-changing and 
speechmaking in another. What impression 
would he receive from so general and impartial 
a survey. Would it appear to him that mankind 
used this world as not abusing it ? Doubtless 
he would first be struck with the profuse beauty 
of our orb ; he would never tire of admiring its 
varied zones and seasons, with their changes of 
living. He could not but notice that restless 
animal for whose sake it was contrived ; but 
where he found one man to admire with him his 
fair dwelling-place, the ninety and nine would be 
scraping together a little of the gilded dust upon 
its surface. . . . We are to look chiefly for the 
origin of the commercial spirit, and the power 
that still cherishes and sustains it, in a blind and 
unmanly love of wealth. Wherever this exists, 
it is too sure to become the ruling spirit ; and, 
as a natural consequence, it infuses into all our 
thoughts and affections a degree of its own selfish- 
ness ; we become selfish in our patriotism, selfish 
in our domestic relations, selfish in our religion. 
" Let men, true to their natures, cultivate the 
moral affections, lead manly and independent 
lives ; let them make riches the means and not

the end of existence, and we shall hear no more 
of the commercial spirit. The sea will not stag- 
nate, the earth will be as green as ever, and the air 
as pure. This curious world which we inhabit 
is more wonderful than it is convenient ; more 
beautiful than it is useful; it is more to be 
admired and enjoyed than used. The order of 
things should be somewhat reversed ; the seventh 
should be man's day of toil, wherein to earn his 
living by the sweat of his brow ; and the other 
six his Sabbath of the affections and the soul, 
in which to range this widespread garden, and 
drink in the soft influences and sublime revela- 
tions of Nature. . . . The spirit we are consider- 
ing is not altogether and without exception bad. 
We rejoice in it as one more indication of the 
entire and universal freedom that characterizes 
the age in which we live, as an indication that 
the human race is making one more advance in 
that infinite series of progressions which awaits 
it. We glory in those very excesses which are 
a source of anxiety to the wise and good ; as an 
evidence that man will not always be the slave 
of matter, but erelong, casting off those earth- 
born desires which identify him with the brute, 
shall pass the days of his sojourn in this his 
nether Paradise, as becomes the Lord of Crea- 
tion." i

10 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1837, 

This passage is noteworthy as showing how 
early the philosophic mind was developed in 
Thoreau, and how much his thought and expres- 
sion were influenced by Emerson's first book, 

mate (" chum ") of Thoreau, by this utterance, will be seen 
by this fragment of a letter from James Richardson of Ded- 
hani (afterwards Reverend J. Richardson), dated Dedham, 
September 7, 18o7 : 

" FRIEND THOREAU, After you had finished your part in 
the Performances of Commencement (the tone and sentiment of 
which, by the way, I liked much, as being 1 of a sound philoso- 
phy), I hardly saw you again at all. Neither at Mr. Quincy's 
levee, neither at any of our classmates' evening entertainments, 
did I find you ; though for the purpose of taking a farewell, 
and .leaving you some memento of an old chum, as well as on 
matters of business, I much wished to see your face once more. 
Of course you must be present at our October meeting, 
notice of the time and place for which will be given in the 
newspapers. I hear that you are comfortably located, in your 
native town, as the guardian of its children, in the immediate 
vicinity, I suppose, of one of our most distinguished apostles 
of the future, R. W. Emerson, and situated under the minis- 
try of our old friend Reverend Barzillai Frost, to whom please 
make my remembrances. I heard from you, also, that Con- 
cord Academy, lately under the care of Mr. Phineas Allen of 
Northfield, is now vacant of a preceptor ; should Mr. Hoar 
find it difficult to get a scholar college-distinguished, perhaps 
he would take up with one, who, though in many respects a 
critical thinker, and a careful philosopher of language among 
other things, has never distinguished himself in his class as a 
regular attendant on college studies and rules. If so, could 
you do me the kindness to mention my name to him as of one 
intending to make teaching his profession, at least for a part 
of his life. If recommendations are necessary, President 
Quincy has offered me one, and I can easily get others. 1 '

" Nature." But the soil in which that germina- 
ting seed fell was naturally prepared to receive 
it; and the wide diversity between the master 
and the disciple soon began to appear. In 1863, 
reviewing Thoreau's work, Emerson said, " That 
oaken strength which I noted whenever he 
walked or worked, or surveyed wood-lots, the 
same unhesitating hand with which a field- 
laborer accosts a piece of work which I should 
shun as a waste of strength, Henry shows in his 
literary task. He has muscle, and ventures on 
and performs feats which I am forced to decline. 
In reading him I find the same thoughts, the 
same spirit that is in me ; but he takes a step 
beyond, and illustrates by excellent images that 
which I should have conveyed in a sleepy gener- 
alization." True as this is, it omits one point of 
difference only too well known to Emerson, 
the controversial turn of Thoreau's mind, in 
which he was so unlike Emerson and Alcott, 
and which must have given to his youthful utter- 
ances in company the air of something requiring 
an apology. 

Tin's, at all events, seems to have been the 
feeling of Helen Thoreau, 1 whose pride in her

brother was such that she did not wish to see 
him misunderstood. A pleasing indication of 
both these traits is seen in the first extant letter 
of Thoreau to this sister. I have this in an 
autograph copy made by Mr. Emerson, when he 
was preparing the letters for partial publication, 
soon after Henry's death. For some reason he 
did not insert it in his volume ; but it quite de- 
serves to be printed, as indicating the period 
when it was clear to Thoreau that he must think 
for himself, whatever those around him might 
think. 

TO HELEN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON). 

CONCORD, October 27, 1837. 

DEAR HELEN, Please you, let the defendant 
say a few words in defense of his long silence. 
You know we have hardly done our own deeds, 
thought our own thoughts, or lived our own lives 
hitherto. For a man to act himself, he must be 
perfectly free ; otherwise he is in danger of los- 
ing all sense of responsibility or of self-respect. 
Now when such a state of things exists, that the 
sacred opinions one advances in argument are 
apologized for by his friends, before his face, 
lest his hearers receive a wrong impression of 
the man, when such gross injustice is of fre- 
quent occurrence, where shall we look, and not 
look in vain, for men, deeds, thoughts ? As 



jer.20.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 13 

well apologize for the grape that it is sour, or 
the thunder that it is noisy, or the lightning that 
it tarries not. 

Further, letter-writing too- often degenerates 
into a communicating of facts, and not of truths ; 
of other men's deeds and not our thoughts. What 
are the convulsions of a planet, compared with 
the emotions of the soul? or the rising of a 
thousand suns, if that is not enlightened by a 
ray? 

Your affectionate brother, 

HENRY. 

It is presumed the tender sister did not need 
a second lesson ; and equally that Henry did not 
see fit always to write such letters as he praised 
above, for he was quite ready to give his cor- 
respondents facts, no less than thoughts, espe- 
cially in his family letters. 

Next to this epistle, chronologically, comes 
one in the conventional dialect of the American 
Imlian, as handed down by travelers and ro- 
mancers, by Jefferson, Chateaubriand, Lewis, 
Clarke, and Fenimore Cooper. John Thoreau, 
Hrnry's brother, was born in 1815 and died 
January 11, 1842. He was teaching at Taun- 
ton in 1837.

TO JOHN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON). 
(Written as from one Indian to another.) 

MUSKETAQULD, 202 Summers, two Moons, eleven Suns, 

since the coming of the Pale Faces. 

(November 11, 1837.) 

TAHATAWAN, Sachimaussan, to his brother 
sachem, Hopeful of Hope well,. hoping that he 
is well : 

Brother : It is many suns that I have not seen 
the print of thy moccasins by our council-fire ; 
the Great Spirit has blown more leaves from 
the trees, and many clouds from the land of 
snows have visited our lodge ; the earth has be- 
come hard, like a frozen buffalo-skin, so that the 
trampling of many herds is like the Great Spir- 
it's thunder ; the grass on the great fields is like 
the old man of many winters, and the small 
song-sparrow prepares for his flight to the land 
whence the summer comes. 

Brother : I write these things because I know 
that thou lovest the Great Spirit's creatures, 
and wast wont to sit at thy lodge-door, when the 
maize was green, to hear the bluebird's song. 
So shalt thou, in the land of spirits, not only 
find good hunting grounds and sharp arrow- 
heads, but much music of birds. 

Brother : I have been thinking how the Pale 
Faces have taken away our lands, and was a 



*r.20.] TO JOHN THOREAU. 15 

woman. You are fortunate to have pitched your 
wigwam nearer to the great salt lake, where the 
Pale Face can never plant corn. 

Brother : I need not tell thee how we hunted 
on the lands of the Dundees, a great war- 
chief never forgets the bitter taunts of his ene- 
mies. Our young men called for strong water ; 
they painted their faces and dug up the hatchet. 
But their enemies, the Dundees, were women ; 
they hastened to cover their hatchets with wam- 
pum. Our braves are not many ; our enemies 
took a few strings from the heap their fathers 
left them, and our hatchets are buried. But not 
Tahatawan's ; his heart is of rock when the 
Dundees sing, his hatchet cuts deep into the 
Dundee braves. 

Brother : There is dust on my moccasins ; I 
have journeyed to the White Lake, in the coun- 
try of the Ninares. 1 The Long-knife has been 

1 White Pond, in the district called " Nine-Acre Corner," is 
here meant; the "Lee-vitea" were a family then living on 
Lee's Hill. Nanshawtuck is another name for this hill, where 
the old Tahatawan lived at times, before the English settled 
in Concord in September, 1635. The real date of this letter 
is November 1 1-14, 1HJ57, and between its two dates the Mnm- 
chusetta state election was held. The " great council-house " 
was the Boston State House, to which the Concord people were 
electing deputies ; the " Eagle- Beak " named below was doubt- 
lem Smii-l Hoar, the first citizen of the town, and for a time 
Member of Congress from Middlesex County. He was the 
father of Hockwood and Frisbie Hoar, afterwards judge and 
senator respectively. 



16 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1837, 

there, like a woman I paddled his war-canoe. 
But the spirits of my fathers were angered ; the 
waters were ruffled, and the Bad Spirit troubled 
the air. 

The hearts of the Lee-vites are gladdened; 
the young Peacock has returned to his lodge at 
Naushawtuck. He is the Medicine of his tribe, 
but his heart is like the dry leaves when the 
whirlwind breathes. He has come to help 
choose new chiefs for the tribe, in the great 
Council-house, when two suns are past. There 
is no seat for Tahatawan in the council-house. 
He lets the squaws talk, his voice is heard 
above the warwhoop of his tribe, piercing the 
hearts of his foes ; his legs are stiff, he cannot 
sit. 

Brother : Art thou waiting for the spring, that 
the geese may fly low over thy wigwam ? Thy 
arrows are sharp, thy bow is strong. Has Ana- 
wan killed all the eagles ? The crows fear not 
the winter. Tahatawan's eyes are sharp he 
can track a snake in the grass, he knows a 
f mend from a foe ; he welcomes a friend to his 
lodge though the ravens croak. 

Brother : Hast thou studied much in the medi- 
cine-books of the Pale-Faces? Dost thou un- 
derstand the long talk of the Medicine whose 
words are like the music of the mocking-bird ? 
But our chiefs have not ears to hear him ; they 



r.20.] TO JOHN THOREAU. 17 

listen like squaws to the council of old men, 
they understand not his words. But, Brother, 
he never danced the war-dance, nor heard the 
warwhoop of his enemies. He was a squaw ; he 
stayed by the wigwam when the braves were out, 
and tended the tame buffaloes. 

Fear not ; . the Dundees have faint hearts and 
much wampum. When the grass is green on 
the great fields, and the small titmouse returns 
again, we will hunt the buffalo together. 

Our old men say they will send the young 
chief of the Karlisles, who lives in the green 
wigwam and is a great Medicine, that his word 
may be heard in the long talk which the wise 
men are going to hold at Shawinut, by the salt 
lake. He is a great talk, and will not forget 
the enemies of his tribe. 

14th Sun. The fire has gone out in the coun- 
cil-house. The words of our old men have been 
like the vaunts of the Dundees. The Eagle- 
Beak was moved to talk like a silly Pale-Face, 
and not as becomes a great war-chief in a coun- 
cil of braves. The young Peacock is a woman 
among braves ; he heard not the words of the 
oli I men, like a squaw he looked at his medi- 
cine-paper. 1 The young chief of the green wig-

warn has hung up his moccasins ; he will not 
leave his tribe till after the buffalo have come 
down on to the plains. 

Brother : This is a long talk, but there is 
much meaning to my words ; they are not like 
the thunder of canes when the lightning smites 
them. Brother, I have just heard thy talk and 
am well pleased ; thou art getting to be a great 
Medicine. The Great Spirit confound the ene- 
mies of thy tribe.

This singular letter was addressed to John 
Thoreau at Taunton, and was so carefully pre- 
served in the family that it must have had value 
in their eyes, as recalling traits of the two Tho- 
reau brothers, and also events in the village 
life of Concord, more interesting to the young 
people of 1837 than to the present generation. 
Some of its parables are easy to read, others 
quite obscure. The annual state election was 
an important event to Henry Thoreau then, 
more so than it afterwards appeared; and he 

mocking-bird" is hard to explain ; it may mean Edward Ever- 
ett, then governor of Massachusetts, or, possibly, Emerson, 
whose lectures began to attract notice in Boston and Cam- 
bridge. It can hardly mean Wendell Phillips, though his 
melodious eloquence had lately been heard in attacks upon 
slavery. 



JET. 20.] HENRY AND JOHN THOREAU. 19 

was certainly on the Whig side in politics, like 
most of the educated youths of Concord. His 
" young chief of the Kaiiisles " was Albert Nel- 
son, son of a Carlisle physician, who began to 
practice law in Concord in 1836, and was after- 
wards chief justice of the Superior Court. He 
was defeated at the election of 1837, as candi- 
date of the Whigs for representative in the 
state legislature, by a Democrat. Henry Vose, 
above named, writing from " Butternuts," in 
New York, three hundred miles west of Concord, 
October 22, 1837, said to Thoreau : " You envy 
my happy situation, and mourn over your fate, 
which condemns you to loiter about Concord 
and grub among clamshells [for Indian relics]. 
If this were your only source of enjoyment while 
in Concord, but I know that it is not. I well 
remember that * antique and fish-like ' office of 
Major Nelson (to whom, and to Mr. Dennis, 
and Bemis, and John Thoreau, I wish to be re- 
membered) ; and still more vividly do I remem- 
ber the fairer portion of the community in C." 
This indicates a social habit in Henry and John 
Thoreau, which the Indian " talk " also implies. 
Tahatawan, whom Henry here impersonated, 
was the mythical Sachem of Musketaquid (the 
Algonquin name for Concord River and region), 
whose fishing and hunting lodge was on the hill 
Naushawtuck, between the two rivers so much

navigated by the Thoreaus. In 1837 the two 
brothers were sportsmen, and went shooting over 
the Concord meadows and moors, but of course 
the " buffalo " was a figure of speech ; they never 
shot anything larger than a raccoon. A few 
years later they gave up killing the game. 

TO JOHN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON). 

CONCORD, February 10, 1838. 

DEAR JOHN, Dost expect to elicit a spark 
from so dull a steel as myself, by that flinty 
subject of thine? Truly, one of your copper 
percussion caps would have fitted this nail-head 
better. 

Unfortunately, the "Americana" 1 has hardly 
two words on the subject. The process is very 
simple. The stone is struck with a mallet so as 
to produce pieces sharp at one end, and blunt at 
the other. These are laid upon a steel line 
(probably a chisel's edge), and again struck 
with the mallet, and flints of the required size 

1 Americana, in this note, is the old Encyclopedia Americana, 
which had been edited from the German Conversations-Lexicon, 
and other sources, by Dr. Francis Lieber, T. G. Bradford, and 
other Boston scholars, tn years earlier, and was the only con- 
venient book of reference at Thoreau's hand. The inquiry of 
John Thoreau is another evidence of the interest he took, like 
his brother, in the Indians and their flint arrow-heads. The 
relics mentioned in the next letter were doubtless Indian wea- 
pons and utensils, very common about Taimton in the region 
formerly controlled by King Philip. 



*r.20.] TO JOHN THOREAU, 21 

are broken off. A skillful workman may make 
a thousand in a day. 

So much for the "Americana." Dr. Jacob 
Bigelow in his " Technology " says, " Gunflints 
are formed by a skillful workman, who breaks 
them out with a hammer, a roller, and steel 
chisel, with small, repeated strokes." 

Your ornithological commission shall be exe- 
cuted. When are you coming home ? 
Your affectionate brother, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

TO JOHN THOREAU (AT TAUNTON). 

CONCORD, March 17, 1838. 

DEAR JOHN, Your box of relics came safe 
to hand, but was speedily deposited on the car- 
pet, I assure you. What could it be? Some 
declared it must be Taunton herrings : " Just 
nose it, sir I " So down we went onto our knees, 
and commenced smelling in good earnest, 
now horizontally from this corner to that, now 
perpendicularly from the carpet up, now diago- 
nally, and finally with a sweeping movement 
describing the circumference. But it availed 
not. Taunton herring would not be smelled. 
So we e'en proceeded to open it vi et chisel. 
What an array of nails! Four nails make a 
quarter, four quarters a yard, i' faith, this 
is n't cloth measure I Blaze away, old boy ! 



22 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1838, 

Clap in another wedge, then ! There, softly ! 
she begins to gape. Just give that old stick- 
ler, with a black hat on, another hoist. Aye, 
we '11 pare his nails for him ! Well done, old 
fellow, there 's a breathing-hole for you. " Drive 
it in ! " cries one ; " Nip it off ! " cries another. 
Be easy, I say. What 's done may be undone. 
Your richest veins don't lie nearest the surface. 
Suppose we sit down and enjoy the prospect, 
for who knows but we may be disappointed? 
When they opened Pandora's box, all the con- 
tents escaped except Hope, but in this case hope 
is uppermost, and will be the first to escape 
when the box is opened. However, the general 
voice was for kicking the coverlid off. 

The relics have been arranged numerically 
on a table. When shall we set up housekeep- 
ing ? Miss Ward thanks you for her share of 
the spoils ; also accept many thanks from your 
humble servant " for yourself." 

I have a proposal to make. Suppose by the 
time you are released we should start in com- 
pany for the West, and there either establish a 
school jointly, or procure ourselves separate sit- 
uations. Suppose, moreover, you shoidd get 
ready to start previous to leaving Taunton, to 
save time. Go / must, at all events. Dr. Jar- 
vis enumerates nearly a dozen schools which 1 
could have, all such as would suit you equally 



*r.20.] TO JOHN THOREAU. 23 

well. 1 I wish you would write soon about this. 
It is high season to start. The canals are now 
open, and traveling comparatively cheap. I 
think I can borrow the cash in this town. 
There 's nothing like trying. 

Brighani wrote you a few words on the 8th, 
which father took the liberty to read, with the 
advice and consent of the family. He wishes 
you to send him those (numbers) of the " Li- 
brary of Health" received since 1838, if you 
are in Concord ; otherwise, he says you need 
not trouble yourself about it at present. He is 
in C., and enjoying better health than usual. 
But one number, and that you have, has been 
received. 

The bluebirds made their appearance the 14th 
day of March; robins and pigeons have also 
been seen. Mr. Emerson has put up the blue- 
bird box in due form. All send their love. 
From your aff. br.

to inquire at Mr. Marston's for an old singing- 
book I left there, the " Handel and Haydn 
Collection," without a cover? Have you ever 
got those red handkerchiefs ? Much love to 
the Marstons, Crockers, and Muenschers. Mr. 
Josiah Davis has failed. Mr. and Mrs. Howe 
have both written again, urging my going to 
Roxbury ; which I suppose I shall do. What 
day of the month shall you return ? 

HELEN. 

One remark in this letter calls for attention, 
that concerning the " bluebird box " for Mr. 
Emerson. In 1853 Emerson wrote in his jour- 
nal : " Long ago I wrote of Gifts, and neglected 
a capital example. John Thoreau, Jr., one day 
put a bluebird's box on my barn, fifteen years 
ago it must be, and there it still is, with 
every summer a melodious family in it, adorning 
the place and singing his praises. There 's a 
gift for you, which cost the giver no money, 
but nothing which he bought could have been 
so good. I think of another, quite inestimable. 
John Thoreau knew how much I should value a 
head of little Waldo, then five years old. He 
came to me and offered to take him to a daguer- 
reotypist who was then in town, and he (Tho- 
reau) would see it well done. He did it, and 
brought me the daguerre, which I thankfully 



*r.20.] TO JOHN THOREAU. 25 

paid for. A few months after, my boy died ; 
and I have since to thank John Thoreau for 
that wise and gentle piece of friendship." 

Little Waldo Emerson died January 27, 1842, 
and John Thoreau the same month ; so that this 
taking of the portrait must have been but a few 
months before his own death, January 11. Henry 
Thoreau was then living in the Emerson family. 

TO JOHX TUOBEAU (AT WEST ROXBtJRY). 

CONCORD, July 8, 1838. 

DEAR JOHN, We heard from Helen to-day, 
and she informs us that you are coming home 
by the first of August. Now I wish you to 
write and let me know exactly when your vaca- 
tion takes place, that I may take one at the 
same time. I am in school from 8 to 12 in the 
morning, and from 2 to 4 in the afternoon. 
After that I read a little Greek or English, or, 
for variety, take a stroll in the fields. We 
have not liad such a year for berries this long 
time, the earth is actually blue with them. 
High blueberries, three kinds of low, thimble- 
and raspberries constitute my diet at present. 
(Take notice, I only diet between meals.) 
Among my deeds of charity, I may reckon the 
picking of a cherry-tree for two helpless single 
ladies, who live under the hill ; but i ' faith, it 
was robbing Peter to pay Paul, for while I 



26 YEARS VF DISCIPLINE. [1838, 

was exalted in charity towards them, I had no 
mercy on my own stomach. Be advised, my 
love for currants continues. 

The only addition that I have made to my 
stock of ornithological information is in the 
shape not of a Fring. Melod., but surely a 
melodious Fringilla, the F. Juncorum, or 
rush-sparrow. I had long known him by note, 
but never by name. 

Report says that Elijah Stearns is going to 
take the town school. I have four scholars, and 
one more engaged. Mr. Fenner left town yes- 
terday. Among occurrences of ill omen may be 
mentioned the falling out and cracking of the 
inscription stone of Concord Monument. 1 Mrs. 
Lowell and children are at Aunts'. Peabody 
(a college classmate) walked up last Wednes- 
day, spent the night, and took a stroll in the 
woods. 

Sophia says I must leave off and pen a few 
lines for her to Helen : so good-by. Love from 
all, and among them your aff. brother, 

H. D. T. 

The school above mentioned as begun by 
Henry Thoreau in this summer of 1838 was 

1 This was the old monument of the Fight in 1 775, for the 
dedication of which Emerson wrote his hymn, " By the rude 
bridge." This was sung by Thoreau, among others, to the 
tune of Old Hundred. 



*r.21.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 27 

joined in by John, after finishing his teaching 
at West Roxbury, and was continued for several 
years. It was in this school that Louisa Alcott 
and her sister received some instruction, after 
their father removed from Boston to Concord, 
in the spring of 1840. It was opened in the 
Parkrnan house, where the family then lived, 
and soon after was transferred to the building 
of the Concord Academy, 1 not far off. John 
Thoreau taught the English branches and math- 
ematics ; Henry taught Latin and Greek and 
the higher mathematics, and it was the cus- 
tom of both brothers to go walking with their 
pupils one afternoon each week. It is as a pro- 
fessional schoolmaster that Henry thus writes to 
his sister Helen, then teaching at Roxbury, after 
a like experience in Taunton. 

TO HELEN THOREAU (AT ROXBUBY). 

CONCORD, October 6, 1&38. 

DEAR HELEN, I dropped Sophia's letter 
into the box immediately on taking yours out, 
else the tone of the former had been clianged. 

I have no acquaintance with " Cleaveland's 
First Lessons," though I have peeped into his 
abridged grammar. which I should think very 
well calculated for lic^iniH'rs, at least for such 



1 For twenty-five years (IWWV-Ol)tho hou.sc <.f Kll,. r y ('ban- 
ning, and now of Charles Emerson, nephew of Waldo Emerson. 



28 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1838, 

as would be likely to wear out one book before 
they would be prepared for the abstruser parts 
of grammar. Ahem ! 

As no one can tell what was the Roman pro- 
nunciation, each nation makes the Latin con- 
form, for the most part, to the rules of its own 
language ; so that with us of the vowels only A 
has a peculiar sound. In the end of a word of 
more than one syllable it is sounded like " ah," 
as pennah, Lydiah, Hannah, etc., without re- 
gard to case ; but " da " is never sounded " dah" 
because it is a monosyllable. All terminations 
in es, and plural cases in os, as you know, are 
pronounced long, as homines (hominese), do- 
minos (dominose), or, in English, Johnny Vose. 
For information, see Adams' " Latin Gram- 
mar," before the Rudiments. 

This is all law and gospel in the eyes of the 
world ; but remember I am speaking, as it were, 
in the third person, and should sing quite a dif- 
ferent tune if it were I that made the quire. 
However, one must occasionally hang his harp 
on the willows, and play on the Jew's harp, in 
such a strange country as this. 

One of your young ladies wishes to study 
mental philosophy, hey? Well, tell her that 
she has the very best text-book that I know of 
in her possession already. If she do not be- 
lieve it, then she should have bespoken another 



*r.21.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 29 

better in another world, and not have expected 
to find one at " Little & Wilkins." But if she 
wishes to know how poor an apology for a men- 
tal philosophy men have tacked together, syn- 
thetically or analytically, in these latter days, 
how they have squeezed the infinite mind into 
a compass that would not nonplus a surveyor of 
Eastern Lands making Imagination and Mem- 
ory to lie still in their respective apartments 
like ink-stand and wafers in a lady's escritoire, 
why let her read Locke, or Stewart, or Brown. 
The fact is, mental philosophy is very like Pov- 
erty, which, you know, begins at home ; and in- 
deed, when it goes abroad, it is poverty itself. 

Chorus. I should think an abridgment of 
one of the above authors, or of Abercrombie, 
would answer her purpose. It may set her 
a-thinking. Probably there are many systems 
in the market of which I am ignorant. 

As for themes, say first " Miscellaneous 
Thoughts." Set one up to a window, to note 
what passes in the street, and make her com- 
ments thereon ; or let her gaze in the fire, or 
into a corner where there is a spider's web, and 
philosophize, moralize, theorize, or what not. 
What their hands find to putter about, or their 
minds to think about, that let them write about. 
To say nothing of advantage or disadvantage of 
this, that, or the other, let them set down their

ideas at any given season, preserving the chain 
of thought as complete as may be. 

This is the style pedagogical. I am much 
obliged to you for your piece of information. 
Knowing your dislike to a sentimental letter, I

VERNACULAR VERSION. 

CONCORD, January 23, 1840. 

DEAR SISTER, There is a huge snowdrift at 
the door, and the cold inside is intolerable. The 
very sky is coming down, I guess, and covering 
up the ground. I turn out late in the morning, 
and go to bed early ; there is thick frost on the 
windows, shutting out the view ; and here I write 
in pain, for fingers and brains are numb. I 
would chant with Horace, if my voice did not 
stick in my throat, 

See how Naahawtnck, deep in snow, 

Stand* glittering, while the bending wood* 



34 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1840, 

Scarce bear their burden, and the floods 
Feel arctic winter stay their flow. 

Pile on the firewood, melt the cold, 
Spare nothing, etc. 

But soon, changing my tune, and with a cheer- 
fuller note, I '11 say, 

No longer the flock huddles up in the stall, the plowman bends 

over the fire, 

No longer frost whitens the meadow ; 
But the goddess of love, while the moon shines above, 
Sets us dancing in light and in shadow. 

When Robin Redbreast brings back the 
springtime, I trust that you will lay your school- 
duties aside, cast off care, and venture to be gay 
now and then ; roaming with me in the woods, 
or climbing the Fairhaven cliffs, or else, in 
my boat on Walden, let the water kiss your 
hand, or gaze at your image in the wave. 

Bulwer is to me a name unknown, one of 
the unnoticed crowd, attracting neither blame 
nor praise. To be sure, I hold any one in some 
esteem who is helpless in the grasp of the writ- 
ing demon. 

Does not the image of the Lexington afire 
trouble your dreams? 1 But we may not, like 
the superstitious mob, blame Vulcan or Neptune, 
neither fire nor water was in fault. Nature

takes as much care for midgets as for mankind ; 
she is our friend in storm and in calm. 

If you like history, and the exploits of the 
brave, don't give up Rollin, I beg ; thus would 
you displease Clio, who might not forgive you 
hereafter. What Latin are you reading? I 
mean reading, not studying. Blessed is the man 
who can have his library at hand, and oft peruse 
the books, without the fear of a taskmaster ! he 
is far enough from harmful idleness, who can 
call in and dismiss these friends when he pleases. 
An honest book 's the noblest work of Man. 
There 's a reason, now, not only for your read- 
ing, but for writing something, too. You will 
not lack readers, here am I, for one. If you 
cannot compose a volume, then try a tract. It 
will do the world no good, hereafter, if you 
merely exist, and pass life smoothly or roughly ; 
but to have thoughts, and write them down, that 
helps greatly. 

I fear you will tire of this epistle ; the light 
of day is dwindling, too, 

And longer fall the shadows of the hills. 

Therefore, good-by; fare ye well, and sleep 
in quiet, both my sisters ! Don't forget to write. 

H. D. THOREAU.

POSTSCBIPT. (BY MBS. THOREAU.) 

DEAR SOPHIA, Sam Black (the cat) is liable 
to frequent attacks that impair his agility and 
good-nature ; at such times he goes down cellar, 
and stays many hours. Your flowers O, the 
cruel frost ! are all but dead ; the cactus is with- 
ered by cold, but the geraniums yet flourish. 
The Sewing Circle has been revived this winter ; 
they meet at our house in April or May, so that 
you may then be here. Your Aunt Sophia re- 
mains with us, when she will return to the 
city I don't know. We still suffer from heavy 
colds, but not so much. Young Miss E. White 
is staying in the village a little while (is making 
a little visit in town). Don't forget to write 
within two weeks. We expect a letter next 
Sunday. 

That you may enjoy good health is the prayer 
of Your mother, 

C. THOREAU. 

(H. D. T. was the scribe). 

Cats were always an important branch of the 
Thoreaus' domestic economy, and Henry was 
more tolerant of them than men are wont to be. 
Flowers were the specialty of Sophia, who, when 
I knew her, from 1855 to 1876, usually had a 
small conservatory in a recess of the dining- 



Jtr.22.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 37 

room. At this time (1840) she seems to have 
been aiding Helen in her school. The next let- 
ter, to Helen, is of a graver tone : 

TO HELEN THOKEAU (AT ROXBURY). 

CONCORD, June 13, 1840. 

DEAR HELEN, That letter to John, for 
which you had an opportunity doubtless to sub- 
stitute a more perfect communication, fell, as 
was natural, into the hands of his " transcen- 
dental brother," who is his proxy in such cases, 
having been commissioned to acknowledge and 
receipt all bills that may be presented. But 
what 's in a name ? Perhaps it does not matter 
whether it be John or Henry. Nor will those 
same six months have to be altered, I fear, to 
suit his case as well. But methinks they have 
not passed entirely without intercourse, provided 
we have been sincere though humble worship- 
ers of the same virtue in the mean time. Cer- 
tainly it is better that we should make ourselves 
quite sure of such a communion as this by the 
only course which is completely free from suspi- 
cion, the coincidence of two earnest and as- 
piring lives, than run the risk of a disappoint- 
ment by relying wholly or chiefly on so meagre 
ami uncertain a means as speech, whether writ- 
ten or spoken, affords. How often, when we 
have been nearest each other bodily, have .we 



38 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1840, 

really been farthest off ! Our tongues were the 
witty foils with which we fenced each other off. 
Not that we have not met heartily and with 
profit as members of one family, but it was a 
small one surely, and not that other human fam- 
ily. We have met frankly and without conceal- 
ment ever, as befits those who have an instinc- 
tive trust in one another, and the scenery of 
whose outward lives has been the same, but 
never as prompted by an earnest and affection- 
ate desire to probe deeper our mutual natures. 
Such intercourse, at least, if it has ever been, 
has not condescended to the vulgarities of oral 
communication, for the ears are provided with 
no lid as the eye is, and would not have been 
deaf to it in sleep. And now glad am I, if I 
am not mistaken in imagining that some such 
transcendental inquisitiveness has traveled post 
thither, for, as I observed before, where the 
bolt hits, thither was it aimed, any arbitrary 
direction notwithstanding. 

Thus much, at least, our kindred tempera- 
ment of mind and body and long family-arity 
have done for us, that we already find our- 
selves standing on a solid and natural footing 
with respect to one another, and shall not have 
to waste time in the so often unavailing endeavor 
to arrive fairly at this simple ground. 

Let us leave trifles, then, to accident ; and

politics, and finance, and such gossip, to the mo- 
ments when diet and exercise are cared for, and 
speak to each other deliberately as out of one 
infinity into another, you there in time and 
space, and I here. For beside this relation, all 
books and doctrines are no better than gossip or 
the turning of a spit. 

Equally to you and Sophia, from 

Your affectionate brother, 

H. D. THOREAU. 

We come now to the period when Thoreau 
entered on more intimate relations with Emer- 
son. There was a difference of fourteen years 
in their ages, which had hitherto separated them 
intellectually ; but now the young scholar, thinker, 
and naturalist had so fast advanced that he 
could meet his senior on more equal terms, and 
each became essential to the other. With all his 
prudence and common sense, in which he sur- 
passed most men, Emerson was yet lacking in 
some practical faculties ; while Thoreau was the 
most practical and handy person in all matters 
of every-day life, a good mechanic and gar- 
dener, methodical in his habits, observant and 
kindly in the domestic world, and attractive to 
children, who now were important members of 
the Emerson household. lie was therefore in- 
vited by Emerson to make his house a home,

looking after the garden, the business affairs, 
and performing the office of a younger brother, 
or a grown-up son. The invitation was accepted 
in April, 1841, and Thoreau remained in the 
family, with frequent absences, until he went in 
May, 1843, to reside with Mr. William Emer- 
son, near New York, as the tutor of his sons. 
During these two years much occurred of deep 
moment to the two friends. Young Waldo Em- 
erson, the beautiful boy, died, and just before, 
John Thoreau, the sunny and hopeful brother, 
whom Henry seems to have loved more than any 
human being. These tragedies brought the be- 
reaved nearer together, and gave to Mrs. Emer- 
son in particular an affection for Thoreau, and 
a trust in him which made the intimate life of 
the household move harmoniously, notwithstand- 
ing the independent and eccentric genius of 
Thoreau.

1 Mrs. Brown was the elder sister of Mrs. R. W. Emerson 
and of the eminent chemist and geologist, Dr. Charles T. Jack- 
son, of Plymouth and Boston. She lived for a time in Mrs. 
Thoreau's family, and Thoreau's early verses, Sic Vita, were 
thrown into her window there by the young poet, wrapped 
round a cluster of violets.

earthenware shall I put into my packet to travel 
over so many hills, and thrid so many woods, 
as lie between Concord and Plymouth ? Thank 
fortune it is all the way down hill, so they will 
get safely carried ; and yet it seems as if it were 
writing against time and the sun to send a letter 
east, for no natural force forwards it. You 
should go dwell in the West, and then I would 
deluge you with letters, as boys throw feathers 
into the air to see the wind take them. I should 
rather fancy you at evening dwelling far away 
behind the serene curtain of the West, the 
home of fair weather, than over by the chilly 
sources of the east wind. 

What quiet thoughts have you nowadays 
which will float on that east wind to west, for 
so we may make our worst servants our car- 
riers, what progress made from can't to can, 
in practice and theory? Under this category, 
you remember, we used to place all our philoso- 
phy. Do you have any still, startling, well mo- 
ments, in which you think grandly, and speak 
with emphasis? Don't take this for sarcasm, 
for not in a year of the gods, I fear, will such 
a golden approach to plain speaking revolve 
again. But away with such fears ; by a few 
miles of travel we have not distanced each oth- 
er's sincerity. 

I grow savager and savager every day, as if

fed on raw meat, and my tameness is only the 
repose of untamableness. I dream of looking 
abroad summer and winter, with free gaze, from 
some mountain-side, while my eyes revolve in 
an Egyptian slime of health, I to be nature 
looking into nature with such easy sympathy as 
the blue-eyed grass in the meadow looks in the 
face of the sky. From some such recess I 
would put forth sublime thoughts daily, as the 
plant puts forth leaves. Now-a-nights I go on 
to the hill to see the sun set, as one would go 
home at evening ; the bustle of the village 'has 
run on all day, and left me quite in the rear ; 
but I see the sunset, and find that it can wait 
for my slow virtue. 

But I forget that you think more of this 
human nature than of this nature I praise. 
Why won't you believe that mine is more human 
than any single man or woman can be ? that in 
it, in the sunset there, are all the qualities that 
can adorn a household, and that sometimes, in 
a fluttering leaf, one may hear all your Chris- 
tianity preached. 

You see how unskillful a letter-writer I am, 
thus to- have come to the end of my sheet when 
hardly arrived at the beginning of my story. I 
was going to be soberer, I assure you, but now 
have only room to add, that if the fates allot

some of its serenity to your friend, 

HENRY D. THOREAU.

and send me of your leisure. 

TO MBS. LUCY BROWN (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, Wednesday evening, 
September 8, [1841.] 

DEAR FRIEND, Your note came wafted to 
my hand like the first leaf of the Fall on the Sep- 
tember wind, and I put only another interpreta- 
tion upon its lines than upon the veins of those 
which are soon to be strewed around me. It is 
nothing but Indian Summer here at present. I 
mean that any weather seems reserved expressly 
for our late purposes whenever we happen to be 
fulfilling them. I do not know what right I 
have to so much happiness, but rather hold it 
in reserve till the time of my desert. 

What with the crickets and the crowing of 
cocks, and the lowing of kine, our Concord life 
is sonorous enough. Sometimes I hear the cock 
bestir himself on his ]>erch under my feet, and 
crow shrilly before dawn ; and I think I might 
have been born any year for all the phenomena 
I know. We count sixteen eggs daily now, 
when arithmetic will only fetch the hens up to 



44 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1841, 

thirteen ; but the world is young, and we wait 
to see this eccentricity complete its period. 

My verses on Friendship are already printed 
in the " Dial ; " not expanded, but reduced to 
completeness by leaving out the long lines, 
which always have, or should have, a longer or 
at least another sense than short ones. 

Just now I am in the mid-sea of verses, and 
they actually rustle around me as the leaves 
would round the head of Autumnus himself 
should he thrust it up through some vales which 
I know ; but, alas ! many of them are but 
crisped and yellow leaves like his, I fear, and 
will deserve no better fate than to make mould 
for new harvests. I see the stanzas rise around 
me, verse upon verse, far and near, like the 
mountains from Agiocochook, not all having a 
terrestrial existence as yet, even as some of them 
may be clouds ; but I fancy I see the glea'm of 
some Sebago Lake and Silver Cascade, at whose 
well I may drink one day. I am as unfit for 
any practical purpose I mean for the further- 
ance of the world's ends as gossamer for ship- 
timber ; and I, who am going to be a pencil- 
maker to-morrow, 1 can sympathize with God 
Apollo, who served King Admetus for a while 
on earth. But I believe he found it for his ad-

bread-winner, and Henry Thoreau worked at it and kindred 
arts by intervals for the next twenty years. 



-BT.24.] TO MRS. LUCY BROWN. 45 

vantage at last, as I am sure I shall, though 
I shall hold the nobler part at least out of the 
service. 

Don't attach any undue seriousness to this 
threnody, for I love my fate to the very core 
and rind, and could swallow it without paring 
it, I think. You ask if I have written any more 
poems ? Excepting those which Vulcan is now 
forging, I have only discharged a few more bolts 
into the horizon, in all, three hundred verses, 
and sent them, as I may say, over the moun- 
tains to Miss Fuller, who may have occasion to 
remember the old rhyme : 

" Three scipen gode 
Comen mid than flode 
Three hundred cnihten." 

But these are far more Vandalic than they. In 
this narrow sheet there is not room even for one 
thought to root itself. But you must consider 
this an odd leaf of a volume, and that volume

form while in Concord." It came quite unex- 
pectedly to me, but I was very glad to receive 
it, though I hardly know whether my utmost 
sincerity and interest can inspire a sufficient 
answer to it. I should like to have you send it 
back by some convenient opportunity. 

Pray let me know what you are thinking 
about any day, what most nearly concerns 
you. Last winter, you know, you did more than 
your share of the talking, and I did not com- 
plain for want of an opportunity. Imagine 
your stove-door out of order, at least, and then 
while I am fixing it you will think of enough 
things to say. 

What makes the value of your life at pres- 
ent ? what dreams have you, and what realiza- 
tions? You know there is a high table-land 
which not even the east wind reaches. Now 
can't we walk and chat upon its plane still, as if 
there were no lower latitudes ? Surely our two 
destinies are topics interesting and grand enough 
for any occasion. 

I hope you have many gleams of serenity and 
health, or, if your body will grant you no posi- 
tive respite, that you may, at any rate, enjoy 
your sickness occasionally, as much as I used to 
tell of. But here is the bundle going to be 
done up, so accept a " good-night " from 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 



jff.24.] TO MRS. LUCY BROWN. 47 

TO MBS. LUCY BROWX (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, March 2, 1842. 

DEAR FRIEND, I believe I have nothing 
new to tell you, for what was news you have 
learned from other sources. I am much the 
same person that I was, who should be so much 
better ; yet when I realize what has transpired, 
and the greatness of the part I am unconsciously 
acting, I am thrilled, and it seems as if there 
were none in history to match it. 

Soon after John's death I listened to a music- 
box, and if, at any time, that event had seemed 
inconsistent with the beauty and harmony of the 
universe, it was then gently constrained into the 
placid course of nature by those steady notes, in 
mild and unoffended tone echoing far and wide 
under the heavens. But I find these things 
more strange than sad to me. What right have 
I to grieve, who have not ceased to wonder? 
We feel at first as if some opportunities of kind- 
ness and sympathy were lost, but learn after- 
ward that any pure grief is ample recompense 
for all. That is, if we are faithful ; for a great 
.grief is but sympathy with the soul that dis- 
poses events, and is as natural as the resin on 
Arabian trees. Only Nature has a right to 
grieve perpetually, for she only is innocent. 
Soon the ice will melt, and the blackbirds sing

along the river which he frequented, as pleas- 
antly as ever. The same everlasting serenity 
will appear in this face of God, and we will not 
be sorrowful if he is not. 

We are made happy when reason can discover 
no occasion for it. The memory of some past 
moments is more persuasive than the experience 
of present ones. There have been visions of 
such breadth and brightness that these motes 
were invisible in their light. 

I do not wish to see John ever again, I mean 
him who is dead, but that other, whom only 
he would have wished to see, or to be, of whom 
he was the imperfect representative. For we are 
not what we are, nor do we treat or esteem each 
other for such, but for what we are capable of 
being. 

As for Waldo, he died as the mist rises from 
the brook, which the sun will soon dart his rays 
through. Do not the flowers die every autumn ? 
He had not even taken root here. I was not 
startled to hear that he was dead ; it seemed the 
most natural event that could happen. His fine 
organization demanded it, and nature gently 
yielded its request. It would have been strange 
if he had lived. Neither will nature manifest 
any sorrow at his death, but soon the note of the 
lark will be heard down in the meadow, and 
fresh dandelions will spring from the old stocks 
where he plucked them last summer.

TO MRS. LUCY BROWN (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, January 24, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, The other day I wrote you 
a letter to go in Mrs. Emerson's bundle, but, as 

1 Mrs. Brown, to whom this letter and several others of the 
years 1841-43 were written, lived by turns in Plymouth, her 
native place, and in Concord, where she often visited Mrs. 
Emerson at the time when Thoreau was an inmate of the 
Emerson household. In the early part of 1843 she was in 
Plymouth, and her sister was sending her newspapers and 
other things, from time to time. The incident of the music- 
box, mentioned above, occurred at the Old Manse, where Haw- 
thorne was living from the summer of 1842 until the spring of 
i in I was often visited by Thoreau and Ellery Channing. 
In the letter following, this incident is recalled, and with it 
the agreeable gift by Richard Fuller (a younger brother of 
Margaret Fuller and of Ellen, the wife of Ellery Channing, 
who came to reside in Concord about these years, and soon 
became Thoreau's most intimate friend), which was a music- 
box for the Thoreans. They were all fond of music, and 
enjoyed it even in this mechanical form, one evidence of the 
simple conditions of life in Concord then. The note of thanks 
to young Fuller, who had been, perhaps, a pupil of Thoreau, 
follows this letter to Mrs. Brown, though earlier in date. Mary 
Russell afterwards became Mrs. Manton Watson.

it seemed unworthy, I did not send it, and now, 
to atone for that, I am going to send this, whether 
it be worthy or not. I will not venture upon 
news, for, as all the household are gone to bed, 
I cannot learn what has been told you. Do you 
read any noble verses nowadays ? or do not verses 
still seem noble ? For my own part, they have 
been the only things I remembered, or that 
which occasioned them, when all things else 
were blurred and defaced. All things have put 
on mourning but they; for the elegy itself is 
some victorious melody or joy escaping from the 
wreck 

It is a relief to read some true book, wherein 
all are equally dead, equally alive. I think 
the best parts of Shakespeare would only be 
enhanced by the most thrilling and affecting 
events. I have found it so. And so much the 
more, as they are not intended for consolation. 

Do you think of coming to Concord again ? I 
shall be glad to see you. I should be glad to 
know that I could see you when I would. 

We always seem to be living just on the brink 
of a pure and lofty intercourse, which would 
make the ills and trivialness of life ridiculous. 
After each little interval, though it be but for 
the night, we are prepared to meet each other as 
gods and goddesses. 

I seem to have dodged all my days with one 



*r.25.] TO MRS. LUCY BROWN. 51 

or two persons, and lived upon expectation, as 
if the bud would surely blossom ; and so I am 
content to live. 

What means the fact, which is so common, 
so universal, that some soul that has lost all 
hope for itself can inspire in another listening 
soul an infinite confidence in it, even while it is 
expressing its despair ? 

I am very happy in my present environment, 
though actually mean enough myself, and so, of 
course, all around me ; yet, I am sure, we for the 
most part are transfigured to one another, and are 
that to the other which we aspire to be ourselves. 
The longest course of mean and trivial intercourse 
may not prevent my practicing this divine cour- 
tesy to my companion. Notwithstanding all I 
hear about brooms, and scouring, and taxes, and 
housekeeping, I am constrained to live a strangely 
mixed life, as if even Valhalla might have its 
kitchen. We are all of us Apollos serving some 
Admetus. 

I think I must have some Muses in my pay 
that I know not of, for certain musical wishes of 
mine are answered as soon as entertained. Last 
summer I went to Hawthorne's suddenly for the 
express purpose of borrowing his music-box, and 
almost immediately Mrs. Hawthorne proposed to 
lend it to me. The other day I said I must go 
to Mrs. Barrett's to hear hers, and, lo ! straight-

way Richard Fuller sent me one for a present 
from Cambridge. It is a very good one. I 
should like to have you hear it. I shall not 
have to employ you to borrow for me now. 
Good-night. 

From your affectionate friend, 

H. D. T. 

TO RICHARD F. FULLER (AT CAMBRIDGE). 

CONCORD, January 16, 1843. 

DEAR EICHARD, I need not thank you for 
your present, for I hear its music, which seems 
to be playing just for us two pilgrims marching 
over hill and dale of a summer afternoon, up 
those long Bolton hills and by those bright Har- 
vard lakes, such as I see in the placid Lucerne 
on the lid ; and whenever I hear it, it will recall 
happy hours passed with its donor. 

When did mankind make that foray into na- 
ture and bring off this booty ? For certainly it 
is but history that some rare virtue in remote 
times plundered these strains from above and 
communicated them to men. Whatever we may 
think of it, it is a part of the harmony of the 
spheres you have sent me; which has conde- 
scended to serve us Admetuses, and I hope I 
may so behave that this may always be the tenor 
of your thought for me. 

If you have any strains, the conquest of your

own spear or quill, to accompany these, let the 
winds waft them also to me. 

I write this with one of the " primaries " of 
my osprey's wings, which I have preserved over 
my glass for some state occasion, and now it 
offers. 

Mrs. Emerson sends her love. 

TO MBS. LUCY BBOWN (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, Friday evening', 
January 25, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, Mrs. Emerson asks me to 
write you a letter, which she will put into her 
bundle to-morrow along with the " Tribunes " and 
" Standards," and miscellanies, and what not, to 
make an assortment. But what shall I write ? 
You live a good way off, and I don't know that 
I have anything which will bear sending so far. 
But I am mistaken, or rather impatient when I 
say this, for we all have a gift to send, not 
only when the year begins, but as long as inter- 
est and memory last. I don't know whether you 
have got the many I have sent you, or rather 
whether you were quite sure where they came 
from. I mean the letters I have sometimes 
launched off eastward in my thought; but if 
you have been happier at one time than another, 
think that then you received them. But this 
that I now send you is of another sort. It will 



54 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

go slowly, drawn by horses over muddy roads, 
and lose much of its little value by the way. 
You may have to pay for it, and it may not 
make you happy after all. But what shall be 
my new-year's gift, then? Why, I will send 
you my still fresh remembrance of the hours I 
have passed with you here, for I find in the re- 
membrance of them the best gift you have left 
to me. We are poor and sick creatures at best ; 
but we can have well memories, and sound and 
healthy thoughts of one another still, and an in- 
tercourse may be remembered which was without 
blur, and above us both. 

Perhaps you may like to know of my estate 
nowadays. As usual, I find it harder to account 
for the happiness I enjoy, than for the sadness 
which instructs me occasionally. If the little of 
this last which visits me would only be sadder, 
it would be happier. One while I am vexed by 
a sense of meanness ; one while I simply wonder 
at the mystery of life ; and at another, and at 
another, seem to rest on my oars, as if propelled 
by propitious breezes from I know not what 
quarter. But for the most part I am an idle, 
inefficient, lingering (one term will do as well 
as another, where all are true and none true 
enough) member of the great commonwealth, 
who have most need of my own charity, if I 
could not be charitable and indulgent to myself, 



T.25.] TO MRS. LUCY BROWN. 55 

perhaps as good a subject for my own satire as 
any. You see how, when I come to talk of my- 
self, I soon run dry, for I would fain make that 
a subject which can be no subject for me, at 
least not till I have the grace to rule myself. 

I do not venture to say anything about your 
griefs, for it would be unnatural for me to speak 
as if I grieved with you, when I think I do not. 
If I were to see you, it might be otherwise. But 
I know you will pardon the trivialness of this 
letter ; and I only hope as I know that you 
have reason to be so that you are still happier 
than you are sad, and that you remember that 
the smallest seed of faith is of more worth than 
the largest fruit of happiness. I have no doubt 

that out of S 's death you sometimes draw 

sweet consolation, not only for that, but for 
long-standing griefs, and may find some things 
made smooth by it, which before were rough. 

I wish you would communicate with me, and 
not think me unworthy to know any of your 
thoughts. Don't think me unkind because I 
have not written to you. I confess it was for so 
poor a reason as that you almost made a princi- 
ple of not answering. I could not speak truly 
with this ugly fact in the way ; and perhaps I 
wished to be assured, by such evidence as you 
could not voluntarily give, that it was a kind- 
ness. For every glance at the moon, does she 



56 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

not send me an answering ray? Noah would 
hardly have done himself the pleasure to release 
his dove, if she had not been about to come back 
to him with tidings of green islands amid the 
waste. 

But these are far-fetched reasons. I am not 
speaking directly enough to yourself now ; so let 
me say directly 

From your friend, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

Exactly when correspondence began between 
Emerson and Thoreau is not now to be ascer- 
tained, since all the letters do not seem to have 
been preserved. Their acquaintance opened 
while Thoreau was in college, although Emer- 
son may have seen the studious boy at the town 
school in Concord, or at the "Academy" there, 
while fitting for college. But they only came to 
know each other as sharers of the same thoughts 
and aspirations in the autumn of 1837, when, on 
hearing a new lecture of Emerson's, Helen Tho- 
reau said to Mrs. Brown, then living or visiting 
in the Thoreau family, " Henry has a thought 
very like that in his journal " (which he had 
newly begun to keep). Mrs. Brown desired to 
see the passage, and soon bore it to her sister, 
Mrs. Emerson, whose husband saw it, and asked 
Mrs. Brown to bring her young friend to see 



*r.r,.] THOREAU AND EMERSON. 57 

him. By 1838 their new relation of respect was 
established, and Emerson wrote to a correspond- 
ent, " I delight much in my young friend, who 
seems to have as free and erect a mind as any I 
have ever met." A year later (Aug. 9, 1839), he 
wrote to Carlyle, " I have a young poet in this 
village, named Thoreau, who writes the truest 
verses." Indeed, it was in the years 1839-40 
that he seems to have written the poems by which 
he is best remembered. Thoreau told me in his 
last illness that he had written many verses and 
destroyed many, this fact he then regretted, 
although he had done it at the instance of Em- 
erson, who did not praise them. But, said he, 
" they may have been better than we thought 
them, twenty years ago." 

The earliest note which I find from Emerson 
to Thoreau bears no date, but must have been 
written before 1842, for at no later time could 
the persons named in it have visited Concord 
together. Most likely it was in the summer of 
1840, and to the same date do I assign a note 
asking Henry to join the Emersons in a party 
to the Cliffs (scopuli Pulchri-Portus), and to 
bring his flute, for on that pastoral reed Tho- 
reau played sweetly. The first series of letters 
from Thoreau to Emerson begins early in 1843, 
about the time the letters just given were writ- 
ten to Mrs. Brown. In the first he gives thanks 



58 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

to Emerson for the hospitality of his house in 
the two preceding years ; a theme to which he 
returned a few months later, for I doubt not 
the lovely sad poem called " The Departure " 
was written at Staten Island soon after his leav- 
ing the Emerson house in Concord for the more 
stately but less congenial residence of William 
Emerson at Staten Island, whither he betook 
himself in May, 1843. This first letter, how- 
ever, was sent from the Concord home to Waldo 
Emerson at Staten Island, or perhaps in New 
York, where he was that winter giving a course 
of lectures. 

In explanation of the passages concerning 
Bronson Alcott, in this letter, it should be said 
that he was then living at the Hosmer Cottage, 
in Concord, with his English friends, Charles 
Lane and Henry Wright, and that he had re- 
fused to pay a tax in support of what he consid- 
ered an unjust government, and was arrested by 
the constable, Sam Staples, in consequence. 

TO R. W. EMERSON (AT NEW YORK). 

CONCORD, January 24, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, The best way to correct a 
mistake is to make it right. I had not spoken 
of writing to you, but as you say you are about 
to write to me when you get my letter, I make 
haste on my part in order to get yours the sooner. 



r.25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 59 

I don't well know what to say to earn the forth- 
coming epistle, unless that Edith takes rapid 
strides in the arts and sciences or music and 
natural history as well as over the carpet ; 
that she says " papa " less and less abstractedly 
every day, looking in my face, which may 
sound like a Ranz des Vaches to yourself. And 
Kllt-n declares every morning that " papa may 
come home to-night ; " and by and by it will 
have changed to such positive statement as that 
" papa came home larks night." 

Elizabeth Hoar still flits about these clearings, 
and I meet her here and there, and in all houses 
but her own, but as if I were not the less of her 
family for all that. I have made slight acquaint- 
ance also with one Mrs. Lidian Emerson, who 
almost persuades me to be a Christian, but I 
fear I as often lapse into heathenism. Mr. 
O'Sullivan l was here three days. I met him at 
the Atheneum [Concord], and went to Haw- 
thorne's [at the Old Manse] to tea with him. 
He expressed a great deal of interest in your 
poems, and wished me to give him a list of 
them, which I did ; he saying he did not know 
hut he should notice them. He is a rather puny- 
looking man, and did not strike me. We had 
nothing to say to one another, and therefore we

Emerson, Thoreau, and Whittier all wrote, more or leas. 



60 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

said a great deal ! He, however, made a point 
of asking me to write for his Review, which I 
shall be glad to do. He is, at any rate, one of 
the not-bad, but does not by any means take you 
by storm, no, nor by calm, which is the best 
way. He expects to see you in New York. After 
tea I carried him and Hawthorne to the Lyceum. 

Mr. Alcott has not altered much since you 
left. I think you will find him much the same 
sort of person. With Mr. Lane I have had one 
regular chat a la George Minott, which of course 
was greatly to our mutual grati- and edification ; 
and, as two or three as regular conversations 
have taken place since, I fear there may have 
been a precession of the equinoxes. Mr. Wright, 
according to the last accounts, is in Lynn, with 
uncertain aims and prospects, maturing slowly, 
perhaps, as indeed are all of us. I suppose they 
have told you how near Mr. Alcott went to the 
jail, but I can add a good anecdote to the rest. 
When Staples came to collect Mrs. Ward's taxes, 
my sister Helen asked him what he thought Mr. 
Alcott meant, what his idea was, and he 
answered, " I vum, I believe it was nothing but 
principle, for I never heerd a man talk hon- 
ester." 

There was a lecture on Peace by a Mr. Spear 
(ought he not to be beaten into a ploughshare ?), 
the same evening, and, as the gentlemen, Lane 



JET. 25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 61 

and Alcott, dined at our house while the matter 
was in suspense, that is, while the constable 
was waiting for his receipt from the jailer, 
we there settled it that we, that is, Lane and 
myself, perhaps, should agitate the State while 
Winkelried lay in durance. But when, over the 
audience, I saw our hero's head moving in the 
free air of the Universalist church, my fire all 
went out, and the State was safe as far as I was 
concerned. But Lane, it seems, had cogitated 
and even written on the matter, in the afternoon, 
and so, out of courtesy, taking his point of de- 
parture from the Spear-man's lecture, he drove 
gracefully in medias res, and gave the affair a 
very good setting out ; but, to spoil all, our mar- 
tyr very characteristically, but, as artists would 
say, in bad taste, brought up the rear with a 
"My Prisons," which made us forget Silvio 
Pellico himself. 

Mr. Lane wishes me to ask you to see if there 
is anything for him in the New York office, and 
pay the charges. Will you tell me what to do 
with Mr. [Theodore] Parker, who was to lecture 
February 15th ? Mrs. Emerson says my letter 
is written instead of one from her. 

At the end of this strange letter I will not 
write what alone I had to say to thank you 
and Mrs. Emerson for your long kindness to me. 
It would be more ungrateful than my constant 



62 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

thought. I have been your pensioner for nearly 
two years, and still left free as under the sky. 
It has been as free a gift as the sun or the sum- 
mer, though I have sometimes molested you with 
my mean acceptance of it, I who have failed 
to render even those slight services of the hand 
which would have been for a sign at least ; and, 
by the fault of my nature, have failed of many 
better and higher services. But I will not trou- 
ble you with this, but for once thank you as well 
as Heaven. 

Your friend, H. D. T. 

Mrs. Lidian Emerson, the wife of R. W. Em- 
erson, and her two daughters, Ellen and Edith, 
are named in this first letter, and will be fre- 
quently mentioned in the correspondence. At 
this date, Edith, now Mrs. W. H. Forbes, was 
fourteen months old. Mr. Emerson's mother, 
Madam Ruth Emerson, was also one of the 
household, which had for a little more than 
seven years occupied the well-known house un- 
der the trees, east of the village. 

TO K. W. EMERSON (AT NEW YORK). 

CONCORD, February 10, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, I have stolen one of your 
own sheets to write you a letter upon, and I 
hope, with two layers of ink, to turn it into a 



*r.2o.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 63 

comforter. If you like to receive a letter from 
me, too, I am glad, for it gives me pleasure to 
write. But don't let it come amiss ; it must 
fall as harmlessly as leaves settle on the land- 
scape. I will tell you what we are doing this 
now. Supper is done, and Edith the dessert, 
perhaps more than the dessert is brought in, 
or even comes in per se ; and round she goes, 
now to this altar, and then to that, with her 
monosyllabic invocation of " oc," " oc." It 
makes me think of " Langue d'oc." She must 
belong to that province. And like the gypsies 
she talks a language of her own while she un- 
derstands ours. While she jabbers Sanscrit, 
Parsee, Pehlvi, say " Edith go bah ! " and " bah " 
it is. No intelligence passes between us. She 
knows. It is a capital joke, that is the reason 
she smiles so. How well the secret is kept ! she 
never descends to explanation. It is not buried 
like a common secret, bolstered up on two sides, 
but by an eternal silence on the one side, at 
least. It has been long kept, and comes in from 
the unexplored horizon, like a blue mountain 
range, to end abruptly at our door one day. 
(Don't stumble at this steep simile.) And now 
she studies the heights and depths of nature 



On sliouM'-rs whirled in dome eccentric orbit 
Jtmt by old P*tum's temples and the perch 
Where Time doth plume his wings. 



64 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

And now she runs the race over the carpet, while 
all Olympia applauds, mamma, grandma, and 
uncle, good Grecians aD, and that dark-hued 
barbarian, Partheanna Parker, whose shafts go 
through and through, not backward ! Grand- 
mamma smiles over all, and mamma is wonder- 
ing what papa would say, should she descend on 
Carlton House some day. " Larks night " 's 
abed, dreaming of " pleased faces " far away. 
But now the trumpet sounds, the games are 
over; some Hebe comes, and Edith is trans- 
lated. I don't know where ; it must be to some 
cloud, for I never was there. 

Query : what becomes of the answers Edith 
thinks, but cannot express ? She really gives 
you glances which are before this world was. 
You can't feel any difference of age, except that 
you have longer legs and arms. 

Mrs. Emerson said I must tell you about do- 
mestic affairs, when I mentioned that I was going 
to write. Perhaps it will inform you of the state 
of all if I only say that I am well and happy 
in your house here in Concord. 

Your friend, HENRY. 

Don't forget to tell us what to do with Mr. 
Parker when you write next. I lectured this 
week. It was as bright a night as you could 
wish. I hope there were no stars thrown away 
on the occasion. 



Jtr.25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 65 

[A part of the same letter, though bearing 
a date two days later, and written in a wholly 
different style, as from one sage to another, is 
this postscript.] 

February 12, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, As the packet still tarries, 
I will send you some thoughts, which I have 
lately relearned, as the latest public and private 
news. 

How mean are our relations to one another ! 
Let us pause till they are nobler. A little silence, 
a little rest, is good. It would be sufficient em- 
ployment only to cultivate true ones. 

The richest gifts we can bestow are the least 
marketable. We hate the kindness which we 
understand. A noble person confers no such 
gift as his whole confidence : none so exalts the 
giver and the receiver ; it produces the truest 
gratitude. Perhaps it is only essential to friend- 
sliip that some vital trust should have been re- 
posed by the one in the other. I feel addressed 
and probed even to the remote parts of my being 
when one nobly shows, even in trivial things, an 
implicit faith in me. When such divine com- 
modities are so near and cheap, how strange that 
it should have to be each day's discovery I A 
threat or a curse may be forgotten, but this mild 
trust translates me. I am no more of this earth ; 



66 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

it acts dynamically; it changes my very sub- 
stance. I cannot do what before I did. I can- 
not be what before I was. Other chains may 
be broken, but in the darkest night, in the re- 
motest place, I trail this thread. Then things 
cannot happen. What if God were to confide 
in us for a moment ! Should we not then be 
gods? 

How subtle a thing is this confidence ! No- 
thing sensible passes between ; never any conse- 
quences are to be apprehended should it be mis- 
placed. Yet something has transpired. A new 
behavior springs ; the ship carries new ballast 
in her hold. A sufficiently great and generous 
trust could never be abused. It should be cause 
to lay down one's life, which would not be to 
lose it. Can there be any mistake up there? 
Don't the gods know where to invest their 
wealth ? Such confidence, too, would be recip- 
rocal. When one confides greatly in you, he 
will feel the roots of an equal trust fastening 
themselves in him. When such trust has been 
received or reposed, we dare not speak, hardly 
to see each other ; our voices sound harsh and 
untrustworthy. We are as instruments which 
the Powers have dealt with. Through what 
straits would we not carry this little burden of 
a magnanimous trust ! Yet no harm could pos- 
sibly come, but simply faithlessness. Not a 



.25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 67 

feather, not a straw, is intrusted ; that packet 
is empty. It is only committed to us, and, as it 
were, all things are committed to us. 

The kindness I have longest remembered has 
been of this sort, the sort unsaid ; so far be- 
hind the speaker's lips that almost it already 
lay in my heart. It did not have far to go to 
be communicated. The gods cannot misunder- 
stand, man cannot explain. We communicate 
like the burrows of foxes, in silence and dark- 
ness, under ground. We are undermined by 
faith and love. How much more full is Nature 
where we think the empty space is than where 
we place the solids ! full of fluid influences. 
Should we ever communicate but by these ? The 
spirit abhors a vacuum more than Nature. 
There is a tide which pierces the pores of the 
air. These aerial rivers, let us not pollute their 
currents. What meadows do they course 
through ? How many fine mails there are 
which traverse their routes ! He is privileged 
who gets his letter franked by them. 

I believe these things. 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

Emerson replied to these letters in two epis- 
tles of dates from February 4 to 12, 1843, 
in the latter asking Thoreau to aid him in edit- 
ing the April number of the " Dial," of which 



68 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

he had taken charge. Among other things, 
Emerson desired a manuscript of Charles Lane, 
Alcott's English friend, to be sent to him in 
New York, where he was detained several weeks 
by his lectures. He added : " Have we no 
news from Wheeler ? Has Bartlett none ? " 
Of these persons, the first, Charles Stearns 
Wheeler, a college classmate of Thoreau, and 
later Greek tutor in the college, had gone to 
Germany, where he died the next summer, 
and was contributing to the quarterly " Dial." 
Robert Bartlett, of Plymouth, a townsman of 
Mrs. Emerson, was Wheeler's intimate friend, 
with whom he corresponded. 1 To this editorial 

1 An interesting fact in connection with Thoreau and 
Wheeler (whose home was in Lincoln, four miles southeast of 
Concord) is related by Ellery Channing in a note to me. It 
seems that Wheeler had built for himself, or hired from a 
farmer, a rough woodland study near Flint's Pond, half way 
from Lincoln to Concord, which he occupied for a short time 
in 1841-42, and where Thoreau and Channing visited him. 
Mr. Channing wrote me in 1883 : " Stearns Wheeler built a 
'shanty ' on Flint's Pond for the purpose of economy, for pur- 
chasing Greek books and going abroad to study. Whether 
Mr. Thoreau assisted him to build this shanty I cannot say, 
but I think he may have ; also that he spent six weeks with 
him there. As Mr. Thoreau was not too original and inven- 
tive to follow the example of others, if good to him, it is very 
probable this undertaking of Stearns Wheeler, whom he re- 
garded (as I think I have heard him say) a heroic character, 
suggested his own experiment on Walden. I believe I visited 
this shanty with Mr. Thoreau. It was very plain, with bunks 
of straw, and built in the Irish manner. I think Mr. Wheeler

request Thoreau, who was punctuality itself, re- 
plied at once. 

TO R. W. EMERSOX (AT NEW YORK). 

CONCORD, February 15, 1843. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I got your letters, one 
yesterday and the other to-day, and they have 
made me quite happy. As a packet is to go in 
the morning, I will give you a hasty account of 
the " Dial." I called on Mr. Lane this after- 
noon, and brought away, together with an abun- 
dance of good-will, first, a bulky catalogue of 
books without commentary, some eight hun- 
dred, I think he told me, with an introduction 
filling one sheet, ten or a dozen pages, say, 
though I have only glanced at them ; second, 

was as good a mechanic as Mr. Thoreau, and built this shanty 
for his own use. The object of these two experiments was 
quite unlike, except in the common purpose of economy. It 
seems to me highly probable that Mr. Wheeler's experiment 
suggested Mr. Thoreau's, as he was a man he almost wor- 
shiped. But I could not understand what relation Mr. Low- 
ell had to this fact, if it be one. Students, in all parts of the 
earth, have pursued a similar course from motives of economy, 
and to carry out some special study. Mr. Thoreau wished to 
study birds, flowers, and the stone age, just as Mr. Wheeler 
wished to study Greek. And Mr. Hotham came next from 
just the same motive of economy (necessity) and to study the 
Bible. The prudential sides of all three were the same." 
Mr. Hotham was the young theological student who dwelt in 
a cabin by Walden in 1809-70. 



70 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

a review twenty-five or thirty printed pages 
of Conversations oil the Gospels, Record of 
a School, and Spiritual Culture, with rather 
copious extracts. However, it is a good sub- 
ject, and Lane says it gives him satisfaction. 
I will give it a faithful reading directly. [These 
were Alcott's publications, reviewed by Lane.] 
And now I come to the little end of the horn ; 
for myself, I have brought along the Minor 
Greek Poets, and will mine there for a scrap or 
two, at least. As for Etzler, I don't remember 
any " rude and snappish speech " that you made, 
and if you did it must have been longer than 
anything I had written ; however, here is the 
book still, and I will try. Perhaps I have some 
few scraps in my Journal which you may choose 
to print. The translation of the -^schylus I 
should like very well to continue anon, if it 
should be worth the while. As for poetry, I 
have not remembered to write any for some 
time ; it has quite slipped my mind ; but some- 
times I think I hear the mutterings of the thun- 
der. Don't you remember that last summer we 
heard a low, tremulous sound in the woods and 
over the hills, and thought it was partridges or 
rocks, and it proved to be thunder gone down 
the river ? But sometimes it was over Way land 
way, and at last burst over our heads. So we '11 
not despair by reason of the drought. You see 






ft. 25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 71 

it takes a good many words to supply the place 
of one deed ; a hundred lines to a cobweb, and 
but one cable to a man-of-war. The " Dial " 
case needs to be reformed in many particulars. 
There is no news from Wheeler, none from 
Bartlett 

They all look well and happy in this house, 
where it gives me much pleasure to dwell. 

Yours in haste, HENRY. 

P. S. 

Wednesday evening 1 , February 16. 

DEAR FRIEND, I have time to write a few 
words about the " Dial." I have just received 
the three first signatures, which do not yet com- 
plete Lane's piece. He will place five hundred 
copies for sale at Munroe's bookstore. Wheeler 
has sent you two full sheets more about the 
German universities and proper names, which 
will have to be printed in alphabetical order for 
convenience ; what this one has done, that one 
is doing, and the other intends to do. Ham- 
mer-Purgstall (Von Hammer) may be one, for 
aught I know. However, there are two or 
three things in it, as well as names. One of 
the books of Herodotus is discovered to be out 
of place. He says >oiiirthiiuj about having sent 
to Lowell, by the last steamer, a budget of lit- 
erary news, which he will have communicated to

you ere this. Mr. Alcott has a letter from He- 
raud, 1 and a book written by him, the Life 
of Savonarola, which he wishes to have re- 
published here. Mr. Lane will write a notice 
of it. (The latter says that what is in the New 
York post-office may be directed to Mr. Alcott.) 
Miss [Elizabeth] Peabody has sent a " Notice 
to the readers of the ' Dial,' " which is not 
good. 

Mr. Chapin lectured this evening, and so 
rhetorically that I forgot my duty and heard 
very little. I find myself better than I have 
been, and am meditating some other method of 
paying debts than by lectures and "writing, 
which will only do to talk about. If anything 
of that " other " sort should come to your ears 
in New York, will you remember it for me ? 

Excuse this scrawl, which I have written over 
the embers in the dining-room. I hope that you 
live on good terms with yourself and the gods. 
Yours in haste, HENEY. 

Mr. Lane and his lucubrations proved to be 
tough subjects, and the next letter has more to 
say about them and the " Dial." Lane had 
undertaken to do justice to Mr. Alcott and his 
books, as may still be read in the pages of that

April number of the Transcendentalist quar- 
terly. 

TO R. W. EMERSOX (AT NEW YORK). 

CONCORD, February 20, 1843. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I have read Mr. Lane's 
review, and can say, speaking for this world and 
for fallen man, that " it is good for us." As 
they say in geology, time never fails, there is 
always enough of it, so I may say, criticism 
never fails ; but if I go and read elsewhere, I 
say it is good, far better than any notice Mr. 
Alcott has received, or is likely to receive from 
another quarter. It is at any rate " the other 
side," which Boston needs to hear. I do not 
send it to you, because time is precious, and 
because I think you would accept it, after all. 
After speaking briefly of the fate of Goethe 
and Carlyle in their own countries, he says, 
"To Emerson in his own circle is but slowly 
accorded a worthy response ; and Alcott, al- 
most utterly neglected," etc. I will strike out 
what relates to yourself, and correcting some 
verbal faults, send the rest to the printer with 
Lane's initials. 

The catalogue needs amendment, I think. It 
wants completeness now. It should consist of 
such books only as they would tell Mr. [F. II.] 
Hedge and [Theodore] Parker they had got ; 



74 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

omitting the Bible, the classics, and much be- 
sides, for there the incompleteness begins. 
But you will be here in season for this. 

It is frequently easy to make Mr. Lane more 
universal and attractive ; to write, for instance, 
" universal ends " instead of " the universal 
end," just as we pull open the petals of a flower 
with our fingers where they are confined by its 
own sweets. Also he had better not say " books 
designed for the nucleus of a, Home University," 
until he makes that word " home " ring solid 
and universal too. This is that abominable dia- 
lect. He had just given me a notice of George 
Bradford's Fenelon for the Record of the 
Months, and speaks of extras of the Review and 
Catalogue, if they are printed, even a hun- 
dred, or thereabouts. How shall this be ar- 
ranged ? Also he wishes to use some manu- 
scripts of his which are in your possession, if 
you do not. Can I get them ? 

I think of no news to tell you. It is a serene 
summer day here, all above the snow. The hens 
steal their nests, and I steal their eggs still, as 
formerly. This is what I do with the hands. 
Ah, labor, it is a divine institution, and con- 
versation with many men and hens. 

Do not think that my letters require as many 
special answers. I get one as often as you write 
to Concord. Concord inquires for you daily, as 



r.25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 75 

do all the members of this house. You must 
make haste home before we have settled all the 
great questions, for they are fast being disposed 
of. But I must leave room for Mrs. merson. 

Mrs. Emerson's letter, after speaking of other 
matters, gave a lively sketch of Thoreau at one 
of Alcott's Conversations in her house, which 
may be quoted as illustrating the young Nature- 
worshiper's position at the time, and the more 
humane and socialistic spirit of Alcott and Lane, 
who were soon to leave Concord for their exper- 
iment of communistic life at " Fruitlands," in 
the rural town of Harvard. 

u Last evening we had the ' Conversation,' 
though, owing to the bad weather, but few at- 
tended. The subjects were : What is Prophecy ? 
Who is a Prophet? and The Love of Nature. 
Mr. Lane decided, as for all time and the race, 
that this same love of nature of which Henry 
[Thoreau] was the champion, and Elizabeth 
Hoar and Lidian (though L. disclaimed possess- 
ing it herself) his faithful squiresses that this 
love was the most subtle and dangerous of sins ; 
a refined idolatry, much more to be dreaded than 
gross wickednesses, because the gross sinner 
would be alarmed by the depth of his degrada- 
tion, and come up from it in terror, but the un- 
happy idolaters of Nature were deceived by the 



76 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

refined quality of their sin, and would be the last 
to enter the kingdom. Henry frankly affirmed 
to both the wise men that they were wholly defi- 
cient in the faculty in question, and therefore 
could not judge of it. And Mr. Alcott as 
frankly answered that it was because they went 
beyond the mere material objects, and were filled 
with spiritual love and perception (as Mr. T. 
was not), that they seemed to Mr. Thoreau not 
to appreciate outward nature. I am very heavy, 
and have spoiled a most excellent story. I have 
given you no idea of the scene, which was ineffa- 
bly comic, though it made no laugh at the time ; 
I scarcely laughed at it myself, too deeply 
amused to give the usual sign. Henry was brave 
and noble ; well as I have always liked him, he 
still grows upon me." 

Before going to Staten Island in May, 1843, 
Thoreau answered a letter from the same Rich- 
ard Fuller who had made him the musical gift 
in the previous winter. He was at Harvard 
College, and desired to know something of Tho- 
reau's pursuits there, concerning which Chan- 
ning says in his Life : 1 " He was a respectable 

1 Thoreau, the Poet-Naturalist. With Memorial Verses. By 
William Ellery Channing (Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1873). 
This volume, in some respects the best biography of Thoreau, 
is now quite rare. Among the Memorial Verses are those 
written by Channing for his friend's funeral ; at which, also, 
Mr. Alcott read Thoreau's poem of Sympathy. 



*r.25.J TO RICHARD F. FULLER. 77 

student, having done there a bold reading in 
English poetry, even to some portions or the 
whole of Davenant's ' Gondibert.' " This, Tho- 
reau does not mention in his letter, but it was 
one of the things that attracted Emerson's no- 
tice, since he also had the same taste for the 
Elizabethan and Jacobean English poets. An 
English youth, Henry Headley, pupil of Dr. 
Parr, and graduate of Oxford in 1786, had pre- 
ceded Thoreau in this study of poets that had 
become obsolete ; and it was perhaps Headley's 
volume, "Select Beauties of Ancient English 
Poetry, with Remarks by the late Henry Head- 
ley," published long after his death, 1 that served 
Thoreau as a guide to Quarles and the Fletch- 
ers, Daniel, Drummond, Drayton, Habington, 
and Raleigh, poets that few Americans had 
heard of in 1833. 

TO RICHABD F. FULLER (AT CAMBRIDGE). 

CONCORD, April 2, 1843. 

DEAR RICHARD, I was glad to receive a 
letter from you so bright and cheery. You 
speak of not having made any conquests with 
your own spear or quill as yet ; but if you are 
tempering your spear-head during these days, 

1 Headley died at the age of twenty-three, in 17A8. Hi 
posthumous book was edited in 1810 by Rev. ileury Kelt, and 
published in London by John Sharp. 



78 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

and fitting a straight and tough shaft thereto, 
will not that suffice? We are more pleased to 
consider the hero in the forest cutting cornel or 
ash for his spear, than marching in triumph 
with his trophies. The present hour is always 
wealthiest when it is poorer than the future 
ones, as that is the pleasantest site, which affords 
the pleasantest prospects. 

What you say about your studies furnishing 
you with a " mimic idiom " only, reminds me 
that we shall all do well if we learn so much as 
to talk, to speak truth. The only fruit which 
even much living yields seems to be often only 
some trivial success, the ability to do some 
slight thing better. We make conquest only of 
husks and shells for the most part, at least 
apparently, but sometimes these are cinnamon 
and spices, you know. Even the grown hunter 
you speak of slays a thousand buffaloes, and 
brings off only their hides and tongues. What 
immense sacrifices, what hecatombs and holo- 
causts, the gods exact for very slight favors ! 
How much sincere life before we can even utter 
one sincere word. 

What I was learning in college was chiefly, I 
think, to express myself, and I see now, that as 
the old orator prescribed, 1st, action ; 2d, ac- 
tion ; 3d, action ; my teachers should have pre- 
scribed to me, 1st, sincerity; 2d, sincerity; 3d, 



r.25.] TO RICHARD F. FULLER. 79 

sincerity. The old mythology is incomplete 
without a god or goddess of sincerity, on whose 
altars we might offer up all the products of our 
farms, our workshops, and our studies. It 
should be our Lar when we sit on the hearth, 
and our Tutelar Genius when we walk abroad. 
This is the only panacea. I mean sincerity in 
our dealings with ourselves mainly ; any other 
is comparatively easy. But I must stop before 
I get to ITthly. I believe I have but one text 
and one sermon. 

Your rural adventures beyond the West Cam- 
bridge hills have probably lost nothing by dis- 
tance of time or space. I used to hear only the 
sough of the wind in the woods of Concord, 
when I was striving to give my attention to a 
page of Calculus. But, depend upon it, you will 
love your native hills the better for being sepa- 
rated from them. 

I expect to leave Concord, which is my Rome, 
and its people, who are my Romans, in May, 
and go to New York, to be a tutor in Mr. Wil- 
liam Emerson's family. So I will bid you good 
by till I see you or hear from you again. 

Going to Staten Island, early in May, 1843, 
Thoreau's first care was to write to his "Ro- 
mans, countrymen, and lovers by the banks of 
the Musketaquid," beginning with his mother. 



80 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

his sisters, and Mrs. Emerson. To Sophia and 
Mrs. E. he wrote May 22, to Helen, with a 
few touching verses on his brother John, the 
next day ; and then he resumed the correspond- 
ence with Emerson. It seems that one of his 
errands near New York was to make the ac- 
quaintance of literary men and journalists in 
the city, in order to find a vehicle for publica- 
tion, such as his neighbor Hawthorne had finally 
found in the pages of the " Democratic Review." 
For this purpose Thoreau made himself known 
to Henry James, and other friends of Emerson, 
and to Horace Greeley, then in the first fresh- 
ness of his success with the " Tribune," - a 
newspaper hardly more than two years old then, 
but destined to a great career, in which several 
of the early Transcendentalists took some part. 

TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER (AT CONCORD). 
CASTLETON, STATEN ISLAND, May 11, 1843. 

DEAR MOTHER AND FRIENDS AT HOME, 
We arrived here safely at ten o'clock on Sun- 
day morning, having had as good a passage as 
usual, though we ran aground and were de- 
tained a couple of hours in the Thames River, 
till the tide came to our relief. At length we 
curtseyed up to a wharf just the other side of 
their Castle Garden, very incurious about 
them and their city. I believe my vacant looks, 



*r.25.] TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER. 81 

absolutely inaccessible to questions, did at length 
satisfy an army of starving cabmen that I did 
not want a hack, cab, or anything of that sort 
as yet. It was the only demand the city made 
on us ; as if a wheeled vehicle of some sort were 
the sum and summit of a reasonable man's 
wants. " Having tried the water," they seemed 
to say, " will you not return to the pleasant se- 
curities of land carriage ? Else why your boat's 
prow turned toward the shore at last ? " They 
are a sad-looking set of fellows, not permitted 
to come on board, and I pitied them. They had 
been expecting me, it would seem, and did really 
wish that I should take a cab ; though they did 
not seem rich enough to supply me with one. 

It was a confused jumble of heads and soiled 
coats, dangling from flesh-colored faces, all 
swaying to and fro, as by a sort of undertow, 
while each whipstick, true as the needle to the 
pole, still preserved that level and direction in 
which its proprietor had dismissed his forlorn 
interrogatory. They took sight from them, 
the lash being wound up thereon, to prevent your 
attention from wandering x or to make it concen- 
tre upon its object by the spiral line. They be- 
gan at first, perhaps, with the modest, but rather 
confident inquiry, "Want a cab, sir?" but as 
their despair increased, it took the affirmative 
tone, as the disheartened and irresolute are apt 



82 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

to do : " You want a cab, sir," or even, " You 
want a nice cab, sir, to take you to Fourth 
Street." The question which one had bravely 
and hopefully begun to put, another had the 
tact to take up and conclude with fresh empha- 
sis, twirling it from his particular whipstick 
as if it had emanated from his lips as the sen- 
timent did from his heart. Each one could 
truly say, "Them 's my sentiments." But it was 
a sad sight. 

I am seven and a half miles from New York, 
and, as it would take half a day at least, have 
not been there yet. I have already run over no 
small part of the island, to the highest hill, and 
some way along the shore. From the hill di- 
rectly behind the house I can see New York, 
Brooklyn, Long Island, the Narrows, through 
which vessels bound to and from all parts of the 
world chiefly pass, Sandy Hook and the High- 
lands of Neversink (part of the coast of New 
Jersey) and, by going still farther up the 
hill, the Kill van Kull, and Newark Bay. From 
the pinnacle of one Madame Grimes' house, the 
other night at sunset, I could see almost round 
the island. Far in the horizon there was a fleet 
of sloops bound up the Hudson, which seemed 
to be going over the edge of the earth ; and in 
view of these trading ships, commerce seems 
quite imposing. 



*r.23.] TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER. 83 

But it is rather derogatory that your dwelling- 
place should be only a neighborhood to a great 
city, to live on an inclined plane. I do not like 
their cities and forts, with their morning and 
evening guns, and sails flapping in one's eye. I 
want a whole continent to breathe in, and a good 
deal of solitude and silence, such as all Wall 
Street cannot buy, nor Broadway with its 
wooden pavement. I must live along the beach, 
on the southern shore, which looks directly out 
to sea, and see what that great parade of water 
means, that dashes and roars, and has not yet 
wet me, as long as I have lived. 

I must not know anything about my condition 
and relations here till what is not permanent is 
worn off. I have not yet subsided. Give me 
time enough, and I may like it. All my inner 
man heretofore has been a Concord impression ; 
and here come these Sandy Hook and Coney 
Island breakers to meet and modify the former ; 
but it will be long before I can make nature 
look as innocently grand and inspiring as in 
Concord. Your affectionate son, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 



84 TEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT CONCORD). 

CASTLETON, Staten Island, May 22, 1843. 

DEAR SOPHIA, I have had a severe cold 
ever since I came here, and have been confined 
to the house for the last week with bronchitis, 
though I am now getting out, so I have not seen 
much in the botanical way. The cedar seems to 
be one of the most common trees here, and the 
fields are very fragrant with it. There are also 
the gum and tulip trees. The latter is not very 
common, but is very large and beautiful, having 
flowers as large as tulips, and as handsome. It 
is not time for it yet. 

The woods are now full of a large honeysuckle 
in full bloom, which differs from ours in being 
red instead of white, so that at first I did not 
know its genus. The painted cup is very com- 
mon in the meadows here. Peaches, and espe- 
cially cherries, seem to grow by all the fences. 
Things are very forward here compared with 
Concord. The apricots growing out of doors 
are already as large as plums. The apple, pear, 
peach, cherry, and plum trees have shed their 
blossoms. The whole island is like a garden, 
and affords very fine scenery. 

In front of the house is a very extensive wood, 
beyond which is the sea, whose roar I can hear 
all night long, when there is a wind ; if easterly 



jrr.25.] TO SOPHIA THOREAU. 85 

winds have prevailed on the Atlantic. There 
are always some vessels in sight ten, twenty, 
or thirty miles off and Sunday before last 
there were hundreds in long procession, stretch- 
ing from New York to Sandy Hook, and far 
beyond, for Sunday is a lucky day. 

I went to New York Saturday before last. A 
walk of half an hour, by half a dozen houses 
along the Richmond Koad, that is the road that 
leads to Richmond, on which we live, brings 
me to the village of Stapleton, in Southfield, 
where is the lower dock ; but if I prefer I can 
walk along the shore three quarters of a mile 
farther toward New York to the quarantine vil- 
lage of Castleton, to the upper dock, which the 
boat leaves five or six times every day, a quarter 
of an hour later than the former place. Farther 
on is the village of New Brighton, and farther 
still Port Richmond, which villages another 
steamboat visits. 

In New York I saw George Ward, and also 
Giles Waldo and William Tappan, whopi I can 
describe better when I have seen them more. 
They are young friends of Mr. Emerson. Waldo 
came down to the island to see me the next day. 
I also saw the Great Western, the Croton water 
works, and the picture gallery of the National 
Academy of Design. But I have not had time 
to see or do much yet 



86 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

Tell Miss Ward I shall try to put my micro- 
scope to a good use, and if I find any new and 
preservable flower, will throw it into my common- 
place book. Garlic, the original of the common 
onion, grows here all over the fields, and during 
its season spoils the cream and butter for the 
market, as the cows like it very much. 

Tell Helen there are two schools of late estab- 
lished in the neighborhood, with large prospects, 
or rather designs, one for boys and another for 
girls. The latter by a Miss Errington, and 
though it is only small as yet, I will keep my 
ears open for her in such directions. The en- 
couragement is very slight. 

I hope you will not be washed away by the 
Irish sea. 

Tell Mother I think my cold was not wholly 
owing to imprudence. Perhaps I was being 
acclimated. 

Tell Father that Mr. Tappan, whose son I 
know, and whose clerks young Tappan and 
Waldo are, has invented and established a 
new and very important business, which Waldo 
thinks would allow them to burn ninety-nine out 
of one hundred of the stores in New York, which 
now only offset and cancel one another. It is a 
kind of intelligence office for the whole country, 
with branches in the principal cities, giving 
information with regard to the credit and affairs 



r.23.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 87 

of every man of business of the country. Of 
course it is not popular at the South and West. 
It is an extensive business and will employ a 
great many clerks. 

Love to all not forgetting aunt and aunts 
and Miss and Mrs. Ward. 

On the 2f3d of May he wrote from Castleton 
to his sister Helen thus : 

DEAR HELEN, In place of something fresher, 
I send you the following verses from my Journal, 
written some time ago : 

Brother, where dost thou dwell ? 

What sun shines for thee now ? 
Dost thou indeed fare well 

As we wished here below ? 

What season didst thou find ? 

T was winter here. 
Are not the Fates more kind 

Than they appear ? 

Is thy brow clear again, 

As in thy youthful years ? 
And was that ugly pain 

The summit of thy fears ? l 

1 An allusion to the strange and painful death of John 
Thoreau, by lockjaw. lie had slightly wounded himself in 
shaving, and the cut became inflamed and brought on that 
hideous and deforming malady, of which, by sympathy, Ilenry 
also partook, though he recovered. 



88 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

Yet thou wast cheery still ; 

They could not quench thy fire ; 
Thou didst abide their will, 

And then retire. 

Where chiefly shall I look 

To feel thy presence near ? 
Along the neighboring brook 

May I thy voice still hear ? 

Dost thou still haunt the brink 

Of yonder river's tide ? 
And may I ever think 

That thou art by my side ? 

What bird wilt thou employ 

To bring me word of thee ? 
For it would give them joy, 

'T would give them liberty, 
To serve their former lord 

With wing and minstrelsy. 

A sadder strain mixed with their song, 
They 've slowlier built their nests ; 

Since thon art gone 

Their lively labor rests. 

Where is the finch, the thrush 

I used to hear ? 
Ah, they could well abide 

The dying year. 

Now they no more return, 

I hear them not ; 
They have remained to mourn ; 

Or else forgot. 



r.25.] TO MRS. EMERSON. 89 

As the first letter of Thoreau to Emerson was 
to thank him for his lofty friendship, so now the 
first letter to Mrs. Emerson, after leaving her 
house, was to say similar things, with a passing 
allusion to her love of flowers and of gardening, in 
which she surpassed all his acquaintance in Con- 
cord, then and afterward. A letter to Emerson 
followed, touching on the " Dial " and on several 
of his new and old acquaintance. "Rockwood 
Hoar " is the person since known as judge and 
cabinet officer, the brother of Senator Hoar, 
and of Thoreau's special friends, Elizabeth and 
Edward Hoar. Channing is the poet, who had 
lately printed his first volume, without finding 
many readers. 

TO MRS. EMERSON (AT COXCORD). 

CAUTLETON, Staten Island, May 22, 1843. 

Mr DEAR FRIEND, I believe a good many 
conversations with you were left in an unfinished 
state, and now indeed I don't know where to 
take them up. But I will resume some of the 
unfinished silence. I shall not hesitate to know 
you. I think of you as some elder sister of 
mine, whom I could not have avoided, a sort 
of lunar influence, only of such age as the 
moon, whose time is measured by her light. You 
must know that you represent to me woman, for 
I have not traveled very far or wide, and what 



90 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

if I had ? I like to deal with you, for I believe 
you do not lie or steal, and these are very rare 
virtues. I thank you for your influence for two 
years. I was fortunate to be subjected to it, and 
am now to remember it. It is the noblest gift 
we can make ; what signify all others that can 
be bestowed ? You have helped to keep my life 
" on loft," as Chaucer says of Griselda, and in a 
better sense. You always seemed to look down 
at me as from some elevation some of your 
high humilities and I was the better for hav- 
ing to look up. I felt taxed not to disappoint 
your expectation ; for could there be any acci- 
dent so sad as to be respected for something bet- 
ter than we are ? It was a pleasure even to go 
away from you, as it is not to meet some, as it 
apprised me of my high relations ; and such a 
departure is a sort of further introduction and 
meeting. Nothing makes the earth seem so spa- 
cious as to have friends at a distance ; they make 
the latitudes and longitudes. 

You must not think that fate is so dark there, 
for even here I can see a faint reflected light 
over Concord, and I think that at this distance I 
can better weigh the value of a doubt there. 
Your moonlight, as I have told you, though it is 
a reflection of the sun, allows of bats and owls 
and other twilight birds to flit therein. But I 
am very glad that you can elevate your life with 



*T.25.] TO MRS. EMERSON. 91 

a doubt, for I am sure that it is nothing but an 
insatiable faith after all that deepens and dark- 
ens its current. And your doubt and my confi- 
dence are only a difference of expression. 

I have hardly begun to live on Staten Island 
yet ; but, like the man who, when forbidden to 
tread on English ground, carried Scottish ground 
in his boots, I carry Concord ground in my boots 
and in my hat, and am I not made of Concord 
dust ? I cannot realize that it is the roar of the 
sea I hear now, and not the wind in Walden 
woods. I find more of Concord, after all, in the 
prospect of the sea, beyond Sandy Hook, than in 
the fields and woods. 

If you were to have this Hugh the gardener 
for your man, you would think a new dispensa- 
tion had commenced. He might put a fairer 
aspect on the natural world for you, or at any 
rate a screen between you and the almshouse. 
There is a beautiful red honeysuckle now in 
blossom in the woods here, which should be 
transplanted to Concord ; and if what they tell 
me about the tulip-tree be true, you should have 
that also. I have not seen Mrs. Black yet, but 
I intend to call on her soon. Have you estab- 
lished those simpler modes of living yet ? " In 
the full tide of successful operation 7 " 

Tell Mrs. Brown that I hope she is anchored 
in a secure haven and derives much pleasure

still from reading the poets, and that her con- 
stellation is not quite set from my sight, though 
it is sunk so low in that northern horizon. Tell 
Elizabeth Hoar that her bright present did 
" carry ink safely to Staten Island," and was a 
conspicuous object in Master Haven's inventory 
of my effects. Give my respects to Madam 
Emerson, whose Concord face I should be glad 
to see here this summer ; and remember me to 
the rest of the household who have had vision of 
me. Shake a day-day to Edith, and say good 
night to Ellen for me. Farewell. 

TO B. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD). 

CASTLETON, STATEN ISLAND, May 23. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I was just going to write 
to you when I received your letter. I was wait- 
ing till I had got away from Concord. I should 
have sent you something for the " Dial " before, 
but I have been sick ever since I came here, 
rather unaccountably, what with a cold, bron- 
chitis, acclimation, etc., still unaccountably. I 
send you some verses from my journal which 
will help make a packet. I have not time to 
correct them, if this goes by Rockwood Hoar. 
If I can finish an account of a winter's walk in 
Concord, in the midst of a Staten Island sum- 
mer, not so wise as true, I trust, I will send 
it to you soon.

I have had no later experiences yet. You 
must not count much upon what I can do or 
learn in New York. I feel a good way off here ; 
and it is not to be visited, but seen and dwelt in. 
I have been there but once, and have been con- 
fined to the house since. Everything there dis- 
appoints me but the crowd ; rather, I was dis- 
appointed with the rest before I came. I have 
no eyes for their churches, and what else they 
find to brag of. Though I know but little about 
Boston, yet what attracts me, in a quiet way, 
seems much meaner and more pretending than 
there, libraries, pictures, and faces in the 
street. You don't know where any respecta- 
bility inhabits. It is in the crowd in Chatham 
Street. The crowd is something new, and to be 
attended to. It is worth a thousand Trinity 
Churches and Exchanges while it is looking 
at them, and will run over them and trample 
them under foot one day. There are two things 
I hear and am aware I live in the neighborhood 
of, the roar of the sea and the hum of the 
city. I have just come from the beach (to find 
your letter), and I like it much. Everything 
there is on a grand and generous scale, sea- 
weed, water, and sand ; and even the dead fishes, 
horses, and hogs have a rank, luxuriant odor ; 
great shad-nets spread to dry ; crabs and horse- 
shoes crawling over the sand ; clumsy boats, only

for service, dancing like sea-fowl over the surf, 
and ships afar off going about their business. 

Waldo and Tappan carried me to their Eng- 
lish alehouse the first Saturday, and Waldo 
spent two hours here the next day. But Tap- 
pan I have only seen. I like his looks and the 
sound of his silence. They are confined every 
day but Sunday, and then Tappan is obliged to 
observe the demeanor of a church-goer to pre- 
vent open war with his father. 

I am glad that Channing has got settled, and 
that, too, before the inroad of the Irish. I have 
read his poems two or three times over, and par- 
tially through and under, with new and increased 
interest and appreciation. Tell him I saw a 
man buy a copy at Little & Brown's. He may 
have been a virtuoso, but we will give him the 
credit. What with Alcott and Lane and Haw- 
thorne, too, you look strong enough to take New 
York by storm. Will you tell L., if he asks, 
that I have been able to do nothing about the 
books yet ? 

Believe that I have something better to write 
you than this. It would be unkind to thank you 
for particular deeds.

TO E. W. EMERSOX (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, Jane 3, 1843. 
DEAR FRIEND, I have been to see Henry 
James, and like him very much. It was a great 
pleasure to meet him. It makes humanity seem 
more erect and respectable. I never was more 
kindly and faithfully catechised. It made me 
respect myself more to be thought worthy of 
such wise questions. He is a man, and takes 
his own way, or stands still in his own place. 
I know of no one so patient and determined to 
have the good of you. It is almost friendship, 
such plain and human dealing. I think that he 
will not write or speak inspiringly ; but he is a 
refreshing, forward-looking and forward-moving 
man, and he has naturalized and humanized New 
York for me. He actually reproaches you by 
his respect for your poor words. I had three 
hours' solid talk with him, and he asks me to 
make free use of his house. He wants an ex- 
pression of your faith, or to be sure that it is 
faith, and confesses that his own treads fast upon 
the neck of his understanding. He exclaimed, 
at some careless answer of mine, " Well, you 
Transcendentalists are wonderfully consistent. I 
must get hold of this somehow ! " He likes Car- 
lyle's book, 1 but says that it leaves him in an

excited and unprofitable state, and that Carlyle 
is so ready to obey his humor that he makes the 
least vestige of truth the foundation of any su- 
perstructure, not keeping faith with his better 
genius nor truest readers. 

I met Wright on the stairs of the Society 
Library, and W. H. Channing and Brisbane on 
the steps. The former (Channing) is a concave 
man, and you see by his attitude and the lines 
of his face that he is retreating from himself and 
from yourself, with sad doubts. It is like a fair 
mask swaying from the drooping boughs of some 
tree whose stem is not seen. He would break 
with a conchoidal fracture. You feel as if you 
would like to see him when he has made up his 
mind to run all the risks. To be sure, he doubts 
because he has a great hope to be disappointed, 
but he makes the possible disappointment of too 
much consequence. Brisbane, with whom I did 
not converse, did not impress me favorably. He 
looks like a man who has lived in a cellar, far 
gone in consumption. I barely saw him, but he 
did not look as if he could let Fourier go, in any 
case, and throw up his hat. But I need not 
have come to New York to write this. 

I have seen Tappan for two or three hours, 
and like both him and Waldo ; but I always see 
those of whom I have heard well with a slight 
disappointment. They are so much better than 



r.25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 97 

the great herd, and yet the heavens are not 
shivered into diamonds over their heads. Per- 
sons and things flit so rapidly through my brain 
nowadays that I can hardly remember them. 
They seem to be lying in the stream, stemming 
the tide, ready to go to sea, as steamboats when 
they leave the dock go off in the opposite direc- 
tion first, until they are headed right, and then 
begins the steady revolution of the paddle- 
wheels ; and they are not quite cheerily headed 
anywhither yet, nor singing amid the shrouds 
as they bound over the billows. There is a cer- 
tain youthfulness and generosity about them, 
very attractive ; and Tappan's more reserved 
and solitary thought commands respect. 

After some ado, I discovered the residence of 
Mrs. Black, but there was palmed off on me, in 
her stead, a Mrs. Grey (quite an inferior color), 
who told me at last that she was not Mrs. Black, 
but her mother, and was just as glad to see me 
as Mrs. Black would have been, and so, for- 
sooth, would answer just as well. Mrs. Black 
had gone with Edward Palmer to New Jersey, 
and would return on the morrow. 

I don't like the city better, the more I see it, 
but worse. I am ashamed of my eyes that be- 
hold it. It is a thousand times meaner than I 
could have imagined. It will be something to 
hate, that ' the advantage it will be to me : 



98 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

and even the best people in it are a part of it, 
ancl talk coolly about it. The pigs in the street 
are the most respectable part of the population. 
When will the world learn that a million men 
are of no importance compared with one man ? 
But I must wait for a shower of shillings, or at 
least a slight dew or mizzling of sixpences, be- 
fore I explore New York very far. 

The sea-beach is the best thing I have seen. 
It is very solitary and remote, and you only re- 
member New York occasionally. The distances, 
too, along the shore, and inland in sight of it, 
are unaccountably great and startling. The sea 
seems very near from the hills, but it proves a 
long way over the plain, and yet you may be 
wet with the spray before you can believe that 
you are there. The far seems near, and the 
near far. Many rods from the beach, I step 
aside for the Atlantic, and I see men drag up 
their boats on to the sand, with oxen, stepping 
about amid the surf, as if it were possible they 
might draw up Sandy Hook. 

I do not feel myself especially serviceable to 
the good people with whom I live, except as in- 
flictions are sanctified to the righteous. And so, 
too, must I serve the boy. I can look to the 
Latin and mathematics sharply, and for the rest 
behave myself. But I cannot be in his neigh- 
borhood hereafter as his Educator, of course, but

as the hawks fly over my own head. I am not 
attracted toward him but as to youth generally. 
He shall frequent me, however, as much as he 
can, and I '11 be I. 

Bradbury 1 told me, when I passed through 
Boston, that he was coming to New York the 
following Saturday, and would then settle with 
me, but he has not made his appearance yet. 
Will you, the next time you go to Boston, pre- 
sent that order for me which I left with you? 

If I say less about Waldo and Tappan now, 
it is, perhaps, because I may have more to say 
by and by. Remember me to your mother and 
Mrs. Emerson, who, I hope, is quite well. I 
shall be very glad to hear from her, as well as 
from you. I have very hastily written out 
something for the " Dial," and send it only be- 
cause you are expecting something, though 
something better. It seems idle and Howittish, 
but it may be of more worth in Concord, where 
it belongs. In great haste. Farewell.

which had taken Nathan Hale's Boston Miscellany off his 
hands, and hod published in it, with promise of payment, Tho- 
reau's Walk to Wachusrtt. But much time had passed, and 
the debt was not paid ; hence the lack of a "shower of shil- 
lings" which the letter laments. Emerson's reply gives the 
first news of the actual bc^iiiniiiK of Alcott's short-lived para- 
dise at Fruitlandft, and dwells with interest on the affairs of 
the rural and lettered circle at Concord.

TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER (AT CONCORD). 
CASTLETON, June 8, 1843. 

DEAR PARENTS, I have got quite well now, 
and like the lay of the land and the look of the 
sea very much, only the country is so fair 
that it seems rather too much as if it were made 
to be looked at. I have been to New York four 
or five times, and have run about the island a 
good deal. 

George Ward, when I last saw him, which 
was at his house in Brooklyn, was studying the 
Daguerreotype process, preparing to set up in 
that line. The boats run now almost every hour 
from 8 A. M. to 7 P. M., back and forth, so that 
I can get to the city much more easily than 
before. I have seen there one Henry James, a 
lame man, of whom I had heard before, whom I 
like very much ; and he asks me to make free 
use of his house, which is situated in a pleasant 
part of the city, adjoining the University. I 
have met several people whom I knew before, 
and among the rest Mr. Wright, who was on his 
way to Niagara. 

I feel already about as well acquainted with 
New York as with Boston, that is, about as 
little, perhaps. It is large enough now, and 
they intend it shall be larger still. Fifteenth 
Street, where some of my new acquaintance live, 



jn-,25.] TO HIS FATHER AND MOTHER. 101 

is two or three miles from the Battery, where 
the boat touches, clear brick and stone, and 
no " give " to the foot ; and they have laid out, 
though not built, up to the 149th street above. 
I had rather see a brick for a specimen, for my 
part, such as they exhibited in old times. You 
see it is " quite a day's training " to make a few 
calls in different parts of the city (to say no- 
thing of twelve miles by water and land, i. e., 
not brick and stone), especially if it does not 
rain shillings, which might interest omnibuses 
in your behalf. Some omnibuses are marked 
" Broadway Fourth Street," and they go no 
farther ; others " Eighth Street," and so on, 
and so of the other principal streets. (This let- 
ter will be circumstantial enough for Helen.) 

This is in all respects a very pleasant resi- 
dence, much more rural than you would ex- 
pect of the vicinity of New York. There are 
woods all around. We breakfast at half past 
six, lunch, if we will, at twelve, and dine or sup 
at five ; thus is the day partitioned off. From 
nine to two, or thereabouts, I am the schoolmas- 
ter, and at other times as much the pupil as I 
can be. Mr. and Mrs. Emerson are not indeed 
of my kith or kin in any sense ; but they are ir- 
reproachable and kind. I have met no one yet 
on the inland whose acquaintance 1 shall culti- 
vate or hoe round unless it be our neighbor,

Captain Smith, an old fisherman, who catches 
the fish called "moss-bonkers" so it sounds 
and invites me to come to the beach, where he 
spends the week, and see him and his fish. 

Farms are for sale all around here, and so, I 
suppose men are for purchase. North of us live 
Peter Wandell, Mr. Mell, and Mr. Disosway 
(don't mind the spelling), as far as the Clove 
road; and south, John Britton, Van Pelt, and 
Captain Smith, as far as the Fingerboard road. 
Behind is the hill, some 250 feet high, on the 
side of which we live ; and in front the forest 
.and the sea, the latter at the distance of a 
mile and a half. 

Tell Helen that Miss Errington is provided 
with assistance. This were a good place as any 
to establish a school, if one could wait a little. 
Families come down here to board in the sum- 
mer, and three or four have been already estab- 
lished this season. 

As for money matters, I have not set my 
traps yet, but I am getting my bait ready. 
Pray, how does the garden thrive, and what 
improvements in the pencil line? I miss you 
all very much. Write soon, and send a Concord 
paper to 

Your affectionate son, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 



jsr.25.] TO MRS. EMERSON. 103 

The traps of this sportsman were magazine 
articles, but the magazines that would pay 
much for papers were very few in 1843. One 
such had existed in Boston for a short time, 
the " Miscellany," and it printed a good paper 
of Thoreau's, but the pay was not forthcoming. 
His efforts to find publishers more liberal in 
New York were not successful. But he contin- 
ued to write for fame in the " Dial," and helped 
to edit that. 

TO MRS. EMERSON. 

STATEN ISLAND, June 20, 1843. 

MY VERY DEAR FRIEND, I have only read 
a page of your letter, and have come out to the 
top of the hill at sunset, where I can see the 
ocean, to prepare to read the rest. It is fitter 
that it should hear it than the walls of my cham- 
ber. The very crickets here seem to chirp around 
me as they did not before. I feel as if it were 
a great daring to go on and read the rest, and 
then to live accordingly. There are more than 
thirty vessels in sight going to sea. I am almost 
afniid to look at your letter. I see that it will 
make my life very steep, but it may lead to fairer 
prospects than this. 

You seem to me to speak out of a very clear 
and high heaven, where any one may be who 
stands so high. Your voice seems not a voice, 



104 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

but comes as much from the blue heavens as 
from the paper. 

My dear friend, it was very noble in you to 
write me so trustful an answer. It will do as 
well for another world as for this ; such a voice 
is for no particular time nor person, but it makes 
him who may hear it stand for all that is lofty 
and true in humanity. The thought of you will 
constantly elevate my life ; it will be something 
always above the horizon to behold, as when I 
look up at the evening star. I think I know 
your thoughts without seeing you, and as well 
here as in Concord. You are not at all strange 
to me. 

I could hardly believe, after the lapse of one 
night, that I had such a noble letter still at hand 
to read, that it was not some fine dream. I 
looked at midnight to be sure that it was real. 
I feel that I am unworthy to know you, and yet 
they will not permit it wrongfully. 

I, perhaps, am more willing to deceive by 
appearances than you say you are ; it would not 
be worth the while to tell how willing; but I 
have the power perhaps too much to forget my 
meanness as soon as seen, and not be incited by 
permanent sorrow. My actual life is unspeak- 
ably mean compared with what I know and see 
that it might be. Yet the ground from which I 
see and say this is some part of it. It ranges 



jrr.25.] TO MRS. EMERSOk. 105 

from heaven to earth, and is all things in an 
hour. The experience of every past moment 
but belies the faith of each present. We never 
conceive the greatness of our fates. Are not 
these faint flashes of light which sometimes 
obscure the sun their certain dawn? 

My friend, I have read your letter as if I was 
not reading it. After each pause I could defer 
the rest forever. The thought of you will be a 
new motive for every right action. You are 
another human being whom I know, and might 
not our topic be as broad as the universe? 
What have we to do with petty rumbling news ? 
We have our own great affairs. Sometimes in 
Concord I found my actions dictated, as it were, 
by your influence, and though it led almost to 
trivial Hindoo observances, yet it was good and 
elevating. To hear that you have sad hours is 
not sad to me. I rather rejoice at the richness 
of your experience. Only think of some sad- 
ness away in Pekin, unseen and unknown 
there. What a mine it is ! Would it not 
weigh down the Celestial Empire, with all its 
gay Chinese ? Our sadness is not sad, but our 
cheap joys. Let us be sail about all we see and 
are, for so we demand and pray for better. It 
is the constant prayer and whole Christian re- 
ligion. I could hope that you would get well 
soon, and have a healthy body for this world. 



106 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

but I know this cannot be ; and the Fates, after 
all, are the accomplishes of our hopes. Yet I 
do hope that you may find it a worthy struggle, 
and life seem grand still through the clouds. 

What wealth is it to have such friends that we 
cannot think of them without elevation ! And 
we can think of them any time and anywhere, 
and it costs nothing but the lofty disposition. I 
cannot tell you the joy your letter gives me, which 
will not quite cease till the latest time. Let me 
accompany your finest thought. 

I send my love to my other friend and brother, 
whose nobleness I slowly recognize. 

HENRY. 

TO MRS. THOREAU (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, July 7, 1843. 

DEAR MOTHER, I was very glad to get your 
letter and papers. Tell father that circumstan- 
tial letters make very substantial reading, at any 
rate. I like to know even how the sun shines 
and garden grows with you. I did not get my 
money in Boston, and probably shall not at all. 
Tell Sophia that I have pressed some blossoms 
of the tulip-tree for her. They look somewhat 
like white lilies. The magnolia, too, is in blossom 
here. 

Pray, have you the seventeen-year locust in 
Concord ? The air here is filled with their din. 



*r.25.] TO MRS. THOREAU. 107 

They come out of the ground at first in an imper- 
fect state, and, crawling up the shrubs and plants, 
the perfect insect bursts out through the back. 
They are doing great damage to the fruit and 
forest trees. The latter are covered with dead 
twigs, which in the distance look like the blos- 
soms of the chestnut. They bore every twig of 
last year's growth in order to deposit their eggs 
in it. In a few weeks the eggs will be hatched, 
and the worms fall to the ground and enter it, 
and in 1860 make their appearance again. I 
conversed about their coming this season before 
they arrived. They do no injury to the leaves, 
but, beside boring the twigs, suck their sap for 
sustenance. Their din is heard by those who 
sail along the shore from the distant woods, 
Phar-r-r-aoh. Phar-r-r-aoh. They are departing 
now. Dogs, cats, and chickens subsist mainly 
upon them in some places. 

I have not been to New York for more than 
three weeks. I have had an interesting letter 
from Mr. Lane, 1 describing their new prospects. 
My pupil and I are getting on apace. He is 
remarkably well advanced in Latin, and is well 
advancing. 

Your letter has just arrived. I was not aware 
that it was so long since I wrote home ; I only

knew that I had sent five or six letters to the 
town. It is very refreshing to hear from you, 
though it is not all good news. But I trust that 
Stearns Wheeler is not dead. I should be slow 
to believe it. He was made to work very well 
in this world. There need be no tragedy in his 
death. 

The demon which is said to haunt the Jones 
family, hovering over their eyelids with wings 
steeped in juice of poppies, has commenced an- 
other campaign against me. I am " clear Joues " 
in this respect at least. But he finds little encour- 
agement in my atmosphere, I assure you, for I 
do not once fairly lose myself, except in those 
hours of truce allotted to rest by immemorial 
custom. However, this skirmishing interferes 
sadly with my literary projects, and I am apt to 
think it a good day's work if I maintain a sol- 
dier's eye till nightfall. Very well, it does not 
matter much in what wars we serve, whether in 
the Highlands or the Lowlands. Everywhere 
we get soldiers' pay still. 

Give my love to Aunt Louisa, whose benig- 
nant face I sometimes see right in the wall, as 
naturally and necessarily shining on my path as 
some star of unaccountably greater age and 
higher orbit than myself. Let it be inquired 
by her of George Minott, as from me, for she 
sees him, if he has seen any pigeons yet, and 



*r.25.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 109 

tell him there are plenty of jack-snipes here. As 
for William P., the " worthy young man," as 
I live, my eyes have not fallen on him yet. 

I have not had the influenza, though here are 
its headquarters, unless my first week's cold 
was it. Tell Helen I shall write to her soon. I 
have heard Lucretia Mott. This is badly writ- 
ten ; but the worse the writing the sooner you 
get it this time from

TO B. W. EMERSOX (AT COXCOKD). 

STATEN ISLAND, July 8, 1843. 

DEAR FRIENDS, I was very glad to hear 
your voices from so far. I do not believe there 
are eight hundred human beings on the globe. 
It is all a fable, and I cannot but think that you 
speak with a slight outrage and disrespect of 
Concord when you talk of fifty of them. There 
are not so many. Yet think not that I have left 
all behind, for already I begin to track my way 
over the earth, and find the cope of heaven ex- 
tending beyond its horizon, forsooth, like the 
roofs of these Dutch houses. My thoughts re- 
vert to those dear lulls and that river which so 
fills up the world to its brim, worthy to be 
named with Mincius and Alpheus, still drink- 
ing its meadows while I am far away. How can

it run heedless to the sea, as if I were there to 
countenance it? George Minott, too, looms up 
considerably, and many another old familiar 
face. These things all look sober and respecta- 
ble. They are better than the environs of New 
York, I assure you. 

I am pleased to think of Channing as an in- 
habitant of the gray town. Seven cities con- 
tended for Homer dead. Tell him to remain at 
least long enough to establish Concord's right 
and interest in him. I was beginning to know 
the man. In imagination I see you pilgrims 
taking your way by the red lodge and the cabin 
of the brave farmer man, so youthful and hale, 
to the still cheerful woods. And Hawthorne, 
too, I remember as one with whom I sauntered, 
in old heroic times, along the banks of the Sca- 
mander, amid the ruins of chariots and heroes. 
Tell him not to desert, even after the tenth year. 
Others may say, " Are there not the cities of 
Asia ? " But what are they ? Staying at home 
is the heavenly way. 

And Elizabeth Hoar, my brave townswoman, 
to be sung of poets, if I may speak of her 
whom I do not know. Tell Mrs. Brown that I 
do not forget her, going her way under the stars 
through this chilly world, I did not think of 
the wind, and that I went a little way with 
her. Tell her not to despair. Concord's little

arch does not span all our fate, nor is what 
transpires under it law for the universe. 

And least of all are forgotten those walks in 
the woods in ancient days, too sacred to be 
idly remembered, when their aisles were per- 
vaded as by a fragrant atmosphere. They still 
seem youthful and cheery to my imagination as 
Sherwood and Barnsdale, and of far purer 
fame. Those afternoons when we wandered o'er 
Olympus, and those hills, from which the sun 
was seen to set, while still our day held on its 
way. 

" At last he rose and twitched his mantle blue ; 
To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new." 

I remember these things at midnight, at rare 
intervals. But know, my friends, that I a good 
deal hate you all in my most private thoughts, 
as the substratum of the little love I bear you. 
Though you are a rare band, and do not make 
half use enough of one another. 

I think this is a noble number of the " Dial." l 
It perspires thought and feeling. 1 can speak 
of it now a little like a foreigner. Be assured 
that it is not written in vain, it is not for me. 
I hear its prose and its verse. They provoke 

1 Emerson also was satisfied with it for once, and wrote to 
Thoreau : " Our Dial thrives well enough in these weeks. I 
print W. . Channing's ' Letters,' or the first ones, but he doc* 
not care to have them named as his for a while. They are 
rery agreeable reading." 



112 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

and inspire me, and they have my sympathy. I 
hear the sober and the earnest, the sad and the 
cheery voices of my friends, and to me it is a 
long letter of encouragement and reproof ; and 
no doubt so it is to many another in the land. 
So don't give up the ship. Methinks the verse 
is hardly enough better than the prose. I give 
my vote for the Notes from the Journal of a 
Scholar, and wonder you don't print them faster. 
I want, too, to read the rest of the " Poet and 
the Painter." Miss Fuller's is a noble piece, 
rich, extempore writing, talking with pen in 
hand. It is too good not to be better, even. In 
writing, conversation should be folded many 
times thick. It is the height of art that, on the 
first perusal, plain common sense should appear ; 
on the second, severe truth ; and on a third, 
beauty ; and, having these warrants for its depth 
and reality, we may then enjoy the beauty for 
evermore. The sea-piece is of the best that is 
going, if not of the best that is staying. You 
have spoken a good word for Carlyle. As for 
the " Winter's Walk," I should be glad to have 
it printed in the " Dial " if you think it good 
enough, and will criticise it ; otherwise send it 
to me, and I will dispose of it. 

I have not been to New York for a month, 
and so have not seen Waldo and Tappan. James 
has been at Albany meanwhile. You will know

that I only describe my personal adventures with 
people ; but I hope to see more of them, and 
judge them too. I am sorry to learn that Mrs. 
Emerson is no better. But let her know that 
the Fates pay a compliment to those whom they 
make sick, and they have not to ask, " What have 
I done?" 

Remember me to your mother, and remember 
me yourself as you are remembered by 

H. D. T. 

I had a friendly and cheery letter from Lane 
a month ago. 

TO HELEN THOREAU (AT ROXBUBY). 

STATEN ISLAND, .Inly 21, 1843. 

DEAR HELEN, I am not in such haste to 
write home when I remember that I make my 
readers pay the postage. But I believe I have 
not taxed you before. 

I have pretty much explored this island, in- 
land, and along the shore, finding my health 
inclined me to the peripatetic philosophy. I 
have visited telograph stations, Sailors' Snug 
Harbors, Seaman's Retreats, Old Elm-Trees, 
where the Huguenots landed, Britton's Mills, 
and all the villages on the island. Last Sunday 
I walked over to Lake Island Farm, eight or 
nine miles from here, where Moses Prichard 



114 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

lived, and found the present occupant, one Mr. 
Davenport, formerly from Massachusetts, with 
three or four men to help him, raising sweet 
potatoes and tomatoes by the acre. It seemed a 
cool and pleasant retreat, but a hungry soil. As 
I was coming away, I took my toll out of the 
soil in the shape of arrow-heads, which may after 
all be the surest crop, certainly not affected by 
drought. 

I am well enough situated here to observe one 
aspect of the modern world at least. I mean 
the migratory, the Western movement. Six- 
teen hundred immigrants arrived at quarantine 
ground on the 4th of July, and more or less 
every day since I have been here. I see them 
occasionally washing their persons and clothes : 
or men, women, and children gathered on an 
isolated quay near the shore, stretching their 
limbs and taking the air ; the children running 
races and swinging on this artificial piece of the 
land of liberty, while their vessels are under- 
going purification. They are detained but a 
day or two, and then go up to the city, for the 
most part without having landed here. 

In the city, I have seen, since I wrote last, 
W. H. Channing, at whose home, in Fifteenth 
Street, I spent a few pleasant hours, discussing 
the all-absorbing question " what to do for the 
race." (He is sadly in earnest about going up 



*r.26.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 115 

the river to rusticate for six weeks, and issues a 
new periodical called " The Present " in Sep- 
tember.) Also Horace Greeley, editor of the 
" Tribune," who is cheerfully in earnest, at his 
office of all work, a hearty New Hampshire boy 
as one would wish to meet, and says, " Now be 
neighborly," and believes only, or mainly, first, 
in the Sylvania Association, somewhere in Penn- 
sylvania ; and, secondly, and most of all, in a 
new association to go into operation soon in New 
Jersey, with which he is connected. Edward 
Palmer came down to see me Sunday before 
last. As for Waldo and Tappan, we have 
strangely dodged one another, and have not met 
for some weeks. 

I believe I have not told you anything about 
Lucretia Mott. It was a good while ago that 
I heard her at the Quaker Church in Hester 
Street. She is a preacher, and it was adver- 
tised that she would be present on that day. I 
likt-d all the proceedings very well, their plainly 
greater harmony and sincerity than elsewhere. 
They do nothing in a hurry. Every one that 
walks up the aisle in his square coat and ex- 
pansive hat has a history, and comes from a 
house to a house. The women come in one after 
another in their Quaker bonnets and handker- 
chiefs, looking all liki- si>t<-r.s or so nnny chick- 
adees. At length, after a long silence wait- 



116 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

ing for the Spirit Mrs. Mott rose, took off 
her bonnet, and began to utter very deliberately 
what the Spirit suggested. Her self-possession 
was something to see, if all else failed ; but it 
did not. Her subject was, " The Abuse of the 
Bible," and thence she straightway digressed to 
slavery and the degradation of woman. It was 
a good speech, transcendentalism in its mild- 
est form. She sat down at length, and, after a 
long and decorous silence, in which some seemed 
to be really digesting her words, the elders shook 
hands, and the meeting dispersed. On the whole, 
I liked their ways and the plainness of their 
meeting-house. It looked as if it was indeed 
made for service. 

I think that Stearns Wheeler has left a gap 
in the community not easy to be filled. Though 
he did not exhibit the highest qualities of the 
scholar, he promised, in a remarkable degree, 
many of the essential and rarer ones ; and his 
patient industry and energy, his reverent love 
of letters, and his proverbial accuracy, will cause 
him to be associated in my memory even with 
many venerable names of former days. It was 
not wholly unfit that so pure a lover of books 
should have ended his pilgrimage at the great 
book-mart of the world. I think of him as 
healthy and brave, and am confident that if he 
had lived, he would have proved useful in more 



r.2G.] TO MRS. THOREAU. 117 

ways than I can describe. He would have been 
authority on all matters of fact, and a sort of 
connecting link between men and scholars of 
different walks and tastes. The literary enter- 
prises he was planning for himself and friends 
remind me of an older and more studious time. 
So much, then, remains for us to do who sur- 
vive. Love to all. Tell all my friends in Con- 
cord that I do not send my love, but retain it 
still. 

Your affectionate brother. 

TO MBS. THOREAU (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, August 6, 1843. 

DEAR MOTHER, As Mr. William Emerson 
is going to Concord on Tuesday, I must not omit 
sending a line by him, though I wish I had 
something more weighty for so direct a post. I 
believe I directed my last letter to you by mis- 
take; but it must have appeared that it was 
addressed to Helen. At any rate, this is to you 
without mistake. 

I am chiefly indebted to your letters for what 
I have learned of Concord and family news, and 
am very glad when I get one. I should have 
liked to be in Walden woods with you, but not 
with the railroad. I think of you all very 
often, and wonder if you are still separated 
from me only by so many miles of earth, or 



118 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

so many miles of memory. This life we live 
is a strange dream, and I don't believe at 
all any account men give of it. Methinks I 
should be content to sit at the back-door in Con- 
cord, under the poplar-tree, henceforth forever. 
Not that I am homesick at all, for places are 
strangely indifferent to me, but Concord is 
still a cynosure to my eyes, and I find it hard 
to attach it, even in imagination, to the rest of 
the globe, and tell where the seam is. 

I fancy that this Sunday evening you are 
poring over some select book, almost transcen- 
dental perchance, or else " Burgh's Dignity," 
or Massillon, or the " Christian Examiner." 
Father has just taken one more look at the gar- 
den, and is now absorbed in Chaptelle, or read- 
ing the newspaper quite abstractedly, only look- 
ing up occasionally over his spectacles to see 
how the rest are engaged, and not to miss any 
newer news that may not be in the paper. Helen 
has slipped in for the fourth time to learn the 
very latest item. Sophia, I suppose, is at Ban- 
gor ; but Aunt Louisa, without doubt, is just 
flitting away to some good meeting, to save the 
credit of you all. 

It is still a cardinal virtue with me to keep 
awake. I find it impossible to write or read 
except at rare intervals, but am, generally speak- 
ing, tougher than formerly. I could make a 



T.26.] TO MRS. THOREAU. 119 

pedestrian tour round the world, and sometimes 
think it would perhaps be better to do at once 
the things I can, rather than be trying to do 
what at present I cannot do well. However, I 
shall awake sooner or later. 

I have been translating some Greek, and 
reading English poetry, and a month ago sent a 
paper to the " Democratic Review," which, at 
length, they were sorry they could not accept ; 
but they could not adopt the sentiments. How- 
ever, they were very polite, and earnest that I 
should send them something else, or reform 
that. 

I go moping about the fields and woods here 
as I did in Concord, and, it seems, am thought 
to be a surveyor, an Eastern man inquiring 
narrowly into the condition and value of land, 
etc., here, preparatory to an extensive specula- 
tion. One neighbor observed to me, in a mys- 
terious and half inquisitive way, that he sup- 
posed I must be pretty well acquainted with the 
state of things ; tliat I kept pretty close ; he 
did n't see any surveying instruments, but per- 
haps I had them in my pock< t. 

I have received Helen's note, but have not 
heard of Frisbie Hoar yet. 1 She is a faint- 
hearted writer, who could not take the res|x>nsi- 

1 At premnt Senator Hoar of Massachusetts, but then in 
Harvard College. 



120 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

bility of blotting one sheet alone. However, I 
like very well the blottings I get. Tell her I 
have not seen Mrs. Child nor Mrs. Sedgwick. 
Love to all from your affectionate son. 

TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, August 7, 1843. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I fear I have nothing 
to send you worthy of so good an opportunity. 
Of New York I still know but little, though 
out of so many thousands there are no doubt 
many units whom it would be worth my while 
to know. Mr. James 1 talks of going to Ger- 
many soon with his wife to learn the language. 
He says he must know it ; can never learn it 
here ; there he may absorb it ; and is very anxious 
to learn beforehand where he had best locate 
himself to enjoy the advantage of the highest 
culture, learn the language in its purity, and not 
exceed his limited means. I referred him to 
Longfellow. Perhaps you can help him. 

I have had a pleasant talk with Channing ; 
and Greeley, too, it was refreshing to meet. 
They were both much pleased with your criti- 
cism on Carlyle, but thought that you had over- 
looked what chiefly concerned them in the book, 
its practical aim and merits. 

I have also spent some pleasant hours with 

1 Henry James, Senior. 



jrr.26.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 121 

Waldo and Tappan at their counting-room, or 
rather intelligence office. 

I must still reckon myself with the innumer- 
able army of invalids, undoubtedly in a fair 
field they would rout the well, though I am 
tougher than formerly. Methinks I could paint 
the sleepy god more truly than the poets have 
done, from more intimate experience. Indeed, 
I have not kept my eyes very steadily open to 
the things of this world of late, and hence have 
little to report concerning them. However, I 
trust the awakening will come before the last 
trump, and then perhaps I may remember 
some of my dreams. 

I study the aspects of commerce at its Nar- 
rows here, where it passes in review before me, 
and this seems to be beginning at the right end 
to understand this Babylon. I have made a very 
rude translation of the Seven against Thebes, 
and Pindar too I have looked at, and wish he 
was better worth translating. I believe even 
the best things are not equal to their fame. 
Perhaps it would be better to translate fame 
itself, or is not that what the poets themselves 
do? However, I have not done with Pindar 
yet. I sent a long article on Etzler's book to 
the " Democratic Review " six weeks ago, which 
at length they have determined not to accept, 
as they could not subscribe to all the opinions, 



122 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

but asked for other matter, purely literary, 
I suppose. O'Sullivan wrote me that articles of 
this kind have to be referred to the circle who, 
it seems, are represented by this journal, and 
said something about " collective we " and " ho- 
mogeneity." 

Pray don't think of Bradbury & Soden l any 
more, 

" For good deed done through praiere 
Is sold and bought too dear, I \\is. 
To herte that of great valor is." 

I see that they have given up their shop here. 

Say to Mrs. Emerson that I am glad to re- 
member how she too dwells there in Concord, 
and shall send her anon some of the thoughts 
that belong to her. As for Edith, I seem to 
see a star in the east over where the young child 
is. Remember me to Mrs. Brown. 



These letters for the most part explain them- 

1 Emerson had written, July 20, " I am sorry to say that 
when I called on Bradbury & Soden, nearly a month ago, 
their partner, in their absence, informed me that they could 
not pay you, at present, any part of their debt on account of 
the Boston Miscellany. After much talking, all the promise 
he could offer was ' that within a year it would probably be 
paid,' a probability which certainly looks very slender. 
The very worst thing he said was the proposition that you 
should take your payment in the form of Boston Miscellanies 1 
I shall not fail to refresh their memory at intervals."

selves, with the aid of several to Thoreau's fam- 
ily, which the purpose of Emerson, in 1865, to 
present his friend in a stoical character, had ex- 
cluded from the collection then printed. Men- 
tion of C. S. Wheeler and his sad death in Ger- 
many had come to him from Emerson, as well 
as from his own family at Concord, of whose 
occupations Thoreau gives so genial a picture in 
the letter of August 6, to his mother. Emerson 
wrote : " You will have read and heard the sad 
news to the little village of Lincoln, of Stearns 
Wheeler's death. Such an overthrow to the 
hopes of his parents made me think more of 
them than of the loss the community will suffer 
in his kindness, diligence, and ingenuous mind." 
He died at Leipsic, in the midst of Greek stud- 
ies which have since been taken up and carried 
farther by a child of Concord, Professor Good- 
win of the same university. Henry James, 
several times mentioned in the correspondence, 
was the moral and theological essayist (father 
of the novelist Henry James, and the distin- 
guished Professor James of Harvard), who was 
so striking a personality in the Concord and 
Cambridge circle for many years. W. H. Chan- 
ning was a Christian Socialist fifty years ago, 
cousin of Ellery Channing, and nephew and 
biographer of Dr. Channing. Both he and Hor- 
ace Greeley were then deeply interested in the 



124 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [IMS, 

Fourierist scheme of association, one develop- 
ment of which was going on at Brook Farm, 
under direction of George Ripley, and another, 
differing in design, at Fruitlands, under Bron- 
son Alcott and Charles Lane. The jocose allu- 
sions of Thoreau to his Jones ancestors (the de- 
scendants of the Tory Colonel Jones of Weston) 
had this foundation in fact, that his uncle, 
Charles Dunbar, soon to be named in connec- 
tion with Daniel Webster, suffered from a sort 
of lethargy, which would put him to sleep in the 
midst of conversation. Webster had been re- 
tained in the once famous " Wyman case," of a 
bank officer charged with fraud, and had exerted 
his great forensic talent for a few days in the 
Concord court-house. Emerson wrote Thoreau, 
" You will have heard of the Wyman trial, and 
the stir it made in the village. But the Cliff 
and Walden knew nothing of that." 

TO MRS. THOREAU (AT CONCORD). 

CASTLETON, Tuesday, August 29, 1843. 

DEAR MOTHER, Mr. Emerson has just 
given me warning that he is about to send to 
Concord, which I will endeavor to improve. I 
am a great deal more wakeful than I was, and 
growing stout in other respects, so that I may 
yet accomplish something in the literary way; 
indeed, I should have done so before now but 



jcr.26.] TO MRS. THOREAU. 125 

for the slowness and poverty of the " Reviews " 
themselves I have tried sundry methods of 
earning money in the city, of late, but without 
success : have rambled into every bookseller's 
or publisher's house, and discussed their affairs 
with them. Some propose to me to do what an 
honest man cannot. Among others. I conversed 
with the Harpers to see if they might not find 
me useful to them ; but they say that they are 
making $50,000 annually, and their motto is to 
let well alone. I find that I talk with these 
poor men as if I were over head and ears in 
business, and a few thousands were no consider- 
ation with me. I almost reproach myself for 
bothering them so to no purpose ; but it is a 
very valuable experience, and the best introduc- 
tion I could have. 

We have had a tremendous rain here last 
Monday night and Tuesday morning. I was in 
the city at Giles Waldo's, and the streets at 
daybreak were absolutely impassable for the 
water. Yet the accounts of the storm that you 
may have seen are exaggerated, as indeed are 
all such things, to my imagination. On Sunday 
I hriird Mr. Bellows preach here on the island ; 
but the fine prospect over the Bay and Narrows, 
from where I sat, preached louder than he, 
tli'Mi-h In- di.l far better than the average, if I 
remember aright I should have liked to see

.Daniel Webster walking about Concord ; I sup- 
pose the town shook, every step he took. But 
I trust there were some sturdy Concordians who 
were not tumbled down by the jar, but repre- 
sented still the upright town. Where was 
George Minott ? he would not have gone far to 
see him. Uncle Charles should have been there, 

he might as well have been catching cat naps 
in Concord as anywhere. 

And then, what a whetter-up of his memory 
this event would have been ! You 'd have had 
all the classmates again in alphabetical order 
reversed, " and Seth Hunt and Bob Smith

way. He dislikes New York very much. The 
Mercantile Library, that is, its Librarian, pre- 
sented me with a stranger's ticket, for a month, 
and I was glad to read the " Reviews " there, 
and Carlyle's last article. I have bought some 
pantaloons ; stockings show no holes yet. These 
pantaloons cost $2.25 ready made. 
In haste. 

TO R. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, September 14, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, Miss Fuller will tell you the 
news from these parts, so I will only devote 
these few moments to what she does n't know as 
well. I was absent only one day and night from 
the island, the family expecting me back imme- 
diately. I was to earn a certain sum before 
winter, and thought it worth the while to try 
various experiments. I carried " The Agricul- 
turist " about the city, and up as far as Manhat- 
tanville, and called at the Croton Reservoir, 
where, indeed, they did not want any " Agricul- 
turists," but paid well enough in their way. 

Literature comes to a poor market here ; and 
even the little that I write is more than will sell. 
I have tried "The Dem. Review," "The New 
Mirror,** and " Brother Jonatlian." l The last 

1 It may need to bo mid that these were New York week- 
lies the Mirror, edited in part by N. P. Willin, and the New

two, as well as the " New World," are over- 
whelmed with contributions which cost nothing, 
and are worth no more. " The Knickerbocker " 
is too poor, and only "The Ladies' Companion" 
pays. O'Sullivan is printing the manuscript I 
sent him some time ago, having objected only to 
my want of sympathy with the Committee. 

I doubt if you have made more corrections in 
my manuscript than I should have done ere this, 
though they may be better ; but I ani glad you 
have taken any pains with it. I have not pre- 
pared any translations for the " Dial," supposing 
there would be no room, though it is the only 
place for them. 

I have been seeing men during these days, 
and trying experiments upon trees ; have in- 
serted three or four hundred buds (quite a 
Buddhist, one might say). Books I have access 
to through your brother and Mr. McKean, and 
have read a good deal. Quarles's " Divine Po- 
ems " as well as " Emblems" are quite a discov- 
ery. 

I am very sorry Mrs. Emerson is so sick. Re- 
member me to her and to your mother. I like 
to think of your living on the banks of the Mill- 

Warld by Park Benjamin, formerly of Boston, whose distinc- 
tion it is to have first named Hawthorne as a writer of genius. 
" Miss Fuller " was Margaret, not yet resident in New York, 
whither she went to live in 1844.

weeds; for what are botanical distinctions at 
this distance? 

TO HIS MOTHEB (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, October 1, 1843. 

DEAR MOTHER, I hold together remarka- 
bly well as yet, speaking of my outward linen 
and woolen man ; no holes more than I brought 
away, and no stitches needed yet. It is mar- 
velous. I think the Fates must be on my side, 
for there is less than a plank between me and 
Time, to say the least. As for Eldorado, that 
is far off yet. My bait will not tempt the rats, 
they are too well fed. The " Democratic Re- 
view " is poor, and can only afford half or quar- 
ter pay, which it will do; and they say there 
is a " Lady's Companion " that pays, but I 
could not write anything companionable. How- 
ever, speculate as we will, it is quite gratuitous; 
for life, nevertheless and never the more, goes 
steadily on, well or ill-fed, and clothed somehow, 
and " honor bright " withal. It is very gratify- 
ing to live in the prospect of great successes 
always ; and for that purpose we must leave a 
sufficient foreground to see them through. All 
the painters prefer distant prospects for the 
greater breadth of view, and delicacy of tint. 
But this is no news, and describes no new con- 
ditions. 



130 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

Meanwhile I am somnambulic at least, stir- 
ring in my sleep ; indeed, quite awake. I read 
a good deal, and am pretty well known in the 
libraries of New York. Am in with the libra- 
rian (one Dr. Forbes) of the Society Library, 
who has lately been to Cambridge to learn lib- 
erality, and has come back to let me take out 
some un-take-out-able books, which I was threat- 
ening to read on the spot. And Mr. McKean, 
of the Mercantile Library, is a true gentleman 
(a former tutor of mine), and offers me every 
privilege there. I have from him a perpetual 
stranger's ticket, and a citizen's rights besides, 
all which privileges I pay handsomely for by 
improving. 

A canoe race " came off " on the Hudson the 
other day, between Chippeways and New York- 
ers, which must have been as moving a sight as 
the buffalo hunt which I witnessed. But canoes 
and buffaloes are all lost, as is everything here, 
in the mob. It is only the people have come to 
see one another. Let them advertise that there 
will be a gathering at Hoboken, having bar- 
gained with the ferryboats, and there will be, 
and they need not throw in the buffaloes. 

I have crossed the bay twenty or thirty times, 
and have seen a great many immigrants going 
up to the city for the first time : Norwegians, 
who carry their old-fashioned farming-tools to 



jer.26.] TO HIS MOTHER. 131 

the West with them, and will buy nothing here 
for fear of being cheated ; English operatives, 
known by their pale faces and stained hands, 
who will recover their birthright in a little cheap 
sun and wind ; English travelers on their way 
to the Astor House, to whom I have done the 
honors of the city ; whole families of emigrants 
cooking their dinner upon the pavement, all 
sunburnt, so that you are in doubt where the 
foreigner's face of flesh begins ; their tidy clothes 
laid on, and then tied to their swathed bodies, 
which move about like a bandaged finger, caps 
set on the head as if woven of the hair, which 
is still growing at the roots, each and all 
busily cooking, stooping from time to time over 
the pot, and having something to drop in it, that 
so they may be entitled to take something out, 
forsooth. They look like respectable but strait- 
ened people, who may turn out to be Counts when 
they get to Wisconsin, and will have this expe- 
rience to relate to their children. 

Seeing so many people from day to day, one 
comes to have less respect for flesh and bones, 
and thinks they must be more loosely joined, of 
less firm fibre, than the few he had known. It 
must have a very bad influence on children to 
see so many human beings at once, mere herds 
of men. 

I came across Henry Bigelow a week ago, sit- 



132 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

ting in front of a hotel in Broadway, very much 
as if he were under his father's stoop. He is 
seeking to be admitted into the bar in New York, 
but as yet had not succeeded. I directed him to 
Fuller's store, which he had not found, and in- 
vited him to come and see me if he came to the 
island. Tell Mrs. and Miss Ward that I have 
not forgotten them, and was glad to hear from 
George with whom I spent last night that 
they had returned to C. Tell Mrs. Brown that 
it gives me as much pleasure to know that she 
thinks of me and my writing as if I had been 
the author of the piece in question, but I did 
not even read over the papers I sent. The 
" Mirror " is really the most readable journal 
here. I see that they have printed a short piece 
that I wrote to sell, in the " Dem. Review," 
and still keep the review of " Paradise," that I 
may include in it a notice of another book by 
the same author, which they have found, and are 
going to send me. 

I don't know when I shall come home ; I like 
to keep that feast in store. Tell Helen that I 
do not see any advertisement for her, and I am 
looking for myself. If I could find a rare open- 
ing, I might be tempted to try with her for a 
year, till I had paid my debts, but for such I 
am sure it is not well to go out of New Eng- 
land. Teachers are but poorly recompensed, 



.26.] TO MRS. EMERSON. 133 

even here. Tell her and Sophia (if she is not 
gone) to write to me. Father will know that 
tlii- letter is to him as well as to you. I send 
him a paper which usually contains the news, 
if not all that is stirring, all that has stirred, 
and even draws a little on the future. I wish 
he would send me, by and by, the paper which 
contains the results of the Cattle Show. You 
must get Helen's eyes to read this, though she 
is a scoffer at honest penmanship. 

TO MBS. EMEKSOJT (AT CONCORD). 

STATKN ISLAND, October 16, 1843. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I promised you some 
thoughts long ago, but it would be hard to tell 
whether these are the ones. I suppose that the 
great questions of " Fate, Freewill, Foreknow- 
ledge absolute," which used to be discussed at 
Concord, are still unsettled. And here comes 
[W. H.] Channing, with his " Present," to ver 
the world again, a rather galvanic movement, 
I think. However, I like the man all the better, 
though his schemes the less. I am sorry for his 
confessions. Faith never makes a confession. 

Have you had the annual berrying party, or 
sat on the Cliffs a whole day this summer ? I 
suppose the flowers have fared quite as well since 
I was not there to scoff at them ; and the hens, 
without doubt, keep up their reputation. 



134 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843, 

I have been reading lately what of Quarles's 
poetry I could get. He was a contemporary of 
Herbert, and a kindred spirit. I think you 
would like him. It is rare to find one who was 
so much of a poet and so little of an artist. He 
wrote long poems, almost epics for length, about 
Jonah, Esther, Job, Samson, and Solomon, in- 
terspersed with meditations after a quite original 
plan, Shepherd's Oracles, Comedies, Ro- 
mances, Fancies, and Meditations, the quin- 
tessence of meditation, and Enchiridions of 
Meditation all divine, and what he calls his 
More ing Muse ; besides prose works as curious 
as the rest. He was an unwearied Christian, 
and a reformer of some old school withal. Hope- 
lessly quaint, as if he lived all alone and knew 
nobody but his wife, who appears to have rev- 
erenced him. He never doubts his genius; it 
is only he and his God in all the world. He 
uses language sometimes as greatly as Shake- 
speare ; and though there is not much straight 
grain in him, there is plenty of tough, crooked 
timber. In an age when Herbert is revived, 
Quarles surely ought not to be forgotten. 

I will copy a few such sentences, as I should 
read to you if there. Mrs. Brown, too, may 
find some nutriment in them. 

How does the Saxon Edith do ? Can you 
tell yet to which school of philosophy she be-

longs, whether she will be a fair saint of some 
Christian order, or a follower of Plato and the 
heathen? Bid Ellen a good-night or a good- 
morning from me, and see if she will remember 
where it comes from ; and remember me to Mrs. 
Brown, and your mother, and Elizabeth Hoar. 

TO B. W. EMERSON (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, October 17, 1843. 
MY DEAR FRIEXD, I went with my pupil 
to the Fair of the American Institute, and so 
lost a visit from Tappan, whom I met returning 
from the Island. I should have liked to hear 
more news from his lips, though he had left me 
a letter and the " Dial," which is a sort of cir- 
cular letter itself. I find Channing's 1 letters 
full of life, and I enjoy their wit highly. Lane 
writes straight and solid, like a guideboard, but 
I find that I put off the " social tendencies " to 
a future day, which may never come. He is 
always Shaker fare, quite as luxurious as his 
principles will allow. I feel as if I were ready 
to be appointed a committee on poetry, I have 

1 The allusion here is to Ellery Channing's " Youth of the 
Poet and Painter," in the Dial an imnnixb<-<l autobiography. 
The Pretrnt of W. II. Channing. his cousin, named above, was 
a short-lived periodical, begun September 1">, IS1:>, and ended 
in April. I 1 - It. " McKean " was Henry Swasey McKean, who 
was a classmate of Charles Emerson at Harvard in 1828, a 
tutor there in 1830-35. and who died in 1857.

got my eyes so whetted and proved of late, like 
the knife-sharpener I saw at the Fair, certified 
to have been " in constant use in a gentleman's 
family for more than two years." Yes, I ride 
along the ranks of the English poets, casting 
terrible glances, and some I blot out, and some 
I spare. McKean has imported, within the 
year, several new editions and collections of old 
poetry, of which I have the reading, but there 
is a good deal of chaff to a little meal, hardly 
worth bolting. I have just opened Bacon's " Ad- 
vancement of Learning " for the first time, which 
I read with great delight. It is more like what 
Scott's novels were than anything. 

I see that I was very blind to send you my 
manuscript in such a state ; but I have a good 
second sight, at least. I could still shake it in 
the wind to some advantage, if it would hold 
together. There are some sad mistakes in the 
printing. It is a little unfortunate that the 
" Ethnical Scriptures " should hold out so well, 
though it does really hold out. The Bible ought 
not to be very large. Is it not singular that, 
while the religious world is gradually picking 
to pieces its old testaments, here are some com- 
ing slowly after, on the seashore, picking up the 
durable relics of perhaps older books, and put- 
ting them together again ? 

Your Letter to Contributors is excellent, and 



*r.26.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 137 

hits the nail on the head. It will taste sour to 
their palates at first, no doubt, but it will bear 
a sweet fruit at last. I like the poetry, espe- 
cially the Autumn verses. They ring true. 
Though I am quite weather-beaten with poetry, 
having weathered so many epics of late. The 
" Sweep Ho ! " sounds well this way. But I have 
a good deal of fault to find with your " Ode to 
Beauty." The tune is altogether unworthy of 
the thoughts. You slope too quickly to the 
rhyme, as if that trick had better be performed 
as soon as possible, or as if you stood over the 
line with a hatchet, and chopped off the verses as 
they came out, some short and some long. But 
give us a long reel, and we '11 cut it up to suit 
ourselves. It sounds like parody. " Thee knew 
I of old," " Remediless thirst," are some of 
those stereotyped lines. I am frequently re- 
minded, I believe, of Jane Taylor's " Philoso- 
pher's Scales," and how the world 

" Flew oat with a bounce," 

which 

" Yerked the philosopher oat of his cell ; " 

or else of 

" From the clime* of the son all war-worn and weary." 

I had rather have the thought come ushered 
with a flourish of oaths and curses. Yet I love 
your poetry as I do little else that is near and

recent, especially when you get fairly round the 
end of the line, and are not thrown back upon 
the rocks. To read the lecture on "The Comic" 
is as good as to be in our town meeting or Ly- 
ceum once more. 

I am glad that the Concord farmers ploughed 
well this year ; it promises that something will 
be done these summers. But I am suspicious of 
that Brittonner, who advertises so many cords 
of good oak, chestnut, and maple wood for sale. 
Good ! ay, good for what ? And there shall not 
be left a stone upon a stone. But no matter, 
let them hack away. The sturdy Irish arms that 
do the work are of more worth than oak or 
maple. Methinks I could look with equanimity 
upon a long street of Irish cabins, and pigs and 
children reveling in the genial Concord dirt ; and 
I should still find my Walden wood and Fair 
Haven in their tanned and happy faces. 

I write this in the cornfield it being wash- 
ing-day with the inkstand Elizabeth Hoar 
gave me; 1 though it is not redolent of corn- 

1 This inkstand was presented by Miss Hoar, with a note 
dated " Boston, May 2, 1843," which deserves to be copied : 

DEAB HENRY, The rain prevented me from seeing you 
the night before I came away, to leave with you a parting as- 
surance of good will and good hope. We have become better 
acquainted within the two past years than in our whole life as 
schoolmates and neighbors before ; and I am unwilling to let 
you go away without telling you that I, among your other

stalks, I fear. Let me not be forgotten by 
Channing and Hawthorne, nor our gray-suited 
neighbor under the hill [Edmund Hosmer] . 

This letter will be best explained by a refer- 
ence to the "Dial" for October, 1843. The 
" Ethnical Scriptures " were selections from the 
Brahminical books, from Confucius, etc., such 
as we have since seen in great abundance. The 
Autumn verses are by Channing ; w Sweep 
Ho ! " by Ellen Sturgis, afterwards Mrs. 
Hooper ; the " Youth of the Poet and Painter " 
also by Channing. The Letter to Contributors, 
which is headed simply "A Letter," is by Em- 
erson, and has been much overlooked by his 
later readers ; his " Ode to Beauty " is very well 
known, and does not deserve the slashing cen- 
sure of Thoreau, though, as it now stands, it is 
better than first printed. Instead of 

friends, shall miss you much, and follow you with remem- 
brance and all best wishes and confidence. Will you take t liis 
little inkstand and try if it will carry ink safely from Concord 
to Staten Island ? and the pen, which, if you can write with 
steel, may be made sometimes the interpreter of friendly 
thoughts to those whom you leave beyond the reach of your 
voice, or record the inspirations of Nature, who, I doubt 
not, will be as faithful to yon who trust her in the sea-girt 
Stateu Inland as in Concord woods and meadows. Qood-by, 
and t J wpdrrtir, which, a wise man ays, is the only salutation 
fit for the wise. 

Truly your friend, . HOAB.

TO HELEN THOREAIT (AT CONCORD). 

STATEN ISLAND, October 18, 1843. 

DEAR HELEN, What do you mean by say- 
ing that " we have written eight times by private 
opportunity " ? Is n't it the more the better ? 
And am I not glad of it ? But people have a 
habit of not letting me know it when they go to 
Concord from New York. I endeavored to get 
you " The Present " when I was last in the city, 
but they were all sold ; and now another is out, 
which I will send, if I get it. I did not send the 
" Democratic Review," because I had no copy, 
and my piece was not worth fifty cents. You 
think that Channing's words would apply to me 
too, as living more in the natural than the moral 
world ; but I think that you mean the world of 
men and women rather, and reformers generally. 
My objection to Channing and all that f rater- 



*r.26.] TO HELEN THOREAU. 141 

nity is, that they need and deserve sympathy 
themselves rather than are able to render it to 
others. They want faith, and mistake their pri- 
vate ail for an infected atmosphere ; but let any 
one of them recover hope for a moment, and 
right his particular grievance, and he will no 
longer train in that company. To speak or do 
anything that shall concern mankind, one must 
speak and act as if well, or from that grain of 
health which he has left. This " Present " book 
indeed is blue, but the hue of its thoughts is 
yellow. I say these things with the less hesita- 
tion, because I have the jaundice myself ; but I 
also know what it is to be well. But do not 
think that one can escape from mankind who is 
one of them, and is so constantly dealing with 
them. 

I could not undertake to form a nucleus of an 
institution for the development of infant minds, 
where none already existed. It would be too 
cruel. And then, as if looking all this while one 
way with benevolence, to walk off another about 
one's own affairs suddenly ! Something of this 
kind is an unavoidable objection to that. 

I am very sorry to hear such bad news about 
Aunt Maria ; but I think that the worst is al- 
ways the least to be apprehended, for nature is 
averse to it as well as we. I trust to hear that 
she is quite well soon. I send love to her and 



142 YEARS OF DISCIPLINE. [1843. 

Aunt Jane. For three months I have not known 
whether to think of Sophia as in Bangor or Con- 
cord, and now you say that she is going directly. 
Tell her to write to me, and establish her where- 
abouts, and also to get well directly. And see 
that she has something worthy to do. when she 
gets down there, for that 's the best remedy for 
disease. 

Your affectionate brother, 

H. D. THOREAU. 



IL GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. 

THIS was the golden age of hope and achieve- 
ment for the Concord poets and philosophers. 
Their ranks were not yet broken by death (for 
Stearns Wheeler was hardly one of them), their 
spirits were high, and their faith in each other 
unbounded. Emerson wrote thus from Concord, 
while Thoreau was perambulating Staten Island 
and calling on " the false booksellers : " " Ellery 
Channing is excellent company, and we walk in 
all directions. He remembers you with great 
faith and hope ; thinks you ought not to see 
Concord again these ten years that you ought 
to grind up fifty Concords in your mill and 
much other opinion and counsel he holds in store 
on this topic. Hawthorne walked with me yes- 
terday afternoon, and not until after our return 
did I read his * Celestial Railroad,' which has a 
serene strength which we cannot afford not to 
praise, in this low life." 

The Transcendentalists had their " Quarterly," 
and even their daily organ, for Mr. Greeley put 
the " Tribune " at their service, and gave places

on its staff to Margaret Fuller and her brother- 
in-law Channing, and woidd gladly have made 
room for Emerson in its columns, if the swift 
utterance of a morning paper had suited his 
habit of publication. While in the " Tribune " 
office, Ellery Channing thus wrote to Thoreau, 
after he had returned home, disappointed with 
New York, to make lead pencils in his father's 
shop at Concord. 

ELLERY CHANNING TO THOREAU (AT CONCORD). 

March 5, 1845. 

MY DEAR THOREAU, The handwriting of 
your letter is so miserable that I am not sure I 
have made it out. If I have, it seems to me you 
are the same old sixpence you used to be, rather 
rusty, but a genuine piece. I see nothing for 
you in this earth but that field which I once 
christened " Briars ; " go out upon that, build 
yourself a hut, and there begin the grand pro- 
cess of devouring yourself alive. I see no alter- 
native, no other hope for you. Eat yourself 
up ; you will eat nobody else, nor anything else. 
Concord is just as good a place as any other ; 
there are, indeed, more people in the streets of 
that village than in the streets of this. This is 
a singularly muddy town ; muddy, solitary, and 
silent. 

In your line, I have not done a great deal 



JKT.27.] CHANNING TO THOREAU. 145 

since I arrived here ; I do not mean the Pencil 
line, but the Staten Island line, having been 
there once, to walk on a beach by the tele- 
graph, but did not visit the scene of your do- 
minical duties. Staten Island is very distant 
from No. 30 Ann Street. I saw polite William 
Emerson in November last, but have not caught 
any glimpse of him since then. I am as usual 
suffering the various alternations from agony to 
despair, from hope to fear, from pain to pleas- 
ure. Such wretched one-sided productions as 
you know nothing of the universal man ; you 
may think yourself well off. 

That baker, Hecker, who used to live on two 
crackers a day, I have not seen ; nor Black, nor 
Vethake, nor Danesaz, nor Rynders, nor any of 
Emerson's old cronies, excepting James, a lit- 
tle fat, rosy Swedenborgian amateur, with the 
look of a broker, and the brains and heart of 
a Pascal. William Channing, I see nothing 
of him ; he is the dupe of good feelings, and I 
have all-too-many of these now. I have seen 
something of your friends, Waldo and Tappan, 
and have also seen our good man McKean, 
the keeper of that stupid place, the Mercantile 
Library. 

Acting on Channing's hint, and an old fancy 
of his own, Thoreau, in the summer of 1845,

built his cabin at Walden and retired there ; 
while Hawthorne entered the Salem Custom- 
house, and Alcott, returning defeated from his 
Fruitlands paradise, was struggling with poverty 
and discouragement at Concord. Charles Lane, 
his English comrade, withdrew to New York or 
its vicinity, and in 1846 to London, whence he 
had come in 1842, full of hope and enthusiasm. 
A few notes of his, or about him, may here find 
place. They were sent to Thoreau at Concord, 
and show that Lane continued to value his can- 
did friend. The first, written after leaving 
Fruitlands, introduces the late Father Hecker, 
who had been one of the family there, to Tho- 
reau. The second and third relate to the sale 
of the Alcott-Lane library, and other matters.

BOSTON, December 3, 1843. 

DEAR FRIEND, As well as my wounded 
hands permit, I have scribbled something for 
friend Hecker, which if agreeable may be the 
opportunity for entering into closer relations 
with him ; a course I think likely to be mutually 
encouraging, as well as beneficial to all men. 
But let it reach him in the manner most con- 
formable to your own feelings. That from all 
perils of a false position you may shortly be re- 
lieved, and landed in the position where you feel

DEAR FRIEND, The books you were so kind 
as to deposit about two years and a half ago 
with Messrs. Wiley & Putnam have all been 
sold, but as they were left in your name it is 
needful, in strict business, that you should send 
an order to them to pay to me the amount due. 
I will therefore thank you to inclose me such 
an order at your earliest convenience in a letter 
addressed to your admiring friend,

DEAR FRIEND, If the human nature parti- 
cipates of the elemental I am no longer in dan- 
ger of becoming suburban, or super-urban, that 
is to say, too urbane. I am now more likely to 
be converted into a petrifaction, for slabs of rock 
and foaming waters never so abounded in my 
neighborhood. A very Peter I shall become : 
on this rock He has built his church. You 
would find much joy in these eminences and in 
the views therefrom. 



148 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1846, 

My pen has been necessarily unproductive in 
the continued motion of the sphere in which I 
have lately been moved. You, I suppose, have 
not passed the winter to the world's unprofit. 

You never have seen, as I have, the book with 
a preface of 450 pages and a. text of 60. My 
letter is like unto it. 

I have only to add that your letter of the 26th 
February did its work, and that I submit to you 
cordial thanks for the same. 

Yours truly, 

CHAS. LANE. 

I hope to hear occasionally of your doings 
and those of your compeers in your classic 
ploughings and diggings. 

To HENRY D. THOBEAU, 
Concord Woods. 

Thoreau's letters to Lane have not come into 
any editor's hands. In England, before Lane's 
discovery by Alcott, in 1842, he had been the 
editor of the " Mark-Lane Gazette " (or some- 
thing similar), which gave the price-current of 
wheat, etc., in the English markets. Emerson 
found him in Hampstead, London, in February, 
1848, and wrote to Thoreau : " I went last Sun- 
day, for the first time, to see Lane at Hamp- 
stead, and dined with him. He was full of 



*r.30.] EMERSON TO THOREAU. 149 

friendliness and hospitality ; has a school of six- 
teen children, one lady as matron, then Oldham. 
That is all the household. They looked just 
comfortable." 

." Lane instructed me to ask you to forward 
his * Dials * to him, which must be done, if you 
can find them. Three bound volumes are among 
his books in my library. The fourth volume is 
in unbound numbers at J. Munroe & Co.'s shop, 
received there in a parcel to my address, a day 
or two before I sailed, and which I forgot to 
carry to Concord. It must be claimed without 
delay. It is certainly there, was opened by 
me and left ; and they can inclose all four vol- 
umes to Chapman for me." 

This would indicate that he had not lost in- 
terest in the days and events of his American 
sojourn, unpleasant as some of these must 
have been to the methodical, prosaic English- 
man. 

While at Walden, Thoreau wrote but few let- 
ters ; there is, however, a brief correspondence 
with Mr. J. E. Cabot, then an active naturalist, 
cooperating with Agassiz in his work on the 
American fishes, who had requested Thoreau to 
procure certain species from Concord. The let- 
ters were written from the cabin at Walden, 
and it is this same structure that figures in the 
letters from Thoreau to Emerson in England,

as the proposed nucleus of the cottage of poor 
Hugh the gardener, before he ran away from 
Concord, as there narrated, on a subsequent 
page. The first sending of river-fish was in the 
end of April, 1847. Then followed this let- 
ter : 

TO ELLIOT CABOT (AT BOSTON). 

CONCORD, May 8, 1847. 

DEAR SIR, I believe that I have not yet 
acknowledged the receipt of your notes, and a 
five dollar bill. I am very glad that the fishes 
afforded Mr. Agassiz so much pleasure. I could 
easily have obtained more specimens of the Ster- 
nothaerus odoratus ; they are quite numerous 
here. I will send more of them erelong. Snap- 
ping turtles are perhaps as frequently met with 
in our muddy river as anything, but they are 
not always to be had when wanted. It is now 
rather late in the season for them. As no one 
makes a business of seeking them, and they are 
valued for soups, science may be forestalled by 
appetite in this market, and it will be necessary 
to bid pretty high to induce persons to obtain 
or preserve them. I think that from seventy- 
five cents to a dollar apiece would secure all 
that are in any case to be had, and will set this 
price upon their heads, if the treasury of science 
is full enough to warrant it. 



r.29.] TO ELLIOT CABOT. 151 

You will excuse me for taking toll in the 
shape of some, it may be, impertinent and unsci- 
entific inquiries. There are found in the waters 
of the Concord, so far as I know, the following 
kinds of fishes : 

/'irkerel. Besides the common, fishermen dis- 
tinguish the Brook, or Grass Pickerel, which bites 
differently, and has a shorter snout. Those 
caught in Walden, hard by my house, are easily 
distinguished from those caught in the river, 
being much heavier in proportion to their size, 
stouter, firmer fleshed, and lighter colored. The 
little pickerel which I sent last, jumped into the 
boat in its fright. 

Pouts. Those in the pond are of different 
appearance from those that I have sent. 

Breams. Some more green, others more 
brown. 

Suckers. The horned, which I sent first, and 
the black. I am not sure whether the Common 
or Boston sucker is found here. Are the three 
which I sent hist, which were speared in the river, 
identical with the three black suckers, taken by 
hand in the brook, which I sent before ? I have 
never examined them minutely. 

Perch. The river perch, of which I sent five 
specimens in the box, are darker colored than 
those found in the pond. There are myriads of 
small ones in the latter place, and but few large 



152 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

ones. I have counted ten transverse bands on 
some of the smaller. 

Lampreys. Very scarce since the dams at 
Lowell and Billerica were built. 

Shiners. Leuciscus chrysoleucas, silver and 
golden. 

What is the difference? 

Roach or Ckiverin, Leuciscus pulchellus, 
argenteus, or what not. The white and the red. 
The former described by Storer, but the latter, 
which deserves distinct notice, not described, to 
my knowledge. Are the minnows (called here 
dace), of which I sent three live specimens, I 
believe, one larger and two smaller, the young of 
this species? 

Trout. Of different appearance in different 
brooks in this neighborhood. 

Eels. 

Red-tinned Minnows, of which I sent you a 
dozen alive. I have never recognized them in 
any books. Have they any scientific name ? 

If convenient, will you let Dr. Storer see 
these brook minnows ? There is also a kind of 
dace or fresh-water smelt in the pond, which is, 
perhaps, distinct from any of the above. What 
of the above does M. Agassiz particularly wish 
to see ? Does he want more specimens of kinds 
which I have already sent? There are also 
minks, muskrats, frogs, lizards, tortoise, snakes, 



r.29.] TO ELLIOT CABOT. 153 

caddice-worms, leeches, muscles, etc., or rather, 
here they are. The funds which you sent me 
are nearly exhausted. Most fishes can now be 
taken with the hook, and it will cost but little 
trouble or money to obtain them. The snapping 
turtles will be the main expense. I should think 
that five dollars more, at least, might be profita- 
bly expended. 

TO ELLIOT CABOT (AT BOSTON). 

CONCORD, June 1, 1847. 

DEAR SIR, I send you 15 pouts, 17 perch, 
13 shiners, 1 larger land tortoise, and 5 muddy 
tortoises, all from the pond by my house. Also 
7 perch, 5 shiners, 8 breams, 4 dace ? 2 muddy 
tortoises, 5 painted do., and 3 land do., all from 
the river. One black snake, alive, and one dor- 
mouse? caught last night in my cellar. The 
tortoises were all put in alive ; the fishes were 
alive yesterday, t. e., Monday, and some this 
morning. Observe the difference between those 
from the pond, which is pure water, and those 
from the river. 

I will send the lighteolored trout and the 
pickerel with the longer snout, which is our 
large one, when I meet with them. I have set a 
price upon the heads of snapping turtles, though 
it is late in the season to get them. 

If I wrote red-finned eel, it was a slip of the 



154 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

pen ; I meant red-finned minnow. This is their 
name here ; though smaller specimens have but 
a slight reddish tinge at the base of the pecto- 
rals. 

Will you, at your leisure, answer these queries ? 

Do you mean to say that the twelve banded 
minnows which I sent are undescribed, or only 
one? What are the scientific names of those 
minnows which have any ? Are the four dace I 
send to-day identical with one of the former, and 
what are they called ? Is there such a fish as 
the black sucker described, distinct from the 
common ? 

AGASSIZ TO THOREAU (AT CONCORD). 

In October, 1849, Agassiz, in reply to a re- 
quest from Thoreau that he would lecture in 
Bangor, sent this characteristic letter : 

" I remember with much pleasure the time 
when you used to send me specimens from your 
vicinity, and also our short interview in the 
Marlborough Chapel. 1 I am under too many 
obligations of your kindness to forget it. I am 
very sorry that I missed your visit in Boston ; 
but for eighteen months I have now been settled 
in Cambridge. It would give me great pleasure 
to engage for the lectures you ask from me for 
the Bangor Lyceum ; but I find it has been last 

1 Wbere A.gasah was giving a course of Lowell lectures. 



*r.32.] AGASSIZ TO THOREAU. 155 

winter such a heavy tax upon ray health, that I 
wish for the present to make no engagements ; 
as I have some hope of making my living this 
year by other efforts, and beyond the neces- 
sity of my wants, both domestic and scientific, 
I am determined not to exert myself ; as all the 
time I can thus secure to myself must be exclu- 
sively devoted to science. My only business is 
my intercourse with nature ; and could I do with- 
out draughtsmen, lithographers, etc., I would 
live still more retired. This will satisfy you that 
whenever you come this way, I shall be delighted 
to see you, since I have also heard something 
of your mode of living." 

Agassiz had reason indeed to remember the 
collections made by Thoreau, since (from the 
letters of Mr. Cabot) they aided him much in 
his comparison of the American with the Eu- 
ropean fishes. When the first firkin of Concord 
lisli arrived in Boston, where Agassiz was then 
working, " he was highly delighted, and began 
immediately to spread them out and arrange 
them for his draughtsman. Some of the species 
he had seen before, but never in so fresh con- 
dition; others, as the breams and the pout, he 
had seen only in spirits, and tlu> littlctortoi.se he 
knew only from the books. I am sure you would 
have felt fully repaid for your trouble," adds 



156 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

Mr. Cabot, " if you could have seen the eager 
satisfaction with which he surveyed each fin and 
scale." Agassiz himself wrote the same day : 
" I have been highly pleased to find that the 
small mud turtle was really the Sternothaerus 
odoratus, as I suspected, a very rare species, 
quite distinct from the snapping turtle. The 
suckers were all of one and the same species 
( Catastomus tuberculatus) ; the female has the 
tubercles. As I am very anxious to send some 
snapping turtles home with my first boxes, I 
would thank Mr. T. very much if he could have 
some taken for me." 

Mr. Cabot goes on : " Of the perch Agassiz 
remarked that it was almost identical with that 
of Europe, but distinguishable, on close exami- 
nation, by the tubercles on the sub-operculum. 
. . . More of the painted tortoises would be 
acceptable. The snapping turtles are very in- 
teresting to him as forming a transition from 
the turtles proper to the alligator and crocodile. 
. . . We have received three boxes from you 
since the first." (May 27.) "Agassiz was much 
surprised and pleased at the extent of the col- 
lections you sent during his absence in New 
York. Among the fishes there is one, and prob- 
ably two, new species. The fresh-water smelt 
he does not know. He is very anxious to see 
the pickerel with the long snout, which he sus- 



*r.29.] CABOT TO THOREAU. 157 

pects may be the Esox estor, or Maskalong ; 
he has seen this at Albany. . . . As to the 
minks, etc., I know they would all be very ac- 
ceptable to him. When I asked him about 
these, and more specimens of what you have 
sent, he said, ' I dare not make any request, for 
I do not know how much trouble I may be 
giving to Mr. Thoreau ; but my method of ex- 
amination requires many more specimens than 
most naturalists would care for." (June 1.) 
" Agassiz is delighted to find one, and he thinks 
two, more new species ; one is a Pomotis, the 
bream without the red spot in the operculum, 
and with a red belly and fins. The other is the 
shallower and lighter colored shiner. The four 
dace you sent last are Leuciscus argenteus. 
They are different from that you sent before 
under this name, but which was a new species. 
Of the four kinds of minnow, two are new. 
There is a black sucker (Catastomus nigri- 
can), but there has been no specimen among 
those you have sent, and A. has never seen a 
specimen. He seemed to know your mouse, and 
called it the white-bellied mouse. It was the 
first specimen he had seen. I am in hopes to 
bring or send him to Concord, to look after new 
Leucisci, etc." Agassiz did afterwards come, 
more than once, and examined turtles with Tho- 
reau. 



158 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

Soon after this scientific correspondence, Tho- 
reau left his retreat by Walden to take the place 
of Emerson in his household, while his friend 
went to visit Carlyle and give lectures in Eng- 
land. The letters that follow are among the 
longest Thoreau ever composed, and will give a 
new conception of the writer to those who may 
have figured him as a cold, stoical, or selfish 
person, withdrawn from society and its duties. 
The first describes the setting out of Emerson 
for Europe. 

TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT BANGOR). 

CONCORD, October 24, 1847. 

DEAR SOPHIA, I thank you for those let- 
ters about Ktaadn, and hope you will save and 
send me the rest, and anything else you may 
meet with relating to the Maine woods. That 
Dr. Young is both young and green too at trav- 
eling in the woods. However, I hope he got 
" yarbs " enough to satisfy him. I went to Bos- 
ton the 5th of this month to see Mr. Emerson 
off to Europe. He sailed in the Washington 
Irving packet ship ; the same in which Mr. [F. 
H.] Hedge went before him. Up to this trip 
the first mate aboard this ship was, as I hear, 
one Stephens, a Concord boy, son of Stephens 
the carpenter, who used to live above Mr. Den- 
nis's. Mr. Emerson's stateroom was like a car- 



*r.30.] TO SOPHIA THOREAU. 159 

peted dark closet, about six feet square, with a 
large keyhole for a window. The window was 
about as big as a saucer, and the glass two inches 
thick, not to mention another skylight overhead 
in the deck, the size of an oblong doughnut, 
and about as opaque. Of course it would be in 
vain to look up, if any contemplative promenader 
put his foot upon it. Such will be his lodgings 
for two or three weeks ; and instead of a walk 
in Walden woods he will take a promenade on 
deck, where the few trees, you know, are stripped 
of their bark. The steam-tug carried the ship 
to sea against a head wind without a rag of sail 
being raised. 

I don't remember whether you have heard of 
the new telescope at Cambridge or not. They 
think it is the best one in the world, and have 
already seen more than Lord Rosse or Herschel. 
I went to see Perez Blood's, some time ago, with 
Mr. Emerson. He had not gone to bed, but was 
sitting in the woodshed, in the dark, alone, in 
liis astronomical chair, which is all legs and 
rounds, with a seat which can be inserted at any 
height. We saw Saturn's rings, and the moun- 
tains in the moon, and the shadows in their 
craters, and the sunlight on the spurs of the 
mountains in the dark portion, etc., etc. When 
I asked him the power of his glass, he said it 
was 85. But what is the power of the Cam- 



160 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

bridge glass ? 2000 ! ! ! The last is about twenty- 
three feet long. 

I think you may have a grand time this win- 
ter pursuing some study, keeping a journal, 
or the like, while the snow lies deep without. 
Winter is the time for study, you know, and the 
colder it is the more studious we are. Give my 
respects to the whole Penobscot tribe, and tell 
them that I trust we are good brothers still, and 
endeavor to keep the chain of friendship bright, 
though I do dig up a hatchet now and then. I 
trust you will not stir from your comfortable 
winter quarters, Miss Bruin, or even put your 
head out of your hollow tree, till the sun has 
melted the snow in the spring, and " the green 
buds, they are a-swellin'." 

From your BROTHER HENRY. 

This letter will explain some of the allusions 
in the first letter to Emerson in England. Perez 
Blood was a rural astronomer living in the ex- 
treme north quarter of Concord, next to Carlisle, 
with his two maiden sisters, in the midst of a 
fine oak wood ; their cottage being one of the 
points in view when Thoreau and his friends 
took their afternoon rambles. Sophia Thoreau, 
the younger and soon the only surviving sister, 
was visiting her cousins in Maine, the " Penob- 
scot tribe" of whom the letter makes mention, 



r. 30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 161 

with an allusion to the Indians of that name near 
Bangor. His letter to her and those which fol- 
low were written from Emerson's house, where 
Thoreau lived during the master's absence across 
the ocean. It was in the orchard of this house 
that Alcott was building that summer-house at 
which Thoreau, with his geometrical eye, makes 
merry in the next letter. 

TO R. W. EMERSON (iN ENGLAND). 

CONCORD, November 14, 1847. 

DEAR FRIEND, I am but a poor neighbor 
to you here, a very poor companion am I. I 
understand that very well, but that need not 
prevent my writing to you now. I have almost 
never written letters in my life, yet I think I 
can write as good ones as I frequently see, so I 
shall not hesitate to write this, such as it may 
be, knowing that you will welcome anything that 
reminds you of Concord. 

I have banked up the young trees against the 
winter and the mice, and I will look out, in my 
careless way, to see when a pale is loose or a 
nail drops out of its place. The broad gaps, at 
least, I will occupy. I heartily wish I could be 
of good service to this household. But I, who 
have only used these ten digits so long to solve 
the problem of a living, how can I ? The world 
is a cow that is hard to milk, life does not 



162 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

come so easy, and oh, how thinly it is watered 
ere we get it ! But the young bunting calf, he 
will get at it. There is no way so direct. This 
is to earn one's living by the sweat of his brow. 
It is a little like joining a community, this life, 
to such a hermit as I am ; and as I don't keep 
the accounts, I don't know whether the experi- 
ment will succeed or fail finally. At any rate, 
it is good for society, so I do not regret my tran- 
sient nor my permanent share in it. 

Lidian [Mrs. Emerson] and I make very good 
housekeepers. She is a very dear sister to me. 
Ellen and Edith and Eddy and Aunty Brown 
keep up the tragedy and comedy and tragic-com- 
edy of life as usual. The two former have not 
forgotten their old acquaintance; even Edith 
carries a young memory in her head, I find. 
Eddy can teach us all how to pronounce. If 
you should discover any rare hoard of wooden 
or pewter horses, I have no doubt he will know 
how to appreciate it. He occasionally surveys 
mankind from my shoulders as wisely as ever 
Johnson did. I respect him not a little, though 
it is I that lift him up so unceremoniously. And 
sometimes I have to set him down again in a 
hurry, according to his "mere will and good 
pleasure." He very seriously asked me, the 
other day, " Mr. Thoreau, will you be my fa- 
ther ? " I am occasionally Mr. Rough-and-tum- 



*r.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 163 

ble with him that I may not miss Aim, and lest 
he should miss you too much. So you must 
come back soon, or you will be superseded. 

Alcott has heard that I laughed, and so set 
the people laughing, at his arbor, though I never 
laughed louder than when I was on the ridge- 
pole. But now I have not laughed for a long 
time, it is so serious. He is very grave to look 
at. But, not knowing all this, I strove inno- 
cently enough, the other day, to engage his at- 
tention to my mathematics. "Did you ever 
study geometry, the relation of straight lines to 
curves, the transition from the finite to the infi- 
nite ? Fine things about it in Newton and Leib- 
nitz." But he would hear none of it, men of 
taste preferred the natural curve. Ah, he is a 
crooked stick himself. He is getting on now so 
many knots an hour. There is one knot at pres- 
ent occupying the point of highest elevation, 
the present highest point; and as many knots 
as are not handsome, I presume, are thrown 
down and cast into the pines. Pray show him 
this if you meet him anywhere in London, for I 
cannot make him hear much plainer words here. 
He forgets that I am neither old nor young, nor 
anything in particular, and behaves as if I had 
still some of the animal heat in me. As for the 
building, I feel a little oppressed when I come 
near it It has no great disposition to be beau- 



164 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

tiful; it is certainly a wonderful structure, on 
the whole, and the fame of the architect will 
endure as long as it shall stand. I should not 
show you this side alone, if I did not suspect 
that Lidian had done complete justice to the 
other. 

Mr. [Edmund] Hosmer has been working at 
a tannery in Stow for a fortnight, though he has 
just now come home sick. It seems that he was 
a tanner in his youth, and so he has made up 
his mind a little at last. This comes of reading 
the New Testament. Was n't one of the Apos- 
tles a tanner ? Mrs. Hosmer remains here, and 
John looks stout enough to fill his own shoes 
and his father's too. 

Mr. Blood and his company have at length 
seen the stars through the great telescope, and 
he told me that he thought it was worth the 
while. Mr. Peirce made him wait till the crowd 
had dispersed (it was a Saturday evening), and 
then was quite polite, conversed with him, and 
showed him the micrometer, etc. ; and he said 
Mr. Blood's glass was large enough for all ordi- 
nary astronomical work. [Rev.] Mr. Frost and 
Dr. [Josiah] Bartlett seemed disappointed that 
there was no greater difference between the 
Cambridge glass and the Concord one. They 
used only a power of 400. Mr. Blood tells me 
that he is too old to study the calculus or higher 



r.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 165 

mathematics. At Cambridge they think that 
they have discovered traces of another satellite 
to Neptune. They have been obliged to exclude 
the public altogether, at last. The very dust 
which they raised, " which is filled with minute 
crystals," etc., as professors declare, having to 
be wiped off the glasses, would erelong wear 
them away. It is true enough, Cambridge col- 
lege is really beginning to wake up and redeem 
its character and overtake the age. I see by the 
catalogue that they are about establishing a sci- 
entific school in connection with the university, 
at which any one above eighteen, on paying one 
hundred dollars annually (Mr. Lawrence's fifty 
thousand dollars will probably diminish this sum), 
may be instructed in the highest branches of 
science, in astronomy, "theoretical and prac- 
tical, with the use of the instruments " (so the 
great Yankee astronomer may be born without 
delay), in mechanics and engineering to the last 
degree. Agassiz will erelong commence his lec- 
tures in the zoological department. A chemistry 
class has already been formed under the direc- 
tion of Professor Horsford. A new and ade- 
quate building for the purpose is already being 
erected. They have been foolish enough to put 
at the end of all this earnest the old joke of a 
diploma. Let every sheep keep but his own 
skin, I say. 



166 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

I have had a tragic correspondence, for the 

most part all on one side, with Miss . She 

did really wish to I hesitate to write marry 
me. That is the way they spell it. Of course 
I did not write a deliberate answer. How could 
I deliberate upon it? I sent back as distinct a 
no as I have learned to pronounce after consid- 
erable practice, and I trust that this no has suc- 
ceeded. Indeed, I wished that it might burst, 
like hollow shot, after it had struck and buried 
itself and made itself felt there. There was no 
other way. I really had anticipated no such foe 
as this in my career. 

I suppose you will like to hear of my book, 
though I have nothing worth writing about it. 
Indeed, for the last month or two I have forgot- 
ten it, but shall certainly remember it again. 
Wiley & Putnam, Munroe, the Harpers, and 
Crosby & Nichols have all declined printing it 
with the least risk to themselves ; but Wiley & 
Putnam will print it in their series, and any of 
them, anywhere, at my risk. If I liked the book 
well enough, I should not delay; but for the 
present I am indifferent. I believe this is, after 
all, the course you advised, to let it lie. 

I do not know what to say of myself. I sit 
before my green desk, in the chamber at the 
head of the stairs, and attend to my thinking, 
sometimes more, sometimes less distinctly. I 



*r.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 167 

am not unwilling to think great thoughts if 
there are any in the wind, but what they are I 
am not sure. They suffice to keep me awake 
while the day lasts, at any rate. Perhaps they 
will redeem some portion of the night erelong. 

I can imagine you astonishing, bewildering, 
confounding, and sometimes delighting John 
Bull with your Yankee notions, and that he be- 
gins to take a pride in the relationship at last ; 
introduced to all the stars of England in succes- 
sion, after the lecture, until you pine to thrust 
your head once more into a genuine and unques- 
tionable nebula, if there be any left. I trust a 
common man will be the most uncommon to you 
before you return to these parts. I have thought 
there was some advantage even in death, by 
which we " mingle with the herd of common 
men." 

Hugh [the gardener] still has his eye on the 
Walden agellum^ and orchards are waving there 
in the windy future for him. That 's the where- 
I '11-go-next, thinks he ; but no important steps 
are yet taken. He reminds me occasionally of 
tin- open secret of his, with which the very sea- 
son seems to labor, and affirms seriously that as 
to his wants wood, stone, or timber I know 
better than he. That is a clincher which I shall 
have to avoid to some extent ; but I fear that 
it is a wrought nail and will not break. Un-

fortunately, the day after cattle show the day 
after small beer he was among the missing, 
but not long this time. The Ethiopian cannot 
change his skin nor the leopard his spots, nor 
indeed Hugh his Hugh. 

As I walked over Conantum, the other after- 
noon, I saw a fair column of smoke rising from 
the woods directly over my house that was (as 
I judged), and already began to conjecture if 
my deed of sale would not be made invalid by 
this. But it turned out to be John Richardson's 
young wood, on the southeast of your field. It 
was burnt nearly all over, and up to the rails 
and the road. It was set on fire, no doubt, by 
the same Lucifer that lighted Brooks's lot be- 
fore. So you see that your small lot is compar- 
atively safe for this season, the back fire having 
been already set for you. 

They have been choosing between John Keyes 
and Sam Staples, if the world wants to know it, 
as representative of this town, and Staples is 
chosen. The candidates for governor think of 
my writing this to you ! were Governor Briggs 
and General Gushing, and Briggs is elected, 
though the Democrats have gained. Ain't I a 
brave boy to know so much of politics for the 
nonce ? But I should n't have known it if 
Coombs hadn't told me. They have had a 
peace meeting here, I should n't think of

telling you if I didn't know anything would 
do for the English market, and some men, 
Deacon Brown at the head, have signed a long 
pledge, swearing that they will " treat all man- 
kind as brothers henceforth." I think I shall 
wait and see how they treat me first. I think 
that Nature meant kindly when she made our 
brothers few. However, my voice is still for 
peace. So good-by, and a truce to all joking, 
my dear friend, from 

H. D. T. 

Upon this letter some annotations are to be 
made. " Eddy " was Emerson's youngest child, 
Edward Waldo, then three years old and up- 
ward, of late years his father's biographer. 
Hugh, the gardener, of whom more anon, bar- 
gained for the house of Thoreau on Emerson's 
land at Walden, and for a field to go with it ; 
but the bargain came to naught, and the cabin 
was removed three or four miles to the north- 
west, where it became a granary for Farmer 
Clark and his squirrels, near the entrance to the 
park known as Estabrook's. Edmund Hosmer 
was the farming friend and neighbor with whom, 
at one time, G. W. Curtis and his brother took 
lodgings, and at another time the Alcott family. 
The book in question was " A Week on the 
Concord and Merrimack Rivers." 



170 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

To these letters Emerson replied from Eng- 
land : 

DEAR HENRY, Very welcome in the parcel 
was your letter, very precious your thoughts and 
tidings. It is one of the best things connected 
with my coming hither that you could and would 
keep the homestead ; that fireplace shines all the 
brighter, and has a certain permanent glimmer 
therefor. Thanks, ever more thanks for the 
kindness which I well discern to the youth of 
the house : to my darling little horseman of 
pewter, wooden, rocking, and what other breeds, 
destined, I hope, to ride Pegasus yet, and, I 
hope, not destined to be thrown ; to Edith, who 
long ago drew from you verses which I carefully 
preserve ; and to Ellen, whom by speech, and 
now by letter, I find old enough to be compan- 
ionable, and to choose and reward her own 
friends in her own fashions. She sends me a 
poem to-day, which I have read three times ! 

TO B. W. EMERSON (iN ENGLAND). 

CONCORD, December 15, 1847. 

DEAR FRIEND, You are not so far off but 
the affairs of this world still attract you. Per- 
haps it will be so when we are dead. Then 
look out. Joshua R. Holman, of Harvard, who 
says he lived a month with [Charles] Lane at 



r.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 171 

Fruitlands, wishes to hire said Lane's farm for 
one or more years, and will pay $125 rent, tak- 
ing out of the same a half, if necessary, for 
repairs, as for a new bank-wall to the barn 
cellar, which he says is indispensable. Palmer is 
gone, Mrs. Palmer is going. This is all that is 
known or that is worth knowing. Yes or no ? 
What to do? 

Hugh's plot begins to thicken. He starts 
thus : eighty dollars on one side ; Walden, field 
and house, on the other. How to bring these 
together so as to make a garden and a palace ? 

1 House 

$80 Field [J

too 

Save $20 by all means, to measure the field, and you have 

left 
$40 to complete the palace, build cellar, and dig well. 

Hiiild the cellar yourself, and let well alone, 

and now how does it stand ? 
$40 to complete the palace somewhat like 

this. 



172 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

For when one asks, " Why do you want twice 
as much room more ? " the reply is, " Parlor, 
kitchen, and bedroom, these make the pal- 
ace." 

" Well, Hugh, what will you do ? Here are 
forty dollars to buy a new house, twelve feet by 
twenty-five, and add it to the old." 

" Well, Mr. Thoreau, as I tell you, I know 
no more than a child about it. It shall be just 
as you say." 

"Then build it yourself, get it roofed, and 
get in. 

" Commence at one end and leave it half done, 
And let time finish what money 's begun." 

So you see we have forty dollars for a nest 
egg ; sitting on which, Hugh and I alternately 
and simultaneously, there may in course of time 
be hatched a house that will long stand, and 
perchance even lay fresh eggs one day for its 
owner ; that is, if, when he returns, he gives the 
young chick twenty dollars or more in addition, 
by way of " swichin," to give it a start in the 
world. 

The " Massachusetts Quarterly Review " came 
out the 1st of December, but it does not seem 
to be making a sensation, at least not here- 
abouts. I know of none in Concord who take 
or have seen it yet. 

We wish to get by all possible means some

notion of your success or failure in England, 
more than your two letters have furnished. Can't 
you send a fair sample both of young and of 
old England's criticism, if there is any printed? 
Alcott and [Ellery] Channing are equally 
greedy with myself. 

HENRY THOREAU. 

C. T. Jackson takes the Quarterly (new one), 
and will lend it to us. Are you not going to 
send your wife some news of your good or ill 
success by the newspapers ? 

TO R. W. EMERSON (iN ENGLAND). 

CONCORD, December 29, 1847. 

MY DEAR FRIEND, I thank you for your 
letter. I was very glad to get it; and I am 
glad again to write to you. However slow the 
steamer, no time intervenes between the writing 
and the reading of thoughts, but they come 
freshly to the most distant port. I am here 
still, and very glad to be here, and shall not 
trouble you with any complaints because I do 
not fill my place better. I have had many good 
hours in the chamber at the head of the stairs, 
a solid time, it seems to me. Next week I am 
going to give an account to the Lyceum of my 
expedition to Maine. Theodore Parker lectures 
to-night. We have had Whipple on Genius, 



174 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1847, 

too weighty a subject for him, with his antitheti- 
cal definitions new-vamped, what it i.s, what it 
is not, but altogether what it is not ; cuffing it this 
way and cuffing it that, as if it were an India- 
rubber ball. Really, it is a subject which should 
expand, expand, accumulate itself before the 
speaker's eyes as he goes on, like the snowballs 
which the boys roll in the street ; and when it 
stops, it should be so large that he cannot start 
it, but must leave it there. [H. N.] Hudson, 
too, has been here, with a dark shadow in the 
core of him, and his desperate wit, so much in- 
debted to the surface of him, wringing out his 
words and snapping them off like a dish-cloth ; 
very remarkable, but not memorable. Singular 
that these two best lecturers should have so 
much " wave " in their timber, their solid 
parts to be made and kept solid by shrinkage 
and contraction of the whole, with consequent 
checks and fissures. 

Ellen and I have a good understanding. I 
appreciate her genuineness. Edith tells me after 
her fashion : " By and by I shall grow up and 
be a woman, and then I shall remember how you 
exercised me." Eddy has been to Boston to 
Christmas, but can remember nothing but the 
coaches, all Kendall's coaches. There is no 
variety of that vehicle that he is not familiar 
with. He did try twice to tell us something

else, but, after thinking and stuttering a long 
time, said, " I don't know what the word is," 
the one word, forsooth, that would have disposed 
of all that Boston phenomenon. If you did not 
know him better than I, I could tell you more. 
He is a good companion for me, and I- am glad 
that we are all natives of Concord. It is young 
Concord. Look out, World ! 

Mr. Alcott seems to have sat down for the 
winter. He has got Plato and other books to 
read. He is as large-featured and hospitable to 
traveling thoughts and thinkers as ever; but 
with the same Connecticut philosophy as ever, 
mingled with what is better. If he would only 
stand upright and toe the line ! though he 
were to put off several degrees of largeness, and 
put on a considerable degree of littleness. After 
all, I think we must call him particularly your 
man. 

I have pleasant walks and talks with Chan- 
ning. James Clark the Swedenborgian that 
was is at the poorhouse, insane with too large 
views, so that he cannot support himself. I see 
him working with Fred and the rest. Better 
than be there and not insane. It is strange that 
they will make ado when a man's body is buried, 
but not when he thus really and tragically dies, 
or seems to die. Away with your funeral pro-

cessions, into the ballroom with them ! I hear 
the bell toll hourly over there. 1 

Lidian and I have a standing quarrel as to 
what is a suitable state of preparedness for a 
traveling professor's visit, or for whomsoever 
else ; but further than this we are not at war. 
We have made up a dinner, we have made up a 
bed, we have made up a party, and our own 
minds and mouths, three several times for your 
professor, and he came not. Three several tur- 
keys have died the death, which I myself carved, 
just as if he had been there ; and the company, 
too, convened and demeaned themselves accord- 
ingly. Everything was done up in good style, I 
assure you, with only the part of the professor 
omitted. To have seen the preparation (though 
Lidian says it was nothing extraordinary) I 
should certainly have said he was a-coming, but 
he did not. He must have found out some 
shorter way to Turkey, some overland route, 
I think. By the way, he was complimented, at 
the conclusion of his course in Boston, by the 
mayor moving the appointment of a committee 
to draw up resolutions expressive, etc., which 
was done. 

I have made a few verses lately. Here are 
some, though perhaps not the best, at any rate

they are the shortest, on that universal theme, 
yours as well as mine, and several other peo- 
ple's : 

The good how can we trust ! 

Only the wise are just. 

The good, we use, 

The wise we cannot choose ; 

These there are none above. 

The good, they know and love, 

But are not known again 

By those of lesser ken. 

They do not choose us with their eyes, 

But they transfix with their advice ; 

No partial sympathy they feel 

With private woe or private weal, 

But with the universe joy and sigh, 

Whose knowledge is their sympathy.

TO R. W. EMERSON (iN ENGLAND). 

CONCORD, January 12, 1848. 

It is hard to believe that England is so near 
as from your letters it appears ; and that this 
identical piece of paper has lately come all the 
way from there hither, begrimed with the Eng- 
lish dust which made you hesitate to use it; 
from England, which is only historical fairyland 



178 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT, C1848, 

to me, to America, which I have put my spade 
into, and about which there is no doubt. 

I thought that you needed to be informed of 
Hugh's progress. He has moved his house, as 
I told you, and dug his cellar, and purchased 
stone of Sol Wetherbee for the last, though he 
has not hauled it ; all which has cost sixteen dol- 
lars, which I have paid. He has also, as next in 
order, run away from Concord without a penny 
in his pocket, " crying " by the way, having 
had another long difference with strong beer, 
and a first one, I suppose, with his wife, who 
seems to have complained that he sought other 
society ; the one difference leading to the other, 
perhaps, but I don't know which was the leader. 
He writes back to his wife from Sterling, near 
Worcester, where he is chopping wood, his dis- 
tantly kind reproaches to her, which I read 
straight through to her (not to his bottle, which 
he has with him, and no doubt addresses orally). 
He says that he will go on to the South in the 
spring, and will never return to Concord. Per- 
haps he will not. Life is not tragic enough for 
him, and he must try to cook up a more highly 
seasoned dish for himself. Towns which keep a 
barroom and a gun-house and a reading-room, 
should also keep a steep precipice whereoff im- 
patient soldiers may jump. His sun went down, 
to me, bright and steady enough in the west, but 



*r.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 179 

it never came up in the east. Night intervened. 
He departed, as when a man dies suddenly ; and 
perhaps wisely, if he was to go, without settling 
his affairs. They knew that that was a thin soil 
and not well calculated for pears. Nature is 
rare and sensitive on the score of nurseries. 
You may cut down orchards and grow forests at 
your pleasure. Sand watered with strong beer, 
though stirred with industry, will not produce 
grapes. He dug his cellar for the new part too 
near the old house, Irish like, though I warned 
him, and it has caved and let one end of the 
house down. Such is the state of his domestic 
affairs. I laugh with the Parcae only. He had 
got the upland and the orchard and a part of 
the meadow ploughed by Warren, at an expense 
of eight dollars, still unpaid, which of course is 
no affair of yours. 

I think that if an honest and small-familied 
man, who has no affinity for moisture in him, 
but who has an affinity for sand, can be found, 
it would be safe to rent him the shanty as it is, 
and the land ; or you cap very easily and simply 
let nature keep them still, without great loss. It 
may be so mann<;r<l. |>< -rhaps, as to be a home 
for somebody, who shall in return serve you as 
fencing stuff, and to fix and locate your lot, as 
we plant a tree in the sand or on the edge of a 
stream ; without expense to yon in the mean 



180 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

while, and without disturbing its possible future 
value. 

I read a part of the story of ray excursion to 
Ktaadn to quite a large audience of men and 
boys, the other night, whom it interested. It 
contains many facts and some poetry. I have 
also written what will do for a lecture on 
" Friendship." 

I think that the article on you in Blackwood's 
is a good deal to get from the reviewers, the 
first purely literary notice, as I remember. The 
writer is far enough off, in every sense, to speak 
with a certain authority. It is a better judg- 
ment of posterity than the public had. It is 
singular how sure he is to be mystified by any 
uncommon sense. But it was generous to put 
Plato into the list of mystics. His confessions 
on this subject suggest several thoughts, which 
I have not room to express here. The old word 
seer, I wonder what the reviewer thinks that 
means ; whether that he was a man who could 
see more than himself. 

I was struck by Ellen's asking me, yesterday, 
while I was talking with Mrs. Brown, if I did 
lot use " colored words." She said that she 
could tell the color of a great many words, and 
amused the children at school by so doing. 
Eddy climbed up the sofa, the other day, of his 
own accord, and kissed the picture of his father, 
" right on his shirt, I did." 



er.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 181 

I had a good talk with Alcott this afternoon. 
He is certainly the youngest man of his age we 
have seen, just on the threshold of life. When 
I looked at his gray hairs, his conversation 
sounded pathetic ; but I looked again, and they 
reminded me of the gray dawn. He is getting 
better acquainted with Channing, though he 
says that, if they were to live in the same house, 
they would soon sit with their backs to each 
other. 1 

You must excuse me if I do not write with 
sufficient directness to yourself, who are a far- 
off traveler. It is a little like shooting on the 
wing, I confess. 

FarewelL HENBT THOREAU. 

TO R. W. EMERSON (iN ENGLAND). 

CONCORD, February 23, 1848. 

DEAR WALDO, For I think I have heard 
that that is your name, my letter which was 
put last into the leathern bag arrived first. 
Whatever I may call you, 1 know you better 
than I know your name, and what becomes of 
the fittest name if in any sense you are here 

1 At this date Alcott had pained his forty-eighth year, 
while Channing and Thorean were still in the latitude of 
thirty. Hawthorne had left Concord, and wan in the Salem 
Custom-holme ; the Old Manse having gone back into the occu- 
pancy of Emerson's cousins, the Ripleys, who owned it

with him who calls, and not there simply to 
be called ? 

I believe I never thanked you for your lec- 
tures, one and all, which I heard formerly read 
here in Concord. I know I never have. There 
was some excellent reason each time why I did 
not ; but it will never be too late. I have that 
advantage, at least, over you in my education. 

Lidian is too unwell to write to you ; so I 
must tell you what I can about the children and 
herself. I am afraid she has not told you how 
unwell she is, or to-day perhaps we may say 
has been. She has been confined to her cham- 
ber four or five weeks, and three or four weeks, 
at least, to her bed, with the jaundice. The 
doctor, who comes once a day, does not let her 
read (nor can she now) nor hear much read- 
ing. She has written her letters to you, till re- 
cently, sitting up in bed, but he said he would 
not come again if she did so. She has Abby 
and Almira to take care of her, and Mrs. Brown 
to read to her ; and I also, occasionally, have 
something to read or to say. The doctor says 
she must not expect to " take any comfort of 
her life " for a week or two yet. She wishes me 
to say that she has written two long and full 
letters to you about the household economies, 
etc., which she hopes have not been delayed. 
The children are quite well and full of spirits, 



*r.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 183 

and are going through a regular course of pic- 
ture-seeing, with commentary by me, every even- 
ing, for Eddy's behoof. All the Annuals and 
" Diadems " are in requisition, and Eddy is for- 
ward to exclaim, when the hour arrives, " Now 
for the demdems ! " I overheard this dialogue 
when Frank [Brown] came down to breakfast 
the other morning. 

Eddy. " Why, Frank, I am astonished that 
you should leave your boots in the dining-room." 

Frank. " I guess you mean surprised, don't 
you ? " 

Eddy. " No, boots ! " 

" If Waldo were here," said he, the other 
night, at bedtime, " we 'd be four going up- 
stairs." Would he like to tell papa anything ? 
No, not anything ; but finally, yes, he would, 
that one of the white horses in his new ba- 
rouche is broken ! Ellen and Edith will per- 
haps speak fur themselves, as I hear something 
about letters to be written by them. 

Mr. Alcott seems to be reading well this win- 
ter : Plato, Montaigne, Ben Jonson, Beaumont 
and FlftcluT, Sir Thomas Browne, etc., etc. 
" I believe I have read them all now, or nearly 
all," those English authors. He is rallying 
for another foray with his pen, in his Litter 
years, not discouraged by the past, into that 
crowd of unexpressed iiK-as of his, that undis-

ciplined Parthian army, which, as soon as a Ro- 
man soldier would face, retreats on all hands, 
occasionally firing backwards ; easily routed, not 
easily subdued, hovering on the skirts of society. 
Another summer shall not be devoted to the 
raising of vegetables (Arbors?) which rot in 
the cellar for want of consumers ; but perchance 
to the arrangement of the material, the brain- 
crop which the winter has furnished. I have 
good talks with him. His respect for Carlyle 
has been steadily increasing for some time. He 
has read him with new sympathy and apprecia- 
tion. 

I see Channing often. He also goes often 
to Alcott's, and confesses that he has made a 
discovery in him, and gives vent to his admira- 
tion or his confusion in characteristic exaggera- 
tion ; but between this extreme and that you 
may get a fair report, and draw an inference 
if you can. Sometimes he will ride a broom- 
stick still, though there is nothing to keep him, 
or it, up but a certain centrifugal force of whim, 
which is soon spent, and there lies your stick, 
not worth picking up to sweep an oven with 
now. His accustomed path is strewn with them. 
But then again, and perhaps for the most part, 
he sits on the Cliffs amid the lichens, or flits 
past on noiseless pinion, like the barred owl in 
the daytime, as wise and unobserved. He 



jrr.30.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 185 

brought me a poem the other day, for me, on 
Walden Hermitage : not remarkable. 1 

Lectures begin to multiply on my desk. I 
have one on Friendship which is new, and the 
materials of some others. I read one last week 
to the Lyceum, on The Rights and Duties of 
the Individual in Relation to Government, 
much to Mr. Alcott's satisfaction. 

Joel Brit ton has failed and gone into chan- 
cery, but the woods continue to fall before the 
axes of other men. Neighbor Coombs 2 was 
lately found dead in the woods near Goose Pond, 
with his half-empty jug, after he had been riot- 
ing a week. Hugh, by the last accounts, was 
still in Worcester County. Mr. Hosmer, who 
is himself again, and living in Concord, has just 
hauled the rest of your wood, amounting to about 
ten and a half cords. 

The newspapers say that they have printed a 
pirated edition of your Essays in England. Is 
it as bad as they say, and undisguised and un- 
mitigated piracy ? I thought that the printed 
scrap would entertain Carlyle, notwithstanding 
its history. If this generation will see out of 
its hind-head, why then you may turn your back

This stands written in your day-book : " Sep-

If you have any directions to give about the 
trees, you must not forget that spring will soon 
be upon us. 

Farewell. From your friend,

Before a reply came to this letter, Thoreau 
had occasion to write to Mr. Elliot Cabot again. 
The allusions to the " Week" and to the Walden 
house are interesting. 

TO ELLIOT CABOT. 

CONCORD, March 8, 1848. 

DEAR SIR, Mr. Emerson's address is as 
yet, " R. W. Emerson, care of Alexander Ire- 
land, Esq., Examiner Office, Manchester, Eng- 
land." We had a letter from him on Monday, 
dated at Manchester, February 10, and he was 
then preparing to go to Edinburgh the next 



*r.30.J TO ELLIOT CABOT. 187 

day, where he was to lecture. He thought that 
he should get through his northern journeying 
by the 25th of February, and go to London to 
spend March and April, and if he did not go to 
Paris in May, then coine home. He has been 
eminently successful, though the papers this side 
of the water have been so silent about his ad- 
ventures. 

My book, 1 fortunately, did not find a pub- 
lisher ready to undertake it, and you can im- 
agine the effect of delay on an author's estimate 
of his own work. However, I like it well enough 
to mend it, and shall look at it again directly 
when I have dispatched some other things. 

I have been writing lectures for our own Ly- 
ceum this winter, mainly for my own pleasure 
and advantage. I esteem it a rare happiness 
to be able to write anything, but there (if I 
ever get there) my concern for it is apt to end. 
Time & Co. are, after all, the only quite honest 
and trustworthy publishers that we know. I 
can sympathize, perhaps, with the barberry 

1 From England Emerson wrote : "I am not of opinion 
that your book tihotild be delayed a month. I should print it 
at mi'-'-, nor do I think that you would incur any risk in doing 
so that you cannot well afford. It in very certain to have 
leaden and debtors, here as well as there. The Dial in ab- 
minlly well known here. We at home, I think, ore always a 
little ashamed of it, / am, and yet IH-IV it is spoken of 
with the utmost gravity, and I do not laugh."

bush, whose business it is solely to ripen its 
fruit (though that may not be to sweeten it) 
and to protect it with thorns, so that it holds 
on all winter, even, unless some hungry crows 
come to pluck it. But I see that I must get a 
few dollars together presently to manure my 
roots. Is your journal able to pay anything, 
provided it likes an article well enough? I do 
not promise one. At any rate, I mean always 
to spend only words enough to purchase silence 
with ; and I have found that this, which is so 
valuable, though many writers do not prize it, 
does not cost much, after all. 

I have not obtained any more of the mice 
which I told you were so numerous in my cellar, 
as my house was removed immediately after I 
saw you, and I have been living in the village 
since. 

However, if I should happen to meet with any- 
thing rare, I will forward it to you. I thank 
you for your kind offers, and will avail myself 
of them so far as to ask if you can anywhere 
borrow for me for a short time the copy of the 
" Revue des Deux Mondes," containing a notice 
of Mr. Emerson. I should like well to read it, 
and to read it to Mrs. Emerson and others. If 
this book is not easy to be obtained, do not by 
any means trouble yourself about it.

CONCORD, March 23, 1848. 

DEAR FRIEND, Lidiau says I must write a 
sentence about the children. Eddy says he can- 
not sing, " not till mother is a-going to be 
well." We shall hear his voice very soon, in 
that case, I trust. Ellen is already thinking 
what will be done when you come home ; but 
then she thinks it will be some loss that I shall 
go away. Edith says that I shall come and see 
them, and always at tea-time, so that I can play 
with her. Ellen thinks she likes father best 
because he jumps her sometimes. This is the 
latest news from 

Yours, etc., HENRY. 

P. S. I have received three newspapers from 
you duly which I have not acknowledged. There 
is an anti-Sabbath convention held in Boston 
to-day, to which Alcott has gone. 

That friend to whom Thoreau wrote most con- 
stantly and fully, on all topics, was Mr. Harri- 
son Blake of Worcester, a graduate of Harvard 
two years earlier than Thoreau, in the same

class with two other young men from Concord, 
E. R Hoar and H. B. Dennis. This cir- 
cumstance may have led to Mr. Blake's visiting 
the town occasionally, before his intimacy with 
its poet-naturalist began, in the year 1848. At 
that time, as Thoreau wrote to Horace Greeley, 
he had been supporting himself for five years 
wholly by the labor of his hands ; his Walden 
hermit-life was over, yet neither its record nor 
the first book had been published, and Thoreau 
was known in literature chiefly by his papers in 
the " Dial," which had then ceased for four 
years. In March, 1848, Mr. Blake read Tho- 
reau's chapter on Persius in the "Dial" for 
July, 1840, and though he had read it before, 
without being much impressed by it, he now 
found in it "pure depth and solidity of thought." 
" It has revived in me," he wrote to Thoreau, 
" a haunting impression of you, which I carried 
away from some spoken words of yours. . . . 
When I was last in Concord, you spoke of retir- 
ing farther from our civilization. I asked you 
if you would feel no longings for the society of 
your friends. Your reply was in substance, ' No, 
I am nothing.' That reply was memorable to 
me. It indicated a depth of resources, a com- 
pleteness of renunciation, a poise and repose in 
the universe, which to me is almost inconceiva- 
ble ; which in you seemed domesticated, and to 



jrr.30.] BLAKE TO THOREAU. 191 

which I look up with veneration. I would know 
of that soul which can say * I am nothing.' I 
would be roused by its words to a truer and 
purer life. Upon me seems to be dawning with 
new significance the idea that God is here ; that 
we have but to bow before Him in profound sub- 
mission at every moment, and He will fill our 
souls with his presence. In this opening of the 
soul to God, all duties seem to centre ; what else 
have we to do ? . . . If I understand rightly the 
significance of your life, this is it : You would 
sunder yourself from society, from the spell of 
institutions, customs, conventionalities, that you 
may lead a fresh, simple life with God. Instead 
of breathing a new life into the old forms, you 
would have a new life without and within. 
There is something sublime to me in this atti- 
tude, far as I may be from it myself. . . . 
Speak to me in this hour as you are prompted. 
... I honor you because you abstain from ac- 
tion, and open your soul that you may be some- 
what. Amid a world of noisy, shallow actors it 
is noble to stand aside and say, I will simply 
6e.' Could I plant myself at once upon the 
truth, reducing my wants to their minimum, 
... I should at once be brought nearer to na- 
ture, nearer to my fellow-men, and life would 
be infinitely richer. But, alas ! I shiver on the 
brink." 



192 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

Thus appealed to by one who had so well at- 
tained the true Transcendental shibboleth, 
" God working in us, both to will and to do," 
Thoreau could not fail to make answer, as he 
did at once, and thus : 

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 
[The first of many letters.] 

CONCORD, March 27, 1848. 

I am glad to hear that any words of mine, 
though spoken so long ago that I can hardly 
claim identity with their author, have reached 
you. It gives me pleasure, because I have there- 
fore reason to suppose that I have uttered what 
concerns men, and that it is not in vain that 
man speaks to man. This is the value of litera- 
ture. Yet those days are so distant, in every 
sense, that I have had to look at that page again, 
to learn what was the tenor of my thoughts then. 
I should value that article, however, if only be- 
cause it was the occasion of your letter. 

I do believe that the outward and the inward 
life correspond ; that if any should succeed to 
live a higher life, others would not know of it ; 
that difference and distance are one. To set 
about living a true life is to go a journey to a 
distant country, gradually to find ourselves sur- 
rounded by new scenes and men ; and as long 
as the old are around me, I know that I am not 



*r.30.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 193 

in any true sense living a new or a better life. 
The outward is only the outside of that which is 
within. Men are not concealed under habits, 
but are revealed by them ; they are their true 
clothes. I care not how curious a reason they 
may give for their abiding by them. Circum- 
stances are not rigid and unyielding, but our 
habits are rigid. We are apt to speak vaguely 
sometimes, as if a divine life were to be grafted 
on to or built over this present as a suitable 
foundation. This might do if we could so build 
over our old life as to exclude from it all the 
warmth of our affection, and addle it, as the 
thrush builds over the cuckoo's egg, and lays 
her own atop, and hatches that only ; but the 
fact is, we so there is the partition hatch 
them both, and the cuckoo's always by a day 
first, and that young bird crowds the young 
thrushes out of the nest. No. Destroy the cuck- 
oo's egg, or build a new nest. 

Change is change. No new life occupies the 
old bodies ; they decay. It is born, and grows, 
and flourishes. Men very pathetically inform 
the old, accept and wear it Why put up with 
the almshouse when you may go to heaven ? It 
is embalming, no more. Let alone your oint- 
ments and your linen swathes, and go into an 
infant's body. You see in the catacombs of 
Egypt the result of that experiment, that is 
the end of it 



194 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

I do believe in simplicity. It is astonishing 
as well as sad, how many trivial affairs even the 
wisest man thinks he must attend to in a day ; 
how singular an affair he thinks he must omit. 
When the mathematician would solve a difficult 
problem, he first frees the equation of all incum- 
brances, and reduces it to its simplest terms. So 
simplify the problem of life, distinguish the ne- 
cessary and the real. Probe the earth to see 
where your main roots run. I would stand upon 
facts. Why not see, use our eyes ? Do men 
know nothing ? I know many men who, in com- 
mon things, are not to be deceived ; who trust 
no moonshine ; who count their money correctly, 
and know how to invest it ; who are said to be 
prudent and knowing, who yet will stand at a 
desk the greater part of their lives, as cashiers 
in banks, and glimmer and rust and finally go 
out there. If they know anything, what under 
the sun do they do that for ? Do they know 
what bread is ? or what it is for ? Do they know 
what life is? If they knew something, the places 
which know them now would know them no 
more forever. 

This, our respectable daily life, in which the 
man of common sense, the Englishman of the 
world, stands so squarely, and on which our in- 
stitutions are founded, is in fact the veriest illu- 
sion, and will vanish like the baseless fabric of 



r.30.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 195 

a vision ; but that faint glimmer of reality which 
sometimes illuminates the darkness of daylight 
for all men, reveals something more solid and 
enduring than adamant, which is in fact the cor- 
ner-stone of the world. 

Men cannot conceive of a state of things so 
fair that it cannot be realized. Can any man 
honestly consult his experience and say that it 
is so? Have we any facts to appeal to when we 
say that our dreams are premature ? Did you 
ever hear of a man who had striven all his life 
faithfully and singly toward an object and in no 
measure obtained it? If a man constantly as- 
pires, is he not elevated ? Did ever a man try 
heroism, magnanimity, truth, sincerity, and find 
that there was no advantage in them? that it 
was a vain endeavor ? Of course we do not ex- 
pect that our paradise will be a garden. We 
know not what we ask. To look at literature ; 
how many fine thoughts has every man had ! 
how few fine thoughts are expressed ! Yet we 
never have a fantasy so subtile and ethereal, but 
that talent merely, with more resolution and 
faithful persistency, after a thousand failures, 
might fix and engrave it in distinct and endur- 
ing words, and we should see that our dreams 
are the solidest facts that we know. But I speak 
not of dreams. 

What can be expressed in words can be ex- 
pressed in life.

My actual life is a fact, in view of which I 
have no occasion to congratulate myself ; but 
for my faith and aspiration I have respect. It 
is from these that I speak. Every man's position 
is in fact too simple to be described, I have 
sworn no oath. I have no designs on society, 
or nature, or God. I am simply what I am, or 
I begin to be that. I live in the present. I 
only remember the past, and anticipate the fu- 
ture. I love to live. I love reform better than 
its modes. There is no history of how bad be- 
came better. I believe something, and there is 
nothing else but that. I know that I am. I 
know that another is who knows more than I, 
who takes interest in me, whose creature, and 
yet whose kindred, in one sense, am I. I know 
that the enterprise is worthy. I know that 
things work well. I have heard no bad news. 

As for positions, combinations, and details, 
what are they? In clear weather, when we 
look into the heavens, what do we see but the 
sky and the sun ? 

If you would convince a man that he does 
wrong, do right. But do not care to convince 
him. Men will believe what they see. Let 
them see. 

Pursue, keep up with, circle round and round 
your life, as a dog does his master's chaise. Do 
what you love. Know your own bone ; gnaw at 



*r.30.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 197 

it, bury it, unearth it, and gnaw it still. Do not 
be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of 
much life so. Aim above morality. Be not 
simply good ; be good for something. All fa- 
bles, indeed, have their morals ; but the inno- 
cent enjoy the story. Let nothing come between 
you and the light. Respect men and brothers 
only. When you travel to the Celestial City, 
carry no letter of introduction. When you 
knock, ask to see God, none of the servants. 
In what concerns you much, do not think that 
you have companions : know that you are alone 
in the world. 

Thus I write at random. I need to see you, 
and I trust I shall, to correct ray mistakes. 
Perhaps you have some oracles for me.

CONCORD, May 2, 1848. 

** We must have our bread." But what is 
our bread ? Is it baker's bread ? Methinks it 
should be very home-made bread. What is our 
meat? Is it butcher's meat? What is that 
which we must have ? Is that bread which we 
are now earning sweet ? Is it not bread which 
has been suffered to sour, and then been sweet* 
ened with an alkali, which has undergone the 
vinous, acetous, and sometimes the putrid fer- 



198 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

mentation, and then been whitened with vitriol ? 
Is this the bread which we must have? Man 
must earn his bread by the sweat of his brow, 
truly, but also by the sweat of his brain within 
his brow. The body can feed the body only. 
I have tasted but little bread in my life. It 
has been mere grub and provender for the most 
part. Of bread that nourished the brain and 
the heart, scarcely any. There is absolutely 
none even on the tables of the rich. 

There is not one kind of food for all men. 
You must and you will feed those faculties 
which you exercise. The laborer whose body is 
weary does not require the same food with the 
scholar whose brain is weary. Men should not 
labor foolishly like brutes, but the brain and the 
body should always, or as much as possible, 
work and rest together, and then the work will 
be of such a kind that when the body is hungry 
the brain will be hungry also, and the same food 
will suffice for both ; otherwise the food which 
repairs the waste energy of the over-wrought 
body will oppress the sedentary brain, and the 
degenerate scholar will come to esteem all food 
vulgar, and all getting a living drudgery. 

How shall we earn our bread is a grave ques- 
tion; yet it is a sweet and inviting question. 
Let us not shirk it, as is usually done. It is 
the most important and practical question which 



*r.30.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 199 

is put to man. Let us not answer it hastily. 
Let us not be content to get our bread in some 
gross, careless, and hasty manner. Some men 
go a-hunting, some a-fishing, some a-gaming, 
some to war ; but none have so pleasant a time 
as they who in earnest seek to cam their bread. 
It is true actually as it is true really ; it is true 
materially as it is true spiritually, that they who 
seek honestly and sincerely, with all their hearts 
and lives and strength, to earn their bread, do 
earn it, and it is sure to be very sweet to them. 
A very little bread, a very few crumbs are 
enough, if it be of the right quality, for it is 
infinitely nutritious. Let each man, then, earn 
at least a crumb of bread for his body before he 
dies, and know the taste of it, that it is iden- 
tical with the bread of life, and that they both 
go down at one swallow. 

Our bread need not ever be sour or hard to 
digest. What Nature is to the mind she is also 
to the body. As she feeds my imagination, she 
will feed my body ; for what she says she means, 
and is ready to do. She is not simply beautiful 
to the poet's eye. Not only the rainbow and 
sunset are beautiful, but to be fed and clothed, 
sheltered and wanm-il uri^ht, are equally beau- 
tiful and inspiring. There is not necessarily 
any gross and ugly fact which may not be eradi- 
cated from the life of man. We should endeavor 



200 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

practically in our lives to correct all the defects 
which our imagination detects. The heavens are 
as deep as our aspirations are high. So high as 
a tree aspires to grow, so high it will find an 
atmosphere suited to it. Every man should 
stand for a force which is perfectly irresistible. 
How can any man be weak who dares to be at 
all ? Even the tenderest plants force their way 
up through the hardest earth, and the crev- 
ices of rocks ; but a man no material power can 
resist. What a wedge, what a beetle, what a 
catapult, is an earnest man ! What can resist 
him? 

It is a momentous fact that a man may be 
good, or he may be bad ; his life may be true, or 
it may be false ; it may be either a shame or a 
glory to him. The good man builds himself up ; 
the bad man destroys himself. 

But whatever we do we must do confidently 
(if we are timid, let us, then, act timidly), not 
expecting more light, but having light enough. 
If we confidently expect more, then let us wait 
for it. But what is this which we have ? Have 
we not already waited? Is this the beginning 
of time? Is there a man who does not see 
clearly beyond, though only a hair's breadth 
beyond where he at any time stands ? 

If one hesitates in his path, let him not pro- 
ceed. Let him respect his doubts, for doubts, 



r.30.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 201 

too, may have some divinity in them. That we 
have but little faith is not sad, but that we have 
but little faithfulness. By faithfulness faith is 
earned. When, in the progress of a life, a man 
swerves, though only by an angle infinitely small, 
from his proper and allotted path (and this is 
never done quite unconsciously even at first ; in 
fact, that was his broad and scarlet sin, ah, he 
knew of it more than he can tell), then the drama 
of his life turns to tragedy, and makes haste to 
its fifth act. When once we thus fall behind 
ourselves, there is no accounting for the obsta- 
cles which rise up in our path, and no one is so 
wise as to advise, and no one so powerful as to 
aid us while we abide on that ground. Such 
are cursed with duties, and the neglect of their 
duties. For such the decalogue was made, and 
other far more voluminous and terrible codes. 

These departures, who have not made them? 
for they are as faint as the parallax of a fixed 
star, and at the commencement we say they are 
nothing, that is, they originate in a kind of 
sleep and forgetfulness of the soul when it is 
naugjit. A man cannot be too circumspect in 
order to keep in the straight road, and be sure 
that he sees all that he may at any time see, that 
so he may distinguish his true path. 

You ask if there is no doctrine of sorrow in 
my philosophy. Of acute sorrow I suppose that 



202 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

I know comparatively little. My saddest and 
most genuine sorrows are apt to be but tran- 
sient regrets. The place of sorrow is supplied, 
perchance, by a certain hard and proportionably 
barren indifference. I am of kin to the sod, and 
partake largely of its dull patience, in winter 
expecting the sun of spring. In my cheapest 
moments I am apt to think that it is not my 
business to be " seeking the spirit," but as much 
its business to be seeking me. I know very well 
what Goethe meant when he said that he never 
had a chagrin but he made a poem out of it. I 
have altogether too much patience of this kind. 
I am too easily contented with a slight and 
almost animal happiness. My happiness is a 
good deal like that of the woodchucks. 

Methinks I am never quite committed, never 
wholly the creature of my moods, being always 
to some extent their critic. My only integral 
experience is in my vision. . I see, perchance, 
with more integrity than I feel. 

But I need not tell you what manner of man 
I am, my virtues or my vices. You can guess 
if it is worth the while ; and I do not discrimi- 
nate them well. 

I do not write this time at my hut in the 
woods. I am at present living with Mrs. Emer- 
son, whose house is an old home of mine, for 
company during Mr. Emerson's absence. 



ar.30.] THOREAU >S PENETRATION. 203 

You will perceive that I am as often talking 
to myself, perhaps, as speaking to you. 

Here is a confession of faith, and a bit of self- 
portraiture worth having ; for there is little ex- 
cept faithful statement of the fact. Its sentences 
are based on the questions and experiences of 
his correspondent ; yet they diverge into that 
atmosphere of humor and hyperbole so native to 
Thoreau ; in whom was the oddest mixture of 
the serious and the comic, the literal and the 
romantic. He addressed himself also, so far as 
his unbending personality would allow, to the 
mood or the need of his correspondent ; and he 
had great skill in fathoming character and de- 
scribing in a few touches the persons he encoun- 
tered ; as may be seen in his letters to Emerson, 
especially, who also had, and in still greater 
measure, this " fatal gift of penetration," as he 
once termed it. This will be seen in the contrast 
of Thoreau's correspondence with Mr. Blake, 
and that he was holding at the same time with 
Horace Greeley, persons radically unlike. 

In August, 1846, Thoreau sent to Greeley 
his essay on Carlyle, asking him to find a place 
for it in some magazine. Greeley sent it to 
R. W. Griswold, then editing " Graham's Maga- 
/inr " in Philadelphia, who accepted it and 
promised to pay for it, but did not publish it 



204 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

till March and April, 1847 ; even then the 
promised payment was not forthcoming. On 
the 31st of March, 1848, a year and a half 
after it had been put in Griswold's posses- 
sion, Thoreau wrote again to Greeley, saying 
that no money had come to hand. At once, 
and at the very time when Mr. Blake was open- 
ing his spiritual state to Thoreau (April 3, 
1848), the busy editor of the " Tribune " re- 
plied : " It saddens and surprises me to know 
that your article was not paid for by Graham ; 
and, since my honor is involved, I will see that 
you are paid, and that at no distant day." Ac- 
cordingly, on May 17th, he adds : " To-day I have 
been able to lay my hand on the money due 
you. I made out a regular bill for the contri- 
bution, drew a draft on G. R. Graham for the 
amount, gave it to his brother in New York 
for collection, and received the money. I have 
made Graham pay you seventy-five dollars, but 
I only send you fifty dollars," having deducted 
twenty-five dollars for the advance of that sum 
he had made a month before to Thoreau for his 
" Ktaadn and the Maine Woods," which finally 
came out in " Sartain's Union Magazine " of 
Philadelphia, late in 1848. To this letter and 
remittance of fifty dollars Thoreau replied, May 
19, 1848, substantially thus : 



Jtr.30.] TO HORACE GREELEY. 205 

TO HORACE GREELEY (AT NEW YORK). 

CONCORD, May 19, 1848. 

MY FRIEND GREELEY, I have to-day re- 
ceived from you fifty dollars. It is five years 
that I have been maintaining myself entirely by 
manual labor, not getting a cent from any 
other quarter or employment. Now this toil has 
occupied so few days, perhaps a single month, 
spring and fall each, that I must have had 
more leisure than any of my brethren for study 
and literature. I have done rude work of all 
kinds. From July, 1845, to September, 1847, 
I lived by myself in the forest, in a fairly good 
cabin, plastered and warmly covered, which I 
built myself. There I earned all I needed and 
kept to my own affairs. During that time my 
weekly outlay was but seven-and-twenty cents ; 
and I had an abundance of all sorts. Unless 
the human race perspire more than I do, there 
is no occasion to live by the sweat of their 
brow. If men cannot get on without money 
(the smallest amount will suffice), the truest 
method of earning it is by working as a laborer 
at one dollar per day. You are least dependent 
so ; I speak as an expert, having used several 
kinds of labor. 

Why should the scholar make a constant com- 
plaint that his fate is specially hard ? We are 



206 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1848, 

too often told of "the pursuit of knowledge 
under difficulties," how poets depend on pa- 
trons and starve in garrets, or at last go mad 
and die. Let us hear the other side of the 
story. Why should not the scholar, if he is 
really wiser than the multitude, do coarse work 
now and then ? Why not let his greater wis- 
dom enable him to do without things ? If you 
say the wise man is unlucky, how could you dis- 
tinguish him from the foolishly unfortunate ? 

My friend, how can I thank you for your 
kindness ? Perhaps there is a better way, I 
will convince you that it is felt and appreciated. 
Here have I been sitting idle, as it were, while 
you have been busy in my cause, and have done 
so much for me. I wish you had had a better 
subject ; but good deeds are no less good because 
their object is unworthy. 

Yours was the best way to collect money, 
but I should never have thought of it ; I might 
have waylaid the debtor perchance. Even a 
business man might not have thought of it, 
and I cannot be called that, as business is under- 
stood usually, not being familiar with the rou- 
tine. But your way has this to commend it also, 
if you make the draft, you decide how much 
to draw. You drew just the sum suitable. 

The Ktaadn paper can be put in the guise 
of letters, if it runs best so; dating each part 



T. 31.] TO HORACE GREELEY. 207 

on the day it describes. Twenty-five dollars 
more for it will satisfy me ; I expected no more, 
and do not hold you to pay that, for you 
asked for something else, and there was delay 
in sending. So, if you use it, send me twenty- 
five dollars now or after you sell it, as is most 
convenient ; but take out the expenses that I 
see you must have had. In such cases carriers 
generally get the most ; but you, as carrier here, 
get no money, but risk losing some, besides 
much of your time ; while I go away, as I must, 
giving you unprofitable thanks. Yet trust me, 
my pleasure in your letter is not wholly a selfish 
one. May my good genius still watch over me 
and my added wealth ! 

P. S. My book grows in bulk as I work on 
it ; but soon I shall get leisure for those shorter 
articles you want, then look out. 

The " book," of course, was the " Week," then 
about to go through the press ; the shorter 
articles were some that Greeley suggested for 
the Philadelphia magazines. Nothing came of 
this, but the correspondence was kept up until 
1854, and led to the partial publication of 
" Cape Cod," and " The Yankee in Canada," in 
the newly-launched " Putnam's Magazine," of 
which G. W. Curtis was editor. But he dif- 
fered with Thoreau on a matter of style or 



208 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1849, 

opinion (the articles appearing as anonymous, 
or editorial), and the author withdrew his MS. 
The letters of Greeley in this entertaining series 
are all preserved ; but Greeley seems to have 
given Thoreau's away for autographs ; and the 
only one accessible as yet is that just para- 
phrased. 

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT MILTON). 

CONCORD, August 10, 1849. 

MR. BLAKE, I write now chiefly to say, be- 
fore it is too late, that I shall be glad to see you 
in Concord, and will give you a chamber, etc., 
in my father's house, and as much of my poor 
company as you can bear. 

I am in too great haste this time to speak to 
your, or out of my, condition. I might say, 
you might say, comparatively speaking, be 
not anxious to avoid poverty. In this way the 
wealth of the universe may be securely invested. 
What a pity if we do not live this short time 
according to the laws of the long time, the 
eternal laws ! Let us see that we stand erect 
here, and do not lie along by our whole length 
in the dirt. Let our meanness be our footstool, 
not our cushion. In the midst of this labyrinth 
let us live a thread of life. We must act with 
so rapid and resistless a purpose in one direc- 
tion, that our vices will necessarily trail behind. 



*r.32.J TO HARRISON BLAKE. 209 

The nucleus of a comet is almost a star. Was 
there ever a genuine dilemma? The laws of 
earth are for the feet, or inferior man ; the laws 
of heaven are for the head, or superior man ; 
the latter are the former sublimed and ex- 
panded, even as radii from the earth's centre 
go on diverging into space. Happy the man 
who observes the heavenly and the terrestrial 
law in just proportion ; whose every faculty, 
from the soles of his feet to the crown of his 
head, obeys the law of its level ; who neither 
stoops nor goes on tiptoe, but lives a balanced 
life, acceptable to nature and to God. 

These things I say ; other things I do. 

I am sorry to hear that you did not receive 
my book earlier. I addressed it and left it in 
Munroe's shop to be sent to you immediately, 
on the twenty-sixth of May, before a copy had 
been sold. 

Will you remember me to Mr. Brown, when 
you see him next : he is well remembered by 

HENRY THOBEAU. 

I still owe you a worthy answer. 

TO HARKI8ON BLAKE. 

CONCORD, November 20, 1849. 

MR. BLAKE, I have not forgotten that I 
am your debtor. When I read over your let- 



210 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1849, 

ters, as I have just done, I feel that I am un- 
worthy to have received or to answer them, 
though they are addressed, as I would have 
them, to the ideal of me. It behoves me, if I 
would reply, to speak out of the rarest part of 
myself. 

At present I am subsisting on certain wild 
flavors which nature wafts to me, which unac- 
countably sustain me, and make my apparently 
poor life rich. Within a year my walks have 
extended themselves, and almost every after- 
noon (I read, or write, or make pencils in the 
forenoon, and by the last means get a living for 
my body) I visit some new hill, or pond, or 
wood, many miles distant. I am astonished at 
the wonderful retirement through which I move, 
rarely meeting a man in these excursions, never 
seeing one similarly engaged, unless it be my 
companion, when I have one. I cannot help 
feeling that of all the human inhabitants of na- 
ture hereabouts, only we two have leisure to 
admire and enjoy our inheritance. 

" Free in this world as the birds in the air, 
disengaged from every kind of chains, those 
who have practiced the yoga gather in Brahma 
the certain fruit of their works." 

Depend upon it, that, rude and careless as I 
am, I would fain practice the yoga faithfully. 

"The yogi, absorbed in contemplation, con- 



r.32.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 211 

tributes in his degree to creation : he breathes a 
divine perfume, he hears wonderful things. Di- 
vine forms traverse him without tearing him, and, 
united to the nature which is proper to him, he 
goes, he acts as animating original matter." 

To some extent, and at rare intervals, even I 
am a yogi. 

I know little about the affairs of Turkey, but 
I am sure that I know something about bar- 
berries and chestnuts, of which I have collected 
a store this fall. When I go to see my neigh- 
bor, he will formally communicate to me the 
latest news from Turkey, which he read in 
yesterday's mail, " Now Turkey by this time 
looks determined, and Lord Palinerston " 
Why, I would rather talk of the bran, which, 
unfortunately, was sifted out of my bread this 
morning, and thrown away. It is a fact which 
nearer to me. The newspaper gossip with 
which our hosts abuse our ears is as far from 
a true hospitality as the viands which they set 
before us. We did not need them to feed our 
bodies, and the news can be bought for a penny. 
We want the inevitable news, be it sad or cheer- 
ing, wherefore and by what means they are ex- 
tant this new day. If they are well, let them 
whistle and dance ; if they are dyspeptic, it is 
their duty to complain, that so they may in any 
case be entertaining. If words were invented 



212 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1849, 

to conceal thought, I think that newspapers are 
a great improvement on a bad invention. Do 
not suffer your life to be taken by newspapers. 

I thank you for your hearty appreciation of 
my book. I am glad to have had such a long 
talk with you, and that you had patience to lis- 
ten to me to the end. I think that I had the 
advantage of you, for I chose my own mood, 
and in one sense your mood too, that is, a 
quiet and attentive reading mood. Such ad- 
vantage has the writer over the talker. I am 
sorry that you did not come to Concord in your 
vacation. Is it not time for another vacation ? 
I am here yet, and Concord is here. 

You will have found out by this time who it 
is that writes this, and will be glad to have you 
write to him, without his subscribing himself 
HENRY D. THOREAU. 

P. S. It is so long since I have seen you, 
that, as you will perceive, I have to speak, as it 
were, in vacuo, as if I were sounding hollowly 
for an echo, and it did not make much odds 
what kind of a sound I made. But the gods do 
not hear any rude or discordant sound, as we 
learn from the echo ; and I know that the na- 
ture toward which I launch these sounds is so 
rich that it will modulate anew and wonderfully 
improve my rudest strain. 



r.32.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 213 

TO HARBISON BLAKE (AT MILTON). 

CONCORD, April 3, 1850. 

MR. BLAKE, I thank you for your letter, 
and I will endeavor to record some of the 
thoughts which it suggests, whether pertinent 
or not. You speak of poverty and dependence. 
Who are poor and dependent ? Who are rich 
and independent? When was it that men 
agreed to respect the appearance and not the 
reality ? Why should the appearance appear ? 
Are we well acquainted, then, with the reality? 
There is none who does not lie hourly in the 
respect he pays to false appearance. How sweet 
it would be to treat men and things, for an hour, 
for just what they are! We wonder that the 
sinner does not confess his sin. When we are 
weary with travel, we lay down our load and 
rest by the wayside. So, when we are weary 
with the burden of life, why do we not lay down 
this load of falsehoods which we have volun- 
teered to sustain, and be refreshed as never 
mortal was ? Let the beautiful laws prevail. 
Let us not weary ourselves by resisting them. 
When we would rest our bodies we cease to 
support them ; we recline on the lap of earth. 
So, when we would rest our spirits, we must 
recline on the Great Spirit. Let things alone ; 
let them weigh what they will ; let them soar or 



214 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. [1850, 

fall. To succeed in letting only one thing alone 
in a winter morning, if it be only one poor 
frozen-thawed apple that hangs on a tree, what 
a glorious achievement ! Methinks it lightens 
through the dusky universe. What an infinite 
wealth we have discovered ! God reigns, i. e., 
when we take a liberal view, when a liberal 
view is presented us. 

Let God alone if need be. Methinks, if I 
loved him more, I should keep him, I should 
keep myself rather, at a more respectful dis- 
tance. It is not when I am going to meet him, 
but when I am just turning away and leaving 
him alone, that I discover that God is. I say, 
God. I am not sure that that is the name. 
You will know whom I mean. 

If for a moment we make way with our petty 
selves, wish no ill to anything, apprehend no ill, 
cease to be but as the crystal which reflects 
a ray, what shall we not reflect ! What a 
universe will appear crystallized and radiant 
around us ! 

I should say, let the Muse lead the Muse, 
let the understanding lead the understanding, 
though in any case it is the farthest forward 
which leads them both. If the Muse accompany, 
she is no muse, but an amusement. The Muse 
should lead like a star which is very far off; 
but that does not imply that we are to follow 



T.32.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 215 

foolislily, falling into sloughs and over preci- 
pices, for it is not foolishness, but understand- 
ing, which is to follow, which the Muse is ap-

W ill you live ? or will you be embalmed ? 
Will you live, though it be astride of a sun- 
beam ; or will you repose safely in the cata- 
combs for a thousand years? In the former 
case, the worst accident that can happen is that 
you may break your neck. Will you break 
your heart, your soul, to save your neck ? Necks 
and pipe-stems are fated to be broken. Men 
make a great ado about the folly of demand- 
ing too much of life (or of eternity ?), and of 
endeavoring to live according to that demand. 
It is much ado about nothing. No harm ever 
came from that quarter. I am not afraid that 
I shall exaggerate the value and significance of 
life, but that I shall not be up to the occasion 
which it is. I shall be sorry to remember that 
I was there, but noticed nothing remarkable, 
not so much as a prince in disguise ; lived in 
the golden age a hired man ; visited Olym- 
pus even, but fell asleep after dinner, and did 
not hoar the conversation of the gods. I lived 
in Jndsea eighteen hundred years ago, but I 
never knew that there was such a one as Christ 
among my contemporaries ! If there is any- 
thing more glorious than a congress of men

I could have the benefit of your criticism; it 
would be a rare help to me. Will you not

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT MILTON). 

CONCORD, May 28, 1850. 

MR. BLAKE, "I never found any content- 
ment in the life which the newspapers record," 
anything of more value than the cent which 
they cost. Contentment in being covered with 
dust an inch deep ! We who walk the streets, 
and hold time together, are but the refuse of 
ourselves, and that life is for the shells of us, 
of our body and our mind, for our scurf, 
a thoroughly scurvy life. It is coffee made of 
coffee-grounds the twentieth time, which was 
only coffee the first time, while the living 
water leaps and sparkles by our doors. I know 
some who, in their charity, give their coffee- 
grounds to the poor ! We, demanding news, 
and putting up with such news ! Is it a new 



r.32.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 217 

convenience, or a new accident, or, rather, a new 
perception of the truth that we want ! 

You say that "the serene hours in which 
friendship, books, nature, thought, seem alone 
primary considerations, visit you but faintly." 
Is not the attitude of expectation somewhat 
divine ? a sort of home - made divineness ? 
Does it not compel a kind of sphere-music to 
attend on it? And do not its satisfactions 
merge at length, by insensible degrees, in the 
enjoyment of the thing expected ? 

What if I should forget to write about my 
not writing ? It is not worth the while to make 
that a theme. It is as if I had written every 
day. It is as if I had never written before. I 
wonder that you think so much about it, for not 
writing is the most like writing, in my case, of 
anything I know. 

Why will you not relate to me your dream? 
That would be to realize it somewhat. You tell 
me that you dream, but not what you dream. I 
can guess what comes to pass. So do the frogs 
dream. Would that I knew what. I have 
never found out whether they are awake or 
asleep, whether it is day or night with them. 

I am preaching, mind you, to bare walls, that 
is, to myself ; and if you have chanced to come 
in and occupy a pew, do not think that my re- 
marks are directed at you particularly, and so 



218 GOLDEN AGE OF ACHIEVEMENT. I is., 

slam the seat in disgust. This discourse was 
written long before these exciting times. 

Some absorbing employment on your higher 
ground, your upland farm, whither no cart- 
path leads, but where you mount alone with 
your hoe, where the life everlasting grows ; 
there you raise a crop which needs not to be 
brought down into the valley to a market ; 
which you barter for heavenly products. 

Do you separate distinctly enough the support 
of your body, from that of your essence ? . By 
how distinct a course commonly are these two 
ends attained! Not that they should not be 
attained by one and the same means, that, in- 
deed, is the rarest success, but there is no 
half and half about it. 

I shall be glad to read my lecture to a small 
audience in Worcester such as you describe, and 
will only require that my expenses be paid. If 
only the parlor be large enough for an echo, and 
the audience will embarrass themselves with 
hearing as much as the lecturer would otherwise 
embarrass himself with reading. But I warn 
you that this is no better calculated for a pro- 
miscuous audience than the last two which I read 
to you. It requires, in every sense, a concor- 
dant audience. 

I will come on next Saturday and spend Sun- 
day with you if you wish it. Say so if you do.

NOTE. The "companion" of his walks, mentioned by 
Thoreau in November, 1849, was Ellery Charming; the neigh- 
bor who insisted on talking of Turkey was perhaps Emerson, 
who, after his visit to Europe in 1848, was more interested in 
its politics than before. Pencil-making was Thorean's manual 
work for many years ; and it must have been about this time 
(1849-50) that he " had occasion to go to New York to peddle 
some pencils," as he says in his journal for November 20, 1853. 
He adds, " I was obliged to manufacture one thousand dollars' 
worth of pencils, and slowly dispose of, and finally sacrifice 
them, in order to pay an assumed debt of one hundred dol- 
lars." This debt was perhaps for the printing of the Week, 
published in 1-1'.'. and paid for in 1853. Thorean's pencils 
have sold (in 1893) for 25 cents each. For other facts concern- 
ing his debt to James Munroe, see Sanborn's Thoreau, pp. 230,

TO B. W. EMERSON 1 (AT CONCORD). 

FIRE ISLAND BEACH, 
Thursday morning, July 25, 1850. 

DEAR FRIEND, I am writing this at the 
house of Smith Oakes, within one mile of the 
wreck. He is the one who rendered most assist- 
ance. William H. Channing came down with 
me, but I have not seen Arthur Fuller, nor Gree- 
ley, nor Marcus Spring. Spring and Charles 
Sumner were here yesterday, but left soon. Mr. 
Oakes and wife tell me (all the survivors came, 
or were brought, directly to their house) that 
the ship struck at ten minutes after four A. M., 
and all hands, being mostly in their nightclothes, 
made haste to the forecastle, the water coming 
in at once. There they remained ; the passengers 
in the forecastle, the crew above it, doing what 

1 It will readily be seen that this letter relates to the ship- 
wreck on Fire Island, near New York, in which Margaret Ful- 
ler, Countess Ossoli, with her husband and child, was lost. A 
letter with no date of the year, but probably written February 
15, 1840, from Emerson to Thoreau, represents them both as 
taking much trouble about a house in Concord for Mrs. Fuller, 
the mother of Margaret, who had just sold her Groton house, 
and wished to live with her daughter near Emerson. 



*T.33.] TO R. W. EMERSON. 221 

they could. Every wave lifted the forecastle 
roof and washed over those within. The first 
man got ashore at nine ; many from nine to 
noon. At flood tide, about half past three 
o'clock, when the ship broke up entirely, they 
came out of the forecastle, and Margaret sat 
with her back to the foremast, with her hands 
on her knees, her husband and child already 
drowned. A great wave came and washed her 
aft. The steward (?) had just before taken her 
child and started for shore. Both were drowned. 

The broken desk, in a bag, containing no very 
valuable papers; a large black leather trunk, 
with an upper and under compartment, the 
upper holding books and papers ; a carpet-bag, 
probably Ossoli's, and one of his shoes (?) are 
all the Ossoli effects known to have been found. 
Four bodies remain to be found : the two Ossolis, 
Horace Sumner, and a sailor. I have visited 
the child's grave. Its body will probably be 
taken away to-day. The wreck is to be sold at 
auction, excepting the hull, to-day. 

The mortar would not go off. Mrs. Hasty, 
the captain's wife, told Mrs. Oakes that she and 
Margaret divided their money, and tied up the 
halves in handkerchiefs around their persons; 
that Margaret took sixty or seventy dollars. 
Mrs. HaMv. who can trll all almut Mar^atvt u]> 
to eleven o'clock on Friday, is said to be going 



222 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1850, 

to Portland, New England, to-day. She and 
Mrs. Fuller must, and probably will, come to- 
gether. The cook, the last to leave, and the 
steward (?) will know the rest. I shall try to 
see them. In the mean while I shall do what I 
can to recover property and obtain particulars 
hereabouts. William H. Channing did I 
write it ? has come with me. Arthur Fuller l 
has this moment reached the house. He reached 
the beach last night. We got here yesterday 
noon. A good part of the wreck still holds to- 
gether where she struck, and something may 
come ashore with her fragments. The last body 
was found on Tuesday, three miles west. Mrs. 
Oakes dried the papers which were in the trunk, 
and she says they appeared to be of various 
kinds. " Would they cover that table ? " (a 
small round one). " They would if spread out. 
Some were tied up. There were twenty or thirty 
books " in the same half of the trunk. Another 
smaller trunk, empty, came ashore, but there was 
no mark on it." She speaks of Paulina as if she 
might have been a sort of nurse to the child. 
I expect to go to Patchogue, whence the pilferers 
must have chiefly come, and advertise, etc.

Civil War. 



*r.33.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 223 

TO HARRISON' BLAKE (iX MILTON). 

CONCORD, August 9, 1850. 

MR. BLAKE, I received your letter just as 
I was rushing to Fire Island beach to recover 
what remained of Margaret Fuller, and read it 
on the way. That event and its train, as much 
as anything, have prevented my answering it be- 
fore. It is wisest to speak when you are spoken 
to. I will now endeavor to reply, at the risk of 
having nothing to say. 

I find that actual events, notwithstanding the 
singular prominence which we all allow them, are 
fur less real than the creations of my imagina- 
tion. They are truly visionary and insignificant, 

all that we commonly call life and death, 
and affect me less than my dreams. This petty 
stream which from time to time swells and car- 
ries away the mills and bridges of our habitual 
life, and that mightier stream or ocean on which 
we securely float, what makes the difference 
between them ? I have in my pocket a button 
which I ri | >| ><! off the coat of the Marquis of 
Ossoli, on the seashore, the other day. Held 
up, it intercepts the light, an actual button, 

and yet all the life it is connected with is less 
substantial to me, and interests me less, than my 
faintest dream. Our thoughts are the ejxx-lH in 
our lives : all else is but as a journal of the winds 
that blow while we wore hen'. 



224 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1850, 

I say to myself, Do a little more of that work 
which you have confessed to be good. You are 
neither satisfied nor dissatisfied with yourself, 
without reason. Have you not a thinking fac- 
ulty of inestimable value ? If there is an ex- 
periment which you would like to try, try it. Do 
not entertain doubts if they are not agreeable to 
you. Remember that you need not eat unless 
you are hungry. Do not read the newspapers. 
Improve every opportunity to be melancholy. As 
for health, consider yourself well. Do not en- 
gage to find things as you think they are. Do 
what nobody else can do for you. Omit to do 
anything else. It is not easy to make our lives 
respectable by any course of activity. We must 
repeatedly withdraw into our shells of thought, 
like the tortoise, somewhat helplessly ; yet there 
is more than philosophy in that. 

Do not waste any reverence on my attitude. 
I merely manage to sit up where I have dropped. 
I am sure that 'my acquaintances mistake me. 
They ask my advice on high matters, but they 
do not know even how poorly on 't I am for hats 
and shoes. I have hardly a shift. Just as 
shabby as I am in my outward apparel, ay, and 
more lamentably shabby, am I in my inward 
substance. If I should turn myself inside out, 
my rags and meanness would indeed appear. I 
am something to him that made me, undoubt- 



MT.S&] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 225 

edly, but not much to any other that he has 
made. 

Would it not be worth while to discover na- 
ture in Milton ? be native to the universe ? I, 
too, love Concord best, but I am glad when I 
discover, in oceans and wildernesses far away, 
the material o a million Concords : indeed, I am 
lost, unless I discover them. I see less differ- 
ence between a city and a swamp than formerly. 
It is a swamp, however, too dismal and dreary 
even for me, and I should be glad if there were 
fewer owls, and frogs, and mosquitoes in it. I 
prefer ever a more cultivated place, free from 
miasma and crocodiles. I am so sophisticated, 
and I will take my choice. 

As for missing friends, what if we do miss 
one another? have we not agreed on a rendez- 
vous ? While each wanders his own way through 
the wood, without anxiety, ay, with serene joy, 
though it be on his hands and knees, over rocks 
and fallen trees, he cannot but be in the right 
way. There is no wrong way to him. How 
can he be said to miss his friend, whom the 
fruits still nourish and the elements sustain ? A 
man who missed his friend at a turn, went on 
buoyantly, dividing the friendly air, and hum- 
ming a tune to himself, ever and anon kneeling 
with delight to study each little lichen in his 
path, and scarcely made three miles a day for 



226 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1850, 

friendship. As for conforming outwardly, and 
living your own life inwardly, I do not think 
much of that. Let not your right hand know 
what your left hand does in that line of busi- 
ness. It will prove a failure. Just as success- 
fully can you walk against a sharp steel edge 
which divides you cleanly right and left. Do 
you wish to try your ability to resist disten- 
sion ? It is a greater strain than any soul can 
long endure. When you get God to pulling one 
way, and the devil the other, each having his 
feet well braced, to say nothing of the con- 
science sawing transversely, almost any tim- 
ber will give way. 

I do not dare invite you earnestly to come to 
Concord, because I know too well that the ber- 
ries are not thick in my fields, and we should 
have ' to take it out in viewing the landscape. 
But come, on every account, and we will see 
one another. 

No letters of the year 1851 have been found 
by me. On the 27th of December, 1850, Mr. 
Cabot wrote to say that the Boston Society of 
Natural History, of which he was secretary, had 
elected Thoreau a corresponding member, " with 
all the honores, privilegia, etc., ad gradum tuum 
pertinentia, without the formality of paying any 
entrance fee, or annual subscription. Your du- 



*r.34.J TO T. W. HIGGINSON. 227 

ties in return are to advance the interests of the 
Society by communications or otherwise, as shall 
seem good." This is believed to be the only 
learned body which honored itself by electing 
Thoreau. The immediate occasion of this elec- 
tion was the present, by Thoreau, to the Society, 
of a fine specimen of the American goshawk, 
caught or shot by Jacob Farmer, which Mr. 
Cabot acknowledged, December 18, 1849, say- 
ing : " It was first described by Wilson ; lately 
Audubon has identified it with the European 
goshawk, thereby committing a very flagrant 
blunder. It is usually a very rare species with 
us. The European bird is used in hawking; 
and doubtless ours would be equally game. If 
Mr. Farmer skins him now, he will have to take 
second cut ; for his skin is already off and stuffed, 
his remains dissected, measured, and deposited 
in alcohol." 

TO T. W. HIGGIXSON (AT BOSTON). 

CONCORD, April 2-3, 1852. 

DEAR SIR, I do not see that I can refuse 
to read another lecture, but what makes me hesi- 
tate is the fear that I have not another available 
which will entertain a large audience, though 
I have thoughts to offer which I think will be 
quite as worthy of their attention. However, I 
will try; for the pn^p. -t of earning a few dol- 



228 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1862, 

lars is alluring. As far as I can foresee, my 
subject would be "Reality" rather transcenden- 
tally treated. It lies still in " Walden, or Life 
in the Woods." Since you are kind enough to 
undertake the arrangements, I will leave it to 
you to name an evening of next week, decide 
on the most suitable room, and advertise, if 
this is not taking you too literally at your word. 
If you still think it worth the while to attend 
to this, will you let me know as soon as may be 
what evening will be most convenient ? I cer- 
tainly do not feel prepared to offer myself as a 
lecturer to the Boston public, and hardly know 
whether more to dread a small audience or 
a large one. Nevertheless, I will repress this 
squeamishness, and propose no alteration in your 
arrangements. I shall be glad to accept your 
invitation to tea. 

This lecture was given, says Colonel Higgin- 
son, " at the Mechanics' Apprentices Library in 
Boston, with the snow outside, and the young 
boys rustling their newspapers among the Al- 
cotts and Blakes." Or, possibly, this remark 
may apply to a former lecture in the same year, 
which was that in which Thoreau first lectured 
habitually away from Concord. He commenced 
by accepting an invitation to speak at Leyden 
Hall, in Plymouth, where his friends the Wat- 



*r.34.] TO MARSTON WATSON. 229 

sons had organized Sunday services, that the 
Transcendentalists and Abolitionists might have 
a chance to be heard at a time when they were 
generally excluded from the popular " Lyceum 
courses " throughout New England. Mr. B. M. 
Watson says: 

"I have found two letters from Thoreau in 
answer to my invitation in 1852 to address our 
congregation at Leyden Hall on Sunday morn- 
ings, an enterprise I undertook about that 
time. I find among the distinguished men who 
addressed us the names of Thoreau, Emerson, 
Ellery Channing, Alcott, Higginson, Remond, 
S. Johnson, F. J. Appleton, Edmund Quincy, 
Garrison, Phillips, J. P. Lesley, Shackford, W. 
F. Channing, N. II. Whiting, Adin Bullou, Abby 
K. Foster and her husband, J. T. Sargent, T. 
T. Stone, Jones Very, Wasson, Hurlbut, F. W. 
Holland, and Scherb ; so you may depend we 
had some fun." 

These letters were mere notes. The first, 
dated February 17, 1852, says : " I have not yet 
seen Mr. Channiug, though I believe he is in 
town, having decided to come to Plymouth 
myself, but I will let him know that he is 
expected. Mr. Daniel Foster wishes me to say 
that he accepts your invitation, and that he would 
like to come Sunday after next. I will take t lie 
Saturday afternoon train. I shall be glad to 



230 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

get a winter view of Plymouth Harbor, and see 
where your garden lies under the snow." 
The second letter follows : 

TO MAKSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, December 31, 1852. 

MR. WATSON, I would be glad to visit Plym- 
outh again, but at present I have nothing to 
read which is not severely heathenish, or at least 
secular, which the dictionary defines as " re- 
lating to affairs of the present world, not holy," 
though not necessarily unholy ; nor have I 
any leisure to prepare it. My writing at present 
is profane, yet in a good sense, and, as it were, 
sacredly, I may say ; for, finding the air of the 
temple too close, I sat outside. Don't think I 
say this to get off ; no, no ! It will not do to 
read such things to hungry ears. " If they ask 
for bread, will you give them a stone ? " When 
I have something of the right kind, depend upon 
it I will let you know. 

Up to 1848, when he was invited to lecture 
before the Salem Lyceum by Nathaniel Haw- 
thorne, then its secretary, Thoreau seems to have 
spoken publicly very little except in Concord ; 
nor did he extend the circuit of his lectures much 
until his two books had made him known as a 
thinker. There was little to attract a popular 



JET. 35.] LYCEUM LECTURES. 231 

audience in his manner or his matter ; but it was 
the era of lectures, and if one could once gain 
admission to the circle of " lyceuni lecturers," it 
did not so much matter what he said ; a lecture 
was a lecture, as a sermon was a sermon, good, 
bad, or indifferent. But it was common to ex- 
clude the anti-slavery speakers from the lyceums, 
even those of more eloquence than Thoreau; 
this led to invitations from the small band of 
reformers scattered about New England and 
New York, so that the most unlikely of platform 
speakers (Ellery Channing, for example) some- 
times gave lectures at Plymouth, Greenfield, 
Newburyport, or elsewhere. The present fash- 
ion of parlor lectures had not come in ; yet at 
Worcester Thoreau's friends early organized for 
him something of that kind, as his letters to Mr. 
Blake show. In default of an audience of num- 
bers, Thoreau fell into the habit of lecturing in 
his letters to this friend ; the most marked in- 
stance being the thoughtful essay on Love and 
Chastity which makes the bulk of his epistle 
dated September, 1852. Like most of his seri- 
ous writing, this was made up from his daily 
journal, and hardly comes under the head of 
" familiar letters ;" the didactic purpose is ratlin- 
too apparent. Yet it cannot !> spared from any 
collection of his epistles, none of which flowed 
more directly from the quickened moral nature 
of the man.

TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT BANGOB). 

CONCORD, July 13, 1852. 

DEAR SOPHIA, I am a miserable letter- 
writer, but perhaps if I should say this at length 
and with sufficient emphasis and regret it would 
make a letter. I am sorry that nothing tran- 
spires here of much moment ; or, I should rather 
say, that I am so slackened and rusty, like the 
telegraph wire this season, that no wind that 
blows can extract music from me. 

I am not on the trail of any elephants or mas- 
todons, but have succeeded in trapping only a 
few ridiculous mice, which cannot feed my im- 
agination. I have become sadly scientific. I 
would rather come upon the vast valley-like 
" spoor " only of some celestial beast which this 
world's woods can no longer sustain, than spring 
my net over a bushel of moles. You must do 
better in those woods where you are. You must 
have some adventures to relate and repeat for 
years to come, which will eclipse even mother's 
voyage to Goldsborough and Sissiboo. 

They say that Mr. Pierce, the presidential 
candidate, was in town last 5th of July, visiting 
Hawthorne, whose college chum he was ; and 
that Hawthorne is writing a life of him, for 
electioneering purposes. 

Concord is just as idiotic as ever in relation 



r.35.] TO SOPHIA THOREAU. 233 

to the spirits and their knockings. Most people 
here believe in a spiritual world which no respec- 
table junk bottle, which had not met with a slip, 
would condescend to contain even a portion of 
for a moment, whose atmosphere would ex- 
tinguish a candle let down into it, like a well 
that wants airing ; in spirits which the very bull- 
frogs in our meadows would blackball. Their 
evil genius is seeing how low it can degrade 
them. The hooting of owls, the croaking of 
frogs, is celestial wisdom in comparison. If I 
could be brought to believe in the things which 
they believe, I should make haste to get rid of 
my certificate of stock in this and the next 
world's enterprises, and buy a share in the first 
Immediate Annihilation Company that offered. 
I would exchange my immortality for a glass of 
small beer this hot weather. Where are the 
heathen ? Was there ever any superstition be- 
fore ? And yet I suppose there may be a vessel 
this very moment setting sail from the coast of 
North America to that of Africa with a mission- 
ary on board ! Consider the dawn and the sun- 
rise, the raintxw and the evening, the words 
of Christ and the aspiration of all the saints ! 
Hear music ! see, smell, taste, feel, hear, any- 
thing, and then hear these idiots, inspired by 
the cracking of a restless board, humbly asking,

answer by tips of the table." !!!!!!!

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, July 21, 1852. 

MR. BLAKE, I am too stupidly well these 
days to write to you. My life is almost altogether 
outward, all shell and no tender kernel ; so that 
I fear the report of it would be only a nut for 
you to crack, with no meat in it for you to eat. 
Moreover, you have not cornered me up, and I 
enjoy such large liberty in writing to you, that I 
feel as vague as the air. However, I rejoice to hear 
that you have attended so patiently to anything 
which I have said heretofore, and have detected 
any truth in it. It encourages me to say more, 
not in this letter, I fear, but in some book 
which I may write one day. I am glad to know 
that I am as much to any mortal as a persistent 
and consistent scarecrow is to a farmer, such 
a bundle of straw in a man's clothing as I am, 
with a few bits of tin to sparkle in the sun 
dangling about me, as if I were hard at work 
there in the field. However, if this kind of life 
saves any man's corn, why, he is the gainer. 
I am not afraid that you will flatter me as long 
as you know what I am, as well as what I think, 
or aim to be, and distinguish between these two, 
for then it will commonly happen that if you 
praise the last you will condemn the first.

well, a fit place to go to on a Sunday ; one of 
the true temples of the earth. A temple, you 
know, was anciently " an open place without a 
roof," whose walls served merely to shut out the 
world and direct the mind toward heaven ; but 
a modern meeting-house shuts out the heavens, 
while it crowds the world into still closer quar- 
ters. Best of all is it when, as on a mountain- 
top, you have for all walls your own elevation 
and deeps of surrounding ether. The partridge- 
berries, watered with mountain dews which are 
gathered there, are more memorable to me than 
the words which I last heard from the pulpit 
at least ; and for my part, I would rather look 
toward Km land than Jerusalem. Rutland, 
modern town, land of ruts, trivial and 
worn, not too sacred, with no holy sepul- 
chre, but profane green fields and dusty roads, 
and opportunity to live as holy a life as you 
can, where the sacredness, if there is any, is 
all in yourself and not in the place. 

I fear that your Worcester people do not often 
enough go to the hilltops, though, as I am told, 
the springs lie nearer to the surface on your 
hills than in your valleys. They have the repu- 
tation of being Free-Soilers. 1 Do they insist on 
a free atmosphere, too, that is, on freedom for

the head or brain as well as the feet ? If I were 
consciously to join any party, it would be that 
which is the most free to entertain thought. 

All the world complain nowadays of a press 
of trivial duties and engagements, which pre- 
vents their employing themselves on some higher 
ground they know of ; but, undoubtedly, if they 
were made of the right stuff to work on that 
higher ground, provided they were released from 
all those engagements, they would now at once 
fulfill the superior engagement, and neglect all 
the rest, as naturally as they breathe. They would 
never be caught saying that they had no time 
for this, when the dullest man knows that this 
is all that he has time for. No man who acts 
from a sense of duty ever puts the lesser duty 
above the greater. No man has the desire and 
the ability to work on high things, but he has 
also the ability to build himself a high staging. 

As for passing through any great and glo- 
rious experience, and rising above it, as an eagle 
might fly athwart the evening sky to rise into 
still brighter and fairer regions of the heavens, I 
cannot say that I ever sailed so creditably ; but 
my bark ever seemed thwarted by some side 
wind, and went off over the edge, and now only 
occasionally tacks back toward the centre of that 
sea again. I have outgrown nothing good, but, 
I do not fear to say, fallen behind by whole con-

tinents of virtue, which should have been passed 
as islands in my course ; but I trust what else 
can I trust? that, with a stiff wind, some Fri- 
day, when I have thrown some of my cargo 
overboard, I may make up for all that distance 
lost. 

Perchance the time will come when we shall 
not be content to go back and forth upon a raft 
to some huge Homeric or Shakespearean India- 
man that lies upon the reef, but build a bark 
out of that wreck and others that are buried in 
the sands of this desolate island, and such new 
timber as may be required, in which to sail away 
to whole new worlds of light and life, where our 
friends are. 

Write again. There is one respect in which 
you did not finish your letter : you did not write

TO HARRISON' BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

September, 1852. 

MR. BLAKE, Here come the sentences which 
I promised you. You may keep them, if you 
will regard and use them as the disconnected 
fragments of what I may find to be a completer 
essay, on looking over my journal, at last, and 
may claim again. 



238 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

I send you the thoughts on Chastity and Sen- 
suality with diffidence and shame, not knowing 
how far I speak to the condition of men gener- 
ally, or how far I betray my peculiar defects. 
Pray enlighten me on this point if you can. 

LOVE. 

What the essential difference between man 
and woman is, that they should be thus attracted 
to one another, no one has satisfactorily an- 
swered. Perhaps we must acknowledge the just- 
ness of the distinction which assigns to man the 
sphere of wisdom, and to woman that of love, 
though neither belongs exclusively to either. 
Man is continually saying to woman, Why will 
you not be more wise? Woman is continually 
saying to man, Why will you not be more lov- 
ing ? It is not in their wills to be wise or to be 
loving ; but, unless each is both wise and loving, 
there can be neither wisdom nor love. 

All transcendent goodness is one, though 
appreciated in different ways, or by different 
senses. In beauty we see it, in music we hear 
it, in fragrance we scent it, in the palatable the 
pure palate tastes it, and in rare health the 
whole body feels it. The variety is in the sur- 
face or manifestation ; but the radical identity 
we fail to express. The lover sees in the glance 
of his beloved the same beauty that in the sun- 



*r.35.] LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP. 239 

set paints the western skies. It is the same dai- 
mon, here lurking under a human eyelid, and 
there under the closing eyelids of the day. 
Here, in small compass, is the ancient and natu- 
ral beauty of evening and morning. What lov- 
ing astronomer has ever fathomed the ethereal 
depths of the eye ? 

The maiden conceals a fairer flower and 
sweeter fruit than any calyx in the field ; and, 
if she goes with averted face, confiding in her 
purity and high resolves, she will make the heav- 
ens retrospective, and all nature humbly con- 
fess its queen. 

Under the influence of this sentiment, man is 
a string of an JEolian harp, which vibrates with 
the zephyrs of the eternal morning. 

There is at first thought something trivial 
in the commonness of love. So many Indian 
youths and maidens along these banks have in 
ages past yielded to the influence of this great 
civilizer. Nevertheless, this generation is not 
disgusted nor discouraged, for love is no indi- 
vidual's experience ; and though we are imper- 
fect mediums, it does not partake of our imper- 
fWtion; though we are finite, it is infinite and 
eternal ; and the same divine influence broods 
over these banks, whatever race may inhabit 
them, and perchance still would, even if the hu- 
man race did not dwell here. 



240 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

Perhaps an instinct survives through the in- 
tensest actual love, which prevents entire aban- 
donment and devotion, and makes the most ar- 
dent lover a little reserved. It is the anticipation 
of change. For the most ardent lover is not the 
less practically wise, and seeks a love which will 
last forever. 

Considering how few poetical friendships there 
are, it is remarkable that so many are married. 
It would seem as if men yielded too easy an 
obedience to nature without consulting their ge- 
nius. One may be drunk with love without 
being any nearer to finding his mate. There is 
more of good nature than of good sense at the 
bottom of most marriages. But the good nature 
must have the counsel of the good spirit or In- 
telligence. If common sense had been consulted, 
how many marriages would never have taken 
place ; if uncommon or divine sense, how few 
marriages such as we witness would ever have 
taken place! 

Our love may be ascending or descending. 
What is its character, if it may be said of it, 

" We must respect the souls above 
But only those below we love." 

Love is a severe critic. Hate can pardon more 
than love. They who aspire to love worthily, 
subject themselves to an ordeal more rigid than 
any other. 



*r.35.] LOVE IS NOT BLIND. 241 

Is your friend such a one that an increase of 
worth on your part will rarely make her more 
your friend? Is she retained is she attracted 
by more nobleness in you, by more of that 
virtue which is peculiarly yours ; or is she indif- 
ferent and blind to that ? Is she to be flattered 
and won by your meeting her on any other than 
the ascending path? Then duty requires that 
you separate from her. 

Love must be as much a light as a flame. 

Where there is not discernment, the behavior 
even of the purest soul may in effect amount to 
coarseness. 

A man of fine perceptions is more truly femi- 
nine than a merely sentimental woman. The 
heart is blind ; but love is not blind. None of 
the gods is so discriminating. 

In love and friendship the imagination is as 
much exercised as the heart ; and if either is 
outraged the other will be estranged. It is com- 
monly the imagination which is wounded first, 
rather than the heart, it is so much the more 
sensitive. 

Comparatively, we can excuse any offense 
against the heart, but not against the imagina- 
tion. The imagination knows nothing esca])es 
its glance from out its eyry and it controls 
the breast. My heart may still yearn toward 
the valley, but my imagination will not permit 



242 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

me to jump off the precipice that debars me 
from it, for it is wounded, its wings are clipt, 
and it cannot fly, even descendingly. Our 
" blundering hearts ! " some poet says. The im- 
agination never forgets ; it is a re-member ing. It 
is not foundationless, but most reasonable, and 
it alone uses all the knowledge of the intellect. 

Love is the profoundest of secrets. Divulged, 
even to the beloved, it is no longer Love. As 
if it were merely I that loved you. When love 
ceases, then it is divulged. 

In our intercourse with one we love, we wish 
to have answered those questions at the end of 
which we do not raise our voice ; against which 
we put no interrogation-mark, answered with 
the same unfailing, universal aim toward every 
point of the compass. 

I require that thou knowest everything with- 
out being told anything. I parted from my be- 
loved because there was one thing which I had 
to tell her. She questioned me. She should 
have known all by sympathy. That I had to 
tell it her was the difference between us, the 
misunderstan ding. 

A lover never hears anything that is told, for 
that is commonly either false or stale ; but he 
hears things taking place, as the sentinels heard 
Trenck 1 mining in the ground, and thought it 
was moles. 

1 Baron Trenck, the famous prisoner. 



*r.35.] LOVE AND HATE. 243 

The relation may be profaned in many ways. 
The parties may not regard it with equal sacred- 
ness. What if the lover should learn that his 
beloved dealt in incantations and philters ! 
What if he should hear that she consulted a 
clairvoyant ! The spell would be instantly 
broken. 

If to chaffer and higgle are bad in trade, 
they are much worse in Love. It demands 
directness as of an arrow. 

There is danger that we lose sight of what 
our friend is absolutely, while considering what 
she is to us alone. 

The lover wants no partiality. He says, Be 
so kind as to be just. 

Canst i linn love with thy mind, 

And reason with thy heart ? 
Canst thou be kind, 

And from thy darling part ? 

Can'st thou range earth, sea, and air, 
And BO meet me everywhere ? 
Through all events I will pursue thee, 
Through all persons I will woo thee. 

I need thy hate as much as thy love. Thou 
wilt not repel me entirely when thou repellest 
what is evil in me. 

Indeed, indeed, I cannot tell, 
Though I ponder on it well, 
Which were earner to state, 
All my love or all my hate. 



244 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

Surely, surely, thou wilt trust me 
When I say thou doth disgust me. 
O, I hate thee with a hate 
That would fain annihilate ; 
Yet, sometimes, against my will, 
My dear Friend, I love thee still. 
It were treason to our love, 
And a sin to God above, 
One iota to abate 
Of a pure, impartial hate. 

It is not enough that we are truthful ; we 
must cherish and carry out high purposes to be 
truthful about. 

It must be rare, indeed, that we meet with 
one to whom we are prepared to be quite ideally 
related, as she to us. We should have no re- 
serve ; we should give the whole of ourselves to 
that society ; we should have no duty aside from 
that. One who could bear to be so wonderfully 
and beautifully exaggerated every day. I would 
take my friend out of her low self and set her 
higher, infinitely higher, and there know her. 
But, commonly, men are as much afraid of love 
as of hate. They have lower engagements. 
They have near ends to serve. They have not 
imagination enough to be thus employed about 
a human being, but must be coopering a barrel, 
forsooth. 

What a difference, whether, in all your walks, 
you meet only strangers, or in one house is one 
who knows you, and whom you know. To have 



r.35.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 245 

a brother or a sister ! To have a gold mine on 
your farm ! To find diamonds in the gravel 
heaps before your door ! How rare these things 
are ! To share the day with you, to people 
the earth. Whether to have a god or a goddess 
for companion in your walks, or to walk alone 
with hinds and villains and carles. Would not 
a friend enhance the beauty of the landscape as 
much as a deer or hare ? Everything would ac- 
knowledge and serve such a relation ; the corn 
in the field, and the cranberries in the meadow. 
The flowers would bloom, and the birds sing, 
with a new impulse. There would be more fair 
days in the year. 

The object of love expands and grows before 
us to eternity, until it includes all that is lovely, 
and we become all that can love. 

CHASTITY AND SENSUALITY. 

The subject of sex is a remarkable one, since, 
though its phenomena concern us so much, both 
directly and indirectly, and, sooner or later, it 
occupies the thoughts of all, yet all mankind, as 
it were, agree to be silent about it, at least the 
sexes commonly one to another. One of the 
most interesting of all human facts is veiled 
more completely than any mystery. It is treated 
with such secrecy and awe as surely do not go 
to any religion. I believe that it is unusual even 



246 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

for the most intimate friends to communicate 
the pleasures and anxieties connected with this 
fact, much as the external affair of love, its 
comings and goings, are bruited. The Shakeis 
do not exaggerate it so much by their manner 
of speaking of it, as all mankind by their man- 
ner of keeping silence about it. Not that men 
should speak on this or any subject without 
having anything worthy to say ; but it is plain 
that the education of man has hardly com- 
menced, there is so little genuine intercom- 
munication. 

In a pure society, the subject of marriage 
would not be so often avoided, from shame 
and not from reverence, winked out of sight, 
and hinted at only ; but treated naturally and 
simply, perhaps simply avoided, like the kin- 
dred mysteries. If it cannot be spoken of for 
shame, how can it be acted of ? But, doubtless, 
there is far more purity, as well as more im- 
purity, than is apparent. 

Men commonly couple with their idea of mar- 
riage a slight degree at least of sensuality ; but 
every lover, the world over, believes in its incon- 
ceivable purity. 

If it is the result of a pure love, there can be 
nothing sensual in marriage. Chastity is some- 
thing positive, not negative. It is the virtue of 
the married especially. All lusts or base pleas- 



*r.35.] THE DEEDS OF LOVE. 247 

ures must give place to loftier delights. They 
who meet as superior beings cannot perform the 
deeds of inferior ones. The deeds of love are 
less questionable than any action of an individ- 
ual can be, for, it being founded on the rarest 
mutual respect, the parties incessantly stimulate 
each other to a loftier and purer life, and the 
act in which they are associated must be pure 
and noble indeed, for innocence and purity can 
have no equal. In this relation we deal with 
one whom we respect more religiously even than 
we respect our better selves, and we shall neces- 
sarily conduct as in the presence of God. What 
presence can be more awful to the lover than the 
presence of his beloved ? 

If you seek the warmth even of affection from 
a similar motive to that from which cats and 
dogs and slothful persons hug the fire, be- 
cause your temperature is low through sloth, 
you are on the downward road, and it is but to 
plunge yet deeper into sloth. Better the cold 
affection of the sun, reflected from fields of ice 
and snow, or his warmth in some still, wintry 
dell. The warmth of celestial love does not 
relax, but nerves and braces its enjoyer. Warm 
your body by healthful exercise, not by cowering 
over a stove. Warm your spirit by performing 
independently noble deeds, not by ignobly seek- 
ing the sympathy of your fellows who are no 



248 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

better than yourself. A man's social and spirit- 
ual discipline must answer to his corporeal. He 
must lean on a friend who has a hard breast, as 
he would lie on a hard bed. He must drink cold 
water for his only beverage. So he must not 
hear sweetened and colored words, but pure and 
refreshing truths. He must daily bathe in truth 
cold as spring water, not warmed by the sympa- 
thy of friends. 

Can love be in aught allied to dissipation? 
Let us love by refusing, not accepting one an- 
other. Love and lust are far asunder. The one 
is good, the other bad. When the affectionate 
sympathize by their higher natures, there is 
love ; but there is danger that they will sympa- 
thize by their lower natures, and then there is 
lust. It is not necessary that this be deliberate, 
hardly even conscious ; but, in the close contact 
of affection, there is danger that we may stain 
and pollute one another ; for we cannot embrace 
but with an entire embrace. 

We must love our friend so much that she 
shall be associated with our purest and holiest 
thoughts alone. When there is impurity, we 
have " descended to meet," though we knew it 
not. 

The luxury of affection, there 's the danger. 
There must be some nerve and heroism in our 
love, as of a winter morning. In the religion of 



r.35.] VIRGINITY AND MARRIAGE. 249 

all nations a purity is hinted at, which, I fear, 
men never attain to. We may love and not 
elevate one another. The love that takes us as 
it finds us degrades us. What watch we must 
keep over the fairest and purest of our affec- 
tions, lest there be some taint about them ! May 
we so love as never to have occasion to repent 
of our love ! 

There is to be attributed to sensuality the 
loss to language of how many pregnant symbols 1 
Flowers, which, by their infinite hues and fra- 
grance, celebrate the marriage of the plants, are 
intended for a symbol of the open and unsus- 
pected beauty of all true marriage, when man's 
flowering season arrives. 

Virginity, too, is a budding flower, and by an 
impure marriage the virgin is deflowered. Who- 
ever loves flowers, loves virgins and chastity. 
Love and lust are as far asunder as a flower- 
garden is from a brothel. 

J. Biberg, in the " Amoenitates Botanicae," 
edited by Linnaeus, observes (I translate from 
the Latin) : " The organs of generation, which, 
in the animal kingdom, are for the most part 
concealed by nature, as if they were to be 
ashamed of, in the vegetable kingdom are ex- 
posed to the eyes of all ; and, when the nuptials 
of plants are celebrated, it is wonderful what 
delight they afford to the beholder, refreshing 



250 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1852, 

the senses with the most agreeable color and the 
sweetest odor ; and, at the same time, bees and 
other insects, not to mention the humming-bird, 
extract honey from their nectaries, and gather 
wax from their effete pollen." Linnaeus himself 
calls the calyx the thalamus, or bridal chamber ; 
and the corolla the aulaeum, or tapestry of it, 
and proceeds to explain thus every part of the 
flower. 

Who knows but evil spirits might corrupt the 
flowers themselves, rob them of their fragrance 
and their fair hues, and turn their marriage into 
a secret shame and defilement ? Already they 
are of various qualities, and there is one whose 
nuptials fill the lowlands in June with the odor 
of carrion. 

The intercourse of the sexes, I have dreamed, 
is incredibly beautiful, too fair to be remem- 
bered. I have had thoughts about it, but they 
are among the most fleeting and irrecoverable in 
my experience. It is strange that men will talk 
of miracles, revelation, inspiration, and the like, 
as things past, while love remains. 

A true marriage will differ in no wise from 
illumination. In all perception of the truth 
there is a divine ecstasy, an inexpressible delir- 
ium of joy, as when a youth embraces his be- 
trothed virgin. The ultimate delights of a true 
marriage are one with this. 



MT. 36.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 251 

No wonder that, out of such a union, not as 
end, but as accompaniment, comes the undying 
race of man. The womb is a most fertile soil. 

Some have asked if the stock of men could 
not be improved, if they could not be bred as 
cattle. Let Love be purified, and all the rest 
will follow. A pure love is thus, indeed, the 
panacea for all the ills of the world. 

The only excuse for reproduction is improve- 
ment Nature abhors repetition. Beasts merely 
propagate their kind ; but the offspring of noble 
men and women will be superior to themselves, 
as their aspirations are. By their fruits ye shall 
know them. 

TO HARBISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, February 27, 1853. 

MR. BLAKE, I have not answered your letter 
before, because I have been almost constantly in 
the fields surveying of late. It is long since I 
have spent many days so profitably in a pecuni- 
ary sense ; so unprofitably, it seems to me, in 
a more important sense. I have earned just a 
dollar a day for seventy-six days past; for, 
though I charge at a higher rate for the days 
which are seen to be spent, yet so many more 
are spent than appears. This is instead of lec- 
turing, which has not offered, to pay for that 
book which I printed. 1 I have not only cheap 
' The Week. 



252 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1853, 

hours, but cheap weeks and months; that is, 
weeks which are bought at the rate I have 
named. Not that they are quite lost to me, or 
make me very melancholy, alas ! for I too often 
take a cheap satisfaction in so spending them, 
weeks of pasturing and browsing, like beeves 
and deer, which give me animal health, it 
may be, but create a tough skin over the soul 
and intellectual part. Yet, if men should offer 
my body a maintenance for the work of my 
head alone, I feel that it would be a dangerous 
temptation. 

As to whether what you speak of as the 
" world's way " (which for the most part is my 
way), or that which is shown me, is the better, 
the former is imposture, the latter is truth. I 
have the coldest confidence in the last. There 
is only such hesitation as the appetites feel in 
following the aspirations. The clod hesitates 
because it is inert, wants animation. The one 
is the way of death, the other of life everlasting. 
My hours are not " cheap in such a way that 
I doubt whether the world's way would not 
have been better," but cheap in such a way that 
I doubt whether the world's way, which I have 
adopted for the time, could be worse. The 
whole enterprise of this nation, which is not an 
upward, but a westward one, toward Oregon, 
California, Japan, etc., is totally devoid of inter- 



.35.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 253 

est to me, whether performed on foot, or by a 
Pacific railroad. It is not illustrated by a 
thought ; it is not warmed by a sentiment ; 
there is nothing in it which one should lay 
down his life for, nor even his gloves, hardly 
which one should take up a newspaper for. It 
is perfectly heathenish, a filibustering to- 
ward heaven by the great western route. No ; 
they may go their way to their manifest destiny, 
which I trust is not mine. May my seventy- 
six dollars, whenever I get them, help to carry 
me in the other direction ! I see them on their 
winding way, but no music is wafted from their 
host, only the rattling of change in their 
pockets. I would rather be a captive knight, 
and let them all pass by, than be free only to 
go whither they are bound. What end do they 
propose to themselves beyond Japan ? What 
aims more lofty have they than the prairie 
dogs? 

As it respects these things, I have not changed 
an opinion one iota from the first. As the stars 
looked to me when I was a shepherd in Assyria, 
they look to me now, a New-Englander. The 
higher the mountain on which you stand, the 
less change in the prospect from year to year, 
from age to age. Above a certain height there is 
no change. I am a Switzer on the edge of the 
glacier, with his advantages and disadvantages, 



254 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1853, 

goitre, or what not. (You may suspect it to be 
some kind of swelling at any rate.) I have had 
but one spiritual birth (excuse the word), and 
now whether it rains or snows, whether I laugh 
or cry, fall farther below or approach nearer to 
my standard ; whether Pierce or Scott is elected, 
not a new scintillation of light flashes on me, 
but ever and anon, though with longer intervals, 
the same surprising and everlastingly new light 
dawns to me, with only such variations as in the 
coming of the natural day, with which, indeed, 
it is often coincident. 

As to how to preserve potatoes from rotting, 
your opinion may change from year to year ; 
but as to how to preserve your soul from rot- 
ting, I have nothing to learn, but something to 
practice. 

Thus I declaim against them ; but I in my 
folly am the world I condemn. 

I very rarely, indeed, if ever, " feel any itch- 
ing to be what is called useful to my fellow-men." 
Sometimes it may be when my thoughts for 
want of employment fall into a beaten path or 
humdrum I have dreamed idly of stopping a 
man's horse that was running away ; but, per- 
chance, I wished that he might run, in order 
that I might stop him ; or of putting out a 
fire ; but then, of course, it must have got well 
a-going. Now, to tell the truth, I do not dream 



XT. 35.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 255 

much of acting upon horses before they run, or 
of preventing fires which are not yet kindled. 
What a foul subject is this of doing good ! in- 
stead of minding one's life, which should be his 
business ; doing good as a dead carcass, which is 
only fit for manure, instead of as a living man, 
instead of taking care to flourish, and smell and 
taste sweet, and refresh all mankind to the extent 
of our capacity and quality. People will some- 
times try to persuade you that you have done 
something from that motive, as if you did not 
already know enough about it. If I ever did a 
man any good, in their sense, of course it was 
something exceptional and insignificant com- 
pared with the good or evil which I am con- 
stantly doing by being what I am. As if you 
were to preach to ice to shape itself into burn- 
ing-glasses, which are sometimes useful, and so 
the peculiar properties of ice be lost. Ice that 
merely performs the office of a burning-glass 
does not do its duty. 

The problem of life becomes, one cannot say 
by how many degrees, more complicated as our 
material wealth is increased, whether that 
needle they tell of was a gateway or not, since 
the problem is not merely nor mainly to get life; 
for our bodies, but by this or a similar discipline 
to get life for our souls ; by cultivating the low- 
land farm on right principles, that is, with this 



256 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS, [1853, 

view, to turn it into an upland farm. You have 
so many more talents to account for. If I accom- 
plish as much more in spiritual work as I am 
richer in worldly goods, then I am just as worthy, 
or worth just as much, as I was before, and no 
more. I see that, in my own case, money might 
be of great service to me, but probably it would 
not be ; for the difficulty now is, that I do not 
improve my opportunities, and therefore I am 
not prepared to have my opportunities increased. 
Now, I warn you, if it be as you say, you have 
got to put on the pack of an upland farmer in 
good earnest the coming spring, the lowland 
farm being cared for ; ay, you must be selecting 
your seeds forthwith, and doing what winter 
work you can ; and, while others are raising

Though we are desirous to earn our bread, we

ter, simply for paying our whole debt to God, 
which includes our debt to them, and though we 
have His receipt for it, for His paper is dis- 
honored. The cashier will tell you that He has 
no stock in his bank. 

How prompt we are to satisfy the hunger and 
thirst of our bodies ; how slow to satisfy the 
hunger and thirst of our souls I Indeed, we 
would-be-practical folks cannot use this word 
without blushing because of our infidelity, hav- 
ing starved this substance almost to a shadow. 
We feel it to be as absurd as if a man were to 
break forth into a eulogy on his dog, who has n't 
any. An ordinary man will work every day for 
a year at shoveling dirt to support his body, or 
a family of bodies ; but he is an extraordinary 
man who will work a whole day in a year for 
the support of his soul. Even the priests, the 
men of God, so called, for the most part confess 
that they work for the support of the body. 
But he alone is the truly enterprising and prac- 
tical man who succeeds in maintaining his soul 
here. Have not we our everlasting life to get? 
and is not that the only excuse at last for eat- 
ing, drinking, sleeping, or even carrying an 
umbrella when it rains ? A man might as well 
devote himself to raising pork, as to fattening 
the bodies, or temporal part merely, of the 
whole human family. If we made the true dig- 



258 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1853, 

tinction we should almost all of us be seen to be 
in the almshouse for souls. 

I am much indebted to you because you look 
so steadily at the better side, or rather the true 
centre of me (for our true centre may, and per- 
haps oftenest does, lie entirely aside from us, 
and we are in fact eccentric), and, as I have 
elsewhere said, " give me an opportunity to live." 
You speak as if the image or idea which I see 
were reflected from me to you ; and I see it again 
reflected from you to me, because we stand at 
the right angle to one another ; and so it goes 
zigzag to what successive reflecting surfaces, be- 
fore it is all dissipated or absorbed by the more 
unreflecting, or differently reflecting, who 
knows? Or, perhaps, what you see directly, 
you refer to me. What a little shelf is re- 
quired, by which we may impinge upon another, 
and build there our eyry in the clouds, and all 
the heavens we see above us we refer to the 
crags around and beneath us. Some piece of 
mica, as it were, in the face or eyes of one, as 
on the Delectable Mountains, slanted at the right 
angle, reflects the heavens to us. But, in the 
slow geological upheavals and depressions, these 
mutual angles are disturbed, these suns set, and 
new ones rise to us. That ideal which I wor- 
shiped was a greater stranger to the mica than 
to me. It was. not the hero I admired, but the 



*r.35.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 259 

reflection from his epaulet or helmet. It is 
nothing (for us) permanently inherent in an- 
other, but his attitude or relation to what we 
prize, that we admire. The meanest man may 
glitter with micacious particles to his fellow's 
eye. These are the spangles that adorn a man. 
The highest union, the only un-ion (don't 
laugh), or central oneness, is the coincidence of 
visual rays. Our club-room was an apartment 
in a constellation where our visual rays met 
(and there was no debate about the restaurant). 
The way between us is over the mount. 

Your words make me think of a man of my 
acquaintance whom I occasionally meet, whom 
you, too, appear to have met, one Myself, as he 
is called. Yet, why not call him J'bwrself? 
If you have met with him and know him, it is 
all I have done ; and surely, where there is a 
mutual acquaintance, the my and thy make a 
distinction without a difference. 

I do not wonder that you do not like my 
Canada story. It concerns me but little, and 
probably is not worth the time it took to tell it. 
Yet I had absolutely no design whatever in my 
mind, but simply to report what I saw. I have 
inserted all of myself that was implicated, or 
made the excursion. It has come to an end, at 
any rate ; they will print no more, but return 
me my MS. when it is but little more than half

done, as well as another I had sent them, be- 
cause the editor 1 requires the liberty to omit the 
heresies without consulting me, a privilege 
California is not rich enough to bid for. 

I thank you again and again for attending 
to me ; that is to say, I am glad tl^at you hear 
me and that you also are glad. Hold fast to 
your most indefinite, waking dream. The very 
green dust on the walls is an organized vege- 
table ; the atmosphere has its fauna and flora 
floating in it ; and shall we think that dreams 
are but dust and ashes, are always disintegrated 
and crumbling thoughts, and not dust - like 
thoughts trooping to their standard with music, 
systems beginning to be organized ? ' These 
expectations, these are roots, these are nuts, 
which even the poorest man has in his bin, and 
roasts or cracks them occasionally in winter 
evenings, which even the poor debtor retains 
with his bed and his pig, i. e., his idleness and 
sensuality. Men go to the opera because they 
hear there a faint expression in sound of this 
news which is never quite distinctly proclaimed. 
Suppose a man were to sell the hue, the least 
amount of coloring matter in the superficies of 
his thought, for a farm, were to exchange an 
absolute and infinite value for a relative and 
finite one, to gain the whole world and lose 
his own soul !

CONCORD, April 10, 1853. 

MR. BLAKE, Another singular kind of 
spiritual foot-ball, really nameless, handle- 
less, homeless, like myself, a mere arena for 
thoughts and feelings ; definite enough out- 
wardly, indefinite more than enough inwardly. 
But I do not know why we should be styled 
" misters " or " masters : " we come so near to 
being anything or nothing, and seeing that we 
are mastered, and not wholly sorry to be mas- 
tered, by the least phenomenon. It seems to me 
that we are the mere creatures of thought, 
one of the lowest forms of intellectual life, we 
men, as the sunfiah is of animal life. As yet 
our thoughts have acquired no definiteness nor 
solidity ; they are purely molluscous, not verte- 
brate ; and the height of our existence is to float 
upward in an ocean where the sun shines, ap-

pearing only like a vast soup or chowder to the 
eyes of the immortal navigators. It is wonder- 
ful that I can be here, and you there, and that 
we can correspond, and do many other things, 
when, in fact, there is so little of us, either or 
both, anywhere. In a few minutes, I expect, 
this slight film or dash of vapor that I am will 
be what is called asleep, resting ! forsooth 
from what? Hard work? and thought? The 
hard work of the dandelion down, which floats 
over the meadow all day ; the hard work of a 
pismire that labors to raise a hillock all day, 
and even by moonlight. Suddenly I can come 
forward into the utmost apparent distinctness, 
and speak with a sort of emphasis to you ; and 
the next moment I am so faint an entity, and 
make so slight an impression, that nobody can 
find the traces of me. I try to hunt myself 
up, and find the little of me that is discoverable 
is falling asleep, and then I assist and tuck it 
up. It is getting late. How can / starve or 
feed ? Can / be said to sleep ? There is not 
enough of me even for that. If you hear a 
noise, 't aint I, 't aint I, as the dog says 
with a tin-kettle tied to his tail. I read of some- 
thing happening to another the other day : how 
happens it that nothing ever happens to me ? 
A dandelion down that never alights, set- 
tles, blown off by a boy to see if his mother

wanted him, some divine boy in the upper

Well, if there really is another such a meteor 
sojourning in these spaces, I would like to ask 
you if you know whose estate this is that we are 
on ? For my part I enjoy it well enough, what 
with the wild apples and the scenery; but I 
should n't wonder if the owner set his dog on 
me next. I could remember something not 
much to the purpose, probably; but if I stick 
to what I do know, then 

It is worth the while to live respectably unto 
ourselves. We can possibly get along with a 
neighbor, even with a bedfellow, whom we re- 
spect but very little ; but as soon as it comes to 
this, that we do not respect ourselves, then we 
do not get along at all, no matter how much 
money we are paid for halting. There are old 
heads in the world who cannot help me by their 
example or advice to live worthily and satisfac- 
torily to myself ; but I believe that it is in my 
power to elevate myself this very hour above 
the common level of my life. It is better to 
have your head in the clouds, and know where 
you are, if indeed you cannot get it above them, 
than to breathe the clearer atmosphere below 
them, and think that you are in paradise. 

Once you were in Milton l doubting what to

done. Dot and carry one. Wait not for a clear 
sight, for that you are to get. What you see 
clearly you may omit to do. Milton and Worces- 
ter? It is all Blake, Blake. Never mind the 
rats in the wall ; the cat will take care of them. 
All that men have said or are is a very faint 
rumor, and it is not worth the while to remem- 
ber or refer to that. If you are to meet God, 
will you refer to anybody out of that court? 
How shall men know how I succeed, unless they 
are in at the life ? I did not see the " Times " 
reporter there. 

Is it not delightful to provide one's self with 
the necessaries of life, to collect dry wood for 
the fire when the weather grows cool, or fruits 
when we grow hungry ? not till then. And 
then we have all the time left for thought ! 

Of what use were it, pray, to get a little wood 
to burn, to warm your body this cold weather, if 
there were not a divine fire kindled at the same 
time to warm your spirit ? 

" Unless above himself he can 
Erect himself, how poor a thing is man ! " 

I cuddle up by my stove, and there I get up 
another fire which warms fire itself. Life is so 
short that it is not wise to take roundabout ways, 
nor can we spend much time in waiting. Is it 
absolutely necessary, then, that we should do as 



JCT. 35.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 265 

we are doing ? Are we chiefly under obligations 
to the devil, like Tom Walker? Though it is 
late to leave off this wrong way, it will seem 
early the moment we begin in the right way ; 
instead of mid-afternoon, it will be early morn- 
ing with us. We have not got half way to dawn 
yet. 

As for the lectures, I feel that I have some- 
thing to say, especially on Traveling, Vague- 
ness, and Poverty ; but I cannot come now. I 
will wait till I am fuller, and have fewer engage- 
ments. Your suggestions will help me much 
to write them when I am ready. I am going to 
Haverhill l to-morrow, surveying, for a week or 
more. You met me on my last errand thither. 

I trust that you realize what an exaggerater 1 
am, that I lay myself out to exaggerate when- 
ever I have an opportunity, pile Pelion upon 
Ossa, to reach heaven so. Expect no trivial 
truth from me, unless I am on the witness-stand. 
I will come as near to lying as you can drive a 
coach-and-four. If it is n't thus and so with me, 
it is with something. I am not particular whether 
I get the shells or meat, in view of the hitter's 
worth. 

I see that I have not at all answered your let* 
ter, but there is time enough for that.

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, December 19, 1853. 

MR. BLAKE, My debt has accumulated so 
that I should have answered your last letter at 
once, if I had not been the subject of what is 
called a press of engagements, having a lecture 
to write for last Wednesday, and surveying 
more than usual besides. It has been a kind of 
running fight with me, the enemy not always 
behind me, I trust. 

True, a man cannot lift himself by his own 
waistbands, because he cannot get out of him- 
self ; but he can expand himself (which is bet- 
ter, there being no up nor down in nature), and 
so split his waistbands, being already within 
himself. 

You speak of doing and being, and the 'van- 
ity, real or apparent, of much doing. The suck- 
ers I think it is they make nests hi our 
river in the spring of more than a cart-load of 
small stones, amid which to deposit their ova. 
The other day I opened a muskrat's house. It 
was made of weeds, five feet broad at base, and 
three feet high, and far and low within it was a 
little cavity, only a foot in diameter, where the 
rat dwelt. It may seem trivial, this piling up 
of weeds, but so the race of muskrats is pre* 
served. We must heap up a great pile of doing, 



jre.36.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 267 

for a small diameter of being. Is it not imper- 
ative on us that we do something, if we only 
work in a treadmill? And, indeed, some sort 
of revolving is necessary to produce a centre 
and nucleus of being. What exercise is to the 
body, employment is to the mind and morals. 
Consider what an amount of drudgery must be 
performed, how much humdrum and prosaic 
labor goes to any work of the least value. There 
are so many layers of mere white lime in every 
shell to that thin inner one so beautifully tinted. 
Let not the shell-fish think to build his house of 
that alone ; and pray, what are its tints to him ? 
Is it not his smooth, close-fitting shirt merely, 
whose tints are not to him, being in the dark, 
but only when he is gone or dead, and his shell 
is heaved up to light, a wreck upon the beach, 
do they appear. With him, too, it is a Song of 
the Shirt, " Work, work, work ! " And the 
work is not merely a police in the gross sense, 
luit in the higher sense a discipline. If it is 
surely the means to the highest end we know, 
can any work be humble or disgusting? Will it 
not rather be elevating as a ladder, the means 
by which we are translated ? 

I low admirably the artist is made to accom- 
plish his self-culture by devotion to his art 1 The 
wood-sawyer, through his effort to do his work 
well, becomes not merely a better wood-sawyer,

but measurably a better man. Few are the men 
that can work on their navels, only some Brah- 
mins that I have heard of. To the painter is 
given some paint and canvas instead ; to the 
Irishman a hog, typical of himself. In a thou- 
sand apparently humble ways men busy them- 
selves to make some right take the place of some 
wrong, if it is only to make a better paste- 
blacking, and they are themselves so much 
the better morally for it. 

You say that you do not succeed much. Does 
it concern you enough that you do not ? Do you 
work hard enough at it? Do you get the benefit 
of discipline out of it ? If so, persevere. Is it 
a more serious thing than to walk a thousand 
miles in a thousand successive hours ? Do you 
get any corns by it? Do you ever think of hang- 
ing yourself on account of failure ? 

If you are going into that line, going to 
besiege the city of God, you must not only be 
strong in engines, but prepared with provisions 
to starve out the garrison. An Irishman came 
to see me to-day, who is endeavoring to get his 
family out to this New "World. He rises at half 
past four, milks twenty -eight cows (which has 
swollen the joints of his fingers), and eats his 
breakfast, without any milk in his tea or coffee, 
before six ; and so on, day after day, for six and 
a half dollars a month ; and thus he keeps his 



*r.36.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 269 

virtue in him, if he does not add to it ; and he 
regards me as a gentleman able to assist him ; 
but if I ever get to be a gentleman, it will be by 
working after my fashion harder than he does. 
If my joints are not swollen, it must be because 
I deal with the teats of celestial cows before 
breakfast (and the milker in this case is always 
allowed some of the milk for his breakfast), to 
say nothing of the flocks and herds of At hurt us 
afterward. 

It is the art of mankind to polish the world, 
and every one who works is scrubbing in some 
part.

You must not only aim aright, 

But draw the bow with all your might. 

You must qualify yourself to use a bow which 
no humbler archer can bend.

Who shall know it for a bow? It is not of yew- 
tree. It is straighter than a ray of light ; flexi- 
bility is not known for one of its qualities.

a condition to go abroad. I feel as if I had 
gone abroad the moment I put it on. It is, as 
usual, a production strange to me, the wearer, 
invented by some Count D'Orsay ; and the ma- 
ker of it was not acquainted with any of my real 
depressions or elevations. He only measured 
a peg to hang it on, and might have made the 
loop big enough to go over my head. It requires 
a not quite innocent indifference, not to say in- 
solence, to wear it. Ah ! the process by which 
we get our coats is not what it should be. 
Though the Church declares it righteous, and 
its priest pardons me, my own good genius tells 
me that it is hasty, and coarse, and false. I 
expect a time when, or rather an integrity by 
which, a man will get his coat as honestly and 
as perfectly fitting as a tree its bark. Now our 
garments are typical of our conformity to the 
ways of the world, i. e., of the devil, and to 
some extent react on us and poison us, like that 
shirt which Hercules put on. 

I think to come and see you next week, on 
Monday, if nothing hinders. I have just re- 
turned from court at Cambridge, whither I was 
called as a witness, having surveyed a water- 
privilege, about which there is a dispute, since 
you were here. 

Ah ! what foreign countries there are, greater 
in extent than the United States or Russia, and

with no more souls to a square mile, stretching 
away on every side from every human being 
with whom you have no sympathy. Their hu- 
manity affects me as simply monstrous. Rocks, 
earth, brute beasts, comparatively are not so 
strange to me. When I sit in the parlors and 
kitchens of some with whom my business brings 
me I was going to say in contact (business, 
like misery, makes strange bedfellows), I feel a 
sort of awe, and as forlorn as if I were cast 
away on a desolate shore. I think of Riley's 
Narrative l and his sufferings. You, who soared 
like a merlin with your mate through the realms 
of aether, in the presence of the unlike, drop at 
once to earth, a mere amorphous squab, divested 
of your air-inflated pinions. (By the way, ex- 
cuse this writing, for I am using the stub of the 
last feather I chance to possess.) You travel on, 
however, through this dark and desert world; 
you see in the distance an intelligent and sym- 
pathizing lineament ; stars come forth in the 
dark, and oases appear in the desert. 

But (to return to the subject of coats), we 
are wellnigh smothered under yet more fatal 
coats, which do not fit us, our whole lives long. 
Consider the cloak that our employment or sta- 
tion is ; how rarely men treat each other for 

1 An American Tftfimiin. wrecked on the coast of Arabia, 
a popular book. 



274 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1853, 

what in their true and naked characters they 
are ; how we use and tolerate pretension ; how 
the judge is clothed with dignity which does not 
belong to him, and the trembling witness with 
humility that does not belong to him, and the 
criminal, perchance, with shame or impudence 
which no more belong to him. It does not mat- 
ter so much, then, what is the fashion of the 
cloak with which we cloak these cloaks. Change 
the coat ; put the judge in the criminal-box, and 
the criminal on the bench, and you might think 
that you had changed the men. 

No doubt the thinnest of all cloaks is con- 
scious deception or lies; it is sleazy and frays 
out ; it is not close-woven like cloth ; but its 
meshes are a coarse network. A man can afford 
to lie only at the intersection of the threads ; 
but truth puts in the filling, and makes a consis- 
tent stuff. 

I mean merely to suggest how much the sta- 
tion affects the demeanor and self-respectability 
of the parties, and that the difference between 
the judge's coat of cloth and the criminal's is 
insignificant compared with, or only partially 
significant of, the difference between the coats 
which their respective stations permit them to 
wear. What airs the judge may put on over 
his coat which the criminal may not ! The 
judge's opinion (sentential) of the criminal sen- 



*r.37.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 275 

fences him, and is read by the clerk of the 
court, and published to the world, and executed 
by the sheriff ; but the criminal's opinion of the 
judge has the weight of a sentence, and is pub- 
lished and executed only in the supreme court 
of the universe, a court not of common pleas. 
How much juster is the one than the other? 
Men are continually sentencing each other ; but, 
whether we be judges or criminals, the sentence 
is ineffectual unless we continue ourselves. 

I am glad to hear that I do not always limit 
your vision when you look this way ; that you 
sometimes see the light through me ; that I am 
here and there windows, and not all dead wall. 
Might not the community sometimes petition a 
man to remove himself as a nuisance, a dark- 
ener of the day, a too large mote ?

MR, BLAKE, Methinks I have spent a rather 
unprofitable summer thus far. I have been too 
much with the world, as the poet might say. 1 
The completest performance of the highest du- 
ties it imposes would yield me but little satis- 
faction. Better the neglect of all such, because 
your life passed on a level where it was impossi- 
ble to recognize them. Latterly, I have heard

the very flies buzz too distinctly, and have ac- 
cused myself because I did not still this super- 
ficial din. We must not be too easily distracted 
by the crying of children or of dynasties. The 
Irishman erects his sty, and gets drunk, and 
jabbers more and more under my eaves, and I 
am responsible for all that filth and folly. I 
find it, as ever, very unprofitable to have much 
to do with men. It is sowing the wind, but not 
reaping even the whirlwind ; only reaping an 
unprofitable calm and stagnation. Our conver- 
sation is a smooth, and civil, and never-ending 
speculation merely. I take up the thread of it 
again in the morning, with very much such cour- 
age as the invalid takes his prescribed Seidlitz 
powders. Shall I help you to some of the mack- 
erel? It would be more respectable if men, as 
has been said before, instead of being such pigmy 
desperates, were Giant Despairs. Emerson says 
that his life is so unprofitable and shabby for 
the most part, that he is driven to all sorts of 
resources, and, among the rest, to men. I tell 
him that we differ only in our resources. Mine

any better, with its oratorios ? I have seen more 
men than usual, lately ; and, well as I was ac- 
quainted with one, I am surprised to find what 
vulgar fellows they are. They do a little busi- 
ness commonly each day, in order to pay their 
board, and then they congregate in sitting-rooms 
and feebly fabulate and paddle in the social 
slush; and when I think that they have suffi- 
ciently relaxed, and am prepared to see them 
steal away to their shrines, they go unashamed 
to their beds, and take on a new layer of sloth. 
They may be single, or have families in their 
fulneancy. I do not meet men who can have 
nothing to do with me because they have so 
much to do with themselves. However, I trust 
that a very few cherish purposes which they never 
declare. Only think, for a moment, of a man 
about his affairs ! How we should respect him ! 
How glorious he would appear ! Not working 
for any corporation, its agent, or president, but 
fulfilling the end of his being ! A man about 
his business would be the cynosure of all eyes. 

The other evening I was determined that I 
would silence this shallow din ; that I would 
walk in various directions and see if there was 
not to be found any depth of silence around. 
As Bonaparte sent out his horsemen in the Red 
Sea on all sides to find shallow water, so I sent 
forth my mounted thoughts to find deep water.

I left the village and paddled up the river to 
Fair Haven Pond. As the sun went down, I 
saw a solitary boatman disporting on the smooth 
lake. The falling dews seemed to strain and 
purify the air, and I was soothed with an infi- 
nite stillness. I got the world, as it were, by 
the nape of the neck, and held it under in the 
tide of its own events, till it was drowned, and 
then I let it go down stream like a dead dog. 
Vast hollow chambers of silence stretched away 
on every side, and my being expanded in pro- 
portion, and filled them. Then first could I 
appreciate sound, and find it musical. 1 

But now for your news. Tell us of the year. 

1 A lady who made such a night voyage with Thoreau, years 
before, says : " How wise he was to ask the elderly lady with 
a younger one for a row on the Concord River one moonlit 
night ! The river that night was as deep as the heavens above ; 
serene stars shone from its depths, as far off as the stars 
above. Deep answered unto deep in our souls, as the boat 
glided swiftly along, past low-lying fields, under overhanging 
trees. A neighbor's cow waded into the cool water, she 
became at once a Behemoth, a river-horse, hippopotamus, or 
river-god. A dog barked, he was Diana's hound, he waked 
Endymion. Suddenly we were landed on a little isle ; our 
boatman, our boat glided far off in the flood. We were left 
alone, in the power of the river-god ; like two white birds we 
stood on this bit of ground, the river flowing about us ; only 
the eternal powers of nature around us. Time for a prayer, 
perchance, and back came the boat and oarsman ; we were 
ferried to our homes, no question asked or answered. We 
had drank of the cup of the night, had felt the silence and 
the stars."

Have you fought the good fight ? What is the 
state of your crops ? Will your harvest answer 
well to the seed-time, and are you cheered by the 
prospect of stretching cornfields ? Is there any 
blight on your-fields, any murrain in your herds ? 
Have you tried the size and quality of your po- 
tatoes? It does one good to see their balls 
dangling in the lowlands. Have you got your 
meadow hay before the fall rains shall have set 
in ? Is there enough in your barns to keep your 
cattle over? Are you killing weeds nowadays? 
or have you earned leisure to go a-fishing ? Did 
you plant any Giant Regrets last spring, such 
as I saw advertised ? It is not a new species, 
but the result of cultivation and a fertile soil. 
They are excellent for sauce. How is it with 
your marrow squashes for winter use ? Is there 
likely to be a sufficiency of fall feed in your 
neighborhood ? What is the state of the springs ? 
I read that in your county there is more water 
on the hills than in the valleys. Do you find it 
easy to get all the help you require? Work 
early and late, and let your men and teams rest 
at noon. Be careful not to drink too much 
sweetened water, while at your hoeing, this hot 
weather. You can bear the heat much better

TO MAKSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, September 19, 1854. 

DEAR SIR, I am glad to hear from you and 
the Plymouth men again. The world still holds 
together between Concord and Plymouth, it 
seems. I should like to be with you while Mr. 
Alcott is there, but I cannot come next Sunday. 
I will come Sunday after next, that is, October 
1st, if that will do ; and look out for you at the 
depot. I do not like to promise more than one 
discourse. Is there a good precedent for two ? 

The first of Thoreau's many lecturing visits to 
Worcester, the home of his friend, Blake, was 
in April, 1849, and from that time onward he 
must have read lectures there at least annually, 
until his last illness, in 1861-62. By 1854, the 
lecturing habit, in several places besides Con- 
cord, had become established ; and there was a 
constant interchange of visits and excursions 
with his friends at Worcester, Plymouth, New 
Bedford, etc. Soon after the publication of 
"Walden," in the summer of 1854, Thoreau 
wrote these notes to Mr. Blake, touching on va- 
rious matters of friendly interest.

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, September 21, 1854. 

BLAKE, I have just read your letter, but 
do not mean now to answer it, solely for want 
of time to say what I wish. I directed a copy 
of " Walden " to you at Ticknor's, on the day of 
its publication, and it should have reached you 
before. I am encouraged to know that it inter- 
ests you as it now stands, a printed book, 
for you apply a very severe test to it, you 
make the highest demand on me. As for the 
excursion you speak of, I should like it right 
well, indeed I thought of proposing the same 
thing to you and Brown, some months ago. Per- 
haps it would have been better if I had done so 
then ; for in that case I should have been able 
to enter into it with that infinite margin to my 
views, spotless of all engagements, which I 
think so necessary. As it is, I have agreed to go 
a-lecturing to Plymouth, Sunday after next (Oc- 
tober 1) and to Philadelphia in November, and 
thereafter to the West, if they shall want me ; 
and, as I have prepared nothing in that shape, I 
feel as if my hours were spoken for. However, 
I think that, after having been to Plymouth, I 
may take a day or two if that date will suit 
you and Brown. At any rate I will write you 
then.

After I wrote to you, Mr. Watson postponed 
my going to Plymouth one week, i. e., till next 
Sunday ; and now he wishes me to carry my in- 
struments and survey his grounds, to which he 
has been adding. Since I want a little money, 
though I contemplate but a short excursion, I 
do not feel at liberty to decline this work. I do 
not know exactly how long it will detain me, 
but there is plenty of time yet, and I will write 
to you again perhaps from Plymouth. 

There is a Mr. Thomas Cholmondeley (pro- 
nounced Chumly) a young English author, stay- 
ing at our house at present, who asks me to 
teach him botany i. e., anything which I 
know ; and also to make an excursion to some 
mountain with him. He is a well-behaved per- 
son, and possibly I may propose his taking that 
run to Wachusett with us if it will be agreea- 
ble to you. Nay, if I do not hear any objection 
from you, I will consider myself at liberty to 
invite him. 

CONCORD, Saturday P. M., October 14, 1854. 
I have just returned from Plymouth, where I 
have been detained surveying much longer than 
I expected. What do you say to visiting Wa- 
chusett next Thursday ? I will start at 7-| A. M. 
unless there is a prospect of a stormy day, go

by cars to Westminster, and thence on foot five 
or six miles to the mountain-top, where I may 
engage to meet you, at (or before) 12 M. If the 
weather is unfavorable, I will try again, on Fri- 
day, and again on Monday. If a storm comes 
on after starting, I will seek you at the tavern 
in Princeton centre, as soon as circumstances 
will permit. I shall expect an answer at once, 
to clinch the bargain. 

The year 1854 was a memorable one in Tho- 
reau's life, for it brought out his most successful 
book, " Walden," and introduced him to the no- 
tice of the world, which had paid small attention 
to his first book, the "Week," published five 
years earlier. This year also made him acquainted 
with two friends to whom he wrote much, and 
who loved to visit and stroll with him around 
Concord, or in more distant places, Thomas 
Cholmondeley, an Englishman from Shropshire, 
and Daniel Ricketson, a New Bedford Quaker, 
of liberal mind and cultivated tastes, an au- 
thor and poet, and fond of corresponding with 
poets, as he did with the Ilowitts and William 
Barnes of England, and with Bryant, Emerson, 
Channing, and Thoreau, in America. Few of the 
letters to Cholmondeley are yet found, being 
buried temporarily in the mass of family papers 
at Condover Hall, an old Elizabethan mansion 



284 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1854, 

near Shrewsbury, which Thomas Cholmondeley 
inherited, and which remains in his family's pos- 
session since his own death at Florence in 1864. 
But the letters of the Englishman, recently 
printed in the " Atlantic Monthly " (December, 
1893), show how sincere was the attachment of 
this ideal friend to the Concord recluse, and how 
well he read that character which the rest of 
England, and a good part of America, have been 
so slow to recognize for what it really was. 

Thomas Cholmondeley was the eldest son of 
Rev. Charles Cowper Cholmondeley, rector of 
Overleigh, Cheshire, and of a sister to Reginald 
Heber, the celebrated bishop of Calcutta. He 
was born in 1823, and brought up at Hodnet, in 
Shropshire, where his father, a cousin of Lord 
Delamere, had succeeded his brother-in-law as 
rector, on the departure of Bishop Heber for 
India, in 1823. The son was educated at Oriel 
College, Oxford, a friend, and perhaps pupil of 
Arthur Hugh Clough, who gave him letters to 
Emerson in 1854. Years before, after leaving 
Oxford, he had gone with some relatives to New 
Zealand, and before coming to New England, he 
had published a book, " Ultima Thule," describ- 
ing that Australasian colony of England, where 
he lived for part of a year. He had previously 
studied in Germany, and traveled on the Conti- 
nent. He landed in America the first time in 



jrr.37.] THOREAU AND CHOLMONDELEY. 285 

August, 1854, and soon after went to Concord, 
where, at the suggestion of Emerson, he became 
an inmate of Mrs. Thoreau's family. This made 
him intimate with Henry Thoreau for a month 
or two, and also brought him into acquaintance 
with Ellery Channing, then living across the 
main street of Concord, in the west end of the 
village, and furnishing to Thoreau a landing- 
place for his boat under the willows at the foot 
of Channing's small garden. Alcott was not 
then in Concord, but Cholmondeley made his 
acquaintance in Boston, and admired his charac- 
ter and manners. 1 

With Channing and Thoreau the young Eng- 
lishman visited their nearest mountain, Wachu- 
sett, and in some of their walks the artist Rowse, 
who made the first portrait of Thoreau, joined, 
for he was then in Concord, late in 1854, en- 
graving the fine head of Daniel Webster from 
a painting by Ames, and this engraving he gave 
both to Thoreau and to Chohnondeley. In De- 
cember the Englishman, whose patriotism was 

1 See Memoir of lirotuon Alcott, pp. 485-494. The remark 
of Emerson quoted on p. 486, that Cholmondeley was "the 
on of a Shropshire squire," wan not strictly correct, hia father 
being a Cheshire clergyman of a younger branch of the an- 
cient race of Cholmondeley. But he was the grandson of a 
Shropshire squire (owner of land), for his mother was daugh- 
ter and sister of such gentlemen, and it was her brother Rich- 
ard who presented Reginald Heber and Charles Cholmondeley 
to the living of Hodnet, near Market Dray ton.

roused by the delays and calamities of England 
in her Crimean war, resolved to go home and 
raise a company, as he did, first spending some 
weeks in lodgings at Boston (Orange Street) in 
order to hear Theodore Parker preach and visit 
Harvard College, of which I was then a student, 
in the senior class. He visited me and my class- 
mate, Edwin Morton, and called on some of the 
Cambridge friends of Clough. In January, 
1855, he sailed for England, and there received 
the letter of Thoreau printed on pages 295-298. 
The acquaintance with Mr. Ricketson began 
by letter before Cholmondeley reached Concord, 
but Thoreau did not visit him until December, 
1854. Mr. Eicketson says, " In the summer of 
1854 I purchased, in New Bedford, a copy of 
'Walden.' I had never heard of its author, 
but in this admirable and most original book I 
found so many observations on plants, birds, and 
natural objects generally in which I was also in- 
terested, that I felt at once I had found a con- 
genial spirit. During this season I was rebuild- 
ing a house in the country, three miles from 
New Bedford, and had erected a small building 
which was called my ' shanty ; ' and my family 
being then in my city house, I made this build- 
ing my temporary home. From it I addressed 
my first letter to the author of ' Walden.' In 
reply he wrote, ' I had duly received your very

kiiul and frank letter, but delayed to answer it 
thus long because I have little skill as a corre- 
spondent, and wished to send you something 
more than my thanks. I was gratified by your 
prompt and hearty acceptance of my book. 
Yours is the only word of greeting I am likely 
to receive from a dweller in the woods like my- 
self, from where the whippoorwill and cuckoo 
are heard, and there are better than moral 
clouds drifting, and real breezes blowing.' From 
that year until his death in 1862 we exchanged 
visits annually, and letters more frequently. He 
was much interested in the botany of our region, 
finding here many marine plants he had not be- 
fore seen. When our friendship began, the ad- 
mirers of his only two published books were 
few; most prominent among them were Emer- 
son, Alcott, and Channing of Concord, Messrs. 
Blake and T. Brown of Worcester, Mr. Marston 
Watson of Plymouth, and myself. Many ac- 
cused him of being an imitator of Emerson ; 
others thought him unsocial, impracticable, and 
ascetic. Now he was none of these ; a more 
original man never lived, nor one more thor- 
oughly personifying civility ; no man could hold 
a finer relationship with his family than he." 

In reply to Thoreau's letter just quoted, Mr. 
Ricketson wrote further of himself and his local- 
ity, and Thoreau thus continued :

CONCORD, October 1, 1854 

DEAR SIR, Your account excites in me a 
desire to see the Middleborough Ponds, of which 
I had already heard somewhat; as also some 
very beautiful ponds on the Cape, in Harwich, 
I think, near which I once passed. I have some- 
times also thought of visiting that remnant of 
our Indians still living near you. But then, you 
know, there is nothing like one's native fields 
and lakes. The best news you send me is, not 
that Nature with you is so fair and genial, but 
that there is one there who likes her so well. 
That proves all that was asserted. 

Homer, of course, you include in your list of 
lovers of Nature ; and, by the way, let me men- 
tion here, for this is " my thunder " lately, 
William Gilpin's long series of books on the Pic- 
turesque, with their illustrations. If it chances 
that you have not met with these, I cannot just 
now frame a better wish than that you may one 
day derive as much pleasure from the inspection 
of them as I have. 

Much as you have told me of yourself, you 
have still, I think, a little the advantage of me 
in this correspondence, for I have told you still 
more in my book. You have therefore the broad- 
est mark to fire at.

A young Englishman, Mr. Cholmondeley, is

TO HAKBISON BLAKE. 

CONCORD, December 22, 1854. 

MB. BLAKE, I will lecture for your Lyceum 
on the 4th of January next ; and I hope that I 
shall have time for that good day out of doors. 
Mr. Cholmondeley is in Boston, yet perhaps I 
may invite him to accompany me. I have en- 
gaged to lecture at New Bedford on the 26th 
inst., stopping with Daniel Ricketson, three 
miles out of town ; and at Nantucket on the 
28th, so that I shall be gone all next week. 
They say there is some danger of being weather- 
bound at Nantucket ; but I see that others run 
the same risk. You had better acknowledge the 
receipt of this at any rate, though you should 
write nothing else ; otherwise I shall not know 
whether you get it; but perhaps you will not 
wait till you have seen me, to answer my letter 
(of December 19). I will tell you what I think 
of lecturing when I see you. Did you see the 
notice of " Walden " in the last " Anti-Slavery 
Standard " ? You will not be surprised if I tell 
you that it reminded me of you.

As above mentioned, Thoreau went to lecture 
at Nantucket, and on his way spent a day or 
two with Mr. Ricketson, reaching his house on 
Christmas Day. His host, who then saw him for 
the first time, says : 

" I had expected him at noon, but as he did 
not arrive, I had given him up for the day. In 
the latter part of the afternoon I was clearing 
off the snow from my front steps, when, looking 
up, I saw a man walking up the carriage-road, 
bearing a portmanteau in one hand and an um- 
brella in the other. He was dressed in a long 
overcoat of dark color, and wore a dark soft 
hat. I had no suspicion it was Thoreau, and 
rather supposed it was a peddler of small 
wares." 

This was a common mistake to make. When 
Thoreau ran the gauntlet of the Cape Cod vil- 
lages, " feeling as strange," he says, " as if he 
were in a town in China," one of the old fish- 
ermen could not believe that he had not some- 
thing to sell. Being finally satisfied that it was 
not a peddler with his pack, the old man said, 
"Wai. it makes no odds what 'tis you carry, 
so long as you carry Truth along with ye." Mr. 
Ricketson soon came to the same conclusion 
about his visitor, and in the early September of 
1855 returned the visit.

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, December 19, 1854. 

MR. BLAKE, I suppose you have heard of 
my truly providential meeting with Mr. T. 
Brown ; providential because it saved me from 
the suspicion that my words had fallen alto- 
gether on stony ground, when it turned out that 
there was some Worcester soil there. You will 
allow me to consider that I correspond with him 
through you. 

I confess that I am a very bad correspondent, 
so far as promptness of reply is concerned ; but 
then I am sure to answer sooner or later. The 
longer I have forgotten you, the more I remem- 
ber you. For the most part I have not been idle 
since I saw you. How does the world go with 
you? or rather, how do you get along without it? 
I have not yet learned to live, that I can see, 
and I fear that I shall not very soon. I find, 
however, that in the long run things correspond 
to my original idea, that they correspond to 
nothing else so much ; and thus a man may 
really be a true prophet without any great exer- 
tion. The day is never so dark, nor the night 
even, but that the laws at least of light still pre- 
vail, and so may make it light in our minds if 
they are open to the truth. There is considera-

dinner and supper ; but it will not directly an- 
swer any good purpose that I know of, and it is 
just as easy to be sane. We have got to know 
what both life and death are, before we can be- 
gin to live after our own fashion. Let us be 
learning our a-b-c's as soon as possible. I never 
yet knew the sun to be knocked down and rolled 
through a mud-puddle ; he conies out honor- 
bright from behind every storm. Let us then 
take sides with the sun, seeing we have so much 
leisure. Let us not put all we prize into a foot- 
ball to be kicked, when a bladder will do as 
well. 

When an Indian is burned, his body may be 
broiled, it may be no more than a beefsteak. 
What of that ? They may broil his heart, but 
they do not therefore broil his courage, his 
principles. Be of good courage! That is the 
main thing. 

If a man were to place himself in an attitude 
to bear manfully the greatest evil that can be 
inflicted on him, he would find suddenly that 
there was no such evil to bear ; his brave back 
would go a-begging. When Atlas got his back 
made up, that was all that was required. (In 
this case a priv., not pleon., and rX^/xi.) The 
world rests on principles. The wise gods will 
never make underpinning of a man. But as 
long as he crouches, and skulks, and shirks his 



*r.37.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 293 

work, every creature that has weight will be 
treading on his toes, and crushing him ; he will 
himself tread with one foot on the other foot. 

The monster is never just there where we 
think he is. What is truly monstrous is our 
cowardice and sloth. 

Have no idle disciplines like the Catholic 
Church and others ; have only positive and fruit- 
ful ones. Do what you know you ought to do. 
Why should we ever go abroad, even across the 
way, to ask a neighbor's advice? There is a 
nearer neighbor within us incessantly telling us 
how we should behave. But we wait for the 
neighbor without to tell us of some false, easier 
way. 

They have a census-table in which they put 
down the number of the insane. Do you believe 
that they put them all down there? Why, in 
every one of these houses there is at least one 
man fighting or squabbling a good part of his 
time with a dozen pet demons of his own breed- 
ing and cherishing, which are relentlessly gnaw- 
ing at his vitals ; and if perchance he resolve at 
length that he will courageously combat them, 
he says, " Ay ! ay ! I will attend to you after 
dinner ! " And, when that time comes, he con- 
cludes that he is good for another stage, and 
reads a column or two about the Eastern War I 
Pray, to be in earnest, where is Sevastopol? 



294 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1854, 

Who is Menchikoff? and Nicholas behind there? 
who the Allies ? Did not we fight a little (little 
enough to be sure, but just enough to make it 
interesting) at Alma, at Balaclava, at Inker- 
111:11111 ? We love to fight far from home. Ah ! 
the Minie musket is the king of weapons. Well, 
let us get one then. 

I just put another stick into my stove, a 
pretty large mass of white oak. How many men 
will do enough this cold winter to pay for the 
fuel that will be required to warm them ? I sup- 
pose I have burned up a pretty good-sized tree 
to-night, and for what? I settled with Mr. 
Tarbell for it the other day ; but that was n't 
the final settlement. I got off cheaply from him. 
At last, one will say, "Let us see, how much 
wood did you burn, sir ? " And I shall shudder 
to think that the next question will be, " What 
did you do while you were warm?" Do we 
think the ashes will pay for it ? that God is an 
ash-man ? It is a fact that we have got to ren- 
der an account for the deeds done in the body. 

Who knows but we shall be better the next 
year than we have been the past ? At any rate, 
I wish you a really new year, commencing 
from the instant you read this, and happy or 
unhappy, according to your deserts. 

The early part of 1855 was spent by Thomas 



JPT.37.] TO THOMAS CHOLMONDELEY. 295 

Cholmondeley in a tiresome passage to England, 
whence he wrote (January 27) to say to Thoreau 
that he had reached Shropshire, and been com- 
missioned captain in the local militia, in prepa- 
ration for service at Sevastopol, but reminding 
his Concord friend of a half promise to visit 
England some day. To this Thoreau made 
answer thus : 

TO THOMAS CHOLMONDELEY (AT HODNET). 

CONCORD, Mass., February 7, 1865. 

DEAR CHOLMONDELEY, I am glad to hear 
that you have arrived safely at Hodnet, and that 
there is a solid piece of ground of that name 
which can support a man better than a floating 
plank, in that to me as yet purely historical 
England. But have I not seen you with my 
own eyes, a piece of England herself, and was 
not your letter come out to me thence ? I have 
now reason to believe that Salop is as real a 
place as Concord ; with at least as good an un- 
derpinning of granite, floating on liquid fire. I 
congratulate you on having arrived safely at 
that floating isle, after your disagreeable pass- 
age in the steamer America. So are we not all 
making a passage, agreeable or disagreeable, in 
the steamer Earth, trusting to arrive at last at 
some less undulating Salop and brother's house? 

I cannot say that I am surprised to hear that 



296 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1855, 

you have joined the militia, after what I have 
heard from your lips ; but I am glad to doubt if 
there will be occasion for your volunteering into 
the line. Perhaps I am thinking of the saying 
that it " is always darkest just before day." I 
believe it is only necessary that England be fully 
awakened to a sense of her position, in order 
that she may right herself, especially as the 
weather will soon cease to be her foe. I wish 
I could believe that the cause in which you are 
embarked is the cause of the people of England. 
However, I have no sympathy with the idleness 
that would contrast this fighting with the teach- 
ings of the pulpit; for, perchance, more true 
virtue is being practiced at Sevastopol than in 
many years of peace. It is a pity that we seem 
to require a war, from time to time, to assure us

I still take my daily walk, or skate over Con- 
cord fields or meadows, and on the whole have 
more to do with nature than with man. We 
have not had much snow this winter, but have 
had some remarkably cold weather, the mercury, 
February 6, not rising above 6 below zero dur- 
ing the day, and the next morning falling to 
26. Some ice is still thirty inches thick about 
us. A rise hi the river has made uncommonly 
good skating, which I have improved to the ex- 
tent of some thirty miles a day, fifteen out and 
fifteen in.

pointed Professor of Belles-Lettres in Harvard 
University, in place of Longfellow, resigned, 
and will go very soon to spend another year in 
Europe, before taking his seat. 

I am from time to time congratulating myself 
on my general want of success as a lecturer; 
apparent want of success, but is it not a real tri- 
umph? I do my work clean as I go along, and 
they will not be likely to want me anywhere 
again. So there is no danger of my repeating 
myself, and getting to a barrel of sermons, 
which you must upset, and begin again with. 

My father and mother and sister all desire to 
be remembered to you, and trust that you will 
never come within range of Russian bullets. Of 
course, I would rather think of you as settled 
down there in Shropshire, in the camp of the 
English people, making acquaintance with your 
men, striking at the root of the evil, perhaps 
assaulting that rampart of cotton bags that you 
tell of. But it makes no odds where a man goes 
or stays, if he is only about his business. 

Let me hear from you, wherever you are, and 
believe me yours ever in the good fight, whether 
before Sevastopol or under the wreken. 

While Cholmondeley's first letter from Eng- 
land was on its way to Concord, Thoreau was 



Jtr.37.] THOREAU IN CAMBRIDGE. 299 

one day making his occasional call at the Har- 
vard College Library (where he found and was 
allowed to take away volumes relating to his 
manifold studies), when it occurred to him to 
call at my student-chamber in Holworthy Hall, 
and there leave a copy of his " Week." I had 
never met him, and was then out ; the occasion 
of his call was a review of his two books that 
had come out a few weeks earlier in the " Har- 
vard Magazine," of which I was an editor and 
might be supposed to have had some share in 
the criticism. The volume was left with my 
classmate Lyman, accompanied by a message 
that it was intended for the critic in the Maga- 
zine. Accordingly, I gave it to Edwin Morton, 
who was the reviewer, and notified Thoreau by 
letter of that fact, and of my hope to see him 
soon in Cambridge or Concord. 1 To this he 
replied in a few days as below : 

1 I had been vwitinj* Emerson occasionally for a year or 
two, and knew Alcott well at this time ; was also intimate with 
Cholmondeloy in the autumn of 1854, but had never seen Tho- 
reau ; a fact which shows how recluse were then his habits. 
The letter below, and the long one describing his trip to Min- 
nesota, were the only ones I received from him in a friendship 
of seven yean. See Sanborn's Thorrau, pp. 105-200. Edwin 
Morton was my classmate. See pp. 286, 853, 440.

DEAR SIR, I fear that you did not get the 
note which I left with the Librarian for you, 
and so will thank you again for your politeness. 
I was sorry that I was obliged to go into Boston 
almost immediately. However, I shall be glad 
to see you whenever you come to Concord, and 
I will suggest nothing to discourage your com- 
ing, so far as I am concerned ; trusting that you 
know what it is to take a partridge on the wing. 
You tell me that the author of the criticism is 
Mr. Morton. I had heard as much, and in- 
deed guessed more. I have latterly found Con- 
cord nearer to Cambridge than I believed I 
should, when I was leaving my Alma Mater ; 
and hence you will not be surprised if even I 
feel some interest in the success of the " Har- 
vard Magazine." 

Believe me yours truly, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

At this time I was under engagement with 
Mr. Emerson and others in Concord to take 
charge of a small school there in March; and 
did so without again seeing the author of " Wai- 
den " in Cambridge. Soon after my settlement 
at Concord, in the house of Mr. Channing, just

opposite Thoreau's, he made an evening call on 
me and my sister (April 11, 1855), but I had 
already met him more than once at Mr. Emer- 
son's, and was even beginning to take walks 
with him, as frequently happened in the next 
six years. In the following summer I began 
to dine daily at his mother's table, and thus saw 
him almost every day for three years. 

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, June 27, 1855. 

MR. BLAKE, I have been sick and good for 
nothing but to lie on my back and wait for 
something to turn up, for two or three months. 
This has compelled me to postpone several 
things, among them writing to you, to whom I 
am so deeply in debt, and inviting you and 
Brown to Concord, not having brains ade- 
quate to such an exertion. I should feel a little 
less ashamed if I could give any name to my 
disorder, but I cannot, and our doctor cannot 
help me to it, and I will not take the name of 
any disease in vain. However, there is one con- 
solation in being sick ; and that is the possibil- 
ity that you may recover to a better state than 
you were ever in before. I expected in the win- 
ter to be deep in the woods of Maine in my 
canoe, long before this ; but I am so far from 
this that I can only take a languid walk in Con- 
cord streets.

I do not know how the mistake arose about 
the Cape Cod excursion. The nearest I have 
come to that with anybody is this : About a 
month ago Channing proposed to me to go to 
Truro on Cape Cod with him, and board there 
a while, but I declined. For a week past, 
however, I have been a little inclined to go there 
and sit on the seashore a week or more ; but I 
do not venture to propose myself as the compan- 
ion of him or of any peripatetic man. Not that 
I should not rejoice to have you and Brown or 
C. sitting there also. I am not sure that C. 
really wishes to go now ; and as I go simply for 
the medicine of it, I should not think it worth 
the while to notify him when I am about to take 
my bitters. Since I began this, or within five 
minutes, I have begun to think that I will start 
for Truro next Saturday morning, the 30th. I 
do not know at what hour the packet leaves 
Boston, nor exactly what kind of accommoda- 
tion I shall find at Truro. 

I should be singularly favored if you and 
Brown were there at the same time ; and though 
you speak of the 20th of July, I will be so bold 
as to suggest your coming to Concord Friday 
night (when, by the way, Garrison and Phillips 
hold forth here), and going to the Cape with 
me. Though we take short walks together there, 
we can have long talks, and you and Brown will 



*r.37.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 303 

have time enough for your own excursions be- 
sides. 

I received a letter from Cholmondeley last 
winter, which I should like to show you, as well 
as his book. 1 He said that he had " accepted 
the offer of a captaincy in the Salop Militia," 
and was hoping to take an active part in the war 
before long. 

I thank you again and again for the encour- 
agement your letters are to me. But I must 
stop this writing, or I shall have to pay for it. 

NORTH TKUBO, July 8, 1856. 

There being no packet, I did not leave Bos- 
ton till last Thursday, though I came down on 
Wednesday, and Channing with me. There is 
no public house here ; but we are boarding with 
Mr. James Small, the keeper, in a little house 
attached to the Highland Lighthouse. It is true 
the table is not so clean as could be desired, 
but I have found it much superior in that re- 
spect to the Provincetown hotel. They are what 
is called " good livers." Our host has another 
larger and very good house, within a quarter of 
a mile, unoccupied, where he says he can accom- 
modate several more. He is a very good man 
to deal with, has often been the representative 
of the town, and is perhaps the most intelligent

man in it. I shall probably stay here as much 
as ten days longer : board 13.50 per week. So 
you and Brown had better come down forthwith. 
You will find either the schooner Melrose or an- 
other, or both, leaving Commerce Street, or else 
T Wharf, at 9 A. M. (it commonly means 10), 
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, if not 
other days. We left about 10 A. M., and reached 
Provincetown at 5 P. M., a very good run. A 
stage runs up the Cape every morning but Sun- 
day, starting at 4| A. M., and reaches the post- 
office in North Truro, seven miles from Prov- 
incetown, and one from the lighthouse, about 
6 o'clock. If you arrive at P. before night, you 
can walk over, and leave your baggage to be 
sent. You can also come by cars from Boston 
to Yarmouth, and thence by stage forty miles 
more, through every day, but it costs much 
more, and is not so pleasant. Come by all 
means, for it is the best place to see the ocean 
in these States. I hope I shall be worth meet- 
ing.

You say that you hope I will excuse your fre- 
quent writing. I trust you will excuse my in-

am beginning to be better. I think to leave the

TO HABRISOX BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, September 26, 1855. 

MR. BLAKE, The other day I thought that 
my health must be better, that I gave at last 
a sign of vitality, because I experienced a 
slight chagrin. But I do not see how strength 
is to be got into my legs again. These months 
of feebleness have yielded few, if any, thoughts, 
though they have not passed without serenity, 
such as our sluggish Musketaquid suggests. I 
hope that the harvest is to come. I trust that 
you have at least warped up the stream a little 
daily, holding fast by your anchors at night, 
since I saw you, and have kept my place for me 
while I have been absent 

Mr. Ricketson of New Bedford has just made 
me a visit of a day and a half, and I have had a 
quite good time with him. He and Channing 
have got on particularly well together. He is 



306 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1853, 

a man of very simple tastes, notwithstanding his 
wealth ; a lover of nature ; but, above all, singu- 
larly frank and plain-spoken. I think that you 
might enjoy meeting him. 

Sincerity is a great but rare virtue, and we 
pardon to it much complaining, and the betrayal 
of many weaknesses. R. says of himself, that 
he sometimes thinks that he has all the infirm- 
ities of genius without the genius ; is wretched 
without a hair-pillow, etc. ; expresses a great 
and awful uncertainty with regard to " God," 
" Death," his " immortality ; " says, " If I only 
knew," etc. He loves Cowper's " Task " better 
than anything else ; and thereafter, perhaps, 
Thomson, Gray, and even Howitt. He has evi- 
dently suffered for want of sympathizing com- 
panions. He says that he sympathizes with 
much in my books, but much in them is naught 
to him, " namby-pamby," " stuff," " mys- 
tical." Why will not I, having common sense, 
write in plain English always; teach men in 
detail how to live a simpler life, etc. ; not go off 

into ? But I say that I have no scheme 

about it, no designs on men at all ; and, if I 
had, my mode would be to tempt them with the 
fruit, and not with the manure. To what end 
do I lead a simple life at all, pray ? That I may 
teach others to simplify their lives ? and so all 
our lives be simplified merely, like an algebraic 



r.38.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 307 

formula ? Or not, rather, that I may make use 
of the ground I have cleared, to live more wor- 
thily and profitably ? I would fain lay the most 
stress forever on that which is the most impor- 
tant, imports the most to me, though it were 
only (what it is likely to be) a vibration in the 
air. As a preacher, I should be prompted to 
tell men, not so much how to get their wheat- 
bread cheaper, as of the bread of life compared 
with which that is bran. Let a man only taste 
these loaves, and he becomes a skillful economist 
at once. He '11 not waste much time in earning 
those. Don't spend your time in drilling sol- 
diers, who may turn out hirelings after all, but 
give to undrilled peasantry a country to fight 
for. The schools begin with what they call the 
elements, and where do they end ? 

I was glad to hear the other day that Higgin- 

son and were gone to Ktaadn ; it must be 

so much better to go to than a Woman's Rights 
or Abolition Convention ; better still, to the de- 
lectable primitive mounts within you, which you 
have dreamed of from your youth up, and seen, 
perhaps, in the horizon, but never climbed. 

But how do you do ? Is the air sweet to you ? 
Do you find anything at which you can work, 
accomplishing something solid from day to day ? 
Have you put sloth and doubt behind, consider- 
ably? had one redeeming dreaui this summer? 



308 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1855, 

I dreamed, last night, that I could vault over 
any height it pleased me. That was something ; 
and I contemplated myself with a slight satisfac- 
tion in the morning for it. 

Methinks I will write to you. Methinks you 
will be glad to hear. We will stand on solid 
foundations to one another, la column planted 
on this shore, you on that. We meet the same 
sun in his rising. We were built slowly, and 
have come to our bearing. We will not mutu- 
ally fall over that we may meet, but will grandly 
and eternally guard the straits. Methinks I see 
an inscription on you, which the architect made, 
the stucco being worn off to it. The name of 
that ambitious worldly king is crumbling away. 
I see it toward sunset in favorable lights. Each 
must read for the other, as might a sailer-by. 
Be sure you are star-y-pointing still. How is it 
on your side? I will not require an answer 
until you think I have paid my debts to you. 

I have just got a letter from Bicketson, urg- 
ing me to come to New Bedford, which possibly 
I may do. He says I can wear my old clothes 
there. 

Let me be remembered in your quiet house. 



*r.3s.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 309 

TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, September 27, 1855. 

FBIEND RICKETSON, I am sorry that you 
were obliged to leave Concord without seeing 
more of it, its river and woods, and various 
pleasant walks, and its worthies. I assure you 
that I am none the worse for my walk with you, 
but on all accounts the better. Methinks I am 
regaining my health ; but I would like to know 
first what it was that ailed me. 

I have not yet conveyed your message to Mr. 
Hosmer, 1 but will not fail to do so. That idea 
of occupying the old house is a good one, quite 
feasible, and you could bring your hair-pillow 
with you. It is an inn in Concord which I had 
not thought of, a philosopher's inn. That 
large chamber might make a man's idea expand 
proportionably. It would be well to have an 
interest in some old chamber in a deserted house 
in every part of the country which attracted us. 

1 This was Edmund Homier, a Concord farmer, before men- 
tioned as a friend of Emeraon, who wan fond of quoting his 
sagacious and often cynical remark*. lie had entertained 
George Curtis and the Alcotts at his farm on the " Turnpike," 
southeast of Emerson's ; but now was living on a part of the 
old manor of Governor Winthrop, which soon passed to the 
ownership of the Hunts ; and this house which Mr. liicketson 
proposed to lease was the " old Hunt farmhouse," in truth 
built for the Winthrops two centuries before. It was soon 
after torn down. 



310 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1855, 

There would be no such place to receive one's 
guests as that. If old furniture is fashionable, 
why not go the whole house at once ? I shall 
endeavor to make Mr. Hosmer believe that the 
old house is the chief attraction of his farm, and 
that it is his duty to preserve it by all honest 
appliances. You might take a lease of it in per- 
petuo, and done with it. 

I am so wedded to my way of spending a day, 
require such broad margins of leisure, and such 
a complete wardrobe of old clothes, that I am 
ill-fitted for going abroad. Pleasant is it some- 
times to sit at home, on a single egg all day, in 
your own nest, though it may prove at last to be 
an egg of chalk. The old coat that I wear is 
Concord ; it is my morning-robe and study-gown, 
my working dress and suit of ceremony, and my 
nightgown after all. Cleave to the simplest ever. 
Home, home, home. Cars sound like cares 
to me. 

I am accustomed to think very long of going 
anywhere, am slow to move. I hope to hear 
a response of the. oracle first. However, I think 
that I will try the effect of your talisman on the 
iron horse next Saturday, and dismount at Tar- 
kiln Hill. Perhaps your sea air will be good for 
me. I conveyed your invitation to Channing, 
but he apparently will not come. 

Excuse my not writing earlier ; but I had not 
decided.

CONCORD, October 12, 1855. 

MR. RICKETSON, I fear that you had a 
lonely and disagreeable ride back to New Bed- 
ford through the Carver woods and so on, 
perhaps in the rain, too, and I am in part an- 
swerable for it. I feel very much in debt to 
you and your family for the pleasant days I 
spent at Brooklawn. Tell Arthur and Walton l 
that the shells which they gave me are spread 
out, and make quite a show to inland eyes. Me- 
thinks I still hear the strains of the piano, the 
violin, and the flageolet blended together. Ex. 
cuse me for the noise which I believe drove you 
to take refuge in the shanty. That shanty is 
indeed a favorable place to expand in, which I 
fear I did not enough improve. 

On my way through Boston I inquired for 
Gilpiii's works at Little, Brown & Co.'s, Mon- 
roe's, Ticknor's, and Burnham's. They have not 
got them. They told me at Little, Brown & 
Co.'s that his works (not complete), in twelve 
vols., 8vo, were imported and sold in this coun- 
try five or six years ago for about fifteen dollars. 
Their terms for importing are ten per cent on 
the cost. I copied from the " London Catalogue

and his squaw, Sepits, " Sharper." I find my 
map of the State to be the best I have seen of 
that district. It is a question whether the islands 
of Long Pond or Great Quitticus offer the great- 
est attractions to a Lord of the Isles. That 
plant which I found on the shore of Long Pond 
chances to be a rare and beautiful flower, the 
Sdbattia chloroides, referred to Plymouth. 

In a Description of Middleborough in the 
Hist. Coll., vol. iii., 1810, signed Nehemiah Ben- 
net, Middleborough, 1793, it is said: "There 
is on the easterly shore of Assawampsitt Pond, 
on the shore of Betty's Neck, two rocks which 
have curious marks thereon (supposed to be done 
by the Indians), which appear like the stoppings 
of a person with naked feet which settled into 
the rocks ; likewise the prints of a hand on sev- 
eral places, with a number of other marks ; also 
there is a rock on a high hill a little to the east- 
ward of the old stone fishing wear, where there 
is the print of a person's hand in said rock." 

It would be well to look at those rocks again 
more carefully ; also at the rock on the hill. 

I should think that you would like to explore 
Sinpatuct Pond in Rochester, it is so large 
and near. It is an interesting fact that the ale- 
wives used to ascend to it, if they do not still, 
both from Mattapoisett and through Great 
Quitticus.

There will be no trouble about the chamber 
in the old house, though, as I told you, Mr. Hos- 
mer may expect some compensation for it. He 
says, " Give my respects to Mr. Ricketson, and 
tell him that I cannot be at a large expense to 
preserve an antiquity or curiosity. Nature must 
do its work." " But," say I, " he asks you only 
not to assist nature." 

TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, October 16, 1855. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I have got both your 
letters at once. You must not think Concord 
so barren a place when Channing 1 is away. 
There are the river and fields left yet ; and I, 
though ordinarily a man of business, should 
have some afternoons and evenings to spend 
with you, I trust, that is, if you could stand 
so much of me. If you can spend your time 
profitably here, or without ennui, having an oc- 
casional ramble or tete-a-tete with one of the na- 
tives, it will give me pleasure to have you in the 
neighborhood. You see I am preparing you for 
our awful unsocial ways, keeping in our dens 
a good part of the day, sucking our claws per- 
haps. But then we make a religion of it, and 
that you cannot but respect. 

1 Mr. Channing had gone, October, 1855, to live in New Bed- 
ford, and help edit the Mercury there. 



.38.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 315 

If you know the taste of your own heart, and 
like it, come to Concord, and I '11 warrant you 
enough here to season the dish with, ay, even 
though Channing and Emerson and I were all 
away. We might paddle quietly up the river. 
Then there are one or two more ponds to be 
seen, etc. 

I should very much enjoy further rambling 
with you in your vicinity, but must postpone it 
for the present. To tell the truth, I am plan- 
ning to get seriously to work after these long 
months of inefficiency and idleness. I do not 
know whether you are haunted by any such 
demon which puts you on the alert to pluck the 
fruit of each day as it passes, and store it safely 
in your bin. True, it is well to live abandonedly 
from time to time ; but to our working hours 
that must be as the spile to the bung. So for a 
long season I must enjoy only a low slanting 
gleam in my mind's eye from the Middleborough 
Ponds far away. 

Methinks I am getting a little more strength 
into those knees of mine ; and, for my part, I 
believe that God docs delight in the strength of 
a man's legs.

MR. BLAKE, Thank you ! thank you for 
going a-wooding with me, and enjoying it, 
for being warmed by my wood fire. I have in- 
deed enjoyed it much alone. I see how I might 
enjoy it yet more with company, how we might 
help each other to live. And to be admitted to 
Nature's hearth costs nothing. None is ex- 
cluded, but excludes himself. You have only 
to push aside the curtain. 

I am glad to hear that you were there too. 
There are many more such voyages, and longer 
ones, to be made on that river, for it is the water 
of life. The Ganges is nothing to it. Observe 
its reflections, no idea but is familiar to it. 
That river, though to dull eyes it seems terres- 
trial wholly, flows through Elysium. What pow- 
ers bathe in it invisible to villagers ! Talk of 
its shallowness, that hay-carts can be driven 
through it at midsummer ; its depth passeth my 
understanding. If, forgetting the allurements 
of the world, I could drink deeply enough of it ; 
if, cast adrift from the shore, I could with com- 
plete integrity float on it, I should never be seen 
on the Mill-dam again. 1 If there is any depth in

me, there is a corresponding depth in it. It is 
the cold blood of the gods. I paddle and bathe 
in their artery. 

I do not want a stick of wood for so trivial a 
use as to burn even, but they get it over night, 
and carve and gild it that it may please my eye. 
What persevering lovers they are ! What infi- 
nite pains to attract and delight us ! They will 
supply us with fagots wrapped in the daintiest 
packages, and freight paid ; sweet-scented woods, 
and bursting into flower, and resounding as if 
Orpheus had just left them, these shall be our 
fuel, and we still prefer to chaffer with the wood- 
merchant ! 

The jug we found still stands draining bottom 
up on the bank, on the sunny side of the house. 
That river, who shall say exactly whence it 
came, and whither it goes? Does aught that 
flows come from a higher source ? Many things 
drift downward on its surface which would en- 
rich a man. If you could only be on the alert 
all day, and every day ! And the nights are as 
long as the days. 

Do you not think you could contrive thus to 
get woody fibre enough to bake your wheaten 
bread with? Would you not perchance have 
tasted the sweet crust of another kind of bread 
in the mean while, which ever hangs ready baked 
on the bread-fruit trees of the world ?

Talk of burning your smoke after the wood 
has been consumed ! There is a far more impor- 
tant and warming heat, commonly lost, which 
precedes the burning of the wood. It is the 
smoke of industry, which is incense. I had been 
so thoroughly warmed in body and spirit, that 
when at length my fuel was housed, I came near 
selling it to the ash-man, as if I had extracted 
all its heat. 

You should have been here to help me get in 
my boat. The last time I used it, November 
27th, paddling up the Assabet, I saw a great 
round pine log sunk deep in the water, and with 
labor got it aboard. When I was floating this 
home so gently, it occurred to me why I had 
found it. It was to make wheels with to roll my 
boat into winter quarters upon. So I sawed off 
two thick rollers from one end, pierced them for 
wheels, and then of a joist which I had found 
drifting on the river in the summer I made an 
axletree, and on this I rolled my boat out.

forty. Yet I had no doubt you would get quite 
enough of me. Do not give it up so easily. The 
old house is still empty, and Hosmer is easy to

Channing was here about ten days ago. I 
told him of my visit to you, and that he too must 
go and see you and your country. 1 This may 
have suggested his writing to you. 

That island lodge, especially for some weeks 
in a summer, and new explorations in your vicin- 
ity, are certainly very alluring ; but such are my 
engagements to myself, that I dare not promise 
to wend your way, but will for the present only 
heartily thank you for your kind and generous 
offer. When my vacation comes, then look out. 

My legs have grown considerably stronger, 
and that is all that ails me. 

But I wish now above all to inform you, 
though I suppose you will not be particularly 
interested, that Cholmondeley has gone to the 
Crimea, " a complete soldier," with a design, 
when he returns, if he ever returns, to buy a 
cottage in the South of England, and tempt me

in buying, and has caused to be forwarded to me

by Chapman, a royal gift, in the shape of twenty- 
one distinct works (one in nine volumes, 
forty-four volumes in all), almost exclusively re- 
lating to ancient Hindoo literature, and scarcely 
one of them to be bought in America. 1 I am 
familiar with many of them, and know how to 
prize them. I send you information of this as 
I might of the birth of a child. 

Please remember me to all your family. 

1 These books were ordered by Cholmondeley in London, 
and sent to Boston just as he was starting for the Crimean 
war, in October, 1855, calling them " a nest of Indian books." 
They included Mill's History of British India, several transla- 
tions of the sacred books of India, and one of them in Sanscrit ; 
the works of Bunsen, so far as then published, and other valu- 
able books. In the note accompanying this gift, Cholmonde- 
ley said, " I think I never found so much kindness in all my 
travels as in your country of New England." In return, 
Thorean sent his English friend, in 1857, his own Week, Em- 
erson's poems, Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, and F. 1,. 
Olmsted's book on the Southern States (then preparing for 
the secession which they attempted four years later). This 
was perhaps the first copy of Whitman seen in England, and 
when Cholmondeley began to read it to his stepfather, Rev. Z. 
Macanlay, at Hodnet, that clergyman declared he would not 
hear it, and threatened to throw it in the fire. On reading the 
Week (he had received Walden from Thoreau when first in 
America), Cholmondeley wrote me, " Would you tell dear 
Thoreau that the lines I admire so much in his Week begin 
thus: 

' Low-anchored cloud, 
Newfoundland air,' etc. 

In my mind the beet thing ha ever wrote."

DEAR SIR, I have been out of town, else I 
should have acknowledged your letter before. 
Though not in the best mood for writing, I will 
say what I can now. You plainly have a rare, 
though a cheap, resource in your shanty. Per- 
haps the time will come when every country-seat 
will have one, when every country-seat will 
be one. I would advise you to see that shanty 
business out, though you go shanty-mad. Work 
your vein till it is exhausted, or conducts you 
to a broader one ; so that Channing shall stand 
before your shanty, and say, " That is your 
house." 

This has indeed been a grand winter for me, 
and for all of us. I am not considering how 
much I have enjoyed it. What matters it how 
happy or unhappy we have been, if we have 
minded our business and advanced our affairs. 
I have made it a part of my business to wade in 
the snow and take the measure of the ice. The 
ice on our pond was just two feet thick on the 
first of March ; and I have to-day been survey- 
ing a wood-lot, where I sank about two feet at 
every step. 

It is high time that you, fanned by the warm 
breezes of the Gulf Stream, had begun to " lay"

for even the Concord hens have, though one 
wonders where they find the raw material of 
egg-shell here. Beware how you put off your 
laying to any later spring, else your cackling 
will not have the inspiring early spring sound. 

As for visiting you in April, though I am 
inclined enough to take some more rambles in 
your neighborhood, especially by the seaside, I 
dare not engage myself, nor allow you to expect 
me. The truth is, I have my enterprises now as 
ever, at which I tug with ridiculous feebleness, 
but admirable perseverance, and cannot say when 
I shall be sufficiently fancy-free for such an ex- 
cursion. 

You have done well to write a lecture on 
Cowper. In the expectation of getting you to 
read it here, I applied to the curators of our Ly- 
ceum ; * but, alas, our Lyceum has been a failure 
this winter for want of funds. It ceased some 
weeks since, with a debt, they tell me, to be car- 
ried over to the next year's account. Only one 
more lecture is to be read by a Signer Some- 
body, an Italian, paid for by private subscription, 
as a deed of charity to the lecturer. They are 
not rich enough to offer you your expenses even, 
though probably a month or two ago they would 
have been glad of the chance.

TO DANIEL BICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, March 27, 1856. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I was surprised to 
hear the other day that Channing was in New 
Bedford. When he was here last (in December, 
I think), he said, like himself, in answer to my 
inquiry where he lived, " that he did not know 
the name of the place ; " so it has remained in a 
degree of obscurity to me. I am rejoiced to 
hear that you are getting on so bravely with 
him and his verses. He and I, as you know, 
have been old cronies, 1 

" Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill, 
Together both, ere the high lawns appeared 
Under the opening eyelids of the morn, 
We drove afield, and both together beared," etc. 

"But O, the heavy change," now he is gone. 

1 Ellery Channing is mentioned, though not by name, in the 
Week (pp. 211, 467), and in Walden (p. 414). He was the 
comrade of Thoreau in Berkshire, and on the Hudson, in New 
Hampshire, Canada, and Cape Cod, and in many rambles nearer 
Concord. He was also a companion of Hawthorne in his river 
voyages, as mentioned in the Mosses. 



Jtr.as.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 325 

The Channing you have seen and described is 
the real Simon Pure. You have seen him. 
Many a good ramble may you have together ! 
You will see in him still more of the same kind 
to attract and to puzzle you. How to serve him 
most effectually has long been a problem with 
his friends. Perhaps it is left for you to solve 
it. I suspect that the most that you or any one 
can do for him is to appreciate his genius, 
to buy and read, and cause others to buy and 
read his poems. That is the hand which he 
has put forth to the world, take hold of that. 
Review them if you can, perhaps take the 
risk of publishing something more which he may 
write. Your knowledge of Cowper will help 
you to know Channing. He will accept sym- 
pathy and aid, but he will not bear questioning, 
unless the aspects of the sky are particularly 
auspicious. He will ever be " reserved and 
enigmatic," and you must deal with him at 
arm's length. I have no secrets to tell you 
concerning him, and do not wish to call obvious 
excellences and defects by far-fetched names. 
Nor need I suggest how witty and poetic he is, 
and what an inexhaustible fund of good fellow- 
ship you will find in him.

CONCORD, March 13, 1856. 

ME. BLAKE, It is high time I sent you a 
word. I have not heard from Harrisburg since 
offering to go there, and have not been invited 
to lecture anywhere else the past winter. So 
you see I am fast growing rich. This is quite 
right, for such is my relation to the lecture-goers, 
I should be surprised and alarmed if there were 
any great call for me. I confess that I am con- 
siderably alarmed even when I hear that an indi- 
vidual wishes to meet me, for my experience 
teaches me that we shall thus only be made cer- 
tain of a mutual strangeness, which otherwise we 
might never have been aware of. 

I have not yet recovered strength enough for 
such a walk as you propose, though pretty well 
again for circumscribed rambles and chamber 
work. Even now, I am probably the greatest 
walker in Concord, to its disgrace be it said. 
I remember our walks and talks and sailing in 
the past with great satisfaction, and trust that 
we shall have more of them erelong, have more 
woodings-up, for even in the spring we must 
still seek " fuel to maintain our fires." 

As you suggest, we would fain value one an- 
other for what we are absolutely, rather than 
relatively. How will this do for a symbol of 
sympathy ? 



r.38.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 327 




As for compliments, even the stars praise me, 
and I praise them. They and I sometimes be- 
long to a mutual admiration society. Is it not 
so with you ? I know you of old. Are you not 
tough and earnest to be talked at, praised, or 
blamed ? Must you go out of the room because 
you are the subject of conversation? Where 
will you go to, pray ? Shall we look into the 
" Letter Writer " to see what compliments are 
admissible ? I am not afraid of praise, for I have 
practiced it on myself. As for my deserts, I 
never took an account of that stock, and in this 
connection care not whether I am deserving or 
not. When I hear praise coming, do I not ele- 
vate and arch myself to hear it like the sky, and 
as impersonally ? Think I appropriate any of it 
to my weak legs ? No. Praise away till all is 
blue. 

I see by the newspapers that the season for 
making sugar is at hand. Now is the time, 
whether you be rock, or white-maple, or hickory. 
I trust that you have prepared a store of sap- 
tubs and sumach-spouts, and invested largely in 
kettles. Early the first frosty morning, tap your

know. It matters not how little juice you get, 
if you get all you can, and boil it down. I made 
just one crystal of sugar once, one twentieth of 
an inch cube, out of a pumpkin, and it suf- 
ficed. Though the yield be no greater than 
that, this is not less the season for it, and it will 
be not the less sweet, nay, it will be infinitely 
the sweeter. 

Shall, then, the maple yield sugar, and not 
man ? Shall the farmer be thus active, and surely 
have so much sugar to show for it, before this 
very March is gone, while I read the newspa- 
per ? While he works in his sugar-camp let me 
work in mine, for sweetness is in me, and to 
sugar it shall come, it shall not all go to leaves 
and wood. Am I not a sugar-maple man, then ? 
Boil down the sweet sap which the spring causes 
to flow within you. Stop not at syrup, go 
on to sugar, though you present the world with 
but a single crystal, a crystal not made from 
trees in your yard, but from the new life that 
stirs in your pores. Cheerfully skim your kettle, 
and watch it set and crystallize, making a holi- 
day of it if you will. Heaven will be propitious 
to you as to him. 

Say to the farmer, There is your crop ; here 
is mine. Mine is a sugar to sweeten sugar with. 
If you will listen to me, I will sweeten your whole 
load, your whole life. 



*r.38.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 329 

Then will the callers ask, Where is Blake ? 
He is in his sugar-camp on the mountain-side. 
Let the world await him. Then will the little 
boys bless you, and the great boys too, for such 
sugar is the origin of many condiments, Blak- 
i;ms in the shops of Worcester, of new form, 
with their mottoes wrapped up in them. Shall 
men taste only the sweetness of the maple and 
the cane the coming year? 

A walk over the cmst to Asnybumskit, stand- 
ing there in its inviting simplicity, is tempting 
to think of, making a fire on the snow under 
some rock ! The very poverty of outward na- 
ture implies an inward wealth in the walker. 
What a Golconda is he conversant with, thaw- 
ing his fingers over such a blaze ! But

have a hat carried round for it. I have just 
been reading some papers to see if they would 
do for your company ; but though I thought 
pretty well of them as long as I read them to 
myself, when I got an auditor to try them on, I 
felt that they would not answer. How could I 
let you drum up a company to hear them ? In 
fine, what I have is either too scattered or loosely 
arranged, or too light, or else is too scientific and 
matter of fact (I run a good deal into that of 
late) for so hungry a company. 

I am still a learner, not a teacher, feeding 
somewhat omnivorously, browsing both stalk and 
leaves ; but I shall perhaps be enabled to speak 
with the more precision and authority by and 
by, if philosophy and sentiment are not buried 
under a multitude of details. 

I do not refuse, but accept your invitation, 
only changing the time. I consider myself in-

Brown come to Concord on Saturday, if the 
weather promises well, and spend the Sunday

save some of our money (which is of next impor- 
tance to our souls), and lose I do not know 
what. You say you talked of coming here be- 
fore ; now do it. I do not propose this because I 
think that I am worth your spending time with, 
but because I hope that we may prove flint and 
steel to one another. It is at most only an hour's 
ride farther, and you can at any rate do what 
you please when you get here. 

Then we will see if we have any apology to 
offer for our existence. So come to Concord, 
come to Concord, come to Concord ! or your 
suit shall be defaulted. 

As for the dispute about solitude and society, 
any comparison is impertinent. It is an idling 
down on the plain at the base of a mountain, in- 
stead of climbing steadily to its top. Of course 
you will be glad of all the society you can get to 
go up with. Will you go to glory with me ? is the 
burden of the song. I love society so much that 
I swallowed it all at a gulp, that is, all that 
came in my way. It is not that we love to bo

spirit of your talk. 

In the spring of 1856, Mr. Alcott, then living 
in Walpole, N. H., visited Concord, and while 
there suggested to Thoreau that the upper valley 
of the Connecticut, in which Walpole lies, was 
good walking-ground, and that he would be glad 
to see him there. When autumn began to hover 
in the distance, Thoreau recalled this invitation, 
and sent the letter below.

count ; yet from time to time I have some 
thoughts which would be the better for an air- 
ing. I also wish to get some hints from Sep- 
tember on the Connecticut to help me under- 
stand that season on the Concord ; to snuff the 
musty fragrance of the decaying year in the 
primitive woods. There is considerable cellar- 
room in my nature for such stores ; a whole row 
of bins waiting to be filled, before I can cele- 
brate my Thanksgiving. Mould is the richest 
of soils, yet / am not mould. It will always be

As fortune would have it, Mr. Alcott was 
then making his arrangements for a conversa- 
tional tour in the vicinity of New York ; but he 
renewed the invitation for himself, while repeat- 
ing it in the name of Mrs. Alcott and his daugh- 
ters. Thoreau made the visit, I believe, and 
some weeks later, at the suggestion of Mr. Al- 
cott, he was asked by Marcus Spring of New 
York to read lectures and survey their estate for 
a community at Perth Amboy, N. J., in which 
Mr. Spring and his friend*, the Hirneys, WrMs 
Grimkcs, etc., had united for social and educa-

tional purposes. It was a colony of radical opin- 
ions and old-fashioned culture ; the Grimkes 
having been bred in Charleston, S. C., which 
they left by reason of their opposition to negro 
slavery, and the elder Birney having held slaves 
in Alabama until his conscience bade him eman- 
cipate them, after which he, too, could have no 
secure home among slaveholders. He was the 
first presidential candidate of the voting Aboli- 
tionists, as Lincoln was the last ; and his friend, 
Theodore Weld, who married Miss Grimke, had 
been one of the early apostles of emancipation 
in Ohio. Their circle at Eagleswood appealed 
to Thoreau's sense of humor, and is described by 
him in the next letter. 

In October, 1856, Mr. Spring, whom Mr. Al- 
cott was then visiting, wrote to Thoreau inviting 
him to come to Eagleswood, give lectures, and 
survey two hundred acres of land belonging to 
the community, laying out streets and making a 
map of the proposed village. Thoreau accepted 
the proposal, and soon after wrote the following 
letter, which Miss Thoreau submitted to Mr. 
Emerson for publication, with other letters, in 
the volume of 1865 ; but he returned it, inscribed 
" Not printable at present." The lapse of time 
has removed this objection.

DEAR SOPHIA, I have hardly had time and 
repose enough to write to you before. I spent 
the afternoon of Friday (it seems some months 
ago) in Worcester, but failed to see [Harrison] 
Blake, he having " gone to the horse-race " in 
Boston ; to atone for which I have just received 
a letter from him, asking me to stop at Worces- 
ter and lecture on my return. I called on 
[Theo.] Brown and [T. W.] Higginson ; in the 
evening came by way of Norwich to New York 
in the steamer Commonwealth, and, though it 
was so windy inland, had a perfectly smooth pas- 
sage, and about as good a sleep as usually at 
home. Reached New York about seven A. M., 
too late for the John Potter (there was n't any 
Jonas), so I spent the forenoon there, called on 
Greeley (who was not in), met [F. A. T.] Bel- 
lew in Broadway and walked into his workshop, 
read at the Astor Library, etc. I arrived here, 
about thirty miles from New York, about five 
p. M. Saturday, in company with Miss E. Pea-

wagon from the Landing to Eagleswood, which 
last place she has just left for the winter.

how many work (one or two familiar faces and 
more familiar names have turned up), a few 
shops and offices, an old farmhouse, and Mr. 
Spring's perfectly private residence, within 
twenty rods of the main building. The city of 
Perth Amboy is about as big as Concord, and 
Eagleswood is one and a quarter miles south- 
west of it, on the Bay side. The central fact 
here is evidently Mr. [Theodore] Weld's school, 
recently established, around which various other 
things revolve. Saturday evening I went to the 
schoolroom, hall, or what not, to see the children 
and their teachers and patrons dance. Mr. 
Weld, a kind-looking man with a long white 
beard, danced with them, and Mr. [E. J.] Cut- 
ler, his assistant (lately from Cambridge, who is 
acquainted with Sanborn), Mr. Spring, and oth- 
ers. This Saturday evening dance is a regular 
thing, and it is thought something strange if you 
don't attend. They take it for granted that you 
want society ! 

Sunday forenoon I attended a sort of Quaker 
meeting at the same place (the Quaker aspect 
and spirit prevail here, Mrs. Spring says, 
"Does thee not?"), where it was expected that 
the Spirit would move me (I having been previ- 
ously spoken to about it) ; and it, or something

else, did, an inch or so. I said just enough 
to set them a little by the ears and make it 
lively. I had excused myself by saying that I 
could not adapt myself to a particular audience ; 
for all the speaking and lecturing here have ref- 
erence to the children, who are far the greater 
part of the audience, and they are not so bright 
as New England children. Imagine them sit- 
ting close to the wall, all around a hall, with old 
Quaker-looking men and women here and there. 
There sat Mrs. Weld [Grimke] and her sister, 
two elderly gray-headed ladies, the former in ex- 
treme Bloomer costume, which was what you 
may call remarkable ; Mr. Arnold Buffum, with 
broad face and a great white beard, looking like 
a pier-head made of the cork-tree with the bark 
on, as if he could buffet a considerable wave ; 
James G. Birney, formerly candidate for the 
presidency, with another particularly white head 
and beard ; Edward Palmer, the anti-money man 
(for whom communities were made), with his 
ample beard somewhat grayish. Some of them, 
I suspect, are very worthy people. Of course 
you are wondering to what extent all these make 
one family, and to what extent twenty. Mrs. 
Kirkland 1 (and this a name only to me) I saw. 
She has just bought a lot here. They all know

then of New York, a writer of wit uiul fainu at that time.

more about your neighbors and acquaintances 
than you suspected. 

On Monday evening I read the Moose story 
to the children, to their satisfaction. Ever since 
I have been constantly engaged in surveying 
Eagleswood, through woods, salt marshes, and 
along the shore, dodging the tide, through 
bushes, mud, and beggar ticks, having no time 
to look up or think where I am. (It takes ten 
or fifteen minutes before each meal to pick the 
beggar ticks out of my clothes ; burrs and the 
rest are left, and rents mended at the first con- 
venient opportunity.) I shall be engaged per- 
haps as much longer. Mr. Spring wants me to 
help him about setting out an orchard and vine- 
yard, Mr. Birney asks me to survey a small 
piece for him, and Mr. Alcott, who has just come 
down here for the third Sunday, says that Gree- 
ley (I left my name for him) invites him and 
me to go to his home with him next Saturday 
morning and spend the Sunday. 

It seems a twelvemonth since I was not here, 
but I hope to get settled deep into my den again 
erelong. The hardest thing to find here is soli- 
tude and Concord. I am at Mr. Spring's 
house. Both he and she and their family are 
quite agreeable. 

I want you to write to me immediately (just 
left off to talk French with the servant man),

and let father and mother put in a word. To 
them and to Aunts, love from 

HENRY. 

The date of this visit to Eagleswood is worthy 
of note, because in tliat November Thoreau 
made the acquaintance of the late Walt Whit- 
man, in whom he ever after took a deep interest. 
Accompanied by Mr. Alcott, he called on Whit- 
man, then living at Brooklyn ; and I remember 
the calm enthusiasm with which they both spoke 
of Whitman upon their return to Concord. 
** Three men," said Emerson, in his funeral 
eulogy of Thoreau, " have of late years strongly 
impressed Mr. Thoreau, John Brown, his In- 
dian guide in Maine, Joe Polis, and a third per- 
son, not known to this audience." This last was 
Whitman, who has since become well known to 
a larger audience. 

TO HARRISOX BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

EAOLESWOOD, N. J., November 10, 1856. 
MR. BLAKE, I have been here much longer 
than I expected, but have deferred answering 
yon, because I could not foresee when I should 
return. I do not know yet within three or four 
days. This uncertainty makes it iin]x>ssihle for 
me to appoint a day to meet you, until it shall be 
too late to hear from you again. I think, there- 



340 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1866, 

fore, that I must go straight home. I feel some 
objection to reading that " What shall it profit " 
lecture again in Worcester ; but if you are 
quite sure that it will be worth the while (it is 
a grave consideration), I will even make an 
independent journey from Concord for that 
purpose. I have read three of my old lectures 
(that included) to the Eagleswood people, and, 
unexpectedly, with rare success, i. e., I was 
aware that what I was saying was silently taken 
in by their ears. 

You must excuse me if I write mainly a busi- 
ness letter now, for I am sold for the time, 
am merely Thoreau the surveyor here, and 
solitude is scarcely obtainable in these parts. 

Alcott has been here three times, and, Satur- 
day before last, I went with him and Greeley, by 
invitation of the last, to G.'s farm, thirty-six 
miles north- of New York. The next day A. 
and I heard Beecher preach ; and what was 
more, we visited Whitman the next morning (A. 
had already seen him), and were much inter- 
ested and provoked. He is apparently the 
greatest democrat the world has seen. Kings 
and aristocracy go by the board at once, as they 
have long deserved to. A remarkably strong 
though coarse nature, of a sweet disposition, and 
much prized by his friends. Though peculiar and 
rough in his exterior, his skin (all over (?)) red,

he is essentially a gentleman. I am still some- 
what in a quandary about him, feel that he 
is essentially strange to me, at any rate ; but I 
am surprised by the sight of him. He is very 
broad, but, as I have said, not fine. He said 
that I misapprehended him. I am not quite 
sure that I do. He told us that he loved to ride 
up and down Broadway all day on an omnibus, 
sitting beside the driver, listening to the roar 
of the carts, and sometimes gesticulating and 
declaiming Homer at the top of his voice. He 
has long been an editor and writer for the news- 
papers, was editor of the " New Orleans Cres- 
cent " once ; but now has no employment but 
to read and write in the forenoon, and walk in 
the afternoon, like all the rest of the scribbling 
gentry. 

I shall probably be in Concord next week ; so 
you can direct to me there. 

TO HARRISON* BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, December 6, 1866. 

MR. BLAKE, I trust that you got a note 
from me at Eagleswood, about a fortnight ago. 
I passed through Worcester on the morning of 
the 25th of November, and spent several hours 
(from 3.30 to 6.20) in the travelers' room at the 
depot, as in a dream, it now seems. As the first 
Harlem train uiu-xp. i-t-.-tlly roiiin vtcl with the 



342 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1856, 

first from Fitchburg, I did not spend the forenoon 
with you as I had anticipated, on account of 
baggage, etc. If it had been a seasonable hour, 
I should have seen you, i. e., if you had not 
gone to a horse-race. But think of making a 
call at half past three in the morning ! (would 
it not have implied a three o'clock in the morn- 
ing courage in both you and me ?) as it were, 
ignoring the fact that mankind are really not at 
home, are not out, but so deeply in that they 
cannot be seen, nearly half their hours at this 
season of the year. 

I walked up and down the main street, at half 
past five, in the dark, and paused long in front 
of Brown's store, trying to distinguish its fea- 
tures ; considering whether I might safely leave 
his " Putnam " in the door-handle, but concluded 
not to risk it. Meanwhile a watchman (?) 
seemed to be watching me, and I moved off. 
Took another turn round there, and had the 
very earliest offer of the Transcript 1 from an 
urchin behind, whom I actually could not see, it 
was so dark. So I withdrew, wondering if you 
and B. would know if I had been there. You 
little dream who is occupying Worcester when 
you are all asleep. Several things occurred 
there that night which I will venture to say were 
not put into the Transcript. A cat caught a

mouse at the depot, and gave it to her kitten 
to play with. So that world-famous tragedy 
goes on by night as well as by day, and nature is 
emphatically wrong. Also I saw a young Irish- 
man kneel before his mother, as if in prayer, 
while she wiped a cinder out of his eye with her 
tongue ; and I found that it was never too late 
(or early ?) to learn something. These things 
transpired while you and B. were, to all practical 
purposes, nowhere, and good for nothing, not 
even for society, not for horse-races, nor 
the taking back of a " Putnam's Magazine." It 
is true, I might have recalled you to life, but it 
would have been a cruel act, considering the 
kind of life you would have come back to. 

However, I would fain write to you now by 
broad daylight, and report to you some of my 
life, such as it is, and recall you to your life, 
which is not always lived by you, even by day- 
light. Blake ! Brown ! are you awake ? are 
you aware what an ever-glorious morning this 
is, what long-expected, never-to-be-repeated 
opportunity is now offered to get life and know- 
ledge? 

For my part, I am trying to wake up, to 
wring slumber out of my pores ; for, generally, 
I take events as unconcernedly as a fence post, 
absorb wet and cold like it, and am pleasantly 
tickled with lichens slowly spreading over me. 



344 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1856, 

Could I not be content, then, to be a cedar post, 
which lasts twenty-five years? Would I not 
rather be that than the farmer that set it ? or 
he that preaches to the farmer? and go to the 
heaven of posts at last? I think I should like 
that as well as any would like it. But I should 
not care if I sprouted into a living tree, put 
forth leaves and flowers, and bore fruit. 

I am grateful for what I am and have. My 
thanksgiving is perpetual. It is surprising how 
contented one can be with nothing definite, 
only a sense of existence. Well, anything for 
variety. I am ready to try this for the next ten 
thousand years, and exhaust it. How sweet to 
think of ! my extremities well charred, and my 
intellectual part too, so that there is no danger 
of worm or rot for a long while. My breath is 
sweet to me. O how I laugh when I think of my 
vague, indefinite riches. No run on my bank 
can drain it, for my wealth is not possession but 
enjoyment. 

What are all these years made for ? and now 
another winter comes, so much like the last? 
Can't we satisfy the beggars once for all ? 

Have you got in your wood for this winter ? 
What else have you got in? Of what use a 
great fire on the hearth, and a confounded little 
fire in the heart? Are you prepared to make a 
decisive campaign, to pay for your costly tui- 



T.30.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 345 

tioii, to pay for the suns of past summers, 
for happiness and uuhappiness lavished upon 
you? 

Does not Time go by swifter than the swift- 
est equine trotter or racker ? 

Stir up Brown. Remind him of his duties, 
which outrun the date and span of Worcester's 
years past and to come. Tell him to be sure 
that he is on the main street, however narrow it 
may be, and to have a lit sign, visible by night 
as well as by day. 

Are they not patient waiters, they who wait 
for us ? But even they shall not be losers. 

December 7. 

That Walt Whitman, of whom I wrote to you, 
is the most interesting fact to me at present. I 
have just read his second edition (which he 
gave me), and it has done me more good than 
any reading for a long time. Perhaps I remem- 
ber best the poem of Walt Whitman, an Amer- 
ican, and the Sun-Down Poem. There are two 
or three pit-res in the book which are disagree- 
able, to say the least ; simply sensual. He does 
not celebrate love at all. It is as if the beasts 
s)Mkc. I think that men have not been ashamed 
of thciiisflvfs without reason. No doubt there 
have always been dens where such deeds were 
unblushingly recited, and it is no merit to com* 



346 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [185G, 

pete with their inhabitants. But even on this 
side he has spoken more truth than any Ameri- 
ican or modern that I know. I have found his 
poem exhilarating, encouraging. As for its 
sensuality, and it may turn out to be less 
sensual than it appears, - I do not so much 
wish that those parts were not written, as that 
men and women were so pure that they could 
read them without harm, that is, without under- 
standing them. One woman told me that no 
woman could read it, as if a man could read 
what a woman could not. Of course Walt 
Whitman can communicate to us no experience, 
and if we are shocked, whose experience is it 
that we are reminded of ? 

On the whole, it sounds to me very brave and 
American, after whatever deductions. I do not 
believe that all the sermons, so called, that have 
been preached in this land put together are 
equal to it for preaching. 

We ought to rejoice greatly in him. He oc- 
casionally suggests something a little more than 
human. You can't confound him with the other 
inhabitants of Brooklyn or New York. How 
they must shudder when they read him ! He is 
awfully good. 

To be sure I sometimes feel a little imposed 
on. By his heartiness and broad generalities he 
puts me into a liberal frame of mind prepared

to see wonders, as it were, sets me upon a 
hill or in the midst of a plain, stirs me well 
up, and then throws in a thousand of brick. 
Though rude, and sometimes ineffectual, it is a 
great primitive poem, an alarum or trumpet- 
note ringing through the American camp. 
"Wonderfully like the Orientals, too, considering 
that when I asked him if he had read them, he 
answered, " No : tell me about them." 

I did not get fur in conversation with him, 
two more being present, and among the few 
things which I chanced to say, I remember that 
one was, in answer to him as representing Amer- 
ica, that I did not think much of America or of 
politics, and so on, which may have been some- 
what of a damper to him. 

Since I have seen him, I find that I am not 
disturbed by any brag or egoism in his book. He 
may turn out the least of a braggart of all, hav- 
ing a better right to be confident. 

He is a great fellow. 

There is in Alcott's diary an account of this 
interview with Whitman, and the Sunday morn- 
ing in Ward Beecher's Brooklyn church, from 
which a few passages may be taken. Hardly any 
person met by either of these Concord friends in 
their later years made so deep an impression on 
both as did this then almost unknown poet and

thinker, concerning whom Cholmondeley wrote 
to Thoreau in 1857 : " Is there actually such a 
man as Whitman? Has any one seen or han- 
dled him ? His is a tongue ' not understanded ' 
of the English people. I find the gentleman 
altogether left out of the book. It is the first 
book I have ever seen which I should call a 
4 new book.' " 

Mr. Alcott writes under date of November 7, 
1856, in New York: "Henry Thoreau arrives 
from Eagleswood, and sees Swinton, a wise young 
Scotchman, and Walt Whitman's friend, at my 
room (15 Laight Street), Thoreau declining 
to accompany me to Mrs. Botta's parlors, as in- 
vited by her. He sleeps here. (November 8.) 
We find Greeley at the Harlem station, and ride 
with him to his farm, where we pass the day, and 
return to sleep in the city, Greeley coming in 
with us ; Alice Gary, the authoress, accompany- 
ing us also. (Sunday, November 9.) We cross 
the ferry to Brooklyn, and hear Ward Beecher 
at the Plymouth Church. It was a spectacle, 
and himself the Preacher, if preacher there be 
anywhere now in pulpits. His auditors had to 
weep, had to laugh, under his potent magnetism, 
while his doctrine of justice to all men, bond and 
free, was grand. House, entries, aisles, galleries, 
all were crowded. Thoreau called it pagan, but 
I pronounced it good, very good, the best I

had witnessed for many a day, and hopeful for 
the coming time. At dinner at Mrs. Manning's 
Miss M. S. was there, curious to see Thoreau. 
After dinner we called on Walt Whitman (Tho- 
reau and I), but finding him out, we got all we 
could from his mother, a stately, sensible matron, 
believing absolutely in Walter, and telling us 
how good he was, and how wise when a boy ; and 
how his four brothers and two sisters loved him, 
and still take counsel of the great man he has 
grown to be. We engaged to call again early in 
the morning, when she said Walt would be glad 
to see us. (Monday, 10th.) Mrs. Tyndale of 
Philadelphia goes with us to see Walt, Walt 
the satyr, the Bacchus, the very god Pan. We 
sat with him for two hours, and much to our de- 
light ; he promising to call on us at the Interna- 
tional at ten in the morning to-morrow, and there 
have the rest of it." Whitman failed to call at 
his hour the next day.

you may not be thwarted by the cares and temp- 
tations of life. Depend on it, now is the ac-

yourself better disposed or freer to attend to 
your culture than at this moment. When They 
who inspire us with the idea are ready, shall not 
we be ready also ? 

I do not remember anything which Confucius 
has said directly respecting man's " origin, pur- 
pose, and destiny." He was more practical than 
that. He is full of wisdom applied to human 
relations, to the private life, the family, 
government, etc. It is remarkable that, accord- 
ing to his own account, the sum and substance 
of his teaching is, as you know, to do as you 
would be done by. 

He also said (I translate from the French), 
" Conduct yourself suitably towards the persons 
of your family, then you will be able to instruct 
and to direct a nation of men." 

" To nourish one's self with a little rice, to 
drink water, to have only his bended arm to sup-

and a special friend of Emerson ; then inquires about Confu-

" As soon as a child is born he must respect 
its faculties : the knowledge which will come to 
it by and by does not resemble at all its present 
state. If it arrive at the age of forty or fifty 
years without having learned anything, it is no 
more worthy of any respect." This last, I think, 
will speak to your condition. 

But at this rate I might fill many letters. 

Our acquaintance with the ancient Hindoos is 
not at all personal. The full names that can be 
relied upon are very shadowy. It is, however, 
tangible works that we know. The best I think 
of are the Bhagvat Geeta (an episode in an 
ancient heroic poem called the Mahabarat), the 
Vedas, the Vishnu Purana, the Institutes of 
Menu, etc. 

I cannot say that Swedenborg has been di- 
rectly and practically valuable to me, for I have 
not been a reader of him, except to a slight ex- 
tent ; but I have the highest regard for him, and 
trust that I shall read his works in some world 
or other. He had a wonderful knowledge of our 
interior and spiritual life, though his illumina- 
tions are occasionally blurred by trivialities. He 
comes nearer to answering, or attempting to an- 
swer, literally, your <|iirstions concerning man's 
origin, purpose, and destiny, than any of the

worthies I have referred to. But I think that that 
is not altogether a recommendation ; since such 
an answer to these questions cannot be discov- 
ered any more than perpetual motion, for which 
no reward is now offered. The noblest man it 
is, methinks, that knows, and by his life suggests, 
the most about these things. Crack away at 
these nuts, however, as long as you can, the 
very exercise will ennoble you, and you may get 
something better than the answer you expect. 

TO B. B. WILEY (AT CHICAGO). 

CONCORD, April 26, 1857. 

MR. WILEY, I see that you are turning a 
broad furrow among the books, but I trust that 
some very private journal all the while holds its 
own through their midst. Books can only reveal 
us to ourselves, and as often as they do us this 
service we lay them aside. I should say, read 
Goethe's Autobiography, by all means, also Gib- 
bon's, Haydon the Painter's, and our Franklin's 
of course ; perhaps also Alfieri's, Benvenuto 
Cellini's, and De Quincey's " Confessions of an 
Opium-Eater," since you like autobiography. 
I think you must read Coleridge again, and fur- 
ther, skipping all his theology, i. e., if you value 
precise definitions and a discriminating use of 
language. By the way, read De Quincey's Kemi- 
niscences of Coleridge and Wordsworth. 



*r. 38.] TO B. B. WILEY. 353 

How shall we account for our pursuits, if they 
are original ? We get the language with which 
to describe our various lives out of a common 
mint. If others have their losses which they are 
busy repairing, so have I mine, and their hound 
and horse may perhaps be the symbols of some 
of them. 1 But also 1 have lost, 6r am in danger 
of losing, a far finer and more ethereal treasure, 
which commonly no loss, of which they are con- 
scious, will symbolize. This I answer hastily 
and with some hesitation, according as I now 
understand my words. . . . 

Methinks a certain polygamy with its troubles 
is the fate of almost all men. They are married 
to two wives : their genius (a celestial muse), 

1 When in 1855 or 1856 Thoreau started to wade across from 
I >u \ Imry to Clark's Island, and was picked up by a fishing- 
boat in the deep water, and landed on the " backside " of the 
island (see letter to Mr. Watson of April 25, 1858), Edward 
Watson (" Uncle Ed "), was " saggin' round " to see that every- 
thing was right alongshore, and encountered the unexpected 
visitor. " How did you come here ? " " Oh, from Duzbury," 
aid Thoreau, and they walked to the old Watson house to- 
gether. " You say in one of your books," said Uncle Ed, " that 
you once lost a horse and a hound and a dove, now I should 
like to know what you meant by that ? " " Why, everybody 
has met with hnutes, have n't they ? " " H'm, pretty way to 
answer a fellow I " said Mr. Watson ; but it seems this was the 
usual answer. In the long dining-room of the old house that 
night he sat by the window and told the story of the Norse 
voyagers to New England, perhaps to that very island and 
the Gurnet near by, as Morton fancies in his review of 
Thoreau in the Harvard Magazine (January, 1850).

Unless these two were fast friends before mar-

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, December 31, 1856. 

MR. BLAKE, I think it will not be worth 
the while for me to come to Worcester to lecture 
at all this year. It will be better to wait till I 
am perhaps unfortunately more in that line. 
My writing has not taken the shape of lectures, 
and therefore I should be obliged to read one of 
three or four old lectures, the best of which I 
have read to some of your auditors before. I 
carried that one which I call " Walking, or the 
Wild," to Amherst, N. H., the evening of that 
cold Thursday, 1 and I am to read another at 
Fitchburg, February 3. I am simply their hired 
man. This will probably be the extent of my 
lecturing hereabouts. 

I must depend on meeting Mr. Wasson some 
other time. 

Perhaps it always costs me more than it comes 
to to lecture before a promiscuous audience. It 

1 This was -when he spoke in the vestry of the Calvinistic 
church, and said, on his return to Concord, " that he hoped 
he had done something to upheave and demolish the structure 
above," the vestry being beneath the church.

is an irreparable injury clone to my modesty even, 
I become so indurated. 

solitude ! obscurity ! meanness ! I never 
triumph so as when I have the least success in 
my neighbor's eyes. The lecturer gets fifty dol- 
lars a night; but what becomes of his winter? 
What consolation will it be hereafter to have 
fifty thousand dollars for living in the world? 
I should like not to exchange any of my life for 
money. 

These, you may think, are reasons for not lec- 
turing, when you have no great opportunity. It 
is even so, perhaps. I could lecture on dry oak 
leaves ; I could, but who could hear me ? If I 
were to try it on any large audience, I fear it 
would be no gain to them, and a positive loss to 
me. I should have behaved rudely toward my 
rustling friends. 1 

1 Notwithstanding this unwillingness to lecture, Thorean 
did speak at Worcester, February 13, 1857, on "Walking," 
but scrupulously added to his consent (February 0), "I told 
Brown it had not been much altered since I read it in Worces- 
ter ; but now I think of it, much of it must have been new to 
you, because, having since divided it into two, I am able to 
read what before I omitted. Nevertheless, I should like to 
have it understood by those whom it concerns, that I am 
invited to read in public (if it be so) what I have already 
read, in part, to a private audience." This throws some light 
on his method of preparing lectures, which were afterwards

TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFOBD). 

CONCORD, April 1, 1857. 

DEAR EICKETSON, I got your note of wel- 
come night before last. I expect, if the weather 
is favorable, to take the 4.30 train from Boston 
to-morrow, Thursday, P. M., for I hear of no noon 
train, and shall be glad to find your wagon at 
Tarkiln Hill, for I see it will be rather late for 
going across lots. 

I have seen all the spring signs you mention, 
and a few more, even here. Nay, I heard one 
frog peep nearly a week ago, methinks the 
very first one in all this region. I wish that 
there were a few more signs of spring in myself ; 
however, I take it that there are as many within 
us as we think we hear without us. I am decent 
for a steady pace, but not yet for a race. I have 
a little cold at present, and you speak of rheu- 
matism about the head and shoulders. Your 
frost is not quite out. I suppose that the earth 
itself has a little cold and rheumatism about 
these times ; but all these things together pro- 
duce a very fair general result. In a concert, 
you know, we must sing our parts feebly some- 
times, that we may not injure the general effect. 



.39.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 357 

I should n't wonder if my two-year-old invalidity 
bad been a positively charming feature to some 
amateurs favorably located. Why not a blasted 
man as well as a blasted tree, on your lawn? 

If you should happen not to see me by the 
train named, do not go again, but wait at home 
for me, or a note from yours, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCOKD, April 17, 1857. 

MR. BLAKE, I returned from New Bedford 
night before last. I met Alcott there, and learned 
from him that probably you had gone to Con- 
cord. I am very sorry that I missed you. I 
had expected you earlier, and at last thought 
that I should get back before you came ; but I 
ought to have notified you of my absence. How- 
ever, it would have been too late, after I had 
made up my mind to go. I hope you lost no- 
thing by going a little round. 

I took out the celtis seeds at your request, at 
the time we spoke of them, and left them in the 
chamber on some shelf or other. If you have 
found them, very well ; if you have not found 
them, very well ; but tell Hale 1 of it, if you see 

1 Rev. Edward E. Hole, then pastor at Worcester. Othen 
mentioned in the letter are Rev. David A. Waason and Dr. 
Seth Rogers, the latter a physician with whom Mr. Wasson 
was living in Worcester.

him. My mother says that you and Brown and 
Rogers and Wasson (titles left behind) talk of 
coming down on me some day. Do not fail to 
come, one and all, and within a week or two, if 
possible ; else I may be gone again. Give me 
a short notice, and then come and spend a day 
on Concord River, or say that you will come 
if it is fair, unless you are confident of bringing 
fair weather with you. Come and be Concord, 
as I have been Worcestered. 

Perhaps you came nearer to me for not find- 
ing me at home ; for trains of thought the more 
connect when trains of cars do not. If I had 
actually met you, you would have gone again ; 
but now I have not yet dismissed you. I hear 
what you say about personal relations with joy. 
It is as if you had said, " I value the best and 
finest part of you, and not the worst. I can even 
endure your very near and real approach, and 
prefer it to a shake of the hand." This inter- 
course is not subject to time or distance. 

I have a very long new and faithful letter 
from Cholmondeley, which I wish to show you. 
He speaks of sending me more books ! ! 

If I were with you now, I could tell you much 
of Ricketson, and my visit to New Bedford ; but 
I do not know how it will be by and by. I 
should like to have you meet R., who is the 
frankest man I know. Alcott and he get along 



*T.39.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 359 

very well together. Channing has returned to 
Concord with me, probably for a short visit 
only. 

Consider this a business letter, which you 
know counts nothing in the game we play. Re- 
member me particularly to Brown. 

TO HAKRISOJT BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCOBD, June 6, 1857, 3 p. M. 

MR. BLAKE,- I have just got your note, but 
I am sorry to say that this very morning I sent 
a note to Channing, stating that I would go with 
him to Cape Cod next week on an excursion 
which we have been talking of for some time. 
If there were time to communicate with you, I 
should ask you to come to Concord on Monday, 
before I go ; but as it is, I must wait till I come 
back, which I think will be about ten days hence. 
I do not like this delay, but there seems to be a 
fate in it. Perhaps Mr. Wasson will l>e well 
enough to come by that time. I will notify you 
of my return, and shall depend on seeing you 
all. 

June 23d. I returned from Cape Cod last 
evening, and now take the first opportunity to 
invite you men of Worcester to this quiet Med- 
iterranean >li<>iv. Canyon <-'>m.- tlii-\\.-'k >n 
Friday, or m-\t Monday ? I mention the earli- 
est days on which I suppose you can be ready. 



360 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

If more convenient, name some other time within 
ten days. I shall be rejoiced to see you, and to 
act the part of skipper in the contemplated 
voyage. I have just got another letter from 
Cholmondeley, which may interest you some- 
what. 

TO MARSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, August 17, 1857. 

MR. WATSON, I am much indebted to you 
for your glowing communication of July 20th. 
I had that very day left Concord for the wilds 
of Maine ; but when I returned, August 8th, two 
out of the six worms remained nearly, if not 
quite, as bright as at first, I was assured. In 
their best estate they had excited the admira- 
tion of many of the inhabitants of Concord. It 
was a singular coincidence that I should find 
these worms awaiting me, for my mind was full 
of a phosphorescence which I had seen in the 
woods. I have waited to learn something more 
about them before acknowledging the receipt of 
them. I have frequently met with glow-worms 
in my night walks, but am not sure they were 
the same kind with these. Dr. Harris once de- 
scribed to me a larger kind than I had found, 
" nearly as big as your little finger ; " but he 
does not name them in his report. 

The only authorities on Glow-worms which I 



*r.40.] TO MARSTON WATSON. 361 

chance to have (and I am pretty well provided), 
are Kirby and Spence (the fullest), Knapp 
("Journal of a Naturalist"), "The Library of 
Entertaining Knowledge " (7?ennie), a French 
work, etc., etc. ; but there is no minute, scientific 
description in any of these. This is apparently 
a female of the genus Lampyris ; but Kirby 
and Spence say that there are nearly two hun- 
dred species of this genus alone. The one com- 
monly referred to by English writers is the 
Lampyris noctiluca ; but judging from Kirby 
and Spence's description, and from the descrip- 
tion and plate in the French work, this is not 
that one, for, besides other differences, both say 
that the light proceeds from the abdomen. Per- 
haps the worms exhibited by Durkee (whose 
statement to the Boston Society of Natural His- 
tory, second July meeting, in the " Traveller " 
of August 12, 1857, I send you) were the same 
with these. I do not see how they could be the 
L. noctiluca, as he states. 

I expect to go to Cambridge before long, and 
if I get any more light on this subject I will in- 
form you. The two worms are still alive. 

I shall be glad to receive the Drosera at any 
time, if you chance to come across it. I am 
looking over London's " Arboretum," which we 
have added to our Library, and it occurs to 
me that it was written expressly for you, and 



362 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

that you cannot avoid placing it on your own 
shelves. 

I should have been glad to see the whale, and 
might perhaps have done so, if I had not at that 
time been seeing " the elephant " (or moose) in 
the Maine woods. I have been associating for 
about a month with one Joseph Polis, the chief 
man of the Penobscot tribe of Indians, and 
have learned a great deal from him, which I 
should like to tell you sometime. 

TO MARSTON WATSON (AT PLYMOUTH). 

CONCORD, April 25, 1858. 

DEAR SIR, Your unexpected gift of pear- 
trees reached me yesterday in good condition, 
and I spent the afternoon in giving them a good 
setting out; but I fear that this cold weather 
may hurt them. However, I am inclined to 
think they are insured, since you have looked on 
them. It makes one's mouth water to read their 
names only. From what I hear of the extent of 
your bounty, if a reasonable part of the trees 
succeed, this transplanting will make a new era 
for Concord to date from. 

Mine must be a lucky star, for day before 
yesterday I received a box of Mayflowers from 
Brattleboro, and yesterday morning your pear- 
trees, and at evening a humming-bird's nest from 
Worcester. This looks like fairy housekeeping. 



*r.40.] TO MARSTON WATSON. 363 

I discovered two new plants in Concord last 
winter, the Labrador Tea (Ledum latifolium), 
and Yew ( Taxis baccata^). 

By the way, in January I communicated with 
Dr. Ehirkee, whose report on Glow-worms I sent 
you, and it appeared, as I expected, that he 
(and by his account, Agassiz, Goidd, Jackson, 
and others to whom he showed them) did not 
consider them a distinct species, but a variety 
of the common, or Lampyris noctiluca, some of 
which you got in Lincoln. Durkee, at least, has 
never seen the last. I told him that I had no 
doubt about their being a distinct species. His, 
however, were luminous throughout every part 
of the body, as those which you sent me were 
not, while I had them. 

Is nature as full of vigor to your eyes as ever, 
or do you detect some falling off at last ? Is the 
mystery of the hog's bristle cleared up, and with 
it that of our life ? It is the question, to the 
exclusion of every other interest. 

I am sorry to hear of the burning of your 
woods, but, thank Heaven, your great ponds and 
your sea cannot be burnt. I love to think of 
your warm, sandy wood-roads, and your breezy 
i>l:ind out in the sea. What a prospect you can 
get every morning from the hilltop east of your 
house ! ! I think that even the heathen that I

364 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

am could say, or sing, or dance, morning prayers 
there of some kind. 

Please remember me to Mrs. Watson, and to 
the rest of your family who are helping the sun 
shine yonder. 

TO DANIEL BICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, August 18, 1857. 

DEAR SIR, Your Wilson Flagg l seems a 
serious person, and it is encouraging to hear 

nephews, owned the " breezy island " where Thoreau had vis- 
ited his friends (Clark's Island, the only one in Plymouth Bay), 
had built his own house, " Hillside," on the slope of one of the 
hills above Plymouth town, and there laid out a fine park and 
garden, which Thoreau surveyed for him in the autumn of 
1854, Alcott and Mr. Watson carrying the chain. For a de- 
scription of Hillside, see Channing's Wanderer (Boston, 1871) 
and Alcott's Sonnets and Canzonets (Boston : Roberts, 1882). 
It was a villa much visited by Emerson, Alcott, Channing, 
Thoreau, George Bradford, and the Transcendentalists gener- 
ally. Mr. Watson graduated at Harvard two years after Tho- 
reau, and in an old diary says : " I remember Thoreau in the 
college yard (1836) with downcast thoughtful look intent, as 
if he were searching for something ; always in a green coat, 
green because the authorities required black, I suppose." 
In a letter he says : " I have always heard the ' Maiden in the 
East ' was Mrs. Watson, Mary Russell Watson, and I sup- 
pose there is no doubt of it. I may be prejudiced, but I have 
always thought it one of his best things, and I have highly 
valued his lines. I find in my Dial, No. 6, I have written six 
new stanzas in the margin of Friendship, and they are num- 
bered to show how they should run. I think Mrs. Brown gave 
them to me." 

1 A writer on scenery and natural history, who outlived 



*r.40.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 365 

of a contemporary who recognizes Nature so 
squarely, and selects such a theme as " Barns." 
(I would rather " Mount Auburn " were omit- 
ted.) But he is not alert enough. He wants 
stirring up with a pole. He should practice 
turning a series of somersets rapidly, or jump 
up and see how many times he can strike his 
feet together before coming down. Let him 
make the earth turn round now the other way, 
and whet his wits on it, whichever way it goes, 
as on a grindstone; in short, see how many 
ideas he can entertain at once. 

Hi.s style, as I remember, is singularly vague 
(I refer to the book), and, before I got to the 
end of the sentences, I was off the track. If 
you indulge in long periods, you must be sure 
to have a snapper at the end. As for style of 
writing, if one has anything to say, it drops 
from him simply and directly, as a stone falls to 
the ground. There are no two ways about it, 
but down it comes, and he may stick in the 
points and stops wherever he can get a chance. 
New ideas come into this world somewhat like 
fulling meteors, with a flash and an explosion, 
and perhaps somebody's castle-roof ]>erforated. 
To try to polish the stone in its descent, to give 
it a peculiar turn, and make it whistle a tune, 

Thorean, and never forgave him for the remark about " stir- 
ring up with a pole," which really might have been less graphic. 



366 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

perchance, would be of no use, if it were pos- 
sible. Your polished stuff turns out not to be 
meteoric, but of this earth. However, there is 
plenty of time, and Nature is an admirable 
schoolmistress. 

Speaking of correspondence, you ask me if I 
"cannot turn over a new leaf in that line." I 
certainly could if I were to receive it ; but just 
then I looked up and saw that your page was 
dated " May 10," though mailed in August, and 
it occurred to me that I had seen you since that 
date this year. Looking again, it appeared that 
your note was written in '56 ! ! However, it 
was a new leaf to me, and I turned it over with 
as much interest as if it had been written the 
day before. Perhaps you kept it so long in 
order that the manuscript and subject-matter 
might be more in keeping with the old-fashioned 
paper on which it was written. 

I traveled the length of Cape Cod on foot, 
soon after you were here, and, within a few days, 
have returned from the wilds of Maine, where 
I have made a journey of three hundred and 
twenty-five miles with a canoe and an Indian, 
and a single white C9mpanion, Edward Hoar 
Esq., of this town, lately from California, 
traversing the headwaters of the Kennebec, Pe- 
nobscot, and St. John's. 

Can't you extract any advantage out of that 



JET. 40.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 367 

depression of spirits you refer to ? It suggests 
to me cider-mills, wine-presses, etc., etc. All 
kinds of pressure or power should be used and 
made to turn some kind of machinery. 

Channing was just leaving Concord for Plym- 
outh when I arrived, but said he should be here 
again in two or three days. 

Please remember me to your family, and say 
that I have at length learned to sing Tom Bow- 
lin according to the notes. 

TO DANIEL RICKETSOX (AT NEW BEDFORD). 
CONCORD, September 9, 1857. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I thank you for your 
kind invitation to visit you, but I have taken so 
many vacations this year, at New Bedford, 
Cape Cod, and Maine, that any more relaxa- 
tion call it rather dissipation will cover me 
with shame and disgrace. I have not earned 
what I have already enjoyed. As some heads 
cannot carry much wine, so it would seem that 
I cannot bear so much society as you can. I 
have an immense appetite for solitude, like an 
infant for sleep, and if I don't get enough of 
it this year, I shall cry all the next. 

My mother's house is full at present ; but if it 
were not, I would have no right to invite you 
hither, while entertaining such designs as I have 
hinted at However, if you care to storm the 



368 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

town, I will engage to take some afternoon 
walks with you, retiring into prof oundest soli- 
tude the most sacred part of the day. 

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, August 18, 1857. 

MR. BLAKE, Fif teenthly. It seems to me 
that you need some absorbing pursuit. It does 
not matter much what it is, so it be honest. 
Such employment will be favorable to your de- 
velopment in more characteristic and important 
directions. You know there must be impulse 
enough for steerage way, though it be not to- 
ward your port, to prevent your drifting help- 
lessly on to rocks or shoals. Some sails are 
set for this purpose only. There is the large 
fleet of scholars and men of science, for instance, 
always to be seen standing off and on every 
coast, and saved thus from running on to reefs, 
who will at last run into their proper haven, we 
trust. 

It is a pity you were not here with Brown and 
Wiley. I think that in this case, for a rarity, 
the more the merrier. 

You perceived that I did not entertain the 
idea of our going together to Maine on such an 
excursion as I had planned. The more I thought 
of it, the more imprudent it appeared to me. 
I did think to have written to you before 



XT. 40.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 369 

going, though not to propose your going also ; 
but I went at last very suddenly, and could only 
have written a business letter, if I had tried, 
when there was no business to be accomplished. 
I have now returned, and think I have had a 
quite profitable journey, chiefly from associating 
with an intelligent Indian. My companion, 
Edward Hoar, also found his account in it, 
though he suffered considerably from being 
obliged to carry unusual loads over wet and 
rough " carries," in one instance five miles 
through a swamp, where the water was fre- 
quently up to our knees, and the fallen timber 
higher than our heads. He went over the 
ground three times, not being able to carry all 
his load at once. This prevented his ascending 
Ktaadn. Our best nights were those when it 
rained the hardest, on account of the mosquitoes. 
I speak of these things, which were not unex- 
pected, merely to account for my not inviting 
you. 

Having returned, I flatter myself that the 
world appears in some respects a little larger, 
and not, as usual, smaller and shallower, for 
having extended my range. I have made a 
short excursion into the new world which the In- 
dian dwells in, or is. He begins where we leave 
off. It is worth the while to detect new facul- 
ties in man, he is so much the more divine ; 



370 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

and anything that fairly excites our admiration 
expands us. The Indian, who can find his way 
so wonderfully in the woods, possesses so much 
intelligence which the white man does not, 
and it increases my own capacity, as well as 
faith, to observe it. I rejoice to find that intel- 
ligence flows in other channels than I knew. It 
redeems for me portions of what seemed bru- 
tish before. 

It is a great satisfaction to find that your 
oldest convictions are permanent. With re- 
gard to essentials, I have never had occasion 
to change my mind. The aspect of the world 
varies from year to year, as the landscape is 
differently clothed, but I find that the truth is 
still true, and I never regret any emphasis which 
it may have inspired. Ktaadn is there still, but 
much more surely my old conviction is there, 
resting with more than mountain breadth and 
weight on the world, the source still of fertiliz- 
ing streams, and affording glorious views from 
its summit, if I can get up to it again. As the 
mountains still stand on the plain, and far 
more unchangeable and permanent, -- stand 
still grouped around, farther or nearer to my 
maturer eye, the ideas which I have entertained, 
the everlasting teats from which we draw our 
nourishment. 



ft. 40.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 371 

TO HARBISOX BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, November 16, 1857. 

MR. BLAKE, You have got the start again. 
It was I that owed you a letter or two, if I mis- 
take not. 

They make a great ado nowadays about hard 
times ; 1 but I think that the community gener- 
ally, ministers and all, take a wrong view of the 
matter, though some of the ministers preaching 
according to a formula may pretend to take a 
right one. This general failure, both private 
and public, is rather occasion for rejoicing, as 
reminding us whom we have at the helm, that 
justice is always done. If our merchants did not 
most of them fail, and the banks too, my faith in 
the old laws of the world would be staggered. 
The statement that ninety-six in a hundred doing 
such business surely break down is perhaps the 
sweetest fact that statistics have revealed, ex- 
hilarating as the fragrance of sallows in spring. 
Does it not say somewhere, " The Lord reigneth, 
let the earth rejoice " ? If thousands are thrown 
out of employment, it suggests that they were 
not well employed. Why don't they take the 
hint ? It is not enough to be industrious ; so are 
the ants. What are you industrious about ? 

The merchants and company have long laughed 

1 The panic of 1S.V7, the worrt nnoe 1887. 



372 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

at transcendentalism, higher laws, etc., crying, 
" None of your moonshine," as if they were an- 
chored to something not only definite, but sure 
and permanent. If there was any institution 
which was presumed to rest on a solid and secure 
basis, and more than any other represented this 
boasted common sense, prudence, and practical 
talent, it was the bank ; and now those very banks 
are found to be mere reeds shaken by the wind. 
Scarcely one in the land has kept its promise. 
It would seem as if you only need live forty years 
in any age of this world, to see its most promis- 
ing government become the government of Kan- 
sas, and banks nowhere. Not merely the Brook 
Farm and Fourierite communities, but now the 
community generally has failed. But there is 
the moonshine still, serene, beneficent, and un- 
changed. Hard times, I say, have this value, 
among others, that they show us what such prom- 
ises are worth, where the sure banks are. I 
heard some merchant praised the other day be- 
cause he had paid some of his debts, though it 
took nearly all he had (why, I 've done as much 
as that myself many times, and a little more), 
and then gone to board. What if he has? I 
hope he 's got a good boarding-place, and can 
pay for it. It 's not everybody that can. How- 
ever, in my opinion, it is cheaper to keep house, 
i. e., if you don't keep too big a one. 



*r.40.J TO HARRISON BLAKE. 373 

Men will tell you sometimes that " money 's 
hard." That shows it was not made to eat, I 
say. Only think of a man in this new world, in 
his log cabin, in the midst of a corn and potato 
patch, with a sheepfold on one side, talking about 
money being hard ! So are flints hard ; there is 
no alloy in them. What has that to do with his 
raising his food, cutting his wood (or breaking 
it), keeping in-doors when it rains, and, if need 
be, spinning and weaving his clothes ? Some of 
those who sank with the steamer the other day 
found out that money was heavy too. Think of 
a man's priding himself on this kind of wealth, 
as if it greatly enriched him. As if one strug- 
gling in mid-ocean with a bag of gold on his 
back should gasp out, " I am worth a hundred 
thousand dollars." I see them struggling just 
as ineffectually on dry land, nay, even more 
hopelessly, for, in the former case, rather than 
sink, they will finally let the bag go ; but in the 
latter they are pretty sure to hold and go down 
with it. I see them swimming about in their 
great-coats, collecting their rents, really gett'uxj 
f/n ir i />iis. drinking bitter draughts which only 
increase their thirst, becoming more and more 
water-logged, till finally they sink plumb down 
to the bottom. But enough of this. 

Have you ever read Kuskin's books? If not, 
I would recommend you to try the second and 



374 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1857, 

third volumes (not parts) of his " Modern Paint- 
ers." I am now reading the fourth, and have 
read most of his other books lately. They are 
singularly good and encouraging, though not 
without crudeness and bigotry. The themes in 
the volumes referred to are Infinity, Beauty, 
Imagination, Love of Nature, etc., all treated 
in a very living manner. I am rather surprised 
by them. It is remarkable that these things 
should be said with reference to painting chiefly, 
rather than literature. The " Seven Lamps of 
Architecture," too, is made of good stuff; but, 
as I remember, there is too much about art in it 
for me and the Hottentots. We want to know 
about matters and things in general. Our house 
is as yet a hut. 

You must have been enriched by your solitary 
walk over the mountains. I suppose that I feel 
the same awe when on their summits that many 
do on entering a church. To see what kind of 
earth that is on which you have a house and gar- 
den somewhere, perchance ! It is equal to the 
lapse of many years. You must ascend a moun- 
tain to learn your relation to matter, and so to 
your own body, for it is at home there, though 
you are not. It might have been composed 
there, and will have no farther to go to return 
to dust there, than in your garden; but your 
spirit inevitably comes away, and brings your 



*r.40.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 375 

body with it, if it lives. Just as awful really, 
and as glorious, is your garden. See how I can 
play with my fingers! They are the funniest 
companions I have ever found. Where did they 
come from ? What strange control I have over 
them ! Who am I ? What are they ? those 
little peaks call them Madison, Jefferson, La- 
fayette. What is the matter ? My fingers ten, 
I say. Why, erelong, they may form the top- 
most crystal of Mount Washington. I go up 
there to see my body's cousins. There are some 
fingers, toes, bowels, etc., that I take an interest 
in, and therefore I am interested in all their 
relations. 

Let me suggest a theme for you : to state to 
yourself precisely and completely what that walk 
over the mountains amounted to for you, re- 
turning to this essay again and again, until you 
are satisfied that all that was important in your 
experience is in it. Give this good reason to 
yourself for having gone over the mountains, for 
mankind is ever going over a mountain. Don't 
suppose that you can tell it precisely the first 
dozen times you try, but at 'em again, especially 
when, after a sufficient pause, you suspect that 
you are touching the heart or summit of the mat- 
ter, reiterate your blows there, and account for 
the mountain to yourself. Not that the story 
need be long, but it will take a long while to

make it short. It did not take very long to get 
over the mountain, you thought ; but have you 
got over it indeed ? If you have been to the top 
of Mount Washington, let me ask, what did you 
find there? That is the way they prove wit- 
nesses, you know. Going up there and being 
blown on is nothing. We never do much climb- 
ing while we are there, but we eat our luncheon, 
etc., very much as at home. It is after we get 
home that we really go over the mountain, if ever. 
What did the mountain say? What did the 
mountain do ? 

I keep a mountain anchored off eastward a lit- 
tle way, which I ascend in my dreams both awake 
and asleep. Its broad base spreads over a vil- 
lage or two, which do not know it ; neither does 
it know them, nor do I when I ascend it. I can 
see its general outline as plainly now in my mind 
as that of Wachusett. I do not invent in the 
least, but state exactly what I see. I find that 
I go up it when I am light-footed and earnest. 
It ever smokes like an altar with its sacrifice. I 
am not aware that a single villager frequents it 
or knows of it. I keep this mountain to ride 
instead of a horse. 

Do you not mistake about seeing Moosehead 
Lake from Mount Washington ? That must be 
about one hundred and twenty miles distant, or 
nearly twice as far as the Atlantic, which last

Umbagog ? 

Dr. Solger l has been lecturing in the vestry 
in this town on Geography, to Sanborn's schol- 
ars, for several months past, at five P. M. Emer- 
son and Alcott have been to hear him. I was 
surprised when the former asked me, the other 
day, if I was not going to hear Dr. Solger. What, 
to be sitting in a meeting-house cellar at that time 
of day, when you might possibly be out-doors ! 
I never thought of such a thing. What was 
the sun made for? If he does not prize day- 
light, I do. Let him lecture to owls and dor- 
mice. He must be a wonderful lecturer indeed 
who can keep me indoors at such an hour, 
when the night is coming in which no man can 
walk. \ 

Are you in want of amusement nowadays? 
Then play a little at the game of getting a living. 
There never was anything equal to it. Do it 
temperately, though, and don't sweat. Don't let 
this secret out, for I have a design against tjir

Now is the time to become conversant with 
your wood-pile (this comes under Work for the 
Month), and be sure you put some warmth into 
it by your mode of getting it. Do not consent 
to be passively warmed. An intense degree of 
that is the hotness that is threatened. But a 
positive warmth within can withstand the fiery 
furnace, as the vital heat of a living man can 
withstand the heat that cooks meat. 

After returning from the last of his three ex- 
peditions to the Maine woods (in 1846, 1853, 
and 1857), Thoreau was appealed to by his 
friend Higginson, then living in Worcester, for 
information concerning a proposed excursion 
from Worcester into Maine and Canada, then 
but little visited by tourists, who now go there 
in droves. He replied in this long letter, with 
its minute instructions and historical references. 
TJie Arnold mentioned is General Benedict Ar- 
nold, who in 1775-76 made a toilsome march 
through the Maine forest with a small New Eng- 
land army for the conquest of Canada, while 
young John Thoreau, Henry's grandfather, was 
establishing himself as a merchant in Boston 
(not yet evacuated by British troops), previous 
to his marriage with Jane Burns.

TO T. W. HIGGINSOX (AT WOBCESTEB). 

CONCORD, January 28, 185& 

DEAB SIR, It would be perfectly practica- 
ble to go to the Madawaska the way you pro- 
pose. As for the route to Quebec, I do not find 
the Sugar Loaf Mountains on my maps. The 
most direct and regular way, as you know, is 
substantially Montresor's and Arnold's and the 
younger John Smith's by the Chaudiere ; but 
this is less wild. If your object is to see the St. 
Lawrence Hiver below Quebec, you will proba- 
bly strike it at the Riviere du Loup. ( Vide 
Hodge's account of his excursion thither ria the 
Allegash, I believe it is in the second Report 
on the Geology of the Public Lands of Maine 
and Massachusetts in '37.) I think that our 
Indian last summer, when we talked of going to 
the St. Lawrence, named another route, near the 
Madawaska, perhaps the St. Francis, which 
would save the long portage which Hodge made. 

I do not know whether you think of ascend- 
ing the St. Lawrence in a canoe ; but if you 
should, you might be delayed not only by the 
current, but by the waves, which frequently run 
too high for a canoe on such a mighty stream. 
It would be a grand excursion to go to Quebec 
by the Chaudiere, descend the St. Lawrence to 
the Riviere du Loup, and return by the Mada-

waska and St. John's to Frederickton, or far. 
ther, almost all the way down stream a very 
important consideration. 

I went to Moosehead in company with a party 
of four who were going a-hunting down the Alle- 
gash and St. John's, and thence by some other 
stream over into the Restigouche, and down that 
to the Bay of Chaleur, to be gone six weeks. 
Our northern terminus was an island in Heron 
Lake on the Allegash. ( Vide Colton's railroad 
and township map of Maine.) 

The Indian proposed that we should return to 
Bangor by the St. John's and Great Schoodic 
Lake, which we had thought of ourselves ; and 
he showed us on the map where we should be 
each night. It was then noon, and the next day 
night, continuing down the Allegash, we should 
have been at the Mada waska settlements, having 
made only one or two portages ; and thereafter, 
on the St. John's there would be but one or two 
more falls, with short carries ; and if there was 
not too much wind, we could go down that 
stream one hundred miles a day. It is settled 
all the way below Madawaska. He knew the 
route well. He even said that this was easier, 
and would take but little more time, though 
much farther, than the route we decided on, 
i. e., by Webster Stream, the East Branch, and 
main Penobscot to Oldtown ; but he may have 



*r.40.] TO T. W. HIGGINSON. 381 

wanted a longer job. We preferred the latter, 
not only because it was shorter, but because, as 
he said, it was wilder. 

We went about three hundred and twenty-five 
miles with the canoe (including sixty miles of 
stage between Bangor and Oldtown) ; were out 
twelve nights, and spent about $40 apiece, 
which was more than was necessary. We paid 
the Indian, who was a very good one, $1.50 per 
day and 50 cents a week for his canoe. This is 
enough in ordinary seasons. I had formerly 
paid $2 for an Indian and for white batteau- 
men. 

If you go to Madawaska in a leisurely man- 
ner, supposing no delay on account of rain or 
the violence of the wind, you may reach Mt. 
Kineo by noon, and have the afternoon to ex- 
plore it. The next day you may get to the head 
of the lake before noon, make the portage of 
two and a half miles over a wooden railroad, and 
drop down the Penobscot half a dozen miles. 
The third morning you will perhaps walk half a 
mile :il >< mi Pine Stream Falls, while the Indian 
runs down, cross the head of Chesuncook, 
reach the junction of the Caucomgomock and 
Umbazookskus by noon, and ascend the latter 
to Umbazookskus Lake that night. If it is low 
water, you may have to walk and carry a little 
on the Umbazookskus before entering the lake. 



382 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

The fourth morning you will make the carry of 
two miles to Mud Pond (Allegash Water), and 
a very wet carry it is, and reach Chamberlain 
Lake by noon, and Heron Lake, perhaps, that 
night, after a couple of very short carries at the 
outlet of Chamberlain. At the end of two days 
more you will probably be at Madawaska. Of 
course the Indian can paddle twice as far in a 
day as he commonly does. 

Perhaps you would like a few more details. 
We used (three of us) exactly twenty-six pounds 
of hard bread, fourteen pounds of pork, three 
pounds of coffee, twelve pounds of sugar (and 
could have used more), besides a little tea, In- 
dian meal, and rice, and plenty of berries and 
moose-meat. This was faring very luxuriously. 
I had not formerly carried coffee, sugar, or rice. 
But for solid food, I decide that it is not worth 
the while to carry anything but hard bread and 
pork, whatever your tastes and habits may be. 
These wear best, and you have no time nor 
dishes in which to cook anything else. Of 
course you will take a little Indian meal to fry 
fish in ; and half a dozen lemons also, if you 
have sugar, will be very refreshing, for the 
water is warm. 1 

1 Channing says (Thoreau, p. 35): "Thoreau made for 
himself a knapsack, with partitions for books and papers, 
India-rubber cloth, strong and large-spaced, the common 



xt. 40.] TO T. W. HIGGINSON. 383 

To save time, the sugar, coffee, tea, salt, etc., 
should be in separate watertight bags, labeled, 
and tied with a leathern string ; and all the pro- 
visions and blankets should be put into two 
large India-rubber bags, if you can find them 
watertight. Ours were not. A four-quart tin 
pail makes a good kettle for all purposes, and 
tin plates are portable and convenient. Don't 
forget an India-rubber knapsack, with a large 
flap, plenty of dish-cloths, old newspapers, 
strings, and twenty-five feet of strong cord. Of 
India-rubber clothing, the most you can wear, if 
any, is a very light coat, and that you cannot 
work in. I could be more particular, but per- 
haps have been too much so already. 

Of his habits in mountain-climbing, Channing 
says : l " He ascended such hills as Monadnoc 
by his own path ; would lay down his map on 
the summit and draw a line to the point he pro- 
posed to visit below, perhaps forty miles away 
on the landscape, and set off bravely to make the 
* short-cut.' The lowland people wondered to 

knapsack* being niupaced. After trying the merit of cocoa, 
coffee, water, and the like, tea was put down aa the felicity of 
a walking travail, tea plenty, strong, with enough sugar, 
made in a tin pint nip. lit- commended every party to carry 
' a junk of heavy cake ' with plums in it, having found by 
long experience that after toil it was a capital refreshment."

see him sealing the heights as if he had lost his 
.way, or at his jumping over their cow-yard 
fences, asking if he had fallen from the clouds. 
In a walk like this he always carried his um- 
brella ; and on this Mouadnoc trip, when about 
a mile from the station (in Troy, N. H.), a tor- 
rent of rain came down ; without the umbrella 
his books, blankets, maps, and provisions would 
all have been spoiled, or the morning lost by de- 
lay. On the mountain there being a thick, soak- 
ing fog, the first object was to camp and make 
tea. He spent five nights in camp, having built 
another hut, to get varied views. Flowers, birds, 
lichens, and the rocks were carefully examined, 
all parts, of the mountain were visited, and as 
accurate a map as could be made by pocket com- 
pass was carefully sketched and drawn out, in 
the five days spent there, with notes of the 
striking aerial phenomena, incidents of travel 
and natural history. The outlook across the val- 
ley over to Wachusett, with its thunder-storms 
and battles in the cloud; the farmers' back- 
yards in Jaffrey, where the family cotton can be 
seen bleaching on the grass, but no trace of the 
pigmy family; the dry, soft air all night, the 
lack of dew in the morning ; the want of water, 
a pint being a good deal, these, and similar 
things make up some part of such an excur- 
sion." 



. 40.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 385 

The Monadnoc excursion above mentioned 
began June 3d, and continued three days. It 
inspired Thoreau to take a longer mountain 
tour with his neighbor and friend, Edward 
Hoar, to which these letters relate, giving the 
ways and means of the journey, a memorable 
one to all concerned. 

TO HARBISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, Jane 29, 1858, 8 A. M. 

MR. BLAKE, Edward Hoar and I propose 
to start for the White Mountains in a covered 
wagon, with one horse, on the morning of Thurs- 
day the 1st of July, intending to explore the 
mountain tops botanically, and camp on them 
at least several times. Will you take a seat in 
the wagon with us ? Mr. Hoar prefers to hire 
the horse and wagon himself. Let us hear by 
express, as soon as you can, whether you will 
join us here by the earliest train Thursday 
morning, or Wednesday night. Bring your map 
of the mountains, and as much provision for the 
road as you can, hard bread, sugar, tea, meat, 
etc., for we intend to live like gipsies ; also, 
a blanket and some thick clothes for the moun- 
tain top. 

July 1st. Last Monday evening Mr. Edward 
Hoar said that he thought of going to the White 



386 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

Mountains. I remarked casually that I should 
like to go well enough if I could afford it. 
Whereupon he declared that if I would go with 
him, he would hire a horse and wagon, so that 
the ride would cost me nothing, and we would 
explore the mountain tops botanically, camping 
on them many nights. The next morning I 
suggested you and Brown's accompanying us 
in another wagon, and we could all camp and 
cook, gipsy-like, along the way, or, perhaps, 
if the horse could draw us, you would like to 
bear half the expense of the horse and wagon, 
and take a seat with us. He liked either propo- 
sition, but said, that if you would take a seat 
with us, he would prefer to hire the horse and 
wagon himself. You could contribute something 
else if you pleased. Supposing that Brown 
would be confined, I wrote to you accordingly, 
by express on Tuesday morning, via Boston, 
stating that we should start to-day, suggesting 
provision, thick clothes, etc., and asking for an 
answer ; but I have not received one. I have 
just heard that you may be at Sterling, and now 
write to say that we shall still be glad if you 
will join us at Senter Harbor, where we expect 
to be next Monday morning. In any case, will 
you please direct a letter to us there at once ?

TO DAXIEL BICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, June 30, 1858. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I am on the point of 
starting for the White Mountains in a wagon 
with my neighbor Edward Hoar, and I write to 
you now rather to apologize for not writing, than 
to answer worthily your three notes. I thank 
you heartily for them. You will not care for a 
little delay in acknowledging them, since your 
date shows that you can afford to wait. Indeed, 
my head has been so full of company, etc., that 
I could not reply to you fitly before, nor can I 
now. 

As for preaching to men these days in the 
Walden strain, is it of any consequence to 
preach to an audience of men who can fail, or 
who can be revived ? There are few beside. Is 
it any success to interest these parties ? If a 
111:111 h:i* tpecutetod said failed, he will probably 
do these things again, in sj)it< of you or me. I 
confess that it is rare that I rise to sentiment in 
my relations to men, ordinarily to a mere pa- 
tient, or may be wholesome, good-will. I can 
imagine something more, but the truth compels 
me to regard the ideal and the actual as two 
things.

lished (?) or printed by Munroe, which I have 
hardly had time to glance at. As you may 
guess, I learn nothing of you from him. 

You already foresee my answer to your invita- 
tion to make you a summer visit : I am bound 
for the mountains. But I trust that you have 
vanquished, ere this, those dusky demons that 
seem to lurk around the Head of the River. 1 
You know that this warfare is nothing but a 
kind of nightmare, and it is our thoughts alone 
which give those wwworthies any body or exist- 
ence. 

I made an excursion with Blake, of Worces- 
ter, to Monadnoc, a few weeks since. We took 
our blankets and food, spent two nights on the 
mountain, and did not go into a house. 

Alcott has been very busy for a long time re- 
pairing an old shell of a house, and I have seen 
very little of him. 2 I have looked more at the 
houses which birds build. Watson made us all 
very generous presents from his nursery in the 
spring. Especially did he remember Alcott. 

Excuse me for not writing any more at pres- 
ent, and remember me to your family. 

1 Near which, at New Bedford, Mr. Ricketson lived. 

2 This was the "Orchard House," near Hawthorne's "Way- 
side." The estate on which it stands, now owned by Dr. W. 
T. Harris, was surveyed for Mr. Alcott by Thoreau in October, 
1857. 



JET. 41.] WHITE MOUNTAIN TRIP. 389 

In July, 1858, as mentioned in this letter to 
Mr. Ricketson, Thoreau journeyed from Con- 
cord to the White Mountains, first visited with 
his brother John in 1839. His later companion 
was Edward Hoar, a botanist and lover of na- 
ture, who had been a magistrate in California, 
and in boyhood a comrade of Thoreau in shoot- 
ing excursions on the Concord meadows. They 
journeyed in a wagon and Thoreau disliked the 
loss of independence in choice of camping-places 
involved in the care of a horse. He complained 
also of the magnificent inns (" mountain houses ") 
that had sprung up in the passes and on the 
plateaus since his first visit. " Give me," he 
said, "a spruce house made in the rain," such 
as he and Channing afterward (1860) made on 
Monadnoc in his last trip to that mountain. 
The chief exploit in the White Mountain trip 
was a visit to Tuckerman's Ravine on Mt. Wash- 
ington, of which Mr. Hoar, some years before 
his death (in 1893), gave me an account, con- 
taining the true anecdote of Thoreau's finding 
the arnica plant when he needed it. 

On their way to this rather inaccessible chasm, 
Thoreau and his comrade went first to what 
was then but a small tavern on the " tip-top " 
of Mt. Washington. It was a foggy day ; and 
when the landlord was asked if he could fumi-h 
a guide to Tuckerman's Ravine, he replied : 



390 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

" Yes, my brother is the guide ; but if he went 
to-day he could never find his way back in this 
fog." " Well," said Thoreau, " if we cannot 
have a guide we will find it ourselves ; " and he 
at once produced a map he had made the day 
before at a roadside inn, where he had found a 
wall map of the mountain region, and climbed 
on a table to copy that portion he needed. With 
this map and his pocket-compass he " struck a 
bee-line," said Mr. Hoar, for the ravine, and soon 
came to it, about a mile away. They went safely 
down the steep stairs into the chasm, where 
they found the midsummer iceberg they wished 
to see. But as they walked down the bed of the 
Peabody River, flowing from this ravine, over 
bowlders five or six feet high, the heavy packs on 
their shoulders weighed them down, and finally, 
Thoreau's foot slipping, he fell and sprained his 
ankle. He rose, but had not limped five steps 
from the place where he fell, when he said, " Here 
is the arnica, anyhow," reached out his hand 
and plucked the Arnica mollis, which he had 
not before found anywhere. Before reaching 
the mountains they had marked in their botany 
books forty-six species of plants they hoped to 
find there, and before they came away they had 
found forty-two of them. 

When they reached their camping-place, far- 
ther down, Thoreau was so lame he could not 



JET. 41.] WHITE MOUNTAIN TRIP. 391 

move about, and lay there in the camp several 
lays, eating the pork and other supplies they 
had in their packs, Mr. Hoar going each day to 
the inn at the mountain summit. This camp was 
in a thicket of dwarf firs at the foot of the ra- 
vine, where, just before his accident, by careless- 
ness in lighting a fire, some acres of the moun- 
tain woodland had been set on fire ; but this 
proved to be the signal for which Thoreau had 
told his Worcester friends to watch, if they 
wished to join him on the mountain. " I had 
told Blake," says Thoreau in his journal, "to 
look out for a smoke and a white tent. We had 
made a smoke sure enough. We slept five in 
the tent that night, and found it quite warm." 
Mr. Hoar added : " In this journey Thoreau 
insisted on our carrying heavy packs, and rather 
despised persons who complained of the burden. 
He was chagrined, in the Maine woods, to find 
his Indian, Joe Polis (whom, on the whole, he 
admired), excited and tremulous at sight of a 
moose, BO that he could scarcely load hid gun 
properly. Joe, who was a good Catholic, wanted 
us to stop traveling on Sunday and hold a 
meeting ; and when we insisted on going for- 
ward, the Indian withdrew into the woods to 
say his prayers, then came back and picked 
up the breakfast things, and we paddled on. 
As to Thoreau's courage and manliness, nobody 



392 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

who had seen him among the Penobscot rocks 
and rapids the Indian trusting his life and 
his canoe to Henry's skill, promptitude, and 
nerve would ever doubt it." 

Channing says : l "In his later journeys, if 
his companion was footsore or loitered, he stead- 
ily pursued his road. Once, when a follower was 
done up with headache and incapable of motion, 
hoping his associate would comfort him and per- 
haps afford him a sip of tea, he said, ' There are 
people who are sick in that way every morning, 
and go about their affairs,' and then marched off 
about his. In such limits, so inevitable, was he 
compacted. . . . This tone of mind grew out of no 
insensibility ; or, if he sometimes looked coldly 
on the suffering of more tender natures, he 
sympathized with their afflictions, but could do 
nothing to admire them. He would not injure 
a plant unnecessarily. At the time of the John 
Brown tragedy, Thoreau was driven sick. So 

1 Channing's Thoreau, pp. 3, 8, 9. Channing himself was, 
no doubt, the " follower " and "companion " here mentioned ; 
no person so frequently walked with Thoreau in his long ex- 
cursions. They were together in New Boston, N. H., when 
the minister mentioned in the Week reproved Thoreau for not 
going to meeting on Sunday. When I first lived in Concord 
(March, 1855), and asked the innkeeper what Sunday services 
the village held, he replied: " There's the Orthodox, an' the 
Unitarian, an' th' Walden Pond Association," meaning by 
the last what Emerson called " the Walkers," those who 
rambled in the Walden woods on Sundays.

the country's misfortunes in the Union war acted 
on his feelings with great force : he used to say 
he 'could never recover while the war lasted/ " 
Hawthorne had an experience somewhat similar, 
though he, too, was of stern stuff when need was, 
and had much of the old Salem sea-captains in 
his sensitive nature. 

TO DAXIEL RICKETSOK (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, November 6, 1858. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I was much pleased 
with your lively and lifelike account of your 
voyage. You were more than repaid for your 
trouble after all. The coast of Nova Scotia, 
which you sailed along from Windsor westward, 
is particularly interesting to the historian of this 
country, having been settled earlier than Plym- 
outh. Your " Isle of Haut " is properly " Isle 
1 1 ante," or the High Island of Champlain's map. 
There is another off the coast of Maine. By the 
way, the American elk, of American authors 
( Cervus Canadensis)^ is a distinct animal from 
the moose ( Cervus o/cea), though the latter is 
called elk by many. 

You drew a very vivid portrait of the Austra- 
lian, short and stout, with a pipe in his mouth, 
and his book inspired by beer, Pot First, Pot 
Second, etc. I suspect that he must be pot- 
bellied withal. Methinks I see the smoke going 



394 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

up from him as from a cottage on the moor. If 
he does not quench his genius with his beer, it 
may burst into a clear flame at last. However, 
perhaps he intentionally adopts the low style. 

What do you mean by that ado about smoking, 
and my "purer tastes " ? I should like his pipe 
as well as his beer, at least. Neither of them is 
so bad as to be " highly connected," which you 
say he is, unfortunately. No! I expect no- 
thing but pleasure in " smoke from your pipe." 

You and the Australian must have put your 
heads together when you concocted those titles, 
with pipes in your mouths over a pot of beer. 
I suppose that your chapters are, Whiff the 
First, Whiff the Second, etc. But of course it 
is a more modest expression for " Fire from my 
Genius." 

You must have been very busy since you came 
back, or before you sailed, to have brought out 
your History, of whose publication I had not 
heard. I suppose that I have read it in the 
"Mercury." Yet I am curious to see how it 
looks in a volume, with your name on the title- 
page. 

I am more curious still about the poems. 
Pray put some sketches into the book : your 
shanty for frontispiece ; Arthur and Walton's 
boat (if you can) running for Cuttyhunk in a 
tremendous gale ; not forgetting " Be honest 



KT.41.] TO DANIEL RICKETS ON. 395 

boys," etc., near by ; the Middleborough Ponds, 
with a certain island looming in the distance ; 
the Quaker meeting-house, and the Brady House, 
if you like ; the villagers catching smelts with 
dip-nets in the twilight, at the Head of the 
River, etc., etc. Let it be a local and villageous 
book as much as possible. Let some one make 
a characteristic selection of mottoes from your 
shanty walls, and sprinkle them in an irregular 
manner, at all angles, over the fly-leaves and

plenty of devices for tail-pieces. Indeed, I should

horse, with his age printed in the hollow of his 
back ; half a cocoanut shell by a spring ; a

Don't wait for the Indian Summer, but bring 
it with you. 

P. S. Let me ask a favor. I am trying to 
write something alxmt the autumnal tints, and 
I wish to know how much our trees differ from 
English and European ones in this respect.

or European trees, if any, still retain their leaves

any (and what) European or foreign trees there 
have been brilliant the past month. If you will 
do this you will greatly oblige me. I return the

TO DANIEL KICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFOBD). 

CONCORD, November 28, 1858. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I thank you for your 
" History." 1 Though I have not yet read it 
again, I have looked far enough to see that I 
like the homeliness of it ; that is, the good, old- 
fashioned way of writing, as if you actually lived 
where you wrote. A man's interest in a single 
bluebird is worth more than a complete but dry 
list of the fauna and flora of a town. It is also 
a considerable advantage to be able to say at 
any time, " If R. is not here, here is his book." 
Alcott being here, and inquiring after you 
(whom he has been expecting), I lent the book 
to him almost immediately. He talks of going 
West the latter part of this week. Channing is 
here again, as I am told, but I have not seen 
him. 

I thank you also for the account of the trees. 

1 Of New Bedford, first published in the Mercury of that 
city, while Channing was one of the editors, and afterwards in 
a volume. 



MI. 41.} TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 397 

It was to my purpose, and I hope you got some- 
thing out of it too. I suppose that the cold 
weather prevented your coming here. Suppose 
you try a winter walk on skates. Please re- 
member me to your family. 

Late in November, 1858, Cholmondeley, who 
had not written for a year and six months, sud- 
denly notified Thoreau from Montreal that he 
was in Canada, and would visit Concord the 
next week. Accordingly he arrived early in 
December, and urged his friend to go with him 
to the West Indies. John Thoreau, the father, 
was then in his last illness, and for that and 
other reasons Thoreau could not accept the in- 
vitation ; but he detained Cholmondeley in Con- 
cord some days, and took him to New Bedford, 
December 8th, having first written this note to 
Mr. Ricketson : 

44 Thomas Cholmondeley, my English ac- 
quaintance, is here, on his way to the West 
Indies. lit- wants to see New Bedford, a whal- 
ing town. I tell him I would like to introduce 
him to you there, thinking more of his seeing 
you than New Bedford. So we propose to come 
your way to-morrow. Excuse this short notice, 
for the time is short. If on any account it is 
inconvenient to see us, you will treat us accord- 
ingly." 



398 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1858, 

Of this visit and his English visitor, Mr. 
Ricketson wrote in his journal the next day : 

" We were all much pleased with Mr. 
Cholmondeley. He is a tall spare man, thirty- 
five years of age, of fair and fresh complexion, 
blue eyes, light brown and fine hair, nose small 
and Roman, beard light and worn full, with a 
mustache. A man of fine culture and refinement 
of manners, educated at Oriel College, Oxford, 
of an old Cheshire family by his father, a clergy- 
man. He wore a black velvet sack coat, and 
lighter colored trousers, a sort of genteel 
traveling suit ; perhaps a cap, but by no means 
a fashionable ' castor.' He reminded me of 
our dear friend, George William Curtis." Few 
greater compliments could this diarist give than 
to compare a visitor to Curtis, the lamented. 

Mr. Cholmondeley left Concord for the South, 
going as far as to Virginia, in December and 
January ; then came back to Concord the 20th 
of January, 1859, and after a few days returned 
to Canada, and thence to England by way of 
Jamaica. He was in London when Theodore 
Parker reached there from Santa Cruz, in 
June, and called on him, with offers of service ; 
but does not seem to have heard of Parker's 
death till I wrote him in May, 1861. At my 
parting with him in Concord, he gave me money 
with which to buy grapes for the invalid father

of Thoreau, an instance of his constant con- 
sideration for others ; the Thoreaus hardly af- 
fording such luxuries as hothouse grapes for 
the sick. Sophia Thoreau, who perhaps was 
more appreciative of him than her more stoical 
brother, said after his death, 4i We have always 
had the truest regard for him, as a person of 
rare integrity, great benevolence, and the sin- 
cerest friendliness." This well describes the 
man whose every-day guise was literally set 
down by Mr. Ricketson. 

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, January 1, 1859. 

MR. BLAKE, It may interest you to hear 
that Cholmondeley has been this way again, via 
Montreal and Lake Huron, going to the West 
Indies, or rather to Weiss-nicht-wo, whither he 
urges me to accompany him. lit- is rather more 
demonstrative than before, and, on the whole, 
what would be called " a good fellow," is a 
man of principle, and quite reliable, but very 
peculiar. I have been to New Bedford with 
him, to show him a whaling town and Ricket- 
son. I was glad to hear that you had called on 
R. How did you like him? I suspect that 
you did not see one another fairly. 

I liave lately got back to that glorious society 
called Solitude, where we meet our friends con-

tinually, and can imagine the outside world also 
to be peopled. Yet some of my acquaintance 
would fain hustle me into the almshouse for 
the sake of society, as if I were pining for that 
diet, when I seem to myself a most befriended 
man, and find constant employment. However, 
they do not believe a word I say. They have 
got a club, the handle of which is in the Parker 
House at Boston, and with this they beat me 
from time to time, expecting to make me tender 
or minced meat, so fit for a club to dine off. 

" Hercules with his club 
The Dragon did drub ; 
But More of More Hall, 
With nothing at all, 
He slew the Dragon of Wantley." 

Ah ! that More of More Hall knew what fair 
play was. Channing, who wrote to me about it 
once, brandishing the club vigorously (being set 
on by another, probably), says now, seriously, 
that he is sorry to find by my letters that I am 
" absorbed in politics," and adds, begging my 
pardon for his plainness, " Beware of an extrane- 
ous life ! " and so he does his duty, and washes 
his hands of me. I tell him that it is as if he 
should say to the sloth, that fellow that creeps 
so slowly along a tree, and cries ai from time to 
time, ' " Beware of dancing ! " 

The doctors are all agreed that I am suffer- 



*r.4l.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 401 

ing for want of society. Was never a case like 
it. First, I did not know that I was suffering at 
all. Secondly, as an Irishman might say, I had 
thought it was indigestion of the society I got. 

As for the Parker House, I went there once, 
when the Club l was away, but I found it hard 
to see through the cigar smoke, and men were 
deposited about in chairs over the marble floor, 
as thick as legs of bacon in a smoke-house. It 
was all smoke, and no salt, Attic or other. The 
only room in Boston which I visit with alacrity 
is the Gentlemen's Room at the Fitchburg 
Depot, where I wait for the cars, sometimes for 
two hours, in order to get out of town. It is a 
paradise to the Parker House, for no smoking 
is allowed, and there is far more retirement. 
A large and respectable club of us hire it (Town 
and Country Club), and I am pretty sure to find 

1 The club with which Thorean here makes merry was the 
Saturday Club, meeting at Parker's Hotel in Boston the last 
Saturday in each month, of which Emerson, Agaasiz, Longfel- 
low, Holmes, Lowell, Henry James, and other men of letters 
were members. Thorean, though invited, never seems to have 
met with them, as Channing did, on one memorable occasion, 
at least, described by Mr. James in a letter cited in the Me- 
moir of Branson Alcott, who also occasionally dined with this 
clnb. The conversation at Emerson's next mentioned was 
also memorable for the vigor with which Miss Mary Emerson, 
then eighty-four years old, rebuked Mr. James for what she 
thought his dangerous Antinomian views concerning the moral 
law.

some one there whose face is set the same way 
as my own. 

My last essay, on which I am still engaged, is 
called Autumnal Tints. I do not know how read- 
able (i. e., by me to others) it will be. 

I met Mr. James the other night at Emer- 
son's, at an Alcottian conversation, at which, 
however, Alcott did not talk much, being dis- 
turbed by James's opposition. The latter is a 
hearty man enough, with whom you can differ 
very satisfactorily, on account of both his doc- 
trines and his good temper. He utters quasi 
philanthropic dogmas in a metaphysic dress ; 
but they are for all practical purposes very 
crude. He charges society with all the crime 
committed, and praises the criminal for com- 
mitting it. But I think that all the remedies 
he suggests out of his head for he goes no 
farther, hearty as he is would leave us about 
where we are now. For, of course, it is not by 
a gift of turkeys on Thanksgiving Day that he 
proposes to convert the criminal, but by a true 
sympathy with each one, with him, among the 
rest, who lyingly tells the world from the gal- 
lows that he has never been treated kindly by a 
single mortal since he was born. But it is not 
so easy a thing to sympathize with another, 
though you may have the best disposition to do 
it. There is Dobson over the hill. Have not 



*r.4l.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 403 

you and I and all the world been trying, ever 
since he was born, to sympathize with him ? (as 
doubtless he with us), and yet we have got no 
farther than to send him to the House of Cor- 
rection once at least ; and he, on the other hand, 
as I hear, has sent us to another place several 
times. This is the real state of things, as I un- 
derstand it, as least so far as James's remedies 
go. We are now, alas ! exercising what charity 
we actually have, and new laws would not give 
us any more. But, perchance, we might make 
some improvements in the House of Correction. 
You and I are Dobson ; what will James do for 



us.'

Have you found at last in your wanderings a 
place where the solitude is sweet? 

What mountain are you camping on nowa- 
days ? Though I had a good time at the moun- 
tains, I confess that the journey did not bear 
any fruit that I know of. I did not expect it 
would. The mode of it was not simple and ad- 
venturous enough. You must first have made 
an infinite demand, and not unreasonably, but 
after a corresponding outlay, have an all-absorb- 
ing purpose, and at the same time that your feet 
bear you hither and thither, travel much more 
in imagination. 

To let the mountains slide, live at home 
like a traveler. It should not be in vain that 



404 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1859 

these things are shown us from day to day. Is 
not each withered leaf that I see in my walks 
something which I have traveled to find ? 
traveled, who can tell how far ? What a fool 
he must be who thinks that his El Dorado is 
anywhere but where he lives ! 

We are always, methinks, in some kind of 
ravine, though our bodies may walk the smooth 
streets of Worcester. Our souls (I use this 
word for want of a better) are ever perched 
on its rocky sides, overlooking that lowland. 
(What a more than Tuckerman's Ravine is the 
body itself, in which the " soul " is encamped, 
when you come to look into it ! However, 
eagles always have chosen such places for their 
eyries.) 

Thus is it ever with your fair cities of the 
plain. Their streets may be paved with silver 
and gold, and six carriages roll abreast in them, 
but the real homes of the citizens are in the 
Tuckerman's Ravines which ray out from that 
centre into the mountains round about, one for 
each man, woman, and child. The masters of 
life have so ordered it. That is their beau-ideal 
of a country seat. There is no danger of being 
tuckered out before you get to it. 

So we live in Worcester and in Concord, each 
man taking his exercise regularly in his ravine, 
like a lion in his cage, and sometimes spraining 



*r.4l.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 405 

his ankle there. We have very few clear days, 
and a great many small plagues which keep us 
busy. Sometimes, I suppose, you hear a neigh- 
bor halloo (Brown, may be) and think it is a 
bear. Nevertheless, on the whole, we think it 
very grand and exhilarating, this ravine life. 
It is a capital advantage withal, living so high, 
the excellent drainage of that city of God. Rou- 
tine is but a shallow and insignificant sort of 
ravine, such as the ruts are, the conduits of pud- 
dles. But these ravines are the source of mighty 
streams, precipitous, icy, savage, as they are, 
haunted by bears and loup-cerviers ; there are 
born not only Sacos and Amazons, but prophets 
who will redeem the world. The at last smooth 
and fertilizing water at which nations drink and 
navies supply themselves begins with melted 
glaciers, and burst thunder-spouts. Let us pray 
that, if we are not flowing through some Mis- 
sissippi valley which we fertilize, and it is not 
likely we are, we may know ourselves shut in 
between grim and mighty mountain walk amid 
the clouds, falling a thousand feet in a mile, 
through dwarfed fir and spruce, over the rocky 
insteps of slides, being exercised in our minds, 
and so developed.

swered you earlier. About a week before you 
wrote there was good skating ; there is now none. 
As for the lecture, I shall be glad to come. I 
cannot now say when, but I will let you know, I 
think within a week or ten days at most, and will 
then leave you a week clear to make the arrange- 
ments in. I will bring something else than " What 
shall it profit a Man ? " My father is very sick, 
and has been for a long time, so that there is 
the more need of me at home. This occurs to 
me, even when contemplating so short an excur- 
sion as to Worcester. 

I want very much to see or hear your ac- 
count of your adventures in the Ravine, 1 and I 
trust I shall do so when I come to Worcester. 
Cholmondeley has been here again, returning 
from Virginia (for he went no farther south) to 
Canada; and will go thence to Europe, he 
thinks, in the spring, and never ramble any more. 
(January 29.) I am expecting daily that my 
father will die, therefore I cannot leave home at 
present. I will write you again within ten days. 

The death of John Thoreau (who was born

reau survived all her children except Sophia, 
and died in 1872. In a letter to Mr. Ricketson, 
Thoreau gave a just sketch of his father's char- 
acter. 

TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, 12th February, 1859. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I thank you for your 
kind letter. I sent you the notice of my father's 
death as much because you knew him as because 
you knew me. I can hardly realize that he is 
dead. He had been sick about two years, and 
at last declined rather rapidly, though steadily. 
Till within a week or ten days before he died he 
was hoping to see another spring, but he then 
discovered that this was a vain expectation, and, 
thinking that he was dying, he took his leave of 
us several times within a week before his depar- 
ture. Once or twice he expressed a slight impa- 
tience at the delay. He was quite conscious to 
the last. :iin I his death was so easy that, though 
we had all been sitting around the bed for an 
hour or more expecting that event (as we had 
sat before), he was gone at last, almost before 
we were aware of it. 

I am glad to read what you say of his soci.il 
nature. I think I may say that lie was wholly 
unpretending ; and there was this peculiarity in 
his aim, that though he had pecuniary difiicul- 



408 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1859, 

ties to contend with the greater part of his life, 
he always studied how to make a good article, 
pencil or other (for he practiced various arts), 
and was never satisfied with what he had pro- 
duced. Nor was he ever disposed in the least to 
put off a poor one for the sake of pecuniary gain, 
as if he labored for a higher end. 

Though he was not very old, and was not a 
native of Concord, I think that he was, on the 
whole, more identified with Concord street than 
any man now alive, having come here when he 
was about twelve years old, and set up for him- 
self as a merchant here, at the age of twenty-one, 
fifty years ago. As I sat in a circle the other 
evening with my mother and sister, my mother's 
two sisters, and my father's two sisters, it oc- 
curred to me that my father, though seventy-one, 
belonged to the youngest four of the eight who 
recently composed our family. 

How swiftly at last, but unnoticed, a genera- 
tion passes away ! Three years ago I was called 
with my father to be a witness to the signing 
of our neighbor Mr. Frost's will. Mr. Samuel 
Hoar, who was there writing it, also signed it. 
I was lately required to go to Cambridge to tes- 
tify to the genuineness of the will, being the only 
one of the four who could be there, and now I 
am the only one alive. 

My mother and sister thank you heartily 



JCT.4-.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 409 

for your sympathy. The latter, in particular, 
agrees with you in thinking that it is communion 
with still living and healthy nature alone which 
can restore to sane and cheerful views. I thank 
you for your invitation to New Bedford, but I 
feel somewhat confined here for the present. 

I did not know but we should see you the day 
after Alger was here. It is not too late for a 
winter walk in Concord. It does me good to 
hear of spring birds, and singing ones too, for 
spring seems far away from Concord yet. I am 
going to Worcester to read a parlor lecture on 
the 22d, and shall see Blake and Brown. What 
if you were to meet me there, or go with me 
from here ? You would see them to good advan- 
tage. Cholmondeley has been here again, after 
going as far south as Virginia, and left for Can- 
ada about three weeks ago. He is a good soul, 
and I am afraid I did not sufficiently recognize 
him. 

Please remember me to Mrs. Ricketson, and. 
to the rest of your family.

Mi;. BLAKE, I am not sure that I am in a

months and years on account of my family. 1 
This is the way I am serving King Admetus, 
confound him ! If it were not for my relations, 
I would let the wolves prey on his flocks to their 
bellies' content. Such fellows you have to deal 
with ! herdsmen of some other king, or of the 
same, who tell no tale, but in the sense of count- 
ing their flocks, and then lie drunk under a 
hedge. How is your grist ground? Not by 
some murmuring stream, while you lie dreaming 
on the bank ; but, it seems, you must take hold 
with your hands, and shove the wheel round. 
You can't depend on streams, poor feeble things ! 
You can't depend on worlds, left to themselves ; 
but you 've got to oil them and goad them along. 
In short, you 've got to carry on two farms at 
once, the farm on the earth and the farm in 
your mind. Those Crimean and Italian battles 
were mere boys' play, they are the scrapes 
into which truants get. But what a battle a

try ! How many enemies there are to sane 
thinking ! Every soldier has succumbed to them 
before he enlists for those other battles. Men 
may sit in chambers, seemingly safe and sound, 
and yet despair, and turn out at last only hol- 
lo wness and dust within, like a Dead Sea apple. 
A standing army of numerous, brave, and well- 
disciplined thoughts, and you at the head of 
them, marching straight to your goal, how to 
bring this about is the problem, and Scott's Tac- 
tics will not help you to it. Think of a poor 
fellow begirt only with a sword-belt, and no such 
staff of athletic thoughts ! his brains rattling as 
he walks and talks ! These are your praetorian 
guard. It is easy enough to maintain a family, 
or a state, but it is hard to maintain these chil- 
dren of your brain (or say, rather, these guests 
that trust to enjoy your hospitality), they make 
such great demands ; and yet, he who does only 
the former, and loses the power to think origi- 
nally, or as only he ever can, fails miserably. 
Keep up the fires of thought, and all will go 
well. 

Zouaves? pish! How you can overrun a 
country, climb any rampart, and carry any for- 
tress, witli an army of alert thoughts ! thoughts 
that send their bullets home to heaven's door, 
with which you can take the whole world, with- 
out paying for it, or robbing anybody. See, the

conquering hero comes ! You fail in your 
thoughts, or you prevail in your thoughts only. 
Provided you think well, the heavens falling, or 
the earth gaping, will be music for you to march 
by. No foe can ever see you, or you him ; you 
cannot so much as think of him. Swords have 
no edges, bullets no penetration, for such a con- 
test. In your mind must be a liquor which will 
dissolve the world whenever it is dropt in it. 
There is no universal solvent but this, and all 
things together cannot saturate it. It will hold 
the universe in solution, and yet be as translu- 
cent as ever. The vast machine may indeed roll 
over our toes, and we not know it, but it would 
rebound and be staved to pieces like an empty 
barrel, if it should strike fair and square on the 
smallest and least angular of a man's thoughts. 

You seem not to have taken Cape Cod the 
right way. I think that you should have perse- 
vered in walking on the beach and on the bank, 
even to the land's end, however soft, and so, by 
long knocking at Ocean's gate, have gained ad- 
mittance at last, better, if separately, and in 
a storm, not knowing where you would sleep by 
night, or eat by day. Then you should have 
given a day to the sand behind Provincetown, 
and ascended the hills there, and been blown on 
considerably. I hope that you like to remember 
the journey better than you did to make it.

MR. BLAKE, I spoke to my townsmen last

should like to speak to any company at Worces- 
ter who may wish to hear me ; and will come if 
only my expenses are paid. I think we should

The sooner the better. Perhaps Higginson may 
like to have a meeting. Wednesday evening 
would be a good time. The people here are 
deeply interested in the matter. Let me have 
an answer as soon as may be. 

P. S. I may be engaged toward the end of 
the week. 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

This address on John Brown was one of the 
first public utterances in favor of that hero ; it 
was made up mainly from the entries in Tho- 



414 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1859, 

reau's journals, since I had introduced Brown to 
him, and he to Emerson, in March, 1857 ; and 
specially from those pages that Thoreau had 
written after the news of Brown's capture in 
Virginia had reached him. It was first given in 
the vestry of the old parish church in Concord 
(where, in 1774, the Provincial Congress of 
Massachusetts had met to prepare for armed 
resistance to British tyranny) ; was repeated at 
Worcester the same week, and before a great 
audience in Boston, the following Sunday, 
after which it was published in the newspapers, 
and had a wide reading. Mr. Alcott in his 
diary mentions it under date of Sunday, Octo- 
ber 30, thus : " Thoreau reads a paper on John 
Brown, his virtues, spirit, and deeds, this even- 
ing, and to the delight of his company, the 
best that could be gathered at short notice, 
and among them Emerson. (November 4.) 
Thoreau calls and reports about the reading of 
his lecture on Brown at Boston and Worcester. 
He has been the first to speak and celebrate the 
hero's courage and magnanimity ; it is these 
that he discerns and praises. The men have 
much in common, the sturdy manliness, 
straightforwardness, and independence. (No- 
vember 5.) Bicketson from New Bedford ar- 
rives ; he and Thoreau take supper with us. 
Thoreau talks freely and enthusiastically about 



*r.42.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 415 

Brown, denouncing the Union, the President, 
the States, and Virginia particularly ; wishes 
to publish his late speech, and has seen Boston 
publishers, but failed to find any to print it for 
him." It was soon after published, along with 
Emerson's two speeches in favor of Brown, by 
a new Boston publishing house (Thayer & El-

per's Ferry," edited by the late James Redpath, 
Brown's first biographer. In the following 
summer, Thoreau sent a second paper on Brown 
(written soon after his execution) to be read at 
a commemoration of the martyr, beside his 
grave among the Adirondac Mountains. This 
is mentioned in his letter to Sophia Thoreau, 
July 8, 1860. He took an active part in arrang- 
ing for the funeral service in honor of Brown, 
at Concord, the day of his death, December 2,

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONOOBD, May 20, 1800. 

MR. BLAKE, I must endeavor to pay some 
of my debts to you. To begin where we left 
off, then. 

The presumption is that we are always the 
same ; our opportunities, and Nature herself, 
fluctuating. Look at mankind. No gmit dif- 
ference between two, apparently ; perhaps the

same height, and breadth, and weight ; and yet, 
to the man who sits most east, this life is a 
weariness, routine, dust and ashes, and he 
drowns his imaginary cares (!) (a sort of fric- 
tion among his vital organs) in a bowl. But to 
the man who sits most west, his contemporary (!), 
it is a field for all noble endeavors, an elysium, 
the dwelling-place of heroes and demigods. The 
former complains that he has a thousand affairs 
to attend to ; but he does not realize that his 
affairs (though they may be a thousand) and he 
are one. 

Men and boys are learning all kinds of trades 
but how to make men of themselves. They 
learn to make houses ; but they are not so well 
housed, they are not so contented in their houses, 
as the woodchucks in their holes. What is 
the use of a house if you have n't got a tolerable 
planet to put it on ? if you cannot tolerate 
the planet it is on ? Grade the ground first. If 
a man believes and expects great things of him- 
self, it makes no odds where you put him, or 
what you show him (of course you cannot put 
him anywhere, nor show him anything), he will 
be surrounded by grandeur. He is in the con- 
dition of a healthy and hungry man, who says 
to himself, HoW sweet this crust is ! If he 
despairs of himself, then Tophet is his dwell- 
ing-place, and he is in the condition of a sick

man who is disgusted with the fruits of finest 
flavor. 

Whether he sleeps or wakes, whether he 
runs or walks, whether he uses a microscope 
or a telescope, or his naked eye, a man never 
discovers anything, never overtakes anything, 
or leaves anything behind, but himself. What- 
ever he says or does, he merely reports himself. 
If he is in love, he loves ; if he is in heaven, 
he enjoys ; if he is in hell, he suffers. It is his 
condition that determines his locality. 

The principal, the only thing a man makes, is 
his condition of fate. Though commonly he 
does not know it. nor put up a sign to this effect, 
"My own destiny made and mended here." 
[Not yours.~\ lie is a master-workman in the 
business. He works twenty-four hours a day at 
it, and gets it done. Whatever else he neglects 
or botches, no man was ever known to neglect 
this work. A great many pretend to make 
shoes chiefly, and would scout the idea that they 
make the hard times which they experience. 

Each reaching and aspiration is an instinct 
with which* all nature consists and cooperates, 
and therefore it is not in vain. But alas ! each 
relaxing and desperation is an instinct too. To 
be active, well, happy, implies rare courage. To 
be ready to fight in a duel or a battle implies 
desperation, or that you hold your life -lu-:i|>. 



418 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1860, 

If you take this life to be simply what old 
religious folks pretend (I mean the effete, gone 
to seed in a drought, mere human galls stung 
by the devil once), then all your joy and seren- 
ity is reduced to grinning and bearing it. The 
fact is, you have got to take the world on your 
shoulders like Atlas, and " put along " with it. 
You will do this for an idea's sake, and your 
success will be in proportion to your devotion to 
ideas. It may make your back ache occasion- 
ally, but you will have the satisfaction of hang- 
ing it or twirling it to suit yourself. Cowards 
suffer, heroes enjoy. After a long day's walk 
with it, pitch it into a hollow place, sit down 
and eat your luncheon. Unexpectedly, by some 
immortal thoughts, you will be compensated. 
The bank whereon you sit will be a fragrant and 
flowery one, and your world in the hollow a 
sleek and light gazelle. 

Where is the " unexplored land " but in our 
own untried enterprises ? To an adventurous 
spirit any place London, New York, Worces- 
ter, or his own yard is " unexplored land," 
to seek which Fremont and Kane travel so far. 
To a sluggish and defeated spirit even the Great 
Basin and the Polaris are trivial places. If they 
can get there (and, indeed, they are there now), 
they will want to sleep, and give it up, just as 
they always do. These are the regions of the

unless that, wearing them, you may mend your 
ways ? Let us sing. 

TO SOPHIA THOREAU (AT CAMPTON, N. H.). 

COXCOED, July 8, 1860. 

DEAR SOPHIA, Mother reminds me that I 
must write to you, if only a few lines, though 
I have sprained my thumb, so that it is ques- 
tionable whether I can write legibly, if at all. 
I can't " bear on " much. What is worse, I 
believe that I have sprained my brain too that 
is, it sympathizes with my thumb. But that is 
no excuse, I suppose, for writing a letter in such 
a case, is like sending a newspaper, only a hint 
to let you know that " all is well," but my 
thumb. 

I hope that you begin to derive some benefit 
from that more mountainous air which you are 
breathing. Have you had a distinct view of the 
Franconia Notch Mountains (blue ]>eaks in the 
northern horizon) ? which I told you you could 
get from the road in Campton, probably from 
some other points nearer. Such a view of the 



420 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1860, 

mountains is more memorable than any other. 
Have you been to Squam Lake or overlooked it? 
I should think that you could make an excursion 
to some mountain in that direction from which 
you could see the lake and mountains generally. 
Is there no friend of N. P. Rogers who can tell 
you where the " lions " are ? 

Of course I did not go to North Elba, 1 but I 
sent some reminiscences of last fall. I hear that 
John Brown, Jr., has now come to Boston for a 
few days. Mr. Sanborn's case, it is said, will 
come on after some murder cases have been dis- 
posed of here. 

I have just been invited formally to be pres- 
ent at the annual picnic of Theodore Parker's 
society (that was), at Waverley, next Wednes- 
day, and to make some remarks. But that is 
wholly out of my line. I do not go to picnics, 
even in Concord, you know. 

Mother and Aunt Sophia rode to Acton in 
time yesterday. I suppose that you have heard 
that Mr. Hawthorne has come home. I went to 
meet him the other evening and found that he 
has not altered, except that he was looking quite

TO HARRISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, August 3, 1860. 

MR. BLAKE, I some time ago asked Chan- 
ning if he would not spend a week with me on 
Monadnoc; but he did not answer decidedly. 
Lately he has talked of an excursion somewhere, 
but I said that now I must wait till my sister re- 
turned from Plymouth, N. H. She has returned, 
and accordingly, on receiving your note this 
morning, I made known its contents to Clian- 
ning, in order to see how far I was engaged with 
him. The result is that he decides to go to 
Monadnoc to-morrow morning ; l so I must defer 

1 This is the excursion described by Thoreau in a subse- 
quent letter, laating six days, and the first that Channing 
had made which involved "camping out." It was also Tho- 
rean's hut visit to thin favorite mountain ; but Cltaimiii^ i-. in- 
tinned to go there after the death of his friend ; and sum.- of 
these visits are recorded in his poem, " The Wanderer." The 
last one was in September, 18<M), when I accompanied him, 
and we again spent five nights on the plateau where he had 
camped with Thoreau. At that time, one of the " two good 
spruce houses, half a mile apart," mentioned by Thoreau,

making an excursion with you and Brown to 
another season. Perhaps you will call as you 
pass the mountain. I send this by the earliest 
mail. 

P. S. That was a very insufficient visit you 
made here the last time. My mother is better, 
though far from well ; and if you should chance 
along here any time after your journey, I trust 
that we shall all do better. 

The mention by Thoreau of John Brown and 
my " case " recalls to me an incident of those 
excited days which followed the attack by Brown 
on slavery in Virginia. The day after Brown's 
death, but before the execution of his comrades, 
I received a message from the late Dr. David 
Thayer of Boston, implying, as I thought, that 
a son of Brown was at his house, whither I 
hurried to meet him. Instead, I found young 
F. J. Merriam of Boston, who had escaped with 
Owen Brown from Harper's Ferry, and was 

was still standing, in ruins, the place called by Channing 
" Henry's Camp," and thus described : 

We built our fortress where you see 
Ton group of spruce-trees, sidewise on the line 
Where the horizon to the eastward bounds, 
A point selected by sagacious art, 
Where all at once we viewed the Vermont hills, 
And the long outline of the mountain-ridge, 
Ever renewing, changeful every hour.

now in Boston to raise another party against the 
slaveholders. He was unfit to lead or even join 
in such a desperate undertaking, and we insisted 
he should return to safety in Canada, a large 
reward being offered for his seizure. He agreed 
to go back to Canada that night by the Fitch- 
burg Railroad ; but in his hotheaded way he took 
the wrong train, which ran no farther than Con- 
cord, and found himself in the early evening 
at my house, where my sister received him, but 
insisted that I should not see him, lest I might 
be questioned about my guest. While he had 
supper and went to bed, I posted down to Mr. 
Emerson's and engaged his horse and covered 
wagon, to be ready at sunrise, he asking no 
questions. In the same way I engaged Mr. 
Thoreau to drive his friend's horse to South 
Acton the next morning, and there put on board 
the first Canadian train a Mr. Lockwood, whom 
he would find at my house. Thoreau readily 
consented, asked no questions, walked to the 
Emerson stable the next morning, found the 
horse ready, drove him to my door, and took 
up Merriam, under the name of Lockwood, 
neither knowing who the other was. Martian 
was so flighty that, though he had agreed to go 
to Montreal, and knew that his life might de- 
pend on getting there early, he declared he nm-t 
see Mr. Emerson, to lay before him his }>Um 



424 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1859, 

for invading the South, and consult him about 
some moral questions that troubled his mind. 
His companion listened gravely, and hurried 
the horse towards Acton. Merriam grew more 
positive and suspicious, " Perhaps you are 
Mr. Emerson ; you look somewhat like him." l 
" No, I am not," said Thoreau, and drove steadily 
away from Concord. " Well, then, I am going 
back," said the youth, and flung himself out of 
the wagon. How Thoreau got him in again, he 
never told me ; but I suspected some judicious 
force, accompanying the grave persuasive speech 
natural to our friend. At any rate, he took his 
man to Acton, saw him safe on the train, and 
reported to me that " Mr. Lockwood had taken 
passage for Canada," where he arrived that 
night. Nothing more passed between us until, 
more than two years after, he inquired one day, 
in his last illness, who my fugitive was. Mer- 
riam was then out of danger in that way, and 
had been for months a soldier in the Union 
army, where he died. I therefore said that 
" Lockwood " was the grandson of his mother's 
old friend, Francis Jackson, and had escaped 
from Maryland. In return he gave me the odd 
incidents of their drive, and mentioned that he

reau's name to him, but never guessed who his companion 
was.

had spoken of the affair to his mother only shies 
his illness. So reticent and practically useful 
could he be ; as Channing says, " He made no 
useless professions, never asked one of those 
questions which destroy all relation ; but he was 
on the spot at the time, he meant friendship, 
and meant nothing else, and stood by it with- 
out the slightest abatement." 

TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, November 4, 1860. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I thank you for the 
verses. They are quite too good to apply to me. 
However, I know what a poet's license is, and 
will not get in the way. 

But what do you mean by that prose ? Why 
will you waste so many regards on me, and not 
know what to think of my silence ? Infer from 
it what you might from the silence of a dense 
pine wood. It is its natural condition, except 
when the winds blow, and the jays scream, and 
the chickadee winds up his clock. My silence is 
just as inhuman as that, and no more. You 
know that I never promised to correspond with 
you, and so, when I do, I do more than I prom- 



Such are my pursuits and habits, that I rarely 
go abroad ; and it is qtiite a habit with me to 
decline invitations to do HO. Not that I could 



426 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1860, 

not enjoy such visits, if I were not otherwise 
occupied. I have enjoyed very much my vis- 
its to you, and my rides in your neighborhood, 
and am sorry that I cannot enjoy such things 
oftener; but life is short, and there are other 
things also to be done. I admit that you are 
more social than I am, and far more attentive 
to " the common courtesies of life ; " but this is 
partly for the reason that you have fewer or less 
exacting private pursuits. 

Not to have written a note for a year is with 
me a very venial offense. I think that I do not 
correspond with any one so often as once in six 
months. 

I have a faint recollection of your invitation 
referred to ; but I suppose that I had no new 
nor particular reason for declining, and so made 
no new statement. I have felt that you would 
be glad to see me almost whenever I got ready 
to come ; but I only offer myself as a rare vis- 
itor, and a still rarer correspondent. 

I am very busy, after my fashion, little as 
there is to show for it, and feel as if I could not 
spend many days nor dollars in traveling; for 
the shortest visit must have a fair margin to it, 
and the days thus affect the weeks, you know. 
Nevertheless, we cannot forego these luxuries 
altogether. You must not regard me as a regu- 
lar diet, but at most only as acorns, which, too, 



MS. 43.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 427 

are not to be despised, which, at least, we love 
to think are edible in a bracing walk. We 
have got along pretty well together in several 
directions, though we are such strangers in 
others. 

I hardly know what to say in answer to your 
letter. Some are accustomed to write many let- 
ters, others very few. I am one of the last. At 
any rate, we are pretty sure, if we write at all, 
to send those thoughts which we cherish, to that 
one who, we believe, will most religiously attend 
to them. 

This life is not for complaint, but for satisfac- 
tion. I do not feel addressed by this letter of 
yours. It suggests only misunderstanding. In- 
tercourse may be good; but of what use are 
complaints and apologies? Any complaint / 
have to make is too serious to be uttered, for the 
evil cannot be mended. 

Turn over a new leaf. 

My out-door harvest this fall has been one 
Canada lynx, a fierce-looking fellow, which, it 
seems, we have hereabouts; eleven barrels of 
apples from trees of my own planting; and a 
large crop of white-oak acorns, which I did not 



Please remember me to your family. I have 
a very pleasant recollection of your fireside, and 
I trust that I shall revisit it; also of your 
shanty and the surrounding regions.

TO HARBISON BLAKE (AT WORCESTER). 

CONCORD, November 4, 1860. 

MR. BLAKE, I am glad to hear any partic- 
ulars of your excursion. As for myself, I looked 
out for you somewhat on that Monday, when, 
it appears, you passed Monadnoc ; turned my 
glass upon several parties that were ascending 
the mountain half a mile on one side of us. In 
short, I came as near to seeing you as you to 
seeing me. I have no doubt that we should have 
had a good time if you had come, for I had, all 
ready, two good spruce houses, in which you 
could stand up, complete in all respects, half a 
mile apart, and you and B. could have lodged 
by yourselves in one, if not with us. 

We made an excellent beginning of our moun- 
tain life. 1 You may remember that the Satur- 
day previous was a stormy day. Well, we went 
up in the rain, wet through, and found our- 
selves in a cloud there at mid-afternoon, in no 
situation to look about for the best place for a 
camp. So I proceeded at once, through the 
cloud, to that memorable stone, " chunk yard," 
in which we made our humble camp once, and 
there, after putting our packs under a rock, hav- 

1 This was Thoreau's last visit to Monadnoc, and the one 
mentioned in the note of August 3, and in Channmg's Wan- 
derer. 



r.4o.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 429 

ing a good hatchet, I proceeded to build a sub- 
stantial house, which Channing declared the 
handsomest he ever saw. (He never camped 
out before, and was, no doubt, prejudiced in its 
favor.) This was done about dark, and by that 
time we were nearly as wet as if we had stood 
in a hogshead of water. We then built a fire 
before the door, directly on the site of our little 
camp of two years ago, and it took a long time 
to burn through its remains to the earth be- 
neath. Standing before this, and turning round 
slowly, like meat that is roasting, we were as 
dry, if not drier, than ever, after a few hours, 
and so at last, we " turned in." 

This was a great deal better than going up 
there in fair weather, and having no adventure 
(not knowing how to appreciate either fair 
weather or foul) but dull, commonplace sleep in 
a useless house, and before a comparatively use- 
less fire, such as we get every night. Of 
course we thanked our stars, when we saw them, 
which was about midnight, that they had seem- 
ingly withdrawn for a season. We had the 
mountain all to ourselves that afternoon and 
night. There was nobody going up that day to 
engrave his name on the summit, nor to gather 
blueberries. The genius of the mountains saw UH 
starting from Concord, and it said, There como 
two of our folks. Let us get ready for them. 



430 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1860, 

Get up a serious storm, that will send a-packing 
these holiday guests. (They may have their say 
another time.) Let us receive them with true 
mountain hospitality, kill the fatted cloud. 
Let them know the value of a spruce roof, and 
of a fire of dead spruce stumps. Every bush 
dripped tears of joy at our advent. Fire did its 
best, and received our thanks. What could fire 
have done in fair weather ? Spruce roof got 
its share of our blessings. And then, such a 
view of the wet rocks, with the wet lichens on 
them, as we had the next morning, but did not 
get again ! 

We and the mountain had a sound season, as 
the saying is. How glad we were to be wet, in 
order that we might be dried! How glad we 
were of the storm which made our house seem 
like a new home to us ! This day's experience 
was indeed lucky, for we did not have a thunder- 
shower during all our stay. Perhaps our host 
reserved this attention in order to tempt us to 
come again. 

Our next house was more substantial still. 
One side was rock, good for durability; the 
floor the same ; and the roof which I made would 
have upheld a horse. I stood on it to do the 
shingling. 

I noticed, when I was at the White Mountains 
last, several nuisances which render traveling 



*r.43.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 431 

thereabouts unpleasant. The chief of these was 
the mountain houses. I might have supposed 
that the main attraction of that region, even to 
citizens, lay in its wildness and unlikeness to 
the city, and yet they make it as much like the 
city as they can afford to. I heard that the 
Crawford House was lighted with gas, and had 
a large saloon, with its band of music, for dan- 
cing. But give me a spruce house made in the 
rain. 

An old Concord farmer tells me that he as- 
cended Monadnoc once, and danced on the top. 
How did that happen ? Why, he being up there, 
a party of young men and women came up, bring- 
ing boards and a fiddler ; and, having laid down 
the boards, they made a level floor, on which 
they danced to the music of the fiddle. I sup- 
pose the tune was " Excelsior." This reminds 
me of the fellow who climbed to the top of a 
very high spire, stood upright on the ball, and 
hurrahed for what ? Why, for Harrison and 
Tyler. That 's the kind of sound which most 
ambitious people emit when .they culminate. 
They are wont to be singularly frivolous in the 
thin atmosphere; they can't contain themselves, 
though our comfort and their safety require it ; 
it takes the pressure of many atmospheres to do 
this ; and In-net' they helplessly evaporate there. 
It would seem that as they ascend, they breathe 



432 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [I860, 

shorter and shorter, and, at each expiration, 
some of their wits leave them, till, when they 
reach the pinnacle, they are so light-headed as 
to be fit only to show how the wind sits. I sus- 
pect that Emerson's criticism called " Monad- 
noc " was inspired, not by remembering the in- 
habitants of New Hampshire as they are in the 
valleys, so much as by meeting some of them on 
the mountain top. 

After several nights' experience, Channing 
came to the conclusion that he was " lying out- 
doors," and inquired what was the largest beast 
that might nibble his legs there. I fear that he 
did not improve all the night, as he might have 
done, to sleep. I had asked him to go and spend 
a week there. We spent five nights, being gone 
six days, for C. suggested that six working days 
made a week, and I saw that he was ready to 
decamp. However, he found his account in it 
as well as I. 

We were seen to go up in the rain, grim and 
silent, like two genii of the storm, by Fassett's 
men or boys ; but we were never identified after- 
ward, though we were the subject of some con- 
versation which we overheard. Five hundred 
persons at least came on to the mountain while 
we were there, but not one found our camp. We 
saw one party of three ladies and two gentlemen 
spread their blankets and spend the night on the 



.43.] TO HARRISON BLAKE. 433 

top, and heard them converse ; but they did not 
know that they had neighbors who were compar- 
atively old settlers. We spared them the chagrin 
which that knowledge would have caused them, 
and let them print their story in a newspaper 
accordingly. 

Yes, to meet men on an honest and simple 
footing, meet with rebuffs, suffer from sore feet, 
as you did, ay, and from a sore heart, as per- 
haps you also did, all that is excellent. What 
a pity that that young prince l could not enjoy a 
little of the legitimate experience of traveling 
be dealt with simply and truly, though rudely, 
lie might have been invited to some hospitable 
house in the country, had his bowl of bread and 
milk set before him, with a clean pinafore ; been 
told that there were the punt and the fishing-rod, 
and he could amuse himself as he chose ; might 
have swung a few birches, dug out a woodchuck, 
and had a regular good time, and finally been sent 
to bed with the boys, and so never have been 
introduced to Mr. Everett at all. I have no 
doubt that this would have been a far more 
memorable and valuable experience than he got. 

The snow-clad summit of Mount Washington 
must have been a very interesting sight from 
Wachusett. How wholesome winter is, seen far

or near ; how good, above all mere sentimental, 
warm-blooded, short-lived, soft-hearted, moral 
goodness, commonly so-called. Give me the 
goodness which has forgotten its own deeds, 
which God has seen to be good, and let be. None 
of your just made perfect, pickled eels ! All 
that will save them will be their picturesqueness, 
as with blasted trees. Whatever is, and is not 
ashamed to be, is good. I value no moral good- 
ness or greatness unless it is good or great, even 
as that snowy peak is. Pray, how could thirty 
feet of bowels improve it? Nature is goodness 
crystallized. You looked into the land of prom- 
ise. Whatever beauty we behold, the more it is 
distant, serene, and cold, the purer and more dur- 
able it is. It is better to warm ourselves with 
ice than with fire. 

Tell Brown that he sent me more than the 
price of the book, viz., a word from himself, for 
which I am greatly his debtor.

the 26th of February, at least, which is one day 
earlier than you date ; but I have not heard 
of larks nor pigeon-woodpeckers. To tell the 
truth, I am not on the alert for the signs of 
spring, not having had any winter yet. I took 



*r.43.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 435 

a severe cold about the 3d of December, which 
at length resulted in a kind of bronchitis, so 
that I have been confined to the house ever since, 
excepting a very few experimental trips as far 
as the post-office in some particularly fine noons. 
My health otherwise lias not been affected in 
the least, nor my spirits. I have simply been 
imprisoned for so long, and it has not prevented 
my doing a good deal of reading and the like. 

Channing has looked after me very faitlif ully ; 
says he has made a study of my case, and knows 
me better than I know myself, etc., etc. Of 
course, if I knew how it began, I should know 
better how it would end. I trust that when 
warm weather comes I shall begin to pick up 
my crumbs. I thank you for your invitation to 
come to New Bedford, and will bear it in mind ; 
but at present my health will not permit my 
leaving home. 

The day I received your letter, Blake and 
Brown arrived here, having walked from Worces- 
ter in two days, though Alcott, who happened 
in soon after, could not understand what pleas- 
ure they found in walking across the country 
in this season, when the ways were so unsettled. 
I had a solid talk with them for a day and a half 
though my pipes were not in good order 
and they went tln-h way again. 

You may be interested to hear that Alcott is

at present, perhaps, the most successful man in 
the town. He had his second annual exhibition 
of all the schools in the town, at the Town Hall 
last Saturday; at which all the masters and 
misses did themselves great credit, as I hear, 
and of course reflected some on their teachers 
and parents. They were making their little 
speeches from one till six o'clock p. M., to a 
large audience, which patiently listened to the 
end. In the mean while, the children made Mr. 
Alcott an unexpected present of a fine edition of 
" Pilgrim's Progress " and " Herbert's Poems," 
which, of course, overcame all parties. I inclose 
an Order of Exercises. 1 

We had, last night, an old-fashioned north- 
east snow-storm, far worse than anything in the 
winter ; and the drifts are now very high above 
the fences. The inhabitants are pretty much 
confined to their houses, as I was already. All 
houses are one color, white, with the snow plas- 

1 In April, 1859, Mr. Alcott was chosen superintendent of 
tie public schools of Concord, by a school committee of which 
Mr. Bull, the creator of the Concord grape, and Mr. Sanborn, 
were members, and for some years he directed the studies of 
the younger pupils, to their great benefit and delight. At the 
yearly "exhibitions," songs were sung composed by Louisa 
Alcott and others, and the whole town assembled to see and 
hear. The stress of civil war gradually checked this idyllic 
movement, and Mr. Alcott returned to his garden and library. 
It was two years after this that Miss Alcott had her severe 
experience as hospital nurse at Washington.

tered over them, and you cannot tell whether 
they have blinds or not. Our pump has another 
pump, its ghost, as thick as itself, sticking to 
one side of it. The town has sent out teams -of 
eight oxen each, to break out the roads ; and the 
train due from Boston at S\ A. M. has not ar- 
rived yet (4 P. M.). All the passing has been 
a train from above at 12 M., which also was due 
at 8 A. M. Where are the bluebirds now, 
think you? I suppose that you have not so 
much snow at New Bedford, if any. 

TO PARKER PILLSBURY (AT COXCORD, N. H.). 
CONCORD, April 10, 1861. 

FRIEND PILLSBURY, I am sorry to say that 
I have not a copy of u Walden " which I can 
spare ; and know of none, unless possibly Tick- 
nor & Fields may have one. I send, neverthe- 
less, a copy of " The Week," the price of which 
is one dollar and twenty-five cents, which you 
can pay at your convenience. 

As for your friend, my prospective reader, I 
hope he ignores Fort Sumter, and " Old Abe," 
and all that ; for that is just the most fatal, and, 
indeed, the only fatal weapon you can direct 
against evil, ever ; for, as long as you know of 
it, you are particeps criminis. What business 
have you, if you are " an angel of light," to be 
pondering over the deeds of darkness, reading 
thu "New York Herald," and the lik.- ? 



438 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

I do not so much regret the present condition 
of things in this country (provided I regret it 
at all), as I do that I ever heard of it. I know 
one or two, who have this year, for the first time, 
read a President's Message ; but they do not 
see that this implies a fall in themselves, rather 
than a rise in the President. Blessed were the 
days before you read a President's Message. 
Blessed are the young, for they do not read the 
President's Message. Blessed are they who 
never read a newspaper, for they shall see 
Nature, and, through her, God. 

But, alas ! / have heard of Sumter and Pick- 
ens, and even of Buchanan (though I did not 
read his Message). I also read the " New York 
Tribune ; " but then, I am reading Herodotus 
and Strabo, and Blodget's " Climatology," and 
"Six Years in the Desert of North America," 
as hard as I can, to counterbalance it. 

By the way, Alcott is at present our most 
popular and successful man, and has just pub- 
lished a volume in size, in the shape of the An- 
nual School Report, which I presume he has 
sent to you. 

Yours, for remembering all good things, 

HENEY D. THOEEAU. 

Parker Pillsbury, to whom this letter went, 
was an old friend of the Thoreau family, with 



jcr.43.] CHOLMONDELEY TO THOREAU. 439 

whom he became intimate in the anti-slavery 
agitation, wherein they took part, while he was a 
famous orator, celebrated by Emerson in one of 
his Essays. Mr. Pillsbury visited Thoreau in 
his last illness, when he could scarcely speak 
above a whisper, and, having made to him some 
remark concerning the future life, Thoreau re- 
pKed, " My friend, one world at a time." His 
petulant words in this letter concerning na- 
tional affairs would hardly have been said a 
few days later, when, at the call of Abraham 
Lincoln, the people rose to protect their govern- 
ment, and every President's Message became of 
thrilling interest, even to Thoreau. 

Arrangements were now making for the inva- 
lid, about whose health his friends had been 
anxious for some years, to travel for a better cli- 
mate than the New England spring affords, and 
early in May Thoreau set out for the upper Mis- 
sissippi. He thus missed the last letter sent to 
him by his English friend Cholmondeley, which 
I answered, and then forwarded to him at Red- 
wing, in Minnesota. It is of interest enough to 
be given here. 

T. CHOLMOXDELEY TO THOREAU (iN MINNESOTA). 
SHREWSBURY [England], April 23, 1861. 

MY DEAR THOREAU, It is now some time 
since I wrote to you or heard from you, but do 



440 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [18(51, 

not suppose that I have forgotten you, or shall 
ever cease to cherish in my mind those clays at 
dear old Concord. The last I heard about you 
all was from Morton, 1 who was in England about 
a year ago ; and I hope that he has got over his 
difficulties and is now in his own country again. 
I think he has seen rather more of English 
country life than most Yankee tourists ; and ap- 
peared to find it curious, though I fear he was 
dulled by our ways ; for he was too full of cere- 
mony and compliments and bows, which is a 
mistake here ; though very well in Spain. I am 
afraid he was rather on pins and needles ; but 
he made a splendid speech at a volunteer sup- 
per, and indeed the very best, some said, ever 
heard in this part of the country. 

We are here in a state of alarm and appre- 
hension, the world being so troubled in East 
and West and everywhere. Last year the har- 
vest was bad and scanty. This year our trade 
is beginning to feel the events in America. In 
reply to the northern tariff, of course we are 
going to smuggle as much as we can. The sup- 
ply of cotton being such a necessity to us, we 
must work up India and South Africa a little 
better. There is war even in old New Zealand,

but not in the same island where my people are! 
Besides, we are certainly on the eve of a conti- 
nental blaze, so we are making merry and liv- 
ing while we can ; not being sure where we shall 
be this time a year. 

Give my affectionate regards to your father, 
mother, and sister, and to Mr. Emerson and his 
family, and to Channing, Sanborn, Ricketson, 
Blake, and Morton and Alcott and Parker. A 
thought arises in my mind whether I may not 
be enumerating some dead men ! Perhaps Par- 
ker is ! 

These rumors of wars make me wish that we 
had got done with this brutal stupidity of war 
altogether ; and I believe, Thoreau, that the hu- 
man race will at last get rid of it, though per- 
haps not in a creditable way ; but such powers 
will be brought to bear that it will become mon- 
strous even to the French. Dundonald declared 
to the last that he possessed secrets which from 
their tremendous character would make war im- 
possible. So peace may be begotten from the 
machinations of evil. 

Have you heard of any good books lately ? I 
think " Burnt Njal " good, and believe it to be 
genuine. " Hast thou not heard " (says Stein- 
rora to Thangbrand) "how Thor challenged 
Christ to single combat, and how he did not 
dare to fight with Thor?" When Gunnar

brandishes his sword, three swords are seen in 
air. The account of Ospah and Brodir and Bri- 
an's battle is the only historical account of tLst 
engagement, which the Irish talk so much of ; 
for I place little trust in O'Halloran's authority, 
though the outline is the same in both. 

Darwin's " Origin of Species " may be fanci- 
ful, but it is a move in the right direction. Em- 
erson's " Conduct of Life " has done me good ; 
but it will not go down in England for a gener- 
ation or so. But these are some of them already 
a year or two old. The book of the season is 
Du Chaillu's " Central Africa," with accounts of 
the Gorilla, of which you are aware that you 
have had a skeleton at Boston for many years. 
There is also one in the British Museum ; but 
they have now several stuffed specimens at the 
Geographical Society's rooms in Town. I sup- 
pose you will have seen Sir Emerson Tennent's 
" Ceylon," which is perhaps as complete a book 
as ever was published ; and a better monument 
to a governor's residence in a great province was 
never made. 

We have been lately astonished by a foreign 
Hamlet, a supposed impossibility ; but Mr. Fech- 
ter does real wonders. No doubt he will visit 
America, and then you may see the best actor 
in the world. He has carried out Goethe's idea 
of Hamlet as given in the " Wilhelm Meister,"

MR. BLAKE, I am still as much an invalid

the cold weather may come again, before I get 

1 A word may be said of the after life of this magnanimous 
Englishman, who did not long survive his Concord correspond- 
ent. In March, 1863, being then in command of a battalion 
of Shropshire Volunteers, which he had raised, he inherited 
Condover Hall and the Urge estate adjacent, and took the 
name of Owen as a condition of the inheritance. A year later 
he married Miss Victoria Cotes, daughter of John and Lady 
Louisa Cotes (Co. Salop), a godchild of the Queen, and went 
to Italy for his wedding-tour. In Florence he was seized with 
a malignant fever, April 10, 1864, and died there April 20, 
not quite two years after Thoreau's death. His brother Regi- 
nald, who had met him in Florence, carried back his remains 
to England, and he is buried in Condover churchyard. Writ- 
ing to an American friend, Mr. R. Cholmondeley said : " The 
whole county mourned for one who had made himself greatly 
beloved. During his illness his thoughts went back very much 
to America and her great sufferings. His large heart felt for 
your country as if it were his own." It seems that he did not 
go to New Zealand with the " Canterbury Pilgrims," as sug- 
gested in the Atlantic Monthly (December, ISU'5), but in the 
first of Lord Lyttelton's ships (the Charlotte Jane), having 
joined in Lord L.'s scheme for colonizing tin* island, where be 
remained only six months, near Chrutchurch.

over my bronchitis. The doctor accordingly 
tells me that I must " clear out " to the West 
Indies, or elsewhere, he does not seem to care 
much where. But I decide against the West 
Indies, on account of their muggy heat in the 
summer, and the South of Europe, on account of 
the expense of time and money, and have at last 
concluded that it will be most expedient for me 
to try the air of Minnesota, say somewhere 
about St. Paul's. I am only waiting to be well 
enough to start. Hope to get off within a week 
or ten days. 

The inland air may help me at once, or it may 
not. At any rate, I am so much of an invalid, 
that I shall have to study my comfort in travel- 
ing to a remarkable degree, stopping to rest, 
etc., etc., if need be. I think to get a through 
ticket to Chicago, with liberty to stop frequently 
on the way, making my first stop of consequence 
at Niagara Falls, several days or a week, at a 
private boarding-house ; then a night or day at 
Detroit ; and as much at Chicago as my health 
may require. At Chicago I can decide at what 
point (Fulton, Dunleith, or another) to strike 
the Mississippi, and take a boat to St. Paul's. 

I trust to find a private boarding-house in 
one or various agreeable places in that region, 
and spend my time there. I expect, and shall 
be prepared, to be gone three months ; and I 



*r.43.] TO F. B. SANBORN. 445 

would like to return by a different route, 
perhaps Mackinaw and Montreal. 

I have thought of finding a companion, of 
course, yet not seriously, because I had no right 
to offer myself as a companion to anybody, hav- 
ing such a peculiarly private and all-absorbing 
but miserable business as ///// health, and not 
altogether his, to attend to, causing me to stop 
here and go there, etc., etc., unaccountably." 

Nevertheless, I have just now decided to let 
you know of my intention, thinking it barely 
possible that you might like to make a part or 
the whole of this journey at the same time, and 
that perhaps your own health may be such as to 
be benefited by it. 

Pray let me know if such a statement offers 
any temptations to you. I write in great haste 
for the mail, and must omit all the mural. 

TO P. B. -AM:MU\ (AT CONCORD). 

REDWING, Minnesota, June 26, 1861. 

MR. SANBORN, I was very glad to find 
awaiting me, on my arrival here on Sunday after- 
noon, a letter from you. I have performed this 
journey in a very dead and alive manner, but 
nothing has come so near waking me up as the 
!|t of letters from Concord. I read yours, 
and one from my sister (and Horace Mann, his 
four), near the top of a remarkable isolated 



446 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

bluff here, called Barn Bluff, or the Grange, or 
Redwing Bluff, some four hundred and fifty feet 
high, and half a mile long, a bit of the main 
bluff or bank standing alone. The top, as you 
know, rises to the general level of the surround- 
ing country, the river having eaten out so much. 
Yet the valley just above and below this (we 
are at the head of Lake Pepin) must be three 
or four miles wide. 

I am not even so well informed as to the pro- 
gress of the war as you suppose. I have seen 
but one Eastern paper (that, by the way, was 
the " Tribune ") for five weeks. I have not 
taken much pains to get them ; but, necessarily, 
I have not seen any paper at all for more than 
a week at a time. The people of Minnesota 
have seemed to me more cold, to feel less im- 
plicated in this war than the people of Massa- 
chusetts. It is apparent that Massachusetts, for 
one State at least, is doing much more than her 
share in carrying it on. However, I have dealt 
partly with those of Southern birth, and have 
seen but little way beneath the surface. I was 
glad to be told yesterday that there was a good 
deal of weeping here at Redwing the other day, 
when the volunteers stationed at Fort Snelling 
followed the regulars to the seat of the war. 
They do not weep when their children go up the 
river to occupy the deserted forts, though they 
may have to fight the Indians there. 



2TT.43.] TO F. B. SAtfBORN. 447 

I do not even know what the attitude of Eng- 
land is at present. 

The grand feature hereabouts is, of course, 
the Mississippi River. Too much can hardly be 
said of its grandeur, and of the beauty of this 
portion of it (from Dunleith, and probably from 
Rock Island to this place). St. Paul is a dozen 
miles below the Falls of St. Anthony, or near 
the head of uninterrupted navigation on the 
main stream, about two thousand miles from its 
mouth. There is not a " rip " below that, and 
the river is almost as wide in the upper as the 
lower part of its course. Steamers go up to the 
Sauk Rapids, above the Falls, near a hundred 
miles farther, and then you are fairly in the pine- 
woods and lumbering country. Thus it flows 
from the pine to the palm. 

The lumber, as you know, is sawed chiefly at 
the Falls of St. Anthony (what is not rafted in 
the log to ports far below), having given rise to 
the towns of St. Anthony, Minneapolis, etc., etc. 
In coming up the river from Dunleith, you meet 
with great rafts of sawed lumber and of logs, 
twenty rods or more in length, by five or six 
wide, floating down, all from the pine region 
above the Falls. An old Maine lumberer, who 
has followed the same business here, tells me 
that the sources of the Mississippi were compar- 
atively free from rocks and rapids, making easy 



448 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

work for them ; but he thought that the timber 
was more knotty here than in Maine. 

It has chanced that about half the men whom 
I have spoken with in Minnesota, whether trav- 
elers or settlers, were from Massachusetts. 

After spending some three weeks in and about 
St. Paul, St. Anthony, and Minneapolis, we made 
an excursion in a steamer, some three hundred 
or more miles up the Minnesota (St. Peter's) 
River, to Redwood, or the Lower Sioux Agency, 
in order to see the plains, and the Sioux, who 
were to receive their annual payment there. 
This is eminently the river of Minnesota (for 
she shares the Mississippi with Wisconsin), and 
it is of incalculable value to her. It flows 
through a very fertile country, destined to be 
famous for its wheat ; but it is a remarkably 
winding stream, so that Redwood is only half as 
far from its mouth by land as by water. There 
was not a straight reach a mile in length as far 
as we went, generally you could not see a 
quarter of a mile of water, and the boat was 
steadily turning this way or that. At the greater 
bends, as the Traverse des Sioux, some of the 
passengers were landed, and walked across to be 
taken in on the other side. Two or three times 
you could have thrown a stone across the neck 
of the isthmus, while it was from one to three 
miles around it. It was a very novel kind of 



MT.43.] TO F. B. SANBORN. 449 

navigation to me. The boat was perhaps the 
largest that had been up so high, and the water 
was rather low (it had been about fifteen feet 
higher). In making a short turn, we repeatedly 
and designedly ran square into the steep and 
soft bank, taking in a cart-load of earth, this 
being more effectual than the rudder to fetch us 
about again ; or the deeper water was so narrow 
and close to the shore, that we were obliged to 
run into and break down at least fifty trees 
which overhung the water, when we did not cut 
them off, repeatedly losing a part of our out- 
works, though the most exposed had been taken 
in. I could pluck almost any plant on the bank 
from the boat. We very frequently got aground, 
and then drew ourselves along with a windlass 
and a cable fastened to a tree, or we swung 
round in the current, and completely blocked up 
and blockaded the river, one end of the boat 
resting on each shore. And yet we would haul 
ourselves round again with the windlass and ca- 
ble in an hour or two, though the boat was about 
one hundred and sixty feet long, and drew some 
three feet of water, or, often, water and sand. 
It was one consolation to know that in such a 
case we were all the while damming the river, 
and si i mining it. We once ran fairly on to a 
concealed rock, with a shock that aroused all the 
passengers, and rested there, and the mate went 



450 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

below with a lamp, expecting to find a hole, but 
he did not. Snags and sawyers were so common 
that I forgot to mention them. The sound of 
the boat rumbling over one was the ordinary 
music. However, as long as the boiler did not 
burst, we knew that no serious accident was 
likely to happen. Yet this was a singularly 
navigable river, more so than the Mississippi 
above the Falls, and it is owing to its very crook- 
edness. Ditch it straight, and it would not only 
be very swift, but soon run out. It was from 
ten to fifteen rods wide near the mouth, and 
from eight to ten or twelve at Redwood. Though 
the current was swift, I did not see a " rip " on 
it, and only three or four rocks. For three 
months in the year I am told that it can be nav- 
igated by small steamers about twice as far as 
we went, or to its source in Big Stone Lake ; 
and a former Indian agent told me that at high 
water it was thought that such a steamer might 
pass into the Red River. 

In short, this river proved so very long and 
navigable, that I was reminded of the last letter 
or two in the voyage of the Baron la Hontan 
(written near the end of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, I think), in which he states, that, after 
reaching the Mississippi (by the Illinois or Wis- 
consin), the limit of previous exploration west- 
ward, he voyaged up it with his Indians, and at 



*r.43.] TO F. B. SANBORN. 451 

length turned up a great river coming in from 
the west, which he called " La Riviere Longue ; " 
and he relates various improbable things about 
the country and its inhabitants, so that this let- 
ter has been regarded as pure fiction, or, more 
properly speaking, a lie. But I am somewhat 
inclined now to reconsider the matter. 

The Governor of Minnesota (Ramsay), the 
superintendent of Indian affairs in this quarter, 
and the newly-appointed Indian agent were on 
board ; also a German band from St. Paul, a 
small cannon for salutes, and the money for the 
Indians (ay, and the gamblers, it was said, who 
were to bring it back in another boat). There 
were about one hundred passengers, chiefly from 
St. Paul, and more or less recently from the 
northeastern States; also half a dozen young 
educated Englishmen. Chancing to speak with 
one who sat next to me, when the voyage was 
nearly half over, I found that he was the son 
of the Rev. Samuel May, 1 and a classmate of 
yours, and had been looking for us at St. An- 
thony. 

The last of the little settlements on the river 
was New Ulm, about one hundred miles this side 
of Redwood. It consists wholly of Germans. 
"WV left them one hundred barrels of salt, which 
will be worth something more, when the water 
is lowest, than at present.

452 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

Redwood is a mere locality, scarcely an In- 
dian village, where there is a store, and some 
houses have been built for them. We were now 
fairly on the great plains, and looking south ; 
and, after walking that way three miles, could 
see no tree in that horizon. The buffalo was 
said to be feeding within twenty-five or thirty 
miles. 

A regular council was held with the Indians, 
who had come in on their ponies, and speeches 
were made on both sides through an interpreter, 
quite in the described mode, the Indians, as 
usual, having the advantage in point of truth 
and earnestness, and therefore of eloquence. 
The most prominent chief was named Little 
Crow. They were quite dissatisfied with the 
white man's treatment of them, and probably 
have reason to be so.^ This council was to be 
continued for two or three days, the payment 
to be made the second day ; and another pay- 
ment to other bands a little higher up, on the 
Yellow Medicine (a tributary of the Minnesota), 
a few days thereafter. 

In the afternoon, the half-naked Indians per- 
formed a dance, at the request of the Governor, 
for our amusement and their own benefit ; and 
then we took leave of them, and of the officials 
who had come to treat with them. 

Excuse these pencil marks, but my inkstand

is unscrewable, and I can only direct my letter 
at the bar. I could tell you more, and perhaps 
more interesting things, if I had time. I am 
considerably better than when I left home, but 
still far from well. 

Our faces are already set toward home. Will 
you please let my sister know that we shall prob- 
ably start for Milwaukee and Mackinaw in a 
day or two (or as soon as we hear from home) 
via Prairie du Chien, and not La Crosse. 

I am glad to hear that you have written to 
Cholmondeley, 1 as it relieves me of some rej)on- 
aibttity. 

The tour described in this long letter was the 
first and last that Thoreau ever made west of the 
Mohawk Valley, though his friend Channing had 
early visited the great prairies, and lived in log 
cabins of Illinois, or sailed on the chain of great 
lakes, by which Thoreau made a part of this 
journey. It was proposed that Channing should 
accompany him this time, as he had in the tour 
through Lower Canada, and along Cape Cod, as 
well as in the journeys through the Berkshire 
and Catskill mountains, and down the Hudson ; 
but some misunderstanding or temporary incon- 
venience prevented. The actual comrade was 

1 I had answered T. ("hulmondeley'a last letter, explaining 
that Thoreau WM ill and absent 



454 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

young Horace Mann, eldest son of the school-re- 
former and statesman of that name, a silent, 
earnest, devoted naturalist, who died early. The 
place where his party met the Indians only a 
few months before the Minnesota massacre of 
1862 was in the county of Redwood, in the 
southwest of the State, where now is a thriving 
village of 1,500 people, and no buffaloes within 
five hundred miles. Redwing, whence the letter 
was written, is below St. Paul, on the Mississippi, 
and was even then a considerable town, now a 
city of 7,000 people. The civil war had lately 
begun, and the whole North was in the first flush 
of its uprising in defense of the Union, for 
which Thoreau, in spite of his earlier defiance of 
government (for its alliance with slavery) was 
as zealous as any soldier. He returned in July, 
little benefited by the journey, of which he did 
not take his usual sufficiency of notes, and to 
which there is little allusion in his books. Nor 
does it seem that he visited on the way his corre- 
spondent since January, 1856, C. H. Green, 
of Rochester, Michigan, who had never seen 
him in Concord. The opinion of Thoreau him- 
self concerning this journey will be found in his 
next letter to Daniel Ricketson.

CONCORD, August 15, 1861. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, When your last letter 
was written I was away in the far Northwest, in 
search of health. My cold turned to bronchitis, 
which made me a close prisoner almost up to the 
moment of my starting on that journey, early in 
May. As I had an incessant cough, my doctor 
told me that I must "clear out," to the West 
Indies, or elsewhere, so I selected Minnesota. 
I returned a few weeks ago, after a good deal 
of steady traveling, considerably, yet not essen- 
tially, better ; my cough still continuing. If I 
don't mend very quickly, I shall be obliged to go 
to another climate again very soon. 

My ordinary pursuits, both indoors and out, 
have been for the most part omitted, or seri- 
ously interrupted, walking, boating, scribbling, 
etc. Indeed, I have been sick so long that I 
have almost forgotten what it is to be well ; and 
yet I feel that it is in all respects only my m- 
\v 1<>] if . Channing and Emerson are as well as 
usual; but Alcott, I am sorry to say, has for 
some time been more or less confined by a lame- 
ness, perhaps of a neuralgic character, occasioned 
by carrying too great a weight on his back while 
gardening. 

On returning home, I found various letters 



456 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

awaiting me ; among others, one from Cholmon de- 
ley, and one from yourself. 

Of course I am sufficiently surprised to Lear 
of your conversion ; 1 yet I scarcely know what 
to say about it, unless that, judging by your 
account, it appears to me a change which con- 
cerns yourself peculiarly, and will not make you 
more valuable to mankind. However, perhaps I 
must see you before I can judge. 

Remembering your numerous invitations, I 
write this short note now, chiefly to say that, if 
you are to be at home, and it will be quite agree- 
able to you, I will pay you a visit next week, and 
take such rides or sauntering walks with you as 
an invalid may. 

The visit was made, and we owe to it the pres- 
ervation of the latest portraiture of Thoreau, 
who, at his friend's urgency, sat to a photogra- 
pher in New Bedford ; and thus we have the full- 
bearded likeness of August, 1861 ; from which, 
also, and from personal recollection, Mr. Walter 
Ricketson made the fine profile medallion en- 
graved for this volume. 

1 A return to religious Quakerism, of which his friend had 
written enthusiastically.

TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, October 14, 1861. 

FRIEND RICKETSON, I think that, on the 
whole, my health is better than when you were 
here; but my faith in the doctors has not in- 
creased. I thank you all for your invitation to 
come to New Bedford, but I suspect that it must 
still be warmer here than there; that, indeed, 
New Bedford is warmer than Concord only in 
the winter, and so I abide by Concord. 

September was pleasanter and much better for 
me than August, and October has thus far been 
quite tolerable. Instead of riding on horse- 
back, I ride in a wagon about every other day. 
My neighbor, Mr. E. R. Hoar, has two horses, 
and he, being away for the most part this fall, 
has generously offered me the use of one of them ; 
and, as I notice, the dog throws himself in, and 
does scouting duty. 

- 1 am glad to hear that you no longer chew, but 
eschew, sugar-plums. One of the worst effects 
of sickness is, that it may get one into the habit 
of taking a little something his bitters, or 
sweets, as if for his bodily good from time to 
time, when he does not need it. However, there 
is no danger of this if you do not dose even when 
you are sick. 

I went with a Mr. Rodman, a young man of 



458 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1861, 

your town, here the other day, or week, looking 
at farms for sale, and rumor says that he is in- 
clined to buy a particular one. Channing says 
that he received his book, but has not got any of 
yours. 

It is easy to talk, but hard to write. 

From the worst of all correspondents, 

HENRY D. THOREAU. 

No later letter than this was written by Tho- 
reau's own hand; for he was occupied all the 
winter of 1861-62, when he could write, in pre- 
paring his manuscripts for the press. Nothing 
appeared before his death, but in June, 1862, 
Mr. Fields, then editing the " Atlantic," printed 
" Walking," the first of three essays which 
came out in that magazine the same year. No- 
thing of Thoreau's had been accepted for the 
"Atlantic" since 1858, when he withdrew the 
rest of " Chesuncook," then coming out in its 
pages, because the editor (Mr. Lowell) had made 
alterations in the manuscript. In April, just 
before his death, the " Atlantic " printed a short 
and characteristic sketch of Thoreau by Bronson 
Alcott, and in August, Emerson's funeral ora- 
tion, given in the parish church of Concord. 
During the last six months of his illness, his sis- 
ter and his friends wrote letters for him, as will 
be seen by the two that follow.

SOPHIA TUOREAU TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW 
BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, December 19, 1861. 

MR. RICKETSON: 

Dear /Sir, Thank you for your friendly in- 
terest in my dear brother. I wish that I could 
report more favorably in regard to his health. 
Soon after your visit to Concord, Henry com- 
menced riding, and almost every day he intro- 
duced me to some of his familiar haunts, far away 
in the thick woods, or by the ponds ; all very 
new and delightful to me. The air and exercise 
which he enjoyed during the fine autumn days 
were a benefit to him ; he seemed stronger, had a 
good appetite, and was able to attend somewhat 
to his writing; but since the cold weather has 
come, his cough has increased, and he is able to 
go out but seldom. Just now he is suffering 
from an attack of pleurisy, which confines him 
wholly to the house. His spirits do not fail him ; 
he continues in his usual serene mood, which is 
very pleasant for his friends as well as himself. 
I am hoping for a short winter and early spring, 
that the invalid may again be out of doors. 

I am sorry to hear of your in<lis|x>sition, 
and trust that you will be well again soon. It 
would give me pleasure to see some of your 
newspaj)er articles, since you possess a hopeful 



460 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1862, 

spirit. My patience is nearly exhausted. The 
times look very dark. I think the next soldier 
who is shot for sleeping on his post should be 
Gen. McClellan. Why does he not do some- 
thing in the way of fighting? I despair of ever 
living under the reign of Sumner or Phillips. 

BRONSON ALCOTT TO DANIEL RICKETSON (AT NEW 
BEDFORD). 

CONCORD, January 10, 1862. 

DEAR FRIEND, You have not been informed 
of Henry's condition this winter, and will be 
sorry to hear that he grows feebler day by day, 
and is evidently failing and fading from our 
sight. He gets some sleep, has a pretty good 
appetite, reads at intervals, takes notes of his 
readings, and likes to see his friends, conversing, 
however, with difficulty, as his voice partakes of 
his general debility. We had thought this old- 
est inhabitant of our Planet would have chosen to 
stay and see it fairly dismissed into the Chaos (out 
of which he has brought such precious jewels, 
gifts to friends, to mankind generally, diadems 
for fame to coming followers, forgetful of his 
own claims to the honors) before he chose simply 
to withdraw from the spaces and times he has 
adorned with the truth of his genius. But the 
masterly work is nearly done for us here. And 
our woods and fields are sorrowing, though not in 



r.44.] TO DANIEL RICKETSON. 461 

sombre, but in robes of white, so becoming to the 
piety and probity they have known so long, and 
soon are to miss. There has been none such 
since Pliny, and it will be long before there 
comes his like ; the most sagacious and wonder- 
ful Worthy of his time, and a marvel to coming 
ones. 

I write at the suggestion of his sister, who 
thought his friends would like to be informed of 
his condition to the latest date. 

Ever yours and respectfully, 

A. BRONSON ALCOTT. 

The last letter of Henry Thoreau, written by 
the hand of his sister, was sent to Myron Benton, 
a young literary man then living in Dutchess 
County, New York, who had written a grateful 
letter to the author of " Walden" (January 6, 
1862), though quite unacquainted with him. 
Mr. Benton said that the news of Thoreau's ill- 
ness had affected him as if it were that " of 
a personal friend whom I had known a long 
time," and added : " The secret of the influence 
by which your writings charm me is altogether 
as intangible, though real, as the attraction of 
Nature herself. I read and re-read your books 
with ever fresh delight. Nor is it pleasure alone ; 
there is a singular spiritual healthiness with 
which they seem imbued, "-the expression of a 



462 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1862, 

sord essentially sound, so free from any morbid 
tendency." After mentioning that his own home 
was in a pleasant valley, once the hunting-ground 
of the Indians, Mr. Benton said : 

" I was in hope to read something more from 
your pen in Mr. Conway's ' Dial,' 1 but only 
recognized that fine pair of Walden twinlets. 
Of your two books, I perhaps prefer the ' Week,' 
but after all, ' Walden ' is but little less a 
favorite. In the former, I like especially those 
little snatches of poetry interspersed throughout. 
I would like to ask what progress you have made 
in a work some way connected with natural his- 
tory, I think it was on Botany, which Mr. 
Emerson told me something about in a short in- 
terview I had with him two years ago at Pough- 
keepsie. ... If you should feel perfectly able 
at any time to drop me a few lines, I would like 
much to know what your state of health is, and 
if there is, as I cannot but hope, a prospect of 
your speedy recovery." 

Two months and more passed before Thoreau 
replied ; but his habit of performing every duty, 

1 This was a short-lived monthly, edited at Cincinnati (1861- 
62) by Moncure D. Conway, since distinguished as an author, 
who had resided for a time in Concord, after leaving his native 
Virginia. He wrote asking Thoreau and all his Concord 
friends to contribute to this new Dial, and several of them 
did so. 



*r.44.1 TO MYRON B. BENTON. 463 

whether of business or courtesy, would not ex- 
cuse him from an answer, which was this : 

TO MYRON B. BENTON (AT LEEDSVILLE, N. T.). 
CONCORD, March 21, 1862. 

DEAR SIR, I thank you for your very kind 
letter, which, ever since I received it, I have in- 
tended to answer before I died, however briefly. 
I am encouraged to know, that, so far as you are 
concerned, I have not written my books in vain. 
I was particularly gratified, some years ago, when 
one of my friends and neighbors said, " I wish 
you would write another book, write it for 
me." He is actually more familiar with what I 
have written than I am myself. 

The verses you refer to in Conway's " Dial," 
were written by F. B. Sanborn of this town. I 
never wrote for that journal. 

I am pleased when you say that in "The 
Week " you like especially " those little snatches 
of poetry interspersed through the book," for 
these, I suppose, are the least attractive to most 
readers. I have not been engaged in any par- 
ticular work on Botany, or the like, though, if 
I were to live, I should have much to report on 
Natural History generally. 

You ask particularly after my health. I sup- 
pose that I have not many months to live ; but, 
of course, T know nothing alxmt it. I may add 



464 FRIENDS AND FOLLOWERS. [1862. 

that I am enjoying existence as much as ever, 
and regret nothing. 

Yours truly, 

HENRY D. THOREAU, 
by SOPHIA E. THOREAU. 

He died May 6, 1862 ; his mother died March 
12, 1872, and his sister Sophia, October, 1876. 
With the death of his aunt, Maria Thoreau, 
nearly twenty years after her beloved nephew, 
the last person of the name in America (or per- 
haps in England) passed away.
