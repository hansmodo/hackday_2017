</p><p>
MY DEAR LORD, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of January the ipth. You 
have kindly relieved me from the pain I had long been under. 
You are goodness itself. I ought to have answered yours 
of December 25. <a href='/results.php?year=1765'>1765</a>. I never received a letter that 
contained sentiments more suitable to my own. It found 
me under much agitation of mind on the very important 
subject it treated. It fortified me greatly in the judgment I 
was inclined to form (though contrary to the general vogue) 
on the then delicate and critical situation of affairs between 
Great Britain and her Colonies, and on that weighty point, 
their Union. You guessed aright in supposing that I would 
not be a mute in that play. I was extremely busy, attending 
Members of both Houses, informing, explaining, consulting, 
disputing, in a continual hurry from morning to night, till 
the affair was happily ended. During the course of it, being 
called before the House of Commons, I spoke my mind pretty 
freely. Inclosed I send you the imperfect account that was 
taken of that examination. " You will there see how entirely 
we agree, except in a point of fact, of which you could not but 
be misinformed ; the papers at that time being full of mistaken 
assertions, that the colonies had been the cause of the war, 
and had ungratefully refused to bear any part of the expence 
of it. 
</p><p>
I send it you now, because I apprehend some late incidents 
are likely to revive the contest between the two countries. I 
fear it will be a mischievous one. It becomes a matter of 
great importance that clear ideas should be formed on solid 
principles, both in Britain and America, of the true political 
relation between them, and the mutual duties belonging to 
that relation. Till this is done, they will be often jarring. 
I know none whose knowledge, sagacity and impartiality 
qualify him so thoroughly for such a service, as yours do you. 
I wish therefore you would consider it. You may thereby 
be the happy instrument of great good to the nation, and of 
preventing much mischief and bloodshed. I am fully persuaded with you, that a Consolidating Union, by a fair and 
equal representation of all the parts of this empire in Parliament, is the only firm basis on which its political grandeur 
and prosperity can be founded. Ireland once wished it, 
but now rejects it. The time has been, when the colonies 
might have been pleased with it: they are now indifferent 
about it; and if it is much longer delayed, they too will refuse it. But the pride of this people cannot bear the thought 
of it, and therefore it will be delayed. Every man in England seems to consider himself as a piece of a sovereign over 
America; seems to jostle himself into the throne with the 
King, and talks of our subjects in the Colonies. The Parliament cannot well and wisely make laws suited to the Colonies, 
without being properly and truly informed of their circumstances, abilities, temper, &c. This it cannot be, without 
representatives from thence : and yet it is fond of this power, 
and averse to the only means of acquiring the necessary knowledge for exercising it ; which is desiring to be omnipotent, without being omniscient. 
</p><p>
I have mentioned that the contest is likely to be revived. 
It is on this occasion. In the same session with the stamp 
act, an act was passed to regulate the quartering of soldiers 
in America; when the bill was first brought in, it contained 
a clause, empowering the officers to quarter their soldiers in 
private houses : this we warmly opposed, and got it omitted. 
The bill passed, however, with a clause, that empty houses, 
barns, &c., should be hired for them, and that the respective 
provinces where they were should pay the expence and furnish 
firing, bedding, drink, and some other articles to the soldiers 
gratis. There is no way for any province to do this, but 
by the Assembly's making a law to raise the money. The 
Pennsylvanian Assembly has made such a law: the New 
York Assembly has refused to do it: and now all the talk 
here is of sending a force to compel them. 
</p><p>
The reasons given by the Assembly to the Governor, for 
the refusal, are, that they understand the act to mean the 
furnishing such things to soldiers, only while on their march 
through the country, and not to great bodies of soldiers, to 
be fixt as at present, in the province; the burthen in the 
latter case being greater than the inhabitants can bear: 
That it would put it in the power of the Captain- General to oppress the province at pleasure, &c. But there is supposed to be another reason at bottom, which they intimate, 
though they do not plainly express it ; to wit, that it is of the 
nature of an internal tax laid on them by Parliament, which 
has no right so to do. Their refusal is here called Rebellion, 
and punishment is thought of. 
</p><p>
Now waving that point of right, and supposing the Legislatures in America subordinate to the Legislature of Great 
Britain, one might conceive, I think, a power in the superior 
Legislature to forbid the inferior Legislatures making particular laws ; but to enjoin it to make a particular law contrary to its own judgment, seems improper; an Assembly 
or Parliament not being an executive officer of Government, 
whose duty it is, in law-making, to obey orders, but a deliberative body, who are to consider what comes before them, 
its propriety, practicability, or possibility, and to determine 
accordingly : The very nature of a Parliament seems to be 
destroyed, by supposing it may be bound, and compelled 
by a law of a superior Parliament, to make a law contrary to 
its own judgment. 
</p><p>
Indeed, the act of Parliament in question has not, as in 
other acts, when a duty is enjoined, directed a penalty on 
neglect or refusal, and a mode of recovering that penalty. 
It seems, therefore, to the people in America as a mere 
requisition, which they are at liberty to comply with or not, 
as it may suit or not suit the different circumstances of different provinces. Pennsylvania has therefore voluntarily complied. <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as I said before, has refused. The 
Ministry that made the act, and all their adherents, call for 
vengeance. The present Ministry are perplext, and the 
measures they will finally take on the occasion, are yet unknown. But sure I am, that, if Force is used, great mischief 
will ensue; the affections of the people of America to this 
country will be alienated ; your commerce will be diminished ; 
and a total separation of interests be the final consequence. 
</p><p>
It is a common, but mistaken notion here, that the Colonies 
were planted at the expence of Parliament, and that therefore 
the Parliament has a right to tax them, &c. The truth is, 
they were planted at the expence of private adventurers, who 
went over there to settle, with leave of the King, given by 
charter. On receiving this leave, and those charters, the adventurers voluntarily engaged to remain the King's subjects, 
though in a foreign country ; a country which had not been 
conquered by either King or Parliament, but was possessed 
by a free people. 
</p><p>
When our planters arrived, they purchased the lands of 
the natives, without putting King or Parliament to any expence. Parliament had no hand in their settlement, was 
never so much as consulted about their constitution, and took 
no kind of notice of them, till many years after they were 
established. I except only the two modern Colonies, or 
rather attempts to make Colonies, (for they succeed but 
poorly, and as yet hardly deserve the name of Colonies), I 
mean Georgia and Nova Scotia, which have hitherto been 
little better than Parliamentary jobs. Thus all the colonies 
acknowledge the King as their sovereign; his Governors 
there represent his person : Laws are made by their Assemblies or little Parliaments, with the Governor's assent, subject still to the King's pleasure to confirm or annul them: 
Suits arising in the Colonies, and differences between Colony 
and Colony, are determined by the King in Council. In 
this view, they seem so many separate little states, subject 
to the same Prince. The sovereignty of the King is therefore 
easily understood. But nothing is more common here than 
to talk of the sovereignty of PARLIAMENT, and the sovereignty 
of THIS NATION over the Colonies; a kind of sovereignty, 
the idea of which is not so clear, nor does it clearly appear 
on what foundation it is established. On the other hand, it 
seems necessary for the common good of the empire, that a 
power be lodged somewhere, to regulate its general commerce : 
this can be placed nowhere so properly as in the Parliament 
of Great Britain; and therefore, though that power has in 
some instances been executed with great partiality to Britain, 
and prejudice to the Colonies, they have nevertheless always 
submitted to it. Custom-houses are established in all of 
them, by virtue of laws made here, and the duties constantly 
paid, except by a few smugglers, such as are here and in all 
countries; but internal taxes laid on them by Parliament, 
are still and ever will be objected to, for the reasons that you 
will see in the mentioned Examination. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, I have lived so great a part of my life in 
Britain, and have formed so many friendships in it, that I 
love it, and sincerely wish it prosperity ; and therefore wish 
to see that Union, on which alone I think it can be secured 
and established. As to America, the advantages of such a 
union to her are not so apparent. She may suffer at present 
under the arbitrary power of this country; she may suffer 
for a while in a separation from it ; but these are temporary 
evils that she will outgrow. Scotland and Ireland are differently circumstanced. Confined by the sea, they can scarcely 
increase in numbers, wealth and strength, so as to overbalance England. But America, an immense territory, 
favoured by Nature with all advantages of climate, soil, 
great navigable rivers, and lakes, &c. must become a great 
country, populous and mighty ; and will, in a less time than 
is generally conceived, be able to shake off any shackles that 
may be imposed on her, and perhaps place them on the imposers. In the mean time, every act of oppression will sour 
their tempers, lessen greatly, if not annihilate the profits of 
your commerce with them, and hasten their final revolt; 
for the seeds of liberty are universally found there, and nothing can eradicate them. And yet, there remains among 
that people, so much respect, veneration and affection for 
Britain, that, if cultivated prudently, with kind usage, and 
tenderness for their privileges, they might be easily governed 
still for ages, without force, or any considerable expence. 
But I do not see here a sufficient quantity of the wisdom, 
that is necessary to produce such a conduct, and I lament 
the want of it. 
</p><p>
I borrowed at Millar's the new edition of your Principles 
o) Equity, and have read with great pleasure the preliminary 
discourse on the Principles of Morality. I have never before 
met with any thing so satisfactory on the subject. While 
reading it, I made a few remarks as I went along. They are 
not of much importance, but I send you the paper. 
</p><p>
I know the lady you mention ; ' having, when in England 
before, met her once or twice at Lord Bath's. I remember I 
then entertained the same opinion of her that you express. 
On the strength of your kind recommendation, I purpose 
soon to wait on her. 
</p><p>
This is unexpectedly grown a long letter. The visit to 
Scotland, and the Art of Virtue, we will talk of hereafter. It 
is now time to say, that I am, with increasing esteem and 
affection, my dear friend, yours ever, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of December 8th and February 
22d, and thank you for the particular accounts you send me 
of affairs on your side the water, which are very agreeable 
to me to read. 
</p><p>
Here public affairs are in great disorder; a strong opposition against the ministry, which, at the same time, is thought 
not to be well united; and daily apprehensions of new 
changes make it extremely difficult to get forward with business. We must use patience. This satisfaction we have, 
that there is scarce a man of weight, in or out of the ministry, 
that has not now a favourable opinion of the proposed change 
of government in the Proprietary colonies; but during the 
present violent heats, occasioned by some conduct of the 
Assemblies of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and which the opposition aggravate highly in order to distress the friends of 
America in the present ministry, nothing so little interesting 
to them as our application can get forward. 
</p><p>
Your messages on the Circuit-Bill are not yet arrived. 
I much want to see them. 
</p><p>
I send you a little essay of an inscription to the memory 
of my departed, amiable young friend, whose loss I deplore 
with you most sincerely. If it has been long coming to your 
hand, I hope that has occasioned your being furnished with 
another and a better. The style is simple and plain, and 
more proper for such things than affected ornamental expression. 
</p><p>
I am looking out for a chariot for you, which I shall send 
you soon as possible. 
</p><p>
With great esteem, I am, dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of May 16th. I am always 
glad to hear from you, when you have leisure to write, and I 
expect no apologies for your not writing. I wish all correspondence was on the foot of writing and answering when 
one can, or when one is disposed to it, without the compulsions of ceremony. I am pleased with your scheme of a Medical Library at the Hospital; and I fancy I can procure you 
some donations among my medical friends here, if you will 
send me a catalogue of what books you already have. Enclosed I send you the only book of the kind in my possession 
here, having just received it as a present from the author. It 
is not yet published to be sold, and will not be for some time, 
till the second part is ready to accompany it. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your remarks on the gout. They may be 
useful to me, who have already had some touches of that distemper. As to Lord Chatham, it is said that his constitution 
is totally destroyed and gone, partly through the violence of 
the disease, and partly by his own continual quacking with 
it. There is at present no access to him. He is said to be 
not capable of receiving, any more than of giving, advice. 
</p><p>
But still there is such a deference paid to him, that much 
business is delayed on his account, that so when entered on 
it may have the strength of his concurrence, or not be liable 
to his reprehension, if he should recover his ability and 
activity. The ministry, we at present have, has not been 
looked upon, either by itself or others, as settled, which is 
another cause of postponing every thing not immediately 
necessary to be considered. New men, and perhaps new 
measures, are often expected and apprehended, whence 
arise continual cabals, factions, and intrigues among the outs 
and ins, that keep every thing in confusion. And when 
affairs will mend is very uncertain. With great esteem I am, 
dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In my last of May 2Oth, I mentioned my hopes that we 
should at length get over all obstructions to the repeal of the 
act restraining the legal tender of paper money; but those 
hopes are now greatly lessened. 
</p><p>
The ministry had agreed to the repeal, and the notion that 
had possessed them, that they might make a revenue from 
paper money in appropriating the interest by Parliament, was 
pretty well removed by my assuring them, that it was my 
opinion no colony would make money on those terms, and that 
the benefits arising to the commerce of this country in America 
from a plentiful currency would therefore be lost, and the 
repeal answer no end, if the Assemblies were not allowed to 
appropriate the interest themselves; that the crown might 
get a great share upon occasional requisitions, I made no 
doubt, by voluntary appropriations of the Assemblies; but 
they would never establish such funds as to make themselves 
unnecessary to government. Those and other reasons, that 
were urged, seemed to satisfy them, so that we began to think 
all would go on smoothly, and the merchants prepared their 
petition, on which the repeal was to be founded. But in 
the House, when the chancellor of the Exchequer had gone 
through his proposed American revenue, viz. by duties on 
glass, china ware, paper, pasteboard, colours, tea, &c., 
Grenville stood up and undervalued them all as trifles ; and, 
says he, "I will tell the honourable gentleman of a revenue, 
that will produce something valuable in America; make 
paper money for the colonies, issue it upon loan there, take 
the interest, and apply it as you think proper." Mr. Townshend, finding the House listened to this and seemed to like 
it, stood up again and said, "that was a proposition of his 
own, which he had intended to make with the rest, but it had 
slipt his memory, and the gentleman, who must have heard of 
it, now unfairly would take advantage of that slip and make 
a merit to himself of a proposition that was another's, and as 
a proof of it, assured the House a bill was prepared for the 
purpose, and would be laid before them." 
</p><p>
This startled all our friends ; and the merchants concluded 
to keep back their petition for a while, till things appeared a 
little clearer, lest their friends in America should blame them, 
as having furnished foundation for an act, that must have 
been disagreeable to the colonies. I found the rest of the 
ministry did not like this proceeding of the chancellor's, but there was no going on with our scheme against his declaration, and, as he daily talked of resigning, there being no good 
agreement between him and the rest, and as we found the 
general prejudice against the colonies so strong in the House, 
that any thing in the shape of a favour to them all was like 
to meet with opposition, whether he was out or in, I proposed 
to Mr. Jackson the putting our colony foremost, as we stood 
in a pretty good light, and asking the favour for us alone. 
This he agreed might be proper, in case the chancellor should 
go out, and undertook to bring in a bill for that purpose, provided the <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> merchants would petition for it, and 
he wished to have such a petition ready to present, if an opening for it should offer. Accordingly I applied to them, and 
prepared a draft of a petition for them to sign, a copy of which 
I send you inclosed. They seemed generally for the measure ; 
but apprehending the merchants of the other colonies, who 
had hitherto gone hand in hand with us in all American 
affairs, might take umbrage if we now separated from them, 
it was thought right to call a meeting of the whole to consult 
upon this proposal. 
</p><p>
At this meeting I represented to them, as the ground of this 
measure, that, the colonies being generally out of favour at 
present, any hard clause relating to paper money in the repealing bill will be more easily received in Parliament, if the 
bill related to all the colonies : that Pennsylvania, being in 
some degree of favour, might possibly alone obtain a better 
act than the whole could do, as it might by government be 
thought as good policy to show favour where there had been 
the reverse ; that a good act obtained by Pennsylvania might 
another year, when the resentment against the colonies should 
be abated, be made use of as a precedent, &c. &c. But after 
a good deal of debate it was finally concluded not to precipitate matters, it being very dangerous by any kind of petition 
to furnish the chancellor with a horse on which he could put 
what saddle he thought fit: The other merchants seemed 
rather averse to the Pennsylvania merchants proceeding alone, 
but said they were certainly at liberty to do as they thought 
proper. The conclusion of the Pennsylvania merchants was 
to wait a while, holding the separate petition ready to sign 
and present, if a proper opening should appear this session, 
but otherwise to reserve it to the next, when the complexion 
of ministers and measures may probably be changed. And 
as this session now draws to a conclusion, I begin to think 
nothing will be farther done in it this year. 
</p><p>
Mentioning the merchants, puts me in mind of some discourse I heard among them, that was by no means agreeable. 
It was said that in the opposition they gave the Stamp Act, 
and their endeavours to obtain the repeal, they had spent at 
their meetings, and in expresses to all parts of this country, 
and for a vessel to carry the joyful news to North America, 
and in the entertainments given our friends of both Houses, 
&c., near fifteen hundred pounds; that for all this, except 
from the little colony of Rhode Island, they had not received 
as much as a thank ye. That on the contrary the circular 
letters they had written with the best intentions to the merchants of the several colonies, containing their best and most 
friendly advice, were either answered with unkind reflections, 
or contemptuously left without answer. And that the captain 
of the vessel, they sent express with the news, having met with 
misfortunes, that obliged him to travel by land through all 
the colonies from New Hampshire to Pennsylvania, was 
everywhere treated with neglect and contempt, instead of 
</p><p>
civility and hospitality; and nowhere more than at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where, though he delivered letters to the merchants, 
that must make him and his errand known to them, no one 
took the least notice of him. I own I was ashamed to hear 
all this, but hope there is some mistake in it. I should not 
have troubled you with this account, but that I think we stand 
in truth greatly obliged to the merchants, who are a very 
respectable body, and whose friendship is worth preserving, 
as it may greatly help us on future occasions ; and therefore 
I wish some decent acknowledgments or thanks were sent 
from the Assemblies of the colonies, since their correspondents 
have omitted it. 
</p><p>
I have said the less of late in my letters concerning the 
petitions, because I hoped this summer to have an opportunity of communicating every thing vivd, voce, and there are 
particulars that cannot safely be trusted to paper. Perhaps 
I may be more determined as to returning or staying another 
winter, when I receive my next letters from you and my other 
friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
We got the chancellor to drop his salt duty. And the merchants trading to Portugal and Spain, he says, have made 
such a clamour about the intention of suffering ships to go 
directly with wine, fruit, and oil, from those countries to 
America, that he has dropped that scheme, and we are it 
seems to labour a little longer under the inconveniences of 
the restraint. 
</p><p>
It is said the bill to suspend the legislatures of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> 
and Georgia, till they comply with the act of Parliament for 
quartering soldiers, will pass this session. ] fear that imprudencies on both sides may, step by step, bring on the most 
mischievous consequences. It is imagined here, that this 
act will enforce immediate compliance; and if the people 
should be quiet, content themselves with the laws they have, 
and let the matter rest, till in some future war the King wanting aids from them, and finding himself restrained in his legislation by the act as much as the people, shall think fit by his 
ministers to propose the repeal, the Parliament will be greatly 
disappointed; and perhaps it may take this turn. I wish 
nothing worse may happen. 
</p><p>
The present ministry will probably continue through this 
session. But their disagreement, with the total inability of 
Lord Chatham, through sickness, to do any business, must 
bring on some change before next winter. I wish it may be 
for the better, but fear the contrary. 
</p><p>
Please to present my dutiful respects to the Assembly, and 
believe me ever, dear Sir, your and the Committee's most 
</p><p>
obedient and faithful humble servant,

WE were greatly disappointed yesterday, that we had not 
the Pleasure, promised us, of our dear Polly's Company. 
Your good Mother would have me write a Line in Answer to 
your Letter. A Muse, you must know, visited me this Morning! I see you are surpriz'd, as I was. I never saw one 
before. And shall never see another. So I took the Opportunity of her Help to put the Answer into Verse, because I 
was some Verse in your Debt ever since you sent me the last 
Pair of Garters. 
</p><p>
This Muse appeared to be no Housewife. I suppose few 
of them are. She was drest (if the Expression is allowable) 
in an Undress, a kind of slatternly Negligee, neither neat nor 
clean, norwell made ; and she has given the same sort of Dress 
to my Piece. On reviewing it, I would have reform'd the 
Lines, and made them all of a Length, as I am told Lines 
ought to be ; but I find I can't lengthen the short ones without 
stretching them on the Rack, and I think it would be equally 
cruel to cut off any Part of the long ones. Besides the Superfluity of these makes up for the Deficiency of those; and so, 
from a Principle of Justice, I leave them at full Length, that 
I may give you, at least in one Sense of the Word, good 
Measure. Adieu, my dear good Girl, and believe me ever 
your affectionate, faithful Friend,

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
Capt. Falkener is arrived, and came yesterday to see me, 
and bring my Letters. I was extreamly glad of yours, because 
I had none by the Packet. It seems now as if I should stay 
here another Winter, and therefore I must leave it to your 
Judgment to act in the Affair of your Daughter's Match, as 
shall seem best. If you think it a suitable one, I suppose the 
sooner it is compleated the better. In that case, I would 
only advise that you do not make an expensive feasting 
Wedding, but conduct every thing with Frugality and (Economy, which our Circumstances really now require to be observed in all our Expences : For since my Partnership with 
Mr. Hall is expired, a great Source of our Income is cut off; 
and if I should lose the PostOffice, which among the many 
Changes here is far from being unlikely, we should be reduc'd 
to our Rents and Interest of Money for a Subsistence, which 
will by no means afford the chargeable Housekeeping and 
Entertainments we have been used to ; for my own Part I 
live here as frugally as possible not to be destitute of the Comforts of Life, making no Dinners for anybody, and contenting 
myself with a single Dish when I dine at home ; and yet such 
is the Dearness of Living here in every Article, that my 
Expences amaze me. I see too by the Sums you have received in my Absence, that yours are very great, and I am 
very sensible that your Situation naturally brings you a great 
many Visitors, which occasion an Expence not easily to be 
avoided especially when one has been long in the Practice and 
Habit of it : But when People's Incomes are lessened, if 
they cannot proportionably lessen their Outgoings, they must 
come to Poverty. If we were young enough to begin Business 
again, it might be another Matter ; but I doubt we are past 
it ; and Business not well managed ruins one faster than no 
Business. In short, with Frugality and prudent Care we 
may subsist decently on what we have, and leave it entire to 
our Children : but without such Care, we shall not be able 
to keep it together ; it will melt away like Butter in the Sunshine; and we may live long enough to feel the miserable 
Consequences of our Indiscretion. 
</p><p>
I know very little of the Gentleman l or his Character, nor 
can I at this Distance. I hope his Expectations are not great 
of any Fortune to be had with our Daughter before our Death. 
I can only say, that if he proves a good Husband to her, and a 
good Son to me, he shall find me as good a Father as I can 
be: but at present I suppose you would agree with me, 
that we cannot do more than fit her out handsomely in Cloaths 
and Furniture, not exceeding in the whole Five Hundred 
Pounds, of Value. For the rest, they must depend as you 
and I did, on their own Industry and Care : as what remains 
in our Hands will be barely sufficient for our Support, and 
not enough for them when it comes to be divided at our 
Decease. 
</p><p>
Having lately bought a Piece of fine Pocket Handkerchiefs, 
I send you 4 of them, being Half the Piece ; and shall look 
out for the Quilts you mention, that is, Mrs. Stevenson will, 
and for the Muff & Snail for Sally. None of the things are 
yet come on shore. 
</p><p>
I send you the little Shade that was copied from the great 
one. If it will be acceptable to my good Friend Mr. Roberts, 
pray give it to him. Our Polly's Match is quite broke off. 
The Difference was about Money-Matters. I am not displeas'd at it, as I did not much like the Man, thinking him a 
mean-spirited mercenary Fellow, and not worthy so valuable 
a Girl as she is in every Respect, Person, Fortune, Temper 
and excellent Understanding. 
</p><p>
Sally Franklin is well; her Father who had not seen her 
for a twelvemonth, came lately & took her home with him 
for a few Weeks to see her Friends ; he is very desirous I 
should take her with me to America. 
</p><p>
I suppose the blue Room is too blue, the wood being of the 
same Colour with the Paper, and so looks too dark. I would 
have you finish it as soon as you can, thus. Paint the Wainscot a dead white; Paper the Walls blue, & tack the gilt 
Border round just above the Surbase and under the Cornish. 
If the Paper is not equal Coloured when pasted on, let it be 
brush'd over again with the same Colour: and let the 
Papitr machie musical Figures be tack'd to the middle of the 
Cieling; when this is done, I think it will look very well. 
</p><p>
Who is the Mrs. Morris you mention, as Mother to Dr. Rush ? I am glad my Recommendations were of any Service to him. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that Sally keeps up and increases the 
Number of her Friends. The best Wishes of a fond Father 
for her Happiness always attend her. I am, my dear Debby, 
</p><p>
your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>

DEAR FRIEND : I have heard of an account you lately received from Russia of some discovery of an ancient sepulchre 
in the frontiers of that country. I wish I could see that account. In the meantime I send you a passage I have met 
with in Herodotus, that most ancient historian, concerning 
the sepulchres of the Scythian kings, which may possibly 
throw some light on this discovery. The Boristhenes, you 
know, is a river that takes its rise in the north, and empties 
itself into the Euxine Sea. I am, as ever yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
The Sepulchres of the Scythian kings are in the country of 
the Gerrhians, where the Borysthenes is first known to be 
navigable. When their king dies, they dig a great hole in the 
ground, of a quadrangular form, and having received the 
body covered with wax, they open and cleanse the belly, filling the space with bruised cypress, incense, seeds of parsley, 
and aries. And after they have sewed up the belly again, 
they carry the body in a chariot to another province ; where, 
those who receive it imitate the royal Scythians in the following custom: They cut off part of one ear: shave their 
heads: wound themselves on the arms, forehead, and nose; 
and pierce the left hand with an arrow. Having done thus, 
they accompany the chariot to another district; and this 
manner is observed in every province ; till having carried the 
dead body of the king through all his dominions, they bury 
him in the country of the Gerrhians, who inhabit the remotest 
parts of the kingdom. Here they lay him in the sepulchre, 
upon a bed encompassed on all sides with spears, which they 
cover with timber, and spread a canopy over the whole monument. In the spaces that remain vacant, they place one of 
the king's concubines strangled; with a cup-bearer, a cook, 
a groom, a waiter, a messenger, certain horses, and some of 
all things necessary. To these they add cups of gold, because 
silver and brass are not used amongst them. This done, 
they throw up the earth with great diligence, and endeavor 
to raise the mount as high as possibly they can. Herodotus, Book IV.

DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I should sooner have answered your kind letter of last year, 
but postponed it from time to time, having mislaid the print 
</p><p>
I intended to send you, which I have now found and send 
herewith. I am glad to hear of the welfare of yourself and 
your family, which I hope will long continue. My love 
to them all. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure whenever I find that my endeavours 
to serve America are acceptable to my friends there. Your 
kind notices of them are very obliging. 
</p><p>
I find here but two of our relations remaining, that bear 
the name of Franklin, viz. Thomas Franklin of Lutterworth in 
Leicestershire, a dyer, and his daughter Sally Franklin, about 
fourteen years of age, who has been with me in London about 
a year, and sends her duty to you. Thomas Franklin is the 
grandson of John Franklin, your grandfather's brother. 
There are besides still living, Eleanor Morris, an old maiden 
lady, daughter of your grandfather's sister Hannah ; and also 
Hannah Walker, granddaughter of his brother John. Mrs. 
Walker has three sons. She lives at Westbury, in Buckinghamshire, and Mrs. Morris with her. And these are the 
whole. It is thought best by my friends that I should continue here another winter. My best wishes attend you, being 
jour affectionate kinsman, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

REV D AND DEAR SIR, Last night I received a letter 
from D r Robertson, acquainting me that the University of 
Edinburgh have on my recommendation conferred the degree 
of D r in Divinity upon the Rev d M r Cooper of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; an 
event, that when I last had the pleasure of seeing you, you 
may remember I was desirous of waiting for, before I should 
be concerned in any new application of the same kind. And 
indeed as I have made three already, I begin to feel a little 
unwilling to apply again immediately to the same University in 
favour of another, lest they should think me troublesome, tho' 
they have hitherto been very obliging. And recollecting that 
you mentioned your having a correspondence with the Principal of the College at Glasgow, I now purpose applying to 
that University for Mr Elliot's l degree, if you approve of it, 
and will with Mr Radcliffe address your recommendation 
to the same place, to accompany mine. Please to present 
my respectful compliments to Mrs Price and Mrs Barker; 
and believe me, with sincere esteem, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient, humble servant,

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have now before me all your late Letters, and shall answer 
them Article by Article. 
</p><p>
Captain Ourry din'd here a few Days since, and thanks you 
for remembring him, desiring his Respects to you and Sally, 
Mr. Strahan & Family, the same. I received the Bill sent 
by Mr. Potts, and suppose it will be duly paid. You will return him the Overplus. I wish I could take my Passage 
this time with Capt. Falkener. I was on board the other day 
with Mr. and Mrs. West, Mrs. Stevenson and Mr. Hopkinson, 
to drink Tea. 'Tis a fine Ship, and I think it not unlikely 
that I may go with him next time, as he is a very kind, good 
Friend whom I much respect. 
</p><p>
The Nocake proves very good, and I thank you for it. 
</p><p>
I am glad you go sometimes to Burlington. The Harmony 
you mention in our Family and among our Children gives me 
great Pleasure. I am sorry to hear of the Death of our old 
Friend Debbey Norris. She was a worthy good Woman, and 
will be miss'd. If I can in any shape be of Service to Mr. Francis, you may depend I shall do it, being much concern'd 
for his Misfortune. I am told the Affair is like to turn out 
better for him than was expected. I will have the Shades done 
as you desire. Sally Franklin is now in the Country with her 
Father. She is an only Child, and a very good Girl. 
</p><p>
I think you would like her, and her Father wishes I would 
take her over with me ; but I object to it, as the Care of educating other People's Children is a Trust too weighty for us 
as we grow old. He is still a Widower, & is between 40 & 
50. His Name is Thomas Franklin; how came you to call 
him Billy Franklin ? 
</p><p>
I receiv'd the Watch-Chain, which you say you send to be 
put to rights. I do not see what it wants. Mrs. Stevenson 
says it is too old-fashion 'd for Sally, and advises sending the 
Watch also, to be chang'd away for a new Watch & Chain. 
</p><p>
In your last Letters you say nothing concerning Mr. Bache. 
The Misfortune that has lately happened to his Affairs, tho' 
it may not lessen his Character as an honest or a Prudent 
man, will probably induce him to forbear entering hastily into 
a State that must require a great Addition to his Expence, 
when he will be less able to supply it. If you think that in 
the mean time it will be some Amusement to Sally to visit her 
Friends here and return with me, I should have no Objection 
to her coming over with Capt. Falkener, provided Mrs. 
Falkener comes at the same time as is talk'd of. I think too 
it might be some Improvement to her. I am at present 
meditating a Journey somewhere, perhaps to Bath & Bristol ; 
as I begin to find a little Giddiness in my head, a token that 
I want the Exercise I have yearly been accustomed to. I 
long to see you & be with you, being as ever, my dear Debby, 
your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I return you many thanks for the box of elephants' tusks 
and grinders. They are extremely curious on many accounts ; 
no living elephants having been seen in any part of America 
by any of the Europeans settled there, or remembered in any 
tradition of the Indians. It is also puzzling to conceive what 
should have brought so many of them to die on the same spot ; 
and that no such remains should be found in any other part 
of the continent, except in that very distant country, Peru, from whence some grinders of the same kind formerly brought, 
are now in the museum of the Royal Society. The tusks 
agree with those of the African and Asiatic elephant in being 
nearly of the same form and texture, and some of them, notwithstanding the length of time they must have lain, being 
still good ivory. But the grinders differ, being full of knobs, 
like the grinders of a carnivorous animal ; when those of the 
elephant, who eats only vegetables, are almost smooth. But 
then we know of no other animal with tusks like an elephant, 
to whom such grinders might belong. 
</p><p>
It is remarkable, that elephants now inhabit naturally 
only hot countries where there is no winter, and yet these 
remains are found in a winter country ; and it is no uncommon thing to find elephants' tusks in Siberia, in great quantities, when their rivers overflow, and wash away the earth, 
though Siberia is still more a wintry country than that on the 
Ohio; which looks as if the earth had anciently been in 
another position, and the climates differently placed from 
what they are at present. 
</p><p>
With great regard, I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have before me your favours of April 23, May 21 and 26. 
The confusion among our great men still continues as much 
as ever, and a melancholy thing it is to consider, that, instead 
of employing the present leisure of peace in such measures 
as might extend our commerce, pay off our debts, secure allies, 
and increase the strength and ability of the nation to support 
a future war, the whole seems to be wasted in party contentions about places of power and profit, in court intrigues 
and cabals, and in abusing one another. 
</p><p>
There has lately been an attempt to make a kind of coalition 
of parties in a new ministry, but it fell through, and the present set is like to continue for some time longer, which I am 
rather pleased with, as some of those who were proposed to 
be introduced are professed adversaries to America, which 
is now made one of the distinctions of party here ; those who 
have in the two last sessions shown a disposition to favour 
us, being called by way of reproach, Americans; while the 
others, adherents to Grenville and Bedford, value themselves on being true to the interests of Britain, and zealous for 
maintaining its dignity and sovereignty over the colonies. 
</p><p>
This distinction will, it is apprehended, be carried much 
higher in the next session, for the political purpose of influencing the ensuing election. It is already given out that the 
compliance of <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, in providing for the quarters, without taking notice of its being done in obedience to the act 
of Parliament, is evasive and unsatisfactory. That it is high 
time to put the right and power of this country to tax the colonies out of dispute, by an act of taxation, effectually carried 
into execution, and that all the colonies should be obliged 
explicitly to acknowledge that right. Every step is taking to 
render the taxing America a popular measure here, by continually insisting on the topics of our wealth and flourishing 
circumstances, while this country is loaded with debt, great 
part of it incurred on our account, the distress of the poor here 
by the multitude and weight of taxes, &c. &c. ; and though 
the traders and manufacturers may possibly be kept in our 
interest, the idea of an American tax is very pleasing to the 
landed men, who therefore readily receive and propagate 
these sentiments wherever they have influence. 
</p><p>
If such a bill should be brought in, it is hard to say what 
would be the event of it, or what would be the effects. Those 
who oppose it, though they should be strong enough to throw 
it out, would be stigmatized as Americans, betrayers of Old 
England, &c., and perhaps, our friends by this means being 
excluded, a majority of our adversaries may get in, and then 
the act infallibly passes the following session. To avoid the 
danger of such exclusion, perhaps little opposition will be 
given, and then it passes immediately. I know not what to 
advise on this occasion, but that we should all do our endeavours on both sides the water to lessen the present unpopularity of the American cause, conciliate the affections of 
people here towards us, increase by all possible means the 
number of our friends, and be careful not to weaken their 
hands and strengthen those of our enemies, by rash proceedings on our side, the mischiefs of which are inconceivable. 
Some of our friends have thought that a publication of my 
Examination here, might answer some of the above purposes, 
by removing prejudices, refuting falsehoods, and demonstrating our merits with regard to this country. It is accordingly 
printed, and has a great run. I have another piece in hand, 
which I intend to put out about the time of the meeting of 
Parliament, if those I consult with shall judge that it may be 
of service. 
</p><p>
The next session of Parliament will probably be a short 
one, on account of the following election. And I am now 
advised by some of our great friends here to see that out, not 
returning to America till the spring. My presence indeed 
is necessary there to settle some private affairs. Unforeseen 
and unavoidable difficulties have hitherto obstructed our 
proceedings in the main intent of my coming over, and perhaps (though I think my being here has not been altogether 
unserviceable) our friends in the Assembly may begin to be 
discouraged and tired of the expense. If that should be the 
case, I would not have you propose to continue me as agent at 
the meeting of the new Assembly: my endeavours to serve 
the province, in what I may while I remain here, shall not be 
lessened by that omission. 
</p><p>
I am glad you have made a trial of paper money, not a legal 
tender. The quantity being small, may perhaps be kept in 
full credit notwithstanding ; and if that can be avoided, I am 
not for applying here again very soon for a repeal of the restraining act. I am afraid an ill use will be made of it. The 
plan of our adversaries is to render Assemblies in America 
useless ; and to have a revenue independent of their grants, 
for all the purposes of their defence, and supporting governments among them. It is our interest to prevent this. And, 
that they may not lay hold of our necessities for paper money, 
to draw a revenue from that article, whenever they grant us 
the liberty we want, of making it a legal tender, I wish some 
other method may be fallen upon of supporting its credit. 
What think you of getting all the merchants, traders, and 
principal people of all sorts, to join in petitions to the Assembly for a moderate emission, the petition being accompanied 
with a mutual engagement to take it in all dealings at the rates 
fixed by law? Such an engagement had a great effect in 
fixing the value and rates of our gold and silver. Or, perhaps, 
a bank might be established that would answer all purposes. 
Indeed I think with you, that those merchants here, who have 
made difficulties on the subject of the legal tender, have not 
understood their own interest. For there can be no doubt, 
that should a scarcity of money continue among us, we shall 
take off less of their merchandise, and attend more to manufacturing, and raising the necessaries and superfluities of life 
among ourselves, which we now receive from them. And 
perhaps this consequence would attend our making no paper 
money at all of any sort, that being thus by want of cash 
driven to industry and frugality, we should gradually become 
more rich without their trade, than we can possibly be with 
it, and, by keeping in the country the real cash that comes 
into it, have in time a quantity sufficient for all our occasions. 
But I suppose our people will scarce have patience to wait for 
this. 
</p><p>
I have received the printed votes, but not the laws. I hear 
nothing yet of any objection made by the Proprietaries to any 
of them at the Board of Trade. 
</p><p>
Please to present my duty to the Assembly, with thanks for 
their care of me, and assure them of my most faithful services. 
With sincerest esteem and respect, I am, my dear friend, 
yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I have no letter of yours since my last, in which I answered all preceding ones. 
</p><p>
Last week I dined at Lord Shelburne's, and had a long 
conversation with him and Mr. Conway (there being no other 
company) on the subject of reducing American expense. 
They have it in contemplation to return the management of 
Indian affairs into the hands of the several provinces on which 
the nations border, that the colonies may bear the charge of 
treaties, &c., which they think will then be managed more 
frugally, the treasury being tired with the immense drafts of 
the superintendants, &c. I took the opportunity of urging 
it as one means of saving expense in supporting the out-posts, 
that a settlement should be made in the Illinois country; 
expatiated on the various advantages, viz. furnishing provisions cheaper to the garrisons, securing the country, retaining the trade, raising a strength there which on occasion 
of a future war, might easily be poured down the Mississippi 
upon the lower country, and into the Bay of Mexico, to be 
used against Cuba or Mexico itself. I mentioned your plan, 
its being approved by Sir William Johnson, the readiness and 
ability of the gentlemen concerned to carry the settlement 
into execution, with very little expense to the crown, &c. 
The secretaries appeared finally to be fully convinced, and 
there remained no obstacle but the Board of Trade, which 
was to be brought over privately, before the matter should be 
referred to them officially. In case of laying aside the superintendants, a provision was thought of for Sir William 
Johnson. 
</p><p>
We had a good deal of farther discourse on American 
affairs, particularly on paper money: Lord Shelburne declared himself fully convinced of the utility of taking off the 
restraint, by my answer to the Report of the Board of Trade. 
General Conway had not seen it, and desired me to send it to 
him, which I did next morning. They gave me expectation 
of a repeal next session, Lord Clare being come over: but 
they said there was some difficulty with others at the Board, 
who had signed that Report; for there was a good deal in 
what Soame Jenyns had laughingly said, when asked to concur in some measure, / have no kind of objection to it, provided we have heretofore signed nothing to the contrary. 
</p><p>
In this conversation I did not forget our main Pennsylvania business, and I think made some farther progress, 
though but little. The two secretaries seemed intent upon 
preparing business for next Parliament, which makes me 
think, that the late projects of changes are now quite over, 
and that they expect to continue in place. But whether they 
will do much or little, I cannot say. 
</p><p>
Du Guerchy, the French ambassador, is gone home, and 
Monsieur Durand is left minister plenipotentiary. He is 
extremely curious to inform himself in the affairs of America ; 
pretends to have a great esteem for me, on account of the 
abilities shown in my examination; has desired to have all 
my political writings, invited me to dine with him, was very 
inquisitive, treated me with great civility, makes me visits, 
&c. I fancy that intriguing nation would like very well to 
meddle on occasion, and blow up the coals between Britain 
and her colonies; but I hope we shall give them no opportunity. 
</p><p>
I write this in a great hurry, being setting out in an hour 
on another journey with my steady, good friend, Sir John 
Pringle. We propose to visit Paris. Durand has given me 
letters of recommendation to the Lord knows who. I am 
told I shall meet with great respect there ; but winds change, 
and perhaps it will be full as well if I do not. We shall be 
gone six weeks. I have a little private commission to transact, of which more another time. 
</p><p>
Communicate nothing of this letter but privately to our 
friend Galloway. I am your affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I am always pleas'd with a Letter from you, and I flatter 
myself you may be sometimes pleas'd in receiving one from 
me, tho' it should be of little Importance, such as this, which 
is to consist of a few occasional Remarks made here, and in 
my Journey hither. 
</p><p>
Soon after I left you in that agreable Society at Bromley, 
I took the Resolution of making a Trip with Sir John Pringle 
into France. We set out the 28th past. All the way to 
Dover we were furnished with PostChaises, hung so as to 
lean forward, the Top coming down over one's Eyes, like a 
Hood, as if to prevent one's seeing the Country ; which being 
one of my great Pleasures, I was engaged in perpetual Disputes with the Innkeepers, Hostlers, and Postilions, about 
getting the Straps taken up a Hole or two before, and let 
down as much behind, they insisting that the Chaise leaning 
forward was an Ease to the Horses, and that the contrary 
would kill them. I suppose the chaise leaning forward looks 
to them like a Willingness to go forward, and that its hanging 
back shows a Reluctance. They added other Reasons, that 
were no Reasons at all, and made me, as upon a 100 other 
Occasions, almost wish that Mankind had never been endowed 
with a reasoning Faculty, since they know so little how to 
make use of it, and so often mislead themselves by it, and that 
they had been furnish'd with a good sensible Instinct instead of it. 
</p><p>
At Dover, the next Morning, we embark'd for Calais with 
a Number of Passengers, who had never been before at sea. 
They would previously make a hearty Breakfast, because, 
if the Wind should fail, we might not get over till Supper 
time. Doubtless they thought that when they had paid for 
their Breakfast, they had a Right to it, and that, when they 
had swallowed it they were sure of it. But they had scarce 
been out half an Hour, before the Sea laid Claim to it, and 
they were obliged to deliver it up. So it seems there are 
Uncertainties, even beyond those between the Cup and the 
Lip. If ever you go to Sea, take my Advice, and live sparingly a Day or two beforehand. The Sickness, if any, will 
be lighter and sooner over. We got to Calais that Evening. 
</p><p>
Various Impositions we suffered from Boatmen, Porters, &c. 
on both Sides the Water. I know not which are most rapacious, the English or French, but the latter have, with their 
Knavery, the most Politeness. 
</p><p>
The Roads we found equally good with ours in England, 
in some Places pav'd with smooth Stone, like our new Streets, 
for many Miles together, and Rows of Trees on each Side, 
and yet there are no Turnpikes. But then the poor Peasants 
complained to us grievously, that they were obliged to work 
upon the Roads full two Months in the Year, without being 
paid for their Labour. Whether this is Truth, or whether, 
like Englishmen, they grumble Cause or no Cause, I have 
not yet been able fully to inform myself. 
</p><p>
The Women we saw at Calais, on the Road, at Bouloigne, 
and in the Inns and Villages, were generally of dark Complexions; but arriving at Abbeville we found a sudden Change, a Multitude of both Women and Men in that Place 
appearing remarkably fair. Whether this is owing to a small 
Colony of Spinners, Wool-combers, and Weavers, brought 
hither from Holland with the Woollen Manufacture about 
60 Years ago ; or to their being less expos'd to the Sun, than 
in other Places, their Business keeping them much within 
Doors, I know not. Perhaps as in some other Cases, different Causes may club in producing the Effect, but the Effect 
itself is certain. Never was I in a Place of greater Industry, 
Wheels and Looms going in every House. 
</p><p>
As soon as we left Abbeville, the Swarthiness returned. 
I speak generally, for here are some fair Women at Paris, 
who I think are not whiten'd by Art. As to Rouge, they 
don't pretend to imitate Nature in laying it on. There is 
no gradual Diminution of the Colour, from the full Bloom 
in the Middle of the Cheek to the faint Tint near the Sides, 
nor does it show itself differently in different Faces. I have 
not had the Honour of being at any Lady's Toylette to see 
how it is laid on, but I fancy I can tell you how it is or may be 
done. Cut a Hole of 3 Inches Diameter in a Piece of Paper ; 
place it on the Side of your Face in such a Manner as that 
the Top of the Hole may be just under your Eye ; then with 
a Brush dipt in the Colour, paint Face and Paper together; 
so when the Paper is taken off there will remain a round 
Patch of Red exactly the Form of the Hole. This is the Mode, 
from the Actresses on the Stage upwards thro' all Ranks of 
Ladies to the Princesses of the Blood, but it stops there, the 
Queen not using it, having in the Serenity, Complacence, and 
Benignity that shine so eminently in, or rather through her 
Countenance, sufficient Beauty, tho' now an old Woman, 
to do extreamly well without it. 
</p><p>
You see I speak of the Queen as if I had seen her, and so I 
have; for you must know I have been at Court. We went 
to Versailles last Sunday, and had the Honour of being presented to the King; he spoke to both of us very graciously 
and chearfully, is a handsome Man, has a very lively Look, 
and appears younger than he is. In the Evening we were 
at the Grand Convert, where the Family sup in Publick. 
The Form of their Sitting at the Table was this: The table 
was as you see half a Hollow Square, the Service Gold. 
When either made a Sign for Drink, the Word was given by 
one of the Waiters ; A boire pour le Roy, or, A boire pour la 
Reine. Then two persons within the Square approached, one 
with Wine the other with Water in Caraftes; each drank a 
little Glass of what he brought, and then put both the Carajfes 
with a Glass on a Salver, and presented it. Their Distance 
from each other was such, as that other Chairs might have 
been plac'd between any two of them. An Officer of the 
Court brought us up thro 7 the Crowd of Spectators, and 
plac'd Sir John so as to stand between the King and Madame 
Adelaide, and me between the Queen and Madame Victoire. 
The King talk'd a good deal to Sir John, asking many Questions about our Royal Family; and did me too the Honour 
of taking some Notice of me; that's saying enough, for I 
would not have you think me so much pleas'd with this King 
and Queen, as to have a Whit less regard than I us'd to have 
for ours. No Frenchman shall go beyond me in thinking 
my own King and Queen the very best in the World, and the 
most amiable. 
</p><p>
Versailles has had infinite Sums laid out in building it 
and supplying it with Water. Some say the Expences 
exceeded 80 Millions Sterling. The Range of Building is 
immense ; the Garden-Front most magnificent, all of hewn 
Stone ; the Number of Statues, Figures, Urns, &c., in Marble 
and Bronze of exquisite Workmanship, is beyond Conception. But the Waterworks are out of Repair, and so is great 
Part of the Front next the Town, looking with its shabby 
half-Brick Walls, and broken Windows, not much better 
than the Houses in Durham Yard. There is, in short, 
both at Versailles and Paris, a prodigious Mixture of 
Magnificence and Negligence, with every kind of Elegance 
except that of Cleanliness, and what we call Tidyness. Tho' 
I must do Paris the Justice to say, that in two Points of 
Cleanliness they exceed us. The Water they drink, tho' 
from the River, they render as pure as that of the best Spring, 
by filtring it thro' Cisterns filPd with Sand ; and the Streets 
by constant Sweeping are fit to walk in, tho' there is no 
pav'd footPath. Accordingly, many well-dress'd People are 
constantly seen walking in them. The Crowds of Coaches 
and Chairs for this Reason is not so great. Men, as well as 
Women, carry Umbrellas in their Hands, which they extend 
in case of Rain or two (sic) much sun ; and a Man with an 
Umbrella not taking up more than 3 foot square, or 9 square 
feet of the Street, when, if in a Coach, he would take up 
240 square feet, you can easily conceive that tho' the Streets 
here are narrower they may be much less encumbered. They 
are extreamly well pav'd, and the Stones, being generally 
Cubes, when worn on one Side, may be turn'd and become new. 
</p><p>
The Civilities we everywhere receive give us the strongest 
Impressions of the French Politeness. It seems to be a 
Point settled here universally, that Strangers are to be treated 
with Respect; and one has just the same Deference shewn 
one here by being a Stranger, as in England by being a Lady. 
The Customhouse Officers at Port St. Denis, as we enter'd 
Paris, were about to seize 2 doz of excellent Bordeaux Wine 
given us at Boulogne, and which we brought with us; but, 
as soon as they found we were Strangers, it was immediately 
remitted on that Account. At the Church of Notre Dame, 
where we went to see a magnificent Illumination, with 
Figures, &c., for the deceased Dauphiness, we found an immense Crowd, who were kept out by Guards ; but, the Officer 
being told that we were Strangers from England, he immediately admitted us, accompanied and show'd us every 
thing. Why don't we practise this Urbanity to Frenchmen ? 
Why should they be allowed to outdo us in any thing? 
</p><p>
Here is an Exhibition of Paintings like ours in London,, 
to which Multitudes flock daily. I am not Connoisseur 
enough to judge which has most Merit. Every Night, 
Sundays not excepted here are Plays or Operas; and tho' 
the Weather has been hot, and the Houses full, one is not 
incommoded by the Heat so much as with us in Winter. 
They must have some Way of changing the Air, that we are 
not acquainted with. I shall enquire into it. 
Travelling is one Way of lengthening Life, at least in Appearance. It is but about a Fortnight since we left London, 
but the Variety of Scenes we have gone through makes it 
seem equal to Six Months living in one Place. Perhaps I 
have suffered a greater Change, too, in my own Person, than 
I could have done in Six Years at home. I had not been 
here Six Days, before my Taylor and Perruquier had transform'd me into a Frenchman. Only think what a Figure I 
make in a little Bag- Wig and naked Ears ! They told me 
I was become 20 Years younger, and look'd very galante; 
</p><p>
So being in Paris where the Mode is to be sacredly follow'd I was once very near making Love to my Friend's Wife. 
</p><p>
This Letter shall cost you a Shilling, and you may consider it cheap, when you reflect, that it has cost me at least 
50 Guineas to get into the Situation, that enables me to 
write it. Besides, I might, if I had staied at home, have 
won perhaps two Shillings of you at Cribbidge. By the Way, 
now I mention Cards, let me tell you that Quadrille is quite 
out of Fashion here, and English Whisk all the Mode at 
Paris and the Court. 
</p><p>
And pray look upon it as no small Matter, that surrounded 
as I am by the Glories of this World, and Amusements of all 
Sorts, I remember you and Dolly and all the dear good 
Folks at Bromley. 'Tis true, I can't help it, but must and 
ever shall remember you all with Pleasure. 
</p><p>
Need I add, that I am particularly, my dear good Friend, 
yours most affectionately,

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I think the <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>ers have been very discreet in forbearing to write and publish against the late act of Parliament. I wish the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people had been as quiet, since 
Governor Bernard has sent over all their violent papers to 
the ministry, and wrote them word that he daily expected a 
rebellion. He did indeed afterwards correct this extravagance, by writing again, that he now understood those papers 
were approved but by few, and disliked by all the sober, 
sensible people of the province. A certain noble Lord expressed himself to me with some disgust and contempt of 
Bernard on this occasion, saying he ought to have known his 
people better, than to impute to the whole country sentiments, that perhaps are only scribbled by some madman in 
a garret ; that he appeared to be too fond of contention, and 
mistook the matter greatly, in supposing such letters as he 
wrote were acceptable to the ministry. I have heard nothing 
of the appointment of General Clark to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>; but I 
know he is a friend of Lord Shelburne's, and the same that 
recommended Mr. M'Lean to be his secretary. Perhaps it 
might be talked of in my absence. 
</p><p>
The commissioners for the American Board, went hence 
while I was in France ; you know before this time who they 
are and how they are received, which I want to hear. Mr. Williams, who is gone in some office with them, is brother to 
our cousin Williams of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; but I assure you I had not the 
least share in his appointment ; having, as I told you before, 
carefully kept out of the way of that whole affair. 
</p><p>
As soon as I received Mr. Galloway's, Mr. T. Wharton's, 
and Mr. Croghan's letters on the subject of the boundary, 
I communicated them immediately to Lord Shelburne. He 
invited me the next day to dine with him. Lord Clare was 
to have been there, but did not come. There was nobody 
but Mr. M'Lean. My Lord knew nothing of the boundary's 
having ever been agreed on by Sir William, had sent the letters 
to the Board of Trade, desiring search to be made there for 
Sir William's letters, and ordered Mr. M'Lean to search the 
secretary's office, who found nothing. We had much discourse about it, and I pressed the importance of despatching 
orders immediately to Sir William to complete the affair. 
His Lordship asked who was to make the purchase, that is, 
be at the expense ? I said that if the line included any lands 
within the grants of the charter colonies, they should pay 
the purchase money of such proportion. If any within the 
proprietary grants, they should pay their proportion; but 
that what was within royal governments, where the King 
granted the lands, the crown should pay for that proportion. 
His Lordship was pleased to say he thought this reasonable. 
He finally desired me to go to Lord Clare, as from him, and 
urge the business there, which I undertook to do. 
</p><p>
Among other things at this conversation, we talked of the 
new settlement ; his Lordship told me he had himself drawn 
up a paper of reasons for those settlements, which he laid 
before the King in Council, acquainting them that he did not 
offer them merely as his own sentiments; they were what 
he had collected from General Amherst, Dr. Franklin, and 
Mr. Jackson, three gentlemen that were allowed to be the 
best authorities for any thing that related to America. I 
think he added that the Council seemed to approve of the 
</p><p>
design. I know it was referred to the Board of Trade, who 
I believe have not yet reported on it, and I doubt will report 
against it. My Lord told me one pleasant circumstance, viz. 
that he had shown his paper to the Dean of Gloucester 
(Tucker), to hear his opinion of the matter; who very 
sagaciously remarked, that he was sure that paper was drawn 
up by Dr. Franklin ; he saw him in every paragraph ; adding 
that Dr. Franklin wanted to remove the seat of government to 
America ; that, says he, is his constant plan. 
</p><p>
I waited next morning upon Lord Clare, and pressed the 
matter of the boundary closely upon him. He said they 
could not find they had ever received any letters from Sir 
William concerning this boundary, but were searching farther : 
agreed to the necessity of settling it ; but thought there would 
be some difficulty about who should pay the purchase money ; 
for that this country was already so loaded, it could bear no 
more. We then talked of the new colonies. I found he was 
inclined to think one near the mouth of the Ohio might be of 
use in securing the country, but did not much approve that 
at Detroit. And as to the trade, he imagined it would be of 
little consequence, if we had all the peltry to be purchased 
there, but supposed our traders would sell it chiefly to the 
French and Spaniards, at <a href='/results.php?city=new orleans' rel='city'>New Orleans</a>, as he heard they 
had hitherto done. 
</p><p>
At the same time that we Americans wish not to be judged 
of, in the gross, by particular papers written by anonymous 
scribblers and published in the colonies, it would be well if 
we could avoid falling into the same mistake in America, in 
judging of ministers here by the libels printed against them. 
The inclosed is a very abusive one, in which if there is any 
foundation of truth, it can only be in the insinuation contained 
</p><p>
in the words "after eleven adjournments" that they are too 
apt to postpone business ; but if they have given any occasion 
for this reflection, there are reasons and circumstances that 
may be urged in their excuse. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure to hear that the people of the other 
colonies are not insensible of the zeal with which I occasionally espouse their respective interests, as well as the interests 
of the whole. I shall continue to do so as long as I reside 
here and am able. 
</p><p>
The present ministry seem now likely to continue through 
this session of Parliament; and perhaps if the new Parliament should not differ greatly in complexion from this, they 
may be fixed for a number of years, which I earnestly wish, 
as we have no chance for a better. B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
After the Society was gone, my Lord Moreton said (when 
I offered him the Paper) that it ought to have been deliver'd 
before and read to the Society: he however desir'd me to 
produce it to the Council. There the Reading of it was 
oppos'd, as not being referred to them by the Society. But 
this was at last got over, by Dr. Moreton's proposing that the giving a Medal to Dr. Priestley should be taken into Consideration, and that in order to judge the better of the Propriety of that Proposal, the Paper should be read. It was 
accordingly read. I was then desired as the best Judge present to give my Opinion of the Merit of the Experiments as to 
the Medal ; Which I did in plain Terms, declaring it as my 
judgment that the great Pains and Expence the Doctor had 
been at in making them and the Importance of the Experiments themselves, well deserved that Encouragement from the 
Society ; and that it was a Mark of Distinction justly due to 
so much philosophical Industry and Sagacity. 
</p><p>
One that sat near me, told me he was surpriz'd at the Ace' 
I had given, as he had been assured the Medal was intended 
to be bestow'd on the Doctor only for writing a History which 
was thought wrong, but it now appeared he had made many 
valuable new Experiments, etc. Then a Question arose, how 
far it was proper to give a Medal for Experiments that had 
not been sent to the Society, till they were published; and 
this occasioned a search for Sir Godfrey Copley's Will, which 
could not be found ; but an Agreement was found, recorded 
between the Society and his Executors, that the 5 should 
be given for the best Experiment within the Year, proposed 
and directed to be made by the Society; and made in their 
Presence. This not having been the Practice of late Years, 
it began to be whisper'd that most of the Medals had been 
irregularly given. A subsequent Resolution was, however, 
found to print the Clause of Sir Godfrey Copley's Will in 
every Number of the Transactions, for the Encouragement of 
Foreigners, to endeavour obtaining the Reward, as there was 
reason to fear a Failure of Experiments upon the former Plan. 
</p><p>
By this Time it grew late, and it was concluded that the 
Books should be searched, to find all the Steps that had been 
taken in disposing of this Prize, whether in Money or in 
Medals, from the first instance in <a href='/results.php?year=1717'>1717</a> to the last; with the 
Reasons and Grounds on which the Council had proceeded, 
and that a Copy of that Part of Sir Godfrey's Will should be 
obtained from the Commons ; when at the next Council, the 
Matter might be reconsidered, and the Medal then given to 
Dr. Priestley, if the Council thought fit, and it should be 
found not contrary to the Will so to do. Thus the Business 
ended for that time; and how it will conclude at last seems 
an Uncertainty, for I think some Persons are busy in an 
Opposition to the Measure. But I hope it will end in favour 
of Merit, in which case I think our Friend cannot miss it.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your favours of August 22, September 20, 
and October 8, and within these few days one of February 14, 
recommending Mr. Morgan Edwards and his affair of the 
Rhode Island College, which I shall endeavour to promote, 
deeming the institution one of the most catholic and generous 
of the kind. 
</p><p>
I am inclined to think with you that the small sum you have issued to discharge the public debts only will not be materially 
affected in its credit for want of the legal tender, considering 
especially the present extreme want of money in the province. 
You appear to me to point out the true cause of the General distress, viz. the late luxurious mode of living introduced by 
a too great plenty of cash. It is indeed amazing to consider, 
that we had a quantity sufficient before the war began, and 
that the war added immensely to that quantity, by the sums 
spent among us by the crown, and the paper struck and issued 
in the province ; and now in so few years all the money spent 
by the crown is gone away, and has carried with it all the gold 
and silver we had before, leaving us bare and empty, and at 
the same time more in debt to England than ever we were ! 
But I am inclined to think, that the mere making more money 
will not mend our circumstances, if we do not return to that 
industry and frugality, which were the fundamental causes of 
our former prosperity. I shall nevertheless do my utmost 
this winter to obtain the repeal of the act restraining the legal 
tender, if our friends the merchants think it practicable, and 
will heartily espouse the cause ; and, in truth, they have full 
as much interest in the event as we have. 
</p><p>
The present ministry, it is now thought, are likely to continue at least till a new Parliament ; so that our apprehensions 
of a change, and that Mr. Grenville would come in again, seem 
over for the present. He behaves as if a little out of his head 
on the article of America, which he brings into every debate 
without rhyme or reason, when the matter has not the least 
connection with it; thus at the beginning of this session on 
the debate upon the King's speech, he tired everybody, even 
his friends, with a long harangue about and against America, 
of which there was not a word in the speech. Last Friday he 
</p><p>
produced in the House a late <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette, which he said 
denied the legislative authority of Parliament, was treasonable, rebellious, &c., and moved it might be read, and that 
the House would take cognizance of it, but it being moved on 
the other hand that Mr. G's motion should be postponed to 
that day six months, it was carried without a division: and 
as it is known that this Parliament will expire before that 
time, it was equivalent to a total rejection of the motion. 
The Duke of B. too, it seems, moved in vain for a consideration of this paper in the House of Lords. These are favourable symptoms of the present disposition of Parliament 
towards America, which I hope no conduct of the Americans 
will give just cause of altering. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to present my best respects to the House, and 
believe me with sincere esteem and regard, dear Sir, your 
affectionate friend and most obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of October 18. I had before 
seen with great pleasure your name in the papers as chosen 
for the city of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
The instruction you mention, as proposed by a certain great 
man, was really a wild one. The reasons you made use of 
against it were clear and strong, and could not but prevail. 
It will be time enough to show a dislike to the coalition when it is proposed to us. Meanwhile we have all the advantage 
in the argument of taxation, which our not being represented 
will continue to give us. I think, indeed, that such an event 
is very remote. This nation is indeed too proud to propose 
admitting American representatives into their Parliament; 
and America is not so humble, or so fond of the honour, as to 
petition for it. In matrimonial matches 'tis said, when one 
party is willing the match is half made, but where neither 
party is willing there is no great danger of their coming 
together. And to be sure such an important business would 
never be treated of by agents unimpowered and uninstructed ; 
nor would government here act upon the private opinion of 
agents, which might be disowned by their constituents. 
</p><p>
The present ministry seem now likely to continue through 
this session; and this, as a new election approaches, gives 
them the advantage of getting so many of their friends chosen 
as may give a stability to their administration. I heartily 
wish it, because they are all well disposed towards America. 
</p><p>
With sincere esteem, I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend

</p><p>
DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
The resolutions of the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people concerning trade make a great noise here. Parliament has not yet taken 
notice of them, but the newspapers are in full cry against 
America. Colonel Onslow told me at court last Sunday, 
that I could not conceive how much the friends of America 
were run upon and hurt by them, and how much the Grenvillians triumphed. I have just written a paper for next 
Tuesday's Chronicle to extenuate matters a little. 
</p><p>
Mentioning Colonel Onslow, reminds me of something 
that passed at the beginning of this session in the House 
between him and Mr. Grenville. The latter had been raving 
against America, as traitorous, rebellious, &c., when the 
former, who has always been its firm friend, stood up and 
gravely said, that in reading the Roman history he found it 
was a custom among that wise and magnanimous people, 
whenever the senate was informed of any discontent in the 
provinces, to send two or three of their body into the discontented provinces, to inquire into the grievances complained 
of, and report to the senate, that mild measures might be used 
to remedy what was amiss, before any severe steps were 
taken to enforce obedience. That this example he thought 
worthy of our imitation in the present state of our colonies, 
for he did so far agree with the honourable gentleman, that 
spoke just before him, as to allow there were great discontents 
among them. He should therefore beg leave to move, that 
two or three members of Parliament be appointed to go over 
to New England on this service. And that it might not be 
supposed he was for imposing burthens on others, which he 
would not be willing to bear himself, he did at the same time 
declare his own willingness, if the House should think fit to 
appoint them, to go over thither with that honourable gentleman. Upon this there was a great laugh, which continued 
some time, and was rather increased by Mr. Grenville's 
asking, " Will the gentleman engage, that I shall be safe there ? 
Can I be assured that I shall be allowed to come back again 
to make the report ?" As soon as the laugh was so far subsided as that Mr. Onslow could be heard again, he added, 
"I cannot absolutely engage for the honourable gentleman's 
safe return, but if he goes thither upon this service, I am 
strongly of opinion the event will contribute greatly to the 
future quiet of both countries." On which the laugh was 
renewed and redoubled. 
</p><p>
If our people should follow the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> example in entering 
into resolutions of frugality and industry, full as necessary 
for us as for them, I hope they will among other things give 
this reason, that 'tis to enable them more speedily and effectually to discharge their debts to Great Britain. This will 
soften a little, and at the same time appear honourable and 
like ourselves. 
</p><p>
We have had an ugly affair at the Royal Society lately. 
One Dacosta, a Jew, who, as our clerk, was intrusted with 
collecting our moneys, has been so unfaithful as to embezzle 
near thirteen hundred pounds in four years. Being one of 
the Council this year, as well as the last, I have been employed 
all the last week in attending the inquiry into, and unravelling, 
his accounts, in order to come at a full knowledge of his 
frauds. His securities are bound in one thousand pounds to 
the Society, which they will pay, but we shall probably lose 
the rest. He had this year received twenty-six admission 
payments of twenty-five guineas each, which he did not 
bring to account. 
</p><p>
While attending to this affair, I had an opportunity of looking over the old council-books and journals of the society, 
and, having a curiosity to see how I came in, of which I had 
never been informed, I looked back for the minutes relating 
to it. You must know, it is not usual to admit persons that 
have not requested to be admitted; and a recommendatory 
certificate in favour of the candidate, signed by at least three 
of the members, is by our rule to be presented to the Society, 
expressing that he is desirous of that honour, and is so and so 
qualified. As I never had asked or expected the honour, I was, 
as I said before, curious to see how the business was managed. 
I found that the certificate, worded very advantageously for 
me, was signed by Lord Macclesfield, then President, Lord 
Parker, and Lord Willoughby; that the election was by a 
unanimous vote ; and, the honour being voluntarily conferred 
by the Society, unsolicited by me, it was thought wrong to 
demand or receive the usual fees or composition ; so that my 
name was entered on the list with a vote of council, that I was 
not to pay any thing. And accordingly nothing has ever been 
demanded of me. Those, who are admitted in the common 
way, pay five guineas admission fees, and two guineas and a 
half yearly contribution, or twenty-five guineas down, in lieu 
of it. In my case a substantial favour accompanied the honour.

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
We have had so many alarms of changes, which did not 
take place, that just when I wrote it was thought the ministry 
would stand their ground. However, immediately after, the 
talk was renewed, and it soon appeared that the Sunday 
changes were actually settled. Mr. Con way resigns and Lord 
Weymouth takes his place. Lord Gower is made President 
of the Council in the room of Lord Northington. Lord 
Shelburne is stript of the American business, which is given 
to Lord Hillsborough as secretary of state for America, a 
new distinct department. Lord Sandwich, 'tis said, comes 
into the postoffice in his place. Several of the Bedford 
party are now to come in. 
</p><p>
How these changes may effect us a little time will show. 
Little at present is thought of but elections, which gives me 
hopes that nothing will be done against America this session, 
though the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette had occasioned some heats, and the 
<a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Resolutions a prodigious clamour. I have endeavoured to palliate matters for them as well as I can : I send 
you my manuscript of one paper, though I think you take the 
Chronicle. The editor of that paper, one Jones, seems a 
Grenvillian, or is very cautious, as you will see by his corrections and omissions. He has drawn the teeth and pared the 
nails of my paper, so that it can neither scratch nor bite. It 
seems only to paw and mumble. I send you also two other 
late pieces of mine. There is another which I cannot find. 
I am told there has been a talk of getting me appointed 
under-secretary to Lord Hillsborough ; but with little likelihood, as it is a settled point here, that I am too much of an 
American. I am in very good health, thanks to God : Your 
</p><p>
affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you via <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and have little to add, except to 
acquaint you that some changes have taken place since my 
last, which have not the most promising aspect for America, 
several of the Bedford party being come into employment 
again; a party that has distinguished itself by exclaiming 
against us on all late occasions. Mr. Conway, one of our 
friends, has resigned, and Lord Weymouth takes his place. 
Lord Shelburne, another friend, is stripped of the American 
part of the business of his office, which now makes a distinct 
department, in which Lord Hillsborough is placed. I do not 
think this nobleman in general an enemy to America; but 
in the affair of paper money he was last winter strongly 
against us. 
</p><p>
I did hope I had removed some of his prejudices on that 
head, but am not certain. We have however increased the 
cry for it here, and believe shall attempt to obtain the repeal 
of the act, though the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> Gazette and their resolutions 
about manufactures have hurt us much, having occasioned an 
immense clamour here. I have endeavoured to palliate 
matters for them as well as I can, and hope with some success. 
For having, in a large company in which were some members 
of Parliament, given satisfaction to all, by what I alleged in 
explanation of the conduct of the Americans, and to show 
that they were not quite so unreasonable as they appeared to 
be, I was advised by several present to make my sentiments 
public, not only for the sake of America, but as it would be 
some ease to our friends here, who are triumphed over a 
good deal by our adversaries on the occasion. I have accordingly done it in the inclosed paper. 
</p><p>
I shall write you fully on other subjects very soon. At 
present, I can only add my respects to the Committee, and 
that I am, dear Sir, your faithful humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

SIR 
</p><p>
I sent you sometime since, directed to the Care of M. 
Molini, a Bookseller near the Quay des Augustins a Tooth 
that I mentioned to you when I had the Pleasure of meeting 
with you at the Marquis de Courtanvaux's. It was found 
near the River Ohio in America, about 200 Leagues below 
Fort du Quesne, at what is called the Great Licking Place, 
where the Earth has a Saltish Taste that is agreable to the 
Buffaloes & Deer, who come there at certain Seasons in 
great Numbers to lick the same. At this Place have been 
found the Skeletons of near 30 large Animals supposed to be 
Elephants, several Tusks like those of Elephants, being 
found with these Grinder Teeth Four of these Grinders 
were sent me by the Gentleman 8 who brought them from the 
Ohio to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, together with 4 Tusks, one of which is 6 
Feet long & in the thickest Part near 6 Inches Diameter, 
and also one of the Vertebrae My Lord Shelbourn receiv'd 
at the same time 3 or four of them with a Jaw Bone & one 
or two Grinders remaining in it. Some of Our Naturalists 
here, however, contend, that these are not the Grinders of 
Elephants but of some carnivorous Animal unknown, because such Knobs or Prominences on the Face of the Tooth 
are not to be found on those of Elephants, and only, as they 
say, on those of carnivorous Animals. But it appears to 
me that Animals capable of carrying such large & heavy 
Tusks, must themselves be large Creatures, too bulky to 
have the Activity necessary for pursuing and taking Prey; 
and therefore I am inclin'd to think those Knobs are only a 
small Variety, Animals of the same kind and Name often 
differing more materially, and that those Knobs might be as 
useful to grind the small branches of Trees, as to chaw 
Flesh However I should be glad to have your Opinion, 
and to know from you whether any of the kind have been 
found in Siberia.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I sent you some time since, Priestly's History of Electricity, 
under the Care of Mr. Molini, Bookseller on the Quay des 
Augustins. I hope it got safe to Paris, and that you have 
receiv'd it. I wish the Reading of it may renew your Taste 
for that Branch of Philosophy, which is already so greatly 
indebted to you, as being the first of Mankind, that had the 
Courage to attempt drawing Lightning from the Clouds to 
be subjected to your Experiments.
</p><p>
In our Return home, We were detained a Week at Calais, 
by contrary Winds, and stormy Weather, which was the more 
mortifying to me, when I reflected that I might have enjoy'd 
Paris and my Friends there all that Time, and yet have been 
as soon at London. 
</p><p>
As I became in Arrear with my Business by so long an 
Absence, I have been necessarily much occupied since my 
Return, and have therefore postponed from time to time 
(and so long that I am now ashamed of it) the Purpose I had 
of writing soon to you, to express the Sense I have of your 
Kindness to me when a Stranger at Paris, and of the many 
Civilities I received from you there and from Mrs. Dalibard, 
which I assure you have made a lasting Impression on my 
Memory. I beg you will both of you accept my sincerest 
Thanks and Acknowledgments. The Time I spent in Paris, 
and in the improving Conversation and agreable Society of 
so many learned and ingenious Men, seems now to me like 
a pleasing Dream, from which I was sorry to be awaked by 
finding myself again at London. 
</p><p>
With the greatest Esteem and best Wishes for your 
Health and Happiness, I have the Honour to be,

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter by Captain Story, of November 
iQth, and a subsequent one by Captain Falconer without date. 
</p><p>
I have received also the Indian and buckwheat meal, that 
they brought from you, with the apples, cranberries, and nuts, 
for all which I thank you. They all prove good, and the 
apples were particularly welcome to me and my friends, as 
there happens to be scarce any of any kind in England this 
year. We are much obliged to the captains, who are so good 
as to bring these things for us, without charging any thing 
for their trouble. 
</p><p>
I am much concerned for my dear sister's loss of her daughter. It was kind in you to write a letter of condolence. I 
have also written to her on the occasion. I am not determined about bringing Sally over with me, but am obliged to 
you for the kind manner in which you speak of it, and possibly I may conclude to do it. I am sorry you had so much 
trouble with that Nelson. By what is now said of her here, 
she did not deserve the notice you took of her, or that any 
credit should be given to her stories. I am afraid she has 
made mischief in my family by her falsehoods. I think 
your advice good, not to help any one to servants. I shall 
never be concerned in such business again; I never was 
lucky in it. 
</p><p>
My love to all our relations and friends, and to Mr. and 
Mrs. Duffield, and to Mrs. Redman. I am much pleased 
with her daughter's writing, particularly for its correctness. 
I am now, and have been all this winter, in very good health, 
thanks to God. I only once felt a little admonition, as if a 
fit of the gout would attack me, but it did not. Whether 
sick or well, I am ever, my dear Debby, your affectionate 
husband, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I forgot to tell you that a certain very great lady, 
the best woman in England, was graciously pleased to accept 
some of your nuts, and to say they were excellent. This is 
to yourself only.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In mine of January 9, I wrote to you that I believed, 
notwithstanding the clamour against America had been 
greatly increased by the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> proceedings, we should 
attempt this session to obtain the repeal of the restraining 
act relating to paper money. The change of the administration with regard to American affairs, which was agreed 
on some time before the new secretary kissed hands and 
entered upon business, made it impossible to go forward 
with that affair, as the minister quitting that department 
would not, and his successor could not engage in it ; but now 
our friends the merchants have been moving in it, and some 
of them have conceived hopes, from the manner in which 
Lord Hillsborough attended to their representations. It 
had been previously concluded among us, that if the repeal 
was to be obtained at all, it must be proposed in the light of 
a favour to the merchants of this country, and asked for by 
them, not by the agents as a favour to America. But as my 
Lord had, at sundry times before he came into his present 
station, discoursed with me on the subject, and got from me 
a copy of my answer to his report, when at the head of the 
Board of Trade, which some time since he thanked me for, 
and said he would read again and consider carefully, I waited 
upon him this morning, partly with intent to learn if he had 
changed his sentiments. 
</p><p>
We entered into the subject, and had a long conversation 
upon it, in which all the arguments he used, against the legal 
tender of paper money, were intended to demonstrate, that 
it was for the benefit of the people themselves to have no such 
money current among them ; and it was strongly his opinion, 
that after the experience of being without it a few years we 
should all be convinced of this truth, as he said, the New 
England colonies now were ; they having lately, on the rumor 
of an intended application for taking off the restraint, petitioned here that it might be continued as to them. However, his Lordship was pleased to say, that if such application 
was made for the three colonies of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, 
and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, as I proposed, it should have fair play, he 
would himself give it no sort of opposition, but he was sure 
it would meet with a great deal, and he thought it could not 
succeed. He was pleased to make me compliments upon 
my paper, assuring me he had read it with a great deal of 
attention, that I had said much more in favour of such a currency than he thought could be said, and all he believed that 
the subject would admit of ; but that it had not on the whole 
changed his opinion, any further than to induce him to leave 
the matter now to the judgment of others, and let it take its 
course, without opposing it as last year he had determined 
to have done. 
</p><p>
I go into the city to-morrow, to confer with the merchants 
again upon it; that if they see any hopes, we may at least 
try the event : but I own my expectations are now very slender, 
knowing as I do, that nothing is to be done in Parliament 
that is not a measure adopted by ministry and supported by 
their strength, much less any thing they are averse to or 
indifferent about. 
</p><p>
I took the opportunity of discoursing with his Lordship 
concerning our particular affair of the change of government, 
gave him a detail of all proceedings hitherto, the delays it 
had met with, and its present situation. He was pleased to 
say he would inquire into the matter, and would talk with 
me farther upon it. He expressed great satisfaction in the 
good disposition that he said appeared now to be general in 
America, with regard to government here, according to the 
latest advices : and informed me that he had by his Majesty's 
order wrote the most healing letters to the several governors, 
which if shown to the Assemblies, as he supposed they would 
be, could not but confirm that good disposition. As to the 
permission we want to bring wine, fruit, and oil directly 
from Spain and Portugal, and to carry iron direct to foreign 
markets, 'tis agreed on all hands that this is an unfavourable 
time to move in those matters ; G[eorge] Grenville and those 
in the opposition, on every hint of the kind, making a great 
noise about the Act of Navigation, that palladium of England as they call it, to be given up to rebellious America, &c. 
&c., so that the ministry would not venture to propose it, if 
they approved. I am to wait on the secretary again next Wednesday, and shall write you farther what passes, that is 
material. 
</p><p>
The Parliament have of late been acting an egregious farce r 
calling before them the mayor and aldermen of <a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a>, 
for proposing a sum to be paid by their old members on being rechosen at the next election; and sundry printers and 
brokers, for advertising and dealing in boroughs, &c. The 
<a href='/results.php?city=oxford' rel='city'>Oxford</a> people were sent to Newgate, and discharged, after 
some days, on humble petition, and receiving the Speaker's 
reprimand upon their knees. The House could scarcely 
keep countenances, knowing as they all do, that the practice 
is general. People say, they mean nothing more than to 
beat down the price by a little discouragement of borough 
jobbing, now that their own elections are all coming on. The 
price indeed is grown exorbitant, no less than jour thousand 
pounds for a member. 
</p><p>
Mr. Beckford has brought in a bill for preventing bribery 
and corruption in elections, wherein was a clause to oblige 
every member to swear, on their admission into the House, 
that he had not directly or indirectly given any bribe to any 
elector, &c. ; but this was so universally exclaimed against, 
as answering no end but perjuring the members, that he has 
been obliged to withdraw that clause. It was indeed a cruel 
contrivance of his, worse than the gunpowder plot ; for that 
was only to blow the Parliament up to heaven, this to sink 
them all down to . Mr. Thurlow opposed his bill by a 
long speech. Beckford, in reply, gave a dry hit to the House, 
that is repeated everywhere. "The honourable gentleman," 
says he, "in his learned discourse, gave us first one definition 
of corruption, then he gave us another definition of corruption, 
and I think he was about to give us a third. Pray does that 
gentleman imagine there is any member of this House that 
does not KNOW what corruption is?" which occasioned only 
a roar of laughter, for they are so hardened in the practice, 
that they are very little ashamed of it. This between ourselves. I am with sincerest esteem, dear Sir, your most 
obedient humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote you a few lines by Captain Falconer, and sent you 
Dr. Watson's new piece of Experiments in Inoculation, 
which I hope will be agreeable to you. 
</p><p>
In yours of November 20th, you mention the lead in the 
worms of stills as a probable cause of the dry belly-ache 
among punch-drinkers in our West Indies. I had before 
acquainted Dr. Baker with a fact of that kind, the General mischief done by the use of leaden worms, when rum-distilling was first practised in New England, which occasioned 
a severe law there against them ; and he has mentioned it in 
the second part of his piece not yet published. I have long 
been of opinion, that that distemper proceeds always from 
a metallic cause only; observing that it affects, among 
tradesmen, those that use lead, however different their trades, 
as glaziers, letter-founders, plumbers, potters, white-lead 
makers, and painters; (from the latter, it has been conjectured, it took its name colica Pictonum, by the mistake of a 
letter, and not from its being the disease of Poictou;) and, 
although the worms of stills ought to be of pure tin, they are 
often made of pewter, which has a great mixture in it of lead. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people, pretending to interfere with the manufactures of this country, make a great clamour here against 
America in general. I have therefore endeavoured to palliate 
matters a little in several public papers. It would, as you 
justly observe, give less umbrage if we meddled only with 
such manufactures as England does not attend to. That 
of linen might be carried on more or less in every family, and 
silk, I think, in most of the colonies. But there are many 
manufactures that we cannot carry on to advantage, though 
we were at entire liberty. And, after all, this country is 
fond of manufactures beyond their real value, for the true 
source of riches is husbandry. Agriculture is truly productive of new wealth; manufacturers only change forms, 
and, whatever value they give to the materials they work 
upon, they in the mean time consume an equal value in 
provisions, &c. So that riches are not increased by manufacturing ; the only advantage is, that provisions in the shape 
of manufactures are more easily carried for sale to foreign 
markets. And where the provisions cannot be easily carried 
to market, it is well to transform them for our own use as well 
as foreign sale. In families also, where the children and 
servants of families have some spare time, it is well to employ 
it in making something, and in spinning or knitting, &c., 
to gather up the fragments (of time) that nothing may be lost, 
for those fragments, though small in themselves, amount to 
something great in the year, and the family must eat, whether 
they work or are idle. 
</p><p>
But this nation seems to have increased the number of 
its manufactures beyond reasonable bounds (for there are 
bounds to every thing), whereby provisions are now risen 
to an exorbitant price by the demand for supplying home 
mouths; so that there may be an importation from foreign 
countries ; but the expense of bringing provisions from abroad 
to feed manufacturers here will so enhance the price of the 
manufactures, that they may be made cheaper where the 
provisions grow, and the mouths will go to the meat. 
</p><p>
I am, with thanks for your good wishes, dear Sir, yours, 
&c., B. FRANKLIN.

SIR: 
</p><p>
I received of Captain Falconer your kind letter of Nov. 
1 8, with a very welcome present of another Dozen of your 
wine. The former has been found excellent by many good 
judges, my Wine Merchant in particular was very desirous 
of knowing what quantity of it might be had and at what 
price, in which I could give him no satisfaction. I only 
said that as the grapes being uncultivated, were not very 
juicy, I apprehended so many of them must be required, and 
so much labour in gathering, and pressing them to produce 
a little wine, that the price could not be very low. I shall 
apply this parcel as I did the last towards winning the hearts 
of the Friends of our Country, and wellwishers to the Change 
of its Government The Partizans of the present, may as 
you say flatter themselves that such Change will not take 
place, till the Proprietor's death, but I imagine he hardly 
thinks so himself. Anxiety and uneasiness are painted on his 
brow and the woman who would like to see how he would 
look when dead, need only look at him while living In 
that respect at least he appears to be a good Christian as one 
that dieth daily With great regard, and many thanks for 
your kindness to me, I am, Sir,

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your favours of November 17 and 18, with 
another dozen of excellent wine, the manufacture of our 
friend Livezey. I thank you for the care you have taken in 
forwarding them, and for your kind good wishes that accompany them. 
</p><p>
The story you mention of secretary Conway's wondering 
what I could be doing in England, and that he had not seen 
me for a considerable time, savours strongly of the channel 
through which it came, and deserves no notice. But, since 
his name is mentioned, it gives me occasion to relate what 
passed between us the last time I had the honour of conversing with him. It was at court, when the late changes were 
first rumoured, and it was reported he was to resign the secretary's office. Talking of America, I said I was sorry to 
find, that our friends were one after another quitting the 
administration, that I was apprehensive of the consequences, 
and hoped what I heard of his going out was not true. He 
said it was really true, the employment had not been of his 
choice, he had never any taste for it, but had submitted to 
engage in it for a time, at the instance of his friends, and he 
believed his removal could not be attended with any ill consequences to America: that he was a sincere well-wisher to 
the prosperity of that country as well as this, and hoped the 
imprudencies of either side would never be carried to such a height as to create a breach of the union, so essentially necessary to the welfare of both : that as long as his Majesty continued to honour him with a share in his counsels, America 
should always find in him a friend, &c. This I write, as 
it was agreeable to me to hear, and I suppose will be so to 
you to read. For his character has more in it of the frank 
honesty of the soldier, than of the plausible insincerity of the 
courtier ; and therefore what he says is more to be depended on. 
</p><p>
The Proprietor's dislike to my continuing in England, to 
be sure, is very natural; as well as to the repeated choice 
of Assembly men, not his friends; and probably he would, 
as they so little answer his purposes, wish to see elections as 
well as agencies abolished. They make him very unhappy, 
but it cannot be helped. 
</p><p>
The proceedings in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, as the news came just upon the 
meeting of Parliament, and occasioned great clamour here, 
gave me much concern. And as every offensive thing done 
in America is charged upon all, and every province though 
unconcerned in it, suffers in its interests through the General disgust given and the little distinction here made, it became 
necessary, I thought, to palliate the matter a little for our 
own sakes ; and therefore I wrote the paper, which probably 
you have seen printed in the Chronicle of January 7, and 
signed F + S. Yours affectionately, 
</p><p>

IT gave me great pleasure to see my dear good friend's 
name at the foot of a letter I received the other day, having 
been often uneasy at his long silence, blaming myself as the 
cause by my own previous backwardness and want of punctuality as a correspondent. I now suppose, (as in this he mentions nothing of it,) that a long letter I wrote him about this 
time twelvemonth, on the subject of the disputes with 
America, did miscarry, or that his answer to that letter miscarried, as I have never heard from him since I wrote that 
letter. 
</p><p>
I have long been of an opinion similar to that you express, 
and think happiness consists more in small conveniences or 
pleasures that occur every day, than in great pieces of good 
fortune that happen but seldom to a man in the course of his 
life. Thus I reckon it among my felicities, that I can set my 
own razor, and shave myself perfectly well ; in which I have 
a daily pleasure, and avoid the uneasiness one is sometimes 
obliged to suffer from the dirty fingers or bad breath of a 
slovenly barber. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on the purchase of a new house so much 
to your mind, and wish that you may long inhabit it with comfort. The inconvenience you mention of neighbouring smoke 
coming down the vents, is not owing to any bad construction 
of the vent down which it comes, and therefore not to be 
remedied by any change of form. It is merely the effect of 
a law of nature, whereby, whenever the outward air is warmer 
than the walls of the vent, the air included, being by those 
walls made colder, and of course denser and heavier than an 
equal column of the outward air, descends into the room, and 
in descending draws other air into the vent above to supply 
its place ; which, being in its turn cooled and condensed by 
the cooler walls of the vent, descends also, and so a current 
downwards is continued during the continuance of such difference in temperament between the outward air and the walls 
of the vent. 
</p><p>
When this difference is destroyed, by the outward air growing cooler, and the walls growing warmer, the current downwards ceases ; and, when the outward air becomes still colder 
than the walls, the current changes and moves from below 
upwards, the warmer walls rarefying the air they include, and 
thereby making it so much lighter than a column of the outward air of equal height, that it is obliged to give way to the 
other's superior weight and rise, is succeeded by colder air, 
which being warmed and rarefied in its turn, rises also, and 
so the upward current is continued. In summer, when fires 
are not made in the chimneys, the current generally sets 
downward from nine or ten in the morning during all the heat 
of the day, till five or six in the afternoon, then begins to hesitate, and afterwards to set upwards during the night, continuing till about nine in the morning, then hesitating for 
some time before it again sets downwards for the day. This 
is the general course, with some occasional variation of hours, 
according to the length of days or changes of weather. 
</p><p>
Now when the air of any vent is in this descending state, if 
the smoke issuing from a neighbouring vent happens to be 
carried over it by the wind, part will be drawn in and brought 
down into the room. The proper remedy then is, to close the 
opening of the chimney in the room by a board so fitted that 
little or no air can pass, whereby the currents above mentioned 
will be prevented. This board to remain during the summer, 
and when fires are not made in the chimney. Chimneys that 
have fires in them daily are not subject to this inconvenience, 
the walls of their vents being kept too warm to occasion any 
downward current during the hours between the going out 
of one fire and the kindling of another. And indeed, in summer, those vents that happen to go up close joined with the 
kitchen vent, are generally kept so warm by that as to be free 
from the downward current, and therefore free from what you 
call neighbour smoke. 
</p><p>
The <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> grate which you mention is a very good 
thing, if you could get one that is rightly made, and a workman skilful in putting them up. Those generally made and 
used here are much hurt by fancied improvements in their 
construction, and I cannot recommend them. As fuel with 
you is cheap and plenty, a saving in it is scarce an object. 
The sliding plates (of which I sent a model to Sir Alexander 
Dick) are, in my opinion, the most convenient for your purpose, as they keep a room sufficiently warm, are simple 
machines, easily fixed, and their management easily conceived and understood by servants. 
</p><p>
I shall leave Europe with much greater regret, if I cannot 
first visit you and my other friends in Scotland. I promise 
myself this happiness, but am not yet clear that I shall have 
time for it. Your kind invitation is extremely obliging. 
With sincere esteem I am, my dear friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you very fully by Falconer, of February 17, and 
have since received yours of January 21, together with one 
from the Committee, and the messages which, as you will 
see by my answer to the Committee, I communicated to Lord 
Hillsborough. His Lordship read them deliberately, and 
took notice that the message of the Assembly seemed to insinuate, that the governor had been tardy in bringing the 
former murderers to justice, which gave me an opportunity 
of explaining that matter to him; whereby he might also 
understand why the Proprietor had not shown him the messages when he communicated the governor's letter concerning 
the Indian uneasinesses, the law under his consideration for 
removing them, the late murder, and his proclamation. I 
shall wait on his Lordship again next Wednesday, on our 
affairs, and show him moreover your letter with some other 
papers. 
</p><p>
The old Parliament is gone, and its enemies now find themselves at liberty to abuse it. I inclose you a pamphlet, published the very hour of its prorogation. All the members are 
now in their counties and boroughs among their drunken 
electors; much confusion and disorder in many places, and 
such profusion of money as never was known before on any 
similar occasion. The first instance of bribery to be chosen 
a member, taken notice of on the journals, is no longer ago 
than Queen Elizabeth's time, when the being sent to Parliament was looked upon as a troublesome service, and therefore not sought after. It is said that such a one, "being a 
simple man, and conceiving it might be of some advantage to 
him, had given jour pounds to the mayor and corporation, 
that they might choose him to serve them in Parliament." 
</p><p>
The price is monstrously risen since that time, for it is now 
no less than four thousand pounds! It is thought, that near 
two millions will be spent this election ; but those, who understand figures and act by computation, say the crown has two 
millions a year in places and pensions to dispose of, and it is 
well worth while to engage in such a seven years' lottery, 
though all that have tickets should not get prizes. I am, my 
dear friend, yours affectionately, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I have received all together your letters of January 6, 21, 
and 22 : It had been a great while that I had not heard from 
you. The purpose of settling the new colonies seems at 
present to be dropped, the change of American administration not appearing favourable to it. There seems rather to 
be an inclination to abandon the posts in the back country 
as more expensive than useful; but counsels are so continually fluctuating here that nothing can be depended on. 
The new secretary, my Lord Hillsborough, is I find, of 
opinion, that the troops should be placed, the chief part of 
them, in Canada and Florida, only three battalions to be 
quartered in <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania ; and 
that Forts Pitt, Oswego, Niagara, &c., should be left to the 
colonies to garrison and keep up, if they think it necessary, 
for the protection of their trade, &c. Probably his opinion 
may be followed, if the new changes do not produce other 
ideas. 
</p><p>
As to my own sentiments, I am weary of suggesting them 
to so many different inattentive heads, though I must continue to do it while I stay among them. The letters from 
Sir William Johnson, relating to the boundary, were at last 
found, and orders were sent over about Christmas for completing the purchase and settlement of it. My Lord H. [illsborough] has promised me to send duplicates by this packet, 
and urge the speedy execution, as we represented to him the 
danger, that these dissatisfactions of the Indians might produce a war. But I can tell you there are many here to whom 
the news of such a war would give pleasure ; who speak of it 
as a thing to be wished ; partly as a chastisement to the colonies, and partly to make them feel the want of protection 
from this country, and pray for it. For it is imagined that 
we could not possibly defend ourselves against the Indians 
without such assistance, so little is the state of America 
understood here. 
</p><p>
My Lord H. mentioned the "Farmer's Letters" to me, 
said he had read them, that they were well written, and he 
believed he could guess who was the author, looking in my 
face at the same time, as if he thought it was me. He censured the doctrines as extremely wild, &c. I have read them 
as far as No. 8. I know not if any more have been published. 
I should have thought they had been written by Mr. Delancey, 
not having heard any mention of the others you point out as 
joint authors. I am not yet master of the idea these and the 
New England writers have of the relation between Britain 
and her colonies. I know not what the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> people mean 
by the "subordination" they acknowledge in their Assembly 
to Parliament, while they deny its power to make laws for 
them, nor what bounds the Farmer sets to the power he 
acknowledges in Parliament to "regulate the trade of the 
colonies," it being difficult to draw lines between duties for 
regulation and those for revenue ; and, if the Parliament is 
to be the judge, it seems to me that establishing such principles of distinction will amount to little. 
</p><p>
The more I have thought and read on the subject, the more 
I find myself confirmed in opinion, that no middle doctrine 
can be well maintained, I mean not clearly with intelligible 
arguments. Something might be made of either of the extremes ; that Parliament has a power to make all laws for us, 
or that it has a power to make no laws for us ; and I think 
the arguments for the latter more numerous and weighty, 
than those for the former. Supposing that doctrine established, the colonies would then be so many separate states, 
only subject to the same king, as England and Scotland were 
before the union. And then the question would be, whether 
a union like that with Scotland would or would not be advantageous to the whole. I should have no doubt of the 
affirmative, being fully persuaded that it would be best for 
the whole, and that though particular parts might find particular disadvantages in it, they would find greater advantages 
in the security arising to every part from the increased strength 
of the whole. But such union is not likely to take place, 
while the nature of our present relation is so little understood 
on both sides of the water, and sentiments concerning it 
remain so widely different. 
</p><p>
As to the Farmers combating, as you say they intend to 
do, my opinion, that the Parliament might lay duties though 
not impose internal taxes, I shall not give myself the trouble 
to defend it. Only to you, I may say, that not only the Parliament of Britain, but every state in Europe, claims and 
exercises a right of laying duties on the exportation of its own 
commodities to foreign countries A duty is paid here on 
coals exported to Holland, and yet England has no right to 
lay an internal tax on Holland. All goods brought out of 
France to England, or any other country, are charged with 
a small duty in France, which the consumers pay, and yet 
France has no right to tax other countries. And in my 
opinion the grievance is not that Britain puts duties upon 
her own manufactures exported to us, but that she forbids 
us to buy the like manufactures from any other country. 
This she does, however, in virtue of her allowed right to regulate the commerce of the whole empire, allowed I mean by the 
Farmer, though I think whoever would dispute that right 
might stand upon firmer ground, and make much more of the 
argument : but my reasons are too many and too long for a 
letter. 
</p><p>
Mr. Grenville complained in the House, that the governors 
of New Jersey, New Hampshire, East and West Florida, had 
none of them obeyed the orders sent them, to give an account 
of the manufactures carried on in their respective provinces. 
Upon hearing this, I went after the House was up, and got a 
sight of the reports made by the other governors. They are 
all much in the same strain, that there are no manufactures 
of any consequence ; in Massachusetts a little coarse woollen 
only, made in families for their own wear: glass and linen 
have been tried and failed. Rhode Island, Connecticut, and 
<a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> much the same. Pennsylvania has tried a linen 
manufactory, but it is dropped, it being imported cheaper; 
there is a glasshouse in Lancaster county, but it makes only 
a little coarse ware for the country neighbours. Maryland 
is clothed all with English manufactures. Virginia the same, 
except that in their families they spin a little cotton of their 
own growing. South Carolina and Georgia none./ / All speak 
of the dearness of labour that makes manufactures impracticable. Only the governor of North Carolina parades with 
a large manufacture in his country, that may be useful to 
Britain, of pine boards; they having fifty sawmills on one river. | ( 
</p><p>
These accounts are very satisfactory here, and induce the 
Parliament to despise and take no notice of the <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> resolutions. I wish you would send your account before the 
meeting of next Parliament. You have only to report a 
glasshouse for coarse window glass and bottles, and some 
domestic manufactures of linen and woollen for family use, 
that do not half clothe the inhabitants, all the finer goods 
coming from England and the like. I believe you will be 
puzzled to find any other, though I see great puffs in the 
papers. 
</p><p>
The Parliament is up, and the nation in a ferment with the 
new elections. Great complaints are made that the natural 
interests of country gentlemen in their neighbouring boroughs 
is overborne by the moneyed interests of the new people, who 
have got sudden fortunes in the Indies, or as contractors. 
Four thousand pounds is now the market price for a borough. 
In short, this whole venal nation is now at market, will be 
sold for about two millions, and might be bought out of the 
hands of the present bidders (if he would offer half a million 
more) by the very Devil himself. 
</p><p>
I shall wait on Lord H. again next Wednesday, on behalf 
of the sufferers by Indian and French depredations, to have 
an allowance of lands out of any new grant made by the 
Indians, so long solicited, and perhaps still to be solicited, in vain. I am your affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I dined yesterday with General Monckton, Major Gates, Colonel Lee, and other officers, who have served in 
and are friends of America. Monckton inquired kindly after your welfare.

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
On receipt of your letter of January 20, Mr. Jackson and 
myself waited on Lord Hillsborough, the new secretary of 
state for American affairs, and communicated to him the 
contents, pressing the necessity of enforcing the orders already 
sent to Sir William Johnson, for immediately settling the 
affair of the boundary line with the Indians. His Lordship 
was pleased to assure us, that he would cause duplicates of 
the orders to be forwarded by this packet, and urge the completion of them. 
</p><p>
We communicated also the copy of General Gage's letter, 
and the messages that had passed between the governor and 
the House thereupon. His Lordship acquainted us that a 
letter from Governor Penn had been shown him by the Proprietor, importing that a horrid murder had lately been committed on the Indians, upon which the governor had issued 
a proclamation for apprehending the murderer; and that a 
bill was under his and the Council's consideration to prevent future settlements on Indian lands. But his Lordship 
remarked, that these messages had not been communicated 
to him by the Proprietor. 
</p><p>
Government here begins to grow tired of the enormous 
expense of Indian affairs, and of maintaining posts in the 
Indian country ; and it is now talked of, as a proper measure, 
to abandon these posts, demolishing all but such as the colonies may think fit to keep up at their own expense ; and also 
to return the management of their own Indian affairs into the 
hands of the respective provinces as formerly. What the 
result will be, is uncertain, counsels here being so continually 
fluctuating. But I have urged often, that after taking those 
affairs out of our hands, it seems highly incumbent on the 
ministry not to neglect them, but to see that they are well 
managed and the Indians kept in peace. I think however 
that we should not too much depend on their doing this, but 
look to the matter a little ourselves, taking every opportunity 
of conciliating the affections of the Indians, by seeing that 
they always have justice done them, and sometimes kindness. 
For I can assure you, that here are not wanting people, who 
though not now in the ministry, no one knows how soon they 
may be; and if they were ministers, would take no step to 
prevent an Indian war in the colonies ; being of opinion, 
which they express openly, that it would be a very good thing, 
in the first place, to chastise the colonists for their undutifulness, and then to make them sensible of the necessity of protection by the troops of this country. 
</p><p>
Mr. Jackson, being now taken up with his election business, 
will hardly have time to write by this opportunity. But 
he joins with me in respects to you and the Assembly, and 
assurances of our most faithful services. I am, Gentlemen, 
your most obedient and most humble servant,

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I have just received your favour of February 20, directed 
to Mr. Jackson and myself, containing instructions for our 
conduct relating to the application for a repeal of the duty 
act, to the change of government, and to the legal tender of 
paper money ; which instructions we shall observe to the best 
of our abilities. Mr. Jackson has read your letter, and is 
now reading the messages and other papers transmitted to 
us, which we shall lay before the secretaries of state on Monday, and thereupon press the necessity of a change in the 
administration of our province. 
</p><p>
The Parliament will have a short session, it is said, in May, 
when, if any application is made for the repeal of that act, 
by the agents of the other colonies, we shall join them heartily, 
and do what we can likewise in the affair of paper money. 
In the mean time, should an Indian war make it necessary to 
emit paper money with a legal tender, it may be considered 
how far the fourth clause in the act of the 24 Geo. II. might 
give countenance to your providing in that way for the 
emergency; that act not being altered or repealed by any 
later, it seems as if the Parliament thought that clause not 
improper, though they have not expressly made the same 
provision for the other colonies. The mail being to go this 
evening, I can only add, that I am with the utmost respect 
for you and the Assembly, Gentlemen, your most obedient 
and most humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
Since my last, a long one, of March 13th, nothing has been 
talked or thought of here but elections. There have been 
amazing contests all over the kingdom, twenty or thirty thousand pounds of a side spent in several places, and inconceivable mischief done by debauching the people and making 
them idle, besides the immediate actual mischief done by 
drunken mad mobs to houses, windows, &c. The scenes 
have been horrible. London was illuminated two nights 
running at the command of the mob for the success of Wilkes, 
in the Middlesex election. The second night exceeded any 
thing of the kind ever seen here on the greatest occasions of 
rejoicing, as even the small cross-streets, lanes, courts, and 
other out-of-the-way places were all in a blaze with lights, 
and the principal streets all night long, as the mobs went 
round again after two o'clock, and obliged people who had 
extinguished their candles to light them again. Those who 
refused had all their windows destroyed. The damage done, 
and expense of candles, has been computed at fifty thousand 
pounds. It must have been great, though probably not so 
much. 
</p><p>
The ferment is not yet over, for he has promised to surrender himself to the court next Wednesday, and another 
tumult is then expected ; and what the upshot will be no one 
can yet foresee. It is really an extraordinary event to see an 
outlaw and an exile, of bad personal character, not worth a 
farthing, come over from France, set himself up as candidate for the capital of the kingdom, miss his election only by 
being too late in his application, and immediately carrying it 
for the principal county; the mob (spirited up by numbers 
of different ballads sung or roared in every street) requiring 
gentlemen and ladies of all ranks, as they passed in their 
carriages, to shout for Wilkes and liberty, marking the same 
words on all their coaches with chalk, and No. 45 l on every 
door; which extends a vast way along the roads into the 
country. I went last week to Winchester, and observed, 
that for fifteen miles out of town there was scarce a door or 
window shutter next the road unmarked ; and this continued, 
here and there, quite to Winchester, which is sixty-four 
miles.

You may remember, that when we were travelling together 
in Holland you remarked, that the trackschuyt in one of 
the stages went slower than usual, and inquired of the boatman, what might be the reason ; who answered, that it had 
been a dry season, and the water in the canal was low. On 
being again asked if it was so low as that the boat touched 
the muddy bottom; he said, no, not so low as that, but so 
low as to make it harder for the horse to draw the boat. We 
neither of us at first could conceive that if there was water 
enough for the boat to swim clear of the bottom, its being 
deeper would make any difference ; but as the man affirmed 
it seriously as a thing well known among them; and as the 
punctuality required in their stages, was likely to make 
such difference, if any there were, more readily observed by 
them, than by other watermen who did not pass so regularly 
and constantly backwards and forwards in the same track; 
I began to apprehend there might be something in it, and attempted to account for it from this consideration, that the 
boat in proceeding along the canal, must in every boat's 
length of her course, move out of her way a body of water, equal in bulk to the room her bottom took up in the water ; 
that the water so moved, must pass on each side of her and 
under her bottom to get behind her; that if the passage 
under her bottom was straitened by the shallows, more of 
that water must pass by her sides, and with a swifter motion, 
which would retard her, as moving the contrary way; or 
that the water becoming lower behind the boat than before, 
she was pressed back by the weight of its difference in height, 
and her motion retarded by having that weight constantly 
to overcome. But as it is often lost time to attempt accounting for uncertain facts, I determined to make an experiment 
of this, when I should have convenient time and opportunity. 
</p><p>
After our return to England, as often as I happened to be 
on the Thames, I inquired of our watermen whether they 
were sensible of any difference in rowing over shallow or 
deep water. I found them all agreeing in the fact, that there 
was a very great difference, but they differed widely in expressing the quantity of the difference; some supposing it 
was equal to a mile in six, others to a mile in three, &c. 
As I did not recollect to have met with any mention of this 
matter in our philosophical books, and conceiving that if 
the difference should really be great, it might be an object 
of consideration in the many projects now on foot for digging 
new navigable canals in this island, I lately put my design of 
making the experiment in execution, in the following manner. 
</p><p>
I provided a trough of plained boards fourteen feet long, 
six inches wide and six inches deep, in the clear, filled with 
water within half an inch of the edge, to represent a canal. 
I had a loose board of nearly the same length and breadth,, 
that being put into the water might be sunk to any depth, 
and fixed by little wedges where I would chuse to have it stay, in order to make different depths of water, leaving the 
surface at the same height with regard to the sides of the 
trough. I had a little boat in form of a lighter or boat of 
burthen, six inches long, two inches and a quarter wide, 
and one inch and a quarter deep. When swimming, it drew 
one inch water. To give motion to the boat, I fixed one end 
of a long silk thread to its bow, just even with the water's 
edge, the other end passed over a well made brass pully, of 
about an inch diameter, turning freely on a small axis; and 
a shilling was the weight. Then placing the boat at one end 
of the trough, the weight would draw it through the water 
to the other. 
</p><p>
Not having a watch that shows seconds, in order to measure 
the time taken up by the boat in passing from end to end, I 
counted as fast as I could count to ten repeatedly, keeping 
an account of the number of tens on my fingers. And as 
much as possible to correct any little inequalities in my counting, I repeated the experiment a number of times at each 
depth of water, that I might take the medium. And the 
following are the results. 
</p><p>
Water i

I made many other experiments, but the above are those 
in which I was most exact; and they serve sufficiently to 
show that the difference is considerable. Between the 
deepest and shallowest it appears to be somewhat more than 
one fifth. So that supposing large canals and boats and 
depths of water to bear the same proportions, and that four 
men or horses would draw a boat in deep water four leagues 
in four hours, it would require five to draw the same boat 
in the same time as far in shallow water; or four would 
require five hours. 
</p><p>
Whether this difference is of consequence enough to justify 
a greater expence in deepening canals, is a matter of calculation, which our ingenious engineers in that way will readily 
</p><p>
determine.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of March 13th, and am extremely 
concerned at the disorders on our frontiers, and at the debility 
or wicked connivance of our government and magistrates, 
which must make property and even life more and more 
insecure among us, if some effectual remedy is not speedily 
applied. I have laid all the accounts before the ministry 
here. I wish I could procure more attention to them. I 
have urged over and over the necessity of the change we 
desire ; but this country itself being at present in a situation 
very little better, weakens our argument that a royal government would be better managed, and safer to live under, 
than that of a proprietary. Even this capitol, the residence 
of the King, is now a daily scene of lawless riot and confusion. 
Mobs patrolling the streets at noonday, some knocking all 
down that will not roar for Wilkes and liberty; courts of 
justice afraid to give judgment against him; coal-heavers 
and porters pulling down the houses of coal merchants, that 
refuse to give them more wages; sawyers destroying sawmills; sailors unrigging all the outward bound ships, and 
suffering none to sail till merchants agree to raise their pay ; 
watermen destroying private boats and threatening bridges; 
soldiers firing among the mobs and killing men, women, and 
children, which seems only to have produced a universal 
sullenness, that looks like a great black cloud coming on, 
ready to burst in a general tempest. 
</p><p>
What the event will be God only knows. But some 
punishment seems preparing for a people, who are ungratefully abusing the best constitution, and the best King, any 
nation was ever blessed with, intent on nothing but luxury, 
licentiousness, power, places, pensions, and plunder ; while 
the ministry, divided in their counsels, with little regard for 
each other, worried by perpetual oppositions, in continual 
apprehension of changes, intent on securing popularity in 
case they should lose favour, have for some years past had 
little time or inclination to attend to our small affairs, whose 
remoteness makes them appear still smaller. 
</p><p>
The bishops here are very desirous of securing the Church 
of England in America, and promoting its interest and enlargement by sending one of their order thither ; but though 
they have long solicited this point with government here, 
they have not as yet been able to obtain it ; so apprehensive 
are ministers of engaging in any novel measure. 
</p><p>
I hope soon to have an opportunity of conferring with 
you, and therefore say no more at present on this subject. 
I am, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of March 31. It is now with the 
messages &c. in the hands of the minister, so that I cannot 
be more particular at present in answering it than to say, I 
should have a melancholy prospect in going home to such 
public confusion, if I did not leave greater confusion behind 
me. The newspapers, and my letter of this day to Mr. Ross, will inform you of the miserable situation this country 
is in. While I am writing, a great mob of coal porters fills 
the street, carrying a wretch of their business upon poles 
to be ducked, and otherwise punished at their pleasure for 
working at the old wages. All respect to law and government seems to be lost among the common people, who are 
moreover continually inflamed by seditious scribblers, to 
trample on authority and every thing that used to keep them 
in order. 
</p><p>
The Parliament is now sitting, but will not continue long 
together, nor undertake any material business. The court 
of King's Bench postponed giving sentence against Wilkes 
on his outlawry till the next term, intimidated as some say by 
his popularity, and willing to get rid of the affair for a time, 
till it should be seen what the Parliament would conclude 
as to his membership. The Commons at least some of them, 
resent that conduct, which has thrown a burthen on them it 
might have eased them of, by pillorying or punishing him in 
some infamous manner, that would have given better ground 
for expelling him the House. His friends complain of it as a 
delay of justice, say the court knew the outlawry to be defective, and that they must finally pronounce it void, but would 
punish him by long confinement. Great mobs of his adherents have assembled before the prison, the guards have 
fired on them; it is said five or six are killed, and sixteen 
or seventeen wounded; and some circumstances have attended this military execution, such as its being done by the 
Scotch regiment, the pursuing a lad, and killing him at his 
father's house, &c. &c., that exasperate people exceedingly, 
and more mischief seems brewing. Several of the soldiers 
are imprisoned. If they are not hanged, it is feared there 
will be more and greater mobs ; and, if they are, that no soldier 
will assist in suppressing any mob hereafter. The prospect 
either way is gloomy. It is said the English soldiers cannot 
be confided in, to act against these mobs, being suspected as 
rather inclined to favour and join them. 
</p><p>
I am preparing for my return, and hope for the pleasure 
of finding you well, when I shall have an opportunity of communicating to you more particularly the state of things here 
relating to our American affairs, which I cannot so well do 
by letter. I enclose for you a report of Sir M L , counsel to the Board of Trade, on one of your late acts. I 
suppose it has had its effect, so that the repeal will be of 
little consequence. In the mean time, I am with sincere 
esteem and affection, Sir, your most obedient and most 
humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
You must needs think the time long that your instruments 
have been in hand. Sundry circumstances have occasioned 
the delay. Mr. Short, who undertook to make the telescope, 
was long in a bad state of health, and much in the country 
for the benefit of the air. He however at length finished the 
material parts that required his own hand, and waited only 
for something about the mounting, that was to have been 
done by another workman ; when he was removed by death. 
I have put in my claim to the instrument, and shall obtain 
it from the executors as soon as his affairs can be settled. It 
is now become much more valuable than it would have been 
if he had lived, as he excelled all others in that branch. The 
price agreed for was one hundred pounds. 
</p><p>
The equal altitudes and transit instrument was undertaken by Mr. Bird, who doing all his work with his own 
hands for the sake of greater truth and exactness, one must 
have patience that expects any thing from him. He is so 
singularly eminent in his way, that the commissioners of 
longitude have lately given him five hundred pounds merely 
to discover and make public his method of dividing instruments. I send it you herewith. But what has made him 
longer in producing your instrument is, the great and hasty 
demand on him from France and Russia, and our Society 
here, for instruments to go to different parts of the world for 
observing the next transit of Venus; some to be used in 
Siberia, some for the observers that go to the South Seas, 
some for those that go to Hudson's Bay. These are now all 
completed, and mostly gone, it being necessary, on account 
of the distance, that they should go this year to be ready on 
the spot in time. And now, he tells me, he can finish yours, 
and that I shall have it next week. Possibly he may keep 
his word. But we are not to wonder if he does not. 
</p><p>
Mr. Martin, when I called to see his panopticon, had not 
one ready; but was to let me know when he should have 
one to show me. I have not since heard from him, but will 
call again. 
</p><p>
Mr. Maskelyne wishes much that some of the governments in North America would send an astronomer to Lake 
Superior, to observe this transit. I know no one of them 
likely to have a spirit for such an undertaking, unless it be 
the Massachusetts, or that have a person and instruments 
suitable. He presents you one of his pamphlets, which I 
now send you, together with two letters from him to me, 
relating to that observation. If your health and strength 
were sufficient for such an expedition, I should be glad to 
hear you had undertaken it. Possibly you may have an 
&kve that is capable. The fitting you out to observe the 
former transit, was a public act for the benefit of science, 
that did your province great honour. 
</p><p>
We expect soon a new volume of the Transactions, in which 
your piece will be printed. I have not yet got the separate 
ones which I ordered. 
</p><p>
It is perhaps not so extraordinary that unlearned men, 
such as commonly compose our church vestries, should not 
yet be acquainted with, and sensible of the benefits of metal 
conductors in averting the stroke of lightning, and preserving our houses from its violent effects, or that they should 
be still prejudiced against the use of such conductors, when 
we see how long even philosophers, men of extensive science 
and great ingenuity, can hold out against the evidence of new 
knowledge, that does not square with their preconceptions; 
and how long men can retain a practice that is conformable 
to their prejudices, and expect a benefit from such practice, 
though constant experience shows its inutility. A late piece 
of the Abbe' Nollet, printed last year in the Memoirs of the 
French Academy of Sciences, affords strong instances of 
this : For though the very relations he gives of the effects of 
lightning in several churches and other buildings show clearly, 
that it was conducted from one part to another by wires, 
gildings, and other pieces of metal that were within, or connected with the building, yet in the same paper he objects 
to the providing metalline conductors without the building, 
as useless or dangerous. He cautions people not to ring the 
church bells during a thunder-storm, lest the lightning, in its 
way to the earth, should be conducted down to them by the 
bell-ropes, which are but bad conductors ; and yet is against 
fixing metal rods on the outside of the steeple, which are 
known to be much better conductors, and which it would 
certainly chuse to pass in, rather than in dry hemp. And 
though for a thousand years past bells have been solemnly 
consecrated by the Romish Church, in expectation that the sound of such blessed bells would drive away those storms, 
and secure our buildings from the stroke of lightning; and 
during so long a period, it has not been found by experience, 
that places within the reach of such blessed sound, are safer 
than others where it is never heard ; but that on the contrary, 
the lightning seems to strike steeples of choice, and that at 
the very time the bells are ringing; yet still they continue 
to bless the new bells, and jangle the old ones whenever it 
thunders. One would think it was now time to try some 
other trick; and ours is recommended (whatever this able 
philosopher may have been told to the contrary) by more 
than twelve years' experience, wherein, among the great 
number of houses furnished with iron rods in North America, 
not one so guarded has been materially hurt with lightning, 
and several have been evidently preserved by their means; 
while a number of houses, churches, barns, ships, &c. in 
different places, unprovided with rods, have been struck and 
greatly damaged, demolished, or burnt. Probably the vestries of our English churches are not generally well acquainted 
with these facts; otherwise, since as good Protestants they 
have no faith in the blessing of bells, they would be less excusable in not providing this other security for their respective 
churches, and for the good people that may happen to be 
assembled in them during a tempest, especially as those 
buildings, from their greater height, are more exposed to the 
stroke of lightning than our common dwellings. 
</p><p>
I have nothing new in the philosophical way to communicate to you, except what follows. When I was last year in 
Germany ', I met with a singular kind of glass, being a tube 
about eight inches long, half an inch in diameter, with a 
hollow ball of near an inch diameter at one end, and one of 
an inch and half at the other, hermetically sealed, and half 
filled with water. If one end is held in hand, and the other 
a little elevated above the level, a constant succession of large 
bubbles proceeds from the end in the hand to the other end, 
making an appearance that puzzled me much, 'till I found 
that the space not filled with water was also free from air, 
and either filled with a subtile, invisible vapour continually 
rising from the water, and extreamly rarifiable by the least 
heat at one end, and condensable again by the least coolness 
at the other ; or it is the very fluid of fire itself, which parting 
from the hand pervades the glass, and by its expansive force 
depresses the water till it can pass between it and the glass, 
and escape to the other end, where it gets thro' the glass 
again into the air. I am rather inclined to the first opinion, 
but doubtful between the two. 
</p><p>
An ingenious artist here, Mr. Nairne, mathematical 
instrument-maker, has made a number of them from mine, 
and improved them, for his are much more sensible than 
those I brought from Germany. I bor'd a very small hole 
through the wainscot in the seat of my window, through which 
a little cold air constantly entered, while the air in the room 
was kept warmer by fires daily made in it, being winter time. 
I plac'd one of his glasses, with the elevated end against 
this hole ; and the bubbles from the other end, which was in 
a warmer situation, were continually passing day and night, 
to the no small surprize of even philosophical spectators. 
Each bubble discharged, is larger than that from which it 
proceeds, and yet that is not diminished ; and by adding itself 
to the bubble at the other end, that bubble is not increased, 
which seems very paradoxical. 
</p><p>
When the balls at each end are made larger, and the connecting tube very small and bent at right angles, so that the 
balls, instead of being at the ends, are brought on tlje side 
of the tube, and the tube is held so as that the balls are above 
it, the water will be depressed in that which is held in the 
hand, and rise in the other as a jet or fountain ; when it is 
all in the other, it begins to boil, as it were, by the vapour 
passing up through it; and the instant it begins to boil, a 
sudden coldness is felt in the ball held; a curious experiment, this, first observed and shewn me by Mr. Nairne. 
There is something in it similar to the old observation, I 
think mentioned by Aristotle, that the bottom of a boiling 
pot is not warm ; and perhaps it may help to explain that 
fact ; if indeed it be a fact. 
</p><p>
When the water stands at an equal height in both these 
balls, and all at rest ; if you wet one of the balls by means 
of a feather dipt in spirit, though that spirit is of the same 
temperament as to heat and cold, with the water in the glasses, 
yet the cold occasioned by the evaporation of the spirit from 
the wetted ball will so condense the vapour over the water 
contained in that ball, as that the water of the other ball 
will be pressed up into it, followed by a succession of bubbles, 
'till the spirit is all dried away. Perhaps the observations 
on these little instruments may suggest and be applied to 
some beneficial uses. It has been thought that water reduced to vapour by heat was rarified only fourteen thousand 
times, and on this principle our engines for raising water by 
fire are said to be constructed : But if the vapour so much 
rarified from water, is capable of being itself still farther 
rarified to a boundless degree by the application of heat to 
the vessels or parts of vessels containing the vapour (as at 
first it is applied to those containing the water) perhaps a 
much greater power may be obtained, with little additional 
expence. Possibly too, the power of easily moving water 
from one end to the other of a moveable beam (suspended 
in the middle like a scale-beam) by a small degree of heat, 
may be applied advantageously to some other mechanical 
purposes. 
</p><p>
The magic square and circle, I am told, have occasioned 
a good deal of puzzling among the mathematicians here; 
but no one has desired me to show him my method of disposing the numbers. It seems they wish rather to investigate 
it themselves. When I have the pleasure of seeing you, I 
will communicate it. 
</p><p>
With singular esteem and respect, I am, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient humble servant,

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
Since my last, I have received yours of May 10, dated at 
Amboy, which I shall answer particularly by next week's 
packet. I purpose now to take notice of that part wherein 
you say it was reported at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> I was to be appointed 
to a certain office here, which my friends all wished, but you 
did not believe it for the reason I had mentioned. Instead 
of my being appointed to a new office, there has been a motion made to deprive me of that I now hold, and, I believe, 
for the same reason, though that was not the reason given 
out, viz. my being too much of an American; but, as it 
came from Lord Sandwich, our new postmaster-general, who 
is of the Bedford party, and a friend of Mr. Grenville, I have 
no doubt that the reason he gave out, viz. my non-residence, 
was only the pretence, and that the other was the true reason ; 
especially as it is the practice in many other instances to 
allow the non-residence of American officers who spend their 
salaries here, provided care is taken that the business be done 
by deputy or otherwise. 
</p><p>
The first notice I had of this was from my fast friend Mr. Cooper, secretary of the treasury. He desired me by a little 
note to call upon him there, which I did, when he told me, 
that the Duke of Grafton had mentioned to him some discourse of Lord Sandwich's, as if the office suffered by my 
absence, and that it would be fit to appoint another, as I 
seemed constantly to reside in England: that Mr. Todd, 
secretary of the postoffice, had also been with the Duke, 
talking to the same purpose, &c. ; that the Duke had wished 
him (Mr. Cooper) to mention this to me, and to say to me 
at the same time that though my going to my post might 
remove the objection, yet if I choose rather to reside in England, my merit was such in his opinion, as to entitle me to 
something better here, and it should not be his fault if I was 
not well provided for. I told Mr. Cooper that without having heard any exception had been taken to my residence 
here, I was really preparing to return home, and expected 
to be gone in a few weeks; that however I was extremely 
sensible of the Duke's goodness, in giving me this intimation, 
and very thankful for his favourable disposition towards 
me; that having lived long in England, and contracted a 
friendship and affection for many persons here, it could not 
but be agreeable to me to remain among them some time 
longer, if not for the rest of my life ; and that there was no 
nobleman, to whom I could, from sincere respect for his 
great abilities and amiable qualities, so cordially attach 
myself, or to whom I should so willingly be obliged for the 
provision he mentioned, as to the Duke of Grafton, if his 
Grace should think I could, in any station where he might 
place me, be serviceable to him and to the public. 
</p><p>
Mr. Cooper said he was very glad to hear I was still willing 
to remain in England, as it agreed so perfectly with his inclinations to keep me here. Wished me to leave my name 
at the Duke of Grafton's as soon as possible, and to be at the 
treasury again the next board day. I accordingly called at 
the Duke's, and left my card ; and when I went next to the 
treasury, his Grace not being there, Mr. Cooper carried me 
to Lord North, chancellor of the exchequer, who said very 
obligingly, after talking of some American affairs, "I am told 
by Mr. Cooper, that you are not unwilling to stay with us. 
I hope we shall find some way of making it worth your while." 
I thanked his Lordship, and said I should stay with pleasure, 
if I could any ways be useful to government. He made me 
a compliment and I took my leave, Mr. Cooper carrying me 
away with him to his country-house at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a> to dine 
and stay all night. 
</p><p>
He then told me that Mr. Todd had been again at the 
Duke of Grafton's, and that, upon his (Mr. Cooper's) speaking in my behalf, Mr. Todd had changed his style, and said 
I had to be sure a great deal of merit with the office, having 
by my good management regulated the posts in America, so 
as greatly to increase the revenue; that he had had great 
satisfaction in corresponding with me while I was there, 
and he believed they never had a better officer, &c. The 
Thursday following, being the birthday, I met with Mr. Todd at court. He was very civil, took me with him in his 
coach to the King's Arms in the city, where I had been invited to dine by Mr. Trevor, with the gentlemen of the postoffice; we had a good deal of chat after dinner between us 
two, in which he told me, Lord Sandwich (who was very 
sharp) had taken notice of my stay in England, and said, If 
one could do the business, why should there be two? On 
my telling Mr. Todd that I was going home, (which I still 
say to everybody, not knowing but that what is intimated 
above may fail of taking effect,) he looked blank, and seemed 
disconcerted a little, which makes me think some friend of his 
was to have been vested with my place ; but this is surmise 
only' We parted very good friends. 
</p><p>
That day I received another note from Mr. Cooper, directing me to be at the Duke of Grafton's next morning, whose 
porter had orders to let me in. I went accordingly, and was 
immediately admitted. But his Grace being then engaged 
in some unexpected business, with much condescension and 
politeness made that apology for his not discoursing with me 
then, but wished me to be at the treasury at twelve the next 
Tuesday. I went accordingly, when Mr. Cooper told me 
something had called the Duke into the country, and the 
board was put off, which was not known till it was too late 
to send me word ; but was glad I was come, as he might then 
fix another day for me to go again with him into the country. 
The day fixed was Thursday. I returned yesterday ; should have stayed till Monday, but for writing by these vessels. 
He assures me the Duke has it at heart to do something 
handsome for me. Sir John Pringle, who is anxious for my 
stay, says Mr. Cooper is the honestest man of a courtier 
that he ever knew, and he is persuaded they are in earnest 
to keep me. 
</p><p>
The piece I wrote against smuggling, in the Chronicle of 
November last, and one in April, on the Labouring Poor, 
which you will find in the Gentleman's Magazine for that 
month, have been lately shown by Mr. Cooper to the chancellor of the exchequer, and to the Duke, who have expressed 
themselves much pleased with them. I am to be again at 
the treasury on Tuesday next, by appointment of Mr. Cooper. 
Thus particular I have been, that you may judge of this 
affair. 
</p><p>
For my own thoughts, I must tell you that though I did 
not think fit to decline any favour so great a man expressed 
an inclination to do me, because at court if one shows an unwillingness to be obliged, it is often construed as a mark 
of mental hostility, and one makes an enemy; yet so great 
is my inclination to be at home, and at rest, that I shall not 
be sorry if this business falls through, and I am suffered to 
retire with my old post; nor indeed very sorry if they take 
that from me too on account of my zeal for America, in 
which some of my friends have hinted to me that I have been 
too open. I shall soon be able, I hope, by the next packet, 
to give you farther light. In the mean time, as no one but 
Sir John knows of the treaty, I talk daily of going in the 
August packet at farthest. And when the late Georgia appointment of me to be their agent is mentioned, as what may 
detain me, I say, I have yet received no letters from that Assembly, acquainting me what their business may be ; that 
I shall probably hear from them before that packet sails ; 
that, if it is extraordinary and of such a nature as to make 
my stay another winter necessary, I may possibly stay, because there would not be time for them to choose another; 
but, if it is common business, I shall leave it with Mr. Jackson and proceed. 
</p><p>
I do not, by the way, know how that appointment came 
about, having no acquaintance that I can recollect in that 
country. It has been mentioned in the papers some time, 
but I have only just now received a letter from Governor 
Wright, informing me that he had that day given his assent 
to it, and expressing his desire to correspond with me on all 
occasions, saying the Committee, as soon as they could get 
their papers ready, would write to me and acquaint me with 
their business. 
</p><p>
We have lost Lord Clare from the Board of Trade. He 
took me home from court the Sunday before his removal, 
that I might dine with him as he said alone, and talk over 
American affairs. He seemed as attentive to them, as if he 
was to continue ever so long. He gave me a great deal of 
flummery; saying, that though at my Examination I answered some of his questions a little pertly, yet he liked me, 
from that day, for the spirit I showed in defence of my 
country ; and at parting, after we had drank a bottle and a 
half of claret each, he hugged and kissed me, protesting 
he never in his life met with a man he was so much in love 
with. This I write for your amusement. You see by the 
nature of this whole letter, that it is to yourself only. It 
may serve to prepare your mind for any event that shall happen.

If Mr. Grenville comes into power again, in any department respecting America, I must refuse to accept of any 
thing that may seem to put me in his power, because I 
apprehend a breach between the two countries; and that 
refusal might give offence. So that you see a turn of a die 
may make a great difference in our affairs. We may be 
either promoted, or discarded ; one or the other seems likely 
soon to be the case, but it is hard to divine which. I am 
myself grown so old as to feel much less than formerly the 
spur of ambition, and if it were not for the flattering expectation, that by being fixed here I might more effectually 
serve my country, I should certainly determine for retirement, 
without a moment's hesitation. I am, as ever, your affectionate father, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Since my last, nothing material has occurred here relating 
to American affairs, except the removal of Lord Clare from 
the head of the Board of Trade to the treasury of Ireland, 
and the return of Lord Hillsborough to the Board of Trade 
as first commissioner, retaining the title and powers of secretary of state for the colonies. This change was very 
sudden and unexpected. My Lord Clare took me home 
from court to dine with him but two days before, saying he 
should be without other company, and wanted to talk with 
me on sundry American businesses. We had accordingly a good deal of conversation on our affairs, in which he seemed 
to interest himself with all the attention, that could be supposed in a minister, who expected to continue in the management of them. This was on Sunday, and on the Tuesday 
following he was removed. Whether my Lord Hillsborough's 
administration will be more stable, than others have been 
for a long time, is quite uncertain ; but, as his inclinations are 
rather favourable towards us (so far as he thinks consistent 
with what he supposes the unquestionable rights of Britain), 
I cannot but wish it may continue, especially as these perpetual mutations prevent the progress of all business. 
</p><p>
But another change is now talked of that gives me great 
uneasiness. Several of the Bedford party being now got in, 
it has been for some time apprehended that they would sooner 
or later draw their friend Mr. Grenville in after them. It 
is now said, he is to be secretary of state, in the room of Lord 
Shelburne. If this should take place, or if in any other 
shape he comes again into power, I fear his sentiments of the 
Americans, and theirs of him, will occasion such clashings 
as may be attended with fatal consequences. The last accounts from your part of the world, of the combinations 
relating to commerce with this country, and resolutions concerning the duties here laid upon it, occasion much serious 
reflection, and 'tis thought the points in dispute between the 
two countries will not fail to come under the consideration 
of Parliament early in next session. Our friends wonder 
that I persist in my intention of returning this summer, 
alleging that I might be of much more service to my country 
here, than I can be there, and wishing me by all means to stay 
the ensuing winter, as the presence of persons well acquainted 
with America, and of ability to represent these affairs in a 
</p><p>
proper light, will then be highly necessary. My private 
concerns, however, so much require my presence at home, 
that I have not yet suffered myself to be persuaded by their 
partial opinion of me. 
</p><p>
The tumults and disorders, that prevailed here lately, 
have now pretty well subsided. Wilkes's outlawry is reversed, but he is sentenced to twenty-two months imprisonment, and one thousand pounds fine, which his friends, who 
feared he would be pilloried, seem rather satisfied with. 
The importation of corn, a pretty good hay harvest, now 
near over, and the prospect of plenty from a fine crop of 
wheat, makes the poor more patient, in hopes of an abatement in the price of provisions; so that unless want of 
employment by the failure of American orders should distress 
them, they are like to be tolerably quiet. 
</p><p>
I purpose writing to you again by the packet that goes 
next Saturday, and therefore now only add that I am, with 
sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient and most 
humble servant, B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of the 20th of April with the very 
entertaining and informing Books you so obligingly sent me, 
for which I thank you. 
</p><p>
As you seem only to have seen Extracts in the Magazines 
from the Account of East Florida, I send you the Book itself, 
which may afford you some farther Lights concerning the 
Country. I am not myself otherwise much acquainted with 
it than from such public Writings, my Place of Abode, 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, being near <a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a> Miles from Florida. I can 
only remark to you that generally those who have at heart 
the Settlement of New Countries, are apt, while they expatiate 
on the Advantages, to pass over and conceal the Disadvantages, so that a just Idea of the New Country is rarely to be 
obtained by reading their Accounts. And as you profess a 
Reliance on my Opinion in the Affair of your removal to 
America, I must not advise you to go to E. Florida, lest 
my Unacquaintedness with that Country should lead you into hazardous Mistakes. Besides, when I consider the Hardships usually attending the Settlement of New Countries, and the Sickness and Mortality to which new Settlers, 
unaccustomed to the Climate, are exposed, I cannot think 
such Undertakings so fit for Persons of your & your Wife's 
Age, that have Children depending on them, as for young 
unmarried Persons, whose Deaths can only affect themselves, 
or will not be attended with such unhappy Consequences. 
Therefore, if you cannot remain contented with your Situation in Holland, but are determined on a Country Life in 
America, my Advice to you would be, to purchase a Plantation ready formed, in one of the old Settled Provinces, New 
York, New Jersey, or Pensilvania, of which there are 
Choice continually to be sold, as you will see by the Newspapers that I send you herewith. In either of these three 
Provinces the three modern Languages you possess, German, 
Low Dutch & French, may be useful to you, as there are 
Numbers of Germans, Hollanders and French among the 
Inhabitants ; and your other Accomplishments will be of 
more Value in a well-settled Country, than in a new One 
thin of People, and you will have more of the Pleasures and 
Comforts of Neighbourhood & Society. With the money 
you are like to be possessed of, at the End of your present 
Contract you may certainly buy and Stock a very good 
Plantation in one of those flourishing Provinces, where the 
Climate is healthy, and the Government mild and good, 
and where if anywhere, Competence and Happiness are 
within the Reach of every honest, prudent & industrious 
Man. 
</p><p>
I purpose remaining here another Winter, and returning 
home to Pensilvania in the Spring. I hope your Resolution, 
whatever it is, may be attended with the Success you wish. 
If you determine for either of those Provinces, as I live in 
one of them, my Son in another (N. Jersey) and I have some 
Friends in the third, N. York, I may possibly be of some 
utility to you in your Settling, which would be a Pleasure to, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

I GREATLY approve the epithet which you give, in your 
letter of the 8th of June, to the new method of treating the 
small-pox, which you call the tonic or bracing method; I 
will take occasion from it to mention a practice to which I 
have accustomed myself. You know the cold bath has long 
been in vogue here as a tonic ; but the shock of the cold water 
has always appeared to me, generally speaking, as too 
violent, and I have found it much more agreeable to my 
constitution to bathe in another element, I mean cold air. 
With this view I rise almost every morning, and sit in my 
chamber without any clothes whatever, half an hour or an 
hour, according to the season, either reading or writing. 
This practice is not in the least painful, but, on the contrary, 
agreeable ; and, if I return to bed afterwards, before I dress 
myself, as sometimes happens, I make a supplement to my 
night's rest of one or two hours of the most pleasing sleep 
that can be imagined. I find no ill consequences whatever 
resulting from it, and that at least it does not injure my 
health, if it does not in fact contribute much to its preservation. I shall therefore call it for the future a footing or 
tonic bath. B. FRANKLIN.

I RECEIVED your obliging letter of the loth May, with the 
most acceptable present of your Physiocratie, which I have 
read with great pleasure, and received from it a great deal of 
instruction. There is such a freedom from local and national 
prejudices and partialities, so much benevolence to mankind 
in general, so much goodness mixt with the wisdom, in the 
principles of your new philosophy, that I am perfectly 
charmed with them, and wish I could have stayed in France 
for some time, to have studied in your school, that I might 
by conversing with its founders have made myself quite a 
master of that philosophy. ... I had, before I went into 
your country, seen some letters of yours to Dr. Templeman, 
that gave me a high opinion of the doctrines you are engaged in cultivating and of your personal talents and abilities, 
which made me greatly desirous of seeing you. Since I had 
not that good fortune, the next best thing is the advantage 
you are so good to offer me of your correspondence, which 
I shall ever highly value, and endeavour to cultivate with all 
the diligence I am capable of. 
</p><p>
I am sorry to find that that wisdom which sees the welfare 
of the parts in the prosperity of the whole, seems yet not to 
be known in this country. . . . We are so far from conceiving that what is best for mankind, or even for Europe in 
general, may be best for us, that we are even studying to 
establish and extend a separate interest of Britain, to the prejudice of even Ireland and our colonies. ... It is from 
your philosophy only that the maxims of a contrary and more 
happy conduct are to be drawn, which I therefore sincerely 
wish may grow and increase till it becomes the governing 
philosophy of the human species, as it must be that of superior 
beings in better worlds. I will take the liberty of sending 
you a little fragment that has some tincture of it, which, on 
that account, I hope may be acceptable. 
</p><p>
Be so good as to present my sincere respect to that venerable apostle, Dr. Quesnay, and to the illustrious Ami des 
Hommes (of whose civilities to me at Paris I retain a grateful 
remembrance), and believe me to be, with real and very 
great esteem Sir, 
</p><p>
Your obliged and most obedient humble servant

DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
You made an Apology to me for not acquaint' me sooner 
with your Marriage. I ought now to make an Apology to 
you for delaying so long the Answer to your Letter. It was 
mislaid or hid among my Papers and much Business put 
it out of my Mind, or prevented my looking for it and writing 
when I thought of it. So this Account between us if you 
please may stand balanced. I assure you it gave me great 
Pleasure to hear you were married, and into a Family of 
Reputation. This I learnt from the Public Papers. The 
Character you give me of your Bride (as it includes every 
Qualification that in the married State conduces to mutual 
Happiness) is an Addition to that Pleasure. Had you consulted me, as a Friend, on the Occasion, Youth on both sides 
I should not have thought any Objection. Indeed, from the 
matches that have fallen under my Observation, I am 
rather inclin'd to think, that early ones stand the best 
Chance for Happiness. The Tempers and habits of young 
People are not yet become so stiff and uncomplying, as 
when more advanced in Life ; they form more easily to each 
other, and hence many Occasions of Disgust are removed. 
And if Youth has less of that Prudence, that is necessary to 
conduct a Family, yet the Parents and elder Friends of young 
married Persons are generally at hand to afford their Advice, 
which amply supplies that Defect; and, by early Marriage, 
Youth is sooner form'd to regular and useful Life; and 
possibly some of those Accidents, Habits or Connections, that 
might have injured either the Constitution, or the Reputation, 
or both, are thereby happily prevented. 
</p><p>
Particular Circumstances of particular Persons may 
possibly sometimes make it prudent to delay entering into 
that State; but in general, when Nature has render'd our 
Bodies fit for it, the Presumption is in Nature's Favour, 
that she has not judg'd amiss in making us desire it. Late 
Marriages are often attended, too, with this further Inconvenience, that there is not the same Chance the parents 
shall live to see their offspring educated. "Late Children" 
says the Spanish Proverb, "are early Orphans" A melancholy Reflection to those, whose Case it may be ! With us 
in America, Marriages are generally in the Morning of 
Life; our Children are therefore educated and settled in 
the World by Noon ; and thus, our Business being done, we 
have an Afternoon and Evening of chearful Leisure to ourselves; such as your Friend at present enjoys. By these 
early Marriages we are blest with more Children; and from 
the Mode among us, founded in Nature, of every Mother 
suckling and nursing her own Child, more of them are raised. 
Thence the swift Progress of Population among us, unparalleled in Europe. 
</p><p>
In fine, I am glad you are married, and congratulate you 
most cordially upon it. You are now more in the way of 
becoming a useful Citizen; and you have escap'd the unnatural State of Celibacy for Life, the Fate of many here, 
who never intended it, but who, having too long postponed the 
Change of their Condition, find at length, that 'tis too late 
to think of it, and so live all their Lives in a Situation that 
greatly lessens a Man's Value. An odd Volume of a Set of 
Books you know is not worth its proportion of the Set, and 
what think you of the Usefulness of an odd Half of a Pair 
of Scissors ? It cannot well cut any thing. It may possibly 
serve to scrape a Trencher. 
</p><p>
Pray make my Compliments and best Wishes acceptable 
to your Spouse. I am old and heavy and grow a little indolent, or I should ere this have presented them in Person. 
I shall make but small Use of the old Man's Privilege, that 
of giving Advice to younger Friends. Treat your Wife 
always with Respect; it will procure Respect to you, not 
from her only but from all that observe it. Never use a 
slighting Expression to her, even in jest, for Slights in Jest, after frequent bandyings, are apt to end in angry earnest. 
Be studious in your Profession, and you will be learned. 
Be industrious and frugal, and you will be rich. Be sober 
and temperate, and you will be healthy. Be in General virtuous, and you will be happy. At least, you will, by 
such Conduct, stand the best Chance for such Consequences. 
I pray God to bless you both; being ever your affectionate 
Friend, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR M' HALL. 
</p><p>
I receiv'd yours of June 20. &. 22. I have wrote my Mind 
fully to you in former Letters relating to the Stamp Act; 
so that I have but little to add, except what you desire to know 
about the 2/ on Advertisements. It is undoubtedly to be 
paid every Time the Advertisement is inserted. As to the 
Paper sent over, I did it for the best, having at that time 
Expectations given me that we might have had it stampt 
there; in which case you would have had great Advantage 
of the other Printers, since if they were not provided with 
such Paper, they must have either printed but a half sheet 
common Demi, or paid for two Stamps on each Sheet. The 
Plan was afterward altered notwithstanding all I could do, 
it being alledged that Scotland & every Colony would expect 
the same Indulgence if it was granted to us. The Papers 
must not be sent back again : But I hope you will excuse 
what I did in Good will, tho' it happened wrong The 
Molds I still think you should have, as you see that Paper 
from hence is much dearer than we can make it, with all 
Charge of Carriage, but that I hope to get off. 
</p><p>
I would not have you by any means drop the Newspaper, 
as I am sure it will soon recover any present Loss, and may 
be carried on to advantage, if you steadily proceed as I propos'd in former Letters. I am 
</p><p>
Yours affectionately

</p><p>
QUERIES, recommended to the Consideration of those 
Gentlemen who are for vigorous measures with the Americans. 
</p><p>
1. Have the Colonists refused to answer any reasonable 
requisitions made to their Assemblies by the mother country? 
</p><p>
2. If they have not refused to grant reasonable aids in the 
way, which they think consistent with liberty, why must they 
be stripped of their property without their own consent, and 
in a way, which they think inconsistent with liberty? 
</p><p>
3. What is it for a people to be enslaved and tributary, if 
this be not, viz. to be forced to give up their property at the 
arbitrary pleasure of persons, to whose authority they have 
not submitted themselves, nor chosen for the purpose of imposing taxes upon them? Wherein consisted the impropriety of King Charles's demanding ship money by his sole 
authority, but in its being an exercise of power by the King, 
which the people had not given the King? Have the people 
of America, as the people of Britain, by sending representatives, consented to a power in the British parliament to tax them? 
</p><p>
4. Has not the British parliament, by repealing the stamp 
act, acknowledged that they judged it improper? Is there 
any difference between the stamp act, and the act obliging 
the Americans to pay whatever we please, for articles which 
they cannot do without, as glass and paper? Is there any 
difference as to justice between our treatment of the colonists, 
and the tyranny of the Carthaginians over their conquered 
Sardinians, when they obliged them to take all their corn 
from them, and at whatever price they pleased to set upon it? 
</p><p>
5. If that be true, what is commonly said, viz. That the 
mother country gains two millions a year by the colonies, 
would it not have been wiser to have gone on quietly in the 
happy way we were in, till our gains by those rising and 
flourishing countries should amount to three, four or five 
millions a year, than by these new fashioned vigorous measures to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs? Would 
it not have been better policy, instead of taxing our colonists, 
to have done whatever we could to enrich them; and encourage them to take off our articles of luxury, on which we 
may put our own price, and thus draw them into paying 
us a voluntary tax; than deluge them in blood, thin their 
countries, impoverish and distress them, interrupt their 
commerce, force them on bankruptcy, by which our merchants must be ruined, or tempt them to emigrations, or 
alliances with our enemies? 
</p><p>
6. The late war could not have been carried on without 
America, nor without Scotland? Have we treated America 
and Scotland in such a manner as is likely in future wars to 
encourage their zeal for the common cause ? Or is England 
alone to be the Drawcansir of the world, and to bully not 
only their enemies, but her friends ? 
</p><p>
7. Are not the subjects of Britain concerned to check a 
ministry, who, by this rage of heaping taxes on taxes, are only 
drawing into their own hands more and more wealth and 
power, while they are hurting the commercial interest of the 
empire in general, at the same time that, amidst profound 
peace, the national debt and burden on the public continue undiminished ?

SIR, 
</p><p>
Threescore years did the oppressed United Provinces 
maintain a war in defence of their liberties against the then 
powerful kingdom of Spain, with all the wealth of the Indies 
at its command; and finally obliged to acknowledge their 
independency in a formal treaty, sitting down with the loss 
of territory, treasure and reputation, and with a broken 
strength that has never since been recovered. 
</p><p>
Contractors, jobbing mercantile members of parliament, 
officers starving on half pay, and gunsmiths who toast, as 
the papers tell us, a speedy and a perpetual war, may wish, 
rather than no war at all, for a civil one in America. These 
in all conversations, to encourage us in undertaking it, 
slight the strength of those distant people, think nothing of 
that enthusiasm for liberty, which in other countries and ages 
has supplied all deficiencies, and enabled a weak people to 
baffle the efforts of a stronger ; but tell us that half a dozen 
regiments are sufficient to reduce in less than a year every 
province on the continent. Half a dozen being once engaged in this blessed service, it is easy to write and shew the 
necessity for more : The more there are the greater the profits to those gentry. And whatever becomes of us poor devils 
that live by manufactures or by trade, that are to pay taxes, 
or that have money in the funds, they will amass fortunes, 
buy our estates, bribe our boroughs, and vote in parliament 
the rectitude of the measure. 
</p><p>
I believe our officers and soldiers as brave as any in the 
world; and from that very opinion of their bravery I conjecture they would not generally relish the being ordered on 
this murdering service against their countrymen; to shed 
English blood, to stifle the British spirit of liberty now rising 
in the Colonies ; that LIBERTY which we should rather wish 
to see nourished and preserved there, as on a loss of it here 
(which from our vices is perhaps not far distant) we or our 
posterity may have occasion to resort to and participate of; 
and possibly some of the ablest officers may choose, with 
Sir Jeffery Amherst, rather to resign their commissions. But 
whatever may be the bravery and military powers of our 
troops, and whatever the zeal with which they would proceed 
in such a war, there are reasons that make me suspect that 
it will not be so soon terminated as some folks would have 
us believe. 
</p><p>
My reasons are drawn chiefly from a computation founded 
on facts. It is well known that America is a country full of 
forests, mountains, &c. That in such a country a small 
irregular force can give abundance of trouble to a regular 
one that is much greater: And that, in the last war, one of 
the fifteen Colonies we now have there (and one far short 
of being the strongest) held out five years against twenty-five thousand British regular troops; joined by twenty-five 
thousand Colonists on their own pay, and aided by a strong 
fleet of men of war. What the expence was to this nation, 
our treasury books and augmented debt may shew. The 
expence to America, as their pay was higher, could not be 
much less. The Colony we made war upon was indeed aided 
by France, but during the whole contest not with more than 
five thousand men. Now supposing that the twenty-five 
thousand Colonists, that then joined us, should hereafter 
be against us, and that this makes no difference, and considering that instead of one Colony to conquer, we are to have 
fifteen, and that possibly some of our good neighbours may 
think of making a diversion in their favour, I apprehend it 
not out of the way to allow five years still to a Colony ; and 
this by my computation, will amount to just seventy five 
years. I hope Messieurs the company of gunsmiths will for 
the present be so good as to be content with a civil war of 
seventy-five years, and perhaps we may scarce be able to 
afford them a perpetual one. 
</p><p>
And what are we to gain by this war, by which our trade 
and manufactures are to be ruined, our strength divided 
and diminished, our debt increased, and our reputation, as 
a generous nation, and lovers of liberty, given up and lost? 
Why, we are to convert millions of the King's loyal subjects 
into rebels, for the sake of establishing a new claimed power 
in P to tax a distant people, whose abilities and circumstances they cannot be acquainted with, who have a 
constitutional power of taxing themselves; who have never 
refused to give us voluntarily more than we can ever expect 
</p><p>
to wrest from them by force; and by our trade with whom 
we gain millions a year ! 
</p><p>
And is there not one wise and good man to be found in 
Britain, who can propose some conciliating measure that 
may prevent this terrible mischief? I fear not one. For 
</p><p>
Quos Deus vult perdere, dementat prius!

He intends to visit Turin and being anxious to know you 
I could not deny him the honour of this note which will

length upon the subject of your last letter, but the various

no one has more perfect esteem and respect for your reverence 
than he who has the honour to be, Reverend Sir,

SIR, 
</p><p>
As you have printed here your letter of yesterday to your 
friend in America, and it may be long before you receive an 
answer from thence, permit me in the mean time to give you a 
few remarks on it, submitting them, as you have done your 
Letter, to the Public. 
</p><p>
The disposition you shew to promote peace and harmony 
between the two countries, is commendable: But if you 
wish to have any influence with us Americans as a mediator, 
methinks you should have avoided giving us ground for suspicion that you are prejudiced against us, and that you have 
imbibed notions of us extremely injurious, and not founded 
in fact. 
</p><p>
You speak of us as a people unreasonable enough to expect 
protection from Britain, without contributing towards the 
expense, which is far from being the case. The King has 
no subjects more willing to grant him aids in proportion to 
their abilities. 
</p><p>
You speak of our "dangerous and vain expectations of 
becoming independent," and say that "certainly there are 
such among us." j Allow me to tell you, that you are certainly 
mistaken, and that there is not a single wish in the colonies 
to be free from subjection to their amiable sovereign the King 
of Great-Britain, and the constitutional dependence thence 
arising; and the charging them with such views is a cruel 
calumny, which you ought not to have countenanced, much less to have asserted it as a certain fact, j 
</p><p>
You bring an account against us of Eighty Millions, which 
you say this nation has run in debt by a war commenced for 
our protection ; and this, joined with your groundless insinuations of our unwillingness to contribute to the exigencies of 
the crown, seems intended to make us odious, as being both 
burthensome and ungrateful. We cannot take this well of 
you, when it is known that that war was commenced, not to 
defend the colonies (who were in profound peace, and had 
given no offence to their neighbours, either Indians or French) 
but to protect the British trade with the Indians which the 
French had interrupted, and to remove their incroachments 
on the King's wilderness lands in Acadia. We have never 
engaged Britain in any war on our account, but have constantly managed our Indian wars ourselves, without asking 
help from hence, either of men or money. On the other hand, 
by our connexion with Britain we are unavoidably drawn into 
all her wars, and always have, as it was our duty, borne our 
part of them without murmuring. And you might, with more 
propriety, have charged that expence of Eighty Millions to 
the manufactures of Birmingham, Yorkshire, Manchester, 
Norwich, &c. or to the British merchants, since the securing 
a vent for their goods, and the freedom and extention of their 
trade, was more the motive of the war, than our protection, 
who asked for none. But you pass them over as Hanover, 
Portugal, and the East India company, whose protection was 
expressly intended by Britain, and indeed highly expensive 
to her; tho' left intirely out of your account, that the odium 
of the whole may be laid on us. As to the " burning all our 
maritime towns," which you would intimidate us with, I 
shall only say, that I wonder how so barbarian a thought 
came into a peaceable man's head. This brave and generous 
nation can never proceed to such excesses against us, merely 
for vindicating our rights, and endeavouring to secure them 
by the quiet measures of industry and frugality. However, 
if our property is not in fact our own, but may be taken from 
us, at the pleasure of others without our consent, it is no 
matter how soon it is burnt; it is not worth belonging on 
such terms. 
</p><p>
You further intimate that our using British manufactures 
gives us no merit with this nation, because we must have used 
them if our ancestors had not migrated, and we had of course 
been born here. This is an ingenious argument, which I 
will not dispute, but only observe, that if Britain is not obliged 
by our buying her goods, we hope she will not be disobliged 
by our refusing them; since if we had been both here we 
might have worked for ourselves, and that is only what we are 
now about to do. 
</p><p>
Upon the whole, as we are not presumptuous enough to ask 
an union with Britain, such as England contracted with Scotland, we have no "proposition" to make, but that she would 
leave us the enjoyment of our native and dear-bought privileges, and not attempt to alter or innovate our constitutions, 
in the exercise of which everything went prosperously for 
both countries, till the idea of taxing us by the power of Parliament unfortunately entered the heads of your ministers, 
which had occasioned a public discussion of questions that 
had better never been started, and thrown all into confusion. 
</p><p>
I am, Sir, with great respect for your good intentions, 
equally a lover of peace with yourself, and also 
Your well wishing friend,

It feels very strange to me to have Ships and Packets come 
in, and no Letters from you. But I do not complain of it, 
because I know the reason is, my having written to you that I 
was coming home. That you may not have the same disagreable Sensation, I write this Line, tho I have written 
largely by the late Ships, and therefore have little left to say. 
I have lately been in the Country to spend a few Days at 
Friends' Houses, and to breathe a little fresh Air. I have 
made no very long Journey this Summer as usual, finding 
myself in very good Health, a greater Share of which I believe 
few enjoy at my time of Life, but we are not to expect it will 
be always Sunshine. Cousin Folger, who is just arrived 
from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, tells me he saw our Son and Daughter Bache at 
that Place, and that they were going farther, being very well, 
which I was glad to hear. My love to them and all Friends,

</p><p>
DEAR POLLEY, 
</p><p>
I did not receive your Letter of the 26th till I came home 
late last night, too late to answer it by the Return of that 
Post. 
</p><p>
I see very clearly the Unhappiness of your Situation, 
and that it does not arise from any Fault in you. I pity you 
most sincerely. I should not, however, have thought of 
giving you Advice on this Occasion, if you had not requested 
it, believing, as I do, that your own good Sense is more than 
sufficient to direct you in every Point of Duty to others and 
yourself. If, then, I should advise you to any thing, that 
may be contrary to your own Opinion, do not imagine, that I 
shall condemn you if you do not follow such Advice. I shall 
only think, that, from a better Acquaintance with Circumstances, you form a better Judgment of what is fit for you 
to do. 
</p><p>
Now, I conceive with you, that your Aunt, both from her 
Affection to you, and from the long Habit of having you with 
her, would really be miserable without you. Her Temper, 
perhaps, was never of the best ; and, when that is the Case, 
Age seldom mends it. Much of her Unhappiness must arise 
from thence; and, since wrong Turns of the Mind, when 
confirm'd by Time, are almost as little in our Power to cure, 
as those of the Body, I think with you, that her Case is a 
compassionable one. 
</p><p>
If she had, though by her own Imprudence, brought on 
herself any grievous Sickness, I know you would think it your Duty to attend and nurse her with filial Tenderness, even 
were your own Health to be endangered by it. Your Apprehension, therefore, is right, that it may be your Duty to live 
with her, tho inconsistent with your Happiness and your 
Interest ; but this can only mean present Interest and present 
Happiness ; for I think your future, greater, and more lasting 
Interest and Happiness will arise from the Reflection, that 
you have done your Duty, and from the high Rank you will 
ever hold in the Esteem of all that know you, for having persevered in doing that Duty under so many and great Discouragements. 
</p><p>
My Advice, then, must be, that you return to her as soon 
as the Time you proposed for your Visit is expir'd ; and that 
you continue, by every means in your Power, to make the Remainder of her Days as comfortable to her as possible. Invent 
Amusements for her ; be pleas'd when she accepts of them, 
and patient when she perhaps peevishly rejects them. I 
know this is hard, but I think you are equal to it ; not from 
any Servility in your Temper, but from abundant Goodness. 
In the mean time, all your Friends, sensible of your present 
uncomfortable Situation, should endeavour to ease your 
Burthen, by acting in Concert with you, and to give her as 
many Opportunities as possible of enjoying the Pleasures of 
Society, for your sake. 
</p><p>
Nothing is more apt to sour the Temper of aged People, 
than the Apprehension that they are neglected ; and they are 
extremely apt to entertain such Suspicions. It was therefore 
that I did propose asking her to be of our late Party; but, 
your Mother disliking it, the Motion was dropt, as some 
others have been, by my too great Easiness, contrary to my 
Judgment. Not but that I was sensible her being with us might have lessen'd our Pleasure, but I hop'd it might have prevented you some Pain. 
</p><p>
In fine, nothing can contribute to true Happiness, that is 
inconsistent with Duty; nor can a course of Action, conformable to it, be finally without an ample Reward. For 
God governs ; and he is good. I pray him to direct you ; 
and, indeed, you will never be without his Direction, if 
you humbly ask it, and show yourself always ready to obey 
it. Farewell, my dear Friend, and believe me ever sincerely 
and affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of the 12th instant. Your 
sentiments of the importance of the present dispute between 
Great Britain and the colonies appear to me extremely just. 
There is nothing I wish for more, than to see it amicably and 
equitably settled. 
</p><p>
But <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a> will bring about its own ends by its own 
means ; and if it intends the downfall of a nation, that nation 
will be so blinded by its pride and other passions, as not to 
see its danger, or how its fall may be prevented. 
</p><p>
Being born and bred in one of the countries, and having 
lived long and made many agreeable connections of friendship in the other, I wish all prosperity to both; but I have 
talked and written so much and so long on the subject, that my acquaintance are weary of hearing, and the public of 
reading any more of it, which begins to make me weary of 
talking and writing; especially as I do not find that I have 
gained any point, in either country, except that of rendering 
myself suspected by my impartiality ; in England, of being 
too much an American, and in America, of being too much an 
Englishman. Your opinion, however, weighs with me, and 
encourages me to try one effort more, in a full, though concise statement of facts, accompanied with arguments drawn 
from those facts ; to be published about the meeting of Parliament, after the holidays. If any good may be done I shall 
rejoice ; but at present I almost despair. 
</p><p>
Have you ever seen the barometer so low as of late? 
The 22d instant, mine was at 28'41, and yet the weather fine 
and fair. With sincere esteem, I am, dear friend, yours 
</p><p>
affectionately,

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have now before me your Favours of Oct. i, 18. 23. 30. 
and Nov. 5, which I shall answer in order. 
</p><p>
I wonder to hear that my Friends were backward in bringing you my Letters when they arrived, and think it must be a 
mere Imagination of yours, the Effect of some melancholy 
Humour you happened then to be in. I condole with you sincerely on poor Debby's Account, and hope she got well to 
her Husband with her two Children. 
</p><p>
You say in yours of Oct. 18, "For me to give you any Uneasiness about your Affairs here, would be of no Service, and 
I shall not at this time enter on it." I am made by this to 
apprehend that something is amiss, and perhaps have more 
Uneasiness from the Uncertainty, than I should have had if 
you had told me what it was. I wish therefore you would 
be explicit in your next. I rejoice that my good old Friend, 
Mr. Coleman, is got safe home, and continues well. Upon 
what you write me now about the Watches, I shall, if I can 
afford it, send you another for yourself. I say if I find I can 
afford it; for I understand the Ballance of the Post Office 
Account which I must pay here, is greatly against me, owing 
to the large Sums you have received. I do not doubt your 
having applied them properly, and I only mention it, that if 
I do not send you a Watch, it will not be thro' Neglect or for 
want of Regard, but because I cannot spare the Cash, for I 
shall not like to leave Debts behind me here. Mrs. Stevens's 
Bills since her Marriage have been accepted as before, I 
should have mention'd it if they had not. Sally Franklin 
whom you inquire after is here at present under Mrs. Stevenson's care, but I expect her Father to fetch her soon. She 
presents her Duty. 
</p><p>
Remember me respectfully to Mr. Rhodes, <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>, 
Mr. Roberts, Mr. and Mrs. Duffield, Neighbour Thomson, 
Dr. and Mrs. Redman, Mrs. Hopkinson, Mr. Duche', Dr. 
Morgan, Mr. Hopkinson, and all the other Friends you have 
from time to time mention'd as enquiring after me. As you 
ask me, I can assure you, that I do really intend, God willing, 
to return in the Summer, and that as soon as possible after 
seeing and settling Matters with Mr. Foxcroft, whom I 
expect in April or May. I am glad that you find so much 
reason to be satisfy'd with Mr. Bache. I hope all will prove 
for the best. Capt. Falkener has been arrived at <a href='/results.php?city=plymouth' rel='city'>Plymouth</a> 
some time, but the Winds being contrary could get no farther, 
so I have not yet received the Apples, Meal, &c., and fear 
they will be spoilt. I send with this, some of the new kind of 
Oats much admir'd here to make Oatmeal of, and for other 
Uses, as being free from Huskes; and some Swiss Barley 
6 Rows to an Ear : perhaps our Friends may like to try them, 
and you may distribute the Seed among them. Give some 
to Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Thomson, Mr. Bartram, 
our Son, and others. 
</p><p>
I cannot comprehend how so very sluggish a Creature as 
Ben. Mecom is grown, can maintain in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> so large 
a Family. I hope they do not hang upon you : for really as 
we grow old and must grow more helpless, we shall find we 
have nothing to spare. 
</p><p>
I hope the Cold you complain of in two of your Letters 
went off without any ill Consequences. We are, as you observe, blest with a great Share of Health considering our 
Years now 63. For my own part, I think of late that my Constitution rather mends: I have had but one Touch of the 
Gout, and that a light one, since I left you ; It was just after 
my Arrival here, so that this is the 4th Winter I have been 
free. Walking a great deal tires me less than it used to do. 
I feel stronger and more active. Yet I would not have you 
think that I fancy I shall grow young again. I know that 
men of my Bulk often fail suddenly : I know that according 
to the Course of Nature I cannot at most continue much longer, 
and that the living even of another Day is uncertain. I there
fore now form no Schemes, but such as are of immediate Execution; indulging myself in no future Prospect except one, 
that of returning to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, there to spend the Evening 
of Life with my Friends and Family. 
</p><p>
Mr. and Mrs. Strahan, & Mr. and Mrs. West, when I last 
saw them, desired to be kindly remembred to you. Mrs. 
Stevenson and our Polly send their Love. Mr. Coombe, who 
seems a very agreable young Man, lodges with us for the 
present. Adieu, my dear Debby. I am, as ever, your 
affectionate Husband,

MY DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
It is always a great pleasure to me to hear from you, and 
would be a much greater to be with you, to converse with you 
on the subjects you mention, or any other. Possibly I may 
one day enjoy that pleasure. In the mean time, we may use 
the privilege, that the knowledge of letters affords us, of conversing at a distance by the pen. 
</p><p>
I am glad to find you are turning your thoughts to political 
subjects, and particularly to those of money, taxes, manufactures, and commerce. The world is yet much in the dark 
on these important points ; and many mischievous mistakes 
are continually made in the management of them. Most of 
our acts of Parliament for regulating them are, in my opinion, 
little better than political blunders, owing to ignorance of the 
science, or to the designs of crafty men, who mislead the 
legislature, proposing something under the specious appearance of public good, while the real aim is, to sacrifice that to 
their own private interest. I hope a good deal of light may 
be thrown on these subjects by your sagacity and acuteness. 
I only wish I could first have engaged you in discussing the 
weighty points in dispute between Britain and the colonies. 
But the long letter I wrote you for that purpose, in February 
or March, <a href='/results.php?year=1767'>1767</a>, perhaps never reached your hand, for I have 
not yet had a word from you in answer to it.
</p><p>
The act you inquire about had its rise thus. During the 
war, Virginia issued great sums of paper money for the payment of their troops, to be sunk in a number of years by taxes. 
The British merchants trading thither received these bills 
in payment for their goods, purchasing tobacco with them to 
send home. The crop of tobacco one or two years falling 
short, the factors, who were desirous of making a speedy 
remittance, sought to pay, with the paper money, bills of exchange. The number of bidders for these bills raised the 
price of them thirty per cent above par. This was deemed so 
much loss to the purchasers, and supposed to arise from a 
depreciation of the paper money. The merchants, on this 
supposition, founded a complaint against that currency to 
the Board of Trade. Lord Hillsborough, then at the head of 
that Board, took up the matter strongly, and drew a report, 
which was presented to the King in Council, against all paper 
currency in the colonies. And, though there was no complaint against it from any merchants, but those trading to 
Virginia, all those trading to the other colonies being satisfied 
with its operation, yet the ministry proposed, and the Parliament came into the making a general act, forbidding all future 
emissions of paper money, that should be a legal tender in 
any colony whatever. 
</p><p>
The Virginia merchants have since had the mortification 
to find, that, if they had kept the paper money a year or two, 
the above mentioned loss would have been avoided; for, as 
soon as tobacco became more plenty, and of course bills of exchange also, the exchange fell as much as it before had risen. 
I was in America when the act passed. On my return to England, I got the merchants trading to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Pennsylvania, 
Maryland, Virginia, &c., to meet, to consider and join in an 
application to have the restraining act repealed. To prevent 
this application, a copy was put into the merchants' hands of 
Lord Hillsborough's report, by which it was supposed they 
might be convinced, that such an application would be wrong. 
They desired my sentiments on it, which I gave in the paper 
I send you enclosed. I have no copy by me of the report itself ; 
but in my answer you will see a faithful abridgment of all the 
arguments or reasons it contained. Lord Hillsborough has 
read my answer, but says he is not convinced by it, and adheres to his former opinion. We know nothing can be done 
in Parliament, that the minister is absolutely against, and 
therefore we let that point rest for the present. And, as I 
think a scarcity of money will work with our other present 
motives for lessening our fond extravagance in the use of the 
superfluous manufactures of this country, which unkindly 
grudges us the enjoyment of common rights, and will tend to 
lead us naturally into industry and frugality, I am grown 
more indifferent about the repeal of the act, and, if my 
countrymen will be advised by me, we shall never ask it again. 
There is not, as I conceive, any new principle wanting, to 
account for the operations of air, and all the affections of 
smoke in rooms and chimneys; but it is difficult to advise 
in particular cases at a distance, where one cannot have all 
the circumstances under view. If two rooms and chimneys 
are " perfectly similar" in situation, dimension, and all other 
circumstances, it seems not possible, that, "in summer, when 
no fire had been in either of them for some months, and in a 
calm day, a current of air should at the same time go up the 
chimney of the one, and down the chimney of the other." 
But such difference may and often does take place, from 
circumstances in which they are dissimilar, and which dissimilarity is not very obvious to those who have little studied 
the subject. As to your particular case, which you describe 
to be, that, "after a whole day's fire, which must greatly heat 
the vent, yet, when the fire becomes low, so as not to emit any 
smoke, neighbour smoke immediately begins to descend and 
fill the room ;" this, if not owing to particular winds, may be 
occasioned by a stronger fire in another room, communicating with yours by a door, the outer air being excluded by the 
outward door's being shut, whereby the stronger fire finds it 
easier to be supplied with air down through the vent, in which 
the weak fire is, and thence through the communicating door, 
than through the crevices. If this is the circumstance, you 
will find that a supply of air is only wanting, that may be 
sufficient for both vents. If this is not the circumstance, 
send me, if you please, a complete description of your room, 
its situation, and connexion, and possibly I may form a better 
judgment. Though I imagine your Professor of Natural 
Philosophy, Mr. Russel, or Mr. George Clark, may give you 
as good advice on the subject as I can. But I shall take the 
liberty of sending you, by the first convenient opportunity, 
a collection of my philosophical papers lately published, in 
which you will find something more relating to the motions 
of air in chimneys. 
</p><p>
To commence a conversation with you on your new project, 
I have thrown some of my present sentiments into the concise 
form of aphorisms, to be examined between us, if you please, 
and rejected or corrected and confirmed, as we shall find most 
proper. I send them enclosed.

MY DEAR OLD FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of November 5th, and the box 
directed to the King is since come to hand. I have written 
a line to our late dear friend's son, 2 (who must be best acquainted with the usual manner of transacting your affairs 
here,) to know whether he will take charge of the delivery of 
it ; if not, to request he would inform me how or to whom it is 
to be sent for the King. I expect his answer in a day or two, 
and I shall, when I see him, inquire how your pension is hereafter to be applied for and received, though I suppose he has 
written to you before this time. 
</p><p>
I hope your health continues, as mine does hitherto; but 
I wish you would now decline your long and dangerous 
peregrinations in search of new plants, and remain safe and 
quiet at home, employing your leisure hours in a work that is 
much wanted, and which no one besides is so capable of performing ; I mean the writing a Natural History of our country. I imagine it would prove profitable to you, and I am 
sure it would do you honour. My respects and best wishes 
attend Mrs. Bartram and your family. With sincere esteem 
</p><p>
I am, as ever, your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. January 28th. The box is delivered, according to 
Mr. Michael Collinson's directions, at Lord Bute's. I have 
sent over some seed of naked oats and some of Swiss barley, six rows to one ear. If you would choose to try some 
of it, call on Mrs. Franklin.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your obliging favour of November i5th. I presented your compliments to Sir John Pringle, who was glad 
with me to hear of your welfare, and desired me to offer his 
best respects whenever I wrote to you. The Farmer's 
Letters were written by one Mr. Dickinson, of <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
and not by me, as you seem to suppose. I only caused them 
to be reprinted here with that little Preface, and had no other 
hand in them, except that I see some of my sentiments formerly published are collected, and interwoven with those of 
others and his own, by the author. I am glad they afforded 
you any amusement. It is true, as you have heard, that 
troops are posted in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, on the pretence of preventing 
riots and protecting the custom-house officers ; but it is also 
true, that there was no intention among the people there, 
to oppose the landing of those troops, or to resist the execution of the law by arms. The riots talked of were sudden, 
unpremeditated things, that happened only among a few of 
the lower sort. Their plan of making war on this country 
is of a different kind. It is to be a war on commerce only, 
and consists in an absolute determination to buy and use no 
more of the manufactures of Britain, till the act is repealed. 
This is already agreed to by four provinces, and will be by 
all the rest in the ensuing summer. Eleven ships now here 
from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> and <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, which would have carried, one 
with another, fifty thousand pounds sterling each in goods, 
are going away in their ballast, as the Parliament seems determined not to repeal. I am inclined to think, however, 
that it will alter its mind before the end of the session. Otherwise it is to be feared the breach will grow wider by successive 
indiscretions on both sides. 
</p><p>
The subject you propose to me, the consequences of allowing a free exportation of corn, the advantages or disadvantages 
of the Concurrence, &c., is a very extensive one ; and I have 
been, and am at present, so much occupied with our American 
affairs, as that, if I were ever so capable of handling it, I 
have not time to engage in it at present to any purpose. I 
think, however, with you, that the true principles of commerce 
are yet but little understood, and that most of the acts of 
Parliament, arr&s and edicts of princes and states, relating 
to commerce, are political errors, solicited and obtained by 
particulars for private interest, under the pretext of public good.

The bearer of this, Captain Ourry, is a particular friend of 
mine, who now only passes through Paris for Lyons and Nice, 
but in his return may stay in your city some time. He is a 
gentleman of excellent character and great merit, and as such 
I beg leave to recommend him to your civilities and advice, 
which may be of great service to him, as he is quite a stranger 
in Paris. With the greatest esteem and respect, I am, dear 
Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant,

P. S. Your English is extremely good ; but, if it is more 
easy for you to write in French, do not give yourself the trouble 
of writing in English, as I understand your French perfectly well.

MY DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your excellent paper on the preferable use of 
oxen in agriculture, and have put it in the way of being communicated to the public here. I have observed in America, 
that the farmers are more thriving in those parts of the country where cattle are used, than in those where the labour is 
done by horses. The latter are said to require twice the 
quantity of land to maintain them ; and after all are not good 
to eat, at least we do not think them so. Here is a waste of 
land that might afford subsistence for so many of the human 
species. Perhaps it was for this reason, that the Hebrew 
lawgiver, having promised that the children of Israel should 
be as numerous as the sands of the sea, not only took care to 
secure the health of individuals by regulating their diet, 
that they might be fitter for producing children, but also 
forbid their using horses, as those animals would lessen the 
quantity of subsistence for men. Thus we find, when they 
took any horses from their enemies, they destroyed them; 
and in the commandments, where the labour of the ox and 
ass is mentioned, and forbidden on the Sabbath, there is 
no mention of the horse, probably because they were to have 
none. And, by the great armies suddenly raised in that small 
territory they inhabited, it appears to have been very full of 
people. 
</p><p>
Food is always necessary to all; and much the greatest 
part of the labour of mankind is employed in raising provisions for the mouth. Is not this kind of labour, then, the 
fittest to be the standard by which to measure the values of 
all other labour, and consequently of all other things whose 
value depends on the labour of making or procuring them? 
May not even gold and silver be thus valued ? If the labour 
of the farmer, in producing a bushel of wheat, be equal to 
the labour of the miner in producing an ounce of silver, will 
not the bushel of wheat just measure the value of the ounce 
of silver. The miner must eat ; the farmer indeed can live 
without the ounce of silver, and so perhaps will have some 
advantage in settling the price. But these discussions I 
leave to you, as being more able to manage them; only, 
I will send you a little scrap I wrote some time since on the 
laws prohibiting foreign commodities. 
</p><p>
I congratulate you on your election as president of your 
Edinburgh Society. I think I formerly took notice to you in 
conversation, that I thought there had been some similarity 
in our fortunes, and the circumstances of our lives. This 
is a fresh instance, for, by letters just received, I find that I 
was about the same time chosen president of our American 
Philosophical Society, established at <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
I have sent by sea, to the care of Mr. Alexander, a little 
box, containing a few copies of the late edition of my books, 
for my friends in Scotland. One is directed for you, and one 
for your Society, which I beg that you and they would accept 
as a small mark of my respect. With the sincerest esteem 
and regard, I am, my dear friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am sorry my letter of <a href='/results.php?year=1767'>1767</a>, concerning the American disputes, miscarried. I now send you a copy of it from 
my book. The Examination mentioned in it you have probably seen. Things daily wear a worse aspect, and tend more 
and more to a breach and final separation.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour by Mr. Jefferies. I should have 
been glad if in any thing I could have served him here. The 
Part I took in the Application for your Degree l was merely 
doing justice to Merit, which is the Duty of an honest Man 
whenever he has the Opportunity. I did that Duty, indeed, 
with Pleasure and Satisfaction to myself, which was sufficient ; 
but I own the Pleasure is greatly increased by finding, that 
you are so good as to accept my Endeavours kindly. 
</p><p>
I was about to return home last Summer, and had some thoughts of doing it by way of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>; but the untoward 
Situation of American Affairs here induc'd my Friends to 
advise my staying another Winter. I should have been happy 
in doing any Service to our Country. The Tide is yet strong 
against us, and our Endeavours to turn it have hitherto had 
but little Effect. But it must turn, if your frugal and industrious Resolutions continue. Your old Governor, Mr. Pownall, 
appears a warm and zealous Friend to the Colonies in Parliament, but unfortunately he is very ill-heard at present. 
I have been in constant Pain since I heard of Troops assembling at <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, lest the Madness of Mobs, or the Insolence 
of Soldiers, or both, should, when too near each other, occasion some Mischief difficult to be prevented or repaired, and 
which might spread far and wide. I hope, however, that 
Prudence will predominate, and keep all quiet. 
</p><p>
A great cause between the City of London and the Dissenters was decided here the Year before last in the House of 
Lords. No Account of it has been printed ; but, one having 
been taken in writing, I obtained a Copy of it, which I send 
you, supposing it may afford you and your Friends some 
Pleasure. 
</p><p>
Please to present my respectful Compliments to Mrs. 
Cooper, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>, when you see him. With 
sincere and great esteem, I am, Rev'd dear Sir

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
At length after much Delay and Difficulty I have been able 
to obtain your Telescope, that was made by Mr. Short before 
his Death. His brother who succeeds in the Business has 
fitted it up and compleated it. He has followed the Business 
many Years at Edinburgh, is reckoned very able, and therefore I hope every thing will be found right ; but, as it is only 
just finished, I have no time left to get any philosophical or 
astronomical Friends to examine it, as I intended, the Ship 
being on the Point of sailing, and a future Opportunity uncertain. Enclosed is his Direction-Paper for opening and 
fixing it. 
</p><p>
I have not yet got the Bill of the Price. It is to be made 
from the deceased Mr. Short's ' Book of Memorandums 
of Orders, in which he enter' d this Order of ours and as it is 
supposed, the Price. I do not remember, it is so long since, 
whether it was ^100, or 100 Guineas ; and the Book is in the 
Hands of the Executors as I understand. When I have the 
Account, I shall pay it as I did Bird's for the Transit Instrument, which was 40 Guineas, and then shall apply for the 
whole to Mr. Mauduit. 2 By the way, I wonder that I have 
not heard from you of the Receipt of that Instrument, which 
went from hence in September by Captain Watt. I hope it 
got safe to hand and gave Satisfaction. The Ship was the 
same that Mr. Rogers went in, who I hear is arriv'd ; and by 
him too I sent the Philosophical Transactions, with a Number of Copies of your Paper as printed separately. But I 
have no Letter from you since that by the young Gentleman 
you recommended to me, Grandson to Sir W Pepperell, 
which I think was dated about the Beginning of October, 
when you could not have received them. 
</p><p>
By a late Ship, I sent your College l a Copy of the new Edition of my Philosophical Papers; and others, I think, for 
yourself and for <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>. I should apologize to you 
for inserting therein some part of our Correspondence without first obtaining your Permission; but, as <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a> 
had favoured me with his Consent for what related to 
him, I ventur'd to rely upon your Good-Nature, as to what 
related to you, and I hope you will forgive me. 
</p><p>
I have got from Mr. Ellicot the Glasses, &c. of the long 
Galilean Telescope, which he presents to your College. I 
put them into the Hands of Mr. Nairne, the Optician, to 
examine and put them in Order. I thought to have sent them 
by this Ship, but am disappointed. They shall go by the 
next, if possible. 
</p><p>
There is nothing new here in the philosophical Way at 
present. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere Esteem, I am, Dear Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. There is no Prospect of getting the Duty acts 
repeaPd this Session, if ever. Your steady Resolutions to 
consume no more British Goods may possibly, if persisted in have a good Effect another Year. I apprehend the Parliamentary Resolves and Address will tend to widen the 
Breach. Inclos'd I send you Gov r Pownall's Speech against 
those Resolves ; his name is not to be mentioned. He appears 
to me a hearty Friend to America, tho' I find he is suspected 
by some on account of his Connections.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of Feb y 27th, by Captain Carver, 
and thank you for giving me an Opportunity of being acquainted with so great a Traveller. I shall be glad if I can 
render him any service here.
</p><p>
The Parliament remain fix'd in their Resolution not to 
repeal the Duty Acts this Session, and will rise next Tuesday. 
I hope my Country folks will remain as fix'd in their Resolutions of Industry and Frugality till these Acts are repeaPd. 
And, if I could be sure of that, I should almost wish them 
never to be repealed; being persuaded, that we shall reap 
more solid and extensive Advantages from the steady Practice of those two great Virtues, than we can possibly suffer 
Damage from all the Duties the Parliament of this kingdom 
can levy on us. They flatter themselves you cannot long 
subsist without their Manufactures. They believe you have 
not Virtue enough to persist in such Agreements, they 
imagine the Colonies will differ among themselves, deceive 
and desert one another, and quietly one after the other submit to the Yoke, and return to the Use of British Fineries. 
They think, that, tho' the Men may be contented with homespun stuffs, the Women will never get the better of their 
Vanity and Fondness for English Modes and Gewgaws. 
The ministerial People all talk in this Strain, and many even 
of the Merchants. I have ventured to assert, that they will 
all find themselves mistaken ; and I rely so much on the Spirit 
of my Country, as to be confident I shall not be found a false 
Prophet, tho' at present not believed. 
</p><p>
I hope nothing that has happened, or may happen, will 
diminish in the least our Loyalty to our Sovereign, or Affection for this Nation in general. I can scarcely conceive a 
King of better Dispositions, of more exemplary Virtues, or 
more truly desirous of promoting the Welfare of all his Subjects. The Experience we have had of the Family in the two 
preceding mild Reigns, and the good Temper of our young 
Princes, so far as can yet be discovered, promise us a Continuance of this Felicity. The Body of this People, too, 
is of a noble and generous Nature, loving and honouring the 
Spirit of Liberty, and hating arbitrary Power of all sorts. 
We have many, very many, friends among them. 
</p><p>
But as to the Parliament ! tho' I might excuse that which 
made the Acts, as being surpriz'd & misled into the Measure ; 
I know not how to excuse this, which, under the fullest Conviction of its being a wrong one, resolves to continue it. 
It is decent, indeed, in your publick Papers to speak as you 
do of the "Wisdom and the Justice oj Parliament; 11 but now 
that the Subject is more thoroughly understood, if this new 
Parliament had been really wise, it would not have refused 
even to receive a Petition against the Acts ; and, if it had been 
just, it would have repealed them, and refunded the Money. 
Perhaps it may be wiser and juster another Year, but that 
is not to be depended on. 
</p><p>
If under all the Insults and Oppressions you are now ex
posed to, you can prudently, as you have lately done, continue 
quiet, avoiding Tumults, but still resolutely keeping up your 
Claim and asserting your Rights, you will finally establish 
them, and this military Cloud that now blusters over you will 
pass away, and do no more Harm than a Summer Thunder 
Shower. But the Advantages of your Perseverance in Industry and Frugality will be great and permanent. Your 
Debts will be paid, your Farms will be better improved, 
and yield a greater Produce ; your real Wealth will increase 
in a Plenty of every useful home Production, and all the true 
Enjoyments of Life, even tho' no foreign Trade should be 
allowed you; and this handicraft, shop-keeping State, will, 
for its own sake, learn to behave more civilly to its Customers. 
Your late governor, Mr. Pownall, appears a hearty Friend 
to America. He moved last week for a Repeal of the acts, 
and was seconded by General Conway, Sir George Saville, 
Mr. Jackson, Mr. Trecothic, and others, but did not succeed. 
A Friend has favoured me with a Copy of the Notes taken 
of Mr. PownalPs Speech, which I send you, believing it will 
be agreable to you and some other of our Friends to see 
them. You will observe in some Parts of it the Language 
a Member of Parliament is obliged to hold, on American 
topicks, if he would at all be heard in the House. He has 
given Notice that he will renew the Motion next and every 
Session. All Ireland is strongly in favour of the American 
cause. They have reason to sympathize with us. I send you 
four Pamphlets written in Ireland, or by Irish gentlemen 
here, in which you will find some excellent well-said Things. 
With the greatest Esteem, I am, my dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately

MRS. STEVENSON has executed your order, and sends

something, that was not ready when the box was packed up, 
is enclosed in her letter.

I am now grown too old to be ambitious of such a station, 
as that which you say has been mentioned to you. 2 Repose 
is more fit for me, and much more suitable to my wishes. 
There is no danger of such a thing being offered to me, and

I certainly could not accept it, to act under such instructions, 
as I know must be given with it. So you may be quite easy

Mr. Chronicle: 
</p><p>
SIR : While the public attention is so much turned towards America, every letter from thence that promises new 
information, is pretty generally read. It seems, therefore, 
the more necessary that care should be taken to disabuse the 
public, when those letters contain facts false in themselves, 
and representations injurious to bodies of people, or even to 
private persons. 
</p><p>
In your paper, No. 310, I found an extract of a letter, said 
to be from a gentleman in General Abercrombie's army. 
As there are several strokes in it tending to render the colonies 
despicable, and even odious, to the mother country, which 
may have ill consequences, and no notice having been taken 
of the injuries contained in that letter, other letters of the same 
nature have since been published, permit me to make a few 
observations on it. 
</p><p>
The writer says: "New England was settled by Presbyterians and Independents, who took shelter there from the 
persecutions of Archbishop Laud; they still retain their 
original character; they generally hate the Church of England," says he. It is very true that if some resentment still 
remained for the hardships their fathers suffered, it might 
perhaps be not much wondered at; but the fact is, that the 
moderation of the present Church of England towards dissenters in Old as well as New England, had quite effaced those 
impressions; the dissenters, too, are become less rigid and 
scrupulous, and the good-will between those different bodies 
in that country is now both mutual and equal. 
</p><p>
He goes on: "They came out with a levelling spirit, and 
they retain it. They cannot bear to think that one man 
should be exorbitantly rich, and another poor; so that, except in the seaport towns, there are few great estates among 
them. This equality produces also a rusticity of manners; 
for their language, dress, and in all their behaviour, they are 
</p><p>
more boorish than anything you ever saw in a certain northern 
latitude." One would imagine, from this account, that those 
who were growing poor plundered those who were growing 
rich, to preserve this equality, and that property had no protection; whereas, in fact, it is nowhere more secure than in 
the New England colonies ; the law is nowhere better executed, or justice obtained at less expense. The equality he 
speaks of arises first from a more equal distribution of lands 
by the assemblies in the first settlement than has been practiced in other colonies, where favourites of governors have 
obtained enormous tracts for trifling considerations, to the 
prejudice both of the crown revenues and the public good; 
and secondly, from the nature of their occupation ; husbandmen with small tracts of land, though they may by industry 
maintain themselves and families in mediocrity, having few 
means of acquiring great wealth, especially in a young colony 
that is to be supplied with its clothing and many other expensive articles of consumption from the mother country. 
Their dress the gentleman may be a more critical judge of than 
I pretend to be ; all I know of it is, that they wear the manufacture of Britain, and follow its fashions perhaps too closely, 
every remarkable change in the mode making its appearance 
there within a few months after its invention here ; a natural 
effect of their constant intercourse with England, by ships 
arriving almost every week from the capital, their respect 
for the mother country, and admiration of every thing that 
is British. But as to their language, I must beg this gentleman's pardon, if I differ from him. His ear, accustomed 
perhaps to the dialect practiced in the certain northern 
latitude he mentions, may not be qualified to judge so nicely 
what relates to pure English. And I appeal to all English
men here, who have been acquainted with the Colonists, 
whether it is not a common remark, that they speak the language with such an exactness both of expression and accent, 
that though you may know the natives of several of the counties of England, by peculiarities in their dialect, you cannot 
by that means distinguish a North American. All the new 
books and pamphlets worth reading, that are published here, 
in a few weeks are transmitted and found there, where there 
is not a man or woman born in the country but what can read ; 
and it must, I think, be a pleasing reflection to those who 
write either for the benefit of the present age or of posterity, to find their audience increasing with the increase 
of our colonies, and their language extending itself beyond 
the narrow bounds of these islands, to a continent larger than 
all Europe, and to future empire as fully peopled, which Britain may one day probably possess in those vast western 
regions. 
</p><p>
But the gentleman makes more injurious comparisons than 
these : 
</p><p>
"That latitude," he says, "has this advantage over them, 
that it has produced sharp, acute men, fit for war or learning, 
whereas the others are remarkably simple, or silly, and blunder 
eternally. We have six thousand of their militia, which 
the general would willingly exchange for two thousand regulars. They are forever marring some one or other of our 
plans, when sent to execute them. They can, indeed, some 
of them at least, range in the woods ; but three hundred Indians with their yell throw three thousand of them in panic, 
and then they will leave nothing for the enemy to do, for they 
will shoot one another; and in the woods our regulars are 
afraid to be on a command with them on that very account." 
</p><p>
I doubt, Mr. Chronicle, that this paragraph, when it comes 
to be read in America will have no good effect; and rather 
increase that inconvenient disgust which is too apt to arise 
between the troops of different corps, or countries, who are 
obliged to serve together. Will not a New England officer 
be apt to retort and say, what foundation have you for this 
odious distinction in favour of the officers from your certain 
northern latitude ? They may, as you say, be fit for learning ; 
but, surely, that return of your first general, with a well 
appointed and sufficient force, from his expedition against 
Louisbourg, without so much as seeing the place, is not the 
most shining proof of his talents for war. And no one will 
say his plan was marred by us, for we were not with him. 
Was his successor who conducted the blundering attack, 
and inglorious retreat from <a href='/results.php?city=ticonderoga' rel='city'>Ticonderoga</a>, a New England 
man, or one of that certain latitude? Then as to the comparison between regulars and provincials, will not the latter 
remark that it was two thousand New England provincials, 
with about one hundred and fifty regulars that took the strong 
fort of Beaudejour in the beginning of the war; though in the 
accounts transmitted to the English gazette, the honour was 
claimed by the regulars, and little or no notice taken of the 
others. That it was the provincials who beat General Dieskau with his regulars, Canadians, and "yelling Indians," 
and sent him prisoner to England. That it was a provincialborn officer, with American batteaux-men, that beat the 
French and Indians on Oswego River. That it was the 
same officer, with provincials, who made that long and admirable march into the enemy's country, took and destroyed 
Fort Frontenac, with the whole French fleet on the lakes, 
and struck terror into the heart of Canada. That it was a provincial officer, with provincials only, who made another 
extraordinary march into the enemy's country, surprised and 
destroyed the Indian town of Kittanning, bringing off the 
scalps of their chiefs. That one ranging captain of a few 
provincials, Rogers, has harassed the enemy more on the 
frontiers of Canada, and destroyed more of their men, than; 
the whole army of regulars. That it was the regulars who 
surrendered themselves, with the provincials under their 
command, prisoners of war, almost as soon as they were 
besieged, with the forts, fleets, and all the provisions and 
stores that had been provided and amassed to so immense 
expense at Oswego. That it was the regulars who surrendered Fort William Henry, and suffered themselves tobe butchered and scalped with arms in their hands. That 
it was the regulars under Braddock, who were thrown into 
a panic by the " yells of three or four hundred Indians,"' 
in their confusion shot one another, and, with five times the 
force of the enemy, fled before them, destroying all their own 
stores, ammunition and provisions. These regular gentlemen,, 
will the provincial rangers add, may possibly be afraid, as 
they say they are, to be on a command with us in the woods, 
but when it is considered that, from all past experience, the 
chance of our shooting them is not as one to a hundred, compared with that of their being shot by the enemy, may it 
not be suspected, that what they give as the very account 
of their fear and unwillingness to venture out with us, is only 
the very excuse; and that a concern for their scalps weighs 
more with them than a regard for their honour. 
</p><p>
Such as these, sir, I imagine may be the reflections extorted 
by such provocation from the provincials in general. But 
the New England men in particular will have reason to resent the remark on their reduction of Louisbourg. Your 
writer proceeds: "Indeed they are all very ready to make 
their boast of taking Louisbourg, in <a href='/results.php?year=1745'>1745</a> ; but if people were 
to be acquitted or condemned according to the propriety and 
wisdom of their plans and not according to their success, 
the persons that undertook the siege merited little praise; 
for I have heard officers who assisted at it say, never was 
anything more rash; for had one single part of their plan 
failed, or had the French made the fortieth part of the resistance then that they have made now, every soul of the New 
Englanders must have fallen in the trenches. The garrison 
was weak, sickly, and destitute of provisions, and disgusted, 
and therefore became a ready prey ; and, when they returned 
to France, were decimated for their gallant defence." Where 
then is the glory arising from thence? After denying his 
facts: "that the garrison was weak, wanted provisions, 
made not a fortieth part of the resistance, were decimated," 
&c., the New England men will ask this regular gentleman, 
if the place was well fortified, and had (as it really had) 
a numerous garrison, was it not at least brave to attack it 
with a handful of raw, undisciplined militia ? If the garrison 
was, as you say, "sickly, disgusted, destitute of provisions, 
and ready to become a prey," was it not prudent to seize 
the opportunity, and put the nation in possession of so important a fortress, at so small an expense? So that if you 
will not allow the enterprise to be, as we think it was, both 
brave and prudent, ought you not at least to grant it was 
either one or the other? But is there no merit on this score 
in the people, who, though at first so greatly divided, as to 
the making or forbearing the attempt, that it was carried in 
the affirmative by the small majority of one vote only; yet 
</p><p>
when it was once resolved on, unanimously prosecuted the 
design, and prepared the means with the greatest zeal and 
diligence; so that the whole equipment was completely 
ready before the season would permit the execution ? Is 
there no merit or praise in laying and executing their plan so 
well, that, as you have confessed, not a single part of it failed? 
If the plan was destitute of "propriety and wisdom," would 
it not have required the sharp, acute men of the northern 
latitude to execute it, that by supplying its deficiencies they 
might give it some chance of success? But if such "remarkably silly, simple, blundering mar plans," as you say we are, 
could execute this plan, so that not a single part of it failed, 
does it not at least show that the plan itself must be laid 
with some "wisdom and propriety"? Is there no merit in 
the ardour with which all degrees and ranks of people quitted 
their private affairs and ranged themselves under the banners of their king, for the honour, safety, and advantage of their 
country ? Is there no merit in the profound secrecy guarded 
by a whole people, so that the enemy had not the least intelligence of the design, till they saw the fleet of transports cover 
the sea before their port ? Is there none in the indefatigable 
labour the troops went through during the siege, performing 
the duty both of men and horses ; the hardship they patiently 
suffered for want of tents and other necessaries; the readiness with which they learned to move, direct, and manage 
cannon, raise batteries, and form approaches; the bravery 
with which they sustained sallies; and finally, in their consenting to stay and garrison the place after it was taken, 
absent from their business and families, till troops could be 
brought from England for that purpose, though they undertook the service on a promise of being discharged as soon as 
it was over, were unprovided for so long an absence, and 
actually suffered ten times more loss by mortal sickness 
through want of necessaries, than they suffered from the 
arms of the enemy? The nation, however, had a sense of 
this undertaking different from the unkind one of this gentleman. At the treaty of peace, the possession of Louisbourg 
was found of great advantage to our affairs in Europe; and 
if the brave men that made the acquisition for us were not 
rewarded, at least they were praised. Envy may continue 
a while to cavil and detract, but public virtue will in the end 
obtain esteem; and honest impartiality, in this and future 
ages, will not fail doing justice to merit. 
</p><p>
Your gentleman writer thus decently goes on: "The 
most substantial men of most of the provinces are children 
or grandchildren of those that came here at the king's expense that is, thieves, highwaymen, and robbers." Being 
probably a military gentleman, this, and therefore a person 
of nice honour, if any one should tell him in the plainest 
language that what he here says is an absolute falsehood, 
challenges and cutting of throats might immediately ensue. 
I shall therefore only refer to his own account in this same 
letter, of the peopling of New England, which he says with 
more truth, was by Puritans, who fled thither for shelter 
from the persecutions of Archbishop Laud. Is there not a 
wide difference between removing to a distant country to 
enjoy exercise of religion according to a man's conscience, 
and his being transported thither by law, as a punishment 
for his crimes? This contradiction we therefore leave the 
gentleman and himself to settle as well as they can between 
them. One would think from his account that the provinces 
were so many colonies from Newgate. The truth is, not only Laud's persecution, but the other public troubles in the following reigns, induced many thousand families to leave 
England and settle in the plantations. During the predominance of the Parliament many Royalists removed or were 
banished to Virginia and Barbadoes, who afterward spread 
into other settlements. The Catholics sheltered themselves 
in Maryland. At the Restoration many of the deprived 
non-conformist ministers, with their families, friends, and 
hearers, went over. Towards the end of Charles the Second's 
reign, and during James the Second's, the dissenters again 
flocked into America, driven by persecution, and dreading 
the introduction at home. Then the high price or reward 
of labour in the colonies and want of artisans there drew 
over many, as well as the occasion of commerce ; and when 
once people begin to migrate, every one has his little sphere 
of acquaintance and connections, which he draws after him 
by invitation, motives of interest, praising his new settlement, 
and other encouragements. The "most substantial men" 
are descendants of those early settlers, newcomers not having 
yet had time to raise estates. The practice of sending convicts thither is modern; and the same indolence of temper 
and habits of idleness that make people poor and tempt 
them to steal in England continue with them when they are 
sent to America, and must there have the same effects, where 
all who live well owe their subsistence to labour and business, 
and where it is a thousand times more difficult than here to 
acquire wealth without industry. Hence the instances of 
transported thieves advancing their fortunes in the colonies 
are extremely rare; if there really is a single instance of it, 
which I very much doubt ; but of their being advanced there 
to the gallows the instances are plenty. Might they not as 
well have been hanged at home ? We call Britain the mother 
country ; but what good mother would introduce thieves and 
criminals into the company of her children to corrupt and disgrace them ? And how cruel is it to force, by the high hand 
of power, a particular country of your subjects, who have not 
deserved such usage, to receive your outcasts, repealing all the 
laws they make to prevent their admission, and then reproach 
them with the detested mixture you have made! "Their 
emptying their jails into our settlements," says a writer 
of that country, "is an insult and contempt, the cruellest 
perhaps that ever one people offered to another, and would 
not be equalled even by emptying their Jakes on tables." 
</p><p>
The letter I have been considering, Mr. Chronicle, is followed by another in your paper of Tuesday, the 17th, past, 
said to be from an officer who attended Brigadier-General Forbes, in his march from <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a> to Fort DuQuesne, 
but written probably by the same gentleman who wrote the 
former, as it seems calculated to raise the character of the 
officers of the certain northern latitude, at the expense of the 
reputation of the colonies and the provincial forces. According to this letter- writer, if the Pennsylvanians granted large 
supplies and raised a great body of troops for the last campaign, this was not on account of Mr. Pitt's zeal for the king's 
service, or even a regard for their own safety; but it was 
owing to the "general's proper management of the Quakers 
and other parties in the province." The withdrawing the 
Indians from the French interest, by negotiating a peace, is 
all ascribed to the general, and not a word said of the honour 
of the poor Quakers, who first set these negotiations on foot, 
or of honest Frederick Post, that completed them with so 
much ability and success. Even the little merit of the As
sembly's making a law to regulate carriages is imputed to 
the general's "multitude of letters." Then he tells us "innumerable scouting parties had been sent out during a long 
period, both by the general and Colonel Bouquet, towards 
Fort DuQuesne, to catch a prisoner, if possible, for intelligence, but never got any." How happened that? Why, 
"it was the provincial troops that were constantly employed 
in that service," and they, it seems, never do anything they 
are ordered to do. That, however, one would think might 
be easily remedied, by sending regulars with them, who, of 
course, must command them, and may see that they do their 
duty. No ; the regulars are afraid of being shot by the provincials in a panic. Then send all regulars. Aye ; that was 
what the colonel resolved upon. "Intelligence was now 
wanted [says the letter writer]. Col. Bouquet, whose attention to business was [only] very considerable [that is, not 
quite so great as the general's, for he was not of the northern 
latitude], was determined to send no more provincials 
a- scouting." And how did he execute his determination? 
Why, by sending "Major Grant, of the Highlanders, with 
seven hundred men, three hundred of them Highlanders, 
the rest Americans, Virginians, and Pennsylvanians." No 
blunder this in our writer, but a misfortune; and he is, 
nevertheless, one of those "acute sharp" men who are "fit 
for learning." And how did this major and seven hundred 
men succeed in catching the prisoner? Why, their "march 
to Fort DuQuesne was so conducted the surprise was complete." Perhaps you may imagine, gentle reader, that this 
was a surprise of the enemy. No such matter. They knew 
every step of his motions, and had, every man of them, left 
their fires and huts in the fields, and retired into the fort. 
</p><p>
But the major and his seven hundred men, they were surprised, first to find nobody there at night, and next to find 
themselves surrounded and cut to pieces in the morning, two 
or three hundred being killed, drowned, or taken prisoners, 
and among the latter the major himself. Those who escaped 
were also surprised at their own good fortune ; and the whole 
army was surprised at the major's bad management. Thus 
the surprise was indeed complete, but not the disgrace; for 
provincials were there to lay the blame on. The misfortune 
(we must not call it misconduct) of the major was owing, it 
seems, to an unnamed and, perhaps, unknown provincial 
officer, who, it is said, "disobeyed his orders and quitted his 
post." Whence a formal conclusion is drawn, " that a planter 
is not to be taken from the plough and made an officer on a 
day." Unhappy provincials ! If success attends where you 
are joined with the regulars, they claim all the honour, though 
not a tenth part of your number. If disgrace, it is all yours, 
though you happen to be a small part of the whole, and have 
not the command; as if regulars were in their nature invincible when not mixed with provincials, and provincials of no 
kind of value without regulars. Happy is it for you that you 
were neither present at Prestonpans nor Falkirk, at the faint 
attempt against Rochfort, the rout of St. Cas, or the hasty 
retreat from Martinico. Every thing that went wrong, or 
did not go right, would have been ascribed to you. Our 
commanders would have been saved the labour of writing 
long apologies for their conduct. It might have been sufficient to say, provincials were with us.

DEAR POLLEY, 
</p><p>
Agreable to your Orders, delivered to me very punctually 
by Temple, I return you enclosed Voltaire's Verses. The 
Translation I think full as good as the Original. Remember 
that I am to have them again. 
</p><p>
I take this Opportunity to send you, also, a late Paper, containing a melancholy Account of the Distresses of some Seamen. You will observe in it the Advantages they received 
from wearing their Clothes constantly wet with Salt Water, 
under the total Want of fresh Water to drink. You may 
remember I recommended this Practice many years ago. 
Do you know Dr. Len, and did you communicate it to him? 
I fancy his Name is wrong spelt in this Paper, and that it 
should be Lind, having seen in the Review some Extracts 
from a book on Sea- Diseases, published within these 2 or 3 
Years, by one Dr. Lind ; 2 but I have not seen the Book, 
and know not whether such a Passage be in it. 
</p><p>
I need not point out to you an Observation in favour of 
our Doctrine, that you will make on reading this Paper, 
that, having little to eat y these poor People in wet Clothes Day 
and Night caught no Cold.

My respects to your Aunt, and love to all that love you.

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I received yours of the i8th of April, enclosing copies of 
the articles of your agreements with respect to importation, 
and of your letter to the merchants here. The letter was published, and universally spoken well of, as a well written, sensible, manly, and spirited performance; and I believe the 
publication has been of service to our cause. You are in my 
opinion perfectly right in your supposition, that "the redress of American grievances likely to be proposed by the 
ministry will at first only be partial; and that it is intended 
to retain some of the revenue duties, in order to establish a 
right of Parliament to tax the colonies." But I hope, that, 
by persisting steadily in the measure you have so laudably 
entered into, you will, if backed by the general honest resolution of the people to buy British goods of no others, but to 
manufacture for themselves, or use colony manufactures 
only, be the means, under God, of recovering and establishing the freedom of our country entire, and of handing it down 
complete to posterity. 
</p><p>
And in the mean time the country will be enriched by its 
industry and frugality. These virtues will become habitual. 
Farms will be more improved, better stocked, and rendered 
more productive by the money that used to be spent in superfluities. Our artificers of every kind will be enabled to carry 
on their business to more advantage; gold and silver will 
become more plenty among us, and trade will revive, after 
things shall be well settled, and become better and safer 
than it has lately been ; for an industrious, frugal people are 
best able to buy, and pay best for what they purchase. With 
great regard, I have the honour to be, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
It is with great pleasure I understand by your favour of 
April loth, that you continue to enjoy so good a share of 
health. I hope it will long continue. And, although it may 
not now be suitable for you to make such wide excursions 
as heretofore, you may yet be very useful to your country 
and to mankind, if you sit down quietly at home, digest the 
knowledge you have acquired, and compile and publish the 
many observations you have made, and point out the advantages that may be drawn from the whole, in public undertakings or particular private practice. It is true, many people are fond of accounts of old buildings, and monuments; 
but there is a number, who would be much better pleased 
with such accounts as you could afford them. And, for one, 
I confess, that if I could find in any Italian travels a receipt 
for making Parmesan cheese, it would give me more satisfaction than a transcript of any inscription from any old stone 
whatever. 
</p><p>
I suppose Mr. Michael Collinson, or Dr. Fothergill, has 
written to you what may be necessary for your information 
relating to your affairs here. I imagine there is no doubt 
but the King's bounty to you will be continued ; and that it 
will be proper for you to continue sending now and then a 
few such curious seeds, as you can procure, to keep up your 
claim. And now I mention seeds, I wish you would send me 
a few of such as are least common, to the value of a guinea, 
which Mr. Foxcroft will pay you for me. They are for a 
particular friend, who is very curious. If in any thing I can 
serve you here, command freely. Your affectionate friend, 
</p><p>

I am honoured with yours of May loth, and agree with you 
perfectly in your sentiments of public affairs. Government 
here seems now to be growing more moderate with regard to 
America, and I am persuaded, that, by a steady, prudent 
conduct, we shall finally obtain all our important points, 
and establish American liberty on a clearer and firmer foundation. The folly of the late measures begins to be seen and 
understood at court; their promoters grow out of credit, 
and the trading part of the nation, with the manufacturers, 
are become sensible how necessary it is for their welfare to be 
on good terms with us. The petitioners of Middlesex and of 
London have numbered among their grievances the unconstitutional taxes on America, and similar petitions are expected 
from all quarters. So that I think we need only be quiet, 
and persevere in our schemes of frugality and industry, 
and the rest will do itself.

Your governor is recalled, and it is said the commissioners 
will follow soon, or be new modelled with some more men of

am, with the greatest esteem and regard, dear Sir, &c.

JUST come home from a Venison Feast, where I have drank more than a Philosopher ought, I find my dear Polly's chearful, chatty Letter, that exhilirates me more than all the Wine. 
</p><p>
Your good Mother says there is no Occasion for any Intercession of mine in your behalf. She is sensible that she is 
more in fault than her Daughter. She received an affectionate, tender Letter from you, and she has not answered it, 
tho' she intended to do it; but her Head, not her Heart, 
has been bad, and unfitted her for Writing. She owns, that 
she is not so good a Subject as you are, and that she is more 
unwilling to pay Tribute to Cesar, and has less Objection 
to Smuggling; but 'tis not, she says, mere Selfishness or 
Avarice ; 'tis rather an honest Resentment at the Waste of 
those Taxes in Pensions, Salaries, Perquisites, Contracts, 
and other Emoluments for the Benefit of People she does 
not love, and who do not deserve such Advantages, because I suppose because they are not of her Party. 
</p><p>
Present my Respects to your good Landlord and his Family. 
I honour them for their conscientious Aversion to illicit 
Trading. There are those in the World, who would not 
wrong a Neighbour, but make no Scruple of cheating the 
King. The Reverse, however, does not hold; for whoever 
scruples cheating the King, will certainly not wrong his 
Neighbour. 
</p><p>
You ought not to wish yourself an Enthusiast. They 
have, indeed, their imaginary Satisfactions and Pleasures, 
but these are often ballanc'd by imaginary Pains and Mortifications. You can continue to be a good Girl, and thereby 
lay a solid Foundation for expected future Happiness, without 
the Enthusiasm that may perhaps be necessary to some others. 
As those Beings, who have a good sensible Instinct, have no 
need of Reason, so those, who have Reason to regulate their 
Actions, have no Occasion for Enthusiasm. However, there 
are certain Circumstances in Life, sometimes, wherein 'tis 
perhaps best not to hearken to Reason. For instance; possibly, if the Truth were known, I have Reason to be jealous 
of this same insinuating, handsome young Physician; but, 
as it flatters more my Vanity, and therefore gives me more 
Pleasure, to suppose you were in Spirits on ace' of my safe 
Return, I shall turn a deaf Ear to Reason in this Case, as 
I have done with Success in twenty others. But I am sure 
you will always give me Reason enough to continue ever your

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have now before me your favours of June nth and July 
15th. I thank you for communicating to me the observations of the transit made by Messrs. Biddle and Bayley. I 
gave them immediately to Mr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer 
Royal, who will compare and digest the whole received from 
different parts of the world, and report thereon to the Royal 
Society. They are the only ones I have received from our 
Society ; those made by the others were sent to Mr. Penn. 
Being last week with Mr. Maskelyne, at Flamsteed House, I 
found he had got them. I shall send him to-day the corrected account, which I have since received from you by way 
of Liverpool. 
</p><p>
I should be very sorry that any thing of party remained in 
The American Philosophical Society after the union. Here 
the Royal Society is of all parties, but party is entirely out of 
the question in all our proceedings. 
</p><p>
It grieves me to hear that our friend Galloway is in so bad a state of health. He should make a long journey, or take a 
sea voyage. I wish he would come to London for the winter. 
</p><p>
<a href='/results.php?tla=pah' rel=''>Mr. Henry</a>'s Register, which you communicated to me last 
year, is thought a very ingenious one, and will be published 
here, though it has long been delayed. I have not seen Mrs. 
Dowell. I suppose she is not yet come to town. At least I 
have not heard of her being here, though possibly she might 
while I was in France. 
</p><p>
Our friend W ,' who is always complaining of a constant fever, looks nevertheless fresh and jolly, and does not 
fall away in the least. He was saying the other day at <a href='/results.php?city=richmond' rel='city'>Richmond</a>, (where we were together dining with Governor 
Pownall,) that he had been pestered with a fever almost continually for these three years past, and that it gave way to 
no medicines, all he had taken, advised by different physicians, 
having never any effect towards removing it. On which I 
asked him, if it was not now time to inquire, whether he had 
really any fever at all. He is indeed the only instance I ever 
knew, of a man's growing fat upon a fever. But I see no 
occasion for reading him the lecture you desired, for he appears to me extremely temperate in his eating and drinking. 
His affairs here are I think in a good train, but every thing 
to be transacted in our great offices requires time. I suppose 
he will hardly be able to return before the spring. 
</p><p>
By a ship just sailed from hence, (the captain a stranger, 
whose name I have forgotten,) I send you a late French 
treatise on the management of silkworms. It is said to be 
the best hitherto published, being written in the silk country 
by a gentleman well acquainted with the whole affair. It 
seems to me to be, like many other French writings, rather too much drawn out in words ; but some extracts from it, of the 
principal directions, might be of use, if you would translate 
and publish them. I think the bounty is offered for silk from 
all the colonies in general. I will send you the act. But I 
believe it must be wound from the cocoons, and sent over in 
skeins. The cocoons would spoil on the passage, by the dead 
worm corrupting and staining the silk. A public filature 
should be set up for winding them there ; or every family 
should learn to wind their own. In Italy they are all brought 
to market, from the neighbouring country, and bought up by 
those that keep the filatures. In Sicily each family winds 
its own silk, for the sake of having the remains to card and 
spin for family use. If some provision were made by the 
Assembly for promoting the growth of mulberry trees in all 
parts of the province, the culture of silk might afterwards 
follow easily. For the great discouragement to breeding 
worms at first is the difficulty of getting leaves and the being 
obliged to go far for them. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt with me but that it might succeed in our 
country. It is the happiest of all inventions for clothing. 
Wool uses a good deal of land to produce it, which, if employed 
in raising corn, would afford much more subsistence for man, 
than the mutton amounts to. Flax and hemp require good 
land, impoverish it, and at the same time permit it to produce 
no food at all. But mulberry trees may be planted in hedgerows on walks or avenues, or for shade near a house, where 
nothing else is wanted to grow. The food for the worms, 
which produce the silk, is in the air, and the ground under the 
trees may still produce grass, or some other vegetable good 
for man or beast. Then the wear of silken garments continues so much longer, from the strength of the materials, as to give it greatly the preference. Hence it is that the most 
populous of all countries, China, clothes its inhabitants with 
silk, while it feeds them plentifully, and has besides a vast 
quantity both raw and manufactured to spare for exportation. 
Raw silk here, in skeins well wound, sells from twenty to 
twenty-five shillings per pound; but, if badly wound, is not 
worth five shillings. Well wound is, when the threads are 
made to cross each other every way in the skein, and only 
touch where they cross. Badly wound is, when they are laid 
parallel to each other ; for so they are glued together, break 
in unwinding them, and take a vast deal of time more than 
the other, by losing the end every time the thread breaks. 
When once you can raise plenty of silk, you may have manufactures enough from hence. With great esteem, I am, my 
dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
Having this Opportunity by M. Le Roy, I embrace it to thank you most heartily for the many Civilities & Marks of 
Friendship I received from you & Mad. Dalibard, while in Paris; & to express my sincere & cordial Wishes for your 
Health & Prosperity : in which I am joined by my Friend Sir John Pringle. 
</p><p>
As I cannot soon again enjoy the Happiness of being personally in your Company, permit my Shadow to pay my 
Respects to you. J Tis from a Plate my Son caus'd to be engrav'd some Years since. With the greatest Esteem & 
Respect, I have the honour to be, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Servant

Your favour of Aug' 3d has given me great Pleasure. I 
have only time now to acknowledge the Receipt of it, but 
purpose to write fully by the next Opportunity. I am just 
returned from France, where I found our Dispute much 
attended to, several of our Pamphlets being translated and 
printed there, among the rest my Examination and the 
Farmer's Letters? with two of my Pieces annexed, of which 
last I send you a Copy. In short, all Europe (except Britain) 
appears to be on our side the question. But Europe has its 
Reasons. It fancies itself in some Danger from the Growth 
of British Power, and would be glad to see it divided against 
itself. Our prudence will, I hope, long postpone the Satisfaction our Enemies expect from our Dissensions. With 
sincere and great Esteem, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Serv'

SIR : Discoursing with Captain Folger, a very intelligent 
Mariner of the Island of Nantucket, in New England, concerning the long Passages made by some ships bound from 
England to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, I received from him the following Information, viz., 
</p><p>
That the Island in which he lives is inhabited chiefly by 
People concerned in the Whale Fishery, in which they employed near 150 Sail of Vessels; that the Whales are found 
generally near the Edges of the Gulph Stream, a strong Current so called, which comes out of the Gulph of Florida, 
passing Northeasterly along the Coast of America, and then 
turning off most Easterly, running at the rate of 4, 3^, 3, and 
2 J Miles an Hour. That the Whaling Business leading these 
People to cruise along the Edges of the Stream in quest of 
Whales, they are become better acquainted with the Course, 
Breadth, Strength, and Extent of the same, than those Navigators can well be who only cross it in their Voyages to and 
from America, that they have Opportunities of discovering the 
strength of it when their Boats are out in the pursuit of this 
Fish, and happen to get into the Stream while the Ship is out 
of it, or out of the Stream while the Ship is in it, for then they 
are separated very fast, and would soon loose sight of each 
other if care were not taken that in crossing the Stream to 
and fro, they frequently in the same meet and speak with 
Ships bound from England to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>, Virginia, &c. who 
have Passages of 8, 9, and 10 weeks and are still far from 
Land, and not likely to be in with it for some time, being engaged in that part of the Stream that sets directly against 
them, and it is supposed that their Fear of Cape Sable 
Shoals, George's Banks, or Nantucket Shoals, hath induced 
them to keep so far to the southward as unavoidably to engage them in the said Gulph Stream, which occasions the 
length of their Voyage, since in a Calm it carries them directly 
back, and tho' they may have fair Winds, yet the Current 
being 60 or 70 Miles a Day, is so much subtracted from the 
way they make thro' the Water. At my request Captain 
Folger hath been so obliging as to mark for me on a Chart 
the Dimensions, Course and Swiftness of the Stream from 
its first coming out of the Gulph when it is narrowest and 
strongest, until it turns away to go to the southward of the 
Western Islands, where it is Broader and Weaker, and to 
give me withall some written Directions whereby Ships 
bound from the Banks of Newfoundland to <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> may 
avoid the said Stream ; and yet be free of Danger from the 
Banks and Shoals above mentioned. As I apprehend that 
such Chart and Directions may be of use to our Packets in 
shortning their Voyages, I send them to you, that if their 
Lordships should think fit, so much of the Chart as is contained within the Red Lines may be engraved, and printed, 
together with the Remarks, at the Charge of the Office; or 
at least the Manuscript Copies may be made of the same for 
the use of the Packets. The Expence of the former would not 
much exceed the latter and would besides be of general Service. 
</p><p>
With much Esteem, I am, etc.

Craven Street,  [<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a>], Sat. eve. past ten. [<a href='/results.php?year=1769' rel="origin">1769</a>] 
</p><p>
Ax length I have found an Hour, in which I think I may 
chat with my dear good Girl, free from Interruption. 
</p><p>
The Attention you have always shown to everything you 
think agreable to me, demands my most grateful Acknowledgements. I have received the Garters you have so kindly 
knit for me ; they are of the only Sort that I can wear, having 
worn none of any kind for 20 Years, till you began to supply 
me; but besides their Usefulness, these appear to me the 
finest, neatest, and prettiest that were ever made ! 
</p><p>
Accept my heartiest Thanks, and be assured that I shall 
think as often of you in the Wearing, as you did of me in the 
Making them. 
</p><p>
The Question you ask me is a very sensible one, and I shall 
be glad if I can give you a satisfactory Answer. There are 
two Ways of contracting a Chimney ; one, by contracting the 
Opening before the Fire ; the other, by contracting the Funnel 
above the Fire. If the Funnel above the Fire is left open in its 
full Dimensions, and the Opening before the Fire is contracted ; then the Coals, I imagine, will burn faster, because 
more Air is directed through the Fire, and in a stronger 
Stream; that Air which before pass'd over it, and on each 
side of it, now passing thro it. This is seen in narrow Stove 
Chimneys, when a Sacheverell or Blower is used, which still 
more contracts the narrow Opening. But if the Funnel only 
above the Fire is contracted, then, as a less Stream of Air is passing up the Chimney, less must pass thro' the Fire, and 
consequently it should seem that the Consuming of the Coals 
would rather be checked than augmented by such Contraction. 
And this will also be the Case, when both the Opening before 
the Fire, and the Funnel above the Fire are contracted, provided the Funnel above the Fire is more contracted in Proportion than the Opening before the Fire. 
</p><p>
So you see I think you had the best of the Argument ; and, 
as you notwithstanding gave it up in Complaisance to the 
Company, I think you had also the best of the Dispute. 
There are few, tho' convinced, that know how to give up, even 
an Error, they have been once engag'd in maintaining ; there 
is therefore the more Merit in dropping a Contest where one 
thinks one's self right ; 'tis at least respectful to those we converse with. And indeed all our Knowledge is so imperfect, 
and we are from a thousand Causes so perpetually subject to 
Mistake and Error, that Positiveness can scarce ever become 
even the most knowing; and Modesty in advancing any 
Opinion, however plain and true we may suppose it, is always 
decent, and generally more likely to procure assent. Pope's 
Rule, 
</p><p>
" To speak, tho' sure, with seeming Diffidence," 
</p><p>
is therefore a good one ; and, if I had ever seen in your Conversation the least Deviation from it, I should earnestly 
recommend it to your Observation.
</p><p>
I am, &c.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Being just returned to Town from a little excursion, I find 
yours of the 22 d , containing a number of Queries, that would 
require a Pamphlet to answer them fully. You, however, 
desire only brief Answers, which I shall endeavour to give 
you. 
</p><p>
Previous to your Queries, you tell me that you apprehend 
his Majesty's Servants have now "in Contemplation, First, 
to relieve the Colonists from the Taxes complained of; And 
2 J ly, to preserve the Honor, the Dignity, and the Supremacy 
of the British Legislature over all his Majesty's Dominions." 
I hope your Information is good, and that what you suppose 
to be in Contemplation, will be carried into Execution, by 
repealing all the Laws that have been made for raising a 
Revenue in America, by Authority of Parliament, without 
the Consent of the People there. The Honor and Dignity 
of the British Legislature will not be hurt by such an Act of 
Justice and Wisdom. The wisest Councils are liable to be 
misled, especially in Matters remote from their Inspection. 
It is the Persisting in an Error, not the Correcting it, that 
lessens the Honor of any Man or Body of Men. 
</p><p>
The Supremacy of that Legislature, I believe, will be best 
preserved by making a very sparing use of it, never, but for 
the evident good of the Colonies themselves, or of the whole 
British Empire, never, for the partial Advantage of Britain, 
to their Prejudice: By such prudent Conduct, I imagine 
that Supremacy may be gradually strengthened, and in Time 
fully established; but otherwise, I apprehend it will be disputed, and lost in the Dispute. At present the Colonies consent and submit to it for the Regulations of general Commerce ; but a Submission to Acts of Parliament was no part 
of their original Constitution. Our former Kings governed 
their Colonies, as they had governed their Dominions in 
France, without the Participation of British Parliaments. 
The Parliament of England never presumed to interfere with 
that Prerogative, till the Time of the great Rebellion, when 
they usurped the Government of all the King's other Dominions, Ireland, Scotland, &c. The Colonies that held for the 
King, they conquered by Force of Arms, and governed after
wards as conquered Countries; but New England, having not opposed the Parliament, was considered and treated as a 
Sister-Kingdom in Amity with England, as appears by the Journals, March noth, <a href='/results.php?year=1642'>1642</a>. 
</p><p>
" i. Will not a repeal of all the duties (that on Tea excepted, 
which was before paid here on Exportation, and of course no 
new Imposition,) fully satisfy the Colonists?" 
</p><p>
Answer. I think not. 
</p><p>
"2. Your reasons for that Opinion?" 
</p><p>
A. Because it is not the Sum paid in that Duty on Tea, 
that is complained of as a burthen, but the Principle of the 
Act expressed in the preamble ; viz. that those Duties were 
laid for the better Support of Government, and the Administration of Justice, in the Colonies. This the Colonists think 
unnecessary, unjust, and dangerous to their most important 
Rights. Unnecessary, because in all the Colonies (two or 
three new ones are excepted) 2 Government and the Administration of Justice were, and always had been, well supported 
without any Charge to Britain; unjust, as it has made such 
Colonies liable to pay such Charge for others, in which they 
had no Concern or Interest ; dangerous, as such Mode of raising Money for those Purposes tended to render their Assemblies useless ; for, if a Revenue could be raised in the Colonies 
for all the Purposes of Government by Act of Parliament, 
without Grants from the People there, Governors, who do not 
</p><p>
1 "Men may lose little property by an act which takes away all their 
freedom. When a man is robbed of a trifle on the highway, it is not the two 
pence lost that makes the capital outrage. Would twenty shillings have 
ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No! but the payment of half twenty 
shillings, on the principle it was demanded, would have made him a slave." 
See Mr. Burke's Speeches in <a href='/results.php?year=1774'>1774</a> and <a href='/results.php?year=1775'>1775</a>. V. 
</p><p>
2 Nova Scotia, Georgia, the Floridas, and Canada. 
generally love Assemblies, would never call them. They 
would be laid aside ; and, when nothing should depend on the 
people's good Will to Government, their Rights would be 
trampled on ; they would be treated with Contempt. 
</p><p>
Another Reason why I think they would not be satisfied 
with such a partial Repeal is, that their Agreements not to 
import till the Repeal takes place, include the whole, which 
shows that they object to the whole, and those Agreements 
will continue binding on them if the whole is not repealed. 
</p><p>
"3. Do you think the only effectual Way of composing the 
present Differences is, to put the Americans precisely in the 
Situation they were in before the passing of the late Stamp 
Act ? " 
</p><p>
A. I think so. 
</p><p>
"4. Your Reasons for that Opinion?" 
</p><p>
A. Other Methods have been tried. They have been 
rebuk'd in angry Letters. Their Petitions have been refused 
or rejected by Parliament. They have been threatened with 
the punishment of Treason by Resolves of both Houses. 
Their Assemblies have been dissolved, and Troops have 
been sent among them; but all these Ways have only exasperated their Minds and widened the Breach. Their Agreements to use no more British Manufactures have been 
strengthened; and these Measures, instead of composing 
Differences, and promoting a good Correspondence, have 
almost annihilated your Commerce with those Countries, and 
greatly endangered the national Peace and general Welfare. 
</p><p>
"5. If this last Method is deemed by the Legislature and 
his Majesty's Ministers to be repugnant to their duty, as 
Guardians of the just Rights of the Crown and of their Fellow 
Subjects, can you suggest any other way of terminating these 
Disputes, consistent with the Ideas of Justice and Propriety conceived by the King's Subjects on both sides of the Atlantic?" 
</p><p>
A. I do not see how that Method can be deemed repugnant to the Rights of the Crown. If the Americans are put 
into their former Situation, it must be by an Act of Parliament ; in the passing of which by the King, the Rights of the 
Crown are exercised, not infringed. It is indifferent to the 
Crown whether the Aids received from America are granted 
by Parliament here, or by the Assemblies there, provided 
the quantum be the same ; and it is my Opinion, that more 
will be generally granted there voluntarily, than can ever be 
exacted or collected from thence by Authority of Parliament. 
</p><p>
As to the Rights of Fellow Subjects (I suppose you mean the 
People of Britain), I cannot conceive how those will be infringed by that Method. They will still enjoy the Right of 
granting their own Money, and may still, if it pleases them, 
keep up their Claim to the right of granting Ours; a Right 
they can never exercise properly, for Want of a sufficient 
Knowledge of us, our Circumstances and Abilities, (to say 
nothing of the little Likelihood there is that we should ever 
submit to it,) therefore a Right that can be of no good Use 
to them; and we shall continue to enjoy in fact the Right of 
granting our Money, with the Opinion now universally prevailing among us, that we are free subjects of the King, and 
that Fellow Subjects of one part of his Dominions are not 
Sovereigns over Fellow Subjects in any other part. 
</p><p>
If the Subjects on the different Sides of the Atlantic have 
different and opposite Ideas of "Justice and Propriety," no 
one "Method" can possibly be consistent with both. The 
best will be, to let each enjoy their own Opinions, without disturbing them, when they do not interfere with the common Good. 
</p><p>
"6. And, if this Method were actually followed, do you not 
think it would encourage the violent and factious Part of the 
Colonists to aim at still farther Concessions from the Mother 
Country?" 
</p><p>
A. I do not think it would. There may be a few among 
them, that deserve the Name of factious and violent, as there 
are in all Countries ; but these would have little Influence, if 
the great Majority of sober, reasonable People were satisfied. 
If any Colony should happen to think that some of your Regulations of Trade are inconvenient to the general Interest of the 
Empire, or prejudicial to them without being beneficial to 
you, they will state these Matters to the Parliament in Petitions as heretofore ; but will, I believe, take no violent Steps 
to obtain what they may hope for in Time from the wisdom 
of Government here. I know of nothing else they can have 
in view ; the Notion that prevails here of their being desirous 
to set up a Kingdom or Commonwealth of their own, is, to 
my certain Knowledge, entirely groundless. 
</p><p>
I therefore think, that, on a total Repeal of all Duties, laid 
expressly for the Purpose of raising a Revenue on the People 
of America without their Consent, the present Uneasiness 
would subside; the Agreements not to import would be dissolved ; and the Commerce flourish as heretofore ; and I am 
confirmed in this Sentiment by all the Letters I have received 
from America, and by the Opinions of all the sensible People 
who have lately come from thence, Crown Officers excepted. 
</p><p>
I know, indeed, that the People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> are grievously 
offended by the Quartering of Troops among them, as they 
think, contrary to Law and are very angry with the Board of 
</p><p>
Commissioners, who have calumniated them to Government ; 
but, as I suppose withdrawing of those Troops may be a Consequence of reconciliating Measures taking place; and that 
the Commission also will either be desolved, if found useless, 
or filled with more temperate and prudent Men, if still deemed 
useful and necessary; I do not imagine these Particulars 
would prevent a Return of the Harmony so much to be 
wished. 
</p><p>
"7. If they are relieved in part only, what do you, as a 
reasonable and dispassionate Man, and an equal Friend to 
both Sides, imagine will be the probable Consequences?" 
</p><p>
A. I imagine, that repealing the offensive Duties in part 
will answer no end to this Country; the Commerce will 
remain obstructed, and the Americans go on with their 
Schemes of Frugality, Industry, and Manufactures, to their 
own great Advantage. How much that may tend to the 
Prejudice of Britain, I cannot say; perhaps not so much as 
some apprehend, since she may in time find new Markets. 
But I think, if the Union of the two Countries continues to 
subsist, it will not hurt the general Interest; for whatever 
Wealth Britain loses by the Failing of its Trade with the 'Colonies, America will gain; and the Crown will receive equal 
Aids from its Subjects upon the whole, if not greater. 
</p><p>
And now I have answered your Questions as to what may 
be, in my Opinion, the Consequences of this or that supposed 
Measure, I will go a little farther, and tell you what I fear is 
more likely to come to pass in Reality. I apprehend that the 
Ministry, at least the American Part of it, being fully persuaded of the Right of Parliament, think it ought to be enforced, whatever may be the Consequences ; and at the same 
time do not believe, there is even now any Abatement of the 
Trade between the two Countries on account of these Disputes ; or that, if there is, it is small, and cannot long continue. 
</p><p>
They are assured by the Crown Officers in America, that 
Manufactures are impossible there; that the Discontented 
are few, and persons of little Consequence; that almost 
all the People of Property and Importance are satisfied, and 
disposed to submit quietly to the taxing Power of Parliament ; and that, if the Revenue Acts are continued, and those 
Duties only that are called anti-commercial be repealed, and 
others perhaps laid instead; that Power will ere long be 
patiently submitted to, and the Agreements not to import 
be broken, when they are found to produce no Change of 
Measures here. 
</p><p>
From these and similar Misinformations, which seem to 
be credited, I think it likely that no thorough Redress of 
Grievances will be afforded to America this Session. This 
may inflame Matters still more in that Country ; farther rash 
Measures there may create more Resentment here, that may 
produce not merely ill-advised and useless Dissolutions of 
their Assemblies, as last year, but Attempts to dissolve their 
Constitutions; more Troops may be sent over, which will 
create more Uneasiness; to justify the Measures of Government, your Writers will revile the Americans in your Newspapers, as they have already begun to do; treating them as 
Miscreants, Rogues, Dastards, Rebels, &c., which will tend 
farther to alienate the minds of the people here from them, and 
diminish their Affections to this Country. Possibly, too, 
some of their warm Patriots may be distracted enough to 
expose themselves by some mad Action to be sent for hither ; 
and Government here be indiscreet enough to hang them, on 
the Act of Henry the Eighth. 
</p><p>
Mutual Provocations will thus go on to complete the Separation ; and instead of that cordial Affection that once and so 
long existed, and that Harmony, so suitable to the Circumstances, and so necessary to the Happiness, Strength, Safety, 
and Welfare of both Countries; an implacable Malice and 
mutual Hatred, such as we now see subsisting between the 
Spaniards and Portuguese, the Genoese and Corsicans, from 
the same original Misconduct in the superior Governments, 
will take Place; the Sameness of Nation, the Similarity of 
Religion, Manners, and Language not in the least preventing 
in our Case, more than it did in theirs. 
</p><p>
I hope, however, that this may all prove false Prophecy, 
and that you and I may live to see as sincere and perfect a 
Friendship established between our respective Countries, as 
has so many years subsisted between Mr. Strahan and his truly affectionate old Friend,

MY EVER DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of November 2Qth, with the 
parcel of seeds, for which I am greatly obliged to you. I cannot make you adequate returns in kind ; but I send you however some of the true rhubarb seed, which you desire. I had 
it from Mr. English, who lately received a medal of the 
Society of Arts for propagating it. I send also some green 
dry peas, highly esteemed here as the best for making pea 
soup ; and also some Chinese caravances, with Father Navarrete's ' account of the universal use of a cheese made of them 
in China, which so excited my curiosity, that I caused inquiry 
to be made of Mr. Flint, who lived many years there, in what 
manner the cheese was made, and I send you his answer. I 
have since learned, that some runnings of salt (I suppose 
runnet) is put into water, when the meal is in it, to turn it to 
curds. I think we have caravances' with us, but I know 
not whether they are the same with these, which actually 
came from China. They are said to be of great increase. 
</p><p>
I shall inquire of Mr. Collinson for your Journal. I see 
that of East Florida is printed with Stork's Account. 3 My 
love to good Mrs. Bartram and your children. With esteem 
I am ever, my dear friend, yours affectionately,

DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of Saturday, early this Morning, 
and am as usual much obliged by the kind Readiness with 
which you have done what I requested. 
</p><p>
Your good Mother has complained more of her Head 
since you left us than ever before. If she stoops, or looks, or bends her Neck downwards, on any occasion, it is with 
great Pain and Difficulty, that she gets her Head up again. 
She has, therefore, borrowed a Breast and Neck Collar of 
Mrs. Wilkes, such as Misses wear, and now uses it to keep 
her Head up. Mr. Strahan has invited us all to dine there 
to-morrow, but she has excused herself. Will you come, 
and go with me? If you cannot well do that, you will at 
least be with us on Friday to go to Lady Strachans. 
</p><p>
As to my own Head, which you so kindly enquire after, 
its Swimming has gradually worn off, and to-day for the first 
Time I felt nothing of it on getting out of Bed. But, as this 
speedy Recovery is, (as I am fully persuaded) owing to the 
extream Abstemiousness I have observed for some Days 
past at home, I am not without Apprehensions, that, being 
to dine abroad this Day, to-morrow, and next Day, I may 
inadvertently bring it on again, if I do not think of my little 
Monitor and guardian Angel, and make use of the proper 
and very pertinent Clause she proposes, in my Grace. Here 
comes a Morning Visitor. Adieu. My best Respects to 
Mrs. Tickel. I am, my dear Friend, yours affectionately,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received a letter from Mr. Winthrop, dated 
December 7th, containing the following account, viz. 
"On Thursday, the Qth of November, I had an opportunity of observing a transit of Mercury. I had carefully adjusted 
my clock to the apparent time, by correspondent altitudes of 
the Sun, taken with the quadrant for several days before, and 
with the same reflecting telescope as I used for the transit of 
Venus. I first perceived the little planet making an impression on the sun's limb at 2 h 52' 41" ; and he appeared wholly 
within at 53' 58" apparent time. The sun set before the planet 
reached the middle of his course ; and for a considerable time 
before sunset, it was so cloudy, that the planet could not be 
discerned. So that I made no observations of consequence, 
except that of the beginning, at which time the sun was 
perfectly clear. This transit completes three periods of 
forty-six years, since the first observation of Gassendi at 
Paris, in <a href='/results.php?year=1631'>1631</a>."

I am, Sir, with great esteem,

DEAR SIR. 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of the 13"' past, which I ought to 
have acknowledged sooner, but much Business and some 
Indisposition have occasioned the Delay. I can easily conceive the Difficulty a Man in your Situation, with such 
Connections, and so well esteemed and belov'd among them, 
must have in resolving to leave them with an Intention of 
Settling in a distant Country. And I do not wonder that your Regard for them should determine you to remain where 
you are. I was indeed of Opinion, from my Knowledge of 
that Country and of you, that if you should remove thither 
with your Family and Substance you would not only do 
extreamly well yourself, but have better Opportunities of 
establishing your Children in the World. Therefore I did 
not dissuade you when you appear'd to have such an Inclination. But at the same time, tho' I own I should have a 
Pleasure in adding such worthy Inhabitants to my Country 
as you and Mrs. Viny, and should be very happy in having 
you there for my Neighbours; yet as your Removal would 
give Pain to your good Brother here, whom I love and to 
many others that love you, I cannot, without extreme Reluctance think of using any Arguments to persuade you. Let 
us then leave that Matter where we found it. 
</p><p>
Possibly, however, as you are likely to have many Children, 
you may hereafter judge it not amiss, when they are grown 
up, to plant one of them in America, where he may prepare 
an Asylum for the rest, should any great Calamity, which 
God avert, befal this Country. A Man I knew, who had a 
Number of Sons, us'd to say, he chose to settle them at some 
Distance from each other, for he thought they throve better; 
remarking that Cabbages growing too near together, were 
not so likely to come to a Head. I shall be asleep before 
that time, otherwise he might expect and command my 
best Advice and Assistance. But as the Ancients who knew 
not how to write had a Method of transmitting Friendships 
to Posterity; the Guest who had been hospitably entertain'd in a strange Country breaking a Stick with every one 
who did him a kindness; and the Producing such a Tally 
at any Time afterwards, by a Descendant of the Host, to a 
Son or Grandson of the Guest, was understood as a good 
Claim to special Regard besides the Common Rights of 
Hospitality : So if this Letter should happen to be preserved, 
your Son may produce it to mine as an Evidence of the Good 
will that once subsisted between their Fathers, as an Acknowledgement of the Obligations you laid me under by your 
many Civilities when I was in your Country and a Claim to 
all the Returns due from me if I had been living. Pray 
make my best Respects acceptable to good Mrs. Viny, and 
give my Love to your Children. Be so good, too, as to remember me respectfully to your Sister and Brother-in-law, 
to Mr. Stace and Family, and to <a href='/results.php?tla=joh' rel='acquaintance'>Mr. Hancock</a> ; and believe 
me ever, with sincere Regard, Dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. Franklin.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your favour of November 25, and have made 
inquiries, as you desired, concerning the copper covering of 
houses. It has been used here in a few instances only, and 
the practice does not seem to gain ground. The copper is 
about the thickness of a common playing-card, and though 
a dearer metal than lead, I am told that as less weight serves, 
on account of its being so much thinner, and as slighter 
woodwork in the roof is sufficient to support it, the roof is 
not dearer, on the whole, than one covered with lead. 
</p><p>
It is said, that hail and rain make a disagreeable drumming 
noise on copper; but this, I suppose, is rather fancy; for 
the plates being fastened to the rafters must, in a great 
measure, deaden such sound. The first cost, whatever it is, 
will be all, as a copper covering must last for ages; and, 
when the house decays, the plates will still have intrinsic 
worth. In Russia, I am informed, many houses are covered 
with plates of iron tinned, (such as our tin pots and other 
wares are made of,) laid on over the edges of one another, 
like tiles; and which, it is said, last very long; the tin preserving the iron from much decay by rusting. In France 
and the Low Countries I have seen many spouts or pipes for 
conveying the water down from the roofs of houses, made of 
the same kind of tin plates, soldered together ; and they seem to stand very well. 
</p><p>
With sincere regard, I am 
</p><p>
Yours, &c. 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Your very judicious letter of November 26th, being communicated by me to some member of Parliament, was handed 
about among them, so that it was some time before I got it 
again into my hands. It had due weight with several, and 
was of considerable use. You will see that I printed it at length in the London Chronicle, with the merchants' letter. 
When the American affairs came to be debated in the House 
of Commons, the majority, notwithstanding all the weight of 
ministerial influence, was only sixty-two for continuing the 
whole last act; and would not have been so large, nay, I 
think the repeal would have been carried, but that the ministry 
were persuaded by Governor Bernard, and some lying letters 
said to be from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, that the associations not to import 
were all breaking to pieces, that America was in the greatest 
distress for want of the goods, that we could not possibly 
subsist any longer without them, and must of course submit 
to any terms Parliament should think fit to impose upon us. 
This, with the idle notion of the dignity and sovereignty of 
Parliament, which they are so fond of, and imagine will be 
endangered by any further concessions, prevailed, I know, 
with many, to vote with the ministry, who, otherwise, on 
account of the commerce, wish to see the difference accommodated. 
</p><p>
But, though both the Duke of Grafton and Lord North 
were and are, in my opinion, rather inclined to satisfy us, 
yet the Bedford party are so violent against us, and so prevalent in the council, that more moderate measures could 
not take place. This party never speak of us but with evident 
malice; "rebels" and "traitors" are the best names they 
can afford us, and I believe they only wish for a colorable 
pretence and occasion of ordering the soldiers to make a 
massacre among us. 
</p><p>
On the other hand, the Rockingham and Shelburne people, 
with Lord Chatham's friends, are disposed to favour us if 
they were again in power, which at present they are not like 
to be; though they, too, would be for keeping up the claim 
</p><p>
of Parliamentary sovereignty, but without exercising it in 
any mode of taxation. Besides these, we have for sincere 
friends and well-wishers the body of Dissenters generally 
throughout England, with many others, not to mention 
Ireland and all the rest of Europe, who, from various motives, 
join in applauding the spirit of liberty, with which we have 
claimed and insisted on our privileges, and wish us success, 
but whose suffrage cannot have much weight in our affairs. 
The merchants here were at length prevailed on to present 
a petition, but they moved slowly, and some of them, I thought, 
reluctantly; perhaps from a despair of success, the city not 
being much in favour with the court at present. The manufacturing towns absolutely refused to move at all ; some pretending to be offended with our attempting to manufacture 
for ourselves; others saying, that they had employment 
enough, and that our trade was of little importance to them, 
whether we continued or refused it. Those, who began a 
little to feel the effects of our forbearing to purchase, were 
persuaded to be quiet by the ministerial people, who gave 
out, that certain advices were received of our beginning to 
break our agreements; of our attempts to manufacture 
proving all abortive and ruining the undertakers; of our 
distress for want of goods, and dissensions among ourselves, 
which promised the total defeat of all such kind of combinations, and the prevention of them for the future, if the government were not urged imprudently to repeal the duties. But 
now that it appears from late and authentic accounts, that 
agreements continue in full force, that a ship is actually returned from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> to Bristol with nails and glass (articles 
that were thought of the utmost necessity), and that the 
ships, which were waiting here for the determination of 
Parliament, are actually returning to North America in their 
ballast, the tone of the manufacturers begins to change, and 
there is no doubt, that, if we are steady, and persevere in our 
resolutions, these people will soon begin a clamour, that much 
pains has hitherto been used to stifle. 
</p><p>
In short, it appears to me, that if we do not now persist 
in this measure till it has had its full effect, it can never again 
be used on any future occasion with the least prospect of 
success, and that, if we do persist another year, we shall 
never afterwards have occasion to use it. With sincere 
regards, I am, dear Sir, your obedient servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I suppose Gov r Pownall acquaints you with what has 
passed this Session relating to our American Affairs: All 
Europe is attentive to the Dispute between Britain and the 
Colonies, & I own I have a Satisfaction in seeing, that our 
Part is taken Everywhere; because I am persuaded, that 
that circumstance will not be without its Effect here in our 
favour. At the same time the malignant Pleasure, which 
other Powers take in British Divisions, may convince us on 
both sides of the Necessity of our uniting. 
</p><p>
In France they have translated and printed the principal 
Pieces, that have been written on the American Side of the 
Question; and, as French is the political Language of 
Europe, it has communicated an Acquaintance with our 
Affairs very extensively. M. Beaumont, a famous Advocate 
</p><p>
of Paris, the defender of the Family of Galas, wrote the Reflexions d'un Etranger desinteress6, which I send you. The 
manuscript is an original Letter from a Gentleman, (of 
Note, I am told,) as far off as the Austrian Silesia, who, 
being concern'd for us, wrote it to the Parliament, directing 
it to the late Speaker. The Speaker read only the first 
Side, was offended at the Freedom, and Impertinence, (as 
he calPd it,) and returned the Letter to the Office, refusing 
to pay the Postage. Accept it as a Curiosity. I send you 
also a late Edition of Molyneux's Case of Ireland, with a new 
Preface, shrewdly written. Our part is warmly taken by 
the Irish in general, there being in many points a similarity 
in our cases. My respects to <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>, and believe me 
ever, dear Sir, yours affectionately, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I received your Letter early this Morning; and, as I am 
so engaged, that I cannot see you when you come to-day, I 
write this Line just to say, that I am sure you are a much 
better Judge in this Affair of your own, than I can possibly 
be. 2 In that Confidence it was, that I forebore giving my 
Advice when you mention'd it to me, and not from any Disapprobation. My Concern (equal to any Father's) for your 
Happiness makes me write this, lest, having more Regard for 
my Opinion than you ought, and imagining it against the 
Proposal because I did not immediately advise accepting 
it, you should let that weigh any thing in your Deliberations. 
</p><p>
I assure you, that no Objection has occur'd to me. His 
Person you see ; his Temper and his Understanding you can 
judge of; his Character, for any thing I have ever heard, is 
unblemished; his Profession, with the Skill in it he is suppos'd to have, will be sufficient to support a Family; and, 
therefore, considering the Fortune you have in your Hands 
(tho' any future Expectation from your Aunt should be disappointed), I do not see but that the Agreement may be a 
rational one on both sides. 
</p><p>
I see your Delicacy, and your Humility too ; for you fancy 
that if you do not prove a great Fortune, you will not be 
lov'd; but I am sure that were I in his situation in every 
respect, knowing you so well as I do, and esteeming you so 
highly, I should think you a Fortune sufficient for me without 
a Shilling. 
</p><p>
Having thus, more explicitly than before, given my Opinion, 
I leave the rest to your sound Judgment, of which no one has 
a greater Share ; and I shall not be too inquisitive after your 
particular Reasons, your Doubts, your Fears, etc. For I 
shall be confident, whether you accept or refuse, that you do 
right. I only wish you may do what will most contribute to 
your Happiness, and of course to mine ; being ever, my dear 
Friend, yours most affectionately, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Don't be angry with me for supposing your Determination not quite so fix'd as you fancy it.

DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
Your favour of January 8th came duly to hand, but I 
have been so much engaged during the sitting of Parliament, 
that I could not correspond regularly with all my friends, 
and have of course trespassed most with those on whose good 
nature and indulgence I could most rely. I am, however, 
ashamed of being so long silent. It was but the other day, 
that I inquired after the fate of your tickets, when I received 
the enclosed answer, whereby you will see that the whole 
cost has not been lost. I only wished to see three ciphers 
more following the sum. I have not any further orders from 
you, but think to take at a venture two tickets more on your 
account. If you disapprove and choose to rest where you 
are, signify it by a line, before the drawing, directed to Messrs. 
Smith, Wright, and Grey, who may then dispose of the 
tickets. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear the old gentleman, your father, is still 
alive and happy. Please to remember me to him respectfully. Probably he can recollect but little of me, as it is a 
good deal more than half a century since he has seen me; 
but I remember him well, a lively, active, handsome young 
man, with a fine full flowing head of hair. I suppose he 
must now be near fourscore. 
</p><p>
If I could have given you any intimation of the intentions of government with regard to America, that might be 
depended upon, you should have had them in good time for 
use, in the views of trade you hint at. But there have been 
this winter such changes of men and of minds, and such continual expectations of more and other changes, that nothing 
was certain; and I believe that to this day the ministry are 
not all of a mind, nor determined what are the next steps 
proper to be taken with us. Some are said to be for severe, 
others for lenient measures ; others for leaving things as they 
now are, in confidence that we shall soon be tired of our 
non-importation agreements, manufacturing schemes, and 
self-denying frugalities, submit to the duties, and return by 
degrees to our dear luxuries and idleness, with our old course 
of commercial extravagance, folly, and good humour. Which 
of these opinions will prevail and be acted on, it is impossible 
yet to say. I only know, that generally the dispute is thought 
a dangerous one, and that many wish to see it well compromised in time, lest by a continuance of mutual provocations 
the breach should become past healing. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you and cousin Hubbard for your 
kindness to my friend Hughes, of which he informed me, 
with many expressions of gratitude for your civilities. He 
would have been very happy in that station, and in your 
acquaintance so nigh him ; but he is now removed to Carolina. 
</p><p>
My love to your good wife and children, and believe me 
ever your affectionate uncle, B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received duly your favour of March 28th. With this I 
send you two Speeches in Parliament on our Affairs by a 
Member that you know. The Repeal of the whole late Act 
would undoubtedly have been a prudent Measure, and I 
have reason to believe that Lord North was for it, but some 
of the other Ministers could not be brought to agree to it; 
so the Duty on Tea, with that obnoxious Preamble, remains 
to continue the dispute: But I think the next Session will 
hardly pass over without repealing them; for the Parliament must finally comply with the Sense of the Nation. 
</p><p>
As to the Standing Army kept up among us in time of 
Peace, without the Consent of our Assemblies, I am clearly 
of Opinion that it is not agreable to the Constitution. Should 
the King, by the aid of his Parliaments in Ireland and the 
Colonies, raise an Army, and bring it into England, quartering it here in time of Peace without the Consent of the Parliament of Great Britain, I am persuaded he would soon be 
told, that he had no Right so to do, and the Nation would 
ring with Clamours against it. I own, that I see no Difference 
in the Cases: And while we continue so many distinct and 
separate States, our having the same Head, or Sovereign,, 
the King, will not justify such an Invasion of the Separate 
Right of each State to be consulted on the Establishment of 
whatever Force is proposed to be kept up within its Limits, 
and to give or refuse its Consent, as shall appear most for 
the Public Good of that State. 
That the Colonies originally were constituted distinct 
States, and intended to be continued such, is clear to me from 
a thorough Consideration of their original Charters, and the 
whole Conduct of the Crown and Nation towards them until 
the Restoration. Since that Period, the Parliament here has 
usurped an Authority of making Laws for them, which before it had not. We have for some time submitted to that 
Usurpation, partly through Ignorance and Inattention, and 
partly from our Weakness and Inability to contend : I hope, 
when our Rights are better understood here, we shall, by 
prudent and proper Conduct, be able to obtain from the 
Equity of this Nation a Restoration of them. And in the 
mean time, I could wish, that such Expressions as the Supreme Authority of Parliament; the Subordinacy 0} our 
Assemblies to the Parliament, and the like, (which in Reality 
mean nothing, if our Assemblies, with the King, have a true 
Legislative Authority) ; I say, I could wish that such Expressions were no more seen in our publick Pieces. They 
are too strong for Compliment, and tend to confirm a Claim 
of Subjects in one Part of the King's Dominions to be Sovereigns over their Fellow Subjects in another Part of his Dominions, when in truth they have no such Right, and their 
Claim is founded only in Usurpation, the several States 
having equal Rights and Liberties, and being only connected, 
as England and Scotland were before the Union, by having 
one common Sovereign, the King. 
</p><p>
This kind of Doctrine the Lords and Commons here would 
deem little less than Treason against what they think their 
Share of the Sovereignty over the Colonies. To me those 
Bodies seem to have been long encroaching on the Rights 
of their and our Sovereign, assuming too much of his Authority, and betraying his Interests. By our Constitution 
he is, with his plantation Parliaments, the sole Legislator of 
his American Subjects, and in that Capacity is, and ought 
to be, free to exercise his own Judgment, unrestrained and 
unlimited by his Parliament here. And our Parliaments 
have right to grant him Aids without the Consent of this 
Parliament, a Circumstance, which, by the way, begins to 
give it some Jealousy. Let us, therefore, hold fast our 
Loyalty to our King, who has the best Disposition towards 
us, and has a Family Interest in our Prosperity; as that 
steady Loyalty is the most probable means of securing us 
from the arbitrary Power of a corrupt Parliament, that does 
not like us, and conceives itself to have an Interest in keeping 
us down and fleecing us. 
</p><p>
If they should urge the inconvenience of an empire's being 
divided into so many separate States, and from thence conclude, that we are not so divided, I would answer, that an 
Inconvenience proves nothing but itself. England and 
Scotland were once separate States, under the same King. 
The Inconvenience found in their being separate States did 
not prove, that the Parliament of England had a right to 
govern Scotland. A formal Union was thought necessary, 
and England was a hundred Years soliciting it, before she 
could bring it about. If Great Britain now think such a 
Union necessary with us, let her propose her Terms, and we 
may consider them. Were the general Sentiments of this 
Nation to be consulted in the Case, I should hope the Terms, 
whether practicable or not, would at least be equitable ; for 
I think, that, except among those with whom the spirit of 
Toryism prevails, the popular Inclination here is, to wish 
us well, and that we may preserve our Liberties. 
I unbosom myself thus to you, in Confidence of your 
Prudence, and wishing to have your Sentiments on the Subject in return. 
</p><p>
Mr. Pownall, I suppose, will acquaint you with the Event 
of his Motions, and therefore I say nothing more of them, 
than that he appears very sincere in his Endeavours to serve 
us; on which Account, I some time since republished with 
Pleasure the parting Addresses to him of your Assembly, 
with some previous Remarks to his Honour, as well as in 
Justification of our People. 
</p><p>
I hope, that before this time those detestable Murderers 
have quitted your Province, and that the Spirit of Industry 
and Frugality continues and increases. With sincerest 
Esteem and Affection, I am, dear Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient & most humble servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Just before the last Session of Parliament commenced, a Friend of mine, who had Connection with some 
of the Ministry, wrote me a Letter purposely to draw from 
me my Sentiments in writing on the then State of Affairs. I 
wrote a pretty free Answer which I know was immediately 
communicated, and a good deal handed about among them. 
For your private Amusement I send you Copies. I wish 
you may be able to read them, as they are very badly written 
by a blundering clerk.

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letters of March 12 and April 24. 
I think you are the most punctual of all my Correspondents ; 
and it is often a particular Satisfaction to me to hear from 
you, when I have no Letter from any one else. I did by 
Capt. Falconer answer Sally's Letter about her Son's being 
inoculated, and told her Sir John Pringle's Opinion as to the 
Probability of his not having the SmallPox hereafter. I 
think he advised, as no Eruption appeared, to make sure of 
the thing by inoculating him again. I rejoice much in the 
Pleasure you appear to take in him. It must be of Use to 
your Health, the having such an Amusement. My Love 
to him, and to his Father and Mother. 
</p><p>
Capt. Ourry is gone abroad as a travelling Tutor to Lord 
Galway's Son; Mrs. Strahan is at Bath; Mr. Strahan and 
Children, Mr. and Mrs. West and their Son, are all well at 
present; tho' Mr. West himself has had a long Illness. 
They always enquire after you & I present your Compliments. 
Poor Nanny was drawn in to marry a worthless Fellow, who 
got all her Money, and then ran away and left her. So she 
is returned to her old Service with Mrs. Stevenson, poorer 
than ever, but seems pretty patient, only looks dejected, 
sighs sometimes, and wishes she had never left <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
Mr. Montgomery died at sea, as we have lately heard and Mrs. 
Montgomery, who has lain in at Lisbon, will return from 
thence with her Boy to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. 
</p><p>
As to myself, I had from Christmas till Easter, a disagreable 
Giddiness hanging about me, which however did not hinder 
me from being about and doing Business. In the Easter 
Holidays being at a Friend's House in the Country, I was 
taken with a sore Throat, and came home half strangled. 
From Monday till Friday, I could swallow nothing but 
Barley Water and the like. I was bled largely, and purged 
two or three times. On Friday came on a Fit of the Gout, 
from which I had been free Five Years. Immediately the 
Inflammation and Swelling in my Throat disappeared; my 
Foot swelled greatly, and I was confined about three Weeks ; 
since which I am perfectly well, the Giddiness and every 
other disagreable Symptom having quite left me. I hope 
your Health is likewise by this time quite reestablished; 
being as ever, my dear Child, your affectionate Husband,

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
It is a long time since I had the Pleasure of hearing from 
you directly. M rs . Franklin has indeed now and then acquainted me of your Welfare, which I am always glad to hear 
of. It is, I fear, partly, if not altogether, my Fault that our 
Correspondence has not been regularly continued. One 
thing only I am sure of; that it has been from no want of 
Regard on either side, but rather from too much Business and 
Avocations of various kinds, and my having little of Importance to communicate. 
</p><p>
One of our good Citizens, M r Hillegas, anxious for the 
future Safety of our Town, wrote to me some time since, 
desiring I would enquire concerning the Covering of Houses 
here with Copper. I sent him the best Information I could 
then obtain; but have since received the enclos'd from an 
ingenious friend, M r Wooller, who is what they call here a Civil 
Engineer. I should be glad you would peruse it, think of 
the matter a little, and give me your Sentiments of it. When 
you have done with the Paper, please to give it to M r Hillegas. 
I am told by Lord Despencer, who has covered a long Piazza 
or Gallery with Copper, that the Expence is charged in this 
Account too high; for his cost but i/io per foot, all Charges 
included. I suppose his Copper must have been thinner. 
And indeed it is so strong a Metal, that I think it may well 
be used very thin. 
</p><p>
It appears to me of great Importance to build our DwellingHouses, if we can, in a Manner more secure from Danger 
by Fire. We scarce ever hear of a Fire in Paris. When I 
was there, I took particular Notice of the Construction of 
their Houses ; and I did not see how one of them could well 
be burnt. The Roofs are Slate or Tile ; the Walls are Stone ; 
the Rooms generally lin'd with Stucco or Plaister instead of 
Wainscot ; the Floors of Stucco, or of sixsquare Tiles painted 
brown; or of Flag Stone, or Marble; if any Floor were of 
Wood, it was Oak Wood, which is not so inflammable as 
Pine. Carpets prevent the Coldness of Stone or Brick Floors 
offending the Feet in Winter, and the Noise of Treading on 
such Floors overhead, is less inconvenient than on Boards. 
</p><p>
The Stairs too, at Paris, are either Stone or Brick with only 
a Wooden Edge or Corner for the Step ; so that on the Whole, 
tho' the Parisians commonly burn Wood in their Chimneys, 
a more dangerous kind of Fuel than that used here, yet 
their Houses escape extreamly well, as there is little in a 
Room that can be consumed by Fire, except the Furniture. 
Whereas in London, perhaps scarce a Year passes in which 
half a Million of Property and many Lives are not lost by this 
destructive Element. Of late indeed they begin here to leave 
off Wainscotting their Rooms, and instead of it cover the Walls 
with Stucco, often form'd into Pannels like Wainscot, which, 
being painted, is very strong and warm: Stone Staircases 
too, with Iron Rails, grow more and more into Fashion here : 
But Stone Steps cannot in some Circumstances, be fixed; 
and there methinks Oak is safer than Pine ; and I assure you 
that in many genteel Houses here, both old & new, the Stairs 
and Floors are Oak, and look extreamly well. Perhaps solid 
Oak for the Steps would be still safer than Boards ; and two 
Steps might be cut diagonally out of one Piece. 
</p><p>
Excuse my talking to you on a Subject with which you 
must be so much better acquainted than I am. It is partly 
to make out a Letter for renewing our Correspondence, and 
partly in hope that by turning your Attention to the Point, 
some Methods of greater Security in our future Building may 
be thought of & promoted by you, whose Judgment I know 
has deservedly great Weight with our Fellow- Citizens. For 
tho' our Town has not hitherto suffered very greatly by Fire, 
yet I am apprehensive, that some time or other, by a Concurrence of unlucky Circumstances, such as dry Weather, 
hard Frost, & high Winds, a Fire then happening may 
suddenly spread far and wide over our Cedar Roofs, and 
do us immense Mischief. If you favour me with a Line, 
let me know how good M Rhoads does, and every one of 
your Children; and how it fares with my dear old Friend 
M rs Paschal. With sincere Esteem, I am 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>

DEAR POLLY, 
</p><p>
I wrote a few lines to you last Week, in answer to yours 
of the 5th, since which I have been in the Country; and, 
returning yesterday, found your good Mother was come home, 
and had got a Letter from you of the 2oth. She has just put 
it into my hands, and desires me to write to you, as she is 
going into the City with Miss Barwell to buy things. Whether 
she will have time to write herself I cannot say, or whether, 
if she had, she would get over her natural Aversion to writing. 
I rather think she will content herself with your knowing 
what she should say, and would say, if she wrote ; and with 
my letting you know, that she is well, and very happy in 
hearing that you are so. 
</p><p>
Your Friends are all much pleas'd with your account of the 
agreable Family, their kind Reception and Entertainment 
of you, and the Respect shown you. Only Dolly and I, 
tho' we rejoice and shall do so in every thing that contributes 
to your Happiness, are now and then in low Spirits, supposing 
we have lost each a Friend. Barwell says she conceives 
nothing of this ; and that we must be two Simpletons to entertain such Imaginations. I showed her your Letter to your 
Mother, wherein you say, " Dolly is a naughty Girl, and, 
if she does not mend, I shall turn her off ; for I have got another Dolly now, and a very good Dolly too." She begg'd 
me not to communicate this to Dolly, for tho' said in jest, 
yet, in her present State of mind, it would hurt her. I suppose 
that it was for the same good-natur'd Reason, that she refus'd 
to show me a Paragraph of your Letter to Dolly, that had been 
communicated by Dolly to her. 
</p><p>
July 25. The above was written yesterday, but, being 
interrupted, I could not finish my Letter in time for the Post ; 
tho' I find I had little to add. Your Mother desires me to 
express abundance of Affection for you, and to Mr. Hewson ; 
and to say all the proper Things for her, with respect to the 
rest of your Friends there. But you can imagine better than 
I can write. Sally and little Temple ' join in best Wishes 
of Prosperity to you both. Make my sincere Respects 
acceptable to Mr. Hewson, whom, exclusive of his other 
Merits, I shall always esteem in proportion to the Regard 
he manifests for you. Barwell tells me, that your Aunt had 
receiv'd his Letter, and was highly pleas'd with it and him ; 
so I hope all will go well there ; and I shall take every Opportunity of cultivating her good Dispositions, in which I think 
you us'd to be sometimes a little backward, but you always 
had your Reasons. 
</p><p>
I am apt to love everybody that loves you, and therefore 
I suppose I shall in time love your new Mother, and new 
Sister, and your new Dolly. I find I begin to like them already, and, if you think proper, you may tell them so. But your old Dolly and I have agreed to love each other better 
than ever we did, to make up as much as we can our suppos'd 
Loss of you. We like your Assurances of continued Friendship, unimpair'd by your Change of Condition, and we believe you think as you write; but we fancy we know better 
than you. You know I once knew your Heart better than 
you did yourself. As a Proof that I am right, take notice, 
that you now think this the silliest Letter I ever wrote to you, 
and that Mr. Hewson confirms you in that Opinion. 
</p><p>
However, I am still what I have been so many Years, my 
dear good Girl, your sincerely affectionate Friend and Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

REV SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your Favour of June 14, with several Copies 
of your Observations of the Transit of Venus, for which I 
thank you. I have sent one of them to M r Maskelyne as you 
desired, with an Extract from your Letter, and another to 
Paris, I have not yet obtained from him the Estimate he 
promised me, but hope to have it soon ; tho' by what I hear 
from others I begin to fear the Expense will be thought too

DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I am favoured with yours of June loth. With this I send 
you our last volume of Philosophical Transactions, wherein 
you will see printed the Observations of Messrs. Biddle and 
Bayley on the Transit, as well as those of Messrs. Mason and 
Dixon relating to the longitude of places. When you and 
your friends have perused it, please to deliver it to Mrs. 
Franklin to be put among my books. 
</p><p>
Thanks for the books on the silk affair. It will give me 
great pleasure to see that business brought to perfection 
among us. The subscription is a noble one, and does great 
honour to our public spirit. If you should not procure from 
Georgia, as you expected, one that understands the reeling, 
I believe I can procure you such a hand from Italy, a great 
silk merchant here having offered me his assistance for that 
purpose, if wanted. 
</p><p>
I am happy beyond expression to see the virtue and firmness of our country, with regard to the non-importation. It 
does us great honour. And <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a> is in great disgrace 
with all the friends of liberty in the kingdom, who are, I assure you, no contemptible number, and who applaud the 
stand we have made, and wish us success. I am, my dear 
friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>

[<a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a>], Saturday, <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a> <a rel='day origin' value='22'>22</a>, <a href='/results.php?year=1770' rel="origin">1770</a>. 
</p><p>
THIS morning Queen Margaret, accompanied by her first 
maid of honour, Miss Franklin, set out for Rochester. Immediately on their departure, the whole street was in tears 
from a heavy shower of rain. It is whispered, that the new 
family administration, which took place on her Majesty's 
departure, promises, like all other new administrations, to 
govern much better than the old one. 
</p><p>
We hear, that the great person (so called from his enormous 
size), of a certain family in a certain street, is grievously 
affected at the late changes, and could hardly be comforted 
this morning, though the new ministry promised him a roasted 
shoulder of mutton and potatoes for his dinner. 
</p><p>
It is said, that the same great person intended to pay his 
respects to another great personage this day, at St. James's, 
it being coronation-day ; hoping thereby a little to amuse his 
grief ; but was prevented by an accident, Queen Margaret, or 
her maid of honour, having carried off the key of the drawers, 
so that the lady of the bed-chamber could not come at a 
laced shirt for his Highness. Great clamours were made on 
this occasion against her Majesty. 
</p><p>
Other accounts say, that the shirts were afterwards found, 
though too late, in another place. And some suspect, that the wanting a shirt from those drawers was only a ministerial 
pretence to excuse picking the locks, that the new administration might have every thing at command. 
</p><p>
We hear that the lady chamberlain of the household went 
to market this morning by her own self, gave the butcher whatever he asked for the mutton, and had no dispute with the 
potato-woman, to their great amazement at the change of times. 
</p><p>
It is confidently asserted, that this afternoon, the weather 
being wet, the great person a little chilly and nobody at home 
to find fault with the expense of fuel, he was indulged with 
a fire in his chamber. It seems the design is, to make him 
contented by degrees with the absence of the Queen. 
</p><p>
A project has been under consideration of government, 
to take the opportunity of her Majesty's absence for doing a 
thing she was always averse to, namely, fixing a new lock 
on the street door, or getting a key made to the old one; 
it being found extremely inconvenient, that one or other of 
the great officers of state should, whenever the maid goes out 
for a ha'penny worth of sand, or a pint of porter, be obliged 
to attend the door to let her in again. But opinions being 
divided, which of the two expedients to adopt, the project 
is, for the present, laid aside. 
</p><p>
We have good authority to assure our readers, that a Cabinet Council was held this afternoon at tea; the subject of 
which was a proposal for the reformation of manners, and a 
more strict observation of the Lord's day. The result was a 
unanimous resolution, that no meat should be dressed tomorrow ; whereby the cook and the first minister will both be 
at liberty to go to church, the one having nothing to do, and 
the other no roast to rule. It seems the cold shoulder of mutton, and the apple-pie, were thought sufficient for Sunday's dinner. All pious people applaud this measure, and 
it is thought the new ministry will soon become popular. 
</p><p>
We hear that Mr. Wilkes was at a certain house in Craven 
Street this day, and inquired after the absent Queen. His 
good lady and the children are well. 
</p><p>
The report, that Mr. Wilkes, the patriot, made the above 
visit, is without foundation, it being his brother, the courtier. 
</p><p>
Sunday, <a rel="month origin" value="9">September</a> 23. 
</p><p>
It is now found by sad experience, that good resolutions 
are easier made than executed. Notwithstanding yesterday's 
solemn order of Council, nobody went to church to-day. 
It seems the great person's broad-built bulk lay so long abed, 
that the breakfast was not over till it was too late to dress. 
At least this is the excuse. In fine, it seems a vain thing to 
hope reformation from the example of our great folks. 
</p><p>
The cook and the minister, however, both took advantage 
of the order so far, as to save themselves all trouble, and the 
clause of cold dinner was enforced, though the going to church 
was dispensed with; just as common working folks observe 
the commandments. The seventh day thou shall rest, they 
think a sacred injunction ; but the other six days thou shall 
labour is deemed a mere piece of advice, which they may practise when they want bread and are out of credit at the alehouse, and may neglect whenever they have money in their 
pockets. 
</p><p>
It must, nevertheless, be said, in justice to our court, that, 
whatever inclination they had to gaming, no cards were 
brought out to-day. Lord and Lady Hewson walked after 
dinner to Kensington, to pay their duty to the Dowager, and 
</p><p>
Dr. Fatsides made four hundred and sixty-nine turns in his 
dining-room, as the exact distance of a visit to the lovely 
Lady Barwell, whom he did not find at home ; so there was 
no struggle for and against a kiss, and he sat down to dream 
in the easy-chair, that he had it without any trouble. 
</p><p>
Monday, September 24. 
</p><p>
We are credibly informed, that the great person dined this 
day with the Club at the Cat and Bagpipes in the City, on 
cold round of boiled beef. This, it seems, he was under some 
necessity of doing (though he rather dislikes beef), because 
truly the ministers were to be all abroad somewhere to dine 
on hot roast venison. It is thought, that, if the Queen had 
been at home, he would not have been so slighted. And 
though he shows outwardly no marks of dissatisfaction, it is 
suspected, that he begins to wish for her Majesty's return. 
</p><p>
It is currently reported, that poor Nanny had nothing for 
dinner in the kitchen, for herself and puss, but the scrapings 
of the bones of Saturday's mutton. 
</p><p>
This evening there was high play at Craven Street House. 
The great person lost money. It is supposed the ministers, 
as is usually supposed of all ministers, shared the emoluments among them. 
</p><p>
Tuesday, Sept. 25. 
</p><p>
This Morning my good Lord Hutton call'd at CravenStreet House, and enquired very respectfully & affectionately 
concerning the Welfare of the Queen. He then imparted 
to the big Man a Piece of Intelligence important to them both, 
and but just communicated by Lady Hawkesworth, viz. 
that the amiable and delectable Companion, Miss D[orothea] 
B[lount], had made a Vow to marry absolutely him of the 
two whose Wife should first depart this Life. It is impossible 
to express the various Agitations of Mind appearing in both 
their Faces on this Occasion. Vanity at the Preference 
given them over the rest of Mankind; Abjection to their 
present Wives, Fear of losing them, Hope, if they must lose 
them, to obtain the proposed Comfort ; Jealousy of each other 
in case both Wives should die together, &c. &c. &c., all 
working at the same time jumbled their Features into inexplicable Confusion. They parted at length with Professions 
& outward Appearances indeed of ever-during Friendship, but 
it was shrewdly suspected that each of them sincerely wished 
Health & long Life to the other's Wife; & that however 
long either of these Friends might like to live himself, the 
other would be very well pleas'd to survive him. 
</p><p>
It is remarked, that the Skies have wept every Day in 
Craven Street, the Absence of the Queen. 
</p><p>
The Publick may be assured that this Morning a certain 
great Personage was asked very complaisantly by the Mistress 
of the Household, if he would chuse to have the Blade-Bone 
of Saturday's Mutton that had been kept for his Dinner to-day, 
broil' d or cold. He answer'd gravely, // there is any Flesh 
on it, it may be broil' d; if not, it may as well be cold. Orders 
were accordingly given for Broiling it. But when it came to 
Table, there was indeed so very little Flesh, or rather none, 
(Puss having din'd on it yesterday after Nanny) that if our 
new Administration had been as good Oeconomists as they 
would be thought, the Expence of Broiling might well have 
been saved to the Publick, and carried to the Sinking Fund. 
It is assured the great Person bears all with infinite Patience. 
But the Nation is astonish'd at the insolent Presumption, 
that dares treat so much Mildness in so cruel a manner ! 
</p><p>
A terrible Accident had like to have happened this Afternoon 
at Tea. The Boiler was set too near the End of the little 
square Table. The first Ministress was sitting at one End 
of the Table to administer the Tea; the great Person was 
about to sit down at the other End where the Boiler stood. 
By a sudden Motion the Lady gave the Table a Tilt. Had 
it gone over, the G. P. must have been scalded, perhaps to 
Death. Various are the Surmises and Observations on this 
Occasion. The Godly say it would have been a just Judgment on him, for preventing, by his Laziness, the Family's 
going to Church last Sunday. The Opposition do not stick 
to insinuate that there was a Design to scald him, prevented 
only by his quick Catching the Table. The Friends of the 
Ministry give it out, that he carelessly jogg'd the Table himself, & would have been inevitably scalded, had not the Ministress sav'd him. It is hard for the Publick to come at the 
Truth in these Cases. 
</p><p>
At six o'Clock this Afternoon, News came by the Post, that 
her Majesty arrived safely at Rochester on Saturday Night. 
The Bells immediately rang, for Candles to illuminate 
the Parlour, the Court went into Cribbidge, and the Evening 
concluded with every other Demonstration of Joy. 
</p><p>
It is reported that all the principal Officers of the State 
have received an Invitation from the Dutchess Dowager 
of Rochester to go down thither on Saturday next. But it 
is not yet known whether the great Affairs they have on their 
Hands will permit them to make this Excursion. 
</p><p>
We hear that from the Time of her Majesty's leaving 
Craven-Street House to this Day, no Care is taken to file the 
Newspapers; but they lie about in every Room in every 
Window, and on every Chair, just where the Great Person 
lays them when he reads them. It is impossible Government 
can long go on in such Hands.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I make no doubt of the Truth of what the Papers tell us, 
that a certain great Person is half-starved on the Blade-Bone 
of a Sheep (I cannot call it of Mutton, there being none on 
it) by a Set of the most careless, worthless, thoughtless, 
inconsiderate, corrupt, ignorant, blundering, foolish, crafty, 
& knavish Ministers, that ever got into a House and pretended 
to govern a Family and provide a Dinner. Alas for the poor 
old England of Craven Street! If they continue in Power 
another Week, the Nation will be ruined. Undone, totally 
undone, if I and my Friends are not appointed to succeed 
them. I am a great Admirer of your useful and impartial 
Paper ; and therefore request you will insert this without fail,

I SEE with pleasure, that we think pretty much alike on 
the subject of English America. We of the colonies have 
never insisted, that we ought to be exempt from contributing 
to the common expenses necessary to support the prosperity 
of the empire. We only assert, that, having Parliaments 
of our own, and not having representatives in that of Great 
Britain, our Parliaments are the only judges of what we can 
and what we ought to contribute in this case; and that the 
English Parliament has no right to take our money without 
our consent. In fact, the British empire is not a single state ; 
it comprehends many; and, though the Parliament of Great 
Britain has arrogated to itself the power of taxing the colonies, 
it has no more right to do so, than it has to tax Hanover. 
We have the same King, but not the same legislatures. 
</p><p>
The dispute between the two countries has already lost 
England many millions sterling, which it has lost in its commerce, and America has in this respect been a proportionable gainer. This commerce consisted principally of superfluities ; 
objects of luxury and fashion, which we can well do without ; 
and the resolution we have formed of importing no more, till 
our grievances are redressed, has enabled many of our infant 
manufactures to take root; and it will not be easy to make 
our people abandon them in future, even should a connexion 
more cordial than ever succeed the present troubles. I 
have, indeed, no doubt that the Parliament of England will 
finally abandon its present pretensions, and leave us to the 
peaceable enjoyment of our rights and privileges.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received with great Pleasure the Assurances of your kind 
Remembrance of me, and the Continuance of your Good will 
towards me, in your Letter by M. le Comte Chreptowitz. 
I should have been happy to have rendered him every Civility 
and Mark of Respect in my Power (as the Friend of those I 
so much respect and honour) if he had given me the Opportunity: But he did not let me see him. 
</p><p>
Accept my sincere Acknowledgements and Thanks for the 
valuable Present you made me of your excellent Work on the 
Commerce of the India Company, which I have perused with 
much Pleasure and Instruction. It bears throughout the 
stamp of your Masterly Hand, in Method, Perspicuity, & 
Force of Argument. The honourable Mention you have 
made in it of your Friend is extremely obliging. I was 
already too much in your Debt for Favours of that kind. 
</p><p>
I purpose returning to America in the ensuing Summer, 
if our Disputes should be adjusted, as I hope they will be 
in the next Session of Parliament. Would to God I could take 
with me Messrs, du Pont, du Bourg, and some other French 
Friends with their good Ladies! I might then, by mixing 
them with my Friends in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, form a little happy 
Society that would prevent my ever wishing again to visit 
Europe. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere Esteem and Respect, I am, Dear Sir, 
Your most obedient

& most humble servant,

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter of Aug. 16, which gave me a 
great deal of Satisfaction. I am glad your little Grandson 
recovered so soon of his Illness, as I see you are quite in Love 
with him, and your Happiness wrapt up in his; since your 
whole long Letter is made up of the History of his pretty 
Actions. It was very prudently done of you not to interfere 
when his Mother thought fit to correct him; which pleases 
me the more, as I feared, from your Fondness of him, that 
he would be too much humoured, and perhaps spoiled. 
There is a story of two little Boys in the Street; one was 
crying bitterly; the other came to him to ask what was the 
Matter ? I have been, says he, " for a pennyworth of Vinegar, 
and I have broke the Glass, and spilt the Vinegar, and my 
Mother will whip me." No, she won't whip you, says the 
other. Indeed, she will, says he. What, says the other, have you then got ne'er a Grandmother? 
</p><p>
I am sorry I did not send one of my Books to Mr. Rhodes, 
since he was desirous of seeing it. My Love to him, and to 
all enquiring Friends. Mrs. West was here to-day, and desired me to mention her Love to you. Mr. Strahan and 
Family are all well, always enquire how you all do, & send 
their Love. Mrs. Stevenson is at present in the Country. 
But Polly sends her Love to you, and Mrs. Bache, & the 
young Gentleman. I am, as ever, your affectionate Husband,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Your favour of October 3ist came to hand a few days 
since, with the vote of the House of Representatives appointing me their agent here, which, as it was unsolicited on my 
part, I esteem the greater honour ; and shall be very happy, 
if I can, in that capacity, render my country any acceptable 
service. 
</p><p>
I have also just received your letter, of November 6th, 
containing an account of the state and circumstances of the 
province, and the grievances it labours under, with sundry 
depositions and other papers. Another of November iyth, with a pamphlet, entitled, the "Proceedings of Council," 
&c. ; another of November 23d, containing an order on Mr. De Berdt for papers. I can at present only say, that I shall 
immediately endeavour to make myself master of the business 
committed to my care, that so, when the Parliament and public 
boards, which are now adjourned for a month, shall meet 
again, I may be ready to proceed, in such manner, as, on conferring with Mr. Bollan, shall appear advisable for obtaining 
redress of the grievances so justly complained of. 
</p><p>
I have the pleasure to acquaint you, from good authority, 
that the project formed by the enemies of the province, for 
bringing into Parliament a bill to abridge our charter rights, 
though at first it received some countenance, and great pains 
were taken to recommend it, is now laid aside. I do not 
presume to suppose, that the opposition I gave to it, (by showing the imprudence of the measure, and declaring openly my 
opinion on all occasions, that, the charter being a compact 
between the King and the people of the colony who were out 
o) the realm of Great Britain, there existed nowhere on earth a 
power to alter it, while its terms were complied with, without 
the consent o] BOTH the contracting parties^) had any weight 
on the occasion. I rather think, that a disposition prevails of 
late to be on good terms with the colonies, especially as we 
seem to be on the eve of a war with Spain ; and that, in consequence of that disposition, which I hope we shall cultivate, 
more attention has been paid to the sober advice of our 
friends, and less to the virulent instigations of our enemies. 
</p><p>
I beg you will present my dutiful respects to the House of 
Representatives, and assure them of my most faithful endeavours in their service. With great esteem and regard, I 
have the honour to be, &c. B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR: 
</p><p>
I duly received your several Favours of July 12, Nov. 6, 
and 15, and am glad that my little Communications afforded 
you any Pleasure. I join with you most cordially in Wishes 
of a perfect happy Union between Great Britain and the 
Colonies. This is only to be expected from Principles of 
Justice and Equity on both sides, which we must endeavour 
to cultivate. I think there is now a Disposition here to treat 
us more equitably, and I hope it will increase and prevail. 
</p><p>
I esteem the Appointment to the Agency of your Province, 
unexpected and unsolicited by me, as one of the greatest 
Honours for which I must think myself indebted to your 
Friendship. I wish I may be able to do my Country effectual 
Service ; nothing could make me more happy. I shall however, use my most faithful Endeavours. I had, before I 
heard of this Appointment, openly opposed the Project of 
abridging our Charter Privileges, which some of our Adversaries were extremely busy in ; designing to do it by an act 
of Parliament ; a Bill for the purpose being, as I have heard, 
actually drawn ready to be brought in. I boldly and openly 
asserted that Parliament had no such power; and that an 
Attempt of that kind would, by alarming all America, raise 
a new Flame there, & tend more to loosen the Connections 
now subsisting, than any step that had yet been taken. I do 
not know that the freedom I use in declaring and publishing 
these Sentiments had much Effect ; I rather think the Apprehension of an approaching War inclined Government to milder 
Measures, and to hearken less to the mad Projects of our Adversaries. So it is, however, that the Scheme has been laid 
aside, and will, I think, hardly be resumed, tho' the Expectation of War is much lessened. 
</p><p>
It makes me happy to learn that my Ideas on a certain subject appeared just to you and your Friends. I have now in 
hand a piece (intended for the publick at a convenient Time) l 
which I hope will satisfy many others even on this side the 
Water, that every lady of Genoa is not a Queen of Corsica. 
Just at this Juncture here, perhaps His more prudent to be 
quiet, to stir no new questions, to let heats abate ; and when 
men are cooler, Reason may be better heard. I think I shall 
send my Manuscript to America for the Perusal and Correction of my Friends and for their Advice on the Expediency 
of its being published, before I venture it into the World. 
You I hope will give me leave to trouble you with it, as it 
seems to me a Question of great Importance to us all. 
</p><p>
You have given, in a little Compass, so full and comprehensive a View of the Circumstances on which is founded the 
Security Britain has for all reasonable Advantages from us, 
tho' things were put into the same State in which they were 
before the Stamp Act, that I cannot refrain communicating 
an Extract of your Letter, where I think it may be of Use; 
and I think I shall publish it. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt of an Intention here to make all our 
Governors independent of the People for their Support, as 
fast as the American Duties will bear the Expense. In this 
Point I think all Parties are against us: And nothing appears to them more unreasonable than that we should wish 
to have our Governors under such Influence, when the King himself, as they say, is always made independent of the Parliament here, in that Respect, by a fixed Civil List Revenue. 
I have endeavoured to show the Injustice of taxing those 
Colonies (who have always supported their own Government) 
for the support of other Governments in which they have no 
Interest, and the great Difference between a Prince, whose 
Welfare and that of his Family is intimately connected with 
the Prosperity of the Nation, and a governor who comes 
from another Country to make Money, and intends to return 
to the Place whence he came, where he will not hear the 
Complaints and Curses of those he has oppress'd and plunder'd, nor his Children be less respected or fare the worse for 
the Malfeasance of their Father. But it is so sweet a thing 
to have the Giving of Places of great and sure Profit to Friends 
and Favorites; and the prospect of doing it out of other 
Revenues than those of this Nation, at which Parliament is 
therefore less likely to take Umbrage, is so tempting, that I 
think scarce anything said or to be said here will avail much 
towards discouraging the project. There is indeed one Thing 
(if that is in their power), the refraining absolutely from 
the Use of all Commodities subject to the Duty. The Deficiency of the Revenue to pay the Salaries, and those to be 
made good by the Treasury here, might possibly put some 
Check to the Career. And if the Assemblies should at the 
same time decline giving any more annual Supports, and 
leave all Governors to their Appointments out of the Revenue, 
giving bountifully to a good Governor at the End of his Administration, and leaving bad ones to be rewarded by their 
Masters ; perhaps by this means some of that Influence with 
Governors might be retained, which induces them to treat the 
People with Equity and Moderation. But if our People will, 
by consuming such Commodities, purchase and pay for their 
Fetters, who that sees them so shackled, will think they 
deserve either Redress or Pity. Methinks that in drinking 
Tea, a true American, reflecting that by every Cup he contributed to the Salaries, Pensions, and Rewards of the Enemies 
and Persecutors of his Country, would be half choak'd at the 
Thought, and find no Quantity of Sugar sufficient to make 
the nauseous Draught go down. 
</p><p>
I hope your Health is restored, and that your valuable Life 
will be long continued, for the Benefit of your Friends, Family, 
and Country. 
</p><p>
With sincere and great Esteem, I am, dear Sir, 
Your affectionate and most obedient Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
This Ship, staying longer than was expected, gives me an 
Opportunity of writing to you, which I thought I must have 
missed when I desired Cousin Williams to excuse me to you. 
I receiv'd your kind Letter of September 25th, by the young 
Gentlemen, who, by their discreet Behaviour have recommended themselves very much to me and many of my Acquaintance. Josiah has attained his Heart's Desire, of being 
under the Tuition of Mr. Stanley, who, though he had long 
left off Teaching, kindly undertook, at my Request, to instruct him, and is much pleased with his Quickness of apprehension and the Progress he makes ; and Jonathan appears a 
very valuable young Man, sober, regular, and inclined to Industry and Frugality, which are promising Signs of Success 
in business. I am very happy in their Company. 
</p><p>
As to the Rumor you mention, (which was, as Josiah tells 
me, that I had been deprived of my Place in the PostOffice on 
account of a Letter I wrote to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>,) it might have 
this Foundation, that some of the Ministry had been displeased on my writing such Letters, and there were really 
some Thoughts among them of showing that Displeasure in 
that manner. But I had some Friends, too, who, unrequired 
by me, advis'd the Contrary. And my Enemies were forced 
to content themselves with abusing me plentifully in the Newspapers, and endeavouring to provoke me to resign. In this 
they are not likely to succeed, I being deficient in that Christian Virtue of Resignation. If they would have my Office, 
they must take it. 
</p><p>
I have heard of some great Man, whose Rule it was, with 
regard to Offices, never to ask for them, and never to refuse 
them; to which I have always added, in my own Practice, 
never to resign them. As I told my Friends, I rose to that 
Office through a long Course of Service in the inferior Degrees 
of it. Before my Time, through bad Management, it never 
produced the Salary annexed to it ; and, when I received it, no 
Salary was to be allowed, if the Office did not produce it. 
During the first four Years it was so far from defraying itself, 
that it became nine hundred and fifty Pounds Sterling in Debt 
to me and my Colleague. I had been chiefly instrumental 
in bringing it to its present flourishing State, and therefore 
thought I had some kind of Right to it. I had hitherto executed the Duties of it faithfully, and to the perfect Satisfaction of my Superiors, which I thought was all that should be 
expected of me on that Account. As to the Letters complained of, it was true I did write them, and they were written 
in compliance with another Duty, that to my Country; a 
Duty quite distinct from that of PostMaster. 
</p><p>
My Conduct in this respect was exactly similar to that I 
held on a similar Occasion but a few Years ago, when the 
then Ministry were ready to hug me for the Assistance I 
afforded them of repealing a former revenue Act. My Sentiments were still the same, that no such Acts should be made 
here for America ; or, if made, should as soon as possible be 
repealed ; and I thought it should not be expected of me to 
change my political Opinions every time his Majesty thought 
fit to change his Ministers. This was my Language on the 
occasion ; and I have lately heard, that, though I was thought 
much to blame, it being understood that every man who holds 
an office should act with the ministry, whether agreeable or 
not to his own judgment, yet, in consideration of the goodness 
of my private character (as they were pleased to compliment 
me), the office was not to be taken from me. 
</p><p>
Possibly they may still change their minds, and remove 
me; but no apprehension of that sort will, I trust, make the 
least alteration in my political conduct. My rule, in which I 
have always found satisfaction, is, never to turn aside in public affairs through views of private interest ; but to go straight 
forward in doing what appears to me right at the time, leaving 
the consequences with <a href='/results.php?city=providence' rel='city'>Providence</a>. What in my younger days 
enabled me more easily to walk upright, was, that I had a 
trade, and that I knew I could live upon little ; and thence 
(never having had views of making a fortune) I was free from 
avarice, and contented with the plentiful supplies my business 
afforded me. And now it is still more easy for me to preserve 
my freedom and integrity, when I consider that I am almost at the end of my journey, and therefore need less to complete 
the expense of it ; and that what I now possess, through the 
blessing of God, may, with tolerable economy, be sufficient 
for me (great misfortunes excepted), though I should add 
nothing more to it by any office or employment whatsoever. 
</p><p>
I send you by this opportunity the two books you wrote 
for. They cost three shillings apiece. When I was first in 
London, about forty-five years since, I knew a person, who 
had an opinion something like your author's. Her name was 
Hive, a printer's widow. She died soon after I left England, 
and by her will obliged her son to deliver publicly, in Salters' 
Hall, a solemn discourse, the purport of which was to prove, 
that this world is the true Hell, or place of punishment for the 
spirits, who had transgressed in a better state, and were sent 
here to suffer for their sins in animals of all sorts. It is long 
since I saw the discourse, which was printed. I think a good 
deal of Scripture was cited in it, and that the supposition was, 
that, though we now remembered nothing of such a preexistent state, yet after death we might recollect it, and remember the punishments we had suffered, so as to be the 
better for them; and others, who had not yet offended, 
might now behold and be warned by our sufferings. 
</p><p>
In fact, we see here, that every lower animal has its enemy, 
with proper inclinations, faculties, and weapons, to terrify, 
wound, and destroy it; and that men, who are uppermost, 
are devils to one another ; so that, on the established doctrine 
of the goodness and justice of the great Creator, this apparent state of general and systematical mischief seemed to demand 
some such supposition as Mrs. Hive's, to account for it consistently with the honour of the Deity. But our reasoning 
powers, when employed about what may have been before our 
existence here, or shall be after it, cannot go far, for want of 
history and facts. Revelation only can give us the necessary 
information, and that, in the first of these points especially, 
has been very sparingly afforded us. 
</p><p>
I hope you continue to correspond with your friends at 
<a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. My love to your children; and believe me 
</p><p>
ever your affectionate brother, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
Since mine of December 24th, I have been honoured by 
the letter from the Committee, dated December 17th, which, 
with yours of November 6th, now lies before me. 
</p><p>
The doctrine of the right of Parliament to lay taxes on 
America is now almost generally given up here, and one seldom meets in conversation with any, who continue to assert 
it. But there are still many, who think that the dignity and 
honour of Parliament, and of the nation, are so much engaged, 
as that no formal renunciation of the claim is ever to be expected. We ought to be contented, they say, with a forbearance of any attempt hereafter to exercise such right ; and this 
they would have us rely on as a certainty. Hints are also 
given, that the duties now subsisting may be gradually withdrawn, as soon as a regard to that dignity will permit it to 
be decently done, without subjecting government to the contempt of all Europe, as being compelled into measures by the 
refractoriness of the colonies. How far this may be depended 
on, no one can say. The presumption rather is, that if by 
time, we become so accustomed to these, as to pay them without discontent, no minister will afterwards think of taking 
them off, but rather be encouraged to add others. 
</p><p>
Perhaps there was never an instance of a colony so much 
and so long persecuted with vehement and malicious abuse, 
as ours has been, for near two years past, by its enemies here 
and those who reside in it. The design apparently was, by 
rendering us odious, as well as contemptible, to prevent all 
concern for us in the friends of liberty here, when the projects 
of oppressing us further, and depriving us of our rights by 
various violent measures, should be carried into execution. 
Of late, this abuse has abated ; the sentiments of a majority 
of the ministers are, I think, become more favourable towards 
us ; and I have reason to believe, that all those projects are 
now laid aside. The projectors themselves, too, are, I believe, 
somewhat diminished in their credit; and it appears not 
likely that any new schemes of the kind will be listened to, if 
fresh occasion is not administered from our side the water. 
It seems, however, too early yet to expect such an attention 
to our complaints, as would be necessary to obtain an immediate redress of our grievances. A little time is requisite; 
but no opportunity will be lost by your agents, of stating them 
where it may be of use, and inculcating the necessity of removing them, for the strength and safety of the empire. And 
I hope the colony Assemblies will show, by frequently repeated resolves, that they know their rights, and do not lose 
sight of them. Our growing importance will ere long compel 
an acknowledgment of them, and establish and secure them 
to our posterity. 
</p><p>
In case of my leaving this country, which I may possibly 
do in the ensuing summer, I shall put into the hands of Dr. 
Lee all the papers relating to your affairs, which I have 
received from you, or from the son of your late agent, Mr. De Berdt. The present American secretary, Lord Hillsborough, has indeed objected to the Assembly's appointment, 
and insists that no agent ought to be received or attended to, 
by government here, who is not appointed by an act of the 
General Court, to which the governor has given his assent. 
This doctrine, if he could establish it, would in a manner give 
to his Lordship the power of appointing, or at least negativing 
any choice of the House of Representatives and Council, 
since it would be easy for him to instruct the governor not to 
assent to the appointment of such and such men, who are 
obnoxious to him; so that, if the appointment is annual, 
every agent that valued his post must consider himself as 
holding it by the favour of his Lordship, and of course too 
much obliged to him to oppose his measures, however contrary to the interest of the province. 
</p><p>
Of what use such agents would be, it is easy to judge ; and, 
although I am assured, that, notwithstanding this fancy of 
his Lordship, any memorial, petition, or other address from, 
or in behalf of, the House of Representatives to the King in 
Council, or to either House of Parliament, would be received 
from your agent as usual, yet, on this occasion, I cannot but 
wish, that the public character of a colony agent was better understood and settled, as well as the political relation between 
the colonists and the mother country. 
</p><p>
When they come to be considered in the light of distinct 
states, as I conceive they really are, possibly their agents may 
be treated with more respect, and considered more as public 
ministers. Under the present American administration, they 
are rather looked on with an evil eye, as obstructers of ministerial measures ; and the Secretary would, I imagine, be well 
pleased to get rid of them, being, as he has sometimes intimated, of opinion that agents are unnecessary, for that, whatever is to be transacted between the assemblies of colonies 
and the government here, may be done through and by the 
governor's letters, and more properly than by any agent whatever. In truth, your late nominations, particularly of Dr. 
Lee and myself, have not been at all agreeable to his Lordship. 
</p><p>
I purpose, however, to draw up a memorial, stating our 
rights and grievances, and, in the name and behalf of the 
province, protesting particularly against the late innovations 
in respect to the military power obtruded on the civil, as well 
as the other infringements of the charter; and at a proper 
time, if Mr. Bollan on due consideration approves of it and 
will join me in it, to present it to his Majesty in Council. 
Whether speedy redress is or is not the consequence, I imagine 
it may be of good use to keep alive our claims, and show, that 
we have not given up the contested points, though we take no 
violent measures to obtain them. 
</p><p>
A notion has been much inculcated here by our enemies, 
that any farther concession on the part of Great Britain would 
only serve to increase our demands. I have constantly given 
it as my opinion, that, if the colonies were restored to the state 
they were in before the Stamp Act, they would be satisfied, 
and contend no further. As in this I have been supposed not 
to know, or not to speak the sentiments of the Americans, I 
am glad to find the same so fully expressed in the Committee's 
letter. It was certainly, as I have often urged, bad policy, 
when they attempted to heal our differences by repealing part 
of the duties only ; as it is bad surgery to leave splinters in a 
wound, which must prevent its healing, or in time occasion it 
to open afresh. 
</p><p>
There is no doubt of the intention to make governors and 
some other officers independent of the people for their support, and that this purpose will be persisted in, if the American revenue is found sufficient to defray the salaries. Many 
think this so necessary a measure, that, even if there were no 
such revenue, the money should issue out of the treasury here. 
But this, I apprehend, would hardly be the case, there being 
so many demands at home; and the salaries of so many 
officers in so many colonies would amount to such an immense 
sum, that probably the burden would be found too great, and 
the providing for the expense of their own governments be 
left to the colonies themselves. 
</p><p>
I shall watch every thing that may be moved to the detriment of the province, and use my best endeavours for its 
service. 
</p><p>
No public notice has yet been taken of the inflammatory 
paper mentioned by the Committee, as stuck up in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; 
and I think the indiscretion of individuals is not now so likely, 
as it has been of late, to make general impressions to our disadvantage. With the greatest respect, &c.

DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I am very sensible of the honour done me by your House of 
Representatives, in appointing me their Agent here. It will 
make me extreamly happy, if I can render them any valuable 
Service. I have had several Conferences with Mr. Bollan 
on their Affairs. 
</p><p>
There is a good Understanding between us which I shall 
endeavour to cultivate. At present the Cloud, that threatened our Charter Liberties, seems to be blown over. In 
time, I hope harmony will be restored between the two 
Countries, by leaving us in the full possession and enjoyment 
of our Rights. 
</p><p>
It will be a great pleasure to me if I can be any way useful 
to your Son while he stays in England ; being with the greatest 
Esteem and Respect for you and Mrs. Bowdoin, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient & most humble Servant 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Inclos'd I send you a Copy of an original Paper of 
some curiosity now in my hands. The first part, i.e. the 
Queries you will find in the papers pertaining to the Governor's 
History, but not the Abstract or state given with them to <a href='/results.php?tla=edp' rel=''>Mr. Randolph</a>.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have just received your kind Favour of January i by <a href='/results.php?tla=jab' rel='met'>Mr. Bowdoin</a>, to whom I should be glad to render any Service 
here. I wrote to you some Weeks since in Answer to yours of 
July and November, expressing my Sentiments without the 
least Reserve on Points that require free Discussion, as I know 
I can confide in your Prudence not to hurt my Usefulness here, 
by making me more obnoxious than I must necessarily be 
from that known Attachment to the American Interest, which 
my Duty as well as Inclination demands of me. 
</p><p>
In the same Confidence I send you the inclosed Extract 
from my Journal, containing a late Conference between the 
Secretary l and your Friend, in which you will see a little of 
his Temper : It is one of the many Instances of his Behaviour 
and Conduct, that have given me the very mean Opinion I 
entertain of his Abilities and Fitness for his Station. His 
Character is Conceit, Wrongheadedness, Obstinacy, and 
Passion. Those, who would speak most favourably of him, 
allow all this ; they only add, that he is an honest Man, and 
means well. If that be true, as perhaps it may, I wish him a 
better Place, where only Honesty and Well-meaning are required, and where his other Qualities can do no harm. 
Had the War taken place, I have reason to believe he would 
have been removed. He had, I think, some Apprehensions 
of it himself at the Time I was with him. I hope, however, 
that our Affairs will not much longer be perplex'd and embarass'd by his perverse and senseless Management. I have 
since heard, that his Lordship took great Offence at some of 
my last Words, which he calls extreamly rude and abusive. 
He assured a Friend of mine, that they were equivalent to 
telling him to his Face, that the Colonies could expect neither 
Favour nor Justice during his Administration. I find he did 
not mistake me. 
</p><p>
It is true, as you have heard, that some of my Letters to 
America have been echo'd back hither; but that has not been 
the Case with any that were written to you. Great Umbrage 
was taken, but chiefly by Lord Hillsborough, who was disposed before to be angry with me, and therefore the Inconvenience was the less; and, whatever the Consequences are 
of his Displeasure, putting all my Offences together, I must 
bear them as well as I can. Not but that, if there is to be 
War between us, I shall do my best to defend myself and 
annoy my Adversary, little regarding the story of the Earthen 
Pot and Brazen Pitcher. One encouragement I have, the 
knowledge, that he is not a whit better lik'd by his Colleagues 
in the Ministry, than he is by me, that he cannot probably 
continue where he is much longer, and that he can scarce be 
succeeded by anybody, who will not like me the better for his 
having been at Variance with me. 
</p><p>
Pray continue Writing to me, as you find Opportunity. 
Your candid, clear, and well written Letters, be assured, are 
of great use. With the highest Esteem, I am, my dear

DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I have not now before me your letter, which came with the 
sample of silk, having put it into the hands of Mr. Walpole 
with the sample, who has promised me full and particular 
answers to all your queries, after the silk has been thoroughly 
examined. In the mean time he tells me, the best sort appears to him to be worth in itself twenty-seven or twenty eight shillings a pound, and will fetch that price when some 
imperfections in the reeling it are remedied. He tells me 
farther, that the best eggs are to be had from Valencia in 
Spain, whence he will procure some for you against the next 
year ; the worms from those eggs being the strongest, healthiest, and producing the finest silk of any others; and he 
thinks you should get some reelers from Italy, which he would 
likewise undertake to do for you if desired. He is one of 
the most opulent and noble-spirited merchants of this kingdom. 
</p><p>
I shall write to you fully by Osborne, with all the information I can procure. In the mean time, please to present my 
respects to the gentlemen concerned in the affair, and assure 
them of my best services. I am, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind favour of Nov. 9. and am glad to hear 
of the Welfare of you and yours. 
</p><p>
Mentioning to a Friend of mine, Mr. Wooller, an Engineer, 
your Idea of Paint and Sand, to make Roofs durable and safer 
from Fire (which I hope you will try, as I think it very likely 
to succeed) he communicated to me an Account of a new 
Method of Covering, in the North, that is in some respects 
similar, may be as durable, but in my Opinion not so safe. 
Perhaps it may be of Use for Summer-Houses, Barns, Outhouses, or Buildings where no Fire comes; (and therefore 
I send you the Account enclosed) but I think I should not 
care to trust it in a Dwelling-House, in a Town, unless the 
under Side of the Boards was lathed & plaistered between the 
Rafters, which would add to the Expence : For tho' the Outside, hardened by the Air, and paved as it were, by the Sand, 
Shells, &c. might not readily take fire, the Tar coming thro' 
the Seams or Cracks of the Boards might be readily inflamed 
by a Candle from the Inside, placed carelessly by Servants 
in the Garret. 
</p><p>
The Flatness of the Roof, as well as of those with Copper, 
lessens a good deal the Areas to be covered, and of course the 
Expence. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that you have good Workmen in the 
Stucco Way, and that it is likely to take place of Wainscot. 
</p><p>
In some of the Paris Buildings the Floors are thus formed. 
The Joists are large and square, and laid with two of their 
Corners up and down, whereby their sloping Sides afford 
Butments for intermediate Arches of Brick. Over the whole 
is laid an Inch or two of Loom and on that the Tiles of the 
Floor, which are often six-square, & painted. The lower 
Corner of the Joists is cut off enough to admit of nailing 
to them the Laths that are to hold the Plaister of the Cieling of the Room beneath. Where there is any Apprehension of Walls spreading by the Weight of such Floor, they 
are prevented by Bars of Iron, with external SS. This kind 
of Floor seems safe from Fire : For the Joists in Contact with 
the Bricks above, and shielded by the Plaister Cieling below 
are not very likely to kindle and burn. It likewise prevents 
in a great degree the Noise of what is doing over-head offending those below. But it is heavy, takes up more Room, requires great Strength of Timber and is supposed more expensive than Boards. I apprehend those Arches are not generally used; but the Tiles are more commonly laid upon 
rough Boards & the Joints clos'd with fine Mortar or some 
kind of Cement. 
</p><p>
Plaster Floors are of late coming again into Use here. I 
know not whether we have the proper Materials in our Province ; but I have been told there are Quarries of the kind in 
Nova Scotia near navigable Water. I send you however 
an Account of the Method of managing it. All from my 
Friend the ingenious Mr Wooller. 
</p><p>
Remember me respectfully & affectionately to M rs Rhoads 
& my dear old Friend Mrs Paschal. 
</p><p>
With sincere Esteem, I am, dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN 
</p><p>
I send you also a Pamphlet on the Subject of securing 
Houses from Fire tho' the Method is perhaps impracticable 
with us.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your several Favours of Oct. 9. and December 13. inclosing Bills of Exchange, viz. On which are paid and carried to the Credit of the Province 
Account. I am much obliged to you and the Assembly 
for so readily transmitting them; and it makes me very 
happy to understand that my Endeavours in their Service are 
in any degree acceptable. 
</p><p>
Notwithstanding the ample Recommendations brought 
over by M r Winter, the Bishop of London has refused him 
Ordination, for two Reasons, as I understand, his mechanical 
Education, and his Connection with M r Whitefield & the 
Methodists. I did not think either of these of so much 
Weight as to discourage me from attempting to get him 
ordain'd by some other Bishop of London as might overcome 
his Lordship's Objections. Accordingly I endeavoured 
to engage in his Favour the Associates of D r Bray, a Society 
of which I have long been a Member. As it was established 
for Purposes similar to that of M r Louberbuhler's Will, I 
hope they would readily have afforded us the Weight of their 
Recommendation, or my laying before them a Copy of the 
Will, Copies of several Letters from you and M r Flabersham, 
&c. But the Idea of his being a Methodist, and the Imagination of his neglecting the Negroes and becoming an Itinerant Preacher, disturbing regular Congregations, &c. &c. 
as soon as he should obtain Ordination, I found were thought 
sufficient Reason to prevent their concerning themselves in 
the Affair. However I do not yet quite despair of it. 
</p><p>
Mentioning M r Whitefield, I cannot forbear expressing the 
Pleasure it gave me to see in the Newspapers an Account of 
the Respect paid to his Memory by your Assembly. I knew 
him intimately upwards of thirty years. His Integrity, 
Disinterestedness, and indefatigable Zeal in prosecuting every 
good Work, I have never seen equalled, I shall never see exceeded. 
</p><p>
The enclosed Paper has been put into my Hand by M r Maudit, a principal Man among the Dissenters here. I 
promised him to communicate it to you. The Dissenters 
were for complaining to Government, and petitioning for 
Redress; but M r Maudit advis'd that M r Frink should first 
be written to, as possibly he might be dissuaded from persisting in such Demands. I know nothing of the Circumstances 
but what appears in the Paper, nor am I acquainted with 
your Laws; but I make no doubt you will advise what is 
proper and prudent to be done in the Affair. The Dissenters 
in those Northern Colonies where they are predominant, 
have by Laws exempted those of the Church of England residing among them from all Rates and Payments toward the 
Support of the Dissenting Clergy ; and methinks it would be 
a Pity to give them a Handle against re-enacting those Law 
when they expire ; for they are temporary, and their perpetual 
Laws tax all Sects alike. The Colonies have Adversaries 
enow to their common Privileges : They should endeavour to 
agree among themselves, and avoid everything that may 
make Ill-Blood and promote Divisions, which must weaken 
them in their common Defence. 
</p><p>
If the Laws of your Province are printed, I should wish to 
be furnished with a Copy; it must be sometimes of Use to 
me in the Management of your Business. 
</p><p>
With great Esteem and Respect, I have the Honour to be, 
Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient 
</p><p>
humble Servant 
</p><p>
B FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I shall shortly write fully to the Committee relating 
to the Matters referr'd in the Letter of May 23, '70 in the 
mean time be so good as to inform them that the Business has 
not been neglected. The Hurry in our Public Councils during 
the first Part of the Winter, occasion'd by the Expectation 
of an immediate foreign War, and the domestic Confusion 
that took place after the Convention, have been great Hindrances to proceeding in American Affairs.

LOVING COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I suppose Jonathan has told you, that the lottery is drawn, 
and your two new tickets had the same success as the former, 
namely, one twenty-pound prize, and one blank. Would 
you go on any further? 
</p><p>
Josiah is very happy in being under the tuition of Mr. Stanley, who very kindly undertook him at my request, 
though he had left off teaching. Josiah goes constantly, too, 
to several concerts, besides operas and oratorios, so that his 
thirst for music is in a way of being thoroughly satiated. 
This is the principal expense; for, in all other respects, I 
never saw two young men from America more prudent and 
frugal, than he and his brother are. 
</p><p>
Jonathan seems to have an excellent turn for business, 
and to be a perfect master of accounts. In the latter he has 
been of great use to me, having put all mine in order for me. 
There is a proposal from his uncle of his going to East India, 
as a writer in the Company's service, which I wish may take 
place, as I think, if he lives, he cannot fail bringing home a fortune. He had ordered a cargo of goods to be sent you for 
cousin Wood's shop, and had given expectations of paying 
ready money. But, one of your bills being protested, there 
seemed a necessity of asking some credit of the merchant. 
I advised him to take what was wanting of me, rather than 
fail in punctuality to his word, which is sacred here among all 
that would maintain a character in trade. He did so; and 
thereby also saved the discount without putting me to the 
least inconvenience, provided the money is replaced in six 
months ; and I was glad I had it in my power to accommodate him. 
</p><p>
I hope you have before this time got another tenant for 
your house, and at the former rent. However, I would have 
you go on advancing to my sister the amount of it, as I am 
persuaded she cannot well do without it. She has, indeed, 
been very unfortunate in her children. I am glad to hear, 
that, as soon as the weather permits, the tomb will receive 
a thorough repair. Your kind care in this matter will greatly 
</p><p>
oblige your affectionate uncle, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter with your Sons. They are, I 
assure you, exceeding welcome to me ; and they behave with 
so much Prudence, that no two young Men could possibly 
less need the Advice you would have me give them. Josiah is very happily employ'd in his Musical Pursuits. And as you 
hinted to me, that it would be agreable to you, if I employ'd 
Jonathan in Writing, I requested him to put my Accounts in 
Order, which had been much neglected. He undertook it 
with the utmost chearfulness and Readiness, and executed 
it with the greatest Diligence, making me a compleat new Set 
of Books, fairly written out and settled in a mercantile Manner, which is a great Satisfaction to me, and a very considerable Service. I mention this, that you may not be in the 
least Uneasy from an Apprehension of their Visit being 
burthensome to me ; it being, I assure you, quite the contrary. 
</p><p>
It has been wonderful to me to see a young Man from 
America, in a Place so full of various Amusements as London 
is, as attentive to Business, as diligent in it, and keeping as 
close at home till it was finished, as if it had been for his own 
Profit; and as if he had been at the Publick Diversions so 
often, as to be tired of them. 
</p><p>
I pray God to keep and preserve you and yours, and give 
you again, in due time, a happy Sight of these valuable Sons ; 
</p><p>
being your affectionate Uncle, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
It is long since I have heard from you. The last Packet 
brought me no Letter, and there are two Packets now due. 
It is supposed that the long easterly Winds have kept them 
back. We have had a severe and tedious Winter here. 
There is not yet the smallest Appearance of Spring. Not 
a Bud has push'd out, nor a Blade of Grass. The Turnips 
that us'd to feed the Cattle have been destroy'd by the Frost. 
The Hay in most Parts of the Country is gone, and the Cattle 
perishing for Want, the Lambs dying by thousands, thro' 
Cold and scanty Nourishment. Tuesday last I went to dine 
at our Friend Sir Matthew Featherstone's thro a heavy 
Storm of Snow. His Windows you know look into the Park. 
Towards Evening I observed the Snow still lying over all the Park, for the Ground was before too cold to thaw it, being 
itself frozen & Ice in the Canal. You cannot imagine a more 
winterlike Prospect! Sir M. and Lady F. always enquire 
kindly of your Welfare: As do Mr. and Mrs. Sargent. 
</p><p>
Sir John Pringle has heard from Mr. Bowman of your kindness to that gent n , and desires I would present his particular 
Acknowledgments for the Attention you have paid to his Recommendation. The Ohio Affair seems now near a Conclusion. And if the present Ministry stand a little longer, I 
think it will be compleated to our Satisfaction. <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a> 
has been indefatigable, and I think scarce any one I know 
besides would have been equal to the Task, so difficult it is 
to get Business forward here, in which some Party Purpose 
is not to be served: But he is among them, eternally, & 
leaves no Stone unturn'd. I would, however, advise you not 
to say anything of our Prospect of Success, till the Event 
appears, for many things happen between the Cup & the Lip. 
</p><p>
I have attended several Times this Winter upon your 
Acts of Assembly. The Board are not favourably disposed 
towards your Insolvent Acts, pretending to doubt whether 
distant Creditors, particularly such as reside in England, may 
not sometimes be injured by them. I have had a good deal 
of Conversation with Mr. Jackson about them, who remarks 
that whatever Care the Assembly may, according to my Representation of their Practice, take in examining into the Cases 
to prevent Injustice, yet upon the Face of the Acts nothing of that Care appears. The Preambles only say that such 
& such Persons have petitioned & set forth the Hardship 
of their Imprisonment, but not a Word of the Assembly's 
having enquired into the Allegations contained in such Petitions and found them true, not a Word of the general Consent 
of the principal Creditors, or of any publick Notice given of 
the Debtor's Intention to apply for such an Act; all which 
he thinks should appear in the Preambles, and then those 
Acts would be subject to less Objection and Difficulty in 
getting them through the Offices here. I would have you 
communicate this to the Speaker of the Assembly, with my 
best Respects. I doubt some of those Acts will be repeal'd. 
Nothing has been done, or is now likely to be done by the 
Parliament in American Affairs: The House of Commons 
& the City of London are got into a violent Controversy, 
that seems at present to engross the publick Attention, and 
the Session cannot continue much longer. 
</p><p>
By this Ship I send the Picture that you left with Meyer. 
He has never yet finished the Miniatures. The other Pictures I send with it are for my own House, but this you may 
</p><p>
take to yours.

SIR, 
</p><p>
I duly received your Favours of the 4'? of October and the 
if' of November. It gave me Pleasure to hear, that tho' 
the Merchants had departed from their Agreement of NonImportation, the Spirit of Industry and Frugality was likely 
to continue among the People. I am obliged to you for your 
Concern on my Account. The Letters you mention gave 
great Offence here ; but that was not attended with the immediate ill Consequences to my Interest that seem to have been 
hoped for by those that sent Copies of them hither. 
</p><p>
If our Country People would well consider, that all they 
save in refusing to purchase foreign Gewgaws, & in making 
their own Apparel, being apply'd to the Improvement of 
their Plantations, would render those more profitable, as 
yielding a greater Produce, I should hope they would persist 
resolutely in their present commendable Industry and Frugality. And there is still a farther Consideration. The 
Colonies that produce Provisions grow very fast: But of 
the Countries that take off those Provisions, some do not increase at all, as the European Nations ; and others, as the West 
India Colonies, not in the same proportion. So that tho' 
the Demand at present may be sufficient, it cannot long continue so. Every Manufacturer encouraged in our Country, 
makes part of a Market for Provisions within ourselves, 
and saves so much Money to the Country as must otherwise 
be exported to pay for the Manufactures he supplies. Here 
in England it is well known and understood, that whenever 
a Manufacture is established which employs a Number of 
Hands, it raises the Value of Lands in the neighbouring 
Country all around it; partly by the greater Demand near 
at hand for the produce of the Land; and partly from the 
Plenty of Money drawn by the Manufacturers to that part 
of the Country. It seems therefore the Interest of all our 
Farmers and Owners of Lands, to encourage our young 
Manufactures in preference to foreign ones imported among 
us from distant Countries. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged by your kind Present of curious Seeds. 
They were welcome Gifts to some of my Friends. I send 
you herewith some of the new Barley lately introduced into 
this Country, & now highly spoken of, I wish it may be 
found of Use with us. 
</p><p>
I was the more pleased to see in your Letter the Improvement of our Paper, having had a principal Share in establishing that Manufacture among us many Years ago, by the 
Encouragement I gave it. 
</p><p>
If in anything I can serve you here, it will be a Pleasure to 
Your obliged Friend 
</p><p>
and humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B FRANKLIN.

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
I have received your favour of the 27th of February, 
with the Journal of the House of Representatives, and copies 
of the late oppressive prosecutions in the Admiralty Court, 
which I shall, as you direct, communicate to Mr. Bollan, 
and consult with him on the most advantageous use to be 
made of them for the interest of the province. 
</p><p>
I think one may clearly see, in the system of customs to 
be exacted in America by act of Parliament, the seeds sown 
of a total disunion of the two countries, though, as yet, that 
event may be at a considerable distance. \\ The course and natural progress seems to be, first, the appointment of needy 
men as officers, for others do not care to leave England; 
then, their necessities make them rapacious, their office makes 
them proud and insolent, their insolence and rapacity make 
them odious, and, being conscious that they are hated, they 
become malicious; their malice urges them to a continual 
abuse of the inhabitants in their letters to administration, 
representing them as disaffected and rebellious, and (to 
encourage the use of severity) as weak, divided, timid, and 
cowardly. Government believes all; thinks it necessary 
to support and countenance its officers; their quarrelling 
with the people is deemed a mark and consequence of their 
fidelity; they are therefore more highly rewarded, and this 
makes their conduct still more insolent and provoking. 
</p><p>
The resentment of the people will, at times and on particular incidents, burst into outrages and violence upon such 
officers, and this naturally draws down severity and acts of 
further oppression from hence. The more the people are dissatisfied, the more rigor will be thought necessary; severe 
punishments will be inflicted to terrify ; rights and privileges 
will be abolished ; greater force will then be required to secure 
execution and submission; the expense will become enormous; it will then be thought proper, by fresh exactions, 
to make the people defray it ; thence, the British nation and 
government will become odious, the subjection to it will 
be deemed no longer tolerable; war ensues, and the bloody 
struggle will end in absolute slavery to America, or ruin to 
Britain by the loss of her colonies ; the latter most probable, 
from America's growing strength and magnitude. 
</p><p>
But, as the whole empire must, in either case, be greatly 
weakened, I cannot but wish to see much patience and the 
utmost discretion in our general conduct, that the fatal period 
may be postponed, and that, whenever this catastrophe shall 
happen, it may appear to all mankind, that the fault has not 
been ours. And, since the collection of these duties has 
already cost Britain infinitely more, in the loss of commerce, 
than they amount to, and that loss is likely to continue and 
increase by the encouragement given to our manufactures 
through resentment; and since the best pretence for establishing and enforcing the duties is the regulation of trade for 
the general advantage, it seems to me, that it would be much 
better for Britain to give them up, on condition of the colonies undertaking to enforce and collect such, as are thought 
fit to be continued, by laws of their own, and officers of their 
own appointment, for the public uses of their respective 
governments. This would alone destroy those seeds of disunion, and both countries might thence much longer continue 
to grow great together, more secure by their united strength, 
and more formidable to their common enemies. But the 
power of appointing friends and dependents to profitable 
offices is too pleasing to most administrations, to be easily 
parted with or lessened; and therefore such a proposition 
if it were made, is not very likely to meet with attention. 
</p><p>
I do not pretend to the gift of prophecy. History shows, 
that, by these steps, great empires have crumbled heretofore ; 
and the late transactions we have so much cause to complain 
of show, that we are in the same train, and that, without a 
greater share of prudence and wisdom, than we have seen 
both sides to be possessed of, we shall probably come to the 
same conclusion. 
</p><p>
The Parliament, however, is prorogued, without having 
taken any of the steps we had been threatened with, relating 
to our charter. Their attention has been engrossed by other 
affairs, and we have therefore longer time to operate in making such impressions, as may prevent a renewal of this particular attempt by our adversaries. With great esteem and 
respect, I have the honour to be, &c. B FRANKLIN.

Being greatly hurried in preparing for my Journey, I have

Allemand's Paper : But you will meet with no Difficulty

contented with such Provisions and Cookery, as you meet 
with in the Inns, so you will have the best the Country affords 
in the Season, which you cannot know so as to direct, and if 
you attempt to direct the Cookery they will not understand 
or be able to follow your Orders, & whatever Difficulties you 
put them to they will be sure to charge you extravagantly 
for, particularly in Holland. I inclose a Card of the House 
at which I lodg'd in Paris. It is a good one, that I can recommend to you. If full, Mrs. Mean, the Landlady, will

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have lately made a Journey of a Fortnight, to Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, and Manchester, and returned only in 
time to be at Court on the King's Birthday, which was yesterday. The Joy was in a fair way of being doubled on the same 
Day, for the Queen was deliver' d early this Morning of another Prince, the eighth Child, there being now six Princes 
and two Princesses, all lovely Children. The Prince of 
Wales & the Bishop of Oszabrug appear'd yesterday for 
the first time in the Drawingroom, and gave great Pleasure 
by their sensible, manly Behaviour. My Journey has been 
of use to my Health, the Air and Exercise have given me 
fresh Spirits, and I feel now exceeding well, Thanks to God. 
</p><p>
I wrote to you lately, and have received no Line from you 
by Capt. Sparks who is arrived. I suppose you have written 
by Falconer, who is not yet heard of. My love to our Children and Grandson. I am as ever, your affectionate husband,

SIR : I received your Favour of the 3oth of April a few 
Days since, with the Newspapers, etc., and am much obliged 
by the Information you as a private Person so kindly give me 
of the present state of Affairs in your Province. Such a confidential Correspondence between us I most willingly embrace, 
as I am persuaded it must be often useful in the prudent conduct of our publick interests to interchange Intelligence that 
cannot so properly or safely appear in Publick Letters, since 
nothing written to or from an Assembly can be kept from the 
Knowledge of Adversaries, who may take Advantage of it, 
to the Prejudice of our Affairs and of the Persons concerned 
in the Management of them. 
</p><p>
The continuing our General Court at <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a> has always 
appeared to me a Measure extreamly impolitic in Government here, as it can tend only to irritate the Members, offend 
the People in general, and create an ill-humour that can never 
be for his Majesty's Service or the Benefit of this Nation. 
For supposing the Province to be ever so great an Offender, 
this is not a Punishment sufficient to reform by its severity ; 
it is rather more fitted to affront and provoke. You will 
therefore hardly understand it, if you do not well know the 
Character of the present American Secretary, proud, supercilious, extreamly conceited, moderate as they are, of his 
political knowledge and Abilities, fond of every one that can 
stoop to flatter him, and inimical to all that dare tell him disagreable Truths. This Man's Mandates have been treated 
with Disrespect in America, his Letters have been criticised, 
his Measures censur'd and despis'd; which has produced 
in him a kind of settled Malice against the Colonies, particularly ours, that would break out into greater Violence if 
cooler Heads did not set some Bounds to it. I have indeed 
good Reason to believe that his Conduct is far from being 
approved by the King's other Servants, and that he himself 
is so generally dislik'd by them that it is not probable he 
will continue much longer in his present Station, the general Wish here being to recover (saving only the Dignity of Government) the Good- Will of the Colonies, which there is little 
reason to expect while they are under his wild Administration. Their permitting so long his Eccentricities (if I may 
use such an Expression) is owing, I imagine, rather to the 
Difficulty of knowing how to dispose of or what to do with a 
man of his wrong-headed bustling Industry, who, it is apprehended, may be more mischievous out of Administration than 
in it, than to any kind of personal Regard for him. 
</p><p>
All Views or Expectations of drawing any considerable 
Revenue to this Country from the Colonies are, I believe, 
generally given over, and it seems probable that nothing 
of that kind will ever again be attempted. But as Foreign 
Courts appear to have taken great Pleasure in the Prospect 
of our Disunion, it seems now to be thought necessary for 
supporting the National Weight and the Influence of our 
Court abroad, that there should be an Appearance as if all 
was pacified in America; and, as I said before, I think the 
general Wish is that it may be really so. But then there is 
an Apprehension lest a too sudden yielding to all our Claims 
should be deem'd the Effect of Weakness, render the British 
Court contemptible in the Eyes of Foreigners ; make us more 
presumptuous, and promote more extravagant Demands 
such as could never be granted, and thence still greater 
Danger of a fatal Rupture. I am thus particular, that you 
may judge whether it will not be prudent in us to indulge 
the Mother Country in this Concern for her own Honour, 
so far as may be consistent with the Preservation of our essential Rights, especially as that Honour may in some Cases be 
of Importance to the General Welfare. And in this View, 
whether it will not be better gradually to wear off the assum'd 
Authority of Parliament over America, which we have in 
too many Instances given countenance to, with our indiscrete 
Acknowledgment of it in Publick Acts, than by a General open Denial and Resistance to it, bring on prematurely a 
Contest to which, if we are not found equal, that Authority 
will by the Event be more strongly establish'd; and if we 
should prove superior, yet by the Division, the general strength 
of the British Nation must be greatly diminished. I do not 
venture to advise in this Case, because I see in this seemingly 
prudent Course some Danger of a diminishing Attention to 
our Rights, instead of a persevering Endeavor to recover 
and establish them; but I rely a good deal on the growing 
Knowledge of them among the Americans, and the daily 
increasing Strength and Importance of that Country to this, 
which must give such Weight in time to our just Claims 
as no selfish Spirit in this Part of the Empire will be able to 
resist. In the meantime, while we are declining the usurped 
Authority of Parliament, I wish to see a steady dutiful Attachment to the King and his Family maintained among us; 
and that however we may be induced for Peace-sake, or from 
a Sense of our present Inability, to submit at present in some 
Instances to the Exercise of that unjust Authority, we shall 
continue from time to time to assert our Rights in occasional 
solemn Resolves and other publick Acts, never yielding them 
up, and avoiding even the slightest Expressions that seem 
confirmatory of the Claim that has been set up against them. 
My Opinion has long been that Parliament had originally 
no Right to bind us by any kind of Law whatever without our 
Consent. We have indeed in a manner consented to some of 
them, at least tacitly. But for the future methinks we should 
be cautious how we add to those Instances, and never adopt or acknowledge an Act of Parliament but by a formal Law 
of our own, as your General Assembly I think did in the case 
of the Act of Parliament relating to the Oaths mention' d 
in the first Paragraph of your Votes ; tho' as it stands there, 
it seems as if the Act of Parliament had required those 
Oaths to be taken by your Members, and was acknowledged 
as of force for that purpose. 
</p><p>
I do not at present see the least likelihood of preventing 
the Grant of Salaries or Pensions from hence to the King's 
Officers in America, by any Application in Behalf of the 
People there. It is look'd on as a strange thing here to object to the King's paying his own servants sent among us to 
do his Business ; and they say we would seem to have much 
more Reason of Complaint if it were requir'd of us to pay 
them. And the more we urge the Impropriety of their not 
depending on us for their Support, the more Suspicion it 
breeds that we are desirous of influencing them to betray 
the Interests of their Master or of ;his Nation. Indeed if 
the money is rais'd from among us against our Wills, the 
Injustice becomes more evident than where it arises from 
hence. I do not think, however, that the Effect of these 
Salaries is likely to be so considerable, either in favour of Government here, or in our Prejudice, as may be generally apprehended. The Love of Money is not a Thing of certain 
Measure, so as that it may be easily filled and satisfied. 
Avarice is infinite ; and where there is not good (Economy, 
no Salary, however large, will prevent Necessity. He that 
has a fixed and what others may think a competent Income, 
is often as much to be byassed by the Expectation of more, 
as if he had already none at all. If the Colonies should resolve on giving handsome Presents to good Governors at or 
after their Departure, or to their Children after their Decease, 
I imagine it might produce even better Effects than our present annual Grants. But the Course probably will soon be 
that the Chief Governor, to whom the Salary is given, will 
have leave to reside in England; a Lieutenant or Deputy 
will be left to do the Business and live on the Perquisites, 
which not being thought quite sufficient, his receiving Presents yearly will be wink'd at through the Interest of his Principal; and thus things will get into the old Train, only this 
Inconvenience remaining, that while by our Folly in consuming the Duty-Articles the fixed Salary is raised on ourselves 
without our Consent, we must pay double for the same Service. However, tho' it may be a hopeless Task while the 
Duties continue sufficient to pay the Salaries, I shall on all 
proper Occasions make Representations against this new 
Mode ; and if by the Duties falling short the Treasury should 
be calPd on to pay those Salaries, it is possible they may come 
to be seen in another Light than at present, and dropt as unnecessary. 
</p><p>
I was glad to see that Attention in the general Court to the 
Improvement of the Militia. A War may happen in which 
Britain, like Rome of old, may find so much to do for her own 
Defence as to be unable to spare Troops or Ships for the Protection of her Colonies. A Minister may arise so little our 
Friend as to neglect that Protection, or to permit Invasions 
of our Country, in order to make us cry out for Help, and 
thereby furnish stronger Pretence for maintaining a standing 
Army among us. If we once lose our military Spirit and 
supinely depend on an Army of Mercenaries for our Defence, 
we shall become contemptible ; despis'd both by Friends and 
Enemies, as neither our Friendship nor our Enmity will be 
deem'd of any Importance. As our Country is not wealthy 
so as to afford much ready Plunder, the Temptation to a 
foreign Invasion of us is the less, and I am persuaded that the 
Name of a numerous well-disciplined Militia, would alone be 
almost sufficient to prevent any Thoughts of attempting it. 
And what a Glory would it be for us to send, on any trying 
Occasion, ready and effectual Aid to our Mother Country ! 
</p><p>
I have lately been among the Clothing Towns in Yorkshire, and by conversing with the Manufacturers there, am 
more and more convinced of the natural Impossibility there 
is that, considering our Increase in America, England should 
be able much longer to supply us with Cloathing. Necessity, 
therefore, as well as Prudence, will soon induce us to seek 
Resources in our own Industry, which becoming General among the People, encouraged by resolutions of your Court, 
such as I have the Pleasure of seeing in your late Votes, will 
do Wonders. Family Manufactures will alone amount to a 
vast Saving in the Year; and a steady Determination and 
Custom of buying only of your own Artificers wherever they 
can supply you, will soon make them more expert in Working, 
so as to despatch more Business, while constant Employment 
enables them to afford their Work still cheaper. The lowness of Provisions with us, compared with their daily rising 
Price here, added to the Freight, Risque, and Commissions 
on the Manufactures of this Country, must give great Advantage to our Workmen, and enable them in time to retain 
a great deal of Money in the Country, tho' still Trade enough 
should remain between us and Britain to render our Friendship of the greatest Importance to this Nation. 
</p><p>
I was a Subscriber to a Set of Plates published here, entitled The Senator's Remembrancer, a Work encouraged by 
many Members of both Houses. Having a spare Copy, I 
beg your Acceptance of it as a small Mark of my Respect, 
and send it by Captain Jarvis. Should it afford to your 
already well-furnished Mind no useful Hints in the Management of publick Affairs, it may however be of Service to some 
young Friend at least as Copies of fair and elegant Writing. 
</p><p>
The Letters I have received from my friends in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> have 
lately come to hand, badly sealed, with no distinct Impression, 
appearing as if they had been opened, and in a very bungling 
way closed again. I suspect this may be done by some prying 
Persons that use the Coffee-house here. I therefore mention 
it that you may, if you think fit, send yours under Cover to 
some Merchant of Character who would forward them to me 
more safely. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere respect, I have the honour of being, 
sir, your most obedient and most humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

MY LORD, 
</p><p>
I got home in good time, and well. But on perusing the 
Letters that were come to me from America during my Absence, and considering the Business they require of me, I 
found it not convenient to return so soon as I had intended. 
I regret my having been obliged to leave that most agreable 
Retirement which good Mrs. Shipley put me so kindly in 
possession of. I now breathe with Reluctance the Smoke 
of London, when I think of the sweet Air of Twyford. And 
by the Time your Races are over, or about the Middle of next 
Month, (if it should then not be unsuitable to your Engagements or other Purposes) I promise myself the Happiness 
of spending another Week or two where I so pleasantly 
spent the last. 
</p><p>
I have taken the Liberty of sending by the Southampton 
Stage, which goes to-morrow, a Parcel directed to your Lordship, to be left at the Turnpike next beyond Winchester, containing one of my Books for Miss Georgiana, which I hope 
she will be good enough to accept as a small Mark of my 
Regard for her philosophic Genius: and a Specimen of the 
American dry'd Apples for Mrs. Shipley, that she may judge 
whether it will be worth while to try the Practice. I doubt 
some Dust may have got among them, as I found the Cask 
uncovered: therefore it will not perhaps be amiss to rinse 
them a minute or two in warm Water and dry them quick 
in a Napkin : but this is submitted to her better Judgment. 
With the greatest Esteem and Respect, and many Thanks 
for your abundant Civilities, I am, my Lord, &c.

SIR, 
</p><p>
In mine of May 1st, I enclosed a copy of the petition intended to be presented to the King in Council, in behalf of the 
possessors of the lands claimed by Sir William Baker's assigns. 
I am now to acquaint you, that it was presented accordingly, 
and is referred down to the Board of Trade for their opinion. 
But, as the Board is about to adjourn for some months, we 
are advised not to press the consideration of it till they meet 
again, as they have now too little time to attend to it properly. 
Immediately on their return to business, we shall urge for 
their report. 
</p><p>
I see by the newspapers that your new Assembly is also 
dissolved. 2 I am sorry for these differences, which must be 
uncomfortable to you and all that wish the welfare of the 
province. 
</p><p>
It is now thought that a peace between the Turks and Russians is likely soon to be concluded, which gives a better 
prospect of the continuance of peace among the other powers 
of Europe ; for it seldom happens that a war, begun between 
any two of them, does not extend itself sooner or later till it 
involves the whole. Spain showed a strong inclination to 
begin with us ; but, France being not willing or ready to join 
her, she has smothered that inclination for the present. 
With great esteem, I am, Sir, &c.

DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I acquainted you some time since, that I expected soon to 
obtain satisfactory answers to your queries relating to the 
specimens of silk you sent over; but I was disappointed till 
lately, when I had a meeting with Mr. Patterson, esteemed 
one of the best judges of that commodity, who favoured me 
with the enclosed paper, and, in conversation, with the following particulars. 
</p><p>
He thinks that the water, though clear at first, may grow 
foul with the impurities of the cocoons reeled in it, and therefore should be changed as that appears to be the case. He 
gave me a skein of what is called the best Italian silk imported 
here, and advised me to send it over as a pattern, for our 
people to endeavour to imitate, with regard to its evenness, 
cleanness from nibs, and lustre ; and, that they might better 
see the difference and understand his remarks, he wished the 
skeins sent over hither might be returned with it. I send 
them all together accordingly. 
</p><p>
He says the silk reeled from twelve cocoons fetches nearly 
as good a price as that from six, because it winds well, and 
there is less -fine waste; the dropping accidentally, or through 
inattention, three or four of the cocoons out of twelve not 
weakening the thread so much in proportion, as when the 
same number are dropped out of six ; nor is the thread so apt 
to break in winding. I observe that the Italian silk has a 
sweet smell, as if perfumed. He thinks it is the natural smell 
of the silk, when prepared in perfection. He understands 
that the Piedmontese reel is esteemed preferable to Mr. Pullein's. He says we may carry that produce to what 
length we please. It is impossible to overstock the market, as 
the demand is continually increasing, silk being more and 
more worn, and daily entering into the composition of more 
and a greater variety of manufactures. 
</p><p>
I communicated your thanks to Mr. Walpole, who was 
pleased to assure me he should always be ready to afford the 
design all the assistance in his power, and will endeavour to 
procure some eggs for you from Valencia against the next 
season. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged to you for the snuffbox. The wood is 
beautiful. The manufacturer should be encouraged. I 
hope our people will not be disheartened by a few accidents, 
and such disappointments as are incident to all new undertakings, but persevere bravely in the silk business, till they 
have conquered all difficulties. By diligence and patience 
the mouse ate in twain the cable. It is not two centuries since 
it was as much a novelty in France, as it is now with us 
in North America, and the people as much unacquainted 
with it. 
</p><p>
My respects to my good old friend, <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>. I hope he is recovered of the indisposition you mention. With sincere esteem, I am, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and 
</p><p>

Sally Franklin presents her duty to you and Mrs. Franklin. 
Yesterday a very odd accident happened, which I must mention to you, as it relates to your grandfather. A person, that 
deals in old books, of whom I sometimes buy, acquainted me, 
that he had a curious collection of pamphlets bound in eight 
volumes folio, and twenty-four volumes quarto and octavo, 
which he thought, from the subjects, I might like to have, 
and that he would sell them cheap. I desired to see them, 
and he brought them to me. On examining, I found that 
they contained all the principal pamphlets and papers on 
public affairs, that had been printed here from the Restoration down to <a href='/results.php?year=1715'>1715</a>. In one of the blank leaves at the beginning of each volume the collector had written the titles of the 
pieces contained in it, and the price they cost him. Also 
notes in the margin of many of the pieces ; and the collector, 
I find, from the handwriting and various other circumstances, was your grandfather, my uncle Benjamin. Wherefore, I 
the more readily agreed to buy them. I suppose he parted 
with them, when he left England and came to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, soon 
after your father, which was about the year <a href='/results.php?year=1716'>1716</a> or <a href='/results.php?year=1717'>1717</a>, 
now more than fifty years since. In whose hands they have 
been all this time I know not. The oddity is, that the bookseller, who could suspect nothing of any relation between me 
and the collector, should happen to make me the offer of them. 
My love to your good wife and children. Your affectionate 
cousin, B. FRANKLIN.

MY GOOD AND DEAR OLD FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letter of April 2Qth, wherein you complain of your friends here not writing to you. I had written a 
letter to you on the 2oth of the same month, which I hope is 
long since come to hand ; but I confess I ought to have written 
sooner, to acknowledge the receipt of the box of seeds, whereby 
I was much obliged. As to your pension, there is not, I believe, the least reason for you to apprehend its being stopped. 
I know not who receives it for you here, or I should quicken 
them in writing to you. But there is no instance in this King's 
reign of taking away a pension once granted, unless for some 
great offence. Young is in no esteem here as far as I can learn. 
</p><p>
I wish your daughter success with her silkworms. I am 
persuaded nothing is wanting in our country for the produce 
of silk, but skill; which will be obtained by persevering till 
we are instructed by experience. 
</p><p>
You take notice of the failing of your eyesight. Perhaps 
you have not spectacles that suit you, and it is not easy there 
to provide one's self. People too, when they go to a shop for 
glasses, seldom give themselves time to choose with care; 
and, if their eyes are not rightly suited, they are injured. 
Therefore I send you a complete set, from number one to 
thirteen, that you may try them at your ease; and, having 
pitched on such as suit you best at present, reserve those of 
higher numbers for future use, as your eyes grow still older; 
and with the lower numbers, which are for younger people, 
you may oblige some other friends. My love to good Mrs. 
Bartram and your children. I am, as ever, your faithful 
friend and servant, B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. On inquiry, I find your pension continues, and will 
be regularly paid, as it becomes due, to the person you empower to receive it for you.

DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you on the 4th instant, and sent you a paper of 
observations on your specimens of silk, drawn up by Mr. Patterson, who is noted here in that trade, with a specimen 
of Italian silk as a copy for our people to imitate. But they 
must not be discouraged if they should not come up to the 
lustre of it, that being the very finest, and from a particular 
district in Italy, none other being equal to it from any other 
district or any other country. 
</p><p>
The European silk I understand is all yellow, and most 
of the India silk. What comes from China is white. In 
Ogilby's account of that country, I find that, in the province 
of Chekiang, "they prune their mulberry trees once a year, 
as we do our vines in Europe, and suffer them not to grow up 
to high trees, because through long experience they have 
learned, that the leaves of the smallest and youngest trees 
make the best silk, and know thereby how to distinguish the 
first spinning of the threads from the second, viz. the first is 
that which comes from the young leaves, that are gathered in 
March, with which they feed their silkworms ; and the second 
is of the old summer leaves. And it is only the change of 
food, as to the young and old leaves, which makes the difference in the silk. The prices of the first and second spinning 
differ among the Chineses. The best silk is that of March, 
the coarsest of June, yet both in one year." I have copied 
this passage to show, that in Chekiang they keep the mulberry trees low; but I suppose the reason to be, the greater 
facility of gathering the leaves. It appears too by this passage, that they raise two crops a year in that province, which 
may account for the great plenty of silk there. But perhaps 
this would not answer with us, since it is not practised in 
Italy, though it might be tried. Chekiang is from twentyseven to thirty-one degrees of north latitude. Duhalde has 
a good deal on the Chinese management of the silk business. 
</p><p>
Dr. Pullein l is an acquaintance of mine. I will forward 
any letters you may send him. He lives in Ireland, but often 
comes to London. 
</p><p>
As you did not write to Dr. Fothergill, I communicated to 
him what you wrote in favour of Mr. Parke, who is to wait on him to-morrow. I shall be glad to render the young man any 
service here. 
</p><p>
We had a cold, backward spring here, and it is since the 
solstice that we have had what may be called a warm day. 
But the country now looks well with the prospect of great 
plenty. It is, however, the general opinion, that Britain will 
not for some years export much corn, great part of the arable 
land being now enclosed and turned to grass, to nourish the 
immense number of horses raised for exportation, there being 
a rage in France and other parts of Europe for English horses, 
that seems increasing every year. 
</p><p>
I hope our friend Galloway will not decline the public service in the Assembly with his private business. Both may be 
too much for his health ; but the first alone will be little more 
than an amusement. And I do not see that he can be spared 
from that station, without great detriment to our affairs and to 
the general welfare of America. I am, with sincere esteem, 
&c. B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. The enclosed notes were given me by Mr. Small, a 
leading member of the Society of Arts, with a desire that I 
would send them over to some member of your Philosophical 
Society ; supposing the herbs may be of some use.

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received yours of June 29, by Packet. I am glad to hear 
of all your Welfares, and that the Pictures &c. were safe 
arrived. You do not tell me who mounted the great one, nor 
where you have hung it up. Let me know whether Dr. Bond 
likes the new one better than the old one ; if so, the old one

I had written to many of my Friends by him. I spent three 
Weeks in Hampshire at my Friend the Bishop of St. Asaph's. 
The Bishop's Lady knows what Children and Grandchildren 
I have, their Ages, &c. So when I was to come away on 
Monday the 12th in the Morning, she insisted on my staying 
that one Day longer, that we might together keep my Grandson's Birthday. At Dinner, among other nice Things, we 
had a Floating Island, which they always particularly have on the BirthDays of any of their own Six Children; who 
were all but one at Table, where there was also a Clergyman's 
Widow now above 100 Years old. The chief Toast of the 
Day was Master Benjamin Bache, which the venerable old 
Lady began in a Bumper of Mountain. The Bishop's Lady 
politely added, and that he may be as good a Man as his Grandfather. I said I hop'd he would be much better. The Bishop, 
still more complaisant than his Lady, said, "We will compound the Matter, and be contented if he should not prove 
quite so good." This Chitchat is to yourself only, in return 
for some of yours about your Grandson, and must only be 
read to Sally, and not spoken of to anybody else; for you 
know how People add and alter silly Stories that they hear, 
and make them appear ten times more silly. 
</p><p>
Just while I am writing the Post brings me the enclosed 
from the good Bishop, with some Letters of Recommendation for Ireland, to see which Country I am to set out next 
week with my old Friend and Fellow Traveller, Counsellor 
Jackson. We expect to be absent a Month or Six Weeks. 
The Bishop's youngest Daughter, mention'd in his Letter, is 
about 11 years of age, and came up with me in the PostChaise 
to go to her School.

Capt. Osborne is not yet arrived here, but is every day 
expected. I hope he will come before I set out, that I may 
hear from you by him. I desire you will push the enquiry 
after the Lancaster Dutchman, and not let it sleep & be 
forgotten. I send you by Capt. Falconer a Box of Looking Glasses for the Closet Door in the little l

DEAR FRIEND 
</p><p>
Thro' Storms and Floods I arrived here on Saturday 
night, late, and was lodg'd miserably at an Inn: But that 
excellent Christian David Hume, agreable to the Precepts 
of the Gospel, has received the Stranger, and I now live with 
him at his House in the new Town most happily. I purpose 
staying about a Fortnight, and shall be glad to hear from you. 
I congratulate you on certain political Events that I know 
give you Pleasure. Let me know how it is with you and 
yours, how my Wife does and Sir John Pringle, and our other 
Friends. 
With sincerest Esteem I am, my dear Friend

DEAR SIR : I have been at Blair Drummond on a visit 
to my friend Lord Kames, thence I went to Glasgow, thence 
to Carron Works, viewing the Canal by the way. Extreme bad weather detained me in several places some days longer 
than I intended. But on Tuesday I purpose setting out on 
my return, and hope for the pleasure of seeing you by the 
Tuesday following. I thank you for your kind congratulations on the news you have heard. I like immortal friendships, 
but not immortal enmities; and therefore kill the latter 
whenever I have a good opportunity, thinking it no murder. 
I am but just come back hither, and write this line just to 
let you know I am well and again under the hospitable roof 
of the good Samaritan. As to news, which you seem to expect from me, I protest I know of none, and I am too dull 
for invention. My love to Mrs. Strahan and your children, 
and believe me, ever, my dear friend, Yours most affectionately, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I came to this Place on Saturday night, right well, and untir'd with a 70 miles' Journey that day. I met with your 
and my Dolly's joint Letter, which would have refreshed me 
with its kindness, if I had been ever so weary. 
</p><p>
The Account you give of a certain Lady's having entertain'd a new Gallant, in my Absence, did not surprize me; 
for I have been us'd to Rivals, and scarce ever had a Friend 
or a Mistress in my whole Life, that other People did not 
like as well as myself. And, therefore, I did not wonder, 
when I read in the Newspapers some Weeks since, that "the 
Duke of C." (that general Lover) "had made many Visits of late to an old Lady not many Miles from Craven Street." 
I only wonder'd, considering the Dislike she us'd to have 
for the Family, that she would receive his Visits. But as I 
saw, soon after, that Prince Charles had left Rome, and was 
gone a long Journey, nobody knew whither, I made no doubt 
but the Newswriters had mistaken the Person, and that it 
was he, who had taken the Opportunity of my Absence to 
solace himself with his old Friend. 
</p><p>
I thank you for your Intelligence about my Godson. I 
believe you are sincere, when you say you think him as fine 
a Child as you wish to see. He had cut two Teeth, and three, 
in another Letter, make five; for I know you never write 
Tautologies. If I have over-reckon'd, the Number will be 
right by this Time. His being like me in so many Particulars 
pleases me prodigiously ; and I am persuaded there is another, 
which you have omitted, tho' it must have occurred to you 
while you were putting them down. Pray let him have every 
thing he likes; I think it of great Consequence while the 
Features of the Countenance are forming; it gives them a 
pleasant Air, and, that being once become natural and fix'd 
by Habit, the Face is ever after the handsomer for it, and on 
that much of a Person's good Fortune and Success in Life 
may depend. Had I been cross'd as much in my Infant 
Likings and Inclinations as you know I have been of late 
Years, I should have been, I was going to say, not near so 
handsome ; but as the Vanity of that Expression would offend 
other Folk's Vanity, I change it, out of regard to them, and 
say, a great deal more homely. 
</p><p>
I rejoice that your good Mother's new Regimen succeeds 
so well with her. We are to set out, my Son and I, to-morrow 
for London, where I hope to be by the End of the Week, 
and to find her, and you, and all yours well and happy. 
My Love to them all. They tell me Dinner is coming in, 
and I have yet said nothing to Dolly ; but must nevertheless 
conclude, my dear Friend, yours ever most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. I am very happy here in the pleasant Family of 
Mr. Bache's Mother and Sister. Dear Dolly, I love you 
more than you can imagine, Yours most sincerely,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
My last Expedition convinced me that I grow too old for 
Rambling, and that 'twas probable I should never make such 
another Journey. 'Tis an uncomfortable Thing, the Parting with Friends one hardly expects ever again to see. This, 
with some occasional Hindrances, prevented my calling at 
Preston Field after my Return from Glasgow: But my 
Heart was with you and your dear Family, and my best 
Wishes attended you all. Sir John Pringle rejoic'd with me

MY DEAR SISTER, 
</p><p>
I received your kind letters of September 12th and <a rel="month origin" value="11">November</a> gth. I have now been some weeks returned from my 
journey through Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and the North 
of England, which, besides being an agreeable tour with a 
pleasant companion, has contributed to the establishment 
of my health; and this is the first ship I have heard of, 
by which I could write to you. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the receipts; they are as full and particular as one could wish; but they can easily be practised 
only in America, no bayberry wax, nor any Brasiletto, being 
here to be had, at least to my knowledge. I am glad, however, that those useful arts, which have so long been in our 
family, are now put down in writing. Some future branch 
may be the better for it. 
</p><p>
It gives me pleasure, that those little things sent by Jonathan proved agreeable to you. I write now to cousin Williams to press the payment of the bond. There has been forbearance enough on my part ; seven years or more, without 
receiving any principal or interest. It seems as if the debtor 
was like a whimsical man in Pennsylvania, of whom it was 
said that, it being against his principle to pay interest, and 
against his interest to pay the principal, he paid neither one 
nor the other. 
</p><p>
I doubt you have taken too old a pair of glasses, being tempted by their magnifying greatly. But people in choosing 
should only aim at remedying the defect. The glasses that 
enable them to see as well, at the same distance they used to 
hold their book or work, while their eyes were good, are those 
they should choose; not such as make them see better, for 
such contribute to hasten the time when still older glasses 
will become necessary. 
</p><p>
All, who have seen my grandson, agree with you in their 
accounts of his being an uncommonly fine boy, which brings 
often afresh to my mind the idea of my son Franky, though 
now dead thirty-six years, whom I have seldom since seen 
equalled in every thing, and whom to this day I cannot think 
of without a sigh. Mr. Bache is here; I found him at 
Preston, in Lancashire, with his mother and sisters, very 
agreeable people, and I brought him to London with me. 
I very much like his behaviour. He returns in the next 
ship to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>. The gentleman, who brought your 
last letter, Mr. Fox, stayed but a few minutes with me, and 
has not since called, as I desired him to do. 
</p><p>
I shall endeavour to get the arms you desire for cousin 
Coffin. Having many letters to write, I can now only add my 
love to cousin Jenny, and that I am, as ever, your affectionate 
</p><p>
brother ' B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. Sally Franklin presents her duty. Mrs. Stevenson 
desires to be affectionately remembered. No arms of the 
Folgers are to be found in the Herald's Office. I am persuaded it was originally a Flemish family, which came over 
with many others from that country in Queen Elizabeth's 
time, flying from the persecution then raging there.

GENTLEMEN, 
</p><p>
On my return from a late tour through Ireland and Scotland, for the establishment of my health, I found your respected letter of June 25th, with the papers therein referred 
to, relating to the townships settled eastward of Penobscot 
River. I immediately waited on Mr. Bollan to consult 
with him, agreeably to your instructions, who informed me, 
that, in my absence, he had by himself thoroughly considered 
the same, having formerly had occasion to be acquainted 
with the whole affair, and he suggested to his constituents, 
the Council, a plan of accommodation to be proposed to 
government here, if they should approve of it; and that he 
hoped by the meeting of Parliament (before which, little 
public business is done here, so many of the Lords of the 
Council being out of town,) he might have their answer; 
and it would otherwise be to little purpose to attempt any 
thing sooner. I make no doubt but the proposal has been 
communicated to the House of Representatives, if they have 
since had a meeting, and that we may soon receive their 
further instructions thereon. 
</p><p>
The town now begins to fill with members of Parliament, 
and great officers of state coming in daily to celebrate the 
Queen's birthday, and be present at the opening of the session, which is fixed for next Tuesday. It is given out, that 
nothing relating to America is likely to be agitated this session; that is, there is no purpose either to abrogate the old 
duties or lay new ones. For the first, I am sorry, believing 
as I do, that no harmony can be restored between the two 
countries, while these duties are continued. This, with the 
other aggrievances mentioned in your letters of June 29th, 
and July 13th, your agents will constantly attend to, and take 
every step possible in their present situation, unacknowledged 
as they are here, to obtain the redress, that is so justly your 
due, and which it would be so prudent in government here 
to grant. 
</p><p>
In yours of July Qth it is mentioned, that the House desire 
I would annually send an account of the expense I am at, 
in carrying on the affairs of the province. Having business 
to do for several colonies, almost every time I go to the public 
offices, and to the ministers, I have found it troublesome to 
keep an account of small expenses, such as coach and chair 
hire, stationery, &c., and difficult to divide them justly. 
Therefore I have some time since omitted keeping any account, or making any charge of them, but content myself 
with such salaries, grants, and allowances, as have been made 
me. Where considerable sums have been disbursed, as in 
fees to counsel, payment of solicitors' bills, and the like, 
those I charge. But as yet I have made no such disbursements on the account of your province. Please to present 
my duty to the House of Representatives, and believe me to 
be, with great esteem and respect, Gentlemen, &c.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have now before me your several favours of July 10. 
Aug. 23. and Nov. 5. A long Journey I took in the Summer 
and Autumn, for the Establishment of my Health, prevented 
my answering sooner the two first. I hope the State of your 
Health is also mended by your Retirement into the Country, 
as mine has sensibly been by that Journey. 
</p><p>
You have furnished me with a very good additional Argument against the Crown's paying its Governors, viz. "that 
this propos'd Independence is impolitic on the part of the 
Crown, and tends to prejudice its Interest, even considered 
separately from that of the People, as it will prove a strong 
temptation to Governors to hold a Conduct that will greatly 
lessen their Esteem and Influence in the Province, and consequently their Power to promote the Service of the King." 
Indeed the making it a Rule among ourselves that the Governor is to have his Salary from our Assemblies, tho j his 
publick Conduct should be wilfully and maliciously prejudicial to the Province, has the same Tendency; of which the 
Conduct of Governor Barnard, while he was constantly 
and regularly paid [by] us, is a considerable Proof. And 
therefore in my Opinion, if we would have our Power of 
granting the Support operate with any Weight in maintaining 
an Influence with the Governor, it should have been withheld 
from him, & we should withold it in Part or in the Whole 
according to Circumstances, as often as such a Conduct 
appears in any Governor. Otherwise the Power, if in such 
Cases it is not to be used, would seem of very little Importance. And since the Assembly have of late Years, and under 
such great Provocations, never attempted to abridge or withhold the Salary, no Reason appears why the Am? Minister, 
should now think it necessary or adviseable for the Crown 
to take the Payment of its Governor upon itself, unless it be 
with an Intention to Influence him, by witholding it when 
he declines executing arbitrary Instructions ; and then in 
such Cases the People should be sure to compensate him. 
As to procuring here any Change of this Measure, I frankly 
own that I despair of it, while the Administration of American 
Affairs continues in the hands of Lord H. and while by our 
Paying the Duties there is a sufficient American Fund out 
of which such Salaries can be satisfied. The Failure of that 
Fund, would be the most likely means of demolishing the Project. 
</p><p>
The Attempt to get the Commissioners exempted from the 
Payment of their Taxes, by an Instruction to the Governor, 
is the most indiscrete Thing, surely, to say nothing of its 
Injustice, that any prudent Government was ever guilty 
of. I cannot think it will be persisted in. I hope it will 
never be comply'd with. If the Supply Bill is duly offered 
without the Clause, I am persuaded it will not long be refused. The Publick must however suffer in the mean time 
by the want of the Supply ; but that will be a good Foundation 
for an Impeachment here. Your Reasonings against the 
Instruction are unanswerable, [and shall appear here just 
before the meeting of Parliament.] 
</p><p>
I am glad that Commodore Gambier behav'd in so satisfactory a Manner. His Uncle Mr. Mead, first Commissioner 
of the Customs, is a particular and intimate Friend of mine, 
a Man of great Moderation and Prudence; I knew that 
he gave his Nephew, before he went hence, a great deal 
of good Advice with regard to his Conduct among the 
People of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, for whom he has a great Esteem and 
Regard, having formerly commanded a Frigate stationed 
there; and he is happy to find by your Letter (which I 
communicated to him) that his Advice was so well followed. 
He gave also equally good Advice to your indiscrete Commissioners when they were sent out, but they had not Sense 
enough to follow it, and therefore have been the Authors of 
infinite Mischief. I wonder at the Invention of so improbable 
a Lye, as that I should desire a Place among them, who am 
daily urging the Expediency of their Dissolution. The other 
Calumny you mention, contain'd in an anonymous Letter to 
the Speaker is so weak, that I believe you do not think that 
I ought to take any notice of it.
</p><p>
As to the Agency, whether I am re-chosen or not, and 
whether the Gen. Assembly is ever permitted to pay me or 
not, I shall nevertheless continue to exert myself in behalf 
of my Country, as long, as I see a [Probability] of my being 
able to do it any Service. I have nothing to ask or expect of 
Ministers. I have, thanks to God, a Competency, [for the 
little Time I may expect to live,] and am grown too old for 
Ambition of every other kind but that of leaving a good Name 
behind me. 
</p><p>
Your Story of the Clergyman and Proclamation is a Pleasant one. I can only match it with one I had from my Father, 
I know not if it was ever printed. Charles the First ordered 
his Proclamation authorizing Sports on a Sunday to be read 
in all Churches. Many Clergymen comply'd, some refus'd, 
and others hurry'd it thro' as indistinctly as possible. But 
one, whose Congregation expected no such thing from him, 
did nevertheless to their great Surprize, read it distinctly. 
</p><p>
He follow'd it however with the Fourth Commandment, Remember to keep holy the Sabbath Day, and then said, 
"Bretheren, I have laid before you the Command of your King, and the Commandment of your God. I leave it to 
yourselves to judge which of the two ought rather to be observed." With great and sincere esteem, I remain, dear Sir, 
Your most obedient and most humble servant

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I should very readily have recommended your Son to the 
Care of my Friend Dr. Priestly if he had continued to superintend the Academy at Warrington: But he has left that 
Charge some time since, and is now Pastor of a Congregation at Leeds in Yorkshire. I am much obliged to you for 
introducing me to the Acquaintance of Mr. Erving, who 
appears a very intelligent, sensible Man. 
</p><p>
The Governing of Colonies by Instructions has long been 
a favourite Point with Ministers here. About 30 Years since, 
in a Bill brought into Parliament relating to America, they 
inserted a Clause to make the King's Instructions Laws in 
the Colonies, which being opposed by the then Agents, was 
thrown out. And I well remember a Conversation with Lord 
Granville soon after my Arrival here, in which he expressed 
himself on that Subject in the following Terms; "Your 
American Assemblies slight the King's Instructions, pretending that they are not Laws. The Instructions, sent over to 
your Governors, are not like the Pocket Instructions given 
to Embassadors, to be observ'd at their Discretion as Circumstances may require. They are drawn up by grave Men 
learned in the Laws and Constitutions of the Realm; they 
are brought into Council, thoroughly weigh'd, well considered, 
and amended if necessary by the Wisdom of that Body; 
and when receiv'd by the Governors, are the Law of the Land ; 
for the King is the Legislator o) the Colonies" 
</p><p>
I remember this the better, because being new Doctrine 
to me, I put it down as soon as I return'd to my Lodging. 
To be sure if a Governor thinks himself oblig'd to obey all 
Instructions, whether consistent or inconsistent with the Constitution, Laws and Rights of the Country he governs, and can 
proceed to govern in that Train, there is an End of the Constitution, and those Rights are abolish'd. But I wonder, 
that any honest Gentleman can think there is Honour in being 
a Governor on such Terms. And I think the Practice cannot 
possibly continue, especially if opposed with Spirit by our 
Assemblies. At present no Attention is paid by the American 
Minister to any Agent here whose Appointment is not ratified by the Governor's Assent; and if this is persisted in, 
you can have none to serve you in publick Character that do 
not render themselves agreable to these Ministers; those 
otherwise appointed can only promote your Interests by 
Conversation as private Gentlemen or by Writing. 
</p><p>
Virginia had, as you observe, two Agents, one for the Council, the other for the Assembly ; but I think the latter only was 
considered as Agent for the Province. He was appoint'd 
by an Act, which expired in the time of Lord Botetourt, and 
was not revived. The other I apprehend continues, but I 
am not well acquainted with the Nature of his Appointment. 
I only understand that he does not concern himself much 
with the general Affairs of the Colony. 
</p><p>
It gives me great Pleasure that my Book afforded any to 
my Friends. I esteem those Letters of yours among its 
brightest Ornaments; and have the Satisfaction to find, 
that they add greatly to the Reputation of American Philosophy.

There is in the Governor's Collection of Papers relative 
to the History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, published 
<a href='/results.php?year=1769'>1769</a>, a Copy of an Answer made by Randolph to several

I have lately made a Tour thro' Ireland and Scotland. 
In those Countries a small Part of the Society are Landlords, 
great Noblemen, and Gentlemen, extreamly opulent, living 
in the highest Affluence and Magnificence : The Bulk of the 
People Tenants, extreamly poor, living in the most sordid 
Wretchedness, in dirty Hovels of Mud and Straw, and cloathed

I thought often of the Happiness of New England, where 
every Man is a Freeholder, has a Vote in publick Affairs, 
lives in a tidy, warm House, has plenty of good Food and

in this Situation ! But if they should ever envy the Trade 
of these Countries, I can put them in a Way to obtain a Share 
of it. Let them with three fourths of the People of Ireland 
live the Year round on Potatoes and Buttermilk, without 
Shirts, then may their Merchants export Beef, Butter, and 
Linnen. Let them, with the Generality of the Common 
People of Scotland, go Barefoot, then may they make large 
Exports in Shoes and Stockings : And if they will be content 
to wear Rags, like the Spinners and Weavers of England, 
they may make Cloths and Stuffs for all Parts of the World. 
</p><p>
Farther, if my Countrymen should ever wish for the honour 
of having among them a gentry enormously wealthy, let them 
sell their Farms & pay rack'd Rents ; the Scale of the Landlords will rise as that of the Tenants is depressed, who will 
soon become poor, tattered, dirty, and abject in Spirit. Had 
I never been in the American Colonies, but was to form my 
Judgment of Civil Society by what I have lately seen, I should 
never advise a Nation of Savages to admit of Civilization: 
For I assure you, that, in the Possession & Enjoyment of the 
</p><p>
various Comforts of Life, compar'd to these People every 
Indian is a Gentleman : And the Effect of this kind of Civil 
Society seems only to be, the depressing Multitudes below 
the Savage State that a few may be rais'd above it. My 
best Wishes attend you and yours, being ever, with great 
Esteem, Dear Sir, etc. B. [FRANKLIN.]

SIR, 
</p><p>
I am now return'd again to London from a Journey of 
some Months in Ireland and Scotland. Tho' my Constitution, and too great Confinement to Business during the 
Winter, seem to require the Air and Exercise of a long Journey 
once a Year, which I have now practised for more than 20 
Years past, yet I should not have been out so long this Time, 
but that I was well assured the Parliament would not meet 
till towards the End of January, before which Meeting few 
of the principal People would be in Town, and no Business 
of importance likely to be agitated relating to America. 
</p><p>
I have now before me your esteemed Favours of June 24. 
July 9, Sept. 25 and Oct. 2. In the first you mention, that 
the General Assembly was still held out of its antient and only 
convenient Seat, the Townhouse in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, and by the latest 
Papers from thence I see, that it was prorogued again to meet 
in <a href='/results.php?city=cambridge' rel='city'>Cambridge</a>, w c ' I a little wonder at, when I recollect a Question ask'd me by my Lord H. in Ireland, viz. Whether 
I had heard from New England lately, since the Gen. Court 
was return'd to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>? From this I concluded, Orders 
had been transmitted by his Lordship for that removal. 
Perhaps such may have been sent, to be used discretionally. 
I think I have before mentioned to you one of the Articles 
of Impeachment brought against a bad Minister of a former 
King; "That to work his Ends he had caused the Parliament to sit in Villibus et remotis partibus Regni, where few 
People, propter dejectum hospitii et victualium, could attend, 
thereby to force illos paucos, qui remanebunt de communitate regni, concedere regi quamvis pessima," Lord Clarendon, 
too, was impeach'd for endeavouring to introduce arbitrary 
Government into the Colonies. 
</p><p>
Lord H. seems, by the late Instructions, to have been 
treading in the Paths, that lead to the same unhappy Situation, if the Parliament here should ever again feel for the 
Colonies. Being in Dublin, at the same Time with his Lordship, I met with him accidentally at the Lord Lieutenant's, 
who had happened to invite us to dine with a large Company 
on the same Day. As there is something curious in our 
Interview in Ireland I must give you an Account of it. He 
was surprizingly civil, and urg'd my fellow Traveller and me 
to call at his House in our intended Journey Northwards 
where we might be sure of better Accommodations than the 
Inns would afford us. He pressed us so politely, that it was 
not easy to refuse, without apparent Rudeness, as we must 
pass through his town, Hillsborough, and by his Door ; and 
therefore, as it might afford an Opportunity of saying something on American Affairs, I concluded to comply with his Invitation. 
</p><p>
His Lord p went home some time before we left Dublin. 
We call'd upon him, and were detain'd at his House four 
Days, during which time he entertain'd us with great Civility, 
and a particular Attention to me that appear'd the more 
extraordinary, as I knew that just before I left London he had 
express'd himself concerning me in very angry Terms, calling 
me a Republican, a factious, mischievous Fellow, and the like. 
</p><p>
In our Conversations he first show'd himself a good Irishman, blaming England for its Narrowness towards that Country in restraining its Commerce, discouraging its Woollen 
Manufacture, etc. And when I apply 'd his Observations 
to America, he said he had always been of Opinion, that the 
Subjects in every Part of the King's Dominions had a natural 
Right to make the best Use they could of the Productions of 
their Country, and that America ought not to be restrain'd 
in manufacturing any thing she could manufacture to Advantage ; that he suppos'd, that, at present, she found generally 
more Profit in Agriculture ; but, whenever she found that less 
profitable, or a particular Manufacture more so, he had no 
Objection to her persuing it ; and he censur'd Lord Chatham 
for affecting in his Speech, that the Parliament had a Right 
or ought to restrain Manufactures in the Colonies; adding, 
that, as he knew the English were apt to be jealous on that 
head, he avoided every thing that might enflame that Jealousy ; 
and, therefore, tho' the Commons had requested the Crown 
to order the Governors to send over annually Accounts of such 
Manufactures, as were undertaken in the Colonies, yet, as 
they had not ordered such Accounts to be annually laid before them, he should never produce them till they were calPd 
for. 
</p><p>
Then he gave me to understand, that the Bounty on Silk 
raised in America was a Child of his, and he hoped would 
prove of great Advantage to that Country ; and that he wish'd 
to know in what manner a Bounty on raising Wine there 
might be contrived, so as to operate effectually for that Purpose, desiring me to turn it in my Thoughts, as he should be 
glad of my Opinion and Advice. Then he inform' d me, that 
Newfoundland was grown too populous to be left any longer 
without a regular Government, but there were great Difficulties in the forming such a kind of Government as would be 
suitable to the particular Circumstances of that Country, 
which he wish'd me likewise to consider, and that I would 
favour him with my Sentiments. 
</p><p>
He seem'd attentive to every thing, that might make my 
Stay in his House agreeable to me, and put his eldest Son 
Lord Kilwarling into his Phaeton with me, to drive me a 
Round of Forty Miles, that I might see the Country, the Seats, 
Manufactures, etc. covering me with his own GreatCoat, lest 
I should take Cold. And in short, seem'd in every-Thing 
extreamly solicitous to impress me, and the Colonies thro' 
me, with a good Opinion of him : All which I could not but 
wonder at, knowing that he likes neither them nor me ; and 
I thought it inexplicable but on the Supposition, that he apprehended an approaching Storm, and was desirous of lessening beforehand the Number of Enemies he had so imprudently created. But, if he takes no Step towards withdrawing 
the Troops, repealing the Duties, restoring the Castle, or 
recalling the offensive Instructions, I shall think all the 
plausible Behaviour I have describ'd is meant only, by patting 
and streaking the Horse, to make him more patient, while 
the Reins are drawn tighter, and the Spurs set deeper into his 
Sides. 
</p><p>
Before leaving Ireland I must mention, that, being desirous 
of seeing the principal Patriots there, I staid till the Opening 
of their Parliament. I found them dispos'd to be friends of 
America, in which I endeavoured to confirm them, with the 
Expectation that our growing Weight might in time be thrown 
into their Scale, and, by joining our Interest with theirs 
might be obtained for them as well as for us, a more equitable 
Treatment from this Nation. There are many brave Spirits 
among them. The Gentry are a very sensible, polite, 
friendly and handsome People. Their Parliament makes a 
most respectable Figure, with a number of very good Speakers 
in both Parties, and able Men of Business. And I must not 
omit acquainting you, that, it being a standing Rule to admit 
Members of the English Parliament to sit (tho' they do not 
vote) in the House among the Members, while others are 
only admitted into the Gallery, my Fellow Traveller, being 
an English Member, was accordingly admitted as such. But 
I supposed I must go to the Gallery, when the Speaker stood 
up, and acquainted the House, that he understood there was 
in Town an American Gentleman of (as he was pleas' d to say) 
distinguish'd Character and Merit, a Member or Delegate of 
some of the Parliaments of that Country, who was desirous 
of being present at the Debates of this House ; that there was 
a Rule of the House for admitting Members of English Parliaments, and that he did suppose the House would consider 
the American Assemblies as English Parliaments; but, as 
this was the first Instance, he had chosen not to give any 
Order in it without receiving their Directions. On the Question, the whole House gave a loud, unanimous Aye; when 
two Members came to me without the Bar where I was 
standing, led me in, and placed me very honourably. This 
I am the more particular in to you, as I esteemed it a mark 
of respect for our Country, and a piece of politeness in which 
I hope our Parliament will not fall behind theirs, whenever 
an occasion shall offer. Ireland is itself a poor Country, 
and Dublin a magnificent City ; but the appearances of general extreme poverty among the lower people are amazing. 
They live in wretched hovels of mud and straw, are clothed 
in rags, and subsist chiefly on potatoes. Our New England 
farmers, of the poorest sort, in regard to the Enjoyment of 
all the comforts of life, are princes when compared to them. 
Such is the effect of the discouragements of industry, the nonresidence not only of pensioners, but of many original landlords, who lease their lands in gross to undertakers that rack 
the tenants and fleece them skin and all to make estates to 
themselves, while the first rents, as well as most of the pensions, are spent out of the country. An English gentleman 
there said to me, that by what he had heard of the good 
grazing in North America, and by what he saw of the plenty 
of flaxseed imported in Ireland from thence, he could not 
understand why we did not rival Ireland in the beef and 
butter trade to the West Indies, and share with it in its linen 
trade. But he was satisfied when I told him that I supposed 
the reason might be, our people eat bee) and butter every day, 
and wear shirts themselves. 
</p><p>
In short, the chief exports of Ireland seem to be pinched 
off the backs and out of the bellies of the miserable inhabitants. But schemes are now under consideration among the 
humane gentry to provide some means of mending if possible 
their present wretched condition. 
</p><p>
I am much obliged by the very particular account you have 
favoured me with of the general sentiments of people in our province on the present state of Affairs between the two countries. They are for the most part the same with my own. 
</p><p>
I think the Revenue Act should be repealed, as not constitutionally founded; that the commission of the customs 
should be dissolved; that the troops (foreigners to us as 
much as Hanoverians would be in England, since they are 
not introduced with the consent of our Legislature) ought to 
be withdrawn, and the Castle restored to its rightful owners, 
the government of the province that built it; and that the 
General Court should be returned to its ancient seat, and the 
Governor's salary put upon its ancient footing. But it is 
also my opinion that, while the present American Minister 
continues, there is very little likelihood that any change will 
be made in any of those particulars, that of returning the 
Court perhaps excepted. And yet I am also of opinion that 
no farther duties are intended, and that although the American Minister might wish to increase that fund for corruption, 
the other Ministers are not disposed to humour him in it, 
and would not consent to it. I may be deceived in this 
opinion, but I have grounds for it. However, I think we 
should be as much on our guard, and use the same defensive 
measures and endeavours as if we saw new duties intended 
in the ensuing session. And nothing can more effectually 
discourage new duties than the diminution of the revenue 
produced by duties; a resolute steady refusal to consume 
the dutiable commodities. 
</p><p>
In compliance with your respected recommendation I 
introduced Mr. Story to a Secretary of the Treasury, who 
forwarded his memorial ; and he tells me he has obtained his 
request relating to the affair of Mr. Wheelwright's debt. He now seems to wish for some appointment in consideration of 
his sufferings from the mob. But I doubt whether it may 
be worth his while to attend here the solicitation and expectation of such a reward, those attendances being often 
drawn out to an inconceivable length, and the expense, of 
course, enormous. 
</p><p>
With the greatest esteem, I have the honour to be, Sir, 
your most obedient and most humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR COUSIN, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter of Nov 8. and rejoice to hear 
of the continued Welfare of you & your good Wife & four 
Daughters: I hope they will all get good Husbands. I 
dare say they will be educated so as to deserve them. 
</p><p>
I knew a wise old Man, who us'd to advise his young 
Friends to chuse Wives out of a Bunch ; for where there were 
many Daughters, he said they improv'd each other, and from 
Emulation acquired more Accomplishments, knew more, 
could do more, & were not spoil' d by parental Fondness like 
single Children. Yours have my best Wishes, and Blessing, 
if that can be of any Value. 
</p><p>
I receiv'd a very polite Letter from Mr. Bowen relating to 
the Print. Please to present him my respectful Compliments. 
I am just returned from as long a Journey as a Man can well 
make in these Islands, thro' Wales, Ireland, Scotland, and 
the Northern Parts of England ; and I find my Health much 
improv'd by it. I shall soon take some good Opportunity of letting you see one of the Books that were collected by 
your good Grandfather. Sally Franklin presents her Duty 
to you & Mrs. Franklin, and Love to her Kinswomen. I 
am, Dear Kinsman, 
</p><p>
Yours very affectionately 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
There is lately published in Paris a Work intitled ZendAvesta, Outrage de Zoroastre, contenant les I dees Theologiques, Physiques, et Morales, de ce Legislateur; les Ceremonies 
du Culte Religieux qu'il a etabli, et plusieurs Traits importans 
relatijs a PAneienne Histoire des Perses. Traduit en Fran$ois sur V Original Zend, avec des Remarques; et accompagne de plusieurs Traites propres a eclaircir les Matieres 
qui en sont V Ob jet. Par M. Anquetil du Perron, de PAcademie 
Royale des Inscriptions et Belles- Lettres, et Interprets du 
Roy pour les Langues Orientates. It is in two Volumes 4to. 
Near half the Work is an Account of the author's Travels in 
India, and his Residence among the Parses during several 
Years to learn their Languages. 
</p><p>
I have cast my Eye over the Religious Part; it seems to 
contain a nice Morality, mix'd with abundance of Prayers, 
Ceremonies, & Observances. If you desire to have it, I will 
procure it for you. There is no doubt of its being a genuine 
Translation of the Books at present deem'd sacred as the Writings of Zoroaster by his Followers ; but perhaps some of 
them are of later Date tho' ascrib'd to him; for to me there 
seems too great a Quantity & Variety of Ceremonies & 
Prayers, to be directed at once by one Man. In the Romish 
Church they have increased gradually in a Course of Ages to 
their present Bulk. Those who added new ones from time 
to time found it necessary to give them Authority by Pretences of their Antiquity. The Books of Moses indeed, if 
all written by him, which some doubt, are an Exception to 
this Observation. With great Esteem, I am ever, Dear 
</p><p>
Sir, &c.

Friend and hum Serv

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I have written several short Letters to you lately just to let 
you know of my Welfare, and promising to write more fully 
by Capt. Falconer, which I now sit down to do, with a Number of your Favours before me. I received the Box & Letter 
from Mr. Peter Miller, but if as you mention, Enoch Davenport brought it, I did not see him. Perhaps he might call 
while I was absent in Ireland. I write by this Opportunity 
to Mr. Miller. What he sent me is a most valuable Curiosity. I take notice of the considerable Sums you have 
paid. I would not have you send me any Receipts. I am 
satisfy'd with the Accounts you give. 
</p><p>
I am much pleas'd with your little Histories of our Grand
son, & happy in thinking how much Amusement he must 
afford you. I pray that God may continue him to us, & to 
his Parents. Mr. Bache is about returning. His Behaviour 
here has been very agreable to me. I have ad vis' d him to 
settle down to Business in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where I hope he will 
meet with Success. I mentioned to you before, that I saw 
his Mother and Sisters at Preston, who are genteel People, 
and extreamly agreable. 
</p><p>
I receiv'd your young Neighbour Haddock's Silk, and 
carried it myself to her Relations, who live very well, keeping 
a Linnen-Draper's Shop in Bishop's-Gate Street. They have 
a Relation in Spitalfields that is a Manufacturer who I 
believe will do it well. I shall honour much every young 
Lady that I find on my Return Dress'd in Silk of their own 
raising. I thank you for the Sauceboats, and am pleas'd to 
find so good a Progress made in the China Manufactury. I 
wish it Success most heartily. 
</p><p>
Mrs. Stevenson too loves to hear about your little Boy. 
Her own Grandson (my Godson) is a fine Child, now nine 
Months old. He has an attentive, observing, sagacious 
Look, as if he had a great deal of Sense, but as yet he is not 
enough acquainted with our Language to express it intelligibly. His Mother nurses him herself, for which I much 
esteem her, as it is rather unfashionable here ; whence Numbers of little Innocents suffer and perish. His Name is 
William. Mr. and Mrs. Strahan & their Family are well. 
We din'd there not long since. Yesterday Mrs. Stevenson, 
her Daughter, Mr. Bache, and myself, din'd at Mr. West's. 
They are well and their fine Boy. 
</p><p>
I am pleas'd that the Letters between me and the good 
Lady entertain'd you. But you ought not to have shown 
them to any body but Sally. Since my Return I receiv'd 
the enclosed ; but having too much to do, I could not accept 
the kind Invitation. 
</p><p>
The Squirrels came safe and well. You will see by the 
enclosed how welcome they were. A 1000 Thanks are sent 
you for them, and I thank you for the Readiness with which 
you executed the Commission. 
</p><p>
My Love to our dear precious Policy Hunt & all our kind 
enquiring Friends. Mrs. Montgomery's Health is I hope 
established, as also that of our Dear Friend Rhoads and his 
Family. The Buckwheat and Indian Meal are come safe & 
good. They will be a great Refreshment to me this Winter. 
For since I cannot be in America, every thing that comes 
from thence comforts me a little, as being something like 
Home. The dry'd Peaches too are excellent, those dry'd 
without the Skin: The Parcel in their Skins are not so 
good. The Apples are the best I ever had and came with the 
least Damage. The Sturgeon you mention did not come: 
but that is not so material. 
</p><p>
I hope our cousin Tyler will do well among us. He seems 
a sober well inclin'd Man ; and when I saw him at Birmingham, he appeared to be well respected by his Relations and 
Friends. An active, lively industrious Wife would be a good 
Thing for him. I grieve for our Friend Bond's heavy Loss ; 
and am sorry for poor Dr. Kearsley's misfortune. I sent 
you from Ireland a fine Piece of the Holland of that Country. 
Capt. All, whom I met with there, found a Captain that he 
knew who promis'd to take care of it and deliver it safe. 
You mention nothing of it in your Letter of Decem r 2. when 
in the common Course you ought to have had it before that 
time, which makes me fear it is lost. I wrote to you from 
</p><p>
Dublin; and from Glasgow in Scotland. I was in Ireland 
about 7 Weeks, in Scotland about 4 Weeks, absent from 
London in all more than three Months. My Tour was a 
very pleasant one. I received abundance of Civilities from 
the Gentry of both those Kingdoms, and my Health is improv'd by the Air & Exercise. 
</p><p>
I have advis'd Mr. Bache to deal only in the Ready Money 
Way, tho' he should sell less. It is the safest and the most 
easy Manner of carrying on Business. He may keep his 
Store in your little North Room, for the present. And as he 
will be at no Expence while the Family continues with you, 
I think he may, with Industry and Frugality, get so forward, 
as at the end of his Term, to pay his Debts and be clear of 
the World, which I much wish to see. I have given him ^200 
SterPg to add something to his Cargo. My Love to our dear 
Sally, and to Ben. concludes at present, from Your ever affectionate Husband

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I received your very kind Letter of the i5' h together with 
the Turkey, which prov'd exceeding fine. We regal'd a 
Number of our Friends with it, & drank your & M r Tissington's Health, which we wished sincerely. Mr Stevenson keeps about, but is ever ailing, like your Dame, 
with Rheumatic Pains that fly from Limb to Limb continually. Tis a most wicked Distemper, & often puts me in mind of the Saying of a Scotch Divine to some of his 
Brethren who were complaining that their Flocks had of late been infected with Arianism and Socinianism. Mine, 
says he, is infected with a worse ism than either of those. Pray, Brother, what can that be ? It is, the Rheumatism. 
I was a good deal mortified at not having it in my Power to call at Alfreton in my late Tours: But I hope for the 
Pleasure of seeing you both in London this Winter. M M Stevenson & Sally Franklin join in Wishes of every kind 
of Prosperity to you & yours, with, Dear Sir,

DEAR SALLY, 
</p><p>
I received your agreable Letters of Oct. n. and Nov. 5. 
I met with Mr. Bache at Preston, where I staid two or three 
Days, being very kindly entertained by his Mother and Sisters, 
whom I lik'd much. He came to town with me, and is now 
going home to you. I have advis'd him to settle down to 
Business in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, where he will always be with you. 
I am of Opinion, that almost any Profession a Man has been 
educated in, is preferable to an Office held at Pleasure, as 
rendering him more independent, more a Freeman, and less 
subject to the Caprices of Superiors. And I think, that in 
keeping a Store, if it be where you dwell, you can be serviceable to him as your Mother was to me : For you are not 
deficient in Capacity, and I hope are not too proud. 
</p><p>
You might easily learn Accounts, and you can copy Letters, 
or write them very well upon Occasion. By Industry & 
Frugality you may get forward in the World, being both of 
you yet young. And then what we may leave you at our 
Death may be a pretty Addition, tho' of itself far from sufficient to maintain & bring up a Family. It is of the more 
Importance for you to think seriously of this, as you may 
have a Number of Children to educate. 'Till my Return you 
need be at no Expence for Rent, etc, as you are all welcome 
to continue with your Mother, and indeed it seems to be your 
Duty to attend her, as she grows infirm, and takes much 
Delight in your Company and the Child's. This Saving 
will be a Help in your Progress : And for your Encouragement I can assure you that there is scarce a Merchant of 
Opulence in your Town, whom I do not remember a young 
Beginner with as little to go on with, & no better Prospects 
than Mr. Bache. That his Voyage hither might not be quite 
fruitless, I have given him 2Oo Sterling; with which I wish 
you good Luck. 
</p><p>
I hope you will attend to what is recommended to you in 
this Letter, it proceeding from sincere Affection, after due 
Consideration, with the Knowledge I have of the World and 
my own Circumstances. I am much pleas' d with the Ace' 
I receive from all Hands of your dear little Boy. I hope he 
will be continu'd a Blessing to us all. Tho' I long to see my 
Family, I am glad you did not come over, as the Expence 
would have been very great, and I think I shall not continue 
here much longer. It is a Pleasure to me that the little 
Things I sent you prov'd agreable. I am ever, my dear 
Sally, your affectionate Father,

MY DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I have now before me yours of July 3. Aug. 3. Sept. 3. and 
Nov. 5. All but the last came in my Absence, which is the 
Reason they were not immediately answer'd. In yours of 
July 3 you mention some Complaisance of Lord H.V towards 
you, that show'd a Disposition of being upon better Terms. 
His Behaviour to me in Ireland corresponds exactly. We 
met first at the Lord Lieutenant's. Mr. Jackson and I were 
invited to dine there, and when we came, were shown into a 
Room, where Lord H. was alone. He was extreamly civil, 
wonderfully so to me whom he had not long before abus'd to 
Mr. Strahan, as a factious turbulent Fellow, always in Mischief, a Republican, Enemy to the King's Service, and what not. 
He entered very frankly into Conversation with us both, and 
invited us both to stop at his House in Hillsboro', as we should 
travel Northward, and urged it in so polite a Manner, that 
we could not avoid saying we would wait on him if we went 
that way. In my own Mind I was determin'd not to go that 
way, but Mr. Jackson thought himself obliged to call on his 
Lordship, considering the connection his Office forms between 
them. His Lordship dined with us at the Lord Lieut's. 
There were at Table, the Lord Chancellor, the Speaker, & 
all the great Officers of State. He drank my Health & was 
otherwise particularly civil. He went from Dublin some 
Days before us, And when we were on the Road, it was 
my Purpose to have turn'd off for Armagh on a Visit to Dean 
Hamilton, let Mr. Jackson go to Hillsborough alone, and meet 
him at Belfast: But it so happen'd that where we were to 
have parted, no Post Chaise was to be had for me, nor any 
other to proceed with but that we came in, so I was oblig'd 
to go forward with Mr. Jackson to Hillsborough, and as soon 
as his Lordship knew we were arriv'd at the Inn he sent a 
Message over for us to come to the House. There we were 
detained by a <a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a> Civilities from Tuesday to Sunday. 
</p><p>
I believe I wrote you a good deal of this before from Scotland, but as I have no Copy of that Letter, I cannot easily 
avoid the Repetition. 
</p><p>
At Dublin we saw and were entertained by both Parties, 
the Courtiers & the Patriots. The latter treated me with 
particular Respect. We were admitted to sit among the 
Members in the Commons' house, Mr. Jackson as member 
of the British Parliament, & I as Member of some English 
Parliament in America. The Speaker proposed it in my 
Behalf, with some very obliging Expressions of Respect for 
my Character, and was answered by the House with a 
unanimous Aye of Consent, when two Members came out 
to me, led me in between them, and plac'd me honourably 
& commodiously. I hope our Assemblies will not fall short 
of them in this Politeness, if any Irish Member should happen to be in our Country. 
</p><p>
In Scotland I spent 5 Days with Lord Kaims at his Seat, 
Blair Drummond near Stirling, two or three Days at Glasgow, two Days at Carron Iron Works, and the rest of the 
Month in and about Edinburgh, lodging at David Hume's, 
who entertained me with the greatest Kindness and Hospitality, as did Lord Kaims & his Lady. All our old Acquaintance there, Sir Alex r Dick and Lady, Mr. MGowan, Drs. 
Robertson, Cullen, Black, Ferguson, Russel, and others, 
enquired affectionately of your Welfare. I was out three 
Months, and the Journey was evidently of great service to 
my Health. 
</p><p>
Mr. Bache had some Views of obtaining an Office in 
America, but I dissuaded him from the Application, as I 
could not appear in it, and rather wish to see all I am connected with in an Independent Situation, supported by their 
own Industry. I therefore advis'd him to lay out the Money 
he brought with him (<a href='/results.php?year=1000'>1000</a>^ Sterling) in Goods, return and 
sit down to Business in <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, selling for ready Money 
only, in which way I think he might, by quick Returns, get 
forward in the World. It would have been wrong for Sally 
to leave her Mother, besides incurring the Expence of such a 
Voyage. 
</p><p>
I cast my eye over Goddard's Piece against our friend Mr. Galloway, and then lit my Fire with it. I think such feeble, 
malicious Attacks cannot hurt him. 
</p><p>
The Resolution of the Board of Trade to admit for the 
future no Agents to appear before them but such as are appointed by "concurrent Act of the whole Legislature," will 
I think put an End to Agencies, as I apprehend the Assemblies will think Agents under the ministerial Influence that 
must arise from such Appointments, cannot be of much Use 
in their Colony Affairs. In truth, I think the Agents, as now 
appointed, of as much Use to the Government here as to the 
Colonies that send them, having often prevented its going 
into mistaken Measures thro' Misinformation, that must 
have been very inconvenient to itself, and would have prevented more of the same kind if they had been attended to, 
witness the Stamp and Duty Acts. I believe therefore we 
shall conclude to leave this omniscient infallible Minister to 
his own Devices, and be no longer at the Expence of sending 
any Agent, whom he can displace by a Repeal of the appointing Act. I am sure I should not like to be an Agent in 
such a suspicious Situation, and shall therefore decline serving 
under every such Appointment. 
</p><p>
Your Assembly may avoid the Dispute you seem apprehensive of, by leaving the Appointment of an Agent out of the 
Support Bill, or rather I should say the Sum for his Salary. 
The Money in my Hands will pay him (whoever he is) for 
two or three Years, in which the Measure and the Minister, 
may be changed. In the mean time, by working with a 
Friend who has great Influence at the Board, he can serve 
the Province as effectually as by an open Reception and 
Appearance. . . . 
</p><p>
. . . ' Our Friend Sir John Pringle put into my hand the 
other Day a Letter from Mr. Bowman, seeming, I thought, 
a good deal pleas'd with the Notice you had taken of his 
Recommendation. I send you a Copy of it, that you may 
see the Man has a grateful Disposition. Temple has been 
at home with us during the Christmas Vacation from School. 
He improves continually, and more and more engages the 
Regard of all that are acquainted with him, by his pleasing, 
sensible, manly Behaviour. 
</p><p>
I have of late great Debates with myself whether or not I 
shall continue here any longer. I grow homesick, and, being 
now in my 6yth Year, I begin to apprehend some Infirmity 
of Age may attack me, and make my Return impracticable. 
</p><p>
I have, also, some important Affairs to settle before my 
Death, a Period I ought now to think cannot be far distant. 
I see here no Disposition in Parliament to meddle farther in 
Colony Affairs for the present, either to lay more Duties or 
to repeal any ; and I think, tho' I were to return again, I may 
be absent from hence a Year without any Prejudice to the 
Business I am engag'd in, tho' it is not probable, that, being 
once at home I should ever again see England. I have indeed 
so many good kind Friends here, that I could spend the 
Remainder of my Life among them with great Pleasure, if 
it were not for my American connections, & the indelible 
Affection I retain for that dear Country, from which I have 
so long been in a State of Exile. My love to Betsey. I am ever your affectionate Father,

DEAR FRIEND, <a href='/results.php?city=london' rel='city origin'>London</a> <a rel="month origin" value="2">Feb</a> <a rel='day origin' value='4'>4</a> <a href='/results.php?year=1772' rel="origin">1772</a>

I have written two or three small Letters to you since my 
Return from Ireland and Scotland. I now have before me 
your Favours of Oct. i. Nov. 5. and Nov. 13. Mr. Todd has 
not yet shewn me that which you wrote to him about the New 
Colony, tho' he mentioned it, and will let me see it, I suppose, 
when I call on him. I told you in one of mine, that he has 
advanced for your Share what has been paid by others, tho' 
I was ready to do it, and shall in the whole Affair take the 
same Care of your Interest as of my own. 
</p><p>
You take Notice that "<a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>'s Friends will not 
allow me any Merit in this Transaction, but insist the Whole is owing to his superior Abilities." It is a common Error in 
Friends when they would extol their Friend, to make Comparisons & to depreciate the Merits of others. It was not 
necessary for his Friends to do so in this Case. <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a> 
will in Truth have a good deal of Merit in the Affair if it succeeds, he having been exceedingly active and industrious in 
soliciting it, and in drawing up Memorials and Papers to support the Application, remove objections, etc. But tho' I have 
not been equally active, (it not being thought proper that I 
should appear much in the Solicitation since I became a little 
obnoxious to the Ministry on Ace' of my Letters to America) 
yet I suppose my Advice may have been thought of some 
Use, since it has been ask'd on every Step, and I believe that 
being longer and better known here than <a href='/results.php?tla=thw' rel='friend met co-worker'>Mr. Wharton</a>, I may 
have lent some Weight to his Negociations by joining in the 
Affair, from the greater Confidence men are apt to place in 
one they know, than in a Stranger. However, as I neither 
ask nor expect any particular Consideration for any Service 
I may have done, and only think I ought to escape Censure, 
I shall not enlarge on this invidious Topic. 
</p><p>
Let us all do our Endeavours, in our several Capacities, 
for the common Service, and if one has the Ability or Opportunity of doing more for his Friends than another, let him 
think that a Happiness, and be satisfied. The Business is 
not yet quite compleated, and as many Things happen between the Cup & the Lip, perhaps there may be nothing of 
this kind for Friends to dispute about. For if nobody should 
receive any Benefit, there would be no Scrambling for the 
Honour. Stavers is in the wrong to talk of my promising him 
the Rider's Place again. I only told him that I would (as he 
requested it) recommend him to Mr. Hubbard, to be replac'd 
if it could be done without Impropriety or Inconveniency. 
This I did, & the rather as I had always understood him to 
be a good honest punctual Rider. His Behaviour to you 
entitles him to no Favour and I believe any Application he 
may make here, will be to little purpose: 
</p><p>
In yours from N. York, of July 3. You mention'd your 
Intention of purchasing a Bill to send hither, as soon as you 
return'd home from your Journey. I have not since receiv'd 
any from you, which I only take notice of to you, that if you 
have sent one you may not blame me for not acknowledging 
the Receipt of it. 
</p><p>
In mine of April 20. I explained to you what I had before 
mentioned, that in settling our private Account, I had paid 
you the sum of 389^, (or thereabouts,) in my own Wrong, 
having before paid it for you to the General PostOffice. I 
hope that since you have receiv'd your Books & looked over 
the Accounts, you are satisfy'd of this. I am anxious for 
your Answer upon it, the sum being too large to be left long 
without an Adjustment. My Love to my Daughter, and 
Compliments to your Brother. I am ever, my dear friend, 
Yours most Affectionately, B FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR 
</p><p>
I received your Favour by Mr. D. Kuhn but being then

to Sweden. I shall, if he returns hither while I am here,

I suppose your Son Richard will spend some time in London, where by what I have heard, Physic and Surgery may 
be studied to as great Advantage as in any Part of the World, 
by Attending the Anatomical Lectures and Hospitals, conversing with the most eminent Practitioners, and Reading 
under their Advice and Direction: And yet the General Run is at present to Edinburgh ; there being at the Opening 
of the Schools when I was there in November last, a much 
greater Number of medical Students than had ever been 
known before. They have indeed a Set of Able Professors 
in the several Branches, if common Opinion may be rely'd on. 
I who am no Judge in that Science, can only say that I found 
them very sensible Men, and agreable Companions. I will 
endeavour to obtain Sir John Pringle's Advice in the Affair, 
as you desire. Every Wednesday Evening he admits young 
Physicians and Surgeons to a Conversation at his House, 
which is thought very improving to them. I will endeavour 
to introduce your Son there when he comes to London. And 
to tell you frankly my Opinion, I suspect there is more 
valuable knowledge in Physic to be learnt from the honest 
candid Observations of an old Practitioner, who is past all 
desire of more Business, having made his Fortune, who has 
none of the Professional Interest in keeping up a Parade of 
Science to draw Pupils, and who by Experience has discovered the Inefficacy of most Remedies and Modes of Practice, 
than from all the formal Lectures of all the Universities upon 
Earth. I like therefore a Physician's breeding his Son to 
Medicine, and wish the Art to be continued with the Race, 
as thinking that must be upon the whole most for the Publick Welfare. 
</p><p>
When I was last at your House I observed that the Paint 
of the Picture you had was all cracked. I complain'd of 
it to the Painter. He acknowledged that in that Picture, and 
three others, he had made Trial of a new Vernish which had 
been Attended with this mischievous Effect; and offer'd 
to make Amends, if I would sit to him again, by drawing a 
new Picture gratis, only on this Condition, that the old one 
should be returned to him. I wrote this to Mrs. Franklin, 
who should have acquainted you with it, but I suppose forgot 
it. He was 5 or 6 Years in finishing it, having much other 
Business. If therefore you like the new one best, please to 
put the old one in a Box, and send it by the next Ship hither, 
as the Painter expects to have one or the other returned. 
</p><p>
Mr. Small, an ingenious Gentleman, now gone to Jamaica, 
has bequeathed to our Society, some Journals of the Weather 
which he kept there with great Accuracy, which I shall send 
you as soon as they come into my Hands. With this you will 
receive a Circular Scheme for noting the Variations of the 
Barometer, and comparing them in different and distant 
Places, which he recommends to be used by the Members of 
the Society that inhabit different Provinces, as he conceives 
that some curious and useful Discoveries in Meteorology 
may thence arise. I send also a Box from Mr. Ludlam, containing some Books which he presents to the Society; a 
Parcel with some Books presented by Mr. Forster; another with two Volumes of the Philosophical Transactions presented 
to our Society by the Royal Society here, in Return for the 
Volume you sent them. I inclose Mr. Forster's l Letter, a 
Letter of Thanks from the Society of Arts, and a Letter from 
Mr. Ludlam. Dr. Smith in a Letter which came with the 
Books, gave me to expect another Box with Copies for the 
learned Societies abroad; and a few spare ones for my 
Friends ; but they are not yet come to hand ; and I am often 
ask'd by the Curious how it happens that none are to be 
bought here. 
</p><p>
I hope soon to receive them, and have no doubt but it will 
procure us the Correspondence of those Societies. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the inaugural Dissertation, and am pleas' d 
to see our School of Physic begin to make a Figure. I know 
not why it should not soon be equal to that in Edinburgh. 
I am much oblig'd to the young gentleman who has done me 
the Honour to inscribe his Performance to me. I wish him 
the Success his Ingenuity seems to promise him.

with you both most sincerely on the great Loss you have

DEAR DOCTOR, 
</p><p>
The trunks of silk were detained at the customhouse till 
very lately; first, because of the holidays, and then waiting 
to get two persons, skilful in silk, to make a valuation of it, 
in order to ascertain the bounty. As soon as that was done, 
and the trunks brought to my house, I waited on Dr. Fothergill to request he would come and see it opened, and consult 
about disposing of it, which he could not do till last Thursday. 
On examining it, we found that the valuers had opened all 
the parcels, in order, we suppose, to see the quality of each, 
had neglected to make them up again, and the directions and 
marks were lost, (except that from Mr. Parke, and that of 
the second crop,) so that we could not find which was intended for the Queen, and which for the Proprietary family. 
Then, being no judges ourselves, we concluded to get Mr. Patterson or some other skilful person, to come and pick 
out six pounds of the best for her Majesty, and four pounds 
for each of the other ladies. This I have endeavoured, but 
it is not yet done, though I hourly expect it. 
</p><p>
Mr. Boydell, broker for the ship, attended the customhouse to obtain the valuation, and had a great deal of trouble 
to get it managed. I have not since seen him, nor heard the 
sum they reported, but hope to give you all the particulars 
by the next ship, which I understand sails in about a fortnight, when Dr. Fothergill and myself are to write a joint 
letter to the committee, to whom please to present my respects, and assure them of my most faithful services. I am charmed 
with the sight of such a quantity the second year, and have 
great hopes the produce will now be established. The second crop silk seems to me not inferior to the others; and, 
if it is practicable with us to have two crops, and the second 
season does not interfere too much with other business in the 
farming way, I think it will be a great addition to the profits, 
as well as to the quantity. 
</p><p>
Dr. Fothergill has a number of Chinese drawings, of which 
some represent the process of raising silk, from the beginning 
to the end. I am to call at his house and assist in looking 
them out, he intending to send them as a present to the Silk 
Company. I have now only time to add, that I am ever, 
yours very affectionately, B FRANKLIN

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I was in Ireland when your respected Fav of July 8. 
arrived at my House here. On my Return which was just 
before the Meeting of Parliam' I by a Line or two acknowledg'd the Receipt of it, intending to write more largely as 
soon as any Business should occur. I hoped the Petition 
relating to the controverted Lands would have been brought 
forward long before this time, having been assured when it 
was presented that it should in its Turn come under Consideration ; but such has been the Croud of more important 
Affairs, that the Council have as yet found no time to do any 
thing in it. Tho' I flatter my self, as no solicitation is omitted, 
that it may be brought to a favourable Conclusion before the 
Season of Business is over. 
</p><p>
Your Account of the Governor's Treatment of the Assembly & your self, determined me to wait upon him on his 
Arrival here, as we can not but greatly disapprove his Conduct. As your Mode of appointing an Agent is by an Ordinance to which he must give his Assent I think it not likely 
that I shall be continued in that Service for your Province. 
I shall nevertheless continue to render it every Good Office 
in my power while I remain in England, which I think will 
not now be much longer. 
</p><p>
The presenting of a Speaker to the King I suppose was 
originally intended that the King might know the Person 
from whom he was to receive the Sense of Parliament on 
every proper Occasion. To facilitate the Intercourse, it is 
probable the Parliament might think it advisable rather to 
chuse (other Qualifications being equal) a Person not justly 
obnoxious to the King; and then it was natural for him to 
compliment them by saying he approv'd their Choice. But 
from this it by no means follows, that without such Approbation the Speaker could not continue in his Office, or that if 
the House refus'd to chuse another, it would be a justifiable 
Use of the Prerogative therefore to dissolve them. I believe 
a King of England at this Day would hardly venture on such 
a Step; but Governors take greater Liberties, having naturally no Respect for the People, but abundance for Ministers. It is by the Arbitrary Proceedings of Governors & other 
Crown Officers countenanced by their Protectors here, that 
the Affections of the Americans to this Country are daily 
diminishing, and their Attachment to its Government in 
danger of being lost in the Course of a few succeeding Years. 
As a Disunion would be a Weakening to the Empire, & of 
course prejudicial to [remainder of letter lost]

SIR, 
</p><p>
I wrote to you in January last a long letter, by Meyrick, and at the same time wrote to the Committee, since which I 
have received no line from any one in <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>, nor has Mr. Bollan yet received the answer we wait for, respecting the eastern settlements on the crown land. 
</p><p>
The Parliament has been employed in the royal marriage 
bill, and other business; nothing of importance relating to a First published by Sparks. 
America has been mentioned hitherto during the session, 
and it is thought that India affairs will fill up the remainder 
of the time, to the prorogation. I have not met with Lord 
Hillsborough since my return from Ireland, seeing no use at 
present in attending his levees. The papers mentioned his 
intention of moving something in the House of Lords relating 
to America, but I cannot learn there was any truth in it. 
</p><p>
It is my present purpose to return home this summer, 
in which case, I suppose I am to leave your business and 
papers in the hands of Mr. Lee, which I shall do, if I do not 
receive other directions. 
</p><p>
Upon the present plan here of admitting no agent, but such 
as governors shall approve of, from year to year, and of course 
none but such as the ministry approves of, I do not conceive 
that agents can be of much use to you; and, therefore, I 
suppose you would rather decline appointing any. In my 
opinion, they have at all times been of full as much service 
to government here, as to the colonies from whence they 
come, and might still be so, if properly attended to, in preventing, by their better information, those disgraceful blunders of government, that arise from its ignorance of our situation, circumstances, abilities, temper, &c., such as the Stamp 
Act, which too would have been prevented, if the agents had 
been regarded. Therefore I should think, that, if agents 
can be allowed here on no other footing than is now proposed, 
we should omit sending any, and leave the crown, when 
it wants our aids, or would transact business with us, to 
send its minister to the colonies. 
</p><p>
Be pleased to present my respects to the Committee, and 
duty to the Assembly, and believe me, with sincere esteem, 
&c. B. FRANKLIN.

I received your Favour of March 5, by M. Dazeux, and

Mr. West, our President, concerning whom you make 
enquiry, is esteemed a good Antiquarian, but has not distinguish'd himself in any other Branch of Science. He is a 
Member of Parliament, was formerly Secretary to the Treasury, and is very rich. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear that a Voyage is intended from France 
to the North Pole. The World owes much to the noble 
Spirit with which your Nation pursues the Improvement 
of Knowledge, and to the Liberality with which you communicate what you acquire to the rest of Mankind. I hope

You must go half an Inch farther with your Spark to

in <a href='/results.php?year=1758'>1758</a> to Lord Charles Cavendish and others, who judg'd 
them to be nine Inches. My Cushion was of Buckskin

Tin 4 feet long and about 4 Inches Diameter. So powerful 
a Machine had then never been seen in England before, as

mine for Mr. Simmer, and was afterwards in the Possession 
of Lord Morton: A more convenient Construction I have 
never since seen, except that of yours. I intend soon to repeat 
Barletti's experiments, being provided with the Requisites, 
and shall let you know the Result. 
</p><p>
I should be glad to see the French Translation of your 
Book. Can you conveniently lend it to me when you have 
perus'd it? I fancy it was translated at the Request of 
Abbe' Nollet by a Friend & Disciple of his as I know there 
was one (whose Name I have forgotten) that us'd to translate 
for him Extracts of English Electrical Books. 
</p><p>
The Abbe''s Machine was a very bad one, requiring three 
Persons to make the smallest Experiment, one to turn the 
great Wheel, and one to hold Hands on the Globe. And the 
Effect after all but weak. De lor had a similar one, and 
invited me to see him exhibit to the Duchess of Rochefoucauld but the Weather being a little warm, he could perform 
nothing, scarce obtaining a Spark. 
</p><p>
This Inconvenience must have occasioned his making 
fewer Experiments, & of course his not being so easily convinced. M. Le Roy, however, got early possession of the 
Truth, & combated for it with Nollet ; yet I think the Academy rather favoured the latter. Le Roy will, I suppose, 
now confute this translator, for I have just seen a Letter of 
his to Mr. Magelhaens, thanking him for sending so excellent 
an Electrical Machine to France ; (it is one of the Plate ones) 
which he has improved so as to produce the positive and negative electricities separately or together at the same time, 
"de fafon" (says he) "qu'on peut faire toutes les experiences 
possibles sur Tune ou Pautre de ces deux e'lectricite's. Enfin 
on e"toit si eloigne' de connoitre les phe'nomenes de ces deux 
electricite's ici, faute de machines commodes de les demontrer, 
que beaucoup des gens ont e'te' e'tonne's de voir avec quelle 
evidence ils e'tablissent la distinction de ces deux e'lectricite's," 
&c. This Letter is of the 5th instant. 
</p><p>
My best Wishes attend you and yours. I am ever, with 
great Respect, my dear Friend, 
</p><p>
Yours most sincerely, 
</p><p>
B. F[RANKLIN.]

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I received your kind Letter of March 2, and am glad to 
hear that the Ship from Ireland is got safe into Antigua. I 
hope you will now get the little Token I sent you from thence. 
I have not receiv'd the Letter you mention to have given the 
young Scotsman, nor that from Mr. Craige. 
</p><p>
I am sorry for the Disorder that has fallen on our Friend 
Kinnersley, but hope he will get the better of it. I thank you 
for your Advice about putting back a Fit of the Gout. I 
shall never attempt such a Thing. Indeed I have not much 
occasion to complain of the Gout, having had but two slight 
Fits since I came last to England. I hope Mr. Bache is 
with you and his Family by this Time, as he sailed from the 
Downs the latter End of February. My Love to him and 
Sally, and young Master, who I suppose is Master of the 
House. Tell him, that Billy Hewson is as much thought of 
here as he can be there; was wean'd last Saturday; loves 
musick ; comes to see his Gran-ma ; and will be lifted up to 
knock at the Door himself, as he has done while I was writing 
this at the Request of Mrs. Stevenson, who sends her Love, 
as Sally does her Duty. Thanks to God, I continue well, 
and am, as ever, your affectionate Husband,

SIR, 
</p><p>
Having visited yesterday, as you desired, the powder magazines at Purfleet, in order to see how they may be protected 
against danger from lightning, I think, 
</p><p>
1. That all the iron bars, which pass down along the 
arches, from the top to the place where the powder is 
deposited, should be removed; as they now constitute, 
with the brass hoops with which the casks are bound, an 
imperfect conductor; imperfect in proportion to the greater 
or less height to which the casks are piled ; but, in any case, 
such that they can only serve to attract towards the powder 
the first stroke that falls upon the arch; and that they are 
consequently very dangerous. 
</p><p>
2. That the building, which has a leaden coping along 
the ridge from one end to the other, may be secured by 
means of a pointed iron rod, carried up near each end, communicating with this coping, and extending through the rock 
of chalk, which serves as the foundation of the building, 
till it meets with water. This rod should be at least an inch 
in diameter, that it may be more durable, and afford the lightning a more free course through its substance ; and it should 
be painted, to preserve it from rust. Its upper extremity 
should be carried ten feet above the summit of the roof, 
and taper off gradually till it ends in a sharp point ; and, the 
better to preserve this point, the last six inches should be of 
brass, because it is less liable to become blunted by rust. 
If the rod cannot well be made entirely of a single piece, 
the different pieces composing it should be strongly screwed 
together, or into one another very closely, with a thin plate of 
lead between the joints, in order to render the junction or 
continuation of the metal more perfect. 
</p><p>
After all the electrical experiments that I have made in 
reference to this subject, and all the examples that have come 
to my knowledge of the effects of lightning on these conductors, it seems to me, that (provided they are good and perfect, 
carried down till water or very moist ground is reached) 
they are equally safe, whether placed directly against the wall, 
and secured by staples driven into it, or whether supported 
by a pole or staff planted in the ground, at some distance from 
the wall. The former is the better mode, as the rod can be 
bent to avoid the windows or doors, which are situated directly below the summit of the roof. Yet, as certain apprehensions may be more effectually set at rest by supporting 
the rods in the other manner, I should make no objection 
to this, provided that they can be suitably placed, without 
interfering with any passage, and that they are so firmly 
fixed that the wind cannot, by causing them to vibrate, interrupt the communication of iron or lead, between the side of 
the rod and the lead that covers the ridge. 
</p><p>
3. As I am informed that the roofs of the other four buildings are to be reconstructed after the model of that of which 
I have just been speaking, the same method may be followed 
with regard to them, when they are finished in this manner. 
But, if it be asked how they may be rendered secure in the 
mean time, I would advise, that, (as their roofs are now of a 
different form, being hip-roofs with four corners, and the 
joining at their corners, as well as their ridge-pieces, having 
a coping of lead, which extends to the gutters,) the passages, 
which it is proposed to carry down till water is reached, be 
bored or dug immediately, and that that part of each conductor, which is to be carried up from the water as high as the 
gutters, be fixed in them. From the top of this conductor 
I would carry out two arms of iron to the corners of the gutters, where the leaden coping of the corners of the roof should 
be united to the ends of these bars; and at the junction of 
these corners with the ridge-piece, I would carry up rods to 
the height of ten feet, pointed as directed above; which, 
when a new roof is made, could be used for the upper part of 
a straight conductor. I am, Sir, 
</p><p>
Your most obedient humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P. S. For that part of the conductor which is to be carried 
under ground, leaden pipes should be used, as less liable to 
rust.

DEAR SIR,

I am much obliged to you for introducing me to the Knowledge of M. le Marquis d'Ecrammeville, who appears a very 
amiable Man, with an excellent Understanding. 
</p><p>
Abraham Mansword's Advice to his Countrymen is very 
good. I hope they will have more of it. 
</p><p>
Pray inform me by a Line, whether M. Le Roy has paid 
for the Ephemerides in my Behalf. If not, I will upon Sight 
discharge the amount, by paying your Draft upon me. And 
I request they may be continually sent me as long as you are 
concerned in them. 
</p><p>
Go on to do good with your inlighten'd Pen, and by instructing them & inciting them to Virtue deserve well of 
Mankind & of their common Father. 
</p><p>
With sincere and great Esteem, I am, my Dear Friend, 
Yours most affectionately,

SIR : I thank you for the pamphlets proposing to establish 
Life Annuities in Parishes, &c. I think it an excellent one. 
In compliance with your wish, pages 25, 26, I send it back 
with a few marginal notes (perhaps of no great importance) 
made in reading it, requesting it may be returned to me. 
</p><p>
In page 118 of Dr. Price's book on Annuities, 2d edition, 
you will find mention made of an institution in Holland. 
He had that information from me. Those houses are handsome, neat buildings, with very comfortable apartments. 
Some form the sides of a square, with grass-plots and gravel 
walks, flowers, &c., and some have little separate gardens 
behind each apartment. Those for men are called Oude 
Mannen Huyzen; for women, Oude Vrouwen Huyzen. 
I think the different kinds sometimes make different sides 
of the same square. There is a chapel for prayers, a common 
kitchen, and a common hall in which they dine together. 
Two persons, such as best like one another, and choose so 
to associate, are generally lodged in one apartment, though in separate beds, that they may be at hand to assist each other 
in case of sudden illness in the night, and otherwise be mutually helpful. 
</p><p>
The Directors have also a room to meet in, who form rules, 
for the government of the house, hear complaints, and rectify 
what is amiss. Gentlemen are directors of the Oude Mannen 
Huyzen, ladies of the Oude Vrouwen Huyzen. A committee 
of two are chosen every year, who visit often, see the rules 
observed, and take care of the management. At the end of 
the year these are thanked off, and as an honourable memorial 
of their services, their names, with the year they served, are 
added to the Gold Letter List on the walls of the room. All 
the furniture is neat and convenient, the beds and rooms 
kept clean and sweet by the servants of the house ; and the 
people appear to live happily. 
</p><p>
These institutions seem calculated to prevent poverty, 
which is rather a better thing than relieving it. For it keeps 
always in the public eye a state of comfort and repose in old 
age, with freedom from care held forth as an encouragement 
to so much industry and frugality in youth as may at least serve 
to raise the required sum (suppose 50) that is to entitle a 
man or a woman at fifty to a retreat in those houses. And 
in acquiring this sum habits may be acquired that produce 
such affluence before that age arrives, as to make the retreat 
unnecessary and so never claimed. Hence if 50 would 
(as by your table) entitle a man at fifty years of age to an 
annuity of 19,3,6^, I suppose that in such a house, entertainment, and accommodations to a much greater value might 
be afforded him ; because the right to live there is not transferable, and therefore every unclaimed right is an advantage to 
the house, while annuities would probably all be claimed. 
Then it seems to me that the prospect of a distant annuity 
will not be so influencing on the minds of young people, as 
the constant view of the comfort enjoyed in those houses, 
in comparison of which the payment and receipt of the annuities are private transactions. 
</p><p>
I write this in hopes you will, after consideration, favour 
me with your opinion whether (in addition to your plan, 
which will still have all advantages for smaller sums) one or 
more such houses in every county, would not probably be 
of great use in still farther promoting industry and frugality 
among the lower people and of course lessening the enormous 
weight of the poor- tax? 
</p><p>
I enclose a little piece I wrote in America, to encourage 
and strengthen those important virtues, of which I beg your 
acceptance, and am, with great esteem, Sir, your most 
</p><p>
obedient and humble Servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

MY DEAR CHILD, 
</p><p>
I am just returned from a Journey of near a Month, which 
has given a new Spring to my Health and Spirits. I did not 
get home in time to write by Osborne, but shall fully to my 
Friends in general by Cap. All, who sails about the End of 
the Week. 
</p><p>
I was charg'd with Abundance of Love to you and Sally 
and Ben from our Sister Bache and her amiable Daughters. 
I spent some Days at Preston, visited several Friends in 
Cumberland, Westmoreland, Yorkshire, and Staffordshire. 
</p><p>
Rachel Wilson sent her Love to you and our Children, as did 
our remaining Relations at Birmingham, where I likewise 
staied several Days. In Cumberland I ascended a very high 
Mountain, where I had a Prospect of a most beautiful Country, of Hills, Fields, Lakes, Villas, &c. and at Whitehaven 
went down the Coal mines till they told me I was 80 Fathoms 
under the Surface of the Sea, which roll'd over our Heads; 
so that I have been nearer both the upper and lower Regions 
than ever in my Life before. My Love to our Children, 
and all enquiring Friends. I am ever, my dear Debby, your 
affectionate Husband, R FRANKLIN>

I send you three Guineas by our valuable Friend M. Baudeau, 
requesting you will let me have the Accompt at your Leisure,

DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
At length we have got rid of Lord Hillsborough, and Lord 
Dartmouth takes his place, to the great satisfaction of all 
the friends of America. You will hear it said among you, 
I suppose, that the interest of the Ohio planters has ousted 
him; but the truth is, what I wrote you long since, that all 
his brother ministers disliked him extremely, and wished for 
a fair occasion of tripping up his heels; so, seeing that he 
made a point of defeating our scheme, they made another of 
supporting it, on purpose to mortify him, which they knew 
his pride could not bear. I do not mean they would have 
done this, if they had thought our proposal bad in itself, or 
his opposition well founded ; but I believe, if he had been on 
good terms with them, they would not have differed with 
him for so small a matter. The King, too, was tired of him 
and of his administration, which had weakened the affection 
and respect of the colonies for a royal government, of which 
(I may say it to you) I used proper means from time to time 
that his Majesty should have due information and convincing 
proofs. More of this when I see you. 
</p><p>
The King's dislike made the others more firmly united 
in the resolution of disgracing Hillsborough, by setting at 
nought his famous report. But, now that business is done, 
perhaps our affair may be less regarded in the cabinet and 
suffered to linger, and possibly may yet miscarry. Therefore let us beware of every word and action, that may betray 
a confidence in its success, lest we render ourselves ridiculous in case of disappointment. We are now pushing for a 
completion of the business; but the time is unfavourable, 
everybody gone or going into the country, which gives room 
for accidents. 
</p><p>
I am writing by Falconer, and therefore in this only add, 
that I am ever your affectionate father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN. 
</p><p>
P.S. The regard Lord Dartmouth has always done me 
the honour to express for me, gives me room to hope being able 
to obtain more in favour of our colonies upon occasion, than 
I could for some time past.

</p><p>
[DEAR SON,] 
</p><p>
In yours of May 14th, you acquaint me with your indisposition, which gave me great concern. The resolution you 
have taken to use more exercise is extremely proper; and I 
hope you will steadily perform it. It is of the greatest importance to prevent diseases, since the cure of them by physic 
is so very precarious. 
</p><p>
In considering the different kinds of exercise, I have thought, 
that the quantum of each is to be judged of, not by time or 
by distance, but by the degree of warmth it produces in the 
body. Thus, when I observe, if I am cold when I get into a 
carriage in a morning, I may ride all day without being 
warmed by it ; that, if on horseback my feet are cold, I may 
ride some hours before they become warm; but, if I am 
ever so cold on foot, I cannot walk an hour briskly, without 
glowing from head to foot by the quickened circulation; I 
have been ready to say, (using round numbers without regard 
to exactness, but merely to mark a great difference), that there 
is more exercise in one mile's riding on horseback, than in 
five in a coach ; and more in one mile's walking on foot, than 
in five on horseback ; to which I may add, that there is more 
in walking one mile up and down stairs, than in five on a 
level floor. The two latter exercises may be had within 
doors, when the weather discourages going abroad ; and the 
last may be had when one is pinched for time, as containing 
a great quantity of exercise in a handful of minutes. The 
dumb bell is another exercise of the latter compendious kind. 
By the use of it I have in forty swings quickened my pulse 
from sixty to one hundred beats in a minute, counted by a 
second watch; and I suppose the warmth generally increases 
</p><p>
with quickness of pulse. 
</p><p>

</p><p>
DEAR SON, 
</p><p>
I received yours of June soth. I am vexed that my letter 
to you, written at Glasgow, miscarried; not so much that 
you did not receive it, as that it is probably in other hands. 
It contained some accounts of what passed in Ireland, which 
were for you only. 
</p><p>
As Lord Hillsborough in fact got nothing out of me, I 
should rather suppose he threw me away as an orange that 
would yield no juice, and therefore not worth more squeezing. 
When I had been a little while returned to London, I waited 
on him to thank him for his civilities in Ireland, and to discourse with him on a Georgia affair. The porter told me 
he was not at home. I left my card, went another time, and 
received the same answer, though I knew he was at home, a 
friend of mine being with him. After intermissions of a week 
each, I made two more visits, and received the same answer. 
The last time was on a levee day, when a number of carriages 
were at his door. My coachman driving up, alighted, and 
was opening the coach door, when the porter, seeing me, 
came out, and surlily chid the coachman for opening the door 
before he had inquired whether my Lord was at home ; and 
then turning to me, said, "My Lord is not at home." I have 
never since been nigh him, and we have only abused one 
another at a distance. 
</p><p>
The contrast, as you observe, is very striking between his 
conversation with the chief justice, and his letter to you concerning your province. I know him to be as double and 
deceitful as any man I ever met with. But we have done 
with him, I hope, for ever. His removal has, I believe, been 
meditated ever since the death of the Princess Dowager. For 
I recollect, that on my complaining of him about that time 
to a friend at court, whom you may guess, he told me, we 
Americans were represented by Hillsborough as an unquiet 
people, not easily satisfied with any ministry ; that, however, 
it was thought too much occasion had been given us to dislike 
the present ; and asked me, whether, if he should be removed, 
I could name another likely to be more acceptable to us. 
I said, "Yes, there is Lord Dartmouth; we liked him very 
well when he was at the head of the Board formerly, and 
probably should like him again." This I heard no more 
of, but I am pretty sure it was reported where I could wish it, 
though I know not that it had any effect. 
</p><p>
As to my situation here, nothing can be more agreeable, 
especially as I hope for less embarrassment from the new 
minister ; a general respect paid me by the learned, a number 
of friends and acquaintance among them, with whom I have 
a pleasing intercourse; a character of so much weight, that 
it has protected me when some in power would have done me 
injury, and continued me in an office they would have deprived me of; my company so much desired, that I seldom 
dine at home in winter, and could spend the whole summer 
in the country-houses of inviting friends, if I chose it. 
Learned and ingenious foreigners, that come to England, 
almost all make a point of visiting me ; for my reputation is 
still higher abroad than here. Several of the foreign ambassadors have assiduously cultivated my acquaintance, treating 
me as one of their corps, partly I believe from the desire they 
have, from time to time, of hearing something of American 
affairs, an object become of importance in foreign courts, 
who begin to hope Britain's alarming power will be diminished by the defection of her colonies; and partly that they 
may have an opportunity of introducing me to the gentlemen 
of their country who desire it. The King, too, has lately 
been heard to speak of me with great regard. 
</p><p>
These are flattering circumstances; but a violent longing 
for home sometimes seizes me, which I can no otherwise 
subdue but by promising myself a return next spring or next 
fall, and so forth. As to returning hither, if I once go back, I 
have no thoughts of it. I am too far advanced in life to propose three voyages more. I have some important affairs to 
settle at home, and, considering my double expenses here and 
there, I hardly think my salaries fully compensate the disadvantages. The late change, however, being thrown into 
the balance, determines me to stay another winter. 
</p><p>
August 22d. I find I omitted congratulating you on the 
honour of your election into the Society for propagating the 
Gospel. There you match indeed my Dutch honour. But 
you are again behind, for last night I received a letter from 
Paris, of which the enclosed is an extract, acquainting me 
that I am chosen Associe Etr anger (foreign member) of the 
Royal Academy there. There are but eight of these Associes 
Etrangers in all Europe, and those of the most distinguished 
names of science. The vacancy I have the honour of filling 
was made by the death of the late celebrated Van Swieten of 
Vienna. This mark of respect from the first academy in the 
world, which Abbe' Nollet, one of its members, took so much 
pains to prejudice against my doctrines, I consider as a kind 
of victory without ink-shed, since I never answered him. I 
am told he has but one of his sect now remaining in the Academy. All the rest, who have in any degree acquainted themselves with electricity, are as he calls them Franklinists.
</p><p>
Yours, &c. B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I made a little extract from yours of April 27, of the number 
of slaves imported and perishing, with some close remarks 
on the hypocrisy of this country, which encourages such a 
detestable commerce by laws for promoting the Guinea trade ; 
while it piqued itself on its virtue, love of liberty, and the 
equity of its courts, in setting free a single negro. This was 
inserted in the London Chronicle, of the 2Oth of June last. 
</p><p>
I thank you for the Virginia address, which I shall also 
publish with some remarks. I am glad to hear that the disposition against keeping negroes grows more general in North 
America. Several pieces have been lately printed here 
against the practice, and I hope in time it will be taken into 
consideration and suppressed by the legislature. Your 
labours have already been attended with great effects. I 
hope, therefore, you and your friends will be encouraged 
to proceed. My hearty wishes of success attend you, being 
</p><p>
ever, my dear friend, yours affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

My dear old Friend, I received your kind letter of 
May 10. I am glad the Rhubarb Seed got safe to hand. I 
make no doubt of its Thriving well in our Country, where the 
Climate is the same with that of the Chinese Wall, just outside which it grows in plenty and of the best Quality. I shall 
be glad to know how you find the Juniper. I asked Solander 
about the Lucern Seed you wrote for. He could give me no 
Account of it, nor can I learn anything of it from others. 
You may rely upon my Friendship in recommending your 
Seeds. I send all that enquire of me about American Seeds 
to Mr. Freeman. He should advertise them when they come. 
</p><p>
I hear nothing lately of Young, and think him not of much 
Consequence. With Love to Mrs. Bartram and your Children, I am ever, my dear Friend, yours most Affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I acknowledged before the receipt of your favour of May 14, 
since which I have no line from you. It will be a pleasure to 
render any service to Mr. Tilghman whom you recommended. 
</p><p>
The acts passed in your winter and spring sessions I have 
not yet received, nor have I heard from Mr. Wilmot, that they 
have been presented. 
</p><p>
Lord Hillsborough, mortified by the Committee of Council's 
approbation of our grant, in opposition to his report, has 
resigned. I believe when he offered to do so, he had 
such an opinion of his importance that he did not think 
it would be accepted ; and that it would be thought prudent 
rather to set our grant aside than part with him. His colleagues in the ministry were all glad to get rid of him, and perhaps for this reason joined more readily in giving him that 
mortification. Lord Dartmouth succeeds him, who has much 
more favourable dispositions towards the colonies. He has 
heretofore expressed some personal regard for me, and I hope 
now to find our business with the Board more easy to transact. 
</p><p>
Your observations on the state of the Islands did not come 
to hand, till after Lord Rochford had withdrawn his petition. 3 
His Lordship and the promoters of it were so roasted on the 
occasion, that I believe another of the kind will not very soon 
be thought of. The Proprietor was at the expense of the 
opposition, and as I knew it would not be necessary, and 
thought it might be inconvenient to our affairs, I did not 
openly engage in it ; but I gave some private assistance, that 
I believe was not without effect. I think too that Mr. Jackson's opinion was of great service. I would lodge a 
copy of your paper in the Plantation Office against any 
similar future applications, if you approve of it. I only 
think the Island holders make too great a concession to the 
crown, when they suppose it may have a right to quitrent. 
It can have none, in my opinion, on the old grants from Indians, Swedes, and Dutch, where none was reserved. And 
I think those grants so clearly good, as to need no confirmation ; 
to obtain which I suppose is the only motive for offering such 
quitrent. I imagine, too, that it may not be amiss to affix 
a caveat in the Plantation Office, in the behalf of holders of 
property in those islands, against any grant of them that may 
be applied for, till they have had timely notice, and an opportunity of being fully heard. Mr. Jackson is out of town, 
but I shall confer with him on the subject as soon as he returns. I am ever, my dear friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

Lord Dartmouth, now our American minister, is at present 
in the country, and will probably not be in town till the season of business comes on. I shall then immediately put the 
petition into his hands, to be presented to his Majesty. I 
may be mistaken, but I imagine we shall not meet the same

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I have deferred Writing to you agreable to the Caution 
you gave me, till this safe Opportunity offered. America 
is infinitely oblig'd to you for your continued good Wishes 
& Schemes for her Advantage : But I am sorry to tell you 
that she is here become an Object of Jealousy, and that the 
obtaining Money from our poor Treasury to forward such 
Schemes, tho' at the same time equally beneficial to this Country, is out of all Expectation. A new Colony however is 
forming, where good Land may be had cheap, & where your 
Friend may probably find an Opportunity of serving himself 
& Family, while he is at the same time useful to the Publick 
wherein I shall be glad to serve him. Of this I shall write 
more fully when things are riper. In the meantime, I am, 
with great Esteem, Dear Sir,

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
I am glad to find by your Favour of the 2yth past, that you 
are returned safe & well to Paris after your Expedition to the 
Sea Coast, and that you intend to publish an Ace' of your 
Experiments. Your doing it as you propose in a Letter to 
me I shall esteem a very great Honour. Nothing new in the 
Philosophic Way has occurred here since my last, in which 
I think I mentioned Dr. Priestly's Experiments whereby he 
found that growing Vegetables restore Air that has been spoilt 
by Putrefaction. Your Friends here expect your Return with some Impatience. I am, with sincere Esteem &

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
In the Affair of so much Importance to you, wherein you 
ask my Advice, I cannot for want of sufficient Premises, 
advise you what to determine, but if you please I will tell you 
how. When those difficult Cases occur, they are difficult, 
chiefly because while we have them under Consideration, all 
the Reasons pro and con are not present to the Mind at the 
same time; but sometimes one Set present themselves, and 
at other times another, the first being out of Sight. Hence 
the various Purposes or Inclinations that alternately prevail, 
and the Uncertainty that perplexes us. 
</p><p>
To get over this, my Way is, to divide half a Sheet of Paper 
by a Line into two Columns ; writing over the one Pro, and 
over the other Con. Then during three or four Days Consideration, I put down under the different Heads short Hints 
of the different Motives, that at different Times occur to me, 
for or against the Measure. When I have thus got them all 
together in one View, I endeavour to estimate their respective 
Weights ; and where I find two, one on each side, that seem 
equal, I strike them both out. If I find a Reason pro equal 
to some two Reasons con, I strike out the three. If I judge 
some two Reasons con, equal to some three Reasons pro, 
</p><p>
I strike out the five; and thus proceeding I find at length 
where the Ballance lies ; and if after a Day or two of farther 
Consideration, nothing new that is of Importance occurs on 
either side, I come to a Determination accordingly. And, 
tho' the Weight of Reasons cannot be taken with the Precision 
of Algebraic Quantities, yet, when each is thus considered, 
separately and comparatively, and the whole lies before me, 
I think I can judge better, and am less liable to make a rash 
Step; and in fact I have found great Advantage from this 
kind of Equation, in what may be called Moral or Prudential 
Algebra. 
</p><p>
Wishing sincerely that you may determine for the best, 
I am ever, my dear Friend, yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR Miss, 
</p><p>
I LAMENT with you most sincerely the unfortunate end of 
poor MUNGO. Few squirrels were better accomplished; 
for he had had a good education, had travelled far, and seen 
much of the world. As he had the honour of being, for his 
virtues, your favourite, he should not go, like common skuggs, 
without an elegy or an epitaph. Let us give him one in the 
monumental style and measure, which, being neither prose 
nor verse, is perhaps the properest for grief; since to use 
common language would look as if we were not affected, and 
to make rhymes would seem trifling in sorrow. 
</p><p>
EPITAPH. 
</p><p>
Alas! poor MUNGO! 
Happy wert thou, hadst thou known 
</p><p>
Thy own felicity. 
Remote from the fierce bald eagle, 
</p><p>
Tyrant of thy native woods, 
</p><p>
Thou hadst nought to fear from his piercing talons, 
Nor from the murdering gun 
Of the thoughtless sportsman. 
</p><p>
Safe in thy wired castle, 
</p><p>
GRIMALKIN never could annoy thee. 
</p><p>
Daily wert thou fed with the choicest viands, 
</p><p>
By the fair hand of an indulgent mistress ; 
</p><p>
But, discontented, 
</p><p>
Thou wouldst have more freedom. 
</p><p>
Too soon, alas ! didst thou obtain it ; 
</p><p>
And wandering, 
Thou art fallen by the fangs of wanton, cruel RANGER! 
</p><p>
Learn hence, 
</p><p>
Ye who blindly seek more liberty, 
</p><p>
Whether subjects, sons, squirrels or daughters, 
</p><p>
That apparent restraint may be real protection ; 
</p><p>
Yielding peace and plenty 
</p><p>
With security. 
</p><p>
You see, my dear Miss, how much more decent and proper 
this broken style is, than if we were to say, by way of epitaph, 
</p><p>
Here SKUGG 
Lies snug, 
As a bug 
In a rug. 
</p><p>
and yet, perhaps, there are people in the world of so little 
feeling as to think that this would be a good-enough epitaph 
for poor Mungo. 
</p><p>
If you wish it, I shall procure another to succeed him; 
but perhaps you will now choose some other amusement. 
</p><p>
Remember me affectionately to all the good family, and 
believe me ever, 
</p><p>
Your affectionate friend, B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, Inclos'd I send you Dr. Priestly's last letter, 
of which a part is for you, he says ; but the whole seems as 
proper for you as for me. I did not advise him pro or con, 
but only explain' d to him my method of judging for myself 
in doubtful cases, by what I called Prudential Algebra. 
</p><p>
If he had come to town, and preach'd here sometimes, 
I fancy Sir John P. would now and then have been one of his 
hearers; for he likes his theology as well as his philosophy. 
Sir John has ask'd me if I knew where he could go to hear 
a preacher of rational Christianity. I told him I knew several of them, but did not know where their churches were in 
town; out of town, I mention' d yours at Newington, and 
offer 'd to go with him. He agreed to it, but said we should 
first let you know our intention. I suppose, if nothing in his 
profession prevents, we may come, if you please, next Sunday ; 
but if you sometimes preach in town, that will be most convenient to him, and I request you would by a line let me know 
when and where. If there are dissenting preachers of that 
sort at this end of the town, I wish you would recommend one 
to me, naming the place of his meeting. And if you please, 
give me a list of several, in different parts of the town, perhaps 
he may incline to take a round among them. At present I 
believe he has no view of attending constantly anywhere, 
but now and then only as it may suit his convenience. All 
this to yourself. 
</p><p>
My best respects to Mrs Price and Mrs Barker. With 
sincere wishes for your health and welfare, I am ever, my dear

Friend

Yours most affectionately,

LOVING SON : I receiv'd yours of Sept. i, and am rejoic'd 
to hear you are all well. Your good Mother and Sisters were 
so about a Fortnight ago, when I heard from them. The Bill 
you sent me for 60, Whinney on Smith, Wright, & Grey, 
being good, I return your Note enclos'd and cancel'd. There 
remains Five Guineas unpaid, which you had of me just on 
going away, so I suppose you forgot it. Send it in a Venture 
for Ben to Jamaica. By the way, it has been reported here 
that some Years since a very long Building in that Island, 
which had a Rod or Conductor at each End, was nevertheless 
struck by Lightning in the middle and much damaged. Did 
you hear of such a Thing while you was there ? If so pray 
enquire and learn the Particulars from thence, what kind of 
Rods, how plac'd, how high above the Roof, how deep in the 
Ground, and other material Circumstances with regard to the 
Building and the Damage. If you heard of no such Event 
while you was there, I suppose the Story is not true. But a 
Mr. Smith, who was there in some Business, and now here a 
Merchant, I think, relates it as what he heard spoken of 
when there. 
</p><p>
I am surprised to hear that the Dutchman I assisted with 
25 Guineas turned out a Rogue; and that Sheets has paid 
nothing of what I furnished him when here. I am afraid 
I do not grow wiser as I grow older. Pray let me know 
whether the Dutch printer, Armbruster, has paid anything, 
or is solvable or not. And also how the Affair stands 
of the Mortgage I had on my friend Maugridge's Plantation, no intelligible Information has yet been given me 
of it. 
</p><p>
We are moving to another House in the same [mutilated] 
leaving this to Mr. Hewson. As soon as I am settled in my 
new Apartments I shall examine Parker's Acc ts and write 
to you on them. 
</p><p>
You hope I was not a Sufferer in the late general Wreck 
of Credit here. My two Banking-Houses, Browns & Collinson, and Smith, Wright & Grey, stood firm, and they were the 
only People here in Debt to me, so I lost nothing by the Failure 
of others ; and being out of Debt myself, my Credit could not 
be shaken by any Run upon me ; out of Debt, as the Proverb 
says, was being out of Danger. But I have since hazarded 
a little in using my Credit with the Bank to support that of 
a Friend as far as 5,000, for which I am secured by Bills 
of the Bank of Douglas, Heron, & Co., accepted by a good 
House here; and therefore I call it only hazarding a little, 
tho' the Sum is large enough to ruin me if I were to lose it. 
Our Friends, the Alexanders, went on again immediately, 
being supported by great Houses here and thro' them by the 
Bank, their Bottom being manifestly very great and good, 
tho' they had embarrassed themselves by assisting the Adams's 
and others. 
</p><p>
The Affair of the Grant is in good Train, and we expect 
it to be compleated soon after the Boards meet; if no new 
Difficulties start up unexpected. 
My Love to Sally and the Boy. 
</p><p>
I am your affectionate Father.

MY DEAR OLD FRIEND, 
</p><p>
I received some time since the enclosed Letter from Dr. 
Hope ; and lately the Gold Medal it mentions was delivered 
to me for you. By the first ship directly to <a href='/results.php?city=philadelphia' rel='city'>Philadelphia</a>, 
I shall send it in the Care of some safe Hand, thinking it not 
so well to hazard it with this Letter round through <a href='/results.php?city=new york' rel='city'>New York</a>. 
Mr. Hope's Letter to you is not yet come to my hands. 
</p><p>
I hope the Rhubarb you have sown and distributed will be 
taken care of. There seems to me no doubt of its doing as 
well with us as in Scotland. Remember that for Use the Root 
does not come to its Perfection of Power and Virtue in less 
than Seven Years. The Physicians here, who have try'd the 
Scotch, approve it much, and say it is fully equal to the best 
imported. I send you enclosed a small Box of Upland Rice, 
brought from Cochin China. It grows there on dry Grounds, 
and not in Water like the common Sort. Also a few Seeds of 
the Chinese Tallow Tree. They have been carefully preserved 
in bringing hither by Mr. Ellis's Method. I had them from 
him, and he tells me they are in good Condition fit to vegetate. I hope they may grow under your skilful Care. My 
love to Mrs. Bartram, and all yours, from your affectionate 
Friend, B . FRANKLIN.

DEAR SON : I wrote to you per the October Packet, and 
have not since had any Line from you. I spent 16 Days 
at Lord Le Despencer's most agreably, and returned in good 
Health and Spirits. Lord Dartmouth came to town last Week, 
and had his first Levee on Wednesday, at which I attended. 
He received me very politely in his Room, only Sec y Pownall 
present, expressing some Regret that he happened to be from 
home when I was near him in the Country, where he had hop'd 
for the Pleasure of seeing me, &c. I said I was happy to see 
his Lordship in his present Situation, in which for the good 
of both Countries I hoped he would long continue; and I 
begged Leave to recommend my Son to his Protection, who, 
says I, is one of your Governors in America. The Sec y 
then put in And a very good Governor he is. Yes, says 
my Lord, he has been a good Governor, and has kept his 
Province in good Order during Times of Difficulty. I 
then said that I came at present only to pay my Respects, 
and should wait on his Lordship another Day on Business; 
to which he said he should always be ready to hear me and 
glad to see me. I shall attend his Levee again to-day, on 
some N. England Affairs, and hope we may now go on more 
smoothly; but Time will show. 
</p><p>
As the Boards are met again, the Ohio Affair will again be 
put forward as soon as Mr. Walpole comes to [town? mutilated in record], who went lately into Norfolk. I am almost 
settled in my new Apartment; but Removing, and sorting 
my Papers, and placing my Books and things has been a 
troublesome Job. I am amaz'd to see how Books have 
grown upon me since my Return to England. I brought 
none with me, and have now a Roomfull ; many collected in 
Germany, Holland and France; and consisting chiefly 
of such as contain Knowledge that may hereafter be useful 
to America. 
</p><p>
My Love to Betsey concludes at present from your affecdonate Father B FRANKLIN
P. S. I was this day again at Lord Dartmouth's Levee, 
who show'd me particular Respect in sending for me out 
of the Crowd long before my Turn, and apologizing for having 
kept me so long by Means of Mr. Maseres's detaining him on 
Canada Affairs. He receiv'd my Business too very properly, 
not making any Objection to my acting as Agent for the 
Massachusetts without the Gov " Approbation of my Appointment, as his Predecessor had done. Whether this will continue or not, is now the Question; for as he has the same 
Secretaries, Pownall and Knox, probably they will remind him 
of the late Measures, and prompt him to continue them.

DEAR SIR : I received yours of Aug. 24 by Capt Vanderhorst, to whom I should willingly have shown any Civilities 
in my Power, but I being goutly of late, seldom go into the 
City, and he has not called on me since he delivered your 
Letter. I am sorry you talk of leaving off your Business 
with a View of getting some Post. It is so difficult a matter 
to obtain anything of the kind, that I think to leave a good 
Trade in hopes of an Office, is quitting a Certainty for an 
Uncertainty, and losing Substance for Shadow. I have 
known so many here dangling and soliciting Years for Places, 
till they were reduced to the lowest Poverty and Distress, that 
I cannot but pity a Man who begins to turn his Thoughts 
that way. The Proverb says; He who has a Trade has an Office of Profit and Honour; because he does not hold it 
during any other Man's Pleasure, and it affords him honest 
Subsistence with Independence. I hope, therefore, you will 
alter your mind and go on with your Business. I assure you 
it is not in my Power to procure you that Post you mention 
or any other, whatever my wishes may be for your Prosperity. 
I am now thought here too much an American to have any 
Interest of the kind. You have done me Honour in giving 
a Son my Name. I wish he may live to be an Honour and 
Comfort to you. With my Compliments to Mrs. Timothy, I am ever,

DEAR COUSIN : My sister, to whom I have not now time 
to write, acquainted me in her last letter that there was some 
expectation her daughter would soon be married with her 
consent. 
</p><p>
If that should take place, my request is that you would 
lay out the sum of fifty pounds, lawful money, in bedding or 
such other furniture as my sister shall think proper to be given 
the new-married couple towards housekeeping, with my 
best wishes ; and charge that sum to my account. I can now 
only add that I am ever 
</p><p>
Yours most affectionately, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

SIR, 
</p><p>
Lord Dartmouth, our American minister, came to town 
last week, and held his first levee on Wednesday, when I paid 
my respects to him, acquainting him at the same time, that 
I should in a few days wait upon him, on business from <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a> ; which I have accordingly since done, and have put your 
petition to the King into his Lordship's hands, that being the 
regular course. 
</p><p>
He received me very obligingly, made no objection to my 
acting as agent without an appointment assented to by the 
governor, as his predecessor had done, so that I hope business 
is getting into a better train. I shall use my best endeavours 
in supporting the petition, and write you more fully by the 
next ship to <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. In the mean time I remain with great 
respect, your most obedient and humble servant, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

</p><p>
SIR, 
</p><p>
The above is a Copy of my last. A few Days after my 
leaving your Petition with Lord Dartmouth, his Lordship 
sent for me to discourse with me upon it. After a long 
Audience, he was pleased to say, that, notwithstanding all I 
had said or that could be said, in Support and Justification of 
the Petition, he was sure the presenting it at this time could 
not possibly produce any good: That the King would be 
exceedingly offended, but what Steps his Majesty would take 
upon it was uncertain ; perhaps he would require the Opinion 
of the Judges or Government Lawyers, which would surely 
be against us; perhaps he might lay it before Parliam', 
and so the Censure of both Houses would be drawn down 
upon us. The most favourable thing to be expected was 
a severe Reprimand to the Assembly by Order of his Majesty the natural Consequence of which must be more Discontent and Uneasiness in the Province. That possessed as he 
was with great Good will for New England, he was extreamly 
unwilling, that one of the first Acts of his Administration, 
with regard to the Massachusetts, should be of so unpleasant 
a Nature. That Minds had been heated and irritated on both 
Sides the Water, but he hoped those Heats were now cooling, 
and he was averse to the Addition of fresh Fuel. That as 
I had delivered the Petition to him officially, he must present 
it, if I insisted upon it; but he wished I would first consult 
my Constituents, who might possibly on Reconsideration think 
fit to order its being deferred. 
</p><p>
I answered, that the great Majority with which the Petition 
and the Resolves on which it was founded were carried thro' 
the House, made it scarce expectable, that their Order would 
be countermanded; that the slighting, evading, or refusing 
to receive Petitions from the Colonies, on some late Occasions by the Parliament, had occasioned a total loss of the 
Respect for and Confidence in that Body, formerly subsisting so strongly in America, and brought on a Questioning 
of their Authority: That his Lordship might observe Petitions came no more from thence to Parliament, but to the King only: That the King appeared now to be the only 
Connection between the two Countries; and that as a continued Union was essentially necessary to the Wellbeing of the 
Whole Empire, I should be sorry to see that Link weakened, 
as the other had been : That I thought it a dangerous Thing 
for any Governm' to refuse receiving Petitions, and thereby 
prevent the Subjects from giving vent to their Griefs. 
</p><p>
His L p interrupted me by replying, that he did not refuse 
to deliver the Petition ; that it should never justly be said of 
him, that he interrupted the Complaints of his Majesty's 
Subjects; and that he must and would present it, as he had 
said before, whenever I should absolutely require it; but 
from Motives of pure Good Will to the Province, he wish'd 
me not to insist on it, till I should receive fresh orders. 
</p><p>
Finally, considering that since the Petition was ordered, 
there had been a Change in the American Administration, 
that the present minister was our Friend in the Repeal of the 
Stamp Act, and seems still to have good Dispositions towards 
us; that you had mentioned to me the Probability, that the 
House would have remonstrated on all their other Grievances, 
had not their Time been taken up with the difficult Business 
of a general Valuation ; and since the Complaint of this Petition was likely alone to give Offence, it might perhaps be 
judg'd adviseable to give the Substance of all our Complaints 
at once, rather than in Parts and after a Reprimand received ; 
I say upon the whole I thought it best not to disoblige him in 
the Beginning of his Administration, by refusing him what 
he seem'd so desirous of, a Delay at least in presenting the 
Petition, till farther Directions should be received from my 
Constituents. If after Deliberation they should send me 
fresh Orders, I shall immediately obey them, and the Application to the Crown itself may possibly derive greater Weight 
from the Reconsideration given it, while the Temper of the 
House may be thought somewhat calmed by the Removal 
of a Minister, who had rendred himself so obnoxious to them. 
Accordingly, I consented to the Delay desired, wherein I 
hope my Conduct will not be disapproved. 
</p><p>
With the greatest Esteem and Respect, I have the Honour 
to be, Sir, your and the Committee's most obedient and most 
humble Serv, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

MY DEAR CHILD : I received yours of Oct. 14, and one 
without Date which I suppose to be written since. Capts. 
All, Osborne, and Sparkes are arrived ; and a Barrel of Apples 
with another of Cranberries are come, I know not yet by 
which of them. 
</p><p>
I am glad to hear you continue so well, and that the Pains 
in your Side and Head have left you. Eat light Foods, such 
as Fowls, Mutton, etc., and but little Beef or Bacon, avoid 
strong Tea, and use what Exercise you can ; by these Means 
you will preserve your Health better, and be less subject to 
Lowness of Spirits. 
</p><p>
It seems Polly Pitts is really dead. I suppose you know 
that we have a Mortgage on her Lotts? Mr. Galloway 
took it for me. You do not tell me whether any thing has been done about it ; or whether any Interest was ever paid. 
Nor have you ever told me whether Mr. Maugridge's Executors have paid off his Mortgage to me, and that to the Insurance Office. I wish you would. 
</p><p>
Give my Love to Mrs. Montgomery and all enquiring 
Friends. Mrs. Stevenson and Polly Hewson and Sally 
Franklin present their Love, the latter adds her Duty. She 
is about to be married to a Farmer's Son. I shall miss her, 
as she is nimble-footed and willing to run of Errands and wait 
upon me, and has been very serviceable to me for some 
Years, so that I have not kept a Man. 
</p><p>
I am ever my dear Debby, your affectionate Husband, 
</p><p>
B. F. 
</p><p>
P. S. Have just opened the Apples and Cranberries, 
which I find in good order, all sound. Thanks for your kind 
Care in sending them.

DEAR FRIEND, 
</p><p>
... I am glad you are returned again to a Seat in the 
Assembly, where your Abilities are so useful and necessary 
in the Service of your Country. We must not in the Course 
of Publick Life expect immediate Approbation and immediate 
grateful Acknowledgment of our Services. But let us persevere thro' Abuse and even Injury. The internal Satisfaction 
of a good Conscience is always present, and Time will do us Justice in the Minds of the People, even of those at present 
the most prejudiced against us. 
</p><p>
I have given Dr. Denormandie a Recommendation to a 
Friend in Geneva, for which Place he set out this Morning ; 
and I shall be glad of any Opportunity of serving him when 
he returns to London. I see by the Pens Gazette, of Oct. 21, 
that you are continued Speaker, and myself Agent; but I 
have no Line from you or the Committee relative to Instructions. Perhaps I shall hear from you by Falconer. I find 
myself upon very good Terms with our new Minister, Lord 
Dartmouth, who we have reason to think means well to the 
Colonies. I believe all are now sensible, that nothing is to 
be got by contesting with or oppressing us. 
</p><p>
Two Circumstances have diverted me lately. One was, 
that being at the court of Exchequer on some Business of 
my own, I met there with one of the Commissioners of the 
Stamp Office, who told me he attended with a Memorial 
from that Board, to be allowed in their Accounts the Difference between their Expence in endeavouring to establish 
those Offices in America, and the Amount of what they received, which from Canada and the W. India Islands was but 
about <a href='/results.php?year=1500'>1500</a>^, while the Expence, if I remember right was 
above 2,000 , being for Stamps and Stamping, with Paper 
and Parchment return'd upon their Hands, Freight, &c. 
The other is the present Difficulties of the India Company, 
and of Government on their Ace'. The Comp a have accepted 
Bills, which they find themselves unable to pay, tho' they have 
the Value of Two Millions in Tea and other India Goods in 
their Stores, perishing under a Want of Demand; their 
Credit thus suffering, and their Stock falling 120 p ct . The 
Bank will not advance for them, and no Remedy is thought 
of but lowering their Dividend from 12^ to 6| per Cent, 
whereby Government will lose the 400,000 ; per ann, it 
having been stipulated that it should no longer be paid, if 
the Dividend fell to that Mark. And, altho' it is known, 
that the American Market is lost by continuing the Duty 
on Tea, and that we are supply'd by the Dutch, who doubtless take the Opportunity of Smuggling other India Goods 
among us with the Tea, so that for the 5 Years past we might 
probably have otherwise taken off the greatest Part of what 
the Cornp' have on hand, and so have prevented their present 
Embarrasment, yet the Honour of Government is suppos'd 
to forbid the Repeal of the American Tea Duty; while the 
Amount of all the Duties goes on decreasing, so that the 
Ballance of this Year does not (as I have it from good Authority) exceed 80 , after paying the Collection ; not reckoning the immense Expence of Guarda-Costas, &c. Can an 
American forbear smiling at these Blunders? Tho', in a 
national Light, they are truly deplorable. 
</p><p>
With the sincerest Esteem and inviolable Attachment, 
I am, my dear Friend, ever most affectionately yours, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR FRIEND: I duly received your Favours of Sept. 
22 and Oct. 9, and am glad the Purchase proves acceptable. 
Our Friend Dr. Evans has remitted me the Bill you mention, 
drawn for the Produce of the Silk. It exceeds what I paid, 
and I wait Orders for the Disposition of the Overplus, particularly what I am to pay Wheeler for his Services in the Business. 
</p><p>
I do not at this Distance understand the Politics of your 
last Election, why so many of the Members declin'd the Service, and why yourself and Mr. Fox were omitted (which I 
much regret) while Goddard was voted for by so great a 
Number. Another Year I hope will set all right. The 
People seldom continue long in the wrong, when it is nobody's 
Interest to mislead them. It must be very discouraging 
to our Friend Galloway, to see his long and faithful Services 
repaid with Abuse and Ingratitude; but let him persevere 
in well-doing and all will end well, and to his final Satisfaction. And tho' it may be inconvenient to your private 
Affairs to attend Publick Business, I hope neither you nor 
Mr. Fox will thro' Resentment of the present Slight, decline 
the Service when again called upon by your Country. 
</p><p>
With great and sincere Esteem, I am ever, dear Sir, your affectionate Friend and most obedient Servant, 
</p><p>
B. F.

DEAR Son: I have received yours of Oct. 4, 8, and 13. 
I cannot imagine what became of my Letter of Aug' 3 from 
May Place. It was, however of no great Importance. Mr. Denonnandie is gone this Day to Geneva. I gave him a 
Letter of Recommendation to a Friend there. 
</p><p>
I am persuaded that your Packets were not open'd at the 
Office; for tho' a Secretary of the State has the Power of 
ordering Letters to be opened, I think it is seldom used but 
in times of War, Rebellion, or on some great publick Occasion, and I have heard they have Means of copying the Seal 
so exactly, as that it cannot be discovered that the Letters 
have been look'd into. 
</p><p>
It is plain therefore, that whoever rubb'd your Packets 
open, had not the Use of such Means. And yet as you are 
satisfy'd it was not done on your Side the Water, I suspect 
the Letter-Carrier might be corrupted and the Business done 
between the Office in Lombard Street and my House. When 
a Packet arrives, a special Messenger goes directly from the 
Office with the publick Letters before the Sorting is finished. 
Mine has been sometimes sent by the same Messenger, 
who calPd on me in his Way to Lord H.'s, sometimes in his 
Return, and as he told Mr. Strahan that his Letters to you 
were often return'd to me from America, and yours to him sent 
thro' my Hands to be seen he supposed by me before Delivery ; 
and since his Resignation your Packets do not appear to have 
suffered the least Violation, I fancy the Rubbing them open 
may possibly have been the Ingenuity of Mr. Sec Knox. 
By the List you have sent me I find none of the Papers 
missing. Another Circumstance in favour of this Opinion 
is, that no Letters to me were thus abused but yours and those 
from the Assembly of <a href='/results.php?city=boston' rel='city'>Boston</a>. This I think clears the Person you suspected, and rather fixes the above Conjecture. 
</p><p>
I have not seen your Speech at the Opening of your last 
Session, but I hear it has been commended by the Ministry. 
</p><p>
I return Mr. Foxcroft's Letters as you desire. I make no 
Remarks on the Reports he mentions. I know not who is 
meant by the Hero of your Speech. Nor will I say more at 
present of the Ohio Affair, than that it is not yet quite secure, 
and therefore I still advise Discretion in speaking of it. 
</p><p>
Dr. Price has been so good as to give me his Opinion of 
your Scheme, which I send, hoping it may be of Use; I 
suppose that you have his Book, referred to in the Paper. 
Some Acknowledgment or Thanks should be sent him for 
the Trouble he has taken. 
</p><p>
I continue very well, Thanks to God. On Monday last 
I was chosen into the Council of the Royal Society for the 
4th time. Our Friend Sir John Pringle was elected President, 
which is very agreable to him. 
</p><p>
I shall send you a Tea-Urn by the first Ship. I just now 
hear that the November Packet is arrived, so I stop here till 
I receive the Letters that come by her. [These words are 
crossed out in the record, apparently in the same ink.] 
</p><p>
Just now comes to hand yours of Nov. 3, whereby I find 
mine of Aug. 3 is received. I am glad to learn that you and 
your neighbouring Governors are so sociable. I shall communicate what you write about the Virginia Grants. At 
present I can only add that I am, with Love to Betsey, 
Your ever affectionate Father, 
</p><p>
B. FRANKLIN.

DEAR SIR, 
</p><p>
Last Night I received your Favour of the ig^ per Post, 
which I think is the best Conveyance for our Letters without 
any indirect Address; for I perceive that not only the little 
Piece which I sent on the 14 th Inst. but a long Letter of the 
8 th have miscarried. With the first I only thank'd you for 
the Square of nooo, & made a short Remark of some Imperfection I observ'd in it, and told you I had some where a 
square of 8, with the Diagonals you requir'd, w'' I would send 
you if I could find it. I also mentioned that I deferr'd 
sending the other Pieces you directed, till I should hear from 
you that the first was correct. Nevertheless they went the 
Week following, and I suppose have likewise miscarried. 
I shall write over again the Purport of my Letter of the 8'. b 
& send it with this. And as I pay no Postage here, I would 
request that for the future you would keep a little Ace' of 
what you pay there, and we will divide that Expence between 
us. Only I wish you to let me know how I may make 
my Letters cheapest, i.e. whether Letters are paid for in 
Paris according to their Weight, or according to the Number 
of Pieces of Paper as here.

you will understand better than my English.

I will as you desire send to Mess 6 Dilly & enquire for the 
Amer 11 Transactions. If it is not come there, I shall send you 
another by the first Opportunity. I am sure the President 
of that Society can have but one Objection to your translating their Book, which is, an Apprehension that the Sale of 
it will not pay for the Trouble & Expence of printing; 
and the Society must esteem it great Honour to them to 
enroll you among their foreign Members. 
</p><p>
I have not the least Objection to your making what Notes 
you please in the Translation. I only wish I could have the 
Advantage of seeing them before my new Edition is printed 
in English.
