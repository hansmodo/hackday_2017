PREFACE. 



Very few of the personal letters of John C. Calhoun have 
heretofore been printed. This fact, keenly appreciated already 
by historical students, will become strikingly evident to any- 
one who will examine the list of his published letters printed 
on a later page of this volume. That list, cursorily examined, 
seems long. Yet if we set aside those communications which 
are printed in the American State Papers and other Govern- 
ment books communications which are letters in form, but 
official documents in their real character those which, like 
replies to committees of citizens or the celebrated letter of 
August 28, 1832, to Governor Hamilton, were in effect 
addressed to the public, and the semipublic correspondence of 
1830, respecting the Seminole war, we find that of Calhoun's 
private and personal letters hardly more than twenty have 
ever been printed, and nearly all of these were printed only a 
few months ago in a periodical of limited circulation. Accord- 
ingly the public career of Calhoun has been known only from 
the speeches and other papers in his published Works, from 
the American State Papers, and from the records of Congress. 
Calhoun the man, apart from his public career, has remained 
virtually unknown. 

It is evident to anyone who appreciates the greatness of 
Calhoun, the large space which he occupied in the public 
thought of his time, and the importance of his career in its 
relation to American political history that we have here a 
great gap in our historical record. Clay, and Webster, and 
Tyler, and John Quincy Adams we know. Monroe's writings 
are being made accessible. Benton has not omitted to record 
himself. Even of Jackson, though little of his correspond- 
ence has been made public, an intimate personal narrative has 
been skillfully constructed. Moreover, the void is in an excep- 
tionally important portion of our annals the political history

of the South during the first half of the century now closing 
a history for which large collections of documentary material 
are conspicuously lacking. Under these circumstances it was 
inevitable that the Historical Manuscripts Commission, estab- 
lished by the American Historical Association, should, from 
their first appointment in 1895, have looked upon an edition 
of the correspondence of John C. Calhoun as one of the tasks 
which, if it were possible, most imperatively called for their 
attention. Fortunately it has proved to be possible, and the 
result is laid before the American Historical Association and 
the public as the Fourth Annual Report of the Historical Manu- 
scripts Commission. 

The thought of such an edition was first awakened in the 
mind of the editor, then a teacher in the Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity, by a passage in Von Hoist's Calhoun, read soon after 
its publication in 1883. In 1888 he had some correspondence 
with Calhoun's son-in-law, Col. Thomas G. Clemson, of Fort 
Hill, S. C. , who then possessed the main mass of the extant 
correspondence, and who courteously invited him to make use 
of it. Soon after this Colonel Clemson died, leaving these 
papers to the Clemson Agricultural College, the present occu- 
pant of the estate at Fort Hill. To the trustees of that insti- 
tution, and especially to Senator Benjamin R. Tillman, the 
editor and the reader are more largely indebted than to any- 
one else. They not only gave generous permission to use 
freely for the purposes of this edition the valuable materials 
in their possession, but sent the whole mass to Providence, 
where, stored in a fireproof library, it might be used at the 
editor's convenience. 

The collection so kindly placed at his disposal embraced 
about 430 letters written by Calhoun, a certain amount of mis- 
cellaneous manuscript, and about 2,300 letters written to him. 
To the latter class of letters few additions have been obtain- 
able; but so much effort has been made to secure additional 
letters written by Calhoun, and with so much success, that this 
portion of the Clemson College collection has become the 
nucleus of a mass of about 800 letters, illustrating all periods 
of Calhoun's career in all aspects of his life. His letters pre- 
served at Clemson College were, in the main, those written to 
his wife and her mother, to his daughter and her husband, 
Colonel Clemson, and to two intimate cousins and brothers-

in-law, John Ewing Calhoun and Jame.s Edward Calhoun. 
Though several of these relatives had an interest in and a 
capacity for politics, which caused Calhoun to write freely to 
them concerning public affairs, it was felt that an editor ought 
also to secure as many as possible of the letters which Calhoun 
wrote to political associates and supporters. It is believed 
that the endeavor to secure such materials has been carried out 
with a thoroughness quite unusual in such cases, and that, by 
reason of the extreme kindness of the possessors, who have 
responded with the most gratifying liberality, comparatively 
few such letters that are extant and valuable have escaped. 
Inquiries were systematically addressed to all known descend- 
ants of Calhoun or of his immediate relatives, to the descend- 
ants of his leading correspondents and his chief associates in 
public life, to the public archives of the Federal Government 
and of the Southern States, to those public libraries and 
historical societies most likely to have any of his letters, to 
the leading autograph collectors and dealers throughout the 
country, and to many prominent citizens of South Carolina. 
A circular was also sent to all the newspapers published in 
that State, and their aid was considerable. 

Among those to whom editor and reader are indebted for 
additional letters, the first place unquestionably belongs to 
Miss Margaret M. Calhoun, of Wallace, Ga. , and her brother, 
Mr. Patrick Calhoun, of Cleveland, Ohio, who placed at the 
editor's disposal the interesting series of letters from their 
grandfather to their father, Col. Andrew Pickens Calhoun, his 
eldest son. The Hon. John Hay, Secretary of State, kindly 
permitted an examination of the archives of his Department 
and the copying of those letters, not already printed, which 
Calhoun wrote as the head of that Department. The Hon. 
Elihu Root, Secretary of War, gave a similar permission. 
Copies of Calhoun's letters to Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, 
preserved among the papers of those statesmen in the Bureau 
of Rolls and Library of the State Department, were supplied 
by Mr. Stanislaus M. Hamilton, to whose unwearied kindness 
so many historical students are indebted. Mr. Edward Spann 
Hammond, of Blackville, S. C. , contributed the highly impor- 
tant series of Calhoun's letters to his father, Governor and 
Senator James H. Hammond, and also the copies which the 
latter kept of his extremely interesting replies. Mr. Robert 



14 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

P. Maynard, of Tacoma, Wash., sent a series, hardly less 
interesting, of letters to and from Gen. Duff Green. A group 
of letters to Maj. Christopher Van Deventer, chief clerk of 
the War Department under Calhoun, and ever afterwards a 
prominent political supporter, was furnished by his son, Col. 
J. Van Deventer, of Knoxville, Tenn. ; a group addressed to 
Maj. Armistead Burt, M. C., of South Carolina, who married 
Calhoun's niece, by Mr. J. Towne Robertson, jr., of Abbeville. 
Mr. Wilberforce Eames, librarian of the Lenox Library, and 
Mr. Gregory B. Keen, librarian of the Historical Society of 
Pennsylvania, responded generously to requests for copies of 
the letters possessed by those institutions. Dr. Herbert 
Friedenwald, an associate in this commission, obligingly per- 
formed the laborious search of the files of the Departments of 
State and War. The most cordial acknowledgments are also 
due, for letters printed in the following collection, to Mrs. 
J. E. Bacon, of Columbia, S. C., who lent the remaining 
letters of Calhoun to Governor Francis W. Pickens; to Mrs. 
J. F. Calhoun; to Col. William P. Calhoun, of Edgefield; to 
Mr. William M. Meigs, of Philadelphia; to Mrs. Francis 
Wharton, of Washington; to Miss Elizabeth Pickens Cun- 
ningham, of Asheville, N. C. ; to Mr. Charles Francis Adams; 
to Dr. Lester G. Bugbee, of the University of Texas; to Mrs. 
J. S. H. Fogg, of Boston ; to Messrs. Simon Gratz and Charles 
Roberts, of Philadelphia;* to Mr. Mendes Cohen, of Baltimore; 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry, of Washington; Mr. Yates Snowden, 
of Charleston; Mr. F. E. Shoup, of Columbia, Tenn.; Miss 
Mary T. Hunter, of Lloyds, Va. ; Mr. Hugh Calhoun Middle- 
ton, of Augusta, Ga. ; Mrs. M. E. Wilcox, of Washington; 
Mr. Charles P. Greenough, of Brookline, Mass. ; Mr. Fred M. 
Steele, of Chicago; Rev. S. T. Martin, of Dublin, Va.; Mr. 
P. H. Hill, of Nashville, Tenn. ; Dr. U." B. Phillips, of the 
University of Georgia, and Mrs. M. A. L. Compton, of 
Athens, Ga. It is not easy to express adequately the editor's 
sense of the kindness with which his requests for the loan of 
valuable letters have been met by so many persons, to most 
of whom he was entirely a stranger. Acknowledgments not 
less grateful are made to the many persons who have sent 
letters or copies of letters, which have not been used, or 
who have obligingly, but without result, made searches,

sometimes more laborious than he likes to think of, for the 
editor's benefit. 

Something like 800 letters of Calhoun, it has been remarked, 
were gathered together by these means. Of these somewhat 
more than 500 are printed in the present volume. In general, 
letters heretofore printed have been omitted, with the excep- 
tion of seven or eight which seemed to be of such interest or 
importance that the collection would be incomplete without 
them. Many have been omitted as having no historical 
importance letters concerning the official routine of the Wai- 
Department (of which an abundant number are given already 
in the American State Papers) or concerning private business 
or the details of agriculture. Yet it is not to be forgotten 
that agriculture was a favorite interest of Calhoun, as of most 
other Southern statesmen, and enough of the agricultural por- 
tion of his correspondence has been included to exhibit this 
aspect of his character and life. Many family letters, in which 
the public has or should have no interest, have been left out. 
But on the other hand the editor has felt that. Calhoun being 
to many readers a mere abstraction, a purely political eidolon, 
it was an important part of his task to let Calhoun, the man, 
reveal himself. He has therefore included enough of the 
private family letters, without, he hopes, violating the sancti- 
ties of domestic life, to exhibit Calhoun as a human being and 
a member of a family, to show his constant devotion to his 
wife and her mother, his strong affection for his children, his 
anxious care for their well-being and improvement, his abid- 
ing interest in all kinsmen. As to his relations to his slaves, 
the reader may rest assured that he has the evidence in the 
same form and proportion in which it presented itself to the 
editor in the total mass of the correspondence. There has been 
no effort to suppress anything; indeed, there was nothing to 
suppress nothing but the ordinary and inevitable incidents of 
the system of slavery. The one or two letters now printed in 
which reference is made to the punishment of slaves or to the 
pursuit of fugitives are, according to present recollection, 
the only ones the editor has seen. Finally, it should be 
remarked that, not without reason, letters of a personal sort 
have been included in greater abundance for Calhoun's earlier 
years than for later times, for such letters are of special

interest when they come from formative years and help to 
show the early development of personal traits. 

Not all letters have been printed entire. It is recognized 
that there are advantages in completeness of text. Some 
readers are ready to suspect that the omissions have been 
made for ulterior purposes patriotism or partiality, hero 
worship or conventional decorum. They may be assured that 
nothing of the sort has happened in the present case. But 
often it has happened that a long letter, chiefly occupied with 
agriculture or with private business having no interest to the 
present world, has had, at the end or elsewhere, a paragraph 
of political history that seemed worth preserving. Nearly 
all the cases of omission are of this sort. The trustees of 
Clemson College enjoined th'e editor to print no passages that 
would give pain to the living. But there are few such pas- 
sages. Calhoun was neither gossippy nor spiteful, nor was he 
a man of active personal animosities, for his politics revolved 
around principles rather than personalities. As for merely 
political conflicts, there has seemed to be no reason to sup- 
press their evidences; the fights of sixty years ago are ancient 
history now. No passages have been omitted in order to sup- 
port or to weaken any particular opinions in politics or his- 
tory. Nor has a single word been omitted for the supposed 
benefit of Calhoun's reputation. Indeed, it might be said of 
him, as of very few public men, that he had nothing to fear 
from the posthumous publication of his papers. Whatever 
omissions have been made on the other grounds explained 
above are indicated by dots, except in the case of some 
insignificant postscripts. The subscriptions, signatures, and 
addresses have also been omitted, for there was nothing 
characteristic about them (plain "Yours truly," or "Yours 
sincerely," being the usual subscription), and they took up 
space. 

As for the texts of the letters, it is not supposed that they are 
all perfect, for Calhoun's handwriting is often very difficult to 
read. But unusual pains have been taken to secure accuracy. 
The letters, copied by typewriter, have been compared with 
the originals, word for word, by an assistant having a compe- 
tent knowledge of American political history. The editor has 
repeated the process with minute care in the case of a large 
share of the letters, and has verified it to a considerable extent

in each of the others. Where the text here printed is derived 
not from the original letter, but from a copy, the fact is stated 
in a footnote. Much the greater number of letters, it will be 
seen, have been printed from the originals. 

The intention has been to print every sentence verbatim et 
literatim as Calhoun wrote it. Some may object to this Chi- 
nese fidelity, which preserves a writer's casual errors of spell- 
ing more faithfully than he would himself have preserved 
them; but on the whole American editing needs to err on 
this side. In general, Calhoun spelled well, though he seems 
to have invariably written spirit u sperit,"and presumably so 
pronounced the word. His use of capitals presents one curious 
puzzle. The reader with theories would feel sure that Calhoun 
would always spell " State" with a capital initial. In reality, 
it is impossible to say whether he did so or not. His large 
"S" and his small "s" are usually identical in form, differing 
only in size. Now, the letter with which he begins the word 
"State" seems usually to be something between the two. At 
till events, it is not uniformly either one or the other, even in 
the same letter, and the reader will find a corresponding want 
of uniformity in the print. Though the editing has attempted 
to be rigid in spelling and capitals, in punctuation a little lati- 
tude has been allowed, when to preserve an eccentric punctua- 
tion of the original would make the sense obscure. The initials 
"c. c." in the heading of a letter are used to indicate that it 
forms a part of the Clemson College collection; "p. AND M. c." 
to indicate that it was lent by Mr. Patrick Calhoun and Miss 
Margaret Calhoun. In other cases the sources are acknowl- 
edged in footnotes. 

Besides the letters of Calhoun, nearly 200 of the letters writ- 
ten to him are herewith presented. Though the 2,300 letters 
to Calhoun embraced in the Clemson College collection belong 
nearly all to the decade 1840-1850, yet within those limits 
they illustrate the history of the South and of the Federal Gov- 
ernment in a most interesting manner. Their variety is great, 
for they come from nearly 900 different writers, representing 
all classes of Southern society, and from many Northerners. 
The selection from among them, a somewhat difficult matter, 
has been carefully conducted with a view to illustrating from 
as various points of view as possible the career of Calhoun and

the history of the South and the Union during his time, so far 
as really important and characteristic letters cover these top- 
ics. It is interesting to see how uniform an opinion of Cal- 
houn on the part of his supporters these letters reveal. No one 
expects anything of him but the most high-minded political con- 
duct; and in this respect, also, the letters that are not printed, 
though many of them are from office seekers and second-rate 
politicians, tell the same story as those that are printed. 

A few letters to Calhoun have been derived from other 
sources than Clemson College. Especially noteworthy among 
these are the letters of Governor Hammond and Gen. Duff 
Green, already mentioned. In respect to omissions and accu- 
racy of text, the same principles have been followed as in the 
case of the letters written by Calhoun himself. 

It is hoped that the arrangement of the material will explain 
and commend itself. A chronology of the events of Calhoun's 
life, kindly contributed by Prof. James Q. Dealey, of Brown 
University, has for convenience been prefixed. This is fol- 
lowed by lists of Calhoun's letters heretofore printed, of his 
letters now printed, and of the letters addressed to him which 
are included in the present collection. Between these lists 
and the main body of the text is inserted a sketch of his early 
life, written by Col. William Pinkney Starke, which the editor 
deems well worthy of permanent preservation. Colonel Starke, 
a native of the Calhoun region in South Carolina, and an 
intelligent man, resided for some time at Fort Hill with Colonel 
Clemson, engaged, at the latter's instance, in preparing a 
biography of Calhoun from the papers left by him. The life 
was written in an early form of shorthand, but Senator Till- 
man has caused it to be transcribed. It proves to be a valu- 
able record, written from the letters and from materials of 
neighborhood tradition, of the life of Calhoun from his birth 
(indeed from the origin of the Calhouns in Scotland) to his 
entrance into Congress in November, 1811. At that point 
Colonel Starke deemed it indispensable to pause and discuss 
with thoroughness the Constitution of the United States and 
he wrote no more. The fragment which he left, composed 
with old-fashioned leisureliness, has been compressed, without 
real injury, though without specific indication of omissions, 
into dimensions suitable to the present volume, to which it 
forms a fitting introduction. 



PREFACE. 19 

As for the annotations of the letters, though they might 
have been made much more extensive, the number of notes 
;ictualh T needed in order to make the text intelligible is small. 
These the editor has tried to supply; beyond this minimum 
he has not chosen to go. 

With this preface the editor takes leave of the correspond- 
ence of John C. Calhoun and of the duties, four years pursued, 
of the Historical Manuscripts Commission. His modest task 
has been to provide materials with which others may elaborate 
the fabric of American political history or the biography of 
Calhoun. He is content with the belief that what he has tried 
to do may make a portion of that fabric more solid and sub- 
stantial and with the thought of having made better known to 
American readers to the readers of documents, at least, a 
small but potent audience the character and the career of one 
of the greatest and most elevated of American statesmen. The 
day on which this preface is concluded is exactly fifty years 
from that on which Calhoun died. One can not fail to be 
impressed with the contrast between the political situation 
upon which his dying eyes rested, an anxious and discordant 
people, a Union apparently crumbling, and that which is pre- 
sented before us at the present day, a Union of matchless 
solidity and strength, "the ensign of the Republic still full 
high advanced," the nation proceeding with buoyant optimism 
to new tasks and to an inspiring future. But surely not the 
least happy element in the contrast is that growth of fraternal 
feeling, of generous judgment, and of historic breadth of view, 
which enables all alike to do justice to the memory of a great 
and noble statesman who, whether his opinions be ours or not, 
is seen to have spent a long and laborious life in the consci- 
entious service of our common country.

covered before have been found. The list makes no attempt to 
discriminate between public and private letters, but includes

ACCOUNT OF CALHOUN'S EARLY LIFE, ABRIDGED FROM THE 
MANUSCRIPT OF COL. W. PINKNEY STARKE. 



Among the emigrants from Scotland to North Ireland who 
crossed the channel early in the eighteenth century was a 
family of Colquhouns and another of Caldwells. The Gaelic 
clan Colquhoun is said to have been very respectable in 
numbers. The Caldwells were Lowlanders from the Frith 
of Solway. The Calhouns, as we shall henceforth call them, 
settled near Donegal in the northwestern part of the island, 
in which country Patrick Calhoun, the father of John Cald- 
well Calhoun, was born in 1723. In the years 1727-28-29 the 
north of Ireland suffered from drought. Owing to a succession 
of bad crops a number of the discontented and impoverished 
Scotch settlers concluded to leave Ireland, nor were they alto- 
gether satisfied with the religious situation. Four thousand 
emigrants to America left Ireland in one season. In the year 
1733 a family of Calhouns emigrated to America. One of 
the three brothers was James Calhoun, who with Catherine, 
his wife, and four sons, James, William, Patrick, and Ezekiel, 
had resided in Donegal. They landed in New" York, but soon 
removed to the western part of Pennsylvania, where they set- 
tled not far from the Potomac River. The boundary line of 
the French possessions at that time traversed a part of Penn- 
sylvania. The French and English had commenced quarreling 
and were preparing to settle their dispute with the sword. 
Fort Du Quesne, now Pittsburg, was constructed, and the 
Indians along the Ohio began to show signs of hostility. 
The Calhouns had hoped to find rest in the wilderness where 
they had dwelt for several years, but were forced to seek a 
place of greater safety beyond the Potomac. They crossed 
over into Virginia and never paused till after following the 
base of the mountain for more than 200 miles they established 
themselves in what is now Wy the County, in the southwestern

part of the State. There they purchased lands lying upon 
Crab and Reed creeks, where they lived for a few years. 1 
The defeat of Braddock exposed the entire western frontier 
of Virginia to irruption by the Indians. Patrick Calhoun 
during his residence in Virginia married his first wife, who 
soon died without issue. Some years before the migration of 
the Calhouns from Pennsylvania his only sister, Rebecca, was 
born. Patrick Calhoun, owing to an injury in childhood, had 
enjoyed only six months' schooling in Ireland, and as there 
were no schools to be found in the Pennsylvania wilderness 
this was all the scholastic education he ever enjoyed. In time 
he became qualified for the profession of land surveying, a 
business followed in his youth by Washington, whose early 
advantages for obtaining a literary education were not much 
greater than Patrick Calhoun's. In the year 1755 Patrick Cal- 
houn went to the Waxhaw settlement in South Carolina. The 
Cald wells, who left Ireland about the same time as the Cal- 
houns, had drifted along down into Carolina and were living 
in the Waxhaw settlement. Patrick became acquainted with 
the family and perhaps dandled on his knee a 5-year-old dam- 
sel, the future mother of John Caldwell Calhoun. He received 
from the Caldwells and others such accounts of the fertility 
of the lands lying beyond the Catawba River that he induced 
his family to emigrate to the new country. 

Although but one hundred and thirty years have elapsed 
since the Calhouns crossed the Catawba the changes have been 
so great that we find it difficult to believe that railways run 
along the tracks of what were then Indian trails. The Cal- 
houns worked their way along wagon roads and foot trails till 
the compass was perhaps their only guide. No doubt they 
often heard the crack of the Indian rifle, for at that time the 
Charleston market called for an annual supply of 200,000 
buckskins for British vests and smallclothes. 

The northwestern part of the colony was then known as the 
DistricCof Ninety-six, so called from a station on an Indian 
trail lying at that number of miles from Fort George. No 
part of North America was at that time more abundantly sup- 
plied with game than the region now called Abbeville County, 
a region bounded on the west by the Savannah and intersected 

1 See Calhoun's letter of September 15, 1846, post. 



SKETCH OF CALHOUN. 67 

by several considerable streams. The Calhouns must have 
passed near the spot upon which the town of Abbeville now 
stands. At that time the Indian line ran a few miles to the 
\vest of it. They crossed the Long Cane Creek and proceeded 
as far as Little River. At length, near the latter stream, 
they found a region so inviting that they determined to locate 
a site for a settlement. This was on a small stream running 
into Little River, and at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from it. 
The surrounding country was mostly a prairie of rich black 
loam, just sufficiently undulating for drainage, covered with 
cane and wild-pea vines, and probably not thickly timbered. 

It was in the year 1756 that the Calhoun family, consisting 
of the aged and widowed mother, Catherine, and her sons, 
James, William, Patrick, and Ezekiel, with their families, 
removed to the colony of South Carolina. They were accom- 
panied by two or three families who had been persuaded to 
join them. At the time of their arrival there were only three 
or four families of settlers within easy reach. Having secured 
homesteads the Calhouns again commenced a pioneer life. 
Upon the right bank of the little stream running westwardly 
into Little River, Patrick Calhoun erected his dwelling. It 
took the name of Calhoun Creek. 

Mr. Patrick Calhoun, who was in the thirty-fourth year of 
his age at the time of his arrival in Carolina, took at once the 
position of a leader in the new settlement. He was in no long 
time appointed by the colonial governor a captain of rangers, 
and, as we shall see, did much by his courage and counsel to 
insure the safety and contribute to the advancement of the 
back settlements. 

War soon broke out with the Indians. A party, of which 
Patrick Calhoun was one, when removing their wives and 
children and most valuable effects to Augusta for safety were 
attacked by the Cherokees on the 1st of February, 1760, and 
some 50 persons, men, women, and children were slain. After 
the massacre many children were found wandering in the 
woods. One man discovered and brought back nine of these 
fugitives. Two little daughters of William, the brother of 
Patrick Calhoun, were carried into captivity. The elder of 
them, after some years, was rescued; the other never was heard 
of. Among the slain was the old Scotch woman Catherine 
Calhoun, the mother of the family of Calhouns. A curious

stone, engraved by a native artist, marks the spot where she 
fell among her children and neighbors. When Patrick Cal- 
houn and others returned to bury the dead three days after- 
wards, he discovered his niece Rebecca, who had concealed 
herself in the canebrake. She afterwards became the wife of 
Gen. Andrew Pickens, and was the grandmother of Governor 
Francis W. Pickens, of Fort Sumter memory. The graves at 
Long Cane marking the site of this massacre are still to be 
seen. 

The war between the French and the English came to an 
end in 1763, and in the following year the Cherokees gave up 
the struggle. The settlers returned to their homes and soon 
the tide of population set in with renewed force, mainly from 
Virginia and Pennsylvania, towards the northern and western 
sections of the colony. In 1766 the first migratory movement 
was made from the seacoast, in which year a considerable 
number of French Protestant families came up and settled in 
the Calhoun neighborhood. Much of that peculiar tone of 
manners distinguishing the South Carolinians in the early days 
of the Republic was due to the admixture of this French 
element in our population. John C. Calhoun grew up not 
without receiving some benefit from the association that gave 
a certain polish to his manners. 

In the Revolution the Calhouns and Caldwells early took a 
decided stand on the Whig side. The war came to an end in 
South Carolina in 1781, and Mr. Patrick Calhoun was living 
in quiet on his plantation on Calhoun Creek near Little River 
when his third son was born, March 18, 1782. The massacre 
of John Caldwell in the previous year was fresh in the memory 
of the Calhouns, and they gave to the infant the name of his 
murdered uncle. The Calhoun domicile, situated on ground 
slightly rising on the northern side of the creek, was the first 
framed house in the neighborhood. It was two stories high, 
and, as I can remember (I have been to it and slept in it repeat- 
edly in early childhood) had four rooms on each story. "Mr. 
Calhoun, in his childhood," said Senator Butler in his eulogy, 
"had but limited advantages of what is termed a literary 
tuition. His parents lived in a newly settled country and 
among a sparse population. This population had but a slight 
connection with the lower country of South Carolina, and 
were sustained by emigrants from Pennsylvania and Virginia. 



SKETCH OF CALHOUN. 69 

There was, of course, but limited means of instruction to 
children. They imbibed most of their lessons from the con- 
versation of their parents. Mr. Calhoun has always expressed 
himself deeply sensible of that influence." 

A hundred years ago there were very few schools in the 
upper country of South Carolina. Occasionally an u old 
field school" was opened for a few months by some itinerant 
schoolmaster capable of instructing children in the rudiments 
of learning. The writer is old enough to remember such a 
school in the same Calhoun neighborhood, a log hut with rude 
appliances. In the year 1794 there was a schoolhouse exist- 
ing at Brewer's, half way between Mr. Calhoun's and Little 
River, and a tradition existed that John Caldwell went to 
school there for a few months when quite young. With this 
possible exception and also excepting three months of school- 
ing in Georgia in his fourteenth year, Mr. Calhoun's scholastic 
education commenced when he was more than 18 years of age. 

Wherever in the back woods of South Carolina lived a true 
mother, herselt a woman of any culture, there was to be found 
the best teacher. Of the tall stately Caldwell mother of John 
C. Calhoun little has come down to us. To her descendants 
she left the memory of many virtues. One of her husband's 
family, now a man not far from a hundred years of age, has 
seen her. "She was a great manager," he told the writer, 
"and that is something. She taught her son John how to 
administer the affairs of a plantation." 1 We have abundant 
proof of the deep impression made by his mother upon the 
heart of John Caldwell. 

Not many books were to be had in those days, few news- 
papers, no dime novels. A book was a costly and precious 
article in the backwoods, not to be procured without difficulty, 
and accordingly very much valued. Charleston was then the 
richest city on the continent, and Patrick Calhoun, as a mem- 
ber of the legislature, was accustomed to perform his annual 
journey thither on horseback. We may believe that he 
brought back from the city, in his leathern saddle-bags, a 
book for his children, especially for John, who took to read- 

1 Note by Colonel Starke: Having spent the first ten years of my life in the same neigh- 
borhood, having often slept in the old Patrick Calhoun mansion, and being myself of 
the same Scotch Presbyterian stock, I can appreciate the tenor and force of the environ- 
ing influences in Mr. Calhoun's early life. 



AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ing from early boyhood. He acquired much from the conver- 
sation of his parents, of whose influence, as Mr. Butler says, 
he always expressed himself as being sensible. Numerous 
stories of the Indian wars were related by the old Scotch- 
Irishman stories of Tory barbarities, stories of British 
atrocities. John was only 6 years of age when the question of 
the adoption of the new Federal Constitution came before the 
people of South Carolina. Patrick Calhoun opposed its rati- 
fication in common with almost the entire up-country. But 
the power lay with the parishes, and the State adopted it. 
The first glimpse we have of John Caldwell is in his tenth 
year. "We have heard him say," remarks Mr. Hunter, " that 
amongst his earliest recollections was one of a conversation 
when he was 9 years of age, in which his father maintained 
that government to be the best which allowed the largest 
amount of individual liberty compatible with social order and 
tranquillity, and insisted that the improvements in political 
science would be found to consist in throwing off many of the 
restraints then imposed by law and deemed necessary to an 
organized society." The boy is set a-thinking. Brought into 
the world for a purpose of no mean significance, and there- 
fore gifted with natural endowments of no common order, 
the impression made upon his memory by his father's remark 
shows that his mind was ready to manifest its bent, or perhaps 
to receive an impulse giving it direction. 

In 1794: we obtain our first visible glimpse of John Cald- 
well. In Dr. Howe's admirable history of Presbyter ianism 
in South Carolina we have a biographical sketch of the Rev. 
Moses Waddell, the most celebrated of Southern schoolmasters. 
"In the year 1794," says the learned Howe, u an appointment 
had been made for a new preacher at a schoolhouse near 
Brewer's, a few miles from Hopewell Church, and just half- 
way between the waters of Calhoun's Creek and Little River. 
It was a week day, but a considerable audience had been as- 
sembled, for some indefinite and fleeting rumor had excited 
the curiosity of the Scotch-Irish colonists. At the close of the 
service the people crowded around the preacher, and a con- 
test which bade fair to be scarcely amicable arose as to the 
privilege of entertaining this wonderful young stranger. This 
point was at length conceded out of sheer respect, and he went 
with Mr. Patrick Calhoun, the patriarch of the flock. We 



SKETCH OF CALHOUN. 71 

have often heard him describe, with the pleasant garrulity, of 
ai'e, this first visit to the Calhoun settlement, that evening's 
hospitable entertainment around the wide, old-fashioned chim- 
ney, the sire in one corner, the fair old matron in the other, 
and beside her an interesting daughter. 

"After some time a door was opened, and a youthful head, 
with very disheveled locks and strong features, peeped in, 
but was instantly withdrawn. That strong-featured lad of 12 
years, with disheveled head, was John C. Calhoun. The 
young minister was Moses Waddell, of whom we shall have 
more to say hereafter." 

To continue this relation, given by a venerable lady, one of 
the audience that had listened to Mr. Waddell at Brewer's 
schoolhouse, "on retiring to rest that night the young 
preacher dreamed of that beautiful girl, who had sat near her 
mother, no doubt admiring the young stranger." Mr. Wad- 
dell often alluded to a dream he had that night. He dreamed 
that he married the young maiden, and that she died soon 
after marriage. Though there was nothing remarkable in 
the dream, there was something strange in the sequel, for in 
little more than a year it was literally fulfilled. 

Mr. Patrick Calhoun's house was constructed of such dur- 
able materials as to last for nearly a hundred years. It was 
destroyed by fire a few years ago, and only two chimneys 
remain to mark the spot. The sitting room was to the left 
hand on entering the house, and the curious traveler may 
still notice the wide fireplace before which, on that winter's 
evening nearly a century ago, sat the little party above 
described. That young clergyman, in the time to come, was 
destined to number among his 4,000 pupils two candidates for 
the Presidency in 1823, Crawford and Calhoun, besides many 
others, hardly less distinguished, scattered throughout the 
entire South. 

On returning from his legislative duties in Charleston Pat- 
rick Calhoun brought home on horseback behind him a young 
African, freshly imported in some English or New England 
vessel. The children in the neighborhood, and perhaps many 
of the adults, had never before seen a black man. Mr. Cal- 
houn gave him the name of Adam, and in good time got a 
wife for him. At the time of John Caldwell's birth, Adam 



72 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

had a family coming on, one of whom, named Sawney, was a 
playmate for Mr. Calhoun's bo}^s. 

Patrick Calhoun at the time of Mr. Waddell's visit was more 
than 70 years of age. In 1791 he had been elected a judge of 
the county court of Abbeville, and in the year following the 
legislature selected him as one of the commissioners for run- 
ning the line between Abbeville and Edgefield. At the session 
in December, 1795, a resolution was passed ordering the State 
treasurer to pay Patrick Calhoun for his services as commis T - 
sioner in running that boundary line. This is the last thing 
recorded of the old pioneer and patriarch of Abbeville. 

The Rev. Moses Waddell, having married Catherine Cal- 
houn, took her over to his home in Columbia County, Ga., 
where he had opened a country school. John Caldwell's 
parents determined to send John to his brother-in-law's acad- 
emy. Accordingly, in the winter of 1795 the boy, now in his 
thirteenth year, for the first time in his life had an oppor- 
tunity to receive the benefit of a good school. But as if the 
fates had ordained it otherwise, his father died on the 15th of 
January, and his sister, Mrs. Waddell, almost immediately 
afterwards. The afflicted widow about the same time received 
news from Mr. Waddell that made her fear for the health of 
her son. A letter from her son-in-law had informed her that 
John's devotion to books was such as to affect his health, 
whereupon she sent for him. As it happened, he had not been 
going to school at all, for at that period Mr. Waddell's clerical 
duties occupied so much of his attention that he was absent 
during the greater part of the time. 

His brother-in-law was the librarian of a circulating library, 
to which John Caldwell, of course, had free access, as the 
books were in Mr. Waddell's house. In our age of cheap 
literature it is not easy to appreciate the eager delight of this 
vigorous young intellect at the sight of these volumes. Books 
were precious things to him. The first book he opened was 
Rollin's Ancient History. Robertson's History of America 
and Life of Charles V and Voltaire's Charles XII gave him 
an insight into the history of times when the first great 
evolution of modern European thought was taking place- 
There was no "light literature" to be found in a library 
with which Moses Waddell had anything to do. 






SKETCH OF CALHOUN. 73 



In the course of his researches the lad of 13, having fin- 
ished Rollings History, took up Locke's Essay on the Human 
Understanding. The boy grappled with Locke's philosophy 
of the mind, and with such unremitting ardor did he devote 
his energies to the exploration of this new world that by the 
time he had reached the chapter on Infinity his health was 
seriously affected. His considerate brother-in-law, who was 
absent from home on his clerical duties most of the time, saw 
the necessity of taking the boy from his books. His mother, 
alarmed by reports concerning the state of her son's health, 
sent for him, brought him home, and put him to the plow. 
What we absorb with delight is fixed in the memory for 
future use. When the young Calhoun returned to his 
mother's plantation, he brought home an accumulation of 
facts to be slowly digested into mental substance during the 
coming years. His mother was a woman of culture for the 
time, and John had brought home an amazing collection of 
stories. Who is so good a listener as a mother? 

It was a time of great men and stirring events and when 
men rose by merit. It is the mother that rouses emulation 
and inspires the desire to excel. In the sketches of Calhoun's 
life we are told that on his return from Georgia he devoted 
himself to field sports and fishing for a few years, to the great 
improvement of his health. The country abounded with 
game, the streams swarmed with fish, and John Caldwell no 
doubt angled and shot, and, from his active, energetic tem- 
perament, we are inclined to believe that he angled and shot 
with skill. 

Among the ill effects of slavery upon the whites not the 
least was the sense of degradation of manual labor. But 
Patrick Calhoun had not attained to the development of such 
a sense, and I have often seen his grandsons behind the plow. 

Mr. Patrick Calhoun, though living in comfort and possess- 
ing abundance, was far from being rich. No; John Caldwell 
did not do much loitering in the woods or along the banks of 
Little River. Sawney told a different tale. This son of Adam 
lived to a great age, and spent the last twenty years of his 
simple life in comfort and indolence. He had been the espe- 
cial-playmate of John in childhood. From the reflected great- 
ness of his former playfellow, Sawney in his old age found 



74 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

himself famous. It was his delight to entertain all inquirers 
with accounts of John Caldwell's career. They had hunted 
and fished together. "We worked in the field," said Sawney, 
"and many's the times in the brilin' sun me and Mars John 
has plowed together." 

The overseer was a later introduction, the natural result of 
wealth, luxury, and indolence, and whatever was most harsh 
in the institution of slavery was due to the rise of this middle- 
man. 

William and James, brothers of John, were young men at 
the time of his return from W r addell's, or old enough to engage 
in other pursuits. The managing mother, a canny Scotch- 
woman, soon sent off one to Charleston and the other to 
Augusta, where they obtained employment as clerks. By 
degrees the management of the farm fell into the hands of 
John Caldwell. 

The institution of slavery, the old plantation life, is gone. 
Soon all recollection of it will be lost. In order to enable the 
reader to understand something of that life, we shall give a 
brief account of what fell under our notice. We shall present 
no imaginary picture. 

Not far from the Calhoun settlement lived a man who had 
ridden with Sumter in the old war for liberty. During a long 
and active life he managed the business of the plantation him- 
self. Toward the close of his life he consented to try an over- 
seer, but in every case some difficulty soon arose between 
the middleman and the negroes, in which the old planter 
invariably took sides with the latter, and rid himself of the 
proxy. On rainy days the negro women spun raw cotton into 
yarn, which was woven by his own weaver into summer goods, 
to be cut out by a seamstress, and made by the other women, 
assisted by her, into clothing for the "people." The sheep 
were shorn, and the wool treated in the same fashion for win- 
ter clothing. The hides of cattle eaten on the place were 
tanned into leather and made into shoes by his own shoemaker. 
He had his own carpenters, wheelwrights, and blacksmiths, 
and besides cattle and sheep the old planter raised his own 
stock of horses and mules. He grew his own wheat for flour, 
besides raising other small grain, corn, and cotton. He'dis- 
tilled his own brandy from peaches and sweetened it with 
honey manufactured by his own bees. His negroes were well

fed and clothed, carefully attended to in sickness, virtually 
free in old age, and supported in comfort till their death. 
The moral law against adultery was sternly enforced upon the 
place, and no divorce allowed. His people were encouraged 
to enjoy themselves in all reasonable ways. They went to a 
Methodist church in the neighborhood on Sunday, and had 
besides a preacher of their own, raised on the place. The 
voting were supplied with necessary fiddling and dancing. I 
was present when he died, and heard him say to tell his son 
that he would leave him a property honestly made and not 
burdened with a dollar of indebtedness. His family and 
friends were gathered about his bedside when the time had 
come for him to go. Having taken leave of his friends, he 
ordered his negro laborers to be summoned from the field to 
lake farewell of him. When they arrived he was speechless 
and motionless, but sensible of all that was occuring, as could 
be seen from his look of intelligence. One by one the negroes 
entered the apartment, and filing by him in succession took 
each in turn the limp hand of their dying master, and affec- 
tionately pressing it for a moment, thanked him for his good- 
ness, commended him to God, and bade him farewell. 

The faithful discharge of the duties of the proprietor of a 
plantation in former times demanded administrative as well 
as moral qualities of a high order. There never was a better 
school for the education of statesmen than the administration 
of a Southern plantation under the former regime. A well- 
governed plantation was a well-ordered little independent 
state. Surrounded with such environments, Calhoun grew 
up at this school. Providence placed him there, forcing him 
away from books, keeping him from the busy haunts of men. 
Under the watchful eye of his mother, a "great manager," 
and with the proud feeling of being leaned upon by her as 
her support, the sense of duty grew into a habit. Said Mr. 
Webster: "I have not in public nor in private life known a 
more assiduous person in the discharge of his appropriate 
duties. I have known no man who wasted less of life in what 
is called recreation, or employed less of it in any pursuits not 
connected with the immediate discharge of his duty." 1 

1 Note by Colonel Starker When he took charge of his brother's property he made the 
largest crop ever made and saved him from bankruptcy. "Under whatever overseer, he 
always made fine crops" (J. E. Calhoun).

When young Calhoun was managing the plantation for his 
mother, the only newspaper, we believe, published in the State 
was the weekly South Carolina Gazette. The Post-Office De- 
partment of the General Government was then in its infancy. 
At that time no post-office had been established in the Calhoun 
neighborhood; a letter was a serious business, and an oppor- 
tunity for its safe transmission was watched for and used. A 
copy of this 'valuable journal reached the hands of John Cald- 
well, and was carefully preserved by him to the end of his life. 
The newspaper lies before us. Published May 10, 1798, it is 
somewhat tattered and worn, with a faded yellowish look, hav- 
ing evidently been much handled. It was read and reread 
many times by John Caldwell, then 16 years of age, for it bears 
his pencil-marks in various places. The stock watered and 
fed, the stables and barns locked, and when necessary the 
weekly rations of meal and bacon dealt out and the keys hung 
up by the fireplace, he seats himself at a table lighted by a 
home-made tallow candle and opens the Gazette. It was his 
first political text-book, and on this account deserves notice. 1 
From his fourteenth to his nineteenth year John Caldwell had 
few books to read, and little spare time for reading. He was 
the manager of a plantation, and attended to his duties. He 
cultivated the habit of thinking for himself, which invested 
what he said with the charm of originality. It was at this 
period of his life that he began the cultivation of that conver- 
sational talent to which Mr. Webster alluded on the same 
occasion, a talent in which he so came to excel that another 
distinguished Senator remarked that in this respect " no one 
approached to an equality with him." 

He was educated, we repeat, under "an old-fashioned" sys- 
tem that had its time and subserved its uses. He was taught 
to regard the Bible as a sacred book, to reverence God, to 
obey his parents, to do justice to all. He was a profoundly 
devout man without being religious, and often expressed him- 
self as having "unshaken confidence in the providence of

God." However much he may ultimately have come to differ 
from the Calvanistic creed of his ancestors, in which he has 
since been followed by the entire Presbyterian laity, he kept 
his views to himself. But this much may be said, that when 
he tirs.t appears before us the influence of his early religious 
training- is very perceptible, and occasionally to the end of his 
life we may plainly discover that the Scotch-Presbyterian 
"Nuach" instilled into him in his infancy and childhood had 
never left him. 

John Caldwell, as he mixed with the people, began to be 
regarded as a young man of worth and promise, grew more 
and more noticeable in the community of farmers about him 
till they began to talk about him. "By and by," said Mr. 
flames Edward Calhoun, a man himself of finished culture and 
hale in his tenth decade, "by and by a feeling manifested 
itself among the people in remarks that John C. Calhoun 
ought to be educated." This public sentiment was made 
known to his mother. But John's presence was necessary on 
the farm, and doubtless the canny Scotchwoman had an eye 
to business. How could she do without him 2 But so fre- 
quently and urgently was the matter pressed upon her, accord- 
ing to my informant, that at last she spoke to her eldest son 
about it. "We had a consultation about the matter," said 
J. C. C. In the summer of 1800 her second son, James, came 
home from Charleston. She sent for her eldest son, William, 
and laid the matter before them. Just at this time, too, it 
happened that the Rev. Moses Waddell, having at last-discov- 
ered that his true vocation was teaching, had established an 
academy on the Carolina side of the Savannah, in close prox- 
imity to the flourishing town of Lisbon and Petersburg, in 
Georgia. Vienna was not more than 8 eight miles distant 
from Mrs. Calhoun's. The object in view at first in this family 
council was merely to send John to Mr. WaddelPs school long 
enough to fit him to pursue the profession of the law. 

When the proposition was first made to John Caldwell to 
send him to Waddell's he objected. He said he had deter- 
mined to become a planter; besides, as he remarked, how 
could his mother do without him. The advantages of an edu- 
cation were pressed upon him for some time in vain. At last 
John laid his ultimatum before the family council, and from

all that we can learn a report of its proceedings might be 
given somewhat as follows: 

JOHN. To the offer of such a partial education I answer decidedly, no; 
but if you are willing and able to give me a complete education, I give my 
consent. 

FAMILY COUNCIL. What is your idea of a complete education? 

JOHN. The best school, college, and legal education to be had in the 
United States. 

FAMILY COUNCIL. In that case we would be obliged to send you to a 
New England college and maintain you there for several years. 

JOHN. True; but I will accept nothing less. 

FAMILY COUNCIL. How long will you require for the accomplishment of 
such an education? 

JOHN. About seven years. 

The family council had frequent meetings, and discussions. 
While well enough to do in the world, the Calhouns were in 
moderate circumstances. To James has been awarded most 
of the credit which we are persuaded belongs to all, and as we 
believe mainly to the widowed mother. There are not many 
men who would consent to shorten a small income for seven 
years in order to educate a brother. What confidence these 
three persons must have had not merely in the ability and 
energy of this 3 r outh of 18, but in his honesty and sense of 
duty, in his utter trustworthiness, that they agreed to the pro- 
posed compact with him. The country owes much to that 
mother and those two brothers, William and James Calhoun. 1 

A few days after the family had decided to send him to 
Vienna, John Caldwell left his home left it with reluctance 
and entered Mr. Waddell's school to begin in his nineteenth 
year his scholastic education. Mr. Calhoun's opinion of the 
famous schoolmaster Waddell was given long afterwards in 
these words: 

In that character [as a teacher] he stands almost unrivaled. He may 
be justly considered as the father of classical education in the upper coun- 
try of South Carolina and Georgia. His excellence in that character de- 
pended not so much on extensive or profound learning as a felicitous 
combination of qualities for the government of boys and communicating 
to them what he knew. He was particularly successful in exciting emula- 
tion amongst them, and in obtaining the good will of all except the worth- 



*In his boyhood the present writer enjoyed the acquaintance of Mr. William Calhoun 
and his family, and there now lies before me a letter from his third daughter, Sarah, 
known to me as Sallie, now Mrs. E. P. Noble, of Texas, who, in her youth, was one of 
the most beautiful women in the United States. To her and to her respected husband I 
am indebted for many interesting facte in this history. (Note by Colonel Starke.)

less. The best evidence of his high qualities as a teacher is his success. 
Among his pupils are to be found a large portion of the eminent men in 
this State and Georgia. In this State it is sufficient to name McDuffie, 
Lfgare, Pettigru, and my colleague Butler. To these many others of dis- 
tinction might be added. His pupils in Georgia who have distinguished 
themselves are numerous. In the list are to be found the names of William 
II. Crawford, Longstreet, etc. It is in his character of a teacher, espe- 
cially, that he will long be remembered as a benefactor of the country. 

From Vienna this remarkable teacher removed to Willing- 
ton, Abbeville County, and the name of the . Wellington 
Academy became famous all over the South. After he was 
forced, from age and disability, to give up teaching, the school 
was revived by his sons, James and John Waddell, but under 
the general supervision of the old schoolmaster. No doubt 
his sons followed their father's plan of teaching, and as I was 
when a boy long an inmate of Moses Waddell's family and a 
pupil at the Willington Academy, it may not be unentertain- 
ing to give a short account of the old Willington school as we 
had it from tradition. The boys boarded at farmhouses in 
the neighborhood or lived in log huts in the woods near the 
academy, furnishing their own supplies. At sunrise Dr. Wad- 
dell was wont to wind his horn, which was immediately an- 
swered by horns from various boarding houses in all directions. 
At an early hour the pupils made their appearance at the log 
cabin schoolhouse. The Doctor, entering the cabin and de- 
positing his hat, would reappear at the door with the school 
horn in his hand. He then would call out loud, " What boy 
feels most flatulent this morning?" After the horn had been 
sounded by some luck} 7 youth the school boys came in to listen 
to a short, set form of prayer. 

After prayers the pupils, each with a chair bearing his name 
sculped in the back of it, retired to the woods for study, the 
classes being divided into squads according to individual pref- 
erence. In the spring and summer months these squads scat- 
tered through the oak and hickory woods in -quest of shade, 
but in cold weather the first thing done by them was to kindle 
log-heap fires. Whosoever imagines that the boys did not 
study as well as they would have done under the immediate 
eye of the teacher is mistaken. I have been to many schools, 
conducted according to various systems of education, but 
nowhere have I seen such assiduity in study, nowhere have I 
ever witnessed such emulation to excel. It was a classical 



80 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

school. The multiplicity of studies now advertised at fash- 
ionable academies was unknown in those early times. The 
debating* club on Friday afternoons was an important institu- 
tion, and regarded by the teacher as a very necessary part of 
his scholastic system, for to converse and speak in public were 
esteemed necessary accomplishments to Southern youths. It 
was to such a school that John C. Calhoun went in the summer 
of 1800. Under Dr. Waddell he opened for the first time a 
Latin grammar. 

About the same time the freshman class was organized at 
Yale College, and so rapidly did this eager student press for- 
ward under the instruction of Moses Waddell, that he over- 
took that same class in 1802, when he matriculated as a junior 
in that famous institution of learning. I once asked Mr. 
Calhoun if he remembered when the thought first came into, 
his mind of his superiority to ordinary men. He smiled and 
paused for reflection a few moments. "I went on to Yale 
College," said he in reply, " fresh from the backwoods. My 
opportunities for learning had been very limited. I had a 
high opinion of the New England system of education. My 
first recitation was in mathematics, and we had been told to 
fetch our slates into the class room. On taking our seats the 
professor proceeded to propound certain arithmetical ques- 
tions to us. I found no difficulty in working out the first, 
and on looking about me was surprised to find the others busy 
with their slates. The professor noticing my movement 
asked me if I had got the answer, and I handed him my slate. 
The answer proved to be correct. The same thing occurred 
every time. On returning to my apartment 1 felt gratified. 
That is, perhaps, sir, the best answer I can give to your 
question." 

Not long after his matriculation at Yale his mother died. 
In letters to Mrs. John Ewing Calhoun he often speaks of the 
tenderness and watchfulness of a mother's love in such terms 
as serve to show that he had felt and appreciated its force. 
He had the Scottish clannishness that recognizes kinship far 
removed. His family affections were warm. Towards the 
excellent woman, that "great manager of her household," 
who had so faithfully watched and guided him in boyhood and 
youth, he entertained a devoted love. One of the last acts of 
his life was to fence in the graves of his dead with iron rail-

ing, and erect over the remains of his parents a marble pile, 
which now stands near the ruins of the mansion in which his 
mother had rocked his infancy to sleep, and where the sturdy 
old Scotch-Irishman had trained him in his ways of duty. It 
was mainly due to his mother, as we have every reason to 
believe, that he was persuaded to receive an education, and to 
her influence it was also owing that arrangements were made 
that enabled him to enjoy the advantages of a finished col- 
legiate training. 

Through Dr. Waddell, her son-in-law, Mrs. Calhoun was 
kept informed of the progress of John Caldwell in his studies. 
I have myself often heard the old teacher speak of him as a 
schoolboy. 

The only anecdote recorded of Mr. Calhoun during his resi- 
dence in New Haven is of a discussion in the class room, in his 
senior year, with the president of the college. "Mr. Cal- 
houn," says Senator R. M. T. Hunter in his sketch of him, 
"was highly esteemed by Dr. Dwight, then the president of 
the college, although they differed widely in politics, and at a 
time when political feelings were intensely bitter. The doctor 
was an ardent Federalist, and Mr. Calhoun was one of very 
few, in a class of more than TO, who had the firmness to openly 
avow and maintain the opinions of the Republican party, and 
among others that the people were the only legitimate source 
of political power. Dr. Dwight entertained a different 
opinion. In a recitation during the senior year on the chap- 
ter on politics in Paley's Moral Philosophy, the doctor, with 
the intention of illustrating his opinion, propounded to Mr. 
Calhoun the question as to the legitimate source of political 
power. He did not decline an open and direct avowal of his 
opinion. A discussion ensued between them which exhausted 
the time allotted for the recitation, and in which the pupil 
maintained his opinion with such vigor of argument and suc- 
cess as to elicit from his distinguished teacher the declaration, 
in speaking of him to a friend, that ' the young man had talent 
enough to be the President of the United States,' which he 
accompanied with a prediction that he would one day attain 
that position." 

On the 12th of September, 1804, John C. Calhoun received 
his degree of bachelor of arts. The. old diploma lies before 
us: " Senatus Academicus, Collegii Yalensis, In Civitate Novo- 
HIST 99 VOL ii 6

Portu, Reipublicae Connecticuttensis," etc., signed by Tirno- 
theus Dwight, Praeses. He had been appointed to speak, and 
the subject selected by him, "The qualifications necessaiy to 
constitute a perfect statesman," indicated the bent of his mind 
toward politics. He was prevented by a serious illness from 
appearing among the distinguished graduates at the com- 
mencement. Since that first recitation in mathematics he had 
measured himself with his compeers, and the result could not 
have been disheartening. Although preparing himself for the 
pursuit of a livelihood in an honorable profession, he was 
looking forward to possibilities in another direction; and 
justly. Men still relied upon merit; the age .of political 
availability was not yet come; the people were yet accustomed 
to cast about them for intellectual excellence combined with 
integrity. A high and honorable ambition could expect to 
find its fit reward. 

Calhoun's purely literary tuition was now at an end. In 
four years from the time he opened his Latin grammar, he 
had, in fulfillment of his purpose and promise, graduated 
with distinction at one of the highest institutions of learning 
in this country. The short time allotted to his literary educa- 
tion, joined to the want of early training, prevented him from 
bestowing that attention upon polish which marks the distin- 
guished graduates of our time. Whether [or not] Mr. Cal- 
houn's want of the last veneering rendered him unable to see 
the utility that lies in little things, he seemed always to under- 
value the dressing of his thoughts. Neither in speaking nor 
in writing did he aim at the grace of style. His aim was not 
so much to please or persuade, as to convince by reasoning, 
to overpower by an irresistible logic that formulated earnest- 
ness and intensity of purpose. 

Ezekiel, a brother of Patrick Calhoun, had married a Miss 
Ewing. His son, John Ewing Colhoun, as he always wrote 
the name, wedded a low-country heiress of French extrac- 
tion, Floride Bonneau. The Bonneaus lived at Bonneau's 
Ferry, on Cooper River, about 20 miles above Charleston. 
This John Ewing Colhoun, by his marriage, came into pos- 
session of a rice plantation, [and of] lands in the upper 
country, where, at a very advanced age, his son James 
Edward still lives, from whom we have obtained sundry facts 
of interest concerning his distinguished kinsman. 



SKETCH OF CALHOUN. 83 

This John Ewing Colhoun was elected to the United States 
mate from South Carolina toward the close of the last cen- 
iry. While he was a Senator, as his son says, the head of 
Colquhouns engaged in a correspondence with him, in 
-hk-h the Highlander endeavored to persuade the American 
restore the spelling of the name of the ancestral clan, 
n Ewing, who went so far as to write his name Colhoun, 
lied in 1802, leaving a widow and three children, Floride 
)rn in 1792, John Ewing, and James Edward. Mrs. Col- 
)un, the widow, spent the summer of 1804: at Newport, R. I., 
and while there, hearing of the illness of John Caldwell at 
Yale, she wrote and invited him to come to her cottage at 
Newport as soon as he could travel. 

Mr. Calhoun arrived in Charleston in company with Mrs. 
Floride Calhoun and family about the middle of November. 
He hastened on his way home, and soon found himself among 
his friends in Abbeville. He was a genial, kindly man, fond 
of his friends, delighting in social intercourse. The only 
relaxation that he ever indulged in was social conversing with 
his friends. But that was said of him long afterwards. He 
was young at the time we speak of, and Christmas was coming. 
Mr. Calhoun spent the winter of 1805 at Abbeville village, 
reading Blackstone in Mr. Bowie's law office. It was a part 
of the original family compact that he was to receive the best 
legal education to be had. At that time there was at Litch- 
field, in Connecticut, a famous law school kept by Judge Reeves 
and Mr. Gould, and to that place he determined to go. 

Mrs. Floride Calhoun was in the habit of spending the sum- 
mers at Newport. She was wealthy, and traveled in state in 
her journeys from her rice plantation on Cooper River to the 
upper country, where she had large possessions. 

Having determined to go on to Newport in her family char- 
iot, and aware of John's intention to return to New England, 
Mrs. Calhoun invited him to take a seat in her coach. Her 
youngest son James, still living, remembers the trip. The 
wealthy widow must have made a stir in the little village as 
she passed through it in her family coach, drawn by four splen- 
did gray horses, with the reins held by an English coachman 
in full livery. The widow took with her Floride, then in her 
thirteenth year, and her sons John and James. At the request 
of John Caldwell, for whom she had learned to feel a warm 



84 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

motherly regard mixed with admiration, the widow consented 
to make a detour and stop a day or two at Charlottes ville, in 
Virginia. The young Carolina Republican was anxious to see 
Mr. Jefferson, then on a visit to Monticello. 

"Cousin John," said my informant, "went out to Monti- 
cello to call upon Mr. Jefferson, who must have been pleased 
with him, as he detained him till the following morning. The 
conversation between these two men is said to have lasted until 
midnight, which was an unusual occurrence with Mr. Jeffer- 
son. I remember hearing that Mr. Jefferson, coming into 
town next day, spoke about John C. Calhoun in a manner 
quite gratifying to my mother." "Jefferson loved him," said 
Richard Rush, in speaking of Mr. Calhoun after his death. 

To understand John C. Calhoun, we should have previously 
studied the history of Thomas Jefferson. That interview at 
night between the old Virginia statesman and the young Caro- 
linian, the only time they ever met, has something in it quite 
suggestive. The ancient Greeks had a mystic torch race in 
which the tired runner handed the lighted brand to some fresh 
racer, who bore it onward to the goal. 

Having accompanied Mrs. Calhoun and family to Newport, 
John Caldwell proceeded on his way to the Litchfield Law 
School. This lady had such an admiration for his talents that 
she carefully preserved all his letters to her. His law diploma, 
dated Litchfield, Conn., 29th July, 1806, certifies that "John 
C. Calhoun has read law as a regular student under the tuition 
of Hon. Tappan Reeves and James Gould, from the 22d July, 
1805, to the date hereof, and that during that period he has 
applied himself to no other regular business, and has attended 
diligently and faithfully to the study of the law." I was a 
student in the law school of William T. Gould at Augusta, 
Ga. Judge Gould was the son of one of the teachers at Litch- 
field, and doubtless followed in his system of instruction that 
of Reeves and Gould. Legal questions were discussed by us 
in the moot courts, Mr. Gould presiding as judge. Public 
discussion must therefore have been a part of Mr. Calhoun's 
education. 

At the close of his legal studies at Litchfield, Mr. Calhoun 
went to Philadelphia, where he purchased a horse and returned 
to Carolina by land. In this way he traveled over an inter- 



SKETCH OF CALHOTJN. 85 

esting part of the United States, surveying it with observing 
eyes, mixing with the people as he passed along, chatting 
with them on the road, conversing with the farmers at night, 
studying the character of his countrymen and noticing the con 
dition of the country under Jefferson's second administration.. 

He left Charleston about the 1st of June, 1807, and returned 
to Abbeville village, where he expected to establish himself as 
a lawyer. At the next session of the supreme court held at 
Columbia he underwent his examination for the bar. From let- 
ters written soon after his admission to the bar it would appear 
that after accumulating a moderate competency he intended 
returning to farming which, to the end of life, was his favor- 
ite pursuit. To purchase a plantation on the Savannah River 
and live among his friends and relatives was his dream of 
happiness. But the fates were spinning for him a different 
destiny. Immediately after the attack on the Chesapeake, 
June 22, 1807, the farmers of Abbeville district, in South 
Carolina, called a public meeting in reference to the outrage. 
Mr. Calhoun, not yet admitted to chancery practice, was pur- 
suing his business at Abbeville. He had doubtless done 
much talking about this and other affairs, for the committee of 
arrangements selected him to draw up and present the resolu- 
tions to the citizens of Abbeville at a public meeting. For 
the first time in his life he rose to his feet before his assembled 
countrymen. 

Standing 1 or 2 inches above 6 feet, the gaunt, erect young 
man, then in the 26th year of his age, presented that marked 
visage known to many in the audience, and for the first 
time flashed upon them the intense light from those dark- 
brown eyes. No report has reached us of this important 
speech except through tradition. That it was effective we 
know from the results which followed. The people of Abbe- 
ville district had long entertained an objection to being repre- 
sented in the legislature by lawyers. For many years no one 
of that profession had ventured to offer himself as a candidate 
for political honors. Now, however, with general acclaim, 
the people of his native district called for John Caldwell 
Calhoun and elected him to the legislature at the head of the 
ticket. And thus was completed the family compact. John 
Caldwell Calhoun had asked for seven years and the time

came to an end about the date of that public meeting in Abbe- 
ville. William and James Calhoun were present and must 
have been content. 

Returning to Carolina in November, Mrs. Colhoun pro- 
ceeded to her rice plantation near Bonneau's Ferry, on Cooper 
River, where she remained during the winter and spring of 
1808. Her only daughter, Floride, then in her 17th year, is 
represented as being beautiful in form and feature, graceful 
and winning in manners and address. Being half French, she 
manifested the cheerful vivacity of her Huguenot ancestry, 
as well as those more solid qualities for which they were 
distinguished. During the spring of 1808 John Caldwell, 
mounting his horse, rode all the way from Abbeville to Bon- 
neau's Ferry, where, in the old mansion of the Bonneaus, he 
passed several days. 1 He was admitted to practice in chan- 
cery soon after his return. 

It was not long after his entrance into the legislature before 
he made an impression. In those days the Presidential elec- 
tors were appointed by the State legislatures, and South 
Carolina never abandoned this plan of electing them till her 
constitution was altered by strangers and thieves in 1868. 
"Early in the session," says Mr. Hunter, "an informal meet- 
ing of the Republican members was called to nominate candi- 
dates for the places of President and Vice-President of the 
United States. Mr. Madison was nominated for the Presidency 
without opposition. When the nomination for the Vice-Presi- 
dency was presented, Mr. Calhoun embraced the occasion to 
present his views in reference to coming events as bearing on 
the nomination. He reviewed the state of the relations between 
the United States and Great Britain and France, the two great 
belligerents which were then struggling for the mastery and 
in their struggle trampling on the rights of neutrals, and 
especially ours. He touched on the restrictive system which 
had been resorted to by the Government to protect our rights, 
and expressed his doubts about its efficiency and the convic- 
tion that a war with Great Britain was inevitable. 'It was,' 
he said, 'in this state of things of the utmost importance 

1 The story of Mr. Calhoun' s love affair and engagement is told by Colo- 
nel Starke by means of extracts from his letters to Mrs. J. E. Calhoun, 
letters which are printed on later pages of this volume. ED.

that the ranks of the Republican party should be preserved 
undisturbed and unbroken by faction or discord.' He then 
adverted to the fact that a discontented portion of the party 
had given unequivocal evidence of rallying around the name 
of the venerable Vice-President George Clinton (whose nomi- 
nation was proposed), and of whom he spoke highly, but he 
gave it as his opinion that should he be nominated and 
re-elected he would become the nucleus of all the discontented 
portion of the party, and thus make a formidable division in 
its ranks should the country be forced into war. . These per- 
sons he predicted would ultimately rally under De Witt Clin- 
ton, the nephew, whom he described as a man of distinguished 
talents and aspiring disposition. To avoid the danger, he 
suggested for nomination the name of John Langdon, of 
New Hampshire, of whom he spoke highly both as to talents 
and patriotism. It was Mr. Calhoun's first effort in a public 
capacity. The manner and matter excited great applause; 
and when it is recollected that these remarks preceded the 
declaration of war more than three years, and how events 
happened according to his anticipations, it affords a striking 
proof of that sagacity, at so early a period, for which he has 
since been so much distinguished. It at once gave him a 
stand among the distinguished members of the legislature." 

Ex-Governor Joseph Alston, the son-in-law of Aaron Burr, 
was a member at the same session, and wished to bring him 
into his political clique; but after an abortive attempt to exer- 
cise influence over him, he observed to Mr. Huger, "I am 
afraid I shall find this long, gawky fellow from Abbeville 
hard to manage." Several important measures were origi- 
nated by Mr. Calhoun while in the legislature which have 
become a permanent portion of the legislation of the State, 
and he soon acquired an extensive practice at the bar. 

The great question that agitated the minds of the people of 
the United States in 1810 was the apprehended war with Great 
Britain. Elections were to be held throughout the country 
for members of the Twelfth Congress, and the people every- 
where were serious and alarmed. There were many timid 
men in the backwoods, for only thirty years before Tarleton's 
red dragoons had ridden over the State. These men brought 
out General Elmore in the Congressional district watered by

the Saludah and Savannah. Mr. Calhoun's strong resolutions, 
presented to the Abbeville meeting after Barren had lowered 
his flag to the Leopard, and the signal ability with which he 
supported them, had made an impression upon the farmers of 
the backwoods. They kept their eyes on him. They had 
sent him to the legislature, notwithstanding that he belonged 
to a hated profession. They had heard good reports of him 
there, and in watching his course afterwards they felt a con- 
stantly growing admiration. Wherever he went he left an 
impression of force and trustworthiness. By common consent 
among those who were for strong measures Mr. Calhoun was 
brought out, and during the summer and fall of 1810 he con- 
ducted an active canvass before the people, during which he 
met his opponent at various places in the district. When he 
was done it was all over with General Elmore. Mr. Calhoun 
was elected to Congress by a large majority. 

A few years of law practice, particularly in the chancery 
court, had enabled Mr. Calhoun to accumulate that moder- 
ate competency to which he aspired. Eminently fitted as he 
seemed to be from the cast of his mind for success at the 
bar he never liked the profession. Farming was his delight. 
He loved the farmers, and of all our representative men he 
may be considered as the peculiar representative of the agri- 
cultural interests, the great farmer-statesman of our country. 
His views as yet of his career are very limited. The people 
have urged his acceptance of the nomination to Congress, and 
youthful ambition and self-confidence prepared him to assume 
the trust. He has met Mr. Elmore. A few broadsides have 
so utterly dismasted and dismantled that man of peace as to 
leave no doubt of victory. After two sessions, however, he 
hopes to return to that pleasant place "Near my brother Pat- 
rick's." But it was otherwise written in the book of destiny. 

To this period of Mr. Calhoun's life is to be referred his 
only attempt at verse-making. But the muse of song refused 
to come at his bidding, for what could she make of an invoca- 
tion commencing ' ' Whereas " ? The friendly Aristarchus 
summoned to sit in judgment on the lyric condemned the 
ditty. Calhoun never again attempted to mount the winged 
hippogriff. 

In November, Mrs. Calhoun returned to South Carolina. 
Floride's lover met her in Charleston, where he had awaited 



SKETCH OF CALHOUN. 89 

the arrival of the vessel, and accompanied her family to Bon- 
neau's Ferry on Cooper River, about 20 miles above the city. 
Mr. Calhoun had been triumphantly elected to Congress early 
in October, but was not to take his seat for nearly fourteen 
months. He might well say that heaven had been kind to 
him. The secret of his engagement had been so well kept 
that her brother James, then a lad of 13, was not aware of it 
till some days after the arrival of the family from Charleston. 
One day, as he informed the writer, being in the carriage with 
the two lovers, he caught cousin John slyly kissing his sister. 
Intercourse between young persons of different sexes was not 
so free and easy in those days as it is at present. James felt 
indignant at the conduct of his kinsman, and did not fail on 
arriving at home to report the matter to his mother, who, how- 
ever, manifested neither surprise nor indignation. It was 
then learned that a wedding would soon come off. "It was a 
grand affair, that wedding," continued the venerable gentle- 
man, his memory going over three-quarters of a century, u an 
old-time wedding; everybody was there." 

On the 8th of January, 1811, John Caldwell Calhoun was 
married to Floride, only daughter of ex-Senator John Ewing 
Colhoun. After spending a few weeks at his mother-in-law's 
in St. John's parish, Mr. Calhoun took his bride up to his 
plantation and dwelling, called Bath, " not far from my brother 
Patrick's," in Abbeville district. 

Mr. Calhoun's married life was a very happy one. His only 
relaxation from public duties was found in the bosom of his 
family and in conversation with his friends. No breath of 
slander ever soiled the private life of John C. Calhoun. 
" There was nothing groveling or low or meanly selfish," said 
Mr. Webster, "that came near the head or the heart of Mr. 
Calhoun. If he had aspirations, they were high and honor- 
able and noble." Webster, who had watched him for forty 
years, knew him well. 

With his entry into Congress terminates the strictly private 
life of Mr. Calhoun. For almost forty years he occupied a 
commanding position in public affairs, and his personal history 
during that time is so closely interwoven with that of his 
county that neither can be well understood without some 
knowledge of the other.

To Mfrs. Floride Calhoun. 1 c. c. 

New Haven August 29*. h 1804. 

DEAR MADAM, Yesterday your friendly favor of the 23 rd . 
Ins* came to hand. M r . Noble did suggest to me, sometime 
.since, that you expected to spend the summer in Rhode Island, 
and that you would be glad to see me there, but did not men- 
tion at what place. Soon after my Brother wrote me word 
that you contemplated spending it in Philadelphia. Under 
this uncertainty it was impossible for me to act until further 
information from you. This, however, as I before stated, 
reached me not only late, but found me ill. 

I thank you, Madam, for your kind solicitude regarding the 
present state of my health. I am happy to assure you that I 
feel myself making some advances towards a recovery, tho' 
not such rapid and immediate ones, as would correspond both 
with the wishes of my friends, and my own impatience to 
recover. I flatter myself, however, that I shall have so far 
regained my health by Commencement 2 that I shall be able to 
realize the enjoyments and participate in the labors of that 
Day, But above all, Madam, I am anxious to recover in order 
that I may visit New Port, which, with the indulgence of 
health, I shall do immediately after Commencement; Until 
which time, and forever, believe me, Dear Madam, to be, with 
great respect, yours, . . . 



To Alexander 

Newport, 15 Oct., 1804. 

D r . ALEXANDER: From a variety of causes I have been 
prevented from answering your last till now. It would be 

1 Floride Bonneau Calhoun, widow of John Ewing Colhoun or Calhouji, U.S. Senator 
from South Carolina from 1801 to 1802, and first cousin of John C. Calhoun. It was her 
daughter Floride whom Calhoun married in 1811. The letter is addressed to her at New- 
port, Rhode Island, as are also the subsequent letters written to her, down to 1808. 

2 September 12. 

3 The text of this letter has been derived from Col. W. Pinkney Starke's MS. biography 
of Calhoun, described on p. 65, supra. Col. Starke states that it is the earliest letter of 
Calhoun he has been able to find. The present editor has not seen the original. Alex- 
ander Noble, to whom the letter is addressed, was a kinsman of Calhoun, and a school- 
mate at Dr. Waddell's school.

superfluous to make an enumeration of all of them. After 
enjoying almost uninterrupted good health since my departure 
from Carolina, I was attacked in August last by a serious ill- 
ness which had well nigh put an end to my life. At com- 
mencement I was so low, that I was unable to participate 
either in the pleasures or exercises of the day. The latter 
part of September I arrived in this place, where I had the 
pleasure of finding your Aunt's family. Newport is quite a 
pleasant place, but it has rather an old appearance which gives 
it a somewhat melancholy aspect. I have found no part of 
New England more agreeable than the island of Rhode Island. 
Agreeably situated, well cultivated and possessed of a good 
soil and delightful climate, it seems to possess all that can 
contribute to the pleasures of man. But as to the civil situ- 
ation of this State and its manners, customs, moral and relig- 
ious character, it seems much inferior as far as my information 
extends, to every other part of New England. Tomorrow I 
set off in company with your Aunt for Boston. We expect 
to make a short stay, not more perhaps than a week. I ex- 
pect to return to Carolina by water, and in the same vessel 
with your Aunt and family. We do not expect to sail before 
the 10th or 12th of next month, as we apprehend from accounts 
received from Charleston, that it would be dangerous to be 
there before the middle of November. Your Aunt begs to 
be remembered to you.

Litchfield 22 d July 1805. 

D r MADAM, In obedience to my feelings, no less than to 
your request, I embrace the first opportunity of informing 
you of my arrival here. From New London, I took the stage 
to Norwich; and thence to Hartford, where I was detained 
part of two days, which prevented my reaching Litchfield be- 
fore Saturday evening. I found M r Felder 1 well, and anx- 
iously waiting my arrival. He has been here 5 weeks and 
express himself pleased with the place. I was peculiarly for- 
tunate in having Judge Reeves 2 the gentleman with whom I 

1 John M. Felder (1782-1851), a classmate of Calhoun, afterwards a prominent politician 
in South Carolina. See O'Neall's Bench and Bar of South Carolina, II, 325-336.

Litchfield from 1784 to 1820 a celebrated law-school.

here study, a passenger in the stage from Hartford to this 
place. I delivered my letter to him; and found him on the 
passage open and agreeable. I have every prospect of ren- 
dering my residence here very agreeable; and I return, I as- 
sure you, with much pleasure to the cultivation of Black- 
stone's acquaintance. 

For two or three days, after I left New Port, I felt much of 
that lonesome Sensation, which I believe every one experi- 
ences, after departing from those with whom he has been long 
intimate. However by mingling and conversing with others, 
I have felt it much diminished; and by a few days application 
to studies, which to me are highly interesting, I have no 
doubt it will be entirely removed. At Norwich I met with 
M r . Ward, and he informed me, that his health is still in a 
progressive State. I have not yet had an opportunity of 
speaking to Sterling. 1 He resides six or seven miles out of 
town; but M r Felder saw him a few days since. In convers- 
ing with him about going to the southward he observed to M r 
Felder, that he was desirous of instructing in a private family. 
I shall, however, see him before I write again; and let you 
know the particulars. M r Felder and myself room together; 
and both being sensible of the importance of application, at 
our age, have resolved to devote our time to solid and useful 
studies. With the assistence of providence and a continuation 
of my health I hope to carry this determination into full exe- 
cution. M r Felder joins his respects to you. 

[P. S] Rebe r me particularly to M rs , Miss andM r Thurston; 
and to my acquaintance in N. Port generally. My love to 
Floride, John and James. 2

Litchfield 12 th August 1805. 

D r MADAM, On the 10 th Inst. I received your's of 31 st Ult, 
which, I assure you, both in the perusal and reception afforded 
me no ordinary degree of pleasure. I am sorry to hear of 

1 Micah Sterling, another classmate, afterward, 1821-1823, a Congressman from New 
York. 

2 John Ewing Calhoun and James Edward Calhoun, to whom many subsequent letters 
are addressed, were sons of Mrs. Calhoun, and brothers of Calhoun's future wife, Floride

your indisposition; but hope, as it originated in a cold, it will 
be removed with the cause. I think, with D r Turner, that the 
winter will be too severe for you, in your present feeble state 
of health. You requested me to enquire for a traveler for 
you; I know of none at present; but shall use all diligence, 
should you come to a determination to return, to obtain one 
for you. I cannot, but look on our choice in not going through 
Wilmington, as extremely fortunate. This is certainly an- 
other argument in favor of your general parable that c ' all is 
for the best." 

I thank you much for your affectionate mode of address; 
which, I assure you, is much more agreeable to my feeling 
than any other. Your whole actions in kindness and affection 
have been to me, like a mother's tenderness. I know not how, 
I shall make sufficient returns; unless it is by acting in a man- 
ner worthy of your friendship and esteem; which, with the 
assistence of him who is the author of all good resolutions and 
actions, I hope to do. 

I feel myself much absorbed by the pursuit of legal knowl- 
edge at present. In fact, in order to take the course of law 
lectures, not as they usually are, but as they ought to be, I 
find, I must devote almost the whole of my time to that pur- 
pose. I find M r Felder a faithful and cheering companion in 
the dry and solitary journey through the exterior fields of law. 
We both console ourselves, that in a few years we shall acquire 
a pretty thorough knowledge of our profession ; and then our 
time shall be more at our own disposals. Perhaps, this is but 
a pleasant dream; as every succeeding year comes loaded with 
its own peculiar cares and business. I have reason to be 
thankful for a continuation of my health. I think I am rather 
more healthy and stout than when I left N. Port. It is some 
what strange, I alwaj^s feel myself in the best health, when 
studying closely. 

Remember me affectionately to M rs and Miss Thurston, to 
M r T. and to my acquaintances in New Port generally. 
Give my love to Floride, Elizabeth, John and James. Tell 
James, the first time I write to Miss - - I shall not forget 
to request a kiss for him. The paper forces me to conclude. 
I wish you a speedy return of health; and will be extremely 
happy to hear from you when ever it is convenient to write 
to me. 



LETTEKS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 97 

[P. SJ Mr Felder desires to be remembered to you all. I 
saw Sterling a few days since. He is desirous of instructing 
in a private family; but feels himself at a loss in fixing on a 
sum for tuition money. However should you be desirous of 
obtaining him please to let me know it with the particulars; 
also about what you think you will be willing to give; and I 
will engage him for you. 



To Mrs. Floride Calhoun. c. c. 

Litchfield Con*. 9 th Sep*. 1805. 

D r MADAM, Imediately on the reception of yours in answer 
to my first, 1 hastened, to make a reply, to which, as I have 
received no answer, although it is now a considerable time, I 
apprehend it has never reached New Port. The mention, 
which you made of your indisposition, has made me extremely 
anxious to hear from you; regularly on the arrival of every 
Eastern mail, I have visited the post office, but have uniformly 
hud the mortification of disapointment. Indeed, I know not 
when, I have been so unfortunate in hearing from my friends, 
as I have been, since my arrival here. I have received not a 
scrap of a pen from either Pendleton, or Charleston, although 
I have written to most of correspondents in both of those 
places; and my information from Abbeville is very slight, 
merely that they are all well, and the season has been pleasant. 
About two weeks since, M rs Brown and Lad} 7 Houston and 
family were here on a visit. They spent four or five days in 
this place; and appeared to be much pleased with Litchfield. 
They both enquired particularly of your health. You men- 
tioned that Markley had been in N. Port, and would, in a short 
time, be here; I am much surprised in neither seeing, or hear- 
ing anything of him since. Indeed this is rather an out of 
the way place; and, unless, it is now and then a southerner 
from college, we rarely see any one from our end of Union. 
This, although it diminishes something for our social pleasure, 
yet contributes considerably to our studious habits. I have 
always found, that just in the same proportion as the number 
of friends and acquaintances increases around me, and a con- 
sequent opportunity of various and interesting conversation, 
my attention to my studies has relaxed; but when I have only

three or four, so as to make an agreeable mixture of study 
and social intercourse, then my attention is the most fixed, 
and my exertion the best directed. I have made some enquiry 
for a traveler should }^ou return this fall. I have heard of 
none except Sterling. He mentioned to me that he had a 
strong desire to see the Southern States; and should be vrrv 
happy to accompany you, should you go and should it be 
agreeable on your part. I have given him no encouragement 
to expect; but I know not that you will be able to obtain one 
that will suit you better. He is the same young man of whom 
you have heard me frequently speak. Should you return and 
be able to find one more agreeable, please let me know, us 
soon as, convenient. Remember me to M rs and Miss and M r 
Thurston, and all of my acquaintances in N. Port. Give my 
love to Floride, Elizabeth, John and James. 
[P. S] M r Felder joins his respects to you all.

Litchfield 26 th Sep*. 1805 

D r MADAM, Two days since yours of 14 th Inst was handed 
me, by a gentleman from N. Haven; which, I assure you, 
after so long an interval without hearing from 3^011, afforded 
me no inconsiderable pleasure. You mentioned to me, that 
you have taken your residence in the country a short distance 
from N. Port; and that your health is much recovered. In 
this stept, I think you have acted prudently; for I cannot but 
think the air of the country considerably more saluberious, 
than that of the town; more especially to one in your state 
of health. I hope the beneficial effect of the country air 
will effect a speedy and a full restoration of your health. 
You express your surprise, at the silence of M r Pickens and 
others of your Carolina friends; I, on my part, feel an equal 
astonishment, for though I have writen to most of my 
acquaintances there, I have as yet, received only two letters, 
and neither of them from Abbeville or Pendleton. How to 
account for this' I am very much at a loss. A letter from M r 
Desaussure * accompanied your last; with which I was much 

1 Henry William Desaussure, equity judge and chancellor of South Carolina from 1808 
to 1837 (O'Neall, Bench and Bar, I, 243-252), and one of the most eminent of her jurists. 
He was Mrs, Calhoun's legal adviser; Calhoun studied in his office.

interested. He writes me in a very friendly and engaging 
manner; and expresses himself highly pleased with the 
account, which I gave him of his son at Princeton. 

You express an idea of putting John and James with M r 
Backus 1 at Bethlehem; and request my opinion on that Sub- 
ject. I agree with you, that N. Port is not a very fit place for 
hoys of the age of John and James; and, should you send 
them elsewhere, I know not a fiter place than Bethlehem, or 
a more suitable man than M r Bachcus. The place is small 
and I am informed virtuous; with M r Bachcus, I am not par- 
ticularly acquainted; but he has [torn out] of exemplary 
religion and of extensive learning. You mention, as an 
inducement, that they will be near me; I do assure, that on 
my part I should consider it not only a duty, but a delight 
to pay them particular attention, Should you send them to 
Bethlehem. 

Remember me to my acquaintances in N. Port and p'articu- 
larly to children. M r Felder joins his respects to you and 
family. 

[P. S.] A few days since Messers Danington, Cuningham 
and Markly passed through this place on their tour to the 
uper parts of New York State. I am at present in high 
health; and I think more fleshy than I was last fall. 



To Andrew Pickens* 

Litchfield 24 th No v 1805. 

D" ANDREW, My time is never more agreeably spent, than 
in the perusal of your always interesting and friendly letters. 
The. pleasure received by yours of the 15 th Sep*. was not less 
than ordinary; but, on the contrary, after a long and anxious 
silence on your part, 1 felt myself more than usually inter- 
ested. You do me injustice in supposing your letters intrude 
on my studious disposition; I am not so much in love with 

a Rev. Azel Backus, of Bethlehem, Conn., carried on at this time a successful school 
there. He was afterward the first president of Hamilton College. 

- Andrew Pickens, son of Gen. Andrew Pickens and Rebecca Calhoun, was John C. Cal- 
houn's first cousin. He was graduatedat Rhode Island College in 1801, and was governor 
of South Carolina from 1816 to 1818. For this letter and for subsequent letters addressed 
to Pickens and to his son, Governor Francis W. Pickens, the editor is indebted to Mrs. 
J.E.Bacon.

law as to feel indifferent to my friends. Many things I study 
for the love of study, but not so with law. I can never con- 
sider it, but as a task which my situation forces on me. I 
therefore, often lay it aside for the more delicious theme of 
the muses, or interesting pages of history; and always throw 
it away with joy to hear from my Carolina correspondents. 
But, I confess, from my aversion to law, I draw a motive to 
industry. It must be done, and the sooner the better is often 
my logick. You expected to be examined some time in this 
month. I wish you success; or rather, I hope, ere now I may 
congratulate you on your admission. Your ambition to be 
admitted at this time is both laudable and honourable. It is 
high time for those selfish usurpers on the publick opinion to 
be painted in their true light. It is a work of patriotism and 
justice, and all good men will wish you success; all wise men 
will approbate your motive. For my part, I never could 
think with complacency of some upstarts in that part of the 
State, whose thoughts and lives have been consumed in draw- 
ing down characters whose actions have afforded volumes of 
proof of integrity and wisdom. The work of destruction in 
[which these] 

champions have enlisted required] . . . 
nantice and assiduity, with whfich they] 
are abundantly filled, for comple[te sue] 
cess. They have had their day; [the eyes] 
of the people will be opened. 

Some late arrivals from Europe a[re interesjt- 
ing. War between France and Au[stria] is 
inevitable. Bonapart's speech before the senate on his depart- 
ure from Paris to take command of the army on the Rine; 
and the Austrian manifesto are both published. The former 
full of confidence in victory; the latter apparently moderate, 
but resolute. What will be the event time alone can unfold; 
but I distrust the fortune of the allies. The period is cer- 
tainly eventful. My respects to M rs . Pickens and nry friends in 
Pendleton. [P.S.] Your ^eal I endeavoured to have engraved 
at Phil a but without success; I was told by a gentleman that he 
had tried for some weeks to have his; but could not find an 
engraver. It may be done in New York, but we stayed there 
only part of a day. I have not had since I arrived here a safe 
oppor ty of sending it to N. York. It shall be done and trans- 
mitted to you by the first oppr ty .

D r . MADAM, Before receiving yours of the 12 th Dc r . which 
on many accounts has afforded me the highest pleasure, I 
had concluded in my own mind that you had returned to 
Carolina. For, not having received an answer to my last, 
which I wrote immediately on the reception of yours of the 
14 th of Sep'. , and hearing not a word by any other means I 
was induced to be believe that you had left New Port. To be 
satisfied of this point I wrote to M r . Thurston a few days since 
requesting him to inform me of your return to Carolina. Do 
attribute my long silence to this mistake, rather than to any 
negligence. 

I take great interest in the restoration of your health ; at 
this time of so much importance to your children, while their 
minds are to be instructed in those principles of piety and 
virtue, so necessary to their happiness and usefulness. I 
know your solicitude for their well being; and that it is your 
concern for them which chiefly makes you anxious for your 
own health. With due care, and the assistance of a kind 
providence, I hope you will find your constitution fully con- 
firmed by spring. Nothing, I am sure, will afford greater joy 
to all your friends. How very mild the season has been; the 
climate of New Port must have been charming for some time 
buck. A journey thither would, had I leisure, be extremely 
pleasant to me. I am attached to N. Port on many accounts, 
and desire much to see you all. I dare say, that James has 
forgot his jealous} 7 and would be glad to see me. It is a 
happy circumstance, that M r Patten has opened a school so 
convenient. He is a man 1 much esteem for his many virtues 
and amiable character; and I have no doubt will make a 
excellent instructor. I have had, since I wrote you last, 
several letters from Carolina. They contain nothing very 
interesting. I have enjoyed good health since my residence 
here; and hope to continue it by temperance and exercise. I 
take little amusement; and live a very studious life. This 
place is so much agitated by party feelings, that both M r . 
Felder and myself find it prudent to form few connections in 
town. This, though somewhat disagreeable is not unfavour- 
able to our studies. My love to the children. 

M r Felder joins his respects to you and the children.

Litchfield 19 th Jan y . 1806. 

DEAR MADAM, I am so impatient to hear how the very cold 
weather we have had for some time back agrees with you and 
your family, that 1 write this solely to hasten your answer to 
my last. I cannot think N. Port near so cold as this place, 
which has a very high open situation. If it is, I fear you 
have found, the winter very disagreeably cold. I however 
hope by due attention you will find your health much improved 
notwithstanding the severity of the season. If you have not 
found any serious inconvenience from the weather we already 
have had, I think, you need not fear the remaining part of 
the winter; as this is the coldest month usually. We have 
excellent sleighing here. I was out last evening for the first 
time this season ; and found it very agreeable. It is a mode 
of conveyance that the people of this state are very fond of. 
If you have sufficient snow in N. Port, I dare say you would 
find it in good weather an exercise very conducive to your 
health. 

Do write me how James and Elizabeth bear the cold. 1 
dare say they have never been so rosy and full in the cheeks 
as this winter has made them. 

I have had only one letter from Abbeville since I wrote 
you last. Brother James writes me that it had become very 
health after a very sickly fall. Himself and family have 
been very unwell; but have entirely recovered. None of our 
friends have fallen victims to the fall sickness. How thankful 
we ought to be to the author of good for this high favour. 
Brother William had a fine son a few weeks since. James 
will be on to New York in the summer. I had also a letter 
from Alexander Noble. He expected to leave Charleston in 
a few days for the uper country, and the next summer to 
take a trip through the western country to New Orleans, and 
then by water to New York. M r Felder and myself are both 
in good health, and desire much, should we have leisure, to 
spend a few weeks in N. Port. 

My love to the children. 

M r Felder joins in respects to you.

ure in the restoration of your health; which is so necessary 
to the well being of your children, and so interesting to your 
numerous friends. I confess, I felt much anxiety on your 
account during the very severe weather which we have had 
this winter. I hope by due care, to your health during the 
spring months you will find your constitution compleatly 
restored. You enquire if I have heard from M r Waddel? 1 
I have had one from him since the reception of your last let- 
ter. He has had much sickness in his family; but they are 
all happily restored. He writes me that his preaching has 
had much effect in the congregation which M r Cummins for- 
merly superintended. On this subject he says ' ' I never before 
had so much encouragement to labour in the gospel as there 
at present." His hopes at his other congregation were flat- 
ering; but owing to an unhappy dissension between two of 
its principal members his success has not been so great. 

I receive with gratitude your friendly advice and anxious 
solicitude for my welfare on the all important subject of reli- 
gion. You do me injustice to apprehend that I should receive 
it otherwise than a mark of the purest and highest friendship. 
For surely we can give no higher evidence of our friendship, 
than in endeavouring to promote the best interest of the sub- 
ject of it. Be assured that whatever you may say on this 
head will be kindly received. You observe that it would give 
you satisfaction for me to be with you in N". Port if I could 
pursue my studies with as much advantage there as here. 
Were this possible nothing would be more agreeable to my 
feelings. But in that case I should lose the law lectures here 
wholly; which would be incalculably great to me. 

We have very cold weather at present. The change has 
been great in a few days. You will find great care necessary 
to keep from taking colds during the spring months, owing 
to the frequent and violent changes. More care will be nec- 
essary I apprehend than during the winter.

Litchfield 13 th April 1806. 

D r MADAM, It is so long since I have heard from N. Port, 
that I begin to grow quite anxious to receive a letter from 
that quarter. Though, I have not received an answer to my 
last; I would again have wri ten had I not expected and waited 
to hear from you by each mail. Since my last, I have had 
several letters from Carolina. They contain little particular 
or important. I suppose you have heard of the revival of 
religion in Charleston. I saw a short account of it in a New 
York paper by the last mail. It is an extract of a letter from 
a gentleman in Charleston; mentions that a very great serious- 
ness and attention to religion had diffused itself over the city. 
What a happy change to that place; which in every thing was 
so extremely corrupt; and particularly so inattentive to every 
call of religion. I hope, and think it probable, that this 
happy change will extend itself from the city ta the country. 
Surely no people ever so much needed a reform as those in 
the parishes near Charleston. 

I believe, I mentioned to you that James will come on hither 
in the latter part of June. He is desirous of my returning 
with him; but I have not yet gave him an answer. However, 
as the course of lectures will not conclude till the fall I do not 
think it probable I shall. Do you think of returning in the 
fall? And, if you do, how by land or water? In case of your 
return, I should be happy so to calculate my studies as to suit 
your convenience. I would thank you to let me know as to 
those points in your next. 

What a cold, disagreeable spring we have had. I fear that 
you have experienced some inconvenience from it. But, I 
flatter myself, that it has been more pleasant in N. Port than 
here; as this is a cold, high and open situation. We have not 
as yet any sign of vegetation. Colds have been common. I 
had a very severe one; but of it I am now happily freed. I 
would be happy, were it consistent with my studies to visit

New Port this spring. I make no doubt, 1 should find a visit 
very pleasant with my friends there. But every thing must 
yield to improvement at present. 

[P. S.] Rember me to those of my acquaintance you may 
see. Give m}^ love to Floride, Elizabeth, John and James. 
Tell James I wish to hear him read in the bible very much; 
and that I hope he will learn from it to be a good boy.

D r MADAM, Your last 9 th May was extremely acceptable after 
so long an interval without hearing from New Port. You men- 
tion that your health had not been quite so good during the 
spring as it had been in the winter. This from the badness of 
the weather since Feb y might have been expected; but, I hope 
now, that the summer is on, you will find, as you seem to in- 
timate in the postscript, a full restoration of your health. I 
regret you cannot pay Litchfield a visit. Were it in your 
power, you would find the road hither good; and the country 
agreeable. This place is among the most pleasant towns I 
ever have been in. While the season is pleasant you cannot 
travel too much for your health. I am happy that you have 
obtained a private teacher worthy of discharging the important 
duties of education. I hope, you will find the children much 
benefited by his instructions. It is some time since, I had a 
letter from Carolina except from William. He writes nothing 
particular. Darington, a few days since, paid Litchfield a visit. 
He observed that the accounts of the revival of religion in 
Charleston which appeared in the papers some time since was 
unfounded. Every friend to religion and that place must 
regret it. You mention your expectation of seeing me at New 
Port. In August we have a vacation of three weeks; at which 
time, if nothing intervenes, 1 hope to spend a few days there. 

I saw in one of the Charleston papers an account of the 
marriage of Miss Martin to M r Blanding; the same I suspect 
who was attentive to her sister for whom you recollect she was 
in morning. We expect two students from Charleston in a 
few days; Stroble and Frazer; I believe you are acquainted 
with them. Reber me to my acquaintances in N. Port; and to 
the children.

Litchfield 3 d . July 1806. 

D r MADAM; Since my answer to your last, 1 have received 
letters both from my brother James and Alexander Noble. 
They have relinquished the journey which they contemplated 
some time since to this place. James has thought it best to 
wind up his mercantile business in order to begin anew. This 
demanded his presence in Carolina; and consequently defeated 
his coming on to N. York. Alexander Noble has intirely 
relinquished the business of a merchant for that of a farmer. 
He is connected with his brother Ezekiel in the planting way. 
I cannot but approbate his choice; for, tho' less profitable it 
certainly is more peaceable and favourable to happiness. D r 
Noble has purchased a plantation on Savannah river, with an 
expectation of leaving Charleston in a few years. Since my 
last, we have had the pleasure of seeing M r . Dehone, 1 brother 
and two of his sisters. He was here on Sunday ; and preached 
at the episcopal church. His Sermon was much admired. 1 
have had some expectation of seeing you here, as I think you 
would find traveling conducive to your health; and as the 
road and country hither are agreeable. I have never experi- 
enced so cool a summer as this has been. We have not had a 
day disagreeably warm. Vegetation is now not much more 
forward here than when we left Charleston last year. This 
is owing somewhat to the elevated situation of the place. I 
have a favour to ask of you, which I do with reluctance owing 
to the many I have already received. James who has the 
management of my affairs and on whom I depend for remit- 
tance informed me in his last that owing to his concluding his 
business he will find it more difficult to meet the demands on 
him in Charleston and N. York during the summer than he 
expected; and would therefore find it some what difficult to 
make the summer remittance to me. If you can make it per- 
fectly convenient to supply me till the fall you will oblige 
both my brother and myself. In case you could make it con- 
venient, I will be able to return it during the course of the 
winter. Two hundred dollars will answer my present want. 
If it is not perfectly convenient I hope you will not put your-

Litchfield 11 th Sep r . 1806. 

D r MADAM, After a tedious, and rather a disagreeable jour- 
ney, 1 reach this place, without any material incident, Saturday 
evening. 1 had the pleasure of finding my friends here well; 
and felt a secret satisfaction on returning to a place, in which 
I have spent so many agreeable moments. How quickly we 
become attached to an agreeable residence. I assure you, I 
felt a considerable regret in leaving N. Port; and had I con- 
tinued there much longer at this pleasant season of the year, 
and with so many pleasant acquaintances, I should [have] left 
it with great reluctance.. I always endeavour to- make the 
place 1 reside in agreeable; from a conviction, that it is nec- 
essary to every other enjoyment. I never yet observed a per- 
son to enjoy himself, who was in the habit of declaiming at 
the place, or at those round him. To be satisfied in this par- 
ticular is something more than necessary to other enjoyments; 
it is itself a source of perpetual pleasure. By spreading 
delight on all the objects around us, it fills the soul with a 
secret and continual pleasure. 1 have no expectation of being 
at commencement, as the vacation is up and the lectures com- 
menced. The present subject, on which the judge is lectur- 
ing, is an important one; and I think it my duty to make 
pleasure yield to interest. Rember me to all my acquaintances 
in New Port, particularly to M r and M rs Harvey, M r and Miss 
Thurston, and M r Ward. 

[P. S.] Give my love to the children.

answered your last, in which I mentioned my determination 
to set out in a few days for Carolina by land. I proceeded to 
Philadelphia in the stage, where I purchased a horse and fin- 
ished the remainder of the Journey on horse back, through 
what is generally called the uper rout. In a tour so long, 
without a companion, and a stranger to the road I necessarily 
experienced many solitary hours. My reward was the per- 
petual gratification of curiosity in passing through a country 
entirely new to me, romantick in a high degree, and abound- 
ing with many objects of considerable novelty. On my 
arrival in Carolina I was happy to find all my friends and 
relations well, with only a few instances of slight fall fevers. 
After spending a few weeks in Abbeville I returned to this 
place, where I expect to continue in M r . Desaussure's law 
office till June; at which time I expect to retire to the uper 
country for health; as it will not be safe for me with my 
northern habit to continue in Charleston. Your acquaintances 
here, as far as I know, are well. M r . Macklehaney with his 
family spends the winter in S*. Pauls. He was in Charleston 
a few days since but I did not see him. M r . Pickens is at 
Columbia attending the session of the legislature. I have not 
as yet seen him. It is said he is shortly to be married; I think 
to a M rs Barksdale; sister to Thomas Asby, who is dead. I 
suppose the report is true. Since my arrival here I have been 
very much of a recluse. I board with the French protestant 
Minister M r . Detarguey in Church Street. It is a quiet house 
and answers my purpose well. At Columbia I saw Robert 
Anderson who was applying for admission to the bar at the 
constitutional court. He expects to settle at Grenvill court 
house. It is said, though I am loth to believe it, that his 
father treats him very harshly. He has given him, as yet, 
little or no property; and would not permit him to dwell with 
him in the same house, tho' his son had not then prepared 
himself with one. I was truly sorry to hear it both on account 
of the father and the son. Robert is illy qualified to bear 
such treatment; and it will tend to injure his father's reputa- 
tion so much. It is attributed much to the insinuations of his 
mother in law. Since she is dead, I hope a good understanding 
will take place. I saw M r Harvey a few da} 7 s since he was 
well. Remember me to all acquaintances particularly to Miss 
and M r Thurston.

Abbeville 1 st Oct* 1807. 

D r MADAM, You will believe me, that I feel not a little 
anxiety to hear from you and your family, when I inform you, 
that I have not had a sylable of inteligence concerning you 
since you left Charleston last spring. I attribute this wholly 
to the miscarriage of the mail; for sure am I, that you would 
not have permited so long a time to have passed without 
writing to one, who is ever anxious to hear of your wellfare. 
So little has occured since my last to you, that I am at a loss 
in communicating anything new or interesting. This part of 
our State has been blessed with an extremely healthy summer. 
Not one of your acquaintances that I know of, that has not 
enjoyed good health. I have not had better health for many 
years. A few days since I heard from Seneca. Your friends 
there are all well. We ought to feel thankful for this; more 
especially as in some parts of the state it is said to be uncom- 
monly sickly. The strangers fever is said to be unusually 
fatal this year in Charleston. Every paper from there brings 
a long catalouge of deaths. This is in part no doubt to be 
attributed to the nature of the climate; but a much greater 
part is owing to the misconduct of the inhabitants; and may 
be considered as a curse for their intemfpjerance and debauch- 
eries. 

I have spent on the whole a pleasant summer; and cannot 
but think this part of South Carolina very much improved of 
late; and that it still is in a state of progressive improvement. 
I hope" in a few years, that for society, morals, and informa- 
tion it will be equal to any other part of the United States. 
Providence has given us a fine country, all that is lacking is 
our own exertion. It gives me real pleasure to find Simena- 
ries of learning becoming so respectable and numerous. M r 
Waddel still continues to keep a fine school. He is much 
pleased with the behaviour and progress of your Nephew. 



110 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

He bids fair to make an excellent scholar. Not long since, 1 
attended an examination at M r Waddels with which I was 
much pleased, as the students appeared generally correct and 
well informed. 

[P. S.] Give my love to Floride, Elizabeth, John and James; 
and remember me to all my friends in New Port. Your 
friends here would be much Pleased at your spending the 
winter with your family in this part of S Carolina.

Newbury Court house 6 th April 1809. 

D r MADAM, I regret exceedingly that I cannot carry into 
effect my expectation of visiting Charleston before your 
departure thence. I have received during the circuit a con- 
siderable influx of Chancery business; which as that court sets 
in June it will be impossible without a considerable neglect 
of my professional duties. I consider myself as not a little 
unfortunate in this disapointment; as while you were in the 
up country I had no opportunity excepting amidst the hurry 
of business to spend any time in your company. I should 
have been glad to have conversed with you on many points; 
but we must all submit to those duties which call friends to a 
distance from one another. It is perhaps one of the most 
disagreeable circumstances in our profession, that we cannot 
neglect its pursuit, without being Guilty at the same time of 
imprudence and a breach of confidence, reposed in us by our 
clients. I feel myself now and while I continue in the prac- 
tice of the law almost as a slave chained down to a particular 
place and course of life. I have been very successful on the 
circuit in obtaining business; and doubt not in a short time to 
have as much as 1 can conveniently attend to; however I still 
feel a strong aversion to the law; and am determined to for- 
sake it as soon as I can make a decent independence; for I am 
not ambitious of great wealth. 

Do let me hear from you frequently ; and I on my part will 
promise you not to be a remiss correspondent. 1 wish you a 
pleasant and safe voyage; and that you may find your family

but must submit to necessity. Remember me to all friends.

Abbeville 25 th June 1809 

D r MADAM, After I left you at the plantation, I had a very 
pleasant, tho' solitary journey, to this place. I spent a night 
and a day with M r Shackleford. He is one of those who 
improve on acquaintance; of a liberal hospitable character; 
he seems to live with great ease and happiness in his family. 
At Pine Vile, I spent two days. I had the pleasure of meet- 
ing D r M c Bride and a number of my acquaintances, which 
made my stay delightful. I never was in a place where there 
was more appearant equality and friendship among its inhab- 
itants than in that. I did not see the object of the Doctor's 
affections, as she was gone to Charleston; which was of con- 
siderable regret to him and myself. She has the reputation, 
however, of Toeing handsome; and, which to my mind is of 
much more importance, an amiable fine character. 1 felt a 
delightful sympathy at the prospect of my friend's happy 
establishment in life. It also called up strongly in my mind 
another subject of interest more important to myself. You 
know the one I alude to. It will be useless for me to conceal 
from you my increased anxiety on that subject. The more I 
reflect on it, the more indisoluably does my happiness seem to 
be connected with that event. If, I should finally be disap- 
pointed by any adverse circumstance, which heaven forbid, it 
will be by far the most unlucky accident in my life. I look 
for you next fall without any doubt, and at all events; and 
hope nothing but an impossibility will prevent you; at which 
time, I hope, at least, but still much more, to get rid of my 
anxiety. As to any disclosure if that may be necessary; I 
leave it wholly to your prudence; For I feel that nothing can 
shake my regard. On my return I found it universally 
report[ed] as I conjectured. In fact to me it is quite unac- 
countable how such an impression should become so universal. 
Remember me to all my acquaintances to James and to 
[P. S.] Do make no delay in writing to me. I expect to

Abbeville 18 th July 1809. 

D r MADAM, By the last mail, I received your agreeable let- 
ter of the 18 th Ultimo. 

Except of my hearty thanks for the promptitude of your 
communication; which has releaved my mind from no small 
degree of anxiety. I can scarcely discribe my emotions, when 
I saw your well known hand writing with the New Port post 
mark. But the contrariety of emotions it excited of hope 
and fear quickly subsided into the most agreeable feeling on 
perusing its contents. 

This language does not correspond with my former opinion 
upon this subject. I formerly thought that it would be im- 
possible for me to be strongly agitated in an aifair of this 
kind; but that opinion now to me seems wholly unfounded, 
since, as it were in the very commencement, it can produce 
such effects. Do let me know in your next, at what time in 
the fall 1 may expect you. The time will seem long, and, 1 
hope, you will make your return as soon after the sickly sea- 
son as possible. So unlimited is my confidence in your pru- 
dence and friendship, that to you I make the full and entire 
disclosure of the most inward recesses of my thoughts; while 
to all the world, even to my own brothers, I am quite silent. 
1 have a strong inclination to la}^ open my intention to the 
object of my affection by letter; if this meets with your ap- 
probation, as proper, nothing will prevent me from so doing. 
Will you be so good, as to let me know your sentiment, on 
that point; and whether I may have your assent to such cor- 
respondence. 

I dined with M r Bowie yesterday. M rs Bowie is somewhat 
better than she was. I saw your nephews on the 4 th July. 
They were well. All your acquaintance here are in good 
health. M r Pickens has not passed yet on his way to Pendle- 
ton. I saw M 1 ' Dubon a few days since; he told me your Crop 
looked well tho' it had been dry. Remember me to your 
family and all acquaintances.

which you have ever evinced for my happiness. In this, the 
true criterion of friendship, you have exceed all my friends ; 
;ui (I have ever acted more as a parent than a simple well 
wisher. Never, shall I be able to make you suitable return, 
for so disinterested and generous conduct. 

Oh, may I hope that the time is not far off, when I shall 
stand in a relation to you more congenial to my feelings, than 
which now exists between us. It gives much fond anticipation 
to learn from your letter that you will revisit us next winter; 
and as I hope to take up your permanent residence here. If 
you come by water, do inform me immediately on your arrival 
by letter. If it should be after the twentieth of november 
direct your letter to Columbia; as I shall be there at the last 
of that month. If you return by land it is likely you will 
come to the upper country first. At all events I expect to 
sec you in november or early in december. 

Your friends here are well, and except Wentworth have 
enjoyed good health this fall. He had an attack of the fall 
fever; which I have no doubt he brought on by too much study 
and too little exercise. He is now well; and at Pendleton. 
Our country has been healthy generally. The mail is just 
going so I must conclude.

maxim from which you draw so much of your sperit of resig- 
nation to the various events of this life, '' that all is for the 
best," is in every instance true, yet I am sure that in many 
instances things falling out different from what we would 
have ordered contribute to promote our happiness. This was 
my case the two last days I staid at the Ferry. 1 I spent them 
so pleasantly; and the reflection on them since has been such 
a copious source of gratification and delight, that I feel myself 
richly rewarded for the delay, had it been for weeks. I hope, 
I shall forever find cause to esteem them a fortunate and

happy period of my life. Should it contribute in any degree 
to an event, I have so much at heart, how happy a man shall 
I be. May He who governs all things cause it to eventuate 
so happily! I had fine weather on my return; and my journey 
was only made disagreeable by reflecting on the increasing 
distance of those for whom I have so great a regard. The 
very day after my return proved very cloudy, weat and dis- 
agreeable. I found all of our friends well, except M rs A. 
Pickens; who is at M rs Bowie's in a very low state. I was 
there last night; and think she cannot survive many days. 
Her case is thought to be a consumption. I sent your letter 
to Wentworth the day after my arrival; and expect to be at 
D r Waddel's myself in two or three days. I am anxious to 
hear from the [missing] and hope you have not missed the 
opportunity b'y M r . Milligan. I am very desirous to know if 
you have had any conversation with M r . E. P. and what he 
says. Tell my much esteemed Floride that nothing could pre- 
vent me from the pleasure of writing, but that there is so 
much suspicion on the subject, that I am fearful of the fate 
of a double letter endorsed in my hand writing. 1 hope to 
see you early next month; let it not be, if possible, past the 
midle. I would recommend the road by Gibham's. The road 
from the ferry there is as good and as near as from Charles- 
ton to the same place.

abate my affection, but that absence only proves how much 
my happiness depends on her good opinions.

D r . MADAM, I regret much I could not find a private oppor-

I enquired diligently but could find none; and, on enquiry, 
found the mail could not reach there before the 17 th or eight-

weather. I would have had a lonesone journey, had it not 
been that my thoughts were so much absorbed by that subject 
so important to me; and so near my heart. How important

it is, on that occasion to have the full, and entire sanction of 
our reason; and how delightful it is, that the more I reflect, 
the greater cause I see, to thank that good providence who has 
directed my choice. 1 am not much given to enthusiasm; 
nor to anticipate future happiness. But, I cannot, now refrain 
my hopes of joy. On my part, I feel the most anxious solici- 
tude for the happiness of one, to me dearer than all others; 
on her's, after a careful examination, I find none but those 
qualities in her character, which are suited to me; and are 
calculated to secure lasting enjoyment. Let me add, without 
the least imputation of flattery, that, to be so nearly related 
to yourself, is a fruitful source of happiness. I know not 
why, from my first acquaintance with you at New-Port, I 
have loved you as a mother. Sure am I, that I could not 
from a mother experience more kindness and tender affection. 
With the blessing of God I cannot but be happy; when every 
circumstance is so propitious. If possible, I will be in New 
Port next fall. I wish much that Floride would consent to 
that time. I will write to her about it, by my next. I think 
on many accounts it will be the best. If you know her senti- 
ment I would be glad you would let me know in your next, 
for it will be a great inducement for me to go on, if she 
agrees to that time; and what is a matter of importance, will 
furnish a good excuse for my leaving my professional business 
at the fall court. Write me immediately, on receiving this. 
I will be very anxious till I hear of your safe arrival. 1 start 
to Laurens tomorrow morning to attend the court of Equity 
there. Remember me to Elizabeth if she is with you, to 
James and John when you see him; also to all friends.

D r . MADAM, Yesterday I received yours dated the 16 th in

Floride; the more so, as the season is far advanced, and must 
be attended with considerable hazard to both of you. I was 
apprehensive, that you would be detained till too late a period;

but it gives me pleasure to think that you have taken your 
passage direct to New-Port; and in the vessel you prefered. 
Your party cannot fail to contribute to the pleasure of the 
voyage; yet 1 greatly fear that you have had a very disagree- 
able and rough one. For, since the time you were to have 
embarked, the wind has been almost invariably to the east, 
accompanied with much rain and thunder. We have had near a 
week of incessant rain. Savannah river and most of the other 
streams have been out of their banks; which has done no in- 
considerable damage. 

I left D r . Waddel's two days ago. M rs . Boisseau and your 
two nephews were then well. Wentworth still continues to 
apply himself too closely. His constitution is not suffeciently 
strong for the exertions which he makes. 

1 am glad you mentioned the subject, so near my heart, to 
M r . Desaussure. It always struck me it would be proper to 
do so, and I should have mentioned it myself, if you had not. 
I am convinced he is a friend to both of us. You mention 
that "he will have some conversation with me on the sub- 
ject." This makes me doubly anxious to see him, for what- 
ever has the least relation to it arrests my attention. Whatever 
comes from the judge shall receive from me a serious consid- 
eration. I am sure it will be the dictate both of friendship 
and prudence. I consider him a man of great discretion. I 
will write you as soon as we have had the conversation; which 
cannot now be long. I wrote to you inclosing a letter to 
Floride on the 12 th Instant, which I directed to New-Port. I 
hope you will find it on your arrival. I am with every senti- 
ment of esteem . . ... 

Remember me to James, Elizabeth, if with you, and all

1 have not yet seen the Judge, but by the last mail I had a 
letter from him dated at Columbia requesting me to meet

him at Greenville, but I was so unfortunate as not to receive 
it till the day appointed for the meeting. So that all the 
anticipated pleasure of travelling through so pleasant a part 
of our State and with so pleasant a companion was defeated. 
1 expect the Judge here in a few days and shall be punctual 
in writing to } r ou. I have been looking out for some weeks 
past for a place to purchase so as to establish myself perma- 
nently for life. I was desirous of purchasing on the Savannah 
river near my relatives, but I find only one place for sale 
there and that at a price nearly double its value. At present 
I have a place near my brother Patrick's. 1 It is a valuable 
one and as pleasant as any in that part of the State. 2 If I 
purchase I ma} 7 commence building immediately, but perhaps 
it will be best to postpone building till some time next winter, 
for should the event I have so much at heart take place next 
winter according to present arrangements and I should be 
elected to Congress next fall, of which I suppose there is no 
doubt, both my own inclination and the health of Floride 
would require the following summer to be spent in travel. 
It would scarcely be worth while to commence housekeeping 
for so short a time, especially as 1 should not be able to 
return to Carolina till the summer after, owing to the session 
of Congress. By postponing building 1 shall be able to con- 
sult yours and Floride's taste. Let me know your opinion 
on this point. 



To Mrs. Ihloride Callioun? 

Abbeville 27 th July 1810. 

D r MADAM, I think you will not call me a negligent corre- 
spondent, as I have wrote to you regularly once a fortnight 
since my return to St. John's. I formerly was considered 
the most indolent in letter writing; all my friends have cen- 
sured me for that fault. But, now it is my delight. I could 
write you by every mail, were I not apprehensive -of fatiguing 
you by such frequent communications. Time hangs heavily 
on my hands; tho' I endeavor to make it pass as pleasantly as 
possible by close application. I have not read so intensely

since I commenced to practice law; as I have this summer. 
Yet it is impossible to divert my thoughts from her on whom 
they naturally concentrate. Nor do I desire so to do; were 
it possible; for tho', the thought of so long an absence and so 
great a distance makes me pensive; yet it is of a pleasant 
kind. It is a sweet pain. Could I suppose that she was of 
a fickle character I should be wretched. But there I am happy ; 
my trust in her constancy is extreme. The more I dwell on 
her good qualities; and compare her with others of her sex, 
the stronger does my reason approbate the choice of my affe< - 
tion; the more devoutely do 1 thank that good providence, who 
has crowned my wishes with success. Heaven has been kind 
to me in many instances; but I will ever consider this as the 
greatest of its favors. 1 know much happiness, or much 
misery is the consequence of marriage. As far as the former 
can be secured by prudence, by similarity of character and 
sincerity of love, I may flatter myself with no ordinary share 
of bliss. 

I had a letter from D r Noble yesterda}^. He mentions your 
saling at the time appointed. This surprises me the more, 
that I have not heard from you. A letter is only seventeen 
days from Newport to this place. You I fear must have had 
a long passage. How impatient 1 am to hear from you. The 
next mail, I feel, will bring me a letter. I have not yet seen 
Judge Desaussure. 1 know not what detains him. It may 
be he will not be here till Doctor Waddel's exehibition, which 
is on the 14 th next month. Andrew Pickens was here last 
week. He left his daughter with M rs Bowie. They are all 
well in Pendleton. All friends here are well. Remember me 
to James and tell him 1 will be glad he would write to me. 

[P. S.J D r Noble does not mention Elizabeth sailing with 
you. From that I suppose you left her. If she is with you 
give my best respects to her; and tell her if she will except of 
my offer to correspond I would take much pleasure in writing 
to her.

Abbeville 7 th Sep r 1810. 

DEAR MADAM, 1 join with you in expression of gratitude 
to that good providence, who has so mercifully preserved the 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 119 

life of one so dear to our future hopes and happiness. The 
perusal of your letter filled me with joy and sympathy at the 
same time. Joy for her preservation; and sympathy for the 
}>;iin she must have endured. How often and unmerited do 
we experience the kind interference of heaven! Had her life 
not been spared, how inconsolable would have been our con- 
dition! I know not where I should have look for relief. On 
her all my hopes concentrate. I hope by this time she has 
entirely recovered. No care, that a fond mother's solicitude 
could bestow, has been wanting, I dare say, to effect a speedy 
and entire cure. 

By the last mail, I had a long answer from Judge Desaus- 
sure, to a letter I had addressed him as soon as I heard of his 
return to Charleston. He is pleased to express himself in 
very flattering terms of me; and to give his entire approba- 
tion to the contemplated connection. I am not only happy in 
the love and esteem of } T our daughter; but in the concurring 
assent of all our mutual friends. This swells the cup of bliss 
to the full. I, in every event of my life, seem to myself more 
fortunate, than I deserve. How shall I be sufficiently grate- 
full ? Judge Desaussure mentions the settlement of Floride's 
property. I know "not, but that it will be indelicate in me to 
express my opinion on that subject. The fortune is her's. 
I am not directed in my choice by it. Yet, 1 think it a duty, 
that 1 owe to yourself and Floride to be perfectly candid on 
all points. From prejudice, or reason, 1 have been always 
opposed to marriage settlements. I think experience and reason 
prove them to be unfriendly to the happiness of the marriage 
state; and, that they tend to produce pecuniary embarresment. 
In that state there should be one interest, one happiness and one 
destiny. That entire confidence, which is reposed by a female 
in the object of her choice, in placing both her honor and her 
property in his custody give rise to the most sacred and ten 
der regard. A marriage settlement implys a distrust. It is 
no safety against inevitable accident. It is a guard against 
the imprudence, or misconduct of the husband only. As far 
as children are concerned, it places them above the dependence 
of the parents. Nothing can be more unfriendly to their gov- 
ernment, or character. As to property, it often tends to pre- 
vent farther accumulation; and prevent an extrication at the 
commencement of an embarresment. If successful in life, 



120 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

there is no benefit in one; if unsuccessful, what more disa- 
greeable than to have property, but not to be able to pay just 
debts? It would to me, be wretched. It would be splendid 
poverty. You have my candid sentiment; dictated, not by 
selfish views, but a regard to our mutual happiness. It is my 
duty to give it. I find it impossible for me to leave Abbeville 
before sometime in Nov r . It will then be too late to visit New 
Port. It is a painful necessity to me. Do let me know im- 
mediately when you expect to leave N. Port; and whether you 
w r ill return by land, or water. If you return by land and can 
make arrangement for me to meet } r ou I will on my part be 
happy so to do. I hope you will return as soon as the season 
will permit. I never was so anxious to see Floride and your- 
self. 



To Mrs. Floride Calhowi. c. c. 

Abbeville 13 th Sep r 1810 

DEAR MADAM, I know not how to express my gratitude for 
that almost maternal regard, which you have always exercised 
towards me. Such is the warmth of affection, which, I feel 
towards you, that 1 can scarcely refrain from addressing you 
by the endearing epithet of mother. I hope the time now 
will not be long, when I may with propriety use it. That 
day, which will put me in that endearing relation towards 
you will be the happiest of my life. In yours of the 20 th of 
August, which I received yesterday, you observe, "that should 
it be the will of the Almighty to unite me to Floride that you 
only wish, she may make me as happy as I deserve". In that 
event it will be mine to make her happy. Should I always 
remain with my present feeling, which I trust in God I may, 
no task will be half so sweet to me, as to make her, as happy, 
as the conditions of this life will permit. I have no doubt, 
Floride will be actuated with similar feelings towards me. 
This mutual love must constitute the joy of the marriage state. 
To be united in the sacred bonds of matrimony; to regard one 
another, as companions mutually united for mutual happiness, 
for each to place their greatest joy in the happiness of the 
other, is to my mind the most enviable condition on earth. 
O that our married life may so commence so continue and so 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 121 

end! And that you, our dear mother, may long continue to 
live, to enjoy and participate in our happiness. Your account 
of the almost entire restoration of Floride from the effect of 
her bruises was very welcome. I felt much anxiety on that 
subject. I was fearful, particularly, that she would not 
recover the use of her finger. This would have been a great 
misfortune to us both. Your letter before the last gave me 
the first information of the accident. To that letter, 1 wrote 
an answer by the last mail. 1 mentioned in my last, that it 
would not be possible for me to visit N. Port this fall. My 
regret at this necessity is still the greater since you mentioned 
in your last that it is Floride's wish to return by land. Neither 
convenience, nor profit should prevent me from going; but I 
found, as court approached, that my duty to be here to discharge 
the trusts reposed in me b}^ my clients was imperious. 1 hope 
that it will meet with your's and Floride's approbation. * If I 
were to advise you, I would recommend you to return by 
water. As I shall cease issuing business after this fall, I shall 
have leisure to accompany you by land hereafter. Which ever 
way you determine, 1 hope you will be here by the midle of 
Nov r . If you conclude to come by water I shall be in Charles- 
ton by the 20 th of that month, at fartherest. Your friends 
here are all well. It blows almost a storm at this moment. 
I fear much damage is done on the coast. Remember me to 
M rs Banister, D r . Dehone 1 , John Ewing if with you, and 
James. Also to all friends.

I rejoice, my dearest Floride, that the period is fast ap- 
proaching when it will be no longer necessary to address you 
through the cold medium of a letter. At furthest it cannot 
be much longer than a month before I shall behold the dearest 
object of my hopes and desires. I am anxious to see you and 
my impatience daily increases. May heaven grant you a safe

return. What pleasure I have experienced in your company, 
what delight in the exchange of sentiment, what transport in 
the testimonies of mutual love. In a short time this with the 
permission of heaven will be renewed, and I shall be happy. 
To be united in mutual virtuous love is the first and best bliss 
that God has permitted to our natures. My dearest one, may 
our love strengthen with each returning day, may it ripen 
and mellow with our years, and may it end in immortal joys. 
It gives me much satisfaction that time and absence make no 
impression on my love for you; it glows with no less ardour 
than at the moment of parting, which must be a happy omen 
of its permanent nature. When mere personal charms at- 
tract, the impression may be violent but cannot be lasting, 
and it requires the perpetual presence of the object to keep 
it alive; but when the beauty of mind, the soft and sweet 
disposition, the amiable and lovable character embellished 
with innocence and cheerfulness are united to the attractions 
of personal beauty, it bids defiance to time. Such, my dear 
Floride, are the arms by which you have conquered, and it is 
by these the durability of your sovereignty is established 
over your subject whom 3 r ou hold in willing servitude. 

I am much involved in business at present. Court com- 
mences in two weeks, and in a week the election for Congress 
will take place. My opponent is Gen. Elmore of Laurens, 1 
but it is thought that I will succeed by a large majority. As 
soon as the result is known I \vill inform you. Write me 
before you leave New Port. I wish you a pleasant journey 
home. May God preserve you. Adieu my love; my heart's 
delight.

Columbia a few days since, I had the pleasure to find her in good 
health and sperits. She looks I think better than when you

her condition. We return to the country to morrow by way 
of Christ Church. May and Jane Brighton both accompany 
us. I shall return myself to this place about the 20 th when 
I hope at fartherest we shall here from you. M r Pickens and 
family arrived in town last evening. They are well. The 
last evening Floride, M r Brighton's family and M r Pickens 
and Elizabeth went to the theatre. Floride is not at all 
pleased; and feels no inclination to renew her visit there. I 
was pleased to see that her good sense prevented her from 
being dazzled by the glare of novelty. I hope my dear 
mother you had a pleasant voyage; and that you on your 
arrival had the pleasure of finding your son quite restored. 
We anxiously expect your return this summer. 

Floride gives her love to you and John Ewing. Remember 
me to him and all acquaintances.

MY DEAR MOTHER. Since my arrival here I have had the 
pleasure of perusing yours of the 11 th instant to Floride. 
Your safe arrival at New-Haven and the restoration of John's 
health both afford the sincerest pleasure. His recovery is 
almost a merical. Few have been restored to health from so 
low a condition. The very kind attention which he seems to 
have received while in his sickness must be highly pleasant to 
you. Your daughter still remains in good health and sperits. 
I left her at M r Pickens. we shall start for the upper coun- 
try in a few days. M rs Sterling goes with us. We expect 
to go by the way of Pine-V ille and Columbia. The division of 
property in the lower country has been made. It will also be 
made in the upper as soon as M r Pickens goes up. I dined 
with Judge DeSaussure yesterday he informed me he would 
transmit $600 to you today. You do not mention at what 
time we may expect your return; we hope as soon as possible. 
The rice dam gave away a few days since near the old breach 
The breach is a very bad [one], and will be difficult to stop.

Washington 21 st Dec r 1811. 

DEAR MOTHER, I received last week your affectionate letter 
of the 20 th of the last month. It came the same day with 
Florides; tho' hers is dated on the 26 th . It contained the first 
direct information I had from home; and relieved me from a 
load of anxiety. I left Floride and our little son at so critical 
a period, that I almost felt an alarm at hearing from home for 
fear that all was not well.. 1 feared that her anxiety of mind 
at my leaving -her might injure her health; situated as she was; 
and I am sure 1 have great cause to be thankful that she has 
entirely recovered. I am as comfortably fixed here as I could 
be; and have nothing to render me uneasy but my solicitude 
for those I have left behind. Our society is delightful. This 
place is quite gay, during the session; but 1 do not partici- 
pate in it much myself. You know I never had much inclina- 
tion to such enjoyment. 1 am invited to a ball to the French 
minister's 2 on monday next; and to dine with him on Christ- 
mas day; but for political reasons have declined his invitation. 
I do not think at this time when a war is expected with Eng- 
land that much intimacy should exist with the minister of her 
rival; particularly as our oponents accuse us with partiality 
towards France. 

I hope you will impress on Floride the necessity of taking 
sufficient exercise when the weather will permit. Nothing is 
so conducive to health; and 1 think she is rather disinclined to 
it. Let me hear from you often. I shall not be backward in 
answering tho' I have a great man} 7 letters to write. Remem- 
ber me to the family and all friends.

able opinion of him from the kindness which he had bestowed 
on your brother when sick. 

I wrote you but a few days since, and have nothing- farther 
to communicate now. The weather is very mild and spring 
like this morning. 

I Dreamed all night the last night of being home with you; 
and nursing our dear son; and regreted when I awoke to find 
it a dream. I was in hopes that the morning's mail would 
bring me a letter from you; but was disapointed. It is near 
a month since 1 had one. I learned by a letter from Mr. 
Pickens a few days since that you were all well.

D r MOTHER, I am induced to write to } r ou more from that 
sentiment of respect and affection which I hope ever to enter 
tain for you, than any particular information which I wish to 
communicate. My esteem for you has rather been strength- 
ened, than abeated, by the present intimate tie which through 
our dear Floride and little Andrew subsist between us. Your 
deportment long before our connection was such as to merit 
my warmest affection. Floride's letter to me mentions the 
tine health of Andrew and his disposition to feed. I think it 
would be advisable for her to wean him as soon as possible. 
You however will be the best judge. I fear to continue him 
longer at the breast will be neither for his or her health. 

If Floride bears my absence as badly as I do hers, she must 
occasionally be very impatient. I know you will not fail to 
keep her as cheerful as possible. I often look forward with 
impatience for the time of my return. 

I expect we shall have a warm and important Session. We 
shall have to encounter every impediment that opposition 
can throw in the way. 

If rice is a good price I would advise you to sell. The 
present prospect is in favour of its keeping up and being 
high; but the commercial world is at present so uncertain, 
that no one can anticipate the change. I would be glad to 
hear from you.

MY DEAREST FLORIDE, By D" Casey's letter of yesterday, 
1 had the pleasure to hear of your safe delivery of a daughter; 
and that you had comparitively easy times. I had been waiting 
anxiously for mail day in expectation of such an event; and 
you may imagine the relief and joy it afforded me to hear not 
only of your safety, but the addition to our family. For 
both of your safety, 1 have all the fond wishes of a parent 
and an husband. 1 hope your mother till you are sufficiently 
recovered, will be punctual in writing every mail; as my anx- 
iety will be encreased to hear from you. 

As to the na*me, any one that you and your mother think 
proper will please me. It is a subject on which, 1 have no 
great choice; but my inclination would be to call her by the 
name which you and your mother bear. 

1 think there will be an early adjournment; and am satisfied 
at least that the session will not be a long one. I hope Nance 
continues faithful to his duty, both about the house and plan- 
tation. I am glad to hear that the apple trees are planted. 

Do let M c Gehee have his money as soon as possible. 

Andrew appears to be forgot. None of the letters home 
for some time mention a word of him. 1 hope he is doing 
well. Kiss him for me. Rmber me to our Mother and all

I think the price of cotton will again rise. There is no 
doubt of a great failure on the Mississippi. The consumption 
of cotton in our own factories is estimated at 100,000 bales, 
which must be more than one third of the quantity produced.

The fall in England seems to me to have risen from temporary

me. I value it at $100. The plated harness costing $20,

The opinion of the naval offices is that the Wasp is not lost. 
They think that the reportd engagement between her and the 
British frigate that went into Lisbon in so shattered a condi- 
tion cannot be true; as she was not at that time in those seas. 
Their impression is that the engagement was with a privateer 
and that the Wasp is in the Pacifick ocean. 1 trust it may be

DEAR JOHN, 1 regret that your departure from this place 
was so sudden as not to give me an opportunity of seeing you; 
and tho', it has afforded me extreme delight that the just and 
necessary war which we have been compeled to wage with 
England has been brought to a termination so advantageous 
and glorious to our country, yet I would have been much 
pleased if you could have had an opportunity of acquiring that 
honor which 1 am confident you would, had the war taken 
another campaign. The most active means had been put in 
operation to reduce the Canadas the next summer, and I be- 
lieve, with such officers and soldiers as we have they would 
have succeeded. 

As to your future course; my advice would be not to con- 
tinue in the army during peace, but 1 would not resign. The 
probability is that the military establishment will be much 
reduced; and it is proposed to give every captain who will be

thrown out by such reduction 640 acres of land and three 
months pay. If you should resign, you would loose this com- 
pensation, which the country thinks fit to give to those who 
have served her. You had better write to the Secretary at 
War that you had entered the service of the country, with an 
intention to render what service you could during the war, 
and that it was not your desire to continue in during peace, 
and that you would desire to be ranked among those officers, 
who would be put out of service by the reduction of the army.

MY DEAR MOTHER, Floride wrote to you by M r Shacklef ord 
that all w T ere well. We at that time little calculated that in 
three days, we should experience the heaviest calamity that 
has ever occured to us. It is no less than the death of our 
interesting and dearest daughter. 1 She was in the bloom of 
health on Wednesday morning the 6 th inst. and was a corps 
the next day. She was taken with a vomiting and fever very 
suddenly about eleven o'clock and died about an hour by sun 
the next morning. W r e suspected no danger till about mid- 
night and even then except a wildness in her eyes the sym- 
toms wore not very distressing. We became much alarmed 
about day; and sent off a dispach for D r Casey but he was 
gone to Augusta. Everything was done which we thought 
could be of service but in vain. Thus early was [snatched?] 
from us in the bloom of life, our dear child whom providence 
seemed, but a few hours befon , to destine to be our comfort 
and delight. So healthy, so cheerful, so stought; every prog- 
nostick of health and long life She had just begun to talk and 
walk; and progressed so fast in both as to surprise every one. 
She could hardly step when I returned on the 20 th of March 
and before her death she could run all over the house. But 
why should I dwell on these once flattering appearances? She 
is gone alas! from us forever; and has left behind nothing but 
our grief and tears. So fixed in sorrow is her distressed 
mother that every topick of consolation, which I attemp to 
offer but seems to grieve he: 1 the more. It is in vain I tell

her it is the lot of humanity; that almost all parents have 
suffered equal calamity; that Providence may have intended 
it in kindness to her and ourselves, as no one can say what, 
had she lived, would have been her condition, whither it^ 
would have been happy or miserable; and above all we have 
the consolation to know that she is far more happy than she 
could be here with us. She thinks only of her dear child; 
and recalls to her mind every thing that made her interesting, 
thus furnishing additional food for her grief. 

We will expect you up as soon as your business will per- 
mit. Floride desires her love "to you. Our respects to all 
friends.

MY DEAR WIFE, I arrived at this place yesterday, having 
performed the journey in a shorter time than what I expected 
by several days. At Raleigh in North Carolina 1 met with 
John Taylor 2 which as it afforded company made the journey 
more pleasant. The last 53 miles is performed by a steam 
boat; nothing can be superior to that mode of conveyance 
whether we regard the safety, ease or expedition of traveling. 
You are moved on rapidly without being sensible of it. I 
hope by another session there will be one from Charleston to 
the place. 

The more I reflect on it, I am the better satisfied you ought 
to go to Charleston at the time of your labour. St. John's 
appears to me to be very inconvenient. I will write to D r . 
M c Bride to attend to you; and I am certain that he will omit 
nothing that his skill and attention can contribute to make 
your time safe and easy. I hope Andrew has lost his fever. 
I should feel much anxiety for him if it should continue after 
the Winter fairly sets in. I would fear that he would not get 
clear of it till spring. Do not fail to write by every mail. I 
am anxious to hear from you all. Remember me affection- 
ately to your mother and brothers. Kiss our dear son for 
me and tell him how much his father loves him.

DEAR JAMES, It afforded myself, your sister and all of your 
friends great pleasure to hear of your safe arrival at Norfolk. 
Your being on board the Congress gave her cruise a great 
additional interest with us all; and the occasional notice which 
the papers took of her were read with much avidity. You 
have indeed been fortunate, both in getting on board of a 
frigate, and being placed under the command of so accom- 
plished a seaman as Cap Morris. 2 I hope and believe that your 
personal merit has in some degree contributed to put you in 
so elegible a situation. I called on }^our Uncle Norris on the 
subject of remittance, as I know you must feel a considerable 
anxiety in relation to it. He thinks it unsafe to send by mail 
as there are so many miscarriages by it; and as it is uncertain 
whether you would be at Norfolk by the time the remittance 
might arrive; and therefore thinks it more advisable to send 
the money by me. I will be at Washington by the first Dec r . 
and you can draw on me for it, or if you can get a furlough 
come on to Washington. Your sister and the children go 
with me. They have both been unwell but are now better. 
Our State has been very unhealthy this autumn; but no deaths 
have taken place among your relations; except Col. Calhoun 
and General Pickens. 3 The latter died suddenly of an apo- 
plexy in August last. No other changes have occurred. Your 
mother and M rs Miller are with us and are both well. Your 
mother is much hurt that you have not mentioned her in your 
letter; and she and M rs M. desire to be mentioned to you 
affectionately. As I expect to see you at Washington in 51 
short time I will abstain from writing a long letter. Andrew 
says he wishes to see you very much; and often talks of your 
fighting John Bull. Your sister says you must be sure to 
come to Washington, as she is very anxious to see you. Your 
Uncle Norris and all of your friends desire to be remembered 
to you. Give my respect to Cap*. Morris. There is none of

the prosperity of this country, and the reputation of your

Chester Ct. house 15 th Nov r 1817. 

DEAR MOTHER, We arrived here this evening; and as I am 
certain you would be anxious to hear from us frequently, 1 
cannot admit the opportunity of the Columbia mail going out 
in the morning without writing. We have thus far met with 
not the least accident; and the children stand traveling much 
better, and are far less troublesome than we expected. The 
child's health is evidently better; and Andrew's chill to day 
was not so severe as the preceding one; tho I think his fever 
was nearly the same. His appetite seems to be improving. 
We have made thus far 30 miles a day with ease, both to our- 
selves and the horses, tho the roads, particularly to day, are 
much the worst on the whole journey. The horses prove 
very true, except Jake, in going down hill, where it is very 
steep, is some times a little unruly. We are much better 
pleased with Hector as a driver than what we expected to be; 
in fact Floride's confidence in his driving is completely 
restored. 1 hope the children's health will be daily improv- 
ing and the rest of the journey will prove as safe as the past. 
Floride joins in expression of affection both to yourself and 
M. Miller, whose kindness we will long remember. Remem- 
ber us to John E. the Gov r . and all friends.

War Depar*. 20 th Dec r . 1817 

DEAR JOHN, I have been waiting for some time to hear 
from you, but suppose that you are so much engaged with 
your new settlement that you cannot find leisure. I shall 
wish the collection for our Sal r . 1 lands to be as considerable 
as possible, for I find that living here will be much more 
expensive than what I expected. I am but temporarily fixed 
yet, with M r . Lowndes, 2 In the Spring 1 must make my 
arrangement for permanent residence here. Hiring Servants 
and buying furniture will take a very considerable sum. J 
will be out with my family in the latter part of spring, and 
must put myself in funds to meet the expenses. My crop 
this year from a great variety of causes is greatly shortened. 
I do not make a half crop. If you can get what you may 
consider a good offer for my share of the land I would have 
no objection to sell. 

James has sailed in the Congress with our commissioners. 3 
I did not see him, but had a letter from him. He is well 
and is much pleased thus far with the sea. 

The children have at length quite recovered. 

I wish you to call, as soon as you can, at the Southern 
Patriot's office and settle my bill there and discontinue my 
paper. Let me hear from you soon. Your sister desires 
her love to you. Andrew says he wishes to see you much. 
Remember me affectionately to your mother and M r . Miller, 
if they should be in the lower country and to D r . Noble and 
all friends.

mitted to me, is a petition to Congress, which I have put into 
the hands of Mr. Lowndes, to be presented. It * appears to 
me that his claim is a just one; and that Congress will prob- 
ably grant him the relief prayed for. I will retain his papers 
till his case is acted on. Every care will be taken of them. I 
avail myself of this occasion to express the high esteem and 
veneration, which I entertain for your publick [services ?] and 
private character. It is my sincere wish, that you may long 
continue in the full possession of your health and faculties to 
enjoy the gratitude of the nation. 



To John Williams. 1 

Department of War, 5 th Feb y . 1818. 

SIR, I have given to the enclosed resolutions of the Senate, 
all of the attention which their importance demands, and my 
other engagements would admit. Feeling as I do the import- 
ance of a well organized staff, I regret that want of minute 
knowledge in relation to it, which would enable me to state my 
ideas with greater decision, both as to the present system, and 
such amendments as it may be susceptible of. 

If the Committee should think that so much of the act of 
1816, as creates the offices of Hospital Surgeons and Hospital 
surgeon's mates, and judge advocates, ought to be repealed, I 
would respectfully suggest the propriety of creating in lieu of 
them, the offices of Surgeon general and Judge Advocate gen- 
eral. I have already offered to you my ideas in relation to 
them, in conversation, and now will only briefly restate them. 
The medical staff at present is without responsibility; and must, 
I conceive, remain so 'till its duties are brought to a centre. 
To introduce responsibility it should be the duty of the sur- 
geons of the Army, to make quarterly return of the manner 
in which they have performed their duties. These returns 
ought among other particulars, to contain a list of the sick, 
their disease, the prescriptions and issues of medical stores. 

1 Hon. John Williams, chairman of the military committee of the Senate. From the 
" Reports to Congress" in the Department of War, No. 1; text from a copy furnished by 
the Department. 



134 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

It must be apparent that there ought to be a medical character 
of eminence, to report to the Head of the Department on these 
returns. It is thus that the character of each surgeon in the 
Army will come to be known, and important checks imposed 
on the improper consumption and waste of the medical stores. 
It is not to be doubted that the public sustains great losses for 
the want of such a system. The Judge advocate general would 
be the adviser of the Department, in all cases touching martial 
laws; and would in important trials be ordered to act as Judge 
advocate. It seems to me, the importance of such an office is 
apparent when we reflect, that points of the most difficult char- 
acter are involved in the decisions of courts martial, and that 
those decisions may involve the life of a fellow citizen. 

The Quarter master's Dep*. may, I conceive, be rendered 
more simple and efficient. I would suggest the propriety of 
one quarter master general, with one deputy for each division, 
and as many assistants as the same may require. No branch 
of the general staff is more important or difficult to be man- 
aged than the quarter master's; none requires more eminently 
the controul of a single and responsible head. I would also 
respectfully suggest, that in the dispersed condition of the 
Army, the chaplains might be dispensed with, without injury 
to the service, except the one at West Point. I know of no 
farther retrenchments, that would not impair the efficiency of 
the Staff. 



To Thontm A. Smith. 1 

Department of War, March 16 th , 1818. 

SIR, In order to extend and protect our trade with the 
Indians, it has been determined to establish a permanent mili- 
tary post at the mouth of the Yellow stone river. You will 
take immediate and efficient measures to carry it into effect. 
The strength of the detachment, the means of transporta- 
tion, the supplies of provisions, are left wholly under your 
controul. You will consult with his excellency governor 
Clark, 2 in relation to the country, with its capacity to supply

the ninth department; addressed at St. Louis, Missouri Territory. Letter from Military 
Book No. 10 in the archives of the Department of War; text from an official copy. 

2 William Clark, governor of the Missouri Territory, famous for his connection with 
the Lewis and Clark expedition. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 135 

the wants of the detachment, the navigation of the river, 
the force and disposition of the tribes of Indians in that 
quarter, in order to enable you to make your arrangements 
in such manner as may be best calculated to effect the object 
in view. To enable you to make the detachment required, 
without weakning too much your other posts, orders have 
been given to march at least two hundred recruits enlisted in 
Pennsylvania and Ohio, for the 3 d and 5 th . These will be 
transferred, on their arrival at St. Louis, and attached to the 
rifle regiment. The details for the service will be communi- 
cated to you through the adjutant and Inspector general. 
The ordnance department will be directed to furnish four 
pieces of light ordnance, with such munitions and military 
stores as the expedition may require. The general of divi- 
sion is advised of these measures, and you will allow of no 
delay for further orders thro 1 him. 

It is probable, that the lateness of the season will prevent 
the detachment from reaching the post contemplated, this 
summer; and in that event, as intermediate posts will prob- 
ably be required, it will take post at the Mandan village, 1 or 
at such other point as may be thought advisable. 

The post contemplated being very remote, and on that 
account, exposed in its supplies, to many accidents and dan- 
gers, it will be necessary after this year, that it should have 
the means of supply within itself. The reported fertility of 
the country in that neighbourhood, and the abundance of 
game, will render this measure, dictated by prudence, very 
easy. You will draw on this department for such expendi- 
tures as the nature of the service may render necessary. 

You will instruct the officer who may be detailed to com- 
mand the detachment, to use every means to conciliate the 
Indians, and impress on them the belief, that our intention is 
friendly towards them. It is expected the English traders 
will take unusual pains to make a contrary impression. They 
have great advantages in controuling the savages thro' their 
commanding station on Red river; and as our contemplated 
establishment at Yellow Stone, will greatly curtail their trade 
towards the head of the Missouri, we must expect every 
opposition from them. No pains must be spared to counter-

act such efforts, and to do this, you are authorised to pur- 
chase such goods at St. Louis, as may be thought proper, not 
exceeding in value three thousand dollars, to be distributed 
in presents to the Indians. 

The remoteness of the post will, in some respects, render it 
unpleasant to those who may be detailed for the service; but 
I am persuaded that the American soldier, actuated by the 
spirit of enterprize, will meet the privations which may be 
necessary with cheerfulness. Combined with the importance 
of the service, the glory of planting the American flag at a 
point so distant, on so noble a river, will not be unfelt. The 
world will behold in it the mighty growth of our republic, 
which but a few years since, was limited by the Alleghany; 
but now is ready to push its civilization and laws to the western 
confines of the continent. 



To Charles J. Ingersoll.^ 

War Dept 4th August 1818 

DEAR SIR, I understood from the President previous to his 
leaving this, he had written to you on the subject of our 
Florida affairs. The operations of General Jackson, in that 
quarter, presented some very complicated and delicate ques- 
tions. It, however, affords much pleasure to observe the 
acquiescence of publick opinion, in that course, which the 
Administration thought it its duty to persue. My opinion 
always has been that an open, manly, and honest attachment 
to truth and justice is the safest basis, on which any adminis- 
tration can place even its popularity. It is delightful to 
reflect, how, among a people enlightened and experienced 
upon political subjects, the strait and devoted line of duty 
becomes to the public functionary that of interest also. When 
I began, I intended to say nothing but in relation to some pri- 
vate business, but was insensibly drawn away to subjects which 
were calculated to excite much publick interest. 

I am necessitated to give you some trouble on my private 
account. During my late absence, one of my domesticks with-

out any just provocation left me; and as I have not been able 
to hear of him since, I am inclined to think, that under the 
seduction and aid of some free blacks near me, he has made 
for Philadelphia. I have been advised, that the best mode to 
obtain him is not to advertise, but to employ some active con- 
stable, or agent accustomed to that business. As I am unac- 
quainted with any suitable character, the object of this 
communication, is to ask your aid to obtain one to make an 
active and diligent search for him. I will make any compen- 
sation, which you may deem reasonable. My domestick's 
Name is Hector, but it is probable he will assume the name of 
Johnson by which he sometimes calls himself or some other 
name for concealment. (He left home on the 9 th July last). 
He is about 25 years of age, very black, under the middle size, 
compactly formed; he speaks slow with a feeble voice, and his 
upper eye lids hanging very much over his eyes give him a 
dull and sleepy appearance. Should he be discovered, I do 
not know the process by which I can secure him, and will 
expect your instruction in relation to it. 1 regret to give you 
this trouble. Accept the assurance of my esteem.

DEAR SIR, . . . Col Gibson the Commissary General has 
not }^et arrived; and as I cannot postpone any longer the pro 
posals for supplying the troops the next year, they will be 
issued immediately. The law authorizes you to make, if you 
should judge proper, changes in the rations; and I have ven- 
turd on the supposition of your approbation, to make some 
changes. So the South Bacon and killed [kiln] dried corn 
meal is substituted to a certain extent in the place of Pork and 
flour. Twice a week fresh meat, (Beef) and pease or beans, 
or rice is substituted in lieu of the regular ration. There will 
be in the whole a saving to the gov*, and an addition to the 
health and comfort of the Army.

Department of War, 22d Augt. 1818. 

SIR, From the frequent failure of packages to and from 
Fort Hawkins, the last winter and spring, it is possible that 
you may not have received a copy of the instruction to Genl. 
Smith, in relation to the contemplated post at the mouth of 
the Yellow stone river. 2 I now enclose a copy to you. From 
information since received, 1 am inclined to think the princi- 
pal post ought to be at the Mandane village. It is the point on 
the Missouri nearest to the British post on the Red river, and 
the best calculated to counteract their hostilities against us, 
or influence with the Indians. It appears to be very impor- 
tant, that a strong post should be taken atJthe mouth of the 
St. Peters 3 on the Mississippi. It is the great thoroughfare 
of the British trade with the Indians within our limits. That 
and Fort Armstrong are said to be the most commanding posts 
on the upper Mississippi. The Michigan territory has been 
extended to the Mississippi. The Northern Division has 
received a similar extension. In order to relieve the South- 
ern Division, which by the extension of the posts up the Mis- 
souri, has so long a line of the frontier to protect, I am inclined 
to think the Mississippi with its waters above the mouth of 
Rocky River ought to be annexed to the Northern Division. 
It would not even then have equal duties to perform with that 
of the South. Should no substantial objection occur to you, 
that arrangement of the divisions will be made. I am very 
desirous by taking strong and judicious posts to break the 
British controul over the Northern Indians; and, for this pur- 
pose it appears proper, that a much larger proportion of our 
military establishment should be posted on the Mississippi and 
its waters, which the arrangement proposed would admit of, 
without any derangement of your command.

War Dept 29 th August 1818 

DEAR SIR, M r . Adams left here yesterday; and requested 
me to open and read the dispatches from abroad; and to for- 
ward to you such as might have any interest. Yesterday's 
mail brought the enclosed from M r . Rush and M r . Irvin; 2 and 
they are forwarded agreeably to M r . Adam's request. 

Cap Gadsden 3 arrived yesterday and has brought the cop- 
ies of the dispatches from Gen 1 . Jackson, the original of which 
miscarried. He also brought letters from Gen 1 . Jackson, of 
which one is addressed to you and the other to the Depart- 
ment. I enclose both, with the request that the one to me 
may he returned after you have perused it, as I have not yet 
answered it. The copies of the proceedings of the court mar- 
tial in the case of Arbuthnot and Ambrester with the other 
dispatches, I will transmit to you as soon as I have perused 
them. Cap*. Gadsden is under the necessity of going on to 
New Haven; and cannot go on, at least till after his return, to 
Albermarle, as you wished when you left here. 

You will see by Gen 1 . Jackson's letter to me that Col Haynes 
is about to resign; and that he is anxious for Cap*. Gadsden 
to be appointed in his place. He is a valuable officer and 
I would be sorry to loose him from the Engineer Corps; but 
as it is his wish and as he no doubt would be well qualified 
for the place held by Col Haynes, I think it would be proper 
to confer the appointment when the vacancy occurs. 

P. S. The act relative to the flag (of the last Session) has 
not been acted on by the War and Navy Departments. 1 send 
for your selection two patterns. The only difference is in the 
distribution of the Stars. Those distributed in the form of 
a square is the most simple, but the other is more emblemat- 
ical of our Union. As it is necessary to act in relation to this 
subject soon, I will thank you for the determination as soon 
as it is made.

Department of War, 3d September, 1818. 
SIR, By direction of the President, I have sent a commis- 
sion to the Hon: Wilson Lumpkin, 2 to run, provisionally, the 
line between the U. States and Florida, from the Appalachi- 
cola to the head of the St. Marys. Genl. Gaines will be 
ordered, on the requisition of Mr. Lumpkin, to furnish a suf- 
ficient force to guard against an attack from the Indians; but 
it appears to me, as the Indian hostilities will probably cease 
in a short time, and as much expense would be avoided by 
dispensing with so large a guard as would now be necessary, 
that the running of this line ought to be postponed, unless 
the interest of your state should render it improper, 'till after 
those of the late cessions from the Creek nation be ascer- 
tained. Mr. Lumpkin will, accordingly, be instructed to 
ascertain those first, unless your Excellenc}^ should suggest 
the opposite course. He will be instructed to consult you in 
relation to it. As Mr. Lumpkin's post office is not known to

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 141 

To James Monroe. 1 

[Sept. 6, 1818.] 

I have received your letters of the 31 8t of August and 1 st 
of Sep*. 

Agreeably to your suggestion, I will direct the Commis- 
sioner appointed to run out the lines under the late treaty 
with the Creeks, (M r . Lumpkin) to run provisionally the 
line from the Appalachicola to the head of the S fc Marys. 
Would it not be proper for M r . Adams to inform the Spanish 
Minister of the object of the Government in running out of 
the line? I have directed M r . Baily of the State Department 
to furnish the widow of General Montgomery with a copy of 
the correspondence which she requested. 

Nicholas P. Trist 2 would have been appointed a Cadet as 
you requested but there is no vacancy at present. 

I called on M r . Wirt this morning after receiving your 
letter, and he expected to be able to report in two or three 
days in the case of Maj r . Hall. 

Letters of a late date have been received from M r Gallatin 
and Irvin, 3 which } T OU will find enclosed. They are more im- 
portant than those previously sent. I would not be surprised 
if Spain should agree to the proposals lately made to Don 
Onis. It is so obviously her interest; and the fear which 
France seems to have of the recognition of the Independence 
of the Spanish provinces, if our differences with Spain should 
remain unadjusted, will have I hope its weight. . . . 



To James Monroe.* 

War Dept 19 th Sep* 1818 

DEAR SIR, I enclose for your approval regulations for the 
Medical Department. They have been drawn up with care; 
and I believe are as good as can be devised for the commence- 
ment of the system. Time and experience may no doubt sug- 
gest important alterations. If they meet with your approba- 
tion, I will thank you to return them with your approval

endorsed on them, as soon as convenient, as it is desirable, 
that they should be issued to the medical officers at an early 
period. 

M r . Poinsett's letter and journal was lent to M r . Forsyth 
by M r . Adams; 1 and as M r . Forsyth is not in the city at 
present, it cannot be transmitted to M r . Poinsett until he 
returns; which it is understood will be in a few days. It will 
then be sent immediately. I have written to M r . Adams in 
relation to the subject, agreeably to your request. 

I read your letter of the 17 th Ins* this morning. 1 cannot 
doubt the power of employing Gen 1 . Scott in the manner 
which he proposes. The case of Cap* O Conner (as well as 
many others) is in point. But I agree with you that his com- 
pensation ought not to be in the shape of his brevat pay and 
emouluments, as it would probably give offence to Congress and 
the Army. It is usual, for Extra Service to be rewarded by 
extra compensation ; and in this case it may be specifically agreed 
on by the Dept and the Gen 1 . The better course it appears 
to me will be to order the Genl to this place in order to agree 
on the plan the compensation and whatever other particulars 
would be necessary. I will write to him and state, that after 
your return to the city an order will be given him to repair 
to this place, for the purpose which I have stated; and in the 
mean time, Gen 1 . Brown 2 can be informed, of the wishes and 
the object of the executive. Accept of the assurance of my 
sincere respect and esteem. 



To Edmund P. Gainex* 

Department of War, 23d September, 1818. 

SIR, Your two letters of the 8th instant, enclosing a copy of 
a letter from a Savannah correspondent, whose name } 7 ou have 
omitted, in relation to the strength and hostile feelings of the 
Seminoles, have been received. 

Caution is certainly necessary in all militarv affairs, and in 
this case; we ought to assume the number of hostile Indians 
and negroes at the highest reasonable estimation; but it ap- 
pears to me from reference to the countiy which they inhabit, 

1 For Joel R. Poinsett's travels see the Pennsylvania Magazine of History, XII, 129-164. 

2 Jacob Brown, major-general commanding the Division of the North. 

3 Gen. Gaines at this time commanded the southern department under Jackson. The 
letter is addressed to him at "Savannah or Ft. Hawkins." It is derived from Military 
Book No. 10 in the archives of the Department of War; text from an official copy. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 143 

from the statement of persons who have resided among them 
many years, and from Captain Young's report, that the entire 
force cannot, on the most liberal estimation, much exceed one 
thousand warriors. I do hope that the chastisement which 
they have received, will prevent a recurrence of hostilities, 
and unless you have information on which you can rely, that 
such are their intentions, you will not renew them on our part. 
If it should become necessary, hostilities ought not to com- 
mence until we are fully prepared to strike an effectual blow. 
To be prepared to act in case it should be necessary, you ought 
to concentrate your troops as much as possible at St. Marks, 
or if that should be occupied by a Spanish garrison under the 
instructions given to you, at Fort Gadsden, on that side of 
the Peninsula, and on this at Amelia Island or St. Mary's. 
The troops at Pensacola would be much more efficient at St. 
Marks, or fort Gadsden, than where they now are, or than 
they would be at Fort Crawford, or any other point to the 
West of the Appalachicola river. By being at the former 
places, they would be ready to strike a decisive blow at once, 
should it be necessary; but at the latter they would be of little 
efficiency. 

About 450 or 500 recruits have been ordered on from Bal- 
timore and Boston, to Mobile, which, added to the force at 
Pensacola, Fort Gadsden and St. Marks, would, if collected 
at either of the two last places, give you a respectable force 
to hold the Indians in check; or to chastise them, should they 
feel disposed to commence hostilities: And in order to increase 
your means in that quarter, it would be proper to notify Genl. 
Mclntosh (the Creek Chieftain) to hold a sufficient force in 
readiness, should it be necessary, either to cover the frontier 
or to act against the enemy. 

It is thus the expense and vexation attending militia requi- 
sitions, will be entirely avoided in that quarter. 

Should it be found necessary to order forces from the 
Northn. Division, they will be sent to Amelia Island, to oper- 
ate by the way of the St. John's river, which, if correctly 
laid down on our maps, presents great facilities, either to act 
against the Seminoles, or to cut off their intercourse with St. 
Augustine. Should it be necessary you will occupy some 
suitable post on that river. 

You will report to me immediately after receiving this letter, 



144 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

any additional facts, which may have come to your knowledge, 
as to the strength and intentions of the Seminoles, accompa- 
nied with your opinion whether another campaign will be 
necessary; .so that orders may issue, if necessary, to detach a 
suitable force from the Northern Division. 

If possible the militia must not be called out. Economy 
and the honor of the Army require that, in the farther prose- 
cution of the war, this should be avoided. Major Mason, of 
the Quarter master's department, is now here, and will be 
ordered to report himself to you before he repairs to Nash- 
ville. If hostilities should be probable, you will retain him 
to take charge of the Quarter master's department in your 
operations; but if not, you will order him to report to the 
Major Genl. 1 without delay. 

Genl. Ripley 2 is informed that, should it be necessary, you 
are authorized to give any orders the service may require, to 
Capt. Hunt, or any other officer of the Qr. Mrs. Department 
at New Orleans. You will consider this as your authority in 
that event. Should you be compelled to commence hostili- 
ties, your supplies must be drawn principally from New Or- 
leans and Savannah or Charleston. Ample notice ought to be 
given to the contractor, if supplies should be wanted. 

I transmit a duplicate of my order of the 1st September 
1818. 3 

In the event of hostilities, you will consider the order of 
the 16th Dec r 1817, 4 as still in force. 

You will not construe this letter, so as to affect niy order of 
the 14th of August, 5 so far as it regards the restoring of St. 
Marks and Pensacola to the Spanish authority. 



To Edmund P. Gaines* 

Department of War, 30th Septemr. 1818. 
SIR, I have reed, your letter of the 16th inst. and am happy 
to infer from its contents, that we will probably have not 
much trouble from the Seminole Indians for the present.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 145 

The arrangement contained in my letter to you of the 23d 
instant, had reference to a probable renewal of hostilities, and, 
as I am informed by a letter from Colo. Clinch this morning, 
that you had ordered the recruits under him at Norfolk, to be 
sent to Amelia Island, that part of the arrangement, which 
proposed to send them to Mobile, will not be carried into 
effect. They will proceed according to your orders. 

In relation to the negroes which have been surrendered, or 
which may hereafter be, and which belonged, 01 were in pos- 
session of the hostile Indians, you will order those belonging 
to persons resident in Florida, to be restored on satisfactory 
proof of property, the claimants paying to the officer in com- 
mand, a sum equal to the expense of maintaining the negroes, 
while in the possession of the United States, and the reward 
for bringing them in, and other expenses, should there be any 
other. 

The officer will report the negroes so restored, and to whom, 
with the sums paid on the restoration (for which he will be 
held responsible) to this Department. The negroes belonging 
to the Seminoles, you will order to be held for future orders. 
Those claimed by our own citizens, should there be any such, 
will be reported to this Department, accompanied with the 
proof of ownership, and such circumstances in relation to the 
claim, as may be in the knowledge of the officer, with his 
opinion on the case. This precaution is intended to prevent 
speculation and the introduction of negroes into the U. States 
contrary to the act of Congress. 

The officers in command will, from time to time, report the 
negroes who may be surrendered. 



To Edmund P. Gaines. l 

Department of War, 2d Oct., 1818. 

SIR: I have rec'd this day your two letters of the 8th ult., 
one of them containing a report of the strength of your com- 
mand, 

I enclose you an extract of my letter to Mr. Lumpkin, by 
which you will perceive that it was not expected that he would 
proceed to run the line between Florida and Georgia; and 



1 From the same source as the preceding. 
HIST 99 VOL II 10 



146 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

that the extent of his guard was to be fixed after consulting 
with you. 

I infer from your return, that you do not estimate the 4th 
Regiment under the command of Col. King. The last report 
at the office of the Adjt. and Inspr. Gen'l states it was 470 
strong, which adds considerably to the strength of your com- 
mand. Your force, including the 4th and the troops at Forts 
Gadsden, Scott, St. Marks, and the recruits which will prob- 
ably be added to them, will not fall much short of one thou- 
sand strong, on that side of the Peninsula. This force, 
strengthened by such friendly Indians as you may call to 
your assistance, will render you, I hope, sufficiently strong, 
should hostilities commence, on that side, without calling in 
the militia. 

The information, which you have communicated, appears 
too uncertain, to order, on the strength of it, a movement 
from the North. I wait to receive a report from you on your 
arrival at Savannah, where you will perceive by niy letters 
of the 23d and 30th of Septemr. the view which is taken of 
this subject. I am solicitous, if hostility is to be commenced, 
that it should begin on their part. The country and the world 
ought to be satisfied, that we are not actuated by motives of 
aggrandizement, in waging or carrying on this war. That 
our object is not Florida, but protection. 

I confess, 1 have great distrust as to the reports of the great 
force and universal determination to renew the war on the 
part of the Indians. There are many, and in some instances, 
I fear, disgraceful motives for these representations. I give 
you a statement of their force, according to Capt. Young's 
statement, which you will perceive amounted then but to 
{illegible} and which must, by surrender and other cause, be 
considerably reduced since. 

Should your report, however, render it probable that hostility 
will be renewed, a force, not short of 700 rank and file, will be 
immediately ordered from the Northern Division; and as they 
will be taken from along the coast, there will be but little delay 
in concentrating them at the point which you may designate. 
In the meantime, the post at Tradersville on the St. Mary's 
ought to be guarded with vigilance, in order to cover the 
frontier. A resort ought not to be made to the militia, but 
where it can not be avoided. By foresight and prudence, you 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 147 

will be able to prevent an accumulation of expense, should 
hostility be renewed, and, at the same time, effectually guard 
the lives of our citizens. 



To William A. TrimUe. 1 

WarDept, 16 Oct., 1818. 

SIR, I have laid your letter of the 17th of September offer- 
ing your service, to explore the country between the Sabine 
and Red river, on the East, and the Rio del Norte, on the West, 
before the President. He duly appreciates the spirit of enter- 
prise, and the laudable zeal, to enlarge our knowledge of a 
country so little known, and desires me to say to you, that if 
the state of our relations, at this time, would have justified it, 
it would have afforded him pleasure to confide so important 
an undertaking to one, on whose perseverance and capacity for 
sound observation, he reposes so much confidence. Although 
in the opinion of the President, it is not proper, at this time, 
to explore the country in question; yet it is very important 
that you permit no opportunity to escape you, to enlarge your 
knowledge of it. Should more accurate or fuller information 
be had of it, you will communicate the results to this Depart- 
ment. It is a matter of considerable importance to prevent the 
encroachment of our citizens on lands belonging to the Indians 
on our South Western Frontier; and to prevent our people 
from passing into the Buffalo Country, either for the destruc- 
tion of game or to traffick with the Indians without license. 
You will report your opinion on the best mode of arresting 
these evils which may ultimately lead to unpleasant conse- 
quences, and in the mean time you will to the utmost of your 
power, prevent its further growth.

dians, in that quarter, have rendered it necessary to take 
measures to advance our posts on the Mississippi and Missouri 
to points much more remote than what they now are. To 
effect this object, your Division, as you have already been 
informed by the Adjt. and Inspr. Gen'l, has been extended to 
the Mississippi above Fort Armstrong, inclusive. The two 
principal positions on the Mississippi will be at the junction 
of the St. Peters, and Fort Armstrong. The latter position 
is on an island in the river, and is said to be, by nature, very 
strong. 1 The former, from its remoteness from our settle- 
ments, its proximity to Lord Selkirk's establishment on Red 
river of Lake Winipeg, 2 and from its neighbourhood to the 
powerful nations of the Sioux, ought to be made very strong. 
The force sent in the first instance ought to be as imposing as 
it can be rendered. With this view, it is thought advisable 
to occupy the posts on the Mississippi, with an entire Regi- 
ment; the whole of which, with the exception of what will be 
necessary to garrison Fort Armstrong and Fort Crawford at 
Prairie du Chien, ought to be moved up to the St. Peters. 
The occupation of the last mentioned place will render Fort 
Crawford of minor importance. After -the post at St. Peters 
is fully established, it is in contemplation to establish a post 
at the head of navigation on that river, so as to form a com- 
munication over land, with the projected fort at the Mandan 
Village; and another at the head of navigation on the St. 
Croix, which empties into the Mississippi on the East Side, a 
little below the St. Peters. 

I transmit to you a sketch of the country according to the 
best information in the Department, by reference to which it 
will be seen, that the positions will completely command the 
country, and prevent the introduction of foreign traders. 
These positions, with those at Green Bay, Chicago and Saut 
of the St. Mary's, will render your command, in that quarter, 
imposing. 

It appears to me that you will be able to effect the occupa- 
tion of the posts on the Mississippi, with the greatest facilit} T 
and least expense, by marching the 3rd regiment across the 
Prairie du Chien, as soon as the season in the Spring will

LETTEES OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 149 

admit of it, with no other supplies than what will be necessary 
for them to reach that post; to which place the supplies in the 
Qr. Mr's, Ordnance, and Commissariat Departments, neces- 
sary for the establishment and maintenance of the posts, may 
be transported from St. Louis. . You will communicate to me 
youi ideas on this point, so that correspondent and early 
arrangements may be made, thro' the respective departments. 

It is contemplated that an Engineer and an Asst. Topo- 
graphical Engineer will accompany the regiment. 

No effort must be spared to conciliate the Indians, particu- 
larly the powerful bands of the Sioux; and to afford every 
extension- and protection to our trade with the Indians. The 
post at the St. Peters will be made the seat of an Indian 
Agency. 

I trust that your arrangements will be made to effect these 
important objects, as early next summer as may be practicable. 

By the direction of the President, I transmit a copy of the 
opinion of the Attorney General in the case of Major Hall. 



Dep'm't of War, November 24, 1818. 

SIR: Your letter of the 19th inst: offering to dispose of, on 
the part of the State of New York, the fortification owned by 
it in the harbour of New York, has been received. In con- 
versation on the same subject last winter I stated to you that 
the opinion of the Officers of the Corps of Engineers who were 
charged with the survey of the coast with a view to its effec- 
tual and permanent fortification would be taken in relation to 
the work in question and that until their opinion was known, 
a definitive answer could not be given. I enclose a copy of a 
report from General Bernard 2 and Col. McRee, 3 by which you 
will perceive that they will not be able to furnish the infor- 
mation required till the survey and plan for the defence of 
the city of New York are completed. In the meantime I can 
only repeat what has already been stated in conversation. It

is conceived that from sound policy and a just regard to the 
principles of the Constitution, the General Government ought 
to assume the burden of the general defence of the Country; 
and that in conformity with these views should the report of 
the Officers be favorable, the government ought to purchase 
the fortification at a fair price. This however cannot be 
effected by applying a part of the annual appropriation of 
$830,000 for fortifications, but an application to Congress for 
a specifick appropriation for the purpose would be necessary. 
Should the report be favorable the Dep'm't would unhesitat- 
ingly make the necessary recommendation to Congress for the 
appropriation. 



To Andrew Jackson,. l 

Department of War 28th Deer. 1818. 

SIR, I have received your letter of the 28th of November, 
with the enclosed papers. Experience has proved, that the 
opinion which you had formed of the movements of the Span- 
iards on our South western frontier, is correct. After break- 
ing up the French Settlement on the Trinity, it is stated, that 
they retired. In fact, a hostile movement, in that quarter, 
on the part of Spain, would at present, be absurd, and the 
apprehension which is said to have been produced appears 
quite unaccountable. Should farther Military operations, 
against the Indians and outlaws in Florida, become necessary, 
or should Congress authorize the occupation of the Country, 
the operations which you propose, would, certainly, be the 
most effectual and prompt mode of putting down all hostilities, 
and it could be effected with almost no additional expense. 

I concur with you in opinion that the situation of Florida, 
at this moment, is very peculiar, and that it requires the early 
attention of Government. Its acquisition, in a Commercial, 
Military, and Political point of view, would be of great im- 
portance to us. 

You, no doubt, are aware of the great importance I attach 
to the expedition to the mouth of the Yellow Stone, and as 
much of its Success will depend upon the Commander, I 

1 From the confidential letter-books of the Department of War; text from an official copy. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 151 

have to request that the ablest and most experienced officer 
of the rifle regiment, be selected for that Command. The 
remoteness of the position, surrounded by Indians, and in the 
neighbourhood of the British Fur Company, requires the 
greatest prudence, in the Commander to effect the objects of 
the expedition. Capt. Martin of that regiment is now in com- 
mand of the expedition. As 1 do not know his merits, I 
leave it with you to determine whether he combines the 
requisite qualities for such a command. 



To Andre* Jackson? 

Department of War, 5th Jany. 1819. 

SIR, I have received the letter of Colo. Chambers addressed 
to Colo. Butler which by your order has been transmitted to 
this department for instruction in relation to the subject to 
which it refers. 

By a letter of the 28th ult. from this Department you were 
apprised of the arrangements which had been formed through 
the Qr. Master to transport the detachment intended to 
occupy the Mississippi with its supplies by Steam Boat, and 
that the arrangements would be completed early in April. In 
order to meet Indian hostilities the boat will be prepared with 
strong bulwarks and will want a few light pieces on her deck. 
If the Mississippi will admit of such navigation, all resistance 
from the Indians, even if aided and instigated by British 
traders will be easily overcome. In the meantime it appears 
to me that it would be imprudent for the detachment at 
present to risk any thing. Its further advance at present if 
not alread}^ arrested by the ice, would be of no importance, 
as it would not in the least expedite the ultimate object of the 
expedition. 

I regret that the Indians have in this early stage of the 
movements evinced a hostile disposition, and trust that every 
degree of moderation and firmness will be exercised by Capt. 
Martin, to prevent the hostility from extending itself or be- 
coming settled. The command requires great prudence and 
skill. Jealousy on the part of the Indians ought to be 
expected and soothed; and the instigation of the British

152 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

traders from interest and enmity ought to be counteracted by 
seizing on every occasion to gain the confidence of the Indians, 
but as I have already in my letter of the 28th expressed my 
opinion on these facts, I will not extend these observations. 
Every thing will depend on the character of the 'commander 
of the expedition 



To Winfield Scott. 1 

War Department 5th March 1819. 

SIR, The very great pressure of business, to which the 
Department is subject towards the termination of a session of 
Congress has delayed my answer to your letter of the 22nd 
February till this time. 

I have laid your statement before the President in order to 
take his direction in relation to it; and it is his opinion that 
any relaxation in the order of the 21st February 1818 2 would 
in this case be improper. Publications of the kind prohibited 
are always injurious to the reputation and interest of the 
army and Country; and when they come from officers of the 
standing and reputation of yourself or Gen. Jackson the} 7 
cannot but have the most injurious effects. In this case 1 
cannot but think, that those who are opposed to the army 
would seize on the publication and wield it with effect against 
our military establishment. Whether Genl. Jackson has 
done any act in violation of the order in this case I am not 
apprized but admitting he has "the Department would find in 
such violation a reason for enforcing and not for rescinding 
or relaxing the order.

Department of War, 6th March 1819.

dent and of the arrangements which have been made to occupy 

1 Brigadier-general, U. S. A., commanding the first and third departments under Major- 
General Brown. From the confidential letter books of the Department of War; text from

Jackson, II, 371-382, and which Jackson had allowed to appear in the newspapers.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 153 

in force the contemplated posts on the Missouri. It is 
believed that our principal post ought to be at the Mandane 
Village or in its neighborhood; and for the present, no 
attempt ought to be made till it is strongly occupied, to 
ascend the river to a more remote point. The Missouri there 
approaches nearest to the establishment of the Hudson bay 
company on Red river, and holds in its descent to the Missis- 
sippi from that point a more Southerly direction, both of 
which will render the position permanently important. You 
will accordingly give orders to render it with the means which 
may be in possession of the detachment, as strong as prac- 
ticable. Whether an attempt ought to be made to push our 
troops during the next summer to this remote position will 
depend on circumstances to be judged of by the officer charged 
with the command of the Department. Should it be deemed 
practicable, without exciting Indian hostilities, to occupy the 
position so as to afford time to render it sufficiently strong and 
to construct the necessary buildings to protect the troops 
against the inclemency of the winter in that high latitude, it 
ought to be attempted; but should a contrary impression 
exist some strong position less remote ought to be occupied. 
The Council Bluff or the Great Bend will probably afford such 
positions, and as one or both of these will probably have to 
be permanently occupied in considerable force, the labour 
which may be bestowed to render the troops secure will not 
be lost. It is hoped and believed that with proper caution 
the contemplated movements may be made without exciting 
Indian hostilities; yet it will be necessary to be so prepared at 
all times should they be excited as to experience no disaster. 
To effect these important objects much will doubtless depend 
on the character of the officer charged with their execution. 
The selection of Col. Atkinson has been made with much 
reflection. It is believed that he possesses all the requisite 
qualities. You will however inculcate on him the necessity 
of the greatest caution and vigilence. No pains ought to be

cede the expedition. He is represented as eminently quali- 
fied for his office. 

Maj. Long with his command accompanied by several 
citizens eminent for scientifick acquirements will ascend the 
river about the same time in a steam boat of light draught, 
in order to acquire a more enlarged and accurate knowledge 
of the country between the Rocky Mountain and the Mis- 
sissippi. 1 You will give orders to afford to the expedition 
under him every aid and protection, which may be practica- 
ble. Strict orders will also be given to treat with kindness and 
justice such citizens as [may] be permitted by the government 
to carry on trade among the Indians. Should the necessary 
protection be afforded to our traders, it will in addition to 
the profits of the fur trade, afford the means of greatly 
extending our influence over the various tribes within our 
limits. 



To Winfield Scott* 

Department of War, 11 March 1819. 

SIR, I yesterday received your letter of the 8th inst. , and 
have stated its contents to the President. 

The President concurs with me in opinion that any relaxa- 
tion of the order of the 21st February 1818, as it relates to the 
correspondence between yourself and Genl. Jackson, would be 
improper. The reason of the order applies with particular 
force at this time to the correspondence referred to; and its 
publication could not fail, as 1 have already stated to you, to 
produce most unhappy effects. No one can regret more sin- 
cerely than I do the unfortunate misunderstanding between 
you and the General. It is to the President also a source of 
much regret; and he felt very solicitous if any opportunity 
had presented itself, to have healed the difference between you. 
In refusing to yield to your solicitation on a subject in which 
you take so much interest, I am satisfied your candour will see 
in it, no other motive, but a sincere desire to promote the 

!Maj. Stephen H. Long, of the topographical engineers. See James's Account of an 
Expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains, Philadelphia, 1823. Secretary 
Calhoun's instructions to Long are printed almost entire on pp. 3, 4 of Vol. I.

both letters, at Richmond.

interest of the Country and the Army. How far General 
Jackson may have transcended the letter or the spirit of the 
order of the 21st February would be premature in me to decide 
at this time, but I cannot but remark that there is a wide dif- 
ference in effect in reading the correspondence, or even fur- 
nishing copies of it to individuals, and going before the public 
through the public prints. Whether such qualified publica- 
tion, if such it may be called, is a breach of the order or not, 
I do not think any argument in either view can be drawn from 
it to justify a relaxation. The breach of an order is a good 
reason to enforce it, but is very far from being a sound reason 
for suspending it. On the contrary supposition, that such 
publication is consistent with the order, the means of vindi- 
cating your character would be equally open to yourself and 
General Jackson. As to the insinuations of the newspapers 
they have but little effect with the community, and are of such 
a nature that it is difficult to render the authors amenable to 
any tribunal civil or military. - 



To Jacob Brown. 1 

Department of War, 11" March, 1819. 
SIR: I enclose a copy of the order to Maj. Gen. Jackson in 
relation to the expedition on the Missouri, which were drawn 
up in conformity to the direction of the President after the 
deliberation with yourself and the General in relation to it 
and the expedition on the Mississippi. The same principle 
will govern both of the expeditions which have the same 
objects, the complete security of our frontier and the exten- 
sion of our trade with the Indians. If the expeditions are 
conducted with prudence it is believed that there will be no 
hazard of Indian hostilities. Suitable presents will be sent 
up the Missouri in the steam boat and one of the Agents, 
probably Mr. Forsyth at Fort Armstrong, will be directed to 
accompany the expedition for the purpose of distributing 
presents and preparing the Indians for the establishment of 
our post at the mouth of the St. Peters. 2 Whether that posi- 
tion can be safely occupied the next summer will depend on

circumstances to be judged of by the officer charged with its 
establishment. It is conceived to be the most commanding 
position on the Upper Mississippi and ought to be rendered 
proportionally strong. It was intended to order an Engineer 
to accompany the expedition but the engagements of that 
corps is so extensive at present that no officer of that corps 
can be spared from other duties. 

Should an Indian war take place the Regiments on the Mis- 
souri and the Mississippi ought to cooperate; and to produce 
the effect you will in that event order the commandent of the 
5th Regiment to report to and receive orders from the officer 
in command of the 9th Military Department. 



To Morri* 8. Miller. 1 

Department of War, 27" March, 1819. 
DEAR SIR: I enclose you a commission from the President 
of the United States to act as agent of the Government in a 
treaty which the proprietors of the Seneca reservations in the 
State of New York propose to hold with that nation. I also 
enclose a copy of a letter from the Hon. David Ogden, one of 
the proprietors, which communicates their wish to hold a 
treaty this summer with the Senecas and appointment of 
Commissioners on the part of the State of Massachusetts. It 
is thought, that the United States as the general protector of 
the Indian tribes, ought to be present at the treaty, to repre- 
sent to them the views of the government, and to see that the 
proceedings are just and fair. You have been selected by the 
President for this purpose. It is understood to be the wish 
of the proprietors to concentrate the Senecas on the Allegany 
reservation and to convey it to the President of the United 
States for the time being, in trust, for the Seneca Nation. 
The reservation is said to contain upward of 30,000 acres, 
that the soil is almost without exception remarkabty good, and 
that it is so surrounded by mountains as in a considerable de- 
gree to prevent the intrusion of the white people. You will 
enquire into the truth of these statements and if you are satis- 
fied of their correctness you will give a decided support to the 
proposition to concentrate them on the Allegany reservation 

1 Of Utica, N. Y. From the same source as the preceding. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 157 

on such terms and conditions as you may deem just and fair. 
Their present scattered condition is equally unfriendly to their 
and our own interest. It renders them more exposed to the 
effects of violence and injustice; and renders all efforts to better 
their condition more difficult and expensive. 

It is represented that it may be the desire of a part of the 
Senocas to join that portion of their nation who reside at lower 
Sandusky. Gov. Cass is of the opinion that it would not be 
objected to by the neighboring white population, and that the 
reservation at Sandusky is sufficiently large for a considerable 
addition of their number. With these facts, you may repre- 
sent to them that all who may choose to emigrate to Sandusky, 
and who can obtain the assent of their brethren, they will be 
permitted to do so. 

You are also authorized to state that if the Seneca nation or 
any portion of them should choose to form new settlements, 
and can obtain the consent of any of the Indian tribes residing 
on the territories of the United States to form such settle- 
ments on lands belonging to such tribes, Government will 
readily give its assent to their removal there. 

Whatever measure may be adopted must be with their free 
assent, and you will make such representation to them of the 
propositions which may be presented by the proprietors or 
their agents as that they may fully comprehend their meaning. 

The treaty, except your pay as commissioner, will be held 
at the expense of the proprietors. Your compensation will 
be $8 per day for the time actually engaged, which will be 
ascertained and paid on your certificate. 



To Lewis Cass. 1 

Department of War, 27 March, 1819. 

SIR: I enclose you a commission from the President of the 
United States to treat with the Chippeways for the country 
upon the Saginaw bay. 2 It is understood by representation 
from yourself and others that a treaty for the cession of the 
land referred to could probably be formed at no great expense 
and on reasonable terms. Before however, you open the 
negociation and incur the expense incidental to an Indian treaty

you will ascertain the probable success from such information 
as you can rely on. 

The state of the Indian fund renders it necessary that the 
expense should, if possible, be defrayed out of that portion 
which has been assigned to your superintendancy; and every 
confidence is reposed in your judgment and discretion, not 
only to obtain the lands on the most favorable terms, but that 
you will incur no expense that will not be necessary to the 
success of the negociation. 

The Government would prefer an exchange of territory to 
a purchase and would give in exchange lands to the West of 
Michigan, or West of the Mississippi if an exchange can be 
made on reasonable terms; but you will under all circum- 
stances exercise a sound discretion. The rapid and dense set- 
tlement of the Peninsular of Michigan is considered important 
in a material point of view, and this can best be effected by 
an entire extinguishment of the Indian title if it can be effected 
on fair terms; but if it can not it will only remain to concen- 
trate their population on reservations of reasonable extent. 

It is believed that the annuities paid by the Government to 
the Indians have rather a pernicious effect on them as they 
encourage idleness and dissipation; and that it would be a 
very great improvement to stipulate that they should be 
applied under the direction of the President to the support of 
schools or some other purpose useful to the nation. Should 
you stipulate for the payment of an annuity I would suggest 
the propriety of inducing the Chippeways, if practicable, to 
such a disposition of their annuity. 1 In the last treaty with 
the Cherokees they set apart 12 miles square to be sold, and 
the proceeds to constitute a school fund. 

Your compensation will be $8 per day, while actually 
engaged, which will be ascertained and paid on your certifi- 
cate on honor, and you are authorized to employ a Secretary 
whose compensation not to exceed $5 per day for the time ac- 
tually employed to be ascertained and paid on your certificate. 

If an issue of provision should be necessary during the 
negociation you will make requisition on Mr. Lacock Store- 
keeper at Detroit for the amount that may be required which 
you will cause to be issued in conformity to the regulations of 
the 11" September 1818. 



i The treaty does not contain such a stipulation. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 159 

To Henry Atkinson.^ 

Department of War, 27 March 1819. 

SIB: It is a .subject of much regret that my departure from 
Washington will take place before your passage through it to 
take command of the 9th Military Department. Your com- 
mand is considered of the first importance and responsibility. 
The establishment of the contemplated posts on the Missouri 
have two great objects in view, the enlargement and protec- 
tion of our fur trade, and the permanent peace of our North 
Western frontier by the establishment of a decided controul 
over the various tribes of Indians in that quarter. These 
objects will indicate the policy which ought to be pursued. 
To such of our citizens who may conform to the laws and 
regulations in relation to Indian trade and intercourse, you 
will extend kindness and protection. In relation to foreign 
traders who by the Act of Congress are entirely excluded, 
your conduct in the first instance must be governed by a 
sound discretion to be exercised in each case. No decisive 
step ought, perhaps, to be taken till your posts are fully 
established; and till you feel yourself secure against the 
effects of hostilities; at which time notice ought to be given 
that after a fixed period, you will rigidly exclude all trade by 
foreigners and such as are not authorized by law. 

Of the two objects in view, the permanent security of our 
frontier is considered by far of the greatest importance, and 
will especially claim your attention. If practicable you will 
gain the confidence and friendship of all the Indian tribes with 
whom you may have any intercourse. The Agent for the Mis- 
souri has had special instructions in relation to his duties, of 
which I enclose you a copy. 

It will be a great point gained, if the posts can be estab- 
lished without Indian hostilities, and such I confidently believe 
may be the case with discretion. Undoubtedly the Indians 
ought to be fully impressed with our capacity to avenge any 
injury which they may offer us; but it is no less important 
that they should be equally impressed with our justice and 
humanity. Should you succeed in convincing them of both, 
all difficulties will be removed. In the event of hostilities the 
Commandant of the 5th Regiment on the Upper Mississippi

is ordered to receive your orders. The distance between the 
Mississippi and Missouri is not too great for cooperation and 
the country is said to be very open and may easily be past over. 

I enclose the copies of the orders to Generals Brown and 
Jackson, as connected with your command, which will more 
fully apprize you of the views of the Department, and also a 
copy of the order of 10 May 1816 and 11 September 1818 1 in 
relation to Indian Trade and the issue of rations to the 
Indians. The Quartermaster General has been instructed to 
purchase a set of the acts of Congress for your use. 

You will keep an exact journal of all of your proceedings 
and report to this Department at short intervals the progress 
of your movements and such events as may be of importance 
to be known. 



To Andrew Jackson* 

War Depmt. 10 August 1819. 

DEAR SIR, I send you the last report of the Surgeon Gen- 
eral to this department. It is not my intention to make this 
an official communication, but merely to call your attention 
to the state of the Medical Department in your Division. 
You will perceive on reading the report, that in many partic- 
ulars the orders and regulations of the Department have not 
been complied with. No report has yet been received in con- 
formit} 7 with the Department order of the 21st April 1818 and 
the orders of the Surgeon General of the 2ttth of the same 
month and the 4th of September ensuing, from the Assistant 
Surgeon General; and Surgeons Harvey, Ball, Randall, Law- 
son, Merrill, Gale, Marshall, Maupin, Mercer, Russell, Lea, 
Davidson, Heustis and Walmsey have not made their quar- 
terly reports even for the quarter day ending 31st March last. 

It would seem from the letter of Doctr Gale to the Surgeon 
General that the cause of this delay has been, at least in part, 
a Division order by which such reports are ordered to pass 
through the Assistant Surgeon General. 

By adverting to the regulations (which have been sanctioned 
by the President) you will see, that the reports referred to, 
are ordered to be made directly to the Office of the Surgeon

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 161 

General. In my letter to you of 22 December last in relation 
to the case of the arrest of Col. Clemson, I stated very fully 
my view in relation to the character and the nature of the 
permanent regulations of the Department, and I have seen no 
reason since to change the opinion then formed. It certainly 
would be perfectly agreeable to me to order all reports to pass 
through the Headquarters of the Divisions, were it not for the 
delay which would in many instances result; and, which as 
experience proves in this case is inconsistant with the proper 
management of the department. It is certainly important 
that the Commanding General as well as the Government 
should be kept promptly informed of whatever effects his 
command; but this can be effected consistently with the cor- 
rectest principles, by ordering a duplicate of such reports as 
may be thought adviseable by the Commanding General to be 
made to his headquarters. 

It is thus that delay would be avoided and the Government 
and the General kept promptly informed. 

I hope you will acquiesce in this view and modify your 
Division Order referred to (if indeed such a one exists) accord 
ingly. In fact were it not that Doctr Gates states the exist- 
ence of such an order positively, I would suppose there was 
some mistake, as the General Order of the Department of the 
10th of September last directs all Division orders of a general 
nature to be reported to the office of the Adjt. and Inspector 
General and none of the discription referred to has as yet 
been received. In the report to the office of the Adjt. and 
Insp: General Doctr Bell's absence is accounted for by orders 
from the Asst. Surgeon General for a specifick duty. Really 
I am at a loss to know the meaning of such vague reports, or 
to conceive to what the specifick duty can refer. 

I would call your attention to the orders of Genl. Ripley 
detailing two Surgeons for the Bay of St. Louis, the necessity 
of which I cannot conjecture; and, also the case of Surgeon 
Lawson. You will perceive that he has been frequently 
detailed to perform the duties of a Judge Advocate. Such 
details when inconsistent with staff duties ought not to be 
made except in cases of necessity. The conduct of Doctr. 
Carter will also claim your attention. His neglect of duty has 
been long continued for which no reason has been rendered.

Both the publick interest and humanity towards the Army 
require an efficient medical staff, but it is not possible to ren- 
der it efficient, unless by a rigid adherence to the laws and 
regulations. 

I am persuaded that no one is more deeply convinced of the 
truth of this proposition than yourself, and that it is only 
necessary to call your attention to the irregularities which I 
have stated to relieve me from the necessit}^ of determining 
whether I shall permit the orders of the Government to be 
habitually neglected, or resort to the proper means of enforc- 
ing them. Should the alternative be presented I will not hesi- 
tate to do my duty. 

You will see in the form which I have given this communi- 
cation my conviction that to call your attention to the subjects 
referred to, is to have them corrected; satisfied as I am that 
we have but a common object to discharge our duty with 
fidelity to the publick and preserve the reputation of the army 
unsulied. 

You will as early as practicable apprise me of any measure 
which you may take in relation to the subjects to which I have 
called your attention. 



To Jacob 13rown. 1 

Department of War, 5 Sep., 1819. 

SIR, The views which you express in relation to the inter- 
course between the Indians residing within our limits and the 
British Posts in Upper Canada concur entirely with my own. 
It ought and must be stopped. We owe it to policy, humanity, 
and our dignity, not to permit it; and the President has 
already directed Mr. Adams to bring it before the British 
Government through our Minister at London. It can hardly 
be doubted that orders will be given on their part to suspend 
the intercourse and distribution of presents. It is better it 
should be stopped on their part, than ours, but, should the 
British Government not act, there appears to me no room to 
doubt but that we ought to avail ourselves of the advantage 
of our position, and suspend by force, if necessary, all inter-

course. In this view, the occupation of the strait of St. Marys 
would be important. 

You. will furnish to this Department, as far as your infor- 
mation extends, before the meeting of Congress, the number 
and distribution of the British troops in Canada and the adja- 
cent provinces; and the position and extent of the fortifica- 
tions which the Government is now erecting in those prov- 
inces. 

Since my circular the Quarter Master's disbursements have 
evidently diminished, and, I hope, with the zealous coopera- 
tion of the officers of the Army, to get through without much 
embarrassment. The economy and despatch with which the 
5th regt. moved over to Prarie du chien meets with my entire 
approbation. The contrast is great between this movement 
and that of the rifle regiment in 1816. 



To James Monroe.* 

War Dept 14 th Sept 1819 

DEAR SIR, I, this day, received your letter of the 13 th Inst, 
with the accompanying papers. 

It was impossible to make a station for the collectorship at 
Charleston, which would not have given ofl'ence to the rival 
candidates and their friends. There can be no doubt of M r . 
Pringle's sound political principles; and tho, M r . Hunt has 
some warm and active friends, I cannot doubt, but that his 
appoint[ment] would have given great ofl'ence to the solid and 
reflecting part of the community. His connections are tories, 
and his father is a judge in the Bahama Islands. The selec- 
tion for the vacancy in Alexandria is accompanied with con- 
siderable embarrassment. It seems to me, however, it will 
be difficult to avoid the selection of Gen 1 Mason. 2 The uni- 
form political principles of himself and his family, their 
great weight in society, with his acknowledged competency 
for the office offer strong claims. It is certainly painful to 
do an act, which may leave the family of the late Collector in 
want, yet the tendency to the hereditary principle from this 
very cause in the inferior offices of our country merits great

consideration. What is humanity now, may in the course of 
one or two generations ripen into a claim on the government. 

I have some papers to lay before you, but, as I hope, that 
you may be in Washington, before my departure for the 
South, I will not transmit them for the present. 

I have sent your letter to M r Andre: and will request M r 
Meigs to transmit the patents for your signature. 

I am happy to hear that M rs Monroe's health is better, and 
hope it will continue to improve. 



To John Qidncy 

Depmt. of War 22 Decemr. 1819. 

SIR, In reply to your note requesting any information in 
this Department relative to the enquiries contained in a copy 
of a letter of the 10th inst. from the Chairman of the Com- 
mittee of the House of Representatives which accompanied 
your note I have the honour to make the following statement. 

This Department has no certain information in relation to 
the number of Spanish Troops in Florida; but it is believed 
that it does not exceed 800. On the inoccupation of Pensa- 
cola and St. Marks in February last the number of troops 
which accompanied the governor was about 500 which were 
distributed between those posts. The Department has [no] 
information of the arrival of any reinforcement since, and it 
is probable that the number now at those posts is rather less. 
The information as to the strength of garrison of St. Augus- 
tine is less certain but from the last information it is thought 
that the number does not exceed 300. To these may be added 
the Seminole Indians; who since the non-ratification of the 
Treaty by Spain have evinced some hostile feelings and may 
probably be excited to open hostilities, but the number does 
not at present probably exceed 500 warriors. 

The number of troops in the Island of Cuba is not known 
with any certainty. It is believed that a considerable number 
probably not much less than 3000 arrived there some time last 

1 Addressed "The Hon. the Secretary of State." From the confidential letter books of 
the Department of War; text from an official copy. Spain having delayed the ratifica- 
tion of the Florida treaty of February 22, 1819, President Monroe, in his annual message 
of December 7, had suggested an act of Congress permitting the Executive to carry out

present letter, see Memoirs of John Quincy Adams, IV, 480.

Summer; but they are said to suffer so much from the diseases 
incidental to the climate that they are reduced one half since 
there arrival. 

The fortification of St. Augustine is the only considerable 
one in either of the Floridas. It is very strong both from the 
position and art and although not in a complete state it may 
in a short time be put in a good condition. Those of Pensa- 
cola and St. Marks are slight works. Some efforts are making 
both at Pensacola and St. Augustine to improve the condition 
of the fortifications and to augment the supply of provission. 

If a law were passed for the purpose, it is believed that a 
sufficient regular force could be ready to enter Florida in the 
latter part of February or certainly in March next, and that 
with the aid of a sufficient naval force, would complete, with 
the exception of St. Augustine, the military occupation of the 
country in a few weeks after it was entered. 

It is difficult to form an estimate of the time it would take 
to reduce St. Augustine. If well defended with a sufficient 
garrison it could only be carried by a regular seige. 

The most suitable season of the year to occupy the Floridas 
would be from November to May. After the latter period 
our troops would be particularly those from the North much 
exposed to the diseases of the climate. 



To Andrew) Jackson. 1 

War Depmt 24 deer 1819 

SIR, Before my return to the City the President had directed 
preparatory arrangements for the military occupation of the 
Floridas if such should be the pleasure of Congress, which 
were communicated to you on the 22nd ulto. by the Chief 
Clerk of this Department. 

As it is probable Congress will direct such occupation during 
the present Session, I have farther to require your early re- 
port of the number and distribution of the troops of your 
division, which may be promptly carried into such a cam- 
paign ; as those together with the light artillery and 2nd In- 
fantry of the North Division, it is believed will furnish a

competent force to accomplish such object, and the President 
is not disposed to employ militia if it can be avoided. 

You will furnish a plan of the campaign, designating the 
point of Rendervous for the troops of the north division (an 
efficient force of more than one thousand men with [ ] 

must be transported by Water) as well as the points of concen- 
trating those of the Tth and 8th Departments, if it is deemed 
proper to occupy more than one station. All your views and 
estimates are necessary and it is desirable to have them as 
much in detail as convenient, that the subsistence, ordnance 
and quarter masters department, may be directed to hold all 
supplies in readiness for the most prompt and efficient coopera- 
tion, under the further orders of this Department. 

You will see the necessity of your early report, as we shall 
here be apprized of the measures of Congress two or three 
weeks before orders can reach you, and that time will be im- 
proved by the subordinate departments, in placing the sup- 
plies at the points that may be designated. 



To Henry Leavenworth. 1 

Department of War, December 29, 1819. 

SIR: On my return to the Department your letters of the 
10 September and 24 October last, were laid before me. The 
delay in answering them has arisen from my confinement by 
severe illness from which I have not yet wholly recovered. 

I am much gratified to find that your movement has been 
made without opposition or hostility on the part of the Indians, 
and the promptness and judgment with which it has been exe- 
cuted, is highly satisfactory to the Department. 

I now proceed to give, agreeably to your request, such instruc- 
tions as appear to me to be necessary for your government, 
observing however that much must be left to your prudence 
and discretion, in which great confidence is placed. . . . 2 

The Indian agent at St. Peters, Lt. Lawrence Taliaferro, 
has had special instructions in relation to his duties, of which 
I enclose you a copy. He will leave this tomorrow to take

charge of his agency. Until his arrival you are requested to 
attend to the duties, from which you will then be relieved by 
him. 

To prevent hostility on the part of the Indians, they ought 
to be fully impressed with our capacity to avenge any injury 
which they may offer us; and it is no less important that they 
should be equally impressed with our justice and humanity. 
These points gained, your course will be plain and without 
difficulty. By direction of the President Lt. Taliaferro has 
been instructed to consult with you, on subjects connected 
with his duties as Indian Agent, and inform you of all his 
proceedings. I have no doubt, you will find him an able 
assistant in all your operations. 

The President also directs that you will, whenever you 
think the public interest may be promoted by it, hold treaties 
of friendship with the tribes within our limits, in which 
treaties you will establish such general rules for the inter- 
course between them and those under your command and such 
of our traders or citizens, who may visit them, as you may 
judge expedient. It would be a proper mark of respect for 
the Indian Agent, and would probably be attended with good 
effects, if you were to associate him with you in the negotia- 
tions whenever it can conveniently be done. 

For such funds as you may require for your command, you 
will draw upon the Cashier of the Bank of Missouri, at St. 
Louis, until the Quartermaster's and Subsistence Department 
shall be regularly supplied with funds by their chiefs. 

As it is desirable to impress the Chiefs of remote tribes 
with our power and resources, you will permit such as express 
any desire to visit the President to do so, assuring them that 
their expenses will be paid by the U. States and will furnish 
them with a guide and interpreter. 

P. S. A copy of the laws of the U. States will be furnished 
by the Q. Mr. Gen'l. for the use of the Post at St. Peters.

ordinate offices of this Department will be made in time, and 
ample funds will be transmitted to the officers of the staff for 
field operations. 

Whether the Lt. Artillery and 2nd Regiment of Infantry 
will be adequate to reduction of St. Augustine will depend 
upon the force of its garrison and the condition of its fortress. 
The present force of the garrison is estimated to be about 300. 
If that estimate be correct and a reinforcement be not made 
to it, the two regiments above named will be adequate to its 
reduction. But on this point I shall be better prepared to 
decide after I receive your plan of the campaign. 

In this anticipated campaign, I feel a strong desire to avoid 
the employing of militia of any kind if practicable; and will 
therefore, add more troops to the light artillery and second 
infantry from the north, if it should finally be thought 
necessary. 

In the present state of this business nothing more can be 
done than to effect a concentration of your forces at such 
points as in your plan of operations you may deem prudent. 
These movements and preparations ought not under the con- 
tingent upon which they are made, to involve any considera- 
ble expence. Whenever the troops act the Navy will 
cooperate. 



To Henry Atkinson? 

Depmt. of War, 7 February 1820. 

SIR, Your letters from the 14th of August last to the 2nd 
of January the date of your last have, from my absence from 
the Seat of Government, the low state of my health after my 
return and the continued pressure of public business since its 
restoration, remained unacknowledged. 

The movement of the important expedition under your 
command has thus far been entirely satisfactory; and I have 
every reason to hope that the same caution, prudence and 
industry which you have evinced will continue to characterize 
your conduct in the part of the expedition which remains to 
be performed. I felt no solicitude that you should proceed

farther than Council Bluff the last season, even had it been in 
your power. So large a force stationed there during this 
winter cannot fail to make a favourable impression on the 
various Indian tribes in that neighbourhood which heretofore 
have known nothing of us but through the unfavourable 
medium of Indian traders. 

Your progress the next Summer will be governed entirely 
bv your judgment. It is not intended to extend the expedi- 
tion, at least 'till we are fully established there, beyond the 
Mandane Villages, but whether it will be proper to advance 
so far as that point the next season you must judge under all 
of the circumstances of the case. It is more important that 
the post at the Mandane Villages should ultimately be peace- 
ably and firmly established should it take another year than 
to encounter any considerable additional hazard by too rapid 
a movement this year. An intermediate post about the great 
bend will probably be necessary. Of this, however, you will 
exercise your judgment. Your posts ought to be rendered 
as secure as possible so as to present from hostility no hope 
to the savages. 

The Quarter Master General will apprize you of the ar- 
rangement for the transportation this year. The provisions 
are by contract to be delivered at St. Louis by the middle of 
April, of which, one half of the supply is to be furnished by 
Govr. Worthington and the other by Col. Johnson. 1 The lat- 
ter gives every assurance which I hope facts will hereafter jus- 
tify, that his delivery will be made at, or previous to the time 
stipulated. In fact he expresses great anxiety to make his 
delivery of provisions at a much earlier period and to be per- 
mitted to proceed up the Missouri so soon as the ice shall 
leave the river. Should he be prepared before the whole of 
the provisions are delivered, it perhaps would be the best 
arrangement to permit him to proceed with his portion of 
the provisions-, so that the expedition might move from the 
Council Bluff for its destination on his arrival there without 
waiting for the residue of the supply. 

Of this, however, you will exercise your discretion.

By the arrangements which have been made, the means of 
transportation will be subject to your inspection and approval 
both as to the kind and quality. Whether Steam Boats ought 
to constitute any portion of that means, your knowledge of 
the navigation of the Missouri will enable you to form a cor- 
rect opinion. The emplo}^ment of one or two steam boats if 
there is a reasonable prospect of their success would be advis- 
able as it would give much more interest and eclat to the 
expedition and would probably impress the Indians and Brit- 
ish with our means of supporting and holding intercourse 
with the remote posts on the Missouri. The expedition how- 
ever ought not to be jeopardized and the expence greatly 
increased by their employment if after your experience you 
should be decidedly opposed to the use of them in your 
transportation. 

The survey of the route from Council Bluff to Chariton 
which accompanied your last letter is very interesting and has 
added considerably to our knowledge of the geography of the 
country. 

I much approve of the plan of opening the projected road 
between those posts as well as those which you have projected 
from the Arkansaw to the Missouri and from Council Bluff to 
the post at the mouth of the St. Peters. The troops cannot 
be more usefully employed than in such works. 

Col. Gibson has been ordered to furnish the stock of which 
you gave a list in your last. With a litfle care and industry 
the meat and bread part of the ration will in a short time be 
furnished at the respective posts, which will add greatly to 
the certainty of the supply while it will diminish the expense. 

To give an interest to the officers the order to raise pro- 
visions has been so modified as to allow 15 per cent, on the 
provision furnished at the respective posts to the Company 
officers. 

On the subject of the Indian trade your view appears to me 
well founded. Carried on as it is, it, at the same time, en- 
dangers our peace and debases the Indians. The remedy is 
in the hand of Congress; and I hope they will apply an ade- 
quate one. I reported on this subject at the last session of 
Congress l but the report was not acted on; and it is now pre-

ferred to vest the power of granting licenses wholly in the 
President. If no more can be done this will give to the gov- 
ernment much more effectual power over the Indian trade 
than what it now possesses and with prudent management, 
will go far to cure the evil of the present system. 



To Andrew 

Depmt. of War, 15th March 1820. 

SIR, I enclose the report of the committee of Foreign rela- 
tions of the House'of Representatives to whom was referred 
that portion of the Presidents message which related to our 
Spanish affairs. 2 

You will perceive on its perusal that it takes strong grounds; 
which, I hope will be supported by Congress. I would have 
transmitted it to you immediately, but was desirous to learn 
what would be its probable fate. The general impression 
is, that it will not be adopted, and that nothing will be 
done by Congress in relation to it this session; and I am 
myself inclined to think it is very doubtful as to what will 
be done. 3 In this state of uncertainty the President is 
of the opinion, that it would be improper to take any 
military measure now, in contemplation of the passage of 
the bill reported by the committee, which would involve 
any considerable expence; and he is more confirmed in this 
opinion from the belief that the season will be too far 
advanced to operate in Florida 'till the fall, even should the 
bill be taken up and passed without delay, which will not be 
the fact. There is an additional reason for not incurring 
farther expenses till the passage of the bill becomes certain, 
which ought to have much weight; I mean the amount, which 
it is proposed to appropriate for the military service of the 
year. Each head of appropriation has been reduced to its 
lowest amount, and it will require much economy and good 
management to meet the ordinary expenditure of the year. 
You will accordingly take no measure, in the present state of

the business which will much increase the expense of your 
Division. 

Whenever the fate of the bill and report can be ascertained, 
you will be informed and will receive farther instructions. 

I received yesterday, a copy of your letter to Col. Atkin- 
son, and I take a pleasure in saying that he well deserves the 
approbation which you have expressed of his conduct. 



To John Ewing Calhoun. c. c. 

War Dept 23 d March 1820 

DEAR SIR, Your mother was very happy to learn by your 
letter of the 3 d ins*, that you had made so good a disposition 
of the Ferry. She says, that there is no one to whom she 
would prefer having to M r . Deas. 

We have had a letter from James dated from Canton in 
Nov r . last. They have had some very rough weather; but he 
was well, and pleased with the voyage. 

We haA^e had the misfortune to loose our }^oungest child. 
She died last night at 10 o'clock after a most painful illness of 
16 days, the last ten of which we had but little hope of her 
living. She was taken appearantly with a cold, which fell 
first to her right eye, and then on her lungs and bowels. Her 
suffering was very great, which so completely exhausted her, 
that she died without a groan. 

About the same time Com re . Decatur departed this life, in 
consequence of a fatal wound received in the morning in a 
duel with Com 1 ' 6 Baron. The cause of the duel is said to be of 
a long standing, having grown out of the affair of the Chesa- 
peake. His death has here caused the deepest grief; and 
will doubtless be considered by the whole country as most 
mournful event. 

Your mother and sister desire their love to you. Andrew 
and Anna Maria often speak of you; and they say I must 
give their love to you and tell you they want to see you very 
much. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

War Dept. 7 th May 1820 

DEAR JAMES, Your letter from Canton of the 8 th Nov r has 
been received, and it has afforded much pleasure to us all to hear 



LEfTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 173 

of your safe arrival and good health. Your relations and 
acquaintances are very solicitous about .you; and entertain 
high hopes of your attaining one day the highest honor in 
your profession. I am sure, that you will not permit expecta- 
tions so honorable to you. and appearently so well founded to 
be defeated. 

Your mother is residing with us and appears to be very well 
.satisfied. She will not return to Carolina this summer; and 
I hope she will make up her mind to take up her permanent 
residence with us. She has very prudently rented her ferry 
place which will free her from much vexation. We had the 
misfortune to loose our youngest child, Elizabeth, a few weeks 
since. She was born in Octo r and had enjoyed excellent health 
till taken with the disorder of which she expired. Your sister 
and the children are in good health. Andrew and Anna Maria 1 
have grown very much and are very hearty. Andrew learns 
very well and is found of his book. Anna Maria talks very 
distinctly and is very sprightly. They both often talk of you, 
and say they wish to see you much. 

Many of our friends in Carolina have emigrated to Ala- 
bama. Col. Pickens, Joseph his brother and Ezekiel with 
M r Simpson and his family, D r Hunter and his family are 
among the emigrants from Pendleton. From Abbeville they 
are no less numerous, M r Bowie and family, D r Miller and 
family and D r Casey and his family are among those that 
have already or will shortly emigrate. Patrick Noble since 
you left here has been elected Speaker of the house of Rep in our 
State legislature. M r M c Duffie is a candidate for Congress in 
M r Simkins' 3 place, and has no opposition. These are most of 
the changes, which have occurred of a domestick character 
since you sailed. I forgot to say that your brother John is 
still a bachelor; and I believe is likely to remain so. In the 
political world great changes have occurred. The death of 
George the third and the assassination of the Duke of Berri 
in France will probably be attended with important conse- 
quences in both countries. The publick in each is much agi- 
tated from those and other causes. The most important change 
has, however, occurred in Spain. There has been appearently

there a thorough revolution. It commenced with the army 
distined for South America, and has spread over the whole 
Kingdom. The Cortes has been restored, which will probably 
end in the complete overthrow of Ferdinand. There has been 
very little blood shed; and the whole appears to have been 
conducted with much system. Our relation with Spain is still 
unsettled. The treaty has not been ratified, and it is probable 
that we will have to take forcible possession of Florida. 
Wither a seizure would lead to war is uncertain. I think it 
would not; but any opinion in relation to it must be conjectural. 

Com Morris has returned from his cruise extending as far 
as Buenos Ayres. He spent a few days here. His health is 
improved; but he still appears far from stout. He made very 
particular enquiries after you. It is fortunate to obtain the 
good opinion f such excellent officers. The melancholy death 
of Decatur has spread a gloom over the whole country. His 
hold on the affections of his countrymen was strong. His 
place in the Navy board has not been yet supplied. Corn re 
Stuart is spoken of for the place. 

Your mother intends to write by this opportunity and will 
doubtless supply any omission, which I may make in the 
domestick occurrences since you left the U. States. 

Your Sister desires her love to you and Andrew and Maria 
say you must hasten your return.

War Dept. 14 th July, 1820. 

DEAR SIR; I have to acknowledge your favor of the 6 th inst, 
with its inclosure, and regret to learn that the very warm 
weather, which we have experienced, has had an unfavorable 
effect on the health of Mrs. Monroe. We have this morning 
had a very agreeable change in the temperature of the weather. 
It is now cool and pleasant, which cannot fail to have a very 
beneficial effect on the system exhausted by the previous heat. 

Mrs Calhoun and myself are much obliged to you for your 
kind suggestion and offer in relation to the springs near your 
residence in London. I have heard them very highly spoken

of, but traveling, after my long confinement to business, would, 
1 apprehend, be of more service to me than anything else, and 
if I can find leisure, I prefer to take an excursion as far as 
West Point, or perhaps as far as Niagara. It is however very 
doubtful whether I will be able to command the time, as the 
review of the Revolutionary pensions which throws much 
responsibility and discretionary power on this department, 
will I fear engross the whole of my time. I find that almost 
every pensioner under the first act will apply under the last, 
and that it is quite impossible to establish any general rule, as 
to the persons intended to be comprehended by Congress. 
Each case has to be decided under all of its circumstances. I 
have judged it proper to construe the act rigidly; although it 
is probable, that it will excite much complaint. 

The examination at West Point is completed, and the board 
of visitors speak in the highest terms of the condition of the 
institution generally. I enclose for your consideration a 
report of the Academical Staff, which contains the names, 
acquirements and character of those cadets, who in their opin- 
ion are unworthy members of the institution. It is made in 
conformity to regulations. It probably would be the best 
course to give the whole of them an opportunity of resigning, 
and to order their dismission, only in the event of their not 
availing themselves of that indulgence. 

I also enclose a letter from Mr. Noah, 1 as the agent of the 
corporation of New York in relation to Castle Clinton, 2 with 
an extract of the report of the board of fortification. You 
will see by the extract, that it does not enter into the general 
defence of the City. There is an act authorizing the sale of 
only military sites, and I would suggest, as the most advisable 
course, to make a sale to the corporation of the site, at a valua- 
tion to be fixed on by the Executive, or ascertained by disin- 
terested persons mutually appointed, the work to be demolished 
whenever the contemplated work at New York is so far 
advanced as to authorize the step. The object of the corpora- 
tion is to obtain the position as a gift, on the ground, that it was 
transferred to the general government, without any pecuniary 
consideration, but this I conceive can only be done by Con- 
gress, and in the mean time before the work would be ordered

to be demolished, an application might be made to Congress 
by the Corporation to effect the object which they have in 
view. 

I transmit the proceedings of the court martial in the case 
of private Farrell, for the crime of desertion. He has been 
ordered to be shot, but presuming that you would order a 
pardon, I have one drawn up for your signature, which is 
enclosed. I enclose for your perusal several letters from Col. 
Johnson. l His brother's transportation contract will probably 
about square with the advances, but his brother will fall 
greatly indebted to the government on his provision contracts 
for 1815, 'IT, '18. His present object is to obtain the trans- 
portation contract for West Point for his brother. I would 
be glad of your opinion in relation to it. 

My present impression is that to avoid all censure, the con- 
tract ought to be made on publick proposals. Will you be 
good enough as to return his letters, when you are done with 
them. 

General Jackson has agreed to act as a commissioner in the 
pending Chickasaw treaty. A commission has been made out 
and transmitted to him. I will write to Gov. Miller in rela-

DEAR SIR, I yesterday enclosed you a commission with a 
letter of instruction to treat with the Creek Indians. Gen 1 
Flornoy is associated with you, but, you being first named in 
the commission are, according to usage, considered at its 
head. Your powers are made very full; and it is not doubted, 
that if the land can be acquired by energetick but fair measures, 
but that you will be successful. The State of Georgia is very 
anxious for the acquisition, and will regard the result of your 
negotiation with great interest. It is expected that the whole,

or nearly so, of the acquisition, if one should be made, will be 
within her limits, as the appropriation was made on the appli- 
cation of her legislature. I am fearful that the Creeks are not 
disposed to make a cession; but it is hoped that they will yield 
ultimately to the wishes of the government. It is neither for 
their interest, or ours, that they should occupy so much more 
land than is necessary for their use. 

Your Commission would have been made out sooner, but 
the President is absent from the city, and some delay took 
place in hearing from him. 

We have nothing new from Spain; but must soon hear in 
what manner the Cortes views the affair of the Floridas. The 
Spanish government, expresses much friendship, but it may 
be fairly doubted, whether it will go far for the present. I 
do sincerely hope for the interest of both nations, that by 
doing justice, it will terminate an affair, which has been kept 
too long open. 

Myself and family are well; and M rs . Calhoun and her 
mother join their love to you and our relations in Pendleton. 
I set out next week on a tour to Niagara; and will not return 
till the middle of Sep r . 



To David B. Mitchell. 1 

Department of War, 9 th August, 1820. 

SIR, I enclose an extract of a letter from Col. Hayne, by 
which it appears that the road from Georgia to Alabama, will 
yet require considerable labour upon it to put it in good con- 
dition. 

Congress appropriated, in 1816 $5000, and in 1818 $5000 to 
be expended upon this road, and an additional appropriation 
of $3300 was made at the late session, for the same object 
making together the sum of $13,300. The two first sums were 
remitted to you, at different periods, shortly after they were 
appropriated, to be applied as contemplated by Congress; and 
I cannot direct a further expenditure upon the road, until I 
am informed whether there will be a sufficiency left of the

appropriations, (including the last, which has not been remitted 
to you) to cover it, after paying all the expenses which you 
have already incurred. You will report to me, as early as 
practicable the precise amount of your disbursements, the 
amount of accounts yet to be paid, and the balance which will 
probably remain of the whole appropriation of 13,300. If it 
should appear that there will be a sufficient sum remaining to 
make the improvements upon the road required, it will be 
remitted to you immediately, that the work may be done while 
the weather continues favorable. 

I enclose an extract of a letter from M r . Merriwether, 
respecting his claim for opening a part of the road before 
mentioned, and he has been referred to you for payment. If 
you should not have funds sufficient to pay M r . Merriwether, 
you will inform this Department of it, and the sum necessary 
for the purpose, will be remitted to you.

DEAR JOHN, It is a long time since we have heard from 
you You, I suppose, have been so busily engaged with the 
people, as not to afford you time to correspond with your 
friends. Setting jesting aside, I am glad, that you offered 
for the legislature; and hope sincerely, that you have suc- 
ceeded; altho', I should suppose, in such a district as Pendle- 
ton, your success would be doubtful. The place will suit you 
well. It will give you opportunity for improvement, while 
you may be of essential service to the state. I, in fact, deem 
it the duty of every man of education and leisure, to bring 
himself forward, in publick business. It is thus dignity will 
be given to publick affairs and the state usefully served. 

I had a long and a very pleasant and useful excursion to 
the North. I extend[ed] my journey to Niagara, Sacketts 
harbour, Montreal, Plattsburgh and Boston. The travelling

a most flattering kind; and with little exception, I found the 
military posts in excellent condition. 

Your mother wishes you to make arrangements at Clergy 
Hall for another year. She thinks, if Clark has done pretty 
well, of which she leaves you to judge, that he had better be 
retained at the same terms on which he was employed this 
year. If his conduct has been such as not to make it advis- 
able to retain him, she leaves the employment of another and 
the terms on which he ought to be employed wholly to your 
discretion. She would prefer to engage by the month and to 
pay in money to giveing a part of the crop. Believing that 
you would not be in the lower country in time, she has 
ret | nested John E. Bonneau to attend to her ferry place, and 
requested him to offer the place to M r . Deas for another year. 
If M r . Deas has expressed any desire to you on the subject, 
she would be glad that you would let John E. B. know of it. 

We have nothing interesting from Europe but what you 
will see in the publick papers. The last accounts from Spain 
represent that the Cortes had the Florida question before 
them. The result is not yet known. We have not heard 
from James since he left Manilla. Andrew and Anna Maria 
have grown much and often say they wish to see you. Your 
mother will not be in Carolina before next summer; and she 
and your sister desire their love to you.

would reach you before your departure from Pendleton to

1 am heartily glad, that you have been elected a member of

and information to serve their country in that station. I find 
it the opinion of some of your friends, that you might have 
been elected to Congress with ease; and I hope at the next 
election you .will turn your eyes to a seat in that body. The 
post will suit you well, while you remain single. It will 
extend the sphere of your usefulness, improvement, and 
enjoyment.

I have received the money paid to D r . Simonds; and I hope 
that your collection will enable you to make me a farther remit- 
tance. I will stand much in need of funds by the last of 
Jan y . and it would be very convenient for me to draw on you 
or D r . Simonds should you be in funds for a few hundred dol- 
lars at that time. 1 would advise writing to our debtors 
immediately, and to threaten them with suit, should they not 
pay, what they owe. Your mother is glad to learn, that 
Clark has done so well this year; and she is desirous to know, 
whether you have retained him or employed another for the 
next. She wishes her cotton to be sent to market with your's, 
which she hopes will be at an early period, as she is entirely 
out of money. If it should be sent to Augusta or Charleston, 
when sold by placing the proceeds in the hands of my factors 
at the former, or D r Simonds in the latter place and notifying 
me, I will be able to have the amount remitted through the 
Branch Bank at this place. Your mother wishes you to inform 
her, when the rent will be due from M r Peas for her ferry 
place. 

I return the papers, in the case of the deceased soldier, 
James. You will see by the memorandum on the back, that 
M r . Harris has not certified, whether the mother is the heir, 
or in fact who is the heir of the Soldier. The certificate of 
heirship is indispensible. By the memorandum in red ink you

favour of the 21 st Dec r ; and I hope that you have quite recov- 
ered from the effect of your indisposition at Columbia. Tho' 
there have been so many deaths here among the members of 
Congress, the city 1 am inclined to think enjoys nearly its 
usual state of health. I know of but few instances of sickness 
among the residents; among them however is your mother. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 181 

She has been confined to her room for about a fortnight, and 
is still quite indisposed. She was attacked with a ringing in 
her ear, accompanied with much pain and inflamation, which 
have subsided in a great measure; but have been, within the 
last two days, succeeded by a fever. As yet it has been mod- 
erate, and we hope it will pass away in a few days. 

We have at length certain news of the ratification of the 
Spanish treaty. It has not yet been received by the govern- 
ment; but letters have been received from M r . Forsyth, an- 
nouncing the fact. 1 It is an important event, particularly for 
the Southern States. I still hope, that Missouri will be admit- 
ted before the end of the session; and that a question, which 
has so deeply agitated this country will be settled forever. 
Both sides have moderated very much. 

We have had no late intelligence from James. He is not 
expected before the last of the Spring. 

I hope that our debtors in the lower country will pay what 
they owe, out of this year's crop. They have been long 
indulged; and cannot complain should they be sued. Should 
you find leisure to visit Washington, it would afford us much 
pleasure. I expect to visit Carolina after the session; and if 
you should come on, you had better make your arrangement 
to return at the same time. I am truly happy to learn that 
Patrick Noble gives so much satisfaction as speaker. He has 
a very sound understanding, and his character is calculated to 
give a lasting popularity. Your Mother, sister and the chil- 
dren desire their love to you. We will be glad to hear from 
vou often. 



To Andrew Jackson* 

Department of War, March 22nd, 1821. 
SIR, To execute the instructions which you have received, 
through the Department of State to take possession of Ea-;t 
and West Florida, you will proceed with as little delay as

may be practicable, to the cantonment of Monntpelier, where 
as has been communicated to you in your instructions, you 
will receive notice of the arrival of Col. Forbes at Pensacola. 

The Deputy Quarter Master Majr. Stanton has been ordered 
to the same place, who will receive and execute your com- 
mands, as connected with the Quarter Masters Dept. , and the 
enclosed copies of orders from that and the Commissary s De- 
partments will inform you of the arrangement, which has been 
made, as to transports and provisions. Major Cross will be 
ordered to Amelia Island to superintend the arrangements in 
that quarter, and I trust that on your arrival at the canton- 
ment you will find these arrangements so far matured, that 
you will be ready to take possession in a very short period, 
should the Spanish authorities be prepared to give it. It was 
deemed adviseable to issue the orders here, to avoid any pos- 
sible delay. 

Genl. Gaines has been ordered to this place, where he will 
be by the 10th of next month, to aid with his advice and in- 
formation in the reduction of the Army; and it is doubtful 
whether he will return to his Head Quarters in time to take 
possession of St. Augustine should you in the exercise of your 
powers select him for that purpose, and I would therefore 
suggest in that event, that you should at the same time give 
provisional power to some other officer to act in his place, 
should he be absent. 

The 4th Regiment of Infantry and the Company of Artil- 
lery at Mobile will occupy Pensacola and the Barancas; the 
Garrisons of Fort Gadsden, which will be evacuated, will 
occupy St. Marks, and the two companies of artillery, sent 
from Boston to Amelia Island, St. Augustine. They will be 
governed in their movements for that purpose by your orders. 
The companies ordered to Amelia Island, with the provisions 
which have been ordered by the Commy. Genl. to that place 
for the transportation of the Spanish Garrison at St. Augus- 
tine to the Havannah, will go in the transports to St. Augustine. 

Your command as Major Genl. will not, under the Act of 
Congress of the 2d instant reducing the army terminate, till 
the 1st of June next, to which period your pay in that ca- 
pacity will continue. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 183 

To Jedidiah Morse. 1 

Department of War, 2d April 1821. 

DR SIR, I have to acknowledge your letters of the 26th Feb- 
ruary, and the 3d and 21st of March with the portions of 
your report which accompanied them, and to offer you an 
apology for the long delay in making my answer. A con- 
tinued and uncommonly severe pressure of business which did 
not admit of being postponed must be my apology, and when 
I inform you that I have not had one days relaxation since I 
saw you in Washington and that the weight of business such 
as you then witnessed has diminished but very little, 1 think 
you will make some allowance for the delay. 

To begin with your favour of the 26th February; the in- 
formant of your correspondent certainly laboured under a 
mistake in supposing that there was the least disposition on 
my part to withhold any portion of the information to be 
derived from Major Youngs remarks on Florida. On the 
contrary, I am anxious to give every publicity to the geo- 
graphical and topographical information contained in the De- 
partment for the benefit of the community, excepting only 
such portions of the latter, as may be connected with the im- 
mediate defence of the County, and you of course have acted 
in accordance with the views of the Department in using 
freely such as you had obtained. 

The President has perused with care the portions of your 
report contained in your two last favours, and I have his 
directions in returning them to you, to express his wish that 
you should draw up your report on all points as fully as you 
may judge advisable, and according to your views of the 
policy which ought to be adopted in our relations with the 
Indians. Much of the value of the report will depend on its 
presenting the entire and individual views of one, who has 
reflected so much on the subject on which it treats, and who 
has taken so much pains to be correctly informed. On a sub- 
ject which has already excited much interest, and which will

probably hereafter excite still more, it would be improper for 
the Executive to express any opinion till after it has made 
itself fully acquainted with all the facts. With this view 
without forming or expressing an opinion on any portion of 
your report it is the wish of the President that you would 
make it as full and ample as you may desire. All of the facts 
and reflections which it may communicate will aid in furnish- 
ing the means by which the government may ultimately adopt 
a correct policy in relation to the Indians. 

The President doubts the propriety of publishing your 
report at this moment. The subject of which it treats will 
probably claim the attention of the next Congress in which 
event should the department be called on as is usual to furnish 
the information which it may possess, it might make an unfavor- 
able impression to la} T before Congress a report already pub- 
lished by the sanction of the Executive. The proper course 
at present would seem to be to obtain all of the light which 
may be practicable in relation to the Indians, and the existing 
intercourse with them, to digest the whole with care, and be 
prepared to present to Congress should these subjects claim 
their attention, a well digested body of facts, and a system 
which would be fully sustained by such facts. It was with a 
view to this in part that you were originally employed by the 
President, and he doubts not that the fruits of your researches 
and reflections will contribute materially to a correct decision. 

With the view which the President has taken in relation to 
your report, it will not be necessary to designate such parts 
as ought to be confidential, or private, as you suggested in 
your letter of the 21st March. Should it be communicated to 
Congress it would then be the proper time to make the desig- 
nation, if any portion of it should be of a nature not proper 
to communicate, which however I do not presume will be the 
case. 

I hope that your health will improve with the return of 
warm weather. 1 am not surprised that you should have felt 
the severity of last winters cold so severely, when it was such 
as to render it very unpleasant to the best constitutions. 

Mrs. Calhoun and her Mother desire their best lespects to 
yourself and Mrs. Morse. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 185 

To Timothy Pickering. 1 

Washington 29 th April 1821. 

DEAR SIR, My time was so constantly engaged during the 
hist session of Congress in meeting the incessant calls on the 
War Department for information, and since the adjournment, 
in bringing up the portion of business, which I was com- 
pelled to neglect, and in reorganizing the army, that my pri 
vate correspondence has been almost wholly suspended. 
Among my unanswered letters, I find your esteemed favour of 
the 26 th Dec r , and tho' late, you will permit me to express 
the great satisfaction, which 1 experienced from your appro- 
bation of my report on the reduction of the army. The 
approbation of the wise and virtuous is what I court; and 1 
trust, that on all occasions, that my conduct shall evince, at 
least a desire, to deserve it. To speak the truth boldly, tho' 
not always pleasant, is, I conceive, one of the first of the 
duties of a publick officer, and in performing that, which you 
have been pleased to approbate, I was determined to adhere 
rigidly to that duty. It is mere deception to place our mili- 
tia on the footing of regular troops, and the reference to the 
militia of Rome, or Switzerland to establish the superiority 
of ours is an unworthy sophism to maintain that deception. 
I n our sense of the word, they were not militia. These coun- 
rios ought to be considered as cantonments, and their inhab- 
itants the garrison. This state of things could only be produced, 
or continued by that constantly impending danger to which 
you so justly refer, as its cause. No nation occupy a situa- 
tion so much the opposite, as ourselves; and if we think 
soundly, we must expect the opposite effect. It is true, that 
much space, great personal freedom and plenty give to our 
people individual valour; but they cannot give organization, 
or discipline, which are the elements of military power. In 
coining to this conclusion, 1 am by no means disposed to set 
the militia aside. Let them be armed and organized into com- 
panies and regiments; let them be mustered, to see that their 
arms are in a good condition; and let the use of fire arms be 
proved, where necessary, by the awarding of premiums to

the best marksman. This may be done; beyond it, in the 
present state of our country, it will be difficult to proceed. A 
militia thus prepared will answer all of the purposes for which 
they ought to be intended, either for the defence of the coun- 
try, or the preservation of our liberty. The country would 
thus be taught to look to their real use, instead of assigning 
duties to them, to which they are wholly inadequate; and in 
which the only results, which can be justly anticipated, are 
defeat and an enormous augmentation of the public expendi- 
ture. 

On the defence of the eastern portion of our northern 
frontier, I substantial!}^ concur, with the exception of works 
to command lake Champlain. After 1 came to the Depart- 
ment, the works on that frontier, with the exception of those 
at Rouses point, were stoped. Those have been since sus- 
pended, from the belief, that they would fall on the Canadian 
side of the line. 1 I felt disposed to give some importance to 
those works, under the idea, that lake Champlain ought to be 
considered in the light of a canal, and that the cheapest mode 
of preserving its entire and unmolested use, was by fortify- 
ing its northern extremity. The completion of what is called 
the northern canal in New York, connecting the waters of the 
Hudson with this lake, gives to this channel of communication 
great importance; and would justify a very considerable ex- 
pense to close it wholly against our neighbour. In addition 
to this, I am inclined to think the military road from Platts- 
burgh to the 8* Lawrence, from the peculiar character of that 
portion of the frontier, not without its importance. In addi- 
tion to the labour of the troops, it will cost but little. 

Doubtless our attention ought to be drawn mainly to our 
maritime frontier. For its defence, we must unquestionably 
look first to the navy, and next to a judicious system of for- 
tifications. Both of these have, and continue to claim, much 
of the attention of the government; and .if persevered in 
steadily and judiciously must, in a few years, greatly increase 
our capacity either to defend ourselves, or to assail an enemy. 

I hope that you continue to enjoy good health, and I pray 
you to accept of the assurance of my respect and esteem.

Arbitrations, 1, 119,151.

To John Ewing Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 6 th May 1821. 

DEAR JOHN, We were quite disapointed in not hearing 
from you while in the lower country. I had directed one, or 
two letters to Charleston addressed to 3 r ou, which, I expected, 
you would receive on your arrival there, but not having heard 
from you, I fear, that the}^ may have been forwarded to you 
at Pendleton. We have not heard from James for some time. 
The Congress has been expected for several weeks, and her 
arrival can not be much longer delayed. As soon as he arrives, 
your mother, I expect, will set out for Pendleton. Her health 
is very good again. I expected to visit Carolina this season, 
but have declined it, for the want of time as you used to say. 
The reduction of our military establishment, would detain me 
hear till near the last of this month which would make it too 
late to go south. Our spring is very cold and backward. 
The forest is still more brown, than green. I enclose your 
notifications of warrants in the case of the James'. The heirs 
will endorse on them where they wish the location and transmit 
them to the commissioner of the Gen 1 , land office. 

Our last arrival from Europe has brought us important 
intelligence. We may not only hope, but have some confi- 
dence, that the allied powers will be baffled. The movement 
in Peidmont is most important, and if maintained, must drive 
the Austrians out of Italy. Europe seems on the eve- of a 
great revolution. Feudalism is gone, and its effects on the 
state of society nearty vanished. She can no longer be gov- 
erned by the reverence, which it created for certain families. 
Either force or right must govern, and we may, with a good 
deal of confidence, expect that it will be the latter. 

Should Col Pickens be in Pendleton remember me to him 
most affectionately. Your mother and sister with the children 
desire their love to you. Our little Irishman, Patrick, grows 
finely. Andrew goes to school in the country, but it is now 
vacation, and he is at home. M r Hillhousc passed through 
Washington to Phil a a few days since. He is well.

War Dept 13 th May 1821 

DEAR SIR, Your favour of the 22 d of April came to hand a 
few days since, and I infer from it, that my two last letters to 



188 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

you have failed, as you do not mention, that you received any 
from me while in the lower country. I wrote to you a short 
time since very fully, which letter, 1 hope, you will receive. 

I have not yet heard from D^ Simonds, from which, it would 
seem, that Rice has not made good his promise to take up his 
bond. I wrote to the Doctor to day, to inform me whether 
there was any prospect of his payment. 

We have had very late news, from Europe. The Neapoli- 
tans have acted most cowardly. They yielded all without 
resistance. The result is very mortifying to every friend of 
freedom. They were unworth} 7 of their cause. Had their 
resistance been such, as it ought to have been, it would have 
given a new face to the political state of Europe. 

Cotton has improved considerably; so, if you have not sold, 
you may realize the truth of the maxim, that there is luck in 
leisure. Your Mother wishes hers sold and the proceeds placed 
in the hands of Cantalous and Co in Augusta (my factors) in 
order that, I may draw for it. You will please to inform me 
of the amount, as soon as you have sold, as she needs the 
mone}^. It is still uncertain when she will return. The Con- 
gress has not yet arrived, nor has she been heard of for several 
months. Her arrival must soon take place, when your mother 
says she will return immediately to Carolina. 

We are all well; and all desire to be remembered to you in 
the most affectionate manner.

Department of War 18 June 1821 

D r SIR, More recent information from the Havannah has 
rendered it unnecessary, in the opinion of members of the 
administration, to come to any decision on the points presented 
by your letter of the 13 th instant. No further delay is feared 
in passing the possession of the Province 2 into our hands. I 
return the copy of the letter to M r Adams as you requested. 
1 have received the proceedings of the Court Martial in the 
case of Col. Chambers, which 1 herewith enclose. He has 
been found guilty of the charge preferred against him, and

has been sentenced to be suspended for one month, which how- 
over, the Court recommends to be remitted. The sentence 
would seem to be very inadequate to the Offence; and altho' 
there are mitigating circumstances, I doubt not, the punish- 
ment will be thought to be very inadequate by the community. 
I regret, that so correct an Officer, as Genl Smith was thought 
to be, should have set the example of such illegal and odious 
punishment; and that a knowledge of it had not then reached 
the Government, so that our immediate check might have been 
put to it. The truth appears to be, that the Officers of the 
Army, at the end of the War, had a very erroneous mode of 
thinking, as well on this, as many other points, which took 
some years to. correct. I believe the establishment is now 
thoroughly reformed of most of the faults, which grew out 
of the incidents of the War. I propose however, to order a 
Summary Statement of all proceedings of Courts Martial and 
punishments inflicted on the soldiers to be transmitted to the 
Office of. the Adjutant Genl. so that the government may at 
once, check any abuse which may appear. 1 do not doubt, but 
that the example of Genl Smith, and the supposed necessity 
of the case were the real cause of Col Chamber's improper 
and illegal conduct. 

I enclose for your information the Illinois Intelligencer, 
which gives an account of the proceedings of the Court in the 
case of the two Indian Murderers, who have been lately con- 
victed. While in the custody of the civil authority, they 
seem to have been most shamefully treated. M r Adams is 
inclined to think, that their sufferings have been so great, as 
to make a question, whether a respite ought not to be given 
to both, with a view to examine into their case. You will 
remember, that the younger has already been respited. I am 
inclined to think, that it would be dangerous not to execute 
at least one. Since the murder was committed for which these 
Indians have been tried, another has been perpetrated by the 
same tribe, and the murderer lately delivered up for trial; 
and yesterday's mail brought the account of the murder of 
Doct. Madison of the 3 d Regiment, on his way from Green 
Buy to Chicago. An example would seem to be necessary. 

I herewith return the letter of M r Adams in favor of Doct. 
Waterhouse. 1 The Doct. certainly has claims on the govern- 
or. Benjamin Waterhouse of Cambrid.ee (17-'4-1846), a noteworthy promoter of the

ment; and I regret the service did not admit of his retention. 
The grounds for omitting his name in the New Register were, 
because he had not the confidence of the Officers at the post, 
as a Physician; and the reduced number in the Medical De.pt. 
under the last Act, has made it necessary to station the Surgeons 
and their assistants at the more important posts, and to em- 
ploy Citizen Physicians at the others. The Post at Water- 
town, to which the Doctor had been assigned before the 
reduction, is comprised in the latter description, and a Citizen 
Physician has been accordingly employed there, at a cost not 
equal to a fifth part of the pay, to which the Doctor would 
have been entitled had lie been retained for the post. The 
first objection which is stated to his retention was, I under- 
stand, so strong, that the Officers were in the habit of einploy- 
ing a private Physician at their own expence, rather than to 
trust to him. The fact seems to be that tho' a man of talent 
and science, from some cause, he has not made himself a good 
practical Physician. 

I enclose for your consideration two letters one from Genl 
Jackson, and the other from Col. Butler which I received this 
morning. The latter asks for instruction as to the Indians 
near S fc Augustine, but I suppose he had better be referred 
to Genl. Jackson, who has been fully instructed; and be 
informed if the Indians should apply for his advice to refer 
them to the General. 

I regret to find by Genl Jackson's letter that he had not 
received his instruction as to the Indians in Florida, but I 
think it probable that the Sub- Agent has arrived before this 
time, and from the instructions to him, he will have a pretty 
full view of the policy which it is thought proper to pursue 
in relation to them. A copy will be sent forthwith of the 
instructions to Genl Jackson.

so bad. I sincerely hope that your voyage to Europe may 
completely reinstate your health, and that you may realize 
your intention of returning November. Your absence from 
your seat in Congress would be a subject of deep regret. 
Though the state of the country in a political point of view 
appears quiet, yet questions of very considerable magnitude 
will probably be agitated at the next Session. I fear too, 
that the temper exhibited by so many of the members of the 
House of Representatives at the last Session to prostrate the 
whole of our establishments, will again reappear in that body. 
Should such be the fact, it is very desirable that it should be 
promptly resisted and put down. 

1 am much obliged to you for your kind offer of service; 
and the Secretary of State requests me to say to you that he 
will avail himself of your offer by putting in your charge 
dispatches to our ministers abroad, if they can be prepared in 
time. I am also requested by the President to inform you 
that he has received your letter, which he has been prevented 
from answering as yet, by indisposition, but hopes to be able 
to write to you in a day or two. 

The desire to make a transfer on the part of Capts. Burd 
and Morris had been made to the office of the Adjutant Gen- 
eral and I had directed him to inform them, that there is no 
objection to it, but the condition which Capt. Morris requested 
to be annexed, of being continued in command at St. Marks, 
for one year. There is scarcely a doubt but he would be con- 
tinued for at least that time, but the Department never assents 
to conditions in such cases. 

I will be very happy to hear from you while in Europe. 

I wish you a safe and pleasant voyage.

War Dept 20 th July 1821 

DEAR SIR, I enclose for your consideration, and direction in 
relation to it, a letter from Gen 1 Scott of the ^ 6 th Ins*, by which 
you will perceive, that the work, which has been entrusted to

his execution, is completed, and that he claims a farther com- 
pensation for his extra services in completing it. 

In order, that you ma}' have a full view of the claim, I 
enclose for your information the correspondence, which has 
taken place between him and this Department in relation to 
his compensation, and a copy of a statement of the amount, 
which has been paid him through the office of the 2 d Auditor, 
which together with the sum of $900 that was paid to him by 
the order of M r Edwards, in my absence to the South, of 
which I was not informed, when I ordered the payment to him 
through the 2 d Auditor, makes his compensation already 
allowed amount to $2328. 

It does really appear to me, that the allowance has been very 
great, and that any additional allowance, must cause hereafter 
much excitement. 1 should even think, that if the General 
should succeed next winter to obtain the decision of the attor- 
ney Gen 1 in favour of his brevet pay, for the same period, a 
deduction ought to be made for the sum already allowed. 

Should you, however, take a different view, and be of the 
opinion, that a farther allowance ought to be made, I must 
ask your direction, whether the sum, which you may order 
for an allowance should be paid to him, or be only carried to 
his credit, as he stands a debtor to the Government to a con- 
siderable amount at the Treasury. 

I enclose for your consideration a Treatise on Artillery by 
General Lollemond, 1 and recommend, that so much of it, as 
is comprehended in the work, beginning with the Exercise of 
Field Artillery and ending with mechanical manoevures, 
including school for the Battle (field) piece, school for the 
field batteries, school of the Batteries, Evolution of Batteries, 
Exercise and Management of Seige, Garrison and Sea coast 
guns, be adopted for the service of the U. States. 

The Treatise has been examined with care by several of our 
most distinguished artillery officers, all of whom concur in 
recommending its adoption.

establishment of the Champ d'Asile in Texas in 1817, and published the book alluded to

DEAR SIR, I have received your note of yesterday enclosing 
a letter from D r Waterhouse, which 1 herewith return. 

As the Doctor does not seem disposed to leave Boston, or 
its neighbourhood, I do not think, it will be possible, through 
this Department, to make any satisfactory arrangement for 
him. Doctor Mann 2 is the only surgeon employed by the 
Department in the vicinity of Boston, excepting the citizen 
surgeon at Watertown, who receives but $100 annually; and 
from the long service of D r . Mann and his high standing, I do 
not think, that he could with propriety be removed from that 
to any other post. He is, I believe, a native of Boston, and 
has been stationed there ever since the peace. 

1 enclose, for your consideration, letters recommending cer- 
tain persons to be appointed to till vacancies in the Militia of 
Alexandria. The character of M r Jones, who is recommended 
for the principal vacancy, is so well known to you, as to 
require no observation from me.

my part. 1 am under the impression, that the place to be 
filled is among the most important in our military establish- 
ment, particularly in a period of peace. On the skill, the 
industry, firmness and impartiality of the Insp r General, the 
discipline and condition of the troops must, to a considerable 
extent, depend. If he is known to possess the requisite quali- 
fications, very few officers would venture to neglect their 
duty, and if they did, it could not pass long unobserved. 
Among the officers named, I am inclined to think, that, as it 
regards mere qualifications, seperate from extraneous circum- 
stances, the preference ought to be given to Col Eustis and 
Maj r Archer; and of these two, I am inclined to think the 
latter. As far as my information extends, I should suppose, 
that, in many respects, they are equal; but I should put greater 
reliance in the rigid impartiality (unbiased by any considera- 
tion, but a regard to truth and duty) of Maj r Archer. 

If connected circumstances, in addition to merit are to be 
taken into consideration, it appears to me that this view of the 
subject would confine the selections to Cols Eustis and Jones 
and Maj r . Archer. Cols Leavensworth and Butler are now 
full L*. Colonels, and senior to all others in the infantry of 
the same grade, and consequently may at no distant period 
expect to be full colonels. They both, it is true, have lost a 
little by the reduction, but I think they have no cause of com- 
plaint. 

As it regards the other three, their claims are very strong, 
under the view, which I am now taking. You are so fully 
acquainted with Col Jones, that it will not be necessary to say 
anything of his. It is very strong; but, I am sorry to say, 
that, I think he has weakened it by the impertinent, and 
objectionable manner, in which he pressed his claim as Adj*. 
Gen 1 . Among other expedients to which he resorted, I am 
told, he threatened Genl Brown, that he would use [h]is influ- 
ence to excite the Virginia delegation to lopp off the office of 
Mj r . Gen 1 , at the next session. I do not doubt, but that such 
rash and- inconsiderate declaration is to be attributed to pas- 
sion, but still it indicates a want of proper military feelings, 
and it makes it more difficult to bestow on him the special 
notice of the government, as it might be attributed to improper 
motives. The case of Mj r . Archer I belive is fully known to 
you. His success in the late war, his long continuance in the

same grade, without any hopes of rising from it soon, and his 
not having received the same notice from the government, that 
others, with whom he acted and with whom he was equally 
distinguished on the frontier With the exception of the bril- 
liancy of the service, Eustis' case is no less strong, than Mj r . 
Archer's. He was a Maj r . before the late war and is still but 
a Maj 1 ., tho he is the senior Maj r . and will rise with the first 
vacancy. He is very sore, it is said, at Towson's appointment, 
and at his being transferred from Boston, his former station, 
to St. Augustine, which, considering that he has a family of 
five or six children, will operate severely on him* 

It is proper to observe as it regards Mj r . Archer, that he 
was informed during the late reduction when Towson received 
his appointment of Colonel, that the Go\ rt . was fully apprized 
of his merit, and regretted that it had not had an opportunity 
of giving him any proof of it; but that when it could be done 
with propriety ) it would afford it much pleasure. 

The dispatch is just about to depart, which compels me to 
conclude and send my observations as they have been hastily 
put down. 

I expect to leave here on Monday and M r Hagner, 1 whose 
health is not good, is desirous of accompanying me, and has 
requested me to ask permission for him. His business, he 
informs me, is so arranged that he may be absent a few 
weeks, without any serious inconvenience.

DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 10* 1 . 1 Ins* was received on my 
return from an excursion to the Bedford Springs in Pennsyl- 
vania. We had a very pleasant excursion and returned in 
high health; but found the city so sickly, that my family left 
it immediately to spend some time with a friend a few miles 
out of town, whose neighbourhood has been exempt from the 
prevailing fever. The sickness is not peculiar to this place, 
but spreads with little exception over the whole country quite 
into the Mountains. I found the fine valley between the Blue

Ridge and the North Mountains, in which Carlisle is situated 
laboring every where under bilious fever. James set out on 
a tour to Niagara, Montreal, &c about six weeks ago, but has 
not yet returned. As soon as he returns, which is now ex- 
pected every day, he and your mother will set out on their 
return to Carolina, So that you may expect them not long 
after this letter. They will give you all of news, which will 
except me from the necessity of giving you a long letter. I 
was much pleased with the agriculture in the parts of Mary- 
land and Penn a through which I passed. They work to much 
more advantage than what we do. I spend a day with a friend 
of mine, a farmer, near Harrisburgh, and examined with care 
every part of his farm. His land is not so good naturally as 
that in Calhourvs settlement, yet he makes much more to the 
hand than what we do. He rents most of his farm for half of 
the product. The part that he cultivates is of considerable 
extent, yet he hires steadily, but one negro fellow at 5$ per 
month. He informs me that he raises independently of what 
he gets from his tenants, in average years, about 800 bushels 
of corn, 500 of wheat and nearly the same quantity of oats and 
rye, besides grass. He hires, in harvest, additional labour; 
but this source of expenditure he thinks does not exceed $i40; 
and himself and his son in law, who lives with him aids his 
labourer particularly in harvest and planting, but the whole 
of the ploughing, harrowing, and the attending to his horses, 
cattle and hogs is done by the single labourer. I know my 
friend to be a man of the strictest veracity, and the state- 
ment may be fully relied on. To us it must appear all most 
incredible; but when we come to examine his mode of culti- 
vation our surprise will cease. Take for instance the Indian 
corn. He prepares the ground thoroughly for it before it is 
planted, but after that, instead of ploughing, as we do 4, 5 or 
6 times, he gives it but one harrowing and one ploughing. 1 
saw his field so cultivated. The corn had been injured by the 
drought, but still I think it would give 30 bushels an acre. 
I think there are three causes why they can raise corn with so 
little labour. The ground being deeply ploughed and the 
surface thoroughly turned down, much of the weeds' and 
grass' seeds do not sprout the next summer; the clover culti- 
vation expels both the grass and weeds to a great extent; and 
the corn is planted so close, about 3 feet apart both ways, as 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 197 

to overshadow and prevent the growth of grass and weeds. 
The two first causes may be introduced with us, and the last 
by making our ground rich and obtaining our seed corn from 
the north might also be, I should suppose. 

Were I in your situation, I would not hesitate to obtain an 
overseer from about Hagerstown where the farming appears 
to l)e equally good. Your society could not, I am satisfied, 
give so great an impulse by any other means to your agricul- 
ture, as by yourself or some one of your members by obtain- 
ing an overseer from there, or London in Virginia, where 
I am told the same mode of farming is introduced. This 
might be done by giving a premium to the person who would 
obtain one from either of these places who should be well rec- 
ommended. Were I on my farm, I would not loose one year 
in obtaining an overseer from one or the other of those places. 
You will sec b}^ this letter that my passion for farming is not 
abated. In fact I consider my absence from my farm among 
my greatest sacrifices. I must request you not to bring this 
letter before 3 r our society, for in looking over it, I have inter- 
lined in so many places, I would be ashamed of it. 

The children often speak of you and express a great desire 
to go to Carolina. 



To James Monroe.^ 

Department of War, 28th September, 1.821. 

DEAR SIR: I returned from my excursion, on the 19th inst., 
and had the pleasure to find that the business of the Depart- 
ment had not suffered in my absence; and I have since my 
return dispatched nearly the whole which had been suspended 
during my absence. Being informed, that you would not 
return to London till the end of this week, I have delayed 
writing to you, and transmitting such papers as would require 
your direction till this time. 

The condition of the Seminole Indians in Florida is such as 
to require the immediate attention of Government. They 
have been shamefully imposed on, and barbarously treated 
by unprincipled individuals and by the Creek nation of Indi-

ment of War; text from an official copy.

ans; as the inclosed papers from Gov. Jackson, Capt. Bell 
and Mr. Penieres, the Sub- Agent, will fully illustrate. 

General Jackson having stated to me in a private letter, 
that he would leave Pensacola about the 1st of next month for 
Nashville, and deeming some immediate measure necessary 
for the security and tranquility of the Indians I have thought 
it advisable to vest Captain Bell with temporary authority to 
act as agent, and have directed him to 'repair immediately 
with the sub-agent to the nation, and to explain to the Chief 
the friendly disposition of the Government, and to assure 
them of its protection, if they should continue to demean 
themselves peaceably. He is also authorized to adopt such 
measures as he may deem proper to correct the existing abuses, 
particularly by ordering off without delay such individuals 
living among them as are of notoriously bad character. As 
connected with this subject I have written to the Creek Agent, 
and informed him, that the Government views with marked 
disapprobation the excursion of the Creeks into the Seminole 
Country for the purpose of plundering, and that should they 
repeat it they will be held responsible for the consequence. 
The Seminole Indians ought certain!} 7 to surrender slaves, who 
have absconded from their masters, but it ought to be done 
by regular demand, through the proper authority, and on 
sufficient proof of the facts. You will see by the letter of 
Mr. Crowell, the Creek Agent, a copy of which I enclose, that 
about 50 of the captured negroes have been delivered to him 
and that he purposes to advertize them in order to deliver 
them to the owners, should they appear, and if not, to sell 
them for their benefit. I have directed him to hold them till 
the subject has received your consideration and order. The 
course which the Agent proposes would appear proper, but 
still, I fear, when it is considered how little prospect there is 
of many of the owners in that Country, so destitute of papers 
and roads, being informed of what has become of their slaves, 
and that should they be sold, there would be at the Agency 
almost no competition, that great frauds may be practised, 
unless the orders under which sales may be made should be 
very particular. . . . ~r~

'L<> Jam <'* Monroe* 

War Dept 14th Oct r 1821 

DEAR SIR, 1 have received your several communications 
of the 5th 10th and llth Insts, and will loose no time in carry 
your instructions into effect. ... 

I enclose for your instructions a letter from Col Brooke 
and one from Gen 1 . Brown 2 to the Adjut. Gen 1 , in relation to 
it. You will perceive, on the perusal, that the subject involves 
the extent of the military powers of the Governor of Florida, 
and is one of some delicacy. Gen 1 Brown seems not to be 
aware of the extent of the power vested in the Gov 1 '. and of 
course decides the point submitted to him without any hesita- 
tion. I also enclose a letter from Cap*. Deloba in relation to 
his rank and pay with a report of the Adj*. Gen 1 , on his 
application. I do not think that his request can be granted 
on either point. As to his claim of Brev*. pay it appears to 
me quite clear, that it cannot be granted under existing laws 
and regulations. If the point, which he makes as to rank, 
had not been settled under the former reduction, 1 should be 
sti'ongly inclined to think his claim well founded; but it 
appears to me, to establish a rule, at this time, different from 
the one formerly adopted, would have such extensive effects 
in changing the relative rank of officers long since established 
and acquiesced in by them, as to render it wholly unadvisable. 
I am much disposed to take the same view of the occur- 
rences in Florida 3 with that which you have presented, tho' 1 
have by no means bestowed on them that minute attention, 
which is necessary to a satisfactory decision. The occurrence 
to which M r Jefferson refers may be of great importance in 
the light of a precedent, and I will not fail to look into it, 
without connecting it with the name of M r . Jefferson.* I am 
not inclined to think that an ultimate decision on the occur- 
rences ought to be postponed longer than is necessary to 
obtain correct information. I have always found that much 
is gained by the executive coming to a definite conclusion at 
an early period, on all important subjects, on which it has

ultimately to decide. It has great power to direct the judge- 
ment of the publick by a correct statement of facts, and a 
presentation of strong and just views. But whether it may 
be thought advisable to leave the publick, for the present, to 
investigate and come to a conclusion by the lights, which are 
already, or may be brought out on these occurrences, yet 
there is one view of the subject, which would seem to me to 
call, at least for an early decision. That conflict of power, 
which has already taken place must continue till the executive 
power determines the limits which belongs to each the Gov 1 . 
and the judges, and should any unpleasant event hereafter 
occur in consequence of it, the responsibility would attach 
immediately to the government, if the point in controvers} T 
should be left undecided. I make these suggestions with 
great deference, as you appear to be disposed to take a 
different view. 

I must call 3^0111 attention to the appointment of an Inspec- 
tor General and the extra compensation, which has been 
allowed to the officers detailed to perform duties in the sev- 
eral Depts, at the Seat of Government. An early decision is 
not of so niuch consequence in the latter, but it is desirable, 
that the Inspection should be made at an early period in the 
Southern Department of the Army. In addition to what, I 
observed formerly on the selection to be made, it is proper to 
state that Col Butler and his friends are dissatisfied with the 
place assigned him in the late arrangement of the Army, tho' 
I think without just cause and that he has intimated to Col 
Gadsden his intention to resign. I believe his case is the 
only cause of discontent remaining in that Dcpt of the Army, 
the transfer of Col Linsay to the Artillery, which prevented 
Taylor and Woolley from being razeed, and Cobb from being 
discharged has removed all of the others of which Gen 1 . 
Jackson complains. Whether the appointment of Col Butler 
to the place of Insp 1 '. General would satisfy him and his 
friends, and whether if such would be the effect, it would, 
under all of the circumstances of the case be advisable to 
appoint him, may be worthy of some consideration. 1 

It was impossible to make a reduction without exciting 
some discontent, at the selections, but I believe, in the main. 



1 Samuel B. Archer was appointed inspector-general Nov. 10, 1821. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 201 

that no arrangement could have been made, which would have 
caused less; and of that which has been excited very little 
has been from just views of the subject. 1 

I shall exercise every possible economy, feeling that it is of 
the highest importance, that there should be no loan at the 
next session. I have no special information as to the present 
prospect of the Treasury, as M r Crawford's sickness has 
prevented me from making enquiries about it, yet, I should 
think from a general view, that putting the publick land 
pretty much out of the estimate, that the income from the 
impost alone ought to equal, or nearly so to the present dis- 
bursements. The appearance in the early part of the year 
is necessarily more discouraging than in the latter, as the 
disbursements are then much more considerable. I should 
suppose at least | of the whole disbursements of this Dept 
for the year is already made. But whatever may be the 
prospect for next year, it appears to me it ought to be early 
ascertained, as the estimates, whenever they can, ought to be 
regulated by the state of the Treasury. 

I enclose the Southern Patriot, which I have received since 
w riting what relates to the occurrences in Florida. It appears 
to me that the statement which it contains confirms the opinion 
that there is some hazard in delaying a final decision.

DEAR JOHN, I have no other apology to offer for my tardy 
correspondence, than the want of time. The winter has been

in a great measure passed by. 

You have not informed us of your marriage, but we have 
1 '\irned by letters from Charleston that the event has taken 
place. I congratulate you most sincerely on the occasion. 1 
hope that your Union may be long and happy. Every one

As soon as Congress will give us leave it will afford me great 
pleasure to make my congratulations in person. 

I must refer you to the Intel r . for the passing occurences 
here. The Presidential election continues to be much spoken 
of, but does not yet produce much political excitement. My 
friends think my political prospect good, in fact better than 
any other who is spoken of. There is no doubt of Pennsyl- 
vania, which must go far to decide the contest. I do not 
think that M r L 1 is much spoken of. He has few opponents 
but still fewer ardent friends. My own opinion is that the 
contest will be between Adams, Crawford and myself. 

We are all well except your sister. She has been quite 
indisposed, but is now better. She and your- mother join 
their affectionate regard to you and Mrs Calhoun.

Washington 14 th May 1822 

DEAR JOHN, You will call us very fickle when I inform you 
that we have declined our journey to the South. On the 
adjournment of Congress, I found so much business on hand 
that, on calculation, I could not complete it and get off before 
the Midle of June, which we consider too late to make so long 
a journey with our family. It is a source of deep regret to 
us, as we anticipated much pleasure in seeing you all. But I 
must surrender my considerations to the duties of my office. 
The sacrifice is great but it must be made, particularly as my 
friends the radicals have selected me as the object of their 
peculiar favour, as you no doubt have seen by the papers. I 
must be prepared for them. They have gained nothing yet 
but defeat, and 1 am determined that they shall gather no other 
harvest. You see how easily I slide into politicks, but I will 
resist the tendency, as you will through M c Duffie learn all 
that is interesting here. I will only add that I hope that you 
will send us Davis from Pendleton at your next election and 
some sound good member in the place of Judge Smith for the 
Senate. Wilson appears to be an honest good man but we 
require something more at present, and Smith, I fear, is

united with the faction in Congress. 1 This, however is for 
yourself only, and must go no farther. 

Your Mother says she intends to go South this summer, but 
it is very uncertain as she has not fixed the time. She wishes 
you, however, to have clergy hall put in order for her 
reception. 

We have been projecting an arrangement for you and M rs 
Calhoun next Winter, to which we hope you will make no 
objections. It is for you to make a visit to Washington after 
the adjournment of the Legislature and spend the Winter 
with us. If you will do so, we will certainly return it by 
spending the ensuing Summer with you in Pendleton. We 
are so intent on this arrangement, that we will not let you off 
on a slight excuse; and altogether interdict before hand yonv 
old one, "that you have no time." 

Your mother and the family join their love to you and M rs 
C. We are all well.

MY DEAR SIR: The mail of this morning has spread joy over 
the city. Our friend M c Duffie is not only alive but believed 
to be safe. He so considers himself in a letter written four 
hours after the affair. The ball entered the small of the back 
obliquely. I trust so valuable a life is spared to the country. 
Never did my feelings undergo so great a change in [so] short 
a time.

lina, I, 108-120. Hayne was at this time elected in his place. 

2 Text derived from a copy kindly furnished by Mr. Adrian H. Joline, of New York, the 
possessor of the original. The reference is to a duel with Colonel Gumming, which 
inflicted upon McDuffie a wound, the effects of which showed themselves in a peculiar 
irritability during all the rest of his life. George McDuffie (1788-1851), one of the most 
eminent of all Carolinian statesmen, was at this time a member of the House of Repre- 
sentatives, in which he served from 1821 to 1834. He was governor of South Carolina

Washington 1 st July 1822 

DEAR JOHN, I have received Your favour of the 17 th Juno 
and am very happy to hear that You have so flattering a pros- 
pect as to youv corn and cotton crop. The information from 
every part of the South concur in representing the prospect 
of those two leading articles to be very promising, so that, 
if the price is low, there is at least ground to hope, that the 
product will be abundant. I am sorry to see, that you are so 
deeply disgusted with political life. It is the duty of those, 
who have the means and capacity, to serve the country; and 
we ought to resist that tendency to disgust which is so apt to 
be excited \)y the many proofs, which we daily see of the want 
of Candor and integrity. You would be wrong to decline at 
present. The next legislature will be very important. It will 
take all the good sense and moderation, which can be brought 
forward, to prevent the state from being distracted. Under 
these circumstances, I hope, }^ou will not hesitate to continue 
in public life. I am glad to see a disposition to leave Smith 
at home. I do not think that he fairly represents the state. 
He is narrow minded and I believe wedded to the Georgia 
politicians. If reelected I doubt not that he will come out 
openly, which would do much mischief. Hay no is the man 
that ought to be elected. He has talents and eloquence and 
will honour the state. It would be imprudent however to 
utter these sentiments as coming from me. 

You do not mention whom you intend to send to Congress. 
I hope it will be Davis. Wilson is a good honest man, but 
certainly very little calculated for the post which he occupies. 
I send you the prospectus of a new paper to be edited here. 1 
It will be conducted with Zeal and abilities, and I hope will be 
well supported. We have need of such a paper, You must sub- 
scribe for it, and get as many others as you can conveniently. 
By putting it into the hand of Joseph Gresham, or some other 
active person at the court house, I dare say many subscribers 
might be obtained. Should any be obtained care must be 
taken to have the list returned.

anticipated happiness that such an event is calculated to 
inspire. To be placed in the situation of father is among the 
greatest changes which we experience through life, and tho' 
it has its anxieties, it is not without its prepondrance of 
happiness. 1 find my children the great solace of life, and

there is still that which makes you feel how much more happy 
you are with them and how disconsolate you would be without

DEAR JOHN, I have been disappointed in my prospected 
journey South. I intended to set out shortly after the ad- 
journment of Congress, but the indisposition of your sister, 
and the mass of unfinished business, which the session of Con 
gress left has prevented me till it is now too late. Floride 
will be confined some time in May and were I now to set out, 
I could not return in time; and it will after that event be too 
late in the season to go South. It is to me a sore disappoint- 
ment, as both my business and inclination tend strongly to 
take me south.

Your Mother has no objection to M r Huger occupying her 
house. He would be an acquisition to your neighbourhood, 
which with so many agreeable additions must be very pleas- 
ant. She desires to Know, whether You have sent her cotton 
to market, and how much she has made. The stock on hand 
in Europe is much diminished, tho the price has advanced but 
little. As to the mistake in the land in the Sale of a portion 
of our land, you must exercise your discretion, as to what 
ought to be done. 

I would be glad, if in your next you would state how our 
accounts stand, and how much I may expect from the proceeds 
of our land. My expense is very heavy; and I would be glad 
to sell my portion of the tract, which you plant in Barnwell. 
Will you look out for a purchaser for me; and state what you 
suppose 1 might sell at. 

War seems inevitable in Europe. As to our domestick 
politicks, the Radicals 1 are much broken; and I think their 
Chief is also much depressed. It is hard to say who will be 
the successful candidate. Each one has his advantages and 
drawbacks. My friends are Zealous and active, and think 
that, as there is no other objection to me but age, that my 
chance will finally be the best. 

We are all well. The children are very hearty and grow 
fast. You do not say what you call your son. I do not doubt 
but he is a fine boy. Your Mother, Floride and James desire 
their love to you and M Calhoun.

DEAR JOHN, On the 19 th Ins*, we had the addition of a fine 
boy to our family. I would have informed you earlier of so 
agreeable an event, but was indisposed at the time with a 
slight fever, of which however, I am now entirely recovered. 
Floride and the Boy are doing well. We have not yet fully 
determined on the name. There appears to be a disposition 
to call him John, but whether with a middle name, or what, 
is yet a matter for deliberation. You have not yet stated the

name of your son*, and as it may have some influence in deter- 
mining ours, I would be glad, that you would inform us. 

Tho' we were very anxious to visit Carolina this season, we 
cannot but feel compensated in the occurrence, which has pre- 
vented us. As it has turned out, we should have had time 
enough, but your sister was apprehensive, that it might be 
several weeks earlier. 

James has left us to join Maj r . Long in his exploring tour, 
to the head waters of the S fc Peters, thence to the 49 th degree 
and along it to the lake of the Woods and thence home by 
lake superior. 1 The old U. States Bank will make another 
dividend by the 10 th June next, of about 9 per. cent. If there 
is any ballance in my favour in your hands, or if you can make 
it convenient to let me receive your share, and you to retain 
out of the proceeds of our land an equal amount, I would be 
glad of it, as the low price of cotton has run my finances to a 
low ebb. 1 believe the share stands in your name, if so an 
order, or one from the person in whose name it stands, will, I 
presume, be sufficient. 

Your mother and the children are well. Andrew is a stout, 
hearty boy, Anna Maria is slender and sprightly, and Patrick 
is very hansoine with a fair complexion and light blue eyes. 
I feel it quite a misfortune, that we cannot bring them up in 
Carolina among their relations. I, for my part, love the tie 
of relationship, and believe that those who are under its influ- 
ence are usually much more disposed to a virtuous life. 

Your Sister, Mother, and the Children all desire their love 
to you, and M rs Calhoun.

entirely satisfactory. From the time, that I commenced the 
administration of this Department, I have been deeply im- 
pressed, with the importance of encouraging the settlement 
of the Michigan Territory, and have never failed to embrace 
all of the means within my reach to effect so important an 
object. In fact, I am of the opinion that a dense settlement 
within the Peninsula would, of itself, forever secure the peace 
of the North Western frontier. With these views I would 
deeply regret that any arrangement of the Department should 
have the slightest tendency to counteract what has been the 
stead v object of its pursuit; but the truth is, that our military 
establishment is so small compared to the extent of the frontier, 
that I am often compelled to choose between two evils; and to 
select that arrangement which is not absolutely good of itself, 
but which has the fewest objections. Since the reduction of the 
army, the Artillery has been distributed in such small masses, 
that it has been ascertained from experience to be impossible to 
improve the discipline of that important arm without maki no- 
some essential change. None occurred that promised such 
favorable results, as a school of practice, and it has been 
accordingly finally determined to commence such a school in 
the Autumn at Fort Monroe, which, it is ascertained will be 
sufficiently advanced for the purpose. To give to the school 
all of the advantage of which it is susceptable, it was desira- 
ble to collect at that place, if possible, a regiment of artillery. 
I have found much difficulty in effecting this object, and was 
compelled to withdraw the artillery from the Upper Lakes for 
the purpose. A new distribution of the Infantry became 
necessary in that quarter, which caused the order, the effect 
of which has 1 regret caused some dissatisfaction in the Ter- 
ritory. In making the new distribution, the Department 
availed itself of the military knowledge of the Major General, 
and his minute information of the locality of the frontier, and 
adopted the distribution which he recommended. Should 
however experience prove that the arrangement is defective, 
or that n better can be substituted, such alterations as it may 
indicate will be made. Tho' Chicago may be important in 
War, I cannot consider it, in a general view, as connected 
with the peace arrangement, near as important as Green Bay, 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 209 

which constitutes an essential link in the general exterior line 
of military posts, which is so well calculated to break the 
force of foreign influence and to rivit our own. Nor do I 
consider it, as connected in any essential degree, with the 
extension of settlement in that quarter, as our population 
must approach that point by the gradually increasing of the 
settlements on the frontier of Illinois and Indiana. Should 
it hereafter become important as the means of sustaining a 
line of intercourse with the Illinois River, it would be readily 
reinstated. 

The post at Mackinaw would be evacuated in favour of 
Detroit, but it is thought advisable to preserve the fortifica- 
tion there for the present. I am aware of the importance of 
the latter position, but it would be in vain to ask for an 
appropriation for its defense, as there are so many pressing 
demands at other points, which are for the present deemed 
more essential. In the mean time, I trust the growth of the 
Territory and the general extension of our population and 
Wealth to the frontier, will render fortifications far more neces- 
sury to our neighbors than ourselves. Our means of com- 
manding Lake Erie, and all of the Upper Lakes will be far 
superior to his, which will tend to render us much more 
powerful in that quarter than Great Britain.

ing on the great question between modern improvement in gov-

and agitates the civilized world. In that question I take the 
deepest interest, and as I am under the strongest conviction 
that the force of our example will go far to decide the strug- 
gle, it has doubled my solicitude that it should be such as 
should be worthy of the great cause. 

I seize the opportunity to express the pleasure which I feel

Washington, 20 th July 1823 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have received your letters of the 17 th June 
and 2 (l July, and am glad to find you in spirits. The prospect 
is certainly bright. The Radical party with its chief is cer- 
tainly steadily declining. The 4 th July gave no comfort to 
them. It is certain that the Republican side will prevail, but 
under whom is more doubtful. It must in a great measure 
depend on New York. Should she declare for me, the elec- 
tion would be certain without going to the House of Repre- 
sentatives. The vote of your State must in no small degree 
depend on those who have acted with the Clinton and Federal 
parties. How will they act on the Presidential question ? For 
whom they will declare? Does not Mr. Clinton's friends still 
think of bringing him forward? You say nothing of the 
vacant place on the Bench. Who ought to fill it? Spencer, 
Kent, VanNcss, Wheaton, Edwards and Sanford are named. 2 
What would be the effect of making the selection of either of 
those gentlemen ? The subject is an important one in my [ ? any] 
point of view. I consider the office as the highest, excepting 
the Chief Magistrate, under our system. I saw Maxcy 3 a few

to engage the influence of Genl. Harper. Count de Menou l

and truly to the people.

Washington 7 th Aug' 1828 

DEAR JAMES, Your letter from Chicago was the more 
agreeable, as it was unexpected. Knowing your negligent 
habit as a correspondent, we were fearful, that we should not 
hear from you till your return. With encouragement it is 
usual to rise in expectation; and we shall be quite disapointed, 
if we should not receive a letter from the Falls of S* Antony. 
I fear the course of events in Spain will not be such as to 
realize your expectation. She is not yet subdued, but her 
resistance has been little worthy of her cause. Yet there is 
still hope, tho the defection of Count Abisbal and the counter 
revolution in Portugal are very discouraging events. The 
truth is, that she has a most difficult task to perform; not so 
much in resisting French bayonets, as the corruption, intrigue, 
and the moral discouragement which she experiences from all 
of the European powers not excepting England. The British 
people are hearty in her cause, but the government, there is 
much reason to apprehend, has acted a very mischievous part 
both in Spain and Portugal. The hope of Spain is now in 
Cadiz. The government had arrived there by the last advice, 
and was received with zeal; but the place was crowded with 
population, and Blockaded by a French squadron. 

We are on the hights of Georgetown, and find the residence 
delightful. The health of the children is very much improved 
by the fine air and the abundant exercise in the Grove.

The season has been delightful both here and to the South. 
By the last accounts crops were never so fine in Carolina, and 
what is better the price of cotton has improved very consid- 
erably with fair prospect of still farther advance, and that 
not from the diminution of the supply, but from the increase 
of the consumption which has been enormous. 

I will write you in ten days, or two weeks and address to 
Detroit, and will agreeably to your request give you a letter 
of credit for $200, on Governor Cass. l 

We hope that your tour will be throughout safe and inter- 
esting. Your mother, sister, and the children all desire their 
love to you.

Washington 7 th August 1823. 

DEAK SIR, An unusual pressure of official duties has pre- 
vented me from answering at an earlier period your letter of 
the 7 th of last month. 

I would be much gratified to contribute to the object which 
you have in view, but the most of the improvements which 
we have made in relation to war are connected with the fab- 
rication and miprovement of arms. They consist however 
either of a series of improvements in which not any one is 
very striking, or of inventions which are not yet known to 
the publick, and which, it is desirable, should not be com- 
municated. 

Our military organization, and system of instruction, tho' 
not the same as either the French, or English, yet are based 
substantially on the same principles. What we have done 
is to modify and apply them to the circumstances in which 
we are placed.

you, and addressed my letter to the S. De S* Marie. I hope 
you have received it. Since then nothing has occurred worth 
relating. We have no late news from Spain. Our last was 
very unfavourable. Her resistance has not been equal to her 
ancient renown, nor her noble cause. I do not doubt but that 
she abounds with enlightened and patriotick citizens, and that 
a majority who guide her council are of that discription; but 
they have had to contend with a treacherous King corrupt 
Nobility, and slavish clergy, as well as French bayonets and 
gold. The good cause will not, I fear, triumph at this time, 
but its final success is certain. It may be reserved for us to 
give it the ultimate triumph which awaits it. 

We are all well. The children have improved very much 
by our residence on the heights of Georgetown. The last 
accounts from the South state the crops to be excellent. Cot- 
ton continues to rise, with a fair prospect of going to 18 or 20 
cents per Ib. 

I hope you have had a pleasant and instructive tour. Your 
mother, sister and the children desire their love to you.

Washington 28 th Sepr 1823 

DEAR SIR, We were much gratified to learn by your letter 
of the 25 th August that you were all well and that the pros- 
pect was so good as to the crop. 

By the last arrival cotton was a little depressed, but I have 
no doubt, that it was merely temporary. The consumption is 
enormous; not less in Great Britain alone than 500,000 bales, 
and is on the increase; and 1 cannot doubt but that it will 
nwintain a respectable price throughout next year. 

Your mother speaks of returning this Autumn, tho 1 think 
it very doubtful whether she will, or not. Her movements 
are very uncertain, and tho' she feels that her duty and inter- 
est require her return, yet I am inclined to think she will not 
visit the South this season. You must do the best you can 
for her. My expense is very great, and I begin to feel a sensible 
pressure. 1 trust that you will be able to make a remittance 
from our Saltcatcher debtors. A few hundred dollars would

be acceptable. My situation exposes me almost incessantly 
to company, which greatly increases my expenses. 

M r . Blacklidge of Washington North Carolina, formerly a 
Lieutenant under you, requested me by letter to give him 
your address, as he was desirous of writing to you, but he did 
not state on what subject. I think it not improbable, how- 
ever, that it is political, as the Presidential question excites 
much interest in that quarter. His family is powerful and 1 
would be glad to know his sentiments. M}^ friends think the 

prospect very fair. It is confidently believed that M r C d l 

cannot take a vote to the North or West of this place. 

We shall be absent next week on a visit to Baltimore. My 
chief Clerk 2 is about to take a wife there, and would not let 
us off from the Wedding. W T e are all well; tho this district is 
sickly. We have been residing on the heights of Georgetown, 
which is certainly very healthy and pleasant. I have suc- 
ceeded in renting James place at $600, which gives legal inter- 
est. We have not heard from him for a long time, but his 
return may now be expected in a few weeks. 

Your Sister and Mother desire their love to you and M rs C.

DEAR SIR, i enclose the proceedings of the Court Martial

case appears to be a plain one, and he is generally considered 
as a very unworthy member of the Military Establishment. 
I also enclose the treaty with the Florida Indians, with the 
journal of the Commissioners and the letters of Gov r . Duval 
and Col Gadsden. 4 The object of transmitting the papers at 
present is to obtain your decision on the proposition of the

assigned. It certainly seems desirable on every account, that 
another year should not pass away, without concentrating the 
Indians on the place proposed for their permanent home; 
and it is believed, that unless the lines should be made with- 
out delay, it will be impossible to effect this desirable object. 
There is another reason for acceding to the request of the 
Gov r . So little is known of the country which has been fixed 
on for the Indians, that the Commissioners have been com- 
pelled to leave the northern limits of the tract, subject to be 
altered hereafter; if it should appear, that there is not a suffi- 
ciency of good land, in that which has been reserved. It 
seems to me desirable, that the line should be definitely fixed 
before the treaty is ratified by the Senate, which may be done 
by running the line, and giving our Commissioners discre- 
tionary powers for that purpose. The general information, 
which will be acquired of the tract by running the line will 
no doubt be satisfactory to the Senate, when it comes to act 
on the Treaty. For these reasons, and as the expense will bo 
small, it seems to me, that it would be proper to accede to the 
request of the Governor. I have no doubt, but that Col 
Gadsden and Lieut Ripley are well qualified for the duty of 
running the line. 

I received your letter enclosing one from Gov r . Robertson 
on the subject of removing the troops from Baton Rouge. I 
can find no trace of the regulation of the Legislature of 
Louisiana to which the Governor refers; nor have I any recol- 
lection of ever having seen it. It will be difficult to reply to 
the Gov 1 '. without having a copy of the resolution, and as it 
may be among your papers, I have delayed answering his 
letter, till you can make a search for it. 

I regret to hear that M rs Monroe is indisposed. I would 
have written some days since, but expected you in the city, 
from what M r Hay stated, till this morning. 

We have nothing new.

MY DEAR SIR We were deeply afflicted with your loss. It 
is the most trying of all dispensations. 

I read your communication and gave it the direction which 
you requested. It is excellent; very full and accurate, and 
will well bear publication. Col. Tilghman writes to me occa- 
sionally, but I have not leisure to reply as fully as it is desired. 
Your communication to him will remove the necessitv of a 
detail of facts in my answer to him. The Carolina legislature 
has moved. Its movement was wholly spontaneous, and con- 
trary to the advice of our friends here. It is, however, as 
well. The whole body consists of 169, of which about 155 
attended, it being all who were present, and well. The nomi- 
nation was unanimous with the exception of 4 or 5. 

If I can, I wish to get along without the money accommoda- 
tions, but 1 wish you to make the arrangement in (rase I should 
wish it, and let me know, whether it can be done. 

The movement at Annapolis to which you refer, had better 
be delayed untill it can be certainly made. Certainty is more 
important than promptitude. The Radicals are checked here, 
and disconsolate. I do not doubt that they will rally under 
some other chief in less than 5 months. I have much to say 
but have not time.

such deep afflictions. There is no doubt but that a change 
of scene would tend to alleviate the distress of M rs Calhoun, 
and I hope that you will be able to carry your intention of 
paying us a visit into effect. We all would be much gratified 
to see you. Our seperation has been long. 1 do hope that it 
may be in my power to make a visit with my family to Caro- 
lina next summer. Col Pickens has just left us for the South, 
taking Charleston in his route. You will probably see him, 
and will learn from him every thing in relation to Washington, 
which will render it unnecessary for me to give details. 

The statement, as to a coalition between Adams and myself 
is "one of the devices of the enemy". It is a report wholly 
destitute of fact to support it; and is not believed by those 
who circulate it. I stand wholly on my own basis, and shall 
continue so to stand. The prospect is good. The election 
will be left as it ought to be to the people. They alone have 
the right. Our friends oppose a caucus not through a fear of 
Weakness in Congress, but through principle. A Congres- 
sional caucus will certainly fail.

pation of that River in a military point of view, the ease with 
which troops may be marched to that point, and the impor- 
tance in checking foreign encroachments, and controlling the 
Indians within our Territory," I have the honor to state that

For the facility with which troops may be marched to the 
point contemplated to be occupied, I would refer the Commit- 
tee to the report of the Quarter Master General which accom- 
panied my letter to the President of the United States of the 
17th of February last. There is no doubt but that the occu- 
pation of the mouth of the Origon would give the Government 
more complete controul over the Indians within our territory, 
West of the Rocky Mountains, and tend to check the encroach- 
ments of foreign traders in that quarter; but it is believed that 
so long as the traders of the British Fur Company have free 
access to the region of the Rocky Mountains from the various 
posts, which they hold upon our Northern Boundaries, they 
will in a great measure monopolize the Fur trade West of the 
Mississippi, to the almost entire exclusion in a few years of 
our trade. 



To Henry A. 8. Dearborn. 1 

Washington 8th June, 1824. 

DEAR SIR, I have been so much occupied, that I have not 
had leisure to acknowledge your favor of the 7th May and 
one of a proceeding date, enclosing the Boston Patriot con- 
taining the very interesting reflections on European Politicks. 
The letters exhibit very considerable powers of observations 
and warm American feelings, which entitle their author to 
favourable consideration. 

No political combination that ever existed required to be 
so vigilantly watched as the Holy Alliance. In power and 
solidity it exceeds all other combinations against human hap- 
piness and freedom, which were ever formed. That the Alli- 
ance regards our government with jealousy and hatred cannot 
be doubted. So long as we are safe and flourishing, that des- 
potism, which it is their object to support is in danger. 

Thus situated we cannot exercise too much wisdom, vigour 
and prudence. It is this view of our situation, which has led 
me to regard with such pointed disapprobation, the course of

those politicians, who have struggled with so much industry 
to bring into disrepute all our means of preparation and to 
overthrow an administration because it would not yield to 
their scheme of demolition. Our country ought to omit no 
measure necessary to guard our liberty and independence

To Rolwt S. 

Washington, D. C., July 3, 1824. 

MY DEAR SIR: In asking my opinion of the Constitution, I 
understand you to refer to that portion of the instrument 
which relates to state rights, and in complying with } T our 
request I will accordingly limit my observations to that point 
of view. 

If there is one portion of the Constitution which 1 most 
admire, it is the distribution of powjer between the States and 
general Government. It is the only portion that is novel and 
peculiar. The rest has been more or less compiled. This is 
our invention and is altogether our own, and I consider it to 
be the greatest improvement which has been made in the 
science of government, after the division of power into the 
legislative, executive and judicial. Without it, free states in 
the present condition of the world could not exist, or must 
have existed without safety or responsibility. If limited to a 
small territory, they must be crushed by the great monarchial 
powers or exist only at their discretion; but if extended over 
a great surface, the concentration of power and patronage 
necessary for government would speedily end in terror. It 
is only by this admirable distribution that a great extent of 
territory, with a proportional population and power, can be 
reconciled with freedom, and consequently that safety and

220 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

respectability be given to free States. As much then as I 
value freedom, in the same degree do 1 value State rights. 
But it is not only in the abstract that I admire the distribution 
of power between the general Government and the States. I 
approve of the actual distribution of the two powers which is 
made by our Constitution. Were it in my power, I would 
make no change. 

These remarks bring me to the question which J suppose 
you had more immediately in view. I mean that of the con- 
struction of the Constitution, or, in other words, how ought 
the line which separates the powers of the general and State 
Governments to be drawn where it is not distinctly delineated 
by the instrument itself. I can give but one solution to this 
interesting question, and that is, it ought to be drawn in the 
spirit of the instrument itself. I know that there has been 
an anxious desire on the part of our best patriots to devise 
some one general and artificial rule of construction to be 
applied to any portion of the Constitution, but I cannot per- 
suade myself that it is practicable, and believe that all such 
attempts must end in weakening rather than strengthening 
the rights of the States. It has been said, for instance, that 
the construction ought to be invariably rigid against the power 
of the general Government. The rule allows no discretion, 
but must be applied with equal severity to any portion of the 
Constitution, to that which delegates power acknowledged 
by all to be essential to the safety of the nation, and to that 
which provides checks against the abuse of such power. I 
feel confident that such an application of the rule (and without 
it, it is nothing) must lead into perpetual difficulty and con- 
tradiction, which must finally bring into discredit those who 
act on it, and thereby weaken their authority when it may be 
most required. Believing that no general and artificial rule 
can be devised that will not act mischievously in its applica- 
tion, I am forced to the result that any doubtful portion of 
the Constitution must be construed by itself in reference to 
the true meaning and intent of the f ramers of the instrument; 
and consequently that the construction must, in each part, be 
more or less rigid, as may be necessary to effect the intention. 

Such being my general principles, it only remains, in com- 
plying with your request, to apply them to what I have said 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 221 

or done since I have been in public life in order to test their 
practical application, and I think it may be said with conlidence 
that I have never uttered a sentence in any speech, report, 
or word in conversation that could give offence to the most 
ardent defender of State rights. On this point my character 
has been grossly misrepresented to the people of Virginia. 
Feeling the profoundest respect for the States, and believing 
their honor nofe to be greater than it ought to be, I have at 
least never spoken disrespectfully of them, or endeavored to 
establish principles that would weaken them; and for the truth 
of the assertion I appeal with confidence to my opinions as 
recorded, both in my speeches and reports. I have gone 
through a short, but active political life, and in trying times, 
and if hostile to the rights of the States, some evidence must 
be found of it in one or the other. If, then, I have given 
offence, it must be by my acts, and by them I am willing to 
be tried, and, if I mistake not, I have never done an act which, 
if condemned in me, M r . Jefferson, M r . Madison, and Mr. 
Monroe must not be equally condemned. There are none 
of mine which are not covered by the example of deliberate 
acts of these enlightened statesmen. For example, I am ac- 
cused of advocating the power of Congress to incorporate a 
National Bank; but those who make the accusation, and who 
profess to admire M r . Madison and M r . Jefferson, seem to 
forget that I had the weight of their authority with me. The 
former approved the bill which I contributed to pass, and the 
latter approved of one which extended a branch of the old 
United States Bank to New Orleans. Must I then be judged 
more rigidly than these old Republican veterans, and they 
be excused for what I am condemned 1 Is this the justice 
of the ancient dominion? 

Nor is there anything in the principle on which I advocated 
the passage of the bank bill calculated to give offence. I said 
nothing on the Constitution. I left each member to make up 
his own opinion on that point. I felt satisfied that the power 
existed, but at the same time respected those who took the 
opposite view, for 1 have always considered the power the 
least clear of those which have been exercised by Congress. 
I rested the argument for its passage on the necessity of 
restoring specie payments, at the time the legal currency of 



222 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

the United States had ceased to circulate, and to regulate, or 
to fix the value of that which did circulate. In fact, we had 
no currency but notes of some specie paying banks incorpo- 
rated by the States, and wholly under their authority. Con- 
gross had wholly lost its constitutional power over that subject. 
However brought about, a state of things existed wholly 
incompatible with the provisions of the Constitution. To 
give to Congress virtually the power delegated to it by that 
instrument of fixing and regulating the value of the currency 
of the nation was the great object which I had in view in aid- 
ing the passage of the bill incorporating the United States 
Bank, and there certainly is much satisfaction in the reflection 
that this clearly constitutional object has been fully realized. 
If the measure can ever be justified, it was justifiable in the 
then existing circumstances. 

It is again objected to me that" I am a friend to the system 
of internal improvements, and that I assert a power in Con- 
gress to make roads and canals. Here I may again cover my- 
self by the same authority. M r . Jefferson, M r . Madison, and 
M r . Monroe have again and again approved of bills making 
appropriations for internal improvements; nor have I, in any 
instance, gone beyond their example, though it is true that 
Mr. Madison rejected the bill which I contributed to pass, 
and which set aside the bonds of the United States Bank as a 
fund for internal improvements. It ought, however, to be 
remembered the bill was not presented till the last moment of 
the session, when, as you know, . . . in the multitude of bills 
presented for consideration, but little time is left for the 
reflection of the President. I am satisfied that it is owing to 
that cause that his argument on that occasion partakes so little 
of his usual accuracy. In fact, his leading objection that the 
consent of the States could give no constitutional power, was 
misapplied. The truth is that the bill did not even make an 
appropriation of money. It simply set aside a certain fund 
for the purpose of improvements; that is, it provided that it 
should be appropriated to no other purpose, thus leaving it to 
be hereafter determined in what manner it should be appro- 
priated and applied, whether with or without an amendment 
of the Constitution, providing only that it should not be 
applied but by the consent of the States to be affected. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 223 

1 think it cannot be doubted that if the power existed in 
Congress to appropriate money for internal improvement for 
which we have the sanction of the three distinguished citizens 
to whom I have referred, there was nothing in the bill to 
make it unconsitutional. But I am really at a loss to know 
why this objection should be made against me. What dis- 
tinguished public man is there now on the stage to whom the 
same may not be made. And most of them are men much 
more deeply committed than myself. I have never yet com- 
mitted myself beyond the mere right of making an appropri- 
ation. I have nowhere in my public capacity asserted the 
right of applying money so appropriated without the consent 
of the States, or individuals to be affected. I am perfectly 
open to the examination of that question should I ever be 
called on to act. It is, however, due to candor to say that 
my impression is that the power does exist to a certain extent, 
but as 1 have always believed that it should not be exercised 
without a clear necessity, and as I do believe that the mere 
right of applying our money, not as a sovereign without the 
consent of those to be affected, but as a mere proprietor with 
their assent, will be found sufficient in practice, I have care- 
fully abstained from coming to any final conclusion until it 
becomes absolutely necessary. 

I hope what I have written is sufficiently explicit. It is 
intended to be perfectly so, but if you should find it not so, I 
will at all times cheerfully give any additional explanation 
which you may require.

DEAR SIR, I have determined not to till the place of military

with Mr. Carlton's request. 

I am glad to learn that all is so safe in Charleston. I see 
however, that the enemy is not inactive and without care you

may yet have some trouble. Craft's movement, as far as Mr. 
Adams is concerned, is very impolitick and I have suggested 
the idea to a friend of his here, who will make it known to 
him. 

I am glad of your determination to remain for some time in 
Charleston, where, I am certain, that your presence will be at 
least useful. You have seen Governor Edwards resignation. 1 
The place is not yet filled. Would you accept of it? If you 
would, the President will confer it on you. I am aware that 
considerations at this time give a peculiar interest to your de- 
cision; and it is on that account the President wishes to give 
you an opportunity for a deliberate decision before he acts. 
It is not impossible that the Presidential vote may turn on 
that of South Carolina, and that again on you or your succes- 
sor, should you accept the Mission. This state of things re- 
quires much consideration on your part. Should you accept, 
who would fill your place? If General Geddes or any of his 
party should succeed, there is no knowing what would follow, 
or rather, is it not too certain that the party would carry 
General T (?) and by so doing command the vote of the State 
should it come to the House. Nothing could be more fatal 
both to the State and Nation. These are mere suggestions on 
points on which you must be well informed, much better so 
than myself. 

What I have written is in the strictest confidence but does 
not preclude the liberty of consulting Hayne or Hamilton or 
should it be thought advisable, McDuffie. I would be happy 
if you would acknowledge the receipt of this letter so soon 
as received and not delay your final answer longer than may 
be necessary for a deliberate decision. 

I feel satisfied that great efforts are now making in New 

York to unite Clay's and C d's 2 interest on the former, 

and not without some considerable prospect of success. My 

impression is still unchanged, that Mr. C d's final recovery 

is very uncertain, and that the uncertainty will continue so 
long, that some one else must be rallied on by his friends. 
He has not been at his office since the adjournment.

Washington 11 th Sepr. 1824. 

DEAR SIR, I returned from my excursion to the mountains 
on Wednesday last, and had the satisfaction to find that the 
business of the Department had been conducted in a very sat- 
isfactory manner in my absence. 

I was much gratified with my visit to the summit of the 
Allegaheny. It is a region of singular formation, and the 
prospect is fair, that there will be an ample supply of water 
for the great national work in contemplation. I find much 
solicitude on the subject through every portion of the country 
which I passed; and since my return I have received the en- 
closed note, in relation to it, from Gen 1 . Mercer, which I trans- 
mit to you, in order to have the aid of your advice. On full 
reflection, I rather doubt the propriety of making the commu- 
nication, which he requests, at this time. Improper motives 
might be attributed, and it might be considered premature to 
venture any opinion before the final completion of the surveys 
and the report of the Board. I will however cheerfully adopt 
whatever course you may deem advisable. 

There is nothing new. Everything, as far as my informa- 
tion extends, is going on well.

DEAR SIR, Yesterday passed off remarkably well. The 
day was fine and the welcome most hearty. The concourse of 
people was great, and of a very respectable character. The 
military tho' not numerous, made a very respectable appear- 
ance. On his part, Gen 1 La Fayette acquitted himself remark- 
able well. His replies were all appropriate, and his toasts, 
tho' evidently unpremediated, were such as to strike forcibly. 
We proceed to day to Williamsburgh and will spend Saturday 
and Sunday at Norfolk; and after visiting the Navy Yard and 
the Military works, will proceed on Monday afternoon or 
tuesday morning to Richmond. 1 am much pressed to go as

far as Richmond; and as I would only loose one, or two days, 
I have in a great measure made up my mind to go. The com- 
mittee of arrangement for Richmond has requested, that the 
Regiment of Artillery at Fort Monroe should be ordered up, 
and I have agreed to do so. The expense will be but small 
and its effects will be beneficial both to the officers and men. 
The appearance of the Regiment yesterday was ver}^ good, 
and gave great satisfaction to all, who were present. 

I find Gen 1 La Fayette is strongly inclined to proceed from 
Richmond on his visit to M r Jefferson and M r Madison, and 
not to go south till after the meeting of Congress. It is per- 
haps best, and under all circumstances, I did not think it 
proper to press the opposite view. Should you think of visit- 
ing Albemarle before the commencement of the Session, it 
seems to me, that it would have a happy effect, if you could 
so time it, as to be there, while the General was on his visit 
to M r Jefferson. It would, among other things, tend to 
increase those good feelings, which, I think, have already 
commenced in the State towards vourself and the Adm n .

Richmond 28 th Oct r 
DEAR SIR, I entirely accord in the view, which you have 
taken on the question, whether I should continue with Gen 1 
La Fayette till his arrival in Albemarle. Before I had re- 
ceived your letter, 1 had determined, on reasons similar to 
those, which you have presented, to return direct to Wash- 
ington from this place: and I expect to leave here early to- 
morrow morning by the stage. I have been much pressed to 
go to Petersburg!), but have declined the invitation. Thus 
far, I have been informed by my friends, that the vipit has 
been fortunate. No improper motive, as far as I can learn, 
has been attributed, but on the contrary, there appears to be 
a general conviction, that it was proper, that an officer of the 
Government should accompany him, as far as I have done so. 
A pretty general expectation prevailed that you would be 
here, but on the slightest explination, there appeared to be a 
conviction, that you had taken the proper course.

Gen 1 La Fayette will not leave this for Albemaiie till Tues- 
day morning, and will probably arrive at M r Jefferson's early 
on Thursday. He was very anxious to set out on Sunday 
evening, but the arrangement having been previously made 
for Tuesday, they could not be changed without great incon- 
venience, and disappointment. 1 hope you will not leave Albe- 
niarlc till he arrives. He will be much gratified to meet you 
there, and your leaving it might appear like shunning him. 

I wrote you from York and communicated my impression 
of the manner in which the occurrence had passed. From 
York we proceeded to Norfolk by the way of Williamsburgh. 
Every thing was remarkably well conducted at Norfolk. The 
reception was cordial in the extreme. The Genl. visited the 
fortifications at the north of Hampton Roads and the Navy 
Yard, with both of which he was well pleased. 

The reception here has been very hearty. The meeting 
with the old Revolutionary officers was really affecting. The 
effect of all that has occurred will I doubt not in a political 
point of view be happy. Several visitors are now waiting for 
mo which compels me to close. I have much to say which I 
will communicate when we meet. M r Hay is here and is well.

DEAK MOTHER, My absence with Gen 1 La Fayette in Vir- 
ginia, and the great accumulation of business since my return, 
has prevented me from writing to you at an earlier period. 

We are all well. Patrick had the scarlet fever while I was 
absent, but is now quite hearty. John is still a little pale and 
feeble, but has a good appetite, and is gradually getting stout. 
The other children with their mother are remarkably well. 
Your friends as far as my information extends are also well. 
M r Halby called on us yesterday; and he and his family enjoy 
good health. I have not yet rentted the House, nor sold the 
carriage and horses. I fear, I will find it difficult to do either 
to advantage. We are now in the city and the House is shut 
up and is without a tenant. Should I not succeed in obtain- 
ing one, I will get M r Smith to take charge of the premises.

me to devote more of my time to my private affairs. I hope 
that your journey out was agreeable, and that you have been 
well since. Floride and all of the children desire their love

DEAR JAMES, I am glad to hear of your safe return to the 
country. 

The expidition will not proceed this year. 1 brought the 
subject before the Cabinet at the commencement of the ses- 
sion; but the opinion was, that it could not be conducted as 
it ought to be without the consent of the Mexican govern- 
ment, and that it ought accordingly to be postponed till some 
arrangement could be made with it. I hope that it may be 
commenced another year. 

We are all anxious to see you. We will expect you imme- 
diately. We will set out for Carolina about the last of March. 
You had better go out with us. 

As to your draft, I can only meet it by drawing on John 
JBonneau on your own account, as I have not drawn one cent 
from my crop yet. You must write to him immediately and 
inform him that I will draw on him for the amount. 

We are all well. Maria and Patrick are at my elbows and 
say you must come immediately.

To Samuel L. 

Abbeville 10 th June 1825 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read with much interest your letter 
of the 1 st May, and I concur with you in almost every particular 
in the views, which you have taken of your State politicks. 
I trust, however, that you will not think of retiring at your 
.next election. I should consider such a determination as un- 
fortunate both on your account, and the State. The reforma- 
tion of New York, which I deem so important to the Union, 
must be the work of } r oung men. The more advanced in age 
have been so corrupted, under the former order of things, 
that I expect no good from them. Among the young, I know 
of no one better calculated to lead in giving a new character 
to the State, than yourself. It is the sphere for you; and 
one in which you will not only acquire an elevated standing 
in the state, but will have the conscious satisfaction of having 
acted an useful part. I deeply appreciate the motives, which 
impel in a different direction; but I do trust our venerable 
and excellent friend will be able to pass through his difficul- 
ties with the rising prosperity of the country towards which 
he has so largely contributed by his enlightened administra- 
tion. With the present prosperous condition of the country 
I trust that a correspondent rise in real estates will follow, and 
that he may be anablcd to bring such portions of his estate into 
market at a fair price, as will free him from difficulty, after 
Congress has rendered to him, what is strictly due to him. 
At all events, I trust, that you will not find a continuance of 
your Legislative career as incompatiable with that degree of 

'/. c., at New Lanark in Scotland.

attention to your private affairs, which under the circum- 
stances may be necessary. 1 In a political point of view, I do 
believe, that now is your time, both for the state and the na- 
tion. Among other things, I do trust, that your state will 
not rest satisfied with giving to the people of New York, that 
control, which they ought to have in the choice of a Presi- 
dent; but that your Legislature will follow up the subject 
and by new resolutions be felt on this great subject over the 
whole Union. She is now on this point placed in a situation, 
in which her interest and duty strictly coincide. I do firmly 
believe, that an amendment to the Constitution, as to the 
mode of choosing the President, is indispensible. The pres- 
ent mode will end in deep corruption. Let the people have 
the power directly; let the votes be by districts; and, if there 
be no choice, let the two highest candidates be sent back to 
the people, and all will be well. To effect this great object 
your Legislature can do much, if put in action; and I know 
of no one better calculated to put it in action, than yourself, 
who so well understands the present dangerous defects. 

I have met with a hearty welcome everywhere on my 
return, which has gratified me, not as a matter for vanity, 
but as affording evidence of the popularity of the principles 
which have governed me in publick life. A few days since 
business took me to Augusta, where, contrary to my expecta- 
tions, I was no less kindly received, than on this side of the 
river. I find a strong disposition to support the measures of 
the administration so long as it acts on the policy of M r Mon- 
roe's; but, if I am not mistaken, M r . Adams will find at the 
next election that the people have too much sense to confirm 
the dangerous precedent, which he and M r . Clay have cre- 
ated. I find not one who does not consider the example as 
dangerous; or who will be willing to see it confirmed by the 
people in electing M r Adams. 

I will return to Pendleton in a few days where I will be 
stationary through the summer and be happy to hear from you.

MY DEAR SIR, I am under great obligations to you for the 
fulness and frequency of your communications. 2 The attempt 
to change the order adopting the regulations is too mean to 
deserve any other notice except contempt. The late adminis- 
tration of the Department stands on too solid a ground to be 
shaken by such impotent attacks. I have been most heartily 
welcomed every where on my return. 1 confess, that I have 
boon gratified, not as a matter of vanity, but as confirming 
my conviction, that the faithful discharge of duty is the sure 
mode of acquiring the public favour. 

1 find the temper to be nearly universal to support the 
measures of the administration, so long as it adheres to the 
policy of its immediate predecessor. This 1 rejoice to see. 
It strongly illustrates the good sense and virtue of the people. 
No less universal is the impression, that the recent election 
by the House and the appointment of Mr. Clay constitutes a 
most dangerous precedent, which the people cannot confirm 
without danger to public liberty. I doubt not that this 
conviction will strongly manifest itself three years hence. 
We will return to Pendlcton in a few days where we will be 
stationary during a greater portion of the summer. We are 
all well, and Mrs. Calhoun joins her respects to yourself, M rs 
V. and the family.

class of politicians with 3^011; or that they so badly under- 
stood my character, as their speculations would seem to imply. 
He who acts honestly seems to be the greatest deceiver. I 
had supposed, that my course had been so uniform, and the 
principles on which I acted so distinctly stated, and openly 
avowed, that no man of intelligence could doubt how I would 
act in my present situation. How could any one doubt, that 
I would adhere to that line of policy, when out of the admin- 
istration, which I supported while a member of the Cabinet 
and of Congress? My policy has never depended on my 
position but on principles and truth, and cannot change. If 
additional proof is required to this fact, it shall not be want- 
ing. My situation at least gives me the opportunit} T of fur- 
nishing it. It also affords me an opportunity, which will not 
be neglected, of proving my devotion to the power of the 
people, as against that of political leaders; and by the time I 
am done, no one, no not my enemies, shall doubt my character. 
I hold it higher than the Presidency; and will never sacri- 
fice it. 

The publick sentiment in this state is very sound; and I do 
not doubt, but that the whole South will be^ united as one 
man, when the time comes. 

Let me hear from you often, and continue to send all that 
is interesting. I am glad [to] hear that the Gov rl is doing so 
well. Make my respects to him and assure him, that no one 
wishes for his success in the office more than myself.

very sick family. We never had in the same time as much

sickness. All of the children, except James, have had very 
severe colds with coughs accompanied by fever in every 
instance but Andrew. Cornelia had quite a high fever, but 
recovered speedily. The fever with Maria was slight, but 
followed by a distressing deafness, of which, however, she 
has in a great measure recovered* Patrick's attack was 
slight, but as if to make up, on thursday week he fell from a 
rocking chair, on which he was playing, on his left elbow, 
and greatly injured his arm. It was at first thought the bone 
was broke, but it proved to be an injury in the joint. He 
suffered much pain ; and had to lie on his back for four days 
without changing position. His arm is now in a sling, and 
will recover, we hope, without permanent injury. But these 
cases were all light compared to John's. He has been at the 
point of death, and has just begun to exhibit symptoms of 
recovery. He was taken with a cough and fever on Friday 
week, but our attention being wholly directed towards Pat- 
rick, who had been hurt the day before, very little attention 
was given to him. On Sunday his symptoms became dis- 
tressing, but still the Doctor thought lightly of his case. On 
Monday his case became so bad, that he requestfed] leave to 
consult with another physician. His case was now highly 
alarming. The most vigourous course of medicine had to be 
resorted to. He kept sinking, and on Monday there seemed 
to be little hope of his recovery, on which day James left us 
to join the Macedonian Frigate at Norfolk with an impression, 
that he would never see him again. Low as he then was, he 
sunk still lower. On Friday he reached the lowest point of 
depression. He lay the whole day in a languid stupor, with- 
out noticing anything. The disease which had been confined 
to the chest and bowels now appeared to attack the head. At 
this point we almost wholly dispaired of his recovery. Yes- 
terday he was more roused, but veiy restless. To day he is 
decidedly better, so much so that a fair hope may now be 
entertained of his recovery. His fever is abated. He is 
calm, and his disrellish of food has given away to a better 
appetite. He took some tea for the first time, about an hour 
ago with a relish. 

To add, appearantly, to our misfortunes, D r . Lovell our fam- 
ily physician was absent. In the alarm about Patrick's arm the 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 235 

nearest physicians D rs Henderson and young D r Worthington 
were called in, and have continued their attendance on John. 
They have, I think, treated his case with great skill, and with 
devoted attention, to which, under a kind Providence, I have 
no doubt we owe his recovery thus far. Should his case tako 
again an unfavourable turn, I will write to you immediately. 
The warm weather, and sickness in my family will prevent me 
from coming out till toward fall. I hope Brough is doing 
well. I must entreat you not to interfere with him in any 
respect; for I have long noticed, that the slightest interfer- 
ence is sure to discourage and to give a pretex for misbe- 
haviour. Should he act amiss write to me immediately, and 
let John Ewing know. I will be out so soon as I can safely 
travel in the fall. 

Floride, and the children all desire their love to you. Pat- 
rick when he got hurt wished for wings that he might fly to 
you to nurse him. 



To Mrs. Floride Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 14 th June 1826. 

D r MOTHER, Floride and myself had concluded, that we will 
best advance our interest, by fixing our residence to the South 
instead of this place, and as the travelling will be bad in *the 
Spring, she prefers going out in the fall when the roads are 
good. You may therefore expect us the last of September or 
early in October. In the mean time, I have requested John 
to have some improvement made in the house by repairing 
the piazza and enlarging the side, in which the Stair case runs 
up, as you will see in my letter to him. 

It is my intention to fix permanently in Pendleton, and to 
commence building immediately on my return, if an exchange 
can be had with Col Lewis. I have requested John to make 
an exchange on an}^ reasonable terms before I return, and in 
the mean time to say nothing of my intention. 

I have offered an exchange to Col Carter, and he is to let 
me know his determination in the fall, after he has examined 
both places. 

John is better, but far from being well. Patrick's arm 
mends. The rest of the children with Floride are well. 



236 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

James expected to sail from Norfolk on monday. I heard 
from him yesterday. He was well and in good sperits. 

[P. S.] Floride and all the children send their love to you. 
Patrick often talks of you. 

I will sell this place if a good price offers and you do not 
object. If not, or if it should not be agreeable to you to sell, 
I will rent on the best terms we can. 



To John Ewing CalJioun. c. c. 

Washington 14 th June 1826 

DEAR JOHN, The great fall in the price of our staple com- 
modity and the impossibility of reducing our expenses con- 
sistently with what is due to the office I occupy, to the limits 
of the salary affixed by law, have induced us to change our 
arrangement of fixing our residence here, instead of the South. 
We have concluded to return in the fall, as early as the season 
will admit, as your sister prefers travelling at that season, 
instead of the spring, when the roads are usually in so wretched 
a state, as we found by experience on our return the last time. 

I must request the favour of you, preparatory to our re- 
turn, to have Clergy Hall repaired, so as to answer for a tempo- 
rary residence. We wish the piazza to be repaired and such 
an enlargement of the space, through which the Stair case 
passes, as will give a pantry of good size, and a comfortable 
bed chamber instead of the little room, that Andrew used to 
occupy, with a door to open between it and your mother's 
chamber. 

If you can spare your carpenters to do the work, I will very 
cheerfully allow you the ordinary rate of compensation, and 
if you cannot, I must request you to get some one to do the 
work before we come out, say the 1 st October. 

It is my intention to build immediately on the Hill to the 
left of the road to the court house, provided an exchange can 
be made with Col Lewis; and I must also request you to effect 
the exchange on the best terms you can, provided they be any 
way reasonable. If he knew of my intention he would doubt- 
less avail himself of it to rise in his demands, and on that 
account as well as others I do not wish my intention to be 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 287 

known at present, and I wish the exchange to be effected 
before my return. 

John has not wholly recovered. Patrick's arm is getting 
well. The rest of the children are well. James sailed, or 
rather expected to sail from Norfolk on Monday last. The 
Macedonian goes direct to Rio. 

I have written to your mother on the subject of this letter, 
and I wish you to consult her about the arrangement proposed 
to be made about the house. 

Let me hear from you immediately. 

Floride and the children desire their love to you and 
Mother. 



To James Edward Callwun. c. c. 

Washington 24 th Dec 1 '. 1826. 

MY DEAR JAMES, 1 have received your four several com- 
munications, of which the first is under date of the 17 th August 
and the last 15 th October. The last was favoured by M r 
Pope; and I have written to M r Lynch in relation to the 
baskets of wreaths and branches, but there has not yet been 
time to receive them. 

I have read with great interest your observations and reflec- 
tions on the state of things in Brazil. It is a most important 
section of our Continent, in the condition of which every one, 
who looks to the future must take a lively interest. You can- 
not confer on me a greater favour, than to continue your com- 
munications and to extend them to all subjects connected with 
its future destiny. I will not attempt to designate them, as 
your own sound judgement will point them out. 

Many changes have occurred since you sailed, tho but a few 
months have elapsed. You left John in a state almost hope- 
less. Some days after you left us, his symptoms became much 
better, and I wrote you at Norfolk to that effect. In a short 
time, however, he relapsed and sunk lower than when you last 
saw him, with every symptom of a deep affection of the lungs. 
He remained for several weeks in that state, almost wholly 
dispaired of by the Physicians. One remedy only remained, 
and that was to travel. We determined to take him South; 



238 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

and accordingly set out on the 19 th July for Pendleton. He 
was so low, that it seemed almost desperate to think of moving 
him. He continued to sink on the journe}^ till we reached 
Salisbery; where he became so feeble, that he could no longer 
stand the motion of the carriage. We then resorted to medi- 
cine again, and by the blessing of a kind Providence, with 
success. His desease so far yield[ed], that we were enabled 
to reach home by slow travelling and on the very day of our 
arrival his cough ceased, and has not since returned. He con- 
tinued to recover steadily but slowly; and when I left home 
was entirely restored. It looks almost like a resurrection. 

It has in part contributed to a great change in our domestick 
arrangement. We determined to fix ourselves South; and 
accordingly rented Oakly to Maj r . Van Deventer, and sent 
our furniture South. Clergy Hall will be our future resi- 
dence, and I have commenced improving by adding largely 
to the old establishment. As this is the short session, I left 
your sister with the children South. They were all well; in 
fact I may say in high health. I never saw the children look 
more hearty. Patrick's arm had healed, but never will be 
entirely straight. Andrew is going to School to M r M c Clin- 
tock in the Village. Maria is gone to Edgefield to a female 
Academy there. She will live in M r Simkins' family. Pat- 
rick, John and Cornelia will be taught by Miss Mary Ann 
Bell at home, who is staying with us. We have the prospect 
of a very agreeable neighborhood there. Many lower country 
families were up last summer; and more spoke of coming up 
the next. But I fear the division which the Legislature has 
made this session, of the District will be a great draw back 
on our future prospect in that respect. It is to be divided 
by a line running East and West, and the upper division to be 
called Pickens, and the lower Anderson. John's letter which 
accompanies this will give you an account of your own affairs, 
which will supercede the necessity of any communication on 
that point from me. Our friends were all well, when I last 
heard from home. I think there has been neither death, nor 
marriage, nor removal, except of M r and M rs Milligan to 
Alabama. Rumour says F. Pickens is engaged to Eliza Sim- 
kins, and such I believe to be the fact. Warren Davis beat 
Wilson for Congress by 25 votes. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 239 

By mentioning this incident, I am naturally brought to 
politicks. The session has been thus far very quiet; but it is 
manifest, that the line of seperation is better drawn, and the 
feelings on both sides higher than at the last session. The 
great topick of the session will be the W. India trade, which 
I fear we have permanently lost by the neglect of the admin- 
istration, and their opposition to its adjustment at the last 
session; nor would I be surprized, if the whole of our com- 
mercial relation with England should, in its consequences, be 
involved in difficulty. The Panama question has lost all of 
the consequence, so artfully given to it by the Adm n . They 
arc sick and shame of it. On the whole, the side of principle 
has evidently gained, and if no adverse circumstance occurs, 
I think victory certain. As to myself, 1 have ceased to be 
the object of the malignant attack of those in power. The 
dicision on the question of order gave rise to a very animated 
discussion last summer, which has resulted in a complete vic- 
tory on our side, tho the prejudice among those, who will 
neither read, nor think is not yet wholly removed. 

14 th Feb y 

The long interval between the date of what I now write and 
the foregoing will doubtless excite your surprise. . It has been 
caused by a most unexpected incident, of which the publick 
prints has doubtless made you acquainted. Just at the moment, 
that I was falicitating myself, that 1 had ceased to be an 
object of bitter party attacks, a deep laid conspericy to 
destroy for ever my reputation, was ready to burst on me. 1 
An artful charge of participating in the profits of the Mix's 
contract was got up, and published in the Government papers 
here, with such circumstances as were calculated to excite 
publick curiosity, and to give the whole an air almost official. 
I at once saw the assassin aim, and determined to repel it 
instantly, and effectively, by an appeal to the House of Rep- 
resentatives, demanding an investigation. It was granted, 
but the chair, forgetting the first principles of justice, consti- 
tuted the Committee, with the exception of two, of hostile 
materials. The result was a protraction of the investigation, 

i See Niles's Register, Vol. XXII, 251, 279, XXXI, 292; and American State Papers, Mili- 
tary Affairs, II, 431-449. The contract was for stone at the Rip-Raps, was made in 1818 
and reported on in 1822, when Calhoun W as exonerated. 



240 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

or rather inquisition for forty days, but a life of spotless 
political purity bore me through every difficulty, and com- 
pelled my enemies to acquit honorably, tho forgery and per- 
jury were both resorted to by the vile wretch, who was the 
instrument in the transaction. Not anticipating so great a 
delay, I laid aside my letter to conclude it after the termina- 
tion of the affair, and waiting from day to day I find more 
than forty days have intervened. I, however, sent to the 
Navy Department the letter from your brother, to which I 
referred in the first part of this communication, with the 
request to forward it by the first opportunity, which I sup- 
pose has been done. 

Since the date of this letter publick sentiment has more and 
more developed itself. It is adverse to those in power, and I 
am decidedly of the impression their overthrow is certain. 

I continue to hear from home every week. All remained 
well at the last date. Maria was quite contented at Edgefield 
and M r Simkins writes that she acquires knowledge with the 
greatest facility. Your namesake is a fine, hearty boy and is 
very much like Patrick.

Washington 15 th Jan y 1827 

MY DEAR JOHN, I wrote you at Augusta as you requested, 
and have delayed acknowledging yours dated there, in the 
hope of receiving an answer to mine. 

I think you have done well in disposing of the boat, from 
the discription, which you give of the river. 

I am sorry to learn from your sister, that the negroes at 
Clergy Hall have been in some instances disorderly. She 
feels quite uneasy about it. I hope that they have been 
brought into entire subjection; but I must ask it as a favour 
for you to see that all is right, and if not the most decided 
measures be adopted to bring them to a sense of duty. 

We are going on prosperously in our political struggle. 
If no adverse incident occur the administration must sink 
into a minority not very respectable for number, talent, or 
character. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 241 

As it regards myself you have seen the foul attempt on my 
character. The Committee are going on in the investigation, 
and if I mistake not their report, tho' a majority are decidedly 
my opponents, will exhibit one of the most wicked attempts 
ever made, to destroy my character, extending even to perjury 
and forgery. You need not fear the result. I leave the 
Committee to their own course simply urging that the whole 
be investigated to the bottom. 

The weather is very severe. This is one of the coldest 
days I ever felt. Let me hear from you, and rembr me 
affectionately to Mother.

Washington 31 st Jan y 1827 

DEAR JOHN, I was glad to receive so full an account of my 
business as you gave me in your last; but regret that the 
plantation business seemed to go on so badly after I left home. 
1 suppose, however, there was great interruption, in conse- 
quence of the building. I am anxious about the ditches, and 
the ploughing, and hope they will both be attended to. You 
may make arrangement and send my cotton with yours. Send 
mine to my factors in Augusta. I see no prospect of a rise. 
The current of events is running strongly against the ad- 
ministration. Their overthrow is not only certain, but will 
be complete. I would not be surprized if it should be so 
much so, that even a large portion of New England should 
be lost to them. 

The inquisition over me, for so it should be called, is still 
continued. They have been employed about everything ex- 
cept that for which the Committee was created, which has 
not engaged a day of their time. It is certainly not intended 
in kindness, but it will turn out the}" will prove my best 
friends, for it will be seen, that in whatever condition I 
found the Department, and whatever may have been the 
irregularity in the first instance in consequence of the previ- 
ous disorder, I left it in the most perfect condition. The 
Committe cannot in decency spin out the case much longer.

The publick feeling will not permit it, and I think a report 
may be expected on Friday, or Saturday. 

The weather has been very severe, but is now mild.

To Virgil Maxcy(?Y 

Washington 12 th Feb y 1827 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just received yours of the 10 th Ins*, 
and am of the impression, that the course contemplated is a 
correct one. 

You mention nothing of my last letter in answer to your 
former, and I fear you may not have received it. It was 
written in a few hours after yours came to hand. Will you 
let me know by the return mail whether you have received 
it? I do not frank this so that it may certainly reach you. 

The Committee will, I understand, report tomorrow morn- 
ing, and altho' forced to do me justice on the subject referred, 
I am prepared to see my vindication in the manner of that 
spirit, which governed in its formation, and which has caused 
so long a procrastination. 2 



To James Monroe* 

Washington 30 th [sic] February 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letter of the 26 th Inst. 
with the documents enclosed, which I herewith return agree- 
ably to your request. 

The letter of the 9 th September 1818 is doubtless the one, 
to which my informant refers; and I am only surprised, how 
the letter could have passed out of my possession, and how 
any one could perceive the least mysteiy in it. Its object is 
so manifest, that it would seem almost impossible to mistake 
it, and so fair, that instead of censure, it must (should it ever 
become the subject of enquiry) receive the approbation of any

liberal mind. I feel assured, that any step you took, through- 
out the whole of the complicated and delicate transaction to 
which it relates, will bear the test of the most rigid scrutiny, 
and that history will do you ample justice in relation to it. 
Any attempt to detract from what is justly your due, by 
letters improperly obtained must recoil on the head of its 
author. 

On due deliberation, I have concluded, that I cannot bring 
the incident with propriety to the knowledge of Judge White. 
In his prudence and sagacity, I have the highest confidence; 
but, as the information was given me under the strictest in- 
junction not to repeat it, I do not feel at liberty to communi- 
cate to any one but yourself, for the reason suggested in my 
former letter. I have no doubt, but it was communicated to 
me with the most friendly intention, with the view of putting 
me on my guard, and it was from a conviction, that such was 
the intention, that I felt myself justified in making it known 
to you. I have read with much interest your letters to the 
Judge, which have given me a much fuller view of the sub- 
ject, to which they refer, than what I previously possessed. 
From your observation, I feel confident that your devotion 
to your country through that trying period never was exceeded, 
and such, I do not the least doubt, is the settled conviction of 
the country. Nor do I doubt, that Gen 1 Jackson fully appre- 
ciates your sagacity, zeal and labour, to which the country is 
so much indebted. You have much cause to be proud of the 
association of your name with the country of the Mississippi 
on three memorable occasions. I do most sincerely hope, that 
nothing can bring your claim and that of Gen 1 Jackson's into 
conflict. There are those, who would rejoice at it, in the hope 
of profiting by it, but to his and your real friends it would be 
a most distressing incident, and to none more so than to myself. 
Having the highest esteem for both, I would consider such an 
event as among the most unfortunate of my life. In speak- 
ing with such solicitude, I must say, I cannot believe such an 
occurrence to be in any degree probable. I think so, because 
I put the highest estimate on the patriotism, generousity and 
U'ood sense of yourself and the General. Your claims on the 
country, so far from conflicting are in the strictest unison. I 
propose to set out for the South on Saturday, or Sunday. 



244 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I would take Oak Hill in my way and spend the first night 
with you, but am prevented by the bad condition of the road

Please to make my respects to M rs Monroe. 



To Walter Lowrie. 1 

Pendleton 1 st April, 1827. 

D r . SIR, I received by the last mail your three several let- 
ters of the 9, 12, and 14th of March, the former enclosing the 
resolution of the Senate in relation to the change in the seats 
of the Senate Chamber, with two proposed drafts of. -Plans by 
M r . Bulfinch. 2 

I am of the impression that No. 1, with some alteration, is 
preferable. The greatest objection to it is, that the three 
seats on each side of the chair of the V. President and nearest 
to it (pencil marked 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,) are so situated as to be 
intercepted by the chair and the seat of the Secretary of the 
Senate. 

Space must be found for them else-where, and this may be 
effected by diminishing the space in front of the chair, or that 
between the termination of the rows of seats and the pillars. 
It appears to me that a contraction of both would add to con- 
venience and appearance, so as to bring the two opposite rows 
of seats nearer together, and to remove the seats pencil 
marked 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, farther towards the pillars. 

An improvement might also perhaps be made by bringing 
the seats a little more in front of the chair, so as to approxi- 
mate in a slight degree to No. 2. I leave the arrangement of 
the Table and seat of the Secretary to your own discretion 
wholly, with a suggestion, that his seat ought not to be quite 
so far from the chair as it now is. The Chair of the Presid- 
ing officer ought to be just so much elevated, that when the 
Secretary stands up his view shall not be intercepted. There 
ought to be no canopy, as it would intercept the sky light. 

1 Text derived from a copy furnished by Mrs. J. S. H. Fogg, of Boston. Walter Lowrie. 
who had been Senator from Pennsylvania from 1819 to 1825, was secretary of the U. S. 
Senate from 1825 to 183G. He was one of the editors of the folio American State Papers, 

'-' The architect of the Capitol. 



LETTEBS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 245 

The form of the chair, and all circumstances of mere taste 
must be left very much to the judgement of M r . Bulfinch. The 
Gallery does not fall within the scope of the resolution, and 
must be omitted. 

The space between the pillars and the fire-places, I wish to 
have seated off for the accommodation of members of the other 
house, etc. etc., and so as to prevent walking back and for- 
ward as is now usual with the members, provided it can be 
done consistently with the arrangement of the fire places. 

In the detail you will doubtless find many points, on which 
I have made no suggestions, and in relation to which, you will 
exercise your discretion. 

Let all be done, as to fashion, correspondently to the style 
of the chamber, and with due regard to economy. 

In relation to the proposition of M r . Carrol you have acted 
with propriety. Make no exchange, but such as may be done 
with mutual convenience. 

The drafts are herewith returned. Let me hear from you 
on your return to Washington. 



To Chrixtoplier Van De 

Pendleton 23 d July 182T 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read with interest your letter of the 
18 th June and the numbers in the Telegraph to which they 
refer. 

I hope, that you will be able to make the most satisfactory 
arrangement, as to your business,, and that-such will be your 
success, as to make the arts of your enimies, tho' intended to 
injure you deeply, in their consequences eminently beneficial 
to you. Your industry, sobriety method and intelligence 
ought, and I doubt not, will ensure your success in whatever 
business you may engage in. 2 

I find you are not alone in the opinion that I ought to visit 
the North, with the view to remove unfavourable impressions, 
which have been made by the Arts of the Coalition. I have 
reflected on the subject, but cannot bring< my mind to the

of War.

same conclusion. I do believe, that in the long run, there is 
always a loss, instead of a gain in any step intended to advance 
popularity, other than through meritorious acts. At least it 
ought to be so, and I really cannot reconcile it to my mind, 
that it comports with the dignity of high publick station, to 
attempt to win popularity by the means so industriouly 
used by the members of the present administration. Neither 
myself, nor my friends ever took any step to .get up a dinner; 
and all that have ever been offered to me have, so far as I 
know, resulted spontaneously from respect; but even then, 
when compelled by a fashion, which I never did approve to 
express my sentiment I have ever done it most reluctantly, 
and in the most concise manner. I cannot doubt but my ene- 
mies have succeeded in making an impression against me to 
the North by grossly misrepresenting 1113- opinions; but I 
trust time, and circumstances will finally remove all error on 
that point. I am willing to trust to their slow, but certain 
operation, aided by the fidelity of friends. 1 do believe 
that a great crisis is approaching in our affairs, which will 
leave but little to doubt as to the character of our publick 
men. Our system has reached a most important point in its 
progress, and one that will go far to determine the question 
of its durabilty. Few men in my opinion realize the magni- 
tude of the present juncture; but it cannot pass away without 
testing severely the character of those, who are prominently 
before the nation. 

We are all well. In fact I think this one of the best 
climates in the country, being almost as exempt from bilious 
cases as any part of New England and much more so from 
most other diseases. 

M rs C. desires her best respects to yourself, M rs V. and 
r family.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 247 

Notwithstanding the concurrence of M r Maxcy's opinion 
with yours, and some other of my friends, I still remain of 
the opinion, that I ought not to take an excursion to the 
North. As far as my experience extends, no permanent good 
results from such means of acquiring popularity. It may 
give a transitory eclat, but it is almost always accompanied 
by a loss, with the cool and reflecting, whose good opinion is 
of much higher value. The desponding view, which you take 
of the future, appears to me stronger, than what the state of 
facts would justify. The triumph of the coalition, would 
indeed be a fearful event; but I see nothing to warrant the 
belief, that such will be the fact. I know how desperate will 
be the effort of those in power to maintain their ascendency; 
but with all their efforts, judging by the signs of the times, 
their doom is fixed. It may be, however, that many facts 
elude my observation, at this distance, which are calculated 
to make the impression, which seems to have fixed itself in 
your mind, and as I am always anxious to know the real state 
of things, I would be glad, that in your next you would state 
more at large the grounds of your fear. 

In the South everything is sound.

Pendleton 26 th August 1827 

MY DEAR JAMES, Since the date of my former letter to you 
in February last, which I am surprized to see, that you had 
not received at the date of your last, I have received from 
you two of the 11 th April and one of the 6 th Feb y . and another 
of the 11 th May, with their enclosures. The two of the 11 th 
April were favoured by M r Hawkins, who politely forwarded 
them on with an accompanying note. I very much regret, 
that the fact of our residence here, prevented me from meet- 
ing him and forming so valuable an acquaintance; and of 
extending to him the attention, which his kindness to you and 
his own worth so much entitle him. I hope, however, to have 
the pleasure of meeting with him on my return to Washington 
next winter. 



248 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I am not at all surprized that you should consider me as 
having forfeited all claims to a correspondence on your part, 
by my appearant neglect; but my long letter of February last, 
which, I hope, you'have received, ere this, will, I trust, satis- 
factorily explain the appearant omission. You will learn from 
it that John lingered appearantly at the point of death till the 
last of July, when we determined to try the effect of travel- 
ling and a Southern Climate; that after a very tedious journey 
we brought him here, when his health began to improve. 
That these circumstances effected an entire change in our 
arrangement, determining me to leave Georgetown, and fix our 
residence at this place, where I had commence[d] improving. 
It also stated the assassin attempt to stab my character, how I 
met it, and what was the result, and the delay which followed 
in completing the letter, which had been commenced not long 
after my arrival at Washington. 

I allude to its contents in part, under the apprehension, that 
you may not receive it, and with the desire, that you may be 
satisfied; for you may rest assured, I am very far from under- 
valuing your correspondence. Since my return from Wash- 
ington, nothing has occurred, that could give much interest 
to a communication. Uninterupted health, good seasons, fine 
crops of corn and small grain, with good prospect of cotton 
excepting, that it is rather more backward than usual, in con- 
sequence of the remarkable late Spring, fill up the account, 
under those humble, but not uninteresting heads. The chil- 
dren have all grown much, and have the appearance of perfect 
health. Andrew is taller, and larger than yourself. He goes 
to school in the Village, but rides from home. I think of 
sending him to West Point, but have not determined. Anna 
Maria has also grown much. She is now at home, but has 
been at a very good school at Edgefield, to which she will 
return in a few weeks. She stays, when there, with M r Sim- 
kins' family. Patrick is slim, and fresh. John and Cornelia 
quite stout, and your little namesake, with his fair complex- 
ion, blue eyes, and flaxen hair, will do you no discredit. He 
walks and talks. 

Of deaths, I know of none in the whole circle of our friends, 
except the old Farmer, who died last winter; nor do I recol- 
lect any marriage, except Lucretia's, my brother William's

daughter to D* Town of Green Ville 1 . There will, however, 
soon be another. Francis Pickens will be united in October 
to Miss Eliza Simkins. We will all be at the wedding. His 
father and sister are in from Alabama, and so was Ezekiel 
Pickens but has returned. The union between Francis and 
Eliza takes place with the hearty consent of all friends. She 
is quite handsome and a very fine girl. He, with his father 
and sister, is now on a visit to the Warm Springs. He has 
been induced to take the journey from a slight wound in one 
of his hands, which at one time seriously threatened to be fol- 
lowed by the lockjaw. The symptoms had not entirely disap- 
peared, but had greatly abated. 

1 have given all of the domestick incidents, which have 
occurred to me, and in which you will probably take much 
interest. As it regards your own business, your brother of 
course keeps you informed. One of my hands came up a few 
days since, and says, that all are well at Midway, 2 and that the 
crop is good. Mentioning your brother, reminds me, that he 
has added a son to his family within the last few weeks. He 
is a fine hearty boy, but is, as yet, nameless. 

The political world has assumed a very boisterous appear- 
ance, which at the approaching session, will probably work up 
into a storm. I never have seen such abundant elements of 
discord, much the greater part of which springs, by an almost 
mvossary consequence out of the late Presidential election. 
There is a deep and settled conviction, on the part of a large 
portion of the Community, not only that M r Adams came in 
against the publick voice, but that it was effected by a cor- 
rupt understanding with M r Clay. This impression, so weak- 
ens the administration, that to sustain themselves the most 
dangerous, and corrupt means have been resorted to, as is 
generally thought. The employment of such has in turn 
greatly inflamed the publick mind, already deeply aggitated 
by the circumstances attending the election. Among the 
means resorted to there is one, in particular, that, in my 
opinion even threatens danger to the Union, I mean that of

arraying the great geographical interests of the union against 
one another. The wisest men of the country, have divided 
in opinion, how far Congress has the power, and admitting 
they possess it, how far, on principle, encouragement may be 
given to domestick manufactures, as connected with the great 
consideration of the defence and independence of the country. 
But whatever may be the diversity of opinion among the wise 
and patriotick, as to the discreet exercise of this great power 
of changing the capital and industry of the country, there can- 
not among such, be any doubt, that the power itself is highly 
dangerous, and may be perverted to purposes most unjust 
and oppressive. Through such an exercise of it, one section 
of the country may really be made tributary to another; and 
by this partial action, artful and corrupt politicians may use 
nearly half of the wealth of the country to buy up partisans, 
in order to acquire, or retain power. This very use of it, 
many, and they highly intelligent, below the heads of the 
Administration are attempting to employ. 

About a year ago, a great excitement was got up in Boston 
by the Capitalists, with a view professedly to give an increase 
duty on Woollens for their protection. A Bill was reported to 
the House of Rep yes amounting in fact to a prohibition, and 
after much heat passed that body. It came to the Senate, 
where it was laid on the Table by my casting vote. Since the 
adjournment, an extensive scheme, originating as it is thought, 
with those in power, has been got up, to have a general con- 
vention of the manufacturing interest at Harrisburgh, avow- 
edly to devise measures for the passage of this Bill; 1 and thus 
the dangerous example is set of seperate representation, and 
association of great Geographical interests to promote their 
prosperity at the expense of other interests, unrepresented, 
and fixed in another section, which, of all measures that can 
be conceived, is calculated to give the greatest opportunity- to 
art, and corruption, and to make two of one nation. How 
far the administration is involved in this profligate scheme, 
time will determine; but if they be, the curse of posterity 
will be on their head. In the mean time, the South has com- 
menced with remonstrating against this unjust and oppressive

attempt to sacrifice their interest; and, I do trust, that they 
will not be provoked to step beyond strict constitutional reme- 
dies. I have given a fuller view on this point, as I am of the 
impression, that from it great events will spring. It must 
lead to defeat or oppression or resistence, or the correction of 
what perhaps is a great defect in our system; that the sepe- 
rate geographical interests are not sufficiently guarded. This 
for yourself. We are all gratified to hear of your health, and 
of your high estimation with the officers and crew. I never 
doubted, that such would be the case. 

All of the family join their affectionate love with their wish 
for your safe and speedy return. 

Your sister requests me to say that the artificial flowers 
came safe, have been distributed as requested, and are much 
admired. 

Tho I write seldom, I make up by length, and hope you will 
consider the forfeiture of }^our correspondence removed.

Washington 9 th Dec r . 1827 

MY DEAR SIR, Nothing but necessity has compelled me to 
break in on your retirement, by making the request contained 
in the enclosed communication. Between M r Crawford and 
myself there never has been the least personal difference; and 
during the whole time, I was in your administration, I think, 
I may say, that in all of the conflicts with his friends, I acted 
on the defensive. I had hoped, that time, and change of cir- 
cumstances would allay the angry feelings, which political col- 
lision had excited; but while this is true, as I believe, in relation 
to the great body of his supporters, it seems that there are 
some in Georgia, who are determined to renew them, if possi- 
ble, with increased acrimony. On my part, I am determined 
to give them no pretext. No one can be more averse to the 
excitement of such feelings; and nothing but the strong con- 
viction of publick duty has ever induced me, to pursue a course, 
which might expose me to them. But averse, as I am to per-

sonal animosity, I cannot reconcile it to my feelings to rest 
under a charge of ingratitude, thus solemnly made; and, as 
none but yourself, can enable me effectually to repel it, to you 
I have resorted, for a correct statement of the facts for that 
purpose. I am the more averse to believe, that M r Crawford 
countenances the statement in the extracts, as it is utterly in- 
consistent, with that, which he voluntarily made to me some- 
time after, I came into the War Department. 

He stated to me, that after Goven r . Shelby declined the ap- 
pointment of Secretary of War, you no longer felt }^ourself 
bound to look to the West, and that coming to the Atlantick 
States, you could not possibly overlook M r Lowndes as M r 
Madison had offered him the place, towards the close of his 
administration ; and that on M r Lowndes' declining, the names of 
General Williams and my own occurred, out of which to make 
the selection. He also stated, that he (M r Crawford) was well 
pleased with either; but as he and Gen 1 Williams had been 
long and intimately acquainted, and (I think he added) as he 
had military experience, his preference inclined to him, but 
adding that he was gratified with my appointment. I under- 
stood M r Crawford's object in the conversation to be, to re- 
move from my mind, any unfriendly impression, which might 
be supposed by me to exist on his part towards me on the 
ground, that he had preferred another to myself, particularly, 
as I had taken a very decided part as he knew in the proceed- 
ing Presidential election in your favour against him. His 
conversation, as I supposed, assumed, that I either knew, or 
would know the part, that he took in regard to my appoint- 
ment, but never doubting, that I owed my selection to your 
preference founded on personal knowledge, and knowing, that 
I had never solicited office, I did not deem it worth while to 
make the least enquiry, what part he, or any other took in 
regard to my appointment. 

The only observation, which I ever beard you make in rela- 
tion to it, was that in your tour of inspection, 1 you found a 
very general desire among the principal officers that I should 
be appointed Secretary. 

In asking you for a statement, it is not my desire to bring 
your name before the publick, but simply to possess the means 

1 In the summer of 1817. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 253 

of repelling a dishonorable imputation on my character. My 
present impression is to transmit, when I receive it, a copy to 
M r Crawford, with a statement of his conversation above 
referred to and to request him, as an act of justice to cause 
the papers, which have published the charge to contradict it, 
provided you see no objection to the course. 

I am gratified to learn from our friends here that your 
health and that of your family is good. I am suffering under 
the effects of an influenza. 



To James Monroe. 1 

Washington 9 th Dec r . 1827. 

DEAR SIR, Knowing your aversion to being involved, in 
any degree, in the political discussions of the day, I regret 
exceedingly to be compelled by a regard to my character to 
request you to furnish me with a statement of the facts con- 
nected with my appointment, as Secretary of the Department 
of War. The reason why I make the request, will be fully 
understood on perusing the extracts, (which I herewith en- 
closed) from two of the leading news papers published in 
Georgia. Their object cannot be mistaken; and, if in the 
attempt to injure me, the writers had been content to limit 
themselves to the effort of exciting anew the angry feelings 
which attended the late Presidential election, it would have 
saved me the regret of breaking in on your retirement; but 
in order to wound me in the tenderest point, they have 
attempted to fix on my character, the charge of ingratitude, 
by alleging as a fact, that I owe my appointment as a member 
of your cabinet to M r Crawford's influence, against your own 
inclination, and not to your own spontaneous selection of me, 
on personal knowledge. If such be the case, I can only say, 
I have been heretofore wholly ignorant of the fact. I had 
supposed, that you had selected me, as one of your confiden- 
tial, and constitutional advisers, from a long and intimate 
personal acquaintance formed under the most trying circum- 
stances, unsolicited by anyone; and I must add, that, if the 
least suspicion had existed on nry part, that the fact was other-

254 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

wise, no consideration could have induced me to accept of an 
office so confidential, and in discharging the duties of which 
with perfect fidelity to the head of the Administration, I 
might be exposed to the charge of ingratitude to one of its 
members. 

Not believing it possible, that I was, without my knowledge, 
placed in a situation that no honorable man would voluntarily 
assume, and which was so well calculated to endanger my 
character, 1 cannot for a moment suspect, that the statement 
is correct; nor can I suppose, that it has been made on the 
authority of M r Crawford, but being made in so solemn a 
manner in leading Journals in his State, and favourable to his 
interest, if it remains uncontradicted the world must believe it 
to be true. To repel the charge of ingratitude, thus attempted 
to be attached to me, while a member of your Cabinet and' 
cooperating in the measures of your administration, will, 1 
trust be considered by you as a sufficient apology for making 
most reluctantly, as I do, this application. 

I will thank you to return the extracts.

Confidential. Washington 22 d Dec r 1827 

DEAR SIR, You will recollect my letter of the 21 st February 
last, and the letter therein alluded to. When I wrote to you, Ij 
only knew that such a letter was in existence, without know-j 
ing into whose possession it had come. Within the last few 
days, I accidentally heard of a letter, which I suppose to be! 
the same, with such circumstances, as leave me no doubt where 
it is. Believing that there was much misapprehension, as to 
its object, I felt it to be a duty, which I owed to you to 
myself, and to all concerned to take promptly measures to cor- 
rect it. With this view, I have taken steps to obtain a copy 
of the letter, in order to ascertain whether it is the letter of 
the 9 th September 1818; and in the mean time, I must request 
you to furnish a copy of your letter of the 19 th July 1818 to 
Gen 1 Jackson, of his letter of the 19 th August following to 
you, of yours of the 9 th Sep 1 ' following to me, of our corre-

spondence growing out of it, with a copy of any other letter, 
or document necessary to a full elucidation of the subject. 1 

I have witnessed with pain the efforts to involve you in the 
political controversy of the day, and fearing, that the letter 
in question was one of the means of attempting to bring about 
an event, which all of your friends, as well as the friends of 
the country would deplore, I am much gratified with the pros- 
pect of having it in my power to arrest, in this particular, such 
pernicious efforts, and of doing justice to your conduct in 
connection with a most critical and important juncture of your 
affairs. 

I have received your letter of the 16 th Ins fc for which I am 
obliged to you. I will not take any step, till I have viewed 
the whole ground, to put down the charge of ingrattitude, 
which they will enable me effectually to do. 



To James Monroe. 2 

Washington 3 d Jan y 1828 

DEAR SIR, I have received your letters with the enclosed 
correspondence, which I find agrees with the list of letters 
attached, and which obviously forms a chain, that contains 
the whole correspondence on the occasion. 1 have again 
perused the whole with care, and see nothing, that will not 
do honor to your sagacity and patriotism. ~.y 

It will be some time before I can receive the copy of the 
letter in question, and of course before it will be fully in my 
power to act with effect in this affair, but I do not doubt that 
it is the letter of the 9 th Sep r and that when the whole comes 
to be understood, so far from the mischief intended being 
effected, it will end in bringing more fully to light, those 
traits of character, for which your friends have always so 
much esteemed you. 

A sense of delicacy for the [present?] prevents me from stat- 
ing my conjecture of the use which it was intended to make of 
the letter, or the quarter from which the intended blow was

aimed. I hope finally to be able to trace the whole affair, but 
I am strongly inclined to think it was intended to fall on both 
of us. 

I am much obliged to you for the liberty to take copies, 
but as I am much engaged, and as the originals may be more 
satisfactory, if you have no objection, I would prefer to retain 
them, till I receive the copy which I expect. They are care- 
fully locked up with my private correspondence. Those that 
you intended for my own perusal, shall be seen by no one but 
myself. 

I am happy to hear by Col Hayne and M r England that you 
and M rs Monroe are in good health. They were both much 
gratified with the visit. 

Make my best respects to M rs M. and to M r and M rs Hay. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 23 d Jan y 1828 

DEAR JAMES, Since my arrival here at the commencement 
of the Session, I forward[edj through the Navy Department a 
letter from your brother to you, which I hope you have received, 
and within the last ten days, I received yours enclosing one to 
him, which I immediately transmitted by mail. 

Your brother I presume keeps you well advised in relation 
to all of your private concerns, which supercedes the necessity 
of my refering to them. We are much pleased, that }^ou 
directed the erection of a building for your residence at Mid- 
way, and hope, that we may have much of your company the 
next two, or three years. Shortly before I commenced my 
journey for this place, I received your long and highly inter- 
esting letter of the 25 th July. Without intending a compli- 
ment, Your. reflections both on political subjects, and the laws 
regulating international intercourse, indicate much strength 
and accuracy of thought; and a power, which if directed to 
publick affairs, could not fail to place you high among those 
distinguished in that line. You need not fear, that such let- 
ters, be they ever so long, will prove tedious. 

I wrote you very fully during the course of the summer, 
which, I trust, you have received, and which will give you the

domestick occurrences to its date. Since then few have 
occurred. We have all enjoyed almost uninterrupted health. 
Our provision crops proved abundant; but Our cotton crop 
was cut off about a third by uncommonly severe weather in 
October, which continued almost a month. It has been fol- 
lowed by the most remarkable season ever known in our 
country. Every where it has been remarkably mild, but 
while the season has been delightful South of the latitude of 
Norfolk, with a clear Sky and genial warmth, north of that, 
quite to the lakes, has been inveloped from the 29 th Nov r till 
the last four days in thick mist, and clouds with the exception 
of about 5 days of partial sunshine. During the whole time 
but little rain fell on this side of the mountains, while on the 
other it has fell in torrents. South of Norfolk, December 
and January have had all of the features of spring. In the 
Charleston market peas, string beans, tomatoes have been so 
abundant as to sell at the usual price at the proper season. It 
is now cold, and this scene of vernal aspect has doubtless 
been suddenly converted into all of the gloom of winter. I 
fear that we shall pay dearly next spring, and summer for 
this premature enjoyment of those seasons. 

I am here without my family. The inconvenience of bring- 
ing a large family so far is so great as to deter your sister 
from the undertaking. Andrew is still at home, going to a 
very good academy in the Village. He is much grown. Anna 
Maria is at Edgefield, at an excellent institution. She stays 
with M r Simkins' family. Her capacity for learning is 
excellent. The rest of the children are with their mother, all 
in excellent health, and much grown. 

I have in the last few days made a conditional sale of Oakly 
for $8000, subject to the ratification of your mother, which I 
hope she will confirm. The property is going to waste, with, 
I think, no prospect of a rise, and the interest on the sum 
exceeds the rent. It will free her from all of her engage- 
ments and leave her $2000, or 3000 of disposable funds. 

Turning from the domestick to the political world, consid- 
erable events have occurred both at home and abroad since 
my last. Of the latter the attack by the allied fleets on the 
Turkish at Navarino, is much the most important. It is yet 
uncertain, what may result from it. If the Turks should

258 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

yield, it will end in f he quiet seperation of the Islands and 
the Morea from their power, and placing them virtually under 
the control of England. But should they on the contrary 
resist, it must end in their expulsion from Europe and Africa 
and a partition of her possessions in those quarters between 
the Allied powers, of which Egypt would certainly fall to the 
English. Such a partition would put a new aspect on the 
affairs of the old continent, and would lead to consequences, 
which the most segacious cannot anticipate. 

Among incidents of great importance abroad is the unex- 
pected triumph of the liberals by large majorities in the late 
election in France, which cannot fail to prove auspicious to 
the good cause every where. It must have been wholly unex- 
pected to those in power, for the Chamber was dissolved long 
before the Constitution [al] expe ration of the term of service; 
doubtless in the expectation of great increased strength on the 
Ministerial side. 

At home the current of events has set strongly against those 
in power, so much so that the issue is no longer doubtful. 
We have a majority in both houses, with a strong prospect of 
taking at least f of the electoral votes. You may calculate 
with confidence all of the Southern votes, a decided majority 
in the West, the votes of Pennsylvania, and at least 25 in New 
York for Jackson, to which may probably be added 9 in Mary- 
land, 3 in Delaware 7 in New Jersey, 8 in New Hampshire, 
and 3 or 4: in Maine. In fact I would not be surprised, if M r 
Adams should loose as many in New England, as should gain 
out of it. Such is the force of truth, and principle against 
power, and patronage. 

The course of events has been no less propitious to me indi- 
vidually. I had great and peculiar difficulties to contend with 
which required much prudence to surmount. Seeing clearly 
during the election the violation of great, and fundamental 
principles, I did not hesitate, at that early period, to avow my 
decided disapprobation, which had the effect of marking me 
out, not for conciliation, but as a victim to be sacrificed at all 
events. The enemy had many advantages. They were in 
power; and organized, while on our side their was no open 
resisting force to sustain me, but on the contrary, large Masses 
who where disposed to take a stand against the administration 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 259 

were decidedly hostile to me, either from envy, or causes con- 
nected with the late Presidential election. Of one or the other, 
were nearly all of the friends of M r Crawford, who formed a 
powerful and well organized party, the friends of M r Clinton, 
and no small portion of the friends of Jackson themselves, who 
supporting him against me before the late election, had still left 
the feelings of hostility growing out of that relation. Thus 
enforced, the attacks of the enemy on me, while yet Jackson, 
and his part} 7 were unassailed, were regarded with secret ap- 
probation by this large mass of our own party, while there 
was the utmost industry exercised to give them the widest 
circulation, through all of the administration prints; and 
they appeared to have great effect, as many who had been 
my friends, but had gone with M r Adams after I withdrew 
from the Presidential canvass, seized on them, as a pretex for 
their desertion, and assaults on me. It is not surprizing, that 
in this state of things, that the aspiring on our side, began to 
think my overthrow certain, and that movements should be 
put on foot to supplant me in the V. Pre y . I saw the whole; 
and at the same time saw, that I must rely on time and truth 
for the remedy, which I did with entire confidence. Nor has 
the remedy failed. It has restored me not only to iny original 
strength, but has confered greater than I ever heretofore 
possessed. The intrigue about the V. Presidency has entirely 
yielded to the force of the current in my favour. Already 
have I been nominated unanimously not only by Pensyl a , 
New Jersey, Ohio, Kentucky, but I have had what I consider 
the greatest triumph, 1 a nomination in Virginia, having on 
question and opposition received in the Convention there 164 
votes out of 188, which leaves no doubt of my success. This 
is the more flattering as an effort was made in the very last 
stage to defeat me by the friends of M r Crawford in Georgia, 
with (I do not doubt) his countenance. An attempt was made 
to nominate him in the Georgia legislature, which succeeded in 
the House, but failed in the Senate, with the hope that he 
could divert such a number of votes from me, that added to 
the votes of the administration would constitute a majority.

as furnishing strong additional testimony, that a publick man, 
who will fearless discharge his duty may with confidence rely 
on the enlightened support of the people, however formidable 
the opposition, which interest, envy and jealousy may excite 
against him. 

I herewith transmit the Message of the Pres*. at the open-

To James Monroe* 

Washington 7 th March 1828. 

DEAR SIR, The letter, that has been the subject of our cor- 
respondence, proves. to be, as we had supposed it would, the 
one of the 9 th Sep*, 1818; and I am happy to add, that the 
effect, which it was designed to be accomplished by it, has, I 
believe, been thoroughly counteracted. 

As soon as I had reasons to believe, that it had found its 
way to Gen 1 Jackson, I intimated to M 1 White and Eaton, that 
I had cause to suppose, that a letter of yours, had for some 
purpose been placed in the hand of the General, the contents 
of which he regarded in an unfriendly light, and that, if it 
was the letter of the 9 th Sep fc ., as I conjectured, the object, so 
far from being unfriendly, was peculiarly of an opposite 
character. They wrote to him immediately, but his absence 
from Washington at N. Orleans, delayed his answer till lately, 
w T hen it was received and confirmed my conjecture. I then 
placed your correspondence with the General, so far as it was 
necessary to a full understanding of the object of your letter 
of the 9 th , in their hands, accompanied with such remarks of 
my knowledge of your feelings towards him, through out the 
whole transaction, as the occasion, seemed to require. The 
perusal resulted in an entire satisfaction, on [their] pa'rt of your 
friendly motives and correct course, which they communi- 
cated without delay to Gen 1 . Jackson, and which, no doubt, 
will prove in like manner satisfactory to him.

LETTEKS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 261 

How the letter was taken out of my possession, I cannot 
conjecture; nor do I know the persons through whose hands 
it passed, from the one who took it to him who transmitted it 
to the Gen 1 , with the exception of the latter, and the one from 
whom he received it. It is probable, that their names may 
all be ascertained, and if they should be, I do not in the least 
doubt, but that it will appear, that the letter was relied on, as 
a part of that system of means, which has been resorted to in 
order to cause a rupture between you and him, without regard 
to the feelings and character of either of you, and soly for 
political purpose. Who ever may be the [secret] agents, or 
movers, I have reason to believe, that, in order to give Gen 1 . 
Jackson's attention a wrong direction, as to your motives in 
writing the letter of the 9 th Sep*., there has been made to 
him, through anonymous communications, and other channels, 
false statements, of what passed in the Cabinet deliberation 
on the Seminole question, calculated to make the impression 
on him, that your object, and that of part of your Cabinet, 
was to sacrifice him on the occasion, but that it was prevented 
by the residue of the members. These are not mere conjec- 
tures, tho' I have not such information, as will enable me to 
speak with confidence. It is easy to see, if a rupture could 
be brought about, that the effect would be to place yourself 
and Gen 1 . Jackson, with those who have a mutual friendship 
for you both, in a most delicate situation, while there are 
others, who could not fail in the present state of things to 
profit by the occurrence. I feel assured, that you will not at- 
tribute these suggestions to a desire to excite your suspicions 
against any one, but to the true motive, that of placing you 
on your guard against schemes, which have been formed by 
some, of enlisting you, if possible, in the present controversy, 
for their awn purpose, and without regard to the effect, which 
it may have on your tranquility or standing with the nation. 

I herewith return the papers, but without taking copies, as 
you kindty permitted, and of which I would have availed my- 
self had not my engagements and aversion to writing prevented. 

I am happy to hear of your good health, and that M rs Mon- 
roe is better, to whom, with the rest of your family, I beg 
you to present my kindest respects.

To James Monroe. 1 

Washington [April 1828]. 

DEAR SIR A few days since, I received the enclosed letters 
from Maj 1 '. Lee, in forwarding one of which, 1 only comply 
with his request. I know not why he should forward the one 
to you under cover to me, but it affords a sufficient reason 
why I should submit for your consideration, and advice the 
draft of the answer, which I propose to make to him, and 
which you will find enclosed. You will please to return it 
after you have perused it. I would be gratified with your 
advice, as to the correctness of the course, which it proposes. 

It stricks me, that I cannot with propriety discuss the sub- 
ject of the orders with Maj r . Lee, tho I would have no objec- 
tion to enter fully into it in a correspondence with General 
Jackson, and to make known my opinion in the most explicit 
manner, as to the true construction of his orders in the Sem- 
inole campaign, which I believe corresponds with your own 
in every particular. 

What course you ought to adopt in relation to the MajVs 
letter, I will not venture to make a suggestion. Your own 
good sense will be a sufficient guide. It may not however, be 
improper to state, as probably connected with the subject of 
his letter, that there is a rumour in circulation at Nash Ville 
that you are preparing to publish a narrative of the parts 
of your administration connected with the Seminole affair. 
Having had no intimation from you, that such was the fact, I 
take it for granted, it is one of the many means, which have 
been resorted to in order to excite suspicions on the part of 
the General, and I fear with some success. He has been put 
on his guard, and I trust his good sense, and correct feelings, 
when not under excitement, will lead him to correct views, as 
to the arts of those, who expect to profit by alienating him 
from those who have given the strongest proof of friendship 
for him. 

I have read the pamplet 2 which you enclosed in your last 

1 From the Monroe Papers, Department of State; text from an official copy. Major 
Henry Lee wrote to Monroe, March 30, stating that he was about to write a life of Jack- 
son, and asked Monroe whether Jackson disobeyed orders in the Seminole war. Monroe 
replied, April 23. See post, May 1.

with attention. I never doubted, but that your claims were 
well founded. You have certainly suffered much in a pecu- 
niary point of view by your publick services. 



To James Monroe.^ 

Washington 1 st May 1828 

DEAR SIR, I received your letter of the 23 d April, having 
under cover your letter to Maj r . Lee, which I sealed and for- 
warded to him. 2 I entirely approve of your course and con- 
cur in the views, which you take of the orders, under which 
the Seminole affair was conducted. Having kept back noth- 
ing from Judge White, as a mutual friend of all the parties, 
I placed your letter to Maj r . Lee in his hand, and am happy to 
add, that he approved of the course which you have adopted. 
He pronounced your letter frank and manly, without, how- 
ever, entering into the question of the construction of the 
orders. On full reflection, and after consulting with the 
Judge, I sent the answer to Maj r . Lee, of which I sent you 
the draft; and enclosed a copy with a copy of the MajVs letter 
to me to Gen 1 . Jackson, in a letter to him, in which I stated 
that I had not the least objection to enter into a full statement 
of my views of the orders in a correspondence with him, if 
farther information be desired by him, as to the construction 
put on them by the Executive. 

Through out the whole of this affair, I have felt the great- 
est solicitude, that the arts which have been adopted to cause 
a rupture between yourself and Gen 1 Jackson, should not suc- 
ceed. Reasons of patriotism, as well as mutual friendship, 
have actuated me. I certainly do not intend to flatter, but I 
have never met with any distinguished publick man in whose 
love of country, and attachment to honor and virtue, I have 
greater confidence, and I would be distressed to see them, to 
whom the country owe so much, brought into collision before 
the publick by the arts of designing men, who may hope to 
profit by such an occurrence, 

1 From the Monroe Papers, Department of State; text from an official copy. 

- Monroe wrote, that Jackson's course had not been authorized by orders, but that the 
administration had defended him, and that he, Monroe, hoped Lee would adopt Jack- 
son's views and explanations.

I am very sorry, that it will not be in my power to make

ward. Make my kindest respects to M rs Monroe. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 4 th May 1828 

DEAR JAMES, Within the last few days, I received the box 
of seeds, for which I am much obliged to you and your letter 
enclosing one to John, announcing your intention of making 
the Tour of Europe. Since 'receiving it, 1 called on the Sec- 
retary of the Navy, to ascertain whether any supernumerary 
officers are about to be ordered on your station, and at what 
time. I learn that it is the intention of the Dep*. to send 
additional officers, but that no certain opportunity offers at 
present, and that there will probably be a delay of a month or 
two before any will sail. 

I will comply with your request about the letters of intro- 
duction by enclosing them to M r Brown our Minister at 
Paris, with a particular request to him to procure such addi- 
tional letters as you may desire, which I have no doubt he 
will cheerfully do. 

It is not my wish to dissuade you from a tour, which }^ou 
have so much at heart, and on which you have made up your 
determination, but I would be wanting in friendship, were I 
not to state for vour information, to be acted on or not at 
your discretion, that the period, however propitious in other 
respects, is highly unfavourable in a money point of view. 
Never was there such universal, and severe pressure on the 
whole South excepting the portion, which plants sugar. Our 
staples hardly return the expense of cultivation, and land and 
negroes have fallen to the lowest price, and can scarcely be 
sold at the present depressed rates. I feel confident, that 
there is no prospect of collecting what is due to you, and that 
your place has not much more than cleared expense since you 
left there, and that much difficulty will be experienced to meet 
your drafts to the amount, which you state. I would cheer- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 265 

fully aid, as it would afford me great pleasure to assist you, 
but my means have been exhausted by low prices and the 
expense of building. As far as your pay may go, I will 
obtain from the Secretary authority for you to draw what 
may [be] due you for pay in Europe, in aid of your other 
resources, and will, if in my power, render assistance in 
raising funds for you should you continue in your determina- 
tion to go. 

I wrote you very fully since the commencement of the ses- 
sion, and gave you all of the news publick and private. Since 
then but little has occurred. The defeat of the administra- 
tion has become more certain. It in fact admits no doubt, 
unless some event should occur, which no one can anticipate. 

I had a letter from your brother this morning. All were 
well except Martha who was suffering from inflamation of the 
eyes. 

I have been detained here longer than I expected by the 
procrastination of the adjournment, mainly by means of the 
Tariff question. 1 It has passed the House, and is now before 
the Senate. Its fate is doubtful. We will know in a few 
days, as we take it up tomorrow. It excites much feelings 
particularly in the South, and well it may, for I feel confident 
that it is one of the great instruments of our impoverishment; 
and if persisted in must reduce us to poverty, or compel us to 
an entire change of industry. You can form no idea how 
much it has alienated that portion of the country. The most 
thinking men look on the present unequal action of the sys- 
tem with the deepest anxiety. 

1 am accordingly anxious to return to Carolina, and will set 
out so soon as the Tariff Bill is disposed of, which I hope will 
be in the course of a week. 

I regret that you have discontinued your political informa- 
tion, which I read with interest and advantage, and hope you 
will resume them, particularly when in Europe. Write me 
fully and often, and do not fear, that your letters will be too 
long to be welcome.

266 AMEEICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

To James Monroe. l 

Pendleton 10 th July 1828 

DEAR SIR, I have received a letter from Gen 1 . Jackson, in 
which he makes the following remarks; " I have before stated 
that Maj r . Lee has shown me yours, and M r Monroe's letters 
to him, and appears to have a desire to enter into a correspond- 
ence with you both on the subject of those orders. Should it 
meet your wishes, I can have no objection, or if M r Monroe 
requests it every private and confidential letter that ever 
passed between us shall be cheerfully laid before the nation. 
As M r Monroe has referred the Maj r . to this correspondence, 
if convenient I will thank you to communicate to him my 
feelings on the subject, but without his request I shall not 
expose this correspondence to Maj r . Lee or any one else." 

I presume the General requested me to communicate his 
feelings to you on the supposition, that I would receive his 
letter before 1 left Washington, which, however, was not the 
fact; and I now make it because it [is] his desire and because it 
seems to me proper that you should know it. 

You will see by the papers, that the Tariff excites much 
feelings in this and the other Southern States. There is 
almost universal embarrassment among the people of the 
staple States, which they almost unanimously attribute to the 
high duties. It is not surprizing, that under this impression, 
they should exhibit some excess of feelings, but 1 feel confi- 
dent, that the attachment to the Union remains unshaken with 
the great body of our citizens. Yet it cannot be disguised, 
that the system pushed to the present extreme acts most un- 
equally in its pressure on the several parts, which has of 
necessity a most pernicious tendency on the feelings of the 
oppressed portions. 1 greatly fear, that the weak part of 
our system will be found to consist in the fact that in a country 
of such vast extent and diversity of interest, many of the laws 
will be found to act very unequally, arid that some portions of 
the country may be enriched by legislation at the expense 
of others. It seems to me that we have no other check 
against abuses, but such as grow out of responsibility, or 
elections, and while this is an effectual check, where the law

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 267 

acts equally on all, it is none in the case of the unequal action 
to which I refer. One thing seems to me certain, that the 
system is getting wrong and if a speedy and effective remedy 
1)0 not applied a shock at no long interval may be expected. 

I take it for granted, that you contrive to mark the course 
of events, and are not ignorant of the danger, which threatens. 
It is always dangerous, I conceive, to see the country divided, 
as it is, by sections, and almost unanimously, in relation to 
evory great measure, particularly when it may be supposed 
to originate in the spirit of gain on one side, at the expense 
of the other. It seems to me to render doubtful the beauti- 
ful idea, which you cherished so fondly, that our system might 
under its natural action sustain itself without exciting party 
feelings. If laws acted uniformly such it seems to me might 
be the fact, but where the same law tho' couched in general 
terms may advance the interest of a majority, by sacrificing 
that of a large minority, it seems to me, that without some 
remedy the most dangerous and implacable parties must 
result. Such I fear is the danger to which we are exposed. l 

I hope you had a pleasant tour and that you found M r 
(rouverneur ' and your daughter and family well in New 
York. 

My family are well, and M rs Calhoun desires her best 
rospects to you and M rs Monroe, and to M r and M rs Hay and 
their daughter. 



To Theodore Lyman. z 

Pendleton 8 th Sep r 1828 

DEAR SIR: I have been favoured with your kind letter of 
tho 11 th August and have seized on the first leisure to comply 
with your request. I was born in Abbeville District (or 
County) in this state, and received my academick education 

1 See Monroe's letter of Feb. 16, 1830, printed in Oilman's Monroe, p. 208. Calhoun

under D r . Moses Waddel, now President of the University of 
Georgia. My collegiate education was received at Yale Col- 
lege, and my legal at Litchfield under Judge Reeves. The 
year I was admitted to the bar, I was elected a member of our 
state legislature, where I served two sessions, when I was 
elected a member of Congress. I took my seat in that body 
in the session of 1811-12 known as the session which declared 
the late war against Great Britain. From that to the present 
day, I have been in the service of the nation without inter- 
ruption. 

I do not intend to enter into a consideration of my motives 
and acts, while in the publick employment. Your letter does 
not request it, and I feel no disposition to do so; but I trust, 
that I may be permitted to remark that two objects have 
incessantly occupied my attention; to preserve the Repub- 
lican principles of our government in their purity and to rear 
up by all the means delegated by the constitution, and which 
could be exercised consistently with the first and what I con- 
sider the controlling object our country, to the highest point 
of prosperity and honor. In any situation and in any act, I 
am willing that my whole life should be tested by these objects. 
They have controlled me throughout, without bias in favour of 
any local, or partial interest, or regard to personal advance- 
ment. I rejoice to hear, that our party, tho small, are firm 
and active in old Mass ts I would feel but little interest in this 
great contest were it really a struggle between M r Adams and 
Gen 1 . Jackson simply, without involving, what I deem, vital 
principles in our system; but regarding it, as I do, as a 
struggle, which involves the purity and duration of our sys- 
tem, I look on its progress with that deep interest, which, not 
to feel with my conception of its character, would be criminal. 
1 felt kindly disposed before the election towards both Gen 1 . 
Jackson and M r Adams. I thought they placed their election 
on fair national grounds. I had a right to calculate on the 
friendship of both, and, as far as personal ambition could have 
influence, the position of M r Adams was more favourable to 
me, than that of the General. I had then my reason to deplore 
his course, whatever may have been his motives for adopting 
it. I did think, that considering the friendly relation between 
him and Gen 1 . Jackson, seeing that he could not succeed with- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 269 

out forming- a coalition with one, who stood in so different a 
relation, a coalition forming a most dangerous precedent, and 
which must in its consequences distract the country for years, 
he ought to have yieldfed] to his more powerful rival, and re- 
mained in his place with the almost certain prospect of reach- 
ing the high station, which he now occupies, in a manner 
honorable to himself, and useful to the nation. He thought 
otherwise, and the consequences are such as we see. I wish 
you success in the new paper. The talent, and energy of 
Boston are sufficient to give a mighty influence to the press. 
My political reflections you will of course understand are for 
yourself. 



To Patrick Noble. 1 

Washington 10 th Jan y 1829 

MY DEAR PATRICK, Your letter of the 20 th Dec r , which gave 
us the gratifying intelligence that you were all well and that 
the children were perfectly contented 2 , was received in the 
due course of the mail. 

With the exception of a slight indisposition of James for 
the last few days, but from which he is pretty well recovered, 
we have all been well since we left you. We found our jour- 
ney much more pleasant than what we anticipated from the 
lateness of the season, both as it regarded the road, and the 
Aveather. 

We have a dead calm in politicks, which will continue till 
after the arrival of the President elect. There has been much 
idle speculation, in relation to the formation of the new cabi- 
net, It is a subject on which Genl. Jackson himself, I take 
for granted, has not made up his mind, nor will he, if he acts 
prudently, till he has had an opportunity of seeing the whole 
ground. 

In relation to the tariff, I think there is a lowering of tone 
on the part of the Tariff states, and I am not altogether with-

out hope, if Gen 1 . Jackson takes a correct general view of his 
position, and places an able sound man at the head of the 
Treasury Department, but that something like justice may be 
done to us, provided we can prevent the distribution of the 
surplus funds among the States, and thereby compel a review 
of the Tariff in reference to the discharge of the debt, which 
ought to be done at the next session. At all events our fate 
will soon be known as far as the General Government is con- 
cerned. The next 2 or 3 years will be of the deepest interest 
to us, and the whole Union. I look forward to the course 
that events will take with no small concern. To preserve our 
Union on the fair basis of equality,, on which alone it can 
stand, and to transmit the blessing of liberty to the remotest 
posterity is the first great object of all my exertions. 

Remember us most affectionately to Elizabeth, 1 and JVliss 
Bonneau, if she is with you. Tell the children how much 
gratified we are to learn that they are so contented and doing 
so well. 



To Christopher Van Deventer.* 

Washington 20 th March 1830 

DEAR MAJ F . Should the bills to which you allude become 
laws, your friends here will not be unmindful of your claims, 
but my impression, at present, is that they will not pass this 
Session. Your case is one of great hardship, in any point of 
view, and think [it] must be so felt by any one acquainted 
with the circumstances. I do not doubt the kind feelings of 
M r Ingham 3 and would advise you to keep up your corre- 
spondence with him by writing to him occasionally. If an 
opportunity should offer, I feel confident he would take pleas- 
ure in serving you. 

I have not a copy of Gen 1 . Hay ne's, or M r . Webster's speech * 
or I would send you one. I send you a copy of M r Grundy 's. 
The debate is suspended, but far from being ended. Several 
other able speakers will take the floor, when it again comes up.

Annie Bonneau was a relative of Mrs. J. C. Calhoun.

There is not the least foundation for the report, that I have 
come out against the bank. I have not moved on it at all, 
either for or against, as I deem the agitation of the question 
any way premature. It will be time enough to discuss it four 
years hence, when we will have full knowledge of the opera- 
tion of the institution, and will be able to determine, what the 
publick interest may demand with a full understanding of all 
of the circumstances. 1 regret, that the subject has been so 
prematurely brought forward. Every sentiment I ever 
expressed in relation to the bank, remains unchanged; but it 
would indicate, but little wisdom to determine a question, 
which may be greatly influenced by circumstances at the time, 
so long before they have occurred, or can be known. 

On the other point of your enquiry, I think there is nothing 
certain; but you must consider my opinion on this, and all 
other political subjects sole[l]y for your own use. 

1 cannot see that the gentleman to whom you refer, and 
whose friends are so busy in your quarter, has any solid 
strength. He is certainly considered very weak here. These 
are not times that petty arts can succeed. Too many ques- 
tions are pressing on us of deep and vital interest for such 
means of influence. I have ever held them in contempt, and 
never more than now. Make my kind respects to M rs V. and 
your family.

Confidential Washington 30 th March 1830 

MY DEAR SIR, I see from your letter you understand thor- 
oughly the game, which is playing in a certain quarter. Had 
you been here all winter, you could not have described it more 
accurately. It is, however, not calculated to do those engaged 
in it any service. I am surprised, that one so artful, as the 
author, and who occupies so favorable a position for his oper- 
ations, should so completely fail. His strength, which was 
never great, has been steadily declining all the session, and 
he may now be pronounced feeble. I see no cause to fear

him, unless of enfeebling the administration by his devious 
course. To prevent such a result, has been an object of solici- 
tude on the part of my friends. So far from opposing, we 
may appeal with confidence to the proceedings of both houses 
to prove, that our support has been more uniform and effect- 
ive, than any other portion of Congress. It is an object of 
ambition with us to carry the General through with glory; 
and while we see with pain every false move, we have never 
permitted our feelings to be alienated for a moment. Our's 
is the position of honest and sincere friendship, and for us a 
perfect contrast to that pursued, in the quarter to which I 
allude. 

The accusation, that the delay and difficulty in the Senate 
have been owing to my friends is utterly false, as the Jour- 
nals will prove. In truth, the whole subject of nominations 
has been on our part in the Senate with great judgment. Not 
a day has been unnecessarily lost. We had great difficulties 
to contend with, and could not have taken a different course 
with equal success. 

I was much gratified with the confirmation of Swartout's 
nomination. 1 I had great fears at one time, but he was finally 
carried through with honor, and I feel confident that he will 
not disappoint the expectations of his friends. I take interest 
in Mr. Noah's success, and hope sincerely that he may pass. 
His nomination will not be acted on for some time. He will 
not lack active friends in the Senate.

Washington 12 th May 1830 
DEAR SIR, I received your letter of the 5 th Inst yesterday. 

I expect to set out some day next week for the South, but it

when Congress will adjourn. 

My true position is to do my duty without committing 

myself, or assuming unnecessary responsibility, where I have

no control. The times are perilous beyond any that I have 
ever witnessed. All of the great interests of the country are 
coming into conflict, and I must say, and with deep regret I 
speak it, that those to whom the vessel of state is entrusted 
seem either ignorant, or indifferent about the danger. My 
great ambition is to see our country free united and happy, 
and placed where I am, I owe it as a duty to myself and 
country to preserve unimpaired the publick confidence. 
Thus acting, the first step is to postpone all questions as to 
myself, till it becomes necessary to decide, and the one to 
which you refer among others; when the time comes, it will 
present a grave question, to be decided wisely only by weigh- 
ing fully the considerations for and against. 

I consider it as perfectly uncertain, whether Gen 1 . Jackson 
will offer again or not. Some who regard their own interest 
more than his just fame are urging him to offer, but it will 
be difficult to reconcile the course to his previous declarations, 
unless there should be the strongest considerations of the 
publick good to justify him. 

I have no copy of M r M c Duffies report; but will request 
him to send 3 r ou one, if he has one to spare, with a copy of 
his Speech on Mallory's bill.

Washington 26 th May 1830 

DEAR SIR, I have just had a full conversation with M r Wirt, 
on the subject, on which I conversed with you, when I was at 
Oak Hill. His memory is distinct, that the letter of the 6 th 
Jan: 1818 was not before the Cabinet, nor was it alluded to 
during the deliberation. In fact, he is of the opinion, that he 
never saw it till now, as he had not the least recollection of 
the letter. He feels some delicacy in speaking to M r Adams

of this and several subsequent letters.

and M r Crownins[hiel]d l on the subject, and suggests, that it 
would probably be the best course for you, as the head of the 
administration at the time, and more particularly interested 
on this point, to address them on the subject, of the letter. 
The only difficulty, which I have in addressing them myself, 
is on account of the political relation, which they bear to the 
present administration. I feel so confident of the fact, that 
the letter was not before the Cabinet, that I would not hesitate 
to assert the fact directly in my letter to Gen 1 . Jackson, sup- 
ported by your recollection and M r Wirt's, but it would cer- 
tainly be more prudent, to ascertain whether their memory 
accords with ours. Should you think, the course indicated 
by M r Wirt is the correct one, I would suggest in order to 
save time, as I am anxious to leave this, that you should state 
in your letter to M r . Adams and M r Crowninshield, that the 
bearer would receive their answers, and to direct him to 
deliver them to M r Ringgold with authority on his part to 
open them. I send you a copy of the letter in question, as it 
may enable you to shape your letter to those gentlemen, should 
you think proper to write to them. I send a copy instead of 
the original to avoid the hazard of sending it. 

I would not be surprised, if M r Adams and M r Crownin- 
shield should both be ignorant of the existence of the letter, 
as M r Wirt was. I will, thank you to return the copy.

DEAK SIR, I enclose a letter and packet, which I received 
by the last mail for you; and also several news papers con- 
taining accounts of the last intelligence from France. You 
will see that the Revolution advances with the same admirable 
skill and promptness, which characterised its first movements. 
I hope all will settle down in a firm and stable state, but I 
cannot but fear, that Europe is on the eve of a great convul- 
sion. The sperit of the revolution must spread from France 
to the adjacent countries, which must rouse to madness and

dispair the already deeply excited jealousy of the crowned 
heads of Europe. There is much in the wheel of time. . . . 



To James j. 

Washington 11 th Jan y 1831 

DEAR SIR, It is with great pain, that I feel myself again 
compelled to intrude on your retirement, particularly on a sub- 
ject, which must be so disagreeable to you, as one involving 
a difference between two of the members of your administra- 
tion, in relation to one of the most important questions, which 
occupied the deliberation of the Cabinet, during the period of 
your presidency. 

My call on you in the first instance was made with great 
reluctance, and, I did hope, that no subsequent occurrence 
would render it necessary to make an additional call. It was 
my earnest desire, that you should be involved in the contro- 
versy, as little as possible, for which reason my former call was 
limited to the points, whether the letter from Gen 1 . Jackson 
to you in which reference was made to John Ray 2 was shown 
to any person except myself, and whether it was before the 
Cabinet during its deliberation; nor would I have requested 
your statement on these points, if I could have avoided it, 
with justice to myself. 

I learn from a letter of M r Crawford addressed to me, that 
he has written to you on the subject of the deliberation of 
the Cabinet on the Seminole affair; and, tho he has not fur- 
nished me with a copy of his letter to you, nor a copy of your 
answer, I infer from his comments on the extracts from your 
answer, that he has entirely misconstrued my motives in limit- 
ing my former call on you. That you may see the construc- 
tion, which he has placed on my motives, and the view, which 
he has taken of your answer, I herewith enclose extracts of 
so much of his letter as relates to yourself, leaving it to you 
to furnish me whatever correction of his errors you may judge 
necessary. You know, that so far from a' desire to extract a 
partial answer from you, as he insinuates, by presenting a

276 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

partial view of the case, that I placed you in full possession 
of all of the facts, by putting in your hand, the copy of M r 
Crawford's letter to M r Forsyth, with General Jackson's letter 
transmitting it to me. 

In conclusion, I take the liberty of asking for a copy of M r 
Crawford's letter to you with a copy of your answer, as they 
may be necessary to a full understanding of this unpleasant 
subject. I make the request on the presumption that they 
may be furnished without impropriety, as I take it for 
granted, that they can contain nothing, which would render 
it improper, that they should be communicated to me. 



To James Monroe.^ 

Private Washington 11 th Jan y 1831. 

DEAR SIR, It is with unfeigned regret, that I am again 
constrained to trouble you on any subject that relates to 
myself; but, I hope, that you will find a sufficient apology for 
this intrusion on your retirement in the cause, which compels 
me to it. 

You will see in the extracts of the letter from M r Crawford 
to me, which accompany this, the very perverted view which 
he takes of my former application to you and also of your 
answer to his letter. Instead of attributing the limitations 
in my former application to the true cause, a delicate regard 
to your situation, he represents it as a mere artifice to extract 
from you a partial and deceptive reply; and to give a colour- 
ing to his insinuations, speaks of the excitement, which my 
course in the Cabinet caused on your part, which you will 
know you never exhibited, and, I may confidently add never 
felt. The whole discussion was in fact marked with great 
calmness and deliberation. You will see also b}^ his com- 
ments that he represents you as resting your recollection 
whether the confidential letter from Gen 1 Jackson to you was, 
or was not before the Cabinet wholly on that of M r Wirt's 
very contrary to what I understand from your statement to 
me. I forbear to make additional remarks on his comments, 
as I am sure the false colouring which he attempted to give 
to your statement, and my course will not escape you. 

1 From the Monroe Papers, Department of State; text from an official copy. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 277 

I declined entering into a correspondence with M r Craw- 
ford except through Gen 1 Jackson. He has not made his 
communication through that channel yet, and as considerable 
time has since elapsed I presume he has declined correspond- 
ing through the General. Under these circumstances, it will 
probably be unnecessary to use the corrections which you 
may make of his misconceptions, yet I still deem it proper to 
be in possession of them, as I am desirous in all possible 
events, that the facts and circumstances connected with my 
course in this unpleasant affair should stand in their true 
light. 

You will see, that very perverted statements of the corre- 
spondence between the President and myself have appeared in 
the publick prints. 1 am not responsible in the slightest 
degree for their appearance. 1 have through out exercised 
great forbearance, and intend to continue to do so, and will 
not come before the publick unless I am compelled in self 
defence, tho' 1 feel assured should I be compelled, that the 
correspondence will place me on high ground before the 
publick. 

I hope your health has improved by a change of residence, 
tho I fear that you may find a New York winter too severe 
for you. 

I, with your other friends here, take much interest in the 
success of your claim. I cannot write encouragingly, tho' I 
hope that justice will yet be done you. 1 

I am obliged to you for M r Gouverneur's address, which I 
have read with much interest. 



[Extracts from M r Crawford's letter to me relating to'M r Monroe.] 

The omission to appeal to M' Monroe, whether you made the proposi- 
tion ascribed to you in my letter to M r Forsyth is strong presumptive 
evidence that you believed his answer would confirm my statement. You 
remembered the excitement, which your proposition and pleadings pro- 
duced in the mind of the President and did not dare to ask him any ques- 
tion tending to revive his recollection of that proposition. The different 
manner in which you approached the President and M r Wirt even on the 
collateral secondary fact, upon which you do venture to interrogate them, 

i Congress at this session made a grant to Monroe in settlement of his claims. 



278 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

proceeds from the same fact, that made you avoid interrogating them on 
the principal fact. When you made the enquiry of M r Wirt, you enclose 
him such an extract from my letter, as informs him of the nature of the 
evidence you are in search of, because I presume you believe that extract 
would not tend to refresh his memory, or relied implicitly upon Mr. Wirts 
disposition to give such evidence, as you desired of him. But you were 
apprehensive that the same extract if sent to M r Monroe might refresh 
his memory and enable him to give such an answer, as would not suit your 
views. The extract of my letter sent to M r Wirt described facts and cir- 
cumstances in which M r Monroe was a principal actor. It was therefore 
deemed unsafe to submit them to him. The excitement produced on the 
President was so manifest, that you did not believe it could have escaped 
the attention of M r Wirt; you therefore believed it unsafe to interrogate 
him, as to your proposition, personally affecting General Jackson. M r 
Monroe says not a word, tending to show, that the confidential letter was 
not produced and read in the Cabinet, which was not suggested by M r Wirt. 

Again 

I have said that M r Wirts negative statement is the only evidence you 
have in support of his negative assertion that the confidential letter was 
not produced and read in the Cabinet. For proof of this read the endorsed 
extract of M r Monroes letter, by which it will be seen that having no 
reliance upon his own memory, he applied to M r Wirt for information; 
and he candidly and properly adds "still as the question turns on memory 
alone, M r Wirt, as well as I, may be mistaken and in regard to me, as 1 
was sick in bed when I received the letter, that presumption is the more 
probable." 



To Miss Anna Maria Calhoim. 1 

Washington 11 th Jan y 1831 

MY DEAR MARIA, I set you the example of being a very 
punctual correspondent. Yesterday I received your letter, 
and today I answer it. 

I was much gratified to hear from you; and to learn, after 
so many arrangements, you were fixed so much to your satis- 
faction, and had recommenced your studies with so much 
sperit. 1 am not surprised, that you felt so lonesome at first. 
We are never more so, than when in the midst of those, who 
are strangers; but you acted like a philosopher, when, instead 
of giving yourself up to tears, you set about removing the 
cause, by forming the acquaintance of those around you.

LETTEKS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 279 

You must have made rapid advances in the remedy, to acquire 
the names of all. in so short a time, with the personal acquaint- 
ance of so many; but I am sure your good sense will guard 
you against the other extreme; against passing from being a 
stranger to all, to being too familiar with all. Form a general 
acquaintance with all, but be familiar with but few, well 
selected and worthy of your friendship. 

It is a little singular, that you and Miss Cuningham 1 should 
be room mates. Tho her father and myself disagree so widely 
in politicks, we are old acquaintances; I may say, I suppose 
friends, tho it may be possible, that our political difference 
may have alienated his personal attachment. It has had no 
such effect on my part. He studied law with me; and, tho I 
have no doubt he is wrong, yet I have as little, that he is 
honestly so. You of course will take care not to quarrel 
about politicks. 

I wrote to you a few days since. I hope you have got my 
letter. I enclosed to Col Chappell. I enclose this to Judge 
Martin, who has been so kind, as to promise to send to the 
post office every day before his daughter goes to school, and 
to take charge of your letters. I am glad you are so much 
pleased with his daughter. He and M rs Martin are particular 
friends, and I wish you to make his, one of the families, which 
you will take into your small visiting circle. You must make 
the circle small. You are too young to go much into com- 
pany. It would be a great interruption to your studies. 
Write me fully. Give me a minute account of all of your 
teachers, and the lessons you are taking, with the names of all 
of the girls, with whom you have formed intimate acquaintance. 



To James Edward Calhoun. 

Washington 13 th Jan y 1831 

DEAR JAMES, I had opened and thrown away the envelope 
before I perceived that the enclosed was addressed to you. 

The correspondence between the President and myself be- 
gins to excite much attention and speculation. I arrived here 

1 Robert Cuningham, a descendant of a Tory family in South Carolina, had been a 
prominent Union man in 1832 (but was a Secessionist in 1851). His daughter had a

Bench and Bar of South Carolina, II, 395-401.)

before New Years day some three, or four days, and as I did 
not attend on that occasion, it confirmed the rumours already 
in circulation of a seperation between us. M r Crawford's 
correspondence with M r Adams and M r Crowninshield placed 
the opponents of the administration in possession of the 
knowledge of the correspondence between us, and their policy 
has been to force it out. As far as I am concerned, it would 
be desirable, but as I have acted on the defensive thus far and 
intend to do so throughout, I will not publish unless it should 
become absolutely necessary. In the mean time, I permit 
whatever friend desires to read the correspondence, which 
has given a pretty general knowledge of its contents here. 
The result has been, in the opinion of all my friends, to 
strengthen me, and to weaken those who have got up the con- 
spiracy for my distraction. Every opening was made for 
me to renew my intercourse with the President, which I have 
declined, and will continue so to do, till he retracts what he 
has done. His friends are much alarmed. 

I can scarcely say any thing as to the general state of the 
politicks of the country. Things must go on, and become 
worse till the people become alarmed with the danger which 
must shortly threaten, from the deep conflict into which the 
great interests of the country must soon come. 

We are in the midest of a severe snow storm, as much so 
as I have ever seen. The deep gloom of Winter overhangs 
the face of nature, which makes me sigh for the more genial 
climate of South Carolina.

i Original lent by Mr. Edward Spann Hammond, of Blackville, S. C. His father, Gov- 
ernor and Senator James Henry Hammond (1807-1864), to whom this letter and many 
subsequent letters were addressed, was one of the ablest and most prominent statesmen 
of South Carolina, and a constant friend and political associate of Calhoun. He was a 
member of Congress from 1835 to 1836; governor from 1842 to 1844, and United States Senator 
from 1857 to 1860. He wrote many pamphlets on slavery and other subjects of interest 
to South Carolina and An Oration on the Life, Character, and Services of John Caldwell 
Calhoun, delivered on the 21st Nov. 1850, at Charleston, S. C., at the request of the city 
council. His letters to Calhoun, published in Part II of the present volume, are among 
the most important of that series. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 281 

of going over with you fully and freely the general ground 
of our politicks. Our situation is indeed critical, and it is im- 
possible for the most experienced and the wisest to form even 
a probable conjecture, as to the result. Of one thing we may 
be perfectly assured, that the General Government will not 
relax its hold, unless compelled; and that she cannot be com- 
pelled, unlesss the South should unite in one earnest and de- 
cided pressure, or some one of the States nullify the unconsti- 
tional Tariff acts. It is almost hopeless to expect a cordial 
union of the South for redress under existing circumstances. 
The position which Gen 1 . Jackson has taken of halting between 
the parties, as if it were possible to reconcile two hostile sys- 
tems, must keep us distracted and weakened during his time. 
To expect to be able to support him, taking the position he 
has, and to unite the South in zealous opposition to the sys- 
tem, which he more than half supports, is among the greatest 
absurdities. Had he placed himself on principle, and sur- 
rounded himself with the talents, virtue and experience of the 
party, his personal popularity would, beyond all doubt, have 
enabled us to restore the Constitution, arrest the progress of 
corruption, harmonize the Union, and thereby avert the 
calamity which seems to impend over us; as it is, that very 
popularity is the real source of our weakness and distraction. 
We sustain, or connive at in him, what would be abhorred in 
another. 

Believing, that an united effort of the South is hopeless dur- 
ing his time, we must next look to the action of our own State, 
as she is the only one, that can possibly put herself on her 
sovereignty. Nothing must be omitted to unite and strengthen 
her, for on her Union, and firmness, at this time, the liberty 
of the whole country in no small degree depends. To effect 
this, much will depend on you and the other gentlemen at 
the head of the press in the state. 1 I have marked } r our course 
from the beginning, and, when I say, that it has met my full 
approbation, I mean not to use the language of unmeaning 
compliment. Did not I believe, that the state was radically 
sound in feelings, and that our divisions sprang from acciden- 
tal circumstances, I would dispair; but, believing such to

be the fact, I look forward with confidence to Union, if 
we act with discretion. The great cause of division is the 
unfounded hope of relief from Gen 1 Jackson. Time must 
show how utterly hopeless all expectation of relief is from 
that quarter. Were he with us, such is the unfortunate 
composition of his Cabinet, (if Cabinet there may be said 
to be, when the members of the administration never meet 
to deliberate) such their division and weakness, that it would 
be idle to expect, he could effect anything; but when we 
know that he is opposed to us on the most vital points, 
and that he is in the hands of men, as hostile to us [as] 
Clay himself it is perfect infatuation to expect relief from 
him. Every day will prove this, and one of the leading duties 
of our editors, as it seems to me, will be to watch events and 
point out to the people how little they have to hope from the 
General Government. In the mean time, much can, and, I 
hope, will be done here by our members to bring out, in bold 
relief, all of the circumstances calculated to demonstrate our 
hopeless condition. With this view among other subjects, I 
trust, there will be a full discussion of the true nature and 
character of that most oppressive, most unjust, unconstitu- 
tional and dangerous of all projects, the distribution of the 
surplus revenue. The resolution of M r Davis will also lead 
to a very interesting discussion. The Committee will report 
in favour of a repeal of the 25 th Section of the Judiciary act, 
and, it is thought by many, the report will pass the House. 1 
However strange it may seem, there are many Zealously in 
favour of the repeal, who are violently opposed to what they 
call Nullification, as if the repeal did not comprehend, and go 
beyond Nullification. The discussion of the report on the 
repeal will doubtless strengthen our doctrines, as the occurence 
in Georgia has done. 

It is impossible to touch on all of the interesting subjects, 
which must press on us at this eventful crisis. Should any 
occurrence take place, which in my opinion would more espe- 
cially require your attention, 1 will take the liberty of drop- 

1 A resolution to this effect, by W. R. Davis of South Carolina, was introduced in the 
House December 21, 1830, favorably reported by the judiciary committee January 24, but 
rejected by the House January 29. The repeal would have prevented appeals from State 
courts to the U. S. Supreme Court. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 283 

ping you a line. Before I close, I must say something of 
myself. You have of course seen reference in the papers to 
a correspondence of not a friendly nature between Gen 1 Jack- 
son and myself. It is true, that there has been such a cor- 
respondence, and that it has ended in my declining social 
intercourse with the General, tho' I have been informed, that 
he is desirous, that it should be renewed; but it can only be 
by a full retraction on his part. The whole I believe to be a 
base political intrigue, of which the Gen 1 has been made the 
dupe. It is connected with the proceedings of the Cabinet on 
the Seminole affair, in the year 1818. I cannot in a letter go 
into particulars, but my friends may be perfectly assured, 
that those who commenced the affair are heartily sick of it, 
and that should the correspondence ever be published, it will 
place me on the most elevated ground. It has been read here 
extensively by mutual friends, and there is but one opinion 
on the subject among all who have seen, but circumstances, 
which you can well conceive will prevent me from publishing 
unless it should be absolutely necessary. 1 have written to 
you freely with full confidence in your discretion, and you 
must consider what I have written as intended for your own 
inspection only. 



Washington 21 st Jan y 1831 

DEAR SIR, A few days since, I addressed a note to M r 
Adams, requesting his statement, whether the confidential 
letter of Gen 1 Jackson to you, to which M r Crawford alludes 
in his letter to M r Forsy th, was before the Cabinet in its delib- 
erations on the Seminole question. His answer confirms your's 
and M r Wirts statements. M r Crowninshield^ has, however, 
given a contrary statement to M r Crawford, and what renders 
his statement most strange is the fact, that he was not present 
at any of the meetings. It may become necessary to place his 
absence beyond doubt, and, if my memory serves me, it is in 
your power to do so. I am of the impression, that you wrote 
to him after the deliberation and received his answer approv- 
ing the course adopted. If such be the fact, I must request

a copy of your letter and of his answer. Should you not 
have them with you, M r Gouverneur has been so obliging, as 
to offer to go to Loudon, 1 and, with your permission, to take 
copies for me. 



To James Monroe. 2 

Washington 27 th Jan y 1831 

DEAR SIR, It is with extreme regret, that I intrude on your 
retirement, but events have occurred, since the date of my 
letter to you last Spring, requesting you to state whether the 
confidential letter of Gen 1 Jackson to you, in which reference 
is made to John Rhea, was before the Cabinet during its 
deliberation on the Seminole affair, that render it necessary 
again to trouble you, on the same subject. I must therefore 
ask you to state, under what circumstances, that request was 
made, and also what was my course and manner on the occasion, 
as it related to Gen 1 Jackson. I wish you to state as fully as 
your recollection will, serve any circumstances relating to the 
affair, as far as connected with myself. 



To James Monroe. 2 

Washington 27 th Jan y 1831 

DEAR SIR, 1 am much obliged to you for your suggestions, 
as to the shape that ought to be given to my call on you. 1 
think it greatly preferable to the one, that I had adopted. My 
object is to correct the misconstructions of M r Crawford, and 
the extracts from his letter in your possession, will enable 
you, in answering my call, to shape your reply, so as to effect 
that object. 

May I ask you for an answer, as early as may suit your con- 
venience. I greatly regret to learn, that your health is so 
infirm, and sincerely hope, that the approach of warm weather 
may improve it.

LETTERS GET JOHN C. CALHOUN. 285 

To John Quincy A.darm. l 

Washington 29 th Jan y 1831. 

SIR, I deem it important, as a means of vindicating my char- 
acter against an attack on my course in the deliberations of 
the Cabinet on the Seminole affair, to obtain a statement of 
M r Crawford's course on the same occasion ; and I must, there- 
fore, request you to state, what that course was, and whether 
he did not concur with me in opinion, particularly on the 
points, that Gen 1 . Jackson had transcended his orders, in at- 
tacking S*. Marks and Pensacola, and that his conduct ought 
to have been the subject of investigation before a military 
tribunal. 

I must also request you to state, with the same object, what 
was the decleration of Mr. Crawford relative to the conduct 
of Gen 1 . Jackson in the Seminole war, when the conduct of 
Com ro . Porter, in the Foxardo affair, was under consideration 
in the cabinet of M r Monroe. 

Should you feel restrained by the confidential character of 
Cabinet proceedings from furnishing me with a statement to 
be used for my vindication, I trust you will feel no difficulty 
in furnishing me with one to be placed among my papers, in 
order to guard against contingencies, and to be used only 
under such conditions, as you may think proper to prescribe. 

I would not make this application but with views strictly 
defensive and in vindication of what I hold more sacred than 
life itself. 



To John Quincy Adai/is. 2 

Washington 3 d Feb 1831 

SIR, I have received your letter of the 31* Jan y , and will 
proceed to state the point mainly at issue between M r Craw- 
ford and myself, relative to what occurred in the deliberation 
of the Cabinet on the Seminole question, not in the least doubt- 

1 From the original in the possession of Mr. Charles Francis Adams. It will be remem- 
bered that Mr. Adams, who was now for a brief period in retirement, had been Secretary 
of State in Monroe's Cabinet from 1817 to 1825. A previous letter, January 12, with Adams's 
reply of the 14tb, may be found in the Florida pamphlet and in Calhoun's Works, VI, 
429-433. 

2 From the original in the possession of Mr. Charles Francis Adams.

ing, that you will readily give any information in your power, 
necessary to its elucidation, as far as your sense of the high 
obligation imposed on the confidential advisers of the Presi- 
dent, not to divulge the proceedings of the Cabinet, will per- 
mit. The main point at issue between M r Crawford and myself 
as to what took place in the Cabinet, turns on the question, 
whether the confidential letter of Gen 1 . Jackson to M r Monroe, 
referred to in M r Crawford's letter to M r Forsyth, was, or 
was not, before the Cabinet during its deliberation. 

In my letter to you of the 12 th January, 1 I gave an extract 
from M r Crawford's letter, relating to the confidential letter 
in question, and now add an additional extract, which with 
that already given, will put you in full possession of all that 
he says, in relation to the letter. 

Beginning where the former extract ends, M r Crawford 
says "I asked the President, if the letter" (the confidential) 
" had been answered. He replied no for that he had no recol- 
lection of having received it. I then said, I had no doubt, 
that Gen 1 . Jackson on taking Pensacola believed, that he was 
doing, what the President wished. After that letter was pro- 
duced unanswered, I should have opposed the infliction of 
punishment upon Gen 1 Jackson, who had considered the silence 
of the President, as a tacit consent; yet it was after this letter 
was produced, and read, that M r Calhoun made his proposi- 
tion to the Cabinet for punishing the General." 

You will see from the extract, that M r Crawford rests the 
justification of what he states to have been his course, as well 
as what he states evidently as a great aggravation in mine, 
on the supposed introduction of the letter in question; and 
it is appearant from Gen 1 . Jacksons letter to me, covering M r 
Crawford's letter, that such supposition had no small influ- 
ence on his mind. It, therefore, necessarily, formed a promi- 
nent point in my correspondence with the General, whether 
such a letter was, or was not, introduced. M r Crawford has 
undertaken to rebut my denial of its introduction, which ren- 
ders it important, in my vindication, to show my denial to be 
correct. With this view, I appealled to your recollection in 
my letter of the 12 th January, as I had previously done to M r 
Monroe and M r Wirts'. With the same view, and, in con- 
firmation of yours and their recollection on that point, I now

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 287 

propose to show, that M r Crawford's course in the Cabinet 
then, as well as his subsequent course and declarations, have 
not been in conformity to what he states, as the impression 
made gn him by the letter. 

It is only defensively and, even with that view, limited to 
the conduct of him, who by his attack on me has made it 
necessary, in my vindication, that I feel myself justified to 
make an appeal to the other members of the Cabinet, as to any 
circumstance connected with its proceedings, except what re- 
lates immediately to myself. 

I would respectfully suggest, whether the fact, that M r Craw- 
ford undertakes to give a statement, not only of my course, 
but also his in relation to the letter, with the view of placing 
his conduct in contrast with mine, to my disadvantage, does 
not give me a right to appeal to our associates in the Cabinet, 
as to the correctness of his statement, as it relates, as well to 
his, as my course, as one transaction, to the extent of the 
issue under consideration. 

I would also farther suggest, whether the fact, that M r Craw- 
ford does not feel himself bound to observe silence, as to the 
transactions of the Cabinet, does not in fact amount to a gen- 
eral implied assent, that the other members may state his 
course, at least, as far as it may become necessary to defend 
an associate injuriously affected by his statement. 

I make these suggestions with great deference, knowing that 
no one has more deeply reflected on the high obligations im- 
posed on the confidential advisers of the President, or is more 
capable of forming a true estimate of their extent and force. 

Should you, under all the circumstances of the case, feel 
your self justified to give me the information I request, I 
would take the liberty of modifying the questions, which 1 
proposed in my former letter, and I will thank you to substi- 
tute the following in their place. Did M r Crawford in the Cab- 
inet meeting on the Seminole question, concur in the opinion 
that Gen 1 . Jackson had transcended his orders in taking S*. 
Mark and Pensacola; and that his conduct ought to be the 
subject of investigation before a military tribunal. 

Did M r Crawford at subsequent meetings of the Cabinet, 
express himself opposed to the course of Gen 1 . Jackson in the 
Seminole War, and if so, what were his declerations on such 
occasions.

Washington 4 th Feb y 1831 

DEAR SIR, I received yesterday yours of the 1 st Feb y and 
am obliged to you for your prompt reply. I find mine to 
which your's is an answer by being too concisely expressed in 
the part that refers to my course towards Gen 1 . Jackson has 
lead you very naturally into an error, as to the information I 
desired. It was not my wish to obtain information of my 
course in relation to Gen 1 . Jackson when 1 called on you for 
a statement last Spring in Loudon, but what my course was 
in the Cabinet, when the Seminole affair was under considera- 
tion. The object of the enquiry was to rebut the insinuations 
of M r Crawford (See extracts of his letter to me which I sent 
you) who states that my course in the Cabinet towards Gen 1 . 
Jackson produced much excitement on your part. 

You will see my precise object by turning to the extracts. 

If you feel no delicacy in complying with the request I 
would be glad that you would furnish me with another state- 
ment in lieu of your last, comprehending in one that statement, 
and that I now desire. I make the request only on the ground 
that if I should omit to obtain your statement i n correction of 
M r Crawford's erroneous insinuations of the effect of my course 
in the Cabinet on you, I might be supposed to acquiesce in 
their correctness. 

I wish you to be assured that it is with great reluctance I 
trouble you.

Washington 16 th Feb y 1831 

DEAR SIR, I have been compelled very reluctantly to place 
before the publick my correspondence with Gen 1 . Jackson on 
my course in the Cabinet, on the Seminole subject. 2 A copy 
addressed to you will go in the mail, that carries this; and, I 
trust, that the manner, in which I have conducted this delicate 
correspondence on my part, will meet your entire approbation.

1 have limited my remarks on the proceedings of the Cabi- 
net strictly to my own course, and have endeavoured to meet 
the attack on me with the dignity and respect due to the sta- 
tions occupied by General Jackson and myself, but, at the 
same time, with the spirit, that became the occasion. 

I regret to say, that the publication will disclose a political 
intrigue of the basest character, and which, for the honor of 
our country, I am truty sorry to be compelled, for my vindi- 
cation, to bring to the knowledge of the world. 

I assumed the responsibility of publishing without obtaining 
your express consent, because I wished not to take any step, 
that I could possibly avoid, that might seem to impose any 
responsibility on you in this most unpleasant affair; yet fully 
acknowledging the obligation, on the members of an admin- 
istration to its chief, as well as to each other, to preserve in 
confidence the proceedings of the Cabinet, I would not have 
come before the publick, had I not supposed from the char- 
acter of the correspondence between us in relation to this affair, 
and particularly from your last letter, I had your implicit 
permission. 

Your claim is now before the Senate, and it affords me great 
pleasure to say that there is every prospect the bill will pass. 



To James H. Hammond. 1 

Washington 16 th Feb 1831 

DEAR SIR, The mail, that takes this, will bring you a copy 
of the Correspondence with Gen 1 . Jackson. It will speak for 
itself. Gen 1 . Jackson has certainly involved himself in great 
difficulty in this affair. He has, to say the least, been sadly 
duped; yet, I think, the proper course, at least at first, is to 
say little about him. Let the press direct the publick indig- 
nation against the contriver of this profligate intrigue. Who 
is the prime mover belongs rather to the publick, than to me, 
to say. One thing, however, is remarkable, that every indi- 
vidual connected with it, is the correspondent and friend of a 
certain prominent individual, who made a visit to Georgia in 
1827. The origin dates certainly from about that period, as

you will see by M r Crawford's letter to M r Balch of Nash- 
ville. l The affair, 1 hope, may open the eyes of Gen 1 Jack- 
son. It is most unfortunate for him and the country, that he 
has so greatly misplaced his confidence. Unless he should 
withdraw it, and that speedily, it is hard to anticipate the 
result. Universal discontent, distraction, and corruption 
seem to be taking possession of .the country. 

I write in great haste, and you must understand, what I 
have said, as being intended for your inspection only. 



To Samuel L. Gouverneur* 

Fort Hill 16 th April 1831 

MY DEAR SIR, The enclosed note to M r Salomon is in 
relation to some private business, about which he wrote me; 
and, as I do not wish to have my name on a letter even on 
private business, except to a particular friend, in these times 
of prying curiosity, I have taken the liberty in order to avoid 
franking the letter to place it under cover to you to be deliv- 
ered to him. 

I could not but be much gratified on my return home to 
find the publick sentiment every where on my route so much 
in my favour. I may say, that it is unanimous, with the ex- 
ception of a few dependent editors and their immediate parti- 
sans. I avoided, wherever I could, any^emonstration of the 
publick opinion in my favour. 

I had the pleasure on my arrival to find my family in good 
health. M rs Calhoun desires to be kindly remembered to you 
and M rs G. Make our best respects also to M r Monroe. I hope 
his health has improved with the advance of warm weather. 
I would be happy to hear from you.

two; to increase his influence in the Government, and to 
deminish his responsibility. The place of Inghain will be 
filled by a devoted partisan, and that of Branch by one, that 
can be controlled. Livingston is a personal and political 
friend of the Ex Secretary; and Judge White, who is exclu- 
sively attached to the President, tho intelligent and pure, is 
cautious to timidity. 1 If to these we add, Lewis, Kendal[l], 
Hey ward, Smith all men of great influence with the Presi- 
dent, and devoted to M r Van Buren, you will readily see, that 
the ex Secretary's presence is no longer necessary to his con- 
trol, tho it might increase his responsibility. 

The Southern influence will be still farther deminished in 
the new organization. This old, talented and virtuous sec- 
tion will have but one member in the Cabinet, and he the 
least influential, the attorney General; while the west will 
have the President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
war and the Post Master General. The election of Gen 1 
Jackson it is known depends on us, yet such is the calculation 
on our forbearance, that we are hardly taken into the estimate 
in the political game. I cannot say I regret it. I have long- 
known, we had 'nothing to hope from the administration, 
while our loyalty was stronger than our honor, or patriotism. 
We deserve our fate. 

As to myself, I feel but little solicitude. In the present 
state of things, I have but little ambition to administer the 
Government. I cannot support Clay, who in my opinion has 
done great mischief to the country, and I have no confidence 
in Jackson, who is too ignorant, too suspicious, and too weak 
to conduct our affairs successfully. He must fail. Loosing 
as he has done, how can he go through six years more? If 
my friends and the Republican party choose to go along with 
him, I will not object, nor will I seperate from them, but I 
will not be responsible for the consequences. It must end in 
overthrow. The course, which you and our papers generally 
take, I think the correct one. Be silent in a great measure 
as to myself, except defensively, where you think justice 
requires.it, but speak freely of men and measures, as far as 
they bear on principles, that we deem sacred. As far as I 
am concerned, I will leave events to their own direction.

I am of the impression, that our State right doctrines ought 
to be manfully supported. On their success depends the 
success of our institutions. I do not, nor have I ever

1 have not seen the Georgia Journal to which you refer. 
That a considerable portion of the old Crawford interest is 
hostile, I do not doubt, but, if I do not mistake, it has ceased 
to constitute a majority in the State. 

I regret exceedingly, that you think of retiring. I speak 
without flattery, when I say, it will be difficult to supply

To Christopher Van 

Fort Hill 25 th May 1831 

DEAR SIR, The last mail brought me yours of the 6 th Ins*. , 
which I have read with interest. 

Between Gen 1 Jackson and myself any connection personal 
and political is recinded. Hejias proved himself unworthy 
of my friendship, or support, but at the same time the man- 
ner, in which I have been sustained in the conflict with him 
by those, who support him, with the exception of the miser- 
able tools of power, has strengthened the obligation, which I 
am under to them. Even in Tennessee and in the neighbour- 
hood of the Hermitage itself, 1 am Zealously and almost 
unanimously sustained. 

I am at perfect liberty to determine the position, I may 
assume, unrestricted by any other obligation, except those of 
patriotism and duty. It is time enough to take my stand. 
An early developernent would do mischief, instead of good. 
Moderation becomes, in my situation, alike a dictate of duty 
and prudence; but you may rest assured of one thing, that I 
will in the coming contest act second to no one. I feel that it 
would degrade me. I will stand on nry own ground, which I 
know to be strong in principle and the publick support. I

do not fear to carry the whole South with me, acting as it 
becomes my duty, which I will take care to do. I never 
stood stronger. I have the strongest assurance of a decided 
and successful support in Virginia, which in the present state 
of things is all important; but whatever strength I may have, 
I will deem it to be my duty, in the present critical state of 
our affairs, to direct to the publick good exclusively. 

I have no doubt, the course that may be pursued by the 
Anti Masons, will, if wisely directed, have a great influence 
in the coming contest. It must be decisive in N. York and 
Pennsy a if so directed. I take for granted, they cannot sup- 
port a Mason. It would forever destroy all confidence in the 
sincerity of their opposition to the Society. If they were to 
nominate M c Lean, he being a western man, it would excite 
the strongest excitement in the breast of M r . Clay's friends, 
that would end in a breach between them and the friends of 
the eludge, which could never be healed, and must end in de- 
feating the election of both. The Judge cannot run to the 
South. He is but little known, and his being in favour of the 
distribution of the Surplus Revenue, considered in the South 
to be the most odious and unconstitutional of all measures, 
renders it impossible for him to obtain strength in this quar- 
ter. The American system itself is not so odious here as the 
distribution scheme. It has done much to destroy Gen 1 Jack- 
son in the South. Whether they will look to M r . Webster, I 
see no indication, one way or the other. As to myself, I have 
no correspondence with any one belonging to the anti Masons, 
and do not know their views. I am not a mason, and go far- 
ther. I am so far anti Mason, that I believe the institution 
not only useless, in the present state of the world, but also 
pernicious; and have always thought so; tho' at the same 
time, 1 cannot doubt, but that there are, and have always 
been, many honest and virtuous members belonging to the 
society, who take a very different view of the institution. 
The Anti Masons have doubtless the right to regulate their 
votes on any principle, as individuals, that they may think 
calculated for the public good. So far they would be sus- 
tained by the publick voice; but to go beyond, the current 
would set against them. I do not know, however, that they 
go farther. I have been drawn into this speculation without

intending it, and simply through the force of association, as 
you live in the infected District, as the enemies of the Anti 
Masons call it.

To Samuel D. Inghani* 

Fort Hill 16 th June, 1831. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just received and acknowledge with- 
out delay your two last. 

The occurrence in Charleston to me was wholly unexpected. 
Jt was caused by the accidental visit of M c Duffie to that place. 
I think it every way imprudent, and have so written to 
Hamilton. 2 

I see clearly it brings matters to a crisis; and that I must 
meet it, promptly and manfully. I intended to wait for Mf 
Crawford's movement on me, so as to have the great advan- 
tage of acting on the defensive, but the occurrence to which 
I refer will not admit the uncertainty and delay of his move- 
ment. I have not yet had sufficient time to reflect, what 
course I ought to take, but am of the impression, that 1 had 
better come out in a neighboring print-directly without the 
aid of any (machinery?) If I take the course, I will state my 
opinions freely, but modestly, as by those of thp Virgia. Report, 
Kentucky Resolution and your supreme court in the case of 
Cobbett in '98; and will also state my opinion on all of the 
connected points, particularly that of our adjustment of the 
conflict. I desire to be distinctly understood, and will rely 
on truth and patriotism. They have often carried me through, 
and trust they will on the present occasion. My friends must 
judge whether the position I may take will be such as that 
they can prudently and patriotically maintain. If so I will

In the mean time silence is the best policy. Leave me to meet 
the occasion. I have received also two letters from Green. 
I am not surprised at his embarrassment and distress. I have

that he has not received my letters to him. I have written

you say so to him. So far from neglect, I will ever hold him 
in high estimation for his honest and disinterested course, 
under the most trying circumstances. 



To Samuel L. Gmiverneur. 1 

Fort Hill U th July 1831. 

MY DEAR SIR, The last mail brought yours and its en- 
closures; the latter I herewith return, without taking copies. 

If any thing could amaze me, as to the conduct of those in 
power, what you communicate would have that effect, I take 
it for granted the movement is from the President himself. 
How, after the correspondence between him and M r Monroe, 
and his attempt to justify his conduct on the ground, that his 
orders authorised it, he can at this late day attempt to give 
the affair a turn, which it would be impossible for him to 
make the publick to believe to be true; and, if he could, would 
prove fatal to his own character for honor, sincerity and truth, 
is really extraordinary. 

You did well, I think, to consult M r Wirt. The view he 
presented appears to me to be the true one. You did not 
enclose the copy of your letters to him, and I do not therefore 
understand your view, why you think it best not to communi- 
cate with M r Rhea. I confess with the light I have, it seems 
to me M r Wirt is right on that point, as well as all others. 
It is the natural course, and the reason ought to be strong to 
take one, that might require explination. 

The subject is one in which the character of M r Monroe as 
well as the government is so deeply involved, that nothing 
ought to be omitted in order to guard his reputation. The 
question ought not to be permitted to rest simply on the

weight of character. The probable truth of the respective 
statements ought to be fully investigated, should the subject 
come before the publick. No one is more competent to the 
task, than M r Wirt; and I feel confident none would undertake 
it with more devoted zeal. 

I deeply regret to learn the low state of M r Monroe's health. 
He is approaching the period, that naturally brings life to a 
termination, and 1 feel assured, that one of his firmness of 
mind, who has passed through so honorable and useful a 
career, will look at the approach of the period, with perfect 
calmness. 1 Present my most sincere and affectionate regard 
to him, and mine, with M rs Calhoun's, respects to M rs G. M rs 
C and the children, to whom you referred, are gratified with 
your kind recollection, and in turn desire to be remembered 
to you. 



To Christopher Van Deventer.* 

Fort Hill 5 th Aug b . 1831 

MY DEAR SIR, Yours of the 6 th July, with its enclosure, 
was safely received. The article was exceedingly well writ- 
ten. It is clear, if the anti masons nominate Judge M c Lean, 
it will either reelect Gen 1 Jackson, or bring the contest into 
the House where the Judge would be very weak. Report says, 
that he has declined putting himself on anti masonick grounds. 
I have been written to but have not yet replied. I will not 
be in too much haste to decide, whether I will answer, or not. 
If I do, I will state my opinions precisely as the exist, which 
is anti-masonick, but adverse to administering the Govern- 
ment on principles of proscription. 

There has been so much solicitude to know my sentiments 
on the great question of the relation, which the state and Gen- 
eral Gover*. bear to each other that I have laid them before 
the publick, as an act due to them, as well as to myself. I 
herewith transmit a copy. You will see, that I place myself 
on the principles, that brought the Republican party into 
power, in 1801; and that I have expressed myself with that 
tone of attachment to the Union of these states and our po- 
litical institutions, which I have ever felt. 1 know not how 



1 President Monroe had died on July 4. 

2 Original lent by Col. J. Van Deventer, of Knoxville, Tenn. 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 297 

our northern friends will receive the communication; but I 
feel assured, that it contains the only principles by which our 
constitution, our Union and liberty can be preserved. 

1 would gladly have given my sentiments on the subject of 
internal improvement, but I thought it not sufficiently con- 
nected with the subject in hand. I have no doubt of its great 
importance and, within proper limits, its constitutionality; 
but I think experience has abundantly shown, that the system 
cannot stand on a solid, or satisfactory basis without the inser- 
tion of an express provision Authorizing its exercise, and 
guarding against its abuses. When the debt is paid, I would 
be glad to see such a provision, and think the publick lands 
would constitute the proper funds under proper guards to be 
appropriated to this great object. I feel assured, that neither 
the questions of internal improvement, nor the proper dispo- 
sition of the publick lands will ever be settled down till some- 
thing of the kind be done, and that, till they are both fixed, our 
political system will be subject to violent discord and vibra- 
tions. Let these, with the Tariff, be placed on their proper 
basis, and the country will have some prospect of repose, and 
not before. 

If the country wants an individual to carry on the sectional 
conflicts, I am not their man. I would not advance myself 
by sacrificing its true interests; but if they look to the higher 
considerations of peace, harmony and liberty, it would be the 
proudest incident of my life, to be instrumental in promoting 
these great objects. 

Our best respects to M rs V. and your family.

Fort Hill 8 th Aug* 1831 

MY DEAR SIR, The severe indisposition of M rs Calhoun has 
prevented me from acknowledging at an earlier period your 
note of the 4 th July announcing, by a concurrence, that will 
be memorable in history, the death of M r Monroe. 

Your previous letter had prepared me for the melancholy

occurrence, if death, with the fulness of days and honor, can 
be so considered. 

I shall ever hold the memory of the deceased in gratitude 
and reverence. It is now almost twenty years since our 
acquaintance commenced, during a considerable portion of 
which time, I had ample opportunity, as chairman of the 
Committee of Foreign relations, while he was Secretary of 
State, and as Secretary of War under him during seven years 
of his administration, of forming a correct opinion of his 
character. Tho' not brilliant, few men were his equals in 
wisdom, firmness and devotion to the country. He had a won- 
derful intellectual patience; and could above all men, that I 
ever knew, when called on to decide on an important point, 
hold the subject immovably fixed under his attention, till he 
had mastered it, in all of its relations. It was mainly to this 
admirable quality, that he owed his highly accurate judgment. 
I have known many much more rapid in reaching the conclu- 
sion, but very few, with a certainty so unerring. 

Tho' not intending it, I find myself by a natural propensity, 
when speaking of departed friends, sliding into a biographical 
sketch, tho' writing to one, who knew him so intimately, that 
it must appear out of place, yet I am sure you will pardon it, 
as the overflowing of friendship and esteem. That I acquired 
and retained to the last the good opinion of one, whose name 
will occupy a high station in the eye of posterity, I consider 
among the fortunate incidents of my life. 

I enclose, herewith, a copy of the statement of my opinions 
on the relation, which the States and Gen 1 . Government bear 
to each other; a subject of the most vital importance, and 
which from the difference of views enterjbained in relation to 
it, is destined to bear strongly on the political movements of 
the country hereafter. Mine are the opinions of the Repub- 
lican party of '98, beyond which I do not go an inch. I can 
scarcely hope for the concurrence of my northern friends, 
however high the authority and strong the reasons, which sus- 
tain me. The ardent pursuit of gain, and the squabbles of 
politicks have been long drawing off our attention from the 
higher principles of government, till they are almost forgot- 
ten; and nothing but calamity, or its near approach can move 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOTJN. 299 

the country to a sense of the danger, always attendant on 
great and radical errors of policy. 

In relation to the subject of your former letter, I learn 
from a source entitled to perfect credit, that an individual 
retiring from Washington not long since detailed all of the 
facts openly at Cincinnatti. Ohio, with an intimation, that 
they would shortly be laid before the publick. Will they not 
appear in M r Crawford's book which it is said will be shortly 
forthcoming? Some able friend of M r Monroe, M r Wirt 
above all others, ought to be prepared to vindicate his 
character. 



To /Samuel L. Gmiverneur. 1 

Fort Hill 18 th Aug*. 1831 

MY DEAR SIR, You have assigned very substantial reasons 
for the course, which you adopted in relation to M r Rhea's 
letter to M r Monroe. If they do not out weigh the opposite 
consideration, they at least leave it a question of doubt. In 
considering him a mere instrument in the hands of others, 
you undoubtedly took the correct view. I intimated, that 
the whole would not improbably come out in M r Crawford's 
promised correspondence, in my former letter to you. I am 
strengthened in that impression, by having since learned that 
he has been in correspondence with M r Balch preparatory to 
his coming out; and that M r Balch was in Washington at the 
same time with M r Rhea, as I suppose on the same errand. 
M r Crawford's communication, according to an announcement 
in a Georgia paper, which apparently spoke on authority, ought 
to have appeared before this in the Globe. Has not the death 
of M r Monroe delayed it? It would produce too great a shock 
to attack his character, while the publick sympathy was so 
much excited. 

You took no greater liberty, than you had a right to do, in 
transmitting my letter to you to M r Wirt for his inspection. 
I have unbounded confidence in his discretion and honor.

of my power, cooperate with you in repelling every attack on 
his fair fame. The course now is obvious, to stand still till 
the enemy moves, which will put you in possession of his 
ground. With the direct proof, and the strong collateral 
circumstances corroborating it, fairly presented to the publick, 
there can be no doubt of the complete vindication of his char- 
acter, and the prostration of those, who to save themselves 
from disgrace, would ruin his reputation. 

1 enclose you a copy of my communication to the publick. 
The step was one, I knew of much hazard; but in such cases x 
I hold candour and truth above all other considerations. That 
any force of argument can change public opinion on the sub- 
jects considered in the communication, I do not expect; but 1 
feel assured that the coming confusion and danger, which I 
have for years foreseen, will. I know 1 am right. I have 
gone over the whole subject, with more care, than I ever did 
any other; and feel that I can not be mistaken; and I now 
have, as I ever have had, the utmost confidence in the triumph 
of truth if properly sustained. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Fort Hill 27 th Aug fc 18.31 

DEAR JAMES, The heavy rains and great rise in the Water 
courses must of course make you solicitous to hear about 
your planting interest in this quarter. The river has been 
very full, all over the low grounds, and covering completely 
the crops, except on a few most elevated spots. It has sub- 
sided partially, but is not yet in the banks. The cotton I 
think is lost, and I fear the corn too. They are both covered 
over with mud, tho there is now falling a rain, which I hope 
may was[h] it off, and at least give a more cheerful appear- 
ance. I had 50 acres of cotton completely covered and all 
my corn, in the same condition, except about 3 acres. The 
cotton on the upland has suffered most from the wet. It has 
shed profusely. 



LETTEES OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 301 

My communication, as far as I have yet heard, has been 
well received; with great approbation on our side, and not 
unkindly on the opposite, with very few exceptions. I have 
yet seen but two Virginia papers; both very favourable. 
The R. 1 Enquirer I have not yet received. 

Aleck, our house servant, gave us the slip yesterday and is 
now in the woods. I expect he has made for my place, and 
may possibly take Midway on his course. I must ask of you 
the favour to keep a lookout for him, and to give M r Gibson 
my overseer immediate notice in order that he may be also 
on the lookout. I will thank you to inform him, if he should 
be taken, to have him severely whipped and sent back imme- 
diately. I give this trouble, which I am sure you will excuse, 
as I have a private opportunity of writing to you sooner than 
I could by mail to my plantation. He had offended your sis-. 
ter, and she threatened him, with a severe whipping. He ran 
away to avoid it; and has left us without a house servant, 
except females. 

We are all well except your sister, who has not yet entirely 
recovered, but is much better. I will be glad to hear from 
you. Should you hear, I would be glad to learn, how I have 
fared on the River below, and whether Aleck has been seen 
or heard of.

expense of apprehending him, which I will return when I send

other cause, but to avoid a correction for some misconduct, 
and as I am desirous to prevent a repetition, I wish you to 
have him lodged in Jail for one week, to be fed on bread and 
water and to employ some one for me to give him 30 lashes 
well laid on, at the end of the time. I hope you will pardon 
the trouble. I only give it, because I deem it necessary to our 
proper security to prevent the formation of the habit of 
running away, and I think it better to punish him before his 
return home than afterwards. I will send for him the last of 
next week. 

I am much gratified to hear that my communication has 
been so well received by our friends in Abbeville and that 
the party is doing so well. Our cause is founded in truth and 
must prevail; or the liberty of the country be lost. 

M rs Calhoun is not yet entirely recovered, and she desires 
her love to you and Martha. 



To James Edward Colkoun. 

Fort Hill 10 th Sep r 1831 

MY DEAR JAMES, Your letter gave me the first information 
of the extent of my loss at Bath. That added to my loss here, 
which is literally everything, except about 50 acres of cotton, 
renders it a calamitous year to me. I will nothing like clear 
expenses. I am glad to hear, that your prospect is so much 
better. Your loss here is nothing like in proportion to mine, 
which is the heaviest on the river. The place is very low. 
It is a great objection. I send Lewis to bring up Harold and 
Aleck. The latter is at Abbeville. He was taken up on his 
way down. I send you some of the last papers. You will see 
by the Telegraph the tone of some of the leading Clay papers. 
They are for the most part respectful; I would say more so on 
an average than those quoted. The Enquirer praises all ex- 
cept the right of the state to interpose. My information from 
that state in very cheering. In fact I have got through far 
better than I anticipated. The communication has, as far as 
1 have seen, been published in every paper except the Globe,

and has been 1 understand universally read. Robbins, who 
you know knows everything, as he supposes, says the poorest 
and most ignorant people about M r Oliver's read it with great 
interest, and that it has made a strong impression on them. 

We have gained the victory in the Charleston city election; 
and Waddy Thompson writes me, that a thorough going state 
rights man is elected Gov r . of Miss 1 . The symptoms look 
well in N. Carolina. You must be sure not to be beaten in 
Abbeville. Victory there will be important; very important. 
Take some interest yourself in the contest. You can do much 
good by canvassing. 

Your sister is recovered and we are all well, tho not with- 
out apprehension as to health in consequence of the inunda- 
tion. I wish you to get for me two bushels of corn from M r 
Halsey. It comes so early, that it may help me out next 
summer. Do not fail to obtain it early. 

George is doing well. He was much alarmed for fear of 
sickness, but is now I believe without apprehension. 

Your sister and all of the children desire their love to you. 
I send enclosed two letters. 



To Christophw Van Deventer. 1 

Fort hill 27 th Oct r 1831 

MY DEAR SIR. I have received your last with its enclosures. 
That M r S should still consider himself of the Jefferson school 
of politicks, while he brands his doctrines as those of dis- 
union, I am not at all surprised, tho under ordinary circum- 
stances the thing would have been passing strange. The truth 
is, that the great body of Northern politicians, in their long 
contest about men, have entirely forgot principles, and are, 
as ignorant of the doctrines of the Republican party in former 
times, as, if they had never read, or heard of them. 

Your reply is well written, yet I would advise my friends 
at this time to avoid, if possible, every thing that would lead 
to collision in any quarter, saving only with that corrupt knot

that has got hold of power, and who have blasted the fruits 
of the great victory, which the country had achieved in favour 
of principle. If you reason with any one, or publish any- 
thing, let it be in the calmest sperit, attributing error, but 
not willful intention. The cause of truth is great, and must 
prevail. Of this I feel the greatest confidence. 

You must not think of publishing the correspondence to 
which you allude. It would do me no discredit, but a false 
interpretation would be placed on the publication, which would 
do harm. The continued assaults of my enemies will give me 
ample opportunity to place my conduct fairly before the 
publick on all points, that may be interesting; and there is 
always great advantage in acting on the defensive. Thus you 
see, the assault of Maj r Eaton, in his late address has com- 
pelled, and, therefore justified, a reply on my side, in order 
to correct his errors, in relation to myself, which has afforded 
me an opportunity to place in its proper light several points, 
essential to put my course and my character fairly before the 
publick. Among others, I have corrected his statement of 
what took place on my application on your behalf, for the 
place of Chief clerk; and, in doing so, have alluded to my 
letter to you, informing you of the result, and enclosing the 
letter of Governor Hamilton to me, in reference to the same 
subject. 1 presume you received my letter, tho I do not 
recollect whether you answered it, or not. As Maj r Eaton 
may attempt a reply, I wish you to furnish me a certified 
Copy of my letter to you and also of the enclosed letter of 
Gov 1 . Hamilton. Address to Washington, so it may be there 
the first week of the session, and not before, least it might 
[be] sent to my residence here. 

1 am glad to learn that your farming prospects are so good, 
and trust that your anticipation will be fully realized. You 
deserve much credit for the firmness with [which] you have met 
difficulties. 

M rs Calhoun joins her best respects to yourself, M rs V. and 
family. 

[P. S.] If you have not retained the letter send me a full 
statement of its contents, as far as you remember it, and also 
of Gov r . Hamilton's.

Memorandum of a Conversation, December ^ 183 1. 1 c. c. 
Mem. of a conversation with the Hon. J. C. Calhoun on the 
night of the 4 th of Dec r 1831. 2 Spoke of the Gen 1 . Gv*. its 
positive power of the negative power of the States of the 
tendency of the former to encroach upon and weaken the lat- 
ter. A State can only confer subordinate distinctions the 
Gv*. more elevated this corrupts or weakens the States. Of 
the doctrine of responsibility to the Constituents carried out 
to the responsibility of classes in the manufacturing, agricul- 
tural and mercantile. Showed that the principle was equally 
important in its application That the negative power of the 
States was this doctrine of responsibility as applied to the 
Gen 1 . Gov*. that it was the salvation of the Governmt. That 
the doctrine of secession was only applicable on a question 
between the States; and not as to one or more States and the 
Gen Gov 1 that being the agent of the whole. The 3/ 4ths are 
the ultimate tribunal in all cases involving disputed matters 
between the agent and principals and secession can only take 
place as between the Parties on the decision of that tribunal. 
Of Capital and operatives Spoke of the tendency of Capital 
to destroy and absorb the property of society and produce a 
collision between itself and operatives. The Federal Govt. by 
its distribution of revenues creates capitalists, and operates 
upon the labour of the States. Took the Instance of 100 men 
without a Gov*. showed the equilibrium that would prevail. 
Supposed a Government that would give $5000 to ten of the 
hundred and then traced the tendency of the Capital to erradi- 
cate the possession of the soil, and to reduce the 90 to a state 
of simple operatives. Spoke of the Tariff speech in 1816 
Done at the request of Ingham suddenly and without prepa- 
ration. Internal Improvement in favour of a Constitutional 
provision giving but limiting the use of the power in favour 
of the west. 

Suggested the propriety of TazewelPs bring up a States 
Rights resolution in the Senate. Positively declines a com- 
pact with Clay. Spoke of his folly and his hopes, spoke of 
Jackson said he had it in his power to annihilate him but 
would act on the defensive. Gave his views in regard to

To James Edward Calhmm. 

Washington 25 th Dec r 1331 

MY DEAR JAMES, I have received your letter of the 8 th 
Dec r . covering a copy of } r ours to Ma r Hamilton. The man- 
ner, in which you have handled the subject, proves that 
you have taken a strong hold of it; and, I am of the impres- 
sion, that the mode of action, which you indicate would at 
the proper stage have been one of the best to bring our cause 
before the world, but at the same time, I believe the period 
has passed to make application in any form to Congress. In 
fact, it may well admit of a doubt, whether it would be de- 
sirable to have a convention of the states till some one of them 
had interposed, as it is only by such action, that a necessity 
of acting on the subject could be imposed on the other states, 
and without such necessity, nothing would be done. With 
a knowledge that such would be the case, it would be impos- 
possible for our members to urge the subject with that Zeal 
and earnestness requisite to make an impression. I feel daily 
the more assured, that there is no other remedy for the deep 
disease, which now afflicts the system, but the one, which our 
state has fixed on. It will not cure itself. There is not the 
least indication of the system which oppresses us giving away. 
The taxes may, and probably will be, repealed; but the boun- 
ties will be retained; that is the duties may be repealed on all 
of the articles, which cannot be manufactured in the country, 
but will be retained on all that can; the effects of which will 
be to deminish the burden, but to make it more unequal; to 
take it off the rich, and leave- it on the poor; off the north and 
on the south; and yet this is all we can expect. Not an inch

more will be yielded; if this indeed can be called yielding. In 
the mean time, as a necessary result of such injustice and ine- 
quality, disaffection and corruption are striking their roots 
deeply in every direction; and the fatal lesson in a free state 
is daily taught, that the road to obtain and retain power lies 
through duplicity, cunning and subserviency. When I look 
back and mark the progress of events for the last 15 years, 
and note the decay of honor, honesty and patriotism, and the 
growth of the opposite vices, I hold it utterly impossible that 
the present march of our affairs can continue 15 years more, 
without an entire change of system. It must be arrested, or 
revolution will be the alternative. 

The weather has been exceedingly severe, more so than I 
have ever known both for the intensity and duration of the 
cold. It relaxed yesterday, but I fear only to lay the founda- 
tion for snow, or rain. If it has been as cold with you, it 
must have made the completion of our cotton harvest very 
slow and disagreeable. As far as I can learn the crop will 
be a short one. 

1 hope you have entirely recovered. Influenzas have been 
very common, in fact 1 m&y say almost universal. I have 
escaped with a slight attack, not exceeding in severity an 
ordinary cold. M r Wirt has been dangerously ill; but is 
better. I will be glad to hear from you. Living batchelor 
as you do, you must have much leisure for writing. Do not 
forget the corn from Providence.

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letters of the 17 and 
19 th Insts with their enclosures and am much obliged [to] you 
for furnishing me with the Statements they contain. 

I have little to write. I do not see the least prospect of any 
satisfactory modification of the Tariff. As far as I can judge 
from indications, the result will be the repeal of the taxes and 
the retention of the bounties; that i*, the duties will be retained 
on all articles the North can manufacture, and be repealed on

till others. The burden will it is true be diminished, but the 
inequality be increased; it will be taken of[f] the North and 
left on the South; off the rich and left on the poor. More 
than this we cannot expect; at least such is my fear; tho' I 
sincerely hope that I may be mistaken. We shall soon see. 

1 rejoice to see the Whig commence with so much sperit, 
and talents. It will be an able auxiliary in the great cause of 
the Constitution and of liberty. If we should be defeated in 
Carolina, there will be little hope for our system. Let all be 
animated with the conviction that they are contending for the 
Constitution; for the Union; and liberty. 

The weather has been exceedingly cold but is now somewhat 
more moderate. Influenza has been almost universal, and in 
many instances very severe. I have escaped with a slight 
attack. 

What I write on politicks, you will of course understand is 
not for the publick. 

Make my best respects to Martha. l 



To Miss Anna Maria Calhoun. 

Washington 30 th Dec 1 ' 1831 

MY DEAR MARIA, 1 have been waiting some time to hear 
from you, but see that as usual you stand on the ceremony 
of the first letter, even with your father. I do not know, that 
1 ought to censure } r ou for your aversion to writing, as I 
believe it is in some degree .hereditary; but you ought to 
recollect, that the great object of education is not only to 
cultivate our faculties, but to learn to control our dispositions; 
to restrain those that are too strong, and strengthen those, 
that are too weak. Among the latter, I am sure you will 
place your disposition to correspond. I do not know a more 
desirable acquirement (I mean of the literary kind) in a lady, 
than that of writing a good letter; an acquirement, however, 
which can only be attained by practice; but which with prac- 
tice and care may certainly be acquired, at least in a respect- 
able degree. In your case, with your vivacity, and good 
sense, all that you want is practice; and I must insist on your

extending to me during the winter, a full share of your prac- 
tice. Your Mother informed me, that she had determined 
on M r Mark's institution, and that you would commence the 
1 st Jan y . I hope you find yourself well situated, and that you 
are well pleased. You must write to me without delay and 
give me a full account of everything; the course of studies, 
the teachers; what you are learning; how many young ladies; 
and where they are from; who are your room mates; and 
who your particular companions. If you do not wish to write 
too long a letter, yotf may make my inquiries the subject of 
several. 

I wrote Co 1 Chappell about a week since and enclosed him 
$200 for you, with the request that he would hold it in his 
hand and disburse it for you. A part is intended for your 
pocket money, and the rest for your necessary expenses. I 
hope he has received my letter. The weather has been 
exceedingly cold; more so than I have ever witnessed. It is 
now snowing. Influenzas have been almost universal, and in 
many instances severe. I have escaped, I believe as well as 
any one that I know. 

You have many friends in Columbia. You must not per- 
mit yourself to be drawn too much into company. Restrict 
your visiting to a few families, and do not go into large 
parties. It will be time enough two, or three years hence to 
go into company. Let me know what families you visit; and 
if you have not written, do not delay to write immediately. 

[P. S] I have just received the enclosed 1 from the engraver. 
Keep one yourself and give the other to whom you please. 



To Samuel L. Gouvemeur? 

Washington 13 th Feb 1832 

MY DEAR SIR, I am not at all surprised, that the current 
of events here should produce the impression, which it has on 
you. The whole system is, I fear, deeply diseased, while 
those, who have the administration of the government in their 
hands, appear entirely unconscious of the fact, or at least

indifferent to the fate of the country. Never did I conceive it 
possible, that a political degeneracy so rapid and extensive 
could fall on a free country, as that which has fallen on ours 
within the last seven years. The election of M r . Adams, un- 
der the unfortunate circumstance, [under which] it occurred, 
gave the downward impulse, which has received a four fold 
acceleration, by the elevation of the man, who was raised to 
power to arrest the de[s]cent. How this has resulted I need 
not relate. It is sufficient to say, that the union of those pecu- 
liar qualities which belong to Gen 1 . Jackson, his popularity, 
his force of character; his jealousy, and want of political in- 
formation, with the impression of his patriotism and honesty, 
with those, that in like manner belong to M r Van Buren, his 
dexterity, cunning, and skill in party tacticks, formed a com- 
bination better calculated to engender the present corrupt and 
dangerous state of things, than any other that can ever be 
imagined. When to this, I add the peculiar character, and 
action of the opposition, under the direction and control of M r 
Clay, which has brought the great interests of this country 
into a state of most dangerous conflict, I feel that we are 
rapidty approaching the most dangerous cricis, through which 
our country has ever passed. It is time for the virtuous and 
patriotick to lay aside every other consideration, but to save 
the country, and this, I feel assured, can only be effected by a 
thorough reformation. Thus thinking, those with whom I 
act, stand aloof from the present party conflicts. They can 
act with neither side. Their simple aim is to discharge their 
duty, and restore the constitution. 

I do not doubt, but that the partisans of M r V. B. will make 
the most desperate effort to force him into the V. Presidency, 
but judging from indications, I am of the impression, they 
will fail. I am told by those, who ought to know, that neither 
Virginia nor Pennsy a . will support him, nor consent to send 
delegates to Baltimore. I am of the impression he will not 
get a southern vote. My own state will stand aloof from 
that, as well as the contest for the Presidency. When the 
time comes she will quietly give her vote according to her 
sense of duty. 

I feel the deepest conviction, that our politicks must take 
a new direction, and that the government must be thoroughly 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 311 

reformed in every department with the .next four years, or 
our splendid political experiment will fail, and with it the 
best hopes of the human race. 

I would be very glad to see you on many accounts. I have 
much to say, that I cannot well say by letter; particularly in 
relation to that, which concerns the character and memory of 
our departed friend. I fear the movers against him have 
not ceased with his death, but that an effort will be made to 
consumate the base and wicked conspiracy of the last summer. 

I am in good health, and trust you are the same. Make 
my kind respects to M rs G r . and believe me to be with sincere 
regard .... 



To Mis* Anna Maria Calhoun. 

Washington 13 th Feb 1832 

MY DEAR MARIA, As I promised to be a very punctual cor- 
respondent, I feel, that I owe an explanation, for the long 
interval between the dates of your last and this my answer to 
it, but I have no other, but one, which has been so often 
offered by negligent correspondent[s], as to be of a very sus- 
picious character, the want of time. I would, however, have 
you to believe, that, in this case, it is offered in good faith, as 
a real and substantial explanation. Between business, and 
miscellaneous engagements, I know of no place better calcu- 
lated to interrupt a correspondence, than Washington, during 
a session of Congress; but 1 must give } r ou notice, that while 
1 may occasionally avail myself of the plea of want of time, 
I must protest against your offering it on your part, who can 
have no other interruption, but your studies. I know that 
you acquire so rapidly, that you cannot in fairness be entitled 
to put in the plea. You see from what I write, that I shall 
expect a prompt acknowledgement of this my letter; and, 
when 1 tell } T OU how much pleasure it affords me to hear from 
you, my dear child, I am sure your compliance will be as 
cheerful as I doubt not it will be prompt. You will, at all 
events, not be able to get off with your old excuse, that you 
have no aptness at letter writing. Your last letter is remark 
ably well written, and affords evidence, that you only need a

little more habit of writing to excel in that description of 
composition. It is, in fact, the kind that ladies are most apt 
to excel in; and which, as they are the most frequently com- 
pelled to exercise, they ought to cultivate with the greatest 
care. 

I am much gratified to learn, that you are so well pleased 
with the institution and your situation. The change of your 
room mate must add to the agreeableness of your situation. 
I am glad to see, among other things, that your regulations 
require such early rising; and do hope, you will contract a 
habit, which will contribute greatly to your health, as well as 
happiness through life. While pursuing your studies, you 
must not neglect dancing, musick and the other accomplish- 
ments. You know the estimate your Uncle James places 
even on the walk, but as worthy of cultivation, as that may 
be, I consider the position in sitting to be still more so, as 
being connected with health as well as the graces. 

I agree with you, the likeness, I sent, is not good. I sent 
it because the artist had placed several in my hands, and I 
had no other mode of disposing of them, but to send them to 
those, who might take some interest even in a tolerable like- 
ness. 

1 continue to enjoy good health; and am becoming exceed- 
ingly anxious to return. These long seperations are exceed- 
ingly painful, and I will certainly turn my face homeward, 
the moment my publick duties will permit me to depart from 
this place. Make my best respects to Co 1 Chappell and fam- 
ily, Judge Martin and family, and, if Judge De Saussure 
should be in Columbia, to him and Miss Sarah.

Washington 26 th Feb 1832 

MY DEAR JAMES, 1 will without delay attend to the Bank 
dividend; and, when obtained, will dispose of your share, as 
you desire. You have taken the true view of our agriculture. 
We are, as you say, better off, than what they are in high 
latitudes. Rotation alone, if washing is prevented, will go 
far to keep up our land. With us, small grain is an im- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 313 

prover; not of itself, but through the after growth, if the 
land be not pastured, which gives us a decided advantage 
over higher latitudes, where the harvest is too late for an 
after growth. But we must not neglect manure. It is a 
great addition; and ought to be carefully attended to. With 
proper attention to that, and a rotation based on cotton, corn 
and small grain, we may (provided always that washing be 
prevented) go on fertilizing our land from year to year, till 
Carolina will become one of the finest regions on the globe. I 
speak on the supposition that the draining process is arrested, 
which annually transfers not much short of $20,000,000 of 
our labour to be placed on far distant regions; a process, the 
impoverishing effect of which no industry nor skill can coun- 
teract. As connected with this point, I enclose MDuffie's 
report on the Tariff, the best thing, that he has said, or written 
on the subject. 1 It is far from exhausting the subject, but as 
far as it goes, is unanswerable, and complete except as to the 
money section, on which his former opinions, have somewhat 
warped his judgement. I also send you agreeably to your 
request the documents appended to the report of the 'Secre- 
tary of the Navy; and when Gallatin's report, 2 with Judge 
Harpers appendix, on the Tariff is printed, I will also forward 
you that. It is an important document; but I cannot but 
suspect, that the Genevan has been much more anxious to 
conciliate the powers that be, than to do justice to the South. 
His scheme would give us but small relief, and would but lay 
the foundation of new struggles. We have certainly made 
an impression ; not by speaking, for that would of itself have 
had no effect, but by the intrepid and noble stand of our 
little State. The dread of interposition operates, where 
logick cannot reach. One great point we have certainly 
gained, the concentration of Southern opinions, as to the opera- 
tion of the system. No man from the South is now deceived 
by the absurdity, that the consumers pa} r . This is a great 
step in our march; yet, I think, the North will not yield. 
They begin to acknowledge, that the real question is, who 
shall supply the market, and that unless prevented, we can 
furnish the foreign supplies so cheap, by exchanging our

staple products for them, that we can drive them out of the 
market; a confession, which places the injustice and oppres- 
sion of the system in the most glaring light. But to turn to 
agriculture ; I am obliged to you for engaging the boiler. I 
shall find great use for it, when I get my mill in operation. 
I intend to change my entire system of feeding. In agricul- 
tural improvements, I would recommend to you the free use 
of the coulter, when the surface is bare. It can puncture so 
much deeper with the same force, that it would be found to 
be a great instrument both to prevent washing, and to coun- 
teract the effects of droughts. 



To Samuel L. Gouverneur. 1 

Washington 4 th March 1832 

MY DEAR SIR, As the subject of your last letter was con- 
nected with [the] memory of M r Monroe, I determined, before 
I took any step in relation to it, or the letter enclosed, I would 
lay them before M r Wirt, so as to have the benefit of his 
opinion, before I formed my own. The result has been, that 
we concur in thinking, that it is not necessary to notice the 
allusion in M r Forsyth's speech. As far as we are informed, 
it has attracted no attention; and, in fact, it is so brief, and 
stands so detached from any thing connected, with what it 
may be supposed to refer to, that it is doubtful, whether any 
one not acquainted with the facts, would regard it, as it was 
probabty intended. 

Having come to this conclusion, 1 of course did not deliver 
the letter enclosed; but thought it proper to show it to the 
General, who 1 know may be fully confided in. He concurs 
in the view taken by M r Wirt and myself. We think, that 
the proper position to be taken by the friends of M r Monroe 
is to act strictly on the defensive. Should any open move be 
made in this most nefarious affair by General Jackson, or his 
partisans for him, no doubt, it ought to be met directly, and 
with the indignation, which the character of the transaction 
is so well calculated to excite. I do not, however, believe 
any such move will be made. It would not be in character.

Crime is cowardly. The scheme will be to operate in the 
dark, and to use the extensive and powerful machinery in his 
hands to preoccupy the publick mind. I have, in fact, docu- 
ments in my hand which prove conclusively, that this opera- 
tion has been, and is still in process; and it is not improbable, 
that it will become necessary to counteract it. 1 am of the 
impression, that, at your convenience, you ought to visit the 
city, when all of the facts will be before you, and when the 
course, that ought to be adopted, may, after full considera- 
tion, be determined on. I wish to see you on several 
accounts, and hope, if your business does not prevent, you 
will not fail to make us a visit. 

I would have answered your letter earlier, but M r Wirt 
was so occupied in court, that it was some days before he had 
sufficient leisure to turn his attention to the subject of your 
letter. I hope the view, which we have taken will meet with 
your concurrence. 

Present my best respects to M rs Gr. and believe me to be 
wjth sincere regard

Washington 10 th March 1832 

MY DEAR MARIA, I have read your last letter with much 
pleasure. It is correctly and sensibly written. With practice 
you will excel in letter writing. It is among the highest 
accomplishments; and well deserves careful cultivation. 

With your great aversion to early rising, you deserve much 
praise for not having in any instance "missed prayers"; and, 
I do hope, that your anticipation, that habit will make it 
agreeable to you, will prove correct. We lose time, pleasure 
and health by late sleeping. Life is a journey. If we lose 
the morning, it will require hard and fatiguing travel to reach 
our stage. You must see that daily examplified in your les- 
sons. The greatest effort will scarcely regain the loss of a 
single hour in the morning. I am gratified to learn, that you 
stand head. Where there are so many girls it is a proof both 
of application and talents. The first visit I make to Mr. 
Thompson's book store, I will get and send to you the musick

which you request. Give a full and fair trial to your voice, 
but unless it should prove at least pretty good, it would be 
an useless consumption of time to attempt to become a Singer; 
but do not dispair till you have made a fair trial. 

You say, you are anxious to know, what is going on in the 
political world, as you have no opportunity to learn passing 
events in your secluded situation. I am not one of those, who 
think your sex ought to have nothing to do with politicks. 
They have as much interest in the good condition of their 
country, as the other sex, and tho' it would be unbecoming 
them to take an active part in political struggles, their opin- 
ion, when enlightened, cannot fail to have a great and salutary 
effect. So you see, that I have no disposition to withold politi- 
cal information from you, but you must excuse me in declin- 
ing the task of giving you a proper conception of the present 
political condition of the country. It would be impossible in 
the limitted sphere of an ordinary letter. I can only say nega- 
tively, that things are going on badly, and that there must 
be a great change to bring our affairs right. I hope such a 
change may be effected, but it is a work of much difficult}^. 

I commend your caution in declining to speak of your asso- 
ciates till you have had more time to form your opinion of 
their respective talents, and character. Much of the misfor- 
tune of life comes from hasty and erroneous conception of 
others. A single error, in that particular, often involves the 
most disastrous consequences. 

My health continues good; and my anxiety to return increases 
daily. As soon as the important business of the Session is 
through, I will leave this, which I hope may be all next 
month. 1 I must, before I conclude, my dear daughter, entreat 
you to take good care of your health. Take ample exercise, 
and be careful of your posture, while sitting and pursuing 
your studies. Keep, as much as possible, your body in an 
erect position. Beauty and health both require it.

Washington 31 st March 1832 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . The political condition of the country 
is as bad, as it can well be. Corruption has struck her roots 
deeply into the system. The publick morals are impaired. 
The independent character of our people is rapidly sinking to 
the lowest and basest subserviency. The disease, I fear lies 
deep far more so than is suspected. We must return to the 
old Whig doctrines of '98. Nothing but a thorough reform 
can save us and that cannot be long delayed, without utter 
ruin. 

Make my respects to M rs V. and your family.

Washington 15 th April 1832. 

DEAR SIR, I enclose $20, of which apply $5 to my own 
subscription, and the remainder to that of M r Warley, M r 
Cherry and M r Bonum, all of Pendleton, So Carolina. I wish 
my paper to be sent to this place till the end of the session, 
and then to Pendleton. By some omission, I have only 
received two numbers, and will thank you to give particular 
direction to have the paper punctually sent in future. The 
subscription, containing the names of M r Warley, Cherry 
and Bonum, was sent last summer or fall to Gov r . Floyd, if 
I am not mistaken; and I suppose had, of course, been turned 
over to you. 

1 see no prospect of a satisfactory adjustment of the Tariff. 
Some impression has certainly been made by the movements 
in Carolina, but not sufficient, I fear, to compel the oppressor 
to let go his grasp. All history proves, when the parts of a 
community are placed in the relation, now existing between 
the South and the other sections, reason is perfectly impotent 
to stay the course of injustice and oppression. If no con- 
servative principle be found in the Constitution, to arrest the

natural course of events, in such cases, the end must be a 
revolution or an entire change of system. If there be a fact 
well established by the history of all free states, it is, that 
some constitutional provision is absolutely necessary to render 
the parts of a community just to each other; as much so, as to 
render the agents responsible to the people, and for precisely 
the same reason. Under our system, the States were intended 
to perform this high and conservative function, through the 
power of interposition; but by a misconception of the rela- 
tion between the States and the General Gov*. the system has 
operated as if this most important check did not exist. The 
result has been our present corrupt, distracted and dangerous 
condition, which, so far from correcting itself, as is antici- 
pated by many, will go on increasing, if not arrested by the 
interposition of some one of the States, till the system of 
Government itself will be destroyed. It is true, that the 
fear of interposition, if sufficiently strong, may act like the 
reality, and thus dispense with the actual application; but in 
our case, tho' Carolina has made a deep impression, the dis- 
ease, I believe, to be too deep, and the infatuation too great, 
for any thing short of the thing itself, to be effectual. With- 
out it, there certainly can be no effectual cure; and one, short 
of that, would, in the end, prove fatal to the constitution, the 
Union and liberty of these States. It would finally prove 
the worst possible result. 

Our situation is a strange one. Jackson is losing ground, 
without his opponent gaining. Disgust uneasiness and dis- 
content are gradually taking hold of the publick, which, if 
they take the right direction, if they shall cause the people 
to look into the real cause of our present alarming condition, 
and to apply the proper remedy, will end in a great and salu- 
tary reform, which may. perpetuate our liberty and prosperity 
to the latest generation; but, if not, may terminate in the 
overthrow of our political institutions. With this impres- 
sion, I consider the great duty of the enlightened and patri- 
otick, at this time is to turn the public eye to those great 
whig doctrines, which, at another momentous period of our 
history, effected so salutary a change in our Government. 
You have commenced at a most interesting period. A little 
too late, perhaps, for the presidential struggle, but 1 regard 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 319 

that of but little importance; but not too late for the great 
reform, which, I trust, is before us. The re-election of Gen. 1 
Jackson will go far to dispel the existing delusion in relation 
to him. His name will then lose its potency; and thus the 
greatest impediments, in the march of principle in the South- 
ern States, will have been withdrawn. The operation of his 
name has acted more perniciously with you, 1 than in any other 
Southern State; but the friends of liberty every where look 
to your intelligence, your firmness and patriotism to counter 
act the morbid action. No one has a more difficult task, but 
to none will success bring greater glory. 



To James Edward Callumn. 

Washington 28 th April 1832 

MY DEAR JAMES, I have received your bank dividend ($22) 
and have had shipped to Mathers and Bonneau the hill side 
plough from Baltimore, which costs $12. The plough had to 
be made, which occasioned some loss of time. 

I am pleased to see you so earnestly engaged in planting, 
and so desirous of improving our agriculture. It is the first 
of pursuits, and I know nothing, by which our enlightened 
and wealthy citizens can more effectually place their country 
under obligation, than by contributing to its improvement. 
I have no doubt but with your naval habits and zeal, you will 
do much that way; but, I think, you would do wrong to resign 
your commission. It has cost you much time and sacrifice, 
and ought not to be hastily surrendered. Besides, the times 
are exceedingly uncertain. No one can tell what may come. 
There will be no difficulty, I take it, in the extension of your 
furlough. If I can be of any service in obtaining an exten- 
sion, you, of course, can at any time, command my service. 
I have no doubt but the Secretary will be disposed to 
oblige me. 

We are advancing very slowly. Every thing is still uncer- 
tain; the Tariff in particular, as much so, as at the commence- 
ment of the Session. The stand, which our state has taken, 
has made an impression; but I fear not sufficiently strong to

obtain us justice. The monopolist will relax his grasp only 
from necessity. There can be no doubt, but that the Presi- 
dent, with the immense power and patronage in his hand, 
might, had he thrown his weight on the side of justice, have 
closed the controversy; but he and his advisers are much 
more solicitous about his reelection, than the good of the 
country; and I am ashamed to add, that many of our southern 
members are, I fear, far more concerned in the same event 
than the interests of their constituents. I cannot doubt, from 
what I daily see, that our whole system is rapidly becoming a 
mere money making concern to those, who have the control of 
it; that every feeling of patriotism is rapidly sinking into an 
universal sperit of avarice. We need a deep and thorough 
reform. 

To Richard K Oralle. 1 c. c. 

Washington May 1832 

DEAR SIR, A discussion, such as that you refer to, would 
be very useful, but, I apprehend, the individuals to whom you 
name here would be too busy at this late period of the session 
to under take it. I could not possibly command the time. 
Judge Harper 2 probably might be induced to under take it. 
No one is more competent. If any one could induce him, it 
would be M r Preston of Columbia. They are intimate friends, 
and as Gov r Floyd is intimate with the latter, that would be 
the best channel through which to act. 

What are the feelings of B. W. Leigh? 3 If his talents 
could be called into action, it would effect much in your State. 
I hardly know what to advise you as to the V. Presidency. 
I put not the least reliance, at this great crisis on P*. or V. P*. 
There was a time, that the immense power and patronage of the 
Gen 1 . Gov*., placed in able and patriotick hands, might have 
brought all right. It is now too late for that remedy, or any 
other, except the reserved rights of the States. You may 
assume it as certain Congress will do nothing, that ought to 
satisfy any one, not prepared for consolidation. We must 
look to the States, as our last hope; and it seems to me, that 
the question of the V. Pres y ought to be entered into by you

just to the extent, and no farther, than may be necessary to 
strengthen the state rights doctrines in your State. To carry 
it beyond, so as to make it a primary question, would be, as 
it seems to me, disasterous. In a word, we must reverse the 
past. Every thing must be held subordinate to principle. 
The higher and bolder the ground assumed the better. Let 
us place the Presidential question under our foot; and make 
it the criterion of patriotism not to take office under the Gen 1 . 
Gov* till the Constitution be restored; and the South liberated 
from her burdens. 

I no longer consider the question one of free trade, but of 
consolidation. If, after ten years of remonstrance and denun- 
ciation of the system, as unconstitutional, the Southern States 
should now yield their ground, where can a stand be here- 
after made? When will such another opportunity, as that of 
the discharge of the publick debt, be ever again presented ? 
Let the occasion pass, and it is easy to see, what must follow 
corruption, oppression and monarchy. Never was there a 
more trying period for the liberty of our Country no not 
the revolution itself. It is distressing to think how imper- 
fectly it is realized by the great body of the country.

Gen 1 Jackson is about to come before the publick, on the sub- 
ject to which your letter refers. With this indication it 
appears to me that you ought to remain silent for the present. 
It will give great advantage to act on the defensive.

enclose a general letter in favour of Samuel, which I hope 
may be of some use to him. The proceedings at Columbia 
are of an extraordinary character, indeed, and certainly indi- 
cate a factious sperit, as well as a very selfish one. They have 
been well answered by our Committee, and delegation, which 
I hope you have seen. 

I foresee a good deal of agitation ahead in relation to the rail 
road, 1 which must distract and divide the State, unless there 
should be much prudence, and good management on the part 
of the Legislature. I hold as the first and indispensible step, 
to preserve the harmony of the State, to be, that the Legisla- 
ture should come to a final determination before any subscrip- 
tion, or appropriation be made toward the work on its part, 
and as a condition of its aid and support, that the best route 
within the limits of the charter shall be selected. The road 
must not bend to local or personal interest. Let it be fixed, 
that the two routes by the French Broad and Tuckaseege shall 
be surveyed, and that the one which is the shortest, cheapest 
of construction, of the most favourable grading, and which 
shall from its direction command the greatest amount of trade 
and travelling shall be selected, and the whole State will acqui- 
esce. Even the selfish would be ashamed to object. I answer 
for it, that the people in this quarter would cheerfully assent 
to such a course. It is the only one, that can unite all. In 
fact, I consider that all the interests present at the Knoxville 
Convention have pledged themselves and those the} 7 represent 
expressly, to take the best route within the limits of the char- 
ter, and that it would be bad faith now to change the principle 
on which the selection ought to be made. 

I do hope that you and the rest of the Representatives in 
the legislature on the South of the San tee will be vigillant and 
take care that justice shall be done to our section of the State. 
Heretofore all the appropriations for improvements have been 
in the other sections. It must not be repeated. It is time 
that justice should be done to this section. 

I expect to be in Columbia early in the session and will 
remain as long as my Congressional duties will permit. The 
session will be an important one.

MY DEAR JAMES, I find things better here than I antici- 
pated. Our cause is doing well. Let our people go on; be 
firm and prudent; give no pretex for force, and I feel con- 
fident of a peacable and glorious triumph for our cause and 
the state. 

The prospect is good for a satisfactory adjustment. It 
begins to be felt, that we must succeed, and in proportion as 
that is felt, the disposition to adjust the controversy increases. 
The scheme of coercion is abandoned, for the present at least. 



To Christopher Van Deventer. 1 

Fort Hill 24 th March 1833 

DEAR SIR, The last mail brought me yours of the 22 d Feb- 
ruary, and, is the second, which I have received from you 
since the commencement of the last session of Congress, so 
that two of your letters must have been miscarried, or pur- 
loined. The mail establishment seems to be in a wretced 
condition every way. I have reason to believe, that letters 
to, and from me are not safe. 

The letter which I received during the session, was at a 
late period, when I was so engaged, as to compel me to drop 
my private correspondence, which, I trust, will be a sufficient 
apology for not answering it. 

Your letters, as well as all that I see and hear, satisfies me, 
that the sperit of liberty is dead in the North; and but con- 
firms the truth of the principles, for which I have contended 
under so many difficulties. It is of the very genius of a con- 
solidated Government to elevate one portion of the Commu- 
nity, while it corrupts the other. That form of Government 
is now established by law under the bloody act, and unless 
there should be a complete reaction, a reaction which shall 
repeal that atrocious act and completely reform the Govern- 
ment, we must expect, and prepare to sink under coruption 
and despotism. Of such reaction and reform, there is not the

least hope, but from the south, and through the agency of 
state rights. The oppressed states must act on the principle 
systematically, that no unconstitutional act shall be enforced 
within their respective limits. There is no other remedy. 
We have commenced the sj^stem; and as it regards the Tarif, 
the most difficult of all acts to resist, with encouraging suc- 
cess. I have no doubt the system has got its death wound. 
Nullification has dealt the fatal blow. We have applied the 
same remedy to the bloody act. It will never be enforced in 
this state. Other states may live under its reign, but Caro- 
lina is resolved to live only under that of the Constitution. 
There shall be at least one free state. 

I am curious to know how the Webster and Van Buren 
interests will act. Will they amalgamate ? and if not what 
will be their relative strength and their respective course? 
As to the South it will go with neither. Even Jackson is 
dead or dying throughout the whole south.

family.

to this place, prevent me from accepting your invitation. 

Permit me to avail myself of the opportunity of presenting 
to you, individually, my unfeigned acknowledgement for the 
very kind terms in which you have communicated the invita- 
tion. That my efforts in behalf of constitutional liberty, at 
this great crisis, when all that we hold most dear is at stake, 
has met the approbation of those so competent to judge, will 
ever be to me a source of consolation. We have indeed been 
compelled to meet the spirit of Federalism in its worst char-

acter; and with it, what I entirely concur with you, is far 
more dangerous, that pseudo-Republicanism, which has ap- 
peared among us of late; and which, while it professes the 
doctrines of State Rights, carries the principles and practice 
of consolidation, far beyond what the Federal party, in the 
days of Hamilton and Ames, ever conceived. It is this spuri- 
ous offspring, which renders the present crisis so imminently 
dangerous to the Constitution and Liberty of our country. 
The American people are eminently Republican in their char- 
acter and feelings; and were the contest openly between the 
two great parties, which have so long divided the country, 
and which must continue to divide us, so long as our present 
institutions exist, short would be the struggle, and decided 
would be our victory; but as it is, with a numerous party 
within our own ranks, carrying our insignia, and using our 
watchword, but acting on the extreme ultra principles of our 
old opponents, the utmost exertions, and the most unceasing 
vigilance, will be necessary, to restore the Constitution to its 
primitive purity, and reform the many and dangerous abuses 
which have crept into the administration of the Government. 
I trust, however, as great as is the difficulty, it will not be 
found insuperable. To freemen, actuated by the spirit of 
patriotism, ^united, zealous, and firm, animated by the recol- 
lection of the noble struggle which their ancestors made in the 
same great and sacred cause, all things are possible. If there 
ever was a struggle calculated to call forth the highest energy 
of freemen, that struggle, particularly as far as the fate of 
this section is involved, is the present one.

Washington 12 Dec r 1833 

MY DEAR SIR, The interruptions incident on an arrival here, 
and forming arrangemonts for the Session, have prevented me 
from writing at an earlier period. On recognitering our 
ground and seeing the strength of our position, I find that we 
are a good deal stronger in the House of Representatives both

in numbers, and in sperit and Union, than what we were at 
the last session. In the Senate, our numbers are about the 
same, but with an increase of sperit and zeal. Our position 
is strong in both houses, particularly in the Senate. No 
measure can be taken but with our assent, where the adminis- 
tration and the opposition parties come into conflict. Neither 
party have a majority. It is probably different, as yet, in the 
House of Representatives; yet our weight can be made sensi- 
ble there even now, and will probably be sufficient to turn the 
scale before the end of the session, as I cannot doubt, but the 
administration will be much weakened before the close of 
the session. 

There is at present but little prospect of repealing the force 
bill. 1 have fixed Friday week for the time to take it up. 
There is a pretty strong disposition on the part of many of 
the N. England Senators to vote the repeal; but it is probable, 
that they will not have firmness enough to carry their feelings 
into effect. 

I hold it doubtful, whether the deposits will be returned to 
the Bank. All, or nearly all condemn the removal; but many 
suppose that to return them would but strengthen the bank 
and increase the prospect of renewing the charter. 

We have received the answer of the bank direction to the 
President's paper. It is a masterly refutation of his charges. 

We hear nothing from Columbia. What will be done? 

I enclose a letter for Maria. If she is not in Columbia, I 
will thank you to send it to her. 

Say to M r . Noble, if he has concluded to send Ezekiel to 
West Point, he ought to forward his application as soon as he 
returns to Abbeville. I have renewed the application in behalf 
of Arthur, and M r . M c Dufiie and myself have prepared a joint 
application to the War Department, to be delivered in person 
by M r . M c Duffie. I hope it may be successful.

MY DEAR SIR, I received your letter this morning, and 
have conversed with M r . M c Duffie in relation to its contents.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 327 

He informs me, that he will in no event be a candidate for 
reelection. It is due to M r . M c Duffie to say, that his tetter to 
M r . Brooks, stating that he would not be again a Candidate, 
was in answer to a letter from M r . B, directly putting the 
question to him, whether he would, or would not be a candi- 
date; this fact had, however, better remain with yourself. 1 

You certainly- can not be censured by any one for permit- 
ting your name to be brought forward under the w circumstances 
which you stated; and I do hope, that should you appear to 
be clearly the Candidate, who is preferred by the party and 
the District, that M r . B will retire; as I am perfectly sure you 
would do under similar circumstances. At all events, I trust, 
the canvass will be so conducted, should } r ou both be candi- 
dates, as to preserve your friendly relations, and the harmony 
of our friends in the District. I am confident from my per- 
fect knowledge of your character, and your devotion to our 
Cause and the principles on which it rests, that nothing will 
be wanting on your part to preserve the Union and harmony 
of our party, and friends. I am much gratified to learn, that 
the session terminated as well as it did. We at one time felt 
great anxiety at the State of things at Columbia. This is no 
time for discord in our ranks. The period is eminently peril- 
ous. I know from [an] unquestionable source, that it is con- 
templated to agitate the Slave question this Session. A Bill 
has already been prepared; and the member fixed on to intro- 
duce it; but it is still under consideration, at what time and 
in what manner, it shall be made. It comes from the Coloni- 
zation Society, and contemplates to emancipate the Slaves in 
the District immediately ; combined with a plan to colinize on 
a large Scale the free Blacks, anywhere, with the aid of the 
Government. Such a move, should it be made, as it is cer- 
tainly contemplated, can only be considered as the commence- 
ment of the work of immediate emancipation over the whole 
[of] the South, to which event it will certainly lead, if not 
promptly met by the entire slave holding states, with the 
fixed determination to resist at any hazard. We are aware of 
the danger, to which you allude, of our merging into one or 
both of the great parties now contending for the Presidency. 

i MeDuffie resigned from the House; Pickens was elected in his place, taking his seat 
December 8, 1834.

We are on our guard. You will see from the course of the 
Telegraph, that we are determined to preserve our seperate 
existence on our basis. If there is to be Union against the 
administration, it must be Union on our own ground; but of 
such Union I have but little hope. We are as wide as the 
poles. 

I intend to speak on the Bank question. It will probably 
be late in the debate. I intend to take distinct ground, such, 
as in my opinion, the question ought to be placed on. 

It seems to be conceded that there is a great pressure in the 
money market; and prices of all discription have fallen it is 
supposed from 10 to 20 percent. Good Judges suppose the 
depression in the price of cotton is at least equal 3 cents in 
the pound. This state of things has affected the popularity 
of the administration very considerably; particularly in Vir- 
ginia. 

I am in good health except a cold, which I have had ever 
since my arrival. 

Give my affectionate regards to M rs Pickens, and M rs Simp- 
kins and family; and tell Anna I will write to her the very 
first leisure moment. 



To Francis W. Pickens? 

Washington 20 th Jan y 1834 

MY DEAR SIR, I yesterday received your letter of the 6 th 
Ins*, and tho confidential, I took the liberty of showing it to 
M r . M c Duffie, as it appeared to me to be due to him that he 
should be apprised of its contents. 

I learn from him that shortly after the date of my former 
letter to you, in which I stated to you on the authority of M r . 
M c Duffie, that he would not be a candidate, he received letters 
from Judge Butler and M r . Brooks, stating that it was the 
desire of his constituents that he should not retire, and advis- 
ing him to comply with their wishes. His Answers, in which 
he declined changing the position which he had assumed not 
to be a candidate, could riot have been received at the date of 
your letter to me; so that the impression that he would not de-

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 329 

dine being a candidate must have been founded on inference 
on their part and not on any authority from M r . M C D. I pre- 
sume when his answers were received the impression would be 
corrected. M r . M C D., I feel confident, will not be a candidate 
unless indeed a state of things, not anticipated by him, would 
render it clearly his duty to remain at his present post, and 
which, if it should occur, would speak for itself, so that the 
field may be considered fairly opened. He has I have no 
doubt acted perfectly fair throughout, without the least desire 
to favour the pretention of any one at the expense of another; 
and that whatever appearance there may be to the contrary 
does not originate with him. Your course is an obvious one. 
The indications being so clearly in your favour, I would pass 
in silence, without apparently noticing the improper steps, 
which the too great eagerness on the part of any other to oc- 
cupy his place, may have induced them to take, however cal- 
culated to excite unpleasant feelings. Let nothing be wanting 
on your part, as far as is consistent with what is due to your- 
self and friends, to preserve the peace and harmony of the 
District, at this important crisis. 

I enclose my speech on the Deposit question. 1 I cannot say 
anything, which is better calculated to give you an idea of 
the great change of sentiment here than to tell you, that not- 
withstanding the nullification it contains, it has been well 
received here by all parties. 

Make my kind regards to James, Susan, and all of our rela- 
tions you may meet, not excepting Ezekiel, as wrong as his 
politicks are. 



To Christopher Van Deventer.* 

Washington 25 th Jan y 1834 

MY DEAR SIR, My arrangements have been such as to pre- 
vent me from acknowledging at an earlier period your letters 
of the 12 th Dec r and the 7 th Ins*. 

Things are far better, than you suppose. I entertain no 
doubt that the administration will be overthrown. It has 
already received its death blow. It will never be able to

extricate itself from its present difficulties, unless indeed by a 
sudden retreat, if that can. In the Senate, it is in a fixed 
minority, and its majority in the House is gradually giving 
away. You may put down the whole South as lost to the 
powers that be. I do not consider the question any longer to 
be the overthrow of the administration ; but what is to come 
up in its place. Of one thing you may rest assured, that our 
party will firmly maintain its position. We shall make no 
choice of evils. We have had enough of that. Others may 
rally on us, but we rally on nothing but our doctrines. My 
advice to all our friends is not to commit themselves to men. 
We have a great battle to fight for liberty and the Constitu- 
tion, and there is time enough to determine to whom the hon- 
ors shall be awarded. None of the persons, whom you have 
named have the least weight to the South. We know of no 
difference in their political principles. Better far better for 
us, that those in power should remain there against our con- 
sent, than that we shall put others there, who do not agree 
with us, with our consent. Our doctrines are spreading rap- 
idly, and you must not be surprised to see them in the ascend- 
ant before two years. The change here is immense since the 
last adjournment. 

As to myself, I never did, as far as I can judge, occupy a 
more elevated stand in the confidence of the intelligent and 
virtuous. The clouds are breaking away and my motives and 
character begin to be understood. I speak freely to an old 
friend. 

I send you a copy of my speech in pamphlet form on the 
deposit question. It has been, as far as 1 have heard, well 
received everywhere and by every party. 

I regret to hear of your bad health. Your system of farm- 
ing is so different from ours that I fear you would not find a 
more Southern residence favourable to your monied concerns. 
Unless you find your health absolutely to require a different 
climate, with your good prospect in a pecuniary point of view, 
I would not advise a change. 

Make my kindest and best respects to M rs Van Deventer, 
and your famil} T . 

Wishing you a speedy restoration of your health, with every 
other blessing, .... 



LETTEES OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 331 

To John Ewlng Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 30 th Jan y 1834. 

DEAR JOHN, I received your letter with the power and exe- 
cuted it and returned it immediately. The note is for a very 
short period, and you must begin immediately to make arrange- 
ments to meet it. Your sister writes, that M r Davis has ceased 
to work on my mill and Gin, and that neither of them are 
going. It is too bad. I fear that he will never finish unless 
he is perpetually urged. I must ask the favour of you to see 
him about it for me without delay; and to tell him my extreme 
anxiety to have them done; and that he must finish them with- 
out delay. Do see that he loses no time in completing them. 

I send you a copy of my speech on the deposite question. It 
has been well received by all and every where. Our Cause 
advances rapidly; and you must not be surprised that it should 
be in the ascendant in less than three years. Jacksonism is 
broke, and with it Van Buren and I trust his corruption. 

Remember me affectionately to Mother and your family. 



To James Edward CalJioun. 

Washington 8 th Feb 1834 

MY DEAR JAMES, I have attended to your request. 
I fear there is no hope of the impeachment; but that which 
you will think the next best event, the overthrow of Jackson- 
ism, is certain; and with it, Van Buren and his party. His 
partisans are falling off in every direction, and the process 
must continue to go on till he is utterly prostrated. The pfl*es- 
sure on the money market is great and growing, and must con- 
tinue to increase for months to come. It is causing dismay 
throughout the country. Thousands, who thought themselves 
rich, must fall. The South will suffer much less than the North. 
In the mean time, a great political revolution is going on. 
The feeling of the North towards the South is rapidly revers- 
ing. We and our doctrines are daily growing in favour; and 
thousands who but a few months since execrated us, now look 
to the South, not only for protection against the usurpation 
of the Executive, but also against the needy and corrupt in 
their own section. They begin to feel, what I have long fore- 
seen, that they have more to fear from their own people, than 



332 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

we from our slaves. The deposit question is still before us. 
There is a strong majority- for restoration in the Senate, say 
28 to 20; but in the House there is a small majority at present 
the other way. It will, I think, however, finally give away; 
but the Executive veto will, I suppose, arrest the restoration. 
What will ultimately be done is hard to say. My speech, of 
which I sent you a copy in pamphlet form, and now enclose 
another, for some of your neighbors, will give you my con- 
ception on the question. There is no alternative but hard 
money or a United States Bank. The country is not, I think, 
ripe for the first; and all that can be done is I apprehend to 
raise the value of gold to 16 to 1 so as to make it the metallick 
currency instead of silver, and fix some amount, say 10 or 20 $ 
below which no Bank bill shall be received into the Treasury. 
These with some other provisions having the same object in 
view, would be taking a great step toward a specie currency ; 
and will be going as far as we can for the present. I keep 
my ideas for the present to myself; but should there be an 
opening, I will move on them before the end of the session. 

As soon as the deposit question is disposed of, I will take 
up the bill to repeal the force act. Its fate is still uncertain. 

You must find your occupation delightful. I almost envy 
you. As long as I have been in publick life my attachment to 
agriculture is not in the least abated. With your fine planta- 
tion and various pursuits your time must be fully occupied and 
pass away agreably. 

I see you have resigned your commission, and I understand, 
from some one here, your pay is undrawn. In this, I think, you 
wrong. It will go to some one less deserving, and be no sav- 
ing to the country. What you do not take is not saved to the 
country. Send me a power, and I will draw it for you and 
you may take me, as your father Confessor, in the case. A 
letter would be sufficient, I suppose. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 16 th Feb 1834 

MY DEAR JAMES, . . . Our cause is growing daily. The 
deposit question is still before us and its fate uncertain. I 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 333 

have been turning my attention a good deal of late to the 
subject of correcting our currency. I believe the occasion 
favourable to a movement on the subject, and I will probably 
make one, the object of which will be to lay the foundation of 
a system by which we may return gradually to a specie cur- 
rency; at least, as far as the present state of the commerce 
and fiscal concerns of the world will admit. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 26 th March 1834 

MY DEAR JAMES, . . . You will find my speech on M r 
Webster's motion in tomorrows Telegraph. 1 It appeared in 
the daily to day, and will be published in the country tomor- 
row. It has been received here in a manner highly flattering 
by all parties. I hope it will ultimately lead to some useful 
result. The currency is getting into a sad condition. Yes- 
terday the announcement was made of the stoppage of payment 
by the bank of Maryland, and it is thought the Union bank of 
Baltimore will stop next. It is a pet Bank, and nothing but 
the heavy drafts of the Government in its favour has heretofore 
saved it. 

Our doctrines continue to gain ground. I would not be 
surprised if they be found in the ascendent in less than 2 
years. I will take up the Bill to repeal the force act, the first 
fair opening. 



To Miss Anna Maria Calhoun. 

Washington 3 d April 1834 
MY DEAR ANNA, 1 have received your letter of the 15 th 

March, as I do all of your letters, with a great deal of 

pleasure. 

You cannot imagine how much I am gratified to learn, that 

you bestow so much of your time and attention, and with so 

much success on your little scholars. I am sure that you will

find it, as pleasurable, as it is useful. You must tell them, 
how much I am pleased to learn, that they are fond of their 
books, and are learning so fast; and that I will bring out with 
me, when I return home, the prettiest books, that 1 can find 
in Washington for them. I am particularly gratified, that 
Cornelia has become fond of her books, as I had almost dis- 
paired, that she ever would. The mode that you have adopted 
proves, that you are not a little skilled in the knowledge of 
the operation of the human mind. 

Your mother, as well as yourself, writes me, that she devotes 
much of her time to the yard and garden, which I am veiy 
glad to learn, as I have no doubt it will contribute much both 
to her health and enjoyment. I hope that you will participate 
with her in the exercise, and the enjo} 7 ment. You must select 
the vines and shrubs for your particular care. I have no 
doubt, that your mother's management will quite discredit 
mine. Whatever she undertakes she does well. I sincerely 
wish, I were at home, and participating with you all in your 
employment and amusement, instead of going through the 
drudgery and confinement, which my duties compel me to do 
here. I have never been more anxious to return home and 
see you all ... 

As you are so much of a politician, I must give you all the 
political news, which, however, may be summed up in a few 
words; that things remain much, as they were a month since. 
It is very uncertain, what will be done; but if anything should 
be, it will be, I feel confident, in conformity with the sug- 
gestions, I made on M r Webster's motion, which have been 
well received on all sides. I enclosed Andrew a copy in 
pamphlet form, and now enclose you one also. I hope he has 
received his. 

Your mother wrote me to send her some more garden seeds. 
In my answer, I said I would send them in a few days, but 
you must say to her, that when I came to examine her list, I 
find that the season is too late for them; and therefore I do 
not think it worth while to send them. I will bring such of 
them, as may be sowed in the fall. Say to her also, that I 
have written to M r Bonneau to send her the Water melon seed, 
tho I think she will find a good supply of them among the old 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 335 

seed. I, at the same time, directed him to send up immedi- 
ately a quarter Cask of best Maderia. 

Give my love to all and particularly to your Grandmother. 
I am rejoiced to learn, that your Aunt Martha's health was so 
far restored, that she is out of danger. 

Write me often, and give me as much and minute news as 
my old friend D r Waddel would in telling one of his long 
stories. God bless you all. 



To Francis W. Pickens. 1 

Washington 15 th April 1834 

MY DEAR SIR, I am gratified to learn, that my remarks on 
the currency has been so well received both by you and our 
other friends in Carolina. As far as 1 have heard, it has been 
well received in every quarter and by all parties. If anything 
should be done, it will be on the basis which I suggest; but it 
is quite uncertain, whether anything can be for the present. 
In the mean time, the crushing of the Banks has commenced, 
and it is hard to say where it will end. None now remain but 
two in the District; the U. S. Branch and the pet Bank. The 
tide of public opinion, however, is turned against the admin- 
istration to the North, which with the fear of losing Virginia, 
has caused deep consternation in their ranks; but it is still 
doubtful whether they will persist in their course, or change 
their tack; and, if the latter, in what direction they will next 
move. 

You will have perceived by the papers, that the Bill to 
repeal the force act has been up for discussion. The Tele- 
graph contains my remarks, 2 by which you will see that my 
main effort was to show, that the act is repugnant to the 
nature of our institutions, by the plainest process I could 
adopt, and to prove by our past and present experience that 
its principles must prove distructive to our liberty, unless 
they be abandoned. I hope what I have said may give an 
additional impulse to the cause, which as far as I can learn, 
is on the advance in every quarter. As a proof, there was

yesterday a great festival of the party in Philadelphia. 
M c Duffie, Preston, and Poindexter attended. I declined from 
reasons, which you will readily understand. We have 
accounts that their reception was very enthusiastick. 

I forgot to say, my speech is very erroneously printed in 
the Telegraph, so much so as in some places to spoil the sense. 
It will appear in pamphlet form more correctly printed. I 
will send you a copy. 

It is quite uncertain when Congress will adjourn. I fear it 
will be late. 

Make my kind respects to M rs . P, M rs . Simpkins and family 
and your Father and Mother. I wrote to your Father and 
enclosed him a copy of my remarks on the currency, which I 
hope he has received. 



To Miss Anna Maria Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 14 th May 1834 

MY DEAR ANNA, Were it not for your letters, there are a 
thousand incidents that are daily occurring, where every inci- 
dent, even the smallest, is interesting to me, of which I should 
remain ignorant. Your Mother and Brother write me on 
grave subjects of business, or what relates to the welfare of 
the family ; but you fill up the interval with those little, but 
to me interesting details, which it is so agreeable to an absent 
father to know. Were it not for you, I would not have heard 
a word about the Humming birds, their familiarity, the vines, 
their blooms, the freshness of the spring, the green yard, the 
children's gardens, and finally Patrick's mechanical genius and 
his batteaux, every item of which excited agreeable associa- 
tions, but accompanied with the painful recollection of my 
long absence, from those so dear to me. I hope the period is 
now near at hand, that will put a termination to my absence. 
The House of Representatives will probably pass a resolution, 
fixing the 16 th of next month as the time of adjournment; and 
I trust, the Senate will concur in the time. If so, a month 
more, and my face will be turned homeward, to my great 
delight. We can for the present do little more, but to check 
the progress of usurpation, which I think has been pretty 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. OALHOUN. 337 

effectually done. At another session, I hope the country will 
collect the fruits. I had by the mail of the day before yester- 
day a letter from your Mother, and another from Andrew. 
They both write, that they will start to Columbia in a few 
days, and as they will not probably be back, as soon as a 
letter would reach home, I shall delay my answers to them a 
few days longer. Andrew writes, that you were writing by 
the same mail; but as your letter did not accompany theirs, I 
conclude, that you were not in time for the mail, and 1 of 
course expect to have one from you by the next mail from 
Pendleton. 

The gay season has passed in Washington. The strangers 
have in a great measure departed; and the questions, which 
caused so much excitement have been decided; so that we are 
comparatively in a calm. I would enjoy the relaxation; but 
the weather has been so bad, as to prevent exercise, and to 
give me a distressing cold, which now afflicts me. For the 
last week we have had high winds . . . This morning it is 
calm, but cloudy and cold. Should the weather have extended 
to the South, I fear the loss of the cotton crop will be the 
result. 

I hope your Uncle John brings good news from the mine. 
I feel anxious to hear from there, as I have not had a letter 
from M r Caldwell for several weeks. Either he has not writ- 
ten, or his letters have miscarried. Tell your Uncle, that I 
would be glad to hear from him immediately, how our affairs 
are doing in that quarter; and that I hope he will write me 
very fully; but as he may not be so prompt in writing, as he 
ought to be, you must get from him all the news and write 
me by the return mail. I enclose two copies of my remarks 
on the repeal of the force Bill, one for your Uncle and the 
other for yourself. 

Give my love to all. Do not fail to write, and tell me every 
thing. All will be interesting.

as to the currency this session. The administration is going 
down faster, than it ever rose. The Nationals, I find are as 
much inclined to extravagance in disbursements as ever. If 
the administration were out of the way, a conflict would be 
unavoidable with them on the appropriations, and I do not 
know, that it can be avoided as it is. We are determined to 
bring down the expenses of the Government to the lowest 
point, and with that view to retrench and economize, wher- 
ever it can be done without impairing the publick service. 
We pay, and it is right, that we should not be called on to pay 
a cent more, than is indispensible necessary. My belief is, 
that the Executive usurpations, which grew out of the usur- 
pations of Congress, are for the present pretty effectually 
checked, and cannot be again revived, but through a repe- 
tition of the latter. 

I enclose you copies of my speeches in pamphlet form on 
the repeal of the force act, and on the Protest. 1 The two taken 
together give a pretty full view of our system, as it regards 
the distribution of its powers, and the means of preventing 
the abuse of implied powers, and the conflict growing out of 
their exercise, between the Departments of the system. 



To Francis W. Pickens* 

Washington 5 th June 1834 

MY DEAR SIR, I see the court has decided against us; and 
the grave question is now presented what shall be done ? At 
this distance from the scene, it seems to me, that our course 
is clear. Take no rash or violent measure; do nothing that 
can excite sympathy for our opponents, or endanger the peace 
of the State; but direct our whole energy to the fall election. 
The all important point now is to get 2 3 of both branches of 
the Legislature. If we succeed in that, all will be safe; but 
if not, it will be impossible to do anything. With 2 ; 3 the 
Supremacy of the State will be quietly and effectively asserted, 
through every branch of the Government; and the State will 
successfully and honourabty terminate this great controversy by 

1 May 6, 1834. Works, II. 405^25.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 339 

effectually asserting her supreme authority. Let then every 
nerve be exerted to carry the fall election; but in the mean 
time, let all other movements be suspended. We cannot have 
a better issue. The appeal is to the people, on the question 
of their own supremacy. If allegiance be not due to them; or 
if, being due, they have not the sense, or sperit to assert their 
sovereign power, they are not worthy of it. Nor is this the 
only advantage. No issue can be better calculated to excite 
the sympathy of the other States, or to place our controversy 
in a more favourable point of view, before the whole Union. 
With this impression, I hope the Legislature will not be 
called; or, if it should be, nothing violent or rash will be 
attempted nothing, in a word, that will not be calculated to 
give us strength in the coming election. 

In what I have said, I speak, I am confident, the sentiment 
of our whole delegation here. 

Present my kind regards to M rs . P, M rs . Simkins and family 
and all friends; 



To Lewis S. Cory ell. 1 

Washington, 24th June, 1834. 

DEAR SIR, I rejoice to hear that the health of our friend 
Ingham is so completely restored. That he should regard ( ? ) 
the politicks of the times is not at all surprising. Nothing 
can be more base and servile, but there is a dawn of hope. 
The administration is certainly sinking fast in the South and 
more slowly elsewhere. The Southern Atlantick States will 
be united against them in less than a year. They never will 
be able to get through with the deposit question. It is a load 
too heavy for them. 

I wrote Mr. Ingham several weeks since. I have not 
learned whether he has received my letter. I will thank you 
to let me know should you see him at an early period, as I 
fear the mail may not be safe. I had a letter from him day 
before yesterday which I wish to answer through a safe 
channel. 

I enclose a copy of my speech on the deposit question.

To Lewis 8. Cor yell. 1 

Fort Hill 10th Aug. 1834. 

DEAR SIR, I am obliged to you for the information which 
you give, and the views you present. It would be a great and 
triumphant move to send Mr. Ingham 2 to the Senate in Wilke's 
place, but 1 fear he is too honest and virtuous for the State at 
present. Should, however, the Anti-masons favour him, as 
you suppose, it would make him very formidable, as neither 
party, I suppose, could carry their candidate against them. 

As it regards the next presidential election, I think, it may 
be assumed that the State Rights party of the South will rally 
on no man who does not openly avow and support their doc- 
trines. My impression is, that the true policy of the party is 
to stand fast on their principles, whether they fall or rise. 
Should they adopt that course, the current of events will, 1 
think, obviously take one of two courses. If the Administra- 
tion should succeed in N. York, the Nationals would receive 
their death blow, and the struggle would be between the 
Administration party and the State Rights; but on the other 
hand, should the Administration be defeated, their party 
would aim their final blow, and the struggle would be between 
the Nationals and the State Rights party. In neither event, in 
my opinion, could the friends of McLean be formidable. His 
position on the bench is bad for a candidate and the position 
taken by his friends not sufficiently well defined. He has no 
strength in the South. The party must ultimately rally on 
some other party and on more distinct ground. My advice to 
our friends everywhere is, to contend under their own colours. 
It is the manly course; and, as we have truth on our side, it 
must succeed. The South will soon be unanimous, and experi- 
ence has shown that when united they cannot be defeated.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 341 

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 20 th Sep r 1834 

MY DEAR SIR. I received your letter by Maj r . Davis a few 
days since, who has returned in good health and sperits, and, 
as I think, with a fair prospect of success, tho' he has been 
considerably weakened by his long and frequent absences from 
his constituents. Should he, however, be sufficiently busy 
between this and the election, he will make up for leeway, as 
his manners are very popular. 

Your remarks in reference to the course, that ought to be 
pursued by the nullification party in the next Presidential 
election, have been, as far as my information extends, well 
received by our party in this State, and throughout the South. 
They are at once manly, patriotick and wise. The only 
possible question that can be made is as to the time. Some 
may think them a little too early; but viewing the whole 
ground, I am of a contrary opinion. If it has weakened us 
in any degree with the Nationals, which I think doubtful, 
we are more than compensated in other quarters. Our true 
policy is to adhere rigidly to principle, and to keep our posi- 
tion well defined. 

I regret to see the course the Whig 2 is pursuing. It is calcu- 
lated to weaken both the Editor, and our party in Virginia. 
He appears to be ready to abandon the great right of State 
interposition, in favour of the phantom of strict construction 
a thing good in the abstract, but in practice not worth a far- 
thing, without the right of interposition to enforce it; as the 
experience of more than forty years has shown. Every body 
is for strict construction; M r Webster, M r Ritchie and all; 
but in fact, it will ever be found to be the construction of the 
permanent minority against the permanent majority, and of 
course of itself valueless. I consider his course, as calculated 
to cause much embarrassment in Virginia, and that if he per- 
sists in it, must finally throw himself and M r Leigh, if not

the State itself into the hands of the national Republicans. 
It is certain, it will not be supported by the State right party 
in the South. 

I consider the administration as substantially overthrown; 
and tho' it ought not to cause us to relax in putting down 
Executive usurpation and corruption, yet, to act wisely, we 
must bear it in mind, with all of its important consequences, 
in SLUJ Step, that we may take. I have no fear of our state 
election. We shall carry f of both Houses, and of course the 
constitutional amendment. I fear we will be beaten in Geor- 
gia, tho some of our friends there are sanguine. The contest 
there is turning more on principle, than it ever has in that 
state; and let the present election terminate as it may, I have 
no fear for the success of our party at the ensuing election. 
We have talents, youth, patriotism and truth on our side. I 
feel confident, that throughout the state of the young men 
of talents are with us. 

I wrote you some time since, and as you have no reference 
to my letter in yours, I fear that it has miscarried. I hope 
you may be able to make your arrangements to take your 
projected tour. I expect to set out with my family about the 
middle of Nov r , for Washington, by the way of Charleston 
and thence the steamship to Norfolk. We will be glad of 
your

DEAR GEN L , I expected to leave home on Thursday last by 
the rail road and steam Packet route, and of course to be in 
Washington nearly as soon as this; but have been detained by 
unavoidable business. As the Boat from Charleston to Nor- 
folk will not sail again till the 6 th Dec r I will not leave home 
till Thursday week and expect to be in Washington about the 
10 th or 11 th Dec r . 

We have not heard yet anything of the N. York election. 
Tomorrow's mail will probably bring the result of the contest 
in the city. Should the administration be decided!} 7 beaten

in the State Van Buren will be compelled to retire and the 
administration, as a party, will dissolve, which would change 
the whole aspect of the political horizon ; but should they suc- 
ceed, the contest will go on between them and the Nationals. 
The latter have gained too much strength, and are headed by 
leaders of too much ambition to retire from the contest with 
a growing cause, or rather appearantly a growing cause; for 
they no doubt will attribute their increased vote in Kentucky, 
Ohio, N. Jersey, Maryland, Pennsyl a and other States wholly 
to their own strength 

Till the result of the N. York election is fully known, and 
the temper of the parties ascertained, it will be difficult to 
say, what course a regard to duty and the success of the cause 
for which we contend will dictate. My impression is that 
the better course, till the whole grounds are fully ascertained, 
is "a wise and masterly inactivity;" not to move till we can 
fix the point of destination. I am still of the impression, that 
it is dangerous to touch the Presidential question, as yet. I 
Do not think the publick mind will bear movements in rela- 
tion to it, and of course those who attempt it will suffer. 

These are the views of one at a distance, and who has not a 
full and accurate view of the whole surface. They may be 
erroneous. I suggest them for your reflection; and if you 
think them correct to act on, at least till I can see you. 



To Samuel L. Gouverneur. 1 

Fort Hill 22 d May 1835 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have just heard from a respectable source, 
that a book is now writing at Washington under the auspices 
of Gen 1 Jackson and to be published when he retires, on the 
subject of the Seminole affair; in which an attack will be made 
both on M r Monroe's character and my own, and in which the 
affidavit of John Rhea is to form a prominent part. I deem 
it important to apprise you of the fact, that it is believed at 
Washington, that such a work is in progress. 

I had no doubt that any effort, that baseness and ingenuity

can devise will be resorted to induce you, by them, who believe 
that all are venial and base like themselves, to abandon the 
defense of M r Monroe, but 1 feel perfectly confident without 
the slightest effect. Gen 1 Jackson feels deeply mortified with 
the situation he occupies in relation to the affair; and is deter- 
mined that nothing shall be omitted to reverse it if possible 
in the eyes of posterity. As to myself individually I certainly 
can have no objection that he should renew his attack on me 
in relation to it. He has heretofore gained nothing by his 
attacks, and I shall take care, if he should renew it, not to let 
him off as easily as I have in the correspondence. 

I would be glad to hear from you, and to learn, whether you 
have any information as to the supposed contemplated publi- 
cation, and in particular who is to be the author. 

Mrs. C. joins her best respects to yourself and Mrs. G. 



To Duff Green.* 

Fort Hill 30 th Aug*. 1835 

DEAR SIR, I am gral ; fied, but not surprised, to learn the 
change of sentiment to the North in reference to our doctrines. 
I have never doubted, that the great truths developed in our 
controversy would work their way in spite of all the difficul- 
ties, they had to encounter. In forming my opinion, I relied 
not on the force of reason, for that can have but little weight 
against the resistance of interest and prejudice, but on the 
disorders and finally disasters which must follow the opposite 
doctrines. All my anticapations have been realized, and more 
than realized, and unless there be a thorough reformation will 
be realized even to the establishment of military despotism, 
or the disunion of these states. One, or the other or both 
must follow without a great and timely change. The first 
victims would be the wealthy and talented of the North. We 
of the South are by far the most safe. The intelligence of 
the North must see this, but whether in time to save them- 
selves and the institutions of the Country God only knows. 
But whenever their eyes may open, they will be astonished to

find that the doctrines which they denounce as treason are 
the only means of their political salvation, while those, which 
they so fondly hugged to their bosom were working their 
certain distraction. 

Since you passed through the South the excitement in rela- 
tion to the Northern fanaticks has very greatly increased. 
The indications are, that the South will be unanimous in their 
resistance, and that the resistance will be of the most deter- 
mined character, even to the extent of disunion, if that 
should be necessary to arrest the evil. I trust, however, it 
may be arrested far short of such extremity. Your early 
anticipation of the danger, and timely and continuous warning 
begins to be just appreciated. 

I am very glad to hear, that your prospects are so good ; and 
hope that }^ou have succeeded to your entire satisfaction in 
closing your arrangement. You, of course, must be the best 
judge of what your interest requires; and that with your 
large family ought not to be neglected; but it seems to me in 
all your arrangement it ought to be borne in mind, that the 
present state of things cannot continue. Reform, or revolu- 
tion must take place; nor can the alternative be long delayed. 
Either must have a most important bearing on your future 
interest, and ought to be kept in view in all your arrange- 
ments. You would certainly greatly strengthen yourself, if 
you should succeed in associating M r Cralle with yourself. 
He has talents and honesty, and is universally esteemed by 
the friends of Constitutional liberty. D r . Gibson is no doubt 
abundantly qualified to conduct the paper at Washington, and 
is worthy of entire confidence; but it seems to me, that if he 
should be left in charge of the paper at Washington it ought 
instead of a weekly paper to be issued twice a week. It will 
be impossible to crowd into a weekly paper all the matter 
that ought to appear, particularly during the session; and if 
it were, still the people would prefer dividing the reading 
into two periods, rather than to receive it all at once. Be- 
sides, if the paper be but once a week, most of its news will 
be old. From these considerations, I am decidedly of the 
opinion, that 9 readers in 10 would rather take a paper twice 
a week and pay the additional price, than once a week; and

that considered merely as [a] monied affair it ought not to 
issue less frequently. 

We are all well, and I will be glad to hear from you as often 
as you may find it convenient to write.

MY DEAR SIR, ... I am glad to hear your meeting went 
off so well. Ours went off as well as it possibly could. Union- 
ism is extinct in our state I think. I see my way clearly on 
the Slave question and I do not fear an entire triumph on our 
own conditions; to be followed by unbounded prosperity in 
the South and a universal rise in property of every kind. . . . 



To J. 8. Williams.^ c. c. 

Fort Hill 17 th Oct r 1835 

DEAR SIR, I have received your two pamphlets, containing 
the account of the proceedings at Cincinnati, in reference to 
the projected rail road between that place and Charleston, 
which I have read with great pleasure. 2 The meeting takes a 
different view of the route from the one, which 1 suggested, in 
my letter to you. It certainly has the advantage of being far 
more direct, and of passing through a large tract of interest- 
ing country, which now is almost shut out from Market. Not 
being locally acquainted with the projected route, I had sup- 
posed from my general conception as well as from the inspec- 
tion of the map of the country, that very formidable, if not 
insurmountable difficulties, would have to be encountered in 
Crossing the mountains in that direction. I hope my impres- 
sion is erroneous. The country certainly deserves a careful 
recognisance, and, if a rail road be practicable on the route, it 
has many and powerful recommendations. The road would 
pass through the entire length of this State, say 250 miles 
nearly half of the entire distance, and, I think I may say with 

1 From a draft in Calhoun's handwriting.

letters relate. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 347 

confidence, that if Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, 
through which it would pass, and which have a deep interest 
in its execution, will execute the portion which maybe within 
their respective limits, South Carolina will meet our Western 
brethren on her Northern and Western limits with a well 
executed rail road to her commercial capital. 

But, if the difficulty should be as great on the route as I 
supposed, still the great object of uniting the West and the 
Southern Atlantick ports by rail road ought not, and, I trust, 
will not be abandoned. Its practicability on the route I sug- 
gested cannot be doubted. Since I wrote you, I have acquired 
still farther information of the country in that quarter. A 
Gentleman, well acquainted with it, informs me, that there is 
the prospect of an excellent route direct from Athens to the 
Tennessee River, just below the Lookout mountain, and that 
the distance between the two points does not exceed 150 miles 
making the distance from Charleston to that point but 366 
miles, and of course will greatly shorten the one I suggested, 
and fall more within the scope of the project contemplated at 
your meeting. Should both routes prove practicable, I see 
no reason why one should superceede the other. The extent 
of country to be accommodated, and which would have a par- 
ticular interest in one, or the other route, gives ample scope 
for both. The great point is, that rivalry and conflict should 
not be permitted to defeat the grand design of uniting the 
two sections, on the execution of which the prosperity of 
so large a portion of the Union depends, and which is calcu- 
lated to exercise so powerful and beneficent influence over the 
future destiny of our country and its institutions.

the late triumph in Maryland, 1 by those opposed to the Execu- 
tive Nominee. The great distance and the shortness of the 
time puts it out of my power to attend. 

No one can look with greater alarm, than I do, on the attempt 
of the Chief Magistrate to appoint his successor. Should it 
succeed, open and undisguised as it is, and resting, as it almost 
exclusively does, on the avowed subserviency of the nominee 
to the will of the President, without those high qualifications 
and services, on his part, calculated to command the regard of 
the people, or to fit him for the duties of the high office to 
which he aspires, it would afford conclusive proof of the con- 
sumation of Executive usurpation, over the other Depart- 
ments of the Government, and the Constitution and liberty of 
the people. Entertaining these views, I regard with pleasure 
the decided victory achieved by Maryland in the late election, 
over the Presidents nominee, and of course, over Executive 
dictation. It is the more honorable to the state, placed as she 
is so near the focus of influence and corruption, while others 
more remote and less exposed have yielded such ready obedi- 
ence to the nod of power. Her victory cannot but have an 
important bearing, in deciding the present struggle favourably 
to the cause of liberty; but a regard to truth compels me to 
say, that, in my opinion, whatever may be the result of the 
pending contest between the people and the President, the 
time must come, and that far sooner than it is anticipated, 
when Executive influence and power will forever silence the 
popular voice; unless, indeed, the friends of liberty and free 
institutions shall Zealously and honestly unite in a common 
effort to eradicate the causes, which have given such extraor- 
dinary power and influence to the Executive Depart, of the 
Government, and placed the Country in its present dangerous 
condition. They may be almost all traced to the same origin, 
the fiscal action of the Government. 

While millions on millions are heaped up in the Treasury, 
beyond the expenditure of this, the most extravagant of all 
administrations, constituting an immense fund to act on the 
cupidity of the mercenary, and to unite in one solid and com- 
pact band all, in and out of office, who prefer their own

advancement to the publick good, any attempt to arrest the 
progress of power and corruption must end in disappointment 
and failure. It will be found almost impossible to elect honest 
and capable men, or, if such should be elected, to administer 
the Government honestly and fairly, or with a single eye to 
the public interest. Here lies the root of the disease, and 
if there be not intelligence and patriotism enough to apply a 
remedy, it requires not the gift of prophesy to predict the end, 
whatever may be the termination of the present presidential 
Struggle. I do not by these remarks intend to damp the 
ardour of those, who are at present so Zealously and honorably 
engaged in defeating executive interference and dictation, in 
what belongs exclusively to the free and voluntary choice of 
the people. 

My object is far different; to elevate their views to the real 
cause of the disease, and to direct their aim to the point, where 
every blow would tell, and where victory, when achieved, 
instead of being temporary, would be complete and permanent. 



To William C. Dawson.* c. c. 

Fort Hill 24 th Nor r 1835 

MY DEAR SIR, I take the liberty of writing to you, to call 
you attention to a subject, which I believe to be intimately 
connected with the great question of internal imp ts that now 
excites so much attention, both in this State and Georgia; I 
mean the distribution of the Surplus revenue. I do sincerely 
believe, that a judicious system of rail roads would make 
Georgia and Carolina the Commercial centre of the Union 
and the two most prosperous and influential members of the 
Confederacy. To the execution of such a system, I see but 
two impediments, the want of concert, and the want of funds. 
To resort to taxes, or to incur debts, or, what is the same 
thing, pledge the faith of the State, there are great objections. 
Among others, their certain tendency would be to create 
parties and finally to distract and debilitate the action of the

States. It is in our power to avoid this danger. There is an 
immense surplus revenue in the Treasury, which must annu- 
ally increase till the year 1842, when by the provision of the 
compromise bill the revenue will be brought down to the con- 
stitutional and economical wants of the Government. Till 
then, it will be found utterly impracticable to reduce the 
revenue, faster than is already provided for, except on a 
few inconsiderable articles, that will not equal a reduction 
of $500,000 annually. The surplus by the 4 th March 
next will equal about $25,000,000, and the whole surplus, 
in the next six years will be not short of seventy or eighty 
millions. The Share that would fall to Carolina and Georgia 
will not be short of $3,500,000 cash; a sum, if properly applied 
by subscribing into incorporated Companies and selling out 
when the work is completed, and reinvesting in others, in the 
same way, that would be sufficient to finish any work of 
importance in the two States, and to give them a system of 
intercourse most perfect in the world. Fortunately there is 
one great work, in which both States have an equal interest, 
and to which their attention ought in the first instance to be 
mainly directed, without being distracted with minor objects; 
I mean the extension of the Union, or Athens rail road to the 
Tennessee near the head of steamboat navigation, thence to 
Nashville at the head of steam boat navigation on the Cumber- 
land; thence cross the Ohio above the mouth of the Cumber- 
land, and thence to the Mississippi opposite to the mouth of 
the Missouri. This route, with a branch to the Chattahooche, 
at or near Columbus to meet the projected rail roads from 
Montgomery and Pensacola; another down the Tennessee to 
meet the Decature rail road round the Muscle Shoals and thence 
by the projected rail road to Memphis; another between the 
Tennessee and Nashville to Cincinati, and finally one from 
where it crosses the Ohio to lake Michigan, would be the most 
important and magnificent work in the world. The main 
routes with the local branches would I believe to be over 
ground highly favourable; and with the cooperation of the 
States immediately interested aided by the surplus revenue, 
to be easily executed in a few years. 

To make this great fund available, for so important an 
object, the legislatures of the states interested ought to move 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 351 

forthwith. I hope Georgia will take the lead. The action of 
no other state could have half the influence. Your presi- 
dential vote is considered doubtful, and you will not be at a 
loss to understand, what influence that fact would have both 
with the administration and opposition. The adoption of a 
resolution to instruct your Senators and request your mem- 
bers to vote for a resolution reported by the Special Commit- 
tee at the last session to amend the Constitution, so as to 
distribute the Surplus revenue till the year '42, l I do believe 
would have a decisive effect. I know of no one who could 
introduce it with more propriety than yourself. The move- 
ment could not fail to succeed. The Union party could not 
with propriety vote against it. Their Constituents would be 
greatly benefited by its success. The distribution has been 
twice recommended by Gen 1 Jackson in his anual Messages, 
when the surplus was relatively small and the publick debt 
not paid. M r King, your Senator, was on the Comittee that 
reported the Resolution and gave it his support. Under these 
circumstances, they would hardly venture, I would suppose, 
to oppose it, as a party; but if they should, I cannot but think, 
it would give our party a decided advantage with the people. 

In addition to these powerful considerations you might urge 
in favour of the adoption of the resolution, the still higher 
considerations connected with the purity of the Government 
and the preservation of our political institutions, which were 
set forth in the report of the Committee. 

Should you agree with me you are at liberty to show this 
communication to M r King, M r Black, M r Alford, or any 
other of our friends, that you may think proper, or to make 
any other use of it that you may judge prudent and expedient. 

I would be very glad to hear from you. I will be in Colum- 
bia about the 3 d Dec r , where I will remain three or four days, 
and where I would be very happy to receive a letter from you. 
At this great juncture, the cooperation of the two States, is 
of the utmost importance both for their safety and prosperity. 
Every prejudice and hostile feeling ought to be laid aside; 
and he who would oppose their harmony and concert of action, 
ought to be denounced as their most deadly enemy.

Fort Hill 24 th Nov r 1835 

MY DEAR SIK, Knowing your ]ust influence in the State, 
and particularly with our party, I have taken the liberty of 
enclosing a copy of a letter to M r Dawson, on the great sub- 
jects of internal improvement and the distribution of the Sur- 
plus revenue, which are intimately connected. Should you 
accord in the views I take, I hope you will give them your 
active cooperation and influence. Letters from you to our 
friends in the Legislature could not fail of having a very 
happy effect. 

There never was such a juncture for the two States. By 
proper exertions they may turn half of the commerce of the 
Union through their limits. Do cast your eyes on the map, 
and see the immense extent of country, which the route I 
suggest, with its various branches, connected with the navi- 
gable Streams, which it intersects, or connects, and, I think, 
you will agree with me, that there is nothing in the world like 
it. The advantages of New York are not to be compared 
with it. This splendid work, with all its branches may be 
easily executed with the funds, which the distribution of the 
Surplus revenue, would place in the hands of the States 
immediately interested. 

Let me entreat you to use your influence with such men, as 
Cumock and Dearmg to lay aside all narrow views, and to 
give to the road under their charge such a construction, as 
will make it a part of one great road of uniform construction, 
that will give ready transmission, without break or hindrance, 
to the immense intercourse, which must take place with such 
a work, between the West and the Southern Atlantick ports. 
The want of uniformity of structure would only tend to check 
the intercourse and turn the tide in other directions, and with 
it, the mighty flood of prosperity, that is ready to break in 
on the two States, if we should act as we ought. 

I would be very happy to hear from you.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 353 

To F. Carter ? c. c. 

Fort Hill 26 th Novf 1835 

MY DEAR SIR, Enclosed you will find copies of two letters 
to M r Williams, and one to yourself in reference to the rail 
road to the West, which I am happy to see begins to excite 
so much interest both in this State and Georgia. It is clear 
the time of action has arrived, and I was very anxious to see 
and have a full conversation with you before the meeting of 
your Legislature, and it was mainly with this view, that I 
proposed to meet you at the mines. 

I am very much gratified, that the Governor takes such cor- 
rect views in relation to the subject, and feels so much zeal 
in its execution. No one can have a greater and more salu- 
tary influence in reference to it. With his cooperation, this 
most important of all works may be kept above the influence 
of party and local feelings. On this subject let Carolina and 
Georgia be one. With such Union on it and the questions in 
reference to Slavery, we may divide on ordinary political sub- 
jects without any great injury to the Country; or at least, I 
hope, without fatal consequences. 

Should the State not undertake the work, I do hope, that 
yourself, Dearing and some half dozen more of Strong Capi- 
talists, who have the publick confidence, will take a charter to 
execute a rail road in extension of the Athens rail road to the 
Western limits of your State, with the view of completing 
the connection between the Savannah and Tennessee rivers. 
The State would no doubt grant a liberal charter, should she 
decline acting in order to effect so patriotick, and so impor- 
tant an object. With such a charter, I have no doubt, that a 
private company would be found abundantly competent to 
execute the work. So small would be the expense compared 
to the prospect of the profit, that, when the subject came to 
be well understood, capital to any amount may be commanded. 
I would suggest, then, if the State declines, that such a com-

aid of the company, and when that is done, and the plan and 
estimates are completed, let an able memoir be drawn up pre- 
senting fully its advantages and future prospects, and there 
would be not the least fear of means. The stock might be 
disposed of at a high premium, or additional stock holders 
might be admitted on such terms, as might be prescribed. In 
the mean time, the company might secure all the collateral 
advantages, such as purchasing all the favourable sites and 
such property as would be greatly enhanced by the execution 
of the work. 

I do not think that a single track, (which ought first to be 
executed) would be much more expensive than a paved turn- 
pike, if judiciously executed. There is the greatest abun- 
dance of timber on the spot, and the ravines and depressions 
might be passed on substantial frame work, to be filled up at 
leisure, as far as may be desirable, after the road is com- 
pleted, as they are now doing on the Charleston road. By 
this means a proper elevation might be kept at a moderate 
expense comparatively and the road be brought into speedy 
and profitable operation. 

I had a great deal of conversation with M r Boyce, 1 after 1 
left you in reference to the road, and he agrees fully in all 
these views. You know, that he has a sound, cautious judge- 
ment and has a good deal of experience on .the subject of rail 
roads; and he, Gn 1 Hamilton 2 and many of our most worthy 
and respectable citizens, I have no doubt, would be glad to be 
considered among the original Stock holders. 

I confess, 1 have fears, if your state should undertake it 
every thing would run into party operations, to the neglect 
and ruin of the work. There is a strong tendency in your 
political system to violent party conflicts. 

Should the State not act, and you should concur in these 
views, I would advise a free and full conversation with M r 
Bearing, and, if you and he should concur in opinion, to asso- 
ciate such individuals as you may think fit, and apply for the 
Charter from the termination of the Athens rail road to your 
western limits without designation of any particular part.

Tennessee or Alabama, as the case may be, would doubtless 
give a charter to the Tennessee River. If you should apply, 
write me immediately, and I will have a free conversation 
with Boyce, Hamilton and others of our friends here, who 
may desire [to] join in the work. If you can get the charter, 
I will answer for it, that the work goes through with all of its 
mighty advantages to the country and a corresponding profit 
to those, who will have the honor of commencing and complet- 
ing it. I entertain not the least doubt, that when the route is 
laid out, and the plans and estimates are formed, that, if it 
should be thought advisable, the whole Stock might be dis- 
posed of at an advance, reserving to the original company all 
the sites and property that they may choose to purchase on 
the routes, which of itself would be of an immense value. At 
all events, if I should mistake, there would be but little loss, 
even if the charter should have to be abandoned. I would be 
delighted to have a few hours conversation with you and 
Bearing together in reference to this great and patriotick 
undertaking. I have not the pleasure of a personal acquaint- 
ance with him, but from what I have heard of his character, 
I have a very favourable opinion of him; and with you, he and 
Boyce with a few other strong capitalists, at the head of a 
small but well selected company, every thing may be done. 
I intend to go to the mines some time between the 5 and 10 th 
Nov r and I still hope you may both make it convenient to meet 
me there. If you agree to do so and will fix the day, I will 
be punctual. You are at liberty to show M r Bearing what 
1 have written or any other friend in whom you may have 
entire confidence. 

I have no doubt the arrangement you propose to make in 
reference to the mines is a judicious one. I am glad to learn 
that you have so good a prospect of obtaining for us the turn 
pike charter and the Spring. They are both, I doubt not, 
valuable property. In all things, as far as my individual 
interest in your quarter is concerned, I put entire confidence 
in you and Cap*. Clay. I will cheerfully give, whatever 
information I may get, that may have a bearing on your West- 
ern purchases, and which I may communicate with propriety. 

I cannot doubt, but that a treaty to obtain the Texas, should 
one be made on anything like fair terms would be ratified,

and carried into execution. Should it not, political jealousy 
would be the cause, which, in the present state of the publick 
feelings, would put an end to the Union. 

Should a conflict take place between Mexico and Texas, I 
deem it much more probable, that the latter would conquer 
the former, than the reverse; so great and extensive would be 
the sperit of volunteering, should land be offered as an induce- 
ment in Texas, as I doubt not it would. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Washington 24 th Jan y 1836 

MY DEAR SIR. I was much gratified with the contents of 
your letter and hope you may realise your anticipations. 

I send you a copy of my speech on the French question. 
It was made on the Spur of the occasion. I was compelled to 
acquiesce in M r Buchanan's indorsement for the Senate, or 
signify my dissent. I did not hesitate, as bold as the move 
was. I stood alone. The Senate I fear is subdued. I never 
saw so little sperit in the body. There has, however, sprung 
up a fine sperit in the house among the young men from the 
South and West. I have long looked to them to reform the 
country, and now, that all the leaders of the Nat. Republican 
party have withdrawn from the House, the lead in the oppo- 
sition has fallen into proper hands, the } r oung and the daring 
from the only section, that can overthrow an administration. 
Among this band Wise has taken a noble stand. He has made 
the most effective speech ever delivered against the Adminis- 
tration. It was full of disclosures shameful to the party, and 
told with great boldness and point. I look on the movement 
in the House as the commencement of a new era. Your pres- 
ence is greatly needed. The Telegraph in your absence is 
far from being effective. The period has arrived, when bold 
and decided movements must be made. On your return, 
arrangements must be made for effective operations through 
the press here. Can you not associate Cralle with you, and 
take charge between you of both the Telegraph and the Sun ? 
They would present a powerful point from which to act. As

the nationals go down, we must come into action. The final 
and successful resistance must be with us. Our principles 
only can overthrow power. 

I see Pleasants has printed, what I said on the French ques- 
tion, without a single remark. What does it mean? Is he 
airraid to speak out on the question ? If so, it would show a 
fearful state of things in Virginia. 

I fear, that M r Leigh and M r Tyler, may act differently 
under their instructions, should instructions come, which could 
not but be disasterous to our cause in the state. I think M r 
Leigh has taken his ground firmly not to obey, at least at 
once. It is highly desirable that the two Senators should 
act together, and it seems to me a mutual ground may be 
found. In voting for M r Clay's resolution, they voted under 
instructions, or what amounted to it, and if they should be 
instructed to expunge, it would [be] instruction against instruc- 
tion, and would constitute, it seems to me, a fair occasion to 
make the appeal to the people, at the approaching election. 
Let their resignation abide that event, on an able communica- 
tion to the Gov r . on receiving the instructions. I know you 
cannot act in relation to it, but you might suggest these views 
to some of our friends. I think it is the only safe course and 
the one that would meet with the approbation of our friends 
here. 1 



To Christopher Van Deventer* 

Washington 7 th Feb: 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, A great pressure of business has prevented 
me from answering your letters at an earlier date. I am ex- 
ceedingly gratified to hear that your health is better, and do 
hope that a Kind Providence may long spare you for the bene- 
fit of your family and friends. My own health remains good, 
fully as much so, as when we last parted. 

You give a fearful picture of the progress of the Fanaticks, 
which is confirmed from every quarter we hear in the North. 

1 In February, 1836, the legislature of Virginia instructed her two Senators to vote for 
the " expunging resolutions." Judge B. W. Leigh refused to do so; Senator John Tyler, 
revering the doctrine of instructions, but unwilling to vote for the resolutions, resigned 
rather than to comply. Tyler, Letters and Times of the Tylers, I, 522-538.

1 fear a direct issue between them and us cannot long be de- 
layed an issue, which, if it does not rend our political fab- 
rick asunder, will shake it to the centre. 

I made a few days since a report on the part of the Presi- 
dent's Message, which relates to incendiary publications, in 
which I have discussed some very important points. The 
report, I think, was well received on all sides. I will send 
you a copy as soon as it is printed, which I hope will be to- 
morrow. 1 

The prospect -of peace has hightened. The mediation is 
said to be accepted, of which, however, there is no official 
information. I trust it is true, and that it will save us from 
the disasters and folly of a French war. 

The times are daily becoming worse. This }^ear is more 
corrupt and sycophantick than the last, and I fear the next will 
be more so than this. God only knows what is to become of 
the country. Without a timely and thorough reform all will 
be lost, for which our fathers fought and bled. 

Anna, who is with me, joins her kind regards to yourself, 
M rs V. and family. 

Wishing you an improvement of health, and long continu- 
ance of life, I remain 



To James If. Hammond. 2 

Washington 19 th June 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, Since you left us, as short as is the period, a 
very great change has taken place in the aspect, if not the con- 
dition, of parties. I had for weeks perceived, that some thing 
was going on; but was not aware of the extent of the change, 
till the bill for the regulation of the deposites was brought up. 
You will remember, that I reported the bill at the last Session 
from the select Committee on Executive patronage. 3 Itt hen 
passed the Senate and was sent to the other House, where it 
remained till the end of the Session without being taken up. 
I introduced it on leave in the early part of this Session, and

LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 359 

while I was waiting for a favourable opportunity to take it 
up, the opposition in the Senate sunk to a minority. Seeing 
after this, that there was no opportunity of passing it without 
the aid of the administration party, I seized on the first suit- 
able occasion to announce my intention of abandoning the bill, 
and throwing the deposit question, wholly on the responsi- 
bility of the administration and their party. The result of 
that announcement was the offer by M r Wright, a few days 
after, of a substitute by the way of amendment for the 
bill, and which in addition to the provisions to regulate 
the banks of deposites, contained provisions to dispose 
of the surplus revenue by vesting it in state securities. 
I seized on this movement, and offered an amendment to my 
bill, providing that the surplus should be deposited in the 
Treasury of the several states rateably on condition of return- 
ing it without interest when required. I soon saw, that M r 
Wright became shy of the subject, and was indisposed to call 
up the bill in conformity to his promise. After much delay, 
I decided to call it up myself. In his opening speech, I 
clearly saw, that his intention was to get clear of the subject 
altogether, tho' he professed a strong desire, that something 
should be done. I determined to act on his professions, and 
not his real intention, and accordingly joined him in a tone of 
great moderation in the expression of an equally strong desire 
that something should be done, and a determination on my 
part to sacrifice anything except principle to effect so desir- 
able an object. The result, after some remarks from M r 
Webster and others, was the appointment of a special Com- 
mittee of 9, on my motion, from all the parties in the Senate, 
of which M r Wright was chairman. The Committee with 
great unanimity reported an amendment, as a substitute for 
the bill, on the principle and with most of the leading details 
of the original bill, and my amendment, but with important 
modifications in some particulars. M r Wright's desire to 
defeat the bill and amendment now became very apparent; 
but after every expedient he could devise for that purpose, 
the bill was ordered to a third reading on thursday last, by a 
vote of 40 to 6, the latter consisting of M r Wright, M r Ben- 
ton M r Grundy M r Cuthbert, and the two Mississippi Sena- 
tors for special reasons arising out of some difficulty in their 



360 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

state Constitution. The next day after this remarkable vote, 
the real state of things in the Senate, disclosed itself on the 
question of the passage of the bill. It was furiously opposed 
by Benton and artfully, but earnestly by Wright. This 
brought out Rives and Tallmadge, Wright's Colleague, in a 
warm and eloquent defence of it, on the old doctrines of the 
Republican party, of economy, retrenchment, and decidedly 
attacking the extravagance of the appropriations passed and 
contemplated, as well as M r Benton's gold Humbug. The 
bill, after the debate closed, passed 38 to 6, M r Naudain of 
Dele ware having resigned, and M r Morris being accidentally 
absent. Yesterday a motion was made in the House to take 
up the bill, and tho' it was the day for private bills and had 
of course to encounter some opposition from that cause, the 
vote stood 130 for taking up and 70 against. It will be taken 
up on Monday, and there can be no doubt, I think, of its 



The effect has been a complete disorganization of parties 
for the present. The President is furious, and threatens to 
veto the bill, should it pass, but I have no fears of that. The 
Globe took a decided stand against it, and M r Van Buren is 
understood to be warmly opposed; but all in vain. The 
schism may not be permanent, but I am inclined to think it 
lies pretty deep, and will not be easy to heal. There is 
unquestionably a good deal of rivalry and jealousy between 
the interests of Rives and Benton, which tend strongly to dis- 
tract the party ; and to which a good deal of what has occured 
may be attributed. But there is another and more powerful 
cause of distraction, which begins to disclose itself; I refer to 
the growing conflict between the more honest portion of the 
party, and the real plunder and humbug portion, who are 
willing to go all lengths. They have arrived at the point at 
which it is difficult for these two portions to go on together 
much longer. 

Looking over the whole ground, 1 am inclined to think, 
that we are at the commencement of events which must lead 
to important and salutary changes, if we act with moderation 
and prudence. It is said Gen 1 Jackson threatens to veto the 

1 See E. G. Bourne, History of the Surplus Revenue of 1837. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 361 

bill should it pass. 1 cannot think he will, and, if he should, 
I think, it will only accelerate the Overthrow of those in 
power. The result would not be so speedy, but would be no 
less certain, should the bill become a law. At this interesting 
stage of our affairs, I cannot but regret your absence from 
the councils of the Union. It is the more to be regretted, at 
this time, not only on account of the importance and delicacy 
of the juncture, but because we are so weak in the House. 
Pickens' health is still delicate, which prevents his constant 
attendance, and Thompson leaves this with his family for 
Carolina this evening, on account of unfavourable intelligence 
in relation to the health of M rs Thompson's mother. 

Should you see Hamilton before you sail do not forget to 
say to him, that I am extremely anxious to see him on many 
accounts, and that he must expedite his visit here as much as 
possible. 

I hope your health has improved, and that you met your 
family in health, and entirely recovered from the effects of 
their rough passage. I would be glad to hear from you before 
you sail, and as often as you can make it convenient while 
abroad. 



To Armixtead 

Washington 28 th June 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received from M r Overton what he 
estimates to be due to my brothers, and will bring it out 
with me. 1 expect to leave here Friday, or Saturday next 
and probably may take Abbeville in my way. I take the 
Salisbury route. 

1 am gratified to hear that my constituents so generally 
approve. of my course. I am of the impression, that much has 
been effected during the Session. We stand stronger than 
we ever did on the Slave question. The South is more united, 
and the nature of the question is better understood both north 
and South than it has ever been. But we must not relax. 
The abolitionists are numerous, zealous and active. They 
have a powerful press and abundant funds. But it is not only

on the Slave question, that we have gained. The bill regu- 
lating the deposites and disposing of the Surplus, which has 
become a law, will do much to restore the ascendancy of the 
States, and effect a deep political reform. It is the most 
decisive measure that has ever been adopted to regulate the 
Government. It is the consummation of the action of our 
State. No measure has for a long time been received with 
such universal joy. 

Make mine and Anna's best and kindest respects to Martha. 



To James H. Hammond.^ 

Senate Chamber 4 th July 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, We are within a few minutes of the adjourn- 
ment sine die; and I expect to take my departure home in the 
course of the day. I have but a few minutes to devote to 
dropping you a line to acknowledge 3^our last. 

The deposite bill has already begun its salutary work. It 
has limited the appropriations by many millions; but they 
are still great, about $35,000,000. The Surplus to be depos- 
ited with the States will be about an equal Sum. We adjourn 
under very favorable auspices. Party discipline is broke and 
I trust before you return, the great work of reform will have 
made great progress. By that time I trust that your health 
will be completely reinstated, so that we may have your aid 
in accomplishing the great work. The deposite act consu- 
mates our Carolina movements, and I feel increased confidence, 
it will effect all that its friends contemplated. 

You must write me often and fully. Let me have your 
impressions on all you see and hear. 

With ardent wishes for the complete restoration of yours 
and M rs Hammonds health and your safe return I remain your 
friend.

ority of the route by the Carolina gap. You must make a 
movement at Abbeville. I wrote to Patrick Noble about it, 
but you know he wants energy. I also wrote to Francis Pick- 
ens to give the impulse at Edgefield. We have had a meeting 
at old Pendleton. It will be followed up by meetings at 
Pickens and Anderson. We must have able directors from 
this side. M c Duffie must be one. You and our friends must 
insist on his subscribing the 50 shares to qualify himself for 
the place. With proper efforts the road may be taken this 
way; and if it should, I do not doubt that it will be the best 
stock in the State. I feel confident that $6,000,000, by the 
Carolina gap will carry it from Charleston to the Ohio such 
is the great facility of the route. 

We are all well and all desire their love. Anna will be very 
glad to see you. 



To James Edward Calhoun. 

Fort Hill 19 th Sep r . 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just returned from a laborious ex- 
amination of the countrv between this and the mouth of 
Tuskyseege in company with Col Gadsden. We were nine 
days incessantly engaged. The result is eminently favourable ; 
far more than I anticipated. I cannot state particulars now. 
You must come up immediately to concert measures to give 
the route the proper impulse to carry it through. I will 
come out with a statement of facts in the Messenger on Friday 
next. We will have a meeting the week after; and meetings 
must be had in Abbeville, Edgefield and Orangeburgh. It 
has a decided preference over all other routes and nothing 
but suitable efforts are required to ensure its success. 

While up, we must come to a settlement in reference to 
3 our mother's estate. 
All send their love.

To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Fort Hill 11 th Nov r 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, I was detained much longer at the mines than 
I anticipated, owing to the absence of Cap* Clay, which, how- 
ever, gave me some leisure that was not lost. There are about 
Dahlonega many, who are familiar with the portion of our route 
beyond the mouth of the Tuskaseege, where my examination 
ended. They all concur in giving the most favourable account 
of the route beyond, even to exceed my anticipations, and, in 
particular, of the Crab Orchard gap. Among others, I met 
with Maj r . Haynes, an intelligent gentleman who resides a few 
miles below Kingston, and who had come on to take a con- 
tract on the Georgia rail road, and has of course turned his 
attention some what to the subject of rail roads. He (and 
others concur with him) says that our road ought to Cross at 
Casey's ferry, about six miles below Kingston, where the 
bluffs on both sides are high, so that a bridge of 50, or 60 feet 
elevation may be thrown over the Tenessee, and ought to run 
up White Creek, instead of the Emory river. He also states 
that the gap is not more than 16 miles from the Crossing 
place, and the elevation not more than 200 feet above the 
river and would not be more than 150 above the Bridge. On 
the West side, there is scarcely any decent. The Seguachee 
bends in a large spring just at the Gap, and affords along its 
valley every facility for a rail road to the Tenessee below the 
Suck. 

1 obtained some other information, which I consider highly 
interesting. I met with D r . Thomas, a very intelligent man, 
from Witempka, at the head of Steam navigation on the 
Coosa, about IT miles above Montgomery. He says (and 
others agree with him), that there is a beautiful land route 
from Witempka, which would intercept ours about Russels 
ferry, and that a rail road is already in contemplation in that 
direction. On calculation it is found, that the distance from 
Charleston to Witempka, would be about 500 miles by the 
route. He and others agree, that, if the road was completed, 
all midle and eastern Alabama would draw their supplies 
from Charleston. 1 also learn, that the Engineers who had 
been ordered to survey the route down the Tennessee and 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 365 

thence across to Athens and Macon from the Suck, had found 
the rout between the Lookout and Allegany mountains 
impracticable, which must tend to throw the Athens and 
Augusta interest with us. 

My information from Charleston is in the main favourable 
for our route, but a great effort will be required to succeed. 
I will leave here for Columbia about this day 2 weeks, and 
would be glad you would go with us. Your presence there 
would be very useful. 

Did you send my letter to brother James ? It is important 
I should hear from him before I leave home. 

All desire their love to you. 



To James Edward Calhaun. 

Columbia 9 th Dec r 1836 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been here more than a week, and will 
take my departure tomorrow for Washington. 

M r Burt will give you most of the news of this place, which 
will dispense with my detailing it. 

I have had a pretty full conversation with him on the rail 
road, and have got him to assent to go to Knoxville, on the 
condition you will go, as one of the proxies. It is desirable 
that you both should be there, to see what is going on. I fear 
the game is in the hand of Blanding, 1 and that the enterprise 
will be so managed as to sink millions without any substantial 
advantage to the State. The push at this moment is to get 
banking privileges, and a subscription on the part of the state, 
without waiting the Surveys. The object is to commit the 
State, so that she cannot recede, let the selection be ever so 
objectionable. I fear both objects will succeed; and if they 
should, that the whole concern will terminate in little better 
than a Stock Jobbing affair. 

Williams is here; and I hear, that the survey has been recom- 
menced since I left home. I have no confidence in his impar- 
tiality and but little in his judgement. The route he has

ordered to be surveyed on the east side of the Gap is calcu- 
lated to deceive, unless one should fully understand the 
topography of the country. He proposes to terminate the 
line at Burche's ford on the Keowee, instead of terminating 
on little River, which is many hundred feet higher, or which 
would be still fairer, on the ridge at the foot of the mountain 
between Westbro's fork and Little River. The effect is to give 
a very high appearant elevation to the gap, as the Keowee 
lies very deep. The elevation of the gap is probably greater 
than I estimated it, but unless it should exceed 1500 feet above 
the mouth of 12 miles, after taking off the crest by a tunnel, 
which is not likely, the whole may be run down at an angle 
not exceeding 30 feet to the mile, by keeping along the side 
of the Chatugee Mountain, round the North fork of the 
Cheochee, passing down near to Tomassee and on the ridge 
between Cane Creek and little River, and crossing the 
Keowee on a high bridge below the mouth of 12 miles. 
Much the greater part of the route would be on one of the 
best ridges in the state. If a line still more developed should 
be required, it would be easy to give it a still farther develope- 
ment to the West, so as to make the decent still more gentle. 
All I ask is an impartial survey when I am at home and can 
attend to it. I do not fear, but that the route will not only 
prove practicable, but the most so of any other. 

As to the Presidency, I see so much that 1 do not approve, 
that I have concluded that I had better have nothing to do 
with it. The only terms on which I could accept would be 
that it should be tendered to me without solicitation by the 
company from a confidence in my capacity and integrity, and 
then only on condition that the best route should be selected, 
and I should not be brought into conflict with any of my 
friends. In a word, if I take it, it must be solely from a sense 
of duty. I cannot think there is the slightest prospect that it 
will be tendered on such conditions, and my friends had bet- 
ter not bring my name forward. I read my letter to Hayne 
on this subject to Burt. He will tell }^ou its contents. 

The more I reflect, the more I am convinced, that the Success 
of the road will depend on the direction, and that on striking 
Steam navigation on the intermediate streams between the 
Blue ridge and the Ohio at the nearest and most favorable 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 367 

parts. Steam navigation on the Western Waters is many 
times cheaper than on rail roads; and of course, the Tennessee, 
the Cumberland and Green Rivers, if struck where navigable 
for Steam would be the best and cheapest extension of the 
rail road. Any route that overlooks this important advantage 
must fail. 

If you go to Knoxville do not fail to write me from there.

Washington 18 th Feb 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, I avail myself of the favourable opportunity 
by Col White to acknowledge your letter of August last, 
which I read with much pleasure, and I may add with infor- 
mation. Many of the facts you state are new to me. I had 
no conception that the lower class had made such great 
progress to equality and independence. Such change of con- 
dition and mode of thinking on their part indicates great 
approaching change in the political and social condition of 
the country, the termination of which is difficult to be seen. 
Modern society seems to me to be rushing to some new and 
untried condition. 

With us great changes have occurred, as short as has been 
the period of your absence. You have of course read the 
papers and have kept up with the general march of events in 
this quarter. The Presidential election terminated, as was 
anticipated, when you left us; but far less decisively, than 
was anticipated by friend, or foe. It is quite certain, that 
the President elect did not receive a majority of votes, and 
that, if the opposition had known their strength, he could 
have been defeated easily. The general impression is, that 
he cannot maintain himself. The opposition show no indica- 
tion of yielding, while his own party is agitated by conflicts 
within. The more decent portion under Rives, Buchanan and 
others are making war against their more filthy associates 
under Benton, Kendal, Blair and Johnson. Thus far victory 
leans in favor of the latter. In the meantime, the outrage[ou]s 
acts of the party, forced on them by Jackson and Benton with

his associates are shocking the feelings of the country corrupt 
and debased as it is. No act within my recollection has 
excited such disgust and loathing as the expunging resolu- 
tions. The party Senators, in voting it, looked more like 
culprits, than victorious leaders. That has been followed by 
repeated breaches of privileges of the members of the two 
Houses by the President. The last and most violent was in 
my own case. You will of course have seen his letter to me, 
and the manner in which I met it. 1 My triumph was complete. 
His friends in the Senate hung their heads in dum[b] silence. 
This is a sad picture of the state of things on this side of 
the water; and yet with my non despairing disposition, I am 
disposed to regard it as the precursor of a general and thor- 
ough reform. The principle of stability and regeneration is 
wonderfully strong in our country and under our political 
system. We have for the last 12 years been going through 
a great and dangerous juncture. The passage is almost made, 
and, if no new cause of difficulty should intervene, it will be 
successfully made. I, at present see none, but the abolition 
question, which, however, I fear is destined to shake the coun- 
try to its centre. It has made great progress since you left 
us. Its advocates are more numerous and audacious than ever, 
and have taken higher ground, at this, than the last session. 
For the first time the bold ground has been taken, that slaves 
have a right to petition Congress; and what is wonderful, a 
vote of the House of Representatives, has by strong implica- 
tion, sustained the ground, which has neither been recinded, 
nor superceded, and we are about to adjourn leaving this ques- 
tion, which involves directly the right to emancipate, in this 
uncertain condition; or rather to express my self rnorestrongty, 
and at the same time more truly, the act of emancipation; for 
the right to petition Congress is itself emancipation. It would 
make the masters but overseers, against whom the slave would 
have a right to appeal to Congress, as the absolute master of 



1 Under date of February 7, 1837, Jackson wrote a violent letter to Calhoun, protesting 
against remarks of the latter in the Senate. Calhoun had declared that many in high 
places, even persons connected with the President, had been, according to statements 
never contradicted, engaged in speculations in public lands; he had been reported to 
Jackson as accusing him of such conduct. See Niles's Register, LI, 390, 391; Calhoun's

all. Such is the present posture of this, to us, all important 
question. How it is to end time can alone disclose. I have 
ever had but one opinion on the subject. Our fate, as a peo- 
ple, is bound up in the question. If we yield we will be exter- 
pated; but, if we successfully resist, we will be the greatest 
and most flourishing people of modern time. It is the best 
substratum of population in the world; and one on which great 
and flourishing Commonwealths may be most easily and safely 
reared. 

I trust yours and M rs Hammonds health is greatly improved, 
and that you have both enjoyed yourselves in your long absence 
from your country. Your numerous friends will heartily 
welcome your return. 

Anna is with me and joins her best respects to you both, 
and requests me to say that she almost envies you the pleasure 
you must have experienced i n passing over the old and renowned 
regions of the old world.

Washington, 9 th Mar. 1837. 

MY DEAR SIR, Our delegates placed the name of my son 
Patrick on the list of applicants for West Point. He is six- 
teen years of age, of good constitution and well advanced in 
his education. He is very desirous of receiving his education 
at West Point, and as this is the first favour I have ever asked 
in relation to an institution I cherished not a little, I would 
be pleased if his wishes could be gratified. 

We start in the course of an hour and my daughter and 
myself regret that our incessant engagement has deprived us 
of the pleasure of calling 041 yourself and Mrs. P. 

This will be handed by Capt. Bell of the Ordnance, an 
excellent officer with whom I take pleasure in making you 
acquainted.

Abbeville 22 d March 1837 

MY DEAR JAMES, . . . On the whole, I think the last session 
went oft' well. The administration lost every measure they 
had at heart, and were for the last 8 or 10 days of the session 
in a minority in the House of Representatives. Van Buren 
goes in very weak and may be easily crushed with anything 
like a vigorous effort. There is a great and growing change 
in our favour. 



To James Edward Calhoun. 

Fort Hill 12 th May 1837 

MY DEAR JAMES, ... I enclose the Messenger, containing 
an article signed Americus, recommending the Southern 
Review * to the patronage of the slave holding states. Such a 
work is indispensible to our character and safety; and I hope 
you will take charge of Abbeville. I know no one so well 
calculated to give an impulse to the work in the District as 
yourself. See Maj r . Burt, Co 1 Noble, M r Wardlaw, M r 
M c Duffie and others and on some sale day, or other publick 
occasion have a meeting and give the impulse to the subscrip- 
tion. It is all important. No man, who can spare $5, ought 
to withold his name. We ought to get in the South at least 
6000 subscribers. 

The difficulties of the times increase. I see not the end. 
Unless the British Government should interfere and arrest the 
progress of the Disorder, I would not be surprised, that it 
should end in the overthrow of the banking system. Our 
government by its folly and vice has lost all control for good 
over the banks and the currency. 

We are all well and all join in their love to you.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 371 

To Robert M. T. Hunter. 1 

Fort Hill June 1837 

MY DEAK SIR, I write to say to you how much I am grati- 
fied with the success of your election. The struggle in Vir- 
ginia seemed to be to destroy all who would not range them- 
selves under the flag of the Administration or opposition, as 
mere partisans; and that you should have sufficient strength 
of yourself .to maintain your position between the contending 
parties is a source of joy to your friends in this State, and to 
none more than myself. 

What is the true result of your election and what is the 
future prospect of Virginia? Is she destined to be bound by 
the mere trammels of party, or is there a prospect that she 
will ever assume independent ground on her former princi- 
ples? What course did the two parties take in reference to 
yourself? Who brought out your opponent, and on what 
ground did he place his election ? Our State is profoundly 
quiet. Publick sentiment approaches to something like una- 
nimity on all the great questions of the day, and our people 
seemed determined to hold the presidential election strictly 
subordinate to their principles. We begin to turn our atten- 
tion to the readjustment of the Tariff under the compromise 
act. My mind is made up; that it ought not to be delayed 
beyond the next session, and that we ought to go for a uniform 
ad val: duty on all articles, without any discrimination; and 
such, I think, will be the unanimous voice of the State. It is 
our only safe position; and if we can get the South to unite on 
it, its success is certain. It would give us a security, that we 
have never heretofore had under the government. I intend 
to direct a good deal of my attention to the subject before the 
meeting of Congress, and will probably make an early move 
on it. This, however, I write to you as a friend, and for your 
private ear, as it perhaps would not be advisable that what I 

i The text of this letter, the original of which 1 have not seen, is derived from a copy 
kindly furnished by Miss M. T. Hunter, of Lloyds, Va., its present possessor. Robert 
M. T. Hunter (1809-1887), one of the most prominent of Virginia politicians, had lately 
been elected to Congress. See the letter of December 18, 1839. He served in the House 
from 1837 to 1843 (being Speaker from 1839 to 1841) , and from 1845 to 1847. He was a Sena- 
tor from that year until the secession of Virginia in 1861, after which he served as a Con- 
federate senator and secretary of state. During the years from 1837 to 1850 he was one 
of the warmest and most influential of Calhoun's supporters in Virginia.

contemplate should be known; but I hope, if you concur with 
me, that you will take such steps by correspondence and other- 
wise, as may prepare our friends for the movement in your 
State. Do let me hear from you at your early convenience, 
and favour me fully with your views on that and all other 
points, that you may deem worthy of attention. What would 
be the effect in Virginia, if Clay should not be nominated by 
the whig convention ? 

With my kind regards to M rs . H. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 26 th June 1837 

DEAR SIR, It will be impossible to form a definitive opinion, 
as to the proposed convention, to which you refer, till we see 
the objects distinctly stated, and the motives, which actuate 
those who propose it fully developed. If it is intended under 
the general name of Whigs to call all the opposition together 
in order to ascertain, which section is the strongest, with an 
understanding, that all shall rally under him, who may be the 
choice of the strongest, without regard to his political princi- 
ples, or views of policy, I do not see, how we could go into 
such a meeting without an unqualified surrender of our prin- 
ciples and the policy we deem the best for the country. We 
are in a minority of the opposition, and would be sure to be 
voted down and be compelled to vote for Clay or Webster, or 
to violate the pledge implied in going into the convention. If 
we do the former, would be merged in the national Republi- 
can party, and leave the whole states rights ground open to 
be seized on by those in power; if the latter, we would be 
weakened, and disgraced in the eyes of the community. 

But, if the object be to harmonize the two sections of the 
opposition, the states rights, and the national, it seems to me, 
it would fail and leave us in a worse condition than ever. On 
what grounds can we compromise? How can the consolida- 
tion party and the anti consolidation; the abolition and anti 
abolition, the retrenchment, and the expenditure parties com- 
promise? Where is the midle ground? I must say I can see

LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 3? 3 

none. If they should come together, it must be by conces- 
sion, or surrender. One or the other must yield. At all 
events, if compromise be the object, it is clear, that there 
should be a previous understanding among the leaders, before 
the convention meets; and that can only be, done after the 
meeting of Congress; or all will be in confusion. And hence 
I am clearly of the opinion, no countenance should be given 
to the move at the present time. If the object be to select a 
candidate, it is too soon; and if to harmonize, I would say, 
that all attempts at harmonizing faster, than experience and 
reflection may bring the heterogeneous mass together, will 
prove worse than useless, and will certainly defeat the object 
in view. 

My impression has been and is, that we occupy the strong 
ground of truth and principle, and ought not to surrender it 
on any account; that it is the only ground on which the admin- 
istration can be defeated, and on which defeat would be of 
any value to the community. On none other can the country 
and its institutions be saved, and there is no hope of its being 
made available, but by our adhering to it with inflexible 
tenacity. The wors[t] thing that could befal us and the 
country would be for us to bring in a party hostile to our 
doctrines and principles. The present state of things is 
greatly to be preferred to that. There is some hope in the 
present, there would be none in the other. 

Let us then stand fast, do our duty firmly, and maintain 
kind relations with all, except the rogues, who have got hold 
of power; and show much more solicitude to redeem the 
country, than to advance ourselves. The crisis is too great 
and dangerous for a displa}^ of ambitious feelings. It is the 
time for the patriot; one who cares more for the publick, than 
himself; and, if I mistake not, all, who push forward to get 
an advantage in the hope of getting the start will be defeated. 
They at least ought to be. The difficulties and dangers are 
destined to increase, and the people to be saved must look to the 
wise, the resolute and patriotick. Be kind to all, but commit 
to none; and distrust any opining, that does not lead in the 
direction of a rigid adherence to our principles and doctrines, 
If we stand firm, the national party must become extinct; and 
till it becomes so the country cannot be saved. Time and 



374 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

experience have decided against them. We cannot save them 
by uniting with them; but would only identify our fate with 
theirs. I see my way clearly. The past is in our favour. 
We have nothing to correct or repent of. 

Let me hear from you often. I greatly rejoice, that the 
prospect of your paper is so good. It is of vast importance 
that it should hold its ground. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill July 27 th 1837 

DEAR SIR, Absence from home has prevented me from 
acknowledging your several letters from the 12 th to the 15 th 
Inst. both inclusive till now. 

I am distressed to hear of your difficulties with the paper 
and would do anything in my power, to which I could by any 
possibility bring my feelings, that would afford relief; but I 
must say, after full reflection, that I cannot think the accept- 
ance of the place you propose would have the effect, that }^ou 
suppose, and that it would be difficult for me to get my con- 
sent to undertake it. 

So far from aiding, its effects as it appears to me, would be 
to bring a weight of opposition, originating in political con- 
siderations, against you. It would be viewed and regarded 
as a political movement, and would rouse both national and 
administrative forces to thwart it. But placing this consider- 
ation -out of sight, and regarding it personally, as it relates to 
myself , I see great difficulties. The business would be entirely 
new to me, and to one at my time of life, few things are more 
formidable. Rare are the instances of the success of one in a 
new undertaking so late in life. It is difficult to acquire a 
taste for a new pursuit, when our habits are all fixed. This 
in my case would especially apply to the duties attached to 
the place in question. Of all things in the world, I have the 
least taste for money making, and the poorest capacity for 
success in it, and in particular the branch connected with 
stock, exchange, or banking, to which I have a peculiar aver- 
sion. My highest ambition as to money is to be independent,

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 375 

in a moderate and plain mode of living. I have just about 
sufficient for that purpose and it is all I want. I know, that 
Mammon is the idol of the times, but, I cannot get my consent 
to worship at his Shrine. Thus feeling and thinking, you 
must see how illy qualified I am for the task you propose, and 
how exceedingly irksome its duties would be me to me: I 
would infinitely prefer, if I was compelled to choose to take 
the place of chief Engineer, at the head of the mining Depart- 
ment of }^our concern, for which I would have much more 
capacity and inclination. To develope the resources of so fine 
a deposite would at least require so much reflection and energy 
as to absorb the attention. 

As to the other topicks you touched of a political character, 
and which you seemed to think might be offensive to me, it 
would be difficult for any one, whose friendship to me has 
been so severely tested as yours has been, to say anything, 
which I would regard in that light; but I must say, that tho' 
your remarks gave no offense, they deeply mortified my feel- 
ings. I am sure, that if your letters would fall into the hands 
of those who are to come after us, they would infer from the 
topicks you urge on me to adopt the course you recommend, 
and the remarks with which you accompany them, that I was 
a vain, light headed, ill judging and ambitious man, ignorant 
alike of the nature of the times, and my own strength, and 
constantly leading nryself and those who follow me, into false 
positions, and aiming constantly at the Presidency and des- 
tined constantly to be defeated. I know you do not and can- 
not so think of me. No one knows better than yourself, that 
in the heat of youthful years, I never sought, or desired the 
Presidency, but through a faithful discharge of my duty, and 
as an instrument of high usefulness and distinguished service; 
and that when the alternative was presented between truth 
and duty on one side, and personal agrandizement on the other, 
I never hesitated for a moment. You also well know, I never 
held out office, or emoluments to those who followed me; nor 
have ever asked or sought the support of any; and that for 
years I have, in obedience to what I believed to be my duty, 
knowingly pursued a course, that would sacrifice my popu- 
larity. How then can you say, that I more over rate my 
strength than any other publick man? I who have resisted 



376 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

every attempt of my friends to bring forward my name, on 
the express ground that I did not suit the times, nor the times 
me, and that I would not accept the Presidency, unless my 
services were demanded by the country to reform the govern- 
ment from top to bottom. So far from overestimating, I 
have no doubt, that the very services, which ought to recom- 
mend me to the country, and the qualities, which ought to give 
confidence, constitute insuperable objections to my election. 
Nothing can raise me short of saving the country from con- 
vulsions; which gives me not a moment of grief. I would 
rather, to use your own expression, stand alone in my glory, 
seeing what is coming, raising an honest and fearless voice of 
forewarning, untainted and untouched by the times, than to 
be President of these States, on any other condition, than 
through a discharge of my duty, which I know is your own 
opinion of me. This I wish my friend[s] to know; and that 
there is very little prospect of honor, or emoluments in follow- 
ing me. But enough of this. 

As to my taking place on the Harrison ticket, I am sure 
it could be no more than a momentary impulse with you. 
How could I who am anti national, take a place under a promi- 
nent national Republican? How can I, who am anti abolition, 
go on a ticket, headed by one, who has expressed an opinion 
in favour of appropriating money to emancipate our slaves by 
purchase; and whose main support is in a state chiefly tainted 
by abolitionism, and by the Gov r . of that state who has come 
out an open abolitionist? I touch not other topicks, the dan- 
ger of elevating a weak, vain man with no fixed principles, 
and having such men as Granger, and others of like discrip- 
tion as my competitors, and being defeated by them. 

As to the convention of the Whigs, I intend for one to have 
nothing to do with it. I am not of the same party with Web- 
ster and others, and do not intend to go into any move, that 
may be controlled by abolitionists, consolidationists, coloniza- 
tionists. I speak as an individual. If my friends think dif- 
ferently, I shall not complain: but shall regard it as a signal, 
that they are tired of being in a hopeless minority, and that it 
is time for me to step of [f] the stage. I believe the sound 
portion of the country, if there be one, that is left, is to be 
found in the original Jackson party; I mean those who rallied 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 377 

under him to put down M r Adams, and his administration, and 
that the true policy is to reorganize the old party. Such of 
our friends, who take a different view will be woefully dis- 
appointed in the end. They may sacrifice their principles in 
going with others, but their reward will be scorn and con- 
tempt. M r L. has taken the true view, and no one can do 
more to effect it both in and out of the administration party, 
than himself, and if he succeeds, he will deserve and receive 
the lasting praise of the country. He also selects the proper 
state in which to commence action, and can do more there, 
than any other man. He has taken, the common sense and 
patriotick view, which opens a glim[p]se of light, coming from 
that quarter, in the midst of darkness that surrounds us. 



To James Edward CalJwun. c. c. 

Washington 7 th Sept r 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, Things are doing well here. Van Buren 
has been forced by his situation and the terror of Jackson to 
play directly into our hands and I am determined, that he 
shall not escape from us. We have now a fair opportunity 
to break the last of our commercial Shackles. I mean the 
control which the North through the use of Government credit 
acting through the banks, have exercised over our industry 
and commerce. How wonderful, that the author of the Safety 
fund system and the favourite of New York (the State above 
all others the most benefitted by the Union of bank and state) 
should be forced by circumstances, which he could not con- 
trol, to give the fatal blow to his own offspring and support- 
ers ! Into what situation may not an artful but shortsighted 
politician be forced? 

I have taken my stand. I go against the chartering of a 
United States bank, or any connection with Biddies, or any 
other bank. I go in a word for a complete seperation from 
the whole concern. So far I have come to a fixfed] determina- 
tion. Beyond that I wait for developement; and shall come 
to no conclusion, till I see the whole ground. We will divide. 
My colleague, as I understand him, goes for Biddle's bank and 
will probably take a portion of the Representatives with him. 



378 AMEEICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Like divisions will probably run throughout all the States, 
and I would not be surprised, if an entirely new organization 
of parties should rise out of the present state of things. 

In the mean time, it is of vast importance, that the meeting in 
Augusta should be fully attended. Now is the time. Abbe- 
ville must send her delegates. You and M c Duffie ought to be 
two of them. Let a meeting be called at the Court House and 
the nomination be made. It is of little importance whether it 
be fully attended or not. Some body must move in the affair; 
and I know of no one better calculated to give the impulse 
than yourself. 

I had a long letter yesterday from M c Neil, on his western tour 
of exploration. He writes me that he is determined not to 
hasten a final decision on the route; and I have no doubt from 
the tone of his letter he will do his duty. I trust I may get off 
in time to attend the meeting of directors. There is, I think, a 
fair prospect that the work may yet take the proper direction. 
If you can, you ought to attend. 

Let me hear from you. 



To Miss Anna Maria Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 8 th Sep r . 1837 

MY DEAR ANNA, On the day of my arrival here, I wrote 
to your mother, and since then to Andrew. I hope both 
letters have been received. 

We expected, when I first wrote, to change our lodgings, 
but Co 1 Pickens, and myself both concluded, after looking 
about, that we could not better ourselves, and have determined 
to remain with Miss Cocran for the Session. Our Mess is 
a mixed concern. It consists of Co 1 Pickens, myself, M r 
Rencher of N. Carolina, the Philadelphia and the Rhode Island 
Representatives; and is of course too discordant to be very 
social on political subjects. In other respects it is agreeable 
enough; but contrasted with the mess of last winter, which 
was like a family party, it is solitude compared to a social 
circle of friends. The consolation is, that we have the pros- 
pect of a short session. Every one seems to think that it will 
adjourn by the midle of next month; and some suppose earlier. 
It cannot be too short for me. There is no prospect of doing 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 379 

much. There are now four parties; the two great divisions 
of administration and opposition, each divided in itself; the 
former into administration proper and the conservatives, and 
the latter into the States rights and Nationals. The division 
is such that neither of these subdivisions can move without 
the other. What is to grow out of all this time alone can 
disclose; but I see clearly it must end in a complete reorgani- 
zation of the political elements of the country. 

I stand on my old position and have avowed my determina- 
tion, not to go for the chartering of a United States bank, 
nor for Biddies, or any other State bank, or combination of 
banks, reserving to myself the right to determine on other 
propositions, as they may be presented. I see clearly that 
Van Buren has been compelled to play into our hands (no 
thanks to him, he had no choice) and I am resolved to use my 
position, to reform the Government, and to throw off the last 
of our commercial Shackles. In the mean time my position 
is one of great delicacy, and will require consummate pru- 
dence with decision and boldness. It causes much specula- 
tion; but I think I see my way clearly. It puts me in a 
position much more congenial to my feelings, than that which 
I have occupied for the last few years. It was impossible for 
me to go with the leaders of the nationals. We disagreed on 
almost all points except resistance to Executive usurpation. 
We could not part on a point better for me, than the one on 
which we now seperate. I stand now on my own bottom, 
with no influence acting on me but a rigid adherence to those 
great principles, for which I have made so many sacrifices. 

I have not had a letter from home since I left, tho it has 
been a week since my arrival here. I hope to hear soon. 
My love to all and tell the children they must write to me. I 
shall be very impatient to get home. 

[P. S] As usual I have had a bad cold since my arrival, but 
am better. 



To Miss Anna Maria Calhoun. c. c.

gave me of the Wedding and wedding parties and the gay

hours, which you and Maria have spent. It was quite a con- 
trast of my life for the last month, which has been one of 
incessant toil and labour, without relaxation, or amusement of 
any discription whatever. I have to stand in the breach in 
this great conflict, and bear the brunt of the action. My 
situation was extraordinary. I held the fate of the country, 
by the confession of all, in my hand, and had to determine in 
what direction I should turn events hereafter. I did not 
hesitate. Acting on long established conceptions, 1 could not 
array myself under the flag of the banks and by so doing lay 
the foundation for restoring the very system of plunder, which 
has cost me so much labour to pull down. The decision has 
embittered the national Republican party against' me, but for 
that I care little. We hold no principle scarcely in common, 
and neither I, nor my section had anything to expect from 
them. As I acted with them to put down executive usurpa- 
tion on Congress, I now act with the opposite side to repel 
theirs on the State, and such is the force [of] my position, that 
I hope to accomplish both. 

I regret that my colleague has not thought fit to go with 
me. I think both he and Gn 1 Thompson 1 have acted badly, 
but I leave it to them and their constituents. 

I can say nothing about the gayety of Washington. I have 
not heard of a party ; tho' the city is full of strangers. Our 
gallery is daily crow[d]ed, and with a large portion of ladies. 
The debate is drawing to a close, and I expect to conclude it 
on Tuesday. The dicision is doubtful, but I think the sepera- 
tion will pass by a few votes. 

M r . Felder is here on his way to the north for his neice; 
and I am glad he brings so favourable account of the state of 
publick sentiment in his quarter of the State. Co 1 Nisbit 
called on me last evening, just from West Point, and says that 
he saw Patrick. He is well, looks well and stands well in the 
institution. He is quite pleased, the Co 1 says with the place. 
All this was highly gratifying

Fort Hill 27 th Oct r 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, I returned home on the 24 th and had the pleas- 
ure of finding the sick all on the recovery. Maria and Anna 
are free from all disease and only require the Cook and time 
to restore them to their usual health and strength. Andrew 
will set out West in a week, or ten days, and is much obliged 
to you for your information of the mill seat on the Phillibody, 
which he will certainly visit. 

I could not get off in time to be at Flat Rock, but I learn, 
that things took a proper turn. I saw Gen 1 Hamilton for a 
short time at Abbeville on his return from there and I learn 
from him, that the F. Broad route is in fact abandonned; and 
that the intention is to purchase the Hamburgh road and to 
Unite with the Augusta and Athens interest to extend their 
road to meet the Georgia main track from th,e Suck to the 
Chattahochee. This is as it should be. They now take the 
very route, which I recommended three years since, and which 
I could not get a single man in Charleston to join me. All the 
movements about the French Broad, at the late meeting, was 
but to cover a retreat. 1 A branch will probably be made to 
Columbia, to gratify the interest in that quarter, to which 
there can be no great objection. Thus far, Charleston has a 
fair prospect, to consumate it only requires, that the Com- 
promise act shall be rigidly adhered to and that the monied 
and commercial power shall not be concentrated by an act of 
Congress in the North. 

On this point I did not find the General so sound. He 
expressed himself decidedly opposed to a national bank but 
equally as much so to the divorce. His plan is a Union of ten 

1 A letter to Hon. David Hubbard, kindly sent by Professor F. W. Moore, of Vanderbilt 
University, but received too late for insertion, shows that as late as June 15, 1838, Calhoun 
still hoped for a combination with Georgia and a route to the Tennessee River; but see 
the letters of October 28 and November 17, 1838, post.

of the strongest of the state banks to be selected by the Gen- 
eral Government and to be maid [made] their fiscal agent and 
the instrument of restoring specie payment; Biddies bank of 
course to be one a plan in my opinion still more objection- 
able, than a national bank. He professed great personal 
regard, but, I infer from his conversation that there will be 
a vigorous effort made in this state in favour of his views, and 
against the divorce, which must be counteracted, and in which 
you must take an active part. The first point will be to secure 
the members of the legislature. Every one of your members 
ought to be seen and secured on the opposite side. You must 
be at Abbeville on sale day next and see and converse with all 
of them, who may be out and the rest ought to be written to. 

The next will be* to secure prominent and influential indi- 
viduals, and M c Duffie in particular. They are making great 
efforts to secure him. He was perfectly sound when I saw 
him at my house, a short time be*fore 1 sat out for Washing- 
ton, and I hope is still so; but he is liable to be acted on by 
men inferior to himself; and I must request you to see him as 
early as convenient to confirm him in the faith, if sound, and 
if not to bring him right. 

I am gratified to learn that all in this neighbourhood are 
right as far as my information extends; and that such is also 
the case as far as I could learn through the entire line of my 
route home with the states rights party. There never was so 
favourable an opportunity to break the last shackles on our 
industry and to Unite the entire South. It must not be lost. 

I sent you a copy of each of my speeches, which I hope you 
got. 1 I also sent a copy to each member of the Legislature. 

If I can possibly leave home, I intend to be at Anderson on 
sale day and the day after at Abbeville. I wish to make a visit 
to my brothers Patrick and William and will return by your 
residence. 1 would be glad to meet you at Abbeville. 

All join their love to you.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 383 

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 27 th Oct r 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, I arrived here day before yesterday after a 
safe and pleasant journey with the exception of the Dust, 
which was very troublesome throughout the whole way. 

The little opportunity I had of ascertaining publick senti- 
ment has brought me to the conclusion, that the indications 
are not unfavorable, but that the publick sentiment is still in 
a course of formation. I am of the impression, that the party 
opposed to seperation in this State intend a rally. Columbia 
will be the centre of their hostility. The attack will be made 
on the Reformer, under the pretexft] of repelling its alledged 
attacks on Co 1 Preston, but with the real design of attacking 
me through its sides. You will see the line of operation in 
the Telescope, and the use they intend to make of your sup- 
posed enmity to Co 1 Preston and relation to me. It appears 
to me, that the most effectual mode of cutting this line of 
hostile operation is, in the first place for M r Cralle to come 
out in a temperate article denying that the Reformer has gone 
one inch beyond the defensive, and stating at the same time 
thai he fully understands the real object of the Telescope, and 
his determination not to afford it the pretex[t] for its insidios 
and indirect attack on me through the Reformer. I have 
written him to this effect. In the next place, it does seem to 
me, that you ought at an early day to announce your with- 
drawal from the editorial department entirely, and that the 
establishment has been transfered to trustees. I think it 
due to yourself and M r Cralle both, that the responsibility of 
the editorial department should be clearly understood. Any 
confusion on that point, must be unpleasant to you both and 
injurious to the establishment, by giving an unfair advantage 
to its enemies, as in the case of the Telescope; and I feel 
convinced, that both you and M r Cralle must desire, that what- 
ever may be the merit, or demerit of any article, which may 
appear in the paper, should be attributed to the proper source. 
I do hope that you have been able to make some arrangement 
that will free you from all future charges on account of the 
paper, and leave you to attend exclusively to your domestick

concerns. The times, I think, must improve, and the com- 
pletion of the canal to Cumberland will give you a fair pros- 
pect, if you should succeed in making the arrangement you 
contemplated, when I left Washington. Your property must 
be invaluable, if you can only hold out; and your activity and 
experience, if directed exclusively to your private interest, 
ought soon to put you at your ease. 

We have had more sickness than ever has been known on 
the place; but all are well, or on the recovery now. Andrew, 
Margret and the child have had uninterrupted health through- 
out. The child has grown much in my absence and is really 
a fine boy. 

All join their love to you, M rs Green, M rs Reed and the 
family. 



To Henry Baldwin. 1 

Fort Hill 2 nd Dec. 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, I am under great obligation to you for the 
volume on constitutional Views etc. which you were so kind 
as to transmit to me. 

I have read it with very great satisfaction. Your exposi- 
tion of the origin, the nature and character of our system is 
demonstrated very clear; so much so as to place them beyond 
the sphere of controversy. 

Fortunate would it have been for our country, if they had 
always prevailed. Under no other view, can the system be 
preserved. As explained by you, it is one of great beauty 
and harmony. 

Regarded in any other light it becomes the mere outgrown 
system of the numerical majority, which has been so often 
tried and condemned. It is in fact but one of the forms of 
despotism. 

As far as you have carried your conclusions there are but 
very few points, in which I do not fully concur". 

There are important questions lying beyond, which I could 
wish you had discussed in the same masterly manner. Having

clearly shown what the system is, that its component parts 
are states, that the two the General and state Governments 
were created and adopted by the same authority, the one by 
each state seperately for itself, and the other conjointly with 
its confederates for federal purposes, the two in fact making 
but one government, it appears to me, the right of state inter- 
position follows as a necessary consequence and is indispensi- 
ble to make the action and the theory of (ho system conform. 
Without it, be the theory what it may, practically it must be 
a consolidated government and work precisely as if it was 
made by the people of the United States in the aggregate, 
which you have so clearly shown not to be a fact. It seems 
to me that this is the great question, on which the true char- 
acter of the system must practically depend, and on which I 
would be happy to exchange ideas when we meet. 

For what you have done you will please accept my thanks, 
the thanks of one who has the profoundest attachment to our 
admirable system, and whose first and highest desire is, to aid 
to contribute in transmitting our free institutions to the latest 
generations.

MY DEAR SIR, I find the resolution of the company is 'to 
purchase and complete the Hamburgh road, to unite with the 
Athens and to unite finally with the Georgia state road to the 
Suck. They will extend the road this way to this place, and 
whether it shall go farther is to depend on circumstances. No 
instalment will be immediately called for. I speak on the 
authority of Gen 1 Hamilton. Publick sentiment is very sound 
here. My course will be sustained by a triumphant majority 
say 3 or 4 to 1. This speaks well for the intelligence and 
patriotism of the state. 

I hope you will be able to let me have the salt I wrote 
about when my negroes are down at Christmas.

To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 20 th Dec r 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, I arrived here on Saturday night after a 
safe, but rather cold and uncomfortable journey. We had a 
heavy fall of snow between Raleigh and the Roanoke, which 
retained us one day on the rail road. 

I took my seat on Monday, and the time of the Senate has 
ever since been mainly occupied with abolitionism. Yester- 
day we had a string of resolutions from the Vermont Legis- 
lature, to abolish Slavery in the District, to prevent the 
Slave trade between the States and against the anexation of 
Texas on the ground of Slavery. 1 This is a new and bold step, 
and from a higher quarter. Believing that the subject has 
now assumed an aspect, in which it must be met by the South, 
I moved to lay the question of receiving the resolutions on 
the table, with the express view to afford time on our part 
for reflection and consultation, what to do. It ended in the 
withdrawal of the resolutions by the Vermont Senator with 
notice, that they would again be presented on the 26 th Ins*, 
when, no doubt, the whole question must assume to us a new 
and momentous form. I think the sooner the issue is made 
the better for us and the country ; but how it is to be brought 
on, I am not prepared to say. I think a Southern Conven- 
tion at the earliest period that the South can be brought act 
indespensible. 

Knowing the interest you take in whatever relates to the 
history of this continent, I enclose some papers in reference 
to its early discovery which I find in the Post office here on 
my arrival.

Washington 24 th Dec r 1837 

MY DEAR SIR, ... We are here on our oars and shall 
do nothing till after the first of Jan y . In the mean time 
the abolitionists are active. The Vermont resolutions to 
abolish Slavery in this District and the Territories, to pre- 
vent the Sales and transfer of slaves from State to State and

against the annexation of Texas are to be presented on the 3 d 
Jan y . It is the first move from a state, and I am now prepar- 
ing resolutions to meet it, directly and fully, to be laid on the 
table in advance. 1 It is time the issue should be made and it 
shall not be my fault, if it is not. 

The action of our Legislature on the divorce 2 has made a 
deep impression, and added much to my strength here. The 
whole South I doubt not will rally on our position. There is 
more union on the slave question than heretofore.

MY DEAR ANNA, . . . The action of our state on the Di- 
vorce has made a deep impression out of the state, and will 
do much to rally the South on our position. It has added 
much to my strength, and means of serving the country. 

We are on our oars here. Nothing will be acted on till 
after 1 st January. The Vermont resolutions to abolish Slavery 
in this District and the Territories; to prevent the Sales and 
removal of slaves from State to State, and against the annexa- 
tion of Texas, will be presented on the 3 d Jan y . This is the 
first move [of] the kind, and I am preparing to meet it by 
drawing up a series of resolutions to be placed before the 
Senate in advance, intended to cover the whole ground on our 
side. It is time the issue should be made, and it shall not be 
my fault, if it be not. Say to Francis, 3 if he has not left, 
that he must be here as soon as possible. His presence is 
much needed. 

I am in my quarters at M rs Pages on the avenue, nearly 
opposite to the central market. The House promises well; 
the furniture, rooms and table good, but my mess is not yet 
formed. 

I miss you and Maria much. You must both come on in the 
spring and have our old family Mess reconstituted. It was 
the most pleasant I ever had. . . .

Washington 8 th Jan y 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, I enclose you some Siberian spring wheat, 
which I received a few days since. I would advise the Sow- 
ing of it, in our climate, early in March, and would put it in, 
as well as the parcel I ordered down from Fort Hill, in the 
red land, in some good spot well prepared and carefully 
drilled, up at the Plantation, and not near your house, where, 
I think, it would be more liable to the rust. If they should 
succeed it will be a great acquisition. 

My resolutions are progressing well through the Senate. 
The three first have been passed by large majorities, and, I 
think, I shall get the three last through by strong votes. 
Every effort has been made to defeat or elude them but in 
vain. My colleague you will see has given me a very doubt- 
ful support. The great point is to carry the war into the non 
slave holding states. The disease originated there, and 
there it ought to be met. The resolutions will have a power- 
ful tendency to bring the democratick party in these states 
into conflict with the abolition and consolidation parties. 

There is great excitement on the Lake frontier, 1 but I trust 
there is no danger of our peace being disturbed. A War with 
Great Britain would indeed be a calamity, the end of which 
no one could see. 

This I think is my third letter to you since my arrival here. 
I hope you have received all.

more laborious task of correcting and writing out from the 
most infamous notes what I said, and which I have just com- 
pleted, that 1 have been compelled to .suspend almost entirely 
my private correspondence. 

The debate was close and animated throughout, with crowded 
galleries from morn to night. From the beginning, every 
effort was made to evade or defeat the resolutions, but I suc- 
ceedfed] in breaking down every combination for the purpose 
and car[ry]ing them successfully till I came to the 5 th Resolu- 
tion, when I was overpowered, by adverse feelings growing 
mainly out of the presidential controversy. The two promi- 
nent candidates M r Van Buren and M r Clay naturally come 
together on all questions on which the North and South come 
into conflict. One is a Southern man relying on the North 
for support, and the other a Northern relying on the South. 
They of course dread all conflicting questions between the 
two Sections, and do their best to prevent them from coming 
up, or when up to evade them. Their hostility prevented 
their early Union against my resolutions; but they gradually 
gravitated together in the course of the discussion, which will 
explain the fate of the 5 th and 6 th Resolutions. 

A few first gave away, from the South, which of necessity 
compelled the whole north to do so. My colleague acted with 
Clay throughout, and made a very ungenerous and unpatri- 
otick opposition, which I bore with perfect patience. No act 
of his shall force me so far to forget my own dignity, or what 
is due to the State, as to exhibit the Spectacle of her two Rep- 
resentatives in the Senate quarreling with each other. He is 
totally alienated, without any act of mine to justify it. I 
received him kindly on my arrival, and had resolved to treat 
him with the utmost courtesy. I know not how to account 
for it, unless indeed he has made up his mind to share the 
fate of Clay, and thinks that opposition to me is the most 
effectual mode to secure his favour. He (M r Clay) and the 
whole national party are as bitter as gall. Their hired scrib- 
lers and press are daily misrepresenting in the grossest man- 
ner every thing I say or do. Thompson acts quite as bad as 
his friend Preston. I am told that he is very busy in his Dis- 
trict and I dare say distorting and misrepresenting every 



390 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

thing. This, however, is inter nos; for I may possibly be 
doing him injustice. 

As to the Presidential question, 1 can say but little. I act 
as if it did not exist, moving directty forward on my objects; 
but as far as I hear there is a state of great distraction, and 
bitterness. The four candidates it is said hold on, and are all 
said to be weak. The administration is clearly at present in 
a minority, but the opposition is divided into three parts, 
which makes them very weak, and in no event can the South 
and northern divisions go together. The fate of the divorce 
question is doubtful in both houses. The question comes up 
this day week and the debate will be warm and angry. In 
the midst of this distraction and uncertainty, the times are not 
unpropitious to the principles and interest of the South. 
The very uncertainty and distraction are awaking enquiry, 
and doing much to advance our doctrines, which our Union 
at home is greatly aiding. It is in this point, that the course of 
my colleague and Representative is so much to be regretted. 
Were it not for them the State would present an undivided 
front. 

Write me fully and early, and let me in particular know how 
brother Patrick is, as well William and James. My love to 
Martha and the rest of the family and believe me to be. ... . 

[P. S.] The debate on my resolutions will be corrected and 
printed in pamphlet form. * It will do much good. Gen 1 Green 
has sold the Reformer. It will appear this week under the 
name of the Wash*. Chronicle. I hope it will be well supported 
in the South. Mr. Cralle is sole Editor. Show this letter to

spondence, some twenty or thirty letters, which I had to bring 
up in the midest of other engagements, I am sure you will 
excuse me. 

All is, and has for some days been quiet and dull in the 
Senate. Neither abolition, nor currency for a week has dis- 
turbed the repose; but next week the Subtreasury comes up 
when I anticipate, from indications in advance, we shall have 
a warm and angry debate. 

I[n] speaking of abolition, you say it is better to part peac- 
ably at once, than to live in the state of indecision we do. 
That is a natural and common conclusion, but those, who make 
it up, do not think of the difficulty involved in the word; how 
many bleeding pours must be taken up in passing the knife 
of seperation through a body politick, (in order to make two 
of one) which has been so long bound together by so many 
ties, political, social and commercial. We cannot and ought 
not to live together as we are at present, exposed to the con- 
tinual attacks and assaults of the other portion of the Union; 
but we must act throughout on the defensive, resort to every 
probable means of arresting the evil, and only act, when all 
has been done, that can be, and when we shall stand justified 
before God and man in taking the final step. Any other 
course would fail in its object, and ruin those, who may 
attempt it. We must remember, it is the most difficult proc- 
ess in the world to make two people of one; and that there 
is no example of it, if we except the Jews; I mean by inte- 
rior cause of complaint, as in our case, tho I do not doubt, if 
the evil be not arrested at the North, we shall add another 
example. 

I have given you but very little of what may be called news, 
and will to compensate make up the remaining part of this 
letter with it. 

To begin at home, I mean the mess. 

Our Mess consists of M r Campbell of our state, M r8 Camp- 
bell, her sister, and Miss Lee, of Leesburgh (you saw her last 
winter with M rs Gen 1 Campbell) who has come to spend the 
season in Washington. The Mess is rather dull, but quiet, 
which suits me. The board very good; and the landlady 
obliging. The servants excellent.

Washington 24 th Feb 1838 

Mr DEAR DAUGHTER, I received three days since yours of 
the 10 th Inst; and have taken the first leisure moment to 
reply, so you see what a punctual correspondent I am. 

You know it is much more easy to make a speech to the 
Senate, than to the country. The former may be delivered 
in two or three hours, but the latter requires several days to 
prepare it before it can reach the auditory through the chan- 
nel of the press. Between drawing off, correcting the manu- 
script, and the proof sheet, all my leisure hours have been 
completely engrossed for the last four or five days. I enclose 
you the result. I do not know how it will appear in print. 
My friends thought highly of it when delivered. It was 
condens'ed in the delivery, but is still more so in print; for 
I find, that 1 can crowd more ideas together on paper, than I 
can in debate in the same space. 

My correspondence has fallen so much in the rear in conse- 
quence of my engagements, that you must be content with a 
short letter; particularly, as I shall have to begin forthwith 
to prepare for a general reply, as I find that I am the general

object of attack from the side of those opposed to the bill.

Washington 5 th April 1838 

MY DEAR SON, I am glad to learn by yours of the 23 d April, 
that you are so deeply impressed with the importance of 
caution in all your money movements. I feared, in your 
great anxiety to settle yourself, that you would be induced to 
give more for the lands where } r ou are planting than the 
future prospect would justify. I feel confident, that lands 
must fall in the West; and that there is no danger in delay in 
making a purchase. Under this impression I wrote you not to 
be in haste, and to be on your guard, so soon as I learned by 
your letters, that you had given up the idea of a settlement 
in Texas, and contemplated a purchase where you are. 3 I 
hope you have got my letters. From all I can hear, I am of 
the impression, that the product of Alabama and Mississippi 
are overestimated. I wrote you, what was the estimate of 
M r Scott of Alabama. Gen 1 Hunt, the Texan minister,* who 
plants in Mississippi told me yesterday that he did not think 
the average yield of Madison county was more than 1000 
pounds of seed cotton to the acre. He puts the bottom lands 
of the Mississippi much higher. If you should conclude to 
purchase, where you are, and could make it provisional, I 
would think it very advisable. It would be important to see, 
what the effect of the next four months will be on the price of 
lands. Alabama and Mississippi are both in a very artificial 
state in relation to their currency; and it is hard to say what is 
to take place. I consider the whole question of the currency

resumption must at least follow ; but unless something is done, 
they will become the means of new expansion, to be followed 
by a shock more terrifick than that, which we have lately 
experienced. A national bank is wholly out of the question, 
and the seperation is the only practicable remedy against the 
return of the shock, but instead of adopting it, there is reason 
to fear, that as the banks resume the Government will again 
become connected with them, without adopting any measure 
to guard against another shock. 

It is altogether uncertain when Congress will adjourn, but 
I think it will be early in July, or the last of June I will 
write you the moment I can ascertain. 

Margaret is in good health, and writes you constantly and is 
much surprised, that you have not received her letters. The 
Physicians have a good deal of hope of restoring Cornelia. 
I think a good deal can be done, but I fear nothing like a com- 
plete restoration. She is very comfortably fixed at Gen 1 
Green's. Anna's health is not robust. She has had a severe 
cold, which has been common here, that has left her quite thin. 
She joins her love to you. My health is good. 

I am glad to learn, that the crop has started fairly and hope 
your expectation may be fully realized. Agriculture is a 
delightful pursuit. . . .

Washington 18 th April 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, I am very glad to learn, that your health 
has improved so much since your return, and I hope that it 
will be so perfectly restored, as to permit you to return in a 
short time to political life. No one of your talents and 
capacity for serving the publick ought to think of retiring, 
unless compelled by bad health, or some other imperious 
cause. It is in vain to think of getting clear of politicks. 
However we may desire to free ourselves from it, we may be 
assured that it will not permit the seperation to take place. 
If the capable and worthy retire, the designing, or worthless 
will take their place. Our destiny, and that of our posterity

is involved in our political institutions and the conduct of the 
Government; and if we do not attend to them chains and 
servitude will be our fate. Their is no section of our coun- 
try, in which the duty imposed on the enlightened and patri- 
otick to devote their time and talents to the country is so 
imperious as in ours. We are surrounded by invisible dan- 
gers, against which nothing can protect us, but our foresight 
and energy. We must be the first people of modern time, or 
the basest and most wretched. Our state has ever had its 
full share of talents and virtue and patriotism in the publick 
councils of the Union, and we must not in this crisis of our 
fate permit any diminution to take place. 

As to myself, I would most gladly retire. My service has 
been long and full of labour; my family is large and my 
means moderate, and I wait with impatience for the moment 
when I can retire consistently with honor and duty. It would 
be to me a day of joy; and I hope that it is not far off. 

I send you my reply to M r Webster, with the copy of his 
speech to which it is an answer. I have not a copy of Clay's 
speech, but I will endeavour to get one at the Senate and, if 
I should, will enclose it. 

The fate of the divorce in the House is doubtful. The 
friends of the measure there will stake its fate on the specie 
section, and sink, or swim with it, which will place me on 
high grounds. The vote will be very close.

Washington 21 st April 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, I am very happy to find from the letters of 
your sister, that she is spending her time so agreably at Mill- 
wood. She is delighted with the place. 

She writes me that she is desirous to commence an addition 
to our House f or[th]with on her return to Pendleton. I think it 
would not be advisable on many accounts, till after my return. 
I cannot obtain Andrew's carpenter till after my return, and 
I have long since learned by sad experience, what it is to 
build in my absence. It would cost me twice as much and the

work- then will not be half as well done. By getting And- 
rews carpenter after my return, and throwing in with him M r 
Stevens and Daniel, so soon as the crop is finished, I could 
build at comparatively small expense, and have it well done 
under my own eye. I wish you to add your weight to mine 
to reconcile her to the course I suggest. I have written her 
fully on the subject. 

I will attend to all your requests before I leave this. J 
have been exceedingly engaged for the last 2 months. The 
whole weight of the opposition was directed against me. The 
papers will show you how I sustained it. I think I may say, 
that Clay and Webster do not feel that they have gained any- 
thing by their attacks. 

The fate of the question is still doubtful. The House will 
take up its own bill, and stake its fate on the specie section, 
which by sustaining the position I took in the Senate, will place 
me on high ground. The vote will be very close. Should 
the bill pass the House, it will pass the Senate, the specie 
portion and all. 

There is a feirce war sprung up between Philadelphia and 
N. York, that will do us no harm. I think, M r Biddle is in 
rather a bad way. In fact, if I mistake not, there is much 
discord in embryo in the North, political and otherwise. Now 
is our time. What a misfortune, that we are divided among 
ourselves. Preston and Thompson have done much mischief- 
more than they ever can repair, if they were to live 100 years. 

I gave a letter to a M r Hastings of Philadelphia to you some 
time since. He came well recommended to me as a man of 
strict integrity, and thoroughly skilled in the cotton business, 
both as a superintendent and mechanician. He goes South to 
make an establishment, if he should be pleased. If you are 
disposed to look that way, I have no doubt, but now is the 
time, and that you cannot get a man that would better suit 
you. If I were in your situation I would not hesitate. You 
could commence almost for nothing, and make your women 
and children your most valuable hands. Many causes con 
spire to make this a very favourable moment. 

Anna joins her love to you. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 397 

To Joel R. Poinsett. 1 

Fort Hill 4 th July 1838 

Mr DEAR SIR, General Gadsden declines the place of com- 
missioner which, he says, will not suit him. He informs me 
that he has written to Cap* Cooper on the subject and, I sup- 
pose, has assigned his reasons to him. I regret that his expe- 
rience and fidelity could not be commanded. He would have 
been of great service to you. I am glad to inform you that 
there is opposition in this District to General Thompson. 2 
M r Walker of Greenville is the candidate. From all I can 
learn he will run the best of those whose services could be 
commanded. 3 In Anderson and Pickens, he will, I think, 
unite the great body in favour of the separation of the Gov- 
ernment and the banks; and will secure a decided majority in 
the two Districts, so that the election will depend on Green- 
ville. I am not so well informed as to the state of publick 
sentiment there; but understand that a portion of those who 
differed from M r Walker on a former occasion are indisposed 
to support him. I hope it is not so, and would regret it 
exceedingly, if it shall be the case. From what 1 hear, M r 
Walker has been taken up without the least regard to former 
political divisions, solely because he was believed to be the 
only available candidate, or, at least, the strongest of them; 
and I feel confident that if Greenville had presented any 
respectable name, the people in this quarter would have rallied 
around it, without regard to differences heretofore. They 
only look to the great question of the day, and this I believe 
to be true of both the former parties in these two Districts; 
and I trust it will be found to be the case with Greenville. 
If so, the election will be certain; but if not, General Thomp- 
son may succeed, which the Nationals everywhere will con- 
sider a great triumph. You can do much to prevent the 
possibility of such an event. If the Mountaineers (?) should 
take a decided stand, all will be right and no one can do so 
much to effect this as yourself. It is also important that

Colonel Gresham and Colonel Norton of Pickens should go 
right. They have not yet announced themselves. The former 
has in a great measure withdrawn from politicks, but still 
has influence. If your relation with them is such that you 
could communicate with one or both, it might do much good. 
Whatever is to be done, should be without delay. The cam- 
paign will open at Anderson next Monday (Sale day) when 
the two candidates will meet, and 1 suppose will be kept up 
with spirit till the election. I hear of no opposition in 
Charleston. It would be a great misfortune if the commer- 
cial metropolis of the state should be misrepresented on a 
question and at a time when she has so much at stake. I had 
supposed there would be no doubt of opposition to the pres- 
ent incumbent there. Can you say what is intended? 

I hope your health is fully restored. You will need all 
your health and strength to go through your highly respon- 
sible and laborious duties. I had the pleasure of finding all 
well on my return, with the prospect of a good crop. I would 
be glad to hear from you at your early convenience. With 
my best respects to M rs Poinsett believe me to be

. . . The Preston dinner is considered a great failure. Gen 1 
Thompson has opposition, M r Walker of Greenville. The dis- 
trict is very sound on the great question, but still he may not 
be defeated. He and his opponent met inonday last, at Ander- 
son, and the General declared himself against M r Clay, and a 
national bank, and decidedly in my favour, and resorted to 
to all kind of artifice to mystify the subject, in a speech of 
near three hours. Whether his art and duplicity will save 
him remains to be seen. His opponent is sensible; but not his 
match on the stump. 1 was not present of course, and have 
my information from others. Walker will probably be elected, 
but the result is not certain. If the issue was fairly made up, 
he would beat three to one.

To Robert Bamwell Rhett. 1 c. c. 

Fort Hill Sep*. 13 th 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, All of your friends are exceedingly gratified 
by your cordial welcome by your constituents. Their good 
opinion is worth possessing for it is a district which does not 
readily withdraw confidence when once bestowed. I have read 
the account of the dinner given to you with much interest. 
The toasts are strong and well expressed but I cannot but 
think that some of them indicated too strong a leaning towards 
the administration at this early stage. It seems to me that 
our true course is to occupy the old and independent ground 
on which we have stood for so many years holding our prin- 
ciples and policy above the Presidential election and giving a 
cordial support to the administration just as far as they sup- 
port them without farther commitment or identification. By 
thus acting we will command the respect of all parties and 
retain the attachment of most of our old friends whose just 
aversion to the late administration and the means by which 
the present came into power has been so great as to drive 
them for a time from adopting the proper course. If we act 
properly the great body will ultimately join us. But there is 
still a higher inducement. It seems to me to be the only 
course calculated to control those in power and ultimately to 
give a triumph to our cherished principles and policy. If we 
commit ourselves in advance the danger is that they will 
shape their course to gain the support of other interests and 
we may thus be betrayed on the great measure in relation to 
which we have assumed so much responsibility and all other 
measures naturally connected with it without the possibility 
of extricating ourselves without loss of character and influence. 
In this connection I must say I object to the name of demo- 
crat as applied to us or our party. It has been more particu- 
larly appropriated to those who have adhered to the adminis- 
tration while we have assumed the name of State rights and 
Republican party. In truth the word democrat better applies 
to the north than the South and as usually understood means

those who are in favour of the government of the absolute 
numerical majority to which I am utterly opposed and the 
prevalence of which would destroy our system and destroy 
the South. Thus. thinking I have regretted to see the Chron- 
icle in the absence of Cralle and the Mercury l I think leaning 
a little too much in the same direction. I would write forth- 
with to Cralle in relation to it but it b uncertain where a letter 
would reach him. When I last heard from him he was at the 
White Sulphur Springs and as soon as I can learn where a 
letter would find him I will write to him. 

I would also write to Stuart but I think a letter from you 
to put him on his guard would be more delicate and I do hope 
if you concur in these views you will write him without delay. 
I have long since learned that position is everything in poli- 
tics as well as war and as we are volunteers and not mercena- 
ries looking to a cause and not pay it is to us all important. 

M r Whitner announced himself yesterday at Pickens Court 
House as a candidate in opposition to Gen. Thompson so we 
shall have a fair contest. The Gen. has the advantage in the 
start and in being in possession but M r W. in the cause and 
having the intelligence of the district with him. They both 
addressed the people about 500 present and Whitner was cer- 
tainly well received. The Gen. is giving ground daily. He 
said in the alternative between the bank and the constitutional 
treasury he would support the latter. He also repudiates the 
pet bank system and goes for special deposites without seem- 
ing to have any distinct ideas about it. 

Let me hear from you as early as convenient.

DEAR SIR, I owe you an apology for not acknowledging 
at an earlier period, the obligation I am under to you for 

1 The Charleston Mercury, edited by J. A. Stuart. 

2 From a draft in Calhoun's handwriting. Henry Vethake,a native of British Guiana, 
was successively professor in Rutgers, Princeton, and Dickinson colleges, the University 
of the City of New York, Washington College, Virginia (where he was at the time of 
this letter), the University of Pennsylvania, and the Philadelphia Polytechnic College. 
His Principles of Political Economy was published in 1838. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 401 

your volume on the principles of political economy. The 
truth is, I was so much occupied with my publick duties, 
during- the late session, that I had but little time for reading, 
and since then, an unexpected delay in receiving my papers 
and books from Washington, has deprived me of the pleasure 
of reading your treatise till within the last few days. 

I read it with much pleasure, not that I agree with all your 
positions, for there are several and those important ones, to 
which I cannot give my full assent, but it contains much in 
which I heartily concur, and the whole is written in a sperit 
of truth and candour worthy of all commendation. I am 
particularly pleased, that you have brought your enquiries 
down to the present time, and have touched on the leading 
questions of the day, with all the coolness and impartiality, 
that usually belongs to abstract philosophical disquisitions. 

Among the positions, in which I do not concur, is the one, 
that duties on imports in all cases fall on the consumer and 
which you apply to the late Tariff. 1 must think that you 
have not read the discussion on that important question, as 
fully and attentively as it merits. It is not possible for me to 
do justice to the opposite side in the limited space of a letter, 
but as the question is one of deep importance in its political 
bearing, I propose to suggest a few ideas for your reflection. 
It seems to me, that in all questions of the kind, there is an 
important General principle entirely overlooked; that the 
effect of taxes of any description, viewed in the abstract, is to 
depress, and not to raise prices, as is generally supposed. I 
say viewed in the abstract, for it is clear, that the necessary 
effect of a tax is to raise the value of money, by creating a 
new demand for it, and which, abstractly considered, without 
taking into consideration any counteracting cause, which may 
accompany it, must necessarily depress prices. To illustrate 
the principle, suppose a country having a circulation of ten 
millions of dollars, which can be neither increased, nor dimin- 
ished, and suppose a tax to be laid of any discription, that 
will have the effect of abstracting habitually from the ordi- 
nary use to which it has been applied, two millions, in col- 
lecting, and paying away its proceeds, it is clear, that the 
ordinary business of the country must now be transacted with 
eight instead of ten millions, and that prices must fall pro- 
HIST 99 VOL ii 26 



402 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

portionally, that is one fifth. It is also clear, in the case sup- 
posed, that the producer could not transfer the burthen of the 
tax, be it what it may, from himself to the consumer. The 
fall of prices would fall on his products, as well as every other 
article, which would be a clear loss to him, in addition to the 
portion of the tax he might pay as his share, while it is equally 
clear that the consumer would gain by the fall of prices. 

It is not less clear, that so long as the quantity of money 
remained the same, this state of things would continue, and 
that the only counteracting cause, that can be imagined, would 
be an increase of the quantity of money in circulation, and 
that the increase, to enable the producing class to shift the 
burthen, must be so great, as not only to replace the two 
millions abstracted by supposition from circulation, but to 
raise prices so far above their former level, as to return the 
amount of the tax, that might fall to their share. 

The next consideration is, what sum that would require, and 
on whom the expense of its introduction must fall, which I 
leave to your investigation, with the simple expression of an 
opinion, without assigning the reasons, that it would fall 
wholly on the producing class. I have left the consideration 
of a paper circulation to supply the deficit out of view, as my 
object is merely to present the subject in its most simple 
form. 

But I do not rest the operation of the tariif on this general 
abstract position. There is another not less important, which 
bears more directly on the point of view in which I am con- 
sidering it, which has been as completely overlooked. 

1 lay it down as a principle, that to determine where a tax 
ultimately falls, we must look not only to the tax, but to its 
desbursement. To seperate them is but to take a half way 
view. The one implies the other, and is but its counterpart. 
A tax is but a mode of taking away property, and the appro- 
priation, or disbursement, but a mode of giving it. The sum 
abstracted by the tax is not lost, and to ascertain where the 
burthen falls, we must not only ascertain from whom it is 
taken but also to whom it is given. They form parts of one 
and the same process, and cannot be regarded seperately 
without falling into great and dangerous errors. The com- 
plaint of the South was not, that the planters (the producers 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 403 

of our staples) bore all of the burthen of the Tariff, but that 
it was a tax on their foreign exchange, which in combination 
with a system of partial and unequal disbursements transferee! 
annually a large and exhausting amount of the proceeds of 
their labour to other sections of the Union. To understand 
the force of this complaint, it is necessary to look to the state 
of the facts. 

The Tariff of '28 exacted 32 millions out of an importation 
of 64: millions; that is it passed into the treasury one half of 
the value of the whole of the imports estimated at the invoice 
price adding thereto ten per cent. The staple states which 
constitute about | of the population of the Union furnished 
about 42 millions of the means by which the imports were paid 
for, that is f of the population furnished about | of the means 
by which our foreign exchanges were carried on. Now I hold 
it certain, that if the staple states had a seperate custom House 
of their own, the same duties, with the same amount of ex- 
ports, and of course imports, would have passed into their 
custom House at least 21 millions. I say at least, for it is 
manifest they would have yielded much more, as they would 
gain a proportional amount on the vast exchanges between 
them and the other states. 1 make the statement merely for 
illustration. No one would be more opposed to any thing of 
the kind than myself. I am for reform, but not for revolu- 
tion, nor ever have been. 

Nor is it less clear, that they would have got their supplies 
as low, or nearly so, under the same rates of duties through 
their own seperate custom House, as they did through that of 
the Union. The other states would have been compelled to 
compete with the rest of the world, and sell as low, or have 
lost our market. 

It is not less clear, that this vast amount appropriated to 
the various objects of improvements in those states, and giv- 
ing employment to a corresponding amount of labour, would 
have diffused industry and prosperity in every direction. 
Now what was the fact? Out of the 32 millions collected, not 
more than 4 millions at the out side was disbursed in the Sta- 
ple States, the residue (17 mil) was added to the 11 millions, 
exacted out of the foreign exchanges of the other states, which 
raised their disbursements to 28 millions. The 17 millions 



404 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

was in fact lost to our consumption and added to theirs. We 
made no complaint that we were taxed for what we consumed, 
but that we were not permitted to consume the products of 
our own labour. 

This will be still more manifest if possible, if we suppose 
the duties were paid in kind, and that the planters were their 
own s[h]ippers, which is taking it in the most simple form free 
from all complication. Suppose then a Carolina planter raised 
100 bales of cotton, and shipped it to Liverpool and received 
in exchange one hundred pieces of goods, and he had to deliver 
50 pieces at the custom House of Charleston for the liberty of 
introducing the residue. Suppose the 50 left at the custom 
House to be appropriated to the benefit of the non staple 
growing States, is it not clear, that it would deprive us of the 
consumption of the 50, and would add that to their consump- 
tion, and that the amount consumed, so far from being the 
measure of the burthen imposed, in fact is the measure of our 
loss and their gain. Nor would the result be varied, if money 
instead of goods be paid for the duties, and if a factor, or a 
merchant instead of the planter should make the shipment, as 
I could most clearly show. I would go through the process, 
but it would extend this letter to an unreasonable length, and 
I feel confident, your clear understanding will be able to trace 
it through without my aid. 

These views have been often presented, but never met. 
One of the ablest of the Senators in opposition, acknowledged 
that he could not answer them, tho' he would not yield his 
assent, and M r Clay signally failed in his attempt to meet them. 
I have never had but one answer attempted, that was even 
plausible, except indeed, that the appropriations or disburse- 
ments were not gifts, but payments for publick services 
rendered, or supposed to be; as if the vast increase of employ- 
ment which follows the disbursement of so large a sum was 
not the most effectual mode of increasing the population and 
wealth of the favoured portion far more so than a mere dona- 
tion could possibly be. 

I have presented these views to you in this most imperfect 
manner, under the belief that your object is truth. If they 
be true, they have a most important bearing, that ought to 
be known and respected; but if not, their error ought to be 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 405 

clearly and explicitly pointed out. Many resist the conclu- 
sion to which they lead because they believe it to be unfavour- 
able to the duration of the Union, which appears to me the 
extreme of folly. Our belief cannot alter the nature of things; 
and if it be true, the only mode of preserving our Union, at 
least in peace and harmony, is to moderate the fiscal action of 
the General Government. I have touched on this important 
point in my report on executive patronage in the session of 
35, 36 and which I would be much gratified for you to cast 
your eyes over, if you should have an opportunity.

Fort Hill 11 th Oct r 1838 

DEAR SIR, I learn from your letter to Andrew, that you 
and M rs Green expect to be in Augusta about the 10 th of next 
month, on your way to Florida, with a part of your family. 
Anna will be married on the 13 th of that month, 2 and it will 
afford her and M rs Calhoun and myself much pleasure, if your- 
self and M rs Green, with such portion of your family, as may 
accompany you should be present on the occasion. It would 
delay you but a short time, and we must insist, that you will 
not permit any -supposed urgency of your business to deprive 
us of the pleasure of your company. Anna wrote to Eliza by 
yesterday's mail. I hope she has received her letter. 

Andrew left this morning for Alabama; and expects to meet 
you on his return in Augusta. 

I am much gratified to learn, that you have so far closed 
your arrangements in relation to your Cumberland property; 
and hope you may realize your most sanguine anticipations. 

The election in this District has terminated in the election 
of Thompson by a very large majority. A variety of causes 
has contributed to the result. Among others, his opponent 
came out too late. Thompson had canvassed the District 
thoroughly before he started. He is the Gen 1 of the Brigade, 
and had gone round all the musters and told his own story

without opposition, or contradiction. The boldness of his 
denials and contradictions is almost without example. He 
denied, that he was for a national bank, declared himself 
opposed to the pet banks, and the use of the publick funds to 
bank on, and avowed, that he had no political connection with 
the national party or their leaders. He declared he was for 
the special deposit system, which he made to mean anything 
that suited his purpose, and cried out dictation and persecu- 
tion. These are some of the arts by which he has for a time 
deluded the people. 

I would be glad to hear from you at your early convenience, 
and to learn whether we may anticipate the pleasure of your 
company.

is so much better.

Fort Hill 26 th Oct r 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, I received by the mail of yesterday .your 
letter of the 14 th Ins*; and so far from requiring an apology 
for the liberty which you have taken, I am much obliged to 
you for the course, which you have pursued. I only wish 
that all my political friends would take the same candid and 
friendly course to ascertain the facts and views on which I act, 
before they undertake to disapprove. 

You are right in supposing that I have nothing to conceal. 
It is my consolation, and it has sustained me in all the difficult 
scenes through which I have passed, that I have never done a 
publick act, but under the solemn sense of duty, and have 
never abstained from performing any which I believed my 
duty required me to do, be the danger and difficulty what they 
may; and so far from desiring concealment, I only wish, that 
all the world could see the motives that govern me, in all of my 
publick acts. But enough of this. 

I saw the article in the Mercury to which you refer, and 
saw it with regret; not that there was anything wrong in the 
affair to which it relates, but because I saw at once, that it was 



a draft in Calhoun's handwriting.

calculated to make an erroneous impression, and would give 
those who were so disposed, an opportunit}^ to pervert and 
misrepresent my motives. But since it has been the incident 
by which a correspondence has been opened between us, and 
thereby has afforded me an opportunity to give to one, for 
whom I have so much respect, not only the information 
desired, but a general exposition of my position and views, in 
relation to the two contending parties in the Union. 

In answer then to your question, whether k "l have entered 
into consultation with the friends of M r Van Buren, as to any 
means to be devised to sustain him," my reply is no, not in a 
single instance; but nevertheless the statement of M r Poinsett 
is substantially correct. M r Legare was elected, as the friend 
of the administration, but had decidedly opposed its leading 
measure, and it was natural, that M r Poinsett, as a member 
of the administration, should desire to see him succeeded by 
another favourable to the measure, on which he and his asso- 
ciates in power had staked themselves. Agreeing with the 
administration in the measure, and believing it to be indis- 
pensible to effect the great objects for which we of the state 
rights party had so long contended, I concurred in the desire 
to see M r Legare succeeded by another, 1 who might agree with 
me in the measure. In fact, I thought it almost indispensible, 
that the commercial metropolis of the State should be cor- 
rectly represented on a question, in which it had so much at 
stake. Having thus a common desire, as far as the Charleston 
election was concerned, it followed as a consequence, that 
there should be some understanding in relation to it to pre- 
vent conflict of action, and in a casual interview the conversa- 
tion took place which he states in his letter; but I certainly 
never expected, that my name should ever be connected with 
any communication he might make to his friends. The whole 
amount was that our friends in the District, would support 
any sound and competent individual, whom he and his friends 
should start as a candidate, and who entertained correct views 
in relation to the subject in question, without reference to 
pas[t] political differences in the State. 

1 Hugh S. Legar6 represented Charleston in the 25th Congress (1837-1839), but.was not 
re-elected. 



408 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Here let me remark, that in thus acting, I only conformed 
to a principle which I had laid down for myself , so soon as we 
got through the great contest in reference to nullification. 
Foreseeing that other questions would arise in a short time, 
such as abolition and that which now agitates the country, in 
which this State and all the South would have a deep stake, 
and which would require our united exertions to carry through 
successfully, I advised all of my friends to terminate our con- 
troversy at the earliest period, and restore Union and harmony 
to the State as soon as possible. We are now enjoying the 
benefit of so liberal and prudent a course, by being more united 
than the State has ever been on any other great question. 
Would to God that the whole South (the weak and exposed 
portion of the Union) had adopted the same course, and merged 
all of their local, and passed differences in one general effort 
for their common interest. Had they so acted how different 
would be our condition and influence at this day. 

Having now answered your question, I now turn to define 
my own position, and that, which in my opinion, the whole 
state rights party and the entire south ought to take at this 
most important juncture of our affairs. 

I then have abandoned not a single principle, changed no 
opinion, or any of my political relations. I stand, as I have 
long stood, disconnected from all parties, except the old state 
rights party of '99 to which I cordially belong, and in whose 
ranks, with the blessing of God ? I intend to die. My whole 
nature, and system of thinking must undergo a complete and 
entire revolution, before I can change. Even my personal 
relation with M r Van Buren remains unchanged. I have not 
been in the Presidents House nor have had any intercourse 
with him directly or, indirectly in eight years. In taking the 
course I did in relation to the Constitutional treasuiy, and on 
every other question since, I have acted in strict conformity 
to principles avowed years before, and yet there has been 
an organized movement through news papers, letter writers 
and, I fear, private correspondence, to hold me up as an apos- 
tate, in which papers professing to be Republican (the Rich- 
mond Whig, the Telescope and the Augusta Chronicle and 
some others) have joined. But while I have thus continued to 
occupy immovably my old position, I have deemed it my duty 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 409 

to give the administration an honest and sincere support, as 
far as the Constitutional treasury is concerned, and all other 
measures according with our principles and policy. I have 
even felt it my duty to go farther, and to use the influence, 
which my position gives me to control their movement, so as 
to bring them into the support of our principles and policy. 
As much as the part} 7 has strayed from the true principles and 
policy of the Republican party, I believe that our only recruit- 
ing ground is in their ranks. We can have no hopes from 
that of the Nationals, or Northern Whigs. Not only their 
acts, but their principles are opposed to us. They are consol- 
idationists by profession sincerely so, and cannot be brought 
into our ranks, without a complete conversion; while on the 
contrary, the great body of the administration, or democratick 
party, profess for the most part our principles, while they 
were diverting from them in practice. In addition, there is a 
natural conflict in the non slave holding states, which tends to 
throw the democratick party on our side and the nationals 
against us, of which we see strong proof on 'the abolition 
question. It would have been impossible to have got a single 
man of the latter, in either House, to subscribe to the princi- 
ples in relation to abolition, to which the whole body of the 
former agreed. 

Thus thinking, I have felt it to be also my duty, not only 
to use my position to bring them to our views, but to treat 
them with kindness and conciliation, and I would ask our 
friends, how else can we expect union among ourselves at the 
South ? if any other course should be pursued, we would but 
perpetuate the present unfortunate difference among ourselves. 
But, while acting on these views, 1 have never left it to be 
doubted by words, or acts, but that I occupied a distinct and 
seperate position and would oppose any act of the party that 
did not accord with our principles and policy; as much so as 
if it came from the Nationals. 

As to the Presidential contest, I do not permit myself to 
look to It. There is time enough to decide on our course in 
relation to it. As no consideration on earth would induce me 
to sacrifice my principles for my own advancement even to 
that highest office (of which I have given ample proof) none 
certainly can induce me to sacrifice them for the advancement 



410 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

of others, who have no claims on me whatever. The moment 
we enter into the presidential canvas, for a candidate, whose 
principles and policy do not accord with ours, our influence 
and control would be lost; but if we stand fast on our own 
ground, with the understanding, that we shall either take no 
part at all, or throw our weight, where it will be the most 
effective to advance our own interests, our control will be 
felt to the last with powerful effect. 

From what I have stated, it will be easy to conjecture, what, 
in my opinion, ought to be the course of our party; and, if 
the}^ could be induced to act on it, I would underwrite (?) for 
the final triumph of our principles, and with them, the estab- 
lishment of our security and prosperity. 

Let me say in conclusion, that nothing has given me more 
pain than the seperation of so many of my friends from me 
on the great question of the day; and nothing would give 
more pleasure than the complete restoration of harmony in 
our ranks. To effect this, no act of conciliation shall be want- 
ing on my part. I shall remember those who stood by us in 
the great conflict with the General Government with kindness 
to my last moment; tho' many of them, I think, have not 
done me justice. After so many sacrifices, and so many 
proofs of indifference to myself and devotion to the South 
and our free institutions, it is hard to have my motives called 
in question, and that for acting in strict conformity to prin- 
ciples, which I had avowed and supported years before. But 
I am prepared to forget all for the common good. 

Now let me say, before I close, that I have given you my 
views fully and explicitly; and I hope, satisfactorily. But if 
there be an} T point omitted, or which you, or any other friend 
may think reguire[s] further explanation, I hope you will not 
fail to communicate it to me. Nothing is more gratifying to 
me, than to lay open the motives and reasons for my public k 
acts, to those who have any right to know them. 

You will, of course, understand that what I have written is 
not for the papers; but I can have no possible objection to 
your showing this to such friends, as you ma} T think proper. 

1 would be glad to have the acknowledgement of the receipt 
of this, so that I may know that you have received it and to 
hear from you frequently.

Fort Hill Oct. 28 th 1838 

Mr DEAR SIR, Enclosed 3^011 have my resignation of my 
place in the direction of the Charleston and Cincinnati Rail 
Road Company. 

In addition to the reason 2 which I have assigned in my let- 
ter of resignation, and which of itself is ample, I feel bound 
to say to you in candour, that there is another and decided 
reason with me. I see by the last report enough to satisfy me 
that it is resolved to carry the road through by the French 
Broad route. I have no doubt of your sincere and deep con- 
viction in its favour, but as deep as yours is for it, mine is no 
less deep and sincere against it. The more I reflect, the more 
thorough is my conviction of its complete and disastrous fail- 
ure, should it be attempted; and, thus thinking, I cannot bring 
my mind to continue to occupy a place in the direction, and 
share in the responsibility of a measure which my judgment 
cannot approve. 

But at the same time, as the route is resolved on, you have 
my best wishes for its success. No one would rejoice more 
than myself to find in the end that you were right, and that I 
was mistaken. I believe the success of a connection of the 
West is of the last importance to us politically and commer- 
cially. 1, as you know, was among the first to suggest and 
second it with all my zeal, and my opinion remains unchanged. 
But as important as 1 consider the successful execution of the 
project, in the same degree do I consider its failure as disas- 
trous every way to the State. I do verily believe, that 
Charleston has more advantages in her position for the West- 
ern trade, than any city on the Atlantic, but to develope 
them, we ought to look to the Tennessee instead of the Ohio, 
and much farther to the West than Cincinnati or Lexington. 
With all the lights 1 have, there are two routes by all com- 
parison superior to all others; the one through Georgia to 
Ross' landing, or thereabouts, and the other by Savannah 
river from Hamburgh to the head of steam boat navigation on

the Little Tennessee. If I am not mistaken, steam navigation 
might be brought by the latter within 100 miles, or much 
less, between the Eastern and Western waters, for the fourth 
part the expense which the projected route by the French 
Broad would cost; and that it would not cost half the sum to 
bring a ton weight by that route to Charleston, even from 
Cincinnati or Pittsburg, as it will by the French Broad raiJ 
way, if the navigation of the Tennessee should be improved 
as it will be for steam navigation. 

I throw out these suggestions, not of course to influence 
your judgment, which seems to be deliberately made up in 
favour of the French Broad route, but simply as indicating 
the state of my own mind; and from which you will see it 
would be doing injustice to myself to remain longer in the 
direction. 

Let me say to you in conclusion, both as a friend to yourself 
and the Road, not to move beyond Columbia till it is ascer- 
tained what is the result of the Georgia route. 



To Robert Y. Hayne. 1 c. c. 

Fort Hill Nov. 17 th 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have received your two letters in answer 
to mine covering my resignation in the direction of the 
Charleston and Cincinnati rail road company. 

In resigning, it was no part of my intention to embarrass 
the work, or weaken the publick confidence in the direction; 
to avoid the possibility of which I abstained from assigning 
one of the reasons which governed me in my note of resigna- 
tion. Before the publick my resignation will stand exactly 
where you express a desire it should; but at the same time I 
thought it due both to you and myself, that I should assign the 
other, which had great weight with me; and such is still my 
opinion. Either seperately is sufficient, and the two taken in 
conjunction, appear to nry mind irresistible; nor can I see in 
any of the considerations you suggest, reasons to change my 
opinion. My conviction of the failure of the enterprise is deep,

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 413 

accompanied by the belief, that every foot the road 'may 
progress beyond the point now arrived at, in that direction, 
will but increase the embarrassment. 

You ask, what is to be done? That is a serious question, 
which I am not prepared to answer, but 1 would say, without 
hesitation, that neither the charter of the bank, nor the road 
ought to be forfeited, nor any understanding, or pledge to 
other States violated, if it be possible to avoid it without dis- 
astrous consequences. Thus thinking, I would certainly say, 
that, if the other States would complete the work within their 
respective limits, or progress proportionally with us toward 
such completion, we ought in good faith meet them on our 
borders, though I believe that the work if completed through- 
out, would not give an income that would keep it up. Other 
routes in my opinion having far greater natural advantages 
would supercede it. I am aware of the commitments in 
favour of the route (for I have read attentively everything 
that has been published in relation to it) and know that it 
would be embarrassing to make a change. It is far from my 
wish to increase the embarrassments, but personally, I feel 
none of them. I have been from the first opposed to the route. 
In reply to a letter from M r Williams, who first proposed a 
connection between Charleston and Cincinnati, I stated, that 
we must turn the Alleghany to the South West, as New York 
had to the North East, and the Tennessee river was to us, what 
the North river was to New York. With this view, I pro- 
posed to aim at a point on that river above the Muscle Shoals 
and below the Suck. Learning afterwards that the Alleghany 
chain terminated farther east than I had supposed, and that 
the Tennessee might be struck at a near point, higher up and 
on a shorter route, passing through a more level country, I 
opened a correspondence with some influential citizens of 
Georgia, proposing that route, as the line of communication 
between the ports of the two States and the Western Waters, 
to be opened by the joint efforts of the two. With this view, 
in part, I took Columbia on my way to Washington at the 
next session, when as you will remember, I proposed it to both 
you and Hamilton, but without success. That route, Georgia 
has since adopted, but with a direction looking wholly to her 



414 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

own interests, and not to that of the two States jointly, as 
might at that early stage have been easily effected. 

Finding so strong an aversion to co-operate with Georgia, 
and believing that the success of the work depended on lean- 
ing as far to the West as possible, and striking the Tennessee 
river instead of the Ohio, I next endeavoured to find a route 
over the mountains at some point as far West as possible, with- 
out touching Georgia, to meet these views. At one time, I 
hoped I had succeeded but having failed on that my next hope 
was that time or experience before it was too late would effect 
a change in public opinion in favour of the views I entertained. 
With this hope, I assented cheerfully to the proposition to 
purchase the Hamburgh road, as it looked in the right direc- 
tion, and would afford an opportunity to unite our system of 
improvement with that of Georgia, to which we must look 
ultimately, in my opinion, for the completion of the great 
object we have in view. But inferring from the last report, 
that it is intended to persist in carrying through the enter- 
prise by the route of the French Broad, I felt that a period 
had been reached, when with my opinion, I could no longer 
continue, with propriety, a member of the direction. How 
could I, when I believe to go beyond Columbia unless with a 
full understanding that the other States will do their share 
will but add to our embarrassment, and that, if the road was 
finished, it would be superceded by the one through Georgia. 
In confirmation of this, I will state a few facts. I learn from 
one of the Engineers of that road, that the whole road from 
the Chattahoochie to the Tennessee, which comprehends the 
entire mountain chain, will be either graded, or under con- 
tract, in the Spring, and that the entire distance from Milledge- 
ville (to which it is now contemplated to take the road) will 
not cost more than $15,000 per mile, say 200 miles, including 
the mountain chain. 1 also learn that the Knoxville and 
Hiwassee rail-road is under active execution, and will soon 
join this road; such is the great facility the route affords. 
The fact is, that the whole road will be executed and the con- 
nection with the West completed, before we are fairly under 
way, and long before we have encountered our main difficul- 
ties. Now, when we take into consideration, the greater 
cheapness; the far more favourable grade; the vast amount of 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 415 

business and travelling, which the Tennessee river and the 
numerous branches which -will fall in, will throw into the road, 
with the superior fertility and population of the country 
through which it will pass, can it be doubted, but that the 
rate of transportation, may be and will be, so reduced on it, 
compared with ours, that the trade of Knoxville itself will 
pass through it to Charleston, in preference to ours, even if 
it was completed. 

But you say, that no other route could have secured the 
passage of the rail road bank charter, or commanded a ma- 
jority of our Legislature in its favour. Taking the view that 
you do of the bank, that certainly is a strong consideration, 
but here again it has been our misfortune to differ. One of 
my objections to the route was, that it could not sustain itself 
by its own advantages, without the artificial aid of the bank, 
to which I was opposed, among other grounds, because the 
union of the two powers in the same company, that over the 
currency and intercourse of the country, would be dangerous 
to our free institutions, in which, I pray, I may be deceived. 
But having been over-ruled, I acquiesced, and wish the insti- 
tution every success, and I trust that it may prove as you sug- 
gest, the antagonist of a national bank. I fear that your 
impression, that no other route could have got the support of 
the State is but too true, and, I apprehend, that it will add 
another instance to the many others, of important undertak- 
ings defeated through selfish and local feelings. But, I hope, 
in all this I may be in error. I have not stated my views in a 
spirit of opposition, but simply to place before you the 
grounds on which I act, and to free myself from all responsi- 
bility where I cannot have confidence. Should the work go on, 
I shall wish both you and it great success. We are all in the 
same ship, and must share alike in the good or bad fortune of 
the State; and, let me add, in conclusion, that you cannot pos- 
sibly feel more pain in differing from me, than I do in differ- 
ing from you. I shall ever remember the important scenes in 
which we have acted together with pleasure and the important 
service which you have rendered the State and the Union. I 
hope that our differences shall never effect our personal rela- 
tions, and that those that are passed, are the last we shall ever 
experience. 



416 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

As to what you say of the abolition question, we do not 
differ. The danger is great and menacing, and I have long- 
thought, and still think, that the South ought to meet in Con- 
vention, in relation to it. You know, that such was my opin- 
ion years ago. Had my counsel prevailed, the question would 
have been met decidedly, as soon as it was ascertained that the 
non-slave holding states declined putting it down themselves, 
as every Southern State was pledged to do. That was the 
time. We shall never have so good an opportunity again. 
You will recollect, I so expressed myself to you Hamilton and 
MDuffie at Columbia, in our consultation on the subject, at 
the time. Finding different views were taken, I resolved to 
do my best in Congress to guard against the danger and to 
rouse the South to a sense of its danger. My first effort was 
to unite both parties at the North against the abolitionists, 
but when I found that to be impossible, my next was to force 
a conflict between them, so as to throw the sounder on our 
side, in their political struggles at home. With this view, I 
moved the resolutions of last w r inter, which have, in a great 
measure, effected the object I had in view. Should it finally 
accomplish what was intended, it may prevent for the present 
a conflict, but 1 look only to ourselves for permanent security. 
I, for one, am prepared at the earliest period to go into Con- 
vention, and bring the question to an issue. The sooner the 
better for all parties and I will add, that the quicker the issue 
is made up and the bolder the measures adopted, the better 
for all parties. 

I have written you a long and I fear a tedious letter, but I 
have not said half I desired to do. I expect to leave for 
Washington about the 24 th and shall probably take Charleston 
in my way, and stay a day. Should you be in the City I 
shall be glad to see you and converse fully on other subjects.

MY DEAR SIR, M r . Bowman [?], my factor in Charleston 
writes me, that he has received the Portrait from M r . Peile, 2

and that the cost including the difference of exchange is 
$103 T Vu, which you will please pay my brother William on 
my account. I hope you will be pleased with it. 

I would have been very glad to have had an opportunity of 
conversing with you before 1 went on to Washington, but 
apprehend I shall not, as it is my intention to take the Wil- 
mington route. I suppose you will have a quiet session at 
Columbia. As [at] present advised, I think no movement 
ought to be made at Columbia on the great question of the 
day. I regard the publick mind as fully settled down in the 
State in relation to it, and that the fall of Clay, which seems 
almost certain, is the Signal for the complete prostration of 
Preston, Thompson and others of his active and leading par- 
tisans in this State and the South generally. In the event of 
his fall, there is no person, nor any ground on which they can 
rally, and it would seem good policy to be quiet, where vic- 
tory is secure without additional effort. I am even of the 
impression, that the true course in Congress at the next Ses- 
sion in relation to the question for the friends of the measure 
is inaction. The nationals and their allies are in a majority 
in relation to it, and after their victory at the last and the 
regular session the responsibility ought to be on them. These, 
however, are but impressions. The real state of things, .both 
at Columbia and Washington, may be such, as to compel the 
opposite course, of which those on the spot must judge. 

I am also of the impression, that our true line of policy at 
Washington at the next session is to shape our course in refer- 
ence to the finances of the country, which, if I do not mistake 
are reaching an interesting crisis. Revenue, under the com- 
promise, has been regularly falling off for some time, while 
the expenditures have been increasing, till we have reached a 
point where the latter greatly exceed the former, with an in- 
creasing diminution on its part, which must continue till the 
year 1842. It follows, that one of three things must speedily 
take place; the Tariff must be renewed; a new debt contracted, 
or the expenditures be reduced fully one half and that without 
delay. Our policy is clear, to adhere to the compromise; keep 
down the Tariff; prevent the creation of another debt; to sus- 
tain those, who sustain our policy and oppose those who oppose 
it, be it the administration or the Whigs, without regard to 
HIST 99 VOL ii 27

the presidential election or the part}^ politicks of the day. 
This line of policy is important to give an ascendancy to our 
principles and policy, and, if I do not greatly mistake, the 
times are highly favourable to its success. Should we succeed 
all at which we have ever aimed, may be fully accomplished. 
I hope you will write me fully and keep me acquainted with 
all that it may be important for me to know during the Ses- 
sion. I rely on you for correct and full intelligence. I shall 
leave about the 24 th and expect to be at Washington by the 
commencement of the Session.

Fort Hill Nov. 18 th 1838 

DEAR SIR, Your letter presents many interesting facts and 
views. 1 have never doubted but that our success depended 
on the co-operation with Georgia and have throughout acted 
on that belief. I believe I was the first to bring to the public 
attention the great advantages of the route which Georgia has 
adopted and I exerted myself to bring about a co-operation 
between the two States to undertake it with their joint means 
and ^counsel but was over-ruled. Next to that route and 
superior to it in some respects is the one by the Savannah 
river and the Rabun Gap. The road should proceed directly 
up the River from Hamburgh and should be attended either 
by canal or slack water navigation to the foot of the moun- 
tains. The route is eminently favourable for a road canal or 
slack water navigation the whole way. The distance is about 
146 miles which would leave an interval of about 76 miles to 
steam navigation on [the] Little Tennessee which might be 
filled by rail-road or canal or both. I am rather inclined to 
think that this in time will be the great route. Towards its 
undertaking and completion the charter to which you refer 
is of vast importance but 1 fear it is yet a little too soon to 
agitate the subject in this State. The infatuation in favour of 
the French Broad route is yet too strong but is daily giving 
way and I hope in a year the move that you desire may be

made with advantage. 1 think it probable our project will halt 
at Columbia. The rapid execution of the road through 
Georgia compared with the slow and difficult progress of 
ours will open the e}^es of thousands and compel M r Blanding 
and his associates to reflect on the consequences of going 
farther with their mad project. 

In the mean time much may be done by correspondence 
and the company to which you refer must not permit their 
charter to be forfeited. It is vastly important to keep it alive 
and await events without discouragement. 



To A. H. Pendleton. 1 

Fort Hill 19 th Nov r 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you some time since, and enclosed a 
copy of a letter to D r Danall which I hope you have received. 
I now write to acknowledge yours of the first instanft], and 
to make some suggestions on the points on which you desire 
my opinion. 

You are decidedly right in supposing you ought at this 
early stage to be cautious in interfering with local questions. 

I am decidedly of the opinion, that the true policy at this 
time in our local affairs is, to be as still and quiet as possible. 
Our whole weight and influence will be required to carry 
through the great reform, for which we have so long contended 
in the General Government. Now is our time to complete the 
work. Everything is propitious, even the run of the late 
elections. We must now press forward to seize the prise, 
beginning with a thorough reform in the fiscal action of the 
Government, both in the revenue and disbursements. The 
State is now almost unanimous; at least as much so as we can 
hope; and our great object should be to keep it so. Any 
movement of the kind you suggest in the Legislature would, 
to say nothing of their merit, distract the state to the center. 
All the discontented would seize on the occasion with the 
view to recover their lost cast. 

But this is a mere consideration of policy. My objection 
lies far deeper; to the proposed changes themselves. If I

understand their nature as contemplated by some of our 
friends, I am decidedly of the opinion they would make a 
fatal revolution in the admirable institutions of our State. 

The tendency of our state Government, as it now stands, is 
to Union among ourselves, as experience amply proves. We 
are almost entirely free from party politicks, as far as our 
State Legislation is concerned. All of our party divisions 
have reference to the action of the General Government. 
This results from our peculiar political institutions, which 
from the admirable adjustment of the conflicting political 
elements of the State, prevents any one from gaining the 
ascendency and oppressing the other; and thus preserves har- 
mony, and produces that tendency to Union, which so strongly 
characterizes our State, and gives it that disproportioned 
weight in the Union, compared to its population and wealth. 

I cannot in the short space of a letter go into the peculiar 
organization that produces this result, but will when we meet 
go over the whole with you in conversation. But I see, as 
clearly as I do the sheet before me, that if we should change 
our constitution, so as to give the election of the Governor to 
the people, and increase his pay and patronage by conferring 
on him the appointing power, the action of our state Gov* 
will be entirely reversed. Instead of producing unanimity 
at home, as is now the case, two violent parties would 
spring up, which would nearly equally divide the State. 
The great point of contest would be the gubernatorial 
election. To carry the Governor would be deemed by 
both sides more important than to control the action 
of the General Government, or resist its abuses and usur- 
pations, and each party will be ready to seek federal aid 
and patronage, and to sell the State to purchase it. Instead 
of increasing our capacity to resist the General Government, 
as is intended, it would utterly destroy it. From the day that 
the change is made, we would become the mere appendage of 
that Government, and we should hear no more of the nullifi- 
cation or the treason of South Carolina. There would always 
be a powerful local minority in the State, ready to become the 
Union party, should the majority attempt any movement of 
the kind against the General Government, which minority 
would be sure to receive its countenance and patronage, and 



LETTEES OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 421 

through them become the majority, just as in the case of 
Georgia. There would be no need of a force bill to assert 
federal supremacy among us thereafter. Our own mercenary 
divisions and factions would be effectual for that purpose. 
These remarks do not half exhaust the subject. I might go on 
to show that an immediate conflict would spring up between 
the upper and lower country under the change; and that the 
power and influence of the latter would be prostrated, and 
that our state Government, from being a beautiful and well 
adjusted Republick, protecting the interest of all, and utter- 
ing the voice of the whole Community, would- become a wild 
factious and despotick Democracy under the control of the 
dominent interest; but, I trust, I have said enough to satisfy 
you, without going farther into the subject. I do hope the 
contemplated change will not be attempted. It would place 
me in a painful situation. Come from what quarter it may, I 
would feel myself compelled by the highest sense of duty both 
to the State and Union to oppose it, with all my might. I say 
Union; for I verily believe, that there is no State in all the 
Union that has strength enough within itself to nullify an act 
of Congress of a general nature, without having a peculiar 
local oppression, but this State and Mass* 8 , and if we make 
the change the only effectual barrier to federal usurpation in 
the South will give away which would be alike fatal to the 
Union and ourselves. This is a strong assertion, but it is 
nevertheless true. Make the change and I would no longer 
feel that I had a place to stand on in the great struggle, which 
I have so long maintained against the encroachments and op- 
pression of the General Gov*. 

I noticed an article not long since in the Carolinian, which 
I laid aside, but cannot lay my hand on at this time, in which 
you made some remarks touching the removal of the deposites, 
M r Clay's resolutions in relation to them and the President's 
protest on their passage, from which I infer *that you had 
fallen into one or two important errors in reference to that 
portion of our political history, which has given you an 
erroneous impression of the transactions of that period. I 
know of no period of equal length, that involved more im- 
portant constitutional questions, the discussion of which threw 
much light on the nature of our political system, but which 



422 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

unaccountably excited but little publick attention. I cannot 
go over the ground in the compass of a letter, but when we 
next meet, I hope you will remind me of these remarks, as 
I am desirous of explaining the history of that period to you. 

You would be of great service at Washington this winter 
to the cause, and I think, if you can go on without too much 
expense and inconvenience to yourself you ought. I would be 
much gratified to have you there and hope if you should come^ 
you will quarter within convenient distance of me. I do not 
think your difficulty of hearing makes any serious objection. 
The session will be a highly important one. The future will 
greatly depend on the movements of the session. We shall 
either gain all, or lose all for which we have contended in the 
next 3 years. 

I expect to leave about the 24 th , and be in Edgefield about 
the 27 th and to take the Charleston and Wilmington route. 



To Armixtead Burt. 1 

Washington 24 th Dec r 1838 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 received your three letters from Colum- 
bia, and am under obligation to you for keeping me so fully 
and correctly informed as to the true state of things in that 
quarter. 

My great solicitude at present is, to keep the State as united 
as possible. As one of the small States our importance in the 
Union must depend much on union among ourselves, and 
there are many reasons, which render such Union particularly 
important at this time. We have reached the period at which 
we must reap, or lose the fruits of our past efforts for the 
last 14 years. M r Clay's American system, which poured 
countless millions into the treasuiy, taken from one section 
and given to another, was the source of all our oppression, 
disorder, and corruption. That had to be overthrown before 
reformation could possibly take place. Nullification and the 
deposite act effected that. They have between them dried up 
the source of corruption, patronage and power, and put an 
end for the present both to Congressional and Executive 
usurpation. The Government is now poor, and will be much

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 423 

more so before '42, when the compromise act will take off all 
duties above 20 per cent ad. Val. 

The great point at present is, to bring down the expendi- 
tures to the revenue and keep them there; and to prevent the 
renewal of the Tariff or the creation of a new debt; to effect 
which will require the United efforts of our State and the 
South. The work must [be] begun this session of cutting 
down the expenditures, and of rall[y]ing the South to meet 
the crisis. I have already taken my position in debate. Our 
ultimate hope is to reduce the power and patronage of this 
government to keep it poor and hold it strictly to its dele- 
gated powers; and now is our time. Reduce its expenditures 
and income to its legitimate wants and seperate it from the 
monied institutions of the States, and all will be well. If this 
can be effected abolition itself will become manageable. 

It is generally believed here, even by his friends, that M r 
Clay's prospect is overshadowed. His position was bad; and 
as a man of sense, he ought to have seen that it was impossi- 
ble for him to take middle ground on the abolition question. 
The effect of his altered position is favourable to our policy. 
To save themselves he and his friends will be compelled to 
take high grounds on the abolition question, and other meas- 
ures favourable to the South, of which we already have evi- 
dence, and will no doubt have still stronger. 

As to the divorce, I have no doubt some of the leaders of 
the adm n party are inclined to give ground, but as far as I can 
yet judge the rank and file are sound. M r Cambreling has 
reported a bill, which has not yet been published, in refer- 
ence to it; but which I understand will not be satisfactory to 
many of the party. . . . 

To Armistead Burt. 1 

Washington 17 th Feb 1839 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been so much engaged and have had 
so little to communicate since I received 3^ our last after you 
returned home, that I have delayed the acknowledgement of 
it till this time; and now the time is so short, before I hope' 
to have the pleasure of meeting you, that you must excuse 
the brevity of my answer.

424 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The only political movement of any importance since I last 
wrote you was M r Clay's on the abolition question. He has 
chopped round on it. He had no choice. His own position 
and that of his Southern allies made it absolutely necessary to 
save both them and him. His speech is far from being sound 
on many points, but he has said enough to offend mortally the 
abolitionists, which will do much to divide the north and con- 
solidate us. 

You will see my remarks on the occasion both in the Globe 
and the Mercury. The Intelligencer has not thought proper 
to publish them although it, as well as all the Whig papers 
has been very willing to claim my endorsement. The truth 
is, that they were felt to cut deep, but policy prevailed over 
resentment. I take it, that all of Clay's Southern Allies will 
take the opportunity offered by his Speech to come out only 
for him; but, I think it doubtful, whether it will not rather 
weaken, than strengthen his chance. 

The prospect is, that nothing will be done at this session on 
the currency question, i do not think the administration 
leaders are sound; at least a portion of them, though 1 believe 
the rank and file are generally. 

There will, I think, be a great reduction in the appropria- 
tion a most material point at this time; and, from present 
prospects I would say, that a satisfactory readjustment of the 
Tariff will take place between this and '42. 

On the whole, I think, the prospect is good, and that pru- 
dence, energy and perseverance on our part will accomplish 
all for which we ever contended. We are all well; and expect 
to leave this on the 4 th March and to pass through Abbeville 
between the 11 th and 15 th when we hope to see you. In the 
meantime all join their love to you and Martha.

Fort Hill 28 th April 1839. 

MY DEAR SIR, A friend from Western Virginia writes that 
Judge Caldwell of the District Court is dead and that David 
McComas would be a highly acceptable successor if appointed.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 425 

I am acquainted with Mr. McComas and regard him as a 
man of talents and worth. His reputation is high in his pro- 
fession; and, if the President has no particular preference for 
any other individual, I would be gratified with his appoint- 
ment. His connections are numerous and respectable, and, 
as he has always belonged to the State rights party, and, I 
believe, supports the admisistration on the great question of 
the day, I should suppose that his appointment at this time 
would have a happy effect on the politicks of Virginia. 1 

I am rejoiced to perceive that the indications for the con- 
tinuance of peace are so favourable by the late arrivals, i 
had never doubted but that the British Government and peo- 
ple would be adverse to war with this country at present; but 
yet, I apprehend it will be almost impossible to settle the 
Maine question without a compromise. It is, however, fortu- 
nate that the character of the boundary in question is such, 
that one may be made mutually advantageous to both parties. 

I do hope that the questions growing out of the seizure of 
our slaves in the Bahama Islands may at the same time be 
adjusted. 2 Our right is beyond all question, and the principle 
involved is one that the slave-holding states can never yield. 
I had intended to bring up the question at the last session, 
but abstained on account of the Maine question. If nothing 
should be done, I shall feel myself compelled to call the atten- 
tion of the country to it at the next session. The adjustment 
of the two at the same time would be a great achievement that 
would ensure a durable peace between the two countries.

Fort Hill 30 th April 1839. 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have just received a letter from Anna, 
which says, that you may possibly be compelled to visit Phil- 
adelphia in order to attend to our note in bank, as the pres- 
sure on the money market has been so great, that you had 
found some difficulty in raising the funds necessary to meet

our note. I hope, that the news from England, with the rise 
of cotton and the prospect of peace, will have such effect on 
the money market, that all difficulty will have vanished. I 
write now to say, what 1 know you feel as sensibly as I do, 
that it is of the utmost importance, that the note should not be 
protested. My publick station, and the relation I bear to the 
banking question, much more than even my private credit, 
make it essential, that our engagement should be met; and I 
would rather submit to any sacrifice, than to fail to take up 
the note. I do hope, that, if you should find any difficulty in 
raise the funds from the sources you expected, that you will 
not hesitate to raise it, be the sacrifice what it may, within 
any reasonable scope; and I will divide it with you, or assume 
the whole, rather, than fail to raise the means. You, of 
course, in such an event would use every exertion to make it 
small as practicable. If there should be no accidents, I shall 
be in possession of ample means by the end of the year to 
meet any engagements that may be necessary to meet the note. 
In the meantime, I fear, it will not be in my power to make 
any advance, as I have found it difficult to obtain what is due 
to me in the west and our banks have, I see by the papers 
almost stopped discounting. 

I have had but little to do with banks and have always met 
my engagements to the day, and it is doubly important, that 
I should do so on this occasion. 

I trust, however, and believe, you will find no difficulty in 
raising the necessary funds; and I have written what I have 
only from my extreme solicitude. 

Andrew continues to write in fine sperits and is every way 
delighted with our purchase. 1 When he wrote his last his crop 
was planted to his entire satisfaction. He has purchased one 
of the small tracks (160 acres) that hemmed us in. He does 
not say at what price, but says, that he gives us the option to 
join in the purchase if we should think proper to do so. 

The season here is fine, and my crop has a good start. We 
are all well and all join their love to you. 

In my next to Anna, I will write in relation to the purchase 
of the negroes, on which you desire my opinion. We will 
expect you as early as you can make it convenient to come.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 427 

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill May 1839 

DEAR SIR, You have no friend, who more sincerely rejoices, 
that you have been able to surmount the dificulties you have 
had to encounter, or wishes } T OU better success in the final 
completion of your speculation. You have in my opinion 
concluded wisely, in determining- to sell for whatever you can 
realize. Besides the uncertainty of the times, as to money 
affairs, it requires much capital to hold on to such a specula- 
tion, for any considerable length of time. 

I am glad, that there is a prospect of reviving the Chron- 
icle, 2 especially under the auspices of Cralle. Few men write 
as well, or better understand the politicks of the country, to 
which he adds high integrity. An honest and intelligent 
organ at the seat of Government is always necessary to the 
support of correct principles, and may be said emphatically 
to be so at this juncture; and, yet, such is its peculiar char- 
acter, that one at this time, unless conducted with extreme 
discretion would do more harm, than good. 

I hold it as certain, that the Whig party is destined to be 
defeated, and that the defeat must be followed by a dissolu- 
tion. It is too heterogeneous to hold together under the 
shock of defeat. The great question is how its elements will 
resolve themselves; and what will be the character of the new 
combinations, that will be formed. That will depend much 
on the intermediate course of events, and especially on the 
course of our friends. If ours shall combine conciliation with 
an honest and firm adherence to principles and the general 
interests of the Union, a vast portion, especially the younger, 
will fall into our ranks. Such a course must command the 
respect of the honest and intelligent of all parties, while the 
Presidential conflict must engender and keep up the most 
bitter animosity between the Whigs and the dominant party, 
down to the hour of defeat. In the meantime, if our course 
shall be moderate, patriotick and firm, both sides will be 
compelled to approximate to our principles and policy, which 
will place us and our doctrines in the most commanding posi-

tion at the termination of the contest. It is the good fortune 
of our position, that the more disinterested and honest our 
course, the more politick and certain of success. 

As to the banks my course has long been fixed, and cannot 
be changed I believe that the system as it exists with us is 
radically and essentially wrong, and that it must end in its 
destruction, through its own inherent defects Self slaughter 
must be its fate. It can fall by no exterior cause. It is too 
strong to be resisted from without. One object has steadily 
guided me from the removal of the deposites till this time; and 
that is to pursue such a course, that the present system may 
come to an end, and a better one grow up gradually in its 
place, with as little shock as possible to the politicks and busi- 
ness of the country. If I had been sustained by the banking 
interest in 1834, when the deposites were removed, or in 1837, 
when specie payments were suspended, this desirable object 
would have been accomplished; but as it is, things must now 
take their own course, till another shock occurs, which must 
be followed by the speedy overthrow of the system. As 
things now stand, they are far worse, than before the late sus 
pension, and I want some fair opportunity to express myself 
fully on that point. For the present state I hold both parties 
Whig and administration responsible. It is hard to say which 
is most to blame. I would have given my views fully on 
Rives 1 resolutions had the debate continued, which I believe 
both parties were desirous to prevent; and hence the question 
was not again called up. 

I think, with you, the question is doubtful in Virginia, and 
looking to the future, it is hard to say, on which side we 
ought to desire the scales to turn. If the administration 
should carry the state by a decided vote, and that be followed 
by Victory in N. York, there is great danger, or rather there 
is almost a certainty, they would again become a spoil party, 
and would at the same time make war on us, and court the 
other, Whig, party, under the command of Webster; but on 
the other hand, if they should be defeated, in both states, the 
result might be the triumph of the Whigs, and with that, an 
equal ascendency of the spoil principle, united with consolida-

tion. A doubtful conflict is the most desirable, as far as our 
principles and doctrines are concerned. It would make our 
position a most commanding one. I cannot think, with you, 
that M r Rives would be strong in either event. His position 
is weak essentially. Nor do I think you are more correct as 
to M r Kendall. l His office gives him much patronage, but he 
has too many powerful aspirants in the party to convert it 
into an instrument of personal aggrandizement to any great 
extent, at present. Your admonitions in regard to him, 
though kindly intended, were wholly unecessary. I under- 
stand the object, at which I aim and the means of accomplish- 
ing it too well to be entangled by any one. Having no per- 
sonal wish, but what is strictly subordinate to my principles 
and duty, and having defined my course rigidly in reference 
to them, it is not in the power of man to divert me, of which, 
I think, I have given ample proof within the last two years. 
If the errors and misconceptions of M c Duffie, Hamilton, 
Hayne and others, who have so much of my confidence and so 
much influence in the state could not divert me, I think there 
can be but little fear, that any man, or any party hereafter 
can. I hold office of no value, but as the means of more 
enlarged usefulness, by carrying out correct principles more 
efficiently, and giving that ascendency due to intelligence, 
patriotism and virtue. But, still I am obliged always to my 
friends for their admonition and advice even on points, where 
I deem myself most securely guarded. 

I have written to you fully, having entire confidence in 
your long tried friendship. Should Cralle be in Washington, 
I would be glad you would show him this, as explanatory of 
my views, and say to him, that I would be glad to hear from 
him. Write me on the receipt of this, and before you set out 
for Europe. I would be glad to hear from you while there, 
as frequently as you can make it convenient to write. The 
mail before the last brought the gratifying intelligence of the 
safe delivery of Margaret, 2 of which, of course, you have been 
advised. 

We are all well and M rs Calhoun and Cornelia ]oin their 
love to you M rs Green and your family.

Fort Hill 27 th July 1839 

DEAR SIR, I have received yours' of the 29 th June and am 
gratified that the proceedings of the direct trade convention 
merits your approbation. I entirely concur with you, that 
Charleston possesses far greater advantages for the trade of 
all the central portion of the West, than N. York or any 
other place to the North of it, and that not only in winter, 
but summer also; but I am decidedly of the opinion, that the 
line of communication must be through the Tennesse River. 
Already a system of rail roads is filling up the space from 
Charleston to Rosse's landing on the Tennessee link by link. 
It is all finished, or under way with the exception of some 70 
miles or so, which is said to present no serious obstacle, 
When completed the distance between the two points will not 
exceed 400 miles by the rail route, with no rise, it is said, 
exceeding 35 feet to the mile. Between Augusta or Macon, 
the head of steam navigation on the Savannah and Ogmulgee 
Rivers, and Rosse's landing, the distance will not much exceed 
250 miles; and the intelligent Engineer at the head of the 
Athens and Augusta rail road (a part of the route) estimates, 
that a ton of goods can be transported from Philadelphia to 
Rosses landing, when the route is completed, for a less sum, 
than from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. With these facts, it 
is obvious, that nothing remains to place that route above all 
others, but the improvement of the Tennessee River, which 
is said to be a better Stream than the Ohio for Steam naviga- 
tion, with the exception of Colvert and the Muscle Shoals. 
In this great improvement, all the Central and the Western 
portions of your great Valley has the deepest interest. It 
would open to them the cheapest and safest route at all sea- 
sons, not only to the Atlantick portion of the Union, but also 
to the general Market of the world. To accomplish it noth- 
ing is wanting but the joint efforts of the parties interested, 
and there is no portion of the whole that has a greater inter- 
est, or that could with more propriety take the lead in the 
move than the State of Illinois. I have long had the com-

pletion of this great line of intercommunication much at 
heart, and have been surprised, when I reflected on the vast 
results depending on its completion, commercially, socially, 
and the immense and important portion of the Union inter- 
ested, that it has attracted so little attention. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Carters near Fort Hill 5 th Oct r 1839 

MY DEAR SIR, The death of Gen 1 . Hayne and Co 1 Blanding 
are really surprising events, under the circumstances under 
which they occurred; and are destined to effect a great change 
in the system with which they were so closely identified. 1 

I agree with you, that our course, and mine in particular, 
should be cautious and mute. 

My impression is decidedly, that the stockholders ought to 
place Co 1 Gadsden at the head of their affairs, which 1 under- 
stand are in a deplorable condition. I infer the road cannot 
reach Even Columbia, without the aid of the state to the 
amount of nearly a million. The true policy of the company 
it seems to me at this juncture is to stop all operations forth- 
with, beyond Columbia, and to reduce their operations even 
to that point, for the present, to the smallest scale. If this 
should be done, and I think necessity must enforce it, it seems 
to me clear, that for the present at least the two presidencies, 
that of the bank and road, ought to be united in the same 
individual. I feel confident a man of business, such as Co 1 
Gadsden, could easily perform both, and that their Union, 
would not only be a great saving, but would in the deranged 
state of the affairs of the company be the most effectual step 
to restore order and give a new energy to its action. He 
unites the requisite qualities for each; and is the only indi- 
vidual that I know that does. 

The election to fill Blanding's place will, I suppose, first 
come on ; it would be best to say nothing about that of Hay nes 
till after that is over. When that comes on, which, I suppose, 

i Robert Y. Hayne, president of the South Carolina Railroad, and Col. Abram Blanding, 
president of the Southwestern Railroad Bank, both died in September, 1839. See O'Neall, 
II, 18, 240-242. The two organizations were closely connected. 



432 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

will not [be] till the convention meets at Columbia, there will 
not I think be any difficulty to elect him to fill it. 

The main point is to get a full proxy from Abbeville and 
Edgefield to be placed in safe hands. The latter should be 
carefully guarded and you can do much to effect both. No 
one could represent the interests of the two Districts better 
than yourself. The only objection, I see, is your near con- 
nection with myself, but I do not know, that it ought to have 
much weight. 

Now is the time to put the affairs of the company right. 

We are all deeply distressed to hear of the low condition 
of Eliza. Her death would be a calamitous event to her 
family and husband. 

We are all well except Anna who is slightly only (I hope) 
indisposed and all join in their love to you and Maria. 

The weather is so dry, that I fear our journey to Alabama 
will have to be postponed longer than we desired. We 
intended to start by the 10 th . I will probably return through 
Abbeville, and, if I cannot pass by Millwood will endeavour 
to make arrangement to meet you as I pass through. 



To Duff Green,? 

Fort Hill 2 d Nov. 1839 

DEAR SIR, The last mail brought me your two letters; one 
from New York the other from Baltimore. 

I do hope you may succeed in making a successful arrange- 
ment of your Cumberland interest. I am exceedingly desir- 
ous to see you placed on solid ground, in these critical times, 
as to pecuniary affairs. But let me advise you, as a friend, 
not to think of the step, which you suggest. It would lead 
you back into all the turmoil of Washington politicks, with 
their vexation and uncertainty, of which you have had such 
abundant experience, and which you owe it to yourself, with 
your large family, to shun the repetition. As to myself, I 
have too little solicitude for anything the government, or 
people can bestow, to desire to see any friend expose himself 
to the hazard, which you would do in taking the step in ques-

tion. But a single desire remains to me; an honest and faith- 
ful discharge of dut}% so long as any portion of the publick 
authority is confided to me. . I look on political power, as a 
sacred trust, full of responsibility and burthensome in its dis- 
charge, and rather to be shunned, than sought at my time of 
life. 

I foresee great confusion and disorder, in the pecuniary 
affairs of the country, which the conflict among the banks 
themselves will greatly increase. To me, it is not unexpected. 
I have held for years, that the alternative, as to our banks 
was, reformation or revolution; and it is because, I desire the 
former, that I have taken the course I have. Nothing but a 
radical change, promptly commenced, and steadily, but grad- 
ually pressed, can save them from going down in convulsions; 
and nothing but the cooperation of the banks themselves, in 
effecting such a change, can make it moderate and gradual. 
Heretofore they have listened only to the clamorous political 
partisans, who looked to their own interests, and not to that 
of the country; and such, I apprehend, will be their course to 
the end of the chapter. 

Andrew and Margret left us for Alabama on the 20 th last 
month; and as the weather has been fine for travelling, I sup- 
pose have arrived some days since at the point of destination. 
I intended to accompany them to look at my interest in that 
quarter, but the weather remained too warm and dry till it 
was too late to make the visit in time to return and be at my 
post at Washington at the commencement of the session, when 
I hope to meet you.

self and family.

DEAR SIR, I cannot possibly be at Washington before the 
day proceeding the session. I propose to leave this on the 
23 d , taking the route by Charleston where I must spend 2 or 
3 days on business which will leave me barely time to reach 
Washington the time I stated.

Should you not have sailed for Europe, I would be happy 
to see you and converse freely on all points connected with 
the present difficulties; but it is due to candour to state, that 
my impression is against all of the schemes, which you state 
are in agitation, in reference to the state debts, both on the 
score of constitutionality and general expediency. 

No one forsaw the present embarrassment earlier than I 
did, or has been more anxious to avert it, than myself; nor is 
there any one more desirous of passing through it with the 
least possible derangement to the business of the country and 
existing monied relations of society, consistently with the con- 
stitution and sound measures of general policy. But as I hope 
to see you shortly, I do not deem it necessary to say more at 
present. 

M rs Calhoun and family join their kind regards to yourself 
and family.

Washington 7 th Dec r 1839 

MY DEAR ANDREW, On my arrival here, I received your 
letter of the 14 th Nov r , and am gratified that you are getting 
on so well, in getting in the crop of cotton and that it continues 
to turn out so well. So far from exagerating, your estimates 
have always been exceeded by the result. In fact, I think you 
carry your caution to an extreme; for I cannot but infer from 
all your letters, that our crop will equal, or exceed a bale to 
the acre, if you should be able to harvest in time. I have 
enquired from all the members from the South West, with 
whom I have conversed, and find our yield will be equal to 
any; even the best alluvia of the Mississippi. 

I hope the negroes arrived shortly after the date of your 
last, and that they have been sensibly felt in getting out our 
crop. 

There is not, I understand, the least chance of getting 
negroes here. They are fully as high here as with us; but, I 
think, will probably be lower the next season. M}^ impres- 
sion is that the fall of prices will be nearly universal. 

The Liverpool has just arrived. I understand that she

brings intelligence th,at commerce is improving, and that cot- 
ton is on the rise. Should it go up, it will, I think, be but 
temporary. You must watch and sell as soon as it rises; at 
least that is my impression. 

The House has not, and, I fear, will not shortly, decide the 
N. Jersey case. 1 

The political prospect I think good. I never was stronger; 
or stood on more solid ground. We have the control in the 
House, and shall use it fo v the good of the country. It is 
said, and I believe it, that the Message will be thoroughly 
state rights. If so, the remaining work to be done to restore 
the constitution will be easy. I now begin to feel confident, 
that our principles and doctrines are destined to gain a per- 
manent ascendency. 

My love to Margeret. Write often. 

[P. S.] Co 1 Pickens would certainly have been speaker had 
he been here earlier.

Washington 8 th Dec r 1839 

MY DEAR SIE, I enclose two letters received this morning 
under cover from Pendleton. 

The House has not yet organized and it is doubtful when it 
will. The control of the elections and the votes of the House 
is in the hands of the State rights party, and we intend to use 
it for the advance of our principles. Our position was never 
more powerful and, as far as I can judge, there is a very good 
feeling towards us on the part of the friends of the Adminis- 
tration. M r Pickens would certainly have been the Speaker 
had he arrived in time. Others had forestalled him, and Jones 
of Virginia will probably run as the Republican candidate. 2 

Harrison is nominated at Harrisburgh, as the Whig candi- 
date. It will, I think, throw off the Southern division of the 
party. 

The Message it is said will be thoroughly States rights; and 
if so, it will make the Session easy on our part. . . .

To Mrs. T. G. Clem,son. c. c. 

Washington 18 th Dec r 1839 

MY DEAR ANNA, I am gratified to learn, that you are all so 
content and pleased with Millwood; and regret, that I cannot 
add one to your happy circle, at least during the holydays. 
My life is quite a contrast to yours. I have much company, 
but very little society. I am left alone of the Southern men 
in the Mess. Mr Pickens, Mr Rhett and Mr Hunter left 
some time ago, under the plea of rooms in the third story; 
but, I believe, because they were not entirely satisfied with 
the fair, or rather as I inclined to think, because it was a 
temperance Mess, which, strange to tell, coming from Ten- 
nessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Maryland, drink neither 
Whiskey nor wine. It suits me in that respect very well, for 
I have little relish for either except claret, and in the winter 
but little for that. 

Speaking of Mr Hunter, what a strange run of luck he has 
had, if I may so express myself, in speaking of the incidents 
of political life. You know, that he was State rights and 
Subtreasury. Well, that well near overthrew him in his last 
election. He had been elected by the whigs at his first elec- 
tion. They became exasperated at his course, which was so far 
from conciliating his old opponents that they started a strong 
opposition to him, because he would not say, that he would 
support M r Van Bur en at the next election. His prospect 
was, of course, very gloomy for reelection; but, as the whigs 
were determined to oppose the Van Buren party, they gave 
M r Hunter a cold support, which with the support of personal 
friends elected him by a small majority. He returned here 
quite disheartened, and determined to retire from another 
canvass. But the tide turned, and he is now speaker of the 
House, which but a few days since no one dreamed of. I 
know, you will ask how all this occurred. I must go back a 
little to explain so strange a result. 

It was the wish of a large majority of the Democrats to 
make M r Pickens the Speaker; but, fortunately, or unfor- 
tunately, I am not certain which, he was not here in time. 
Mr Lewis, of Alabama, was pushed forward in the meane time, 
to the offence of some of Mr Pickens' friend; and, when the 
party met in caucus, he lost the nomination by one vote. Mr 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 437 

Jones of Virginia received it. This offended some of M r Lewis' 
friends. The two parties in the House, opposition and Re- 
publican, are nearly equal and when they came to vote for 
speaker a few scattering votes of those offended, prevented 
the election, of either of the regular candidates, Bell and Jones. 
It was soon found, that neither could succeed, and Lewis was 
taken up by the administration party; but this offended some 
of Jones' friends, which prevented his election. The oppo- 
sition, seeing they had no chance to elect a candidate of their 
own, finally ran on Hunter, as the least objectionable among 
their opponents, which enabled the State rights party to elect 
him by throwing their vote in his favour. 

Thus he has passed in a few days from a position weak and 
precarious to one of great strength and control, which, if he 
should turn its advantages to account, may make him promi- 
nent and influential. I have great confidence in his good sense 
and discretion, and, if he should act as well as I think he will, 
it will do much to advance our principles and doctrines. 

I had no idea, that the narative, 1 undertook, would have 
taken up so much of my sheet, or I would not have ventured 
on it. To compensate for its length, I must cut short my 
letter. 

I wrote to your mother some time since, and expressed my 
fear from Patricks letter, he would not be able to go through 
with his class, from the loss of time and the weakness of his 
eyes. I addressed a letter to the superintendent on the sub- 
ject and desired his candid opinion in relation to it. His 
answer is very satisfactory. He thinks there is no fear and 
represents his standing as very satisfactory. 

Say to M r Clemson, that I got his letter to day, and will 
write him shortly. I wrote him since my arrival here. 

My health is good, with the exception, as usual, of a cold, 
which has been very common here. 

My love to all.

backed it as well as he could, but it is thought both he and his 
Southern friends take it badly at heart. It will tend, like al- 
most all other causes now in active operation, to impel our 
Government in the direction of state rights, and to give an 
ascendency to our principles and doctrines. In fact, with 
prudence and firmness, we have a decided control over coming 
events. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Washington 17 th Jan y 1840 

DEAR SIR, When I took mv seat in the Senate this morn- 
ing, I found on my table your letter of this instant, the con- 
tents of which not a little surprised me. 

Before I proceed to comply with your request, I must pre- 
mise, that there is much in the tone and substance of your 
letter, which coming from almost any one else, would have 
been construed into menace; and would, of course, have 
imposed silence on me; but coming from you, feelings 
belonging to our past and present relations outweigh any con- 
siderations of the kind. 

Your request is for me to state, the considerations, which 
induced me to advise my friends to vote against you as printer 
to the House. 2 In reply, 1 state, that I had very little conver- 
sation with my friends in relation to it. I came to the city, 
under the impression, that our principles and the policy on 
which we acted, would compel us to act with the administra- 
tion, if they should adhere to the course, which they have 
taken, and that our proper course would be, to let them elect 
their own officers, including the printer to the House, in 
order, that we might with greater propriety and effect insist 
on that course of measures, which we believed to be essential 
to the interests of the country. I expressed these views 
freely to my friends and applied them generally, both to you 
and others. But I stated to none so fully and strongly, as I 
did to yourself, the reasons, why I could not support you for

by Fisher, of North Carolina, may be followed in Niles's Register, LVII, especially pp. 
348, 349. Blair and Rives were elected January 30. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 439 

the printing, in a conversation shortly after the commence- 
ment of the session, when you informed me, that the Whigs, 
finding that they could not elect Gales and Sea ton, would sup- 
port you, and that you could be elected, if my friends would 
vote for you. I had supposed, from what afterwards occurred, 
that you had acquiesced in my views, till I was informed by 
M r Fisher, that one of the members had made you a large 
offer in behalf of Gales and Seaton, for the use of your name. 
I refused to have anything to do with the subject, expressing 
at the same time my objections to the proposal in strong 
terms, but without intending, what I said to go farther. 

Having given you the statement you request, let me now 
say, on my part, I am at a loss to know on what authority you 
speak, when you talk of my participating in a heartless con- 
spiracy against your reputation, and of M r Pickens acting 
under my advice, or to imagine how you could suppose, that 
there could be the least reluctance on my part, in any possible 
case, to do you justice. Why should 1 or any friend I have 
conspire against you ? Or why should I in any case, hesitate 
to do you full justice. Every feeling of my bosom and every 
consideration that could act on me forbid the supposition, 
that either is possible. 

Nor are you less mistaken in supposing, that M r Pickens 
acted under my control or for me, or that 1 advised him to do 
any act intended to do you the smallest harm. During the 
whole time, that this painful affair was in agitation, 1 never 
spoke to one of my friends in relation to it, nor one of them 
to me, but Co 1 Pickens, and that on a single point. He called 
to consult with me, whether it would be proper for him to 
repel the charge of the Madisonian, as far as he and others 
who acted with him might be concerned. I said to him, I did 
not see how it could well be avoided, suggesting at the same 
time that it would be preferable to do it in his place as a mem- 
ber of the House. As to what he said it is his own. Nothing 
passed between us as to that; nor was there the indication of 
any unkind feelings towards you. Now I would submit it 
to your own judgement, whether a denial could have been 
avoided with justice to himself and others. It is obvious, 
that the article in the Madisonian was intended to bear on 
Co 1 Pickens with others. It was charged, if not expressly, at 



440 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

least by inference, that there was an understanding between 
Blair and Rives and you, as to the printing, and that you had 
received a large sum already, as a consideration for those gen- 
tlemen to vote for them, as printers. It was believed they 
intended to vote for them. Now I ask you, whether under 
this state of things they could remain silent? If they had 
and should hereafter vote, as it is said they intend, would 
not suspicion have attached to their motives ? It is true the 
Globe had denied, that there was any understanding; but their 
silence would have outweighed its denial, in the opinion of 
many. 

1 also submit, whether, if Co 1 Pickens used expressions too 
strong, in disclaiming any connection with you, as a candidate 
for the printing, it may not be more rationally attributed to 
the circumstances of the case, than any disposition to wound 
your feelings? I am satisfied that such is the true explana- 
tion, if in what he said, viewed simply in reference to your- 
self, he went too far. Nor am I less satisfied that you have 
done him great injustice in supposing that he had the least to 
do with the publication in the Globe. 1 say this without any 
knowledge, how the facts stated in the Globe came to the 
knowledge of its editors. I know nothing at all about it. 

I have been compelled to notice the portions of your letter 
to which these remarks apply, as silence on my part might be 
misconstrued. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Private 18 th Jan y . 1840. 

DEAR SIR, You will see by the date of your letter that it 
was commenced yesterday. The discussion and long sitting 
of the Senate, with company in the evening, prevented me 
from finishing and mailing it till to day. 

It may be proper to say, that it was written without seeing 
any friend, or any one knowing, that I had received the letter 
to which it is a reply. 

Were I not apprehensive, that you would misconstrue my 
motives, I would say to you, that you would make a great mis- 
take to attack personally any one in your vindication. As far 

i

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 441 

as I can judge, there is no unkind feelings towards you, and 
that which has been said has been defensively, but probably 
without reflecting on its bearings on you. Men are but too 
apt to overlook the feelings of others, in such cases, as your 
letter proves. An attack would be but to convert friends into 
enemies. It seems to me, if you come out, as I suppose you 
will, after what you have said feel yourself in some degree 
compelled to do, your better course would be to state in mod- 
erate language, the circumstances, which induced you to view 
the proposal as you did. 

You must not think that in making these suggestions, I 
intend to deprecate a personal attack on myself. Although, 
coming from you, it would be exceedingly painful, as much 
so as anything that has ever occured to me, yet I feel strong 
in conscious rectitude; that I never did in my life an unfriendly 
act towards you, or ever entertained a wish but for your wel- 
fare. I trust you will receive this in the sperit in which it 
[is] written. 

To Thoma* G. Clemson,. c. c. 

Washington 25 th Jan y 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, I do not feel myself sufficiently possessed of 
all the facts and circumstances to offer an opinion at present 
on the question, in relation to which, you desire my opinion 
in your last. As far as the consulate at Havannah may bear 
on your dicision, it is proper to remark, that I regard the 
contingency as a remote one. I am of the impression that 
M r Trist * will not be removed unless the case against him is 
irresistably strong; and that if it should be such as cannot be 
got over, no step will be taken for some time; probably not 
during the present year, for reasons which will probably occur 
to you. 

1 do not think, then, as far as that is concerned, you need 
hasten the decision of the question of a permanent arrange- 
ment. The immediate necessity being out of the way, it 
strikes me, that it would be better on both sides, that your

arrangement should for the present be temporary. It would 
give time to both to reflect, and to come to the conclusion, 
after a year's experience, that would probably be more satis- 
factory to both. I have no doubt you could be mutually use- 
ful to each other, and could contribute much to the happiness 
of each other, as well as to that of Anna and Maria. But the 
greater the prospect of mutual benefit, the greater the neces- 
sity, that your permanent arrangement should be entered 
into, if at all, after due reflection and with all the lights, which 
the experience of a temporary arrangement might afford. 

The subtreasury passed the Senate, as you will have seen, 
by a strong vote. There was but little debate. Some of the 
Senators apprehended instructions and were desirous of has- 
tening the passage, and there was but little disposition to dis- 
cuss on the side of the opposition. I had prepared to take 
part in the discussion had it gone on, but was unwilling to 
delay the passage. I wished to present one or two important 
views, not yet touched on. The fate of the bill in the House 
is not certain. In fact it is difficult to say what can or cannot 
pass there, so equal is the division of parties, and so com- 
pletely is the body disorganized. In the Senate the condition 
of things is better. I never saw it in sounder, state, as far as 
I can yet judge. 

Say to Anna and the Co 1 that I have received their letters 
and will answer them shortly. 

I enclose you a pamphlet I received last evening from M r 
Binney, as I know you take an interest in all that concerns 
Philadelphia. It is exceedingly well written; and does him 
much credit. 

My love to all. 



To Jam.es II. Hammond. 1 

Washington 25 th Jan y 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, You must not suppose, in taking the course 
I have, that I am governed by confidence in the men or party 
with which we are acting. There is, indeed, but little room 
for confidence at such a period as this, when a corrupt and mer-

cenary sperit, spreading far and wide has left few untouched. 
My reliance is on the power, which circumstances has placed 
in our control, and to maintain it, the most potent means is to 
keep the Government poor. An exhausted treasury is the 
most effective remedy for the deep seated disease, which has 
so long afflicted the body politick; and to it we owe whatever 
symptoms there are of returning health. With a full treas- 
ury, the Democratick party ever will become, as it lately was, 
a spoil part}^; but empty the treasury, and withhold the means 
of rewarding partisan services, and you force them to return 
to principles. It is that, or defeat, as the banks and the 
wealth of the country at the North are on the side of their 
opponents. The treasury is now empty, and, if we can keep 
it so, reformation is certain. 

Very different is the case with the opposite party. They 
are and ever have been incorrigibly wrong from the begin- 
ning. Individually it is highly respectable for the most part; 
but as a party, we can hope for nothing from it, unless indeed 
a long continued exclusion from power, should reform it. As 
yet, it has had but little influence that way. 

As to myself, I look exclusively to the end I have in view; 
the thorough reform of the Government, and the restoration 
of the Constitution to its original purity and every move I 
'take has reference to it. To that great task, I stand pledged, 
and nothing can deflect me an inch from my course. If it is 
ever to be accomplished, now is the time. If not now done, 
it never will be. Powerful causes are now in operation tend- 
ing to give a wrong direction, and among the strongest is the 
deep indebtedness of many of the States; but on the other 
hand there are powerful means of resistance. Much will 
depend on the result of the approaching election, which gives 
the only interest I feel in it. 

The subtreasury passed by a large majority after a feeble 
resistance. I regret that the debate did not continue, as I 
was prepared to speak and to enter on grounds on which I 
have not heretofore touched; but the impatience of some of 
the Senators to vote before they might be instructed to vote 
against their inclination and the little disposition of the oppo- 
sition to discuss the bill, induced me to decline speaking. 

I shall at all times be glad to hear from you.

To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 1 st Feb: 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, ... As to the State of things here, 
politically, it is about as good, as could be expected. The 
House has refused to receive abolition petitions; the strongest 
measure yet taken and which must be productive of good 
consequences. Every Whig out of the Slave states, but one, 
voted against, and four in the Slave states and a sufficient 
number of Republicans out of them, voted for it to make a 
majority. We are not troubled with their petitions in the 
Senate, but if we should be, I doubt not, the same vote can be 
had there. As to the general tone of feeling on the part of 
the supporters of the administration, I think it good. They 
seem to me to be much inclined to support our doctrines and 
measures. In fact, they act under a sort of necessity, as it is 
by them only they can stand. 

A change, you will have seen by the papers has .taken place 
in the personal relations between the President and myself. 
I had all along seen it would be necessary, if measures went 
in the direction I desired. My position towards him placed 
me in a situation to be a subject of jealousy among his friends, 
and speculation among that of his adversaries, which tended 
greatly to weaken me in my efforts to carry out my views. 
The portion of his friends, favourable to me, had expressed 
great anxiety, that our relations should be changed and one of 
them (M r Roane of Virginia) informed me, that it was much 
desired at Richmond among the leading friends of the admin- 
istration there. He also said, that M r Van Buren had said to 
him, that it was his determination, if we ever met, to make 
the first advance. We came in the same car from Richmond, 
and he wished me to leave my card, when I arrived. I 
declined and said to him, that I had always intended to restore 
our personal relations, if he persisted in the course he had 
taken, but that I must be the judge of the time and mode, but 
when it came, I should be happy to have him, as the medium. 
I had determined to -wait the developement of the message, 
and, if satisfactory, to carry my intention into effect, by 
making my personal, conform to my political relations. Find- 
ing it, as far as it went, satisfactory, 1, accordingly, in con- 



LETTERS OF JOHN O. CALHOUN. 445 

formity to previous arrangement called; and all that passed 
between us in regard to the subject was simply that, "I said 
to him that by his course as chief Magistrate he had removed 
the difference in our political relations and that I called to 
remove that in our personal." In doing so, I still regarded 
both him and myself, in our official character, and simply 
intended to remove the awkwardness of defending the political 
measures and course of one, with whom I was not on speak- 
ing terms, and the weakening effects resulting from such a 
state. Thus acting I, of course, required no preliminary per- 
sonal explanation, as the act overlooked and turned on differ- 
ent considerations. I, in fact, have changed no opinion, as 
to his course towards me, out of which our former personal 
alienation grew; nor can I; but, I did not think it of sufficient 
magnitude to influence my course, where the publick has so 
much at stake. The present is pregnant with a long train of 
important events. The election is narrowed down to M r Van 
Buren and Gen 1 Harrison. If the latter prevails, a national 
Bank and Tariff certainly follow, with all the train of disas- 
ters, redoubled, from which we are just escaping; but if the 
former, the prospect is fair to carry out successfully the great 
object for which I have so long contended, the thorough 
reform of the Government and the complete restoration of 
the constitution. Keep this, and read it two years hence, 
when you will fully appreciate the wisdom and patriotism of 
my course. I give it, that you may have wherewith to judge 
of me, in the difficult and complicated scenes through which I 
have to pass. 
My love to all.

MY DEAR SIR, Since I wrote to you last, I have received

attention.

form on the subject. 1 It has been exceedingly well received

here by the administration party, which I regard as a most 
favourable symptom. The whole democratick party of N. 
York and New England, as far as I can learn will decidedly 
maintain the doctrines. What a change, and what powerful 
evidence of the force of truth, if boldly and intelligently main- 
tained! It is thought to be the most popular speech I ever 
delivered, and will receive a very wide circulation. 

I make a short letter, as I write Anna by the same mail that

To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 13 th Feb. 1840 

So far from being offended, my dear daughter, the senti- 
ments you have expressed but elevates you, if possible, in my 
estimation. With the limited view you had of the reasons, 
which governed me, they are natural to one, who is so sensi- 
tive where my character and standing are concerned. With 
a full knowledge of all the complicated circumstances under 
which I acted, you would take a very different view. The 
course I ought to take involved not only a question of self 
respect, but publick duty, and, of course, placed my private 
relation in a great degree under my publick, or political re- 
lations. Regarded in connection, you will see, that if the 
course of the administration, should coincide with my political 
principles and doctrines, there must of course be a point of 
time, when I could not consistently, either with duty or pro- 
priety, refuse to restore my personal relation. To do so, 
would weaken me and in a great measure destroy that control 
over events, which I had obtained by a firm adherence to 
principle and fearless discharge of duty, while it would de- 
tract from that elevated standing I had acquired personally, 
by refusing to restore our private relations, at first, while 
M r Van Buren's course was uncertain, and my motive might 
be suspected, by making the impression, that personal pique, 
or mere fastidiousness controlled me. 

If this view be true, the only questions were, as to the time 
and mode, admitting his course to be as it has been in the 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 447 

main, satisfactory. There could be but little doubt as to the 
time. It must be done, if at all, before the election is over. 
If delayed till after he was reelected, it would have lost all 
dignity on my part and exposed me to very improper impu- 
tations. But if done before, it must be at some period during 
this session, and none could be so suitable, as after the Mes- 
sage, supposing it to be satisfactory, as it proved in the main 
to be. 

Nor could there be much doubt as to the mode. It was not 
a mere private act. On the contrary it was much more gov- 
erned by publick, than private considerations. To have it 
forced by personal explanations would not have been in keep- 
ing, nor could it possibly be, for I cannot change my opinion 
as to the cause, which effected our seperation. The restora- 
tion of our personal relation was independent of that, and 
turned on considerations above it. It was much more with 
the President, than M r Van Buren. My private relation fol- 
lowed and was governed by my political and publick. M r V. 
B. as Chief Magistrate had restored the latter, it remained for 
me (it was my act not his) to restore the former. 

Thus regarding it, I did not hesitate to call with a mutual 
friend, who had expressed much desire to see our relations 
restored, having previously fixed on an hour. The only thing 
that passed relating to the object of the call was, I said, M r 
President, by your course as Chief Magistrate you have 
removed the difference in our political relations; I have called 
to remove that in our personal. 

My political position remains of course just where it was; 
ready to sustain the administration, when right and oppose 
them when wrong, and on all occasions to express my opin- 
ions freely. In fact, I am more fully at liberty, because I can 
go farther in consequence of a change of personal relations, 
in expressing my sentiments, without causing suspicion and 
jealousy with those with whom I am acting, or becoming the 
subject of speculation on the other side. 

I transmit by the mail that takes this, a copy of my speech 
on the assumption of state debts, for yourself and M r Clem- 
son. I enclosed one for your Uncle James in a letter to him 
of this date.

It has been exceedingly well received, by the Northern

Washington 14 th Feb 1840 

MY DEAR ANDREW, ... I send you in pamphlet form my 
speech on the assumption of the State debts. You will see 
what bold grounds I took, and will be surprised, when I tell 
you, that it has been received, as far as I have heard, well by 
the whole administration party, including the North. Many 
think it my best effort. It has not been yet replied to, though 
I expect to be fiercely assailed by Clay and Webster, whose 
systems so it decidedly assails. The tone of the administration 
party is, I think, generally good, as may be inferred by the 
vote on the abolition question or the course of M r Tappan in 
the Senate; 1 but I have great apprehension from the indebted- 
ness of the States. It will prove a sore disease in the body 
politick; and disturb the general course of our politicks for 
years, if it does not in the end permanently impair the con- 
stitution. But for that, I would look forward to a permanent 
reform with certainty, but it casts doubts on the future. . . . 



To Jwnies IL Hammond. 2 

Washington 23 d Feb: 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, If you had been here the whole period 
since you left us, instead of being absent and abroad, you 
could not have taken a more correct view than you have of 
our true position. Without approving the course of either 
side entirely, we had no alternative, but to act with the party 
in power, simply because their measures, since the suspension,

and still more their principles, accord more nearly with our- 
own, than the opposite side. By acting with them, we have 
some prospect, to say the least, to arrive at the end, we pro- 
pose, while the opposite course could not fail in terminating 
in all we have a right to dread, as fatal to us and our institu- 
tions. I do not act on confidence. I look to the position of 
parties and their leaders, and the grounds on which they are 
compelled to place their hope of success; and from these I 
determine my course in reference to my end. I well know 
that with the leaders the ultimatum is the Presidential elec- 
tion. To that they attempt to bend everything; but they are 
compelled to conform more or less to circumstances; to the 
doctrines of the party, and those, who for the time may be 
acting with them and the honest and sincere of their own 
party who constitute the great mass of their followers. With 
a full knowledge of all the elements, which must control their 
movements, my means of control is to march directly for- 
ward, fearless of consequences, and to seize every question 
presented, from whatever side, to develope our doctrines and 
views with the intention of forcing them on those, with whom 
I act, by controlling publick sentiment. I took, for instance, 
the opportunity afforded by M r Grundy's report to go pretty 
fully into the protective system (I sent you a copy of my 
speech) 1 in advance of the revision of the tariff, which must 
take place at the next session; and when I tell you, that my 
views have been well received by the whole body of the party 
at the North, as far as I have heard, you will, I think, agree 
with me, that it indicates a great and salutary change of opin- 
ion in that quarter. 

Whether we shall ultimately be able to effect a reform may 
in> doubted; but it seems to me, that our strength depends 
much more on the goodness of our cause, and the correctness 
of our course, and less from our accidental position at this 
time, than you suppose. Should the election terminate in the 
decided triumph of the administration, I doubt much, whether 
it would weaken us. If they be sincere, it would only enable 
them to carry out more effectively the measures they profess, 
and for which we contend; but, if not, and they should

endeavour to govern on the spoil principles, the great body of 
the Whigs would be compelled to rally on us, with no small 
division of the administration party. In either event, if true 
to our principles, we would be strong. Nor would the success 
of the Whigs in the election weaken us. In that case, the 
whole body of the administration party, with the discontented, 
portion of the Whigs (it would be a large part) would join our 
Standard. But enough of these general speculations. I come 
nearer home. I see with regret, that we are to have a good 
deal of division and distraction in our own State; but I do 
hope, that it will be conducted on both sides, or rather all 
sides, in the tone and character becoming Carolineans. As to 
myself, so little had I interfered with the local politicks of the 
State (for reasons which I am sure you will readily under- 
stand and appreciate) that I did not know, the question who 
should be the next Governor had been agitated, or that either 
you or M r Richardson desired the place, or were thought of 
by your friends, till I saw his name announced. I would have 
been well plesed with either of you. He had acted well, as a 
member of Congress, and did much service to the cause, by 
cooperating with us on all leading questions. As to yourself, 
the occasion, I trust, will justify the declaration, that there is 
no one in the State, that 1 would have preferred to you, or on 
whose friendship, I place a higher value. With these views 
and feelings, the only position I can take is one of strict neu- 
trality. I have authorized all my friends here to say so, and, 
I do trust, my name will not be drawn into the canvass. I 
regarded with decided disapprobation the article in the Mer- 
cury, which drew in my name gratuitously, and I desired a 
friend of the editor to say so to him. I hope it will not be 
repeated. I trust, you will place a just estimate on my mo- 
tives in taking the course I have prescribed to myself on the 
occasion. My strength here depends on the union at home, 
as far as I am concerned, and my usefulness, while I remain, 
depends on my strength. My health is remarkably good 
never better. The fever went off without leaving any bad 
effect. I have, if anything, been better since than tefore. 

I shall, at all times, be happy to hear from you, and to have 
your suggestions on any point.

To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 24 th March 1840 

Mr DEAR ANNA, Since I received your's of the 1 st March, 
I have been so constantly engaged that 1 have not had leisure 
to answer it till now. Among my other engagements, I have 
had a subject on hand of not a little interest to the South; I 
mean the case of the Enterprise, one of the three Brigs, which 
have been so long in negotiation between our Government and 
that of Great Britain. She was forced into Port Hamilton, 
Bermuda, by stress of weather, where the negroes on board 
were forcible seized and detained by the local authority, for 
which the British Government has refused compensation. It 
took me some time to give the case a thorough examination, 
and then to present it fairly and finally to prepare for the 
press. It will be out on Tuesday next in the Globe. 1 

I presented the principles of the case in a series of resolu- 
tions. The discussion came up unexpectedly, with a thin 
House and nearly empty Gallery, and 1 had hardly got under 
way, before there was a cry of fire in the Capitol. I stopt a 
few minutes, till the confusion was over. The Galleries were 
soon crowded, and the Chamber filled. My friends think, that 
the speech made a strong impression. 

I did not expect to say so much of myself, when I com- 
menced assigning a reason, why I had been so tardy in 
acknowledging your letter, but as it is said, it may go, though 
you may think, that it has some what the air of Egotism. . . . 



To Jaines II. Hammond? 

Washington 2 d April 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, I enclose a copy of my speech on my reso- 
lutions. 3 You will see, that there is involved a principle of 
deep importance to us. I hope that the Committee on For- 
eign relations will report favorably, and that the resolutions 
will receive the unanimous support of the Senate.

I do not think that the influence of our party depends so 
exclusively on the equilibrium of the other two parties as 
you seem to do. There is a real and reliable accession in the 
ranks of the administration to our principles and doctrines, 
which is still on the increase, and will continue to increase 
so long as the Treasury is low. With a full treasury the 
worst portion of the party is sure to gain the ascendency, 
and to convert the party into the Spoil party, while the 
reverse almost necessarily follows from an empty treasury. 
Should the Tariff be satisfactorily adjusted, of which there is 
a fair prospect, the reformation of the party in power will 
follow almost as a matter of course. 

Our true rule is to enter into an alliance with no party, 
but to act with any for the time moving in the same direction, 
without deflecting in the least from our principles, or doc- 
trines. Such has been my rule, and, it seems to me, to 
be the only one consistent with sound policy and political 
integrity. 

I am much gratified to learn, that the course I have pre- 
scribed to myself, in the pending canvass, meets with your 
approbation. With my views and feelings, I could pursue 
no other. 1 

You must permit me to say, in candour and friendship, that 
my views of parties, as it relates to our State does not accord 
with yours. I think our natural political condition is the 
absence of local parties, and that past experience for the last 
thirty years shows it. It results from a fortunate political 
organization of the State Government, and is the real cause 
of our great relative ascendancy and influence in the Union. 
Our divisions all refer to the action of the Federal Govern- 
ment; and it is because there is no powerful local party in the 
State, through which to act, and by which the State might be 
controlled, that we are enable[d] to interpose and nullify an 
unconstitutional act of Congress, which no other state can do, 
except on some local question. 

It belongs to the nature of our party divisions to die away, 
when the questions which caused them cease; and it is fortu- 
nate that it is so. Otherwise, we would be in a state of per- 

i A course of neutrality. See Hammond's letters, the letters of February 23, supra, and 
of February 9, April 29, post. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 453 

petual distraction and weakness. That our late divisions have 
substantially subsided, I do not doubt. Nor do I doubt, that 
there is a real and sincere Union in the State in reference to 
the course, that ought to be pursued by the general govern- 
ment at this time; and that what division there may be in the 
State is more in the ranks of the old nullification party, than 
the old Union, owing to the unfortunate course of Col Pres- 
ton, Gen 1 Thompson and some other prominent members of 
the former. I think it important to preserve that Union, 
especially at this moment, when we are carrying out the fruits 
of our noble achievement in thirty two-three; and thus think- 
ing, I should regret the restoration of the party lines of that 
day. It would weaken us greatly both here and at home. I 
do think harmony as to the measures of the day, of pressing 
importance at this time, is the one thing needful, however 
much we may divide as to men at home. 

That there are individuals belonging to the old Union party, 
who would use power if put into their hands, as you suggest, 
I do not doubt; but I must say, I have seen nothing in the 
course of Col Richardson, that would induce me to think that 
he would do s,o. While here, he acted deci'dedly with us, and 
exerted all his influence, as far as I could see, to give that 
direction to events, which we desired. 

With these impressions, and regarding } T OU both as friends, 
I do hope, that the canvass ma3 r be free from personalities as 
possible. Let it be, if possible, a generous competition for 
the honor of serving the state in the highest office, a state 
worth} 7 of the devotion of her sons. My time must soon be 
through, and there is nothing 1 would regret more, than to 
see you and others on whom the hope of the state must rest, 
waste your talents and usefulness in party struggles at home 
instead of uniting to maintain the ascendancy of our principles 
and doctrines in the Union, and with them our influence and 
glory. That one of the small states of the confederacy should 
rank with the largest and proudest in weight and renown is 
an object worthy of ambition. I am sure you will not think, 
that I intend in the remotest manner to express any disappro- 
bation as it relates to 3 T ourself and friends in reference to the 
existing canvass. I regret, that there should be any conflict;

and think it has been badly managed to permit it all; but how 
it has happened, or who is to blame, or whether any one, I 
have formed, and intend to form no opinion. 

There is a good deal of apprehension of war here, growing 
out of the Maine question; but I cannot bring myself to believe 
that there is any serious danger. Both countries need peace, 
and both I believe desire it, and when that is the case it is 
hard to make war. 

We have the Cumberland road bill up in the Senate. 1 There 
is a fair prospect of its receiving a death blow; and with it 
the remnant of the American system. The passage of the 
Subtreasury is considered certain. 

The Presidential question is causing deep excitement in most 
of the states. Both parties are sanguine, but I think the 
Whigs as usual will be disappointed. 



To Mrs. T. G. Cleinson. 

Washington 29 th April 1840 

MY DEAR ANNA, '. . . The Presidential race is going to be a 
close one. Preston, Thompson, and Dawson have come out 
boldly, after all their denials, on the side of the bank tariff, abo- 
lition [illegible] and consolidation party. They can no longer 
dodge. In the midist of the confusion 1 hope that the cause of 
sound principles and truth and justice will prevail. My only 
hope is through the weakness and poverty of the Government. 
The weaker it is and the lower its revenue the better for us. 
There is a fair prospect, that it will be reduced low enough. 
If such should be the case, let events turn as they may, the 
prospect will not be bad for us. Should the party in power 
keep their place we would be able to control events, and if 
their opponents (consisting of every hue and colour) come in, 
their expulsion from power will not be difficult, when a radical 
reform would follow. . . .

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 455 

To James II. Hammond. 1 

Washington 16 th May 18^0 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read your two last letters with much 
interest. 2 They show much reflection and deep devotion to 
the great cause, which has shed glory on the name of Caro- 
lina, and which is destined to save the country, if, indeed, it 
should be its destiny to be saved. Time and reflection have 
but strengthened my devotion to the cause, to advance which, 
and at the same time to raise the name of our State, to defend 
the South and preserve our free institutions, are the sole mo 
tives, I have to remain a day in publick life. 

While I accord in most of your views and sentiments, you 
must permit me to say, that there are considerations, which, 
it seems to me, you leave out of the estimate, in coming to the 
conclusion, that the old party lines, which divided the State 
in the great contest of 1832 should be drawn and maintained in 
the approaching Gubernatorial election. I doubt the prac- 
ticability, and, if practicable, the expediency. Other ques- 
tions have risen of deep importance in reference to which both 
of the old parties have divided. Among these, the great 
question in reference to the currency, which in fact will be 
found at the very bottom of almost all the questions, which' 
have divided parties under our government from the begining 
to the present day. I do not hesitate to say, if Gen 1 . Hamilton 
had not issued his circular directing bank notes to be received 
as gold and silver in the publick dues, and if the bank of the 
United States had not been created, the whole course of poli- 
ticks under our system would have been entirely different. 
At the extra session, when the question of seperation was first 
agitated, I was desirous that it should make no serious divi- 
sion in our ranks, though I saw from the great depth of the 
question, that it would be difficult to prevent it. In spite of 
the most forbearing course on my part, every state rights 
man in Congress, who differed from me, became alienated and 
formed opposing political relations, which, in progress, has 
united them with all, the most opposed to our principles, policy 
and interests. The same took place in the ranks of the Union

456 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

party; and the alienation -has become so complete, that friend- 
ship has been turned into the bitterest hatred, and enmities into 
friendship. Look around in our own and the neighboring- 
States, and you will see the truth of what I have stated fully 
established. If to this we add, what was impossible to pre- 
vent, that both sides have rallied in the pending presidential 
contest with the party with which their course on the currency 
question naturally threw them, and that that contest has for 
the present absorbed nearly all other questions, you will, I 
think, agree with me, that it would be difficult to rally either 
side at present on the ground that divided them in '32. 

Nor can I think, it would be advisable, if itiwere practica- 
ble. The effect would be to isolate the State, and make her 
neutral in the present struggle; and the result, to throw [on 
us] the responsibility of bringing the Whigs into power, 
should they be victorious, to be followed by indifference to- 
wards us on their part, and deep indignation on the part of 
the defeated party; with the indifference of both, should the 
Whigs be defeated. We would in a word lose our weight, 
and be regarded as mere impracticables, governed by abstract 
notions, without regard to consequences. This might, indeed, 
be of but little importance, if there were not questions pend- 
ing of the greatest possible magnitude, in which our fate and 
that of the whole South is involved, and which cannot be con- 
troled by our seperate action, like the Tariff. Such, among 
others, are the abolition and the currency questions. We 
have met and can meet again the Tariff single-handed; but 
not so either of these; and, I must say, as far as I can judge, 
we have less to fear, at present, from the Tariff, than either 
of the others, though it is not free from danger. Union 
among ourselves is desirable in reference to all; tind it seems 
to me, that the true point of policy, at this time, is so to act, 
as to keep, as far as may be practicable the State United on 
these and all other interesting questions likely to spring out 
of our federal relations, at this deeply important juncture, with- 
out weakening ourselves elsewhere; and that a liberal course of 
policy towards all, who may in the main concur with us in the 
new state of things, without a too exclusive regard to the old 
lines, is indispensible to that object. But, in thinking thus, 
you must not suppose, that I surrender a particle of our prin- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 457 

ciples, or doctrines, or am disposed to merge in the ranks of 
the two great parties of the day. I am, and shall remain a 
state rights nullifier, and as such place my hopes, not in con- 
fidence in any man, or party, that does not accord in our own 
doctrines; but in the force of our position and the goodness 
of our cause. We have done much and can do more by firm- 
ness and sagacity. The election will be close and the contest 
severe, which is nothing the worse for the country. Should 
M r Van Buren be elected, it will be impossible for him to sus- 
tain himself without sustaining in the main our policy. His 
chief support must be from the South. But, if Gen 1 Harri- 
son should succeed, his speedy defeat would be inevitable. 
The resistance would be mainly from the South and on South- 
ern ground; and the triump our triump. Let us do our duty; 
adhere to our principles, conciliate the South, and support 
all, who support our measures, and oppose those, who oppose 
them, and to us will be the glory of saving the country and 
our institutions, if they are to be saved. 

As to yourself, } T OU have no friend, who wishes you better, 
than 1 do. I look to you, as one of the few, who must sus- 
tain the honour of the State and preserve, in their purity, her 
principles and doctrines. I would speak freely on the por- 
tion of your last letter which relates more particularly to 
yourself; but do not feel sufficiently master of the whole 
ground to offer an opinion. I think it desirable, if it can be 
honourably brought about, to the mutual satisfaction of both 
sides, that there should be no division in the State at this time, 
in reference to the Governor's election ; but know not whether 
it can be done, or not. I hope, however, that things will be 
kept quiet for the present, on both sides. If my position in 
the State and the confidence reposed in me, can be of any avail 
in preventing a contest and bring about an honourable and 
fair reconciliation of differences among those I regard as 
friends I would be happy to call them into service. Great 
events are before us. The country and Government cannot 
go along as it is now going. Revolution or reform must take 
place, and the next four or five years must decide. Which of 
the two it will be, depends much on our State and party. 

I must see you on my return. I have a great deal more to 
say, than can be put into a letter.

To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 30 th May 1840 

My DEAR ANNA, I have not heard from you for a long time, 
excepting a short note covering a letter to M rs Washington, 
which I forwarded as soon as it was received. I had received 
your letter referred to in the note and answered it some time 
before. I hope you got my letter. Since then, I received 
and answered M r Clemson's, so that you see I do not stand 
debtor in the account current of my correspondence with 
Millwood. 

Francis 1 arrived here with his family about a week since. 
He has taken his lodgings with us at M r Hill's. Eliza had 
improved a good deal by the journey, but I am sorry to say, 
that she is not so well again. She looks exceedingly delicate. 
The children are all well. 

1 was distressed to hear through Francis, that } T our health 
was not good, and could not but feel somewhat mortified, that 
you had not mentioned, or hinted at your indisposition, in any 
of your letters to me, nor had M r Clemson. I know the omis- 
sion could not have been caused by any supposed indifference 
on my part to the state of your health. On the contrary I 
cannot doubt that it originated in the opposite state of feel- 
ings, but, I must think mistaken one. Devoted attachment 
claims to know the condition of the object of its affection, 
whether it be good, or bad, to rejoice with the former and 
sympathize with the latter, and is ever pained, when either is 
concealed. Such is the law of our nature, though it may 
appear in some respects contradictory. Besides, if it be 
admitted that one in whom we take a deep interest may be 
silent when absent in his correspondence as to ill health 
or other misfortune more than half the pleasure of corre- 
spondence would be lost, which consists in being assured, that, 
though absent, we know the condition of our friend, for good 
or evil. Just so in your case will be the effect. Unless you 
expressly inform me hereafter, as to the state of your health 
by your letters, I shall infer, that it is not good. 

You must not suppose from what 1 have said, that M r 
Pickens represented you as seriously indisposed; but 1 infer 

1 Pickens. 






LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 459 

from what he understood, that your health is something more 
than merely indifferent. If such be the case, let me entreat 
you, my dear Daughter, to take immediate steps for the resto- 
ration of your health. Avoid medicine, except the most sim- 
ple kind, and rely on diet and proper exercise, with cheerful- 
ness and amusement, and change of scene. Take a visit to 
Fort Hill by gentle stages, where they will all be so glad to 
see you. The change of air, and the exercise will be of great 
service. 

You know how deeply I am impressed with the total neglect 
of health and constitution in the education of females, as well 
as in their mode of life. I regard it as one of the greatest 
calamities of the age. If not corrected, our whole race is 
destined to degenerate. The accomplishments acquired at 
school are nothing to be compared to the loss of a robust con- 
stitution and good health. I think you have never realized 
the truth of what I have so often said on the subject; but let 
me beseech you hereafter for your good and the good of those, 
who take such deep interest in you, to put a higher estimate 
on those great laws of our ph} 7 sical nature, the observance of 
which is as indispensible to health, as proper cultivation is to 
a good crop. 

My time has been and is still much engrossed by my many 
engagements, of which a pretty heavy correspondence is not 
the least. I am now turning my attention to the subject of 
bankruptcy, which is before the Senate. It is comparatively 
new to me. I find it to be a subject of great difficulty and 
danger. I will speak on it at length before the debate closes; 
and decidedly in opposition on all points. 1 I do not think the 
bill will pass. 

I sent M r Clemson and your Uncle the report on my land 
bill. 2 I suppose you will not be much at a loss in tracing the 
style and turn of thoughts to its author. I hope they received 
their copies. 

The Session I fear will be very long. I have little hope of

Senate Chamber 8 th June 1840 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . As to the Presidential elec- 
tion, my impression remains unchanged; that Gen 1 . Harrison 
will be defeated, and such, I think, begins to be the prevailing 
opinion here. 

As far as I am concerned I think the indications are very 
favourable. I certainly never had more control over meas- 
ures, and I think the publick opinion is gradually coming round 
to our principles and policy. I keep one great object in view, 
to which I make every move subordinate; to expelling the 
whole system of federal consolidation measures, and to give 
the government a fresh start, in the state rights direction. If 
it can be accomplished, it would be one of the most remark- 
able revolutions ever effected without force and would give 
the Government a new lease for its existence. As far as I can 
learn, publick opinion remains sound and undisturbed in our 
state. 



To James IT. Hammond? 

Washington 5 th July 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been so much occupied one way and 
another for the last few weeks, that I have got quite in the 
rear of my correspondence, which, I find, has so accumulated, 
that it will require a good deal of brevity in my answers to 
bring it up prior to the period fixed for an adjournment.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOITN. 461 

It always gives me pleasure to hear the views of my friends, 
even when we do not entirely concur, and so far from being 
fatigued with what 3^011 call long letters, but which do not 
appear so to me, that I have read all of yours with pleasure. 1 
It is difficult to compare views on great points in the form of 
a correspondence, as one question runs into another, so that 
it is impossible to take a correct view of any one point, with- 
out embracing the whole field of politicks. This is particu- 
larly true at the present juncture, which, if I do not mistake, 
is one of the most remarkable in our political history. It is 
the great turn of events, and the direction, which they may 
take in the next 5 or 6 years, will in my opinion in a great 
measure decide the future destiny of our country. I would 
be glad to go over the whole ground with you, and do hope, 
you will make us a visit next fall, among other things to com- 
pare our views and talk over the points, on which we have 
touched on in our correspondence, and others immediately 
connected. 

I send you a copy of my remarks on the bankrupt bill. I 
hope you received a copy of the report on my bill in reference 
to the publick lands in the new states, which I sent you some 
time since. 

You will have seen, that the Constitutional treasury has 
become a law. It is a great step, and if executed and carried 
out in its true sperit, will effect a great, permanent and salu- 
tary change in the moral, social and political condition of the 
country. 

Among other things, it will prove to have a direct and 
favourable bearing on the Tariff question, which runs far 
deeper into the currency question, than is generally supposed. 
You ask my opinion as to the principle, on which it ought to 
be adjusted. My aim shall be, to bring the whole duties, as 
far as I possibly can, to one uniform ad. val: as low as the 
economical wants of the treasury will permit; say about 10 
per cent. It will probably be found that some relaxation will 
be necessary; that is some articles to be admitted lower and 
some higher, but they ought to be made on proper reasons, 
founded on fiscal considerations. 

i See Hammond's letter of May 31, in Part II, post. 



462 AMEEICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I am not prepared to say, what is the prospect of a satis- 
factory adjustment. There will doubtless be strong resist- 
ance to a fair adjustment; but I should think the Tariff party 
is much weaker now, than it has been at any period, since the 
late war, and I have no idea, that they dare venture to claim 
farther protection, than what may result from the adjustment 
of the duties, within the revenue limits, say 20 per cent, as 
the extreme, favourably to the manufacturers. 

I shall take much pleasure in rendering all the aid I can, in 
conjunction with your member, to obtain a midshipman's war- 
rant for M r Patterson's son ; but I fear, it cannot be done this 
session, as our state, I understand, has more than its comple- 
ment at present. It is possible at the next session, should we 
have no vacancy, that some one of the Western States may 
permit his name to be charged to them, as is sometimes done.

Fort Hill 5 th August 1840 

MY DEAR ANDREW, ... I find the state very quite. 
In this District there are four candidates for Congress, Co 1 
Norris, M r Powell, Co 1 Doyley and D r . Butler; the three 
former opposed and the latter in favour of Harrison. It is 
thought that the Doctor, though in a minority may succeed, 
unless there should be a concentration on one of his oppo- 
nents. 1 Co 1 Calhoun and Bay ley Barton are opponents for 
the State Senate. 

Co 1 Pickens has no opponents, but I was surprised to learn, 
that there is so much Harrisonism in Abbeville. I heard more 
of it there than from N. Carolina there; and I would not be 
surprised if they got up an opposition to Co 1 Pickens, who is 
absent at the Virginia Springs, before the election comes on. 
Your reflections on the presidential canvas are perfectly 
just. It is disreputable to the country, and reflects disgrace 
on its intelligence and morals. . . . 

1 Dr. William Butler was in fact elected.

Fort Hill 10 th Aug* 1840 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . This state is relatively quiet, 
though there is a sprinkle of Harrisonism, more or less, all 
over the state. In this District it is pretty strong, as far as I 
can learn, but in a decided minority. There is a good deal in 
Abbeville to my surprise. The party had a meeting last Sale 
day at Abbeville and nominated a full ticket for the Legisla- 
ture and Starks of Hamburgh as the opponent of Co 1 Pickens. 
They had, I understand, the folly, after several speeches on 
their side, to invite discussion, and report says that they were 
completely put down by Wardlaw and Burt. D r . Arnold is 
the soul [of] the party. 

I enclose a copy of my answer 1 to the request of the Demo- 
cratick Republican party of New York to deliver the address 
at the late anniversary, in which 1 give, what I conceive is, or 
ought to be, the true issue before the country at this time. 
You may form some opinion of the principles of the party 
there, when I tell you, that they so approved of my answer, 
as to publish 10,000 copies. This speaks well. . . . 



To Armistead Burt? 

Fort Hill 20 th Aug* 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, ... 1 am glad, that the Harrison con- 
vention had the folly to invite discussion. All accounts concur 
in representing your's and Wardlaw's replies as triumphant. 
The effects must be happy, and will, I doubt not, stay the 
spread of Harrisonism, which is neither more nor less than old 
federalism, tainted with anti mason and abolition, and turned 
demagogue of the lowest order. 

I would not be surprised, if the effect of your replies should 
prevent the intended attendance of Thompson, and Preston, to 
address the party on Sale day. I know his feelings against 
me are as bitter as they can be; and the more so, because I 
have given him no cause of offence and have neglected to

notice him. He has carried his enmity so far, that he does 
not recognize me, and would no doubt feel compensated for 
the trouble of attending and making a Speech, if he thought 
it could in the least injure me. Should he attend and speak, 
it will be altogether in the ranting, declamatory and denuncia- 
tory style. He ought certainly to be replied to, and, I hope, 
yourself and Wardlaw will be present and meet him. No man 
is more easily refuted, as his arguments are loose and asser- 
tions bold and unguarded. Be well prepared as to facts, cool, 
strong and decisive, and a victory over him will be easily 
achieved, while it would be worth achieving, for his party has 
given him high reputation, for effect. I would not be sur- 
prised, if he should strike at M c Duffie, should he not be pres- 
ent. Would it not be well to give him a hint, so that he might 
be on the ground, ready to take a part, if necessary ? 

Everything seems quiet in this quarter. There is but little 
excitement, and it seems to be considered as certain, that Df 
Butler is in a decided minority, though he may be elected, in 
consequence of the division on the other side. 

We are all well, and M rs . C joins her kind regards to your- 
self and Martha.

Fort Hill 25 th Sep r 1840. 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . Co 1 Gadsden is with me, on 
his return from a meeting at Ashville of the direction of 
the rail road. Not a sufficient number attended to do business. 
They adjourned to meet in November in Charleston. Tennes- 
see has withdrawn by mutual consent, from those concerned, 
and all idea of going beyond Columbia openly abandoned. 
Thus ends the humbug, with a debt of several millions on the 
state, great loss to those concerned, and the loss of credit and 
mortification to the projectors. If I could triumph, when 
state and friends have suffered, what a triumph I would have! 

The Co 1 is getting along well. The road to Columbia will 
be finished next year, and, he thinks, will pay; and the stock 
of the company, now that common sense and honesty have the 
direction, is on the rise; and will probably be at, or above 
par in a few years, notwithstanding all the losses. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 465 

A* to the election, I should say from all indications N. York 
will decide the contest, which ever way she may vote. It is 
certain, that let who may come in, the administration will be 
weak, which is perhaps the best result for our principles and 
interest. I would fear a decided victory and a strong admin- 
istration either way, under existing circumstances.

Fort Hill 1 st Nov r 1840 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . We have nothing new. The 
state has gone with great unanimity against Harrison, though 
from every appearance he will succeed. It will bring in its 
train, a great change in the political condition of the country; 
and give great importance to the next session. The unanimity 
of this State will give it great weight; and it is not at all 
improbable, a reaction may take place, that will result in a 
more complete restoration of the constitution and reform of 
the government, than could be effected by an\ r other course of 
events. In the midst of many discouraging circumstances, there 
are not wanting some that are not a little encouraging. . . . 



To Armistead Hurt. 1 

Fort Hill 2 d Nov r 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, I had hoped to have had the pleasure of 
seeing you ere this, and of conversing with you fully in ref- 
erence to many questions connected with the present crisis; 
but as I now have but little prospect of meeting you, I write 
to touch on one, or two, that will soon call for action. 

It is probable, that Harrison will succeed, and he even may 
)>y a large vote, but with powerful minorities in all the states 
that vote for him. I see that there are already some Specu- 
lations as to our vote. It seems to me, if we should stand 
alone, as some absurdly think possible, we ought to vote for 
Van Buren; not that he is, or ought to be a favourite, but 
that it has become a point of honor and expediency, and the

greater the minority, the stronger both. The case, I think, 
different as to the V. P. It seems to me, that in no event 
ought we to vote for Johnson, 1 unless our vote should be the 
casting vote; but in that case, we ought, as bitter as would 
be the pill. It would not do to vote for Tyler. It would 
confound our position, and destroy our influence. Nor to 
throw away our vote, or vote- for a third individual, in the 
case supposed. It would greatly weaken the state and throw 
the whole responsibility on me, as the Senate, in that case, 
would have to choose between the two highest. 

In any other event, it strikes me, that the state ought to 
vote for Polk, or Tazewell; 2 and of the two the former, were 
he a candidate, but I understand, from an authentick source, 
he is not, &nd that he is a candidate for reelection, as gover- 
nor, and that the state will probably vote for Johnson, should 
the Republican party succeed. Under that view, I should 
think it best to give our vote to Tazewell, as evidence of our 
high regard for his character and devotion to the principles 
we hold in common. If such should be our vote, it would be 
well, that an article should appear in the Carolinian placing 
the vote on its true ground, a regard for the man and his 
principles, but without reflection on Johnson. 

I hope that everything will be done to avoid distraction and 
to keep the state quiet and united. If Harrison should suc- 
ceed Union at home may be necessary, not only for the Safety 
of the South, but of our free institutions. It would be better 
for the South to have a monarch at once, than a $50,000,000 
bank located in Philadelphia^ or New York. It would be to 
create a master, under existing circumstances a master with- 
out interest in us, or regard, or sympathy for us, and which 
would look to us exclusively as a subject of plunder. 

I would be glad to hear from you before the meeting of the 
Legislature, and frequently during the Session.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 467 

To Andrew Pickens Calhoun. p. AND M. c. 

Fort Hill ^2 d Nov r 1840 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . The utter overthrow of the 
administration will give deep interest to the approaching ses- 
sion. The Whigs are shouting and rejoicing over their bril- 
liant victory, as they call it; but, if I do not greatly mistake, 
it will prove the cause, among other things, of their speedy 
and utter overthrow. It will be hard to divide the spoils 
among such a host. 

I regard the fall of those in power, as the result of a deep 
principle of retributive justice. All the old sins of Jackson's 
time have come back on them; and, although I deplore the 
mode, in which they have been put down, and the immediate 
grounds on which it was done, I am not prepared to say, but 
what it will, in the end, contribute to a more thorough reform 
than could have been effected by the opposite result. Indi- 
vidually, I have nothing to regret. Their fall illustrates the 
truth and correctness of my course, for the last 15 years. 
Had the party followed my advise, they would not have ex- 
perienced their present defeat, and they can only retrieve 
their loss, by coming to my ground. I shall go into no con- 
test, that has not for its object, the thorough reform of the 
Government and the restoration of the Constitution, accord- 
ing to the old Republican principles and doctrines; and such 
is the unanimity of the State and the force of her moral 
character and position, that no opposition can be successful, 
in which she does not take a prominent part. 



To Thomas G. Cletnson. c. c. 

Washington 13 th Dec r 1840 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have just received yours of the 6 th and am 
not at all surprised, that you found things so much out of 
order. Stevens had totally neglected everything, so much so, 
that I could not take the least pleasure in going over the place 
on my return last summer. Whatever may be necessary for 
the place, you will get. I wish everything to be put and kept 
in good order. 



468 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I am glad that you found it so little troublesome to mend 
the breach in the embankment. It rained all night and day 
where I was on the road and I felt fearful, as it was the first 
heavy rain after the water was let in, that there would be 
some giving away. I think it would be advisable to continue 
on the embankment, till it is made secure. 

The weather has been so bad, that I fear the out door work 
has been much interrrupted. It is now raining and thawing, 
with very sloppy streets. 

I arrived here on the 9 th and wrote M rs Calhoun the next 
day. I hope she has received my letter. 

The political world is calm, as it usually is after a warm 
contest. There is much speculation in reference to the Cabi- 
net of the new administration, but no certainty as to who will 
compose it. The impression is, that the influence of M r Clay 
will prevail. From all appearance, the session will be a very 
quiet one. The finances are in a better state, than was antici- 
pated, which is an important point. It will embarress the 
Whigs, as they hoped to have a publick debt, on which to build 
a bank. 

I had a letter from Andrew since my arrival. His cotton 
will not equal expectation, which I find is turning out gener- 
ally to be the case. I wish the little I make to be ginned and 
baled and put away safely. I do not intend to sell till after 
my return. . . . 



To A. D. Wallace. v 

Washington, 17 th Dec r . 1840 

D r SIR, You ask me a question not easy to answer. There 
is no satisfactory work extant on our system of government. 
The Federalist is the fullest and, in many respects, the best, 
but it takes many false views and by no means goes to the 
bottom of the system. The Virginia and Kentucky resolu- 
tions and the report to the Virginia Legislature by Mr. Madi- 
son on the Alien and Sedition Acts take far deeper and more 
correct views, but are less full. The South Carolina contro- 
versy with the General Government develops and carries out 

i Text derived from a copy furnished by Mr. Simon Gratz, of Philadelphia. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 469 

those views more fully, but have never been collected and can 
only be found in scattered pamphlets and essays. I regard 
Story's Commentaries as essentially false and dangerous. 

I would advise a young man with your views to make him- 
self thoroughly acquainted with the history of the free States 
of antiquity and the history of England and our Country, and 
to read the best elementary treatises on Government, includ- 
ing Aristotle's, which I regard as among the best. To this 
must be added a thorough knowledge of political economy, 
and of his Country in all its relations, external and internal, 
including its resources and the character of the people. But 
all this leaves much that can only be acquired by actual ex- 
perience. Let me add that all other acquirements are of little 
avail, without the power of speaking and writing well, both 
of which, in free communities like ours, are indispensible to 
success. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 26 th Dec r 1840 

MY DEAK SIR, Your letter gave me the first intimation I 
had, that the Whigs contemplated taking up the individual 
you refer to for the Senate. I had supposed, after what had 
occured, he would be to them the most obnoxious man in the 
Union, and the very last they would select. But there is no 
knowing what sudden and unexpected changes may be made 
in such corrupt times. It is not much less surprising, they 
should select the man they have to fill the collector's place. 

As to the subtreasury, you will have seen, that M r Clay 
has already moved its repeal, and the part I took in the debate, 
which is fairly reported in the Globe, but infavourably, as 
usual, as far as I am concerned, in the Intelligencer. I had the 
good fortune, in my remarks, to obtain the approbation of all 
sides, even Clay's friends. 1 disagree with you, that we ought 
to agree to the repeal. I do not despair, (if we can preserve 
it,) of defeating the National bank. There will be found 
great difficulty in getting one. We must run the hazard of 
the bad management of the Subtreasury to defeat the bank. 
That is all important. 



470 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

It seems to be agreed, that Webster is to take the State 
Department, Ewing of Ohio, the Post Office, Crittenden to 
be attor y Gen 1 , and Seargent probably the Treasury and Bell 
the War Dep*. l It is also thought, Clay assents to the arrange- 
ment, with the understanding, that he is to have the succession. 

The policy of the party is clearly to create a national debt, 
and, out of the stock, to make a bank, and, with the two, 
establish a tariff. Nothing can be done in reference to the 
last this session. 

I will always be glad to hear from you. What did you do 
in reference to the rail road? 

My love to Maria and Eliza and family.

Fort Hill [Washington] 3 d Jan y 1841 2 

You need never fear, my dear daughter, that I would ever 
think you egotistical, should you speak ever so much of your- 
self. There is nothing, that concerns you, that is indifferent 
to me, or in which I would not take more interest, than if it 
concerned nryself individually. I regret deeply to learn, that 
you do not consider yourself better; and, although I know 
with what fortitude you bear affliction, I cannot but hope, the 
weariness from long confinement within doors, which must 
more or less effect the sperits of those of the greatest forti- 
tude, has made }^ou regard your case less favourably than it 
really is. Nature is always at work to repair derangements 
in our s} 7 stem, and, although the process may be slow, with 
youth and a good constitution on your side, there is much to 
hope, where the disease does not prove to be so strong as to 
gain ground. 

Without any knowledge of medicine or treatment that would 
be proper in your case, I would say, that strict care in regard 
to diet, eating sufficient and no more, of what is nutritious 
and easy of digestion, combined with as much exercise, as is 
consistent with the case, and agreeable and cheerful society 
are of great importance.

LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 471 

You must not read too much, or do that, which tires, or 
worries you, and as highly, my dear Anna, as I prize a letter 
from you, you must abstain from writing to me, till your 
health improves; as I cannot doubt from the posture, in which 
you are compelled to write, it must be very fatiguing. You 
must get M r Clemson and your mother, when they write, to 
put in a paragraph for you. 

I am glad the boys are sent to the dancing school, that is, if 
the master is a competent teacher. It is a desirable accom- 
plishment, and an almost indispensible appendix to the social 
intercourse of the two sexes in early life, so necessary for the 
happiness and accomplishment of both. Tell James, that he 
must not dispair of contracting graceful accomplishments. 
All he wants is to tr} 7 . M r Clemson's full and satisfactory 
communication and his devoted attention to the place, puts 
me entirely at my ease, as far as my business is concerned. 
I have no doubt he will do better, than I would, if present. 

The weather is exceedingly sharp and clear today, and I 
think it is the best sleighing. I ever saw. The snow is per- 
fectly dry and the surface very smooth. 

New Year's day was exceedingly inclement. It blew and 
snowed the whole day. I attended notwithstanding the levee, 
a thing I would not have done in such weather, had not the 
incumbent been defeated. Many, I suppose, attended from 
the same consideration. It was, however, but thinly attended, 
and, I must say, dull. There were no refreshments; the omis- 
sion of which, I regard, as a great want of taste, as the day was 
bad, and it was the last occasion during this administration. 

I do not go to any parties at all, and can give you but little 
news of the gay world; but I understand, that the city is very 
dull, and that there are but few ladies from abroad. 

Our Mess this year is small, but agreeable. We have but 
one lady, M rs Starkweather, the wife of a member of that 
name from Ohio. She is a native of Providence, Rhode Island, 
and is quite an agreeable woman. Thus far, the session has 
been very quiet, and I think is like to continue so. 

I am glad to learn from Co 1 Pickens, that Eliza is about to 
pay you a visit. It will add much to your society, and, I 
hope, she will remain with you during the winter. I look 
forward with pleasure to the time, when I shall return and

me are great drawbacks, which nothing, but a deep sense of 
duty could make tolerable to me.

To Armistead Burt. 1 

Washington 24 th Jan y 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . We are getting along slowly with 
business, but I am inclined to think, the better for being slow. 
As there will be a change of administration, it seems to me, 
all that can be properly postponed ought to be, in deference 
to the popular will, which has decreed the change. Under 
this impression, I had hoped, that we should have a quiet Ses- 
sion; but the Harrison leaders in the Senate seem determined 
that his administration should commence before his inaugura- 
tion. They are pushing forward most of their leading meas- 
ures in order to prepare the way for a national bank; the 
repeal of the Subtreasury, the distribution of the proceeds of 
the publick lands, bankruptc} T &c. We are now engaged in a 
warm discussion of the distribution scheme. I spoke yester- 
day against the unconstitutional and iniquitous measure at 
large, 2 and was replied to by M r Webster. The debate is like 
to become very warm. M r Webster took the bold ground of 
the right and expediency of raising revenue from impost to 
distribute among the States, and proposed with that view to 
lay duties on Wines Silks and the like! I regard the fate of 
the coming administration as staked on the question; and, 
wonderful as it would seem, Preston, Thompson, Dawson 8 and 
others appear to be disposed to support it. If it should suc- 
ceed, it would be fatal. There is no end to the extent of 
plunder which would grow out of it. 

I am in the midst of a great pressure of business and you 
must excuse a short letter. My love to Martha and all 
relatives.

Washington 26 th Jan y 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I find, I am quite in arrears with you in 
our correspondence; your last three letters remaining to be 
acknowledged, which you must attribute to my many engage- 
ments and, among them, a heavy correspondence. You have 
kept me so fully informed on all points connected with the 
plantation operations, that I seem to myself to understand 
what is going on almost as well, as if I was at home. It is a 
great relief to me. 

You must, indeed, have had much trouble and great delay 
with the breaches in the embankment, the heavy rains and 
the deranged condition of the plantation, and must have 
exercised great vigilance to get along as well as you have. 

I am happy to hear, that you think Anna something better. 
I have been exceedingly uneasy about her, but still hoped, 
that with her good constitution, if she got no worse, a favour- 
able turn would take place, which I am happy to think may 
be the case. 

We are in the midst of a very exciting debate. The imme- 
diate question is the proposition to divide the revenue from 
the lands among the states. I spoke on Saturday to a very 
crowded house, 1 and was replied to by M r Webster. He took 
the broad ground of the right to assume the state debts, and 
to charge the assumption on the impost; that is, to compel 
the states out of debt to pay the states in debt, and charge it 
on the foreign exchanges of the country, or, what is the 
same, the export states. I regard the proposition as the most 
wicked and unconstitutional ever made; and that if it should 
succeed, the Government would be subverted; and yet it is 
the measure on which the new administration has staked 
itself, if we may judge of its course by those who one would 
suppose have a right to speak for it in the Senate. The battle 
will be severe, but 1 do not dispair of defeating it, especially 
if the new states do their duty manfully. The final question 
will be between this profligate scheme, and the measure I 
have proposed. If we defeat it, the administration of Harri-

son will be defeated, and, if not, the Government will be, as 
far as the great objects for which it was created is con- 
cerned.

Washington 17 th Feb 1841 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, I have been much longer delayed in 
answering your last letter, than I intended, owing to the 
active part I had to take in the land question. I had to make 
three speeches; 1 all of them with considerable preperation in 
advance, and after delivered, I had to draw out from imper- 
fect notes. That, with a continual run of visitors and atten- 
tion to the ordinary business of the session, has left me few 
spare moments, for the last three weeks, which will account 
for my falling so much in arrears with my home correspond- 
ence. But, I delivered the last of my speeches to the printer 
yesterday, and have just commenced with bringing up my 
back correspondence, begining with yourself. By the time 
that is done, I shall have to take up the Odious business of 
directing franking and sending out speeches and documents, 
which will take two or three days, when I hope to have leisure 
for the residue of the Session, to attend to my preperations to 
return home and be with you all, which I so ardently desire. 
I am so retired from the world of fashion and amusement 
here, that you will not expect a newsf ul letter from me; and 
I am glad to find }^ou have another correspondent here (Co 1 
Pickens) who will supply my deficiency in that respect. The 
debates in Congress have flaged for the last five or six days, 
and, I suppose, will continue dull the rest of the Session. As 
the time approaches, the office seekers begin to flock to the 
city and set seige to Gen 1 Harrison; who I understand is pro- 
fuse of promises. It is almost distressing to see him. He is 
now in his 69 th year, with the full share of infirmity belong- 
ing to that age, and very little of even the physical strength 
necessary to encounter the heavy responsibility belonging to 
his station; yet, as unconscious as a child of his difficulties 
and those of his country, he seems to enjoy his elevation as a

mere affair for personal vanity. I called on him, and he re- 
ceived me, as I understand he receives everybody, with all 
familiarity, as if we had been old cronies. I staid but a few 
minutes. Day before yesterday, he came into the Senate 
Chamber, while the body was in session. * I did not see him 
when he came in, nor did I know that he was in the Chamber. 
I was sitting in my seat (the one I occupied when you were 
here) with my face towards the front entrance into the Cham- 
ber, and the Gn 1 was in the lobby behind the V. P. chair. I 
had my back toward him. I felt some one tap me on the 
shoulder, and turning round, low and behold it was the Presi- 
dent elect. I felt the awkwardness of the situation to both 
him and myself, and rose and led the way to the lobby to 
avoid standing up on the floor of the Senate conversing with 
him and attracting the eyes of all. He followed and immedi- 
ately began the most familiar kind of conversation, as to the 
course he intended to take, which, however, was soon inter- 
rupted by others com ing up. I have given the circumstances 
of this little incident, as characteristick of the man. They 
keep him in one perpetual round of visiting and speaking. 
When I compare all this to the imminently critical condition 
of the country in many respects, I am at a loss to anticipate 
what may come. The only hope is that he may be perfectly 
passive and leave it to the strongest about him to take the 
control. As bad as it may be, it cannot be as bad as the ab- 
sence of all control. I hope, my dear Anna, your health is 
at least not worse than it has been, though I cannot, but fear, 
from the tone of your letter to Co 1 Pickens and the silence of 
3^our mother and M r Clemson in relation to it, that it is not 
as good as it was; but I trust my fears are not well founded. 
I hope soon to be with you and to aid in keeping up your 
sperits. I think, if there should be no decided improvement, 
and if it should be possible for your strength to bear it, you 
ought to visit Charleston with the view to the best medical ad- 
vice, and the benefit of seabathing, which is said to be excel- 
lent, as soon as the season would admit of moving. I send 
you by the mail that takes this two numbers of different 
periodicals, in which I hope you may find something to 
amuse you and to pass away the time. I have not read either. 
When you are done, put them aside for me to read on my 
return.

Washington 23 d Feb. 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, ... As to politicks we have little be- 
yond what you will see in the papers. The enthusiasm of log 
Cabin is abating and in its place discord begins to show itself 
in the ranks of the Whigs. The Senate will be nearly equally 
divided, so much so, that it is not improbable, that Preston 
will have the casting vote on the bank, and, if so, I fear it 
will be carried. We shall, I think defeat distribution. I had 
no idea of carrying the cession at this .time. It had to com- 
pete both with Distribution and Benton's preemption scheme; 
but when the vote comes to be between it and distribution, it 
has a fair prospect of success. I sent you my three speeches 
on the subject of the publick lands which I hope you have 
received; and now send by the mail, that takes this, a docu- 
ment giving the loss by the banks to the Government and the 
Community. . . .

Washington, 23 d Feb, 1841. 

DEAR SIR, I have been honored with your communication of 
the 15 th inst. covering resolutions of the Democratic Repub- 
lican party, and inviting me in behalf of the committee, and 
the young men of the State, to address the Convention, to be 
held at Milledgeville on the first Monday in May. 1 cannot 
but be highly gratified with this testimony of regard, coming 
from a quarter so respectable, and regret that I am compelled 
to decline the invitation, as I expect to have an engagement 
at the time, which will not permit my attendance. 

Standing as we do on the old Republican ground of opposi- 
tion to a National Bank, to a protective Tariff, to the dangerous 
scheme of distributing the revenue from the public domain, to 
the renewal of illegitimate connection between the Govern- 
ment and the Banks, and in favor of the rights of the States, 
and the strict construction of the constitution, there is no

cause for despair from the recent defeat. It will be but 
temporary, if we, as a party, shall rigidly adhere to our prin- 
ciples and doctrines. They lie deep in the public confidence, 
and cannot be permanently shaken while the people shall 
prove worthy of liberty; but, if we should depart from them, 
or give them a luke- warmed heartless support, power will per- 
manently change hands, and our political system undergo an 
entire revolution.

Washington 10 th March 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, The Senate has not yet adjourned. The 
Cabinet appointments have all been confirmed and we are now 
engaged in discussing the motion made by M r Mangum to 
recind the contract with Blair and Rives to do the printing. 
The debate to day was warm and personal between M r King 
of Alabama and M r Clay of Kentucky, so much so, that it is 
rumoured, that the latter has challenged the former. It is 
still uncertain when we shall adjourn, but I hope tomorrow or 
next day. I shall leave immediately after and have concluded 
to take the route by Charleston. 

The Extra Session is not yet finally determined on. 

The city is still crowded with the office seekers, most of 
whom must go home sadly disappointed. 

I defer till I return the other subjects on which I would 
otherwise write you. 

I am rejoiced to learn that Anna continues to be something 
better. 

My love to all.

Washington 13 th June 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letter of the 6 th Ins*, 
and one of a prior date and am much gratified to learn that 
things are going on so well at Fort Hill. The warm and moist 
weather must have a powerful effect on the crop, and backward 
as the cotton was will I hope bring it out. My last account 



478 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

from Andrew was of the 23 d of May. The crop then both of 
corn and cotton looked well. 

I enclose a letter from the Hon: M r Anderson of Tennessee 
in reference to the blooded cattle he promised to send me. I 
wrote him soon after my arrival here requesting him, if he 
had not sent them to delay till fall, for fear of the distem- 
per. I hope he may have received my letter before he started 
them, but I fear not, and feel greatly apprehensive that I, may 
loose them from the great heat of the weather and change of 
climate. If on consulting with M r William Sloan, or M r 
Fredericks you should think that there is hazard, they ought 
without delay to be droved gently to the mountains and put 
in charge of some careful person to take care of them there. 
I have no doubt M r Sloan would take charge of them with 
pleasure, and his place being on the summit of the range 
would afford perfect safety. They are too valuable to be lost. 

The Federalists headed by M r Clay are driving on desper- 
ately to effect their object, and I greatly fear will carry all 
their measures. They will, however, have to encounter a 
powerful opposition. We have the advantage of perfect con- 
cord in our ranks, while there is much dissatisfaction in theirs; 
but in the end they get together. Several of our Senators 
are absent, which greatly weakens us. The course of M r 
Tyler is doubtful. He is no doubt deeply opposed to Clay, 
but he is essentially a man for the midle ground, and will 
attempt to take a midle position now when there is none. 
Such is my fears. If he should he will be lost. 

I hope Anna is entirely recovered from her slight indispo- 
sition. My own health is good, though somewhat exhausted 
by the excessively warm weather. 

My love to all.

Washington 28 th June 1841 

MY DEAR ANNA, I have been intending to write you for 
some days, but am so completely overwhelmed with business 
that I have scarcely a moment of leisure left. We set nearly 
seven hours a day in the Senate, begining at 10 o'clock and 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CLAHOUN. 479 

continuing till near 5; so intent are the Whigs on publick 
plunder. This of itself is enough to exhaust a vigorous con- 
stitution, at this hot season of. the year; but when you add, 
the time necessarily consumed out of the Senate in prepera- 
tion to meet the momentous questions, which are forced on 
us in such rapid succession and of consultation to produce 
concert of action, you will be able to form some conception 
how closely we are engaged, and how little time is left for 
relaxation, exercise and correspondence. Thus far, I have 
stood it well. My general health is good, although I some 
times feel debilitated with the heat, and incessant occupation. 
I hope our labour will not be in vain. The very existence of 
our institutions is at stake. We have brought to the ground 
the old compactly built system of federal measures; funded 
debt, national bank, Tariff, and illegal and unconstitutional 
appropriations. The whigs are making a desperate struggle 
to reconstruct the system, and we to defeat them. We have, 
1 think, gained on them since the begining of the Session. 
They came here in high sperits, and commenced pushing their 
measures with audacity. They are now disperited and dis- 
tracted; but I fear may rally and carry their measures, as 
they will be utterly broke, if they should not. The course 
of M r Tyler is still doubtful. To day we will go on with the 
bank, unless the death of General McComb 1 should cause an 
adjournment. He died of apoplexy. It was the third attack. 

Patrick has not yet arrived. One of the graduates arrived 
last evening. He said Patrick had gone to Albany on a visit, 
and would not be here for several days. 

I have received M r Clemson's letter written just before he 
left home, and was much gratified to learn that all were well 
and the crop looking well. His letters are very full and sat- 
isfactory. Tell William that I have got his letter, and will 
answer it the first leisure, and say to James and John, when 
he returns, that they must not neglect to write and to give me 
a full account of their studies and progress since I left home, 
as well as what they have read. 

My last account from Alabama was of the 15 th Ins*. At 
that time all were well and the crop very fine. 

1 Alexander Macomb, commander-in-chief of the United States Army, died June 25, 1841 



480 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Say to your Mother, I will write her in a few days; and 
that I have not received a single line from her in return to the 
letters, which I have written since I left home. 

I do hope, my dear child, that you health continues to 
improve. Take every possible care of yourself, and as much 
gentle exercise, as you can. I do not write this with the view 
of getting an answer. I know how fatiguing writing must 
be to you, and you must not think of writing me in reply. 

Give my love to all. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 11 th July 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 4 th yesterday and 
am happy to learn, that all are well and that the prospect is 
so good for a crop. 

When 1 last heard from Alabama, the prospect there was 
exceedingly fine, both corn and cotton, and what is important, 
in reference to the corn, very early. Andrew says three 
weeks more so than the crop of '39, which was so fine. Should 
the present appearance of a good crop be realised, and the 
price of cotton be but ten cents, the South would be relieved 
from embarrassment, provided the Government should let us 
alone. 

Whether it will or not is exceedingly doubtful. Clay and 
the Whigs are exerting every nerve to carry their measures, 
and resorting to the most despotick and unusual rules to ac- 
complish their object, but the resistance, particularly in the 
Senate, is steady, concentrated and effective. It is now a ques- 
tion exceedingly doubtful, whether a single one of their meas- 
ures will pass. It stands on the cast of a die, whether they 
shall lose all, or carry all. There is a good deal of giving 
away in their ranks, and still more distraction, which would 
lead to certain defeat, were it not for the shame and certain 
overthrow, if a session call[ed] for the purpose of passing 
their batch of measures, should terminate without doing any- 
thing. This and this alone holds them together, and this and 
this alone will carry their measures, if they should be carried 
at all. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. - 481 

We are now engaged on the bank bill in the Senate (Clays.) 
Its fate is doubtful. I do not think it will pass the body. 
The probability is, that it will be defeated by one or two 
votes; but that Ewing's bill will be taken up immediately in 
the other House, and passed through by the previous question 
and sent to the Senate, where, I think, it would pass and be- 
come a law by the Sanction of the President. This I fear, 
and it is the only thing I do. I should much rather Clay's 
bill should pass and be vetoed. 

Our sittings are exceedingly laborious, averaging about six 
hours in the day and thirty six in the week. This, at this 
warm season, combined with a heavy correspondence, reading 
of documents and preperation for discussion is heavy and 
exhausting work. My health continues good under it, but I 
feel jaded; though I take regular exercise, eat and drink 
temperately and sleep soundly. 1 walk morning and evening 
on an average two and three miles a day. I long to be home 
and be quiet; but unless we can defeat the bank, which I 
think would defeat all the other measures and terminate the 
M ion, 1 fear we shall be detained here till September. 

Patrick is with me. He visited Albany and Saratoga after 
he passed his examination, which detained him. He passed 
with reputation, considering his great loss of time by sick- 
ness. He looks well and intends to return home in 7 or 8 
days, should he receive his commission in that time. The list 
has not yet been sent on from the Point, and the appoint- 
ments cannot be made till it comes. 1 Say to Anna, that he 
will write her in a day or two. 

I have in a great measure made up my mind to send John 
to the Virginia University, where he can select his studies. 
I do not think he has any taste for the classicks. I wish him 
to cease their study, and direct his studies to arithmetick, 
(n'ometry, English Grainmer, if not already familiar with it, 
writing, including spelling and composition, till I return. If 
it does not put you to inconvenience, I would be glad you 
would see M r Anderson in reference to his studies and request 
his particular attention to him; and do urge on John the 
importance of exerting himself. 

( i i ve love to all.

To Thomas G. Clemson. e. c. 

Washington 23 d July 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much gratified to learn, that the health 
of the family remains good and that the crop continues still so 
promising. I hope that the small surface exposed by the 
breach in the waste way will not endanger the health of the 
place, but if that or any other cause should make it the least 
hazardous to remain on the place, the family had better take 
rooms in the Village. I hope, however, there will be no 
necessity. We were 11 years on the place with the mill dam, 
without a case of the fever. 

By the last accounts from Alabama our crop was fine, as 
could be. 

Things here are as uncertain now, as they were when I 
last wrote you. The only thing, that seems settled, is, that 
Clay's project of a bank will either not pass, or be vetoed. 
My impression is, that the probability is, that no measure, for 
which the Session was called, will become a law except the 
loan bill. We have certainly gained much on the Whigs dur- 
ing the session. They came here in high sperits and united; 
but are now distracted and disperited, while on our side there 
is perfect concord on all points connected with the objects of 
the Session. 

I sent to you by the mail of yesterday two numbers of the 
Review, and a few da}^s before wrote to M rs Calhoun. I am 
astonished to learn from h er letter, that she has received but 
one letter from me since I left home. I have wrote at least a 
half dozen. Andrew makes the same complaint, when I have 
written an equal number to him. I know not how to explain 
it. I hope that there is no espionage over my correspondence. 

Patrick is still here waiting his commission, which I hope he 
and the other cadets will receive in a few days. 

Give my love to all. I hope Anna gains strength.

Washington 26 th July 1841 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . The bank bill is now at the 
engrossment. We, the Republicans, proposed the question 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 483 

yesterday, but the Whigs declined taking it, and moved aiu 
adjournment. The object of which was to try to obtain a com- 
promise in order to Unite all their force. They stated they 
would be ready to put the question at 12 o'clock to day, when 
it will probably be taken. The result is doubtful. It depends 
on Preston, and Merrick of Maryland. 1 Had the question been 
put 3^esterday, it would have been lost; but there is no say- 
ing, what the operation of one night may effect. Should it 
fail to day, great confusion will be the result in the ranks of 
our opponents, so much so, that I would not be surprised, that 
the session should break up in 8- or 10 days without doing any- 
thing. It would be a most fortunate result. But whether 
defeated to day, or not, I do not think the bill can become a 
law. It would, I think, fall under the veto, in which case 
though the Session would be prolonged, it would end in noth- 
ing, except indeed, the contraction of a debt of $12,000,000. 
Taken it altogether, the prospect is fair, that this extraordi- 
nary session will prove a failure. 

I have been so busy that I have had no time to prepare 
speeches for the press, or send them out. Only two of mine 
have appeared in pamphlet form, and both of them so imper- 
fectly prepared, that I am almost ashamed to send them out. 2 
I enclose them in this. 

I am very anxious to hear from you. Give my love to Mar- 
geret and kiss Duff for his grandfather. 



To James H. Hammond? 

Washington 1 st August 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I am truly gratified, that the late Gov- 
ernor's election has passed over without causing distraction in 
our ranks, at this most important juncture. Much is due to 
both sides, but especcially the defeated, that good feelings and 
harmony should so speedily follow so sharp a struggle. It is 
in the sperit of our noble little state.

Your claims, I trust, have only been postponed; and, 1 do 
hope, that the unanimity with which you may be elected at the 
next election, will be such as will more than compensate you 
for the loss of time. You have no friend, that will be more 
gratified with such a result than myself. 

The state of things here have never been more uncertain, 
than at present. You have, of course, seen under what cir- 
cumstances Clay's bill passed the Senate. Could we have got 
the question on the engrossment the day before, the bill would 
have been lost. Preston and Merrick were brought in to its 
support the night before the question was put. In fact the 
da}^ it was put, it would have been lost, if Tennessee had been 
fully represented, or had Clayton, or Henderson voted on the 
compromise amendment. They were both against it, and its 
defeat would have been the defeat of the bill. The vote on 
the passage would have been 26 to 25 had M r Cuthbert and 
M r Clayton been present. They would have both voted 
against it, so that the question of engrossment and that of its 
passage were carried by my colleague. Such was its narrow 
escape in the Senate. It seems to be conceded, that should it 
pass the House in its present shape, it will fall under the veto. 
To avoid that, the only alternative seems to be, to adopt 
E wing's project. Whether the House can be brought to 
adopt it, or if it should, whether the Senate would concur, is 
doubtful. Nor is it at all certain, if it should, whether it 
would receive the executive sanction. If it should become a 
law, I am of the impression, that both the Tariff and Distri- 
bution bills will probably pass; but, if not, that they will both 
fail, and the session come to a speedy end. The loss of the 
bank bill, would probably break up the Whig party, and lead 
to a remodeling of the Cabinet. 

In the mean time I have never seen the Republican party so 
sound as at present so united both on measures and princi- 
ples, with so little jar about men. Whatever may be the 
result of the session, I cannot doubt the overthrow of the 
Whigs, at the next elections. Discord and division have 
entered their ranks. The split between Clay and Tyler can- 
not be healed. They are both aspirants for the next term, 
and it is now or never for both. Neither will yield. 

I voted against Rives ammendment on several grounds. I 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 485 

regarded both schemes to be equally unconstitutional and 
objectionable, but of the two it seemed to me that Rives was 
the most dangerous, because more plausible and likely to 
impose on the unthinking. The fact, that it would probably 
receive the Sanction of the President had its weight, but with- 
out it, the other consideration would have controlled me. 
I shall at all times be happy to hear from you. 



To Martin Van Buren.^ 

Washington 5 th Aug*. 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, The gratification I would feel, in accepting 
the invitation of the New York Lyceum to deliver before 
them an introductory Lecture, preparatory to their next 
winter course, would be not a little increased by meeting with 
your individual wishes; but it is utterly out of my power. 

I have been absent, with the exception of three or four 
weeks, from my family and business ever since the 25 th Novem- 
ber last, and see no prospect of being released from my official 
duties here for some weeks to come; which would leave me but 
a short [period] of a few weeks to remain at home, before the 
next meeting of Congress. Under such circumstances, I feel 
it to be a duty, belonging to my domestick and private rela- 
tions, not to lose a day in my return home, when released 
from my publick engagements here 

I avail myself of the occasion to express the very high 
estimate I place on the object of the Lyceum. 1 regard the 
establishment of such institutions, as a step of great impor- 
tance, in accelerating the march of improvement and civiliza- 
tion, for which the age is so distinguished.

to learn that all are well and doing well. I also received a let- 
ter by the same mail from Andrew of the 20 th July. There 
has not been a case of sickness on the place and the crop is 
superb. No worm up to that date, nor any other draw back. 
He says, if the present prospect should be realised, that it 
will be impossible for him to harvest his cotton crop, without 
additional force. I hope, that the getting in of my crop will 
be pushed from the first, so that my hands intended to be sent 
out, may go as early as possible. 

M rs Calhoun wrote me about M r Miller's making my negro 
shoes. I made no bargain with him, but if he will make them 
as cheap, as I can get them in Augusta, or Charleston and 
equally good, I have no objection to employing him, and 
would willingly give him the preference. The leather must 
be good, and the putting together, whether it be by pegs or 
thread, must be effectually done. M r Fredericks had better 
look at the leather before hand, and M r Miller furnish a pair, 
as a specimen, so that there may be no mistake. 

I wrote M rs Calhoun yesterday and put under cover to you, 
in the hope, that it may fair better, than most of my letters 
to her seem to have done. 

I am utterly at a loss to know, why M r Guyer has not writ- 
ten either to you or myself. He must have got the papers. 
Judge Carter promised me to deliver them himself. I wrote 
to him shortly after my arrival here, but have had no answer. 
I shall write him again by the first private opportunity that 
is safe. There is something strange about it. 

The Bank bill is gone to Tyler, and we shall have his response 
I suppose in a few days. It will, I little doubt, be a veto, but 
I fear will leave an opening for a bank in another form, and 
which will amount to little. Should such be the case, he will 
gain little, bat if he places his veto on high ground, and will 
carry through his old principles and polic} 7 , he may acquire a 
truly enviable position. 

We have got up at last the Distribution bill in the Senate. 
It is, if possible, worse than the bank. Its fate is doubtful. 

I hope Anna may soon leave her bed with safety and that 
there will be an entire restoration of her health and strength. 
I am glad to hear, the child is doing so well, and is so quiet. 
My own health is good. It has been very healthy in the City.

Washington I 8t Sep r . 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I write to say, that the time of adjournment 
is not yet fixed; but we will certainly adjourn some time next 
week, say a week from to day. The impatience of the mem- 
bers to leave is so great that they can no longer be detained. 

The fiscal corporation will be taken up to day and will, I 
think, be sent to the President tomorrow. It will be vetoed. 
The loan bill, the worst of all is before him. It will proba- 
bly be signed. The Tariff bill, an abominable one, will be 
passed. 

I am overwhelmed with business and have time to add but 
little more. I shall leave immediately after the adjournment, 
and will return by Raleigh, Salisbury, and, if there be a stage 
line, by Lincolnton and Greenville. 

I will probably not write again till I leave. I shall not 
have a leisure moment. I heard from Andrew as late as the 
14 th . All well and the prospect very good. 

My love to all. 



To Andrew P. Calhoun. p. AND M. c. 

Washington 12 th Sep fc 1841 

MY DEAR ANDREW, You will have seen ere this reaches 
you that the fiscal corporation has been vetoed; that the Sec- 
retaries of the Treasury, of War and the navy, with the 
attorney General have resigned, and that Mr Forward of 
Pennsyl a , Judge McLean of Ohio, Judge Upsher of Virginia, 
and Mr Legare of our state have been appointed in their 
places. Mr Granger, the Postmaster General has it is said 
also resigned, but his successor is not yet nominated. 

The effect of the double veto is to defeat the bank at least 
for the next three or four years. That is a great gain; but I 



488 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

fear it will in the end lose us as much if not more than we 
shall gain. 

From all I can see, Mr Tyler will attempt a middle course, 
or rather stop where he is. In his last veto he speaks with 
approbation of all the measures of the Extra Session, with 
the single exception of the bank bill. 

If he should take the course I suppose, the consequence 
will be, that he will draw to him all that portion of our party 
who were opposed to a bank, but in favor of the other meas- 
ures, or at least not opposed. At the head of these, I regard 
the Pennsylvania interest. That state is in debt, and is 
inclined to the Tariff, and is not unfavorable to large appro- 
priations and free expenditures, and I fear disposed to [ ] 
with the defeat of the bank; and such I also fear is the feel- 
ing of her prominent men in Congress, particularly Mr Buch- 
anan. It is that interest, 1 am inclined to think, that has been 
consulted in the formation of the new Cabinet. Mr Forward 
is a Pennsylvanian and a tariff man, and his appointment to 
the Department of the Treasury must have a controlling 
influence over that and all connected measures. 

If I am right in these impressions our situation, I mean all 
who are opposed to all the other measures as well as the bank., 
will be one of great embarrassment. Tyler will certainly be 
opposed by the Whigs. If we join in that opposition we shall 
be confounded with them; but if we oppose them, and defend 
Tyler and his administration, we shall sink down to the level 
of their principles and policy, and lose all the fruits of our 
passed efforts. I say lose all, for a half way victory is no vic- 
tory at all over the Whigs. It would be sure to react, and 
draw with it another bank. The system will constantly tend 
to complete itself, which it cannot do without a bank. The 
probability of a reaction would be greater than the prob- 
ability of the system maintaining itself against our attacks, 
had the bank not been vetoed. Our whole force, in that case, 
would have been united and impelled on with a zeal and 
energy, which would have been almost irresistible, and could 
hardly have failed to lead to a complete victory, a victory 
worth acheving. Whereas, with our force weakened by divi- 
sions, and embarrassed by the position of parties, either in 
opposing or defending Mr Tyler and his administration, we 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 489 

have a less prospect of victory, and one less decisive, if it 
should be acheved. 

In this embarrassed state, I see but one way to act, and that 
requiring great caution and prudence; to stand fast on our 
principles, propose but few measures, and to oppose or sup- 
port the measures proposed by Whigs or administration, just 
as they accord with or oppose our principles and policy. Tak- 
ing that course, the administration would be so weak, as to be 
compelled to take shelter under one or the other party, and 
would more probably under ours than with the Whigs. In 
fact, I do not see how they can get along, except we should 
confound ourselves with them, by an indiscriminate defense 
of them against the Whigs, of which they in fact constitute a 
part. Every member of the cabinet was a supporter of Har- 
rison, and claims still to be whigs. I fear some of your dele- 
gates, through their connection with prominent political men 
of Pennsyl a , may be somewhat warped in their feelings. I 
hope it may not be so, but time will disclose. The great body 
of the Republican party, so far as I can judge, will stand fast. 
I shall at least, if I should stand alone. I go for a decisive 
victory. It is the only one worth having. If Tyler should 
go with us, I shall give him a hearty support; but if not, I 
shall not hesitate to oppose him with like decision. Neither 
friendship nor enmity shall sway me, where the country and 
its liberty are concerned. . . . 



To James II. Hammond? 

Oban mine Georgia 24 th Sep*. 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I received your letter just about as I was to 
start for this place, which has delayed my answer longer than 
it would otherwise have been. 

It is not improbable, that there may have been a failure 
through the mail in our correspondence last winter. I am 
not certain whether I acknowledged your last letter received, 
but my impression is, that I did; but it is possible, that in the 
midst of my large correspondence your letter may have been 
received and laid aside among the answered by mistake. 

1 Original lent by Mr. Edward Spanii Hammond, of Blackville, S. C. 



490 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Your conception of the State of things at Washington at 
the time of adjournment is correct. Buchanan has no sub- 
stantial popularity out of Pensylvania, and much less there 
in reality, than his appearent popularity would indicate. Van 
Buren had made no headway, nor gained anything by his 
tour, as far as I can learn. My own strength had gained, and 
was gaining, at least so thought my friends, and I saw nothing 
to the contrary. You did right in extending the hospitality 
you did to him, while he was in Columbia. He has no claims 
on the State, and I have no doubt, that his object was political; 
yet it was due to the station which he had occupied, and the 
rank he held, as an individual, in society. As a well bred 
Carolina gentleman, you could not act otherwise. While I say 
this, I must at the same time say, that I would regard "his 
election a^ain to the office he once held, a great misfortune. 
Experience has shown, that he has no administrative talents, 
which will be the one thing needful in the next presidential 
term, and I can hardly mistake from indications, that his 
restoration to power would be followed by converting the 
party, which is now for the most part sound, into a spoils 
party again. I am not certain, that it w^ould not be the worst 
possible result. It would again divide and corrupt the popu- 
lar partv, to be followed, as may be justly feared, by the per- 
manent ascendancy of the Whigs. I can scarcely think that 
Benton would under any circumstance support Clay; yet it 
is well known, that he intended to vote for the Tariff, and was 
probably prevented only by a letter, w T hich one of [the] Vir- 
ginia delegation showed him from M r Ritchie, the morning 
preceeding the vote on the bill. I may also add, that there 
has been for some time a greatly increased intercourse between 
him and the Senators from Kentucky. Should he support 
Clay he would be lost as a publick man. The movement on 
Cass is mere demonstration originating with the Whigs, who 
are anxious to bring forward as many on the opposite side as 
possible, as candidates. His hold on the country is slight. 
Personally and politically his feelings have been kind towards 
me; and it would no doubt be thought a stroke of policy to 
play him off against me. I do not think much can be made of 
Johnson; 1 and it would be dangerous on the part of Van 

i Richard M.Johnson, of Kentucky, Vice-President, 1837-1841. 



LETTEKS OF JOHN C. OALHOUN. 491 

Burens friends to give him Strength. It might embarass him. 
Your remark, that the same men and the same states, that 
passed the Tariff of '28 passed the present, is very true and as 
striking as it is true. The motive of M r Buchanan is easily 
explained. His state is a Tariff state, made so by the iron 
business, and still more by the want of decision on his part. 
He had to yield, or go out of publick life, and to go out in 
Pensylvania is to be finally lost politically. He choosed the 
former. M r Wright's l motives are more difficult to under- 
stand. They were probably more complex. His term expires 
the 4 th March next and whether it will be renewed will depend 
on the complexion of the coming elections in the fall. It is 
probable, that among the motives for his vote was to save 
himself, as it is not improbable, that he would gain more than 
he would lose in the State by his vote, although I do not think 
it certain, from what I learn. Another motive I doubt not 
was to conciliate M r Buchanan and Pensylvania, neither of 
whom was favourable to M r Van Buren or N. York. It can- 
not be doubted he acted in concert with him; and under his 
advise and influence. But be his motives what they may, it 
seems to me certain, that the effect of his vote must be to 
strengthen M r Clay and the Tariff interest. To that extent it 
may be considered as weakening the South and myself, which, 
however, is probably more than balanced by the tendency to 
Union in the South, which it cannot but cause. 

Your view in reference to the course proper for the State 
to take at this juncture is correct. Nullification is the extreme 
remed} r of the Constitution, and ought never to be resorted 
to till all others have been fairly tried and failed. Such was 
the principle that guided me in '28 We delayed action for 
four years, and till the debt was paid, that all other remedies 
might be fairly tried, and only acted after every prospect of 
relief had vanished, and when the alternative was a permanent 
division of the surplus revenue among the States and a per- 
petual Tariff or Nullification. Had I not regarded the rem- 
edy, as the extreme one of the Constitution, I would more 
than two years ago taken my stand on the ground, that the 
alternative was between nullification and the observance of 



i Silas Wright, Senator from New York. 



492 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

the Compromise act. My impression is, if the South will 
act, as it ought, at the coming- Presidential election, we shall 
be able certainly to repeal the act and place the Duties on 
satisfactory grounds. I believe four fifths of the party is 
sound in reference to the Tariff, and that it may easily be 
made a strictly party measure, if we succeed. If we should 
fail, and the finances should not break down the Tariff, no 
alternative will be left, but nullification; but which I do not 
doubt may then be made under circumstances that will settle 
the question forever. 

I am happy to perceive, that you are likely to be elected 
Governor without opposition. My impression is, that you 
ought to take in your Inaugural or Message strong grounds 
against the Tariff; and to denounce it as unconstitutional, 
unjust, unequal, inexpedient, anti Republican and pernicious 
in its effect morally and politically; but at the same time to 
express your confidence that the great popular party of the 
country, whose only safe ground to stand on is strict adher- 
ence to the Constitution and justice and equality between 
citizen and citizen, state and state, and section and section, 
will rise in its might and put it down. It is clear, that the 
party cannot admit of any palpable departure from this, its 
great and fundamental principle, without in the end sucumbing 
to the party, whose great aim is special privileges. It would 
be well, I think, to advert to the circumstances under which 
the bill was passed, and to express a deep regret, that any 
member of the great popular party should have voted, from 
any consideration, in its favour. I rejoice to learn, that your 
marling process has succeeded so well, and that your prospect 
of enriching your place is so good. One successful example 
of the kind will have a most happy effect. 

I am here attending to my mining interest. I have been 
operating on a cheap and safe scale, with a small force. The 
mine has continued to yield well, but nothing like the first 
operation, which could not be expected to continue. I shall 
leave for home in two or three days. 

It is only a few, to whom I write on political subjects, and 
to none have I written more fully than I have to you in this. 
You will have of course [have] regarded it as intended for 
yourself. Let me add in reference to myself. I found the 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 493 

prospect good both in Virginia and N. Carolina. I have no 
doubt, but that in both States I am by far the strongest. My 
friends in the latter State intend to make a movement, I under- 
stand, in my favour during the next session of the Legislature. 
If it should be done either there, or in this State, my impres- 
sion is, that it would be advisable to follow it up in our State. 
The state, I think, ought not to take a course, that would seem 
too forward, or too indifferent. It is a point, I rarely toutch, 
in correspondence, or conversation. Apart from a sense of 
duty, and a desire to do all I can to carry the country and 
especiallv the South through their present difficulties I have 
no desire for the office. 1 



To John Van Buren and others* 

Fort Hill, 29 th Sep* 1841 

GENTLEMEN, The last mail brought me your kind and flat- 
tering invitation of the 17 th Ins 4 , to attend a mass convention 
of the Democracy of the Counties along North River and Long 
Island, to be held at Kingston on the 7 th next month. 

The great distance and the shortness of the notice, will be 
I hope sufficient apology for not attending. 

I am much gratified with the high estimate you place on my 
service in the great cause of American liberty; and nothing, 
I assure you, has given me more pleasure, or done more to 
strengthen my confidence in the success of our cause, than to 
find, in this, the hour of its severest trial, so perfect a har- 
mony among its friends, both as to principles and measures, 
over our wide spread and diversified territory. It was, indeed, 
cheering to behold all, in my section, in this hour of danger, 
when our opponents, flushed with victory in the recent presi- 
dential struggle, rushed forward to raise the fallen standard 
of federalism, simultaniously rally under the banner of the 
old Republican state rights party of '98. When I saw that 
glorious banner waving over our ranks, and the united enthu- 
siasm along the whole line to uphold it, all apprehension for 
the result of the contest vanished.

As numerous and bold and united as were our opponents 
as confident as they were of carrying all their measures at the 
late session, I never doubted, if they did succeed, but that 
the period of their victory would be short. 1 could not believe, 
when the real issue was made, as it was, between the parties, 
and the people were called on to decide between Republicanism 
and Federalism; State Rights and Consolidation; Democracy 
and an artificial moneyed Aristocracy engendered and fostered 
by the Government, that they would not long hesitate. Already 
have events proved that my confidence in their intelligence 
and patriotism was not misplaced. The recent elections have 
shown a mighty change in publick opinion. That change 
will go on, if we but prove ourselves worthy of our cause by 
a rigid adherence to our principles and measures, till our op- 
ponents and their cause shall be completely overwhelmned by 
the swelling tide. 



To James Edward Calhoun. 

Fort Hill 1 st Nov r . 1841 

MY DEAR JAMES, ... I am in correspondence with 
M r King of Augusta, and Co 1 Gadsden on the subject of the 
road, with some hope of obtaining aid through M r M c Queen 
(the agent of the great Steam packet line about to be put into 
operation in England). He was in Washington last winter, 
and I took much pains to impress him with the vast impor- 
tance both to them and us to restore the direct trade between 
them and the Staple states, and, also, that it could not be done 
unless by opening the connection between Charleston and the 
Valley of the Mississippi. He became fully impressed with 
the importance of the subject and the great advantage, which 
Charleston possesses from her situation over the ports to the 
North of her in commanding the trade of the West, at all 
seasons. 

In consequence, I received a letter from him since his return 
to England on the subject, requesting farther information; to 
obtain which I am in correspondence with the Presidents. I 
feel confident, if all the advantages of the route could be fully 
brought out an impression may be made through M r M c Queen 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 495 

on British capitalists, that would do much for it. Their trade 
is deeply interested in it. 

Many of my friends think the time has arrived when my 
name ought to be presented for the next presidency. It is 
my own impression, that, if it is ever intended, now is the time. 
The Whigs are thoroughly defeated, and will dissolve, as a 
party, never to rise again under the same name and form; 
and as there will be no foe to dread,, it will be impossible to 
prevent any longer the agitation of the subject of the next 
presidency. If the sound portion of the party do not move, 
the spoil portion Camp followers will select and elect their 
man, and the fruits of the great victory will be lost. It is 
impossible to prevent that result but by an early and prompt 
move by the sound part on their man, with the fixed resolu- 
tion to stand fast by their principles and their cause. It is 
not improbable if their views should be concured in, but that 
the members of our Legislature may make a nomination 
at their next session. This, however, is for yourself. Per- 
sonally, I feel little, or no solicitude on the subject. If I 
know myself I would not accept the place, if proffered by 
the people, except from a sense of duty. At my time of life 
it has few charms for me; but if it should be thought, that I 
can best restore the constitution and reform the Government, 
I would not shrink from the responsibility. . . . 



To Armistead Burt. 1 

Fort Hill 28 th Nov r 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 regret that your engagements would not 
permit you to make me a visit. I was desirous of conversing 
with you on several subjects before you went to Columbia, on 
which we could exchange ideas more fully and satisfactorily 
than can be done by letter. 

Among other points, I wished to have conversed on the course 
that ought to be taken by the state, in reference to the Dis- 
tribution bill; but the publick sentiment has been so fully and 
satisfactorily expressed on it, that little now need be said. I

do trust, that the state will not only refuse to receive, but 
also to take the least control over the part allotted to it, and 
that an able, short, high toned and decisive report will be made 
on the subject. I trust it will be condemned without a dis- 
senting voice. Such a lead would do much to destroy the 
measure, and add to the character and influence of the state. 

Another subject was the controversy between Virginia and 
New York. 1 It is one in which this and all the Slave holding 
States have the deepest interest. Virginia has taken the true 
course. If she is backed in it, it will bring on an issue, in 
which we must triumph, if she should be backed as she ought 
to be by the other States interested. New York is clearly in 
the wrong and must give away, or be cut off from our com- 
merce, if the ground which Virginia has assumed be carried 
out, which would establish a principle, that will secure us 
against the movements of the abolitionists, now and hereafter. 
It was in anticipation of this state of things, that I made my 
report on the circulation of incendiary publications through 
the mail, which I so shaped, as to meet this case, as far back 
as 1835. I cannot doubt, but the State will back Virginia, 
and I would only suggest the propriety of passing an act in 
exact conformity with her's, Authorizing the Governor to 
put it into operation by proclamation, whenever officially 
notified, that the Act of Virginia has gone into operation, and 
to communicate a copy of the act forthwith to the Executive 
of Virginia. I send you herewith General Bagby's 2 Report 
and Speech on the Subject. He acted in concert with me 
throughout. This howevei , for yourself. 

I also desired to converse fully with you on general poli- 
ticks. The overthrow of the Whigs and of Whiggery itself 
for the present, and under its present name, marks an impor- 
tant epoch in our political History. We now have, for the 
first time, an opportunity for a thorough reformation of the 
Government and the restoration of the Constitution. The 
many and great abuses in the administration of the Govern- 
ment may now be corrected, and federalism and consolidation 
be entirely overthrown, and the old State rights Republican

2 Senator from Alabama, 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 497 

principles and policy established in their place. But, if the 
opportunity be lost, it will be lost forever, I fear; and there 
is no small danger, that it will be. The victory is too com- 
plete and too long in advance. It will be difficult to keep the 
party from discord and confusion, and still more so, to pre- 
vent the unsound portion, who look more to plunder, than 
principle, from controlling the presidential election, and 
turning the fruits of the triumph to their own mercenary 
purpose. There can be no thorough and radical reform, but 
through the executive. If an improper choice be made, all 
will be lost. I perceive that M r Van Huron's friends are dis- 
posed to push him for a reelection. I think, if it should be 
made, it would prove fatal to the cause. I speak from no 
personal feelings, but from a full knowledge and due appre- 
ciation of all the causes in operation. In fact, no Northern 
man ever has been, or ever will be, under existing circum- 
stances, a reformer. His position, and its bearings, in refer- 
ence to the action of the Government, will not permit it. 
Reformation ever has and ever must come from the South, 
and the northern portion of the party must be carried by our 
movements. This cannot be explained in the short space of 
a letter, but such is the fact. 

If my friends should think my service will ever be of 
importance at the head of the Executive, now is the time. It 
has never come before, and will pass away forever, with the 
occasion. I have not the least personal ambition in reference 
to the Subject; but I do feel a deep interest in a system, to 
the sustaining of which, I have devoted thirty years, and in 
the success of which, our safety, liberty and prosperity 
depends. Should my friends look to me, the great point is 
to prevent publick sentiment being forestalled, and this may 
be done, to a great extent, by an extensive correspondence 
among friends, in and out of the State, and through the press, 
that may be favourable. I leave it to them to decide what 
ought to be done, with no personal solicitude on my part. I 
write with entire confidence in your friendship and discretion.

To Nicholson. 1 

Washington 18 th Dec 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I am obliged to you for the information in 
reference to your Senatorial election and very greatly regret, 
that you cannot send us two Republican senators. The} r 
would have strengthened us much in this great contest, which 
is not yet over. It is true, that we have won the victory, but 
experience has taught me, that in politicks, it is much more 
easy to gain the battle, than to reap its fruits. If I do not mis- 
take, this will prove a much more difficult session, than the 
Extra. That required boldness, but this consumate prudence 
and Will, combining energy and moderation. I regret your 
retirement from publick life, and hope it will be temporary; 
and in the mean time wish you every success in your profes- 
sional pursuits and happiness in your domestick circle. 

It will afford me pleasure to comply with your request in 
reference to my speeches and documents. 

I have not been here long enough to venture an opinion as 
to the course of events during the session. I find a holding 
back on all sides; and would say, that the object of the Whigs 
(the Cla} T part) is to force us into the relation of opposers, or 
supporters of Tyler and his administration, so as to give them 
the control. It is our obvious policy, that they shall not suc- 
ceed; and hence the disposition on our part to stand silent and 
fast till they have developed their views. This is the true 
cause of the inaction, which has thus far characterized this 
session on the part of the Republicans. 

As far as I have observed, thejiscality recommended by the 
Message is far from giving satisfaction to our friends, as well 
as the Message generally. It is in many respects a very 
unsound paper; and bears strong marks of the predominant 
influence of M r . Webster in the Cabinet. This however, is 
inter nos. I do not think the President has gained any on the 
confidence of the party, but still there is a disposition to give 
him support, as far as our principles and policy will permit, 
but not an inch beyond. We must look to our permanent

ascendency through them, and not to the divisions, or discord 
of the Whigs. I shall at all times be happy to hear from you. 
Presenting my best respects to M rs Nicholson, . . . 



To Wilson 

Washington 26 th Dec r 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I have delayed answering your letter 2 for a 
few days that 1 might look round and understand more fully 
the actual state of things here. You must have been struck 
with the fact that the session has commenced with great quiet. 
This results from the state of the parties. There are now 
three parties; the Administration party or Tyler party; the 
Whig party proper, or the Clay's; and the Republicans. 
Either would be glad to see the other two in conflict, and they 
to have the right of deciding between them; that is, for it 
would be so in fact, to have the control. But it is the mis- 
fortune of the administration party that they must move; and 
accordingly after delaying as long as it could, the annual 
treasury Report (the budget) and the exchequer scheme have 
both been presented. These in turn must be acted on, which 
must bring out the other two parties; and here we have the 
advantage. We are in a minority in the government and 
have the right of being the reserve, and if we act with pru- 
dence, the two sections of the Whigs will come into conflict, 
as it is understood that the Clay^ wing is deadly opposed to 
the scheme. This will give us the control. There is no 
chance of its passing. W e regard it as in fact a government 
bank, and believe that it would terminate in being a mere 
paper engine as it stands. I find more discretion and harmony 
among the Republican party, than what I anticipated after so 
decisive a victory. There is indeed a good deal of eagerness 
to bring out presidential candidates. M r . Van Buren's friends 
have put out feelers for him, and M r . Buchanan is understood 
to be openly a candidate; but there is no favorable response.

The sense of the party is against agitation at present; and 
more disposed, as far as I can judge, to make principles and 
policy the controlling consideration, and to select the indi- 
vidual that they may believe to be the best calculated to carry 
those of our party successfully out in practice, than I have 
ever before known. It is all we can desire; and our friends 
have accordingly cheerfully acquiesced in what is understood 
to be the general sense. 

I have no reason to be other than satisfied with the prospect 
before us. The South I think will be united, and their union 
cannot fail to control the other and more divided sections. 
Our friends are in good spirits, watchful, prudent and confi- 
dent, and have little fear that the publick sentiment can with 
vigilance be forestalled. That is the point to be guarded; 
and for that purpose nothing can be more efficient than a 
judicious and concerted correspondence. Let every one have 
in mind that now if ever the government must be reformed 
and the Constitution restored. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. 

Washington 31 st Dec r 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . We have not got more than fairly 
under way. In the Senate we are engaged in the discussion 
of the Exchequer Scheme presented by the Executive. It 
fares badly. No side is disposed to take it. The whigs 
assault it, with Tyler and the administration, especially Web- 
ster, with great bitterness. I refer to the Clay wing. Hav- 
ing gained the Victory, we assume a tone of moderation toward 
all sides, especially towards the weaker branch of the Whigs, 
the administration, while we firmly maintain our principles 
and the line of policy we have adopted. I regard the Whigs 
as destroyed. They can never again rise under their present 
name, nor on their present measures. 

Their is but little open, but a good deal of under action on 
the presidential question. The general sense of the Republi- 
can party seems to be adverse to any movement for the present 
in reference to it, and my friends have acquiesced, I think, 
wisely in it. Buchanan is said to be openh 7 in the field in 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 501 

Pennsyl a ; but, as far as I can hear, but with a feeble response 
in the State and none out of it. The move is, in my opinion, 
unfortunate for him. 1 regard it the reverse, as far as 
I am concerned. Van Buren's friends have put out a feeler 
in the Albany Argus. The response has been unfavourable 
even in N. York. My friends are zealous and sanguine, 
though discreet. There appears to be little danger of fore- 
stalling publick sentiment, as I feared when you left me. The 
State of the country is such, as has brought the people to 
reflect, and they are more disposed to select in reference to 
fitness for the office, and less to be lead, than I have ever 
known them to be. On the whole the prospect is fair; even 
more so, than I had anticipated. From present appearance 
the South will be united. I am very pleasantly quartered on 
the Hill, near to Hills, at M r Houston's, with an Alabama 
mess. The board is good, and the mess pleasant. My health 
is good. 

Let me hear from you as often as convenient; and as much 
in detail about the Island and all, as your engagements will 
permit. What have you heard of your property at the East 
end of the Island 4 



To Jame* IT. Hammond. * 

Washington 31 st Dec r 1841 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much gratified, that you have been 
selected, as the Candidate for the next Governor and that 
everything has gone off so well. It is the glory of our own little 
State to act with a sperit of liberality and patriotism unknown 
to the other states. 

The course you prescribe to yourself is wise and patriotick, 
and I have no fear, but that you will so execute it, as to pass 
through your term with honour and popularity. 

We are not more than fairly under way in the Senate. 
The Exchequer scheme is under discussion. You will see by 
the papers, that it fares badly. No side seems disposed to 
support it, at least in its present form. The Clay Whigs are 
very bitterly opposed to it, as well as to Tyler and his admin-

istration, especially Webster. We take a moderate course. 
The battle is over with as. Both wings of the Whigs are 
prostrated. They can never be reconciled, and, if they could, 
can never rise under their present name nor on their present 
measures. All that now remains for us is, to reap the fruits of 
our great victory ; a thing in politicks much more difficult, than 
to beat the enemy, as experience has long since established. 

There is very little open agitation of the presidential ques- 
tion. The sense of the party is decidedly against it; but there 
is not a little under action. My friends are zealous and san- 
guine, though discreet; and, if I may be permitted to speak, 
where I am personally interested, I regard the prospect as 
fair. The state of the country has brought the people to 
reflect, and they appear to me to be much less inclined to be 
lead and more to be governed by the qualifications requisite 
for the office, than I have ever seen them. The South, I think, 
will be united. M r Buchanans friends have made a demon- 
stration in his favour in Pennsylvania, but there has been but 
a feeble response in the State, and none out. The same may 
be said of an attempt in favour of M r Van Buren in N. York. 

As to myself, personally, I take but little interest. If 1 
know myself , I would not accept the office, if profered, apart 
from regard to friends, and duty to the country and the cause 
for which I, and my friends have so long contended. I have 
passed the period, when it was an object of ambition; but 
even in my youthful day, I ever held it subordinate to the 
principles on which I acted. 

The conduct of Great Britain is outrageous, but the Gov- 
ernment is in no condition to make an issue of arms at this 
time. The finances are in a wretched condition, and the Exec- 
utive as feeble as can be. We must get things right at home, 
and begin seriously to prepare. With energy and Wisdom 
on the part of the Executive, the difference might be settled 
without war. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. 

Washington 23 d Jan y 184=2 

MY DEAR Sm, . . . Everything here, connected with 
the session, is in a state of uncertainty, except the defeat of 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 503 

the whigs. They are now endeavouring to harmonize, but it 
matters not. Devided, or united their fate is fixed. The fate 
of the Bankrupt and Distribution acts is still doubtful. The 
loan bill has in a great measure failed; and the Whigs have 
been obliged to ask for an issue of treasury notes. I spoke 
to day at large, 1 and showed that the only remedy to meet the 
demands on the treasury was retrenchment and economy, for 
both of which there is ample scope; and yet, so infatuated is 
the party, that although the treasury is empty and the credit 
of the government down, they cannot be forced to reduce 
expenses. 

The Presidential question begins to be a good deal talked 
about, but still, there appears an indisposition to any open 
demonstration. I think, I wrote you, that Buchanan is openly 
in the field, but he is making no progress. Co 1 Johnson has 
been nominated by his friends in Kentucky, but his case is 
hopeless. The days of heroes are over, and available candi- 
dates too. Van Buren, it seems to be admitted, does not take, 
and my friends are daily become more and more sanguine. 
My own impression is, that events are taking the direction, 
they desire; and that the difficulties of the country, and the 
disorders of the times are turning more and more the eyes of 
the community on me. I regard myself, as a dispationate 
judge; for, personally, I have but little desire for the office. 

I shall be glad to hear from you as often and fully as you 
may have leisure to write. My health remains good. 



To James II. Hammond? 

Washington 4 th Feb 1842 

MY DEAR SIR; Although you are so far from the scene of 
action, your views are so substantially correct on all points, 
that I have nothing to add to your reflections on the Presi- 
dential question. My friends are of the impression, that 
things are doing well in that respect; but M r Pickens, with 
whom I presume you correspond, will give you fuller and 
more detailed account than I can.

I enclose my remarks on the Treasury note bill, in which I 
go into the subject of the estimates and expenditures for the 
year. 1 You will see, that the waste of the publick funds must 
be enormous. I have but little hope, that much can be done 
to correct the abuses at present. My object is to lay a foun- 
dation for correction hereafter, when power shall have passed 
into the hands of the Republican party, and, with that view, 
to have the question of reform, to bear on the coming presi- 
dential Canvass. It is only by giving it a leading influence in 
the Canvass, that a thorough reform can be effected. I would 
be glad, if you have leisure to prepare an article, to have the 
speech published in the Carolinian, accompanied by appro- 
priate remarks, calculated to call publick attention to its 
importance. Our hope to keep down the Tariff depends on 
keeping down the expenditures. The Whig party is effectu- 
ally divided and distracted. Clay's Wing is much the strong- 
est, as yet, but the force of patronage is against him, which 
will probably turn the scales the same way, in the end. His 
and Tyler's friends are exceedingly hostile to each other. 

M r Adams' movement has caused much excitement. 2 It is 
the first open development of abolition towards disunion. I 
have no doubt, that his object is disunion. There has always 
been a portion of the old federal party in favor of it in N. 
England.

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, I have received since your arrival at 
Havannah three letters; one from Patrick, immediately after 
your arrival; one from yourself, about eight or ten days since, 
and one from M r Clemson by yesterday's mail; and I need 
not say to you how happy I am to learn from each, that you 
and the child are well, and that your health and strength are 
both improving. M r Clemson thinks you look as well as ever 
and speaks highly of the good health and appearance of little 
Calhoun.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 505 

I read your letter with great interest, and you must con- 
tinue to give me such graphick and detailed information of 
all that strikes you, whether of the place, the people, or their 
habits or institutions. 

You, of course, hear frequently from home. I received a 
letter day before yesterday from your mother. All are well 
and she is as busy as ever. 1 do not think, she will be able 
to meet you in Charleston, as M r Clemson proposes. I had 
hoped you and M r Clemson would have spent the Summer 
with us. It would have added much to our happiness; but if 
he should determine otherwise, I hope, that you will at least 
make a run up to Pendleton and spend some time before you 
turn your face to the North. It would give your mother and 
family and all so much happiness to see you. 

I have been exceedingly engrossed with my publick duties 
for the last month, which will account for my not writing 
sooner to you; and am still so, and shall be for the next month 
to come. Circumstances have forced me to take a prominent 
stand on all the great questions, that come before the Senate. 
I have spoken at large on the Treasury note bill (of which I 
sent M r Clemson a copy) on the Veto, 1 of which I now enclose 
a copy for him, and recently on M r Clay's resolutions, 2 which 
I have now to prepare for the press. 

The Speech on the veto has been received with almost uni- 
versal approbation; and has had a wider circulation, than any 
speech for a long time. It is said that nearly 46,000 copies 
were circulated from here. This will surprise you, when you 
read it, for it comes up almost to nullification. It is in fact 
but the premises, from which it irresistibly follows. 

My speech on M r Clay's resolutions, took also well. Many 
of my friends think it the most effective I ever delivered. It 
was, for me, unusually long. I was two hours and a half in 
the delivery. I will send M r Clemson a copy as soon as it 
appears, and at the same time answer his letter. 

In the midest of my labours, I still continue to enjoy good 
health, but not without slight colds occasionally. I take good 
care of myself; exercise regularly when I can, and rarely go 
out in the evening.

I will postpone the chapter on politicks till I write to M r 
Clemson. 

Washington has been, I am told, rather gay during the 
Season. We had Lord Morpeth 1 for a while, who made some 
Stir. He is a quiet, gentlemanly man. He brought me 
letters, but I did not see much of him; nor did I desire, as he 
had so little feeling of propriety as to attend an abolition 
meeting in Boston, as it is said, and to express himself kindly 
of them and their movement. 

You must not expect as long letters from me, as I hope to 
receive from you. If you saw how many I had to answer you 
would almost pity me. Give my love to M r Clemson. Kiss 
Calhoun for his grandfather. 

P. S. I omitted to mention M r Dickens and his Lady. 2 
He brought me letters and I saw a good deal of both of them. 
He is rather good looking; but not strikingly so; young, fair 
complexion and a pleasant countenance, with easy simple 
manners. Not very marked for anything, that I could see, 
but nothing in the slightest degree offensive. He was very 
politely and civilly received, but with nothing of the rediculous 
parade of Boston and N. York. His Lady is quite homely 
and somewhat countrified in her manners, but I would say 
amiable and sensible, of which I think she gave proof by con- 
tinuing at her needle all the time, when I visited them in the 
morning, except when she took part in the conversation.

Washington 2 d April 1842 

DEAR SIR, I have read your letter with interest, and am 
disposed to concur in most of the views you have expressed, 
as to the designs of England. It is surprising to me, that the 
State[s]men of the Continent do not see, that the policy of 
England is to get control of the commerce of the world, by 
controlling the labour, which produces the articles by which it 
is principally put in motion. Humanity is but the flimsy

pretex too flimsy, one would suppose, to deceive any but 
the most shallow and inexperienced at this late day. The 
United States are the principal obstacle in the way of accom- 
plishing this great scheme of ambition, and hence the hostility 
towards her. 

My engagements are such, that it is not possible for me to 
prepare the Review you request of the Tariff question and 
the points adjusted by the Nullification controversy ; but I 
enclose two speeches, lately delivered, which have a bearing 
on the subject of your request and contain part of the infor- 
mation desired. 

On the question of War, or peace, all I can say is, if Eng- 
land in reality desires peace, there is no danger of War. 
There is a good deal of feeling of resentment at the outrages 
perpetrated on the rights and honor of the country; but still 
the deep pervailing feeling is for peace, if it can be preserved 
on fair terms. Of this I partake, and the more so, as I regard 
the period as un propitious for the assertion of our rights. 
The Administration is exceedingly feeble in both Houses and 
not less so in the Community. M r Clay has succeeded in 
keeping the great bod} T of the Whig party together, and ral- 
lied under his banner; and M r Tyler has not succeeded in 
conciliating his old friends, though they give him their sup- 
port, whenever they can consistently with their principles 
and policy. The finances are in a wretched condition, caused 
almost exclusively by the fixed determination of the North- 
ern Whigs, supported by M r Clay, to force on the country a 
high protective Tariff. Hence the withdrawal of the revenue 
from the land from the common treasury and the refusal to 
restore it, even with bankruptcy staring the government in 
the face; hence the effort to keep up the expenditures of the 
government at the highest point and to increase the debt, and 
hence all that confusion and disorder, which has delayed or 
prevented Congress from promptly adopting efficient remedy 
for the restoration of credit and putting the finances on a solid 
foundation. I did not suppose it was possible for any party 
to act with such perfect folly or on motives so purely selfish. 

It remains to be seen, what effect the withdrawal of M r 
Clay from the Senate may have. I anticipate that it will 
remove much of the difficulties which have impeded the prog- 



508 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ress of legislation; but still I fear, that the policy of high 
protective duties will prevail for the present, to the ruin of 
our reviving Commerce, the embarrassment of the country 
and alienation of those, whose friendship we ought at this 
time to propitiate. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 3 d April 1842. 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote Anna some time since and requested 
her to inform you, that I had received your letter of the 6 th 
March and would answer it in a short time. Since then, I 
have been much occupied with my publick duties and corre- 
spondence connected therewith, to which the delay of the ful- 
filment of my promise of answering your letter is to be 
attributed. I enclosed my letter to Anna in a package con- 
taining a letter to Patrick and my speech on the veto power 
to you. I hope, that the package has been received, and that 
it arrived before Patrick left. I am anxious that he should 
receive my letters. My remarks on the veto has had an unpre- 
cedented success. It has been well received by all parties; 
and has I think put an end to the question. Clay has left the 
Senate and prudently declined to put his anti Veto resolution 
to vote, and to call up two other connected resolutions to 
amend the Constitution. 

I now enclose another speech on a series of resolutions, 
which he introduced as his farewell move; the object of which 
mainly was to put up the flag of the protective system anew. 
It has also been well received and arrangement has been made 
to circulate a very large edition. * 

We are getting along very slowly and not well. The Admin- 
istration is very weak. It has not one open advocate in the 
Senate; and not more than 4 or 5 in the House. It is unsteady, 
without fixed purpose of any kind, except to create a third 
party and without sagacity. Webster is regarded as the con- 
trolling sperit, and he has become almost universally odious. 
There is no confidence in him. His integrity is questioned 
by almost all of any party. Owing to these causes, Clay has 

i Works, IV, 100-140. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 509 

been able to detach the almost entire body of the whigs from 
the administration, while they have failed to make any impres- 
sion on the Republican ranks. We support them whenever 
we can consistently with our principle and policy, but are 
often compelled to oppose their measures. 

To this weakness of the administration much of the diffi- 
culty of getting along is to be attributed; but it is not the 
only cause. The Clay wing of the whigs, or at least the 
northern portion, are intent on restoring the protective policy 
in its full vigour; but they dare not openly assume the ground 
of laying duties for protection. To create a pretex for laying 
high duties for revenue, the income from the publick lands 
has been surrendered to the States; and every effort made to 
keep up the waste and extravagance of the Government to 
the highest point, even beyond that of the period of a large 
surplus, which the Government knew not how to expend. So 
intent are they on this object, that they are ready to sacrifice 
the credit and honor of the Government to accomplish it, 
and, if it should be necessary, to effect their object, its very 
existence. It is to be hoped, that the withdrawal of M r Clay 
from the Senate will weaken this portion of his party to such 
a degree, as to destroy their predominant influence, so that 
we may get clear of the Distribution bill and bring the ex- 
penditure of the Government into some reasonable limits. 
That done, its credit may be easily restored, and its finances 
placed on a safe foundation. If that should not be done, it 
is hard to say, what may not happen. Should their scheme 
be carried out, the credit of the General Government will 
ere long be as bad as that of some of the States, which have 
refused to provide for the interest on their Debt. 

As to the Presidency, my friends think, that things are 
going on well. It seems now to be admitted, that M r Van 
Buren is the only one that can stand in my way, and the im- 
pression is strong that he is making no headway, while I am 
constantly gaining. The movement in Mississippi, to which 
you allude, proved to be a small affair and has turned out to 
be an entire abortion. It is said that every Republican paper 
in the State is in my favour, except perhaps one, and that 
doubtful. Both of the members of the House of Representa- 



510 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION". 

lives are warmly my friends; and it is said that Walker 1 is 
also in my favour, though he has not yet openly avowed 
his preference. He is decidedly against M r Van Buren. He 
(M r V) has little strength in either the Senate or the House, 
while, on the contrary, it is believed that there is a decided 
majority of the party in Congress for me. He is now on a 
visit to General Jackson, no doubt with the intention of 
bringing him out in his support but many think, it will be 
more injurious than beneficial to him should he succeed. On 
the propriety of making an open move my friends are some- 
what devided. The great body is against it, and think that 
well enough ought to be let alone, and such is the inclination 
of my opinion. Every reason would be on that side, if there 
be no danger of forestalling publick opinion. As yet there 
would seem to be none. The difficult and critical State of the 
country is probably against forestalling. The people are 
brought to a pause and seem disposed to look around. The 
more that is the case, the more is it in my favour. The 
present is but illustrating the truth of my past course. 

In the meantime, my friends are far from being idle. Much 
is doing by correspondence and conversation, and by giving 
me a wide hearing. They are very sanguine; and take much 
more interest in my success than what I do. 

Tell Anna I got her letter of the 20 th March yesterday and 
that I shall answer it shortly. I am happy to hear from you 
and herself, that her health is so completely restored, and 
that Calhoun is growing so finely. He must really be a fine 
boy from what both of you say, after allowing for the par- 
tiality of parents. . . . 

Give my love to Anna and kiss Calhoun for his grandfather.

Washington 3 d April 

MY DEAR ANDREW, ... I sent you some time since my 

speech on the Veto. It has had an unprecedented run, and 

been more universally well received, than any I ever delivered. 

That speaks well, for it is but the premises from which State

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 511 

interposition is but the conclusion. At no prior period would 
it have had such a reception. 

I now enclose my speech on M r Clay's series of resolutions. 
It was intended for his farewell measure, and to run up the 
flag of the protective policy again. Our friends intend to 
circulate a very large edition. It is needed at this time. 

Your remarks on the origin of the present pressure are 
perfectly just, as are also your reflections on the danger to 
which it exposes us, and the consequences to which a false 
step would now lead. There is, indeed, a good deal of danger 
in our present position. The administration is very weak. 
It has litterally almost no friends in either House; it is weak, 
unfixed in its purpose, except to get up a third party a Tyler 
party, to which all its measures lead, but with little sagacity 
or foresight. The result is, that Clay has been able to detach 
from them almost all the Whigs, and those that remain are 
mercenary office seekers for the most part, while they have 
not secured the confidence of the Republican party. We sup- 
port their measures, whenever we can, consistently with our 
principles, but have often to oppose them. 

If in addition to this condition of the administration, you 
take into consideration the object and policy of the Clay 
Whigs, which still constitute a majority in both Houses, you 
will not be surprised, that business should get along so badly. 
The great object with them to which all else bends, is to get 
up another protective Tariff. They dare not go directly for 
protection, and to effect their object, they resort to every 
means to raise the expenditures and to cut off the revenue. 
Hence the surrender of the income from the land; hence 
their zeal for a debt, and hence the absence of all efforts to 
retrench the expenditures. So intent are they, that they see 
with indifference the loss of publick credit, and I believe, if 
Ihe existence of the Government should depend on it, they 
would hold on to the distribution bill, rather than to increase 
the revenue by the addition of that branch of the customs. 
I never before witnessed such pure selfishness in any party. 

It is to be hoped that the withdrawal of M r Clay from the 
Senate will deprive the northern tariff wing of his party of 
their present preponderance. If it should, and the publick 
lands be restored, and proper retrenchments be made, publick 



512 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

credit may speedily be restored, and the finances placed on a 
safe foundation; but if that be not done, it is hard to say, 
what may not come. 

There is no doubt, that M r Van Buren is on an electioneer- 
ing tour and that his object is to get Gen 1 Jackson to endorse 
his pretensions. Thus far, he has made no headway with the 
publick. He is obviously losing ground. It remains to be 
seen, whether Gen 1 Jackson can change the current. I think 
not. I judge from the efforts already made and the state of 
our publick affairs. The people are brought to a pause and 
are looking around, to understand the cause, which has lead 
to the present state of things. The more they reflect, the bet- 
ter for me. The existing state of things, but illustrates the 
truth of my principles and course. My friends are sanguine. 
It is acknowledged, that I am by far the strongest in Con- 
gress. My friends think I have a decided majority of the 
party in Congress. I have with me the whole Republican 
members from the South and South West with few exceptions. 
I have all in Mississippi, in Louisiana in Georgia and Ala- 
bama except King, who is inclined to Buchanan, Bagby who 
is to Benton and Shields, who keeps silent. l The rest of your 
members are mainly for me. Besides the South, I have a 
large support in the other sections of the delegation in Con- 
gress. 

Most of my friends think that our true policy is to make 
no publick demonstration yet; that it is best to let well enough 
alone. I am inclined to the same opinion. It is certainly the 
wise course, if there be no danger of forestalling publick 
opinion by others of which I see none at present. 

My friends are sanguine and by no means idle. They take 
a far deeper interest in my election than what I do. I regard 
the high office in the light of heavy, onerous duties, which at 
my time of life, nothing could induce me to assume, but a 
deep attachment to our country and our institutions. . . .

To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 22 d April 1842 

MY DEAR ANNA, I read with much interest your letter of 
the 20 th March You need never apprehend, that your letters 
will fatigue me. I take too much interest in you and all that 
concerns you, in addition to the good sense and intrinsick 
merits of your letters, ever to feel weary in reading them. 

The entire restoration of your health, with the continued 
good health of M r Clemson and little Calhoun is a source of 
thankful joy to me. Health is one of the principal sources 
of happiness, and may the blessing of a kind Providence 
long continue it to you all. My own health, with the excep- 
tion of occasional colds, has been good during the whole Ses- 
sion. I heard from home day before yesterday. All were 
well with the exception of colds and sore throat which have 
been very common throughout the country during the Win- 
ter and Spring thus far. I had at the same time a letter from 
Andrew and Patrick. Andrew and family were well. Pat- 
rick was at N. Orleans, and expected to take his passage to 
his post, the next day after he wrote. f . 

As it is quite uncertain whether this letter will reach you 
before you will leave Cuba, I will not make it a long one. 

Congress is progressing slowly, but very quietly excepting 
an occasional outbreak from that mischievous bad old man, 
J. Q. Adams. It is understood, that the negotiation has 
opened between Lord Ashburton and the State Department. 
My impression is that a treaty will be the result and 1 hope 
on satisfactory terms. I have seen a good deal of his Lord- 
ship. 1 He is a plain, sensible man, and well disposed. 1 
doubt not, that he is anxious to close the difference between 
the two countries. The late news from Cabool is I think 
highly favourable, as far as the negotiation is concerned. His 
Lordship [has] his first dinner tomorrow, and I am one of the 
invited. 

The Presidential question begins to be more agitated. My 
friends are sanguine and think my strength increases daily. 
There is no doubt I am much the strongest in Congress.

Washington 10 th July 1842 
MY DEAK SIR, . . . Things are in great confusion 

here. The Big Tariff bill, as it is called, is before the House. 

It will pass and be vetoed, and then confusion will be worse 

confounded with the Whigs. They are a doomed party. 
My friends continue sanguine; and my own impression is, 

that my prospects improve. . . . 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 3 d August 1842 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . We are engaged in the Senate on 
the Tariff. 1 expect to speak at large tomorrow or next day 
on the passage of the bill. It will pass without amendment, 
and, I suppose, without doubt be vetoed, when it is probable 
another bill will be ran through for revenue, so formed as to 
escape the veto. The time of adjournment is still uncertain; 
though I think it will be about the 20 th Inst. 

My friends are in high sperits. They think my prospect 
fair and daily improving. I had a letter from Anna a few 
days since. I presume she is with you; and if so give my 
love to her and a kiss to Calhoun for his grandfather.

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letter, written since 
your return from Fort Hill and regret to learn, that the indi- 
cations are less favourable. I hope, however, that it may 
have improved in the vein to the North East and that we may 
find profitable operation there, at least for some time. Gold 
is now so valuable, that it is worth while to seek it, if but 
small quantities be found. 1 have such entire confidence in 
your judgement, that I will not pretend to offer % even a sug- 
gestion, as to the best manner of employing your force till I 
can be out, when we can make it a matter of consultation 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 515 

I hope it will not now be long. We have not yet fixed on the 
day of adjournment, hut from present appearance, the pros- 
pect is, that we shall adjourn in the course of a week, and 
then without furnishing the means of carrying on the Gov- 
ernment. The Whigs are now devided into two parties; one 
prefering the Distribution to the Tariff, and the other the 
Tariff to the Distribution; and neither willing to join in a 
bill simply for revenue with us. They seem to have lost all 
patriotism and discretion. 

We ratified the treaty yesterday, 1 which will give us time 
and leisure to settle our domestick troubles, without any from 
abroad; a thing most desirable. I am so overwhelmed by 
business, that I have not time to give you the news here. 
My friends are very sanguine. 

I enclose my speech on the Tariff; 2 and Patrick's last letter, 
which you and Anna will be, I am sure happy to read, as I 
suppose you. have not heard from him, as late. . . .

DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 2 d inst 4 has been received in 
the midst of the bustle and confusion incident to the termina- 
tion of a session, and I have but a few spare moments left to 
acknowledge it. 

I do not doubt, that you feel a deep interest in my success. 
There was no foundation for the rumor of my going into M r 
Tyler's Cabinet. I have given him a fair support, whenever I 
could, but without the least understanding between us. 

1 have made no change in any opinion 1 have expressed 
within a few years on the Subject of the currency. It is a 
subject of great delicacy to touch and must abide time and 
opportunity. 

I have not received the pamphlet to which you refer.

desire, and in carrying it successfully into effect. The revival 
of credit, on a sound basis, is highly desirable. I would have 
been very glad to see you before I went South. 

I enclose a copy of my speech on the Tariff bill, that was 
vetoed. l You will see my remarks on the one that has become 
a law in the Globe of yesterday. 2 The vote of Wright and 
others of the party on it is destined to have a great effect on 
political relations of prominent men. It prostrates M r Van 
Buren in the South. The whole is much like what occurred 
in 1828. 

My friends are active and sanguine. I shall be glad to hear 
from you. 



To R. M. T. Hunter* 

Fort Hill 26 th Oct r , 1842 

MY DEAR SIR, I write more to say that I have just received 
your letter of the 14 th , than because I have anything impor- 
tant to communicate. From every quarter, I get favourable 
information; and the only fear expressed is as to the Conven- 
tion. It is a point that will need guarding; and among the 
first precautions, it seems to me, to be taken is, that where 
nominations are made by our friends, either in local meet- 
ings, or by the State, they ought not to be made subject to 
the decision of a convention, specifically , but to abide by any 
fair expression of the opinion of the Republican or Demo- 
cratic, party. No one who intends fairly, can object to such 
a course; while it would give us ground to stand on in resist- 
ing an} r attempt through a convention to impose a candidate 
on the country by management, or against the will of the 
party. The next is to postpone the meeting of a Convention 
as long as possible. It ought not to take place before next 
summev 12 months, in order that public opinion should be 
brough to bear on it as strongly as possible. I would also 
suggest, whether it would not be advisable for the Republi- 
can members at the next session or the succeeding, to meet

and express its [their] opinion, as to the proper time and 
place for holding the Convention, and the manner [in which] 
it ought to be organized. Finally our friends ought to fix 
among themselves the rules that ought to be established when 
it meets to bring out the true sense of the party, so that if 
there should be any attempt to defeat that sense, they may be 
prepared to oppose it in concert. It is not impossible, if it 
be delayed, that the publick voice may supersede its meeting 
altogether. I am glad to hear, that the indications are so 
favourable in Virginia. If she goes right, there is no danger. 
I see Ritchie intimates the call of a State Convention. If one 
should be, you must be on the alert. I shall write forthwith 
to Elmore and Rhett, who is to be in Charleston, in reference 
to some suggestions in regard to Woodbory and \}iame 
illegible}. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 27 th Oct r 1842 

DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 16 th of Sep r . , accompanied 
by your letters to the Times, which are well calculated to give 
the British publick a more correct conception of the character 
of our political system, than is usually entertained on that 
side of the Atlantick. Your conversation with Lord Aber- 
deen and other functionaries of the Government is interest- 
ing, and I hope may contribute to placing the commercial 
relations of the two countries on a better footing. England 
has reached a point where she is compelled to act on the prin- 
ciple of free trade or resort to violent measures to obtain a 
monopoly of the trade of the world. But you have done me 
much injustice in supposing, that I overlooked in my remarks 
on the Tariff, that Commerce is reciprocal; that if we do not 
buy, we can not sell. It is one of my maine points, in show- 
ing how the Tariff destroys our Export trade, which you 
must have overlooked in a hasty perusal. I laid down the 
broad proposition, that imports and exports are reciprocal, 
and mutually limit one another; that we cannot export in the 
long run more than we import, and vice versa a proposition, 
which I think has never been fully realized. 

i Original lent by Mr. Robert P. Maynard, of Tacoma. Wash. 



AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I have never changed any of the views I expressed on the 
currency, and to which you allude. It would have been wise 
in '37 to have used the credit of the government, as I sug- 
gested, to ease off the pressure. It would have contributed 
to break the fall; but what would have been wise then, would 
not be now. Prescriptions in the case of political disease 
must be governed by the State of the Disease, just as in cases 
of phisical. The dose that might cure in the first stages, 
may kill in the last. We have now reached the bottom. The 
currency cannot be farther contracted; nor in my opinion can 
it be expanded, at present, by any expedients. The Tariff 
itself is the most powerful of all expedients to produce an 
expansion in our country. " Its first effect is expansion in one 
section, and contraction in the other, and finally a general, 
but morbid expansion; but so adverse is the period to expan- 
sion, that I doubt, whether the present, as onerous as it is, 
will have in that respect much effect. Look at England at this 
moment. With all her resources she cannot, and if she could, 
she dare not expand her currency. To do so, would be to 
sacrifice her export trade, and with it her manufactures. The 
least expansion, on our part, would be followed by deprecia- 
tion; I mean expansion caused by the issue of paper; unless, 
indeed, the paper should be such, that its quantity would be 
regulated, by the quantity of specie, like that of the old 
deposite bank of Holland. 

If then by the benefit of a cheap currency, you mean the 
benefit of an expanded one, in my opinion, it cannot be had 
at present (unless the Tariff should give it) short of deprecia- 
tion; but if you mean, the substitute of the Government credit 
in the management of its finances, and that in such form, that 
it shall follow the same laws with specie itself in its increase 
and decrease, as I suggested in '37, I have no idea, that such 
a currency could get support at present, and, if it could, I 
doubt whether it is the proper time for its introduction. Time 
and circumstances must govern in all the practical affairs of 
life, and it is emphatically the case as to currency. 

I infer, that you think, the creation of a debt, and the addi- 
tion of paper to circulation are in fact the creation of capital. 
I cannot think so. It may stimulate for a time like capital, 
but the depression in the end must follow. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 519 

I have on former occasions, expressed my opinion, in refer- 
ence to your suggestions, as far as they relate to Post roads. 

As to the Presidency, I regard the office wholly in the light 
of its duties. If the country should think 1 can best discharge 
them, it should have my best efforts, honestly and faithfully 
to discharge its high duties. I have neither pride, nor ambi- 
tion to gratify. If you should think with me, I would be 
glad to have you act with me, as old friend; but if not, I can- 
not expect it, but will regret it. 



To Janies H. Hammo7id. 1 

Fort Hill 27 th Nov 1842 

My DEAR SIR, I have by the mail, that takes this, .trans- 
mitted my resignation to the two Houses, to take effect at the 
close of the present Congress, the 4 th March next. 2 

It was a matter of consultation among some of my confi- 
dential friends at Washington, before I left at the end of the 
last Session. All agreed, that I ought to retire from the Senate 
at some period prior to the Presidential election; and most of 
them thought, I ought not to return to the coming session. 
After full reflection, I determined to take the course I have 
adopted, and in answer to a letter of M r Boyce, on the Subject, 
I have stated the views, that have controlled me briefly. I 
have authorized him to show it to such friends as he may have 
perfect confidence in, and have named you particularly. I 
wish you to see the letter. 

It is my impression, that under all circumstances, it is the 
course least objectionable, and I hope, that you and other 
friends, will approve of it. Much will depend on the notice, 
that the Carolinian and the Mercury may take of it; and I 
must ask your attention to the former of these papers. 

I have for the last 16 or 17 years had no other object in 
view, but to restore the old state rights Republican doctrines 
of '98, and have acted under the solemn belief, that on their 
restoration, the existence of our free popular institutions de- 
pended. With the view to their restoration, I placed myself

2 Resignation from the U. S. Senate. 



520 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

in opposition to Adams and Clay, after the latter had elected 
the former President, and carrying with him N. England in 
support of M r Clay's American system. The first step in the 
restoration was to overthrow that system, and for that pur- 
pose, it was necessary to expel them from power. With those 
views, I supported Gen 1 Jackson, and after he was elected, 
seperated from him from the same motives when I found, that 
he took a stand in reference to the high protective Tariff, and 
some other subjects, that would defeat the object I had in view, 
and threw myself on the State, in support of the doctrines, 
for which I contended. With the same view, after nullifica- 
tion and the compromise act had settled the Tariff controversy 
by a full surrender on the part of Clay and his friends, of the 
protective principle, I used the Whigs to bring down the 
power and influence of the Executive, and force back the party 
in power to the old doctrines, which they professed, but had 
almost entirely departed from in practice. That done, and 
when M r Van Buren and his administration fell prostrate in 
1837, and the Whigs rushed forward to seize the reins of 
Gov*. and reestablish their old system, I interposed to pre- 
vent it, and sustained the administration at its utmost need. 
After their fall, in spite of my aid, pursuing the same object 
which had so long governed me, I joined my old friends, from 
whom I had seperated, and led on the contest the second time, 
for the expulsion of the Whigs, that is the federalists from 
power. The recent elections amply prove, that the work has 
been effectually done. 

What I want to say is, that in this long, laborious, and peril- 
ous course, I have been actuated and sustained solely by a 
sense of duty. I have looked to nothing beyond. I have been 
anxious for relaxation and repose to refresh myself and attend 
a little to my domestick and private affairs, after a tour of 
more than 31 years in the service of the Union; but I stood 
fast at my post, and cheerfully sacrificed all to effect the great 
object I had in view. As far as Congress is concerned, that 
is substantially effected. The Great Democratick Republican 
party will come in by an overwhelming majority, and what is 
of vastly more importance, united, I may say almost unani- 
mously, on the old doctrines and policy of the party, saving 
only on the question of the protective policy ; but I am happy 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 521 

to add that even on that, the most vital of all questions, a vast 
majority of the party is perfectly sound. 

What now remains to be done is, a thorough reform in the 
administrative Departments of the Gov*; unless, indeed, a 
considerable portion should prove recreant in reference to the 
Tariff, which I cannot believe, and which they cannot do with- 
out abandoning the principles of the party and adopting those 
of its opponents. There is much very much to do, to reform 
the administrative Departments. It will prove to be a difficult 
task, requiring vast labor great firmness and no little sagacity. 
I feel assured, the expenditures may be .reduced millions, 
without impairing the efficiency of the Government, but the 
work will require the hearty cooperation of the Executive and 
Legislative Departments of the Gov*. , the former taking the 
lead; and even then, it will require 3 r ears to effect it. Con- 
gress can do little of itself. It must be the great work of the 
next administration; and unless it is thoroughly done, all will 
be lost. If I can be of any future service to the country it 
will be in carrying through this great reform, and elevating 
the moral and political tone of the country, and establishing 
firmly the victory, which has already been achieved; and these 
can only be effected by wielding the power and influence of 
the Executive Department. My Congressional task, in short 
is done. I can do little more there, after this session; and it 
rests with the people to say, whether I shall be selected to 
finish the work, which has been carried forward to where it 
now is. 

I have given you this hasty sketch, in hope, that you would 
have time to prepare a short notice for the Carolinian to accom- 
pany the publication of my letter of resignation. It will be 
sufficient to say, that it is well known to the friends and con- 
stituents of M r Calhoun, that his great object for the last 16 
or 17 years has been the restoration of the old state rights 
Republican doctrines of '98; that he has devoted the last 12 
years exclusively to it, and has remained at his post purely 
from a sense of duty, without any personal motives whatever. 
That it was for that, he seperated from his old friends, while 
they were in power and at the moment of their greatest 
strength; that the same motives brought him to their rescue, 
when most depressed, and when defeated, to take the lead in 



522 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

expelling the enemy from the citidel; and now that the late 
elections have shown, that the work is effectively done, he 
seeks the repose and relaxation, which it is known to his 
friends he has long desired, and to which he is so fairly enti- 
tled after more than thirty years uninterrupted and faithful 
and laborious service in the cause of the Union. That it now 
remains for the people of the United States to determine, how 
long he shall continue in retirement. What now remains to 
make the great victory complete and its fruits durable, is the 
entire abandonment of the protective policy, the placing of 
the duties on impost on a fair revenue principle, and at such 
rates as the legitimate and economical wants of the Gov*. may 
require; to reform the administrative branches of the Gov*. 
by thoroughly correcting the thousand abuses, which have 
crept in; and to carry out in good faith, the great principles, 
which the party has so nobly maintained against those in power 
for the last 2 years. That these great objects can only be 
effected through the executive Dep*. and will require great 
abilities, skill, experience, firmness, patriotism and devotion 
to the cause. These are the great qualities, which the next 
Chief Magistrate ought to possess in the highest degree, and 
without which, it may justly be feared that the fruits of the 
great Victory, which has been achieved, will be lost. It is for 
the people to say who it is. that has them in the highest degree. 
I throw out this, as a sort of outline. No one can fill it up 
with more skill and tack than yourself. 

I do not think I ought to go through Columbia at present. 
If I had concluded to take it in my route, it would [have] 
afforded me great pleasure to accept your kind invitation.

Washington 23 d Jan y 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 18 th Dec r . has remained 
unacknowledged till this time, in consequence of the numer- 
ous engagements, which claimed my attention and which have, 
in a great measure, suspended my private correspondence. 

I have no doubt, but that your explanation of the causes, 
which governed the late Senatorial election and influenced

others is the true one. 1 hope, that the state of feelings, it 
has caused, will not lead to any permanent division or distrac- 
tion in the State. Our union and harmony are essential to 
our respectability and influence as a member of the Union, 
and ought not to be put to hazard or exposed to danger, unless 
some great object is to be gained. 

I fear our Representatives will be very inexperienced in the 
next Congress. Pickens and Rhett are by far the most experi- 
enced and efficient members of the delegation in the present 
Congress. The former unfortunately retires at this critical 
moment, and it is to be regretted, that the other is opposed 
in his District. 1 hope he is in no danger. I would regard 
his defeat as a great misfortune at the present time. Trotti 
appears to be an amiable and worthy young man; but he is 
without experience and if Rhett should be defeated, we would 
have no man in the delegation at once efficient and experi- 
enced. 1 You know that I have made it a rule not to interfere 
in elections in the State, unless occasionally to preserve har- 
mony among our friends; but I regard the present instance 
as an exception, so far as to write to yourself and one or two 
other friends, in whom 1 can fully confide. There is so much 
at stake, that I feel justified. You have great influence in 
the District and can do much in a silent way, and I do hope, if 
you should think with me, that you will exercise it as far as 
it can be done with strict propriety and prudence. I feel 
assured in so doing under existing circumstances you will 
render essential service to the country and our cause at this 
critical period. 

My friends are sanguine. It seems almost certain that M r 
Van Buren cannot be elected. It is generally thought he 
would be defeated, even if he should get the nomination. 

I am veiy glad to learn, that we have appointed M r Ruffin 
on the Geological Survey of the State and that he has accepted. 
I anticipate much benefit to our agriculture from the appoint- 
ment. 

M r M c Duffie has the floor to morrow on the Oregon ques- 
tion. Much expectation will be excited. I hope he will 
sustain himself well. His health has visibly improved since 
his arrival.

MY DEAR ANNA, . . . You must not, my dear daughter, 
think, that I have neglected you in not having written to you 
sooner. Never have I been so interrupted by company since 
I have been in publick life. I have scarcely time left to 
attend to my ordinary official duties. I had determined to 
set apart a portion of yesterday and the day before to write 
you; but both days were so engrossed to a late hour, (after 
making up the mail) that I was prevented. It snowed last 
night and is raining today, which prevents visiting, and which 
gives me some leisure, which I gladly appropriate to writing 
to you, although I have had my speech on the Oregon ques- 
tion on hand nearly for a week, without making much 
progress. 1 If I am as much interupted this week, it will 
take me into another to complete it. 

The Biographical Sketch and the Volume of speeches are 
in the hands of the Harpers in N. York. The former, 2 I 
expect will be delivered this week, and the latter during the 
month. 3 M r Hunter has rewritten most of the latter [former ?] ; 
so much so as fairly to be entitled to the authorship. I am to 
have an hundred copies of both, and will transmit to you and 
M r Clemson one of each, so soon as received. . . .

MY DEAR SIR, . . . Politicks and political parties are 
becoming more and more confused. The Whig party still 
remains devided and bitterly opposed to each other. M r Tyler 
is striving to build up a party; but I think with little success; 
and in the meantime strong marks of division begins to indi- 
cate themselves in* the ranks of the Democratick party, espe- 
cially in reference to a Convention. M r Van Buren and his 
friends are desirous of an early day, and to choose Delegates 
in the old way, by State Conventions; while my friends arc

decidedly in favour of a late day; not sooner than the 1 st May 
'44, and to choose delegates by the people. I enclose a pam- 
phlet written by Rhett 1 which will show the ground we assume. 
It would be well to have it published in the Messenger, with 
proper remarks. It has here a wide circulation. If 1113^ friends 
should remain firm, as 1 doubt not they will, M r Van Buren's 
will be brought to our ground.

Senate Chamber 28 th Feb 1843 

MY DEAR SIR ... I transmitted to you by the mail a 
Sketch of my publick life, prepared by some of my friends 
here, which I hope you have received. 

My friends think the prospect is good. They are sanguine 
as to my success. I expect to leave this on the 4 th and will 
take the Charleston route. James will return with me and 
John will go to the Virginia University. They have both 
grown much, and are much improved. They are now at Bal- 
timore on a visit. 

As to the future prospect of the country, I am of the 
impression, that the present oppressive Tariff must fall and 
that shortly. If nothing else, the deep inroad it has made on 
the income from the impost, will overthrow it. If it was out 
of the way, things would soon come right, with a little fore- 
sight and wisdom on the part of the Government, and we 
should soon have prosperous times. 

I hope you and Maria will be able to make us a visit during 
the summer. Give mv love to her ana believe me to be.

1 arrived day before yesterday, which will explain why I have 
not answered it before. 

I presume Judge Upshur has already decided, 1 so that it 
would be useless to write to him on the subject, to which your 
letter refers. I hope that his decision has been such as you 
desire, and in which I concur. I had a conversation with him 
a few days before I left Washington, in which the subject of a 
possible vacancy in the State Department was adverted to, and 
in which I stated to him in that event, if the office was ten- 
dered to him, I was of the impression he ought to accept. It 
would give him a commanding position, in which he might 
exert a very salutary influence over the important questions 
that are like to grow out of our foreign relations the next 
few years. 

I am glad to learn, that your prospect is so good, and do 
hope, that your most sanguine expectations may be realized. 
You have struggled long and manfully against an adverse tide 
and deserve success. I have never doubted that your moun- 
tain property was of great value; but always feared, that you 
would not be able to hold on sufficiently long to realize your 
anticipations. I hope in that I may be mistaken. 

What effect has the Richmond movement had? 2 You see 
that it has been met with sperit by the Charleston Meeting, 
and will be by the whole State and I trust the entire South. 
If it should be met by my friends as it ought to be, it will 
react on its authors.

confidence of the party." See Niles's Register, LXIV, 22.

letter. I shall not fail to avail myself of your kind offer, in 
reference to my son, and shall say to him, that he must regard 
you in the place of a parent, while at the University. I am 
exceedingly uneasy about the affection of his Larinx. He 
writes me that his disease was much aggrav[at]ed by expos- 
ure in the steamboat going down the Potomac on his way to 
the University, and that he has not yet recovered from the 
effects of the exposure. His letter has very greatly increased 
my anxiety about him. It is my desire, if the disease con- 
tinues, that he should have the benefit of the hest medical ad- 
vice that can be obtained. You would exceedingly oblige me, 
if you would take the same steps in his case, in reference to 
this distressing disease, as if he were your own son. 

You cannot have less confidence in a caucus or convention 
to nominate a candidate for the Presidency, than I have. It 
is with extreme reluctance that 1 would permit my name to 
go before any, however constituted, as my reluctance is insu- 
perable to permitting it to go before one not as fairly consti- 
tuted, as the nature of such an assemblage would admit. 
Nothing but the circumstances in which my friends are placed, 
at this time, could induce me to yield to the authority of any 
convention. The proceedings of the Richmond Meeting are 
little calculated to add to the authority of such meetings, 
whether state or general. Its recommendations, if they 
should be adopted, would create a precedent, which if not re- 
versed, would transfer the control of the Presidential election 
permanently to a few large non slave holding states to the 
exclusion of Virginia and the whole South in the end. 

I regard the scheme as a cunning devise of the New York 
School of Politicks and the course of Mr. Ritchie and his asso- 
ciates in adopting it, as base treason to Virginia and all the 
South. He and they have stuck Virginia as a tail to New 
York instead of placing her in National position at the head 
of the South. 

I agree with you as to the importance of a press at Rich- 
mond. It is time that the authority of the Enquirer and 
Ritchie should be checked. An able and judicious press 
there, with respectable subscriptions would soon put a new 
face on things. Mr. Hunter afforded me an opportunity of 
reading your manuscript copy against conventions as the

means of nominating a Presidential candidate. There is very 
little in it, that I do not cordially approve, and I hope that at 
the proper time it will be published. It is calculated to awaken 
thought and to do much good. 



To R. M. T. Hunter. c. c. 

Fort Hill 2 d April 1842 [1843] 

MY DEAR SIR, I had been at home but a few days, when 
business compelled me to leave. I did not return till the 28 th 
March, when I found your two letters of the 10 th and 17 th of 
March among others, that had been received in my absence. 

The Richmond proceedings gave a heavy blow against (I 
will not say us) the South and in their effects, should they not 
be arested, against the Constitution itself. I have examined 
them with care; and I cannot be mistaken, when I say, that 
should conventions to nominate the presidential candidates 
become the settled practice, and should the Richmond resolu- 
tions form the precedent, on which they are hereafter to be 
constituted, the necessary consequence will be, that the great 
central non slave holding states will control the election, to 
the exclusion of the rest of the Union, and especially the 
South. It would place permanently the control of the ballot 
box, the patronage of the Government and the veto in the 
same hands, and those the least safe of any, in which they 
could be placed. In other words, it would centralize the 
powers of the Union, and establish the most intolerable 
despotism, by virtually subverting the Constitution, as far as 
the election of the President is concerned, and substituting in 
its place, the worst possible mode that could be devised. I 
regard the whole as a cunningly devised scheme of the N. 
York School, emenating from the brain of Wright and 
designed to lead to the result, to which it must, if the pre- 
cedent it is intended to form be not arrested. And what is 
base; what is calculated to excite the deepest indignation in 
the bosom of every true hearted Virginian and son of the 
South is, that Ritchie and his associates should sink Virginia 
from her high and proud position of standing at the head of 
the South, to make her the humble and dependent follower of 
New York to be her tail instead of the head of the South. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 529 

It is not a new thing with him. He began his work in 1829, 
after the election of Gen 1 Jackson. Had he not then deserted 
Virginia and the south for N. York, Gen 1 . Jackson would 
never have taken the course he did. All that I ever antici- 
pated from his election would have been realised, and the 
flood of corruption which since broke in on the Government 
and country, and the disasters which have followed would 
have been staid. I trace all our misfortunes almost exclusively 
to the fact, that Virginia has lost her true position in the 
Union, and that to the Wiles and cunning of one man. . I 
had hoped, that he would have returned in good faith, to the 
old Virginia School of politicks, but of that I dispair. The 
omission of all mention of the Tariff in Drumgooles address 
is ominous. It proves design to abandon our cause on the 
most vital of all questions. 

I write what I have, as preliminary to saying, that in my 
opinion, there is but one of three courses left for our Vir- 
ginia friends; to submit quietly to be placed where the mana- 
gers of the Convention have put the State, or rather intend 
to put the State; to break Mr. Ritchie and his associates down, 
or drive them openly into the camp to which they truly be- 
long. We would be safer with them there, than in our camp. 
They, in truth, belong to the N. York and not to the Virginia 
school of politicks. If it is not intended to submit, a paper 
at Richmond, conducted with judgement, sperit and ability, is 
indispensible. It is the one thing needful. Such a paper 
backed by a general organization of our friends could not fail 
to accomplish the object intended. Break ground against the 
time, in a decided and sperited tone. Call on the friends of 
all, who are truly in favour of harmony and desire that the 
nomination should truly represent the Voice of the party to 
rally in favour of May 1844. Draw the attack of M r Ritchie, 
but when attacked carry the war into Africa. I fear our 
friends in your state are not prepared for so bold and decided 
a course; but I feel assured, that properly executed, it is the 
safest. We ought not to look too exclusively to the election. 
Our eyes must be kept on consequences to follow beyond. 

As to our state, I have no idea, that she will acquiesce in 
the Virginia proceedings, if she should stand alone; and, if 
she should, I cannot consistently with my opinion of the prin- 
HIST 99 VOL ii 34 



530 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ciples involved and the consequences to follow permit my 
name to go before a convention to be held at the time and to 
be constituted, as the Richmond Resolutions recommend. 

I am much gratified to learn, that you have determined to 
run again, and I do hope, that you will run with success. 
Your presence in the next Congress will be of great impor- 
tance; and on the course of that Congress much very much 
will depend. I do hope that the South will make the adjust- 
ment of the Tariff strictly on revenue principles, a Sine qua 
non. It will be impossible to reform the Government, so long 
as duties are laid for protection so long as what is a tax in 
the most oppressive form in one Section, is a bounty, or re- 
garded as a bounty, in the other. 

I shall be anxious to hear from }^ou and to learn, as soon as 
possible, the result of your election. I am glad to see, that 
Hubbard runs again, and also Smith. I hope Goode will not 
give away to Drumgoole. I hope the day is not far distant, 
when Virginia will return to her old mode of self nomination, 
to the entire overthrow of the caucus system. 



To James Edward (Jalhoun. c. c. 

Fort Hill 8 th April 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, It is a little uncertain, when I shall go to 
Georgia. M r Clemson may probably go over next week. It 
will however depend on information, that may be received 
from there. I delivered your message in reference to Arthur's 
note, and he will leave it with your sister, ready to be deliv- 
ered, whenever you may send up for it. I shall attend to your 
request in reference to D r . Symes paper. I regret to hear of 
Polydore's attack. He is a very valuable negro, and his death 
would be a great loss to you. 

Whether there will be an extra session or not, must depend 
on the state of the treasury and that again on the imports. If 
they should not increase very considerably compared to what 
they were during the first quarter, a call session will be un- 
avoidable; but I am of the impression that they will, and that 
it is doubtful whether one will be called or not. I agree with 
you, that it is highly desirable, that the Van Buren party 






LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 531 

should be compelled to show their hands on the Tariff and the 
sooner the better. He and his party have twice betrayed us 
on the Tariff. It was they, who passed those of '28 and '42, 
and they will be sure to betray us again, unless closely 
watched. That they intend it, I have no doubt. The fact 
that Drumgole's address had no reference to the Tariff is 
itself almost conclusive proof of their intention. 

I understand the biographical Sketch has had and is having 
a very extended circulation. The only real danger is the Con- 
vention. That point must be watched with vigilence. I think, 
on the question of time, we shall certainly succeed. That is 
important, but the manner of constituting the convention, and 
how the members shall vote are not less so. I trust we shall 
succeed in fixing them on fair principles; but I have made up 
my mind, that I will not permit my name to go before a con- 
vention, which is not calculated to bring out fully and fairly 
the voice of the party. I regard any other as a fraud on the 
people. 

I hope you and Maria will not fail to make us a visit during 
the summer. We shall be glad to see you. It will give you 
an opportunity to look at your mountain property. Pickens 
is becoming quite a gold region. You ought to look to your 
property at this time. A good gold mine would be of service 
at a period of such low prices. 

All join in love to you. 



To Joseph A. Scoville. 1 c. c. 

Fort Hill 28 th April 1843 

DEAR SIR, If I do not answer your letters, you must not 
infer, that I do not appreciate your efforts, or want confidence 
in you; but because I deem it both proper and prudent, that 
I should write as few letters as possible. 

I concur with you, both in reference to a press in N. York 
and in Washington. Our cause is based on truth, justice and 
the Constitution, and only needs enlightened and able discussion 
to succeed. A Well established and well conducted paper at 

1 From a draft in Calhoun's handwriting. Scoville was a New York journalist, after- 
wards Calhoun's private secretary, At this time he was editing the Spectator, a Calhoun 
paper, in Washington.

both points are almost essential. The Spectator is doing 
Well. The last number is excellent. It ought never to 
attack, but in self defence; and then with moderation, dig- 
nity and power. Purs[u]ing the course I doubt not it will, I 
have no doubt, it will be well supported and patronized. It 
takes time for a paper to gain confidence and strength; but 
in the present state of things, a paper properly conducted at 
the Seat of Gov*., cannot fail in the end to acquire both. 

Our State Convention will now meet at Columbia in a few 
weeks, when I have no doubt proper measures will be devised 
to produce concert of action, and to give support to the cause. 

Every thing looks well at the South. I received a letter 
from John Danthforth of N. London, Con*, last week. He 
gives a favourable account of a conversation he recently had 
with Gov r . Cleveland, and speaks favourably of the State of 
things in Connecticut. Do you know him? And also one 
from P. T. Buchan, of Rochester, N. Y. very sensible and 
favourable. He thinks, if my views on the Tariff could be 
fully understood and satisfactorily explained, I would carry 
the State. Do you know him? And if so, who is he? I 
also had one from an ardent young friend of N. Orleans, 
Alexander Walker, who gives a very favourable account of 
the State of things in Louisana. It would be well to send 
him a number of the Spectator with some prospectus. 

I hear nothing of the Volume of Speeches. 2 What delays 
its appearance, and when will it be out? It is desirable that 
it should be as soon as possible. Every day now is important, 
in the w&y of giving information. 

How has the life gone out? Has any effort been made to 
circulate it?

great point, second only in importance to your taking charge

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 533 

of the Spectator, and Georgia and N. H. adopting the District 
System. It would give us a head and a leader, with great 
influence and skill, where one is most needed. 

I do not think, that my friends ought to be uneasy about 
the Rhode Island question. The questions propounded by M r 
Smith all, except the last, are couched in General terms, and 
relate to the Federal aspect of the Subject. Thus presented, 
they will puzzle M r Van Buren and the other candidates to 
answer them much more, than they will me. The last asks my 
opinion on the right of suffrage involved in the question. On 
that, I am too orthodox to be injured. I have just concluded 
my answer to his questions, and it is now copying, to be sent. 
I hold the argument on all the points to be incontrovertible; 
and that neither of the others can venture to take different 
grounds, without Shocking the sense of the Community. I 
feel bound to send it to him, but shall do it, undei; strict injunc- 
tion not to publish, or show it to any one, till he gets the 
answers of the others, which I have no idea will be shortly. 
I would be glad, that you could see it. 1 

I agree with you, that we ought to do nothing, that can 
fairly be avoided, to alienate the friends of M r Van Buren; 
but while sarcasm, and everthing of the kind ought to be 
avoided, I hold, that whenever he, or his friends take false, 
or doubtful grounds, as on the tariff, it ought to be exposed 
to the publick, in a moderate and dignified way; and that we 
ought to be resolute not to be driven from our ground, when 
right. I say so, because, I do not in the least doubt, that he 
and his friends, including Ritchie, intend to betray us again 
on the Tariff question. They did so in '28 and '42, and if we 
permit ourselves to be betrayed the third time, like third 
apoplectick stroke, it will be fatal. The worse possible result 
of the election would be for us to be wheedled by their decep- 
tive arts to aid in his election, to be betrayed again on that 
vital question ; not openly, for that they dare not, but by their 
incidental duties, combined with a permanent high rate of 
expenditures. Do you not notice, that Van Buren in his 
Indiana letter 2 speaks of a rate of duty, which would give a

revenue of at least 125,000,000, and that Ritchie says, that 
the Tariff of '42 must be essentially modified. The Bill of 
abomination modified! There is a volume in that. 

On the subject of making a declaration on my part, in ref- 
erence to discrimination, I must be excused. I can make 
none. My sentiments on the Tariff stand of Record, and are 
such as I believe to be true. I maintained them in the worst 
of times, and against fearful odds, and nothing can induce me 
to change or modify them. All that can be expected from 
me is, that 1 will not change the system of revenue, nor make 
too sudden a transition from high to low duties, to that, I 
am adverse and always have been. 

It would be desirable to have the cooperation of Beardsley, 
but I should think, that there is another individual more likely 
to cooperate with us, and whose cooperation would be more 
important. I mean Co 1 Young, the Secretary of State. I am 
not personally acquainted with him but should think, from all 
I know of him that he is talented and independent, and from 
his position, not well inclined to the side of what is called the 
Regency. It would be well to learn what are his opinions 
and inclination, if you can do it through some safe and con- 
fidential channel.

that they should be published early. 1 would be glad, that 
you would write to them and ascertain when they are to 
appear and let me know, as well as the cause of delay.

dispair of the old Commonwealth. The indication every where 
South of Virginia is favourable. In this state, there is per- 
fect unanimity and much devotion to the cause. You have of 
course seen the address of our Convention, and I hope you 
approve of it. The Georgia Convention meets to day, and I 
had, before I received your letter, written to an influential 
member, and enclosed him the address of our Convention, and 
advised him strongly to adopt the principles throughout, 
even to Districting. There will be no difficulty, as the dis- 
tricts of the bill vetoed by Governor McDonald can be adopted, 
which I suggested to him. If Georgia, which is the largest 
and most influential of the General ticket States, should adopt 
the District system, it will be decisive. I also wrote to Col 
Pickens and suggested the propriety of his writing forwith 
to M r Woodbury, and urging him to exert himself to induce 
N. H. to adopt the same course. Her legislature meets this 
month, and no time is to be lost. Can you not put other 
springs in motion there? It is important, and every thing 
ought to be done, to obtain her concurrence. It would go 
far to settle the question. 

I am glad, that you visited Washington, and have got Sco- 
ville out of the Spectator. All condemn his want of Discre- 
tion; but I do not doubt his attachment. I agree with you, 
that he ought to be dealt with liberally; and you may say so 
to him. I have written to him not more than two or three 
letters altogether, and they of a character, that can do no 
mischief, if published. I got a letter from Hart on the differ- 
ence between them, which I enclosed in the letter I wrote to 
you or Maxcy on the subject; I do not recollect which. I 
wrote you both. 

Co 1 Pickens writes me, that he has written you on the sub- 
ject of taking charge of the Spectator, and that he was 
authorized by the Presiding officers of the Convention to 
ofi'er you $4000. 1 do hope, you will find it consistent with 
your interest and feelings to accept the offer. It would give 
the paper at once an established character, and wide circula- 
tion, and go far to decide the contest, and would put myself 
and my friends, if possible, under still stronger obligations. 
I am sure you could not take a step, that would have greater

influence on the contest, and the after history of the country. 
It would among other things supercede the necessity of estab- 
lishing a press at Bitchmond. Your Nephew could be your 
coadjutor, and on your withdrawal take possession of the 
establishment; which, if we succeed, would give him a solid 
basis to commence with. You need not apprehend, that 1 
shall take any hasty step relative to the Convention. I am 
seriously anxious to give it a fair trial, though I have no 
great confidence, that it can be made tolarable. Ritchie has 
put himself, and through his influence, put the State in a 
false position; in that of an associate, nominally, with the 
other great central States, but in reality, as the tail of N. 
York; and it is scarcely possible to bring him and those with 
whom he acts, in and out of the State, to yield to any fairly 
arranged Convention. They rely on one constituted for the 
purpose of effecting their design, and will fight desperately 
for it. Hence, he will be deadly opposed to the address of 
our Convention. He sees the blow and will struggle to parry 
it; but, if Virginia shall be true to herself, and my friends 
stand firm, it will be all in vain. Her true position is at the 
head of the South (the weaker Section) and of the medium 
size and smaller States. It is the one suited to her political 
creed and out of which, in fact, her creed grew; and the only 
one, in which she can maintain her high standing and influ- 
ence in the Union. In any other, she must become con- 
temptible and be entirely detached from the South. Her 
desertion of it since 1828, has caused all our disasters and 
compelled this state, reluctantly, to take the ground she 
deserted. We never sought it, and would be glad to yield it 
to her. If he should ever support me, it will be on compul- 
sion, and becouse he can do no better. Believe what I say. 
I know him well and his ways, and to what he is wedded. I 
agree with you, that the true course will be, at the proper 
time, to go on and make appointments according to our plan of 
delegates from Districts. I say, at the proper time; for we 
need not be in a hurry. November is already abandoned; 
and so will the other parts of the plan of the Virginia 
Contention]. . . . 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 537 

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 7 th June 1843 

DEAR SIR, I hope you had a pleasant and safe voyage, and 
that the favorable change going on in reference to the credit 
of the country, will enable you to dispose of to advantage your 
valuable property. 

The course of events, politically speaking and in reference 
to myself, as far as I am informed, since you left, is such as 
you, and my friends would desire. There is, I think, no dan- 
ger of any state South of North Carolina. That State will be 
taken either by M r Clay, or myself; and as I regard Clay's 
chance to be far from bright, I consider the prospect there to 
be in my favour. Virginia is a doubtful state, but my friends 
are sanguine. They think the prospect daily brightens. Of 
the other portions of the Union I will not speak, except to 
say, I hear nothing unfavorable. 

On the subject of the commercial arrangement with England, 
I think M r Webster's developement was too sudden, and early. 
The papers in the various parts of the Union were not pre- 
pared to take their ground, and many have gone off in the 
direction of the Globe. Even in this State, the Mercury rather 
fell into its tracts, under the apprehension, that M r Webster's 
object in the scheme, was to divide and distract the anti Tariff 
interest, by holding out the f alacious hope of an arrangement, 
that could never be made. A friend wrote me from Charles*- 
ton, to know my views, which I gave him, and hope they may 
have the effect pf putting things right, in that quarter. 

I must say, that I have not much hope, that anything satis- 
factory can be done, in the form of arrangement; although I 
do not doubt the sincerity of the Government on either side. 
The difficulties are great; but if an equal and fair arrange- 
ment can be made, I do not doubt its expediency. I am for 
free trade; free trade on both sides, if it can be had; but, if 
not, on one side. It is good in part, but better in whole, for 
the interest of both countries; and my advice, as far as I have 
an opportunity of giving it to my friends, is to push without 
the least relaxation for decided action on the part of Congress, 
at the next session; but at the same time, to throw no dis-

couragement on the attempt to arrange the Duties by mutual 
agreement; and, I hope, they may take that course. It is, I 
hold, to be the most certain mode to effect the object they have 
in view; to strike off the Shackles of Commerce. 

I do not concur in the opinion of yourself and other friends 
that I should travel this summer, or at any time during the 
Canvass. My judgement is strongly opposed to it. I have 
never known any one, occupying the position I do, that has 
not lost by it; and for which many and strong reasons might 
be assigned. Among them, I believe one of the strongest is, 
that there is a large, and quiet, but influential portion of the 
country, who regard the office, as too exalted and too respon- 
sible to be an object of personal solicitude, or Canvess, and 
such I must say is my opinion and feeling. The highest office 
of the Union ought to be the reward of acknowledged services 
services long and faithful, and, ensuring a thorough knowl- 
edge of our system of Gov* and deep devotion to the freedom 
and happiness of the Country. Under this impression, I have 
made up my mind to avoid anything, that looks like election- 
eering. I would rather lose the office, than to seek it by 
means unworthy, in my opinion, of its dignity, and high and 
responsible trusts. It may be fastidious, but as such are my 
feelings, I must yield obedience to them. 

I shall be glad to hear from you, whenever it may be con- 
venient. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. 

Fort Hill 6 th July 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 16 th June arrived while I 
was absent from home on business, which will explain the 
delay of my answer. 

I entirely concur in the propriety of your suggestions; that 
our friends ought to organize on Congressional Districts, and 
that Candidates ought to come out at the proper time on our 
side, one in each District. But it appears' to me, that some 
preliminary steps ought to be taken. If I do not mistake, 
we hold in our hands the means of forcing on the friends of 
M r Van Buren in Virginia and N. York the choice of dele- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 539 

gates by District and the per capita mode of voting in spite 
of the dictation of General Drumgool. 

His friends (V. B.) have been forced, in order to escape 
from the [awkward] position, which their attempt to have the 
Convention held in Nov r . , to agree to leave the dicision as to 
time and place of holding it, to a majority of the States. 
You will see at once the advantage which this gives us. It 
recognizes the principle, that the majority of the States is 
the proper authority to determine all preliminary questions 
touching the Convention, where there is a division of senti- 
ment among the friends of the candidates. It is a most im- 
portant principle, better calculated to give a just control to 
the less populous states and sections of the Union, in making 
the nomination, than any other that could be devised; and, 
let me add, thereby to add proportionately to the Stability of 
the Union and our free and popular institutions. Without 
it, the nomination, and through it the election, would be per- 
manently consolidated in the hands of the great States lying 
contiguous to the centre. Leave it to each State to deter- 
mine, as Genl Drumgoole contends, how the delegates shall be 
appointed, and how vote, how many shall be appointed, and 
how their votes shall [be] counted, and it must be obvious, the 
central and powerful States would control permanently the 
nomination, and thereby the election and the Executive De- 
partment, and through it the whole Government. It would, 
in fact, place the control of the ballot box and the executive 
power, patronage and veto in the same hands and thus erect 
one of the most odious Despotisms that ever existed. It is, 
in fact, only when the Executive power is under the influence 
or control of the less populous states and sections, that there 
is any balance in the system, and it is only then, as experi- 
ence shows, that it works well. The value of the principle, 
in question, is that its certain tendency is to give them a just 
share of the influence and control over that Department. 
There is a large majority of the States, that are under the 
medium size and population, and if they are true to them- 
selves, they will under the operation of the principle, estab- 
lish the most equitable rules for constituting the Convention 
and governing its votes and proceedings. It will be in the 
power of New England and the Southern and South Western

states, to protect themselves against the overwhelming vote 
of the Midle and North western states. 

We ought at once to acquiesce in the precedent and the 
principle it establishes, that the majority of the States is the 
proper authority to decide all preliminary questions, in refer- 
ence to the Convention, and some one of the central Com- 
mittees, say that of Maryland or New Hampshire, ought to 
immitate that of Indiana, and all at the proper time on the 
Committees of the Several states to report to the same papers 
(Globe and Enquirer) the decision of their respective States, 
as to the mode of appointing delegates and how they shall vote. 
In the mean time, our friends in all quarters ought to be active 
by correspondence and discussion to call publick attention to 
the subject. I regard the establishment of the principle, that 
delegates shall be appointed by Districts and that they shall 
vote per capita more important, as it regards the result of the 
election, and the future operations of the Government, than 
any other. Too much pains cannot be taken to establish it. 
It would be in fact, but a consummation of the great victory 
you effected last year, in the apportionment bill. The two 
would give a new lease to our institutions. Can you not put 
Woodbury 1 and our N. England friends in motion on the 
subject? . . .

MY DEAR SIR, I regret, that you could not take the Charge 
of the Spectator, but doubt not, that you have decided correctly 
all things considered. I think M r Smith would do well, and 
do hope he may essent. He would do much to hold the 
Globe and Enquirer in check, and would have a fair prospect 
of obtaining at least a share of the publick printing. I think 
he could not do better. 

I have given the subject of visiting the different portions of 
the Union on the invitation of my friends full and deliberate 
consideration, and the more I have reflected, the more thor-

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 541 

oughly am I satisfied, the proper course viewed every way is 
to decline; and 1 had, before I received your letter, written a 
formal letter declining the invitation of my friends of Cin- 
cinati to visit that place and Ohio. Laying aside all the 
higher considerations of propriety and general expediency, 
and viewing it simply, as bearing on the result of the election, 
and I feel confident, the weight of the Argument is against it. 
Take even, in that light, the most narrow view. To accept all 
or the greater part of the invitations would engross my time 
and keep me continually on the route; which would be alike 
exhausting to mind, body and character. Before the termi- 
nation I would feel in my own estimation and would be 
regardfed] in that of the publick, to be a mere political elec- 
tioneerer. On the other hand, to make a discrimination, and 
accept but a few, would give offense to all others. I could 
not go to the North, without offending the West; nor to both, 
without offending the South and South West. 

But the truth is, if 1113" opinion was different; if 1 thought 
I could gain by it, and even secure the election, I could hardly 
bring myself to adopt it certainly not, but for the respect 
1 have for my friends and desire to meet their wishes; so 
repugnant are my feelings to it. It may be pride, it may be 
fastediousness, or a sense of propriety, or the whole combined; 
but so it is, and 1 cannot help it. I would be happy to travel 
quietly, as an individual to see my friends and converse freely 
with them; but I am adverse to being made a spectacle, or 
considered an electioneerer, or to take a step, that would, in 
the publick estimation, indicate a personal solicitude about the 
office, which I do not feel. But enough of this. 

I read the article in the Enquirer in answer to DrumgooPs 
miserable communication, with pleasure. It does much credit 
to your Nephew. 

The nomination of Van Buren in Maine, I regard as more a 
defeat, than a victory. To obtain nominations by stealth 
sivms to be a part of his established policy. It cannot fail to 
react. 

You are right, as to the course, that the Globe and the 
Knquirer intend to take. I see the Petersburgh Republican 
understands the game, and has taken good notice of it for a 
commencement. It is a point he may touch with great effect. 



542 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The Mercury just at this time is quiet about the presidential 
election, and it is perhaps proper it should be so. The elec- 
tions are pending in Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi, where 
our friends for the most part are the candidates; and where 
the friends of V. B, at least a part, would be glad to have any 
pretex not to vote. Many of the old, inveterate hacks would 
prefer the Success of the Whigs to any but their own friends, 
notwithstanding all the cant about harmony etc. etc. 

I infer from an extract from a letter from M r . Buchanan, 
sent me by a friend, that his feeling, as you suppose, is adverse 
to M r V. B. 

The indications are, that the Whigs are beaten in Louis[i]ana. 
If so, it will greatly damp the hope of Clay's friends. 1 
regard his case as hopeless; and, if such should prove to be 
the fact, it will be difficult to estimate its effect on the elec- 
tion. In shaping their course, our friends ought to take into 
the estimate, the probability of the fact. 



To R. M. T. Hunter. 

Fort Hill 6 th Aug* 1843. 

MY DEAR SIR, My impression is and has been, that it would 
be difficult, if not impossible to get up a general organization. 
It required the aid of office and patronage for M r V. B. to 
effect it; and cannot be effected in any other way, except 
through an opposition, such as Clay heads, and which looks 
to plunder. Each state and section will have to act for itself. 
N. England can readily organize. 

Our strength lies in principles and position, in which we 
have altogether the advantage, so much so, that if we had the 
aid of a single central paper, of established influence, such 
as the Enquirer, or the Globe, there would be no contest. 

In nothing have we a greater advantage than that of posi- 
tion in the question of the Convention. If that alone is well 
used, it would give us the control of the nomination or force 
the friends of M r Van Buren to break up the Convention. 
We not only have truth, justice and the Constitution with us 
in reference to it, but what is not always the case, they are 
sustained by the plausible and the popular. The very fact, 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 543 

that our position permits us to appeal to a majority of the 
States to decide the preliminary questions, gives us a control 
over them; and through them over the nomination, if well 
used. The great point now is, to push the Discussion in refer- 
ence to it. In order to open it, I have, (inter nos and in strick 
confidence) aided in preparing an article in reply to Drum- 
goole's answer to the S. Carolina address, which has been sent 
to the Petersburgh Republican for publication. You must 
follow it up. 

There will be, I think, no difficulty in getting at the sense 
of the majority of the states. Most of them have already 
spoken through their conventions, or Legislatures, and cen- 
tral Committees, or in the case of the question of time, may 
speak for others, as was done on the appeal of the Indiana 
Committee; or it may be taken, when the Convention meets, 
as you suggest. It would, however, in that case be advisable, 
that our friends eveiy where, should send delegates from 
Districts. It would greatly strengthen our position. In a 
confederacy like ours, and on State rights principle, where 
states act as states, as the Richmond plan proposes, each is 
equal to the other, and the vote of each counts but one. 

I wrote to a friend in Boston, calling his attention to the 
subject, and suggested the propriety of their Convention 
making a move on the subject, when it meets next month. N. 
England and the South have a deep interest in the question. 

I received a letter from M r Smith by the mail before the 
last, saying that he had received M r V. B. reply to his ques- 
tions. I sent mine by the last mail. I have had it prepared 
for a long time, and wrote him, that I would transmit it, as 
soon as he informed me, that he had received a reply from 
any one, to whom they had been addressed. I have made my 
answer full; in fact covered the whole ground, and in a great 
measure exhausted the subject. I have requested him to show 
it to you, if an oppertunity should offer. I would be very 
glad you could see it. My own impression has always been, 
that the best way was to meet the question ; and, if it should 
be thought advisable, it can be done in no better form, than 
that in which the questions and answer places it. If he should 
conclude to publish, would it not be better to have the corre- 



544 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

spondence put in pamphlet form first and sent to the various 
leading papers of the Union for publication. It would, I 
think, give it a more general circulation, and more importance. 



To R. M. T Hunter, c. c. 

Fort Hill 26 th Aug* 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, Absence from home for a few days has de- 
layed till now the acknowledgement of your letter of the 4 th 
Ins*. 

You will have seen, if you take the Mercury, that the 
subject of an appeal to the Majority of the States has taken 
a new turn. A member of our State Convention has pro- 
pounded two questions to M r Ritchie, which will throw the 
onus on him. If he should, in his answer, yield to us, it will 
open the way to a joint appeal; but if his answer should be 
the reverse, then it will be for us to take our course. In my 
opinion it should be bold and decisive, so as to make up the 
issue at once. 

I am happy to inform you, that our friends in Charleston 
are acting with sperit with reference to funds. On the sub- 
ject of an editor, I am not prepared to advise in detail. I 
have full confidence in yourself, Maxcy. and Gen 1 Towson, 
who is a fast friend and has an excellent judgement and who 
may be safely consulted on all points. We want ability, ex- 
perience, tack, and sound principles on all points, with known 
devotion to the cause. It would be better that the Editor be 
South of Mason and Dixon line. It will be difficult, if not 
impossible, to get all these combined in any one. Some must 
be sacrificed; but my impression is, that one thing is indis- 
pensible, that he should be of us, and known to oe devoted to 
our cause and principles. We must fight the battle on our 
own ground," and those who join us, must rally under our 
Standard. We must neither go over nor seem to go over to 
others, but they to come to us. Of the two refered to by 
you, this indispensible requisite would seem to refer to 
Greenhow, but what, in that case, would be done with the 
Petersburgh Republican ? Who would take charge of it ? or 
would it be transferred to Washington, and the two merged? 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 545 

How would C. C. Baldwin do for an editor? He has un- 
doubted talents, and his position is good. If the Gentleman 
recommended by W. should be thought of, his name should 
not for the present appear connected with the establishment. 
He is able and experienced, but would be wanting in the in- 
dispensible. It would be regarded as a coalition, and place 
us in a false position. I regard W. as a friend, and 3 r ou 
would do well to speak explicitly to him. To stand fast on 
our own ground is indispensible to victory, or if defeat should 
be our lot, to prevent it from becoming an overthrow. Stand- 
ing honestty and fearlessly on our own ground, we must ever 
have strength and command respect. That, you and all our 
friends must be cautious not to take &ny step, which, by con- 
sequence, would lead to an jibandonment of, really or appear- 
antly, from any calculation of increased strength, or victory. 

I am glad, that you have opened a correspondence with M r 
L. He is an able and experienced man, and can do much. I 
hope he will be active. I read the article to which }^ou refer. 
It is well done and will do good, and does credit to his son. 

I would be happ}^ to hear from your young friend George 
Pendleton. Will you say to him ? He will make a valuable 
correspondent in the West. 

The result of the election in Tennessee and Kentucky is cal- 
culated to make a deep impression. It proves, that both 
Clayism and Jackson Van Burenism are worn out, and that a 
new order of things is approaching. It is the time for us to 
assume openly and boldly our ground. We have nothing to 
fear, defeated, or victorious, if we be but true to ourselves 
and our cause. The Mercury will henceforward take a bold 
and active part. The unfortunate sickness and absence of its 
talented editor weakened it much for a time, but arrangement 
has been made to carry it on with vigour. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 8 th Sep r 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have read with interest your letter. It 
gives me much important information, which confirms my 

i Original lent by Mr. Robert P. Maynard, of Taooma, Wash. 
HIST 1W VOL H -'5 



546 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

previous impressions. I have, in the present remarkable state 
of things, not been inattentive to the course of events in Eng- 
land, and have come to the conclusion, that it would take the 
turn you anticipate. England has but one alternative; to 
harmonize her interest with that of the other portions of the 
civilized world, or resort to force to maintain her pre-eminence. 
If she adopts the former, freedom of commerce and non inter- 
ference with the institutions of other nations must be the basis 
of her policy; but if the latter, she must prepare for universal 
conflict with the civilized world. The danger 1$, that she will 
select the latter. If so, it will present a scene of struggle and 
violence unparalleled in the history of the world, which will 
end in her downfall; but if the former, it will open a new 
page of prosperity and civilization never before known on 
the Globe. 

Strange as it may seem, the discussion of the corn law ques- 
tion and the sugar duties, will go far to decide this great issue. 
In the advanced state of commerce and the arts, the great 
point of policy for the older and more advanced nations is to 
command the trade of the newer and less advanced; and that 
cannot be done, but by opening a free trade in provisions and 
raw materials with them. The effect of the contrary policy 
is not only to cripple their commerce and manufactures, by 
curtailling exchanges; but to force the newer and less ad- 
vanced portion to become prematurely their competitors. 
This England now sees and feels, and that to remedy the evil, 
the corn laws and the sugar duties in favour of her colonies, 
must be repealed, or that she must resort to force to maintain 
her commercial and manufacturing superiority. But, if force 
is resorted to, the blow will first be struck at the U. States, 
Brazil and other slave holding countries. The reason is obvious. 
It is indispensible to give her a monopoty of the great staples 
they produce, and through them, a monopoly of the trade of the 
world. The abolition of slavery would transfer the production 
of cotton, rice, and sugar etc. etc. to her colonial possessions, 
and would consummate the system of commercial monopoly, 
which she has been so long and systematically pursuing. 
Hence the movements in Texas and elsewhere on the abolition 
subject at this time. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN". 547 

I see by your remarks, you have not formed a correct esti- 
mate of the state of things on this side of the Ocean. We are 
not ignorant of the danger to which you allude, but that is 
not our only danger. If there be danger from the spoils por- 
tion of the Democratick party, there is not much less from the 
Whig party, which is eagerly looking on to profit by any 
division in our ranks. It is necessary to guard against both, 
which requires great caution and makes the movements exceed- 
ingly complicated; the more so, from the position of M r 
Tyler, who, I understand, is very sanguine. 

In the mean time, the elections in Tennessee and Kentucky 
clearly indicate, the decay of the influence of both M r V. B. 
and M r Clay, and a giving away of the foundations on which 
they stand. In Tennessee, the influence of V. B. Jackson 
and Polk was perfectly united without any disturbing cause 
whatever, and yet that is the only state, in which the Whigs 
have gained and the Democrats lost ground. As to Kentucky, 
the result speaks for itself and shows a great decay of Clay's 
influence. 

As to myself, I am resolved, that let the election end as it 
may, I shall take care not to lose position. 1 shall abandon 
no principle, or any position, which I have heretofore assumed. 
Whether victorious, or defeated, it shall be on my own ground. 
Victory thus won will be worth having, and defeat, if it should 
come, will not be an overthrow. But within these limits, I 
shall exercise as much conciliation, as is consistent with pre- 
serving them. Of the two, I would rather risk defeat, than 
character. 



To R. M. T. Hunter. 

Fort Hill 12 th Sep r 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, I have no doubt, but that the cause to which 
you refer has a powerful effect in the North and North West; 
and that it has been secretly used by Van Buren and his friends 
to weaken me. It ought to have been struck at vigorously 
when his papers first made a point of it against me, arid the 
South, but that having passed, I do not think it would be 
advisable to move on the subject 'till some new occasion shall 
offer, which, if it should not before, it will be sure to do, dur-

ing the next session of Congress. The Slave question will 
then come up in some form, or another; either on the pre- 
sentation of petitions, or in connection with Texas or the cir- 
cular, said to be sent by the British Government to its consuls 
to enquire and report minutely on the condition of our Slaves; 
when the friends of M r Van Buren will be compelled to show 
their hands. If my memory serves me, the N. York Legisla- 
ture has not yet repealed the obnoxious act against which 
the act of your Legislature was in part directed, granting 
Jury trial to fugitive Slaves. If so, it will give a proper 
occasion to test the course of his friends on that vital ques- 
tion to the South, They have now, or will have a majority in 
both Houses of their Legislature, and will have no excuse, 
should they refuse to repeal the act. The question once 
opened the discussion can receive the direction you suggest, 
and be connected with the grounds taken b} 7 the N. York 
Post, and the Rochester and Nantucket papers against myself 
on the subject; and against what, if I am right, M r Ritchie 
never raised his voice, or, if at all, in the feeblest tone. 

I am of the impression, with you, that M r V. B. is gaining 
strength in Pennsylvania, but that he never can obtain suffi- 
cient to get the votes of the state. I never thought, that 
Buchanan's hold on the state was strong. The great object of 
his friends there in rallying on him was to wait events, and I 
am of the impression, that when the time comes, he will be 
too weak, or too timid to control the state; I have never cal- 
culated, accordingly, that he would have the control of its 
choice. It will go for the strongest, be he who he may; I 
mean, he who is most likely to succeed. I have no doubt, 
that M 1 Buchanan is in reality opposed to M r Van Buren, and 
would prefer the election of almost an} T other; but he will 
not seperate from the majority of the state, go which way it 
may. In a word, to control the state, strength must be shown 
out <>f it. If her votes can decide the election between V. B. 
and any other, they will not be given to him. 

It is now manifest, that the sentiment of the party is in 
favour of appointing delegates by Districts and voting per 
capita. The indications are strong, that both Missouri and 
Tennessee will decide for that plan; and the question is, will 
N. York and Virginia hold out for their plan ? I say their 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 549 

plan, for it originated in Albany and Richmond. The politi- 
cians that control the two, will never yield but on compulsion. 
On adhering to it rests their scheme of power and ambition; 
and on defeating it, rests our hope of reforming the Govern- 
ment and restoring the Constitution. If they adhere, we can- 
not yield, and a split will be the consequence. In that case, I 
am decidedly of the opinion, our papers ought at once to come 
out in a call on all, who are in favour of the rights of the peo- 
ple, and against the dictation of cliques and political managers, 
to select delegates in each Congressional District, where there 
are such Districts, as the only means left the people of taking 
the power into their own hands, and out of those of their 
would be dictators and managers. I am also of the opinion, 
that the proceedings of the Syracuse Convention ought to be 
the signal to move, should it, in spite of the strong demon- 
stration against it adhere to the plan. It would make the crisis, 
which, if seized, would give us the control; but if not, it 
would pass from us to them. The bolder and more prompt 
it is seized the better and more safe. The Petersburgh Repub- 
lican should come out without delay. 

I fear my answer to Smith's letter in reply to his questions 
growing out of the Rhode Island affair, 1 may have miscarried, 
as I, as well as yourself, have not heard from him, though I 
requested him to let me hear from him, as soon as he received 
my answer. I wrote to him by the last mail, to ascertain 
whether he had got it, or not, and informed him, that if he 
had not, I would forthwith transmit him a copy. I would be 
glad 3*ou could see my answer and that of the others. I am 
strongly inclined to think, that at some stage of the contest, 
the Answers ought to be published. The principles involved 
are vital, and it is right, that the sentiments of the candidates 
should be known. I have no fear, that I would be injured. 
As far as 1 am informed everything is going on well South of 
Virginia. 

[P. S] I am glad to hear that Gilmer is right. It is impor- 
tant that Wise should go with us. His letter to your dinner 
was kind. I read the proceedings at the dinner with interest.

To Francis Wharton. 1 

Fort Hill 23 d Oct r 1843 

Mr DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for the number 
of Hunt's Magazine, which you were so kind as to send me, 
and have read the article to which you refer with pleasure. 
I am glad, that you are engaged on the subject of the com- 
mercial legislation of the U. States. It is one of deep inter- 
est and badly understood. Since the termination of the late 
war with Great Britain, that Great branch of industry has 
been most harshly treated by the Government, to use no 
stronger language. 

Of all the acts ever passed by Congress, I regard the act of 
'28, as the most indefensible and mischevous. It grew out 
of the contest between the friends of Gen 1 Jackson and M 1 
Adams for political power, and the Constitution and the 
interest of the Union was wickedly and shamefully sacrificed 
to party considerations. A full and accurate history of its 
origin, its passage and its disasterous consequences is a de- 
sideratum in our political history. 1 have often alluded to 
it in debate, but never fully. You will find a reference to 
it, which will give you some facts, in my life, published by 
the Harpers, beginning at page 32; and also in the volume 
of speeches etc printed by the same, beginning at page 3(5 
and again beginning 264, and again 372 (it perhaps would be 
well to begin with 366); but you will find the fullest account 
in a speech, not included in the volume, delivered in the 
month of March, I think, 1837 on a bill introduced by M r 
Wright to repeal certain duties in violation of the compro- 
mise act. You will find it, I think, in a file of the Intelli- 
gencer of that day. 

These references will give you much of the information 
you desire in reference to that flagitious act. To realize, how- 
ever, fully its flagitious character, it must be borne in mind, 
that the high duties which had been previously imposed, had 
been mainly to pay the debt of the revolution and the late

war, and that the country had submitted to them in the first 
instance, and had continued to bear the heavy burthen, be- 
cause they approved of the object. When that was accom- 
plished, on any principle of honor, honesty and justice, they 
ought to have been reduced to the lowest point, consistent 
with the economical and necessary wants of the Government, 
for its current expenses, after the debt was discharged. In- 
stead of that, by this act of wickedness and folly they were 
doubled on many of the necessary articles of general consump- 
tion, and the burthen of the people, instead of being reduced 
by the discharge of the debt has been heavier since than they 
ever had been before in time of peace. It is a curious fact, 
that in the only instance in which a heavy funded debt has 
been paid, that I recollect, instead of being followed by reduc- 
tion of taxes and revenue has been followed by an increase of 
both, and that in the most popular Government in the world! 
And what adds to it is the fact, that the party by whose agency 
it was effected, was that which professed the most popular 
doctrines, and the portion of the party which professed par 
Excellence to be the Democracy! I mean M r V. Buren and 
M p Wright and their friends. 

I shall be gratified in having an opportunity of perusing the 
subsequent articles from your pen, that may appear in the

MY DEAR JAMES, D r Anderson will find in my life, page

the Army proper. The same sperit* of reform was carried 
through all other branches; the Ordenance, the Engineer, the 
Indian and what may be called the civil disbursements of the 
Department. The reduction in all these were proportionally 
great; but they were never collected and reduced to tabular 
form, and it would be a work of vast labour to collect and 
compare them with expenditures of like kind, before or 
since. As the Doctor may not have seen the sketch of my

I am much gratified to learn, that you have made a condi-

To Georg 

Fort Hill 4 th Dec r 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, You did right in not answering the letter 
you enclosed to me. The writer is, as you supposed, one of 
lo[o]se political notions, as is the case with almost the whole 
body of politicians in Pennsylvania. I regret much that you 
could not make me a visit. I had much to say, that could be 
better said in conversation, than by letter. 

You are right in supposing that many of the friends of 
M r . V. B are against us on the Subject of the Tariff. Indeed, 
they have long been so, and that, in fact, has been the cause 
of all our difficulties since 1828 'till the present time. It was 
he and his friends, who formed and passed the Tariff of '28, 
and it was that measure which gave Gen 1 Jackson's adminis- 
tration a false direction, and controlled events 'till the suspen- 
sion of the Bank in 1837. M r Wright is the real author of 
that Tariff. He was on the Committee of manufactures, which 
concocted and reported it, and was its leading member. It 
was passed in the Senate by the vote of M r . V. B., Co 1 . Ben ton 
and his other friends, added to that of the National Republi- 
cans. The consequences of that wicked and oppressive meas- 
ure is to be found recorded in the political history of the 
country since. To it, all the disasters, which have befallen 
the country and the party may be distinctly traced.

LETTERS OF JOHN C\ CALHOUN. 553 

After the Suspension of '37, when V B and his friends fell 
prostrated, we refused to cooperate with them, except on the 
Subtreasury and other measures, which we had supported; or 
to join them in an Address, till they agreed explicitly to 
renounce the protective policy, and adopt our principles and 
policy generally. This they did in two consecutive addresses 
to the party. 

After the defeat of M r V. B in 1840 the whole party boldly 
and openly took our ground against a protective Tariff, and 
all the connected measures. No one was more openly and 
apparently sincerely opposed than M r . Wright. He continued 
so till within a short time before the passage of the bill of '42. 
It was not till within three or four days of its passage, that 
we heard for the first time, that he and M 1 . Buchanan had 
determined to vote for it, to our great surprise. They put 
their votes on the false and flimsy ground, that the revenue 
made it absolutely necessary that some bill should pass, and 
that was the only one which could, when they could not but 
know, it would diminish, rather than increase the revenue, 'as 
it then stood. 

Since then, there have been three State conventions held in 
N. York; the last of which was the Syracuse, which nominated 
M 1 '. V. B. The}- have all adopted resolutions on the subject of 
the Tariff as unsound as the doctrines of M r . Clay and his 
friends on the same subject. Indeed, M 1 '. Clay in his late 
letters has come up almost to the identical language held by 
the Syracuse convention. 

If to this we add, the vague language held by M 1 V. B. 
himself on the same subject, there can be no doubt that we 
shall again be betrayed, as we were in '28, should he and his 
friends again get the control. We may rest assured, that 
those who will play false to get power, will play false to 
retain it. And let me add, another betrayal would, if possi- 
ble, be still more fatal to the South, than that of '28. It 
would demoralize and break us down. The worse that could 
befal us, would be to put into power the portion of the party 
opposed to us on the Tariff. They would on that question be 
supported by the Whigs, which would make all opposition to 
it hopeless, whereas if a Whig should be elected President, 



554 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

the whole of the Democratick party would take sides with us 
to expel him from power. 

But, my dear Sir, there is another objection to M r V. B 
and his friends not less fatal, in my opinion, than the Tariff; 
I mean the mode, on which they dictatorialh r insist to consti- 
tute the Convention. It is calculated and intended to give 
the control of the nomination, to the large central states, and 
through that of the election, as far as the party is concerned. 
If it be permitted, it will give to them the entire control of 
the Executive Department, which, added to the like control 
in the House of Representatives, would give them the control 
over the whole Government. It would unite the ballot-box, 
the vote and the patronage in the same hands, and leave the 
Government without a check. 

With a clear conception of these results, it will be impos- 
sible for me, with my principles and conception of duty, to 
permit my name to go before the Baltimore Convention, con- 
stituted as it now must be. It would be to betray the Consti- 
tution and the smaller states, and weaker portions of the 
Union, that is the South. On that point, I have made up my 
mind; and I wish my friends so to understand it, in determin- 
ing what course they ought to persue. I am of the impres- 
sion, our friends in Congress ought to have an understanding 
among themselves what course ought to be taken, and when 
they have decided, it ought to be made known to all who are 
disposed to act with us over the Union. If they should decide, 
that they cannot act with those, whose opinions accord much 
more with the Whigs, on the vital question of the Tariff, than 
with us; and who insist on constituting the Convention on 
such false and dangerous principles, I shall stand by them, be 
their number ever so few, even if we should cany not a single 
State; but if they should decide otherwise, it will cause me no 
mortification or pain to stand alone, on the ground which I 
feel it my duty to occupy. The approbation of my own con- 
science, and the preservation of my character, are dearer to 
me, than any office that can be bestowed on me. In writing 
as I do, I do not desire to dictate to my friends. My object 
is simply to inform them of the course which I will feel it my 
dutv to take. 



LKiTEKS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 555 

All that has since occurred, prove the wisdom of the reso- 
lution you long since moved, to District the States for the 
election of the Chief Magistrate, and give the election directly 
to the people. The smaller states would do well to yield the 
eventual choice by the House, in order to break up that gen- 
eral ticket system, in choosing electors. The introduction of 
that system has done much to disorder and corrupt the Gov- 
ernment, and country. In fact, where many choose many it 
is no election at all. It creates the necessity of making nomi- 
nations, and those who make the nomination virtually control 
the election. I do hope that you will again introduce your 
resolutions at this session. It will give you a fine field in 
which to exercise your talents and eloquence, and display your 
principles and patriotism. 

I see the subject of Texas is destined to be one of the first 
magnitude. The interference there by Great Britain in order 
to act on our Southern institutions has presented it in a new 
and most important aspect, and so changed it, that those who 
were formerly opposed to the annexation, may well support 
it now. I think no alternative is left us, and that if the 
Executive should take a stand for it, he ought to be unani- 
mously and decidedly supported by the South. 

I can have no objection to your showing this confidentially 
to your colleague, 1 or any other friend. Give my respects 
to him, and say to him 1 shall be happy to hear from him. 
I hope to hear [missing] from you, even if your letters should 
have to be short.

Fort Hill 22 d Dec r 1843. 

MY DEAR SIR, It is some time since 1 have heard from 
you, which I attribute to the fact, that you had nothing agre- 
able to communicate. Those who expect to live on the Gov fc . 
have proved stronger than the people, and political machinery 
stronger than arguments. 

I write now to say, that I have prepared an Address 2 to my

556 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

political friends and supporters; and have sent one copy to 
our central Committee in Charleston, and the other to our 
two Senators, with a letter addressed to my friends and sup- 
porters in Congress. The Address contains my reasons for 
declining to permit my name to go before the Baltimore con- 
vention. I object to the mode in which it is constituted, and 
the Tariff principles of an influential portion of those, who 
will be represented in the Convention (principally N. Y. and 
Peny a ). 1 have reasoned both grounds pretty fully, and taken 
high grounds for my course. I have taken the step on my 
own individual responsibility, leaving my friends free to say, 
whether they will support the stand I have taken or not. My 
course is irrevocably taken. 

I have sent the two copies in advance of the publication of 
the Address, to afford the Committee and my friends in Con- 
gress an opportunity to decide on their course, before it 
appears, but have requested the former not to delay its publi- 
cation unnecessarily. I presume it will be published in 8 or 
10 days at farthest. 

I hope you will be able to make a visit to Washington, to 
aid in the deliberation of our friends. I have written u> 
Maxcy to the same effect. For myself, I have^ no solicitude 
as to their decision. I am content to stand where my Address 
places me, and to terminate my political life with it, if they 
decide so; but there ought to be a rally to save our principles. 
A run between Mr. Clay and Mr. V. B., on the issue which 
will be made up between them, will utterly demoralize the 
South, to be followed by the final loss of the good old State 
rights doctrines. I think I have shown that clearly in the 
Address, not directly, but by inference. The object now is, 
not victory, but to preserve our position and principles; the" 
only way, under [the] circumstances, by which we can pre- 
serve our influence and the safety of the South. They can 
beat us in management, but there, if true to ourselves, we can 
beat them. If Wise Rives and Grimier could be brought to 
act with zeal and concert with you, your weight will be felt 
in Virginia. The South has nothing to hope from V. B. He 
is in my opinion a doomed man, and there is no obligation on 
us to share his fate. We could not sustain him on our own 
issue, and much less could we do it on the issue with which he 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUX. 557 

must now go into the contest. I honestly believe that his 
defeat is necessary to save the party, not by our joining the 
Whigs, but by standing fast and rallied on our own ground. 



To Armistead Burt. 1 

Fort Hill 23 d Dec 1 ' 1843 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for the informa- 
tion you give me, and I hope I shall hear from you frequently 
and fully. There is now no doubt that political management 
and political machinery are too strong for the people. They 
have forced V. B. on the party against the real wishes of 
three fourths of the party, and when the workers of the 
machinery must see, at the hazard of a defeat and the over- 
throw of the party. 

I have decided to Address my friends and supporters, and 
to assign my reasons for not permitting my name to go before 
the Baltimore Convention. One copy has been sent of my 
Address to the Central Committee in Charleston, and the 
other under cover to our senators. I have written to Rhett, 
Lewis and M c Duffie, 2 and for fuller particulars I refer you to 
what I have said to them. 

We have nothing to hope from the two great factions that 
are now contending for the spoils they have extorted from us. 
The leaders of the Democratick portion are more hostile to us 
than to the Whigs, to whom they are much more nearly allied 
in policy and principles than to us. If they should ever be 
put to the test, such will prove to be the fact. 

The object now is not so much victory, as to preserve our 
position and principles, and that can only be done by keeping 
our flag flying. The object of my address is two fold; to 
put myself rectus, and the next to afford those, who agreed 
with me, a point on which to rally. I have done my duty, it 
rest[s] with them to do theirs. 

I regret to hear that Martha has been so unwell. I hope 
she is recovered ere this. I am glad you are in so pleasant a 
Mess. It will add much to yours and Martha's pleasure dur- 
ing what I anticipate will be a very long session. 

All join in love to you and her.

Fort Hill 25 th Dec* I,s4.", 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for the Maya/hif. 
and have read your article with pleasure. 2 It will do good. 
especially in reference to the great object you had in view; 
to justify the South for its course on the passage of the bill of 
1816. She was actuated by the most liberal and patriot irk 
motives on the occasion, and much she has suffered for it. 
Even those who gained by it, and have turned what was thru 
conceded to them into the means of unbounded extortion, lm\ c 
turned round and accused her of inconsistency because sin 
would not quietly submit to be plundered. 

Your plan is exceedingly judicious, and you have been very 
successful in its execution; you will reach \y\ it the under- 
standing of many, which could not be in any other way. I hope 
you will find leisure to continue your valuable labour. Thr 
cause is great. Free trade and intercourse, with the facility 
which modern improvements afford both, are destined to work 
the greatest and most happy change, which have ever taken 
place in the condition of our race. Its reaction on politicly. 
morals and religion will be powerful and most salutary. 

I am much gratified that you have prepared an article for 
the Demoeratick Review on the volume of my speeches/' 1 
could not desire it to be in letter hands. I shall be anxious 
to set* the article. If you have an European correspondent 
through whom you could have it reviewed there, in some of 
he quarterlies of established reputation, you would add to the 
obligations, under which you have already placed me. The 
conception on that side of the Atlantick is universally t'al>e in 
refenmee to our system of Government. It is indeed a most 
remarkable system; the most so, that ever existed. I have 
never yet discussed it in its higher elementary principles, or 
nit her, 1 ought to say, in reference to higher elementary 
principles of political science. If 1 should have leisure. 1 may 
vet do it.

To TJwimw ~\V. 

Fort Hill, 25 th Dec'r, 1843. 

MY DEAR SIR: My opinion has long since been made up, 
and often expressed, on the important subject to which your 
letter refers. I believe the annexation of Texas to be neces- 
sary to the peace and security of both countries, and will be 
beneficial to the rest of the civilized world, including Mexico 
herself. That it is obviously so for Texas and the southern 
portion of our Union must be admitted by all who will calmly 
and fairly examine the subject. That she will contribute 
vastly more to the general wealth and prosperity of the com- 
mercial world, without endangering the peace oT independ- 
ence of any other nation, by being annexed to our Union, 
than without it, I hold equally clear, if Mexico be not an 
exception. I hold that she is not. To my mind it is clear 
that if Texas, in her independent state, should become a bone 
of contention between us and England, it is almost impossible 
but that Mexico would be involved as a party with England, 
and that her subjugation would follow almost as a matter of 
course. 

As to the other portions of our Union, North and North - 
\\<--t. her annexation would open a wide and valuable market 
for their products, while in a political point of view it could 
not more than compensate for the vast extension opened to 
the non slaveholding States to the Pacific on the line of the 
Oregon. 

'This letter is printed in Tyler's Letters and Times of the Tylers, II, 2%, 297, from 
which it has been copied into this volume. Gilmer's letter of December 13, to which it 
is a n-ply, is printed in the same work, III, 130. Thomas W. Gilmer was a Congressman 
from Virginia, and a friend of Tyler, who made him Secretary of War in February, 1844; 
but in the same month he was killed by the explosion on the Princeton. 



560 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The objection that it would extend our domestic institu- 
tions of the South, must be met as a direct attack on the 
compromise of the Constitution, and the highest ground 
ought to be taken in opposition to it on our part. You will 
rind one of my resolutions, moved on the subject of abolition, 
in '38 or '39 I think, directly applicable to the case. I think 
it was the last of the rive I then moved. 1 I do not think there 
is anything in the ground that we acquired the country under 
the treaty of Louisiana, we had no right to cede it away, and 
that therefore it is still ours. It seems to me the true ground 
is, that the interest and safety of both countries require it, 
and that it would not be detrimental to any other. Under 
such circumstances no nation has pretext to interfere, except 
it be Mexico, and she none fairly considered. The same prin- 
ciple as was applicable to the union of England and Scotland 
or Ireland, or of these states, is applicable to the union of 
Texas with us. The proper course in all such cases is to take 
openly and boldly the true ground, and to maintain it at all 
hazard. In such a case I would rely on no refinement or 
unimportant argument, but take the broad, plain, general 
ground. 

I do not wish what I write to be published. I think it would 
rather do harm than good to publish anything from me on the 
subject under existing circumstances. It would give it too 
much the air of a mere presidential movement. Besides, I 
have ever been averse to appearing in the papers when I could 
avoid it; but I have no objection that my views should be 
known, and that you should show this to any friend } T OU may 
think proper.

MY DEAR SIR, I have received by the same mail your two 
letters to day; and as I expect to leave home tomorrow morn- 
ing early on business and to be gone 8 or 9 days you must 
excuse a short letter, especially as it is now 10 o clock at 
night and I have several letters on my table to answer. 

I have modified my Address as far as I could consistently 
with the principles on which I act, to meet the views of my 
friends. I omitted all the part which treats of the Tariff as 
one of the grounds for not going before the Convention, 
although I do not concur altogether in the objections taken 
to it. 

Its appearance has been accidentally delayed. I presume it 
will appear now in a short time. 

I wish you great success in your New paper. 2 The position 
is a commanding one, and with your great experience, and 
the advantage of the popular side of the question, I cannot 
doubt you will make a deep impression. If the party 
machinery and the spoils principles be not put down, the 
Gov fc is lost. 

But while you war against them, I hope you will not be 
silent on the subject of Free Trade. It is destined to triumph 
and is now popular in the West and a large portion of the

To R. M. T. Hunter. c. c. 



Fort Hill 1 st Feb: 
MY DEAR SIR, I have just received yours of the 19 th Jan 3 ", 
and hope this may reach you at Richmond before the meeting 
of your State Convention. 

Our friends ought by no means [to] give a pledge unless 
conditional to support the nominee of the Baltimore conven- 
tion. They ought to take the ground boldly and adhere to it, 
that they cannot support M 1 V. B or act with his friends, till 
they redeem fully the pledges given after the catastrophy of 
'37, and before the election of '40, in their Address, especially 
in reference to the tariff and abolition; and, also, their pledge 
in reference to the latter in adopting the resolutions I offered 
in the Senate, in relation to abolition. 1 You will find them in 
my life, prepared by yourself , and published by the Harpers. 
The four first were adopted by the unanimous vote of the 
party, if I recollect aright. You know the fact, I presume, 
that I, in particular, and, I believe, our friends generally 
refused to act with them as a party until 1 their open and sol- 
emn pledges were given. The resolutions take the high 
ground, that the Constitution prohibits the agitation of the 
subject of the abolition either in the District of Columbia, or 
elsewhere, on the ground that where the end is inhibited the 
means are so, and that'the right to property includes the right 
of enjoying it without molestation; and yet, in the face of these 
pledges, the great majority of the N. York delegation, includ- 
ing the confidential friends of M 1 ' V. B have acted as they have 
in the H of Representatives this session, and the Albany Argus 
has openly endorsed the course of the most prominent of them, 
M r Beardsley. It is a case of political treachery almost with- 

1 Resolution* of December 27,1837; Works, III. 140-142. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 563 

out example; and to ask our friends, under such circumstances^ 
to pledge themselves to support the nomination of M r V. B, is 
nothing short of an insult. 

It will be time enough to ask them, after their pledges are 
redeemed after a tariff bill strictly for revenue has been re- 
ported by the V. B Committee of the House, and voted and 
passed by his friends there, and the 21 st rule l restored by the 
same vote. Nothing short of it ought to be taken, after such 
an example of treachery ; nor ought any distinction to be ad- 
mitted between M r V. B and his friends; I mean his promi- 
nent and influential friends. After the repeated instances of 
treachery, from the passage of the tariff of '28 untill the pres- 
ent time, we ought to be done with promises. Nothing ought to 
he taken hut performance. 

Let our friends take this high and impregnable position; and 
refuse all pledges, except the conditional one, that they will 
support M r V. B, if those pledges so solemnly given be in 
good faith fully redeemed, before the meeting of the Conven- 
tion, but not otherwise. His friends have ample time to re- 
deem them before that, and if they do not, we have a right 
to conclude that they do not intend to do so. If the position 
be taken, as it ought, the effect will be decisive and happy; 
but to give a positive pledge to support the nominee, under 
existing circumstances, would subject us and our cause to the 
deserved Scorn of the whole Union. Our friends have already 
done much to expose us to scorn b}^ their timidity. They 
seem to forget, that a good cause is all powerful, when boldly 
defended, in the sperit of truth; but is feebleness itself, if 
defended with timidity and hesitation. The sound portion of 
Virginia must now stand fast, or agree to take the yoke. 
Ritchie and his associates are resolved to put it on them. I 
trust that even Gen 1 Gordon wil refuse to pledge himself, 
except conditionally, after what he has witnessed during the 
present session. 

One thing I do hope, that our friends will not permit their 
course to be in the least swayed by any consideration in ref- 
erence to myself or my future prospects. They ought not to 
weigh a particle, where the rights and safety of the South and

the preservation of our free institutions are involved ; and I 
shall be deeply mortified, if they should yield an inch of ground 
on their account. Indeed, it would be a great mistake, if they 
should suppose, that they would promote my interest, either 
now or hereafter, by it. The higher the ground they take, 
and the more resolutely they defend it, the better for me, as 
well as the cause of the South and the Constitution. Let them 
forget me, and look exclusively to the cause, and they will 
act in the manner best calculated to advance both. 

I am of the opinion, they ought not to think of rallying on 
me at the next election, unless it should be -found to be indis- 
pensible to keep our nag a flying, in order to preserve our posi- 
tion. It will be time enough yet to decide on that ; provided 
our friends take they [the] stand they ought, in your conven- 
tion, and refuse to give pledges. But unless M r V. B's friends 
shall redeem their pledges, and make up an issue thereby with 
M r Clay and his friends, which we can support on our own 
principles, it appears to me a seperate rally will be indispen- 
sible to save them. A run between him and M r Clay, on the 
issue as now made up between them, would demoralize and 
ruin the South, whatever side we may take. 



To Francis Wharton. 1 

Fort Hill 4 th Feb: 1844. 

MY DEAR SIE, Before this reaches you, you will have seen 
my Address. I hope "the tone and bearing" may meet your 
approbation. I confess, it required great effort to restrain my 
indignation at the course of M r V. B and his friends. It 
has been treacherous and mean beyond any example in the 
political history of our country. 

We stept forward, generously and patriotickly, to save him 
and them from utter prostration at the extra session of 1837; 
not, indeed, for his or their sake, but for that of a measure, 
on which he was thrown by the course of events. We refused 
to go one step farther in his support, untill his friends pledged 
him and themselves twice, openly, in their Address, before 
the election of 1840, to our principles and policy generally,

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 565 

and especially on the subjects of the Tariff and Abolition. To 
make the pledge more binding in reference to the latter, 3: 
movefd] a set of resolutions in reference to it in the Senate, as 
strong as I could draw them, condemning agitation itself as a 
violation of the Constitution. The four first of which were 
adopted by the unanimous vote of the party. You will see 
them in my life published by the Harpers. Under the force 
of these pledges, we supported his election and saved him 
from complete and final prostration. Without our aid, he 
would have got scarcely the vote of a single State. We did 
more. After his defeat, we took the lead in the overthrow 
of the Whigs; I acting as chairman of the Standing Com- 
mittee in the Senate, which planed and carried on the cam- 
paign. Our success was complete. The Whigs were routed 
in two months, and would have remained so, if M r V. B had 
not been brought forward. Now, after all this, and profit- 
ing by our aid, to turn round in violation of all these open 
and solemn pledges, to court the Tariffites and Abolitionists, 
after they had secured our support, as they thought, by ob- 
taining a majority of the Convention, is an instance of treach- 
ery hard to be equalled. 

But it is not the only instance, in which they have been 
guilty of flagrant treachery. The act of '28 was passed by 
the same party (M r Wright taking the lead in the House and 
M r V. B in the Senate) by a violation of pledges not less 
strong, though less open, an act which deprived the country 
of the fruits of the great victory achieved over the national 
party that year, and to which the disasters which have since 
befallen the country and party may be clearly traced. After 
such repeated examples of perfidy, it is impossible for me to 
repose the least confidence in any promise, which they may 
hereafter make; and it required no little exertion on my part 
and no small influence on the part of my friends to restrain 
me from saying so. No consideration, or influence could 
restrain me from saying less. With my views of the Con- 
stitution, I could do no act that could countenance a usage, as 
they call it, intended to supercede in practice the fundamental 
compromise of the Constitution. To destroy or supercede that 
would be to revolutionize the Government. 

The present indication is, that M r V. B will be defeated.

It is impossible for me or my friends to support M r Clay and 
the Whigs. We are the opposites in all things; but I am not 
certain whether his success is not necessary to save the Repub- 
lican party. Certain it is, that his course has raised the 
Whigs to their present power, and 1 fear if he succeeds it will 
but contribute to the entire discredit of the Republican party 
and the permanent ascendency of the Whigs. I see the Demo- 
cratick Review has not published your article. I suppose 
political reasons have prevented it. I do hope that if it 
refuses, you will not let it be lost. I am sure the Southern 
or some other liberal Review would be glad to publish it. 



To James Edward Calhoun. 

Fort Hill 7 th Feb 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I have written to the Editor of the Mercur} 7 
to correct the statement, that my name was withdrawn by 
myself. I could not do it consistently with the position I 
occupied, which was a passive one (neither to decline or seek 
the office); nor with my Address, which simply withheld my 
name from the Baltimore convention, leaving my friends and 
supporters to decide what course ought to be taken, under 
circumstances, in reference to both themselves and myself. 
Indeed, my principal object in transmitting it to the central 
Committee of the State, was to give them, as the representa- 
tive of my friends and supporters in the State, an opportunity 
to decide in advance, what that course ought to be. I had 
concluded to make up my mind to abide by its decision, be it 
to support me or not; and be their motive what it might; 
for it would be in vain for my name to be continued before 
the people, unless heartily supported by my friends in the 
State. In its decision I must be content; but it must be their 
decision, and so announced; and I have accordingly requested 
the Mercury to state the fact, if the withdrawal was made on 
its authority. To that extent, it is my duty to go, but I can 
go no farther. To go beyond, and insist on my friends to 
hold on, would be, on my part, inconsistent with my position 
and Address, and, with every deference for your opinion. 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 567 

improper. Not that I doubt, that the true policy for my 
friends would be to hold on and to keep our flag a flying; not 
however from any hope of my being elected, but for the 
important object of keeping our position and preventing our- 
selves and cause from being merged in a wretched struggle, who 
slwuld have the spoils plundered from ourselves. Be assured, 
that you are deceived, if you should think, that anything 
beyond that, is to be hoped for in the contest. I am the last 
man that can be elected in the present condition of the coun- 
try. I am too honest and patriotick to be the choice of any- 
thing like a majority. The Philadelphia convention will be 
an abortion, and, if it should not, it will present a miserable 
struggle between Johnson's, Cass, Tylers and my friends, for 
a barren nomination. I can never consent for my name to go 
before a convention, after what I have seen. No; our only 
course is to rally on our own ground, be our number few, or 
many; or to withdraw and stand aloof from the fraudulent 
game. The great point for me, is to preserve my cliaracter in 
these corrupt and degenerate times. That may be of service 
hereafter; not to run again as a candidate, but in some greater 
emergency. Things cannot go on in the direction they are 
taking much longer. A split between us and the northern 
Democracy is inevitable, unless we should prove [to] be the 
most base and submissive people on earth, or they should 
reverse their course on the Tariff and slave questions, which 
I do not expect. You need not fear, that I shall ever permit 
disgust to influence me. I am proof against that. All other 
influences have long since been merged with me, in my publick 
conduct, except those from duty and devotion to country. If 
I know myself, I would cheerfully lay down my life and glory 
in it, to preserve our free institutions, or save the South from 
distruction. 

As to the result of the present contest, I see nothing that 
can prevent the success of the Whigs, as things stand. I 
have no doubt, but Clay will easily beat V. B; and, perhaps 
that result, though we cannot aid it, is the only way by which 
the Republican party can be purged of spoils men and be 
regenerated. 

All join in love to you and Maria.

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 10 th Feb. 1844 

DEAR SIR, 1 received by the last mail yours of the 26 th Jan y . 
I did not answer yours of an earlier date, in consequence, in 
part, of my absence from home when it was received, and 
waiting, after my return, for the publication of my Address 
and to see what course events would take. 

In conformity with your urgent desire and that of several 
other friends, I omitted the part, against my own judgement, 
in reference to the Tariff. Your wish, and those who thought 
with you on that point, was limited to that; but not so with a 
much larger . portion of my friends. They entertained the 
hope (a vain one I am sure) that they could compel the friends 
of M r V. B. to redeem their pledges, in reference to the Tariff 
and Abolition, and were adverse to taking any step, which 
would lead to a seperation. This giving away, was so exten- 
sive at Washington and acted with such force from that 
point on this state, or rather on the Committee in Charleston, 
that I soon saw there was little hope, that the position I took 
would be backed by the Committee. -The result is such as 
you have seen. The withdrawal of my name was without 
authority from me, and was neither consistent with the Address 
or the position that I had taken in the canvass. It was for 
them and my friends and supporters to withdraw it, and not 
myself, if they should think proper. I have written to the 
Editor of the Mercury to correct the error; not that I wish 
my name to be continued before the publick (far otherwise) 
but I wish to avoid the imputation, to which the unauthorised 
withdrawal on my authority might expose me. I write this, 
however, in strict confidence, as 1 wish no conflict with the 
Committee or an} 7 of its members. 

I am now disentangled from the fraudulent game of President 
making, and hope never to have to do anything with it again. 
It is abhorent to my feelings and taste. The truth is, that both 
of the great parties have degenerated from their original stand- 
ard so far, that they have ceased to represent their original 
principles. The Whigs are the old federal party turn[edj 
demagogue a thing most abhorent to their original char-

LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 569 

acter; the Democrats are the old Republican party turnfed] 
spoils men, a thing equally abhorent to their original char- 
acter. It would be still more in conformity to facts, to say 
that they, or at least the V. B. wing, are the legitimate off- 
spring of the Burr school of politicks, and that in his and their 
triumph, the school of Burr has triumphed over that of Jef- 
ferson. 

I cannot think in the present state of parties of entering 
again on the political arena. I would but waste my strength 
and exhaust my time, without adding to my character, or ren- 
dering service to the country, or advancing the cause for 
which I have so long contended. I feel no disgust nor do I 
feel disposed to complain of any one. On the contrary, I am 
content, and willing to end my publick life n[ow]. In looking 
back, I see nothing to regret, and little to correct. My inter- 
est in the prosperity of the country, and the success of our 
peculiar and sublime political system when well understood, 
remain without abatement, and will do so till my last breath; 
and I shall ever stand prepared to serve the country, when- 
ever 1 shall see reasonable prospect of doing so. 

I write vou in the confidence of an old friend. 



To James Ecfauard Calhoun. 

Fort Hill 14 th Feb. 1844 

MY DEAR SIR. . . . The course you are for taking, I 
have no doubt is the one, that ought at first to be taken, and 
I had prepared my Address on that supposition; and urged oir 
the Committee a prompt publication. But I soon found, it 
was altogether too high to be sustained by a large portion; 
much the majority; and among them many the most intelli- 
gent and devoted. I modified, as far as I could consistently 
wit h my principles my Address to meet their views, and releive 
them from embarassment. I could not do less, without still 
further dividing, distracting and weakening the South. 

But, whether the course was right or wrong at first, it is 
now entirely too late to be thought of, and cannot be taken 
without doing great mischief to the cause and causing much 



570 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

embarassment and injury to myself. My mind is so deci- 
sively made up on the point that I cannot permit it, and should 
it be persisted in I should feel myself compelled to come out 
in disapprobation of it. I hope, therefore, that the proposed 
meeting in Abbeville will not take place, and, if it should, 
that there will be no action such as you suggest; and I rely on 
your friendship to arrest it, or give a different direction to its 
proceedings, if it be too late for that. 

The great mass of my friends and supporters, who disagree 
with the course you are in favor of, still hope, that the party 
will redeem their pledges, both in reference to the tariff and 
Abolition; and that the pressure to compel them to. do so, will 
be greatly increased by the ground we now occupy. They 
farther think, that it will be time enough to take hostile 
ground, and rally under our own flag, after it is ascertained, 
that their pledges will not be redeemed. I confess, that I have 
little faith, that they will, or that any effective rally can be 
made, if they should not be; but still, as I cannot doubt their 
fidelity and sincerity, I am certain, that our true policy, under 
existing circumstances, is to give to those, who take the view, 
time and opportunity to give it a fair trial. If it fails, as I 
apprehend it will, in both particulars, one thing is certain, it 
will lead to the defeat of V. B. by the universal disgust it 
will excite against the perfidy of his friends. Let me, now, 
entreat you to give up your contemplated movements, and to 
remain quiet for the present, at least. There can be no move- 
ment, in this state, at this time, which will not call in question 
my sincerit}^ in making the declaration, that I would be con- 
tent, let my friends decide as they would. Every movement 
in the state, which would indicate discontent, would be attrib- 
uted to me. You cannot oblige me more, than in acquiescing 
in these views. I must preserve my character above all sus- 
picion for candour and fair dealing. It is all important to 
myself and to our cause. I care nothing-for the Presidency, 
except for my friends and the country, but much for my char- 
acter and standing both now and hereafter. 

I shall be anxious to hear from you. Write without delay.

To Francis Wkarton. 1 

Fort Hill 22 d Feb: 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read the article in the Democratick 
Review 2 with much pleasure. The manner and the matter both 
do you much credit. If a half a dozen men of leisure and 
education, North of the Potomac, would follow your example 
a revolution might be made in the publick sentiment of that 
portion of the Union, which would sa^e the country and our 
truly wonderful and sublime system of Government. As it 
is their fate is doubtful. One thing, however, is certain, 
things cannot much longer progress, as they have for the last 
fifteen years. In consequence of the false direction the Albany 
party have given, the overwhelming majority which brought 
Gen 1 Jackson into power has wasted away. They have done 
more to raise up the Whigs and depress the Republican party, 
than all the other causes combined. They have even made 
Clay formidable in the South; a thing that nothing else could 
have done. 

I nope, that my Address has not departed far from the line 
you approve. To meet the wishes of a large list of friends, I 
modified it as far as I possibly could, without losing my posi- 
tion, and becoming a partisan, which nothing could induce me 
to do. Had I consulted my own feeling and judgement, I 
would have tendered the issue at once and specifically, fulfil 
your pledges or lose our support. Nothing, I fear, but another 
defeat still more signal can reform the Albany wing of the 
party. They are essentially spoils men.

try; but I do not think, in my present position and under 
existing circumstances, I could be of any service in the Senate. 
It is in the power of the V. Buren leaders in Congress, to 
settle the only two questions of pressing importance, as they 
please; I mean the Tariff and abolition. They will settle both 
simply in reference to the presidential question. If the} r 
should conclude, that the chance is, that M r V. B will get 
more votes by favoring the abolitionists and the friends of 
the Tariff, they will be settled in their favour, against any- 
thing that I can do, and in violation of all their pledges, were 
they ten times more numerous than they are. My opinion 
may appear uncharitable; but it has been forced on me by a 
thorough Knowledge of the party, founded on long observa- 
tion and much experience. I have lost all faith in them, I 
mean the leaders. If we wish to control them, there is but 
one way; and that is to satisfy them how many votes they 
have to gain or lose by taking this or that way on any ques- 
tion, in which we have an interest. We must show as fixed 
a determination to defend our property and our safety, as the 
friends of the tariff and the abolitionists do to assail them, 
which I fear, from all I can see, is far from being the case. 
If I thought the South w^ould sustain me in taking the course, 
which the occasion demands, I would make the sacrance and 
brave the hazard, as great as they might be, to repel the 
attack on their property [and] safety. But I see no prospect 
of that at present, and am unwilling to exhaust the few years, 
that remain to me, in vain efforts. I hope to appropriate 
them more satisfactory to myself, and more useful to them in 
the quiet of a private station, in which I am content to spend 
the rest of my (Jays.

countenance, nor shall I take any part whatever in reference 
to it. 

The conduct of the Northern Wing of the Democrats ap- 
pears to me to be outrageous on the abolition question, after 
the solemn pledges which they gave before the election of 
'40, in reference to it; and I must say, that I regard with sur- 
prise, that the deceptive vote of laying the question on the 
table by one vote, should be regarded as a triumph by some 
of our Southern friends. It is obvious that it is but a trick, 
in the infamous scheme of endeavoring to catch the abolition 
votes, without offending the South, and ought to be so treated. 
I am glad to see that you took the high ground you ought in 
your speech. It would be better by far to bring the question 
at once to issue, than that we should be made the dupes and 
victims of a fraudulent game. Sound policy and self respect 
leave to the South but one course; to hold M r V. B. and his 
friends to their pledges, both in reference to the tariff and 
abolition. It would be the extreme of weakness and folly 
to attempt [to] exact new pledges, while the old, openly and 
solemnly given, remain unredeemed.

MY DEAR SIR, No one has greater cause to be distressed by 
the astonishing events of which your letter conveyed the 
intelligence, than myself, except the families and the immedi- 
ate connections of those, who fell by the fatal explosion. 2 It 
deprives me of old and tried friends, to whom I was strongly 
attached, and whose places I can never hope to supply. But 
my loss, as great as it is, is nothing compared to that of the 
publick, especially the South, and by the death of M r . 
Upshur, at this critical moment. No one feels it more, in 
that respect, aside from our personal relations, than I do ; and 
among other reasons, that his death, at this time, should, in

your opinion and that of other friends, create a necessity for 
my returning again to publick life. 

When I resigned my seat in the Senate, I intended to close 
my publick life, unless the voice of the people should freely 
call me to take charge of the administration of the Govern- 
ment, or the occurence of some great calamity should 
clearly demand my return to it, as a duty; neither of which 
had I any reason to anticipate. Acting in conformity with 
this fixed intention, I have appropriated the rest of my days 
to my entire satisfaction; and among other things, to a task, 
which I am very desirous of executing, and to do which, 
would engross all the spare time, on which, at my period of 
life, I have a right to calculate. No consideration of a per- 
sonal character could possibly induce me to break my arrange- 
ment, and return to publick life. As far as I am concerned, 
mine is closed, to my entire satisfaction. I have done my 
duty to the countiy. I have devoted the prime of my life to 
its service, and to the best of my abilities endeavoured to pro- 
mote its interest. I have done so, because it was my duty, 
without looking to any reward beyond; and aside from 
duty, neither Government nor people can bestow any reward 
on me, which could induce me to return to publick life. 

Whether, then, I ought to accept the place, to which you 
refer, if offered, is with me exclusively a question of duty. 
To do so would be a great personal sacrifice. In addition to 
the reasons already assigned, it would break up for a tempo- 
rary employment all my family arrangements, and wha,t adds 
to the difficulty, I have no hope that I could possibly induce 
M rs Calhoun again to return to Washington. 

But as a question of duty, I do not feel, that I possess the 
requisite information to decide satisfactorily. The only pos- 
sible reason I can see for accepting the Department, should it 
be offered, as far as duty is concerned, is limited to the pend- 
ing negotiations relating to Texas and Oregon. They arc 
both, I admit, of vast importance ; especially to the West and 
South ; and if a satisfactory termination of one or both should 
be thought on reasonable grounds, to depend on my accepting 
or not, 1 feel it would be a strong case of duty. But is there 
any such reasonable grounds? Is there reasonable hope, that 
a treaty for annexation, such as ought to be acceptable to both 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 575 

Governments can be made with Texas, and that the Oregon 
question, can be settled on grounds, that ought to be mutually 
acceptable to the United States and Great Britain ? And if so, 
is there reasonable grounds to believe, that any service of mine 
v:ould be important either in the negotiation of the treties, 
or in carrying them through successfully? If so, I do not see 
how I could withould my services, if required by the Presi- 
dent ; and if he should desire it, I leave it to you and General 
Anderson, who has also written, and with whom you have con- 
sulted, with such friends as you may think proper to consult, 
to decide for me. If, in that case, you should decide, that my 
service is important, I will give it to the utmost of my abili- 
ties to the administration and the country. 

But the way in which it should be given is a matter of no 
small importance, at least to myself. I have stated, that I 
could see no motive, which could induce me to go into the 
State Department, except the pending negotiations. It seems 
to me, that if my services should be required as important in 
reference to them, it would be better, at least it would be far 
more agreeable to me, and break less on my arrangements, to 
take charge of the negotiations, or aid in conducting them, 
without taking charge, at the same time, of the State Depart- 
ment. I can see no such necessary connection between them, 
as to require both to be united in the same person. On the 
contrary, there appear to me to be -strong reasons, why a Sec- 
retary, who has just entered on the duties of his office, and 
who is unacquainted with its duties, should not be exclusively 
charged with such high and onerous duties, as that of discharg- 
ing the duties of his office and conducting two such negotia- 
tions would impose on him. It would be impossible for him, 
under such circumstances, to discharge them all satisfactorily. 
As it has been a rule with me, not to undertake to perform, 
what I could not well and conveniently execute. With my 
impression I would have strong, if not insuperable objections 
to undertake to discharge the duties of the Department under 
such circumstances. What then would be altogether the most 
acceptable to me, should my service be deemed important, 
would be to receive an appointment to take charge of the nego- 
tiations, either seperately or in conjunction with whoever 
might be appointed Secretary of State, or might be the most

Fort Hill 15 th March 
MY DEAR ANNA, . . . The next item of news relates to 
myself, and is to me far from being of an agreeable character. 
I have been offered the State Department, and owing to the 
two important negotiations now pending, in reference to the 
annexation of Texas and settling the Oregon question, and I 
am strongly appealed to through M r M c Duffie and others to 
accept. The appeal is to my patriotism and magnanimity, 
and in behalf of the South. My repugnance to accepting is 
every way great. I have in answer stated strongly such 
leading reasons for wishing to decline, as I could with 
propriety, with the expression, in strong terms, of the hope 
that I might be spared the sacrifice ; but that, if on a review, 
my friends should think my services cannot be dispensed 
with, without hazard, that I Avould accept an appointment to 
negotiate the treaties, seperately from the Department, if 
such an arrangement could be made with propriety; but if 
not, I would accept the latter, as averse as I am to it, with the 
understanding, that I should be at liberty to resign as soon as 
the negotiation was over. On a full surve} T of all circum- 
stances, I did not see, that I could, without loss of character 
and standing give any other answer; but I accompanied that, 
with a strong wish, that the President might be able to make 
some other satisfactory arrangement. 

I. expect to hear the result in 12 or 13 days. If I cannot 
get off, I shall set out as soon as it is announced, that my name 
is before the Senate. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 577 

To John Tylet\ l c. c. 

Fort Hill March 16 th 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I received by the Mail of yesterday your 
letter of the 6 th Inst written in the Morning, and informing 
me that you had nominated me to fill the vacancy in the State 
Department occasioned by the lamented death of Mr. Upshur, 
and your note of the same date written in the evening, that 
the Senate had unanimously confirmed the nomination. 

1 highly appreciate the honour you have confered on 
me, in selecting me to fill the Department, at a crisis, when 
two such important negotiations are pending, and the very 
flattering manner the nomination was confirmed. 

It is with great reluctance that I return again to publick 
life; but, under the circumstances, I do not feel myself at 
liberty to decline the appointment. But as nothing short of 
the magnitude of the crisis, occasioned by the pending nego- 
tiations, could induce me to leave my retirement, I accept on 
the condition, that when they are concluded, I shall be at 
liberty to retire. 

I shall forthwith commence making my arrangements to 
leave home for Washington, and hope to be able to take my 
departure this day week or da\ r after to-morrow week at 
farthest, by the speediest conveyance. 



To Thomas G. Clemson* c. c. 

Fort Hill 16 th March 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote Anna by the last mail down, and 
among other items of news, gave her what has occured in 
reference to the State Department, and suggested the possi- 
bility I should be forced to accept, however reluctant. Very 
unexpectedly the next mail up brought me the intelligence 
of my nomination and confirmation, accompanied by twenty 
or thirty letters, one from a Whig New England Senator, 
urging in the strongest terms my acceptance, and saying that 
it was the unanimous sentiment of all parties, that I ought.

strained in self-defense to adopt the measure in question, the 
Government of the United States will shun no responsibility 
which justly attaches to her conduct. 

I will, by the first opportunity, communicate with you fur- 
ther and more fully on the subject. 



To Josiah Quincy.* 

Department of State, Washington, May 3 rd , 1844. 

SIR: By a letter recently received from the Rev. Allen 
Greely, Pastor of the Congregational Church, at Turner, Ox- 
forde County, Maine, I have been informed that a catalogue 
of the Library of Harvard College, has been published in five 
volumes; containing indications of many maps, Collections of 
Treaties, and other works, the examination of which might 
be useful to the Government, especially in its negotiations 
with Foreign Powers. As the copy of the catalogue in the 
Library of this Department is in four volumes, published in 
1831, it appears, that either a supplementary volume, or a 
new addition of the whole, has since appeared. 

Mr. Greely also informs me that there is in the Library of 
Harvard College a map with the following title a New and 
accurate map of North America (wherein the errors of all 
preceding maps respecting the Rights of Great Britain, 
France, and Spain, etc. are corrected) by Huske, Thomas 
Kitchin Sculpsit, London, 1775 [1755]. 2 

These documents may serve to throw some light on the 
issues pending between this Government and Great Britain; 
and I should feel under many obligations to you, Sir, if they 
could, through your instrumentality, be procured for the use 
of this Department, under such conditions as you may think 
proper to prescribe. They might be forwarded by mail or 
otherwise at the expense of the Department.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 581 

To Richard Pakenkam. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 6 th May, 18M 

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 
letter of the 16 th ultimo, requesting information in respect to 
the terms upon which this Government is permitted to send 
its correspondence across the Isthmus of Panama. 

I have, in pursuance of 3^our suggestion, referred your 
communication to the Postmaster General, and now enclose 
to you a copy of his reply. 

It is proper to add that in March, 1843, Congress made a 
small appropriation, to be expended under the direction of 
the Secretary of State, " for defraying the expenses attending 
the conveyance and forwarding, by land, and of the receipt 
and delivery of mails, letters, and despatches at and between 
Chagres and Panama," and the Diplomatic representative 
of the United States at Bogota, under instructions from 
this Department, accordingly addressed a representation to 
the New Granadian Government with the view of obtaining 
its express consent to the establishment, under proper regu- 
lations for the prevention of frauds upon the revenue of the 
country by the persons engaged in the carriage of these mails, 
of an occasional post between those places, under the direc- 
tion of agents of the United States. No definitive reply was 
made to this application; and, as it was presumed that no 
serious objection could be urged against the measure pro- 
posed, the Consuls of the United States at Chagres and Pan- 
ama, were subsequently directed to take upon themselves the 
duty of Despatch Agents at those ports, for the purpose of 
carrying into effect the object of Congress in making the 
appropriation of funds above referred to. 

In the mean time, a conventional arrangement on the sub- 
ject has been entered into with the Government of New Gra- 
nada, which has just reached this Department. This postal 
convention will be forthwith submitted to the Senate of the 
United States for its consideration and advice, and so soon as 
it shall have been approved and ratified by the respective

your possession, for the information of Her Majesty's Gov- 
ernment. 1 



To Fernando Wood. 9 

Department of State, Washington, 8 th May, 1844. 

SIR: You are hereby appointed Despatch Agent for this 
Department at a compensation of $800 per* annum for the 
services including all ordinary expenses, as stationary, etc. 
To enable you to discharge which the following statement of 
the principal duties with which you are charged, as also instruc- 
tions for their performance is given. 

Viz. The receipt of Despatches arriving by the Packets 
from Liverpool and Havre, or by any other conveyance, and 
their immediate transmission by mail (unless otherwise directed) 
to this Department. 

The transmission of Despatches from this Department to 
the Legations and Consulates abroad. For this purpose it 
will be necessary for you to make an arrangement with re- 
spectable American citizens, passengers in the packets or 
steamers to Liverpool and Havre, to take charge of the De- 
spatches and to deliver them free of expense to the Consuls 
there. They will for this purpose be invested with the char- 
acter of bearers of Despatches, and you will be furnished with 
blank passports to be filled for them as such. It will also be 
necessary for you to make an arrangement with the Post Office 
at New York by which all Despatches directed to your care 
may be immediately delivered to you, in order that there may 
be no delay in their transmission, or loss of opportunity of 
the vessel for which they may be intended. It will be well to 
keep advised of all anticipated departures of vessels, so that 
advantage may be taken of the earliest opportunities that may 
occur. A tabular account is to be kept of that portion of 

1 Convention signed at Bogota, March 6, 1844; ratifications exchanged December 20.

2 Original in the archives of the Department of State; Domestic Letters, Vol. 34; text 
derived from an official copy. Fernando Wood (18 12-1881) had lately represented New 
York in Congress 1841-1843. Subsequently he was several times mayor of New York, and 
representative in Congress. He was preeminently distinguished as a political manipu- 
lator. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 583 

Despatches from hence which may be numbered on their envel- 
ope, noting the numbers of those received, and the date and 
mode of their transmission: a copy of which is to be trans- 
mitted monthly to this Department. 

In case of the detention of Packets at Quarantine, the 
Despatches are to be sent for at the expense of the Depart- 
ment, and an arrangement may be made with the owners or 
commanders of newsboats who may board the Packets, for 
bringing in, and delivering to you, the Despatches (if by such 
mode 3 T ou expedite their transmission) for this a reasonable 
compensation may be made, which will be allowed to you in 
your account. The despatches from this Department will 
consist generally of communications to the Ministers and 
Consuls of the United States abroad, and of books, printed 
documents and newspapers for those Officers. 

It is desirable to save expense in the transmission, as far as 
may be consistent with safety and the requisite despatch. 
Those intended for Consuls are not usually of an urgent 
nature, and are, therefore, to be sent by vessels sailing direct 
to ports of the Consuls residence, or if no such opportunities 
offer, to the ports from which they may be most readily 
transmitted; in which latter case, they are to be sent to the 
care of the Consuls, with a request that they may be for- 
warded by the first vessel, or in some other suitable and 
economical manner, to those to whom they are addressed. 
When communications for Consuls are to be sent otherwise, 
particular instructions will be given. 

Despatches for the Minister at Madrid and Paris are to be 
sent to the Consul at Havre, who will forward them. But 
when the package for the Minister at Madrid consists of 
Books or printed papers they are not to be sent to Havre, but 
for Madrid, to the Consul at Cadiz. Despatches for the Min- 
ister at Constantinople are to be sent by the way of Gibraltar. 
Despatches for the Ministers in England, Russia, Sweden, 
Denmark, Prussia, the Netherlands and Belgium are to be 
sent to the Consul at Liverpool, b}^ whom they will be trans- 
mitted to the Minister at London, who will forward those 
intended for the Continent. Despatches for the Minister in 
Portugal are to be sent to the Consul at Liverpool when there 
is no opportunity of sending them direct to the Consuls at 



584 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Lisbon or St. Ubes. Books and printed papers are to be s^ent 
only by vessels for those ports. 

Despatches for the Consuls at Tangier s and Tunis are to be 
sent to the Consul at Gibraltar. Thrse for the Consul at 
Tripoli to the Consul at Malta. 

Those for the Minister at Mexico to the Consul at Vera Cruz, 
between which place and New York there are regular Packets. 

Those for the Minister at Guatemala to the Consul at Kings- 
ton, Jamaica, or by vessels for Balize or Omoa. 

Those for the Minister at Bogota, to the Consul at Cartha- 
gina, and when no direct opportunity offers, to the Consul at 
Kingston, who will forward them to the Consul at Carthagina. 

Those for the other Legations on the American Continent 
to the most convenient Consul as occasions may offer: but 
where the Minister resides at the port to which the vessel is * 
bound they will be sent direct to them, and not to the Consul. 

No letters or papers are to be transmitted in the Despatch 
Bag or packages, except those sent by the Department, unless 
specially directed. No endorsement, note or stamp is to be 
put on Despatches received by you to be sent abroad. A list 
of the Despatches is to be sent with them to the Consul. You 
will keep yourself early informed of vessels about to sail from 
the principal ports in the United States, to those to which you 
have despatches to forward, arid where there is time, advise 
the Department of them. It is important that the Department 
shall receive its Despatches as early as practicable after their 
arrival, and you will adopt such measures as may enable you 
to obtain them as early as private letters are obtained, and you 
will transmit them immediately by mail, or, if too late to be 
enclosed in the mail, they may be sent by the same convey- 
ance, or by some passengers at the same time. All reasonable 
and necessary expenses incurred in obtaining or transmitting 
Despatches early will be allowed. 

In sending Despatches to the Department, you will state the 
day of the sailing of the Vessel by which they were brought, 
when you can ascertain it. You will keep a Register of the 
Passports which may be given by you to bearers of Despatches, 
and will make returns of them to this Department, so soon as 
delivered, stating the number and date of the Passport, and the 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 585 

name of the person to whom it is delivered. On each pass- 
port you will note the number and address of the packages 
delivered to the bearer. This is necessary in order to prevent 
any abuse on his part, by representing- as public Despatches 
packages which are not so. it may perhaps be necessary to 
add that the duties imposed on you are of a confidential nature, 
and that it is necessary for you to transact the business con- 
fided to you in that light, and carefully to keep all Despatches 
in your possession. I enclose open letters for the Post Master 
and Collector at New York, asking such aid on the part of 
their respective Offices as may be necessary to the prompt 
discharge of your duties. 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 10 th May 1844 

MY DEAR ANNA, 1 am indebted to you one letter and to M r 
Clemson two. As I have to write a dozen of letters to yours 
and his one, you and he must be content with my paying off 
scores, with you both, with one, and that not a long one. 
Between business and visiters, I have but little time left for 
correspondence. 

A letter from Washington must almost of course begin with 
politicks. Every thing, there, is in confusion with the de- 
mocracy at present. V. B's letter 1 has completely prostrated 
him, and has brought forward a host of candidates in his 
place; Buchanan, Cass, Stuart, Johnson, who, with Tyler and 
V. B. himself, make six, whose claims are to be settled at 
Baltimore on the 27 th ins*. To add to the confusion, there 
will be two conventions, Tyler's and the old V. B's; and two 
parties, as opposed and hostile to each other as Whig and 
Democrat; the one in favour of, and the other opposed to the 
immediate annexation. So there is a fair prospect, that con- 
fusion will be worse confounded. 

In the meane time, I stand aloof. I regard annexation to be 
a vital question. If lost now, it will be forever lost; and, if

Texas ; the letter is printed in Niles, LXVI, 153-157. 



586 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

that, the South will be lost, if some prompt and decisive 
measure be not adopted to save us. I would prefer Tyler to 
any northern man at present, because, I think, the South will 
be safer in his hands; and because, as far as annexation is 
concerned, I regard his claim as the strongest; but my aim 
will be to obtain union among the friends of annexation. If 
that can be done, the whigs will be beaten. It is the all 
absorbing question, stronger even than the presidential. It 
is, indeed, under circumstances, the most important question, 
both for the South and the Union, ever agitated since the 
adoption of the Constitution. So much for politicks. 

Say to M r Clemson, that I have not had time to see the 
Postmaster General in reference to the change he desires to 
make in the route of the post from Edgefield to Newberry. 
I will devote the first leisure hour to it, if he should deem it 
necessary, after the piece of intelligence I have to give him. 

I saw the President day before yesterday, and asked him, 
if he had disposed of the mission to Belgium. He said he had 
not, and that it was at my disposal. I named M r Clemson to 
him. He readily assented; so that, if he desires to fill it, it is 
at his service. 1 The present Charge will leave in August. It 
is near to Paris, and, I suppose, will suit him better than the 
one to Naples, which will not be vacant till next year. He 
must let me know soon. Say also to him, that I would be 
glad to oblige M r Barton, but I have find it necessary to estab- 
lish it as a rule, not to interfere with the appointments in the 
other departments, in order to prevent them interfering with 
mine; and I am averse to giving countenance to that system 
of turning out and putting in, which has been introduced in 
the Custom Houses. If, however, any fair opportunity should 
offer, I will take pleasure in serving him. . . . 

My health is good, notwithstanding a cold accompanied 
with a good deal of cough, as is usual with me, when I have a 
cold. Patrick is well. I hope you. all continue so. 

My love to M r Clemson. Kiss the dear children for grand- 
father. 

1 President Tyler on June 17 nominated Mr. Clemson as charge d'affaires to Belgium, 
and the nomination was confirmed. 



LETTEKS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 587 

To Edward Everett.^ 

Department of State, Washington, 16 th May 1844 
SIR: It appears from the accompanying transcript of a 
letter from Mr. Shepard Gary to this Department, of the 11 th 
instant, that a company composed of American citizens and 
British subjects, some time since erected a boom across the 
mouth of the Aroostook, and within the province of New 
Brunswick, for the security of the owners of logs and other 
lumber manufactured upon that river and its tributaries. The 
assent of Maine was afterwards prospective!} 7 given, with cer- 
tain limitations, by a resolve dated 3 d March, 1843, (copy en- 
closed) to an act of incorporation by the authorities of New 
Brunswick, extending to the corporators the right to erect 
such boom; and at the last session of the Provincial Legisla- 
ture, an act of incorporation was accordingly obtained embrac- 
ing the restrictions and conditions contained in the resolve of 
Maine, subject to the approval of the home Government. 
Maine and New Brunswick having thus signified their assent 
to the measure, the Provincial act has, it is understood, been 
sent to England for the purpose referred to, and the citizens 
of Maine, who have much larger interest in the timber trade 
on the Aroostook, are desirous that your good offices should 
be employed in endeavoring to attract to this subject the 
prompt and favorable notice of Her Majesty's Government. 
I have, therefore, to request that you will, in informal con- 
ferences with her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for 
Foreign Affairs, and by such other means as you may deem 
best calculated to attain the end in view, use your best efforts 
to promote the object of Mr. Gary's application. 

You will also receive herewith copies of certain papers (of 
which a list is annexed) relative to an act of the Parliament of 
New Brunswick, passed on the 25 th day of March last, impos- 
ing an export duty of one shilling (twenty cents) per ton on 
all timber shipped from any port in that province, and releas- 
ing all claim for the right to cut timber on the Crown lands. 
A communication on the subject has been addressed to this 
Department by certain citizens of the State of Maine, com- 

1 Original in the archives of the Department of State; Instructions to Ministers to 
Great Britain, Vol. 15 ; text derived from an official copy.

plaining of the proposed exaction as an infringement of the 
letter and spirit of the stipulations contained in the 3 d article 
of the treaty of Washington, of the 9 th of August, 1842; going 
into an argumentative examination of the construction to be 
given to that article, and of the nature of the rights secured 
by it to the citizens of the United States; and asking the 
intervention of this Department with the British Govern- 
ment to defeat this measure of the provincial Parliament. 

As a perseverence in this policy by the British Provincial 
Authorities must seriously and injuriously affect the interests 
of many American citizens, and as the proposed exaction 
appears to be in obvious violation of conventional stipulations 
existing between the United States and Great Britain, you 
will lose no time in calling the attention of Lord Aberdeen to 
the subject, with a view to procure the total abandonment of 
this policy on the part of the Province of New Brunswick, 
and the adoption by Her Majesty's Government of such 
measures as shall insure, hereafter, a strict observance of the 
obligations of the treaty. 



To James H. Hammond. 1 

Washington 17 th May 
MY DEAR SIR, I discovered shortly after I enclosed you the 
letter of M r Pakenham, that the wrong one was by accident 
transmitted. I will thank you to return it. The one intended 
related to a man of the name of Brown, who had been con- 
demned for enticing away a negro, but who it was discovered 
had been pardoned. M r Pakenham wrote me a private note 
in reference to his case, originating in the request of some of 
his friends in Ireland. 

The fate of the treaty is not yet decided. The prospect is 
that it will be rejected; but I am not without hope, that the 
Senate will approve. 2 There is not a doubt in my mind, that 
if Texas should not now be annexed, she is lost to our Union. 
The Senate has been furnished with evidence to that effect,

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 589 

perfectly conclusive. I hope, that it may change the votes of 
the Whig Senators from the South and West, especially if 
backed by a strong expression of publick opinion in favor of 
annexation in those Sections. It is to us a question of life 
and death. Every city, town, County and District in the 
South and West should speak out promptly and loudly. 
Strange as it may seem, Benton and his wing object to the 
admission among other things, because in my letter to M r 
Pakenham, I should dare place the issue where it does! This, 
with many other things, clearly prove, that V. B was courting 
the abolitionists. Thank God both of them lie prostrate, 
never to rise. They have done the party and country infinite 
mischief. 

My letter 1 was intended to lay the foundation, on which to 
stand in the future progress of the correspondence. 1 shall 
rise at every step untill England shall be placed on the defen- 
sive. I only ask the South to stand by me. Now is the time 
to vindicate and save our institutions. If this tide is lost we 
shall never have another. Why do you all, I mean our men 
of influence and leisure, like yourself, not put in your pens 
at this great crisis ? Our papers ought to be crowded with 
animated communications.

letters which appear to contain the information called for by 
the former portion of the Resolution. 

The latter part of the Resolution enquires ' i whether the 
Treaty concluded between our Government and Denmark in 
1830, in pursuance of which $650,000 were paid by Denmark 
to the Government of the United States in satisfaction of all 
claims, which had heretofore been preferred by Citizens of 
the United States, on the Government of Denmark, did, in its 
execution, embrace the claim to indemnity for the aforesaid 
prizes sent by Commo. John Paul Jones into Bergen; and if 
not so included, are the claimants to those prizes excluded, 
by the terms of that Treaty, from further claim on the Gov- 
ernment of Denmark. 7 ' 

In regard to the enquiry embraced in the latter part of this 
resolution, the Secretary of State is unable to perceive any- 
thing in the Treaty which would bar the Claim in question.

MY DEAR SIR, ... I am glad to learn, that you will be 
at the Convention. 1 Its proceedings will be pregnant with 
much good or evil. You must make a point to take Wash 
ington in your way. It will be indispensible, I should see 
you, in order to explain what is the actual State of things 
here. Without that it will be impossible to act intelligently 
and with effect; and it would be difficult to give you a full 
explanation within the ordinary limits of a letter. 1 will

claim of John Paul Jones against the Danish Government, in 
which he holds a certain interest, I have the honor to inform 
you that the present Diplomatic representative of the United

indemnity therefor, but that no decision has yet been made 
known to this Department. 

For fuller information on the subject, I beg to refer you to 
the correspondence recently communicated to the House of 
Representatives in answer to a Resolution dated on the 22d 
ultimo respecting these claims. 



To Francis Wharton. 1 

Washington 28 th May 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I am always gratified with the free expres- 
sion of the opinions of my friends. 1 infer from your re- 
marks, that you are of the impression that I am some how or 
other connected with M r Tyler in reference to the Presidential 
election. Nothing is farther from the fact. I have no under- 
standing, or connection with him whatever in reference to it. 
I accepted the office I hold with the utmost reluctance, and 
with an express declaration on my part, that I accepted it 
wholly in reference to the pending negotiations and that I 
should be at liberty to retire as soon as they were closed. I 
came here resolved to take no part in the presidential election, 
or the party politicks of the day unless forced by circum- 
stances over which I could have no control to do so. The un- 
expected opposition of M r Clay and M r V . B to the Treaty, and 
the wholly unjustifiable assaults on me by the friends of the 
latter, have compelled me to oppose him and them, which I 
have done decidedly; and to that extent, and no farther, have 
I interfered. Their course has made a thorough reorganiza- 
tion of the party necessary, and when I say their course, I do 
not refer simply to it in reference to Texas, but on the sub- 
jects of the Tariff and abolition, on both of which they have 
identified themselves with the Whigs, and that in violation of 
the most open and solemn pledges often given.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 593 

If the Texas question to a northern eye does not appear 
sufficiently sustained by the documents, I must think, it is 
owing to the fact, that that portion of the Union has not duly 
weighed the danger to which the movements and avowed 
policy of Great Britain in reference to Texas would, if con- 
summated, expose the southern and western states, and the 
obligation which this Government is under to defend them. 
I must say, that I fear from what I see and hear, even from 
the enlightened and well disposed at the North, that the zeal, 
which the South has ever evinced to defend the North, when 
her interest is involved, will never be reciprocated on her 
part. On three memorable occasions, the war of the Revolu- 
tion, that of 1812, and the threatened war of the Maine 
boundary, when the interest of the north was mainly 
involved, we evinced a zeal not less than her own, for her 
defence. In none of these cases, had we any particular or 
local interest, yet we did not on that account hold back. 
Even in the local question of the Maine boundary, which 
involved a few hundred thousands of acres of barren land, 
we came up unanimously to the rescue; but now, when for 
the first time we ask for defence; when our very safety is at 
stake, the great body of the enlightened portion of the North 
either hold back, or oppose. There is something wrong in all 
this, and not a little ominous to the duration of our system. 
If our safety and the great interest we have in maintaining 
the existing relation between the two races in the south, are 
of no estimation in the eyes of our northern friends if they 
see neither insult nor danger, in the Declaration of the Earl 
of Aberdeen, in reference to that relation, in connection with 
Texas, it is time we should know it. If they are insensible or 
blind to our danger on that vital point, they may rest assured 
we are not. 

I think you will find, when you come to look in to the facts, 
that you have permitted Co 1 Benton's unfounded assertions to 
make an erroneous impression on your mind. His whole 
speech 1 is a mass of contradictions, resting on baseless assump- 
tions, as I think you will see, should [you] read the replies, 
which have been made to him. He, and, I must say, M r Clay

and M r V. B, have involved themselves by their course in a 
web of contradiction, from which they can never extricate 
themselves. 

As to myself, I am of the impression, if we shall have the 
folly or wickedness to permit Great Britain to plant the lever 
of her power between the U. States and Mexico, on the 
Northern shore of the Gulph of Mexico, we give her a place 
to stand on, from which she can [brave?] at pleasure the 
American Continent and control its destiny. There is not a 
vacant spot left on the Globe, not excepting Cuba, to be seized 
by her, so well calculated to further the boundless schemes of 
her ambition and cupidity. If we should permit her to seize 
on it, we shall deserve the execration of posterity. Reject 
the treaty, and refuse to annex Texas, and she will certainly 
seize on it. A treaty of alliance commercial and political 
will be forthwith proposed by Texas to her, and I doubt not 
accepted. This for yourself. 



To William S. Archer. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 6 th June, 1844. 
SIR : In reply to your letter of the 3 rd instant, asking for 
information in regard to the Sardinian mission, I have the 
honor to state that the motives for the establishment of that 
mission, and the advantages to be anticipated from diplomatic 
relations with Sardinia will be found clearly set forth in the 
papers accompanying the Treaty of commerce with Sardinia 
communicated by the President to the Senate, on the 24 th 
January 1839, 2 to which I beg leave to refer you. It may be 
proper to observe for the information of the Senate that 
Genoa, the Commercial capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia is 
the largest commercial Emporium in the Mediterranean. It 
is the principal point from which the smaller ports of Italy, 
the Levant, and Africa are supplied with the Colonial prod- 
ucts of this hemisphere.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 595 

Before the Treaty of 1838, the United States had compara- 
tively, very little commerce with Sardinia, but that Treaty 
having encouraged our commerce by giving to it all the advan- 
tages which were previously enjoyed by national vessels, our 
trade there has been rapidly on the increase, as will be seen 
by the accompanying abstract from the Consular returns of 
Genoa, from 1830 to 1843 inclusively. By this Treaty unusual 
facilities for the transit of the products of the United States, 
without liability to any duty, were secured, and the corre- 
spondence of this Department goes to show that many cargoes 
of tobacco imported into Genoa have been carried in transitu 
through Sardinia into Lombardy and other places. American 
vessels arriving in Sardinia usually take in a part of a cargo 
consisting of medicinal articles, marble, in block or manufac- 
tured, olive oil, etc., and then proceed to the ports of Sicily 
and the Levant, of Spain or of France to complete their car- 
goes, so that return cargoes are rarely entered as coming from 
Genoa or Nice which are the two principal ports on the con- 
tinent. Our importations from the Kingdom of Sardinia con- 
sist, principally, in manufactured silks estimated at about 
8,000,000 francs per annum and are received in transitu through 
France by Havre. The population of the Kingdom of Sar- 
dinia 5,000,000. The greater portion of the supply of tobacco 
for that Country is of American growth, the culture of the 
article being entirely suppressed. Formerly the article of 
Cotton consumed in that Country, the growth of the U. States, 
reached its destination by the way of England, but the removal 
of the very onerous quarantine regulations which served to 
repress all direct commerce with America having been removed 
since the } 7 ear 1838, the importation of that article has been 
constantly on the increase. 

It is believed that the commerce between this Country and 
the Kingdom of Sardinia, considerable as it has already become, 
is susceptible of steady and important increase, not only in 
raw products, but also in the cotton manufactures of the 
United States. Hitherto the coarser manufactures of cotton 
for the poorer classes in Italy have been chiefly furnished 
from England, but as we already compete successfully with 
her in other parts of the world, in the supply of coarse cot- 
tons, it is believed that an extensive market will be found in 



596 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

the Mediterranean for similar goods of our manufacture. In 
view of the foregoing facts and considerations, as well as of 
others, which will be obvious to all, it is the opinion of this 
Department that the public interests require that the Mission 
to Sardinia should be maintained. 



To Richard 

Department of State, Washington, 10 th June, 
SIR: I have received the letter which you did me the honor 
to address me on the 22 d ultimo, acquainting me that you had 
been instructed to enter into communication with the Govern- 
ment of the United States with a view of ascertaining whether 
it would be agreeable to this Government that an arrangement 
should be concluded for the transmission through the United 
States of the mails to and from Canada and England, which 
are now landed at Halifax, and thence forwarded through 
British Dominion to their destination referring to the mutual 
advantages likely to arise from such an arrangement and 
expressing your readiness, should the Government of the 
United States accede to the principle of the proposed arrange- 
ment, to concert with such person as the President may be 
pleased to designate, detailed measures for the complete exe- 
cution of the plan. 

I have not failed to refer to the Postmaster General, a copy 
of j^our communication, and have now the pleasure to send 
to you a copy of his reply. As it appears, however, that no 
authority is vested in the Post Office Department to meet the 
wishes of the British Government on this subject, an applica- 
tion to Congress for the requisite powers to conclude the 
arrangement became necessary; and the President accordingly 
transmitted to the House of Representatives, on the 7 th instant, 
a transcript of these papers, with a message recommending 
the proposition to their favorable consideration, and bespeak- 
ing for it prompt attention. 2

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 597 

To John Tyler. 1 

Department of State, Washington, June 14, 1844. 
To the President of the United States. 

The Secretary of State to whom was referred the Resolution 
of the Senate of June 12, 1844, (in executive Session) request- 
ing the President "to cause the Senate to be informed 
whether Duff Green has been paid any money out of the 
Treasury of the United States, or out of the contingent 
fund for Foreign intercourse, for services rendered since the 
4 th day of March in the year 1841: and if so, how much? and 
also, whether the said M r . Duff Green has further known 
claims or demands for such services?" has the honor to report 
to the President that the amount of expenditure paid out of the 
fund for the contingent expenses of Foreign intercourse, from 
the 1 st of Dec. 1840, to the 1 st of December 1843, together 
with the names of the individuals to whom the payments were 
made, as well as the objects of such payments, maybe seen by 
reference to the Letter of the Secretary of State to the Speaker 
of the House of Representatives dated Dec. 9, 1841, (Doc. No. 
4, State Dept.) and a report made by the Undersigned to the 
chairman of the Committee on the Expenditures of the Depart- 
ment of State (in answer to a resolution of the House of Rep- 
resentatives,) dated April 8, 1844, (Rep. No. 484, H. of Reps.) 
From these documents it appears that, on the 3 d day of Nov. 
1841, there was paid to M r . Duff Green, out of the Fund for 
the contingent expenses of Foreign intercourse, the sum of 
$500.00 as Bearer of Despatches to London and Paris. And 
ugain on the 9 th day of December 1842 there was paid to the 
same individual, out of the same fund, the sum of $500 for 
expenses and compensation as bearer of despatches to Paris. 
These items include all the payments, which appear from the 
files of this Department to have been made to M r . Duff Green 
from the first day of December 1840 to the first day of Dec. 
1S4-3, and since this last date, it does not appear that any 
amount has been paid by this Department to the said Green, 
nor any evidence on its files that he has or holds further claims 
or demands for services against it.

To Robert 



Department of State, Washington, 17 th June, 1844. 

SIR: The Senate having advised, and consented to, your ap- 
pointment, as Charge d' Affaires of the United States to Sar- 
dinia, 2 I herewith transmit to you, your commission in that 
character. 

Your despatches of the 17 th , 21 st and 30 th of March, the 
last communicating the opinions of the American Consuls at 
London and Liverpool, on the subject of protests, to which 
the two former despatches related have been received. A 
reference to the Treaty of Commerce, which subsists between 
the United States and Sardinia, will show, that there are no 
principles in it, which were intended to, or can overrule, or 
control, the established municipal law of that Country, in re- 
gard to the admissibility of evidence in any of His Sardinian 
Majesty's Courts, or to the forms to be observed by Captains 
of American vessels arriving in the ports of Sardinia; unless 
such regulation should operate in favor of the national or any 
other flag to the disadvantage of our own. 

However onerous and peculiar the requirements of the Sar- 
dinian Government may be in these respects, it must be obvi- 
ous that we have no just ground of complaint. It is certainly 
the duty of the American Representative to use every exer- 
tion to procure modifications in the law r s and regulations 
of the Country in which he resides, calculated to facilitate 
commerce and simplify the formal proceedings required upon 
the entry of American ships; but, at the same time, acting 
under higher and more general considerations, the greatest 
care should always be taken by him, never to vex and annoy 
the Government to which he may be accredited, by present- 
ing to, or urging upon, it claims that may be regarded as 
either unreasonable or dubious. 

By an examination of the list of books, and documents, 
given in your No. 2, of the 17 th February, it is perceived that 
your Legation is supplied with all volumes allowed by the 
Department.

Department of State, Washington, June 26, 1844. 
SIR: I have the honor to transmit to your Excellency, here- 
with, the copy of a letter recently received from the British 
Minister at Washington, enclosing, with a view to the ful- 
filment of the 4 th Article of the treaty of August, 1842, and 
with reference to the application of this Department, authen- 
ticated copies of certain grants of Lands situated on the south 
side of the St. John's river and within the territory of the 
United States, communicated to him for this purpose by the 
Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick; and at the same 
time acquainting me that an act has been passed by the Legis- 
lature of New Brunswick to enable the Government of that 
province to carry into effect the provisions of the article re- 
ferred to, in respect to lands situated on the North side of the 
river and within British Territory. 



To Charles J. Ingersoll* 

State Dept 2 d July 1844 

Mr DEAR SIR, It is not contemplated to remove the Consul 
at Buenos Ayres at present. The application of M r Moss for 
the place will be put on file and will be duly considered 
should a vacancy occur. 

The concerted and active interference of the English and 
French Governments against the Annexation of Texas can- 
not be doubted. I do hope the information of what they are 
doing may be received in such a form as to enable the Presi- 
dent to lay it before Congress. 

As far as I can learn the South is becoming very excited 
and united on the subject. I see Brownson's 3 quarterly has 
a short, but very good article on the subject.

To John Southgate. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 12 th July, 1844 
SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 
the 6th instant. The claim to which it refers is presumed 
to be that on the late Government of Colombia on the case 
of the Schooner Ranger which was adjusted by the Conven- 
tion between Mr. Moore and the Minister for Foreign Af- 
fairs of that Republic on the twenty fifth of November, 
1829. The amount of the claim as recognized in that Conven- 
tion was five thousand one hundred and thirteen dollars and 
fifty-nine cents with Interest at six per cent from the second 
of August, 1825, until paid. That Republic separated soon 
after the date of the Convention into the three states of which it 
was composed. This made it necessary to demand payment of 
those States according to the proportions of the debts of Colom- 
bia which they severally assumed. Fifty per cent was accord- 
ingly demanded of the Republic of New Granada through the 
Charge d' Affaires of the United States accredited to that Gov- 
ernment and in 1837, the New Granadian Congress appropri- 
ated four thousand three hundred and Twenty one dollars for 
the pajnnent of its share of the indemnification due in the case 
of the Ranger. This sum is believed to have been paid in the 
course of the summer of 1839, by the authorities at Santa 
Martha to M r . Robinson, the Consul of the United States 
at that place, who remitted the amount to M r . Fred. Vin- 
cent of Norfolk. It appears that with a letter from this 
Department to M r . Semple, Charge d' Affaires of the United 
States at Bogota of the 4 th of September, 1838, a power of 
attorney from Augustus Martin, John Rushill and William 
B. Manning to Frederick Vincent and another power from 
M r . Vincent to M r . Semple and M r . Gooding of Bogota in rela- 
tion to this case was transmitted. It also appears from M r . 
Semples dispatches, that M r . Robinson remitted the money to 
M r . Vincent in obedience to M r . Semples directions. The 
Republic of Venezuela was accountable for twenty-eight and a 
half per cent of the claim. This was demanded through M r . 
Williamson, the Charge d' Affaires of the United States at

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 601 

Caracas and an appropriation for its payment was made during 
the Session of the Congress of that Republic of 1838, 1839. 
From a letter of this Department to M r . Vincent of the 5 th of 
March, 1839, it appears that the expediency of his executing 
a power of Attorney authorizing some person at Caracas to 
receive the money from the Venezuelan government was sug- 
gested. It is understood that he complied with the suggestion 
by empowering M r . Williamson for that purpose. The money 
was received by M r . Williamson in the course of the summer 
of 1839, and remitted to M r . Vincent by a bill of exchange 
which was contained in a sealed letter from M r . Williamson 
to him. Mr. Williamson's despatch transmitting that letter 
through this Department, bears date the 6 th of August, 1839. 
The precise amount paid by Venezuela is not mentioned in 
any paper in the Department but may easily be computed from 
the data given above. The balance of the claim amounting 
to twenty -one and a half per cent is still due by the Republic 
of Ecuador. 



To Frauds Wharton. 1 

Washington 14 th July 18M 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been so incessantly engaged with my 
official duties untill recently, as to compel me, in a great 
measure, to neglect my private correspondence, which will, I 
hope, satisfactorily explain, why I have delayed so long to 
ackowledge yours of the 31 st May. 

I regard the nomination of M r Polk to [be] the best, that 
could be made under all the circumstances. It has done much 
by freeing the party of the dangerous control of what may be 
called the New York Dynasty. Another four years of its 
control, after a restoration, would well near have ruined the 
party and country. ' A more heartless and selfish body of poli- 
ticians have rarely ever been associated together. I was much 
gratified with M r Dallas' nomination. My friends every where 
will give the ticket a hearty support; and I have strong hope 
it will succeed. The intelligence, as far as my information 
extends, is favourable. . . .

602 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

To R. M. T. Hunter. c. c. 

State Dep* 30 th July 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I would be much gratified to have it in my 
power to contribute to meet M r Greenhow's l wishes. I highly 
appreciate his worth and qualifications, and the strength of his 
claims on myself and family; and yet I can scarcely venture 
to hold out any hope either to him or his friends. 

The claims on the part of M r Tyler's political and personal 
friends on him are pressing; and it is naturally to be expected, 
that he would give them a preference, especially as many of 
them have had their expectations excited for a long time. It 
is difficult under such circumstances to press any one of my 
friends on him successfully however great his qualifications. 
Acting, as I suppose, under the force of the circumstances 
alluded to, he makes most of his appointments on his own 
responsibility without consulting the appropriate Department. 
This, however, is in strict confidence. 

What I have said goes on the supposition, that there may 
be a vacancy in the place of charge. I have no reason to think, 
that will be the case shortly; and if there should be one, there 
can be no out fit till one is voted by Congress at the next 
session; so that on the whole, the prospect is not encouraging. 
. The idea that Texas will afford as many non holding States, 
as Slave holding is perfectly idle. The Southern boundary of 
the U. States, in that quarter is the Arkansaw river, West of 
the 100 th longitude, from London. The compromise line is 
the 36 th latitude. The part of Texas north of it is a small zone 
of worthless land. Benton was so conscious of it, that his 
proposition was to form two non Slave holding states, lying 
west of the Two eastern, to be Slave holding, and to be ex- 
tended quite down to the Gulf. 

Walker and others of our friends here, who attend to the 
progress of events, as connected with the election, are very 
sanguine of the success of Polk and Dallas. They count 11 
states as certain for them and not more than 4, or 5, or 6, at 
the utmost, for Clay. Of the 11 they do not include Louisana, 
Georgia, Tennessee Indiana, N. C. Maryland, or New Jersey.

I think the result doubtful; but if we are defeated Benton V. B. 
and Wright are the responsible party. 

There has been a very respectable review of my volume of 
Speeches in the Democratick already. I doubt whether it 
would publish another. Would ; t not be better to publish 
your Nephew's in the Southern Literary Messenger? The 
point to make a favorable impression is Virginia. I would 
rather have her support, than any three in the non slave 
holding. 



To Edward Everett.^ 

State Department, Washington, 12 th Aug., 1844. 

SIR: While I was engaged in preparing my despatch No. 
99, relating to the extradition of the fugitive slaves, who, 
after committing murder and robbery in Florida, escaped to 
Nassau, in the Bahamas, it became necessary for me to look 
into the correspondence in relation to the case, when, for the 
first time, Mr. Upshur's despatch No. 69, and yours in answer 
to it, No. 90, came under my notice. 

You conclude your despatch by informing the Department 
that, if you should receive the instructions alluded to in your 
conversation with the Earl of Aberdeen, you would lose no 
time in forwarding them to Washington, and that if, after a 
reasonable interval, you should not hear from him, you would 
again call his attention to the subject of his (Mr. Upshur's) 
despatch No. 69. Since then the Department has neither 
received the instructions alluded to, nor heard from you in 
reference to the subject. 

The object of addressing you now is, to call your attention 
to the subject. It is regarded as one of deep interest, and 
involving a very important principle. 

In your account of the conversation between yourself and 
the Earl of Aberdeen, in reference to the subject of Mr. 
Upshur's despatch, you state, that he remarked in reply to 
your observation in reference to the views of the laws of 
nations applicable to such cases as the Creole, which were

604 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

maintained in his despatch, that he doubted whether the in- 
structions given to the Colonial Authorities enjoined them to 
adopt a course in conformity with those views; adding, '"that 
it was impossible for Her Majesty's Government to make the 
slightest compromise on the subject of slavery; and that when 
slaves were found within the British jurisdiction, by whatever 
means, or from whatever quarter, they were, ipso facto, free." 
If it be the meaning of his Lordship, that Her Majesty's 
Government cannot make the slightest compromise of the 
principle that, when slaves are found within the British juris- 
diction, they are, by the fact itself, made free, as is to be 
inferred he did, from the latter part of his remarks, we have 
no desire or intention to controvert it. The laws of Great 
Britain declare the fact to be so, and we do not question her 
exclusive and absolute right of legislation on that or any other 
subject, within her own jurisdiction. But if it be his meaning, 
that a vessel of the United States having slaves on board, and 
passing from one of their ports to another, would cease to be 
under the jurisdiction of the United States, and be within that 
of Great Britain, if she should be carried into the waters or 
harbor of one of her adjacent colonies, by the force of the ele- 
ments, or by the revolt of the slaves on board taking posses- 
sion of the vessel after overpowering the crew and murdering 
the commander, as in the case of the Creole, or by any other 
overruling and irresistible necessity, so as to subject the slaves 
on board to the operation of the act of Parliament, for the 
emancipation of slaves within the British dominions, then it 
would be the operation of a principle which we maintain to be 
in direct conflict with the laws of nations, with the admission 
of Lord Ashburton in his correspondence with Mr. Webster 
in negotiating the treaty of Washington, and the express un- 
derstanding under which that treaty was accepted and ratified. 
While we admit the full and absolute right of Great Britain 
to legislate for her own subjects, within her own dominions, 
we never can admit, that she can, by any act of her's, change 
the laws of nations, or divest us of a particle of right, which 
we can justly claim under them. Nor can we admit, that our 
vessels, when forced into her waters under the circumstances 
above stated, cease to be under our jurisdiction, or come under 
her's, so as to change the relations of the parties on board, or 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 605 

to divest them of their property. In such cases, the higher 
laws of humanity, by the concert of all civilized nations, inter- 
vene and overrule the municipal laws of the place at least to 
that extent, not to insist, as we might, that the duties of good 
neighborhood require that each should, as far as possible, so 
regulate its own affairs as not to interfere with the rights and 
commerce of the other. 

I cannot believe that his Lordship, when he said that Her 
Majesty's Government could not make the slightest compro- 
mise on the subject of slavery, could intend to extend the 
remark to cases of this kind; and I am happy to have my 
belief strengthened from his reply to your remarks, subse- 
quently made, alluding to an expression used by Lord Ash- 
burton in his correspondence with M r . Webster in reference 
to the point immediately in question. 

All we ask is, that such instructions shall be given to those 
exercising authority in the colonies in our immediate neigh- 
borhood enjoining them that in executing the act of Parlia- 
ment for abolishing slavery within the British dominions, 
that they shall conform to the assurances given by Lord Ash- 
burton in the correspondence above referred to, and the 
principles of the laws of nations in such cases. It is England, 
and not we, that has made the change in the condition of the 
negro portion of her population, which has led to the diffi- 
culty; and we have a right to insist that she shall adopt such 
proper precautions, as to prevent the change from injuriously 
affecting our rights or security.

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you and enclosed my measure, and 
franked a package to you from M r Markoe and mailed in time 
to reach N. York the evening before you sailed. I hope you 
received them on time. I now enclose a package from Gen 1 . 
Hamilton put under cover to M r King who I presume will 
receive it before you arrive at Paris. I received a letter 
yesterday from M r Boisseau and one from M r Mason of

Boston after their return from the Argo, and was happy to 
learn that you had so fine a start and were all in such good 
sperits. I hope you may find the voj^age agreeable through- 
out. I shall be anxious to hear of your arrival at Paris. 

Nothing new since I last wrote. I had a letter from home 
and one from Willey dated at Millwood, after the return of 
himself and his uncle from Glen's Springs. All were well at 
home; and Willey wrote that his health and that of his Uncle's 
had improved. 

I have been exceedingly engaged in preparing dispatches 
for the Steamer for the last 8 or 10 days; and have just 
finished. I send out by her two very important to M r Everett 
and one to M r King. That to the latter and one of the two 
to M r E are very long, and I think they are both calculated 
to make a strong impression. One of those to M r E is on the 
subject of the Seven Slaves in Florida, who after escaping 
from their masters and murdering and robbing in their way 
took shelter in Nassau, whence they were demanded and re- 
fused to be given up under the Ashburton treaty. The ques- 
tion involved is. whether it is a case within the provisions of 
the treaty. That I think I have established beyond contro- 
versy. The one to M r King relates to Texas and presents I 
think some very interesting views in relation to it, which I 
think will be felt in Europe. 1 

My health remains good, though I have not yet got 
entirely clear of my cold. 1 expect to leave between this and 
the 20 th Inst for home and may be gone 5 or 6 weeks. 

My love to Anna and the children; and prayers for the 
health and happiness of you all. I received your's and her 
letter, written the day before you started. 



To Richard Pakenham* 

Department of State, Washington, Aug. 23, 1844. 
Right Honorable R. PAKENHAM, etc. : 

The Undersigned Secretary of State of the United States, 
has the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a note addressed 

1 Letter of August 12, 1844, to William R. King, United States minister to France; printed 
in Calhoun's Works, V, 379-392. 

2 Original in the archives of the Department of State, Notes to British Legation, Vol. 7; 
text derived from an official copy. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 607 

to him by the Right Honorable M r . Pakenham, Her Britannic 
Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, 
of the 27 th of April last, stating that information had been 
received by his Government that two American citizens 
charged with the murder of a British subject, master of the 
brig " Naiad", were, in the month of December last, delivered 
up by the Haytian Government to the Commander of the 
United States brig "Bainbridge", to be tried by the tribunals 
of this country. 

In reply, the Undersigned has the honor to transmit, here- 
with, to the Right Honorable M r . Pakenham copies of certain 
communications addressed to this Department by G. F. Usher, 
United States' Commercial Agent at Port au Prince, in the 
Island of Hayti, together with other documents (numbered 
from 1 to 10 inclusive,) which present all the material facts in 
the case referred to. 

From these and other papers, or proces verbaux, consisting 
of notes of examination of witnesses, depositions, warrants, 
decrees of courts, and other judicial proceedings, duly certi- 
fied by the Haytien Authorities at Gonaives, it appears that 
on the evening of the 31 st of July, 1843, Daniel Hays, master 
of the British brig fct Naiad ", in company with several other 
persons, came on board the United States brig " Zebra", 
Samuel S. Thomas, master, then lying at anchor in the port 
of Gonaives ; and, after some conversation with the said 
Thomas, (those who accompanied him in the mean time con- 
versing apart with the crew,) left the vessel and returned to 
shore. That previous to this visit, Captain Thomas had been 
informed by the Commander of the British barque "'Eliza 
Killick ", that Hays was endeavoring to excite his crew to 
mutiny, or to seduce them from his employment. That about 
10 o'clock at night of the same day, Hays came alone in a boat 
alongside the "Zebra", and, being hailed and warned off by 
the Captain, retired. An hour afterwards he again approached 
the vessel as before, was again hailed, but returned no answer. 
At the same time one of the crew of the " Zebra ", in a mutinous 
spirit, encouraged him to come on board, and proffered him 
assistance; but, the Captain promptly interfering, the boat 
again left the vessel, and returned to shore. 

On the next day, August 1 st , the master of the "Zebra" 



608 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

went on shore ; and, after conferring with the consignees of 
his vessel, informed some of the authorities of the place of 
the facts and solicited the aid of a guard; which not being 
granted, he employed the services of a Haytien to assist him 
in preserving subordination amongst his crew. At about 9 
o'clock P. M. of the same day, a person approached the ship 
in an open boat, as on the night previous, who proved to be 
Captain Hays, the Master of the Brig " Naiad." He was 
hailed, but returned no answer. One of the crew of the 
"Zebra" again invited him to come on board, with promises 
of aid. He was warned to desist from his obvious purpose, 
and, being threatened, returned an answer of defiance, at the 
same time lifting something from the boat and pointing it 
towards the deck of the "Zebra", as if in the act of firing. 
At this moment the Haytien on board, with or without 
orders, discharged his piece, and Hays fell mortally wounded. 

The day after these events, Captain Thomas, his mate, Cur- 
tis, and the Haytien, were arrested; and after an examination 
before the authorities at Gonaives, committed to prison, where 
they remained until the 12 th of December, 1843, (frequent 
though unheeded applications being made in the mean time 
by the United States' Commercial Agent at Port au Prince 
for their trial or discharge,) when, on the demand of the com- 
manding officer of the United States' brig "Bainbridge", that 
they should either be brought to trial, or released, they were 
formally delivered up to him. 

Such appear to be the principal and well established facts 
of the case. Other circumstances are also adduced in evi- 
dence which leave no doubt that Hays had corrupted the crew 
of the " Zebra"; that his object in those night visits was to 
take them to his own vessel then lying at the mouth of the 
harbor ready for sea; and that the act of killing being in self- 
defence, was one of justifiable homicide. 

The Undersigned is not disposed to controvert the princi- 
ple asserted by the Right Honorable M r . Pakenham in regard 
to the jurisdiction of independent States over offences com- 
mitted within the limits of their respective territories. As a 
general rule, the principle is readily admitted; but the facts 
and circumstances attending the case under consideration 
would seem justly to constitute it an exception to such rule; 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 609 

and when the long confinement of the accused, the revolu- 
tionary state of the country, the unsettled condition of the 
Government within whose jurisdiction the offence is charged 
to have been committed, and the prospect of indefinite impris- 
onment arising from the intestine commotions of the Island 
prevalent at the time, are considered, the conduct of the Com- 
mander of the "Bainbridge" in demanding the trial or 
enlargement of the prisoners, seems to be warranted by the 
duty which every Government, under such circumstances, 
owes to its citizens. 

The Undersigned, in reply to that part of M r . Pakenham's 
note which suggests that the individuals charged with the 
offence should again be arrested and brought to trial, deems 
it proper further to remark that the courts of the United 
States have no jurisdiction in cases like the present, nor can 
an arrest be lawfully made. It may, however, be proper to 
state that, in the present case, the individuals charged with 
the murder were, on their landing at Pensacola, brought 
before a criminal court in the territory of Florida, duly 
arraigned, and upon an examination of the testimony certified 
by the Haytien authorities at Gonaives, fully acquitted and 
discharged from custody. 



To William Wttkim. 1 

Department of State, Washington, Sept. 4, 1844. 

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 
note of the 22 d ultimo, in reference to your claim against the 
Government, for expenditures incurred while Minister Resi- 
dent at St. Petersburgh. 

The well established rule of the Department, at the time 
when the claim was first made, did not admit of its allowance; 
and acting on this rule my predecessors Messrs. Forsyth and 
Upshur, decided against it. Office-rent at the period referred 
to, was not allowed except to our Ministers at London and 
Paris, and this rule has been invariably adhered to, except in 
the cases to which you refer, of Messrs Van Ness and Eaton.

The reasons which induced Mr. Webster to adopt a different 
rule in these cases are unknown to me. I cannot however 
concur with him in its propriety, as it tends, directly, to open 
anew long settled accounts, and I have invariably declined to 
act upon it, in the cases submitted to nry decision. 



To Ogden Hoffman. 1 

Department of State, Washington, Sept. 10, 1844 
SIK: The Department of State has received information 
from several quarters that the Mexican Government has two 
armed steamships in the port of New York, and that the 
Commanders are enlisting crews, and procuring Military 
Stores and equipments, in that city and elsewhere. The 
object of this note is to call your attention to the subject, and 
to urge the strictest scrutiny in regard to their proceedings. 
No doubt is entertained that the object of these preparations, 
is the invasion of Texas; and it is important that our laws of 
neutrality should be strictly observed. It may be well, there- 
fore, that you institute enquiries, and use your best exertions 
to ascertain, whether the existing laws have been violated, 
and if so, to take immediate steps to bring the offenders to 
justice. In order to afford a clue to your investigations, I 
enclose you extracts from two letters just received at the 
Department. 



To William W. Irwin.* 

Department of State, Washington, 13 September, 1844. 
SIR: The attention of this Department has been again called 
to the subject of the Danish Sound Dues. The information

States to the question of the Sound Dues, see Wheaton's International Law, 184, his 
History of the Law of Nations, 158, and the treaty of April 11, 1857, by which the matter 
was finally settled. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 611 

respecting these dues on file here, is not sufficient; and I now 
write for the purpose of obtaining from you whatever may 
be necessary to render that information complete. On the 
receipt of these instructions you will proceed to examine the 
subject, and to procure and transmit hither, at as early a 
moment as practicable, everything in relation to the Sound 
Dues which may be within your reach. As a satisfactory 
mode of imparting the kind of knowledge which is sought, it 
is suggested to you to make out, or cause to be made out, in 
a tabular form, statements showing the number of American 
vessels and the amount and kind of American property, which, 
(since 1783, the period when, it is believed, our commerce first 
entered the Baltic,) has passed annually, through the Sound 
and Belts the amount of tonnage the dues exacted, and all 
other taxes and impositions, of every description, arising, 
directly or indirectly, out of the enforcement of this toll, 
and a comparative view of the commerce of other nations 
trading to the Baltic, within the same period. You will also 
furnish copies of the different tariffs which have been in force, 
and point out the various discriminations which have affected, 
and still affect, favorably or unfavorably, the trade and com- 
merce of the United States. In this connection, it may be 
proper to remark that the rates per centum of the duties laid 
upon different articles of commerce may be equal, but, at the 
same time, by laying high duties upon some articles and low 
duties upon others, there may be an advantageous discrimina- 
tion in favor of one and a disadvantageous discrimination in 
regard to the other. 

The Sound duties are, as you know, regarded, by the North- 
ern Powers of Europe, in the same unfavorable light that 
they are by the United States. Prussia is interested in their 
modification or suppression; they being held by her to be the 
chief obstruction to the full development of the Baltic trade, 
and more especially of the direct trade of the United States 
with the States composing the German Custom's Union, which 
must pass through the Prussian ports of the Baltic. 

You will make no formal communication to the Danish 
Government upon this subject, but if it should become neces- 
sary to apply to it for any information which you think may 
prove useful, you are at liberty to state, if necessary, that the 



612 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

object of the application is to enable you to answer inquiries 
which your Government has made in regard to the Sound dues. 

As bearing upon the subject under consideration, 1 have 
directed copies to be made, and forwarded to you with this 
despatch, of a correspondence between -M r . Steen Bille, the 
Diplomatic Representative of Denmark, near this Govern- 
ment, and Mr. Webster, then Secretary of State, respecting 
the negotiations between England and Denmark, which resulted 
in the Convention of August, 1841, by which the former power 
obtained a reduction of the duties on those articles in which 
her trade was chiefly interested. 

Your despatches to No. 29, inclusive, have been received, 
with the exception of No. 12. 



To Tilghman A. Howard. 1 

Unofficial. Washington, September 13, 1844. 

DEAR SIR: I yesterday forwarded to you by a special mes- 
senger, Lieut. George Stephens, a copy of a dispatch to our 
Minister at Mexico, Gov. Shannon, 2 the original of which will 
be delivered to him by Gen 1 Green, who, having been detained 
here a day, furnishes me the opportunity of transmitting to 
you the enclosed paragraph, which, since the departure of 
M r . Stephens, it has been thought advisable to add to the 
original dispatch. 

It is probable that you will not have delivered the copy 
before this reaches you, as Gen 1 Green leaves here tomorrow 
direct for Vera Cruz via Gaiveston. In this case you can 
annex the enclosed as the concluding paragraph of the dispatch 
immediately preceding the signature. If, however, you shall 
have delivered the copy, it would be proper to hand the par- 
agraph to President Houston and inform him that it should 
be so annexed, so as to make it a full and correct copy of the 
original.

Mexican Secretary by our Charge d'affaires, in announcing 
the conclusion of the Treaty that the measure was adopted 
in no spirit of hostility to Mexico, and that if annexation 
should be consummated, the United States will be prepared 
to adjust all questions growing out of it, including that of 
boundary, in the most liberal terms."

State Dep* 14 th Sep r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I am, you will see, still detained here, con- 
trary to my calculation and desire; but expect to leave certainly 
between the 20 and 25 th Ins* for home. 

I have been much engaged between the Oregon negotiations, 
preparing dispatches, and the ordinary duties of the office. 
The Steamer, which take.s this, takes also for you a copy of a 
dispatch (sent to day by a special messenger) to our minister 
at Mexico. I transmitted to you by the last Steamer a copy 
of a dispatch to M r King at Paris. Both have been sent to all 
our Diplomatick agents in Europe where it was supposed an 
explanation of our motives, in reference to Texas would be of 
service. 

There has been a good deal of sickness at Fort Hill owing to 
the severity of the drougth and the low State of the River; 
but no deaths. All were well the last accounts. It is thought 
the cotton crop will be cut very short, compared to what had 
been expected, by the long continuance of the drougth. 1 
have not heard from your place. Our Alabama crop is very 
good, according to last accounts. 

The political prospect is good. I hold Clay's defeat and 
Folk's election almost certain; and, as far as 1 am informed, 
there is no danger that the latter will fall under the influence 
of Benton, or that wing of the party. He, indeed, appears to 
have lost cast with the party. 

Nothing has occured since my last to Anna worth relating. 

If you got my measure, I would be glad, if an opportunity 
should offer, that you would Send me a broad cloth coat and 



Brussels. 



614 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

a pair of panteloons, both black, and a waist coat of the same, 
or some suitable colour. Also a pair of boots and one of 
shoes. 

You have, ere this, been some time in Paris, and will I pre- 
sume be in Brussels before it can reach its destination, to which 
place, I have accordingly, addressed it. I shall be very anx- 
ious to hear from you and learn the impression, which Europe 
and especially Paris has made on Anna. 

I hope you all continue well, and have enjoyed yourselves 
much. My love to Anna and Kiss the dear children for their 
grandfather. My health continues good, although I have 
been working hard. 



To Andrew Jackson Donelson. 1 

State Dep* 16 th Sep 4 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, The mail of yesterday brought the melan- 
choly intelligence of the death of General Howard, our Charge 
at Texas; an event, which may be justly regarded, under pres- 
ent circumstances, as a publick misfortune. 

The state of things in Texas is such as to require that the 
place should be filled without delay and to select him, who 
under all circumstances may be thought best calculated to 
bring to a successful decision, the great question of Annexa- 
tion, now pending before the two Countries. After full delib- 
eration, you have been selected as that individual; and, I do 
trust, my dear Sir, that you will not decline the appointment, 
however great may be the personal sacrifice of accepting. 

That great question must be decided in the next three or 
four months, and whether it shall be favorably or not, may 
depend on him who shall fill the Mission now tendered to you. 
I need not tell you how much depends on its decision, for weal 
or woe to our country and perhaps to the whole Continent. 
It is sufficient to say, that viewed in all its consequences, it is 
one of the very first magnitude, and that it gives an impor- 
tance to the Mission, at this time, that raises it to the level 
with the highest in the gift of the Government. 

1 Text derived from a copy kindly furnished by Mrs. M. E. Wilcox, of Washington, the 
possessor of the original. Another copy was supplied by the Department of State. Owing 
to the death of Maj. T. A. Howard, charge in Texas, mentioned in a previous note, Major 
Donelson. nephew and formerly private secretary of General Jackson, was appointed in 
his place. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 615 

Assuming, therefore, that you will not decline the appoint- 
ment, unless some insuperable difficulty should interpose, and 
in order to avoid delay, a Commission is herewith transmit- 
ted, without the formality of waiting your acceptance, with 
all the necessary papers. 

You will be entitled to an outfit of $4500 and a salary of an 
equal amount, commencing with } T our acceptance. There is 
no outfit appropriated, as no vacancy was anticipated, but ap- 
plication will be made to Congress to make an appropriation 
when it meets. In the mean time, the President has ordered 
that a quarter's salary should be advanced, which you will find 
done by a draft on N. York. I hope it irmy be sufficient for 
the present. It was all that could be done. If, by any possi- 
bility, you should be prevented from accepting it, as I trust 
will not be the case, you will please return the draft. 

You will find, also, enclosed a copy of the dispatch, with its 
enclosures, forwarded a few days since, to the late Charge, by 
a Special Messenger. They are transmitted to you, in order 
to put you, in advance, in possession of the views of the Gov- 
ernment, in reference to the threatened invasion of Texas by 
Mexico. They are for your own eye, but you are at liberty 
to show them to General Jackson and to consult with him on 
the subject. 

I shall be anxious to hear from you at the earliest period, 
and take the liberty of wishing you, in anticipation of your 
acceptance, much success in your Mission. As I expect to 
leave this, for ray residence in South Carolina, before your 
answer can reach here, I will request you, in addition to your 
official letter addressed to the Department, to address a pri- 
vate letter to me at Pendleton, South Carolina. 



To Francis Wharton. 1 

State Dep* 17 th Sep r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been prevented by my numerous and 
weighty engagements from* acknowledging your note of the 
21 st Aug*. at an earlier period. 

1 Original lent by Mrs. Francis Wharton, of Washington. See Wharton's letter of Sep- 
tember 11, in Part II, post. 



616 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The excitement in a portion of Carolina, to which you refer 
has gradually subsided, and will give no farther trouble. 1 I 
had to act with great delicacy, but at the same time firmness 
in relation to it. 

In reference to the subject touched on in yours of the 11 th 
Ins*. I have no doubt of the great neeessit} 1 - for such a Jour- 
nal, as you suggest in Philadelphia, and I would rejoice to see 
you at the head of such an one; but I apprehend that there 
would be difficulty in obtaining the patronage from the 
South, which you intimate. It would be difficult to make 
those, who have the means, realize the necessity of establish- 
ing such a paper by funds to be drawn from other states, 
especially in a place so populous and wealthy as Philadelphia. 
Add to this the great pressure from exceedingly low prices of 
their agricultural products, under which our planters have 
been labouring for many years, and I should think the pros- 
pect hopeless. 

Although I cannot hold out hope for support from the 
South, yet, I trust, there may be found sufficient local sup- 
port of a sound character to sustain an able, honest and 
respectable paper in your city. Your present Journals are 
woefully deficient; quite below the standard of New York, 
Boston, Richmond and Charleston. The evil ought to be 
removed, and I am sure would be, if you were placed at the 
head of a paper, with a respectable list of subscribers. Can 
you not rally a sufficient number of the respectable portion of 
your citizens for the purpose, especially the younger part? 
I do not know a State or City, which requires to have its 
politicks elevated to a higher standard, than Pennsylvania and 
Philadelphia. In none is the contrast greater between the 
individual character of its people and that of its government. 

I am of the impression, that the defeat of Clay and the 
election of Polk is almost certain. It will be a marked event 
in our political history. It will be the last of Clay; and when 
he disappears from the publick stage, the Whig party will 
disperse and new political combinations must follow. It will

a subsequent meeting at Charleston on August 19. See Niles, LXVI, 40(5, 419, 434. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 61 7 

be a new departure, from which man} 7 are destined to date 
their fall or elevation. My own impression is, that it will 
prove auspicious to the cause of sound principles and correct 
policy. M r Clay has been a great disturbing power in the 
harmonious and regular movements of our Government, 
especially in the southern and western portion, where the 
influence of his personal character has been the most felt. 
He has done much to distract the South, and to keep the 
West out of its true position. These reflections, if correct, 
go to show the great importance of able and honest Journals 
to give the proper direction at such a juncture. 

I write you freely and you must regard what I have writ- 
ten to be intended for yourself. 



To Ogdeti Hoffman.^ 

Department of State, Washington, Sept. 21, 18M. 
SIR: A communication was addressed to you by this Depart- 
ment sometime since, calling your attention to the conduct of 
the Mexican Government, in fitting out, as has been repre- 
sented to this Department, two Steam Vessels of War in the 
Port of New York, against the provisions of the Acts of Con- 
gress of the 20 th of April, 1818, and the 10 th of March, 1838, 
and requesting your prompt attention to the Subject. It is a 
Source of equal surprise and regret, that no notice of this 
communication has been received at this Department. The 
subject is one of high importance, involving at once the power 
of the Country and the Supremacy of its laws; and in the dis- 
charge of my duties I cannot too earnestly urge it on your 
consideration. One of these vessels, I am to-day informed, 
has already sailed from the port, destined, as there is strong 
ground to believe, against the Territory and Citizens of a coun- 
try, with which the United States are at peace. You will 
pardon me, therefore, in again calling your attention to the 
Subject, with a view to such information, as may enable the 
Executive to decide what course it ought to pursue, in main- 
taining the Laws of the Country and the honor of the Repub-

lie. The case is deemed of so much importance, that the 
Department has thought itself authorized to employ the pro- 
fessional Services of the Hon. John McKeon to aid you in 
the investigation; and a communication has this day been 
addressed to him to that effect, and he is desired to see and 
cooperate with you. 

To John McKeon. l 

Department of State, Washington, Sep* 21 st 1844 
SIR: Information has been received at this Department 
from various quarters, which leaves little doubt that the 
Mexican Government is now engaged in fitting out two Steam 
Vessels of War in the Port of New York, against the pro- 
visions of the Acts of Congress of the 20 th April, 1818, and 
the 10 th March 1838. This Department is informed that the 
commanders of these Vessels, have given orders for large 
supplies of shot, shells, etc., and are enlarging the number 
and calibre of the guns on board, enlisting Seamen and pur-

hended against the citizens and territory of the Republic of 
Texas, with whom the United States are at peace. 

Under these circumstances the Department considers itself 
called upon, to institute an enquiry, into the facts of the 
case; and relying on your zeal patriotism, energy and intel- 
ligence, I have to request that you see and consult with the 
United States District Attorney, if he should be 'in the City, 
and cooperating with him you will immediately take such 
steps as may seem expedient, in order to ascertain the facts 
and report them to this Department. If the District Attor- 
ney should be absent, you will yourself promptly adopt such 
measures as may appear to you necessary and proper to 
secure the desired information. Our laws of neutrality 
should be strictly observed by, and enforced against all 
nations as involving the public peace and National honor.

that the other is on the eve of sailing. You will therefore 
perceive the necessity of immediate Action, in order that the 
Executive may be enabled to adopt such measures, as the 
circumstances of the Case may warrant, and the laws demand. 



To Frcnil'l'in Dexter .^ 

Department of State, Washington, Sept. 24 th , 1844. 

SIR: This Department learns through the public prints that 
the house of Philo Shelton and Co. of Boston has contracted 
to supply the Mexican Government with a quantity of tents, 
and that the contract is understood to have been made through 
British Agency. 

It is desirable that the truth of this statement should be 
ascertained. You will consequently make proper inquiries 
for that purpose, and communicate the result to this Depart- 
ment. Your attention is particularly requested to the laws 
of the United States passed for the purpose of maintaining 
our neutrality, and if you should have reason to believe that 
any measures are in contemplation calculated to contravene 
them, you will institute proper process with a view to defeat 
those measures. 



To Ed/ward Everett? 

Department of State, Washington, September 25, 1844. 

SIR: M r . Walker, one of the Senators of Mississippi, sub- 
mitted for the consideration of the Senate, near the close of 
the last session of Congress, the two following resolutions: 

Resolved, That the President be requested to inform the Senate whether 
the Parliament of Great Britain has passed any act extending its criminal 
jurisdiction to the United States, so as to subject any portion of their citi- 
zens, or persons within their limits, to its penalties for acts done within 
the same, and to communicate a copy of said act, if any such there be, to- 
gether with any information he may possess, as to the means which may 
have been adopte 1 to carry its provisions into effect. 

Resolved, That he be also requested to inform the Senate whether the 
Government of Great Britain has issued circulars to its diplomatic or con-

sular agents to collect information as to the condition of any portion of our 
population, and, if so, to transmit to the Senate a copy thereof, if in his 
possession, together with any information he may possess, as to the object 
of issuing the same. 

They were laid on the table without being acted on, as it 
may be presumed, from the want of time. They will proba- 
bly be renewed at the next session and adopted. 

The immediate object of this despatch is to obtain the 
information requested by the resolutions, in order to have the 
means of answering the call, should it then be renewed and 
adopted. 

On examining a collection of the statutes of Parliament, I 
can find but one act (the 6 th and 7 th of Victoria, entitled "An 
act for the more effectual suppression of the slave trade,") 
which would seem to come within the description of the first 
resolution. It is the one, probably, which occasioned its 
introduction. It expressly extends the criminal jurisdiction 
of Great Britain to its subjects in foreign countries, in all 
cases embraced within its provisions; and as it may, of course, 
be inferred to her subjects residing in the United States; but, 
in order to remove all doubt upon that point, you will ascer- 
tain, through the proper department of the Government, 
whether her subjects, residing within the United kStates, are 
intended to be embraced in the provisions of the Act or not; 
and, if they are, you will obtain and transmit a copy of the 
same, published by the authority of the Government. 

You will, in the next place, ascertain who are intended to be 
embraced under the expression of British subjects. Is it 
intended to be restricted to those only who may be sojourn- 
ing or residing temporarily in the United States, without 
intending to become citizens? or, to all who may have been 
born within the limits of the British dominions including as 
well those who have become citizens of the United States as 
those that have not? 

The second, section of the 5 th of Geo: 4 th declares it to be 
unlawful for any person (except in special cases thereinafter 
specified,) to deal or trade in, purchase, sell, barter, or trans- 
fer; or to contract for the dealing or trading in, purchase, 
sale, barter, or transfer of slaves or persons intended to be 
dealt with as slaves; or to lend or advance, or become security 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 621 

for the loan or advance of money, goods, or effects employed 
or to be employed in accomplishing any of the objects or con- 
tracts, or in relation to the objects and contracts, which objects 
and contracts have hereinbefore been declared unlawful, or 
to become guarantee or security; or, in short, to be in any 
manner engaged or concerned in buying, selling, or dealing in 
Slaves. 

The act of the 6 th and 7 th Victoria recites these provisions, 
and declares that they shall extend to British subjects in for- 
eign countries, and adopts all the provisions of the act of the 
5 th Geo. 4 th , entitled "An Act to amend and consolidate the 
laws relating to the abolition of the slave trade." The 10 th 
Section of that Act declares that all persons offending against 
its provisions, and their procurers, counsellors, aiders, and 
abettors, to be felons, and shall be transported beyond sea, for 
a term not exceeding ten years, or shall be confined to hard 
labor for a term not exceeding five years, nor less than three, 
at the discretion of the court, before which they may be tried 
and convicted. You will ascertain whether it is intended that 
British subjects in the United States, who shalLany way be 
concerned in buying, selling, or dealing in slaves as is declared 
in the 2 d Section of 5 th Geo: 4 th , and recited and adopted by 
the 6 th and 7 th Victoria, as above stated, shall be liable to the 
penalties contained in the 10 th section of the former. 

There is not a little uncertainty as to the object intended to 
be effected by the Act of the 6 th and 7 th Victoria, taken in 
connection with that of the 5 th Geo: 4 th . The object of both, 
as declared in their respective titles, is the suppression of the 
slave trade; by which it is usually understood, the African 
slave trade. That was unquestionably the object of the 5 th 
Geo: 4 th . But the object of the 6 th and 7 th Victoria (the Act 
in question), would seem to be not so much the abolition of 
the slave trade, as the abolition of slavery itself, as far as- 
British subjects in foreign countries are concerned. If refer- 
ence be had to the reported debates on the bill while on its 
passage through the House of Commons, in order to ascertain 
its object, it would seem, by the declarations of its advocate, 
that it was to prohibit, indirectly, the slave trade, by prohib- 
iting British subjects and British capital from being engaged 
in purchasing and employing slaves in countries where the 



622 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

African slave trade is still permitted, in order to prevent 
thereby the increased stimulus it was calculated to give that 
trade. If that is, in truth, its object, there can be no motive 
whatever for extending its provisions to the United States. 
They have long since effectually suppressed the trade. But 
if that be not the object, you will ascertain what in fact is the 
object for extending the provisions of the Act to British 
subjects in the United States. 

You will also ascertain what measures have been adopted 
to enforce its provisions, and particularly what instructions 
have been given by the British Government to their Consuls 
or other agents concerning that Act, or that of the 5 th Geo. 4 th . 
I enclose for your information a copy of a circular purport- 
ing to contain instructions to its consuls in relation to the 
former act, taken from one of the public journals. If any 
such circular has been issued or any other, you will obtain a 
copy and transmit it to this Department, and also a copy of 
that issued under the Act of the 5 th Geo. 4 th referred to in the 
circular, if any such has been issued. 

You will, finally, ascertain whether it has issued a circular 
or circulars of the description referred to in the 2 d resolution; 
and, if so, obtain and transmit copies to the Department. We 
have no knowledge of any such, but it has been intimated 
from different quarters by the public journals, that a circular 
of the kind has been issued. It is probable that these fre- 
quent intimations have led to the introduction of the resolution. 

The British Government cannot take any just exception to 
the course adopted by this Government to get the informa- 
tion which you have been instructed to obtain. The Act of 
the 6 th and 7 th Victoria, on its face, purports to extend its 
criminal jurisdiction to persons within our limits, and who 
while there are subject to our laws and entitled to our protec- 
tion, and that not only gives our Government a right to obtain 
the information asked for, but makes it its duty to ask for it. 

Should you ascertain that it is intended to extend the 
provisions of the Act to British subjects residing in the United 
States, you will, in an earnest manner, invite the attention 
of the British Government to the subject. We hold that 
the criminal jurisdiction of a Nation is limited to its own 
dominions and to vessels under its flag on the high seas^ 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 623 

and that it cannot extend it to acts committed within the 
dominion of another, without violating its sovereignty and 
independence. Standing on this well-established and unques- 
tioned principle, we cannot permit Great Britain or any other 
Nation, be its object or motive what it may, to infringe our 
sovereignty and independence by extending its criminal juris- 
diction to acts committed within the limits of the United 
States, be they perpetrated by whom they may. All therein 
are subject to their jurisdiction, entitled to their protection, 
and are amenable exclusively to their laws. 

It is not anticipated that the British Government will deny 
or contest a principle so clear and so unanimously acknowl- 
edged; and we must believe, until convinced of the contrary, 
that the act passed without due deliberation, or taking into 
consideration its bearing on the sovereignty and independence 
of other countries. It would indeed seem, if we are to judge 
from the debate as reported that it passed the House of Lords 
without its attention being particularly directed to its provi- 
sions, and that of the Commons, after a very hurried discussion, 
just at the close of the session, and little to the satisfaction of 
many of its members. 

It is to be hoped that the Government of Great Britain, 
on having its attention invited seriously to the subject, will 
readily correct what would seem to be an inadvertence com- 
mitted in the hurry of legislation. If. in this we should be 
disappointed, it would be difficult to conceive what measure 
she could adopt more offensive to our dignity and rights as 
an independent country, or calculated more certainly to lead 
to serious consequences. 



To Ogden Hoffman. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 26 Sept., 1844. 
SIR: I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 
24 th inst., accompanied by a copy of an affidavit of Henry 
Cook, a firem'an on board of the Mexican Steamer Montezuma. 
In reply, I have to state in reference to the case of the Mexi- 
can Steamers that if, after consultation with Mr. Coxe, a doubt

should arise on a point of law, you will state the point dis- 
tinctly and transmit the same without delay for the opinion 
of the Attorney General. In regard to facts, consulting with 
Mr. Coxe as you will on all occasions, you are much more 
capable of making up a correct opinion than the Department 
at this distance. Mr. Coxe and yourself will therefore act 
conjointly on your own responsibility so far as evidence of 
facts is concerned, observing the rule to act in no case but on 
clear evidence, and at the same time not to permit the vessels 
to depart if the evidence be clear that it would be in violation 
of our neutral obligations. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 7 th Oct r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . The friends of Polk now regard his 
election as about certain. I think the prospect good; but 
the Whigs are making great efforts, which may tell deeper 
than their opponents calculate. A few weeks, however, will 
soon decide, which side shall prevail. 

There has been a good deal of excitement in our state in 
consequence of the movement of M r Rhett in favour of seperate 
action of the State. 1 The publick sentiment has settled down 
against his course, and all is now quiet; but the feeling of the 
state is deep both on the subject of the Tariff and Abolition. 
If Clay should be elected or Polk not fulfil expectation, in 
the event of his election, the feeling will burst forth into 
action.

that South Carolina is hostile to the Union. There is not a 
member of our Union more devoted to it than she is; I mean 
the Federal Union, as it came from the hands of its framers. 
But she believes that the Union may be destroyed as well by 
consolidation as b}^ despotism; and that of the two, there is 
much more danger o'f the former than the latter. And, hence 
it is, that while other States look with indifference for the 
most part at the tendency of the system to consolidation, she 
regards it with the veriest jealousy as the exposed point, and 
one that ought to be guarded with the greatest care. Accord- 
ing to her creed consolidation must necessarily lead in succes- 
sion to injustice, oppression, fraud, corruption, violence, 
anarchy and despotism; and her efforts, accordingly, have 
been directed to averting these and not to dissolving the 
Union. And hence her devotion to State rights, which she 
regards as the only effectual means of averting them, and 
saving both liberty and Union. She considers those who 
advocate doctrines and measures tending to consolidation as 
the most dangerous enemies to both. 

If she has taken high ground on the question of admitting 
Texas into the Union it is not because she has any pecuniary 
interest whatever in her annexation. On the contrary, she 
clearly see that it must act as a powerful drain both on her 
population and capital; but sees, also, that it is necessary for 
the safety of the West and South, while it is calculated to 
advance the interest and prosperity of the North and East. 
Thus regarding it, she cannot but see that the ground on 
which annexation is opposed by leading Whigs in the latter 
sections implies not only a total indifference, but deep hostil- 
ity to the South and its domestic institutions, a hostility 
unless resisted and put down destructive of the great object 
for which the Union was formed the mutual safety and pro- 
tection of the members composing it. It is this view of the 
subject which has given utterance to the strong expressions 
of some of our people, which has been construed as evidence 
of the hostility of the State to the Union by those whose acts 
and declarations clearly prove them to be wholly indifferent 
to it, except as an instrument of plunder and oppression. 
What I have written is intended exclusively for yourself.

ToJ. A. Stuart. 1 

Fort Hill 21 st Oct 1844 

MY DEAK SIR, I am glad you have noticed as you have, the 
statement of the Charleston correspondent of the U. States 
Gazette of Philadelphia, purporting to give a conversation 
that I had on my way through Charleston. There is no 
truth in it, or semblance of truth, except that I expressed 
my opinion pretty confidently, Mr Polk would be elected, to 
all my friends who made any enquiry on the subject. With 
that exception, I said nothing to justify, or any way to coun- 
tenance the statement; and you are authorized to say so. I 
made no allusion to my remaining in the office 1 now hold, or 
that there was any understanding that I should continue in it. 
It would have been both indelicate and untrue to have done so. 
Nothing has ever passed between Mr Polk and myself, 
directly or indirectly, on the subject. I neither know his 
views nor he mine on the subject. The whole was [a] base 
device to influence the Pennsylvania election. 

I congratulate you on election; and rejoice, that the tricks 
resorted to, in order to defeat or rather distract the party in 
Charleston, have been so effectually counteracted. 

In giving my opinion, as to the probable result of the Pres- 
idential election, while in Charleston and since my return, I 
spoke on the supposition, that the abolitionists could not be 
brought to vote for Clay. Such was believed to be the case 
when 1 left Washington by all our friends. I fear, however, 
that the fact will turn out otherwise. The present indication 
is, that they will vote for Cla}^. In that event, 1 fear he 
would be elected. Should such be the case, we may look out 
for a fearful struggle the next four years, which we can not 
too soon prepare to meet. The first step should be to unite 
and organize the South. If that can be done, all will be well; 
otherwise, it is difficult to say what may come.

James and Eugenia Calhoun. We had a very pleasant jour- 
ney, with fine weather all the way. I have taken lodgings for 
the winter at a new Hotel, between Gadsby's and the Depos- 
ite. James has come on to go to the Virginia University, and 
will leave in a few days. We left Willey at Fort Hill, with 
M rs Ryan and her son James. Patrick and John have not yet 
leturned. I had a letter from John yesterday. They were 
high up on the Mississippi, at Fort Leavenworth, but expected 
to leave for S fc Louis in a few days. They will be with us 
shortly, unless they should return by Fort Hill. . . . 

I intended to visit your place from Edgefield on my return, 
and made my arrangement accordingly; but Co 1 Pickens told 
me it was unnecessary; that he had made arrangements for the 
next year, and laid in all supplies; and that everything was 
going on well. He will write you fully. He seems to take 
much interest in your affairs, and informs me, that M r Mosty, 
your neighbour, was over every day. I would have gone any 
how, but I found, that he was so intent on having me to meet 
all of the gentlemen of the Village at the dinner he had made 
his arrangements to give me, the next day, that I had to yield 
to his wishes. 

I consulted him on the point, whether it would be expedient 
to add to your force under existing circumstances, and we 
both concluded, considering the price of negroes and cotton, 
and the prospect as to the future price of that article, that it 
would not be. Negro women were selling at from $300 to 
400, and men in proportion, notwithstanding the low price of 
cotton. 

I received your's and Anna's letters from Paris before I left 
home, by the former Steamer. The letters by the last, among 
which there was one from you, written after you arrived at 
Brussels were forwarded to Pendleton.

Washington 14 th Nov r 1844 

DEAR SIR, I have received your note enclosing an article 
from the Christian Citizen, headed John C. -Calhoun, and 



i From a draft in Calhoun's handwriting. 



628 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Written by the Rev d . Charles T Torrey as you state. x The Rev d 
Author states; that "three years since, he (John C. Calhoun) 
sold another man's wife for a harlot. She was the wife of his 
Coachman; a beautiful and pious girl; a member of the meth- 
odist church. The purchaser was a planter in Alabama: the 
price $1400. Some months after the Sale, the poor husband 
having been sent into the upper part of South Carolina, with 
a coach, for a member of M r . Calhoun's white family, took 
the opportunity to flee. He went to Alabama, sought and 
found his injured wife, and fled in the night on foot. After 
weeks of hunger and toil they reached the upper part of 
Maryland. The wife a delicate woman was taken sick and 
died. Three days the sorrowing man wept over her remains. 
At last he buried her, with his hands, by the river side, then 
toiled onwards towards Canada. I saw him some months ago, 
a sad gloomy, heart broken man." 

You have been taught, you say, to look on me as a man of 
great talents and pure character, and ask me ""are the above 
charges true ? If not true litterally, are they true in Substance ? 
or are they totally untrue ? " 

Believing your motive for making these enquiries to orig- 
inate in friendly feelings and a desire to know the truth, I will 
answer you. They, then, are not only not true, either litter- 
ally or in substance, but are totally untrue, and without a 
shaddow of foundation ; and have been fabricated by some art- 
ful runaway to attrack sympathy or acquire distinction, or 
with some one else for a still baser purpose. My character 
as a master is, I trust, as unimpeachable, as I hope it is in all 
the other relations of life. I regard my relation to those who 
belong to me, in the double aspect of master and guardian, 
and am as careful to discharge the duties appertaining to each, 
as I am those, which appertain to the numerous other rela- 
tions in which I am placed. 

How far the Rev d author stands justified before God and 
man for publishing the base and unfounded charges he has 
made against me, or for violating the laws of the land in per- 
pert rating the act for which he is imprisoned, I leave it to 
others to decide.

To Francis Wharton. 1 

Washington 20 th Nov r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, Judge King's nomination will, if my mem- 
ory serves me, have to be renewed, according to the usage of 
the Senate. 

I must say, that your letter places his character in a light, 
which I have not heretofore regarded it. I had taken the 
impression, that although a man of talents, his political 
association connected him with a set of politicians of a very 
objectionable character, which subjected his to doubt. Under 
this impression, I was disinclined to his nomination, without, 
however, taking any part against it, while before the Senate. 
It is due to the occasion to say, that the impression made on 
my mind, has, I am inclined to think, been made on that of 
many others; so much so, that his nomination will be in great 
danger, unless it should be well sustained from the respectable 
portion of your bar and the City, especially, if your two Sen- 
ators should be opposed to him. I take it, that the wing of 
the party, usually opposed to the nominations of the Presi- 
dent, will be against him, which would certainly cause his 
defeat; unless he should receive the support of the better 
portion of the Whig party. If, however, your two Senators 
will support him, I should think that his prospects would be 
fair. Without it, there would be great difficulty in obtain- 
ing the confirmation of his nomination. I write in confidence, 
and only for your own eye. 

I regard the defeat of Clay and the election of Polk, under 
all circumstances, as a great political revolution. Great 
events may grow out of [it], if the victory be used with pru-

dence and moderation. There is much to be done to bring 
things right, and save the Government, but in order to be 
successfully done, it must be done gradually and systematic- 
ally. I say, save the Government; for to my mind it is clear, 
that it cannot go on much longer, as it has for the last 15 or 
20 years, and especially the last 8. 

I am of the impression, an article, such as you suggest for 
the Review, is very desirable, but that it ought: to be delayed 
untill several other papers, I have prepared, since the close 
of the session, make their appearance, which will be during 
the coming session. My two letters to Mr. Pakenham 
were intended but as the beg[inn]ing of a long correspondence 
with the British Government which in its progress would in- 
volve all the subjects embraced in her course in reference to 
our country on the question of slavery. In that, I was dis- 
appointed, as no reply was made to my second letter to M r 
Pakenham; but much, which I intend to bring out, has been 
brought out on other questions.

SIR: I have received your letter of the 21 st ult. (enclosing 
one from M r . Lowden); and that of M r . Ellmore, of the 28 th 
ult. relating to the claim of the heirs of the late Jno. Paul 
Jones. 2 M r . Lowden is well aware of the steps taken by this 
Government, and of my disposition to do everything that can 
be done to effect the settlement of a claim so meritorious and 
of so long pendency. 

Since the Communication to Congress of all the information 
on this Subject, which the Department possessed, in answer 
to a Resolution of the House of Representatives of 22 d April 
last, nothing further has been received. I have, therefore, 
this day addressed a despatch to M r . Irwin, a copy of which I 
transmit, for the satisfaction of those interested, which it is 
hoped will stimulate him to new and successful exertions in 
the case. And any new evidence which the parties may have- 
that bears upon the subject, will of course be sent b}^ them

M r . Lowden respecting it. 



To William. W. Irwin. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 2 d December, 1844. 

SIR: You will perceive by the enclosed papers, which are 
copies of letters recently received, that the heirs of the late 
Commodore J. Paul Jones, believing the present to be a favor- 
able time for urging upon the Danish Government a speedy 
settlement of their just and long neglected claims upon it, 
have again solicited the interposition of this Department. 

In answer to a Resolution of the House of Representatives 
of 22 d April last, I communicated to that Body copies of all 
3^our despatches upon the subject, in reply to the instructions 
you had received from this Department. I enclose a copy of 
the printed document containing this correspondence. There 
is reason to believe that a call will be made upon the Govern- 
ment this session, for further information. And your attention 
is thus early invited, to the matter, to -afford the opportunity 
to transmit the results of your application to the Government 
of Denmark, in behalf of the claimants, in time to meet any 
inquiry that may be made, before Congress adjourns. If no 
further steps have been taken by you in the premises, since 
your last despatch, No. 18, you will, without delay, address 
an earnest note, on this subject, to the Minister of Foreign

to her long passage, and the delay in receiving what she 
brought, from Boston, the letters and dispatches by her were 
not received untill yesterday. Among them, there was noth- 
ing from Paris. 

This [is] the last day that communications by her on her 
return can be mailed, which, as 1 have several letters besides 
this to write, will compel me to be very brief. 

A copy of the correspondence of the Dep 1 . with Texas and 
Mexico in reference to the question of annexation will accom- 
pany this, and among them a copy of my dispatch to you. It 
has made, I learn, a deep impression, as far as it has been 
read; and I hope it will attrack the attention in Europe, which 
the vast importance of the topicks it touches demand. They 
are of a character to interest every country on both Conti- 
nents, in their commercial and political relations. If England 
should consummate her grand scheme of commercial monopoly, 
disguised under the guarb of abolition, it would not only sub- 
ject the commerce of the world to her control, but would, on 
all that portion of this continent lying South of Mason and 
Dixons line, end in a war between races of the most deadly 
and desolating character; to be terminated in a large portion 
in the ascendency of the lowest and most savage of the races 
and a return to barbarism. England from her position, would 
necessarily become the patron of the coulered races of all 
hues, negroes, Indians and mixed, against the white, which 
unless France and the continental powers, generally, but espe- 
cially her, should become the Supporter of the latter, would 
give them the superiority. The intimate relations of France 
with Brazil and Spain would seem to make it impossible that 
she should be indifferent to the fate of the former or Cuba, 
not to mention her old and long standing friendly relations 
with the U. States. Nor can it be supposed, that she is so 
deficient in sagacity, as not to see what a commanding position 
she might take in conjunction with them and in connection 
with the U. States. I throw out these suggestions to turn 
your attention to the great and important bearing of the pres- 
ent remarkable juncture in the political and commercial world. 
You may have occassionally opportunities of giving events the 
direction we desire. 

Resolutions for the annexation of Texas have been intro- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. C^LHOUN. 633 

duced into both Houses. I hope the measure may succeed; 
but I 'have my fears. Should it fail, Benton will be respon- 
sible for the result. He seems bent on 1 doing all the mischief 
he can, both to the country and the party. He covers and 
protects the whigs by his course. His conduct on the annexa- 
tion question, and that of the Northern wing of the party on 
the reception of abolition petitions, and of Mass* 8 in sending 
an emissary to South Carolina, will be the cause of much 
excitement during the session. It is difficult to see in what it 
may all end. 

I entirely agree with you, as to the importance of dissemi- 
nating correct information in France on the subject to which 
you refer, and you are authorized to incur an expense on that 
account not exceeding $500, to be charged to the contingent 
fund of the Department. 2 No one can be better qualified to 
prepare the proper articles for the purpose than M r Walsh, 
who you suggest. 

The time is so short that I can add no more. 



To Thomm G. (Jlvinwm. c. c. 

Private. Washington 13 th Dec r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, My official business, as well as my corre- 
spondence, has got so far in the rear, and I find it so difficult 
to bring it up, in consequence of the great increase, which is 
attendant on the meeting of Congress, of current business, 
that I am compelled to write very brief letters. 

The great question of the session will be the annexation of 
Texas. It will be brought up without delay in both Houses 
and pressed with Zeal by its friends. It will, I think, pass the 
House almost certainly; but I fear, it may be defeated in the 
Senate, where the Whig party is very strong. 

There is much Speculation, as to M r Folk's Cabinet; and 
not a little intrigue, it is said, is going on in various quarters. 
I am perfectly passive and am indifferent as far as 1 am per- 
sonally concerned and keep my decision to myself, whether I 
shall remain in or not, if I should be invited to continue. It 

1 If a pun is here intended, it is, so far as the editor's memory extends, the only jest to 
be found among Mr. Calhoun's letters written in mature years.

will depend on circumstances. My friends are anxious that I 
should remain, but whether I shall or not will depend, on what 
will be the probable course of the administration. If there 
should be reasonable grounds to infer, that it will accord with 
my principles and views of policy, I will make the sacrifice. 
If not, I shall retire. The course of the Northern wing of 
the party has been very bad on the abolition question, which 
has caused much dissatisfaction among the Southern members, 
and will I doubt not cause much through the entire South. 
The 'excitement is already great in South Carolina. She is 
ready to act. If the annexation of Texas is to be defeated by 
the same sperit, which has induced the reception of abolition 
petitions, it is difficult to say, what may be the consequence. 

A very angry correspondence has taken place between .our 
minister in Mexico and her Government. It will end in words. 
She is on the eve of anarchy and revolution and is destitute 
of the means of waging war. The Steamer, which takes this, 
will take the correspondence with Texas and Mexico, growing 
out of the question of annexation. It has been well received 
especially the letter to M r King, which has created quite a 
sensation. 

I learn from M r Serruys, 1 that he has been indirectly in- 
formed, that it [is] contemplated to remove him to Denmark, 
because his treaty had fallen to the ground, and that he has, in 
consequence, become unacceptable to the United States and 
thereby incapable of rendering any service. This impression, 
it seems, has grown out of the cause which it is supposed led 
to the removal of his predecessor Baron Behr. 

I regret, that the impression exists, and take much pleasure 
in saying, that there is no foundation for it. On the contrary 
his conduct has been such as to make him every way accept- 
able to our Government, which I wish you to take some early 
opportunity to make known to his Government. . . .

Washington 27 th Dec r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, We have been greatly distressed by the ac- 
counts, which your's and Anna's letters give of the suffering

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 635 

of Calhoun from the disease with which he has been afflicted, 
but are much relieved to learn that it has taken a favourable 
turn. We shall, however, feel much anxiety, untill we hear, 
that he is out of all danger, which we hope we shall by the 
next Steamer. Your's and Anna's anxiety and suffering must 
have been intense. 

I am under a severe pressure of business, and, as I have 
little to communicate since my last, I shall have to be brief. 

Nothing has yet been done in Congress beyond the introduc- 
tion of various bills and resolutions, and among others, sev- 
eral relating to Texas. The fate of annexation is doubtful. 
The Whigs, from appearences, seemed resolved to preserve 
their organization; and, I fear, will unite with little exception, 
against the measure; while the V. B. Benton 1 wing of the 
party have evinced a strong disposition to act with them. I 
hope, however, publick opinion will force them to give up 
their opposition. Its effects are already appearant. The Globe 2 
has changed its tone, and the attacks from that quarter on me 
have abated. Benton will, it is said, be certain to be instructed 
to vote for the measure. With these indications, the pros- 
pect is pretty fair, that it will pass the House of Representa- 
tives; and if it should, I hardly think, the Senate will assume 
the responsibility of defeating it. 

Nothing yet is known as to the intention of M r Polk in ref- 
erence to the formation of his Cabinet. He keeps a prudent 
silence. 

Cotton still continues to fall. Its average price may be said 
to be about 4 cents per pound. The effects will be ruinous in 
the South, and will rouse the feeling of the whole 'Section. 
The pressure of the Tariff begins to be/^, and understood, 
which will lead to its overthrow, either through Congress or 
the seperate action of the South. The feeling of resistance 
will be greatly increased in consequence of the course of the 
Northern democrats in reference to the 25 th rule. 3 

Say to Anna, that I would write to her by the present con- 
veyance, as hard pressed as I am for time; were it not that

several letters will go to her from the family by it, which will 
give her all the news. 

I have not had time to take into consideration the subject of 
a treaty with Belgium, but hope I will by the time the next 
Steamer shall arrive. 

We are all well and all join their love to you and Anna.

To E. N. T. Hunter. 

Washington 29 th Dec r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, My engagements are so onerous, that I am 
forced to write very few and very short letters. 

In answer to your enquiry, how the Western Democrats 
voted on the repeal of the 25 th rule, I am sorry to say, that 
the great body voted for it. It was, with few exceptions, the 
votes of the two sections, slave holding and non slave holding, 
arrayed against each other. They appear to me to be coming 
daily, more and more, into deadly conflict. To judge by indi- 
cations, which are constantly occuring, we shall be thrown 
on our own means of defending ourselves on that vital ques- 
tion. It would seem, that we can look no longer to our 
northern allies for support in reference to it. 

The Texian question is the all important question at pres- 
ent. Its fate is still doubtful. The real opposition is from 
the Benton V. Buren party, and has its centre in the Empire 
state, where the opposition, in the ranks of our own party 
against* the South, has ever originated. It was there the 
opposition of Burr to Jefferson, and of Clinton to Madison, 
originated. It was by the combinefd] influence of N. York 
democrats and the Nationals or Whigs, that the oppressive 
Tariffs of 1828 and 1842 were imposed on us; and now by the 
same combination, the annexation of Texas is opposed and is 
in danger of being defeated. Benton is but an instrument in 
its hands; and yet it is this very N. York wing of the party, 
which has been so anxiously courted by Virginia for more 
than 15 years! It is time that she should open her eyes to 
the real state of things. 

Notwithstanding the strength of this combination, I am of 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 637 

the impression, that if the question of annexation should be 
properly pressed, it will pass the House this session and if it 
should, I cannot but think the prospect is fair, that it will 
force its way through the Senate. 

We hear nothing from Tennessee. Co 1 Polk seems to be 
observing a prudent silence as to his course and the constitu- 
tion of his cabinet. As yet, I see no unfavourable indica- 
tions. 



To William H. 

Washington 7 th Jan y 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read your letter with attention and 
interest. You needed no apology for writing me fully and 
frankly on any subject, however delicate. Our long and inti- 
mate acquaintance gave you the right, and I always hear you 
with pleasure. 

I agree with you, substantially, in all your views, both as it 
relates to the publick and myself. 

We have, indeed, at last reached a crisis. It has been long 
coming, but come it has. Jt remains to be seen whether our 
institutions and liberty will survive it. It has not come un- 
expectedly to me. Of one thing I feel assured, they will not 
survive, unless we shall return, in good faith and honesty, to 
the good old doctrines of '98, and that that can only be done 
by Virginia taking the lead, at the head of the Southern 
States. To a departure from them, in many and important^ 
instances, the present dangerous condition of our affairs are J 
to be attributed, and it is only by such a return to them, that , 
impending dangers can be averted. No President, however 4 
patriotick, segacious, and energetick, can reform this Ooy^ , 
without the united support of the South, and that can only be ' 
had through the lead of Virginia-. 

As to myself, I was forced into my present position, greatly ' 
against my inclination, by a sense of duty. Nothing else could 
have induced me to accept it, and nothing can induce me to' 
hold it for a single day, whenever I can retire consistently 
with duty and propriety.

To Charles J. Ingersoll. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 9 th January, 1845 
SIR: On the 30 th of March last the President transmitted a 
message to the House of Representatives communicating a note 
from A. Pageot, Minister Plenipotentiary ad interim of the 
King of the French to the Secretary of State in relation to the 
tonnage duties levied on French vessels coming into the Ports 
of the United States from the Island of St. Pierre and Mique- 
lon; and proposing to place our Commercial intercourse with 
these islands upon the same footing as exists with the islands 
of Martinique and Guadaloupe, as regulated by the act of the 
9 th of May, 1828, and the 13 th of July, 1832. 

The President in his Message suggested the propriety of 
extending the provisions of these laws to the commerce of the 
Islands in question, but Congress adjourned without having 
acted on the subject. 

Under these circumstances, and at the instance of the French 
Minister, I beg leave to call your attention to the subject, and 
to suggest the expediency of some final action on the part of 
Congress during the present session. 



To John Y. Mason* 

Department of State, Washington, January 11, 1845. 
SIR: The Secretary of State of the Government of the 
Sandwich Islands, has said in a recent note to M r . Brown the 
United States Commissioner there, that the late M r . Upshur 
had acknowledged that this government could not claim for 
our citizens in those Islands the privilege of being tried by a 
Jury of foreigners. No such acknowledgment is contained, 
nor is the subject in any way alluded to, in any letter on 
record whilst M r . Upshur was Secretary of State. I will con- 
sequently thank you to inform me if it is mentioned in any 
order or other communication from your Department whilst

To the Publisher of the Madisonian. 1 

Department of State, Washington, 23 Jan 7 ., 1845. 
To the Publisher of the Madisonian: 

The newspaper now published by you has been selected for 
publishing the orders, resolutions and laws, except such as 
are of a private nature, passed during the 2 d session of the 
28 th Congress; all public treaties entered into and ratified by 
the United States, except Indian treaties; and amendments to 
the Constitution of the United States. 

Should you accept the appointment, you will, immediately 
on the receipt of this, be pleased to notify the Department of 
such acceptance, and name the person or persons who, as 
publisher or publishers, will be entitled to the compensation 
for the publication herein authorized. To him or them, or to 
his or their order only, payment will be made. Should a 
transfer, into other hands, of the paper take place, a notifica- 
tion thereof from the person or persons so named will be 
necessary. 

It is expected that you will, on no account, divide any one 
act, unless from its great length it should exceed the limits of 
three pages of your print. And you will not fail, in publish- 
ing the orders, resolutions, laws, etc., to observe all the 
requisites prescribed by the act of Congress of the 20 th April, 
1818, "to provide for the publication of the laws of the 
United States, and for other purposes," so far as the same 
have not been repealed by the Amendatory Acts of the 11 th of 
May, 1820, and of the 26 th of August, 1842. 

During the publication of the laws, you will forward your 
newspaper regularly to the Department of State. It has been 
usual for the publishers of the Acts of Congress to furnish 
the Department with their respective papers for the entire 
year, and it is expected you will conform to the custom, with- 
out, however, additional charge on that account.

A copy of the pamphlet, containing the orders, resolutions, 
laws, etc., published at the end of the Session, will be sent to 
you through the post office, as soon as it shall have been 
received from the press. You are requested, upon its reach- 
ing you, carefully to compare its contents with the publica- 
tions in your newspaper, and should there be any omission in 
the latter, within the limits of these instructions, to supply 
the deficiency without loss of time. 

Your compensation will be at the rate of one dollar for 
each printed page of the above named pamphlet laws, etc. , 
published by you according to thee instructions. 

Together with the pamphlet, there will be transmitted a 
form of account and receipt to be signed by you (or in case of 
a transfer of the paper, by the new publisher or publishers 
whose name or names shall have been communicated as above 
directed) and sent to this Department for payment. 



To the Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means. 1 

Department of State, Washington, Feb. 1845. 
SIR: The following table exhibits the number of foreign 
missions and consulates, and the number of regular clerks in 
the Department of State, together with their compensation at 
different periods.

From this it appears that from the year 1818 to 1845, a 
period of 27 years, there has been an addition of only four to 
the regular number of Clerks in the Department of State, of 
which number only one has been appointed in the last eighteen 
years. 

In the period embraced in the table, the number of Missions 
and Consulates has been nearly trebled, and the duties of the 



1 Original in the archives of the Department of State, Report Book, Vol. 6 ; text derived

LETTEES OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 641 



Department have, probably, been quadrupled. Man}^ of these 
additional duties have been performed by extra clerks em- 
ployed under various acts and resolutions of Congress. Of 
these, there has been as many, at times, as eleven, exclusive 
of those employed on the Census. At present there are eight. 
Nor has there been less than this number at any time (except 
for short periods) during the last four years. 

By the law of August, 1842, it is enacted, "that no extra 
clerks shall be employed, in any Department Bureau or office at 
the Seat of Government, except during the Session of Congress, 
or when indispensably necessary to answer some call made 
by either House of Congress at one Session to be answered at 
another." However beneficial such an enactment may be in 
its general operation, it is obvious that it must at times prove 
embarrassing in a Department, in which there has been an 
addition of but one to the number of regular Clerks, in the 
long period of 18 years, during which the population and re- 
sources of the Country have been greatly increased, and the 
duties of the Department increased in probably an equal pro- 
portion. 

The Act of August 16 th , 1842, makes it the duty of the 
Secretary of State, to lay before Congress, at the commence- 
ment of each Session, "An Account of Such Changes and 
Modifications, in the Commercial Systems of Foreign nations, 
by treaties, duties, and imposts, and other regulations, as may 
have come to the knowledge of the Department." Under this 
act, and under the various calls made by the Senate and House 
of Representatives for information respecting our Commercial 
relations with foreign nations, an irregular commercial and 
statistical Bureau has grown up in the Department, composed 
exclusively of extra clerks. 

It is very desirable that there should be a permanent Bureau 
of this kind connected with the Consular Bureau; and as the 
clerks in this Bureau must, for the proper performance of 
their duties, have a knowledge of the various foreign lan- 
guages, and a minute acquaintance with foreign moneys, 
weights, and measures, together with much other general 
information, they ought to be suitably compensated for their 
labors.

Both the British and French Governments have such 
Bureaux, which make very copious reports, on whatever is 
supposed to be of interest, in the Commercial relations of 
other Countries. The knowledge which they seem to appre- 
ciate so highly, cannot be of less importance to us than it is 
to them. 

Under these circumstances I submit to your Committee, and 
through you to the House of Representatives the propriety of 
taking such measures as will (without increasing the expenses 
of the Government) make it practicable to effect a better 
arrangement of the Department, in respect to the Clerks 
employed, than exists at present. I would especially suggest 
the propriety of passing an act, to authorize the appointment 
of a Clerk with a salary of $1450 per annum to take charge of 
a Statistical and Miscellaneous Bureau, and also of making 
the usual annual appropriation, in the general appropriation 
Bill, of $2,000 for extra clerk hire and copying. 1 

The accompanying table exhibits the amount paid for extra 
clerk hire, and copying, from January 1 st , 1841, to December 
31 st , 1844, inclusive of what has been paid under resolutions 
calling for information, and other resolutions and acts of a 
specific nature.

To THE PRESIDENT. The Secretary of State to whom has 
been referred the Resolutions of the Senate of the 4 th inst. 
requesting the President " to communicate to the Senate, if in 
his opinion not inconsistent with the public interest, whether 
Mr. Duff Green does now hold, or has lately held any Diplo-

M r . Duff Green was appointed Consul of the United States at 
the Port of Galveston in Texas on the 12 th day of Sept., 1844,

to this appointment, and that he neither holds nor has held 
any Diplomatic, or other official station near the Government

Department of State, Washington, 15 th February, 1845 
Sm: In answer to your inquiry as to what provision it is in 
my opinion desirable to adopt for a permanent Mission in 
China, I beg leave to suggest the expediency of making an 
appropriation for a Minister Resident with a Salary of Six 
thousand dollars per annum, and an outfit of the same amount, 
to which there should, it seems to me, be added, a Secretary 
and Chinese Interpreter with a Salary of two thousand and 
five hundred dollars per annum. This provision is much less 
than is made by other governments having similar relations 
with China, and the rate of compensation is but moderate, 
having in consideration as well the expenses of living in that 
country, as the importance of the duties to be performed by 
the Minister.

Conversations with Francis Wharton, February 18, 20, 1845 > l 

On Tuesday, February 18, I called on Mr. Calhoun. fie 
was at his lodgings, at the U. S. Hotel, in Washington and I 
found him in his bedroom, he having only partially recovered 
from an attack of congestive fever which had much endan- 
gered his life. As he rose to meet me, on my entering the 
room, I was much struck with the emaciation of his frame, 
and the feebleness of his gait. He was much thinner than 
before, his eye was glased, his cheek hectic, and his voice 
broken by cough. He spoke, after a few moments conversa- 
tion on other subjects, about the Oregon negotiation. I saw 
him again on the Thursday evening following, and on both 
times he enter[ed] very fully into our foreign as well as our 
domestic relations. He said that the Oregon correspondence 
was, he trusted, coming to a satisfactory conclusion, and he 
spoke with great pleasure of the courtesy with which it had 
been conducted. He was sure, however, come what might, 
that the South w d earnestly stand up against the dismember- 
ment of the continent. 

The South had always done so; 
e.g. The war of 1812, 

and the N. E. boundary negotiation, in which he believed he 
had rendered much service. He mentioned that when Mr. 
Benton's bill was pressing, to fortify the disputed territory, 
he called on Mr. Wright, with whom he had previously had 
no intercourse, and told him a war was inevitable, if the bill 
passed. He suggested the bill to authorize the president to 
raise 50,000 volunteers on an emergency. The bill passed 
unanimously. He wished that on the Texas question, a simi- 
lar spirit had been manifested by the North. He believed 
Texas was essential to the interests of the South, and North 
also. What it might work on slavery, he c d not say, but he 
presumed that it would gradually wear slavery southwards. 

He said the words "concurrent majorities" were the essence 
of the constitution. He thought that the safety of the coun- 
try depended on checks. He objected vehemently to Dorrism, 
as breaking down all constitutional checks.

He spoke very kindly of Mr. Adams, saying, however, that 
adversity had had an influence on him by no means genial. 
Mr. A. was always in earnest; and when in Mr. Monroe's 
cabinet, had shown much energy, public spirit, and knowledge 
of expedients, though but little tact. He was too apt to be 
rash &c. 

Mr. M c Duffie he mentioned with great respect; 

He said that sh d he not remain in the cabinet, he w d return 
home, and that his mind was firmly concluded not to return 
to the Senate. His health was decaying, and he was desirous 
also to finish a work he was then engaged in on political 
economy.

Washington 26 th Feb 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR, The last Steamer brought yours of the 28 th 
Jan y . with letters from Anna to her mother, Patrick, and 
John. 

I am happy to inform you, that 1 am in a great measure 
recovered from the effects of my late illness. It was a case 
of an inflammatory fever, with a strong congestial tendency. 
My recovery has been very slow; occasioned in part, I doubt 
not, from being compelled to see company and to attend to 
business, as soon as I was able to leave my bed. 

I have delayed writing to the last day by the Steamer, in 
the hope, that I should be able to give you information of the 
fate of the question of annexation of Texas and the formation 
of the Cabinet. Strange as 'it may appear, neither is yet 
known, although it is now but six days to the 4 th of March. 
It is thought the vote on annexation will be exceedingly close; 
so much so that a single vote will turn the scale either wa} T . 
It will probably be taken to night. 

Of the formation of the Cabinet nothing certain is known. 
The impression is, that the present will all go out, and an 
entirely new one formed, at the head of which will be M r 
Buchannan. Whether it be true or not, a few days will deter- 
mine. As to myself, I have personally no solicitude. I 
am and have been throughout perfectly passive, and have 



646 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

requested my friends to be so. Indeed, if invited, I should 
not remain, unless the organization of the Cabinet should be 
such as to be in the main satisfactory. 

I will see M r Beele on the subject of the patents, and let 
you know the result by my next; but I must say, I do not see 
how your right can be secured in them without your name 
appearing, or being liable to appear, which, although there 
is nothing wrong in it, would, I think, expose you in your 
present position to unpleasant imputations. 

I am much obliged to M r Tampier for the present of wine 
he proposes to send me as a sample, but, if I should not 
remain in office, which is probable, I would regret his sending 
it, in that case; as I would not be able to render him the aid, 
that I would otherwise desire, to effect the object he has in 
view. 

I have not had time to read your publick dispatch, by the 
last Steamer. Your suggestions in reference to the grade of 
charge de Affaires, appear to me to be well founded, and will 
be taken into consideration, if I should remain in office. I see 
many changes, which should be made in connection with the 
Department. 

I am rejoiced to learn, that the health of Calhoun is per- 
fectly restored. I felt very uneasy about him. I hope the 
indisposition of the child will prove light. We are all well. 
Say to Anna that I have no time, or 1 would write to her. I 
must conclude, as the time for closing the mail is just at hand. 

All join their love to you and Anna. Tell Calhoun that 
Grandfather hopes he is a good boy; and Kiss him and his 
sister for me.

Department of State, Washington, 27 th Feb y ., 1845 
SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your 
note of the 20 th ultimo, communicating, for consideration, an 
extract of a letter you had recently received from Her Britan- 
nic Majesty's Commissioner of Boundary, which contains sug- 
gestions for the more rapid execution of the duties of the j 
Joint Boundary Commission, during the approaching summer, |

and recommending Colonel Estcourt's suggestions to the 
attention of this Government. 1 

I have duly submitted your communication to the President, 
who cheerfully recognizes the soundness of the suggestions 
therein made. 

The attention of Major Graham, the Head of the American 
Scientific Corps, has also been invited to the subject; and it 
will be perceived from the accompanying extract of a letter 
from that officer, explanatory of some of the causes which 
have superinduced the delays adverted to by Colonel Estcourt 
in the execution by the American Commission of the labor 
assigned to it, that those causes were beyond the control of 
this Department and are not attributable to any want of energy 
or industry on the part of that Commission, but principally 
to changes in the original organization of the American Scien- 
tific Corps. 

It is much to be regretted that circumstances should have 
arisen to retard in any way the progress of a work in the 
completion of which the Government of the United States and 
that of Her Britannic Majesty both feel a lively interest; and 
I beg you to be assured that no efforts shall be spared by this 
Department in endeavoring to meet, as far as practicable, the 
suggestions of Colonel Estcourt in the further prosecution of 
the Joint Survey and demarcation of the line of boundary in 
pursuance of the provisions of the Treaty of Washington.

Washington 11 th March 1845 

MY DEAR ANNA, I leave today for Fort Hill. Yesterday I 
terminated my official character as Secretary [of] State, and 
passed the office to M r Buchanan. M r Polk did not invite me 
to continue. In an interveiw, which he requested, he in- 
formed me, that he had concluded to form an entirely new 
Cabinet, when he proceeded to express his high respect and 
confidence in me, which he concluded by offering and urging 
me to accept the Mission to England. I declined accepting in

a mild, but decided manner; reciprocating his kind. expres- 
sions; informed him that I had heard the annunciation of his 
course without dissatisfaction; that I had accepted the office 1 
held with reluctance and on the condition, that I should retire 
when the negotiations which brought me in were finished, 
and concluded by saying, as he had decided that my services 
could be dispensed with, it releived me from all responsibility 
and permitted me to return to the repose of private life earlier 
than I had anticipated, but not than I desired. After some 
conversation on other subjects, we parted, he renewing his 
kind expressions, and I wishing him success in his administra- 
tion. I immediately resigned my office to take effect as soon 
as my successor was ready to take possession and informed 
him of the fact 

At the desire of M r Buchanan, I remained in until yester- 
day. I acted towards him as kindly and liberally, as if 1 had 
been invited to continue and had declined, giving him full 
information, with my advice on all points how to proceed. 
Throughout I have put myself above the suspicion of dissat- 
isfaction or chagrin, of which I felt not the least. In fact, 
the course pursued towards me in not inviting me to remain, 
has relieved me from a good deal of embarressment. Had I 
been invited, I should, with my views of the probable course 
of events, judging from the composition of the Cabinet and 
the language of the inaugural on the subject of the Tariff, 
been compelled to decline, which I could not have done with 
satisfaction, on the part of my friends, without assigning my 
reasons; and that I could not have done without coming at 
once to an open rupture with the administration under unfa- 
vourable circumstances. But, as it is, I retire freed from all 
responsibility, with the good will of all, including the admin- 
istration, and the regret, I may say, of almost the whole coun- 
try, with no small censure on the administration, for not in- 
viting me to continue. I may say, I never stood higher or 
firmer in the opinion of the country. I have been thus full, 
because I suppose, that both you and M r Clemson would desire 
to know, under what circumstances I retired from office. I 
doubt not, in M r Buchanan he will have a good friend in 
office. . . . l

To Thomas G. Clenison. c. cr~ 

Fort Hill 23 d March 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote Anna by the last Steamer, just 
before I took my departure from Washington; and informed 
her, that on my return, I would visit the Cane Brake and 
write you, as to the State of your affairs there. I now write 
to fulfil my promise. I spent one day there, and road over 
the whole place, with your neighbour M r Mawbly, with whom 
I quartered at his request while there, in company with M r 
Bland your new Overseer. It may be proper to premise, 
that his predecessor had left of his own accord without notice 
a short time before, and without insisting to be paid, for the 
two months he had staid in the Second year; and that M r Maw- 
bly after sending for M r Vaughn and consulting him, in the 
absence of Co 1 Pickens on a visit to Alabama, had employed 
M r Bland, at the rate of $200 a year. He is experiencefd] in 
the business, having been engaged in it for 9 years, and has 
the reputation of being a good overseer. He is married, but 
has no children, and is to be found bread and meat. 

I found the place, all things considered, in good order. 
The fences had all been new built, or repaired; the oats were 
up and looked well; the ploughing nearly finished preparatory 
to planting. It seemed to me to be well done. He intended 
to commence planting corn the day after I left. His crop 
will consist of 120 acres in cotton, 110 in corn and TO in oats. 
The Horses and Mules were in reasonable good plight; the 
hogs I saw looked well, and had, I learned, increased fast, 
and the sheep appeared to me to be in fine order. There 
were 19 lambs. I did not see the cattle. 

The negroes all continued to enjoy health; and appeared 
contented. The Houses had advanced slowly for the want of 
lumber. M r Mawbly has been, 1 have no doubt, very atten- 
tive. He informed me, that he had written you, that he 
could not continue his supervision longer than July next; but 
would cheerfully give any advice to M r Bland, whenever 
desired. He puts great confidence in him, both as to skill and 
attention to business; and, 1 think, the prospect is fair that 
he will do well. 

I got home yesterday, and found all well excipt William 



650 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Lowndes, who had the measels. He was very sick when I 
arrived, and spent a very bad night; but seems quite conva- 
lescant today. I went over my place to day, and find it in 
excellent order. It has been greatly improved since you saw 
it. I venture to say, that few places in the State, are in better 
order. I have not seen the Devon Bull }^et; but hear, that he 
is a fine animal, and is in good order. . . . 

On my return home, I spent a day in Richmond, and had a 
most cordial reception from my friends. I saw and conversed 
with all the prominent men of the party, including M r Ritchie, 
who presided in a dinner party of about 20 plates, given by 
my intimate friends. He gave a toast complimentary of me, 
which was followed by three others, expressly naming me as 
the candidate for '48. The whole was unexpected to me. My 
friends there are intelligent, ardent and united. They will 
open the campaign for the April election on high anti Tariff 
grounds. M r Siddon, 1 one of the most intelligent and ardent, 
was nominated by a large convention, the day I was there, 
as the candidate, against Botts; and will turn the discussion 
on the Tariff. The inaugural is regarded as not satisfactory 
on the subject by our friends. 

I also spent a day in Charleston; and was most cordially 
received, without distinction of party. The Hospitality of 
the city was voted me. A large party of Gentlemen, not less 
than 100 dine[d] at the Hotel with me, and a publick dinner was 
tendered, which I declined. I had requested to be received 
quietly. I found in Charleston, and as far as I have learned, 
that the Cabinet and the inaugural are both unpopular in the 
State; as I believe they are throughout the South, if not the 
Union. I say but little in reference to either, especially the 
former. It would be both impolitick and improper. My 
course towards the President and his Cabinet has been marked 
with great liberality, and has been felt by them to be so. M r 
Buchannan has spoken every where in the highest terms of it, 
as far as he is concerned. He pronounced it to be above all 
praise. 

William Lowndes joins his love to you and Anna. Kiss the 
dear children for their grandfather. My health is quite 
restored.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 651 

To James Buchanan. 1 

Fort Hill, 24 th March 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR, I enclose several letters which I hope you 
will have forwarded to their destination. 

May I express the hope that M r . Wise 2 may be continued 
at Brazil. I am sure one better qualified cannot be selected 
to take his place, and I know that it would be convenient and 
desirable for him to remain longer there. 

1 am aware that there was no kind personal relations be- 
tween him and the President, while they were both members 
of the House, but I know that M r . Wise took a decided inter- 
est in his election and has ceased to have any unkind feelings 
on his part. 

The President can best judge what course it would be 
proper for him to take, but it seems to me, that a decision on 
his part to retain him, would be an act of magnanimity that 
would do him credit. 



To CJuirles J. Ingersoll? 

Fort Hill 12 th April 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, I agree with you in opinion, that the next 
session of Congress will disclose many divisions and striking 
circumstances in the distribution of parties and the course of 
events, and that it is quite uncertain, where the majority will 
be found in either House. 

There is no telling what will be the result of the next four 
years. Things were never more uncertain, than at present. 
I look on, from this distant point, silently and calmly. 

I am not at all surprised, that you should be tired of the 
wasting distractions of continual party contest. They have, 
of late, turn[ed] out as fruitless, as they have been exhaust- 
ing. I have long believed, that our s} r stem has been working 
wrong, and cannot but fear, that it is reaching a crisis, which 
it will be difficult for it to pass.

I am very much gratified to learn, that you are engaged in 
writing an historical sketch of the late war, and that you have 
already made such considerable progress in the work. I hope 
you will make it more than a sketch before you are done, 
especially in its political and philosophical aspect. 1 In that, 
it is a rich subject, which, as yet, remains untouched. Its 
battles are nothing comparatively. In your fuller under- 
standing of the subject, in its more interesting aspect, you 
will have great advantages over all, who have yet attempted 
the history of that important event in our history. 

It is to me, as to yourself, a source of much pleasure, in 
taking a retrospect of the passed, to reflect, that our long 
acquaintance has never been mared by a single incident, in 
the various scenes, through which we have passed together. 

I, on my part, have commenced an enquiry into the ele- 
ments of political science, preliminary to a treatise on the 
Constitution of the U. States; but know not whether I shall 
ever have time to finish it.

Fort Hill 25 th April 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, The last mail brought me yours by the 
Great Western of the 24 th March, and one from Anna to her 
mother by the same conveyance. 

My letters subsequent to that of the 26 th Feb., acknowledged 
by yours, will give you all of the political news up to the date 
of the last, transmitted, if I recollect aright by the Hibernia. 
Since then, the most important, is the dismissal of Blair 
and the Globe, and the adoption of Ritchie and a new paper 
to be published by him, 2 as the organ of the administration. 
I am not certain, that it indicates any change of policy; but it 
is a great point to get clear of Blair and his u filthy sheet." 
Ritchie will be at least decent and decorous; but I apprehend 
too little elevated for a Government paper, and too much 
devoted to the old clique and party ta ticks to produce any 
considerable change in the policy of M r Polk and his cabinet.

Britain finally extended to four volumes. Philadelphia, 1845-1852.

I hope, I may be deceived. I am sincerely anxious, that the 
administration should go right, and shall take no ground 
against it, unless I should he forced by its acts to believe, that 
they are resolved to restore to power the miserable clique, 
which was overthrown at Baltimore; and on the overthrow of 
which, Mr Polk was raised to power. 

You are 'right in your opinion, in reference to Everett. 
Elmore has had the mission he fills tendered to him. He has 
declined the place, but on grounds which will lead probably to 
the renewal of the tender, and his acceptance. . . . * 



To Francis W. Pickens. 2 

Fort Hill 6 th May 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, I cannot disapprove of your declining the 
mission to England. I see many difficulties in any Southern 
man accepting it under existing circumstances, and yet, it is 
highly desirable that it should be filled, on many accounts, by 
a man true to the South and all its interests. In addition to 
the reasons you have assigned, there are others connected with 
the Oregon question as it stands, which, I fear, would make 
the position of a minister in England who is true to the South 
embarrassing, should he be charged with any duties connected 
with it. I fear Mr. Polk has taken a false view of that im- 
portant question. The remarks of the inaugural in reference 
to it, have made it impossible to settle it by negotiation, unless 
he retracts, or explains away what he has said, which would 
be almost as embarrassing. But, what I regard as still more 
unfortunate; it will, I fear, make it impossible to take the only 
course, if it should fail, by which we ever had any chance of 
getting the whole Territory; that is by standing still and let- 
ting time and emigration settle the question. Our true policy

dent to send Calhoun to England. The President replied that he had offered it to another. 
Green presumed him to mean Pickens, and urged Pickens to advise Polk to appoint Cal- 
houn, saying that Calhoun would not hold the position long, that Pickens could soon 
succeed him, and that meantime (a matter of the greatest importance) Calhoun could 
settle the Oregon matter, which the President would intrust to him but would not intrust 
to Pickens. (See the letter of May 22. )

was to treat the subject amicably and quietly, and, if negotia- 
tion failed, hold on to the joint occupancy, and leave it to 
England to terminate it, if she should so decide. I doubt 
whether she would, had the proper course been pursued. In 
that case, it would have fallen quietly into our hands. 

I saw the danger, and endeavoured to guard M r . Polk, in 
my first interview, against it; but, as it seems, in vain. I, also, 
endeavoured to guard M r . Buchanan, but I know not whether 
with more success. A War with England about Oregon would 
be the most fatal step, that can be taken; and yet there is great 
danger it will come to that. In my opinion, if prevented, it 
must be by the Senate and the South. The question might 
have been successfully managed. I saw my waj- clearly through 
it, and left it in a good way. . . . 



To Abbott Lawrence. 



c. c. 



Fort Hill 13 th May 1845 

MY DEAK SIR, I received a few days since your letter of the 
30 th April, containing the conditions on which you and your 
friends propose to accept the offer of myself and my son to 
borrow $30,000. On due reflection I have concluded to decline 
your proposal. 

In offering to pay annually 100,000 pounds of picked cotton 
of good quality or its value in the Boston market at the time, 
on the loan of the proposed sum, my calculation was based on 
an estimate, that at six cents the pound, we could spare that 
amount, after deducting all expenses. Believing that it might 
be safely estimated, that the article would not fall below that 
price, I felt safe in making the offer. As our means depended 
on cotton, I regarded it proper to offer it as the basis on which 
our anual payment would depend until the loan should be 
reduced. The offer was intended as a business transaction 
and accordingly our engagement to be met with perfect punc- 
tuality as well as the debt to be perfectly secured. Thus 
intended, I must decline accepting your offer, because at 6 
cents the pound, (the present average) we would not be able 

1 From a draft in Calhoun's handwriting. Abbott Lawrence, the eminent Boston capi- 
talist and manufacturer. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 655 

to pay as you propose $6,000 annually on the principle and 
interest in addition. 

You must permit me to suggest another reason, which, if my 
impression is correct would of itself compel me to decline. 
The impression your letter made on my mind is, that your 
offer is made from a disposition to oblige me on the part of 
yourself and friends, and that with some inconvenience to you 
and them. If I am right, as greatly as I am indebted to you 
and them for your kind feelings, I could not accept, for 
reasons which I feel assured you will duly appreciate on 
reflection. When I wrote you, I had supposed that a loan 
might be effected from the state of [the] money market on 
terms mutually advantageous. It was only on that supposi- 
tion that I could make the offer, or accept the loan. 

I am much gratified to learn that the manufacturing inter- 
est is so prosperous and the prospects so bright. 1 hope it 
may be fully realized. I am particularly so to learn that you 
are so successful in commanding the foreign market. It is 
impossible for manufacturers, in their present advanced state 
to attain high prosperity, if exclusively dependent on the home 
market. The great point for that purpose is to get posession 
of the foreign market; but for that purpose, high duties 
instead of aiding, is a great impediment to that. The relation 
between imports and exports is so intimate that the one de- 
pend on the other. This the manufacturers of England begin 
to understand and hence the immense exertions which they 
are making in favour of reducing duties and free trade. They 
have already succeeded in repealing the duty on cotton, in 
order that they may get the raw material as low as you do 
and will not stop until they repeal them on food when they 
shall be able to feed their operatives as cheaply as you do 
yours. In repealing they look to the foreign trade; and when 
it shall be fully effected and low duties and free trade become 
the established policy, they will successfully compete with 
you in the general market of the world with high duties and 
a restricted commerce. No one can be more desirous than I 
am that you should be successful in commanding the foreign 
market. I would much rather see our cotton go abroad in 
the shape of yarn and cloth than in the raw state; and when 
the price instead of being ruled by the foreign shall be ruled 



656 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

by the home market. When that is accomplished all conflict 
between the planter and the manufacturer would cease, but 
until then every measure which restricts our foreign ex- 
changes acts as a burthen on the former. I object to high 
duties, among other reasons because they are, in my opinion, 
the great impediment to bringing about so desirable a state of 
things. I am no opponent to manufactures or manufactu- 
rers, but quite the reverse. I rejoice in their prosperity. 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 22 d May 1845 

MY DEAR ANNA, The last Steamer brought me yours of the 
13 th April. 

I have been very punctual in writing to you or M r Clemson, 
excepting the interval of my sickness. If you have received 
fewer from me, it was because I was almost his sole corre- 
spondent in the family, while you had several beside nryself. 
Latterly, however, since I left the Department, I have written 
you and him alternately. 

It was scarcely in the power of M r Polk to treat me badly. 
I would consider it, at least, as much a favour to him for me 
to remain in office under his administration, as he could to me, 
to invite me to remain. Indeed, as his cabinet was organized 
and the views expressed in his inaugural in reference to the 
Tariff and his imprudent declaration in the same in reference 
to the Oregon question, I could not have remained in, had he 
invited me. I did my best in a conversation I had with him, 
a week or ten days before he delivered his inaugural, to guard 
him against the course he took in reference to Oregon, but it 
seems in vain. I fear it will give the country much trouble 
to escape from its effects. It has greatly increased the diffi- 
culty of settling the question, and has lost us the only chance 
we ever had to secure the whole, and may, in the end, lose the 
whole. 

You will have seen, that after I declined the mission, it was 
offered to Elmore, who declined it, and then to Pickens, who 
did the same; and that it is now rumoured, that it will be offered 
to me, with full power to adjust the Oregon question and to 



LETTEKS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 657 

negotiate a commercial treaty. I have no idea it will, and, if 
it should be, I will certainly not accept, if I can possibly 
avoid it. 

I was not aware until I took charge of the State Dep*. of 
the immense influence, which may be exerted through it on 
foreign and domestick relations. I found its duties had been 
shamefully neglected. I had nothing to sustain me; the 
administration without a single advocate in Congress and very 
feeble in the country, with a most inefficient organ, and both 
parties, or rather the acknowledged leaders of one party and 
both leaders and followers of the other, opposed on its lead- 
ing measure, that of the Annexation; and yet with all these 
disadvantages, I have succeeded, by a bold unhesitating 
course, to secure Annexation, and leave a strong impression 
behind, both at home and abroad, in the short space of less 
than 11 months. I say secured; for Maj r . Donalson, our 
Charge, writes me by a letter received by the last mail, that 
he regards annexation as now certain. The publick voice of 
Texas is almost unanimous, and the GoV*. l has been compelled 
to sucumb. While conducting the Texian question success- 
fully by bold and decisive measures, I was conducting the 
Oregon with equal success, by a quiet, amicable, but firm 
course. I ;>aw my way clearly through it, and would have 
terminated the negotiation last winter in time to be laid before 
Congress, had M r Pakenham received instructions from his 
Government, as early as he expected, at [the] stage of the 
Discussion at which I left it. ... 

[P. S.] If an opportunity should offer, I will forward a half 
dozen copies of my speeches &c to the State Dep*. to be sent 
to M r Clemson. I have put another volume apart for Cal 
houn, with his name inserted. I have recommenced in good 
earnest my preliminary treatise on the elementary principles 
of political science, and made good progress toward finishing

Fort Hill 23 d May 1845 

Mr DEAR SIR, The last mail brought me your two letters of 
the 24 th April and 13 th Inst; the latter containing the gratify- 
ing intelligence, that all the obstacles in the way of the 
annexation of Texas have been removed, and that there is no 
doubt now of the consumation of the great measure. It is, 
indeed, a great measure, in whatever aspect it is regarded, 
and has been effected under great difficulties. For the very 
important part you have acted towards accomplishing it, the 
country is greatly indebted to you. I saw from the first the 
use, which it would be attempted to be made of M r . Walker's 
amendment to the House bill, 2 and that it endangered the suc- 
cess of annexation. Gen. Houston and the Government of 
Texas could not have taken any other ground so well calcu- 
lated to defeat it, if such had been the design, as to have the 
negotiations opened anew under the amendment. Had it suc- 
ceeded, whatever may have been the terms agreed on by the 
Commissioners, the treaty (for such it would have been) would 
most speedily have been rejected by the Senate. There is a 
settled and fixed opposition to the measure in all and every 
form, in that body, which can not be overcome. Seeing this, 
I could not doubt, that whoever was opposed at bottom to 
annexation in Texas would take their stand, not in direct oppo- 
sition to annexation, but against the House bill, and in favor 
of the amendment; and that all the foreign influence that of 
Great Britain and France, would be thrown in the same direc- 
tion. Under this impression, I took a most decided stand 
against it from the moment the measure was first offered in 
the shape of. an independent measure by Co 1 Benton, and it 
was with great difficulty and after much exertion, that I de- 
feated it in that shape ; in which had it passed, annexation 
would, from what has transpired, have been clearly lost. The 
Government of Texas would have had the whole game in its 
own hands, and could have defeated it by delay and throwing

Part n, port.)

ing Benton's measure with the House bill, left the President free to make new terms with 
Texas instead of those in the original House bill.

in embarassing propositions in its way. I also used my best 
efforts to defeat it in the shape of an amendment, from the 
same impression, but in vain. Failing in that, I lost no time 
in preparing and giving the instructions, based on the House 
resolutions, which I did as the only possible means of pre- 
venting the loss of annexation, and which, most fortunately, 
you have so ably and successfully carried out. The present- 
ing it in the first instance as an ultimatum was a bold and 
masterly stroke. On that the success of your movement 
depended. The course taken by D r . Smith, Secretary of 
State, 1 in opposition to annexation surprised me. I had 
regarded him as a firm friend of annexation. I received two 
letters from him in 1843; one after 1 had left the Senate and 
retired to my residence here, giving me a full account of the 
intrigues of the abolitionists with the British Government, in 
reference to Texas, and the countenance which they received 
from Lord Aberdeen. I enclosed the one 1 received here, to 
M r . Upshur, in a long letter addressed to him, and urging on 
him the necessity of adopting some decided measure to defeat 
a scheme, which, if it should succeed, must prove fatal to the 
South, and the Union. The information which the Doctor's 
letter contained, and the views 1 presented, I doubt not had 
due influence in bringing about the negotiation which fol- 
lowed, and which we may, I trust, now say with certainty, 
will end in annexation. 

I received the information you give in reference to Gen 1 
Houston's course, in strict confidence, as you desire; and wish 
you to consider what I write in the same way. I have not 
looked over my papers, but have no doubt, but that the letter 
to which } r ou allude, is among them, if it has been received, 
as I doubt not it has.

MY DEAR SIR, I am much obliged to you for your atten- 
tion to the subject of Miss M C K nights letter, which I enclosed 
to you.

660 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I have not been without deep solicitude about Texas, and 
am much relieved by the intelligence you give through Gov r . 
Yell, 1 that unconditional annexation is certain. I did not 
doubt that many of the influential men of Texas were at heart 
opposed to the measure, and apprehended that they would 
seize on the amendment made in the Senate to open negotia- 
tions anew, if possible, under pretext of objections to the 
House resolutions, but in reality to defeat the measure. If 
that had been done, annexation would have been lost. It 
would have placed the question completely in the hands of the 
Texan Government. Even as certain as the success of the 
measure may now appear, I trust the administration will not be 
so confident as to relax its vigilance. England has her heart 
deeply fixed on defeating it, as I saw from the first, and will 
leave nothing undone to accomplish it; and unfortunately the 
Texan Government, whatever professions it may make, will 
zealously cooperate with her. 

I am glad to learn that a feeling exists in the administration 
in reference to the Oregon question, such as you believe, I 
would not object to. I have all along regarded that, and not 
Texas, as the dangerous question; and have believed, and still 
do, that, if England intends to take a belligerent stand against 
us, Oregon will be made the pretext. She has nothing to 
stand on as far as Texas is concerned; and would have to sub- 
mit quietly, when annexation shall have been accomplished, 
however deeply opposed to it, if no other question of contro- 
versy between us could be drawn in as a pretext. Hence, 
while I conducted with decision and boldness the Texan ques- 
tion, I treated the Oregon with gentleness, but firmness at the 
same time. I have, in fact, on more general views, thought, 
from the beginning, that to be quiet, to do nothing to exalte 
attention, and leave time to operate, was our true policy, the 
only one, indeed, by which we could secure the whole Terri- 
tory; and that the opposite not only involved the hazard of 
war. but the final loss of the whole Tei^ritory. My aim was so 
to conduct the negotiation, that its failure should not involve 
a rupture of the friendly relations between the two countries, 
and in that case, to use the influence of the press and Govern- 

i Archibald Yell, governor of Arkansas 1840-1844, killed at Buena Vista. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 661 

rnent to curb in the West, so as to prevent the rescinding of 
the joint occupancy and the taking- of any step that might be 
considered a violation of the Convention; and leave it to time 
to decide the question. I regard the joint occupancy as our 
trump card, which secured the game, so long as we held it. 
I would not give Great Britain a farthing for her claims, if 
she would stipulate not to disturb it, on her part; My dread 
was that she would rescind; and hence the importance I at- 
tached to keeping quiet. Thus thinking, I could not but regret 
that M r . Polk mentioned the subject in his inaugural, and es- 
pecially in such a way as to give the British Government the 
opportunity of coming out as it has. 

I see the English papers already talk of rescinding on their 
part. I am of the impression, that we have lost the opportu- 
nity of securing the whole territory; and that the only alter- 
native left is to settle it by negotiation, or by the Sword. 
The last would be a sad appeal. I cannot doubt but it would 
end in the loss of the territory, or a disgraceful peace; one 
condition of which would be to take the offer of Great Brit- 
ain. We might take Canada, but we would have to surrender 
it back to get Oregon, or rather a part of it. My hope now 
is, that the aversion of both countries and both governments, 
I trust, to such an appeal, may lead to an adjustment on rea- 
sonable terms by negotiation. Such was the hope I enter- 
tained when I left the Department. I am the more encour- 
aged now to hope, from the strong prospect that the annexa- 
tion question will succeed by the almost unanimous voice of 
the people of Texas, which will cut off all motives for hostil- 
ities on that score. I see nothing to change in the opinions I 
delivered three years since in the Senate on the subject of 
Oregon. 

I am obliged to you for enclosing M r . Ritchie's note, although 
it was not necessary for the object he had in writing it. I 
saw the articles from the Herald it enclosed, but they made 
not the least impression on me. I know too well what credit 
is due to political letters to permit them to make any impres- 
sion on me. 

I take the occassion to say, that I was gratified when I 
learned that M r . Ritchie had become the Organ of the admin-

istration, 1 and have no doubt he will acquit himself with ability 
and honor in his highly responsible position. He has my 
best wishes for his success. Of his friendly feelings towards 
me, I do not doubt; though candor compels me to say, that I 
think from some early unfavorable impression he has, or 
rather, I hope I may say, had formed an erroneous opinion 
of my motives and course as a publick man, which has pre- 
vented him from doing me full justice. 

As to .the special Mission, I am and have been of the opinion, 
it would be an injudicious step, and have frequently so ex- 
pressed myself. The question can best be settled at Washing- 
ton; and if I recollect aright, I so expressed myself to M r . 
Buchanan before I left the Department. I am sure, it is use- 
less for me to say, that whatever movements may have been 
made in reference to it, were made without my knowledge, 
and against my judgment. All I wish is, that M r . Polk and 
his administration may carry through successfully the Texan, 
the Oregon, and Tariff questions, with all others which may 
touch the peace, the liberty, or prosperity of the country. 

The dispatch, or rather the letter to M r . Shannon, to which 
you allude, was not sent. If you will recollect, it was confined 
to expressing the views of the Government in reference to the 
course, which led to the suspension of diplomatic intercourse 
between him and the Mexican Government. It supported 
him in general, but expressed disapprobation of the part of 
his last communication which looked like an appeal to the 
Mexican people against their Government. The letter was 
approved by the Cabinet, but it was thought advisable not to 
send it, until there should be further developments of the 
course events might take; as things were very uncertain at the 
time in Mexico. Shortly after, intelligence was received of 
the breaking out of the Revolution, which ended in the over- 
throw of Santa Anna. Deeming it highly important that we 
should be ably represented in Mexico, in the turn events had 
taken, and that Gov r . Shannon's position and relation to the 
Mexican Government were such as to forbid intercourse be- 
tween them, and of course, to make his service of no avail at 
so critical a period, I saw the President, stated my views to

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 663 

him, and suggested the propriet}^ of his addressing a private 
letter to the Gov r ., as a friend, stating the circumstances, 
which might render diplomatic intercourse of great impor- 
tance, and the difficulty of opening it with him, and suggest- 
ing for his consideration the propriety of resigning under such 
circumstances. He agreed to adopt the course, and requested 
me to prepare the letter. The next day I was taken sick, and 
continued unable to attend to business for more than a month. 
After my recovery, I brought up the subject with the Presi- 
dent at my first interview, and it was concluded to be too late 
and the administration too near its close either to send the 
letter I had prepared for Governor Shannon, or to write the 
letter he intended to address him. 

In conclusion, I reciprocate the expression of pleasurable 
feelings, which the recollection of our association, and that of 
the other members of the late Cabinet, always excite in my 
bosom. 

M ra . Calhoun joins me in kind remembrance to yourself and

Fort Hill 7 th June 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 25 th April to me and 
Anna's of about the same Date came by the regular packet. 

Your political reflections are just. Nothing is wanting to 
enable the South to have a decided control in the presidential 
election, but firmness, but the great difficulty has heretofore 
been with Virginia, under the guidance of M r Ritchie. His 
policy has been to act in concert with the party in Pennsyl- 
vania and N. York, as the most certain wa} r of succeeding in 
the election; and for that purpose to concede something of 
our principles to secure their cooperation. The effect has 
been to detach Virginia, in great measure, from the South, 
and to lower the standard of the principles, which first 
brought the party into -power, and to divide and distract the 
South. But things have much improved of late in Virginia, 
as the last election shows. The Whigs have been signally 



664 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

defeated; but what is still of much more importance, defeated 
in a fair canvass and by State rights men on State rights prin- 
ciples. The state may now be said to be under the control of 
our friends; young men of talents, decision and integrity, 
who are on good terms with M r Ritchie, but not under his 
control. They are resolved to oppose him, if he should 
refuse to sustain our principles, and policy, which he will 
not do, should he tind it would place him in a minority 
in the State, as it certainly would with their opposition. I 
hope for much from this state of things. If Virginia should 
go right, the whole South will rally around her, when victory 
would be certain, bringing with it the restoration of the Con- 
stitution and the reformation of the Government. The pros- 
pect is certainly better than it has been for many years. 

Far as I can learn, there is no hostile feelings towards me 
on the part of M r Polk and the administration. I learn from 
a friend, who spent several days at Washington a short time 
since, and had free conversation with the President and most 
of the members of his Cabinet, that they spoke in the kindest 
and most respectful terms of me, and my conduct while in the 
State Department, especialty of my communications to M r 
PaktMiliMin on the subject of Oregon. It seems, that they 
were read in Cabinet, and the highest eulogy pronounced on 
them, particularly by M p Bancroft. 1 Nor do I think, that'M 1 ' 
Ritchie is hostile; on the contrary, I have many reasons for 
thinking, that his feelinga have undergone much change of 
late in reference to myself, but it may be, not sufficient to 
give me a preferance. All things considered, I think, the 
opposition to me has abated greatly; while my positive 
strength has greatly increased within the last 12 months. 

M 1B Calhoun is writing to Anna by the conveyance, which 
takes this, and will give all the local and domestiek news, 
which will make it unnecessary for me to repeat it. It is 
excessively dry. I have had but one good rain in upwards of >2 
months, and that did not wet the ground thoroughly. . . .

MY DEAR SIR, ... I fear with you, that Wise is pursuing 
an injudicious course in reference to the Slave trade. 1 My 
instructions to him were full and pointed on the necessity 
of preserving the most friendly relations with Brazil in every 
respect. It would be greatly to be regretted, if he has taken 
any Step, calculated to have a contrary effect. 

We have had several occurrences of deep interest growing 
out of the movements of the abolitionists. The Baptist and 
Methodist churches have both been divided into Slave holding 
and non Slave holding. The exposition of the cause leading 
to the seperation of the latter has been put forth in pamphlet 
form. It was written by D r Bascom; 2 and is one of the fullest 
and most powerful vindications of the South and its institu- 
tions, which has yet appeared. It will do great good. Gov r . 
Hammond has published two letters to M r Clarkson, 3 which 
are attracting great attention. They are well written and 
must do good. It is gratifying to see the South taking higher 
and higher ground on this vital subject. If 1 had a spare copy, 
I would send you D r . Bascom's Pamphlet. 

I made a visit to Abbeville last week to errect the monument 
to my father, mother and sister. I found M r McDuffie much 
better than I expected. His Speech is not afl'ected, and he 
still retains the power of moving his leg. The nerves of sen- 
sation are not at all effected. He is cheerful and hopeful. I 
saw nearly all of our relatives, and found them all well. 
Crops, with few exceptions, looked badly. We are all well 
and all join in love to you, Anna and the children. Kiss them 
for their grandfather. ...

To James II. Hammond. 1 

Fort Hill 7 th July 1845 

MY DEAR SIR. You are now so fairly enlisted, and with so 
much eclat, as the defender of the institutions of the South 
against the assaults of the abolitionfists], that you will not be 
permitted to sheath your sword. The object of this commu- 
nication is to call on you to strike another blow in the cause. 

I know not whether you have seen and read the Rev d D r . 
Bascom's Review of the Manifesto of the Majority. It is a 
very able production, and fully vindicates the course of the 
Southern portion of the Methodist [Church], in sepe rating 
from the Northern portion. The step is a very important one 
in a political, as well as in a religious view of the subject. It 
seems to me, it is very important, that the publick attention 
should be called to D r . Bascom's Review, and that the praise, 
which he and his associates, and the whole of the Southern 
portion of the Methodist Church are so well entitled to for 
their conduct, in this important affair, should be liberally 
bestowed on them. 

It seems to me, also, that for that purpose, due notice ought 
to be taken of the work in our papers, to be followed by an 
Article, of which it should be the subject, in the Southern 
Review. 

There is none more competent to the task than yourself; 
and I do hope you will not decline it. As you may not have 
seen the production, I send you a copy for your use, which I 
received from Tho. B. Stevenson of Frankfort Kentucky. I 
have acknowledged the receipt of it in a note, in w r hich I ex- 
pressed, in strong terms, my approbation of the production, 
and the obligation, which the South was under to the Doctor 
for it. It accompanies the Mail, which takes this.

shall observe the confidence you request. It is a singular 
production and is clearly intended to frighten M 1 '. Polk into 
unqualified submission. That is the present scheme of the 
Albany politicians, and the prospect is that they will succeed. 
The end would be the overthrow of the party and the success 
of the Whigs, unless, indeed, the portion of the party who 
rallied at Baltimore to save the party, shall again raise the 
standard, and make another rally to save it before it is too 
late. The New York Dynasty may destroy the party, but 
can never again rise to power. That is fixed. 

You give me much curious information and I hope you will 
continue to write me fully and freely. From present appear- 
ance things will fall into inextricable confusion. I appre- 
hended it before I left Washington, and what has since hap- 
pened has but confirmed my apprehension. M r . Polk had a 
clear course. If he had relied on those who elected him, with- 
out making war on those who opposed or coldly supported 
him, and shaped his policy by the Baltimore resolutions, he 
would have had a brilliant and successful administration, but, 
as it is, the prospect for him is far from flattering.

Fort Hill 2 d Aug* 1845 

MY D;<:AR SIR, Although I agree with you that there are 
several points, on which D r . Bascomb does not agree with us 
on the subject of abolition, yet his defense is so full and 
abounds with so much that is good and well said, that it is 
calculated to do a vast deal of good in portions of the South 
particularly, that are not as sound, as our State, that I 
thought it highly desirable, that publick attention should be 
called to it. I think it the more desirable on account of his 
hi^h standing and influence in his church, and as the head of 
the Kentucky University, where we need strengthening. It 
is a powerful antidote to the poison, attempted to be dessem- 
inated by C. M. Clay 2 in that State. He would feel the com- 
pliment of a well written article, and 1 still hope, you will

prepare one for the Mercury or some other of our papers, if 
the Review should be closed. It need not occupy more than 
a column; and some general expression might be used to 
except the parts, we do not approve, to which he could take 
no exception. The object of the Article might be limited to 
a complimentary notice and to attract publick attention. 

I am gratified to learn, that you have turned your atten- 
tion, with so much Zeal, to agricultural improvements, and 
wish you the greatest Success; but you must not think of 
looking on with indifference on publick affairs. As often as 
we have been disappointed, we must still persevere to put and 
to keep the Government right. Perseverance and boldness 
are the two great qualities, without which nothing can ever 
be effected in politicks, that will be permanently useful. I 
may well claim the right of retiring and closing my publick 
life; but you younger men, who are still in the prime, and 
are capable of rendering great service, must not think, that 
you have served out your tour of duty yet. 

1 take great interest in agricultural improvements, and will 
certainly make you a visit, should I ever be in your vicinity. 
So far from considering it an intrusion, I should regard it 
quite a compliment to receive M r Allan's publication. 1 have 
never yet written anything on agriculture. I regard myself 
but an undergraduate; to receive and not to give instruction. 
Indeed, if I were inclined to write, I have not leisure amidst 
my other occupations. I would give you such a sketch of my 
Hill side draining, as you desire, but it is with me so much a 
matter of mere application to my particular place, that I should 
find it very difficult to lay down any, but a very few general 
[directions], by which to construct the drains. I make it, in 
my case, a mere matter of good sense. I have never seen its 
application, but on my own place. The descent must be just 
such, as to carry sand, which, I suppose, to be usually about 
3 inches in 10 or 12 feet, but it depends a good deal on cir- 
cumstances, particularly the volume of water. The greater 
the less descent is necessary, but the ditch, in that case, must 
be made proportionally large and strong. If your brother 
takes much interest in the Subject, he had better make a visit 
and inspect mine. I would be glad to see him, and he could 
better understand the subject, by one day's inspection, than 
by reading a volume. I have succeeded so well, that a field,

which is very rolling, has now the 13 th Crop; the two first in 
corn, and the other 11 in cotton, with the exception of one 
in wheat, and is free from Gullies or [illegible} spots. But 
which is still stranger, the present crop is equal to any it ever 
bore, although it has not been manured, except a small piece 
of old ground, I took in. Its yield, for the last three years, 
has not averaged less, than 240 pounds of clean cotton to the 
acre, and I expect as much this year., as dry as it is. It was 
oak, hickory and pine land of good quality; more light than 
heavy. 

To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 12 th Ag* 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . You have formed a very correct 
opinion of the State of political affairs with us. The Adminis- 
tration is very weak. Its course has neither indicated wis- 
dom nor firmness. My letters from Washington, (one from 
a very intelligent and well informed observer) says, that there 
is to be an entire change of policy ; that the V. Buren party 
remain discontented, notwithstanding that they have been tie 
recipients of almost all the Executive favours, and that the 
Administration now see it, and are resolved to take an inde- 
pendent course. It is strange, that they did not see, from 
the first, that the proper course was to command, and not to 
purchase them ; that they stood in a position from their passed 
misconduct, to be commanded, with ease and certainty; but 
that to attempt to purchase them, was but giving them power, 
and that to do that, was but to change their relative condi- 
tion, and to enable them to command the administration, 
instead of being commanded. 

All join in love to you, Anna and the Children. Tell them 
that I wish to see them much and Kiss them for their grand- 
father. I will write Anna next.

August 18, in Part II, post.)

pimphlet, and the feelings of the Southern Methodists 
towards it, and which are entitled to much consideration in 
relation to the subject of your letter. I had read it cursorily, 
and although there was a good deal, that I could not approve, 
yet it was so much sounder on the subject of abolition, than 
what I had expected from him, and that quarter, that it 
seemed to me to deserve an encouraging notice from the 
South, with an allusion, that would not be offensive, to the 
parts which did not accord with our opinion. I however, 
acquiesce in the conclusion to which you have come, as you 
have paid much more attention to the contents of the pamph- 
let, than I have, and are far more familiar with the connected 
circumstances. You must, however, permit me to say, that 
1 think you do not do the Doctor justice, in identifying his 
opinions either with Casius or Henry Clay on the subject of 
abolition. The former is one of the most rabid of fanaticks, 
and goes all lengths against the South and its institutions. I 
do not think the latter an abolitionist, but I should be glad 
to think him as sound, as D r . Bascom on all points. But 
enough of this. 

You are right in taking all possible precautions in your 
correspondence with Tappan. If you give him the least 
chance to pervert what you write, and misrepresent you, he 
will be sure to use it. A fanatick, to promote his object, 
regards neither truth, justice nor honor. The course you 
think of taking is the right one. The last of the topicks, you 
think of discussing, to trace to its true cause the decay of the 
South, deserves an elaborate investigation, which I hope } T OU 
will give it. It has been often touched on, but has never yet 
been discussed and presented in the full light, it ought to be. 
Abolish custom Houses and let the money collected in the 
South be spent in the South and we would be among the most 
flourishing people in the world. The North could not stand 
the annual draft, which they have been making on us 50 
years, without being reduced to the extreme of poverty in 
half the time. All we want to be rich Ls to let us have what 
we make.

inland. I am glad you are making such experiments. You 
are setting a highly useful example to our large educated 
planters, in being doubly engaged; in defending our institu- 
tions, and improving our agriculture. It is what all owe to 
the State and the South, and I hope your example will be 
extensively followed. I am endeavoring to do something 
both ways. 

If the Administration should act with firmness and discre- 
tion, we shall either have no war with Mexico, or one, that 
will give little trouble, unless England should countenance 
her, and that she will not do, unless she should calculate on 
heavy difficulties with us about Oregon. That and not Texas 
has all along been the dangerous question; and I, from the 
first, so regarded it and acted accordingly. England is ex- 
ceedingly averse to war with us on many accounts, as we 
ought to be [to] one, with her. It would be calamitous in 
the extreme to both countries. But, if we should force her, 
she will resist us on the Oregon subject. M r Polk made a 
profound blunder in alluding to it at all in his inaugural. 
The last administration said all that should have been said in 
a short Message to the Senate in answer to a call of M r Allen, 
just before the close of the session. 1 Nothing could be more 
imprudent, or more improper, than the remarks he made. It 
has left the subject in the worst possible condition. As it 
stands, I cannot see any other alternative, but for him to back 
out, or a conflict with England, if Congress should sustain 
the inaugural. I left the subject in a fair way, and felt con- 
fident of conducting it with success. The annunciation of the 
inaugural alarmed me, and I fear the worst. Much will 
depend on the course taken by the Southern Senators. My 
fear is, that England will dispair of settling it, and run it 
into the Texan question. If so, she will greatly encourage 
Mexico to take hostile measures.

it; but the state of our affairs, external and internal, is so 
critical, that I should feel it my duty to seive, if the state 
should request me. I fear the Oregon question will lead to 
difficulties with England. The administration, I fear, will 
not meet it, as it ought to be. In its present entanglement, 
it requires not only great skill and prudence, but great firm- 
ness and decision to avoid a conflict between the two coun- 
tries. Whether we shall have war with Mexico or not, in my 
opinion, depends on the fact, whether we are likely to have 
one with England or not, in reference to Oregon. It cannot 
be doubted, that Mexico is entirely under the control of Eng- 
land; and that she will be strongly opposed to a war between 
us and Mexico, unless she should conclude, that she will be 
forced into a war with us about Oregon. In that case she 
will, of course, desire to unite Mexico with her, as an ally. 
With the aid of British gold and British officers, she would 
be a very useful one to her and not a little formidable one to 
us. I say forced into a war; because I believe she is exceed- 
ingly desirous, on many accounts, as we ought to be, to avoid 
a war; yet folly and weakness may force the two countries 
into deadly conflict. . . . 



To James H. Hammond.^ 

Fort Hill 28 th Sep r . 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, I have just received yours of the 26 th Ins't, 
and you must excuse a hasty answer, as I am on the eve of 
leaving home on a visit to my son in Alabama. 

I concur in the opinion, that we ought to take the highest 
ground on the subject of African Slavery, as it exists among 
us; and have from the first acted accordingly; but we must 
not break with, or throw off those who are not yet prepared 
to come up to our standard, especially on the exterior limits 
of the Slave holding States. I look back with pleasure to the 
progress, which sound principles have made within the last 
10 years in respect to the relation between the two races. All, 
with a very few exceptions, defended it a short time since on

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 673 

the ground of a necessary evil, to be got rid of as soon as pos- 
sible. S. C. was not much sounder 20 years ago, than Ken- 
tucky now is, and I cannot but think the course the Western 
Baptist and Methodist preachers took, in reference to the 
division of their churches has done much to expel C Clay and 
correct publick opinion in that quarter. 

I think you ought to rejoice, if the abolitionists should 
bring out Brougham and M e Calla against you. It would open 
a fine field and give you the audience of the world. You 
would have nothing to fear from the rencountre; nor would 
you have need of any one to come to the rescue. If any 
assistance should be needed from me, as to advice, or informa- 
tion, it would be cheerfully given. 

I fear the-Tarift question will not be met by the administra- 
tion as it ought; but I am of the impression, that it is too soon 
for us to say yet, which course we ought to take, except that 
we shall withdraw all support from those in power if they 
should deceive us. We war against both the principle and 
the oppression, and ought never to be satisfied until we have 
put down the one, and freed ourselves from the other. When 
we shall see the whole ground and know our position in ref- 
erence to those in power, and the Northern wing of the party, 
we shall then be able to say, what course we ought to take; and 
that we shall before the session is over, if our delegation shall 
do their duty, as [I] trust they will. 

As to Oregon, my hope for preserving peace mainty relies 
on the indisposition of England to go to war, and the possi- 
bility of getting a majority in the Senate to take the proper 
course in reference to it. I am of the impression, that the 
whole of the atlantick states are opposed to war, if it can pos- 
sibly be avoid[ed], and the administration too, if they could 
get out of the scrape. We cannot bully England; but if a 
majority can be got in the Senate against recinding the Con- 
vention of joint occupancy on our part, I doubt whether 
England would recind it on her part; 1 and time may extricate 
us from our difficulties. All I think depends on the Senate.

Cane Brake 13 th Dec r 1845 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . You will have seen, that I have again 
been elected to the Senate, much against my inclination, but 
under such circumstances that I could not with propriety 
decline accepting. I am now on my way to Washington with 
M rs Calhoun and Cornelia, after remaining a few days at Fort 
Hill on my return from Alabama. . . . 

I had a very interesting tour in the West. I was received 
every where in a manner sufficient to gratify the feelings of 
any, the most illustrious for talents and public services. All 
parties every where united without distinction, in a demon- 
stration of respect, not exceedfed] by that shown to Gen 1 
Jackson in passing through the same places, and much greater 
than that extended to any other citizen. I every where was 
received as the guest of the place, and passed without expense, 
or charge through every town to and from Memphis. 

On my return home I found all well and that my crop, con- 
sidering the severit}^ of the drought, had yielded well. I 
shall have the place in fine order by the end of the coming 
year, when I shall commence a regular system of manuring. 

M rs Calhoun and Cornelia join their love to you, Anna and 
the children. 



[Postscript] Washington 26 th Dec r 1845 

... I find myself here under circumstances involving 
great responsibility. There is, I fear, great hazard of war 
with England on the Subject of Oregon. The question has 
become greatly complicated and the country, it seems, looks 
to me to avert the Calamity of war. I shall not hesitate to 
do my Duty, be the responsibility what it may. If the peace 
of the Country can be saved it shall be, if it can be by my 
exertions. The great point, as things now stand, is to pre- 
vent the adoption of the Resolution to give notice to termi- 
nate the Convention of joint occupancy. If that can be 
effected, and Great Britain should not become the aggressive 
party, time will be gained, when I hope the difference may 
be Settled. If the Resolution should pass, I fear there will be 
no hope of maintaining peace.

MY DEAR JAMES. ... I have read the Message hastily. 1 I 
fear we shall have trouble about Oregon. I cannot doubt, if 
the recommendation of the Message be carried out into acts, the 
termination will be war with England. I hope there is a good 
prospect to reduce the Tariff greatly. The present scarcity 
of provision in Europe will do much to effect it. The Mes- 
sage is not satisfactory in reference to it, although it is fully 
as good, as I expected. Your sister and Cornelia join their 
love to you. 



To James Edward Calhoun . 

Washington 16 th Jan y 1846 

MY DEAR JAMES. ... I see in the portions of your two 
letters, which refer to myself, strong evidence of that abiding 
friendship and deep solicitude in all that concerns me, which 
you have ever manifested towards me. But you must permit 
me to say, that I do not think you have attributed to their 
true cause, the motives, which induced me to accept my ap- 
pointment to the Senate, or properly estimated the effects, 
which it is like to have personally. 

You seem to think, that I yielded to the solicitations of a 
few persons, who were not my real friends, and that I came 
under pledges to renounce all pretensions to the Presidency. 
Neither is the case. The pressure on me to accept came from 
all parts of the Union, and every party, urging me, as I re- 
garded the peace and safety of the country, not to decline, if 
the place should be offered to me. But as strong as the pres- 
sure was, I would not have yielded my aversion to return to 
publick life again, had I not a deep conviction, that there was 

1 President Folk's first annual message. 



676 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

great danger of a war, the end and consequences of whicn no 
man can see; and that I might by possibility do something, 
to avert so great a calamity. I could not but see the danger 
and responsibility I would have to run in encountering the 
strong current in favour of war, which had been created by 
the folly and weakness of the administration; but I would 
have been unworthy of the high place, in which my friends 
desire to place me, had I yield[ed] to such considerations. 
Such are the circumstances under which I accepted the place 
and the motives which induced me to accept. I did so with a 
full knowledge of the consequences, reluctantly and only from 
a sense of duty; but without any pledge, such as that you 
allude to, or any kind whatever; and let me add, without 
any one ever suggesting the policy or propriety of such a 
pledge, except Col Pickens. This I mention, however, in 
strict confidence. I have never mentioned it to any one else. 
I attributed it in him to error of judgement. Nothing could 
induce me to give such a pledge; not from any desire I have 
to fill that high office, but from what I regard the indeli- 
cacy and impropriety of such an avowal on the part of any 
individual. 

As to my course here, and the effects it may have on me, I 
am guided solely by the views I entertain of the best means 
of preserving peace consistently with the honor and interest 
of the country, without regarding the management and in- 
trigues of Administration, or opposition, or any of the cliques, 
into which they are broken, or what effect my course may 
have on my future prospects. To defeat the War, in my 
opinion, is to gain everything, and to fail to defeat it is to 
lose all. It would leave us of the South little worth having. 
I regard it as quite uncertain, whether it can be defeated or 
not. The only hope is in the Senate. It may be there, if the 
Whigs should be united and act the part of patriots. I fear 
they will not. We are, indeed, in a strange state. The party 
desiring peace constitute a great majority both in Congress 
and the Union, and neither our Executive nor that of Great 
Britian desire war, and yet things have been so managed, on 
our part, that it is difficult to avoid it; calamitous as it must 
prove to us. 

We are all well with the exception of colds. I am laboring 
under a severe one. accompanied by a bad cough, but without

any other bad symptoms. Cuddy is much delighted and 
enjoys herself much. She has made a very favourable im- 
pression, and is indeed a fine girl. 
All join their love to you and James. 



To Andrew Pickeiis Calhoun. P. AND M. c. 

Washington 16 th Jan y 1846 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . The question of peace and war 
is still very uncertain. Every thing will depend on the 
Senate, and the course of Whigs in the body. From present 
indications notice, in some form, will be given. If it should 
be in the unqualified form reported by the committees of 
Foreign relations of the two Houses, I would regard war 
almost certain. I hope, that it may be qualified by making it 
a condition to offer the 49 th , as the basis of a compromise, or 
even a reference to arbitration, if nothing better can be done. 
My position is one full of responsibility. I shall meet it by 
a fearless discharge of duty: Thus far, I have not been unsuc- 
cessful, although badly sustained by the Whigs in my first 
move; I refer to the amendment I offered to Hannegan's reso- 
lutions. 1 Had they not opposed taking a vote on them, the 
real war party would have been seperated from the others, 
and left in a lean majority of less than a dozen. They acted 
better in reference to Aliens notice for leave to introduce his 
joint resolution to take the whole continent under our guard- 
ianship, which enabled me to acheive a decided victory. 2 
While 1 am not sanguine, I do not despair obtaining the con- 
trol, and preserving peace, by combining in all my move- 
ments the highest discretion with the greatest boldness' and 
promptitude. I have with me the wise, and the patriotick of 
all parties; and I shall be supported by the almost united 
voice of Virginia and S. C. with the most talented portion of 
the South, and the convictions of my own mind. No one can 
realize the disasters, which would follow the war, should there 
be one. I fear neither our liberty nor constitution would 
survive. . .-.

To James II. Hammond. 1 

Washington 23 d Jan y 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, Your warm and cordial approbation of my 
course, in reference to the Oregon question, is highly accept- 
able to me. It is one full of responsibility and difficulties, 
but under a high sense of duty to the country and its institu- 
tions, I shall tread it boldly, without regard to consequences 
to myself personally. Whether I shall be able to succeed in 
averting pending calamities time only can decide. The odds 
are greatly against me. The South, most unfortunately, is 
divided. The Whigs are timid, jealous and distracted, and 
many who act with me have but little resolution, while the 
extreme men, those who go for all or none, that is for war, 
are bold and decided. But the worst of all is, that the Ad- 
ministration, while it professes to desire peace and expresses] 
great confidence that it can be preserved, go for unqualified 
notice, a measure, which under the circumstances must 
almost certainly lead to war. If it should not lead to com- 
promise, such certainly will be the result; and that it will not, 
we have the President's own declaration, that there is no hope 
of a satisfactory compromise. 

But as bad as this State of things is, I do not dispair. I 
cannot doubt, but there is an overwhelming majority in both 
countries opposed to war. They are yet quiet, because they 
do not fully realize the danger; but as it approaches they will 
be roused, and utter a voice that will I hope be respected. I 
also believe, that those charged with conducting our aft'airs, 
have been looking more to popularity, than duty, and have 
been acting under the impression, that they could at pleasure 
avert the calamity to which they have exposed the country; 
but when they find their mistake, will be glad to seek the aid 
of the moderate to save themselves. Under this joint influence 
of both causes, I hope, if we of the peace party should not be 
able to prevent notice, we shall be able to amend the resolu- 
tion for giving it, so as to reopen the negotiations on the basis 
of the 4:9 th parallel, or to authorise a reference to adjust the 
conflicting claims of the two countries. 

In the meantime the change of ministry in England 2 must

have a strong bearing on the question, and I am of the im- 
pression a salutary one on the whole; but as we shall have in 
the course of a few days much fuller information, than we 
now have, 1 forbear to speculate on the subject. I shall send 
you the tirst spare copy of the Pres ts Message with all the 
documents, which I may get from the printers. It is the only 
one of any importance which has been printed. 

You ask me what you can do to aid in maintaining the great 
cause of peace. You can do much. Few men wield a better 
pen than you do. If you can get admission into the columns 
of the Constitutionalist, or any other democratick paper in 
Georgia, You might do much to rouse publick attention in that 
State to the dangerous condition in which the country is 
placed and especially the South. The abolitionists are all for 
war, with the avowed intention of crushing us and our insti- 
tutions, headed by Adams and Giddings. 



To Thomas G. Clernson. c. c. 

Washington 29 th Jan y 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, We have been very much disappointed in 
not hearing from you, or Anna by the last Steamer, which I 
attribute to some accidental failure, as I learned at the State 
Department yesterday, they had not heard from you, nor 
received your duplicate of the treaty, though M r Serruys 1 
had received his. 

The Steamer, which takes this, will take letters to Anna 
from her mother and Cornelia, which will give all the domes- 
tick and social news, and which will leave me nothing to 
communicate, but the political. 

You will have seen by previous conveyance, that 1 have 
taken my stand on the side of peace, with what success time 
only can decide. Thus far, the effect has been a very consid- 
erable abatement of the war fever, both in Congress and the 
Country. The arrival by the last Steamer has contributefd] 
farther to abate it, as the news is considered very favourable. 
Indeed, it is so much so, that there ought to be, in my opin-

and navigation with Belgium, negotiated by Mr. Clemson, and signed November 10,

680 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ion, no hesitancy on the part of our Executive to take imme- 
diate steps to terminate the controversy. I hold it almost 
certain from the contents of the English papers and from 
what I learn through other channels, that the British Govern- 
ment is prepared to adjust the difference by agreeing to the 
49 th parallel as the basis of the boundary, while I am quite 
certain, that an adjustment on that basis would be acceptable 
to a large majority of the country and Congress. And yet, I 
fear, that it is still uncertain, whether we shall be able to 
avert the opposite termination; an appeal to Arms. I fear 
that there is a state of uncertainty and hesitancy on the part 
of M r Polk and his Cabinet. I have no doubt, but that they 
are sincerely desirous of peace, and see that peace cannot be 
preserved, without a compromise, but dread taking any step 
to compromise, in consequence of the unfortunate declaration 
of the inaugural, that our title to the whole was clear and 
unquestionable. That, with the course of the organ and other 
party papers, has created an party in the Western States, 

which go against all compromise; and it is the dread of so 
large and decided a party, which causes the hesitancy. That 
party goes ardently for notice, forthwith and unqualified, 
under the belief, that it will prevent all compromise, while 
the administration urge notice as the most certain means of 
producing compromise and securing peace. Their joint influ- 
ence, 1 fear, will be sufficiently strong to carry it through 
both Houses; but, I hope, we may be able to qualify it, In- 
making it a condition, that when the notice is given, that it 
shall be accompanied with the offer of the 49 th as the basis on 
which to adjust the difference; or, if that should fail, a refer- 
ence of the question to arbitrators. Without some such 
condition, 1 fear notice will lead to an appeal to Arms, for I 
doubt whether, if the British Government should offer the 
49 th , it would be accepted by our Executive, unless Congress 
should express an opinion, which would make it his duty; in 
so awkward a condition is M r Polk placed in reference to this 
delicate subject. 

In the meantime our relations with Mexico have again be- 
come very delicate, which may involve us in a war with her. 
If it should, I greatly fear that a war would follow almost as 
a matter of course with England about Oregon. England 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 681 

would not willing stand by and see us overrun Mexico; and if 
she should feel it for her interest to side with Mexico, she will 
decline an adjustment] about Oregon. I took this view of the 
subject, while charged with the negotiations, and was anxious 
to avoid such a result. For that purpose, I was desirous of 
settling the Oregon question as speedily as possible, when I 
saw there would be no difficulty in settling our difference with 
Mexico. 

Allen's resolution against the colonization of this continent 
b}^ European powers, which was laid on the table in the first 
instance on my motion; has been taken up and referred to his 
Committee. It would indicate, that there had been a change 
of opinion on the part of the Senate in reference to it, but 
such is not the fact. It will be rejected by a decided vote 
when reported back. 

I hope you all continue to enjoy good health and the chil- 
dren to grow and improve finely. I hope also you have got 
my letters written at Alabama and since my return. 

All join in love to you and Anna, and the children. Kiss 
them for Grandfather.

Washington 25 th Feb: 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, I received yours and Anna's by the Cambria, 
and we are all happy to learn that Anna has recovered from 
her indisposition, and that you and the children were well. 
They must, indeed, be growing finely and improving much from 
her account of them, after making full allowance for the par- 
tiality of a mother. I have a great desire to see them. 

I think, I wrote you, that I was suffering under a bad cold, 
accompanied by a severe cough. It continued so long, that I 
b?gan to get uneasy; but am now in a great measure recovered. 
My general health continued good during the whole time. 1 
will not, however, dwell on what may be called personal and 
dornestick news, as M rs Calhoun has written Anna by the 
Steamer, and has no doubt tilled her letter well, with all of that 
discription. Her letter was entrusted to M r Swit, a Belgian 
gentleman, who returns by the Steamer. 



682 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I informed you in my last, that we had not heard from you 
by the Britania, that your duplicate of the treaty had not been 
received at the Department. It turned out, that the letters 
from you and Anna had been overlooked in the Department, 
and that M r Buchannan was mistaken, when he informed me, 
that your duplicate had not been received, as I afterwards 
learned by M r Markoe. The letters were received when it 
was too late to write by the Britania. I fear my letter made 
you very uneasy about them. 

I will submit your proposition about your negroes to An- 
drew, before I give an answer. Your proposal is based on 
fair and equitable principles. As soon, as I hear from him, I 
will write to you and inform you what we will do, when you 
can determine what you will do. Negroes have risen consid- 
erablv in consequence of the high price of rice and sugar. I 
hope it may prove permanent. If we should agree to take 
them, we would expect to allow you the fair average price at 
the time. 

The price of cotton is still low; but I cannot doubt, it will 
rise, as the crop is certainly short by 200 or 300 hundred 
thousand bales. We have not yet sold. Our crop yielded 
about equal to our calculation. 

I have not heard from your place; from which I infer, that 
all is going on well, as I informed the overseer and old M r 
Mawbly not to write, so long as things were doing well, and 
no advance needed from me. I will forward the package you 
refer to, as soon as the new Minister arrives, and I have 
received it. The compliment of the Belgian Government, I 
hope with you, will be returned; but 1 apprehend, that noth- 
ing will be done, or can be, until we shall dispense with 
Charges by substituting resident ministers in their place. 
My impression is, that the change is desirable; but I fear M r 
Buchannan has not nerve enough to recommend it. I would 
of course be rejoiced to see you transferred to Berlin, should 
Wheaton 1 be to S* Petersburgh, as he ought to be. You 
would be, I doubt not, of service there, but I can give you no 
reason to expect such good luck. I do not think M r Polk 

1 Henry Wheaton, minister to Berlin. (See his letters of December 24, 1845, January 
26, 1846, post.) 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 683 

much disposed to favour my friends, though I do riot think 
him hostile. The first opportunity I have, I will ascertain 
from M r Buchannan, how he is pleased with the manner you 
perform your duty, as you desire. Markoe thinks very highly 
of it. 

Things are in the same state of uncertainty, that they were, 
when I last wrote. It is now certain, that there is a decided 
majority in Congress and the country opposed to war, and in 
favour of a compromise on the 49 th ; and, if we may judge 
from Sir R. Peel['s] disapproval of M r Packenham's rejection of 
our offer, he is ready to compromise on the bases of that line. 
And yet, I fear, that the question of peace and war is still 
uncertain. The parties seem, as if they cannot get to gether. 
It is understood, that our Government, or rather Executive, 
will not make the first move towards the renewal of negotiation, 
and it is to be feared, that the English Government has gone 
as far as it can until ours makes another. In [the] mean time 
the vital interests of both are in danger of being sacrificed on 
a mere question of etiquette. 

I concur in the views } r ou express in reference to the man- 
agement of the questions belonging to our foreign relations. 
It has been such, as to entangle our relations with England, 
at a critical moment, when they ought to have been on the 
best footing, and to offend all Europe, when we had the great- 
est need of Conciliating the Continental powers. 

I have not, as yet, taken part on the question of notice now 
before the Senate; but shall before it terminates. I have 
waited developments. The Whigs are uncertain allies, and I 
have to act with caution. 

This is the last day for the Steamer and it is now nearly 12 
oclock at night, and I must stop. 

Say to Anna, I shall next write to her, and would have done 
so by this, had it not been for the pressure of engagements. 
I am compelled to see company almost incessantly, which, 
with my correspondence and senatorial duties, leave me no 
leisure. My love to her and Kiss the children. Tell them 
how much I wish to see them, and that their grandfather is

Washington 23 d March 1846 

MY DEAR ANNA, ... I enclose you a copy of my speech 
delivered last week on the Oregon question. 1 I shall en- 
close several to M r Clemson, but the one enclosed is intended 
especially for yourself. Many of my friends think it the best 
I ever delivered. It was certainly received in a manner highly 
calculated to be gratifying to myself and friends. I received 
congratulations on all sides when I sat down, even from tl.e 
most violent of the 54 40 men. Such was the anxiety to hear 
me, that the crowd began to collect at 8 o'clock, and long before 
the hour the galleries and the passages were blocked up. 
Thousands had to retire for the want of room. 

I spoke very late in the debate, after, indeed, it had begun 
to drag very heavily, and delicacy forbid me from toud - 
ing on the subject of title. I felt the delicacy of my position, 
and could not (knowing the great anxiety to hear me) but feel 
some solicitude; and was not a little relieved when all was 
over, and I could perceive from indications' all around, that I 
had not fell below expectation. 

But in the midest of these gratifying indications, I soon saw, 
that I had excited the jealousy of party leaders on both sides. 
Their Organs, the Intelligencer and the Union, gave sure indi- 
cations of that. I had addressed notes to the editors of both 
in the morning requesting them not to publish the reports of 
my speech, until I had an opportunity to see and correct them; 
but in spite of all the precaution I took, the Intelligencer 
published without regarding my request and against my re- 
monstration to its foreman who brought me the report at night 
when it was too late to correct, and what was more indicative 
of party jealousy, inserted it in the midest of other matter, 
without even mentioning it, or giving the least hint, that I 
had addressed the Senate. It was with great difficulty I could 
prevent the Union from publishing without my correction, 
and when it published, it was done without affording me an 
opportunity of correcting the proof, and then placed on the 
outside of his paper, where usually matters of no importance 
are inserted, without adverting to it or making any remarks. 
I mention these things, not that they annoy me in the least,

but that you may know to what petty jealousy I am subject. 
My letter to King was treated the same way, but it forced its 
way against all attempts to keep publick attention from it, 
and such will be the case in the present instance, if I may 
judge from what has already occurred. 

I have said more about myself, my dear daughter, than I 
would to any one else, not from any feeling of vanity, but 
because I know it would gratify you and M r Clemson to learn 
in what manner my effort on such a question was received by 
the audience on the occasion. As to the publick at large, if I 
may judge from the papers and my letters, I never made an 
effort of the kind that was received with greater favour, as 
far as I have had an opportunity of judging. The praise of 
the papers have been in many instances extravagant, and from 
quarters which one would not expect. I give as an example an 
extract from Mike Walsh's paper, 1 which is the organ of what 
may be called the lowest strata in the New York population. 

As I have many letters to write before the steamer leaves, 
and as your Mother writes by that which takes this, I must 
conclude with Grandfather's love and kisses to the dear children.

MY DEAR SIR, I received by the last Steamer your two 
letters. As to M r Grund 2 and his publication, which you 
enclosed, I cannot learn, that they have made the least impres- 
sion, or that they have been even noticed. I am of the im- 
pression, neither deserve notice, as far as you are concerned. 
My former letters will have informed you of the mistake in 
relation to the non reception of the treaty and your's and 
Anna's letters; and that originated with the Secretary. The 
treaty is now before the Senate, and will be acted on probably 
this week. Your letter to M r Mably and the package have 
been forwarded to him; the one by mail and the other by a 
safe private conveyance. I enclose a letter to you from your 
Overseer. You will see that all are well, and, I doubt not, 
vour business is going on well. I wrote under so much haste

in my last and proceeding letters, that I omitted to notice the 
compliment bestowed on me by M r Bouron, 1 the editor of the 
Moniteur and what you said in reference to republishing my 
speeches in England. A notice so highly complimentary from 
so competent a judge is indeed very flattering and acceptable, 
and I wish you to present one of the copies of my speech on 
the Oregon question (herewith enclosed) to him in my name, 
as a mark of my respect. I must refer you to my letter to 
Anna for particulars, as to its reception on this side of the 
Atlantick. 

1 would of course be glad to see the volume of my speeches 
and &c republished in England, including the present and a 
few others omitted in the American edition. If you find it 
can be done, I will furnish the additional speeches. 

Of the other copies of my speech on the Oregon question, 
one is intended for yourself and the others to be disposed of 
as you please. The translation and publication of one in the 
German language might have a good effect. 

I enclose also a pamphlet on the copper mines of Lake 
Superior, which may be interesting to you. They are said to 
be rich both in silver and copper; indeed, to be more so than 
any other known mines. 

On the subject of politicks, I can s&y but little that is satis- 
factory. Our affairs have become much entangled both at 
home and abroad. You will see in my speech on Oregon, that 
I have reasoned the question of notice, as it stands on the 
face of the Message; and have opened a door for M r Polk, 
and the 54. 40 men to support compromise now in the veiw 1 
take, in consequences of a change of circumstances. But, I 
fear, that the real truth of the case is, that the Message was 
in its character diplomatick, and that notice was recommended 
to play the game of intimidation a desperate game certainly 
with so great a power as England. The result has proved 
such, as ought to have been anticipated; great uncertainty as 
to the real intention of the Executive, and the division and

your speeches (I loaned him the copy I have) than from any work he had ever read, 
and that the solution of many questions treated here found a solution in a phrase in 
your speeches. He also remarked that your speeches were infinitely superior to any-

distraction of the party, with the loss of confidence on all 
sides, and a timid vacillating course on the part of the Execu- 
tive, afraid to compromise or to take any other step. 

It is a state of things from which I fear the worst. In the 
meane time, our relations with Mexico is becoming critical, 
in consequence of the position, which our army in Texas has 
been ordered to take on the del Norte, below Metamoras, and 
far in advance of our settlements, without any appearant 
reason, as far as I can see. Under such circumstances, I can- 
not but legard the future as uncertain; and the contingency 
of war and peace as doubtful, while a moderate share of 
sagacity and firmness might in a short time, secure the bless- 
ings of the latter and avert the calamities of the former.

Washington 29 th March 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, As I have written you and Anna by the 
Steamer, which sales on the 1 st April, I now write simply to 
inform you, that the treaty has been ratified by the Senate in 
a manner highly honorable to you. 1 There was but one vote 
against it, and that only on general grounds, opposed to all 
reciprocal treaties in reference to Navigation. It seems to be 
generally admitted, not only that the treaty was highly advan- 
tageous, but that it was the best treaty of the Kind we had 
ever made. The result was the more honorable, from the 
fact, that when first taken up, a few days since, I had great 
fears from the extent of the opposition indicated, and the 
quarter from which it came, that it would not be ratified. 
Some objections were made to the details, but the main were 
directed against all treaties of the Kind, and ground taken 
that none of the existing should be renewed. So strong was 
the opposition, that there appeared no prospect of ratification 
without material amendments, especially by limiting its dura- 
tion to a short period, say three years. But at the next meet- 
ing discussion brought out fully the merits of the treaty, 
when it passed with the smallest possible minority. I had to

to me and does great credit to you.

MY DEAR JAMES, ... I sent a few days since a copy of 
my speech on the Oregon question and Fremont's report 1 to 
you and also to James. I hope they both have been received. 

The Oregon negotiation has been wretchedly managed. 
The difference ought to have been adjusted long since; but as 
it is, it is so entangled, that much uncertainty still hangs over 
it. I cannot, however, believe that there should be such folly 
and mismanagement as to involve the two countries in war. 

My speech has been received, I may say, with unbounded 
approbation. 1 wrote to James a few days since.

Washington 25 th April 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, We are very happy to learn by your's and 
Anna's letters by the last Steamer, that you are all well and 
the children are improving so much. 

Judging by what we witness at home in reference to the 
management of our foreign relations, I am not surprised to 
learn, that they are so badly managed abroad. I do not see 
how the management here could be worse. With proper 
management the Oregon question and the Mexican difficulties 
could have been long since settled, and the embarressment 
and consequent great sacrifices attendant on the State of un- 
certainty for the last six months all avoided. But, I trust, 
the wisdom and firmness of the Senate has overcome the follv

of the administration, and that the Oregon question will ere 
long be settled and war avoided. Our triumph has been com- 
plete, in both Houses of Congress and the country, of which 
the majorities in the two Houses on the resolution for giving 
notice affords an indication. With little exception, the vote 
seperates the war and peace parties. The former is rather 
weaker and the latter stronger than it indicates. In the 
Senate the former does not exceed eight out of fifty six. In 
the country, I would say, the peace party is still stronger in 
proportion. This great change has been effected by the 
Senate against the entire influence of the Executive; a great 
majority in the House; and a strong current in their favour 
in the Community, and the weight of the press against us. 
The only difficulty in the way of reaping the fruits of this 
great victory is, that the notice may be used, not as a means 
of reopening the negotiations on our part, but of extorting 
an offer from Great Britian. In that case, the offer, if made 
by Great Britain, may be an ultimatum; and that in turn 
gives rise to new difficulties. I trust, a course so hazardous 
may be avoided, but I fear. . . .

MY DEAR SIR, The last Steamer brought a note from you to

she is much pleased, and a letter from Anna to Cornelia, but

the del Norte. The papers will inform you as to what has 

occurred, and what action has been taken by the Executive

and Congress. The Senate you will see has not as yet decided 
on the question in its bearings on our relation, as to war or 
peace with Mexico; but the question whether we shall recognize 
what has occurred as war, or declare war, will come up proba- 
bly in two or three days. It is a grave question, and will prob- 
ably be much discussed. 

I deplore the occurrence every way and in every respect. 
As a Mexican question, it is to be deplored without looking 
beyond; but I regard that far less so, than its effects on our 
European relations. I fear, that it may arrest, or even defeat 
the settlement of the Oregon question, and introduce the inter- 
ference of both England and France before it is concluded. 

I have not yet read the documents, and of course have not 
made up my mind definitely as to the stand I shall take; but 
I fear the weight of the responsibility for this sad state of 
things will rest with our Executive. 

We are all well and all join their love to you and Anna with 
Kisses to the children.

p. AND M. c. 



Washington 14 th May 1846 

MY DEAR ANDREW, You will have seen by the papers that 
war is declared, and the course I deemed it my duty to take 
in reference to it. Never was so momentous a measure 
adopted, with so much precipitancy; so little thought; or 
forced through by such objectionable means. I saw the 
danger from the first, as soon indeed as it was known, that 
Gen 1 Tajdor had been ordered to take post on the del Norte, 
and said to my friends, that the movement ought to be ar- 
rested and that I would do it, if my position on the Oregon 
question, which required, that I should maintain my relations 
with the administration, would permit it. I went so far as 
to state the same to several of the leading Whigs, and added 
that some of them to whom the objection did not apply, 
ought to make a movement. They thought with me as to the 
danger, but made no movement. 

As soon as hostility commenced, and it was understood that 
the President intended to send in a Message, it became ap- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 691 

pearent to me, that war would be the result, unless the ground 
should be taken to separate the repelling an invasion, from 
war constitutionally considered. I apprised my friends of 
the danger, and arranged it with them to make the distinc- 
tion and to take a stand on it; but the Message so blended 
the two, that they found it impossible to seperate them in 
the House, and finally, from the fear of being isolated, voted 
for the bill. 

In the Senate, we succeeded in seperating the two, and 
sending all that related to preperation and repelling invasion, 
to the Committee on military affairs, and that which related 
to war to that on foreign relations. I then supposed, we 
should have time for a deliberate discussion of the latter 
which I felt assured would have limited operations for the 
present to repelling invasion. But in this I was disappointed. 
Contrary to the order of the Senate, the Committee on Mili- 
tary affairs reported a bill including both the raising of force 
and a declaration of war, and which is worse, our friends in 
the Senate had attended a Caucus, and thoughtlessty agreed 
to it. I saw at once the case was hopeless, and took without 
hesitation the course I did. No other alternative, indeed, 
was left me. 

1 fear what was done in a hurry will long have to be re- 
pented at leisure. If the war should not be settled speedily 
by some fortunate occurence, it will prove one, I fear, of 
great disaster. It has dropt the curtain on the future; but 
my apprehension is, that it will arrest, and even probably 
defeat the arrangement of the Oregon question, and invite 
the interference of the great European powers. But time 
will show; and we must abide its disclosures. It only re- 
mains for me to do my duty in the new position in which the 
country is placed.

country is much excited and very high. There is no country, 
not even France, in which there is a stronger inclination to 
war. Our people are like a young man of 18, full of health 
and vigour and disposed for adventure of any discription, but 
without wisdom or experience to guide him, and I fear that 
we shall have the fate which usually befal such. While I 
admire the sperit, I regret to see it misdirected. The war 
might have been easily avoided; but now that we are in it, the 
only question is how shall it be brought most promptly to an 
honorable termination? Should it be prolonged, it may 
involve the country in much danger and great embarress- 
ment. I shall be very solicitous to learn how it will be 
veiwed by England, France and Europe generally. I am not 
without apprehension, that it may prevent the settlement of 
the Oregon question; and finally involve us with England. 
It presents to her powerful motives each way, to a peaceful 
and to a hostile policy. Neutrality will enable her to absorb 
a large portion of our commerce; while it would enable us to 
overrun Mexico and dictate a peace according to our own 
terms, probably. 

The Tariff will be taken up in the House, as it is under- 
stood, next week, and the prospect is thought to be good to 
pass the bill for reducing it, as reported by the Committee. 
The session, I fear, will continue until August. 

I enclose letters to Anna from her mother and Cornelia, 
which will give all the news. Tell Anna, I will write her by 
the next Steamer. Kiss the children for their Grandfather. 
Love to all. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 29 th May 1846. 

MY DEAR SIR, I have received your letters of the 16 th and 
22 d Inst. They both give strong proof of your friendship, 
which has ever been so true, and good sense. 

I have seen enough of publick men to come to the conclusion, 
that there are few, indeed, whose attachment to self is not 
stronger, than their patriotism, and their friendship. The 
principle difference is only in the degree that the former is 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 698 

stronger than the latter, and hence a very few, indeed, can be 
relied on in great political emergencies, where adhering to the 
right endangers their political standing and present popularity. 

But I make allowance for all this in conducting publick 
affairs; just as the mechanick does for friction in that of ma- 
chinery. We must take men as they are, and do the best we 
can with them, constituted as they are. If all were disinter- 
ested patriots, there would be little difficulty in constructing 
or managing the political machine; and very little merit in 
doing either. 

I have been put to a severe test during the present session. 
I came here to preserve peace both in reference to Oregon 
and Mexico. 1 saw they were connected questions, and that 
both might be satisfactorily adjusted without appeal to Arms; 
but that in the order of things, the Oregon must be first set- 
tled. After that was done the Mexican would settle itself 
without difficulty. I accordingly directed my efforts in the 
first instance to the former. The task was difficult. The 
Administration, the House, the Country, and a strong party 
in the Senate, were in favour of a course, which would cer- 
tainly lead to war. I succeeded in arresting it, and that too 
with great gain of popularity and publick confidence. 

In the mean time, the executive, acting with profound 
secrecy, ordered our Army to take position on the del Norte 
opposite to Matamoras, against authority of law and Consti- 
tution. As soon as it was known, I saw the danger, would 
have moved to arrest it, if possible, had not my position on 
the Oregon question, which required, that I should maintain 
my friendly relations with the administration, in whose hand 
the negotiation was placed by the Constitution, prevented me. 
At this period, I saw some of the leading Whigs, to whom 1 
communicated my apprehension, and my reasons for thinking 
the movement ought to be arrested, and why I could not 
attempt it, and why also I thought one of them ought, to 
whom the objection to my making the attempt did not apply; 
but without succeeding to induce any one to undertake it. 

That followed, which I apprehended, when the only alter- 
native to war left was to limit, in the first instance, our 
preperation to repelling hostilities; and to gain time thereby 
to consider and determine on the propriety of a formal 



694 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

declaration of war. I immediately went to work to prepare 
our friends to take that ground, but the Executive pressed 
forward the two together so decidedly, that our friends in the 
House had not time to rally, and were swept by the force of 
circumstances without time to reflect or express their opinion, 
to join in the vote for war. In the Senate we succeeded in 
seperating the two, by sending the military preperations to 
the Committee on Military affairs, and the part of the message, 
relating to war, to the Comtee on foreign relations. It placed 
the control in our hands; and had not Benton gone away, and 
reunited them by reporting the House bill, without striking 
out the parts relating to war, and ref ering that to the foreign 
relations, I would have succeeded in effecting the object I had 
in view, which would have made the war, for the present, 
merely one to repel invasions, without placing the country in 
a beligerent condition. But as it was, I was forced, without 
having an opportunity to express my opinion, except very 
briefly, to take the stand I did. 

It has, for the present, weakened me with the party and 
the unthinking portion of the Community, and made it unad- 
visable, now, to take the course you suggest, relative to the 
coming election. My present position is to wait quietly for 
a good opportunity, and the subsiding of the existing excite- 
ment, to put myself right before [the] country and the world. 
In the mean time, what 1 have lost with the thoughtless, I have 
more than made up by the increase[d] hold on the confidence 
of the reflecting. I have no apprehension as to the final 
result. 

We are all well, and your sister and Cornelia join their love 
to you and the boys. Tell William, I have got his letter and 
will answer it the first leisure. I hope he is getting on well 
with his studies.

intend to do full justice to the subjects involved in it; and that 
I have written by the Steamer, that takes this, to M r Clemson 
in reference to his place and the political occurrences since 
my last, and that the same conveyance takes a letter from 
your sister to you, which I may safely assume gives all the 
domestick news, I am sure, you will not expect a long 
letter from me, as long as is the interval, since the date of 
my last to you. 

Indeed, I have but little left to write about, but myself, 
which you know is not a very prolifick one with me; but I am 
sure there is none more welcome to you, who has ever been so 
devoted a daughter. I am then, in good health, but am still 
troubled with a cough, especially in damp weather, of which 
we are in a spell long enough and dark enough to do credit of 
the Belgian climate. As yet, we see no end to it. My cough 
neither effects my appetite, sleep nor appearance; and I hope 
it does not affect any vital function. So much in reference to 
myself personally. Politically I have more to say. 

I came here to preserve the peace of the country, if it could 
be, consistently with its honor and durable interest. It was 
menaced with an English and a Mexican war, in consequence 
of the great mismanagement by the Executive of the Oregon 
and Mexican questions. I may now say with confidence, that 
I have succeeded with the first. For particulars, I refer you 
to my letter to M r Clemson. I say I, for I think I am fairly 
entitled to the credit, and that, I would say is the opinion of 
the Senate and the country. I have not been so fortunate 
with the last; but, I trust, that the victories of our Arm} 7 , and 
the effect, which the Oregon treaty, (as I may now call it) will 
have on Mexico, will soon bring that to a close. 

Had time been afforded for discussion even a single day, I 
f 3el confident, that 1 would have been able to limit the Mexi- 
can war to the repelling of hostilities, in which form, it would 
a 1 most of itself come to a close, with the termination of the 
Oregon question; but, as it is, the end is more uncertain. 
Personally, I have lost something with mere partisans, in con- 
sequence of the stand, I was compelled to take towards it; 
but I have more than compensated it, by the increased hold it 
has given me, on the confidence of the patriotick and reflect- 
ing. But, it has had one effect, which I arn sure will surprise 



696 AMEEICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

you. It has been the occasion to make publick, the bad feel- 
ings of Co 1 Pickens towards me, which I had believed, for 
sometime, he had cherished. Taking the advantage, of what 
he regarded as the evidence of the war being popular, and my 
stand not so, he came out openty in a speech in a publick meet- 
ing at Edgefield against me, in strong denouncing language, 
as I learn. 1 My friends were much more surprised at his 
course, than I was. I had seen in his letters for some time, 
his deep devotion to M r Polk and his administration and meas- 
ures, and a cooling off of feelings towards me, although dis- 
guised, under what he was pleased to call, the frankness of a 
friend. I know, besides, that a very objectionable article, in 
the Southern Riview (which treated me rudely) on the Mem- 
phis convention, 2 was written at his request. It came to his 
knowledge, that I knew the part he had taken in connection 
with it; and to excuse himself, he wrote me a letter endeavour- 
ing to explain away his share, but acknowledging he had re- 
viewed and corrected the article. I saw at once it was time 
to close our correspondence, and accordingly, dropt it on my 
part. He understood me, and made his speech to give me, as 
he hoped, a decisive blow. When I tell you, that I have ever 
treated him kindly, and that nothing whatever has been done 
by me to offend him, you no doubt will wonder what he aims 
at. I do not know, but can conjecture. He is full of emula- 
tion, and has a strong infusion of envy, jealousy and vanity 
in his composition. His loss of popularity in the State, has 
made him look to Polk and his administration for alliance and 
support, and especially, Buchanan. He I believe corresponds 
with him and Polk constantly; and believes, that my position 
is the only impediment to his success. In confirmation of my 
conjecture and his understanding with Buchanan, 1 learned 
he called the opposition to the Tariff a Humbug and De- 
nounced those, who were for reducing it as traitors. 

As to myself, his course gives me no uneasiness. I regret 
that one, with whom I have been so long on friendly terms, 
should prove himself so unworthy of my [remainder missing].

LETTEES OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 697 

To Thomas G. Olemson. c. c. 

Washington 11 th June 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . The most important political news is, 
that it is now almost certain, that the Oregon question will 
be settled. The last steamer, the one which takes this, brought 
an offer for its settlement, which was submitted to our Execu- 
tive, and by it to the Senate. We promptly approved of it by 
a decided vote of more than three to one, and returned it to 
the Executive; so that nothing remains, but to reduce it to 
form and sign and ratify the treaty, all of which I suppose 
will be speedily done. The settlement is based on the 49 th to 
the Strait of Fuca, and along the midle to the Ocean, with the 
navigation of the Oregon river to the Hudson bay Company 
below the 49 th to the ocean, and securing the English settlers 
in their possessions. I do not regard the modifications of any 
importance. 

The Settlement is a great point, just at this critical moment, 
when we have a war on hand, which might have become for- 
midable, if it had been left open. It is to me a great triumph. 
When I arrived here, it was dangerous to wisper 49, and 
I was thought to have taken a hazardous step in asserting, 
that M r Polk had not disgraced the country in offering it. 
Now a treaty is made on it with nearly the unanimous voice 
of the Country. I would have had an equal triumph on the 
Mexican question, now the Oregon is settled, had an oppor- 
tunity been afforded to discuss it. As it is, I have been forced 
to take a stand, which for the time has weakened me with 
mere partisans, but strengthened me with the patriotick and 
reflecting. I shall wait patiently for a fair opportunity of 
presenting my views fully in relation to it, and have no fear 
of regaining more than has been temporarily lost. The war 
has opened with brilliant victories on our side and I trust, 
may soon be brought to a close. I give it a quiet, but decided 
support, as much as I regret the occurrence. 

I have just finished the rough draft of a report on the navi- 
gation of the Miss 1 , and hope to present my report on the 
Memphis memorial, of which it forms a part, in 8 or 10 days. 

I write Anna by this opportunity, as well as yourself, and 
you must excuse me, in adding no more.

To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 2 d July 1846 

MY DEAR JAMES, My long delay in answering your last 
has been caused by my engagement on my report on the 
Memphis Memorial. I made it on Friday, and will transmit 
you a copy as soon as it is printed. 1 Ten thousand copies 
were ordered to be printed. It rests on the strictest state 
rights doctrines, and comes, I think, irresistably to the con- 
clusion, that the federal government has the right to improve 
the navigation of the river. It will I hope remove the only 
barrier, that remains between the Union of the South and 
West. I hope it may merit your approbation. 

The settlement of the Oregon question has given great, 
and, I may almost say, universal satisfaction. I[t] was ef- 
fected in the nick of time. It is now known that had the 
English proposition been delayed 5 days, until the news of 
our decleration of War against Mexico had arrived, the Set- 
tlement would not have be'en made. As it was, there was a 
division in the British Cabinet on the subject of the offer. 
How great the folly to endanger the Oregon settlement by 
the rash, thoughtless and unwarranted movement of our 
troops to the Del Norte! Your views in reference to that, 
and Slidell's conduct are perfectly correct. Much effort has 
been made to misrepresent my course in reference to the 
Mexican war, in order to render it unpopular; but, as far as 
I can learn, without much success. If I have lost anything 
with the thoughtless, I have been more than compensated by 
the increased hold I have obtained on the reflecting and patri- 
otick. 

The course of Co 1 Pickens towards me, on the occasion, has 
surprised every one here but myself. To me it was not unex- 
pected. I could not but see by his correspondence during 
the early part of the session, that his affinity for M r . Polk 
and M r . Buchanan was greater than his attachment for me; 
and that as it increased, his attachment w T as gradually turning 
into hostility. A fact finally came to my knowledge, which 
left no doubt of his unfriendly feelings, and that it existed, 
while he was yet corresponding with me, as a friend. The 

iSee Works, V. 246-310. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 699 

fact I allude to is, that a very unfriendly article in the South- 
ern Review was written by the Editor at his request, and that 
he furnished a speech of his on internal improvements, from 
which to draw the materials, in part, to prepare the Article. 
It came to his knowledge, that 1 knew the fact; and he wrote 
me an explanatory letter, which made it worse. In it, he 
acknowledged that the Article had passed under his revission, 
but claimed merit, that he had obliterated some passages more 
objectionable than any retained. I, of course, could not 
answer such a communication and do justice to my self, with- 
out widening the breach between us. He saw by my silence 
how I regarded it; and seized the occasion at Edgefield to give 
me, as he supposed, a deadly blow. It has recoiled. 

I deeply regret his course any way. I regret it, that the 
son and son in law of my two best friends Co 1 Pickens and 
Co 1 Simpkins, and one with whom I am related and have been 
for many years on friendly terms, should put himself in a 
hostile attitude to me, without receiving the least offense or 
injury from me. I am utterly at a loss to conjecture the 
cause, unless it is, that he seeks the alliance of Tennessee and 
Pensyl a as the means of gratifying his badly regulated ambi- 
tion; just as Preston and Thompson sought that of M r . Clay. 
They came to the conclusion, that the path of duty to the 
South and the Country was one that led neither to honor, nor 
emoluments; and, I fear, he has come to the same. 

I have no fear, that his rude assault will hurt me; but I in- 
tend, on some proper occasion, to place my course on the 
question he has seized on, in its proper light; as I trust I have 
by my report, my course in reference to the navigation of the 
Mississippi. 

I thought it due to our relation to give this statement, as 
painful as I know the narrative must be to you. 

I would be glad to hear from you. We shall not adjourn 
before the 5 th Aug*. ; so that your letter would reach me here, 
should you write promptly. 

How does Willey come on ? I will write him in a day or 
two. Your sister and Cornelia are well, and join their love to 
you and Willej^. It is probable that we shall take the White 
sulfer Springs in Virginia on our way home.

Private. Washington 2 d July 1846. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter came too late to meet the object 
of your wishes. The appointments of Generals are all made. 
But I apprehend, had it come in time, it would have been of 
no avail. The spoils principles are in the ascendency, and 
there is little chance even in War, that any office would be 
bestowed, except for partisan services. Seeing this and pre- 
scribing for myself an independent course, I have ceased to 
apply for office for my friends. 

There has indeed been a [strange?] change of political 
relations in your state, which has placed you and your old 
associates in a false position. Indeed the old political organ- 
ization is worn out, and the time has come, when there ought 
to be a recast of parties better suited to the exigencies of the 
times. We want a real honest conservative party based on 
broad constitutional grounds, and looking to the permanent 
prosperity of the country. As things now are, the spoils 
doctrines are in the ascendency in both of the old parties, 
and rapidly working the corruption of the people and the 
down fall of our free popular institutions. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 11 th July 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, I have little to add since my last. The most 
important occurrence is the passage of the Tariff bill through 
the House, nearly as reported by the Committee. Its fate in 
the Senate is doubtful; but I think it will pass. The protec- 
tionists have, indeed, little to gain by delay. It is clear from 
the vote of the House, that the days of protection is num- 
bered. If its advocates are wise, they will agree to the best 
terms they can now get. The longer the adjustment is post- 
poned the worse for them. 

The South and the West have never been so strongly united 
before; not only in reference to the Tariff, but the publick 
bonds, the warehousing policy; and all other questions save

Oregon, which now that it is settled, will soon disappear. To 
this desirable result, my report on the Memorial of the Mem- 
phis Convention has greatly contributed. The improvement 
of the navigation of the Mississippi was the great barrier, 
which kept them assunder and threw the West into the arms 
of the east. I hope I have forever removed it, by showing 
that the power is clearly embraced by that of regulating com- 
merce among the states. As far as 1 can learn the conclusion 
to which I have come will be sustained by both sections. I 
send you a couple of copies. 

With the exception of the Mexican war, the course of 
events thus far this session has been more in conformity to 
rny views, than what they have been for many years. I fear 
the war will not come to a speedy termination; and that it 
will prove very expensive. Nothing could have been more 
easy than to avoid it; while, I fear, few things would prove 
so difficult, to terminate. I am waiting for a suitable oppor- 
tunity to state my opinion, as to the course, which ought to 
have been pursued in reference to Mexico. . . . 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 29 th July 1846 

MY DEAR JAMES, The Union I send you will give a full 
account of the proceedings of yesterday, and the passage of 
the bill to reduce [the] Tariff. The excitement was intense 
all day. The Amendment will send the bill back to the house 
for concurrence, which makes its fate still doubtful. New 
York and the Wright's wing generally are at heart opposed 
to it, but 1 think dare not defeat it. 

The Whigs will make violent efforts to produce a reaction. 
They yield their hold on us with deep growles. 

If we [were] clear of the Mexican war, the prospect would 
be fair. I greatly fear it will give much trouble and replunge 
the country in a large debt. 

1 hope to get a provision inserted in a bill reported by M r 
Evans to exempt all roads now authorised by law from the 
Duty on rail road iron. It would do much to complete our 
Southern roads, and to Unite the South and West.

Washington 30 th July 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, The Steamer, which takes this, brought me 
yours of the 27 th June, but without the letter, which you 
state Anna had written to me. It was either not sent by 
accident, or has miscarried. 

Nothing has yet been done with the diplomatick bill; nor 
do I think anything will be done this session. I hope some- 
thing may be at the next session. This has been too much 
engrossed with deeply exciting subjects, to permit much at- 
tention to be bestowed on those of a less exciting nature. 
We have just passed on a measure, which caused veiy deep 
excitement; 1 refer to the bill for reducing the duties, 1 which, 
I trust, is but the first step to a strictly revenue bill. The 
whigs are already rallying for its repeal. The country will 
be deeply excited at the next election. I do not fear the re- 
sult. It will give an opportunity for full discussion before 
the people and cause the true character of the protective 
system to be better understood by the community. Our only 
drawback is the Mexican war. Its expense will be enormous; 
and I fear, like the Seminole war, will afford pretex to re- 
new high protective duties. No doubt the war will have its 
good, as well as its evil. It will afford an opportunity for 
the display of patriotism and valour; but it will at the same 
time disclose our financial weakness; involve us in a heavy 
debt; give a strong central tendency to our system; prevent

reform and greatly strengthen the Spoils principle. Without 
it, the prospect would be bright for a thorough reform, but 
as it is, I can see but little prospect of reform. 

The Subtreasury is now before the Senate and will doubt- 
less pass. Indeed, it is not a little remarkable, that all the 
great measures I have advocated are in a fair way of being 
consummated, even to that, in reference to the publick lands. 
And what adds to it, is that those, who are cooperating in 
consummating them, are far from being actuated by views 
friendly to me. 

We have rumours of change in the State Department. It 
is said that M r Buchannan will be nominated to fill the vacancy 
on the supreme bench in the course of the week. I think it 
not improbable. The only doubt is, that he cannot pass the 
Senate. The impression is, that the 54 forties will unite and 
reject him; but I doubt it now, that the bill for reducing the 
duties has passed. The Whigs will be inclined to court him, 
and get [h]is cooperation in Pennsylvania in order to effect a 
repeal. Should he be appointed, I am inclined to think M r 
M c Lane, our minister in London, will be selected to take 
his place, which 1 would regard as a very great improve- 
ment.

MY DEAR JAMES, I expect to leave tomorrow morning to 
join your Sister and Cornelia at the White Sulphur Springs 
on my way home. I write in the midest of confusion and 
haste and you must excuse the brevity of my letter. 

I am glad you so highly approve of my report. It has 
been well received almost without exception. It never could 
have been better timed. The veto of the Harbour bill L gives 
it new interest and importance. The President, in his unwill- 
ingness to take my ground, placed his veto on grounds wholly 
indefensible. Nothing now is left for all interested but to 
rally on mine. They may stand there, without the fear of a 
veto.

With the exception of the Mexican question, the ev r ents of 
the session are eminently favourable to us. Already have the 
administration, and the country become heartily tired of the 
war, and are as anxious now to get out of it, as they were to 
get into it. My course in reference to it standfs] vindicated 
in the opinion of all, without my uttering one word in my 
defense.

Washington 8 th August 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, I leave here in the morning tomorrow for 
the White Sulphur Springs where M rs Calhoun and Cornelia 
are waiting me to join them; and write in all the haste and 
confusion incident to the adjournment of so long a session, so 
that you must excuse the brevity of this communication. . . . 
The course of events during the Session, with the exception 
of the Mexican war, has been as favourable to us, as we could 
possibly expect. Indeed, our measures have been forced on 
the administration and the party, as the only expedient by 
which they could save themselves, very much, for the most 
part, against the inclination of the former and a large portion 
of the latter. If I do not mistake our ascendency will be still 
more complete at the next Session. The administration and 
the country are already tired of the Mexican war; and are in 
as great haste to get out of it, as they were to get into it. My 
course, in reference to it, stands vindicated in the opinion of 
all, without my saying one word in my own defence. Nor 
will my triumph be less certain and decisive in reference to 
my Memphis Report. The President's veto of the harbour 
bill will ensure its complete success. His veto message is a 
poor document. He would not take my ground, and has been 
forced on that, which is wholly indefensible, and has left 
nothing on which all the interests involved can rally, but on 
the ground taken in the report. On that they can safely 
stand, without fear of the veto. 

Co 1 Pickens, with M rs Pickens, Miss Susan, Miss Jeter and 
Miss Harris of Edgefield, passed through here a few days since 
on a tour to the North'. Contrary to my expectation, he called

return his visit the next day, and declined doing so until he 
explained his course, which was made known to him through 
several of my friends, who called on me and conversed with 
me on the Subject. He disavowed the charges made in the 
papers, and on the authority of many present at the meetings, 
and authorised M r M c Duffie and others to make known his 
disavowal to me, which was accordingly done. On the strength 
of it, I returned his call. I found him alone, with the excep- 
tion of M r Holmes, our member from Charleston. He re- 
peated the disavowal in his presence in Strong language. 1 
It leaves an ugly question to be settled between him and others 
on whose authority the charges were made. 

I am glad to hear, that you are all so well, and that the 
children are growing and improving so much. Kiss them for 
their grandfather, and tell them I love them. My love to 
Anna.

MY DEAR SIR, It is my intention to take the route by Tala- 
dcga, when 1 next visit Alabama, should I go by private con- 
veyance. It is a portion of the state, which I desire to see. 
It adds much to the inducement to take it, that it would 
enable me to meet again an old friend, for whom I entertain 
so sincere a regard, and to spend a day with him and his fam- 
ily. But it is quite uncertain, when I shall make my next 
visit. It will be out of my power to do so this fall. 

I send you a copy of my Memphis report, 3 and hope the 
view I have taken of the important subjects, of which it 
treats, will meet your approval. I feel assured, that on none 
other can they ever be permanently settled, and that they 
must exercise a powerful disturbing influence over the regular 
action of the government until they are settled. 

I am not surprised, that some of my warm political friends

should still entertain doubt. I have lived too long not to know 
how reluctantly the clearest proposition is admitted against 
preconceived opinions. But I have great faith in the final 
triumph of truth, and never have I been more certain of its 
triumph, than in this case. I regard the Report, as one of 
the most effective State Rights papers, I ever put forth, and 
that too on a portion of the Federal constitution heretofore 
the least understood. It draws a broad line between internal 
and external improvements; and restricts the Federal govern- 
ment more rigidly to those belonging to the external relations 
of the states, than any other view ever taken. Indeed, I have 
heard no objection to the argument, as it relates to the im- 
provement of the Navigation of the Mississippi. The only 
one I have . 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Fort Hill 15 th Sep r 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . The course you indicate as proper to 
be taken in reference to Mexico, however wise, is one, which 
I cannot hope that the Administration would be induced to 
adopt. Indeed they have taken up such wild conceptions in 
reference to the proper policy to be pursued in relation to 
our foreign relations, that I have ceased to make any attempt, 
directly or indirectly, to influence them. 

I fear with you that the interference of France and England 
will finally take place. Thus far, England has acted with the 
utmost delicacy and propriety, but 1 cannot think, that she 
and France will stand by quietly, and see Mexico stript of a 
large portion of her territory without interfering. The most, 
which can be hoped is, that they will assent to a considerable 
cession on the part of Mexico, on condition of a joint guaranty 
of the residue, to which we, as well as they, must be parties; 
but it is hardly to be expected that our Government will agree 
to such an arrangement. 

We had a rough, but interesting journey from the White 
Sulphur Springs home. We returned by the way of Wythe- 
ville and Abingdon to the Warm Springs in North Carolina. 
At Wytheville, I remained two days to visit the ancient resi

dence of our family on Reed Creek, 1 a few miles from that 
place. They made a noble location of several miles up and 
down the creek including 3000 acres of fertile low grounds 
and a large body of rich high lands. I saw no liner, or more 
beautiful country any where on my route. It is now in the 
possession of wealthy and respectible families, connected with 
us through the Montgomeries, who returned to the country 
after the termination of the old French war. They pointed 
out to me the place where my father resided, and also your 
grandfather and the rest of the brothers. We were enter- 
tained with unbounded Kindnes and hospitality. . . .

Fort Hill 20 th Sep r 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, On my return home a few days since, I found 
Anna's letter of July, and since then, I have received yours of 
the 11 th August. 

Your remarks in reference to my Memphis Report shows, 
that you rightly appreciate the state of parties with us, and 
its probable effects, in bringing about a reorganization of 
parties. It is working its way slowly, and what is remarkable 
and not a little significant, with little opposition from any 
quarter. There are many, who are cautious about endorsing 
it, but a still greater number, who appear to be still more, 
about opposing it. There is no danger, as you seem to fear, 
that it will quietly slide out of veiw, if not discussed and agi- 
tated at once. Folk's veto of the Harbour bill, and especially 
the indefinite and unsatisfactory grounds on which he placed 
it, will prevent that. As it stands, the whole subject of Light 
Houses, buoys, Beacons, and the improvement of the naviga- 
tion of the Mississippi, as well as Harbours must remain un- 
acted on, unless there can be a general rally of the parties 
sufficiently strong to force him to yield, or to overule his veto. 
I regard this state of things very favourable to bring about a 
rally on the report, by causing a more full and careful exami- 
nation of the subject, than it has ever heretofore received by 
the publick; especially, if the unfortunate Mexican war, should 
in the mean time be brought to a close. . . ;

MY DEAR SIR, ... I agree with you, that our foreign 
appointments, for the most part, are bad. They are made, 
indeed, much more with the view of obtaining influence at 
home than a regard to the competency of the appointees to 
discharge the duties of the office conferred on them. It is a 
part of the spoils principle, and can only be removed by put- 
ting it down. . . .

MY DEAR SIR, I should be happy to see M r Perrin, and if 
you should see him I would be glad you would say so to him. 
I would be glad to converse with him on several subjects. 
He is a very sensible, worthy man, and every way worthy of 
confidence. 

I have just finished the preperation of a paper giving my 
views on the subject of changing the mode of appointing the 
electors, in complyance with the request of several of the 
members elect of this District. 1 It is a subject of great 
importance, touching the very vitals of our state constitution. 
I have gone pretty fully into the subject. I hope what I have 
said will forever put down the scheme of adopting a general 
ticket in our state. . I declined coming out before the election, 
to avoid the imputation of improper interference. By com- 
ing out after, I shall secure a more favourable hearing. My 
communication, I suppose, will appear in the Messenger next 
week, or the week after. 

I am of the impression, I wrote you before I left Washing- 
ton and stated the fact of exchanges of visit between Col 
Pickens and myself, the circumstances attending it and my 
state of feelings in connection with it. I could not ask, or 
expect him to go further, as far as I was concerned, in mak- 
ing explanations. It was impossible for me to return his 
visit until he made explanation. This he did by a full and 
explicit denial, that he referred to me, in what he said. He

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOTTN. 709 

made it to M r M c Duffie. On his report of the fact to me, I 
returned his visit, without hesitation. Holmes was there, 
when I stept in, and he took the occasion to repeat, in his 
presence, his disavowal fully and explicitly. All J regret, in 
reference to the subject is, that he should permit the report 
to circulate so widely and so long without a publick denial. 1 
think he owed it to himself and the occasion to make it. It 
would have placed the whole affair on a better footing before 
the world. It, however, much more concerns himself, than 
it does me. 

I have never expressed any dissatisfaction in reference to 
his explanation. My acceptance of it is proof, that I regard 
it satisfactory as far as I am personally concerned. Indeed, I 
have hardly ever alluded to it, and when I have, it has been 
in the most delicate way. The whole affair has been the 
source of deep regret and pain to me, unmixed with ill will 
or unkind feelings, much less resentment. I have felt far 
more deeply for the wound he has inflicted on himself, than 
any he has on me; and if I could, I would heal it, and restore 
him to his former position in the state; but I fear that is 
impossible; the more so, in consequence of the way he has 
left it before the publick, by his silence. . . . 



To Lewis S. Cory ell. 1 

Fort Hill 7 th Nov. 1846. 

MY DEAK SIR, I infer from your letter just received, as well 
as from information derived from other sources, that we are 
on the eve of a great political struggle. 

I fear nothing from the Tariff. That, instead of a source 
of weakness, will prove about the only prop to the Demo- 
cratick party. The great danger is to be traced to the course 
of the Administration in reference to the Oregon and Mexican 
questions, and the use they have made of their patronage. 
They have by these distracted and divided and disheartened 
and alienated the party to an extent unknown heretofore. If 
the Whigs were in a condition to avail themselves of the

advantage, our defeat would be inevitable; but they, fortu- 
nately , are in a condition not much better. Distraction per- 
vades their ranks. Their alliance with abolitionism, antirent- 
ism and all the other isms has left them in a state of almost 
complete decomposition. It will be difficult for the Northern 
portion and the Southern to act together, tainted as the former 
is so deeply by abolitionism. Indeed, I regret to see that 
many of the democrats in the North are not by any means free 
from the taint. Wilmot's proposition 1 will prove an apple of 
discord, that will do much to divide the party. 

Should Mr. Wright 2 be defeated, as you think, it will have 
a powerful influence over coming events. To the Whigs it 
would give great encouragement, while it would prostrate 
entirely the old hunker portion of the Democratick party, 
who, in my opinion, are responsible for all the disasters, 
which have befallen the party. The next session will be one 
of development, and deep and exciting interest. Before it 
ends, we shall see the direction, which the many and powerful 
causes now in operation, will take. I feel that my position is 
one of great strength and influence, and I shall use it for the 
best good of the country and its institutions. 

I was not ignorant that the person to whom you refer, had 
strong political affinities in a certain direction, growing out 
of the part he took at the last presidential election.

your two articles. They do credit to your patriotism. It 
requires all the energy of men like you at the North and 
North West to save the Union from the torch of the fanaticks 
and^ the demagogues who are idly attempting to use them for 
their own purpose. 

The evil is with you, and must be remedied there by the 
wise and good in your portion of the Union, combining to

resist it. The South is looking on, not without interest (for 
she is deeply devoted on the high principles of patriotism to 
the Union) but calmly and without dread for herself. She 
stands on her rights, and feels that she can defend them. 
She has made up her mind, both as to her rights, morally and 
politically, and her capacity to defend them, and has ceased 
in a great measure, to discuss the question, or publishing 
anything in relation to the subject, except to note the progress 
of the evil among yourselves. In this state of mind, it is dif- 
ficult to get any of our papers to publish anything from your 
papers on the subject, except to that extent; not but we 
highly appreciate the character and efforts of men like your- 
self, who we know constitute a large portion of the intelli- 
gence of the North, but because our mind is made up to meet 
whatever alternative ma}^ be forced on us. We believe the 
battle is to be fought with you; and the time is come, when 
the men of the North must make up their mind to rally for, 
or against abolitionism. It has been forced into politics with 
you, and it must now be put down politically, or triumph 
with you, with all the inevitable consequences that will fol- 
low, disunion among others. 

In this state of feeling, I can give no assurance that any 
of our Journals will publish at this time the two articles; and 
let me add with frankness, especially the one, which so 
strongly advocates a measure, to which we of this state are 
almost unanimously opposed. 

I have written you thus candidly and frankly because I 
think the time has arrived when the two parties of the Union 
should fully and truly understand one another, on the impor- 
tant question involved. It is proper for the North to know, 
that we have made up our mind to defend our rights, and if 
she has made up her mind to assail them, on her be the 
consequences.

MY DEAR ANNA, You evince good judgement, in prefenng 
a new and growing country to an old, and decaying, or even 
a stationary one. With all the inconvenience of the former, 



712 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

there is something so heartsome in the yearly growth and 
improvement of a new country, which more than compensates 
for it. Indeed, so strongly do I feel the charms of a growing 
and improving country, that I would be much disposed to 
place mvself on the very verge of the advancing population 
and growth of our country, were I to follow my inclination. 
There is, however, one drawback to a reflecting mind, that 
the growth and improvement, which cause the pleasure, are 
but the precursors to the evils which afflict an old and highly 
improved and civilized country. But while we prefer our 
own country, we must not under value Europe. She has done 
great things and is destined to advance far beyond the point 
of improvement and civilization, she has yet attain[ed]. The 
great progress made in the last hundred years in subjecting 
matter to the control of mind, especially in facilitating the 
means of intercourse, has made Europe a new country. It 
has roused up her energies; and greatly increased her capacity 
to add to her population and improvements. The danger is, 
that it may lead to political changes long before she is pre- 
pared to make them available to her prosperity and happiness; 
and thereby throw her back, instead of accellerating her prog- 
ress. If the present institutions of Europe and this country, 
could be preserved for one century more, without convulsion 
or revolution, it would be difficult to form a conception of the 
progress, which they, and, I may add, the whole globe would 
make [in] improvements, civilization, and increase of pop- 
ulation. 

So you see, my dear daughter, 1 am inclined to look on the 
present state of things favourably, in reference to Europe and 
to our country, and to be highly conservative in reference to 
both. What I dread is, that progress in political science, 
falls far short of progress in that, which relates to matter, 
and which may lead to convulsions and revolutions, that may 
retard, or even arrest the former. 

I am rejoiced to hear, that you are all in such good health, 
and that the dear children are growing and improving so much. 
I long to see them, as well as yourself and M r Clemson; and 
hope that circumstances will justify your early return. Should 
cotton rise, to a good remunerating price, I do not think M r 
Clemson would lose even in a pecuniary point of view by it; 
especially, if the projected railroad should be extended from

Aiken to Greenville, or Pickensville, as is not improbable. 
Its extension is now the subject of a good deal [of] discussion. 
Two routes are spoken of; one from Columbia to Greenville 
by the Way of Newberiy Court House, and the other from 
Aiken by the maine ridge to Pickensville. ' Should the latter 
be selected, the road would pass about 6 miles from the Cane 
Brake. 

As to politicks, either general, or in reference to myself, 
individually, I have but little to add to what you will see in 
the papers. The Whigs have gained in the late elections 
greatly on the Democrats. The cause is to be traced to the 
great errors of the Administration; its course in reference to 
Oregon; the Mexican war, and its neglect and even proscrip- 
tion in many instances of those, who supported M r Polk, in 
order to conciliate those who opposed him. The prospect is, 
that the party will be defeated at the next election for Presi- 
dent, unless, as my friends think, they should rally on me. 
Whether the prospect of defeat will bring the party to their 
sense and to a return to their old principles, remains to be seen. 
In case it should, they may rally on me. Personally I feel 
little, or no interest. I agree with you, 1 have nothing to gain 
by any office, which can be bestowed [by] the people or the 
government. I trust what little reputation I have gained 
rests on a more solid foundation, than any which can be con- 
ferred by holding any office, even the highest. 

John has just returned from Eugenia's wedding. She is 
now M rs Parker. He is the son of M 1 ' 8 Parker, who resided 
near the old place; a physician by profession, and is said to 
be a very worthy man. John was one of his attendants, and 
says that they had a very large and gay wedding party. 
Willie recovers slowly. ... I enclose a letter from him. All 
the rest are well and join their love to you, M r Clemson and 
the children.

of the 30 th Nov r , addressed to Pendleton.

From what I hear, I do not doubt, but your Tennessee cor- 
respondent is correct in his statement. It seems certain that 
Col Benton is to be the Organ of the Administration in the 
Senate, which, as Wright and he are bosom friends, would 
seem to indicate pretty certainly, that the latter is designed to 
be the Successor, should Polk despair of running with success. 
Should such be the arrangement, the other portions of your 
correspondents statement, that the press has already been sub- 
sidized and that the Post Master General 1 is in the movement, 
in all probability is true. . . . 

As to the state of parties here, I infer from all I can learn, 
that both parties are in a state of great distraction and disor- 
ganization. What will grow out of it, would be difficult to 
conjecture. I can see no immediate end of the Mexican War. 
It seems certain, that an attack is contemplated on Vera Cruz 
both by sea and land; but mainly by the latter. Great reli- 
ance seems to be placed on the success of the attack bringing 
Mexico to terms. I doubt it; while it seems certain that a 
failure would tend greatly to prolong the war. 1 wish we 
could be fairly and honorably extricated from it. Its termi- 
nation would be followed by great prosperity under the re- 
duction of duties, while its long continuance would be followed 
by many evil consequences, and among them the elevation of 
the Whigs to power and the restoration of a protective Tariff.

they continue to grow and improve so finely. After making

I also enclose a letter from your Mother, which will give 
you all the domestick and local news, I presume, of Pendleton 
and its vicinity. 

Patrick is now here, and looking remarkably well. He has 
been complemented] by being elected the Col n . of a Regiment 
of volunteers in the city of N. York, unanimously and without 
solicitation. He is here in order to have it called into service, 
and be permitted to command it, without losing his commis- 
sion in the line. Objections have been made by the depart- 
ment, but he hopes to overcome them. However opposed to 
the declaration of war, I cannot object to his going, and greatly 
prefer his going at the head of the Regiment, than as a sub- 
altern in the line. He would be the youngest man with a 
Col n ' s . commission, in Service. 1 

James continues to give good indications. He seems to be 
much attached to his studies and to be pleased with the insti- 
tution. Co 1 and M rs Preston have been very polite to him. 
I begin to have much hope of him. 

Andrew and family were well, when I last heard from them. 
He has there five boys. He is very busy in preparing for a 
large crop to make up for the shortness of the present. 

My own health is good, except, which is usual with me 
here, bad colds. I am very comfortably quartered at Hills, 
and have M r Burt and Martha in the joining room. The win- 
ter thus far has been pleasant. 

Congress, as yet, has done nothing; but will, I suppose, 
begin in earnest after the 1 st Jan y . The Mexican war is 
the great and absorbing question. Many now begin to see, 
that it is like to prove a very troublesome and embarrassing 
affair, to say no more; and to think, that I was right in op- 
posing it. There is no seeing when or how it is to be ended. 
It is like to turn out, as the war in Algeria has a war between 
races and creeds, which can only end in complete subjection 
of the weaker power a thing not easily effected in either 
case. We have to boot the Slave question mingled up with 
it. The present appearance is, that the Scheme of the North 
is, that the South shall do all the fighting and pay all the

expense, and they to have all the conquered territory. It is 
understood, that the North is united on Wilmot's proposition 
to a man, and intend to act on it when the country is con- 
quered. What is to come of all this, time only can disclose. 
The present indication is, that the South will be united in 
opposition to the Scheme. If they regard their safety they 
must defeat it, even should the union be rent assunder. 

As to myself, I am waiting for developements before I take 
my stand. My inaction and silence make position more im- 
posing. When the time comes to act, I shall do what duty 
requires be the consequences what they may. I desire above 
all things to save the whole; but if that cannot be, to save the 
portion where Providence has cast my lot, at all events. We 
never had a darker, or more uncertain future before us; and 
all from the rash step of rushing into war, when it could have 
been easily avoided, and when, if avoided, we had so clear a 
prospect before us. The Oregon question was as good as 
settled, and the settlement of that, would have left little diffi- 
culty in settling the Mexican, which would have given a long 
and almost certain prospect of peace and prosperity. 

Say to M r Clemson, that I have no farther intelligence 
about his place, since I passed by, and that M r Harris has 
made another enquiry as to whether he would sell, through 
his father in law. I forwarded his letter to his overseer as 
soon as received. 

My love to him. Kiss the dear Children for their Grand- 
father, and tell them I wish to see them much.

Washington 30 th Jan y 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . Nothing stands between the country 
and unboundfed] prosperity in all branches of its industry, 
but the unfortunate Mexican war. All now acknowledge its 
folly, and desire most heartily to get out of it as soon as pos- 
sible; but it is hard to do that, without the lead and coopera- 
tion of the Administration. If they had sufficient sense and 
nerve, it could be easily accomplished. I have pointed out 
the way, and offered my best efforts to aid in conversation; 
but they hesitate; and will I fear, untill plunged into inextri- 
cable difficulties. 

I have thus far been silent and inactive, in hope some op- 
portunity would offer to enable me to act with effect. None 
has yet offered, and I fear none will. If none should, I will 
take the tirst good occassion to express my opinion fully, as 
to the course, which ought to be pursued. 

My friends think I never stood higher, or stronger than I 
now do. Time has justified the wisdom of my course, in ref- 
erence to the Mexican war; and the caucus machinery, which 
has ever been opposed to me, is evidently giving away. The 
election of Hunter and Mason to the Senate is proof conclu- 
sive, that it is rapidly on the decline in Virginia. 1 I hold it to 
be now certain that tfrere will be no more Baltimore nomina- 
tions, or if there should be, the nominee will be assuredly 
defeated. 

The Administration has been endeavouring to build up, 
through Benton, the old Van Buren party, but all in vain. 
They will probably next try the Cass party, but, I think, 
with as little hope of success. We hold the balance, and it 
is felt. 

My health, with the usual exception of cold and cough, 
during the winter here, has been pretty good fully as much 
so. as I could expect with the little exer[cise] I take, and the 
course of living in such a place as this. 

My love to Anna. Kiss the dear children for their Grand- 
father, and tell them how much I want to see them.

latter to fill a vacancy, the former for the term 1847-1853.

To Thomas G. Glemsvn-. c. c. 

Washington 17 th Feb 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, ... I enclose two copies of my speech 
on the Mexican war. 1 It has been well received; and has made 
a deep impression. The best proof of the depth and strength of 
the impression is the fierce war it has drawn down on me from 
the Administration through its organ here. Those in power 
see that they have involved themselves and the country in a 
war fraught with the most disasterous consequences, and from 
which it will be difficult to extricate themselves. They begin 
to feel, that their doom is sealed; and hence their bitter and 
malignant attacks under the garb of defending the liberty of 
the press. 

The country is, indeed, in a sad Condition, and the principles 
and doctrines of the Republican party are in a fair way of 
being permanently subverted through the weakness and folly 
of the administration. Should the war continue scarcely the 
vestige of any one of them will be left; free trade will sink 
under an oppressive debt to be paid by the impost; the Sub- 
treasury will end in a more intimate connection of the Gov*. 
with the paper system than ever; economy and retrenchment 
will be lost in the vast and irregular expenditures of the war, 
and the patronage of the Government will be extended beyond 
all former examples. 

I shall meet the assaults on me with perfect composure and 
with every confidence of rising above them in the end. The 
war cannot be continued; and a defensive position must be 
ultimately assumed. 

You must excuse a short letter. The pressure of my 
engagements is great. I have scarcely a spare moment. 

My love to Anna; and kiss the children for their grand- 
father.

ever held here. I find perfect unanimity here, including- 
Whigs and democrats. I never have been received even here 
with greater unanimity and enthusiasm than ever. I got your 
letter and prospectus. I placed the later in the hands of sev- 
eral intelligent friends. It met their entire approbation. 

I find the impression here is, that $25,000 would be neces- 
sary to place a daily paper at Washington on a solid founda- 
tion. I have had a full conversation with several capitalists, 
who are firmly attached to the cause, in order to ascertain 
what portion of it can be raised here. They required time to 
consider and decide. They are to inform me as soon as their 
decision is made, when, if it should be favorable, I will write 
to leading friends in other states. I think the indications here 
favorable but it will take time to make arrangements. The 
fate of the Constitutionalist has cast a damp. Ten thousand 
dollars was raised here to support it. The whole has been lost 
without doing any good. 

The selection of the editor, you know, must depend on the 
leading contributors. I suggested your name, as if sounding; 
and I am bound in candour to say, there was no reponse. 
Nothing was said in disparagement of you, but I was forced 
to infer that it did not meet with approbation. As to myself, 
I am inclined to think that the course your prospectus indi- 
cates, to restore the old organ and its editor, under its proper 
name, would be a very successful move; perhaps the most suc- 
cessful, which could be made; but it is, I fear, too bold to ob- 
tain the assent of the timid, who constitute so large a portion 
of any party. I would individually be glad; nay rejoice to 
see you restored to your old position. I have confidence in 
your friendship, and am grateful for your support in passing 
through some of the eventful periods of my life; but I feel 
confident you will see that the relation I bear to you of a pri- 
vate character and the position I occupy in the party put it 
out of my power to speak in anything like a tone of authority 
on the subject. 

I have written you in the sperit you. requested, but it is 
proper to add that I do not consider that there is anything yet 
settled in reference to the paper or its editors, and that I would 
be most gratified to see your great experience and talents asso- 
ciated in conducting it, should it be established. 



720 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

As to myself, I look wholly to the cause and would really 
rejoice to see some one take the lead and receive the appro- 
priate honors of leadership instead of myself. I am most anx- 
ious to retire to the quiet of private life, after my long and 
laborious publick service; but it seems to me the more I do, 
the more I am compelled to do, and the farther I recede from 
retirement. 

I shall write you again, when I hear from my friends from 
Charleston about the paper.

On my return, I met M rs Calhoun in Charleston waiting my 
arrival. My reception by the city authorities and the citizens 
generally was warm, and even enthusiastick never more so. 
I remained four days, and addressed a crowded meeting in 
the Theater the evening preceeding my leaving. It was lit- 
erally crowded, and hundreds had to retire from the impossi- 
bility of getting in. I was unfortunately labouring under a 
severe cold, accompanied by hoarseness; but I succeeded in 
making myself heard, in a short address of about 30 or 40 
minutes. 1 I dwelt wholly on the slave question, its danger 
and our means for resisting it. The time is come, when it 
must be brought to a final decision. The next Session will 
indicate what that will be. From present appearance it will 
be one of the most important sessions since the commencement 
of the Government. . . .

To James Edward Calhoun. 



Fort Hill 20 th March 1847 * 

MY DEAR SIR, I returned home on Tuesday last with your 
sister, who met me at Charleston, and had the pleasure of 
finding all well, except old Peggy, who has been quite danger- 
ously ill, and my place in as good a condition, as I could 
expect, in all respects. 

I received your last letter at a period of the session, when 
I was so much engaged, that I had not time to answer it. 
The sittings of the Senate were exceedingly laborious towards 
the end of the session, and I was forced to take a very active 
and prominent part. 

The grievance of which you speak, in reference to the pro- 
posed substitution of a horse mail from Abbeville to the 
Double wells on the Georgia rail road, admits of no remedy, 
but the repeal of the act of Congress passed three years since, 
which makes it the duty of the Post Master General to have 
the mail carried in the cheapest manner, without reference to 
the mode of conveyance. 2 It was to go into operation with 
the respective lettings in the several portions of the Union, 
arid this is our turn, it will be put into operation on all our 
routes, and among others to the present stage line from Pendle- 
ton to Hamburgh. The act was passed by the North, to carry 
out the scheme of reducing the postage so low, as to charge 
a large annual burthen on the revenue from the imposts, and 
that the income of the Dept. might not be reduced so greatty, 
as to cause reaction, the plan was adopted to cheapen the 
transportation of the mail by breaking up the mail stage ac- 
comodations, in which it had but little interest, comparatively. 
There is I think no hope of its repeal, so that we must grin 
and bear it, as well as we can. The only remedy will be for 
some one to bid for the line sufficiently low to take it, and 
establish a hack. It is the way we propose to do Athens, 
which must hereafter be our route to Augusta, Hamburgh 
and Charleston. 



1 This is perhaps the most appropriate point at which to mention that a letter of Cal- 
houn to C. N. Webb, editor of the Roanoke Republican, dated March'20, 1847, printed in 
Niles's Register, LXXII, 210, was omitted from the list on p. 45, supra. The omission 
was not discovered till the proofs of that page had passed.

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 28 th March 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, I see by the contents of your letter, that you 
have misunderstood me on a point, where 1 had supposed my 
meaning was very obvious. By private relations, I had no 
allusion to our personal relations, either of confidence, or 
friendship. It would, indeed, be absurd to make either of 
them a cause of delicacy in giving a preference to you. I 
alluded to our family connections through the tie of marriage. 
Nor do you seem to understand, what I intended by the 
expression of my position to the party, who support me. It 
is not that of a leader aspiring to the presidency, but that of 
an individual, who, in the discharge of his publick trust, 
looks onty to his duty and only expects their support from 
their concurrence in opinion with him. Occupying that posi- 
tion towards them, as associates and equals, and not as parti- 
sans, or followers, I assume no right to dictate, nor do I admit 
the right on their part to dictate to me. It is the relation of 
independence on both sides; and I feel it to be a matter of 
delicacy, to respect it especially when they stand in the rela- 
tion of contributors to the support of a cause, which I would 
advocate without reference to their support, or opposition. 

Having explained my meaning, I deem it proper to repeat, 
that I neither doubt } 7 our friendship, or capacity. On the 
contrary, I place a high estimate on both. I know of no one, 
who in my opinion, would conduct a paper with more ability, 
or greater fidelity. I go further. As you lost an honorable 
and profitable position by your adherence to the cause, I would 
rejoice to see you again in the same position and in the con- 
duct of a paper of the same name. The triumph would be 
that of truth and justice; and as far as I can contribute to it, 
consistently with a due sense of propriety, and the success of 
the cause, I 'will do so. Further I cannot go. I cheerfully

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 723 

yield my own claims to such consideration, and no friend can 
ask me to go further. I ask no sacrifice of any friend, which 
I would not cheerfully make myself. Indeed, I would much 
rather make the sacrifice, than ask a friend to make it. 

But when the funds are raised, it will, then, be the time to 
consult as to the editorship of the paper. Whether they will 
be or not, I fear is doubtful, from the reason I alluded to in 
my letter. I have not yet heard from my Charleston friends 
with whom I conversed on the subject. A word as to myself. 

You seem to think, that I permit other persons to prejudice 
me against you, and that I have not given you the support 1 
ought. As to the first, you greatly mistake. When I know 
a man, no one can influence my opinion, and what is more, 
very few undertake to do so. I take care to check it at once, 
when attempted, as I know to what unfounded conclusions, 
the jealousy of the mutual friends of a prominent individual 
will lead them. In addition, I am of that temper that I would 
rather be betrayed, than to suspect on light grounds. Besides, 
I feel, that I may be deserted, but cannot be betrayed: having, 
as I always have, had truth for my only guide; and no motive 
for concealment. I entertain not a thought, which I am not 
willing should be known to the world; and have not ever 
written a letter, which I am not willing it should be published. 
It is hard to betray one, who can with truth say as much. 

As to my want of giving you due support, I know not when 
I have had the power of doing so, and a'bstain[ed] from doing 
it, when it could be done with propriety. Indeed I might 
ask when have I ever had the power to wield any portion of 
the patronage of the Government, since the termination of 
M r Monroe's administration! During the short period, I was 
in M r Tyler's administration, he engrossed the whole; and I 
came in under circumstances, which did not permit me to 
take a stand against it. 

The only instance you allude to, is that of 1840, when by 
uniting with the Whigs, I might have made you in connection 
with Gales and Seaton the printers, against Blair and Rives. 1 
1 now think as I did then, that standing opposed to the Whigs 
on all the great questions of the day, as 1 did, that I could

724 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

not without loss of character and confounding my position, 
do other than 1 did; and had hoped that such would be your 
own conclusion, when you came coolly to reflect. I deeply 
regretted to be placed in the position, but thinking as I did, 
and still think, had you been my brother, I would have acted 
as I did. I acted on my own conception, uninfluenced by any 
others. As highly, as I value friendship, and as much dis- 
posed, as I am, to support my friends, I cannot yield my 
conception of what is right, or wrong to either, while I would 
cheerfully make any personal sacrifice for the purpose. Had 
I withheld my support on the occasion, from any motive on 
my part of personal ambition or advancement, I would have 
been inexcusable; but that I suppose, you can hardly think, 
although I [am] forced to infer, that as long as you have 
known me, you have never fully realized how subordinate I 
hold such considerations, when they come into conflict with 
what I believe to be right. Even in early manhood, when I 
felt their impulse far stronger, than I now do, they could 
never over rule my sense of right. I regret, that one, who 
ought to know me, as well as you ought, should under esti- 
mate my character, as I am forced [to] think you do, on such 
a point. 

Let me add in conclusion, that while I think, there is a 
great opening for a truly independent and able paper at 
Washington (never greater in my opinion) and that no one is 
more able to conduct such an one than yourself, I would be 
very sorry to see you undertake editing a paper there, unless 
on calculations founded on the prospect of its ultimate profit. 
But if you can see your way looking to it, clearly, and can 
find the means to start one, even a weekly sheet at first, on 
your own independent hook, avowing your object to be, to 
restore the principles of the party, which brought Gen 1 Jack- 
son into power, but which were defeated by the introduction 
of the spoils principle and the party machinery of the Albany 
Junto, and the treason of M r Ritchie and others like him, and 
assuming the old name of the Telegraph, you would pre- 
occupy the ground, and rally the whole South and a large 
potion of the old party everywhere to your support. The 
prospectus you prepared, would be the proper basis, modified 
to suit the suggestions made. Place it on the high ground of 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 725 

an independent press, holding principle paramount and never 
subordinate. In my opinion, it would stir up the South, and 
hasten its efforts to raise funds to establish on a firm founda- 
tion, a press at Washington. 

You ask me if I read the Union. I do not take it and rarely 
see it. 1 expect him to do his best in the way of abuse. He 
sees, that my overthrow is necessary to save the hunkers.

Fort Hill 9 th April 1847 

DEAR SIR, Regarding you to be one, entertaining strong 
political attachment to me, as you state yourself to be, I 
answer you as a friend. 

If to be devoted to popular institutions; if to believe in the 
principles and policy, which brought the Republican party 
into power under Mr. Jefferson; if to prefer country to party, 
and dare to oppose party, when party deviates from its prin- 
ciples or policy, is to be a Republican, then am I one, and 
ever have been, and never more so than now. I had sup- 
posed, I had given too many and trying proofs of my Repub- 
licanism judged by these tests, to have my Republicanism 
doubted at chis late day. I have often before opposed the 
party when in power, to save both it and the country. I 
have often before been denounced by partisans and party 
papers for doing so; but time has ever, as it will now, prove 
me to be in the right. It has been my fate to oppose the 
party, when in power and full strength, and to come to its 
rescue, when fallen or out of power. It is again in a fail- 
way, 1 apprehend, to lose power, because it has greatly de- 
parted from its original faith, and embraced the principles 
and policy of its opponents to a far greater extent, than is 
supposed, by those, who have not carefully watched the 
course of events. The Republican party would ever triumph, 
and never be in danger, if true to its principles and policy. 
I would say to you, and other political friends, who may 
have given too hasty an ear to the abuse of mere partisans

and party papers who go with party right or wrong, wait and 
see. To time I always appeal against their clamour. 

I enclose you a copy of my address to the citizens of 
Charleston. 1 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 11 th April 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . The spring has been very backward; 
but the weather has been warm and dry since the commence- 
ment of the month, and vegitation has pushed forward with 
great rapidity. The woods begin to assume their summer 
garb, and every thing seems gay and cheerful. This morn- 
ing is a lovely one, of the most agreeable temperature. The 
birds are sending up their joyous notes in every direction. 
We, however, begin to want rain, to bring up our corn and 
cotton, and give vigour to the growth of small grain. 

As to politicks, things as yet, continue much as they have 
been, when I last wrote you. Ritchie continues his abuse, to 
which I have no objection. He has been long my secret foe, 
he is now an open and bitter one. Whatever impression he 
may make against me for the time, will in a short time react. 
I do not think, that there is the slightest prospect, that the 
old Hunkers of which he is the Organ, can ever again be 
resuscitated. They are incredibly corrupt; alike destitute 
of honor or honesty. They know, that I have sustained the 
democratick party for the last ten years, and that without 
my support, they would have been prostrated forever by the 
explosion of 1837. They know, that my support has been of 
the most disinterested character; and yet they hate me, with 
a deeper hatred, than what they do, their professed opponents, 
simply because of my opposition to the spoils principle and 
the caucus Machinery, the only cohesive power, that holds 
them together. But their days are numbered, and they see 
it; and hence the gnashing of the teeth, and bitter curses. I 
take it with perfect calmness. They shall have more cause 
for Wailling before I am done. The last session is but 
the prelude to the next, when the day of reconing will com- 
mence.

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 727 

To Duff G-reen. 1 

Fort Hill 17 th April 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, The mistake, which I think you and the 
most of my friends make in reference to myself is, that you 
da not fully realize how completely I hold my own advance- 
ment subordinate to what I deem my duty to the Country. 
Even in the ardour of youthful aspiration, when the Presi- 
dency was an object of desire, 1 never could bring my mind 
to yield to a measure, or course of policy, which I thought 
wrong, to obtain that high office; much less can I now, when 
it is no longer to me an object of desire. Had I arrived at 
the Presidency by any other way, than an upright, and fear- 
less discharge of what I conscienciously believed to be my 
duty, I would have been much more flexible, and under the 
influence of friends; but as it is, when I do not agree with any 
one portion, they have been too apt to suppose, that I had been 
influenced by those, with whom I happen to agree. You 
make this mistake as to my course in 1840. It may be, that 
the motives of those on the occassion, to which you refer, was 
such as you suppose; but, be that as it may, in making up my 
opinion, I had. no consultation with them, nor had their opin- 
ion in relation to the subject to which you refer, the least 
influence with me. I am always happy to hear the opinion of 
my friends and often avail myself of their suggestions, in 
modifying my course; but rarely ever in taking it. I have 
said thus much, because, I think, you not infrequently fall 
into error, in attributing, what is the result of my deliberate 
judgement to the influence of others. 

1 entirely agree with you, that the Presidential election 
ought to be held in reserve, with the restriction, that no one 
of the old hunkers or their nominee by the Baltimore conven- 
tion, shall get our support. I regard that portion of the 
party, as incurably corrupt. In their folly and profligacy 
they made the Mexican war, without seeing, that the success- 
ful general will ever be sure to turn the party, in this country, 
out of power, which makes a war. They began to see it, 
when it was too late, and hence their desire to have a Lieu* 
General and to strike a blow at Gen 1 Taylor during the last 

1 Original lent by Mr. R. P. Maynard. 



728 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

session. And hence, also, the sending of Gen 1 Scott, in the 
hope of exciting their mutual Jealousy and dividing their 
political friends on the Presidential question. Indeed, the 
movements, on the part of both parties, have looked to that 
exclusively. It is to be hoped, that the ver} r few, who look 
exclusively to the country, by taking an independent stand, 
and keeping in reserve their influence, may finally throw it, 
where something may be done to advance the publick good. 

1 am glad to learn, that you have closed a satisfactory ar- 
rangement, about your mountain property, and I hope that 
your expectation will be realized, but let me repeat my hope, 
expressed on a former occasion, that you will not engage in 
publishing a paper, unless you can see your way clearly. 
Your first duty is to your family. 

My Charleston friends appear disposed to make an effort to 
raise the necessary funds to establish a paper for the support 
of the South, on a solid basis, provided the other Southern 
States will cooperate, or at least a part of them. But, I fear, 
that their attention is so much absorbed in the events of the 
Mexican war, and that they are so much entangled by their 
party connections, that nothing will be done. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 6 th May 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, I am very happy to hear by yours by the 
Cambria, that you are all well. 

The views you take in reference to Ritchie, and the posi- 
tion in which it has placed me in reference to the hunker 
portion of the party are perfectly correct. They are incur- 
ably corrupt; and I am glad to be seperated from them by 
their own act. It places me on ground perfectly independent 
of either party; to act according to the dictates of my own 
judgement. The days of hunkerism is numbered. M r Polk is 
the last of the dynasty. It never can rise again to power. 
The folly and the vice of the party have destroyed it. He 
sought by the Mexican war to perpetuate the power of the 
party, but it will prove the means of his and their overthrow. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 729 

As things now stand, he will make Taylor his successor by 
making the war. It has made him the available candidate, 
and that of itself will be sufficient to rally a majority around 
him. Indeed, it would seem to be an established principle 
with us, that the party in power, which makes war, will be 
sure to be turned out of power by it; if successful, by the 
successful General; and if not, by the opposition. When 
that comes to be understood, as it will be, if Taylor should be 
elected, we never again shall have a war, when it can be 
averted. Had the administration had sufficient sagacity to 
see it, Taylor never would have been ordered to the del Norte, 
and there would have been no war. As much as I am opposed 
to military chieftains for presidents, I shall, thus thinking, be 
content to see him elected against M r Polk, or any one, who 
contributed to make the war; and, let me add, against the 
nominee of a convention, either democrat, or Whig. But I 
go no farther. I shall stand fast on my own doctrines, and 
act in conformity to them, in any emergency, including the 
Presidential. It is the only way, by which I can serve the 
country and preserve my character. 



To Mr*. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 10 th June 1847 

MY DEAR ANNA, If I have not written you more frequently, 
it is because Cornelia and your Mother write you constantly, 
and that for the last several packets, it has been necessary for 
me to write to M r Clemson, in reply to his letters and on busi- 
ness. It happens, for the first [time] for a considerable period, 
that there was no subject, which required I should write to 
him, and that your letter to me, was the only one received 
from Brussels by the packet before the last. The last steamer 
which sailed took no letter from us to either of you, as we were 
absent in Abbeville in attendance on Kate Townes Wedding. 
I think she has done well; but as Cornelia sends a long letter 
to you, in company with this, I take it for granted, she will 
be very full in her narative about the wedding and all that 
relates to our visit to Abbeville, so I shall pass them over. 
I am happy to hear, you are all so well, and that the children 



730 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

are making such progress; not in what is called learning only, 
but what is vastly more important at their age, in good sense 
and habits. I hear such favourable accounts of them, that I 
am extremely desirous of seeing them again, as well as yourself 
and M r Clemson; and sincerely hope, the time is not distant, 
when he shall think it for his interest to return to the U. States. 
If cotton should ever rise to 8 or 9 cents, steadily, as I hope 
it will, now that the immense stock, which had accumulated 
will be reduced to nothing by the end of the year. The 
present crop, thus far, is by no means promising. It is gener- 
ally very backward, small and not a good stand. Besides, that 
planted on the Mississippi bottom has been in a great measure 
ruined by the Fresh. I saw not more than two tolerable crops 
on my visit to Abbeville, and neither of them much, if any 
more forward, than mine. With their exception, mine is the 
best by far I have seen this season. The weather has been 
unfavourable, and insects have abounded. We have not had 
since the 1 st Week in April a single day that could be called 
warm, and are yet sleeping under a blanket, and 'till lately 
under two. We have rains now, but it is still too cool to give 
any great impulse to the growth of cotton. 

I met in Abbeville Hammond at M r M c Duffie's, and spent a 
night with him there. He gave the same account of the crop, 
as low down as his residence, and I do not doubt it is much 
the case over the whole cotton region. He speaks very favour- 
ably of his experiment in marling and the use of plaster of 
Paris; and enthusiastically of his efforts in reclaiming the 
swamp land on his tract. From what he states, they must be 
equal to the best lands in the Union, while the expense, is far 
less than it was supposed it would be at first. Should M r 
Clemson return, it would be worth while to look at the lands 
adjacent to him. The situation has great advantage in climate 
and position. 

I am not at all surprised, that the state of things in Belgium 
and Europe, generally, should excite the feelings and senti- 
ments you have so strongly expressed; and yet, bad as is the 
state of things there, it must, with the exception of this year 
of famine, be vastly superior to what it is in any other part of 
the old continent. We are for the present far better off; but 
it may be doubted whether we are not treading the path, that 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 731 

will lead in the end to a similar or worse state. Certain it is, 
that the preservation of our institutions and liberty occupy 
but little of the attention of our Government, Federal, or 
State, or that of the people. Wealth and power engross the 
attention of all. We act, as if good institutions and liberty 
belonged to us of right, and that neither neglect nor folly can 
deprive us of their blessing. I almost stand alone, in taking 
a different view, and soon I fear shall be entirely out of fashion. 

We have a most uncertain future before us. It began with 
the Mexican war. It has reached a critical point. I see noth- 
ing that can prevent us from taking the city, but what is to be 
the end of that, no one can tell. The present indication is, 
that we shall go on and subject, and hold in subjection, if we 
can the whole country ; and who can tell to what that may lead ? 
The only thing that seems probable is, that the Army and 
Navy are to become the controlling influence in the country, 
at least for another Generation. 

I am looking on calmly, but with deep interest, with the 
fixed resolve to do my duty, regardless of all consequences. 
The next session must be one of the most important, that has 
yet taken place. It will lead to many developements, and give 
us a glimpse of what is to come. My position is one of entire 
independence of party, and of great command; but it will re- 
quire much firmness, prudence and foresight to meet its duties, 
and responsibilities. I hope I will not prove unequal to the 
task it may impose. 

We are all well, and all join their love to you and M r Clem- 
son and the children. Kiss them for their grandfather and tell 
them how glad I am to hear they are so well, and behave so 
well. 

Willie has not yet returned, but we expect him next week. 



To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 10 th June 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, I received your two last letters, the one 
written at New York and the other after your return from 

1 Original lent by Mr. R. P. Maynard. 



732 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Washington, in which you urge pie to attend the Convention 
to be held in Chicago on the 4 th July. 1 

After giving the subject the most deliberat consideration, 
I cannot concur with you in opinion as to the expediency or 
propriety of my attending. 

My opinions in reference to internal improvement, both in 
reference to the Lakes and the Mississippi, have been fully 
expressed in my remarks at Memphis and the report on the 
proceedings of the Memphis convention. I have seen no 
reason since to change, or modify my opinion on any point. 
If I were to go to the Chicago convention, it would only be to 
repeat them, and to expose myself to the attack of those, who 
may be disposed to go farther than 1 can go, with my views 
of the Constitution, aided and backed by all, who may be 
politically opposed to me; while I would expose myself to the 
imputation of the very motive you assign for my going, and 
would lose more weight with the South, than I could possibly 
gain in the West. 

Such are the objections, which occur to me, regarding the 
subject in the light you do, in reference to myself and my 
political advancement. But political advancement has ceased 
to be for a long time any object to me, personally. I would 
accept the Presidency on no condition but to reform the Gov- 
ernment and carry out the principles and policy with which I 
am identified; and I have no idea that it will ever be tendered 
me for that purpose. All that remains for me is, to finish my 
course with consistency and propriety, and that I can only do, 
by an honest and manful discharge of my duty, while I 
remain in publick life. I am thankful to my friends for the 
interest they take in my elevation to power. One of the 
strong motives I would have to accept should it come to me, 
in a manner I could accept, would be to serve those, who have 
stood by me through so many trying scenes. Their attach- 
ment to me, has been the result of a community of sentiment 
in reference to the principles and policy of the Government; 
and, as such, I have ever regarded it, as alike honorable to 
them and me. Many of them, you among the others, overes- 
timate the chance of my elevation, by not taking the proper 

1 The Northwestern Harbor and River Convention. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 733 

view of the nature of the difficulty in my way. It may all be 
summed up in one, that I am not in favour of the spoil's policy. 
They who seek them are for the present masters of the coun- 
try; and so long, as they continue to be so, ever will resist 
successfully my elevation. Nothing but a reaction, which 
shall rouse the country to a sense of its danger, which may 
not occur, until too late, can ever elevate me to power. That 
such should be the case, I have no reason to complain. I 
selected my course with a full knowledge, that such would be 
the case; and so far from regretting it, I would do it over 
again, if it was in my option to choose. I am not disap- 
pointed, and have none of the feelings belonging to the dis- 
appointed. But, I must say, that I am occasionally mortified, 
at seeing how little I am understood by some of my oldest 
and most faithful friends, and you among them, as I infer 
from some of your remarks in your letter fromN. York. It is 
a grave charge to say, a man is unmindful of his friends. If I 
know myself, I would rather injure myself than a friend; and 
have ever been more unmindful of myself, than of them. It 
is I, who head without hesitation, or dread of consequences 
every assault on our common principles, and, if I have been 
careless of them, I have been much more so of myself. It 
would be a much truer estimate of my character to say, when 
duty is concerned, I am not only regardless of friendship or 
enmity but of myself. As to the case of Morton, my impres- 
sion is, that I neither took part, nor voted. When I saw how 
badly the democratick party was acting on the Wilmot pro- 
viso, I saw little choice between one, or another of the party, 
or between a democrat, or a Whig. Besides Williams, whom 
he turned out, gave a statement in his favour; and yet, it 
seems, this miserable affair, is the proof that I am not mind- 
ful of my friends. It had nothing to do with any friend. If 
he had been rejected it would have only made room for some 
other, equally objectionable. 



To Thomas G. Clemwm. c. c. 

Fort Hill 15 th June 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . Your views in reference to our 
political condition and affairs is so good, that I have little to 



734 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

add. I regard my position the best that it could be, in the 
present state of our affairs. By having done my duty fully 
in reference to the Mexican war, as it relates both to its origin 
and the mode it ought to have been conducted, I stand free 
of all responsibility, and independent of both parties, and 
their entanglement. It is difficult to say, which is most so in 
reference to the war; the administration and its party, as its 
Authors, or the Whigs for the folly and weakness of having 
voted for a war, which they had in discussion pronounced to 
be unconstitutional and unprovoked. 

I regard everything in reference to the war and its con- 
sequences as still uncertain. Whether victorious, or defeated 
our situation is bad. If the former, it would seem impossible 
almost to stop short of the Conquest of the country; and then 
comes the question; What shall we do with it? to annex it 
would be to overthrow our Government, and, to hold it as a 
Province, to corrupt and destroy it. The farther we advance, 
the more appearent the folly and wantoness of the war; and 
the more fully will the wisdom and patriotism of my course 
be vindicated. Indeed, already have the assaults on me termi- 
nated, except from the Would be Lieu* General. But his rav- 
ings prove not only his wounded pride, and his spite, but that 
he regards my position as strong. . . .

MY DEAR JAMES, There begins to be a good deal of feelings 
in this quarter in reference to the navigation of the Savanah 
River and M r Sloane has been appointed by the farmers 
society to attend the barbecue in Calhoun's Settlement on the 
3 d Inst. to present the views and feelings of the people here- 
abouts, as it is expected the Subject will be agitated on the 
occasion. His opinion at present is rather adverse to the 
practicability of rendering the river capable of steam naviga- 
tion, except at an enormous cost. In this, I think he is mis- 
taken, am I am sure he would be very happy to find he is. 

I have conversed with him freely, as to what would in my 
opinion, be the proper mode of proceedings on the part of 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 735 

the meeting to bring the subject fairly before the Legislature 
of our state and Georgia. The subject is one of great im- 
portance and I hope will be prosecuted with vigour. 



To TJwmas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 8 th July 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . There is not much to be added about 
politicks to what I wrote you last. The difference between 
North and South is daily increasing, in reference to the Slave 
question. It is hard to say to what it is destined to come. 
From every appearance, it will at least break up the old party 
organization. The indication is daily becoming stronger, in 
favour of General Taylor. The administration is evidently 
greatly alarmed at his popularity. Their fate is, however, 
sealed, whatever may become of the General. 

The prevailing opinion seems to be, that there will be peace 
ere long. I regard it, as doubtful. I have no doubt, but the 
administration is most anxious for it, and that Mexicans desire 
it, but when they come to fix on terms, there will be great 
difficult} 7 in agreeing. The former must insist, after so much 
blood and treasury, on a large cession of territory, and the 
latter will feel great repugnance to such cession. But be the 
terms, what they may, our difficulty within, will commence 
with the termination of those with Mexico. 



To Th&mas G. Clemson. 

Fort Hill 24 th July 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . We have had little of publick interest 
of late. The Mexican war has been at a stand. There is 
ever[y] now and then a movement in favour of General Tay- 
lor. The indication still is, that he will be the popular candi- 
date, in opposition to the caucus nominees. 1 think with you, 
that my position is the most eligible of all the publick men of 
our country. It is the onty independent one; and I can see 
symptoms, that it begins to be felt. 

I do not in the least doubt, but that you are right, as to the 
European terminus of our steam boat line; or as to the means, 



736 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

by which it was selected. It was done as everything with us 
is done, through favouritism. 

It is appearent, that the conflict between North and South is 
every day becoming more pointed and determined. If noth- 
ing else should be in the way it, of itself, will do much to 
break up the old party organizations. 

All join in love to you and Anna and the children. Tell 
them how happy Grandfather is to hear that they are so well, 
and are such good children.

Fort Hill 13 th Aug*. 1847 

MY DEAR ANNA, ... I am not at all surprised, that the 
victories our arms have achieved in Mexico should make so, 
deep an impression in Europe. They had greatly underesti- 
mated our strength and military skill; but I fear their devel- 
opement will have more pernecious influence at home, than 
beneficial abroad. I fear my forebodings will be realized to 
the fullest extent. The bitter is yet to come. I look forward 
to the next session of Congress, as one pregnant of events of 
the most momentous character. We shall, before it termi- 
nates, begin to. realize the train of events, to which the Mex- 
ican war was destined to lead. I shall go prepared to speak 
the truth, fully and boldly, and to do my duty regardless of 
responsibility. The next news from Mexico will probably 
bring information of the occupation of the Capital by Scott 
and his army. 

All join their love to you and M r Clemson and the children. 
Kiss them for their Grandfather, and tell them I wish to see 
them much. 



To Thomas G-. Ol&mton. 

Fort Hill 6 th Sep r 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, ... I agree with you, that the political con- 
dition of all western Europe is very unsettled, and especially 
France. Nor are we much better off. Our future is very 
uncertain. The old parties are disorganized. The adminis- 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 737 

tration weak; and the termination of the Mexican war, and 
what will grow out of it, uncertain. We must wait for the de- 
velopements of the next 12 months to know where we are. 
In the meantime, Clay and his friends are making a great 
effort to bring him out again, as a candidate, and will proba- 
bly succeed. Taylor has lost ground greatly, and will prob- 
ably be ruled off. He has written too many letters, and some 
of them very illy advised. Wright has died, 1 a severe blow 
to the Hunkers; and Benton is denouncing the administration, 
whether to break with them, or control them is uncertain; 
probably the latter. We (the State rights party) are making 
an effort to establish an independent press at Washington, as 
the organ of the South. A large amount has already been 
subscribed, and it is hoped, it will be in operation by the meet- 
ing of Congress. . . .- 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 24 th Oct r 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . You will have seen by the papers, that 
the City of Mexico is in possession of our army, and that the 
prospect of conquering peace is as remote as ever, as I sug- 
gested it might be in that case. Thus far, not an anticipation 
of the administration has been realized; and yet, if we may 
judge from indications, they are resolved to go thoughtlessly 
forward, when it is clear, whether defeated or successful, the 
result will be unfortunate to the country. If we should suc- 
ceed in conquering the whole what shall we do with it, or what 
can [we] do with it without ruin to our institutions? If we 
fail where shall we be? ...

We do not disagree, as to the cause of the war, nor as to its 
certain disasterous consequences in the end, let it terminate as 
it will. We also agree in the opinion, that the war ought 
to terminate, and that my position requires me to use my best 
efforts to bring it to an end. But the great practical question 
is; How can that be done? 

In deciding that question, it must not be overlooked, that 
both parties by large majorities stand committed by their 
recorded votes, not only to the war, but that the war is a war 
of agression on the part of the Republick of Mexico, agression 
by invation and spilling American blood on American soil, 
and thus committed also to the Rio Grande being the Western 
boundary of the state of Texas. It is true, that very few of 
either party believed, that there was any just cause for war, 
or that the Rio Grande was the Western boundary of Texas, 
or that the Republick of Mexico had made war on us by the 
invasion of our territory, or any other way; but it is equally 
true, that by an act of unexampled weakness, to use the mild- 
est terms, both stand by admission on record to the very 
opposite of their belief. And what is worse, they have by 
this act of unpar[all]elled weakness, committed large portions 
of both parties out of Congress to the war, as just and una- 
voidable on our part. 

The effect of all this, with brilliant atchievements of our 
arms, have been greatly to weaken the opposition and to 
strengthen the party in power, and to make it impossible, in 
my opinion, to terminate the war in the manner you propose. 
I go further, to attempt it, would only tend, under circum- 
stances, to weaken those, who make it, and give a new impulse 
to what is called the vigorous prosecution of the war, instead 
of bringing it to a termination. I thought so at the last ses- 
sion, and so informed M r . Berrien 1 and the other Whig mem- 
bers, when he presented his amendment, and such in my 
opinion has been the effect, and will continue to be its effect, 
if it should be renewed at the next session. The course I 
adopted then, or rather suggested, was the only one that had 
the least prospect of bringing the war to an end. I stood 
prepared to carry it out, if I had been supported; and, if I 
had been, the carnage and expenses of this campaign, would

have been avoided. I shall take my seat prepared to do all in 
my power to bring it to an end, consistently with the state of 
things, in which I may find the country; but 1 fear with as 
little support, as 1 had in opposition to the war, or in my 
attempt to terminate it, at the last session. The fatal error 
of the Whigs, in voting for the war, has rendered them 
impotent, as a party, in opposition to it; and let me add, that 
while I agree with them in the policy of preserving the peace 
of the country, as long as it can be consistently with honor, 1 
fear their timidity, as a party, on all questions, including 
peace and war, is so great, as to render their policy of pre- 
serving peace of little avail. It is not only in this instance, 
that it has disclosed itself. Even on the Oregon question, 
they gave away, before my arrival at Washington, on Cass's 
resolution, and rendered it very difficult to re[co]ver what was 
then lost. To go farther back; they made but feeble efforts 
to preserve peace during Jackson and Van Buren's time on 
the Maine boundary question, and permitted me to stand 
alone in open opposition to Gen 1 Jackson's course, in refer- 
ence to the French indemnity, backed by the report of 'the 
Committee of Foreign relations in the Senate, which, had it 
not been for the mediation of England, would have ended in 
War. I rose in my place in the Senate, after the report was 
read, and exposed and denounced the whole affair, without a 
voice raised in my support. It is this timidity, when they 
are right, in questions connected with our foreign relations, 
and their errors, in reference to those appertaining to our 
domestick relations, which keeps them out of power, notwith- 
standing their individual respectability, and prevents them 
from performing, with effect, the important duties of an 
opposition. I am sure you will excuse this free expression 
of my opinion, in relation to a party, with which you rank 
yourself.

that I am obliged to him for his proposed arrangement, but 
that I had previously made another arrangement for the 
session. 

I foresee a session of great distraction and confusion. The 
old party organization cannot much longer hold together. 
The want of sincerity and honesty on the part of both parties 
has confounded the country and the Government, and caused 
a state of things, from which it will be difficult to extricate 
ourselves. I confess, I do not see the end. My own course 
is clear and easy; to do my duty, without regard to conse 
quences personal to myself. If our institutions are destined 
to be overthrown, I am resolved, that no share of the responsi- 
bility shall rest on me. 



To Duff Green* 

Fort Hill 13 th Nov r 1847 

MY DEAK SIR, I have received your last. It is my inten- 
tion to be at Washington by the commencement of the session. 
The position of the country is very critical. Great caution 
and great firmness combined are necessary to extricate it from 
its present difficulties; and you will have to exercise them in 
an eminent degree to make your paper effective and success- 
ful* With them it may do much. Look to the country ex- 
clusively, avoid as much as possible personalities, either of 
praise or censure, and limit yourself to statements of facts, 
and calm and impartial discussion. I hope you have not taken 
a step, which will involve you in any pecuniary difficulties. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. 

Washington 10 th Dec r 1847 

MY DEAR SIR, ... I have not been here long enough to 
form an opinion, what course parties will take during the 
session. The Whigs have a small, but appearantly decided 
majority in the House, and the Democrats a large, but not a 
very reliable majority in the Senate. The session will be an 
eventful one. It will be difficult for either of the old parties

to hold together. I anticipate much confusion and distrac- 
tion. I send a cop} 7 of the Message. It is very long, very 
undignified and full of false assumptions. You will see that 
things have progressed to a point, where it is difficult to ad- 
vance or retreat; but I will write you more fully on political 
subjects hereafter. . . .

Washington 11 th Dec r 1847 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . You of course have seen the Mes- 
sage and the course it indicates to be pursued towards Mexico. 
The impression here is, that it is intended to conquor and 
subject the whole country. That at least will be the result if 
the course should be pursued; and if it should be, the end 
will be to hold it as a conquered Province or incorporate it 
in the Union. 1 Either will overthrow our system of Govern- 
ment. It may, indeed, have a different termination, which 
few yet dream of; and that is, to be held by the Army and 
Volunteers as an independent country. Keep this to your 
self. I have never whispered it before to any one; but it is 
not an improbable result. The country is in a most critical 
condition. It will be hard to save it.

Washington 26 th Dec r 1847 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER^ . . . Congress, as yet, has done but 
little, and will not do much more, until after the 1 st Jan y . 
On the fourth of that month my resolutions, 2 in reference to 
the Mexican war, will come up, when the discussion on that 
exciting and important subject will begin. The prospect is, 
that 1 shall be able to carry them. If I should, it will do much 
to arrest the war. If they should be defeated, We may look 
for the entire conquest and subjugation of Mexico. What a 
fearful result it will be for our country and institutions!

Already the interest in favour of its entire conquest and sub- 
jugation is exceedingly strong; and will, if not arrested by 
the vote of the Senate, become overwhelmingly so. Our peo- 
ple have undergone a great change. Their inclination is for 
conquest and empire, regardless of their institutions and 
liberty; or rather, they think they hold their liberty by a 
divine tenure, which no imprudence, or folly on their part, 
can defeat. When my resolutions were first introduced they 
were regarded by many as of little importance and uncalled 
for; but at present they are viewed in a very different light. 
For my part, I consider them, as among the most important I 
ever introduced, regarded in their practical bearing on the 
course of events hereafter. 1 only hope, I shall be able to do 
them full justice in what I ma} 7 say. If I should, I feel much 
confidence, I shall be able to arrest the present headlong en- 
thusiasm for war, which is rapidly impelling the country to 
its destruction.

also, for their Grandfather and tell them how much I wish to 
see them.

Washington 4 th Feb: 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . My speech * has had a veiy wide circu- 
lation and the impression is, that it has made a deeper impres- 
sion than any I ever delivered. It brought to the surface the 
strong feeling, which had been working below in favour of 
the conquest and holding as a Province, or annexing all Mexico; 
and which I can hardly doubt, if not intended, was looked to 
by the administration, as not an undesirable result. It has 
done more. It has turned the tide and brought the Union to 
a disavowal; but, I fear, that things have gone so far, that it 
will be found difficult to avoid a result so disastrous, as it 
would prove, should it occur. It seems, at least, pretty cer- 
tain, if I had not promptly made the movement, and taken 
the stand 1 did, such would have been the result of the War. 
Strange as it may seem, neither side had the least conception, 

iSee the preceding letter, and Works, IV, 396-424. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 743 

that there was any danger of it, when I introduced my reso- 
lutions. Both were disposed to regard this, as a mere abstrac- 
tion and an unnecessary precaution, but now all take a different 
view. 

The effect has been, to give- a new direction to the debate 
on the supplies of both men and money ; and one, on the part 
of the opposition, far more effecient. It is making on their 
side far deeper impression on the country, so much so, that 
nothing short of a treaty, or adopting the plan I suggested, 
can save the administration, if even that now can. The indi- 
cation at present is, a disposition on their part to adopt the 
policy of a defensive line. If nothing else, the financial dif- 
ficulties will compel them to treat, or fall back. 

The Presidential question is of course a leading topick. 
Clay's friends have made great efforts to bring him forward, 
but, it is said, in quarters which ought to know, without suc- 
cess. My impression still remains, that Taylor will be the 
Whig, or rather the popular candidate, against what may be 
called the Administration Candidate. Who that will be is 
doubtful. At present the prospect of Cass would seem to be 
the most promising . . . 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson, c. c. 

Washington 20 th Feb: 1848 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, ... As to politicks, things are very 
much as they were, when I last wrote M r Clemson. We have 
constant rumours of peace, but I can see no certain prospect 
of getting it. The policy I recommended in my speech is 
gaining friends; and I am of the impression, if peace is not 
made in a reasonable time, there will be a majority for it in 
both Houses and the Union. 

The Presidential election is the constant topick of agitation 
and conversation; but is involved in perfect uncertainty. The 
whigs are divided between Clay and Taylor: the latter I think 
will prove the stronger. The democrats are still more divided, 
as to the individual to be selected. But these are not the only 
devisions. There are others in reference to measures, which 
pervade both, and the two combined leave everything uncer- 
tain.

I keep aloof, standing independently on my own ground, 
seeking nothing either from the Government or the people. 
I would not change my position for that of any other. . . ,

Senate Chamber 23 d Feb. 1848 

MY DEAR ANDREW, The treaty with Mexico has just been 
laid before the Senate, and read. It will be warmly opposed, 
but I think it will be approved by the body. It will be a for- 
tunate deliverance, if it should be. A sudden impulse in that 
case, would be given to commerce, accompanied by a rise of 
price in our great staple so soon as it is known in England. 

The Slave question will soon come up, and be the subject of 
deep agitation. The South will be in the crisis of its fate. 
If it yields now, all will be lost. 

I enclose a speech by M r Yulee on his amendment to M r 
Dickenson resolutions. 1 They express substantially my views. 
Indeed, (in confidence), he is one of the members of our mess 
and has conversed with me freely on the principles, which 
control the question involved; but the execution is all his own. 

Love to all.

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, The letter from home enclosed with 
this, and mine to M r Clemson will give you all the Pendleton 
and political news, so that you must regard this but a brief 
answer to your's by the Britania. I am happy to hear that 
you all, except yourself, escaped the Influenza, and that you 
have recovered from its effects. 

You must not suppose, that in contending against corrup- 
tion and interest, that I am impelled by the hope of success. 
Had that been the case, I would long since have retired from 
the conflict. Far higher motives impel me; a sense of duty;

LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 745 

to do our best for our country, and leave the rest to Prov- 
idence. I hold the duties of life to be greater than life itself, 
and that in performing them manfully, even against hope, our 
labour is not lost, but will be productive of good in after 
times. Indeed, I regard this life very much as a struggle 
against evil, and that to him, who acts on proper principle, 
the reward is in the, struggle, tnore than in victory itself, al- 
though that greatly enhances it. So strong is my faith in this 
belief, my dear Daughter, that no appreciation of my efforts, 
either by the present, or after times, is necessary to sustain me 
in struggling to do my duty in resisting wrong, especially 
where our country is concerned,' although I put a high value 
on renown. You will thus see, that in struggling against the 
downward tendency of our country, it is not" because I do not 
take a just view of human nature, as 3 r ou suppose, but because 
I am actuated by higher motives, than what you attribute to 
me. But enough of this. 

I am not surprised, that the powers of Europe so much 
dread changes. They are right; because what are called re- 
form, will lead to anarchy, revolution and finally to a worse 
state of things than now exists, through the most erroneous 
opinions now entertained both in Europe and this country by 
the movement, or popular party, as to in wh[at] liberty con- 
sists, and by what means, it can be obtained and secured. 
Their opinion of liberty is, neither more nor less, than 
Dorrism.

Washington 7 th March 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, The last Steamer brought a letter from 
Anna to me, the only one received by it. I am happy to 
learn by it, that she had entirely recovered from the attack 
of the Influenza, and that you and the children had escaped 
and were in such excellent health. 

Since I wrote you last, the only occurrence, in the political 
world on this side, of marked importance, is the treaty with 
Mexico. It is now under deliberation in the Senate, and has 
been for the last nine days. No decisive vote has yet been 



746 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

taken; but 1 do not doubt, that the Senate will give its advise 
and consent to its ratification. The final vote will probably 
be taken tomorrow, or next day at fartherest. 

Its fate will, however, be still uncertain. Some important 
amendments have been made, to which the Mexican Govern- 
ment may object, although I do not think it probable. The 
greatest danger is, that the Government may not hold together 
until the treaty is exchanged. Nothing but the countenance 
of our Government, and the support of capitalists interested 
in preserving it, can continue it in existence. It is, indeed, 
but the shadow of a Government. 

As to the terms of the treaty, they are not such as to con- 
fer any eclat on the war, or the administration. I cannot of 
course speak of them in detail, but may say, the end of all 
our expenditure of blood and money is, to pay the full value 
in money for the country ceded to us, and which might have 
been had without a war, or for the 10 th part of its cost by 
taking a defensive line from the first, as I advised. The de- 
sire for peace, and not the approbation of its terms, induces 
the Senate to yield its consent. 

The presidential election is in as great uncertainty as ever. 
The whigs are violently devided between Clay and Taylor, 
and the democrats know not who to rally on. It is, indeed, a 
mere struggle for the spoils, and the selection of both parties 
will in the end be governed solely by the availability of the 
candidate, and not his qualifications. 

I enclose two letters for Anna, which will give all the home 
news. 

The winter has been delightful, and highly favourable for 
agricultural operations. 

My health is good.

MY DEAR SIR, . . . The Cambria brought us the intelli- 
gence of the Revolution in Paris, the overthrow of the late 
dynasty and the establishment of a Republick. Your letter, 
tho' dated as late as the 24 th Feb., makes no allusion to it; 



LETTERS OF JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 747 

from which I infer the intercourse by the railroad had been 
interupted. It is, indeed, a great event, I would say a ter- 
rifick one for Europe. No one will say where it will stop. 
France is not prepared to become a Republick. I hope the 
Governments of Europe will look on without interference, 
and let the process take its natural course. It seems to me, 
looking on from this distance, that interference would but 
increase the flame and spread it more widely. But it is too 
early yet to speculate. We wait impatiently for the next 
arrival. As to ourselves, I feel pretty confident, we shall 
have peace with Mexico, or if we fail in that, we shall take a 
defensive position, which would in effect terminate the war. 
That closed, we shall have no exciting question, but that con- 
nected with the Wilmot proviso, and the Presidential election. 
The fate of both is still in a state of great uncertainty. It is 
impossible to sa} T , with any certainty even now, who will be 
the candidate of either party. 

All were well when I last heard from home. My health is 
as good as usual, and I have been less subject to colds than 
what I was last winter and the one before. 

Love to Anna and the children. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. 

Washington 1 st April 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 am very happy to learn by your's and 
Anna's letters by the Caledonia, that you were all well, and 
that Belgium was so quiet, and disposed to pursue, what ap- 
pears to me at this distance, so wise a course; to maintain her 
institutions and nationality and to prepare to defend them. 
I hope there will be the same good sense on the part of other 
European powers. Thus far the revolution in France exhibits 
to the inexperienced eye a fair prospect; but I see much to 
excite in me deep distrust as to the result. Indeed, I have 
no hope, that she will ever be able to establish any govern- 
ment deserving to be called a republick. She has on this side 
of the Atlantick much sympathy but little confidence among 
the thinking. The subject of tendering our congratulations 
was brought up in the Senate yesterday, on resolutions offered 



748 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

by M r Allen. A short running debate took place in which I 
took part. I send the sheet containing it, which will give the 
views presented by myself and others. 1 There is a decided 
majority in the Senate against hasty action, or expression of 
opinion. The Senate will wait the action of the National 
Convention. I enclose also my remarks on the 10 Regiment 
Bill. 2 They are badly reported and printed, but will give a 
correct conception of the grounds on which I placed my ob- 
jections to the bill. 

I also enclose a letter from her Mother to Anna, and two 
letters received under cover for you. 

Since I wrote you by the last Steamer we have had no 
political occurrence worthy of note. The prospects of a 
peace with Mexico still continues good, and the uncertainty, 
in reference to the Presidential election is still as great as 
ever. 

My love to Anna and the children. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 13 th April 1848. 

MY DEAR SIR, I was disappointed in not receiving any letter 
by the Hibernia from Brussels. 

Since I wrote you by the preceeding Steamer, nothing ma 
terial has occurred on this side of the Atlantick. The pros- 
pect of peace with Mexico has not changed, and the presiden- 
tial question continues as doubtful as it was. 

Our attention now is turned from ourselves to your side of 
the Ocean. We are all gazing with intense interest on the 
mighty scenes, which are exhibiting there, and wondering 
where they will terminate. Germany seems to be in a fail- 
way to be completely revolutionised, and I hope permanently 
improved. I have much more hope for her, than France. 
Her old institutions, as I suppose we may call them now, 
furnish an excellent foundation, on which to errect, if not a 
federal Republick like ours, a federal constitutional Govern- 
ment, United at least in a Zollverein league, and something 
more intimately united politically, than at present. If the 

i Works, IV, 450-453. "- Ibid. , 425-449,

States of Germany should not attempt too much, the events, 
which have occurred may do much to strengthen them and 
better their condition. With these impressions, I shall look 
with anxiety to the proceedings of the Diet, which was to 
meet on the 2 d of April. 

I am glad to see Belgium acting so wisely. Thus far the 
course of events there indicate much moderation and wisdom, 
as they appear to me, looking on at this distance. 

I fear the prospect for France is not so good. I look more 
to the reaction from Germany to save her, than any other 
cause. If the latter should take a firm stand to preserve its 
nationality, to adopt wise constitutional reforms, and to form 
a more intimate commercial and political Union, it could no- 
but have a powerful and salutary reaction on France, and 
might lead to some stable constitutional form of Government 
with her. Otherwise, I see little hope of such a result. 

You must regard all this, as little more than the expression 
of hopes. 

I received by the last mail the enclosed from your overseer, 
which although addressed to me on the outside, is addressed 
to you within. 

I hope you all continue well. My health still continues 
good, although subject to colds, and never entirely free from 
a cough. 

I hope, notwithstanding the state of things in Europe, you 
will be able with your family to make us a visit in the sum- 
mer or fall. 

My love to Anna and the children. All were well, when 
I last heard from home, a few days since. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 15 th April 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter indicates much and mature re- 
flection on the character and tendency of the present great 
crisis of the civilized world. It is clear, that the old mon- 
archies on the continent of Europe are about coming to an 
end. The intelligence and progress of the age have out grown 
them; but it is by no means certain, that they are so advanced 



750 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

and enlightened on political science, as to substitute more? 
suitable ones in their place. I fear they are not. It seems to 
me, that what is called the progress party, both in this coun- 
try and in Europe, have not advanced in political knowledge 
beyond Dorrism; that is, the right of a mere majority to over- 
turn law and constitution at its will and pleasure. They must 
be cured of this radical and most dangerous of all errors, before 
they can substitute in the place of those that may be over- 
thrown, better Governments. Nothing but woful experience 
can apply a remedy; except perhaps in Germany, where the 
advantage of an existing system of confederation of states, 
and the dread of France from the experience of the first revo- 
lution, may lead to establish a federal system some what like 
ours. I have far more hope of her, than of France, or any 
other of the continental Countries. Indeed, I look to her to 
save Europe, including France herself. 

What I propose to publish on the subject of Government is 
not yet prepared for the press. I had hoped to have had it 
prepared last fall; but was so interrupted, as to fall far short of 
my calculation. I am, and fear will continue to be, too much 
occupied here during the session to do anything towards its 
completion, but will resume it, as soon as I return home. I 
do not think anything will be loast by the delay. I do not 
think the publick mind is yet fully prepared for the work, 
nor will be, until there has been such failure and embarass- 
ment in the French experiment (which will be made under 
highly favourable circumstances) as will bring into distrust 
and doubt, Dorrism, so as to prepare the publick mind to have 
its errors and consequences pointed out, and to reflect seri- 
ously on the question; What are the elements, which are indis- 
pensible to constitute a constitutional popular Government^ 

I am obliged to you for the suggestions you have made, 
both in reference to the topicks to be discussed, and the pre- 
cautions to be adopted in securing the copy right. My plan 
is to divide it into two parts; an elementary treatise on politi- 
cal science, to be followed by a treatise on the Constitution of 
the United States, not in the shape of commentaries, but a 
philosophical discussion on its character and constitution in 
illustration of the elementary Treatise. To avoid details, as 
much as possible, I propose to annex the various Speeches, 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 751 

Reports and letters, in which I have discussed Constitutional 
questions, and to refer to them in illustration of my opinion 
of the various parts of the Constitution, to which they relate. 
I hope I may have so far completed my labours, before I leave 
home next fall, as to enable me to submit the work to your 
perusal. 

I wait the meeting of the Convention in France and the 
German Diet with deep interest. They will afford much 
light by which to judge the future. 

I see no reason to doubt, but we shall [have] peace with 
Mexico. The administration intended to conquer and annex 
the country, but were defeated by my speech on my resolu- 
tions which so effectually turned the tide of publick sentiment 
as to compelled them to take Trist's treaty. 1

Washington 16 th April 1848 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . Everything here is in a state of 
uncertainty, in reference to the Presidential election. The 
parties are more distracted than ever. Clay's address 2 has 
done him great injury with his part} r . It has in particular 
deeply offended the Southern portion. 

In the mean time, the address of the Barnburners, just come 
out, has weakened and distracted the Democratick party. 
They take strong ground against us on the Wilmot proviso, 
and proclaim that they must be received by the Baltimore Con- 
vention to the exclusion of the Hunker delegates from the 
State. That I take it will be impossible, and a permanent 
split, with the loss of the State will be the result. I trust, 
out of all this confusion, a sufficient number of both parties 
will be found to be independent enough to make a rally to 
save ourselves and our institutions. As bad, as you suppose 
things to be here, it is not worse than the reality. 

We are waiting with impatience for farther information 
from Europe. I have little hope from France, but a good

Washington 28 th April 1848 

Mr DEAR DAUGHTER, The Sarah Sands brought me a letter 
from M r Clemson and one from you to Cornelia, but none 
was received by the Acadia from either of } T OU. 

I was happy to hear of the continued good health of your- 
self and M r Clemson and the children, and how much they 
grow and improve. 

We all, on this side of the Atlantick, look with intense 
solicitude on the great events, transpiring in Europe, and no 
one more so than myself. As frequent as the arrivals of 
Stemers now are, and as short as is the interval between 
their arrivals, there is no abatement of the anxiety with which 
each succeeding one is looked for. If there be the interval of 
but a few days, as much and more exciting news is expected, 
than formally there was after one of a month. I look, per- 
haps, with greater solicitude for the unfolding of the great 
events now in progress in Europe, as the} 7 afford me an oppor- 
tunity to test the truth or error, of the principles, which I 
have laid down in my elementary discourse on Government. 
It is as yet in the rough draft, waiting the completion of the 
rough draft of the discourse on our system of Government. 
I cannot doubt the correctness of the principles, I have laid 
down, for they are drawn from facts in the moral world, just 
as certain, as any in the physical; but I am solicitous to see, 
how far they are subject to modification in their practical 
application to the present condition of the civilized world, 
which is so very different from any, that ever preceded it in 
many respects. There are powerful, long established, and 
widely extended errors now at work, which tend to universal 
disorder and anarchy throughout Christendom; while on the 
other hand there are powerful causes in operation to counteract 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 753 

them, and which, I trust, and believe, in time, will overpower 
them, and give a fairer prospect, than has ever yet existed, to 
the cause of real liberty and civilization. But in the meane 
time, it is to be feared, there will be great disorders, conflicts 
and suffering. You will see, that I am still hopeful. Had 
such a revolution, so wide and so rapid, occured 50 years 
ago, I would have dispaired, and regarded it, as the com- 
mencement of a great retrograde movement in the most advanced 
and civilized portion of the world. Even now, I regret 
greatly regret its rapidity, extent, and too thorough and 
radical character, especially in France. It ought never be 
forgotten, that the past is the parent of the present, and that 
the past condition of Europe, which has given birth to a state 
of advance and civilization, far exceeding any heretofore 
known to the world, could not be a bad one. It may have, 
indeed, contained, within itself, causes calculated to retard, or 
prevent a farther progress, but these ought to have been 
removed cautiously, as experience pointed them out, without 
overthrowing all at once the peace of Governments, and the 
social condition of communities, which led to such great and 
happy results; especially as such an overthrow must of neces- 
sity be accompanied by such universal embarrassment and 
distress, and run the hazard of a retrograde, instead of an 
advance movement, in the condition of the race. 

I had, my dear daughter, no intention of writing you such 
a letter, when I took up my pen. I commenced with the 
intention, to relate the ordinary occurrences of the day on 
this side of the Ocean; but the allusion to the far greater, 
taking place in Europe, has led me, insensibly, in the direction 
I have taken. You must take it, better for worse, as I have 
not time to write another, or space, more than briefly to touch 
on, what I intended to make the subject of my letter. 

My health continues as usual. When I last heard from 
home (a few days since) all were well and doing well. Your 
mother had turned to guarding and improving the yard, 
which Willey writes, has kept her employed, cheerful and 
hearty. 

With love to M r Clemson, and kisses for the children.

To Thomas G. Clemson,. c. c. 

Washington 13 th May 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, I have been disappointed in not having re- 
ceived, either from you or Anna, any letter by the last two 
Steamers. It is at all times a source of pleasure to hear from 
you; but it is especially so at the present, when Europe is 
the scene of such extraordinary events. I know not how 
they may appear to you, who are in the midest of them; but 
to me, who look on at so great a distance, they appear to be 
without a parallel in the history of the world. They are, 
indeed, so much out of the ordinary course of events, that it 
is difficult to form an opinion, as to the results they will lead. 
My apprehension is, that the old system of things have been 
overthrown, before Europe had become prepared to establish 
a new and better; and that a long period of confusion and 
disorder, if not anarchy, may intervene before order can be 
restored, especially in France, where the impulse was first 
given. With this apprehension, I regard it of vast impor- 
tance, that Great Britain should resist the shock, that has 
overturned so many Governments; and, of course was grati- 
fied to learn that she had passed successfully the crisis caused 
by the movements of the Chartists. If they had ended in a 
revolution, it would have greatly increased the force and pro- 
longed the period of the convulsion, through which Europe is 
now passing. But as it is, it will contribute, I hope, not only 
to shorten it, but to guard thereby against one of the greatest 
dangers to which she is at present exposed. I refer to that 
which may be apprehended from Russia, in case Europe 
should be thrown into a state of distraction and disorder for 
any considerable period. In that event, her power might 
prove irresistible and her sway be extended over the greater 
part of the Continent. 

As to ourselves, We are going on much as we did for the 
last four. years. Everything still remains in a state of un- 
certainty; the Mexican question, the Presidential election and 
all. It is just as uncertain, whether we shall have peace with 
Mexico, or not, and who will be nominated by the two con- 
ventions (although one meets in 9 days, and the other shortly 
after) and which of the two, who may be nominated, will be 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 755 

elected, as it was three months ago. In the meane time, 
another question has been started, which may involve us in 
as great difficulties, as the Mexican; I refer to the Yucatan. 
It is now under discussion. I expect to speak day after 
tomorrow, if I can get the floor, and shall discuss it fully. 1 

I had a letter from home a few days since. All were well 
and the crop looking remarkable well. It has been remark- 
able cool for the season of the year for the last few days, but 
I hope not so much so, as to hurt the fruit, or crop materially. 

My love to Anna and the children. I fear the state of 
things in Europe may prevent your intended visit, which I 
would greatly regret on yours and our own account. We 
anticipated much pleasure in seeing you all, and still hope we 
shall not be disappointed. 



To James JZdward Calh&un. c. c. 

Washington 22 d May 1848 

MY DEAR JAMES, I am happy to have your approval of my 
remarks in reference to the French Revolution. I see they 
have attracted much attention in England, and drawn forth 
high compliments. I regard the failure of the Chartists in 
England as you do. It was the turning point of affairs in 
Europe. Had they succeeded, it would been long very long, 
before order and authority would be restored in Europe; but 
as it is, the revolutionary movements have gone, probably as 
far as it is destined to go, at least for the present. . . . 

As to politicks, ever} 7 thing still remains in a state of uncer- 
tainty. Although the Baltimore Convention is now in Session, 
no one pretends to form an opinion, as to who will be the 
nominee. Report from Baltimore just received, says that 
Cass and Buchanan will unite their forces, each being agreed 
to rally on the other, if the strongest. If such should be the 
case, the former will probably be nominated; but I put little 
faith in the union. I have no confidence in either. 

It is now more doubtful than it has been, whether the Gov- 
ernment of Mexico will ratify the treaty. The prospect 
would seem to be against it. Should it not be ratified, there 

* Calhoun spoke on the Yucatan question on May 15. Works, IV, 454-478. 



756 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

will be a great effort made to take the Whole, but, I trust I 
shall be able to defeat it, by taking my stand on a defensive 
line that of the treaty. 

The Yucatan question is dropt for the present. Whether 
it will be revived will depend on circumstances. My speech 
against it appeared in the Inteligencer this morning. I will 
send you a copy, as soon as I can get some extra copies of the 
paper. It is thought it made a strong impression, and con- 
tributed principally to the dropping of the question for the 
present. 

It was one of the wildest and most absurd measures ever 
proposed by the Executive. Congress will not adjourn prob- 
ably before August. 

My health continues good. I am sorry to learn by your 
sister's letter to me that yours was delicate when you were at 
Fort Hill. I hope it is better. 



To Thomas G. Clemson, c. c. 

Washington 26 th May 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, Since my last I have received your's of the 
26 th April, with letters from Anna for her Mother and Cor- 
nelia. 

I see by our last arrival, that France and Germany are be- 
gining the work of reconstruction. That is the task; not but 
that they may form new Governments for that is not difficult; 
but can they form such, as will stand and put an end to revo- 
lution? Germany, if wise, may; for she has the materials, 
but, I fear, that in France it will, at least for the present, 
prove impossible. She has it is evidently made great prog- 
ress, since her first revolution, in political knowledge, which 
has thus far guarded her against those scenes of violence and 
blood shed which marked the first, but there are great diffi- 
culties before her. She is entering on an untrodden path; to 
reconstruct Society, as well as Government; with materials 
not well suited to either purpose. I shall watch the attempt 
with profound interest, but with little expectation of its suc- 
cess. I hope she will be permitted to have a fair opportu- 
nity, so that if she fails, it will be attributed to the intrinsick 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 757 

difficulty of the task, and not to interference and difficulties 
from without. If, under such circumstances', she should fail, 
I see no alternative for her, but an imperial Government. 

Since I last wrote you, the prospect of the ratification of 
the treaty by Mexico is more doubtful. The impression now 
is, that it will not be. In the meane time, we are threatened 
with a very troublesome question about Yucatan. I enclose 
herewith my remarks on the subject. It is not satisfactorily 
reported, although it passed under my revision. 1 I simply 
corrected the report of the Stenographer, without writing out 
my speech. It will, however, give you a pretty correct and 
full view of my argument. 

The Baltimore convention is now in session, but has not yet 
made a nomination. I will keep my letter open until I hear 
the result. Among its proceedings, it has admitted a man of 
the name of Commander, to cast the 9 votes of S. Carolina, 
although his authority to act was derived solely from a small 
meeting in Georgetown of 54 persons, of whom the greater 
part were Yankee merchants and Jews doing business there, 
without having permanent residence. What a farce! And 
yet, as far as the party is concerned, the nomination of the 
body is the election of the President. . . . 

28 th May 

The Baltimore convention nominated Gen 1 Cass for the 
Presidency and Gen 1 Butler of Kentucky for the V Presi- 
dency, after much distraction and difficulty. I do not think 
the ticket will succeed. 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. 

Washington 23 d June 1848 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, If a long interval lies between the 
date of this and your last, you must attribute it to the fact, 
that my heavy correspondence, publick and private, and offi- 
cial duties, compel me to lengthen the period between my 
answers and the letters to which they reply, to a much greater 
extent than I desire in writing to you and the rest of the 

i Works, IV, 454-478. 



758 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

family. I correspond with all of them which of itself occu- 
pies a good deal of my time. 

The opinions you express in reference to the state of things 
in Europe are very sensible and just. There is no prospect 
of a successful termination of the efforts of France to estab- 
lish a free popular Government; nor was there any from the 
begining. She has no elements out of which such a govern- 
ment could be formed; and if she had, still she must fail from 
her total misconception of the principles, on which such a 
government, to succeed, must be constructed. Indeed, her 
conception of liberty is false throughout. Her standard of 
liberty is ideal; belongs to that kind of liberty which man 
has been supposed to possess, in what has been falsely called 
a state of nature, a state supposed to have preceded the social 
and political, and in which, of course, if it ever existed, he must 
have live[d] a part, as an isolated individual, without Society, 
or Government. In such a state, if it were possible for him 
to exist in it, he would have, indeed, had two of the elements 
of the French political creed; liberty and equality, but no 
fraternity. That can only exist in the social and political; 
and the attempt to unite the other two, as they would exist, 
in the supposed state of nature, in man, as he must exist in 
the former, must and ever will fail. The union is impossible, 
and the attempt to unite them absurd; and must lead, if per- 
sisted in, to distraction, anarchy and finally absolute power, 
in the hand of one man. 

It is this false conception that is upheaving Europe, and 
which, if not corrected, will upset all her efforts to reform 
her social and political condition. It is at the same time 
threatening our institutions. Abolitionism originates in it, 
which every day becomes more formidable, and if not speed- 
ily arrested, must terminate in the dissolution of our Union, 
or in universal confusion, and overthrow of our system of 
Government. But enough of these general speculations. 

We are in the inidest of the presidential canvass. It will 
be one of great confusion. Neither party is satisfied, or 
united on its nominee; and there will probably be a third can- 
didate, nominated by what are called the Barnburners, or Van 
Burenites. The prospect, I think, is, that Taylor will sue-

ceed, tho' it is not certain. The enclosed will give you all the 
home news. 

It is still uncertain, when Congress will adjourn; but, I 
think it probable it will about the 1 st August. 

My health continues good. I am happy to hear you are all 
well, and that the children [are] growing and doing so well. 
Kiss them for their Grandfather, and tell them how happy he 
is to learn, that they are such good children. Give my love 
to Mr. Clemson. 



To James Edward Calhoun. c. c. 

Washington 9 th July 1848 

MY DEAR JAMES, . . . The Senate is engaged in a debate 
on the Oregon territorial bill. It has been very able and 
high toned on the part of the South, with a great concurence 
of views between the Whigs and the democratick members of 
the South. I do hope our present danger will bring about 
union among ourselves on the most vital to us of all questions. 
All other questions ought to be dropt. In Union lies our 
safety. I opened the debate on our side. 1 My speech will 
be printed in pamphlet form in a few days when 1 will send 
you one. Most of my friends think it the best I ever made, 
and if I may judge from the number of applications I have 
received for copies from the North will be in great demand 
there. It is difficult to say, what will be done. The present 
appearance is against the prospect of doing anything. I 
would not be surprise[d], if Congress should adjourn and 
leave things just as they are. It will not probably be in ses- 
sion more than a month longer.

but was prevented by the pressure of my official engagements,

as a member of the Committee, raised to settle the question 
of Slavery, as it relates to our recently acquired territory. 
After a laborious effort of more than a week, the Committee, 
consisting of 8 members, 4 from each party, and 2 from each 
division of the party, North and South, selected by their 
respective Sections, agreed on a bill, with scarcely a division, 
which is now under discussion in the Senate, with a fair pros- 
pect of passing by a large majority; and which I hope will 
permanently settle this vexed and dangerous question. The 
settlement is based on the principle of non interference, as 
laid down in my speech on the Oregon territorial bill, of 
which I send you a cop} 7 accompanying this. It was found, 
after trying every other, that it was the. only one, on which 
there was the least chance of adjusting it. It is regarded 
here, as a great triumph on my part. A trial vote in the 
Senate yesterda} 7 , stood 37 in favour of the bill against 17 
opposed. The opposition is mainly composed of the Sup- 
porters of M r Van Beuren. 

As to the Presidential election, it is very doubtful, and will 
probably remain so, to the last. There is no enthusiasm 
about it. There are great objections to both candidates. 

The progress of events in Europe is very much such as I 
anticipated. There are too much error and misconception of 
a deep and dangerous character at the bottom of the move- 
ment to hope for much good. I have briefly touched one of 
the leading in the speech, that goes with this, at its close. 
There are others not less dangerous. . . .

Washington 11 th Aug*. 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . Congress will adjourn on the 14 th Inst, 
and I shall leave immediately after for home. 

Nothing very material has occurred since my last. The 
Oregon territorial bill from the House was passed last evening 
by the Senate with an amendment attaching the Missouri Com- 
promise to it. It is doubtful whether the House will agree to 
it, or not. If it should not the bill will be lost. 

The Buffalo Convention is in session, and has, it is said, 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 761 

nominated Van Buren. It is uncertain to what it will lead. If 
the movement should not run out with the election, it will lead 
to the formation of two great sectional parties, and that to re- 
sults, which may lead to great changes. 

The election thus far, judging from indications, is more 
favourable to Cass, than Taylor. I retain and intend to retain 
my independent position. 

We shall anxiously wait to see you all. With love to Anna 
and the children,

Washington 24 th Jan y 1849 

MY DEAR ANNA, I was happy to learn by your letter, that 
you were all spending your time so agreeably, at the Cane 
Brake. I feared, that you, with all your philosophy, would 
find the change between Brussels and so retired a place, too 
great to be agreeable; especially with all the vexation of house 
keeping, where supplies are so limited and little diversified. 

I gave in my letters, written a few days since to your Mother 
and M r Clemson, an account of the state of my health. Since 
then it has been improving, and I now feel fully as well as 
usual. The day is fine and I will take my seat again in the 
Senate. The slight attack of faintness, which passed off in 
less than a minute, was caused by several acts of imprudence, 
and among others, by doing what has not been usual with me, 
sponging my bod}' all over as soon as I got up. The morning 
was cold and my system did not react, as I hoped it would. I 
must be more careful hereafter and not tax my mind as heavily 
as I have been accustomed to do. 

I had a letter from John a few days since. He is under the 
operation of the water cure, and says that he already feels 
much benefitted. He writes that M r M c Duffie has been so far 
restored as to be free of the dyspeptick and nervous symptoms, 
but that the paralized limbs remain unremedied. 

The meeting of the Southern members took place again last 
Monday night. My address was adopted by a decided ma- 
jority. 1 You will see a brief account of the proceedings in the 

i " Address of the Southern Delegates in Congress to their Constituents," relating to the 
opposition to the Wilmot Proviso. See Calhoun's Works, VI, 285-312.

Union, which goes with this. It is a decided triumph under 
[the] circumstances. The administration threw all its weight 
against us, and added it to the most rabid of the Whigs. Vir- 
ginia has passed admirable resolutions, by an overwhelming 
vote. The South is more roused than I ever saw it on the 
subject. I shall postpone the reflections, which your state- 
ment of the conversation of Co 1 Pickens gave rise to, until I 
shall see you, with a single exception. He has constantly en- 
deavoured to hold me in the wrong by attempting to make the 
impression, that I have been influenced in my course towards 
him by the artful management of persons hostile to him. There 
is not the least foundation for it. No attempt of the kind has 
ever been made; and no man knows better than himself, how 
far I am above being influenced by such attempts; for no one 
has ever done as much to endeavour to influence methatw T ay, 
as himself, and as he knows without success. I have never 
regarded the course, which has led to the present relation 
between us with any other feeling but that of profound regret, 
on his account. 
Mv love to all.

Washington 14 th Feb. 1849 

MY DEAR SIR, I have no copy with me of your letter, re-

except from yourself. If you have a spare cop}^ 1 would be 
obliged to you for enclosing it to me, and to return the letter 
of M r Jackson with it. 

I enclosed you a copy of our Address, which I hope you have 
received, and that it meets your approbation. I trust it will 
do something to Unite the South, and to prepare our people 
to meet and repel effectually and forever the aggressions of 
the North. Already the stand taken here and in Virginia, 
N. C. our State and Florida has made a deep impression on 
the North. Missouri is about to take a firm and decided 
stand and Kentucky will, I learn, put down effectually the 
attempt in favor of emancipation proposed to be made in the 
Convention to be held this year in that State. It is spid, there

will not be three members of the body in favour of it. But 
this and all other favourable symptoms, so far from relaxing, 
ought to add new energy to our efforts. Now is the time to 
vindicate our rights. We ought rather than to yield an inch, 
take uny alternative, even if it should be disunion, and I trust 
that such will be the determination of the South.

Fort Hill 10 th April 1849 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, I had a safe and pleasant journey 
home. The weather was pleasant and Spring was rapidly 
advancing. The Jessamine and Dogwood were in bloom, and 
the forest had just commenced clo[th]ing itself with green. 
The contrast was great between being pent up in a boarding 
house in Washington and breathing the pure fresh air of the 
country, made fragrant by the blossoms of Spring. 

Patrick accompanied me to your Uncle James, where we 
met your Mother and Sister. They, with your Uncle, were 
well. I remained there four days, when we took our depar- 
ture for Fort Hill, leaving Patrick with his Uncle. We found 
all well on our arrival, and the place in good order and busi- 
ness forward, considering that the measles had passed through 
the negro quarter during the winter, and that none, but a few 
had escaped, but with the loss of only one, an infant of a con- 
stitution too feeble to survive the attack. I shall finish plant- 
ing cotton to day, and the whole of my crop this week. The 
small grain looks well, and the place bears the appearance of 
good order. 

We have no local news, in which you would take interest. 

John returned from Milledge Ville by the last Stage but 
one. He looks well and I think his health is much improved 
by the Water cure. His cough is much better. He is quite 
a convert to the system. I advise him to visit the estab- 
lishment at Brattleborough in Vermont, both to complete his 
cure and perfect himself in the practise. He says, that Gen 1 
M c Duffie has improved wonderfully under the process. He 
is entirely relieved from the Dyspepsia and his nervous affec- 
tions, and has recovered the free use of his arms, is cheerful, 



764 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

sleeps well, and eats heartily. With the exception of his par- 
alized leg [he] may be said to be well. 

I have for some time believed, that the process, carried to 
a certain extent, would be of service to me; and have deter- 
mined, under John's superintendence, to make a trial. I 
began this morning with what is called the wet sheet, or 
rather the damp sheet, which in effect is no more nor less, 
tha'i a safe and efficient form of the vapour bath. I remained 
wrapt round with the sheet, and covered with 8 or 9 blankets 
for li hours, and ended in a warm bath, and an effectual rub- 
bing dry. The process was soothing and pleasant. It has 
cleansed the skin effectually, and I doubt not, done much to 
open the pores the one thing, in my opinion, needful to me. 
I shall persist in it until I give it a fair trial; and if 1 find it 
as beneficial as I expect, 1 shall fix up a complete bathing 
establishment. I am pleased with the first essay; and I hope 
it will prove a substitute for brandy tody and hot punch. 
They have, I doubt not done me good; but, I think, the water 
cure will do me still more. 

All join their love to you, M r Clemson and the Children. 
Kiss them for their Grandfather and tell them how much I 
miss them. 

[P. S] You see I substitute a C for an M in your name. I 
hope you will adopt the change. 1

importance and responsibility.

occasion to State, that I am of the impression that the time is 
near at hand when the South will have to chose between dis- 
union, and submission. I think so, because I see little pros- 
pect of arresting the aggression of the North. If anything 
can do it, it would be for the South to present with an un- 
broken front to the North the alternative of dissolving the 
partnership or of ceasing on their part to violate our rights 
and to disregard the stipulations of the Constitution in our 
favour; and that too without delay. I say without delay; for 
it may be well doubted whether the alienation between the 
two sections has not already gone too far to save the Union; 
but, if it has not, there can be none that it soon will, if not 
prevented by some prompt and decisive measure. It has been 
long on the increase and is now more rapidly increasing than 
ever. The prospect is as things now stand, that before four 
years have elapsed, the Union will be divided into two great 
hostile sectional parties. 

But it will be impossible to present such a front, except by 
means of a Convention of the Southern States. That, and 
that only could speak for the whole, and present authorita- 
tively to the North the alternative, which to choose. If such 
a presentation should fail to save the Union, by arresting the 
aggression of the North and causing our rights and the stipu- 
lations of the Constitution in our favour to be respected, it 
would afford proof conclusive that it could not be saved, and 
that nothing was left us, but to save ourselves. Having done 
all we could to save the Union, we would then stand justified 
before God and man to dissolve a partnership which had 
proved inconsistent with our safety, and, of course, distruct- 
ive of the object which mainly induced us to enter into it. 
Viewed in this light, a Convention of the South is an indis- 
pensible means to discharge a great duty we owe to our part- 
ners in the Union; that is, to warn them in the most solemn 
manner that if they do not desist from aggression, and cease 
to disregard our rights and the stipulations of the Constitu- 
tion, the duty we owe to ourselves and our posterity would 
compel us to dissolve forever the partnership with them. 
But should its warning voice fail to save the Union, it would 
in that case prove the most efficient of all means for saving 
ourselves. It would give us the great advantage of enjoying 
the conscious feeling of having done all we could to save it

and thereby free us from all responsibility in reference to it, 
while it would afford the most efficient means of United and 
prompt action, and thereby of meeting the momentous occa- 
sion without confusion or disorder, and with certainty of 
success. 

Thus thinking, my opinion is that the great object to be 
aimed at by the Meeting is to adopt measures to prepare the 
way for a Convention of the Southern States. What they 
should be the Meeting can best decide. It seems to me, how- 
ever, that the organization of our own and the other Southern 
States is an indispensible step and for that and other purposes 
there ought to be an able Committee appointed having its 
center in Charleston, or Columbia, and vested with power to 
take such steps as may be deemed necessary to carry into 
effect that and the other measures which may be adopted by 
the Meeting. 

I agree with you as to a non intercourse with the North in 
commerce and trade. Passing over the objection that it would 
be below the dignity of the occasion, it would be neither pru- 
dent nor efficient, most certainly as preceeding the meeting 
of a Southern Convention.

Fort Hill 15 th June 1849 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER, I do hope by this time, you are all 
safe in London, after a pleasant voyage. I shall be on the 
lookout for a letter dated at London in about two weeks 
from now. 

I wrote to M r Clemson subsequent to the receipt of your 
letter, and addressed to Brussels, where I hope he will find it, 
on his arrival. I stated in it, that I would write you the next 
week, which would have been Sunday last, but when I was 
about commencing to write, Cornelia brought me a letter to 
you, to be put under cover, which I did and forward[ed] to the 
State Department, to be sent by the first opportunity. You 
will probably find it at Brussels on your arrival. Cornelia 
gave you, I doubt not, all the news. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 767 

In consequence of her writing, I postponed my letter for a 
week, which will give it the opportunity to go by the next 
Steamer after that which took yours. 

We all felt, my dear daughter, as you described your feel- 
ings to be, at your departure. It is, indeed, distressing to be 
so far off and for so long a time from those so dear 'to us; but 
let us rather look forward to when we shall again meet, than 
indulge in unavailing sorrows. I trust two years, at the 
utmost, will terminate your residence in Europe, and return 
you all again safe to our country. It is due to the children, 
that your stay should not be longer. Their habits and mode 
of thinking will, by that time, begin to be formed; and it is 
important, that they should be such, as to conform to the 
conditions of the country, which is to be their home. I often 
think of them, and how much delighted they would be, to be 
enjoying themselves in our green and shady yard. The sea- 
son has been wet, and everything looks beautiful. Even the 
old field beyond the yard looks as green as a meadow. In 
the field beyond it, (Speeds field), now containing 125 acres, 
by the addition of clearing, has a fine crop of oats, just fully 
shot out, which completeh r covers the whole ground, present- 
ing an unbroken mass of green in that direction. The big 
bottom on the other side is covered, with a superb crop of 
corn, the best at this season, I ever had on it, which covers 
the whole with a deep green. Back of it, lies fort hill, with 
its harvested wheat in shocks. The spring has been too cool 
and wet for cotton, but mine looks well, and, with my hill 
side drains and serpentine rows, really looks handsome. The 
place is altogether, in fine order. I ride or walk, according 
to the weather twice a day, morning and evening, over it, for 
the double purpose of exercise and superintendence. 1 have 
no trouble, as Fredrick has become a first rate overseer, and 
takes as much interest as I do in everything about the place. 
I would be delighted to have you and the children with me 
occasionally, in my walks. It would be wearisome to take 
them as often as I do. 

My health and strength are as good, as I could expect at 
my time of life. 1 take all necessary care of them, except 
being rather more overtasked, than I could wish. I devote all 
the time left me, to finishing the work, I commenced three

years ago, or more; but which I had to suspend the last two 
years. I ought not to delay its execution any longer, and 
aim to put it to press, if I can finish it in the recess, next 
Spring, or Summer. I finished yesterday, the preliminary 
work, which treats of the elementary principles of the Science 
of Government, except reading it over and making final cor- 
rections, previous to copying and publishing. It takes 125 
pages of large foolscap closely written for me. I am pretty 
well satisfied with its execution. It will be nearly throughout 
new territory; and, I hope, to lay a solid foundation for 
political Science. 1 have written, just as I thought, and told 
the truth without fear, favour, or affection. 

After a few days of relaxation, I shall commence to treat 
of the Government of the United States. It will be more 
than twice as voluminous as the" elementary work, but not 
near so difficult of execution. It will take me four, or five 
months, I suppose. I have got a good deal of it blocked out. 
I should like to read both to you and M r Clemson before I 
publish, and regret that I shall not have the opportunity to 
do so. 1 .

Fort Hill 23 d June 1849 

MY DEAR ANDREW, ... I read the account of your pro- 
ceedings with reference to the Slave question with pleasure. 
Both tone and substance are good. The time is rapidly ap- 
proaching when we shall have to take our stand, and we must 
begin to prepare for it. You see that Benton has openly 
deserted and that he pours out his venom against me. 2 I am 
averse to touching him, and, if his aim had been against me 
exclusively, I would not notice him. But such is not the 
fact. He strikes at the South and its cause through me; and 
I have concluded to repel his attack against myself, to the 
extent that it is necessary to repel it against the South. His 
whole speech is a mass of false statements, illogical conclu-

sions and contradictions. I expect to appear in the Messen- 
ger, in the number succeeding the next. Neither he, or his 
cause will gain anything by the attack. . 

To Andrew Pickens Calhoun. p. AND M. c. 

Fort Hill 24 th July 1849 

MY DEAR ANDREW, ... I sent you a Messenger, contain- 
ing a cop3 r of my communication in reference to Benton's 
Speech. I hope you have received it; and trust it will be 
extensively circulated in the South West. It will be pub- 
lished in all our papers. 

It is high time the South should begin to prepare. I see 
no hope of bringing the North to a sense of justice, but by 
our united action, and for that purpose, a Convention of the 
South is indispensable. To that point our efforts should be 
directed. The first step towards it is to put an end to the old 
party divisions, which might be effected by an understanding 
between a few prominent leaders on both sides, and short and 
well written Articles through the leading presses of both 
parties, showing the folly and danger of continuing our party 
warfare when our existence is at Stake. The next step is an 
organization of all the Southern States as has been done in 
this State. The Convention ought to be held before the 
meeting of Congress, but that, I take it, is impracticable. It 
ought to be called before the Year ends, to meet next summer. 
The call ought to be addressed to the people of the South, 
who are desirous of saving the Union and themselves, if the 
former be possible; but who at the same time are prepared, 
should [the] alternative be forced on us, to resist rather than 
submit. Such a call could not fail to secure a large delega- 
tion from every Southern State, and what is important, a 
harmonious one, on the essential point. The call might be 
made by the members of the Legislatures of one or more 
Southern States, or by the members of Congress from the 
South, when they meet in Washington. The call itself would 
have a powerful effect on Congress. Could not Alabama be 
induced to make the call ? Atlanta would be a good point for 
the meeting. 

I am making good progress in the work I have on hand. I 
have finished the Discourse on the elementary principles of

Gov*. and have made considerable advance in the Discourse 
on our system of Gov*. The work will hit the lines both here 
and in Europe; and, I think, cannot fail to make a deep im- 
pression. I hope to have it completed before I leave home; 
and intend to take it with me to put to press in New York, 
early next year. I would be glad to show it to you and have 
your opinion on it before I publish. . . . 



To Abraham W. Venable. 1 

Fort Hill August 1849 

MY DEAR SIR, I have read your letter with much interest, 
and congratulate you and the great cause on your triumphant 
success. Under all circumstances, it is a great victory for 
both; and shows what can be done by honesty and boldness in 
a good cause. Had the other republican members from the 
state acted with you, the party would have achieved a decided 
victory in the state in the election. Even as it is, much has 
been done to restore it to power. Your position is now a 
commanding one. You are placed by your course and victory 
at the head of the party in the state. North Carolina has long 
stood in need of an able, bold and honest man to take the lead 
in bringfing] the state into her true position. You can do it. 

I am glad to learn your health is good. Mine is as good as 
I could expect, and I trust sufficiently so to take me through 
the next session. It will be an eventful one. We must force 
the issue on the North, so as to know where we are to stand. 
The sooner it is done, the better for all concerned. I wish to 
board on Capitol Hill and near the capitol, and would be glad 
to have you of the Mess, and hope your arrangements will be 
made accordingly. 1 am busily engaged on my work, and 
hope to have it ready for the press before the commencement 
of the session; so that I can take it with me to Washington. 

I hear from Missouri, that Benton's days are numbered. 
Atcheson 2 and Green say, that he has as good a chance to be 
made Pope, as to be elected Senator. 

My kind regards to your Son.

To Duff Green. 1 

Fort Hill 4 th Aug* 1849 

MY DEAR SIR, You are right, as to the source, whence Ben- 
ton draws his support. He has bribed the papers at the seat 
of Government by jobs at the publick expense; and the only 
way to put down the corruption is the one you indicate. An 
Independent Press at Washington has long been a desidera- 
tum, but it is difficult to establish, or to maintain such an one 
there, against the joint influence and power of the publick 
plunderers, who have got possession of the organs of publick 
opinion and the machinery of parties. 

I am glad to learn that your contract promises so well and 
hope it will equal your most sanguine hopes. Should you suc- 
ceed as well as you expect it will give you a commanding 
position. 

With kind respects to M ra Green and your family I remain

Fort Hill 24 th Aug* 1849 

MY DEAR SIR, ... Politically I have nothing good to 
write. The appearance is, that Taylor's administration will 
prove a failure. I fear he is in the hands of the Northern 
Whigs, exclusively. In the meane time, the alienation be- 
tween North and South is daily progressing. Benton and 
Clay are both playing for the North. I enclose in pamphlet 
form my notice of his 2 assault on me. I would have sent it 
earlier, but only received it in that form, a few days since, 
It is, as far as I have heard regarded as triumphant. It is 
said, that he will not be able to sustain himself in Missouri. 
His colleague, Gen 1 Atchison, says he has no chance to be 
reelected. 

We are all anxious about the fate of Hungary, and the 
future condition of Europe. Write me in 3^our next fully, 
what is your impression and the intelligent portion of Europe

in reference to both. If Hungary should be able to maintain 
herself, the condition of Russia will become critical. What 
is to become of Germany and France? . . . 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Fort Hill 14 th Oct r 1849 

MY DEAR ANNA, You and M r Clemson must regard me as 
a very negligent correspondent this season, but you must 
attribute it, not to indifference, nor indolence, but to being 
overtaxed in the way of writing. My correspondence is neces- 
sarily heavy. It occupies one day and sometimes two a week; 
but what mainly occupies me, is the work I have on hand. I 
have written between three and four hundred pages of fools 
cap in the execution of that, since my return from Washing- 
ton; and have, I think, to write about 40 or 50 more before 1 
conclude the work. I will then have to review, to correct 
and finish off, which will require some time; but I hope to be 
able to have it all ready for the press by midsummer. 

It will consist of three parts; a discourse on the elementary 
principles of government; a discourse on the Constitution and 
Government of the United States, and a collection of my 
speeches and other productions on constitutional subjects. It 
will make two moderate size Octavo volumes. I think the 
work is called for by the times, and that it will make an im- 
pression. I have stated my opinions on all points, just as I 
entertain them, without enquiring, or regarding, whether they 
will be popular, or not. Truth is my object, and to that I 
closely adhere. ...

MY DEAR ANDREW, ... I have been making good prog- 
ress in the work I have on hand. I shall finish it, I expect, 
except revising, correcting and copying before I leave home. 
John who has just returned from the North says it is looked 
to with great interest there. His health is much improved, 
and so 1 understand William's is, for he went directly to Co- 
lumbia without returning home, so that I have not seen him. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 773 

Mississippi has acted well on the slave question, 1 and I hope 
Alabama and every other Southern State will back her and send 
delegates to Nashville. It is all important that they should. 
Bad would be our condition, if the Convention should fail for 
want of backing; but bright our prospect should there be a 
full meeting. . . . 



To Herschel V. Johnson. 2 

Fort Hill 1 st Nov. 1849. 

MY DEAR SIR, The enclosed is a speech of M r Meade 8 to his 
constituents, on the slavery question. 

It is able and bold, and I send it as evidence of the increas- 
ing spirit of the old dominion on that vital question. Coin- 
ing from the quarter it does it may contribute something to 
merge party feelings with you and rouse the spirit of your 
legislature. 

I do trust your state will back the Mississippi movement. 
If they should and the other southern states should follow, 1 
feel assured it would do more than anything else to bring the 
question to a speedy issue. It cannot be made too soon for 
us, but I have written you so fully on the subject that to add 
more would be little else than to repeat what I have already 
written. 

With best regards to M rs . J.

health, its contiguity to the Capitol; the bleakness of the walk 
up Capitol Hill in windy weather, and the liability of getting 
heated in walking up it with the heavy clothing necessary to 
guard against a Washington winter, and cooling off too sud- 
denly on throwing off the overcoat, or cloak on reaching the 
Senate Chamber. In all other respects I would greatly prefer 
the location you suggest. I think, taking it altogether, it is 
the most protected and best in Washington. 

If a satisfactory arrangement could be made on the Hill, 
and it should not put Martha to too much inconvenience, I 
would prefer it; but if not, I will join you in the location you 
suggest, or any other contiguous, rather than seperate from 
you and Martha. 

My arrangement is to be in Charleston on the 25 or 26 th 
and to take the Baltimore boat, which I understand will sail 
on the 28 th , and hope to meet you there and go together. 
When we arrive at Washington, we can finally decide on our 
arrangement. 

I concur in your 'suggestion, as to the caucus, with a modi- 
fication; not to go into it with the free soilers; meaning all, 
who will vote for the Wilmot proviso; that is, the whole, or 
nearly the whole of the Northern democrats. To take the 
ground you suggest, not to go in with those who refused to 
sign the address, would I fear tend too strongly to divide the 
South, and throw from us the Kentucky, Missouri and Ten- 
nessee delegations with two or three exceptions. 

All join their love to you and Martha.

Washington 2 d Dec r 1849 

MY DEAR AND W , I had a very pleasant and safe journey on. 
The weather was fine throughout; but is now very bad. It 
snowed during the night, and is now sleeting, with a North 
Easter; so that I was lucky in taking time by the forelock. 
I am now quartered at Hills on Capital Hill for the Session. 

There is much confusion in the ranks of both parties and it 
is thought it will be difficult to elect a Speaker. 1 Winthrop

and Cobb have been nominated by their respective parties; 
and Wilmot by the free soilers. There is a Seism in the ranks 
both of the democrats and the Whigs, as to the Speaker, 
which will be difficult to heal. The session will be one of 
great excitement and confusion. ! . . 



To James H. Hammond. 1 

Washington 7 th Dec r 1849 

MY DEAR SIR, I would regard the failure of the Conven- 
tion, called by Mississippi, to meet, from the want of endorse- 
ment by the other Southern States to be a great, if not fatal 
misfortune. It would be difficult to make another effort to 
rally, and the North would consider it as conclusive evidence 
of our division or indifference to our fate. The moment is 
critical. Events may now be controlled; but, it will be diffi- 
cult, if not impossible to control their course hereafter. This 
is destined to be no ordinary session. We shall need the 
backing of our constituents; and the most effectual we can 
have, would be the endorsement by the other Southern States 
of the Mississippi call. 

I do not think that our state should hold back, and wait for 
the movement of the other states. If we act at all, it must 
be through the members of the Legislature, during the ses- 
sion, and, of course, the movement must be made the next 
few weeks. If we do not move, other states will be backward 
to move. As jealous as they may be of us, they still look to 
us to give the signal. Nor do I think, that we should make 
the meeting depend on the coming of 8, or any other number 
of states. It would, I fear, throw the indifferent against the 
Convention, and tend to defeat it. If the meeting should not 
be full, it would be a good reason for taking no decisive ac- 
tion and for calling another Convention, accompanied by an 
Address to the other States. 

I feel deep solicitude in reference to the subject. With 
the endorsement by the other States of the call, I see my way; 
but without it, I do not. If South Carolina backs it, the 
Convention will meet, but without it, it will almost certainly

fail. I do hope you will concur in these views, and add your 
influence to induce the members of our Legislature to appoint 
delegates. 

No one regretted more than I did the course of the Caro- 
linian in reference to the subject to which you allude. I took 
immediate measures to counteract its ill effect. The disease 
has got beyond the control of presidential influence. As to 
the office, I not only do not desire it, but would not accept it, 
if tendered to me, under existing circumstances. 



To Thomas G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 8 th Dec r 1849 

MY DEAR SIR, . . . Congress has been in Session now for 
four days without being able to elect a speaker. It is uncer- 
tain when one can be elected. The free Soil party holds the 
balance between the two parties, and appears resolved not to 
give away. 

There is every indication, that we shall have a stormy ses- 
sion. There'is no telling what will be the end. The South 
is more united, than I ever knew it to be, and more bold and 
decided. The North must give away, or there will be a 
rupture. 

1 regard the administration, as prostrated. It has proved 
itself feeble every way. . . . 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson* 

Washington, 31 st Dec r , 1849. 

MY DEAR DAUGHTER: Not long after my arrival here I 
wrote to Mr. Clemson and, among other things, requested 
him to say I would write to you shortly. I hope he received 
my letter. 

If I have not written to you as frequently as formerly, foe 
assured that it has not been caused by any abatement of affec- 
tion towards you. It is to be attributed simply to the fact 

1 The text of this letter is derived from a copy kindly furnished by Mr. Hugh Calhoun 
Middleton, of Augusta. 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 777 

that I have been overburthened with writing a species of 
labor, which you know, I have ever been especially averse to. 
I wrote during the recess between 400 and 500 pages of fools- 
cap, besides carrying on an extensive correspondence, which 
I could not avoid. Under so heavy a pressure I left the cor- 
respondence with you almost exclusively to your Mother, 
jCornelia and your brothers. The two former, I know, have 
been very punctual and full in their communications. 

Since my arrival here I have allotted most of my spare time 
to preparing my manuscript for the press. The discourse, 
or disquisition, (for I have not yet named it) on Government 
is finished, and is now copying. It is preliminary to the dis- 
course on the Constitution and Government of the United 
States. That is much more voluminous. The rough draft is 
finished. I propose to devote my spare time during the 
session to preparing it, also, for the press, and hope to have 
it done and copied before Congress adjourns. I do not know 
whether I shall put it to press as soon as finished, or not; but 
I wish to have it off my hands and ready for publication 
whenever I shall judge it advisable to publish. I trust when 
published they will do me no discredit, and that they will do 
much to explode errors and cast light on the subjects of 
which they treat. 

I am truly happy to learn that you are all well, and that 
the children are growing so finely. They must be a source of 
great happiness to you. I know not any employment more 
useful and honorable than that of a wife and a mother super- 
intending her household and the education of her children. 
By education 1 mean something far beyond what is to be 
derived from books. I feel assured that you are discharging 
faithfully these duties and trust you will find your reward in 
the character and conduct of your two very promising chil- 
dren when they come to act their part in life. 

Your Mother and sister have, I suppose, informed you that 
the portraits to which you referred in your letter to me were 
long since received and that they are greatly admired. I 
think them excellent good likenesses and well painted. 
Many think Calhoun's is the best likeness; but I find it diffi- 
cult to decide which is the best 



778 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

1 am glad to learn that the same hand that painted yours 
and the children's has succeeded so well in executing the like- 
ness of myself. I understood from Mr. Henry Gourdin that 
he had made arrangements to get a portrait of me painted by 
the Artist who painted 3^ou, and that it would be in Washing- 
ton this winter. I had supposed it was the likeness to which 
you referred, but conclude that it is another taken by the- 
same artist. 

The question between North and South is daily becoming 
more and more menacing. Tt is difficult to say where it is to 
end. The South is more roused and united than I ever knew 
it to be; and I trust that we shall persist in our resistance 
until the restoration of all our rights, or disunion, one or the 
other, is the consequence. We have borne the wrongs and 
the insults of the North long enough. It is time they should 
cease. 

My health continues as good as I could expect at my time 
of life. All were well when I last heard from home. 

Give iny love to M r . Clemson and the children. 



To James H. Hammond. 1 

Washington 4 th Jan y 1850 

MY DEAR SIR, I have delayed answering your last letter 
until I could write more certainly in reference to the subject 
to which it relates. 

As far as I can judge from indications, I cannot doubt, but 
that the Convention at Nashville will be well attended. The 
members from Virginia speak with confidence, that delegates 
will be appointed by their State. The subject is now before 
a committee and publick sentiment, in the state and legisla- 
ture, is said to be strongly in its favour. The legislature of 
N. Carolina does not meet this winter; but the best informed 
of her members speaks with confidence, that the state is 
roused, and that, at least, there will be a partial representa- 
tion from the state. You can better judge what Georgia will 
do, than I can. The Alabama members say with confidence

their state will appoint, and the Florida that theirs will. So 
say the Arkansas delegation; and M r . Turney, Senator from 
Tennessee, who has just left me, feels confident, that Tennes- 
see will. I have but little information as to what Missouri, 
Kentucky and Louisana will do; but if the others should act, 
it is not improbable they will. Even Maryland begins to 
wake up. Her Governor has come out on the Southern side 
and I have little doubt the State will, from what I hear. 
Everything that can be done will be done here to ensure a full 
attendance. There is already much excitement here and it 
will go on increasing. The debate on the question at issue 
between the South and North will commence early and be 
warm. It is becoming a common opinion, that there is little 
chance of saving the Union. The subject is freely talked 
about and discussed in private circles. It is also becoming a 
prevalent opinion, that the South ought not to remain in the 
Union, without a complete restoration of all her rights, a full 
recognition of our equality [in] every respect, and ample se- 
curity for the future. The contest will not be limited to the 
territorial aspect of the question between us and them. Every 
question will be put in issue, and the question of the Union be 
freely discussed. 

It is contemplated, at the proper time, if it should be 
thought to be necessary, to call on the South to appoint dele- 
gates, so as to be fully represented. Georgia is an important 
state. You can do much there, and I hope you will exert 
yourself, if it should be necessary, to induce her to be repre- 
sented at Nashville. 

As to myself, I lose no opportunity, where I can act with 
propriety, to give the great cause an impulse. I want no re- 
ward, no prominence, or even distinction. If the thing is 
done, I am satisfied, let it be done by whom it may. I have 
made it a point to throw off no one. Let us be one, is my 
advice to all parties at the South. You must not think of 
retiring. The time for action has come. If the South is to 
be saved now is the time. 

The great, pressing, practical question of the session will be 
on the admission of California. I regard it as worse than the 
Wilmot Proviso. What the latter proposes to do openly the 
former is intended to do covertly and fraudulently. It adds

insult to injury. The debate on it will be violent and denun- 
cia[to]ry. We may be voted down, but it will not be done 
without adding fuel to the flame.

Washington 12 th Jan y 1850 

MY DEAR ANDREW, . . . The issue between the South and 
the North is the all absorbing subject here, although one 
would not think so who would judge from the party Organs 
here. They keep silent in the hope of giving such prominence 
to mere party issues, as to divert the publick mind from the 
higher questions and issues. They see in the latter a power 
sufficient to brake up the old party organization, and with it, 
the spoils system. The Southern members are more deter- 
mined and bold than I ever saw them. Many avow them- 
selves to be disunionists, and a still greater number admit, 
that there is little hope of any remedy short of it. In the 
mean time the North show no disposition to desist from ag- 
gression. They now begin to claim the right to abolish slav- 
ery in all the old States, that is those who were original 
members, when the Constitution was adopted. The Session 
will be stormy, but I hope, before it ends, a final and decisive 
issue will be made up with the North. There is no time to 
loose. 

Give my love to Margeret and all the children. Kiss them 
for their grandfather.

MY DEAR SIR, I received yours of the 8 th Jan y . a short time 
before the commencement of my recent illness, of which I 
suppose the papers have informed you. The disease was a 
modified case of the Pneumonia. I have been for the last 
week entirely free from disease; and have so far recovered 
my strength, as to be enablefd] to ride out. I hope to be 
completely restored by the begining of next week to my usual 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 781 

strength. The disease, I think, will leave no permanent ill 
effect behind. I took little medicine and lost no blood. . . . 
The slavery question has at length absorbed the entire 
attention of Congress and the country. The excitement is on 
the increase. Clay has offered what he calls a compromise, 
but will get little support. 1 do not see how the question can 
be settled. 



To Jam** II. 

Washington 16 th Feb: 1850 

MY DEAR SIR, It affords me much pleasure to state, that 
my health is entirely restored and my strength in a great meas- 
ure. I intend to resume my seat in the Senate tomorrow, 
and hope to take part in the debate on the great question of 
the day now pending in the Senate by the end of the week. 
The discussion before it closes will cover the whole issue be- 
tween North and South; and, I trust, it will be of a character 
to satisfy the South, that it cannot with safety remain in the 
Union, as things now stand and that there is little or no pros- 
pect of any change for the better. The tone of the Southern 
Senators, with the exception of Clay, Benton, Houston and a 
few others is high. There is an increasing disposition to re- 
sist all compromises and concessions and to agree to nothing, 
that will not settle the entire issue between the two sections 
on the ground for which we contend. There is, I think, little 
prospect, that the North will come to our terms or that any 
settlement of the questions at issue will be agreed on. That 
I think is the general impression. The impression is now 
very general, and is on the increase, that disunion is the only 
alternative, that is left us. 

I regret greatly to learn, that you cannot take Washington 
on your way to Nashville. I regard it of great importance 
you should, even if your stay should be short. A few days 
would put you in full possession of the state of things here, 
which I regard as very desirable. Without flattery, I know 
no one better informed, than you are, on the great subject 
that now agitates the country, or more capable of deciding

782 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

what should be done, with the knowledge you would acquire 
of the state of things here, or of preparing whatever papers 
the Convention may think proper to put out. It is, indeed, 
highly desirable, that at least two members from each of the 
delegations, should visit Washington on their way to Nash- 
ville, in order to consult freely with the members from the 
South who are true to her. 

I trust you iraiy be induced to reconsider your conclusion. 
The reasons you assigned for it, are, indeed, strong; but they 
cannot be stronger than those in favour of the opposite con- 
clusion. Never before has the South been placed in so trying 
a situation, nor can it ever be placed in one more so. Her all 
is at stake. 



To Mrs. T. G. Clemson. c. c. 

Washington 24 th Feb 1850 

MY DEAE ANNA, . . . Besides my correspondence, which, 
with M r Clemson, extends when from home to nine persons in 
my own family, and when at home usually five or six, I have 
written between 350 and 400 pages of foolscap in execution of 
the work. I have on hand, since we parted, and have reviewed, 
corrected and had coppied the elementary disquisition on gov- 
ernment (now ready for the press) containing 125 pages of 
fools cap. When I add, that I have done all this in the midest 
of a round of compan}^, and my many other engagements, I 
think you will see, that I have a very good excuse, if I have 
not written you as frequently as formerly. 

I answered M r Clemson's last, shortly after I received it. I 
hope he has got my answer. I gave him an account of my 
illness, and the State of my health at the time. My strength 
gradually continued to return, but slowly, until I had so far 
recovered, that I was enabled to take my seat in the Senate 
last monday and hoped to be able to address the Senate on the 
great question, which now absorbs all others, in a few days. 
The next day, the weather was very bad, and I did not go out. 
The day after I found myself in the incepient state of a cold, 
which increased the next, accompanied by a slight fever. I 
have the last three days been free of any febrish symptoms, 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 783 

and my cold is now broke. I cough still a good deal but the 
phlem is loose, and I expectorate freely. It has thrown me 
back a week, but there has been nothing serious about it. I 
do not think it is to be attributed to any exposure, or impru- 
dence on my part, but to the state of the atmosphere. Indeed 
colds are so common as to be almost epidemick. 

I am afraid Patricks health is seriously impaired. He is 
now staying with his brother Andrew, and is much better. I 
hope when the weather gets warm, and settled he will go to 
Fort Hill, and remain there until he gets fully able to join his 
Regiment. A frontier life, away from the pleasures of a city, 
may fully restore him. 

The excitement, in reference to the Slave question continues 
on the increase. I see no prospect of any satisfactory adjust- 
ment of it. You were deceived, if you supposed the South 
gained anything, by the election of Cobb. He was forced on 
us by the Northern democrats, as they call themselves, but free 
soilers as they should be called. They could not be induced 
to rally on any other Southern man ; and the only reason they 
rallied on him was, that he was the least true of all the South- 
ern members, of the South, to the South. Indeed, such is the 
state of things in which we are placed, that it is indispensible 
to the elevation of any Southerner, that he should be false to 
his section. 

I am exceedingly anxious to be heard in the debate now 
going on in the Senate; and as my strength may not be suf- 
ficiently restored in time, I have resolved to write out what I 
intended to say, and have it read, should it not be. 

I am happy to hear that you are all well, and the children 
doing so well. My love to M r Clemson and them, with a kiss 
from grandfather. May God bless you all.

Washington 10 th March 1850 
MY DEAR SIR, I answered Anna's last letter by the last 

steamer; I hope she has received my letter. 

Since then, my health continues to improve and my strength 

is so far returned, that I am able to take my seat in the senate 

and a part in the discussions of the body. 



784 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I send you a copy of my speech on the great question of 
the day. My friends insisted, that I should not undertake to 
deliver it, as it might overtax my strength. In conformity 
to their wishes, I wrote it out and had it read by a friend, I 
being present. 1 It has made a decided impression. Since 
then, M r Webster delivered his views. 2 He took grounds 
more favourable to the South, than M r Clay, but still far 
short of a permanent settlement of the question. His speech, 
however, shows a yielding on the part of the North, and will 
do much to discredit M r Clay and other Southern Senators 
who have offered less favourable terms of settlement. If he 
should be sustained by his constituents and N. England gen- 
erally, it is not improbable, that he will take still stronger 
grounds; and that the question may be adjusted, or patched 
up for the present, to brake out again in a few years. Noth- 
ing short of the terms I propose, can settle it finally and 
permanently. Indeed, it is difficult to see how two peoples 
so different and hostile can exist together in one common 
Union. 

I wrote some time ago to Co 1 Pickens and asked him to in- 
form me, whether the arrangement, which you stated in your 
last letter to place our bond in his hand, had be[en] carried out, 
and whether, if the bond was in his hand, he would feel him- 
self authorised to receive the interest and credit it on the 
bond; and, if the bond was not placed in his hands, to let me 
know, if he knew, in whose hands it was. I have not yet 
heard from him. 

I am happy to say that, I think, neither my late attack, nor 
the prevailing influenza, which I took in my convalescent 
state, and which so much retarded the restoration of my 
health, has left an}?- permanent derangement of my system. 
The weather is now becoming mild, which will permit me to 
take exercise in the open air, and which only is required to a 
full restoration of my strength. 

My love to Anna and the children. Kiss the children for 
their grandfather. 3

Resolutions, March, 1850. ' 

[Resolutions dictated to Joseph A. Scoville by Mr. Calhoun, a few days before his death.] 

Resolved That the States composing the Southern portion 
of the Union cannot be deprived of their full and equal rights 
in the territory acquired from Mexico, or any other belonging 
to the Union without violating the constitution, perpetrating 
an act of gross injustice, destroying their equality as members 
of the Union, and by retarding their growth and accelerating 
that of the States composing the northern portion of the Union, 
destroying the equilibrium of Government. 

Resolved that the assertion that the inhabitants of the terri- 
tories have [blank] ... is utterly destitute of foundation, is 
in derogation of the Sovereignty of the States composing the 
Union to which the territories are declared by the Constitution 
to belong and in whom the sovereignty over them resides is 
revolutionary and anarchical in its character, treasonable in 
its tendency and wholly unsustained by the practice of the 
Government. 

Resolved that to make a constitution and form a State 
involves the highest powers of sovereignty and that it cannot 
of course be rightfully performed by inhabitants residing in 
the territories without the permission of Congress or the rep- 
resentatives of the United States to whom the territories 
belong or in whom the sovereignty over them reside. 

Resolved that the attempt of the inhabitants of California 
to make a Constitution and form a State without the permis- 
sion of Congress is an offence against the joint Sovereignty of 
the States of the Union and that the instrument purporting to 
be the Constitution of California is utterly void and of no 
binding force on the inhabitants thereof, nor on this Govern- 
ment, or the States it represents and the so called State but a 
name without any reality whatever. 

Resolved that all acts on the part of any department of this 
Government or of the Citizens of the U. S. intended to 
encourage, or aid the inhabitants of California to make a 

i This rough draft the editor owes to the kindness of Mr. Edward Spann Hammond, 
of Blackville, S. C., who writes that " Mr. Calhoun dictated it in articulo mortis, expect- 
ing to retouch it on rising from his couch, when he invoked one of his last utterances

on any past occasion in my life.' "

Constitution and form a State (if without the permission of 
Congress there have been such acts) are utterly unauthorized 
by the Constitution and inconsistent with the allegiance due 
to the joint Sovereignty of the States of the Union. 

Resolved that it is not within the Constitutional competency 
of Congress to give validity to the instrument purporting to be 
the Constitution of California (or) and to admit the inhabitants 
of California into the Union as a State under it, because ac- 
cording to the fundamental principles of our system of Gov*. 
Constitutions derive their validity from the people by whom 
and for whom it was [they were] made, and because it would 
[be] inconsistent with and subversive of this principle to act 
on the assumption that Congress could [give] validity to the 
instrument and make it a Constitution by the act of admitting 
of its inhabitants into the Union. 

Resolved that the States of the Southern portion of the 
[Union] are not opposed to the proviso, which usually bears 
the name of its Author, because it bears it but because its aim 
is to deprive the States (South) of their due Share in the ter- 
ritories of the Union, by a palpable violation of the Constitu- 
tion by a total disregard of any principle of justice and equality, 
to be followed if adopted by a subvertion of their equality as 
members of the Union. 

Resolved that any attempt to admit the inhabitants of Cali- 
fornia with the intention to evade the opposition to the proviso 
ought to excite a still more stern and indignant opposition 
because it would accomplish the same thing in a manner more 
objectionable and involve other constitutional objections pecul- 
iar to itself and of a deeper and graver character if possible 
[than] what have been set forth in the preceding resolutions. 

Resolved that they are more objectionable because it would 
effect indirectly and surreptitiously what the proviso proposes 
to effect openly and directly because it would exclude the Said 
States more effectually from said territory by being inserted 
in the instrument purporting to be a Constitution, and what 
would be claimed to be a Con[stitutio]n if Congress should 
endorse [it], than it would be if inserted in the provisions of 
a territorial Gov*., while it would be equally unjust and un- 
fair as if excluded by a constitution of the [illegible] or by act 



LETTERS OF JOHN C. CALHOUN. 787 

of Congress, in as much as the citizens of said States have been 
precluded from emigrating to said territory by the action of 
this Gov*. and thereby of having a voice in the formation of 
said instrument. 

Resolved that the time has arrived when the said States owe 
it to themselves and the other States comprising the Union to 
settle fully and forever all the questions at issue between 
them.

From Virgil Maxcy. 1 c. c. 

Baltimore March 2 nd 1827. 

MY DEAR SIR, ... As I was sure you would take for 
granted, that none of your friends would more sincerely re- 
joice at the triumphant issue of the investigation, 2 I did not 
think it necessary to trouble you with a formal letter of con- 
gratulation. A number of your friends here, who were of 
opinion that you had erred in taking the notice of the affair, 
which you did by an appeal to the house, are now, when they 
reflect upon what might have been the effect, if you had [not] 
taken the step you did, some years hence should you be before 
the nation as a Candidate and when Mix and his infamy would 
be forgotten, if a charge should be made of not having met 
allegations of official misconduct, are now convinced that 
your course was right. 3 The whole affair has undoubtedly 
had a favorable effect as respects yourself. 

I have not yet seen the testimony of the different witnesses 
and should be glad if you have a spare copy if you would 
send me one. I understand however, that a contemptible 
effort is made by General Brown and Jessop to rob you of 
the credit of the reforms which you effected in the War De- 
partment, and to assume it themselves as if indeed it would 
be any discredit to you to collect information from experi- 
enced military men and make use of it in your recommenda- 
tions to congress! I understand however, that these gentle- 
men did neither of them originally make any suggestions 
respecting the great means by which } r ou arrived at such 
perfect organization as you effected, I mean the central Staff 
until after you had made those recommendations and that in 
point of fact Vande Venter, 4 who has been made a victim of

College, Union College, and South Carolina College. He was a prominent politician 
and lawyer in Maryland. He edited the Laws of Maryland, 1811, was Solicitor of the 
Treasury under Jackson, and charg6 des affaires at Brussels under Van Buren. On 
February 28, 1844, he was killed (with Secretaries Upshur and Gilmer and others) by the 
explosion on board the Princeton.

the malice of your enemies for the sole purpose of making 
the impression, that you had been negligent of your duty Jn 
not dismissing him from office, was the first who laid before 
you a project of the Central Staff. I feel a strong sympathy 
for Vande Venter, who, tho' strong in conscious integrity, 
must nevertheless, feel a deep mortification at the impression 
that his abrupt dismissal from office is calculated to make on 
the public mind and I take the liberty of suggesting for 
your consideration, whether you could not with propriety 
punish the vanity and assumption of Gen 1 . Brown and Jessop 
by addressing a letter to Vandeventer, or if you should think 
it better, to me, in which you should state the fact of his 
having laM that project before you and that you had availed 
yourself of Vandeventer's suggestions in your recommenda- 
tions to Congress, before Brown and Jessop had arrived at 
Washington, if this be according to fact, and by this expe- 
dient, while you render yourself a service, render a most 
material one to him, cruelly thrown as he is after 20 years 
faithful public service upon the wide world to seek a new 
occupation for the support of a family already becoming 
numerous and expensive. A statement of his usefulness in 
this respect, as well as in his general services as chief clerk, 
published in the form of an extract of a letter in this city, 
where he has a very extensive circle of connexions by his 
wife's family of the highest respectability, would be most 
soothing to his lacerated feelings, and at the same time most 
useful to him in this city, where it is most likely he will form 
a connexion in mercantile business with a brother of his wife 
and establish himself for the future at the same time, it 
would afford a complete justification to you for retaining him 
in office. It would, without giving them any just reason to 
complain, properly punish and mortify the vanity and selfish- 
ness of Brown and Jessop. 

In my last I wrote you, that we were about to have a Jack- 
son Meeting in Bait , and that it was fixed for Saturday last. 
The inclemency of the weather however prevented its taking 
place that evening and it was postponed till last night, when 
a very full and respectable meeting convened and adopted the 
pre-amble and Resolutions, which you have seen in the papers. 
Mr. M c Kim, who was the Chairman of the Jackson Committee 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 793 

in this city at the late Presidential contest told me this morn- 
ing, he had never during- the whole of the canvass known so 
large a meeting in any public hall as the one last night and 
expressed in emphatic terms his opinion that Jackson is 
stronger here now than he was at the last election : that he is 
in the rest of the state I daily receive evidence. I have little 
doubt that we shall assemble next May, when we propose to 
have the Jackson Convention, as respectable and weighty a set 
of names as the state can afford or has ever been witnessed 
in Maryland. The truth is, that in this state a great Majority 
of the men of a high order of character and intellect, who 
are capable of understanding great principles and are above 
patronage, are for Jackson and take with them a Majority of 
the lower class of people, who are below patronage, while the 
class of middling men, who are incapable of rising to the 
comprehension of great principles and perhaps are looking 
for favours to the government, are for Adams, who is in pos- 
session of the patronage and power. Indeed my confidence 
strengthens daily that we shall soon put an end to the impres- 
sion that has been so industriously circulated by the adminis- 
tration men and presses, that Maryland has gone over to the 
Administration. I am told that you have at Washington 
cheering news from all quarters. Please let me hear of you 
particulars as it may be useful for me to be in possession of 
them. . . .

MY DEAR SIR, The election here has just been terminated. 
I have the largest majority ever given by the county. 

The assemblage of the people afforded an opportunity of 
testing the strength of parties in relation to men and meas- 
ures. Our Cause is identified with the popular sovereignty 
and is triumphant; and nothing is more grateful to my feel- 
ings than the manifest and evident attachment of our people 
to you. 

i John S. Barbour (1790-1855), member of Congress from Virginia from 1825 to 1833. 



794 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

You may have seen the proceedings at our ''Jackson Meet- 
ing", and the strong resolution in reference to yourself. I 
thought it most prudent and judicious not to appear actively 
in the matter. Such meetings are useful only as they embody 
and disclose popular sentiment, and I was unwilling that it 
should have the faintest appearance of deriving impulse from 
me, as it might in that case be attributed to the partialit} r of 
personal friendship or the effect of party feelings brought 
from the Metropolis. I wished it to be as in fact it was, the 
unbiassed expression of the public will. 

With Resp*ful Compliments to M rs . Calhoun I beg you 
accept the assurance of my great Regard and Respect

Washington, April 6, 1829. 

MY DEAR SIR, ... I met with Green (Duff) }^esterday and 
found him evidently in an ill humour with the State of things 
here. He forbodes much mischief from the furious passions 
of his revengeful wife operating on Eaton. Major Lewis, 
who lives in the Presidents house is supposed to have the 
unlimited confidence of the President, reads over letters of 
recommendation &c for him and is a tool of Eaton's , who 
is a tool of his wife. Is it come to this that all our glowing 
anticipations for our country from the integrity, sagacity and 
firmness of Gen 1 . J must be extinguished and we must submit 
to the melancholy conviction, that the U. S. are governed by 
the Pres*. The Pres*. by the Secr y . of War and the latter by 
hisW . . . . 

I remain faithfully yrs, V. MAXCY.

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 795 

From Virgil Maxcy. c. c. 

Tulip Hill, near Annapolis, April 9, 1829. 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you a few days since from Washing- 
ton, respecting the clouds that were gathering over my pros- 
pects. The Report has got out and been carried to Baltimore, 
that I have been proposed for the office of Treasurer. It is 
natural to expect that whatever latent unfriendly feeling may 
from any cause be felt towards me, should now manifest itself. 
That it has done it in some way or other I have very little 
doubt from an inquiry of M r . Ingham, 1 whether Gen. Smith 2 
was friendly to me and a remark, that Maryland was split 
into Adverse interests, and an intimation, that letters from a 
few of the prominent men of the Jackson party in different 
parts of the state, in addition to those already sent to Gen 1 . 
Jackson, might be useful. 

You may recollect that in the old contest, when Crawford, 
Gen. Smith's favorite, was in the field, I had occasion to 
answer some pieces written by Gen. Smith and published in 
the American at Baltimore, attributing to Crawford the merit 
of a number of measures, which you originated such as Spe- 
cific Appropriations &c. Gen. Smith probably found out 
that I was the author. I have never had any respect for him, 
and of course have not paid him the court he might have 
expected. 1 have no doubt therefore he is unfriendly as 
indeed is M r . Lloyd, 3 whom I met in the same way in the An- 
napolis papers. Geo. Winchester is unfriendly, more from 
Jealousy than any other cause. In 1812, he was one of the 
violent men, who after the mob were stimulated by most 
offensive pieces by Hanson in his paper, joined him in the 
Charles Street affair 4 and became exceedingly odious in Balti- 
more. In 1824 to get rid of his unpopularity, he brought him- 
*df forward as the Jackson Electoral Candidate, and by aid 
of the enthusiasm of the people in favor of the old General he 
was elected, but did not so far get rid of his unpopularity as 
to render it safe to take him as the electoral Candidate in 

1 The Secretary of the Treasury.

1828, when the contest was expected to be close and by a good 
deal of delicate and excellent management on the part of 
Taney, 1 he was induced to stand aside and let Col. Howard 2 
be the Candidate and in the late contest 50 others in Bait , 
might be named who spent more time and made greater exer- 
tions than himself. In 1815 he was desirous of being chosen 
a member of the Executive Council and was pushed by his 
friends. Mine, without my knowledge or any desire expressed 
on my part, nominated me, (who was not a favorite of the 
Hanson party) and I was preferred. We were afterwards in 
the Senate together, and I had there on several occasions been 
compelled by a sense of duty to oppose and contribute to 
defeat several unjust speculating projects for opening streets 
and pulling down other peoples houses, for the purpose of 
aiding a company of speculators in City Lots, of which he was 
an active partner. He became dissatisfied with his situation 
in the Senate, where [he] could not have the control and 
resigned his seat. By these things his dislike of me was kept 
alive and increased. In 1825 and 6 I believe I may with truth 
repeat to you, what I know many disinterested persons have 
said that I was the Leader of the House of Delegates, and 
had occasion by opposing several Baltimore projects to incur 
the displeasure of Baltimoreans. After I had at the request 
of Winchester, among others at Baltimore, written the Ad- 
dress for the Jackson Convention, (which I first proposed to 
Taney and got up by persuading him and others into the 
measure in Baltimore), Winchester immediately after that 
Convention was organized and a committee to draft the 
Address was, as usual, appointed, attempted meanly to appro- 
priate to himself in the public opinion, a great part of the 
merit of that Address, by moving Resolutions, to instruct 
the Committee in framing the Address to have in view certain 
principles &c., which principles &c. he had copied almost 
verbatim from the Address, when it was submitted to his 
perusal previously to the meeting of the Convention. And 
after this as I stated in my last letter he brought about con- 
fusion in the Convention by moving to expunge the part, in

which an allusion was made to you. In this state as in several 
others there is in the Legislature a City and a country inter 
est. From the foregoing detail you will perceive, that niy 
strength lies in the country, throughout which in every 
county I have warm friends. My weakness on the contrary 
is in the city, where is concentrated, the force of those, who 
would oppose my advancement'. Friends in the country 
whose dispersion renders it difficult to bring them to act 
together, opposed to enemies in the city, who can easily 
combine, are like undisciplined militia opposed to Regulars 
and 1 suppose I must submit. It is now said that Hughs 1 the 
Son in law of Gen 1 . Smith, who joined the Jackson forces when 
victory was certain is to be raised to the rank of minister to 
act jointly with Preble and perhaps Woodbury, as Commis- 
sioners to argue the boundary question before the King of 
the Netherlands 2 and Winchester, if he does not get the Con- 
sulate at Liverpool, will have a foreign mission offered him. 
If this be the case, the claims of Maryland will be satisfied, 
and I shall be forgotten. When Maryland in 1826 was quietly 
floating down the united corrupt stream of federal and state 
patronage, 1 first roused the attention of the people here to 
the importance of the principles, to the violation of which 
they were yielding without opposition, by my Address to my 
congressional District, in making which I sacrificed a pros- 
pect, as certain as such things can be, of a seat in Congress, 
and by proclaiming openly my opposition to the re-election 
of M r . Adams and the reasons of it brought upon me bitter 
hostility and much reproach. Early in 1827 I brought about 
the Jackson Convention, the earliest state convention in the 
U. S., wrote its address, which was read by every reading 
man in the state, put public sentiment in the right channel, as 
to the principles involved in the contest, and furnished topics 
and arguments to all those, who afterwards came out as Can- 
didates before the people. It was afterwards republished, as 

1 Christopher Hughes was ehargti to the Netherlands; in 1830 he was made charge" to 
Sweden. In 1831 Winchester was made a commissioner under the treaty of f830 with 
Denmark. Maxcy was made Solicitor of the Treasury when that office was created in 
1830. 

2 In reality the United States was represented by Albert Gallatin and William Pitt 
Preble in arguing before the King of the Netherlands the question of our northeastern 
boundary.

you know, in all the states South and West of this, and as it 
was the first address of a State Convention, you can judge 
better than I how far it might have given direction to public 
opinion or roused public attention in other states. 1 

After the contest waxed warm in 1828, by publications in 
the papers, and correspondence I brought about meetings in 
every district for organizing committees. At the request of 
the principal Jackson men, attended those district meetings, 
in more than half of them in our county wrote their resolu- 
tions and addresses, came near being involved in a duel with 
my nearest neighbor, after declining being a candidate as an 
elector and bringing out a Democratic Candidate with Col. 
Howard of Bait, in order to prevent their being two federal 
Candidates, in our double District, I nevertheless at the 
request of the people in each district took upon myself the 
labors of a candidate, after relinquishing its honors, and 
addressed the public meetings and contributed to the expense 
of many of them thro' the county, at the sacrifice of my time 
and attention to my private concerns in the busiest and most 
important season of the } r ear. Most of the above particulars 
I have heretofore mentioned at different times to you. I now 
enumerate them together to refresh your recollection and that 
you ma}r not think me without reason, when 1 say and from a 
consciousness of its truth, boldly say, that no one man- in 
Maryland, I do not except Taney whom I acknowledge to be 
far my superior in reputation, has sacrificed so much or done 
so much and with so much effect to promote the Election of 
General Jackson as I have, and I feel assured, if all the Jack- 
son men in the State who have attended to the course of 
things and I will add all the Adams men (I know their opinion 
by their reproaches) were bound on oath to give their opinion, 
nine in ten of them would confirm my declaration. After 
this, to be put aside and postponed to such men as Winches- 
ter and Hughes, I own stings me to the quick with mortifica- 
tion and chagrin, and stimulates me to use all honorable 

1 Last Summer, after Barry took the field in Kentucky, I was attracted to a speech of 
his, in the Telegraph, by the remarks of the Editor, who extolled it as the best view of 
the principles of the contest that had appeared. The sentiments struck me as familiar 
and before I got thro' it I found the whole frame of the argument and by comparison 
afterwards, nearly one third of the very language of the Speech was taken verbatim 
from the Maryland Jackson Address. Footnote in the original.

efforts with my friends to sustain my pretensions. I con- 
sented in the tirst instance to trouble you to bring them 
forward, because my pecuniary distresses rendered an appoint- 
ment necessary to my relief but this motive for wishing one 
is now strengthened and stimulated by every sentiment of 
pride and suggestion of self protection. I have therefore 
brought my mind to ask of some of the leading men of the 
party in the State according to the suggestion of M r . Ingham 
for letters to General Jackson. This I ought perhaps in jus- 
tice to you and M r . Ingham to do, to shew that your recom- 
mendations are supported by others. Within 12 hours after 
I came to this determination I accidentally met in Washington 
two of the most prominent and respectable men in the lower 
part of the state, one of them, the Jackson Electoral Candidate 
in 1824 the other the same in 1828, for the 1 st Electoral Dis- 
trict. With neither of them had I any personal intimacy but 
upon suggesting my wish to the one of them, with whom I 
was best acquainted, and his communicating it to the other, 
they both immediately came forward, said I had done more 
for the Jackson cause than any one in Maryland and were 
ready to say so to Gen 1 . Jackson. This I requested them not 
to do, but would be glad to have a joint letter from them of 
such a character as they thought proper, without exalting me 
above all others. To shew you that the above statement of 
my services is not an unsupported ebullition of my own 
vanity, I inclose you a copy of their letter. I expect to 
receive a half a dozen others ia a few days, when I shall send 
them to M r . Ingham. I send you the present that you may 
have other authority than my own for any statement you may 
think proper to make to M r . Ingham, if you think you can 
with propriety add any thing to what [they] have already said 
to him, to induce him to put his request to the president for 
the arrangement of M r . Anderson to the Treasury and me to 
the 1 st Comptrollership upon the footing suggested in my let- 
ter of day before yesterday, of personal accommodation to 
himself with a view to the business of his office. Unless M r . 
Ingham will take interest enough in the thing to do this, I do 
not think from the present aspect of things, that I have any 
chance of success. I must beg you not to let M r . Ingham sup-

pose from anything in your letter that I have suggested this 
thing to you. 

I am called suddenly to close my letter for the post and I 
am sure before this you have cried out enough in all conscience. 
Faithfully yours, 

V. MAXCY. 

[P. S.] Could you not frame a letter to M r . Ingharn, in such 
a way as would render it proper for him to show it to Gen 1 . 
Jackson ? 



From Francis W. Pickens. c. c. 

Edgefield C.H. [April 22, 1829]. 

MY DEAR SIR, I was very sorry to know that you had 
passed this place, for I never was more anxious to see you. 
. . . What I wished principally to see you for was to know 
what you thought as to the prospect of the future. For it is 
with the most melancholy feelings that I look on a great and 
gallant people, sacrificed by a government over which they 
have practically at present no restrictive power. 1 believe 
the true checking power of all governments is the power to 
destro}^ them. I believe after a series of years that no gov- 
ernment that has the power to collect taxes and to declare 
war can be restrained but by a display of sufficient power to 
break it up. And in this point of view, we have the advan- 
tage over every other people, in as much as there are regular 
organized and acknowledged authorities, which combine the 
strength of large sections of our whole community, and can 
be brought to act on the central government . . . 
Yours truly 

F. W. PICKENS. 



From Virgil Maxcy. c. c. 

Tulip Hill, near Annapolis, May 7, 1829. 

MY DEAR SIR, ... As 1 was somewhat mistaken, or 

have reason to believe 1 was, in some of the views 1 gave in 

my letters to you- respecting the obstacles in my way, which 

you have received, 1 will now proceed to correct them and to 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 801 

give you the further and more precise information, which I 
collected on a late visit to Baltimore. I task your patience 
in reading the latter the more willingly, because it is con- 
nected with consequences, in which Taney, Gale, 1 and Howard 
consider your interests in this state involved and M r . Gale 
your interests also in Pennsylvania. 

With respect to Major Eaton, I have no means of knowing 
whether I ought to change the impression communicated to 
you or not. In a conversation recently with Towson, he 
expressed an apprehension that he was not friendly to you 
and feels much disgust at the influence he exerts with the 
President thro' Major Lewis, who lives with the Pres*. and 
whom he considers as a tool of Eaton's. Gen 1 . Green, who has 
had a complete blow up with Eaton, is under the same impres- 
sion, and feels the same disgust. He considers Eaton as in- 
triguing and entirely selfish. 

With respect to Winchester, I have no evidence of his hav- 
ing interfered with respect to me and am disposed rather to 
think he has tiot, and as I fear I did injustice in my letter to 
you to his exertions in the late contest, I hasten to correct it 
by saying, that in my late visit to Baltimore I became satis- 
fied that he was muc'h more active than I had been led to be- 
lieve. I have no reason to change iny opinion that he is 
unfriendly to me more from jealousy than any thing, which 
I thought clearly manifested in the proceedings of the Jack- 
son Convention. 

But I have now direct evidence of old Smiths active oppo- 
sition. That you may comprehend more fully his motives, it 
is necessary that you should keep in mind the following facts. 
That the talent and respectability of what was once the fed- 
eral Party in Maryland is with Jackson and friendly to you; 
the majority of that party however went with Adams. 

That directly the reverse of this is true, with respect to the 
Democratic Party, almost all the political managers of this 
party having gone with the late Administration, while a ma- 
jority of the Democratic Voters are with Jackson. 

That a few however of the Democrats, most prominent for 
talent and influence, held aloof till the hardest of the fight

was over, but now claim to be zealous friends of General 
Jackson. These, to a man, were zealous partizans of M r . 
Crawford are now friends to Van Buren and will never for- 
give you. The most conspicuous of these are General Smith, 
M r . Lloyd 1 and John Nelson, of Frederick. I would not be 
understood to intimate, that John Nelson's feelings have car- 
ried him so far as [to] give him a personal dislike to you, 
which I believe is the case with the other two gentlemen. 

You will recollect that I mentioned to you, that M r . Ingham 
gave me some hints of the unfriendliness of General Smith to 
me, by inquiring how we stood to each other, and informing 
me, that John Nelson was supported for Treasurer by him. 
These hints were enough to give direction to my inquiries, 
and I went directly to Taney after I arrived in Bait . He 
informed me that he had a few days before been informed by 
a friend of Nelson, that the latter had received a letter from 
General Smith proposing to him to become a candidate for 
the Office of Treasurer of the U. S. and urged it upon him 
upon the ground that Maxcy and Winchester (naming us two) 
and other conspicuous federalists would run away with all 
the honors of the new state of things in Maryland, if some of 
the old democratic party did not step forward. Nelson de- 
clined becoming a candidate. General Smith however wrote 
him a second letter and he consented, so that it is now reduced 
to certainty, that Nelson has, contrary to his inclination, lent 
himself as an instrument to old Smith to defeat me. The 
object of both however was deeper than appears on the sur- 
face, as you will presently perceive. I believe I have here- 
tofore put you in possession of Gen 1 . Smith's political history 
for the last few years but I will now give it more fully from 
Taney, who has been on the spot and knows more in detail 
than I. Nelson's you are probably not aware of so fully 
that I will give you also from Taney, who till the last three 
3^ears lived in Frederick, where Nelson resides and of course 
knows his political course since he left there, particularly 
from his numerous friends in Frederick. 

Since the election of M r . Adams, Gen 1 . Smith authorized 
his friends to assure the Adams Members of the Legislature 

1 Presumably Edward Lloyd, president of the state senate. John Nelson, M. C. 1821-1823, 
was afterward charge to Naples as attorney-general. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 803 

that he was a friend to his Administration. This was done 
and had the effect to insure his election as Senator in 1826. 
Altho' not entirely trusted by the Adams party, all set him 
down as belonging to it till the celebration of the battle of 
North point on the 12 th Sep*. 1827, five months after the Jack- 
son Convention in Maryland was held and published their 
address. A few days before this celebration an old demo- 
cratic friend of the Adams party, James L. Hawkins, met 
Gen 1 . Smith in the street and after a good deal of conversation 
with him, remarked to a friend, that Gen 1 . Smith was to be 
relied upon as a friend of the Administration (Adams). Gen. 
Smith however attended the Jackson celebration of the 12 th 
Sept r . The day after Hawkins met him on the street and 
asked him how he could attempt to deceive him in the conver- 
sation a few days before. The Gen 1 , replied he had not de- 
ceived him, and that he attended the oration in commemora- 
tion of the battle of the 12 th as an invited Guest, being invited 
as a revoltionary officer and the Commander of the Militia of 
Baltimore at the period in question and not as a partizan of 
Jackson's. From that time to the late electoral Election, 
Taney informs me, that he attended no Jackson Meeting 
made no speech and held no public conversation by which 
it could be inferred that he was on Jackson's side. In a word, 
he gave not even the slight countenance of his name, where 
it would have had weight with a few in the hard and doubt- 
ful struggles of last fall in Baltimore: neither did he assist 
as far as we know, the Adams party. His neutrality and 
false pretences in private to both, however, lost him the con- 
fidence of all sides. It is understood' however, that after the 
election was over he went to Washington as a full blooded 
Jackson man, naturally gained the confidence as such, of the 
unsuspecting old chieftain, between whom and himself there 
were some points of sympathy both being old men both 
old soldiers and Smith holding himself out as the Jackson 
Senator from Maryland. He has been remarkably attentive to 
Gen 1 . Jackson represented to him, that Howard and Taney 
and such men, as were busily engaged as electioneered, were 
obliged to give recommendations to all who asked them, 
thereby insinuating that his representations only were to be 
relied on, has obtained (This Towson told me) more influence 



804 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

with Gen' 1 . Jackson than any man from Maryland, and has 
used it to the manifest annoyance of M r . Ingham in the Cus- 
tom house appointments at Bait . So that he now begins to 
be looked up to as the dispenser of the patronage of the gov- 
ernment, for the state of Maryland. 

He himself is Senator of the U. S. 

He contrived last winter to get his Son, who is very un- 
popular into the State Senate. 

He has got his nephew Dabney Carr appointed Naval Offi- 
cer the best office at Baltimore. 

He has got Lyde Goodwin, who was bred in his counting 
house appointed Appraiser. 

Capt. Gault, formerly a sea Captain in his service, inspector. 

His son in law Hughes Charge and wants to raise him to 
the rank of minister. 

How many other appointments he has an interest in amongst 
those of a lower grade I know not. 

He now goes out of the city and volunteers in soliciting a 
Crawford Democrat, who had no inclination for the Office, to 
be a Candidate for the App*. of Treasurer of the U. S. in order 
to defeat me. 

Now the striking feature about all this business is, that 
every single person that I have enumerated, was at the last 
election a warm partizan of Crawford. 

I would not be understood as objecting to all of these ap- 
pointments. On the contrary Lyde Goodwin has been a true 
man, active and zealous and was supported by everybody as 
a suitable app*. I only make the list out complete to show 
the number of friends of Gen 1 . Smith and Crawford in the best 
offices in Bait . 

One only of the better sort of offices in the Custom House 
is in a different sort of Hands that of Surveyor, to which 
Col. Mosher an uniform democrat and most respectable man 
was recommended warmly by Taney and Howard. 

All the foregoing officers are without exception of the old 
Democratic party, and except one or two of the tide waiters, 
who were not particularly recommended by Taney and Howard, 
and for whom they felt no interest, none of the new appoint- 
ments in the custom house has been given to federalists. Of 
this no complaint is made. Neither Taney nor Howard 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 805 

dreamed that the Jackson party was composed of Fed sts . and 
Dem ts . The distinction has sunk and they have divorced them- 
selves from the majority of the Federalists, had forgotten the 
old distinctions and were in good faith active as members of 
the Jackson party, " one and indivisible.*' . . . 

The truth of the matter is this, the people in their late ardu- 
ous struggle entirely forgot old distinctions and naturally 
placed the men of talents, who sympathized in their feelings 
and views at their head without inquiring whether they were 
federalists or democrats. These leading men generally in 
Maryland have been federalists. Hence Taney was appointed 
by the Jackson convention the Chairman of the Central Com- 
mittee for Maryland, they having agreed at his suggestion on 
account of his feeble health to give him an active assistant as 
vice President in Col. Mosher, a most respectable democrat. 
They would have made Taney President of the Jackson Con- 
vention, but he insisted on their taking old General Forman, 
a Democrat from the eastern shore. 

Now that the storm has been weathered and the ship safely 
got to port in Maryland under officers, who were federalists 
they are to be thrown overboard, at the cry of interested men, 
like that treacherous old hypocrite Smith and some others, 
who find themselves overshadowed. 

When Van Buren passed thro' Baltimore he was closeted 
two or three Hours with old Smith and saw no one else. . . . 

These are the three leading men, 1 who now range themselves 
on the side of Jackson, who were formerly of the Democratic 
party and came in as Crawford Men on calculation and never 
have sympathized with us in the support of the true principles 
of the contest, and they would now be glad, under the guize 
of democracy to rally the state under Van Buren. 

There is however as yet not the slightest symptom of divi- 
sion as far as I can learn in the Jackson Ranks in the country 
between federalists and democrats, who have now so often 
and so hard fought side by side against Adams federalists and 
Democrats, that they have entirely forgotten the old distinc- 
tions but to revive these old distinctions is the only means 
by which Old Smith can make his delinquencies be forgotten. 

1 Smith, Nelson, and Lloyd. 



806 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

We are now on the eve of a great struggle for the State. 
The Adams forces are perfectly organized. Bait , has but two 
out of 80 delegates to the Assembly and division there is of 
little consequence but Taney, Howard, and Winchester all 
unite with me in the Opinion, that if Smith's efforts succeed 
and division is carried to the Country, the State is lost to 
Jackson and if by possibility a majority should notwithstand 
ing be got and Smith and Lloyd and Nelson get up again, the 
State will then be thrown into Van Buren's arms. 

I have thus given you a full but tedious account of the state 
of things in Maryland or rather in Baltimore, that you may 
understand our position, and may in such way as occasion 
may offer aid the . operation of setting things to rights. I 
fear our friend Ingham's mind coming from the party atmos- 
phere of Penns a . where the old distinctions have been kept up, 
is not quite free enough from local impressions to judge quite 
impartially of affairs in Maryland. With him you may be of 
service. I think however his eyes are open as to Smith and 
Taney and Howard are taking steps to open the eyes of the 
President to Gen 1 . Smith's true character and conduct. . . . 

As to Pennsylvania politics M r . Gale boarded last winter 
in a Mess with Gen 1 . Barnard and a number of the Pennsyl- 
vanians, not very friendly to M r . Ingham. He thinks from 
what he saw that the nomination of Wolf 1 as Governor in 
preference to Barnard, will not be submitted to but that an 
opposition Convention will be got up and a new nomination 
made, in which case there will be a split of the Jackson party, 
and the Adams party will take the side opposed to Ingham 
and give it a majority. Wolf I understand is friendly to 
Ingham and yourself. Gale tells me farther that he is in the 
habit of taking excursions for health into different parts of 
Pennsylvania in the Summer that he is acquainted with the 
leading federalists that there are about 40,000 federal votes 
in Penns a . and that most of them are for you.. Now if the 
split apprehended should take place and the proscribing lan- 
guage be used towards federalists, which is customary in 
Penn a . will it not have a tendency to alienate these federal 
votes from Ingham and you and give a Majority to your

opponents ? Gale is a sagacious man and I throw out these 
hints for }^our consideration. . . . 

Since writing the above, I have received a Telegraph which 
contains an account of a meeting being called near Pittsburgh 
in conformity with the recommendation of another in Chester 
County near Philadelphia of Jacksons friends, who are also 
friends of the "American System", to denounce the nomina- 
tion of Wolf as Gov r . as being your friend and to call a new 
Convention of Jacksonians to nominate a Candidate for Gov- 
ernour opposed to John C. Calhoun: this movement seems 
strikingly to confirm Gale's view of things in Penn a . . . .

Mr DEAR SIR. I owe you many apologies for not previ-

some delay was forwarded to me from Charleston, and even 
now I must throw myself on your indulgence as I am on the 
eve of sal ing (tomorrow) for New York with my family. 
This last cause will prevent my going to Pendleton this Spring 
which I had fully intended to have done, but unfortunately I 
found no friend going in the Ship in which it was necessary 
for Mrs. Hamilton to embark with whom I could have intrusted 
my family, hence it has become necessary for me to sail with 
them. We shall probably return by Land, and make our 
calculations to reach your hospitable mansion about the last 
of Oct. I shall devote the summer to our Pendleton Lyceum 
with the hope of consummating the arrangements necessary 
for its establishment. I will thank you to exercise all possi- 
ble reserve in even hinting the name of Mr. Cogswell 2 as the

person I am looking to as its head, as such a rumor would 
not fail to injure his present institution. 

Having said so much in relation to an object near my heart 
permit me to say one word in relation to another which 1 am 
endeavoring to cast from it as fast as possible Politicks. 
What think you of the recent appointments ? I fear the old 
Gentleman is pushing the Figure too far. I cannot under- 
stand the true key to them, whether they are under the influ- 
ence of Van Buren Ingham or Eaton. The metropolitan ap- 
pointments I suspect very strongly are to be referred to the 
back stair influence of the latter. I feel a painful regret in 
the consciousness of the career which Circumstances may 
compel you to run in competition for an office, which in the 
present Confederacy it seems can not be won with pride or 
held with consolations of personal happiness. 

I had a very unexpected tho' most gratifying visit from 
M c Duffie on his way to Charleston. I am delighted to find 
that Miss Singleton 1 has at last smiled and will soon bless him. 

Some business in Washington in regard to live oak timber 
will carry me on there after my arrival in New York. I pre- 
sume I shall reach the City about the 1 st June. If anything 
should occur whilst there which I think will be interesting to 
you 1 will write you. My address will be Northampton Mass.

people can practically have the power to restrain government, 
unless they have within themselves sufficient power to destroy 
it, I do not mean to say that they must of course exercise 
that dreadful power. No government can be restrained un- 
less those who control its operations habitually feel that those 
upon whom it acts can at any moment stop it. Public opinion 
itself can have little or no influence in a series of years, un- 
less it be created and supported by those who have real 
positive power. Government is real positive power, and 
nothing but an equal real positive power can restrain it. The 
real constitutions of all governments have been the result of 
positive power. A written constitution is nothing unless the 
people have actual power to enforce it. My idea as regards 
our present condition is not "revolutionary." It is that we 
not only have at present power to destroy our government, 
but we fortunately have power to restrain it without destroy- 
ing it. What other people have heretofore wanted in re- 
straining government, namely system and combination, we 
have through our organized state authorities. But I hold 
that there can be but very little practical eifect produced by 
any thing short of a display of real power. 

Whatever may be said about our Constitution, I think in 
reality we can hardly be said to have a constitution yet. 

The real constitution of any Government is that govern- 
ment in action. We are now called upon to make a constitu- 
tion to our government in one of its most important 
operations, the collection of taxes. And it is all important 
we should make it compatible with the perfect protection of 
property. If we as a people have power to fortify our liber- 
ties against the operations of our government, we will make 
the constitution of the government, if we have not, those who 
administer it will make the constitution. I have the most 
perfect confidence in the opinion that we have the full power, 
and that we will exercise it, and without revolution. And 
that we will finally make this one of the strongest govern- 
ments in the world, and at the same time entirely harmless to 
the liberties of the people. 

1 should not at this time have troubled you with this ex- 
planation if I had not felt myself misunderstood. . . . 
Yours sincerely, 

F. PICKENS.

Tulip Hill, near Annapolis, June 1, 1829. 
Mr DEAR SIR, . . . He 1 satisfied me from the perfectly 
frank and cordial manner in which he spoke of his great obli- 
gations to and regard for you, that notwithstanding all his 
great appointments seem to be given to a certain class of 
politicians, yet that he has not bestowed them with a view to 
favour M r . V. B. He alluded to you and M r . V. B. being 
held up as [aiming ?] at the same station and avowed his deter- 
mination to act with impartiality. In the sincerity of this 
declaration, I place implicit reliance and attribute his appar- 
ently departing from the rule he has prescribed to himself as 
only a proof of the adroitness which has been used in making 
impressions on his mind, that have led to what those, who do 
not know him, believe to be indicative of inclining to favor 
Mr. V. B. who has great advantages in being constantly 
near him. Indeed everything that passed between me and 
the Pres*. on the day I dined with him and two other inter- 
views to which he invited me, have confirmed all my previous 
impressions of the purity, singleminedness, elevation and be- 
nevolence of his character. . . . 

Faithfully V. MAXCY. 



From Virgil Maxcy. c. c. 

Tulip Hill, July 4, 1829. 

MY DEAR SIR, Your letter of the 21 st June has just reached 
me. I had been intending for the last 4 or 5 days to write 
you in compliance with a wish of M r . Ingham, whom I saw 
last Sunday at Washington, where private business had called 
me the day before. A very unpleasant state of things has 
arisen between him and General Green, which he was desirous 
you should be acquainted with, but about which he felt reluc- 
tant to write. It appears that M r . I. gave some small jobs of 
printing to a Pennsylvania Printer, who lives at Washington, 
named Myers, and that afterwards M 1 . Barry, the Postmaster 
General, did the same Green says, on M r . Ps recommenda- 

1 President Jackson. 



LETTEBS TO JOHN C. OALHOUN. 811 

tion, but this M r . I. says was not so. Green says he has the 
authority of Barry and as M r . I. denies it, says he is deter- 
mined to get it from Barry in writing. The truth probably 
is, that Barry employed Myers from the example of M r . 
Ingham and used some expression in apology to Green, (for 
between them also there has been some difficulty,) from which 
the latter inferred a recommendation by M r . I. Under this 
impression, G. wrote a sharp letter to M r . I. when he was 
in Pennsylvania, which provoked a Retort of the same char- 
acter. G. afterwards wrote a letter of apology, which M r . I. 
never received. He has however thro' D r . Jones made him 
acquainted with it. G. told me (for he as well as M r . I. vol- 
unteered in giving me his view of the case,) it was not the 
amount of the job given to Myers which he considered, but 
the disposition it indicated of neglect towards one who had 
involved himself deeply in debt in support of the cause. 
Green was much dissatisfied previously at M r . I's appointing 
M r . Dickins, (an old Crawford man and now as he says, de- 
voted to V. Buren) his chief clerk and pretty freely remon- 
strated against the appointment, and thinks M r . I. does not 
take a sufficiently decided Stand in preventing the great ap- 
pointments taking the same course (tt out of 5 of the foreign 
ministers, who have received appointments under this Admin- 
istration being old Crawford men and the 5th (Moore) orig- 
inally a friend of Cla} r and not one, yours,) and thereby 
making an impression on the public, that M r . V. B. is the 
favored man as Jackson's successor. In the case of Dickins, 
M r . I. cut the matter short by plainly intimating that he would 
not be interfered with in the appointments in his own depart- 
ment. Green has lately in his paper made some remarks upon 
this appointment which will no doubt attract your notice, 
which have deeply wounded and offended M r . I. Green 
complains that his enemies are promoted and his friends neg- 
lected. M r . I. says he assumes a great deal too much, is very 
unreasonable and would, if he could, dictate every appoint- 
ment under the government, that he has been gratified in too 
many of his wishes already in relation to appointments and 
that most of those which have displeased the public and ex- 
posed the Administration to reproach were made to gratify 
him: that he has no discretion; that his paper instead of being 



812 AMEKICAK HISTOEICAL ASSOCIATION. 

a repertory of essays to prepare public opinion for the 
changes in policy which the new Adm n . will adopt is occupied 
in squabbles with editors of opposition prints: and is alto- 
gether unfit to .be considered the Government paper. G. says 
that that paper has been devoted as much to the advancement 
of M r . Ingham as any other individual, Gen 1 Jackson excepted 
and Mr. I. says he came to Washington at the risk of his life, 
such was the feeble state of his health, to vote for G. as 
Printer to Congress. Such is the state of things between 
them, as given by each of them respectively. As both of 
them had volunteered in giving me the history of their dis- 
satisfaction, I was in hopes to have had it in my power, es- 
pecially as each professed to have kind wishes for the other, 
to contribute to the restoration of things to a better state, and 
continued at Washington a day longer than I intended for the 
purpose. My efforts however were apparently fruitless 
tho' they may perhaps have an effect after a little time has 
elapsed and excitement has diminished. 

I fear that this difference may have mischievous conse- 
quences, and I have therefore been minute in detail, that you 
may judge whether you can interfere with propriety or advan- 
tage. 

Gen. Green has now had a difference more or less decided 
either about appointments or printing, with each of the heads 
of department and was near one with Gen 1 Jackson himself. 
This circumstance together with others coming under my own 
observation lead my mind to the conclusion, that Gen. Green, 
tho' he has high claims to attention, has interfered too much 
and in an ungracious manner. Most assuredly I think enough 
has been done to satisfy a reasonable person in the way of 
appointments of friends and some of them have laid the Admn. 
open to reproach. How far he has reason to complain on the 
score of patronage being given to other printers, I am not 
able to judge. M r . I. says the jobs he has given to Myers who 
is poor, were inconsiderable. At all events G's public attack 
upon him in the Telegraph on this account and the appoint- 
ment of Dickins appear to me to be altogether unjustifiable, 
and looks like an attempt to coerce M r . I. to submit. It has 
so deeply offended and wounded him, that I fear there will be 
more difficulty in appeasing him than G. The latter avers he 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 813 

meant the publication as a defence of himself against charges 
of a dictatorial influence with the government and not an 
attack upon M r . I. I acquainted M r . I. with this disavowal. 
He gives no credit to it however and thinks the matter lies 
much deeper than this and that G. is endeavoring to establish 
a control over the departments by appealing to the fears of 
the heads of them and thinks notwithstanding the attach- 
ment he has always professed for you he would attack you 
without hesitation, if you should cross his path. I have seen 
enough of G. to believe he is a man of pretty violent temper; 
but, 1 apprehend, he is more placable than M r . I. when he is 
once much provoked. You however know them both better 
than I do. Green called to see M r . I. two or three times after 
his return from Penn a but did not find him at home. This 
was before the offensive piece appeared in the Telegraph. 
M r . I. had taken no notice of his calls but he was not then 
aware that Green had written him a letter in apology of the 
sharp one he wrote on hearing Ingham had recommended 
Barry to employ Myers in job printing. And now the publi- 
cation in the Telegraph interposes an obstacle to the renewal 
of friendly intercourse. 

And now, altho I think in the business above detailed, G is 
decidedly in fault, yet I must say, that I think with G. that 
M r . I. does not take a sufficiently decided stand to secure an 
impartial distribution of the Offices. I infer this, not only 
from the fact that a very undue proportion of the important 
ones have been given to men of the old Crawford Party, now 
supposed to be friendly to V. Buren, but from an observation 
he has several times made to me, that he thought it his duty 
to be the adviser of the President, when consulted, rather than 
to become the advocate of Candidates for office, by recom- 
mending them beforehand, and that this is the best mode of 
preserving his influence with him. As a general rule perhaps 
this is the best but surrounded as Gen 1 . Jackson is by persons 
who have none of this delicacy, and liable, as the impression 
now seems to be, to yield to the solicitations of friends and to 
be governed too much by his personal feelings towards can- 
didates, rather than by political considerations, the rigid ad- 
herence to this rule seems to be out of place in the actual 
circumstances in which he M r . I. is placed. I believe thePres*. 



814 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

wishes to be impartial between you and V. B. but from the 
fact that your friends have received none of the conspicuous 
appointments since Ingham's own, and that V. B.'s have ob- 
tained many more than all the original Jackson Men and your 
friends together, the impression certainly is made upon many 
people at Washington, that the Pres*. leans to V. B. and is 
giving such a course to things as will advance his future 
views. Should the apprehension that is felt that the vacancy, 
which it is supposed will happen from the return of Poinsett 
the only one of the foreign Ministers friendly to you, will also 
be filled by a friend of V. B's be well founded, this impres- 
sion will be confirmed. But as you may suppose, that my 
representations respecting M r . I's inertness may be erroneous 
from feeling that I have myself suffered by it, I do not like 
to say much upon this subject nor wish you to take my opinion. 
Col. Towson, however, who is disinterested, is so strongly un- 
der the impression, that the current of appointments having 
taken the course it has, is owing to M r . I's want of decision 
and activity, that he told me he felt it his duty and had made 
up his mind to speak freely with him about the necessity of 
his resisting it. He goes so far in this opinion as to think with 
Green that he ought not to have given Dickins the place of his 
chief clerk. On this subject M r . I. has convinced me that in 
this instance he was right. 

I have thus given you a full view of the difficulties between, 
Tngham and Green. I cannot help thinking, tho both appear 
to be obstinate, that both desire a reconciliation. To effect 
this requires a friend of both parties with more authority 
than I possess and you can judge better than I whether 
it is proper or expedient for you to exert a mediatorial in- 
fluence. . . . 

Faithfully, V. MAXCY.

ply with the requests contained in my communication of a 
previous date was of no consequence, as it seems the office of 
Secretary for the Territory was filled before the application 
of any Individuals from this quarter could be submitted to 
the Executive of the U States. I regret it, not that the 
Person appointed 1 may not be very meretorious and fully 
equal to the duties of the station to which advanced, but that 
the people of this Territory, like the citizens of the States 
generally, feel very sensitive on the subject of having their 
public officers sent from abroad. It brings more home to 
them their colonial condition, and increases that restlessness 
which too many of them manifest on that subject. In the 
early organisation of our government These appointments 
from abroad were unavoidable, but since the increase of our 
strength by a population that would not lose in character and 
intelligence, by a comparason with that of older communities; 
it would be more gratifying to have those who are to admin- 
ister our laws and protect our rights selected from those who 
are acquainted with our wants and resources. There is 
another subject which has likewise given much dissatisfaction 
to a very respectable, though limited portion of our popula- 
tion; That is the neglect of the old inhabitants in all the ap- 
pointments made among us. It was bad policy not at once, by 
a proper confidence in their ability and patriotism, to have 
early convinced them that they had been received into the 
American family. You will excuse my enlarging on these 
topics; 1 have done so, that if concurring in opinion with me, 
you may lend your influence to have the qualifications and 
character of applicants from the Territory weighed in the 
same scale with those from other quarters. 

I thank you for the flattering expressions of your wishes in 
relation to my political prospects. You may be assured that 
neither myself or friends are dispirited. We are contending 
for principle in the triumph of which we have every con- 
fidence. Indeed the day would have been with us at the late 
conflict; but for a manoeuvre to split the votes by a third 
candidate, and for the appeal made at the last moment to the 
good, I should say in political affairs [the] weak, feelings of a

community by the present incumbent. 1 His character was at 
stake and he threw himself upon the humanity of his con- 
stituents to save him from the odium which the loss of elec- 
tion would render inevitable. A sufficient number were 
operated on to turn the scale; [and] send him back to Wash- 
ington the representative of a minority of the People of

It would afford me pleasure to hear often from you and I 
would esteem it as a favor if during the session of Congress 
you would forward me copies of all public documents that 
would be interesting. The Reports of the Heads of Depart-

Silver Bluff 9 th Feb 1840 

MY DEAR SIR : 1 have never been at a loss for sound reasons 
to justify your course during the political fluctations of the 
last two or three years. The various constructions placed 
upon it by your opponents have not for a moment imposed 
upon me. The only anxiety 1 have felt was to know precisely 
what you had done and how far you had gone. When these 
points were correctly ascertained, I have always found you to 
be where I expected and in my judgment where you should be. 
If I had felt any great uneasiness from the late rumours and 
any fear that you were committing yourself to the extent re- 
ported, your letter would have afforded me ample relief. To 
many who look back a few years it may appear strange to see 
you acting with the Democratic Party. But they are super- 
ficial observers. Your I may say our alliance with the 
Whigs for I was on the field then was merely accidental 
and wholly temporary. There was more [in] common between 
us and the Democrats, than between us and the Whigs. The 
latter are the successors of the great Federal and anti Southern

Party and had hardly any tie in common with us, except that 
of opposition to the high handed measures of one man. He 
has passed away, and although we cannot all at once rush into 
the arms of his immediate friends, the advisers, supporters 
and beneficiaries of his obnoxious measures, still the bond of 
union with the other party is dissolved and we are left free to 
adopt independant opinions upon all questions: to hold the 
balance if we can, and to incline it if we choose towards our 
ancient friends. Time which blunts the deepest injuries should 
be allowed certainly to soften political asperities and if it may 
not soon restore perfect confidence, it will certainly justify a 
renewal of the ordinary courtesies of society. These opinions 
I entertained when I was at Washington as strongly as I do 
now, and few things in relation to individuals at least, have 
occurred which I did not then in some measure anticipate. I 
do not know that my opinion of any single individual in public 
life has undergone a shade of change, except as regards M r . Van 
Buren, and I must confess he has grown upon me every way. 
I think more of his abilities and certainly more of his moral 
qualities. Still he has not as yet my entire confidence. 
Between him and Harrison or Clay I do not think I should 
have ever hesitated even at the last election. To most of his 
leading measures I have given a most hearty approval. In fact 
I have found little to disapprove. Yet being a Proclamation 
and Force bill man, I do not think it would become South 
Carolina, or the men most conspicuous in the support of her 
doctrines at that day, to give a devoted, unreserved, undis- 
criminating adhesion to his administration. It would not look 
well in history. A fair and honest support of his just meas- 
ures could not compromise us, nor will it give him the vote 
of the state if it is at all likely that any man liable to the same 
objections, and far more removed from us in general political 
principles may succeed in consequence of throwing our vote 
away. 

The reform of the Government to which you have devoted 
yourself so long, I almost dispair of. Circumstances conspire 
to render this the most favourable moment for it, certainly 
since my recollection. If you can succeed in establishing any 
thing like a permanence for the balance of power which you 
now hold, it may be done. Whether the next election will

enable you to do it or not, you can much better judge than I 
can. I fear the decided preponderance of either party, should 
be glad to see them balanced forever pretty much as they are 
in this congress. 

You say nothing of your health I trust it is entirely 
restored. I lost much in not being able to converse freely 
and at large with you last summer as I wished to do. I wish 
I could promise myself a visit to Pendleton this summer but 
I fear my business will carry me in a different direction. In 
the meantime an occasional letter denoting the passing changes 
if not too much trouble to you -would be highly acceptable.

Silver Bluff 29 th April. 1840 

MY DEAR SIR: I did not receive your letter of the 2 nd ins* 
until a few days ago owing to its being in the newspaper bag 
I presume. It is perfectly true as you say that in consequence 
of the fortunate organisation of our State Constitution we 
have been in the main freed from local parties. But perfect 
harmony is not the lot of any body politic however organised, 
for it is inconsistent with the nature of man. We have been 
agitated as much as any other state by divisions having refer- 
ence to Federal politics and I see no reason to suppose we 
shall be soon exempt from them. The great question of State 
rights and consolidation has divided us from the foundation 
of the Government to the present day, under various names 
and must continue to do so. The last conflict between the 
friends of these two doctrines under the names of nullifiers 
and Union men, resulted in such a complete overthrow of the 
latter as to produce the nearest possible approach to Unanim- 
ity that men are capable of. The excitement of the contest 
over, the triumphant party being too large to hold together 
under ordinary circumstances divided. The minority taking

advantage of every division have gradually risen into sufficient 
strength to contend again for the supremacy. They profess 
no change in any of their past opinions, but on the contrary 
claim every new accession of strength and atribute [it] to the 
soundness of their principles, and the other patrons of the 
Union almost unanimously concur in the same view of it. 
This is I think our real situation. And the contest now for the 
Executive chair is neither more or less than a struggle between 
State Rights and consolidation for ascendency in S. C. I know 
very well that the Union men profess to be States Rights men 
and repudiate consolidation and that the great part} r to which 
they belong do. So they all did in thirty two- three, with equal 
vehemence, when the Force Bill was passed and preparations 
made to coerce the State with arms. Professions are one 
thing principles another and our party has recognized the 
distinction all along by declaring war upon or at least keeping 
aloof from those who were loudest in proclaiming their devo- 
tion to state Rights as explained by the Proclamation. I am 
not one of those who push any matter to unnecessary extremes. 
I never have pushed party warfare beyond the limits which 
principle rigidly demanded. In the present instance, hoping 
that it would not be necessary for the continued triumph of 
our principles to unseal the fountains of bitterness, I have 
exhorted my friends not to answer the violent articles of our 
opponents and have held back articles already written untill I 
fear I have endangered our cause. But I do not believe that 
it is in my power were I ever so much disposed, or in any man 
to dry those fountains up. The Union and nullification par- 
ties bear relations to each other that have not existed between 
any two parties in our Country since the revolution. They 
have stood opposed in arms. And prepared to shed each 
others blood, the one for, the other against their native State 
in a struggle for all she held dear nay for her very existence. 
The Union men carried the matter to the very last and black- 
est die of treason. They invited a foreign enemy to our shore 
and received arms and commission at their hands. These 
things can never be forgotten. The mass of those two parties 
can never exist together except as the conquered and the 
conquerors. And were the present elections submitted to a 
popular vote, no man doubts that I should solely, on the 



820 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ground of principle carry an overwhelming majority over the 
combined vote of my opponents. 

Whatever the leaders of our party may do at the present 
moment every body knows that the Union party will adhere 
together as one man and support either of the Union candi- 
dates in preference to a nullifier. There will be Union men 
in the Legislature from States Rights districts who will not go 
with them. But they will otherwise pretty unanimously go 
for either of their Candidates rather than for me for the 
obvious purpose of putting their party in power. The only 
effect then of endeavouring to produce a pacification now will 
be to disband our party and surrender ourselves an easy prey 
to them. There could not be a more effectual way to aid Col 
Richardson's election than to urge this measure. In fact it is 
the only possible way in which he can be elected. I throw 
mere personal claims in which Judge Johnson is vastly 
superior to both of us, entirely out of the question. Col R's 
election however will be but the first consequence that will 
[follow] surrender of our power. Judge J. will certainly 
succeed him. Indeed I am not at all sure that if the pretended 
pacification is effected he will not beat Col. R. He is, it is 
pretty well understood, the favourite of the Union party and 
I believe more palitable to the milliners, who if they can swal- 
low his unrepudiated Union doctrines and Union measures 
will not strain at his disavowed Bank and Clay propensities. 
The general impression is however that Col R can divide our 
party more than Judge J., and on that account he is pushed. 
At the next election we will not be considered at all and the 
Union men will indulge themselves to the full. The vacancy 
for the Senate will be filled by Judge Hug[h]es. This is a 
thing they have much at heart and Elmore Rhett and the 
whole host of nullifiers who have been designated for the 
office will be disappointed. I could name candidates for all 
the probable vacancies to come. A most thorough revolution 
in our State will occur beyond doubt. 

But the consequences are by no means to stop here. Situ- 
ated as we now are our State commands the respect and the 
admiration of the> whole Union and by her gallant struggle in 
thirty two-three has laid the foundation of a renown which 
must go on increasing forever while she faithfully adheres to 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 821 

the glorious principle for which she fought. This has given 
her immense influence, not in the elections of the federal Gov- 
ernment, where numbers only count, but over its measures. 
An influence worth more than all the official honours of the 
government, which can only be maintained by a lofty and 
uncompromising devotion to principle and which will be 
speedily lost by any other course. At the next session of the 
Legislature we shall be called on to vote for M r V Buren for 
President. A Proclamation and Force Bill man whom we have 
covered with every opprobious epithet our language could 
afford. It is a bitter pill. His professions are fair and for 
nearly four years his conduct has been nearly unexceptiona- 
ble, but more far more than this he is in every way more 
nearly allied to us in principle than his opponent and we may 
justify at least excuse ourselves on the ground that he is a 
choice of evils. Still we shall not escape without some abate- 
ment of admiration and of influence of the kind we most 
desire. But if at the very same session we should here at 
home abandon those who have been with us in every difficulty 
and are yet with us in every principle, to vote for another 
Proclamation and Force Bill man for Governor of So Car. 
who has actively supported every measure of his party and 
recants nothing now, how can we expect to retain the high 
station we hold in the Union. We shall be scoffed and sneered 
at from one end of it to the other. We shall be charged with 
not only surrendering our doctrines but of endeavouring to 
obliterate every trace of them in order to purchase favours 
from abroad. The influence of 5. C. such as it may be will 
no longer rest on the exalted ground of uncorruptable devo- 
tion to her principles, but to the paltry estimate of her numer- 
ical strength in the confederacy, and that influence trifling as 
it must be will be swept away entirely from the old State 
Rights Party. And more than this these scoffs and these 
charges will be incorporated in history and handed down to 
our posterity. Since the last war the event which must fig- 
ure incomparably the most in our annals is the nullification of 
S. C. Do what we may hereafter the reputation of our State 
and of her rulers for the time yourself the foremost of them, 
is identified with it beyond the power of fate to seperate them.

own hands in the page of history that in seven short years so 
unsound had it proved and so odious had it become that we 
voluntarily renounced it and sought to banish it from the 
memory of man by the most humiliating exhibitions of repent- 
ance. If our principles were so odious and we ever doubted 
they were sound, situated as we are we might be well justified 
in cherishing their ascendency in our stronghold here. But 
believing as we do that they are the great principles on which 
the foundations of our government repose and by which alone 
civil liberty can be preserved, ought we not to pause and pon- 
der deeply ere we surrender that ascendency their only 
chance of final triumph. 

You very justly remark that we are now to carry out the 
fruits of our noble achievement of thirty two-three. And 
with the prospect ahead for the agitation of the tariff war and 
other questions, it seems to me that every care should be 
taken that S. C. should be shorn of none of her moral influ- 
ence much less called on to defend inconsistency and her 
integrity. Yet how can we expect to carry out our great 
achievement by placing in power at home as well as abroad 
the very men over whom the glorious victory was gained ? or 
how to escape the heaviest reproaches for such an uncalled for 
and extraordinary course. It is true that, each party march- 
ing on its line of direction, we have met in the support of one 
important measure. If that measure constituted the very 
essence of all our differences there is no reason why we should 
at once invest our opponents with the cheif command, not 
only in the federal, but State Government. But every body 
knows that important as that measure is, and the principles 
which it involves, it involves none of a tithe of the magnitude 
of those which have divided us. There is no telling at what 
moment we shall seperate again soon we must. The next 
days march will place us as far apart as ever. Your experi- 
ence will no doubt furnish you with many instances of the 
fatal consequences of putting trust in these accidental and 
temporary conjunctions of opponents. Confidence too wan- 
tonly lavished is despised and will be certainly betrayed. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C.. CALHOUN. 823 

In touching on this subject I cannot refrain from saying 
what I think even at the hazard of appearing to magnify the 
contest and myself and of wishing to draw you into it. I 
fear to make any more professions that such is not my aim, 
or the personal indifference I feel about this or any other 
office. To time, the only true expounder of events, I leave 
the matter.

May 4, 1840 

MY DEAR SIR .... Circumstances had placed us in alliance 
(connection rather) with the Democratic party of the country, 
tho' we professed at the same time to be of a higher school of 
democracy, one of fixed principle and incompatible faith. 
We had not only come to their assistance in the hour of peril 
and gallantly rescued them from certain ruin, altho' we had 
long been the object of their peculiar venom, but to prove 
the sincerity with which we acted towards them, had pro- 
posed to relax our past policy and instead of throwing away 
the vote of S. C. as usual, to give it to their leader for the 
Presidency. This was doing a great deal. More than they 
would have done for us more than they could have had the 
boldness to ask of us. It was doing enough. To place their 
men in power every where, to unite with them thoroughly and 
as a party in all their measures, was to obliterate all the lines of 
distinction so carefully drawn and identif} 7 ourselves with the 
great rabble of democracy and be swept away in the common 
current. The Democratic party are notoriously fickle and 
their leaders for the most part treacherous. These are the 
failings which prevent them from controling the world at 
once and forever. When the next change of measures, the 
next tergeversation of men occurred what were we to do? 
We could not draw off our forces and form them again where 
we stood before. It would be like "calling spirits from the 
vasty deep." They would not come. No man could expect to 
see men marched and countermarched in this way to meet 
every turn of policy or even principle. The leader who does

must often find himself without followers. It would take 
years to form another band such as had been thus thought- 
lessly dissolved and all the time we should have been flounder- 
ing along in the impure current of corrupt democracy. 

Every President that we have yet had has devoted his last 
term to the election of his successor. So will M r V B beyond 
a doubt. I have as little doubt that we shall be called on to 
oppose his selection and that the greater part of the next five 
years we shall be in opposition. He is now playing for us 
because we are necessary to him. We shall not be necessary 
to, but in the way of his nominee, and a very different game 
will be played after his re-election. But how would we be 
prepared to oppose him if we surrendered^ our citadel to his 
Subalterns and disbanded our forces ? On what ground could 
we rally? Whom summon to our standard? We should be 
disarmed, dispersed, and powerless. Our principles dishon- 
oured, our chiefs corrupted or forgotten. . . . 



From J. II. Hammond. 1 

31 May 1840 

MY DEAR SIR I am almost ashamed to continue any further 
the discussion of the question connected with Gov. election, 
altho' I have made as little mention of myself as possible and 
examined the matter precisely as I would have done had some 
other person occupied my position, still I am aware that 
everything I urge 'will be naturally aud perhaps justly sus- 
pected of a bias towards my own interest and would therefore 
come with more force from any other person than myself. 
Having been led on by your friendly appreciation of my views 
and motives to speak very freely and fully to you, I. feel that 
it is in some sort due to myself to reply to some points in 
your last letter. You seem to think that I am for reviving 
the old party distinctions and bringing them to bear in 
the present election. I have perhaps not been sufficiently 
explicit on this point. I do not wish to revive but merely to

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 825 

maintain the old party distinctions as they have existed up to 
the present moment. M} T object is purely conservation. I do 
not think that sound policy any more than good taste require 
we should agitate the State Rights doctrines at this time. But 
I do think that both require us, as does every consideration 
of past association and future prosperity, to maintain their 
ascendency in S. C. quietly but freely and undoubtedly. There 
are periods in the career of parties as in the lives of men, 
when they should rest on their position, and wait for events 
to come up to them. Parties as" well as men must inevitably 
fail if forever in action. But at these periods of respite Care 
must be taken that no ground is lost. That what we have 
won is amply maintained and converted in[to] a base for fur- 
ther operations at the proper juncture. If we waver or 
retreat we have done and suffered for nothing but if we take 
another step and when convinced that it is an unpropitious 
period to press our fortunes from the mere love of excitement 
or habit of action, we enlist in the cause of our opponents and 
press theirs, we commit suicide at once. My object has been 
to explain to you my conviction, that while we could repose 
safely on the ground which the State Rights party has won, 
to vote for M r V. B. would be barely not a retreat while to 
elect Col Richardson would be a clear case of felo de se. 
There is some jumble of figures here but I think you cannot 
now mistake my idea. 

You say you doubt the practicability and expedienc} 7 of 
drawing and maintaining the party lines of 1832. If my views 
are correct the question of practicability and expediency be- 
long to the other side of the argument. Is it practicable to 
break down the lines which it is now for the first time at- 
tempted to do? They ask the change; they should prove that 
it can be done and will prove beneficial. Up to this period 
these lines have been uniformly prescribed. No Union man 
has yet been elected to any prominent office. I do not remem- 
ber a single office in the gift of the Legislature which has yet 
been filled by an union. 1 do not believe they have yet offered 
a candidate for a high office. They would not have ventured 
to offer one for Gov. or if thev had he would have been 
rejected of course but for the intrigue on the part of the nul- 
lifiers themselves to surrender the State into their hands as I

verily believe and as I generally believed for ulterior purposes 
at home and abroad. As to the expediency of this amalgama- 
tion, this one sided peace as it would prove, I have already 
expressed myself very fully to you and every days observa- 
tion and reflection confirms my views. There are two courses 
for men parties, corporations or any identical political bodies 
however designated, to pursue in public affairs. One is to 
trust to the attachment of friends without reward and to 
endeavour to obtain success by conciliating and purchasing 
opponents. The other is to ciierish friends, to adhere to old 
associations, to nurse the cause and its supporters thro' good 
and thro evil report and to look for triumph from the good- 
ness of the cause and the unwavering fidelity with which it is 
maintained. The first course, not to go back further in history, 
was strongly illustrated by the Stuarts. This example should 
be enough. They fell ultimately in the cause of the Catholic 
religion and yet the Pope himself is said to have favoured the 
expulsion of James the second, so inconsistent and vascillating 
had the adoption of the maxim of his family made him. George 
the first on the other hand threw himself entirely into the hands 
of the Whigs, and the house of Brunswick could never have 
established itself on the English throne but for the firmness and 
fidelity with which the two first Georges adhered to their own 
party. In our own Country the two Adams have rewarded 
their opponents by allowing them to hold offices; both of them 
fell in a single term, while Jefferson and Jackson who took 
care of their friends and left their enemies to take care of 
themselves, became founders of dynasties. What but a deep 
conviction of the wisdom of this course could induce M r . 
\ 7 . B. who is profound in the knowledge of human nature, 
to appoint that miserable creature Niles to the office of Post 
Master General. The fidelity of men to parties and to one 
another, has in it under all circumstances something in it that 
meets the universal approval of mankind and is the foundation 
of individual success; of all triumph of principles. What has 
destro}^ed M r . Clay but that, trusting to his position in the 
West and with the South, he has ever been aiming to form an 
unnatural alliance with the North, until he has at length, as a 
public man, lost the confidence of all, and but for his personal 
qualities, his private fidelity to friends, would have sunk ere this 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 827 

into universal execration. The State Rights party of which you 
have so long been the head, rests all its hopes of ultimate suc- 
cess upon its unblenching and eternal faith, a faith which may 
sometimes blaze into enthusiasm, but must never subside so 
far as to be doubted by others, much less by ourselves. This 
is the worldly armour of a good cause, and it is in vain to look 
for triumph without its use. Events do not always follow 
closely upon causes. Erect, undaunted, firmly maintaining the 
ground that we have won, let us bide our time. If impatient 
of success we seek for foreign allies, divide ourselves and fall 
into the ranks upon whose standard victory seems to have 
perched himself, the triumph is not for our day. To other 
times and other hands it must be left, while we shall have only 
the consciousness of having done and suffered much for a noble 
cause and at last betrayed it for want of the highest degree of 
moral courage. 

You say you are not disposed to merge our party in the two 
great parties of the day. I am sure you are sincere. Yet 
how is it possible to avoid it if we throw ourselves into the 
contest for M r Van Buren as there seems to be a disposition 
to do and as tfie Union Party (or the portion of them which 
is supposed to act with us) is resolved to do and at the same 
time surrender the helm of State to a man whose whole public 
career has been strictly partisan and opposed to us. I do not 
think there is another candid man in S. C. who will express a 
doubt that the election of Col R under the circumstances 
would be a complete and thorough merging of our party for- 
ever. He does not come into our ranks or claim promotion 
as one of us. But distinctly demands it as an allied leader on 
the ground that the two parties have been merged into each 
other. It is so universally understood. It is so universally 
talked of. And I think any interpretation of the proposal as 
amounting to any thing else would be warmly repudiated by 
them who made it the State Rights friends of Col R. The 
common sense may not always be the correct one, but is very 
difficult to alter or get over it when wrong and in this case I 
must say I think it is right. And were I to pursue public life 
with a view to personal success, I should in the case of Col 
R's election regulate my course precisely as if the State Rights 
party were extinct and its principles in abeyance for our day. 



828 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

For to S. C. it is looked to maintain them. If she falters 
others fly. If she yields all is over. Our taking such a part 
in the Presidential election as merely to vote will I know be 
regarded abroad as a merger of our party. But if we main- 
tain ourselves in it at home, and give that vote coldly, we can 
when the storm is over, easily rectify our standing. At least 
we can do it, I believe. I cannot tell how easily. I am willing 
to incur that risk, if it is thought advisable, tho as to our 
being considered " impracticable" and all that if we do not 
do, would [not] influence my opinion. It is too late to con- 
sider that. We took our course long ago and have borne the 
odium. To change it now without sufficient reason would but 
increase that odium, by putting the seal of our own reproba- 
tion on our conduct. 



From Duff Green. 1 

Baltimore Aug. 21 st . 1840 

DEAR SIR It is no longer possible for you to mistake the 
signs of the times. I have given you too many proofs of nry 
affection, I will not say friendship, for you to doubt my desire 
to serve you. Had you been advised by me in 1831 you 
would have been the Candidate in opposition to Gen 1 Jackson 
and elected and the country saved the misery and the disgrace 
which followed. Had you been advised by me you would 
have been at the head of the present movement and at this 
moment the most popular man in the United states. It is yet 
my desire to serve you and if you give me your confidence, 
and improve on my suggestions it will yet be in your power 
to trample over your enemies and serve your Country. I 
enclose you a letter to Col. Chas. S Todd, Gen Harrison's 
confidential friend. Harrison understands Clay. He will be 
pressed by so many who want office that he will be glad to 
fall back on you if you and your friends act discreetly from 
this forward. The Editor of the Mercury and the papers 
most friendly to you ought to moderate their tone towards 
him, and the result will be that before Harrison's [election]

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 829 

the asperity of the present canvas will be gone and you will 
have recovered even with many of the Whig party your 
popularity. For you the election of Harrison opens the 
brightest prospects you have ever had. If the SubTreasury 
bill is not repealed, at the next session, Harrison will rejoice 
at your coming to his aid to sustain him by a prudent use of 
the Government Credit and you can rally strength in the 
present congress to keep things as they are. It will be diffi- 
cult to repeal the bill and Harrison will have no desire to take 
up the bank question. He will prefer the use of the Go\ rt . 
credit and you will find aid in quarters that you do not expect, 
if you put yourself at the head of that movement. As to the 
hard money movement that is at an end. 

I have much better opportunities of judging of your posi- 
tion and true interest than any of those who give you other 
advice. It is useless to speak of the past. We must look to 
the future. I do not believe that YanBuren will recieve a 
single vote unless you are mad enough to give him the vote 
of South Carolina, but I cannot believe that 3 7 ou will commit 
suicide as this would be.

From J. H. Howard. 1 c. c. 

Columbus Ga Octr 27 th 41 

MY DEAR SIR I reed your letter a few days ago and con- 
cur with you fully in the opinion that our candidate for the 
Presidency should be selected from the Southern wing of the 
Party, if we expect a full restoration of the Power of the con- 
stitution. I believe also that so soon as the subject is agitated, 
that it is indispensible to the success of our views that we 
should be upon the alert and present our claims in advance of 
any other; but I hope it may be in the Power of those who 
with you have the great interests of the country more at heart 
than the elevation of any particular individual to the chief 
magistracy to postpone for a time the Public consideration of 

J Maj. J. H. Howard, of Columbus, was one of the most prominent supporters of Cal- 
houn in Georgia.

this important question. Although I am fearful that your 
apprehensions are too well founded and that it may be diffi- 
cult if not impracticable to prevent this matter from being 
pressed upon the country, yet if it can be avoided my judge- 
ment approves the postponement, not only because the peace 
and quiet of the country should be consulted by a relaxation 
from party excitement which the stability of the government 
demands, but that the Whigs, now beaten and on the retreat, 
may not be ready to rally by the accession of some of our 
disappointed corps whose defection might be developed the 
moment that they discovered by a nomination that their claims 
were likely to be overlooked. I fear also that the present 
incumbent now playing for, and somewhat expecting the sup- 
port of the democracy, would change his policy and throw 
himself entirely into the arms of the opposition by which they 
would be enabled to establish their Bank and through its 
power and corruptions together with the aid of the spoilsmen 
of both parties greatly increase the difficulty of ejecting them 
from office. If our friends could abstain from the agitation 
of the question until we have a decisive majority in congress 
rendering us independent of the President upon the Subject 
of the Bank a selection might then be made without encoun- 
tering so much danger; ours is rather a fickle people and 
though the indications show the popular voice to be now 
in our favor the defections occasioned by the disappointment 
of personal expectation added to the instability of our exec- 
utive would greatly weaken our present flattering pros- 
pects; if however the consideration of this- subject cannot 
be averted we have no alternative, we must move simul- 
taneously at least, but in advance if possible of any other 
branch of democratic party and though we may fail of suc- 
cess, such movement will have the effect of rallying a strong 
and honest division of the party to keep in check those 
who though democrats themselves may yet not be regarded 
as thorough as ourselves. Now for the man. The claims of 
the present incumbent even if he should henceforth act with 
us which cannot be anticipated from his previous unsettled 
and ever varying policy, cannot be recognized for a moment; 
he has no qualification in my estimation which considered 
with the utmost liberalitv can recommend him to the favora- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 831 

ble consideration of a sound politician. There need be no 
apprehension that in any event any respectable number or 
section of the democratic party will divide from us in his 
favor, but still it is necessary to insure our final aid, that we 
(the democratic) should so deport ourselves towards him as to 
prevent his reunion with the whigs. When we become inde- 
pendent of his action by our majority which we anticipate at 
the next election, we may let him know that he has nothing 
to expect from us. In relation to M r Van Burens claims I 
have but a word to say. That he is my second choice and I 
think the second choice of the people of the South, and if we 
could not succeed in securing your nomination which we would 
prefer it would be better to risk his prospects before Johnson 
or Benton or any other expectant. I am persuaded that he 
will act with a proper regard for himself and friends by with- 
holding his name unless there existed more unanimity in 
bringing him again forward than can be again expected. We 
should if possible conciliate him as he is not only entitled to 
our sympathy and friendship but he has much in his power 
and can if he will turn the scale in our favor. This brings me 
to the manner in which our movement should be made. I 
would prefer that we should have no convention for the pur- 
pose but that M r Van Buren if he can be brought into our 
interest together with your friends in New York, should make 
it through the legislature in that State; in the event of a fail- 
ure there, 'then in Pennsylvania or Virginia provided it can 
be effected in either of them. We could I think with ease 
bring you forward by Georgia and I hope with perfect satis- 
faction and great unanimity of the party. I shall know better 
what can be done next week, but your nomination would 
carry more influence if made by either of the States before 
mentioned. Georgia or Alabama either had better take the 
lead than that your own state should be the first to express 
her preference; You have my views in all candour with the 
assurance that I desire such direction given to the matter, as 
will ensure the success of our purpose, and if it be necessary 
to attain that end, that we should move earlier than 1 have 
thought prudent. Dont because I have expressed my opinion, 
be the less free in the expression of your judgment in relation 
to the best policy. I have communicated with but two per-

sons, who both concur with me. I shall take your letter to 
.me to Millidgeville and show it to a few friends. I go to- 
morrow night. Since I have without reserve given } T OU the 
result of my reflections fully and freely, I hope you will not 
allow any motives of delicacy on account of the position you 
occupy to prevent you from communicating as freely and as 
candidly, though you may differ with me upon every point. I 
therefore request of you to give me as candidly your opinion 
of the time when our action should commence the manner of 
that action and the State in which it should be made. You 
may do this without restraint as none but fast friends shall 
have access to your communication and none but men of great 
prudence.

Athens G a Nov. 15 th 1841. 

MY DEAR SIR I have just arrived at homefromMilledgeville, 
and finding it entirely out of my power to visit you before 
your departure for Washington, I proceed to give you the 
prospect of the result of the late change in publick opinion in 
regard to publick men and measures. 

I have been at Milledgeville 8 or 10 days, have had free and 
full intercourse with my political friends, (in and out of the 
Legislature) from every part of the State and I flatter my- 
self that a patriotic and prudent spirit pervades the ranks of 
the Democratic party, and that a wise use will be made of the 
power recently gained. . . . 

From the present aspect of affairs, there would seem to be 
no grounds for the slightest apprehension, that any prominent 
Whig of the present day, could ever become a special favor- 
ite with the people of Georgia. Clay is now obnoxious to all. 
Tyler has the confidence of but few, and the only hope of the 
spoils men, is the differences which may hereafter probably 
arise in the Republican ranks Especially upon the question of 
the succession of the Presidency at the end of the present term. 

1 See Calhoun's letter of December 26, 1841, in Part I, supra, and the footnote on 
Lumpkin. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 833 

This question has not }^et been openly 'discussed in Georgia, 
yet it is deeply agitated in the publick mind, and therefore 
comes into conversational discussion in every private Circle 
amongst political friends. 

After the most extensive intercourse with our friends, and 
taking into view every consideration, it is the opinion of 
Howard, Black, Cooper and the whole Circle of your most 
devoted friends (including myself) that the time has not yet 
arrived for a general and publick agitation of the Presidential 
question. It is thought that the events of the approaching 
Session of Congress will afford developments, and exhibit 
publick sentiment, so as to give the most appropriate direc- 
tion, in connection with this great and important movement. 
It is here proper for me to state, that I am now convinced 
that the larger portion of the Republican Party in Georgia, 
who investigate such subjects, are disposed to concentrate on 
you as their rallying point for the next Presidenc}- . Yet, it 
is due to candor and frankness for me to state, that many of 
our friends, from their associations, and relative positions, 
have been looking in other directions. Therefore, it requires 
some time and great prudence, to conduct a matter of so much 
delicacy and deep interest. 

Your friends however, are now fulty alive to this subject. 
They will see that no advantage shall be unduly taken to mis- 
direct the publick mind, and should the time for a general and 
open movement arrive sooner than is now expected, they will 
not suffer themselves to be taken by surprize. 

Col. Howard shewed me your letter to him. Your last to 
me, I have shewn to no one but spoke of our correspond- 
ence, and suggested such of your views as I deemed to be 
proper to communicate to your friends omitting every thing 
that I thought was best to remain with myself alone. In 
conversation I have used many of the ideas and views con- 
tained in your last letter, adopting them as my own, without 
naming you at all, and I am pleased to have it in my power 
to state to you, that your general views, both in regard to 
men and measures, coincide with the great body of the patri- 
otic Republican party. We are tired of selecting men for 
high Office, merely as available candidates. We go for cor-

rect principles and ability to sustain our principles. Patri- 
otism in preference to Party ism. We see the evils which 
always accompany restorations. We believe that half way 
measures, will never produce the reform which we desire. We 
are in favor of Radical, Constitutional reform. To do less 
we believe will accomplish no permanent good. 

As we cant have personal interviews, it might be well to 
correspond as fully and freely as time will allow. I promise 
faithfully to perform my share of the Correspondence. 

I will keep you advised of passing events here.

From Jno. A. Stuart. c. c. 

Charleston Nov 19, 1841 

DEAK SIR I have perhaps too long deferred answering 
your last letter, and to make sure that this reaches you I 
address it first to Columbia to be forwarded if you are not 
there. 

M r . Rhett arrived a week after I received your letter and 
we had a full conversation with Col. Elmore, 1 who promised 
to write you but has been since so incessantly occupied with 
business that I find he has not done so. 1 also shewed your 
letter to some eight or ten others of our friends here, and 
have conversed very generally with the party here on the 
subject. 

M r . Rhett said he had a full conversation on the subject 
with you at Washington and has not since altered his views, 
and they are very much the same as those expressed by all 
your friends here. 

All agree that we ought to rally for our principles upon 
some man who represents them fully, and that you are that 
man; and that when the proper time comes South Carolina 
will move for you en masse. There is no possibility of our 
being disappointed in this. No man of influence will dare 
resist the movement, for such man must have the intelligence 
to know that such resistance would crush him. But all agree 

1 Franklin H. Elmore. See his letter of November 2, 1842, post. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 835 

that for this State to move now in a nomination would be 
ruinous. It would be as bad as to effect as if the nomination 
came from yourself or your immediate family. For such is 
the relation in which abroad the State and yourself are 
regarded; and such in fact is the feeling of our State, a feel- 
ing which no local division or internal State quarrel can 
impair. From similar considerations a nomination by Ala- 
bama would be scarce less objectionable. Georgia would be 
better, and a nomination thence would be a cheering symptom 
that old wounds were healed, but even that is too close home. 
A nomination from Virginia would come with great effect, 
but from Ohio, Maine or New Hampshire, if made undoubt- 
edly by the majority of the Republicans of such state would 
be better than from any Southern State. Perhaps from one 
of these remote points a nomination can scarcely come too soon. 
But I should regret to see it hurried anywhere. . Certainly 
it would do harm if made before the close of the Session of 
Congress at hand. I count upon every day of that session 
strengthening your already strong position. Your very posi- 
tion is virtually the most imposing nomination, without the 
disadvantages of a formal nomination. 

To j^ou as the acknowledged leader of the Democratic party 
must redound the credit of each of its coming triumphs in 
Congress. The longer therefore we keep together those 
whom your nomination might alienate, the better for our 
cause. While they fight with us harmoniously they are in 
fact fighting for and under you. You will have the advantage 
of fighting as an assailant all the while; not thrown upon the 
defensive and your moral power weakened by your being 
regarded as an open and avowed aspirant to the presidency, 
not giving ground to be accused therefore of having personal 
objects, and uncommitted to the defence of M r Tyler and his 
party who will yet be compelled by the necessities of their 
weakness to work for us, and to come under our banner not 
to be leaders, but as fugitives seeking protection. Delay then 
must strengthen you, and I believe the close of the session 
will find you the acknowledged candidate of the Democrats in 
Congress, and a few months after of the party in general. I 
would not hazard retarding the progress of our cause, by too 
soon defying the sectional and personal jealousies which even 



836 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

under the most favorable circumstances we must prepare to 
encounter. Let us keep them out of the field until our division 
of the party is so strong as to compel those who would avail 
themselves of such jealousies to be quiet for their own 
sake. When it is felt that the entire South almost is united 
upon you, as I anticipate it will be, and that every day is 
strengthening you at the North (as I am told by several intel- 
ligent men recently from the North) Democratic aspirants in 
that quarter will be cowed, and rally upon us. My wish 
may be father to the thought but I do think that we shall 
carry the party. 

As to M r Tyler, there is no danger of his drawing off any 
of the Democrats, and those but a very few of the spoils- 
men. In his timid subserviency to his Whig friends he has 
diminished his patronage fund, and as to taking him up on 
principle, he has not the respect or confidence of anybody 
in our ranks. I consider him out of the question. A man so 
evidently in the market, with principles for sale, can never 
rally a great party, or one even respectable. He will find 
this out in three months. 

M r Van Buren is more formidable. The triumph of the 
principles for which he suffered has given him a high place in 
the regard of the party; but he must see that another term 
could hardly add to his laurels, and might tarnish them, that 
to be reelected 1 by acclamation would be a proud thing, but a 
mere reelection * not worth his risking a defeat for. His being 
coldly received now will discourage him: and a strong oppo- 
sition from our side of the House drive him from the field. 
He will not risk a defeat. This being brought forward 
early will weaken him. It will be attributed to mere love of 
place, or selfish pride, a fighting for himself, and not for the 
cause as the first consideration for to the cause nothing 
essential depends on his reelection: he can do nothing in office 
which any other trusted man in the party could not as well 
do. He will nowhere then be supported with enthusiasm: 
and though I find the rank and file in Charleston well enough 
content to vote for him as a matter of pride and as against the 
Whigs, there are very few who would not drop him with 
indifference, to take up with ardour a man of our own. No 

1 Renomination is evidently meant. 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 837 

harm then can come from his being now put forward. His 
friends in New York have put out feelers and made demon- 
strations which have been coldly met. An attempt to nomi- 
nate him at a Philadelphia meeting, called for the avowed 
purpose, proved a failure, and the resolutions were indefinitely 
postponed. I think it a good sign too that while certain 
Democratic presses at the North discuss the claims of Buch- 
anan, Com. Stewart, Benton &c. your name is studiously 
suppressed. It looks as if they feared to carry their light 
near the powder barrel. I observe also that in the last Demo- 
cratic Review, an eloquent eulogy adressed to him closes with 
the remark that though the writer would be satisfied to have 
him again elected, he does not wish him to be run, "is not in 
favor of his being named as a candidate." 

On the whole then, let us prepare and wait. Let your 
friends in Congress this session concert movements in their 
respective States, and appoint the how and when of the move- 
ment. Your nomination by this State is stereotyped, and she 
need not move now. It would be fatal. It would at once be 
said "This is all that South Carolina and her Senator were 
aiming at all the time." The part of this State will be to 
return thanks to other States on your account, not to ask 
favors. No danger 1 think of her not striking when the iron 
is hot: but it would work great mischief to give a single 
stroke from any quarter before. I anticipate the time but a 
few months distant when the real State Rights party of the 
Union shall call upon you to lead them in such force as will 
ensure I trust the success of their candidate, and if not that 
at least the placing of our principles on such high ground as 
to compel the respect of the government. 

I have, as you requested, written freely, and I fear you 
will find little in what I have written to repay you the 
trouble of reading this. The sum of the opinion I have given 
perhaps would have been better presented had I only said, 
that 1 concur with you in thinking that in the approaching 
Presidential election, we must fight for our principles with a 
candidate from our wing of the party, that I take it to be out 
of the question that any other than }^ourself should be that 
candidate, that every day strengthens you, that delay is not 
half as dangerous as haste must prove. 



838 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I think also that the rejection of our portion of the Distri- 
bution 1 will strengthen you, and that under the present aspect 
of affairs our State legislature should not be at all belligerent 
in its demonstrations. Our principles are in the ascendant 
through the Union. We expect to command in Congress, and 
it is better not to give either Whigs, or unfriendly and jealous 
Democrats occasion to scout at us for any seeming ultraism. 
We are known to be good Nullifiers without our always 
rattling our arms. We don't want muskets now, when the 
ballot box is about making the cartouche-box superfluous 
I trust. 

Very respectfully Yrs 

JNO A. STUART. 

P. S. The Democrats have as a party so thoroughly com- 
mitted themselves against a Tariff that to fight on that ground 
would kill off any Northern Democrat. M 1 ' Buchanan then is 
out of the question, and M 1 ' Van Buren must profess our 
principles in all their force, which will weaken him there 
with the Whigs, while those very principles will bring to 
you Whigs here, who never would take him up. Benton will 
withdraw Van Buren I think when he finds him coldly 
received. 

The Democrats in general seem unwilling to commit them- 
selves now, and the Whigs' are afraid. The Fabian is our 
true policy this time also. 

P. P. S. Your presence in Columbia will do good.

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUtf. 839 

The whirl[w]ind has indeed come since you wrote, and the 
results of all the Fall Elections have cowed the spirits of 
the Whigs. Their ranks are thrown into great confusion 
and but for their majorities in both Houses of Congress, we 
might consider their great mongrel party as almost entirely 
prostrated. So long however, as they remain in possession 
of those two strongholds, we must regard the battle as only 
half won. We must look to the State Legislatures as the 
Citadels of the public liberty, as they were in 98 and 99, and 
from their efforts we must expect to counteract and arrest the 
encroachments of the Federal Whigs in Congress. 

I can only undertake to express my own opinion in relation 
to the action of our own Legislature, for, 1 am yet unable to 
estimate the bearings of its members. But I hope, they will pass 
resolutions of instruction against a National Bank, andyw the 
Repeal of the Distribution Act. Whether they will succeed 
is of course doubtful. The latter more so than the former, 
because the Distribution law addresses itself to so many 
interests of so many sections of the State, that it is difficult to 
estimate the extent of its seduction. The Friends of Educa- 
tion, of the South Western Road, of the James and Kanawha 
Improvement, of the last link in the central rail-road (from 
Fredericksburg to the Potomac) and others too tedious to 
enumerate, " will respectfully press their claims and pounce 
upon the Fund. " How far the public spirit of our Democratic 
members will be able to resist the interests of their Sections, 
it is impossible for me to say. The Education Convention 
which is to meet in this City on the 2nd Thursday of Dec r 
may witness the first shock, but perhaps it may be put aside 
by the substitution of some other scheme (upon the model of 
N York and N England) for raising the necessary funds to 
improve our Elementary Schools. But it will not be so easy 
to lull the friends of Internal Improvement. Our State 
Treasury has not a spare Sous in it, and the example of our 
Sister States warn us against a further augmentation of our 
State Debt. Our wisest course will be never to borrow, at 
least for the States, unless we lay a tax to raise the means of 
paying the Interest on the debt. This was M r Jefferson's 
maxim, and we understand it is the course which our Acting 
Governor (Rutherford) is determined to chalk out in his 



840 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Annual Message. He, like all our distinguished Democrats, 
is opposed to the principle of the Distribution, and I should 
not be surprised, if in passing he gave it a little touch with 
that discretion, yet moderation which mark the man. 

Your majority in the Legislature of S Carolina is stronger 
than ours in Virginia, and 1 hope they will not fail to take a 
decided part, and spurn the Distributable Fund from their 
lips. I look for a similar result from N York, for our 
friends have gone in there upon the high pressure principle, 
and we may expect from so large a majority a strong and 
towering tone. 

Have we not sore reasons to fear from the flood tide of suc- 
cess, which has recently poured in upon us, a new danger? 
It is so difficult to bear Prosperity, so much easier to with- 
stand Adversity, both in private life and public affairs, that 
we ought to practise upon the lessons which Experience sounds 
in our ears. We must use great wisdom and moderation, in 
the course of the next Session. We must avoid all excesses, 
either in measures, or in the conduct of men. We must 
adhere, in the first place, to our principles, upon which I 
agree with you most cordially, that every thing essentially 
depends. We must in the next place, keep our party united 
together, and fight as gallantly and as unitedly against a flying 
enemy, as we have done against his embattled legions. We 
must, in the third place, shun all causes of dissension, all 
flashings of private interest, all the struggles of aspiring 
ambition. The man who tries to think as little of himself as 
possible in these times (like Silas Wright) is in the best condi- 
tion for serving his country, and ultimately of receiving the 
reward of his disinterestedness. 

We do not yet exactly know what Mr Tyler proposes to do. 
I saw him on his late visit to this City. He looks well, is 
improved both in his dress and address, but I had no oppor- 
tunity of opening up, as I wished, the high matter of the 
Fiscal Agency. We began upon it, but were soon interrupted 
by other visitors. I doubt much whether he had concocted 
any plan of his own, and I learn, that at Norfolk Mr Taze- 
well tried his wonted power of Analysis upon several projects, 
with which Mr Tyler had come to Virginia. His pockets 
filled with them like the Abbe Seiyes pigeon holes. But my 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 841 

impression is, that he will prepare treasury notes in some 
form, and if he does, I trust he will invest them not only with 
the function of 'receiveibility for the public dues, but of imme- 
diate convertibility into specie at a few specified points. All 
however is clouds and darkness over Capt Tyler's fiscal plans. 
In foiling he is evidently more with us, than with the Clay 
Whigs, and also I believe in principle*. But he has now 
(whilst his friends in Congress are not near him) some intrigu- 
ing and adroit advisers around him, and I will not answer for 
the influences which they will put in play upon him. 
Yours truly, 

THOMAS RITCHIE. 



From Duff Green. 1 

Paris 24 th January 1842 

MY DEAR SIR When I last wrote to you, I had not seen 
M r . Stevenson's correspondence with the British Government 2 
nor the reports from the heads of the departments at Wash- 
ington. I have since I came here satisfied myself that under 
the pressure of the public debt, England finds it impossible 
to maintain her commercial and manufacturing superiority, 
because she cannot raise cotton, sugar &c as cheap in India as 
it can be raised in the United States, Cuba and Brazil, and 
that her war on slavery and the slave trade is intended to in- 
crease the cost of producing the raw material in the United 
States, Brazil and Cuba, that she can sell to other rival man- 
ufacturing, continental powers, the product of her East India 
possessions cheaper than they can purchase from us. If she 
can do this, having the power to compel her East India sub- 
jects to purchase her manufactures and her's alone, she can 
through her manufactures command the suppty of raw 
material and thus compel rival manufacturing nations to pay 
her tribute while she in a great measure controls the manu- 
facture itself. This is part of her policy. Do we not see 
one fourth of her Iron manufactures now idle? and why?

because she says the supply exceeds the demand, and do you 
not believe, that if it comes to a question of whether her 
spinning jennies or those of Continental Europe or of the 
United States shall stand idle, she will hesitate as to which is 
to be employed ? or that having the command of the raw ma- 
terial she will fail as to means to accomplish her purpose. 

Under this aspect of the case you will find that England has 
much more than a work of benevolence in the suppression of 
the slave trade. 

She has the alternative of repealing her own corn-laws and 
abolishing her protective duties or of enforcing her present 
colonial policy by stratagem or war. 

If she goes to war there will be great danger that it will 
end in the emancipation of her colonies and that this will be 
followed by the abolition of her national debt and protective 
duties, if it does not end in the reorganisation of society, the 
entire prostration of the present Aristocracy and a modifica- 
tion of the present prerogatives of the Crown. 

Under these aspects of the case I am satisfied that our only 
hope of peace rests in being well prepared for war, and that 
the first measure is such an organisation of the financial con- 
dition of the Treasury as that we can use the credit of the 
Government at home. We have nothing to expect from 
Europe, at least for some time to come. I was introduced to 
Baron Rothschild by Gen 1 . Cass l at a diplomatic dinner and 
speaking of the question which now absorbs all circles, the 
probability of war between England and America, he said 
to me, ' ' But how can you go to war ? you can get no money. 
I received a letter to-day from my correspondent in London 
inquiring to know, whether the United States could borrow 
money on the Continent and my reply was not a dollar." He 
proceeded to say to me "You may tell your government, 
that you have seen the man who is at the head of the finances 
of Europe and that he has told you that they cannot borrow 
a dollar, not a dollar." 

I then explained to him that there had been a systematic 
effort on the part of England to depreciate the credit of the 
United States that her purpose was to compel those conti- 

i U. S. minister to France, 1836-1842. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 843 

nental powers of Europe, as well as the United States, who 
are engaged in rival manufactures, to depend on her East 
India Colonies for the raw material; and therefore the war 
with us would be a war on the manufacturing states of 
Europe, that we had within ourselves all the elements of war, 
that we had six hundred steamboats on a single river, and 
that so far from having anything to fear from England, we 
did not fear to go to war with England with Europe at her 
back, but that Europe would have a common interest with us, 
that by the use of Exchequer bills, convertable into six per 
cents we could command men, ships and munitions of war, he 
said, " yes you may get men and ships, but such is the char- 
acter of } 7 our state debts, that the United States cannot bor- 
row a single dollar in Europe" this was before dinner. 
After the dinner was over, he came to me and urged me to 
come and see him and converse with him on this subject. He 
said, "You may be able to go to war, but you must get the 
means at home." 

After he went away Gen 1 . Cass remarked, th'at he had had 
a long conversation with me and was impressed with its im- 
portance. 1 have not yet gone to see him, but I purpose to 
prepare for the "Review des deux-mondes" the leading 
European Review, an article in which I will demonstrate the 
purposes of England so plain, that I am confident that there 
will be a powerful reaction in our favor. 

Do you not see that this is a war upon the commerce and 
manufactures of New England, through our domestic insti- 
tutions and that this is the time to unite all parties and all 
sections in their support? If England be defeated in the 
present movement, she has no alternative but to fall back on 
free trade; there is a strong party in England -who are in 
favor of free trade and thus the manufacturing continental 
states will unite with the south in a common support of your 
long cherished measure of free trade. But permit me to 
urge on you that altho' I believe this can be accomplished 
without war, the only means of doing it, is to be prepared for 
war; and that under this aspect of the case, I feel a deep 
anxiety to learn, that 3 r ou are acting in concert with the 
administration on the measure of finance. 



844 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I consider this the most important crisis of your active 
and eventful life. When I remember the many times you 
again and again explained to me that the great end of your 
labours was to establish for the United States a free trade; 
and reflect that it is, as I verrily believe it is now in your 
power, by uniting with the President and those of your own 
personal friends, who are in his cabinet and united with him, 
in perfecting the Exchequer bill to accomplish not only free 
trade for the United States but for the greater part of the 
civilized world, I can not permit myself to believe that you 
will not tender your advice and cooperation, and believing 
that by your advice and cooperation the measure can be made 
efficient, I can not permit myself to fear its failure. . . . 



From James I. Polk. 1 c. c. 

Columbia Tenn. Feb y . 23 d . 1842 

DEAR SIR I have received under your frank, your late 
speech on the Treasury Note Bill for which I thank } T OU. 
You have truly stated the question at issue to be that we must 
increase the duties or curtail expenditures, and have abun- 
dantly demonstrated that the latter is not only the true policy, 
but that it is practicable without injury to any branch of the 
public service. I have but little hope however that the ruling 
majority in Congress will adopt it. The increased and increas- 
ing expenditures, the loan and distribution acts of the Extra 
Session, left no doubt in my mind that their ultimate object 
was another protective tariff. The estimated expenditures of 
thirty-two milliom for the present year, the further loan at 
your present Session and the direct movements in the House 
upon the subject of the tariff, plainly show that such is their 
object. I hope you may be able successfully to resist these 
ruinous measures until another Congress can be chosen. That 
the next Congress will change and reverse the policy of the 
majority in the present Congress I do not entertain a doubt. 
The great revolution in public opinion, which has already 
taken place and is still going on, gives the most absolute

LETTERS TO JOHK 0. CALHOUN. 845 

assurance that the next Congress will curtail expenditures and 
in this respect bring the Government back to the policy for 
which you are contending. Of the public opinion in this 
State I can speak with certainty. The systems of measures 
adopted by the part}^ in power, at the Extra Session and fol- 
lowed up at the present Session of Congress, is decidedly 
odious not only to the Democratic party but to a large 
portion of the Whigs. The people of this "State are by a 
very decided and large majority opposed to a tariff of protec- 
tion, to the distribution act which they regard as a tariff 
measure, to a funded debt or a debt in any other form, and to 
the present expenditures, which they regard as unnecessarily 
large; whilst the Bankrupt or rather insolvent law is openly 
denounced by the body of all parties, not having a single 
advocate, except those who expect to take advantage of it to 
lie freed from their debts, and a few reckless political leaders. 
At our last elections in August, these obnoxious measures had 
not been sufficiently developed to be known, and'the people 
acted in view of the liberal promises of relief and reform 
which had been made to them. They are disappointed and 
dissatisfied. They now find that they have been deceived, and 
only await another opportunity to speak at the polls, to vin- 
dicate and maintain their true principles. If the President 
remains firm upon the Bank question, and I cannot doubt 
but that he will, the mischievous effects of the other meas- 
ures of the party in power can be readily corrected here- 
after. 

There is a matter of local interest now before the Senate, 
about which I feel some solicitude, and to which I beg to 
call your attention. It is the confirmation of the nomina- 
tion of M r . Cla'iborne as Marshall of Middle Tennessee. He 
is an honest man and one of high intelligence. He was a 
Representive in Congress in 1816-7, and is probably known 
to you personally. From a reverse of fortune he is now in a 
situation to need the emoluments of the office. The rumor 
here is, that his nomination will be opposed in the Senate on 
party grounds. There can be no other possible objection to 
him. May 1 ask your attention to hi case. 
I am Very Respectfully your ob* sev 1

London Aug* 2 nd . 1842 

MY DEAR SIR I have been a close observer of events here 
and have had access to the most accurate sources of intelli- 
gence. There are a few facts which deserve your most ser- 
ious consideration. 

The Whigs went out of power and Sir Robert Peel came in 
on two propositions the first to admit slave grown sugar in 
competition with British Colonial sugar, and the other a fixed 
duty on corn. Sir Robert Peel in the debate on the sugar 
duties last year avowed that the purpose of this Government 
is to promote the abolition of slavery in Brazil, Cuba and the 
U. States and Lord Brougham openly advocated his bill for- 
bidding British Subjects to purchase slaves on the ground 
that England having abolished slavery, and thereby raised the 
price of labor in her colonies was bound as an act of justice to 
her Colonial subjects to abolish slavery elsewhere. 

The Abolitionists of Texas have deputed a M r . Andrews x as 
an agent, with a proposition to this Government for a loan to 
be applied to the purchase and emancipation of the slaves of 
Texas and Lord Aberdeen told M r . Smith 2 the Texian Charge 
that the British Gov* deem it so important to prevent the 
annexation of Texas to the United States that they were dis- 
posed to support the loan if it should be required to prevent 
annexation. 

It is now understood that the Queen is willing to reinstate 
the Whigs whenever Lord Melbourne says to her that Lord 
John Russell can organise a Government that can retain power 
and such a Government is in the progress of organisation.

ernment that the Duke of Wellington now does to Sir Robert

LETTEES TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 847 

he will not now do what he was anxious to do last year I 
resolved if I could to make his American policy one of the 
points on which the new Ministers are to come in. I there- 
fore obtained an introduction to Lord John Russell and had a 
full conversation on American Aflairs and told him that I 
wished him to [make] up an issue with Ministers. He 
promised me to do so and you will see in the Times which I 
will endeavor to send 3 r ou, that he is the only speaker, on the 
side of the opposition, who touched on the subject of America 
in the debate on the state of the Nation. 

I explained to Lord John Russell and to several who are to 
be his associates in the new ministry the relation of parties in 
the United States and the bearing which the slave question 
has on our policy. 1 am assured by them that during the 
recess of Parliament they will assail Ministers on their 
American policy and that upon coming into power they will 
go for free trade with America and an immediate adjustment 
of the oregon Question, for the admission of slave grown 
produce, and non-interference in the domestic policy of other 
nations that they will denounce the attempt to emancipate 
the slaves of Cuba, Brazil, the U States and Texas as an 
illegal and unwise interference. The most pregnant sign of 
the Times however is that the stock exchange are beginning 
to speculate for a fall in the price of Consols and hence any 
man who has Consols can now get an advance upon them at 
short dates without interest. 

The present ministers are sustained by the land holders, 
the established Church and the fund holders. A formidable 
Combination you will say but it is a combination so sensitive 
to their own peculiar interests that they are ready to sacrifice 
any Government that endangers them. The Whigs under- 
stand this, and their measures are taken accordingly. 

I remember to have heard you say that England will be 
compelled to establish free trade or to renew her system of 
plunder, and I find that a class of political economists con- 
nected with funds are beginning to say that the true policy of 
England is to get up a general war. That the Continent and 
America have become her rivals in commerce and manufac- 
tures and that having the command of the Ocean, she can 
protect her manufactures and monopolise the commerce of

the World, and that a war in Europe would destroy the manu- 
factures of the Continent. Do not these facts present a most 
serious question to you. What are you to do ? Are you like 
Sir Robert Peel, to fold your arms and let events take their 
Course? Are you to say that because the people have not 
given you the first office you will not give your influence 
where it might Contribute to Control events? If while you 
fold your arms and look on, Van Buren is elected and Ben ton 
comes into the State Department, how easy will it be for him 
to provoke a war on the Oregon question ? Do you not see 
cause for apprehension in the late proceedings in Maine and 
New Hampshire favorable to Van Buren and the position 
which the Oregon question is assuming in the West? I see 
that your friends are pledging themselves to support the 
nominee of the National Convention and [it] is now rendered 
almost certain that Van Buren will be that nominee unless 
all other interests combine against him. Instead of this, 
Johnson will compromise at any time for the Vice Presidency, 
and all the other candidates, I fear, will endeavor to weaken 
you under a belief that your friends will prefer any of them 
to Van Buren. Things will run on this direction until you 
are all handed over to Van Buren as so much political Capital 
in the hands of Col. Benton; unless you are wise in time. I 
have studied your position and I never was more fully satis- 
fied as to what it is your duty to do. I am fearful that you 
are not yet prepared to see or to hear the truth as it is. I 
fear that it is the same case with the President. Permit me 
however to say that great efforts are making to seperate you 
and M r Tyler, that you are embarked in a common cause and 
should stand by each other. United you may yet control 
events, divided you become a prey to your common enemy 
and sacrifice the great cause for which } T OU have so long 
labored and with it the best interests of your Countiy. I 
will be prepared in a few days to write to you more fully. In 
the meantime let me entreat you to ponder well over what I 
now say. What you have most to apprehend both as it relates 
to yourself and the country is that Van Buren will be elected 
President and Benton be Secretary of State. If we are to 
have Van Buren the responsibility will rest on you, and you 
owe it to yourself, to your friends, to your Country and the 



LETTEES TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 849 

world to counteract as far as possible the evil consequences 
to be apprehended from his election.

steamer. If I do not and find things when I return right at

Silver Bluff 10 Sept. 1842. 

MY DEAR SIR. There has probably been some miscarriage 
of letters between us. The last I received from you was in 
January or February last and I answered it soon after. I 
should have been very glad often to have heard from you dur- 
ing the exciting scenes of the late Session but did not like to 
interrupt you. It is difficult to understand what is -intended 
by public measures now-a-days without a Key, and the papers, 
and letter writers from Washington are so full of plots and 
counter plots that it is impossible to form any reliable opinion 
from such sources. One thing however seems to me clear 
from all that is said and I rejoice at it. Your Star is evidently 
in ascendant and rising steadily. Buchanan whom I once 
thought formidable has shrunk into very meagre dimension, 
and I think there is reason to infer that Mr Van Buren's tour 
of inspection has satified him that his race is run. He was in 
Columbia, I did not call on him in Charleston but coming 
right to my place of residence I thought it would not appear 
courteous to avoid him and so 1 gave him a dinner. He was as 
full of talk as a horse jockey and quite interesting. It was evi- 
dent to me that he was still aspiring. But young people cannot 
be made enthusiastic in favour of a beaten horse and old ones

will not risk much on him. I think he must go down and with 
him I hope the whole clique of political hucksters Benton, 
Wright, Johnson &c. The only earthly chance for him will 
be a packed Democratic Convention of old hacks. This must 
be seen to. They should be young men. I can't understand 
the vote of his friends on the Tariff. Could they expect to 
gain anything or was it necessary to sustain themselves or was 
it simply an act of desperation and malice towards the South 
and you ? It is remarkable that this identical set should twice 
at two great eras fix the plunder-system upon us by precisely 
the same treachery. I thought better of Wright. I suppose 
we must now give him up for Woodbury. It is rumoured that 
Benton has declared if the issue is between you and Clay he 
will support Clay. So I heard in Augusta the other day. And 
was rather glad to hear it, for it was a proof of your strength 
and an open declaration of that malice which I knew to be 
untiringly though secretly moving against you. He would find 
himself very weak in such a move. I doubt if Missouri even 
would go with him. Would [ ]? I think such a thing 
would effectually remove all fear of our ever being degraded 
by his accession as it would Kill [him] off forever. I am inclined 
to think they will try to make a rally on Johnson. I found 
him very strong in N. York two years ago. Stronger I thought 
than Van Buren. But the Southern Democrats hold the power 
in the party now and he cannot get their support. Harrison 
to be sure was not much better, but there cannot be such 
another excitement gotten up. It would be indispensably 
necessary to carry such a mass of stupidity, vulgarity and 
immorality as Johnson into the Chair. On the whole it seems 
to me the Democratic Party can have no alternative but to 
nominate you. I am so certain of it that were I an aspirant for 
Federal Honors I should lay all my plans accordingly. 1 recom- 
mended Crawford and some Georgia Whigs to do so the other 
day. There is as you know some soreness in Georgia among 
individuals of both sides, but young men are coming up who 
know nothing of W m H. Crawford and I have no doubt of 
the Geo. vote. There is some little talk of Cass there and 
Tyler, and I heard of one man being for Johnson, but all will 
be right in the end. 

The question is often asked what is to be done with the new 
Tariff? Nullify it? I should be glad to have your views on 



LETTERS TO JOHTT C. CALHOUN. 851 

this point, and I will candidly state my own. Nullification is 
the extreme remedy. We should first exhaust every other. 
The prospect of the entire ascendancy of the Democratic Part} 7 
and of your Election is so good that we ought to look to these 
means first before we resort to harsh measures. I cannot but 
think the Tariff will be repealed, for if neither of these two 
apparently certain events happen, I have little doubt that smug- 
gling will render it wholly inefficacious. No earthly power can 
keep out or scarcely interrupt smuggling in such an extensive 
country as ours. The Chief reliance against it must be to make 
it unprofitable by low duties. The virtue of our people is 
another, but I fear there has been a great change in this respect 
on our Coast and frontiers in the last 10 } 7 ears. There is one 
other objection to nullifiation at this moment. I verily believe 
that under the present weak and distracted administration it 
would cause the utter overthrow of the Government. Our 
just resistance would be followed by unjust and unconstitu- 
tional rebellion every where and this Administration could 
not rally a force I fear to sustain even just and Constitutional 
Laws. I should like very much to have your views on this 
topic and political matters generally. Should I be called to 
the Executive Chair in December, to which I can hear of no 
serious or rather no formidable opposition, it would be very 
important to me to have full possession of the views of the 
party to which I belong and particularly of yours on all public 
matters. The Governor's position may become one of interest 
and importance in the progress of Affairs and I desire to make 
it as useful as possible in advancing the Great Cause for which 
we have been so long contending. . . . 
Very truly and sincerely yours 

J. H. HAMMOND 



From R. B. Ehett.^ 

Oct. 13, 1842. 

MY DEAR SIR I wrote to you a week or two ago immedi- 
ately after my return from N. Y. Every day brings me evi- 

i Robert Barnwell Rhett (1800-1876) was a member of Congress from South Carolina 
from 1837 to 1849, and a Senator from 1851 to 1852. He had always an important place 
among the extreme advocates of state rights and secession, and was a member of the 
Confederate Congress.

dences of the rising of our cause. At Tammany on Thursday 
week I am told, by an intelligent friend who was present, 
there was no mistaking the temper of the People. At the 
mention of your name, the applause was immense; and I am 
assured, that so soon as the election of the Committees conies 
on we will have entire possession of Tammany. From other 
sources I am also advised, that the same course of things is 
rapidly extending throughout the whole interior of N. Y. 
Beardsley, a former Member of Congress, is out for you in 
Utica. In Pennsylvania according to the opinion of a Sen- 
ator in the Legislature of that State, who called upon me, V. 
B. is out of the question. Woodberry [Woodbury] and his 
friends are moving with great effect in N. England for us. 
At the late Democratic Convention held in Boston it was pro- 
posed to nominate V. B. but it was soon ascertained that the 
majority were for you, and the attempt was not made. The 
late Brittish regulations, by w h our grain is admitted into 
Canada, and consequently into Great Brittain, at a duty of 
three Shillings a quarter, will I think in two } r ears bring Penn- 
sylvania with us. We will carry the South and divide the 
North West. On the whole, our prospects are bright and 
growing brighter; and judging from the past, we have only 
to keep matters as they are, and we must control the next 
presidential election. 

With respect to your intimation of a change of opinion, 
from the advices of some of your friends out of public life, 
as to the policy of your returning to the Senate next winter, 
I at first determined to say nothing. From what has passed 
between us, I felt that I may subject myself to a misconstruc- 
tion of motives in expressing to you, the opinions I enter- 
tained with respect to it. From subsequent reflection, how- 
ever, I have determined to speak frankly to you, and trust to 
your knowledge of me, for a just appreciation of my motives. 
Neither you nor I are alone interested in your political for- 
tunes. The interests of the whole Country, and especially 
those of the Section to which we belong, are too deepty impli- 
cated to allow mere personal considerations or consequences 
to hinder or control my own act. 

I understand, you have made up your mind (very properly, 
I think), not to serve in the Senate beyond the present Con- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOTJN. 853 

gress. The question then is as to the three months service of 
the next winter. When at the Close of the last Session you 
expressed to me your intention not to return to the Senate, 
you know I dissuaded you from it, and begged you to sus- 
pend your determination, and consult further your friends in 
Congress. At that time, I saw no questions likely to arise, 
which would injure your position with respect to the Presi- 
dency, from the duties of a Senator. But from devellop- 
ments afterwards made, my mind is changed, and I am now 
satisfied that it is your unquestionable policy and duty to 
keep out of the Senate, at the approaching session. I know 
that the Whigs wish V. B. to be their opponent, and fear 
only you. M r Clay has written here, that you will be the 
man the Whig party will have to oppose, and that the 
sagacity of the Democratic Party will not fail to perceive 
this. It will of course be the policy of the Whig, to sow dis- 
sensions amongst the Democratic Party, and especially to kill 
you off. Now what question, could more effectually accom- 
plish this end, than that M r Bayard gave notice he should 
bring up at the approaching Session rescind the expunging 
Resolution. You heard I suppose the notice. You are aware 
of the Constitutional grounds, both you and M r M c Duflie 
took (Preston will not return to the Senate) on this question. 
Now can you meet it, and go along with the Democratic 
Party? To vote with the Whigs to rescind this resolution, 
expunging a censure on Gen 1 Jackson, will be restoring the 
censure. The Whigs controlling the majority will of course, 
so put it, as to put you in the worst position. A vote with 
them on this question will revive all the old feuds which are 
now nearly smothered, and will set the Whigs and V. B. 
Democrats into a state of ecstasy. Your prospects for the 
Presidency will utterly expire under the question. The 
Whigs will press it, if they are not imbeciles or fools, with 
such sure game for the slaughter, and every enemy will re- 
joice at the opportunity of degrading you personally, or 
ruining you politically. If you could consistently with truth 
and honour, go with the Democratic Party, on this question, 
your return to the Senate altho surrounded with difficulties, 
might do no irreparable injury. The Rhode Island question, 
which must arise from the intention lately announced in the 



854 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

R. I. papers, to apply to Congress at the next session, for 
payment of the expenses of the Dorr insurrection we may 
overcome, especially if the Constitution soon to be voted on 
is adopted. This matter will be pressed, for the only chance 
for such a claim is in the present Congress. The Exchequer 
Bank also will give some trouble, for you know that a con- 
siderable portion of the Democratic Party, is in favour of 
Congress doing something. You can do nothing, and conse- 
quently must offend: but this may be got along with. On 
the matter of the expunge, however, you must not be against 
the Democratic Party, or you must surrender all hopes of the 
Presidency. On the other hand, unless you intend to remain 
in the Senate through the next Congress, I do not see what 
material benefit, in the present organization of the Senate, 
you can do to the Country, by a service next winter, whilst 
the risks are immense to your prospects for the Presidency, 
and all the great measures of policy involved in that Election. 
My mind is therefore clear, in the judgement, that it is im- 
politic, and will probably be fatal, for you to expose yourself 
any farther in > the Senate, to the cross fire of your enemies. 

The private friends who have given you advice contrary to 
mine, may possess far greater powers, twice my ability on all 
general matters but without disparaging them, or exalting 
myself, I think I may assert, that with one half their sagacity, 
I may be a far better judge of the effect of political questions, 
and the temper of the People of the Union. Your best Coun- 
sellors in my opinion will be those whose duties and position 
compel them to stud} 7 public affairs, with the greatest inten- 
sity; and who must bear all the embarrassments and mortifica- 
tions any false movement might produce. 

My anxiety on this subject, has led me to seek the council 
of the only two members of Congress of the Democratic Party 
in Washington, favourable to your election M r . Walker of 
Mississippi and Gen 1 . Dawson of Louisiana. M r . Walker Day 
before yesterday brought Judge Woodruff of Louisiana, a 
warm friend of yours, to see me. I found him, with a large 
pile of your Speeches on the Tariff to post to his Constituents. 
He is decidedly opposed to V. B. and in favour of your Elec- 
tion. He expresses no doubt as to the impolicy of your 
returning to the Senate on various accounts, but he says un 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 855 

hesitatingly, that for you to go against the Democratic Party 
on the matter of the expunge, will be in his opinion immediate 
death to your prospects. Gen 1 . Dawson. (of whose steady and 
sincere friendship you are aware) was equally explicit and 
decided: and declared that on such a question, if you went 
with the Whigs, he would immediately abandon you, and take 
position against you-. 

And now my Dear Sir, I have done my duty to you person- 
ally and politically and to the Country, in thus explicitly 
expressing my opinion to you. Act how you may, I will 
strive to support you, and where I cannot commend, I will 
try not to blame. 

M. Rhett joins me in cordial remembrance to M r . Clemson, 
M rs . Calhoun and Yourself, and believe me 
Truly Yours

From Joseph A. Scoville. 1 c. c. 

NEW YORK 25. Oct. 1842. 

DEAR SIR I wrote you a few days since a few lines in answer 
to your letter, and enclosed the latter to you. Such a proceed- 
ing doubtless surprized you very much, and I will explain my 
reasons more fully than I had time to do at that time. Eight 
months ago you might have written 20 letters a day to persons 
residing here and it would have excited no curiosity, but now 
the case is altered, and a letter from you creates excitement 
and alarm among the Van Buren men, and I am sure you will 
see the benefit that will accrue to our cause by avoiding any 
correspondence with the many who will write you from hence. 
There is a jealousy excited even among your friends; it does 
you no good and it makes enemies for the person receiving 
such a letter. Our post office officers are a corrupt sett, 
before I rec d your letter I was aware that there was a free 
letter here for me, postmarked Pendleton, and I should have 
lost all confidence of those who have been my immediate 
associates, Slamin 2 , Hart, and Hunter, had I refused to read it

to them, which I did, save such parts as related to M r . A and 
Mr. H. I have always been in the habit of returning M r . 
Wrights letters. Our nominations for members of the 
Legislature have been made. I was left off the ticket, but I 
do not feel very bad in consequence, for Cha s P. Daly 1 and 4 
or 5 other warm friends of yours were nominated, and Daly 
is a host in himself and can do your cause more good probably 
at Albany than I could have done. I saw him a day or two 
since he says he will write you as soon as he is elected. 
Matters are going on well here. I shall now devote every 
hour of my time to the accomplishment of a matter of vital 
importance, and that is the control of Tammany Hall. I have 
no doubt of success. I am almost sure that your friends will 
be elected from a majority of the wards but it is hard work 
to make them act in concert, and it is only in this way that 
they can be efficient and hold the real power here. I do not 
understand Slamm of late. I can only account for his course 
by supposing that he has been obliged by the State of his 
Finances to go Van Buren. 

I hear from M r . Rhett almost daily. I wish with all my 
heart we had the control of M r . Tylers appointments, but M r . 
Rhett writes me that he thinks Tyler is working for his own 
nomination he will be very much deceived in the Democratic 
party. 

I was very much amused yesterday at the Exchange. The 
Sailors wages have been reduced about 20% they have had 
in consequence a Strike for the wages of last Season, and the 
"turn out" consisted of about 600 men at 4. oclock they 
arrived in Wall St. Col Hepburne addressed them from the 
Exchange, and when he closed they gave 9. rousing cheers for 
yourself. The Col made a very happy hit. As soon as pos- 
sible I would advise your sending me the proposed life etc. 
I have seen the publishers, and they will wait very willingly. 
I will select some one here to edit it. 
Yours very Respy &c

become a member. I dont like such associations, but in this 
case, as a majority of the members have been Whigs, and as 
a Free Trade man must be a Calhoun man, I shall join hoping 
to bring their strength into harmonious action with our 
Friends in active Tammany Communion. 1 do not know who 
are members, perhaps many of your friends that you may 
know. One thing rest assured of, you have friends here who 
will not rest until this City is as safe for you as Charleston, 
or any other of your So Carolina Cities. 

And if we gain the organization of the Hall, you will have 
the State. 



From. Franklin IT. Elmore. 1 c. c. 

Charleston Nov. 2 1842 

MY DEAR SIR I rec^ by M r Clemson your letter of the 18 th 
Oct. and to day that of the 29 by mail covering one to Hon 
R B Rhett. M r Rhett has not yet reached here but is looked 
for [on] every boat. His Brother Alb Rhett is with me and 
has your letter to give his Brother as soon as he arrives they 
will go from here to gether to Walterboro. 

We had some time ago formed a Sort of Committee for 
Consultation as regards the Presidential election and I was 
put at the head of it. It consists of Messrs Furman, Jas J 
Rhett, Boyce, Connor, Gourdin and Trenholm. We had 
taken in several respects the same views you have suggested 
and been acting accordingly. Connor operates in No Carolina 
and Tennessee, Furman, (Cashier of the B k of the State) is a 
nephew of Gov. M c Donald of Georgia and we approach him in 
that way. I have been corresponding in Alabama with Gov. 
Fitzpatrick my Brother in Law and with Lewis and others. 
Since I rec d yours of the 18 Oct. I have written to Fitzpatrick, 
Gov Yell of Arkansas and to Richardson to induce a denun- 
ciation of the Tariff in their messages and have procured 
an excellent letter from M r Furman to Gov M c Donald, in 
which [he] urges the Gov. as his sits first of the Southern

political supporters. See O'Neall, Bench and Bar of South Carolina, II, 85.

Legislatures, to take the honor of a bold decided and 
manly lead on the subject. We have not heard from either 
yet, but I have the strongest hopes that such action may be 
induced as will by its union and vigor produce a most whole- 
some effect. In my letters to our friends I have endeavoured 
also to impress them with the importance of an early nomina- 
tion in all the Southern States. Virginia is a most important 
point. As I returned from it &c in Sep I saw Judge John 
Y. Mason. He said he had no doubt a majority both of the 
party at large and of the members representing it in their 
Legislature were decidedly for you, but he thought it doubt- 
ful if any nomination would be had in the present state of 
things this winter the main and almost only obstacle how- 
ever was in Ritchie, who was wedded to Stevenson and had 
a hope of his being run with M r V B if he could get the 
nomination. If that hope was killed he thought all portions 
of the Party in Ya. could be brought to give their adhesion 
at once to your nomination. His opinions were confirmatory 
of what I had gathered from other sources; and it struck me 
that it was our true policy to bring all the Southern States in 
Solid Column to bear on Va. and thus to carry her as early 
as possible into line. If Georgia will lead off and Alabama, 
Mississipp, No Ca and So. Ca. follow, I do not see how Va, 
can resist. No hope will remain to M 1 ' V B of a Southern 
support and without it he could not hope to succeed unless he 
looks for a Whig support. M} 7 opinion from what I saw and 
heard in N. York and have since learned, is that such a com- 
bined action from all these States would give your friends the 
ascendancy in a large part if not over the whole State. The 
Tariff is crushing N. Y. They say that Boston by her R 
Roads has concentrated the market for domestic goods there 
and by the Tariff cut off the foreign trade from N. York 
thus giving her two stabs in the vitals^and that M r V. B's 
friends have temporized and sacrificed them and are not to be 
relied on they want a more unyielding leader and look to 
you to break down the System. With a good strong lead 
from the South, they would gladly fall in. M r Sumter has 
just come in from N. Y. and tells me your prospects have 
improved very much since I came away. Of all the Demo- 
crats who voted for the Tariff one alone, a M r Davis, has been 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 859 

able to get a renomination. Floyd Gen 1 . Ward, John V Buren 
and the rest are laid aside and Free trade men in their places. 

While on N. York, I will say a few things which may be 
important. There is a great desire there to know more of 
you a short sketchy account of your life and services is much 
desired. Your speeches are inquired after, and most of all 
yourself. They wish to see and talk with you and hear you 
speak. These wishes cannot be resisted. They must all be 
gratified and as to the two former the earlier the better. As 
to the last I have my doubts if the proper time has yet come, 
but I am clear that it is coming and cannot be long delayed 
without injury to your cause. 

M r . Sumter says you trust too much to M r J. A. Scoville 
of that City that you wrote him some time ago a very long 
letter and that he showed it freely that he is not a man of 
weight &c &c I saw a letter of Scoville. I thought him a 
keen shrewd man and quite up to N. Y. politics, but I did not 
know how far exactly to trust him or to estimate his strength, 
therefore all I can do is to warn you as I rec d the warning. 

On the subject of the V. P'y- It seems to me that we can- 
not without disadvantage, make a nomination but while we 
deal gently with Wright and Buchanan, we should as an act 
of common justice give M r . Woodbury the praise you claim 
for him. The last debate on the Tariff, the running discus- 
sion I refer to, was certainly a most interesting one and his 
course and remarks, manly and statesmanlike. M r Stuart has 
just 'returned to his post and will I think if he can get that 
debate, review it and render to M r Woodbury his due. He 
will not forget him at any rate. 

I am very often asked if you intend to resign your seat this 
winter. M r Rhett told me at Washington that you had 
thought of it, but had been induced to withhold a final deci- 
sion for a time. I presume it is your intention to return to 
Washington for the coming Session. I think you are right 
in doing so. Much will be done this winter of which you 
should be at once informed. Questions will come up on 
which your opinions will be inquired after and which you can 
best develope in your place. Your friends have not yet taken 
form and organization enough and the next Session ought not 
to pass without some arrangement of party and operations. 



860 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

We may get into great confusion without some Central and 
common place of information from whence we may know 
what our friends are at and how each can act to the best 
advantage. But should you resign, as I take it you must if 
the nominations of any of the Legislatures put you in the 
field, when will it be best to do it? If you at once leave the 
Senate it may be said you have done so to avoid the issues 
which may be tendered on important questions. But if you 
resigned in consequence of these nominations, to take effect 
after the 4 March next, stating as a reason for remaining 
during the next Session, the pendency of these very questions, 
and your unwillingness to evade or to appear to evade the 
responsibility of fairly meeting them, that no exception could 
be taken to that course. By so doing one good effect would 
probably result at home, that is the election at this Session of 
two Senators in a more quiet way than would be likely to 
occur at a future time, when only one at a time w d be chosen. 

I will with great pleasure attend to any letters that may 
come from any of your friends at your instance and M r Thur- 
ston of Maine will be duly answered if he favor me with any 
letters. 

M r Boyce is now in Alabama, and I desired him if possible 
to see Lewis and Fitzpatrick and to urge personally on them, 
the policy and importance of a nomination at an early day in 
Alabama. I also had a letter from M r . B. Boykin of Mobile 
informing me that y r friends had started a new paper there to 
advocate your election requesting my advice as to its course. 
To this I replied conformably to your views and those we 
hold here. 

I have a Brother W m . A Elmore, a young man of vigor 
and talent in N. Orleans who is disposed to enter warmly into 
this matter. He tells me you have no organ in La. but many 
very many warm friends. They have determined to start a 
paper and he writes to request me to find a suitable Editor. 
I had thought of M r Clapp, Ju r . of the Mercury, but as yet 
nothing is done. Who could you suggest ? My Brother asks 
after Cralle. Can you tell me any thing of him? 

I wish you would put my two Brothers J. A. Elmore of 
Montgomery Alabama and W m . A. Elmore of N. O. on your 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 861 

list for occasional notices. They are both your warm friends 
and have talents to be useful. 

I have written in great haste and trust you will excuse the 
desultory manner in which I have treated these matters. 
I am very truly Yours 

F. H. ELMORE 



From Fitzwilliam J3yrdsall* c. c. 

New York Nov r 6 th 1842 

DEAR SIR, Your amply satisfactory letter of the 20 th ult. 
has been duly rec d and I have taken such measures without 
departing from the rule you have adopted of not appearing 
in the public papers in cases of misrepresentation, that when- 
ever you are again misrepresented as regards free suffrage, 
the democratic papers of this City will at once take up the 
gauntlet in your vindication. 

The Editor of the Democratic Guide has promised to do 
you justice in his next publication. He has about 2,000 sub- 
scribers but his next number will not appear until the first of 
Jan y because he is making it a quarterly instead of a monthly 
publication. He assures me that he will in the mean time, 
upon all occasions when you are spoken of in his presence, 
correct the misstatement he has made. This promise was 
made voluntarily. 

I rejoice that you have put in my hands the proof which 
was wanted and which no man here can use with more advan- 
tage than myself. Your Vote in 1808 is an irresistible fact. 
It shews that you were at that period what "New Yorks 
favorite son" was not in 1821. It is a glorious democratic 
fact in your favor. 

After I last wrote you, an article appeared in the Morning 
Post of this city from a " South Carolinian", vindicating the 
constitution of S C a from the property qualification clause, 
and you from having said that you thanked God it existed in 
your state.

Guide containing the imputation against you. The article is 
towards the end, "Rumors, Rumors." 

I send you also the morning Post of Saturday last contain- 
ing two articles in relation to yourself. You will see that the 
"Free trade Association" founded by me is in progress. I 
have thought it best to make a mechanic the president and se- 
lected M r Commerford for that station. We are felt politi- 
cally already. Many of your friends have lately joined us 
Hutton, Hart, Scovill, Thompson, Godwin, and many others. 
It is decidedly the most effective movement yet made in this 
city in favor of the constitutional principles of which you are 
the leading advocate. It is prognosticated by many that the 
Association will become a Free trade party. 

I regret that my business compels me to be absent from this 
city three or four months. I shall be in Tuscaloosa Al a dur- 
ing Dec r Jan y Feb y and March. But I calculate that after I 
return to the City, I shall go into the political Campaign in 
prospect, and devote myself exclusively to the service untill the 
close of the contest. The Very existence of democratic con- 
stitutional government is involved in the struggle and I can- 
not think of my private interest when there is a matter of such 
magnitude before my eyes. All humanity is interested in it, 
as well as the Millions of this land.

From Francis W. Pickens. c. c. 

Edgewood, 8 Nov. 1842. 

MY DEAK SIR I rec d yours last night, and deeply regret 
the intense excitement which you appear to feel. I have seen 
too much of public matters not to know what you are looking 
forward to. By all the ties of friendship and relationship I 
entreat you to reflect cooly and solemnly upon the steps you 
may take in the next year. It may be that Mr. V. B's success 
may be as fatal as you anticipate, but the great difficulty with 
us is to get any very large portion of the Republican party 
to believe it at present. We shall be compeled to wait 
developements that the country can see and understand. 1 
agree with you as to the Tariff and its results, and if I know 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 863 

my heart I would appeal to arms and the God of battles sooner 
than acquiesce permanent!} 7 under its principles. But we 
must wait and try every reasonable remedy for a few years 
before we can get any large portion of the country to sustain 
the highest measures of redress. Besides it must be a series 
of measures shewing a fixed and certain policy in Government 
that will produce a general feeling in favor of the ultimate 
resort. If you make an open rupture from the great mass of 
the Republican party it will place you in a critical position at 
your period of life, and if it be done about the time that a 
Convention should nominate V. B. (if it should do so which I 
cannot believe yet) it will place you under such circumstances 
that the world will believe it was from disappointment &c, 
and thus weaken your power. However honest and patriotic 
your motives may be it will be hard to make mankind believe 
it. But let us acquiesce as long as possible, and when we 
do make a rupture let it be upon developements made and 
issues tendered such as the public can understand, and not by 
anticipation of consequences in advance which, however 
clear they may be cannot be made so to others who will be 
called on to sustain us. But I hope there will be no neces- 
sity for such a rupture as you indicate in yours. If you 
have the strength that I think you have, particularly in the 
Southern States, let these states move decidedly this Win- 
ter and place you forward upon the highest and strongest 
grounds. I have as far as I am concerned, written to that effect, 
and if Ala., Miss., Geo., N. Ca. and So. Ca. move with spirit 
and union I do sincerely think it will produce your nomination 
by the Convention. I hope so but we must wait events. I 
am no flatterer particularly to a friend in whom I feel such 
deep interest as I do in you and your fame. Now suppose 
you make a rupture and throw yourself upon a seperate posi- 
tion, let us for a moment look at the circumstances with which 
you are surrounded. It will not be like it w^as in 1832 and 33. 
Then you were in the pride and glory of full manhood, and 
had as gallant and as glorious [a] band of friends devoted to 
you as ever man had. You had the abrupt and coarse tyranny 
of Jackson to contend with which gave you the sympatlry 
of man}^ brave men. But how is it now? You are at a differ- 
ent period of your life. Men who may rally under your 



864 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

standard cannot look forward for you to bear it 10 years from 
now. Events have not yet occurred to rouse the public mind, 
except agst the Whigs and their measures. And w.here are 
your men who are your friends ? MDume (although honest) 
is broken down, and will be a splendid failure as soon as he 
gets into the Senate. Hayne is dead. . . * . Hunter is 
a pure and intellectual man, but has no action or influence in 
Va, Lewis is energetic and talented, but is carried off by an 
impulse and sees only one subject and one point at a time, and 
besides he is too fat to be very active. These are all talented 
and useful friends in their present position, but are they such 
and enough to carry you through a great change or rather a 
great issue at the present time of your life? If you say so 
and are determined on it I will go into battle and draw the 
sword by your side, but in my judgement it is not yet the 
time to strike. If it is so decreed (but I do not think so yet) 
let others come into power, and if they go wrong, as you say 
they will, then we can have as disinterested and as talented 
an opposition as ever went into battle we will then stand 
before the country in such a position as to command a candid 
and patriotic bearing, and I will pledge my life and my all to 
the cause ; and if we then fail to succeed in controlling and 
modifying the measures of Gov: we can look to the ultimate 
resort. I hope you will pardon the liberty I take in writing 
you thus freely. I am prompted to it by the deep interest I 
take in your happiness your fame, and your power. 

In the mean time I do hope that your friends will move in 
the Southern Legislatures this Winter, and when we get to 
Washington we can see the whole ground and know what is 
to be done. We must make Free Trade the basis of all con- 
cert in action of any kind. I am for driving all who are for 
a Tariff of protection out of our ranks entirely. The piece 
you sent me from the Argus was sent me in the paper itself 
and marked. I took the same view you did and enclosed it to 
Ritchie, and now intend to demand from him a denunciation 
of it as necessary to keep us together. I shall make it the 
basis of a letter to him. 

Present me affectionately to Anna and Cousin Floride. 
Yours very truly and sincerely 

F. W. PICKENS. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 865 

From E. M. T. Hunter. c. c. 

Loyds Essex V a June 16 th [1843]. 

MY DEAR SIR I have just received letters from Wood- 
bury and others in New England. I wrote to Woodbury 
before the meeting of the N Hampshire Convention to beg 
him to go to it and take an active part for you. I said that 
the nomination of V B by that convention would be consid- 
ered as a fatal blow to him and whatever might be the pro- 
fessions of those who made the movement such would be their 
design. But for him the Convention would have nominated 
V B as it was they made no nomination, and recommended 
May 1844 and a district representation. Under the circum- 
stances this was a great victory. We shall carry the Demo- 
cratic party of New England. Our friends are in high spirits. 
Col. Brodhead has sent $400 to the Spectator, the Charleston 
Committee $500, and D r . Brodhead a poor clerk in Washing- 
ton loaned it $350. For the present and for a short time it 
is out of danger. 

Our friends in N England are about to organise. I am 
writing to our friends wherever I can rely upon them to beg 
them to get up an organisation by Congressional districts. 
If we have (as we shall have) a district representation this 
organisation is essential as a preliminary step and indeed 
through this organisation we can force a district representa- 
tion. Suppose we were to invite an election of delegates by 
the party at the polls, assimilating the mode to that of the 
Congressional election, and that our -strong men in each dis- 
trict would take the stump for you and rally the people to the 
polls. Y Bs friends would be obliged to go in. He would 
certainly be beaten if he did not, he would probably be beaten 
if he did. I am doing my best to get up such an organisation 
and especially in V a . We will beat down Ritchie's influence 
in that way if he resists, us. 

By the way Greenhow is about to establish a Calhoun paper 
in Petersburg. Ritchie has so many well wishers amongst 
our own friends that we thought it most prudent to avoid the 
odor of opposition to the Enquirer and to hang upon his flanks 
until he opened himself so as to justify an attack upon his 
HIST 99 VOL ii 55

centre. If the paper is sustained it will ultimately move to 
Richmond unless M r Ritchie should take a satisfactory course. 
I had entertained some hopes of Young 1 at one time and had 
written three weeks ago to friends in New York to ascertain 
his true position. For reply I received a paper in which he 
publishes his preference to V B to silence there recent rumors. 
He is more of a N Y politician than V B himself and our friends 
in Poughkeepsie made a mistake in endeavouring to identify 
him with our cause. He is one of those enemy-friends of V 
B, who are the most subtle of all politicians and win both 
office and hate from him without being grateful for the former 
or caring a rush for the latter. Davis 2 (Jack Downing) is now 
making a tour in western N Y and promises to give me the 
result of his observations upon his return. But it is hard to 
make a lodgment in that state. The keys of office would be 
more potent there at present than those to St Peters gate. I 
wish we had Van Ness in the Custom House. But I hear 
nothing more of that for the present. I have a great many 
letters still to write. 

Most truly Your friend 

R M T HUNTER. 

P. S I have just received your letter of 3 d June for which 
I am much obliged to you. I have not time now to answer it 
but will write by the next mail. 



From Aslibel Smith. 3 

The following is communicated to Mr. Calhoun, confiden- 
tially. Extract from a note of the Hon. Ashbel Smith, Charge 
d' Affaires of Texas at London and Paris, to Hon. Anson 
Jones, Secretary of State of Texas, dated Legation of Texas, 
Paris, July 31st, 1843. 

"Previously to leaving London, I had a long interview, on 
the 20 th inst., with the Earl of Aberdeen, Sec'y for the 

1 Samuel Young, secretary of the State of New York. 

2 Charles Augustus Davis, who wrote some of the many imitations and continuations 
of the "Letters of Major Jack Downing." 

3 The paper from which this extract is given bears no signature, but is endorsed "Com- 
municated by the Texan Ministers to Mr. Calhoun." Dr. Ashbel Smith (1805-1886) , sur- 
geon-general of the Republic of Texas, was at various times Texan minister to the United 
States, Great Britain, France, and Spain, and was Secretary of State under President 
Anson Jones in 1844 and 1845, 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 867 

Foreign Department, concerning the affairs of Texas. I 
think it proper here to state that I had reason to be pleased 
with the full and frank manner in which his Lordship dis- 
cussed the affairs in question. As a matter of course he 
treated the subject mainly and almost exclusively in reference 
to British policy and interests. Some time before this inter- 
view with Lord Aberdeen, M r S. P. Andrews, whom I have 
mentioned in former despatches as being in London, on an 
abolition mission, requested me to present him to M r Adding- 
ton. After some reflection, I consented to do so the intro- 
duction being in no degree official as I stated to M r Adding- 
ton, and as this course put me fairly in possession of the 
abolition schemes, which had already been presented to the 
British Government. On this occasion I expressed my utter 
dissent from and opposition to all operations then carrying on 
in London, having for their object the abolition of slavery in 
Texas. In my interview with Lord Aberdeen on the 20 th 
inst., I stated that M r Andrews' coming to London about 
abolition was his individual act, wholly unauthorised by the 
Government or citizens of Texas that though there might be 
some individuals in our country disposed to abolish slavery, 
I had no reason to believe they were numerous; but on the 
contrary that I had reason to think no disposition to agitate 
the subject existed either on the part of the Government or 
any respectable portion of the citizens of Texas. I also stated 
to Lord Aberdeen that I was informed representations would 
be sent out to Texas, based on statements made by members 
of the Antislavery convention, who had called on his Lord- 
ship touching this matter, to the effect that Her Majesty's 
Government would afford in some way the means for reim- 
bursing or compensating the slaveholders, provided slavery 
were abolished in our country. I enquired what grounds 
there was for these assertions. His Lordship replied in effect: 
That it is the well known policy and wish of the British Gov- 
ernment to abolish slavery everywhere that its abolition in 
Texas is deemed very desirable, and he spoke to the point at 
.some little length, as connected with British policy and Brit- 
ish interests and in reference to the United States. He added 
that there was no disposition on the part of the British Gov- 
ernment to interfere improperly on this subject, and that they 



868 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

would not give the Texian Gov* cause to complain. He was 
not prepared to say whether the British Gov* would consent 
hereafter to make such compensation to Texas as would 
enable the slave-holders to abolish slaveiy. The object is 
deemed so important, perhaps they might, though he would 
not say certainly. 

"Lord Aberdeen also stated that despatches had been re- 
cently sent to M r Doyle, the British Charge d'Aff'aires at Mex- 
ico, instructing him to renew the tender of British mediation 
based on the abolition of Slavery in Texas and declaring that 
Abolition would be a great moral triumph for Mexico. Your 
Department will not fail to remark that this despatch to M r 
Doyle appears to introduce a new and important condition 
into mediation. 

"The British Go v l greatly desire the abolition of slavery in 
Texas, as a part of their general policy in reference to their 
colonial and commercial interests, and mainly in reference to 
its future influence on slavery in the United States." 



From Edward J. Black. l c. c. 

Barnwell Dt. S. Carolina. Sept r 1 st 1843. 
M DEAR SIR, I would have written to you frequently 
before this, but I knew that you must be almost overwhelmed 
with correspondents of all sorts and descriptions. Do not 
believe, however, that my silence is indicative of forgetful- 
ness of yourself individually, or of your political interests. 
Far otherwise. After I returned from Washington I exerted 
myself to get as many of our friends from lower Georgia into 
the Convention as possible. I went, as a member, myself, 
and had the satisfaction to see our labours crowned with your 
nomination. The old cry of the triangular influence of Col- 
quett, Cooper, and myself was raised by a few Van B. men 
with the hope of defeating you before that body. Judge 
Kennan, Mr. Hunter, of Crawford Co. and a few other lead- 
ing men, but more especially Col. Cobb 2 , of Clarks, one of our

Major-General C. S. A. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 869 

members elect to Congress made eveiy effort to defeat you. 
For this opposition Cobb is mainly responsible, as he sus- 
tained and directed it. We laboured under some disadvan- 
tages in the Convention, neither Colquett or Cooper were 
members. Cooper was not present, and was a prominent 
candidate of a nomination for Gov r , and olquett did not 
arrive in Milledgeville until towards the last of our session. 
But notwithstanding these difficulties we turned out and 
measured our strength with these old Van B. advocates, and 
they soon found that your name, even if it had been turned 
loose in the Convention without a rider, would have run 
through^ and distanced every competitor. I assure you all 
that we had to do was to fix things a little, and then to hold 
in our young men, who, if let alone would have been indis- 
creet in 'their ardour for you. After the nomination was 
made we succeeded, I think, in allaying the feelings of the 
great mass of our disappointed friends; and also succeeded in 
having the Geo. delegates to the Baltimore Convention spe- 
cifically instructed as to their votes, and that too without an 
alternative, that is, to vote for you and for no one else. Now if 
Mr. Cobb, who is a delegate, will not obey these instructions 
he must resign, and his place will be filled by the remain- 
der of the Delegation. I am very glad to see the Democracy 
succeding in their elections, and I am also glad to see that 
they are defeated in Tennessee. Of course I do not speak this 
publicly, but where I may say it with safety I do say it. It is 
well in my opinion that Democracy is temporarily defeated, 
just at this time, in Tennessee. It is to be hoped that it will 
operate as a sort of quieting dose to Blair, and Ritchie. It will 
also serve to shew to the American people that there are 
other spokes in the Democratic wheel besides the " Old Hero". 
If you remember I got a letter from M r . Boston, of Savannah, 
asking me to send the Globe to him if it was not unfriendly 
to you. I sent the letter to Blair and [Rives ?], and they replied, 
in answer to Boston, at some length, and with much warmth, 
protesting their absolute neutrality until after a nomination. 
And privately to me they made the same professions, and 
Blair declared to me that he would not be guilty of forgetting 
your friends in the House who had helped him to the printing 
of the 26th Congress, in which I bore some part. But that 



870 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

as he was the Central organ of the whole party he would sup- 
port only the nominee of the Convention. How widely they 
have departed from their written promise to Boston, and their 
verbal promise to me. If it would result in no injury to our 
friends I would procure their letter to M r . Boston, and pub- 
lish it with an accompanying explanatory article. Their 
letter is very full and explicit, and indulges in some feeling 
because they were suspected of being averse to your election. 
How strangely their present position would contrast with 
that letter. I look forward with some satisfaction to the 
casting of my vote next Winter for Printer, and I hope we 
shall have some friends in the House who will know how to 
reward merit. 

Will we have many aspirants for the Speakership ? It is a 
most powerful and important office, and I, for one, am not 
disposed to give it away. Without meaning to say that a man 
would be justifiable to buy support with the patronage of office, 
I am yet quite sure that whenever I have it in my power I 
shall so cast my vote, or patronage, if I have it, as to sustain 
those who sustain the principles upon which alone we must 
expect to succeed. 

I read your letter to Gale and Seaton, 1 and it is just such a 
letter as you should have written; it has and will increase the 
confidence of Thousands in you. Your friends in Georgia 
regard it with the utmost satisfaction. We are in great hope 
of beating Geo Crawford in Georgia, and if we succeed in 
keeping the Democracy together I think there can be no doubt 
of his signal defeat. 

My dear Sir, I shall be at Washington this Winter, and if 
I can serve you there in any way I hope you will not hesitate 
to call on me for my services. I propose to take some part 
in the action of the House and party during our session, and 
would not only be happy to render you any aid in my power, 
but to receive such suggestions as to our course and move- 
ments as your ability and experience entitle and enable you to 
give. I do not mean to impose any unnecessary additional 
burden of correspondence on you, but to signify my desire 
to sustain my portion of the struggle that is before us.

From Duff Green. c. c. 

London 2 nd Sept. 1843 

DEAR SIR 1 have seen M r Goulbourn the present Chancellor 
of the Exchequer and Lord Palmerston since 1 last wrote to 
you, and conversed with them both on the subject of Ameri- 
can affairs, especially on the subject of the tariff, the Oregon 
and Texas questions. 1 have seen other influential men of the 
Whig party who are prepared to rally against ministers on 
the question of slave grown produce, and especially on their 
policy of interfering with the question of slavery in foreign 
states. 

1 enclose you the Anti Slavery Reporter, the organ [of] the 
Anti slavery Committee and would call your attention to the 
speeches of Lord Brougham and Lord Aberdeen on the sub- 
ject of Texas and the speeches of Sir Rob fc . Peel on Lord 
Brougham's slavery suppression bill as well as to the comment 
of the Editor, and the Speech of M r Bright. The latter is a 
quaker and his speech shows that a reaction has begun here. 
The Anti slavery party are losing their influence and if our 
Gov*. can be induced to take strong ground on the question of 
Texas, the free trade party here will rally for us against the 
fanatics and the Whigs will make the refusal of ministers to 
meet the proposition of our Government a matter of serious 
assaults. 

I was most strongly advised to bring out an extract from 
your letter and also from a letter of M r Upshur, that the 
people of England might know that you and he were in favor 
of an adjustment by treaty. It is believed that the effect will 
be to induce ministers to make the treaty or to so strengthen 
the popular sentment ag* them as to bring in the Whigs. 

I am satisfied that it will do service here and in the United 



872 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

States. It will show that if all the questions between us be 
not satisfactorily adjusted, the fault is not with us. 

I hope that you will not disapprove of what I have done. I 
did it for the best and I am sure it will result in good. I am 
progressing with my arrangements and hope to conclude them 
advantageous!}^. I may get home in October, if not, in Nov r . 
Bennett of the New York Herald is here. I have induced 
him to purchase all the Anti slavery documents, and have 
introduced him to influential parties here who have convinced 
him that the Anti Slavery movement has nearly run its course, 
and he goes home prepared to take strong ground with the 
south on the Tariff and on Abolition. His paper will coop- 
erate with us most efficiently and your friends may command 
it to the fullest extent. 

I have seen your letter to the Ed. of the Intelligencer and 
as you say you are under obligation to them. 
Your friend

From F. II. Elmore. c. c. 

Charleston 4 Sep. 1843 

MY DEAR SIR I was prevented leaving the City (as I 
informed you I would in my last) by an attack of the prevailing 
influenza. I have therefore had some more time to push our 
measures here. The opportunity has not been lost. Since I 
wrote we have succeeded in inducing M r . Rhett to go to 
Washington with funds in hand and at his draft to put the 
Spectator into a daily if thought advisable and also, to make 
a movement for a paper in New York. The Journal of Com- 
merce has been of late doing us some kind service but we 
must have a good decided and able paper there if we can. 
Rhett left us last Wednesday. He was to stop a day or two in 
Virginia to see M r Seddon, Scott and other friends and mem- 
bers of the Central Committee. Also to have an interview 
with Ritchie &c. He will probably be by this time in Wash- 
ington. I had written to induce Gen 1 Saunders, 1 Hunter, M r 
Maxcy, M r Broadhead and such others as they might think 

1 Romulus M. Saunders of North Carolina. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 873 

advisable to .summon, to meet at Washington and make all 
proper arrangements for a systematic and regular plan of oper- 
ations. Rhett had also written to Hunter. His plan adopted 
upon Conference with our Committee of 15, is to first put the 
Spectator going and if possible to get Hunter to take it, he prom- 
ising to remain and with or without Hunter, aiding to edit it. 
He also will go to N York as soon as he can be spared to see if 
he cannot get a paper there. We have authorized him to say 
that we will raise $10,000 at least if our Northern friends will 
raise $5,000 all of what they raise, they may use in their own 
quarter. I have no fear of getting $15.000 if our friends in 
the Country will do half as well as we are doing in the City. 
We have suffered not a little in our operations by the prevail- 
ing influenza. My attack and Alb Rhett's have both greatly 
impeded action. We would have had before now some one to 
visit Pickens, M c Duffie, Hammond and others to get their aid, 
but sickness in the family of M r Simons our Secretary has 
stopped him. In a day or two we expect to get M r A H 
Brown off. He is a very warm friend of yours and will I hope 
visit you on his way. You will find him shrewd and sensible, 
but full of prejudices, yet on the whole well suited to the 
mission. We propose to send him first to Edgefield and thence 
to Abbeville, Pendleton, Chester, Fairfield, Sumter, Colum- 
bia Orangeburgh and home. Alb. Rhett was taken sick on his 
way to Beaufort after his Brother and was able to do nothing 
in that direction. Georgetown we must reach in some other 
way. 

Our Correspondence is becoming more active, but still it is 
not what it ought to be. I cannot do a tithe of what is needed. 
I endeavor to keep up something in that way, but it is but 
indifferently done. We have letters from your friends in 
Mobile and I think I will send you Campbells. A few days 
before I rec d . his, one from Jos. W LeSesne l (a son in law of 
D r . Coopers) was rec d by the Mercury asking much the same 
information that Campbell does. I wrote LeSesne gave him 
a short history of our movements let him understand the 
points in controversy with Ritchie and told him to keep his 
eye on that and he would easily understand what we should 
be going for. I also apprised him of Rhetts probable move-

ment to Washington where I hoped some Central organization 
would be made and that he and our friends would know it if 
done. I also urged popular movements as widely as possible. 
Last winter they adjourned their Democratic Convention till 
the coming December. I said that now was the time to have 
County meetings to appoint Delegates and one great move- 
ment should go off as a Leader with some strong exposition of 
our creed, resolutions declaring their preferences for the Presi- 
dency District system, per Capita vote &c. 1 urged this as 
strongly as possible and inclosed the letter to Lewis with one 
to him insisting that he should go immediately up to Mont- 
gomery and Autauga and see Gov. Fitzpatrick and M r . Belser 
and form their plan of operations and set immediately about 
its execution. I have stimulated Gen 1 Saunders as much as 
I can. 

I have waited anxiously to hear from you since M r . Ritchies 
paper of the 22 nd Aug. noticing "A member of the Conven- 
tion". I have prepared a short reply to his questions, but I 
will not put it in print for a day or two, waiting to hear from 
you. I hope you will not hesitate as soon as anything appears 
in his paper requiring it, to let us have your views without 
waiting for us. You can see the course so much more clearly 
than we here who have so limited a scope of the field, that we 
would in all important moves rather greatly have your opin- 
ions before acting. 

I hope to day to hear from Rhett if I do I will put in a 
postscript to let you know what he says at Richmond. Would 
it not be well for you to drop your friend Greenhow of the 
Petersburgh Republican a word of advice. He is too rough- 
too hasty too unguarded. M r . Ritchie gets greatly the better 
of him by his temper. ... 

Very Truly yours F. H. ELMORE

Tyler had been realized fully, and your friends had been 
placed, at an earlier period, in situations of influence, we 
should have elected all the Delegates to the Baltimore conven- 
tion from Maine (excepting two) friendly to you. But our 
opponents have had the advantage of party organization and 
will or have carried all the delegates excepting four; while I 
am assured, upon the best authority, that a decided majority 
of the Democratic party in Maine are favorable to you, 
including the most active and intelligent. The power of calling 
the conventions in the several states and counties lies with the 
committees who were appointed under the old regime and are 
in the interests of Van Buren. Knowing the rapid progress 
your cause is making, they appointed meetings to be held at 
an earh T day and in that way have been successful; when if 
they had delayed calling there meetings until next Spring 
success would in almost every instance have been with you. 
Not content even with these proceedings, but fearing the 
effect which the developement of public opinion may have upon 
their own delegates, the} 7 have resorted to the expedient of in- 
structing them to vote for Van Buren, thus violating a great 
principle adopted in fixing upon May rather than November for 
the time of holding the Baltimore convention. The reason for 
preferring Ma} r to November undoubtedly was that the later 
period would better enable the convention to judge with pre- 
cision as to who was the most available candidate. By choos- 
ing delegates in August or September we lose the advantage 
of acting upon the information that we should be furnished 
with, from developements that will assuredly take place dur- 
ing the next session of Congress. The time between this and 
next May was intended for the benefit of observation and 
deliberation. These objects are lost by an early choice of 
delegates, bound too, by instructions. Our State convention 
is to be held at Worcester on the 13 th inst: The contest is 
going on with great activity and no little virulence. I shall 
send you a few papers by which you will see that some of the 
towns are instructing their delegates to nominate Van Buren 
and others are instructing to keep the question of the Presi- 
dency an open one. Gov. Morton * throws all the weight of 

1 Marcus Morton, governor of Massachusetts 1840-1841, 1843-1844.

his influence in favor of instructing the delegates to nominate 
Van Buren. Had he been friendly to you his position was 
such that with the aid of his influence we could have pro- 
cured your nomination in Massachusetts, which would have 
powerfully influenced the action of the other New England 
States. As it is we shall nearly equal our opponents in con- 
vention and we expect to defeat the plan of nominating Van 
Buren. I do not expect the convention will amount to more 
than about four-hundred members. We have elected 60 of 
the delegates from Boston favorable to you to 12 Van Buren. 
About the same proportion in Essex. 10 to 2 in Salem. 
Eight in Charlestown beside many other towns favorably heard 
from. One thing is certain if the convention nominate Van 
Buren Mortons vote will fall greatly short of what it was last 
year. We shall gain then in any event. If Van Buren is 
brought forward (as he assuredly will be) and fails of a nomi- 
nation it will be evidence of his unpopularity. If nominated 
and Mortons vote is greatly diminished the same inference 
will follow. The meeting in the Park has come off gloriously. 
Your cause is certainly looking up at the North. A week 
since I thought the nomination of Van Buren certain. Now 
I think your chance of a nomination is best. Your friends 
here are determined if Van Buren should receive the nomina- 
tion to run you on an independent ticket. Your friend 
Brownson thinks that we should have Whig votes enough to 
carry Massachusetts, Maine and New York and other North- 
ern states which would follow the example of Massachusetts. 
I do not wish you to make any reply to this part of my letter 
whatever your sentiments may be. Your opponents are mak- 
ing a good deal out of your supposed sentiments on the Rhode 
Island question. I should be glad to receive a statement from 
you on that head which I may show to some of our Democratic 
friends from that state. I was requested to day to procure 
one from you but not for publication or even to be copied. 
One other ground of objection is used with great effect by the 
Van-buren party which is this; that if you were elected Presi- 
dent, your political friends would have nothing to look for, 
but the Whigs be suffered to retain the offices obtained by 
thrusting out the Democrats. The Eastern Argus has been 
very busy of late in propagating this notion. Now as M r Van 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 877 

Buren has always acted upon the policy of rewarding his 
friends, and M r . Clay has recently declared that he shall take 
care of his friends, some are deterred from adopting your 
cause from an opinion that if you are successful they would 
fare worse than tho' friends of either of the other successful 
candidates. Such motives will always operate on the selfish 
part of mankind who are but too numerous. 

If the Southern politicians know, as I know , that one of the 
most objectionable means made use of by the Van Buren men 
here against you is your adherence to the domestic institu- 
tions of the South they would never consent to abandon your 
cause in any event. But more of this at some future period. 

In relation to the Vice-Presidency it seems that Woodbury 
will not be able to carry his own State and cannot of course, 
bring the least aid to your cause. Should Van Burens friends 
hereafter conclude not to press his claims, or faling to procure 
his nomination, withdraw his name, it seems to me that Silas 
Wright's name on your ticket as Vice President would give 
it more strength than an}^ other. If Van Buren should not 
be withdrawn your friends would have to choose between 
Cass and Buchanan. Would either of them consent to be run 
as Vice President ? 

I learn from intelligent gentlemen from the West that Cass 
has lost ground in that quarter by his controversy with Web- 
ster. Col. Johnson is expected here on his Northern tour 
and the friends of Van Buren here, and in N. Hampshire are 
making extensive preparations to receive him. Their object 
is to pursuade him to run with Van Buren for the Vice Pres- 
idency. Should they succeed it would greatly increase Van 
Burens chances. Some think that Johnsons demonstrations 
are for the purpose only of making capital for the Vice Pres- 
idency, while others who pretend to be well informed say 
that he will not run for the Vice Presidency and that he cal- 
culated to go into the convention for the presidency with the 
strength of ten states on the Oregon question. Are you cor- 
rectly informed as to Johnsons views ? 

Sep8 

Since writing the above I have seen a gentleman who 
informs me that he has, within a few days, seen a letter from 
Col Johnson stating that he will not in any event be considered 



878 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

a candidate for the Vice Presidency. This is good news, and 
in my opinion seals the fate of Van Biiren. He must be 
defeated by a large majority in the first vote taken in the Con- 
vention. I was also informed yesterday from a source on 
which I can rely that four of the delegates to the Baltimore 
Convention chosen from Vermont are friendly to you. This 
we do not want known openly, as we should have to fear that 
they might be instructed adversely. The news from the Syra- 
cuse Convention received this morning has surprised us, but 
agreeably. I have seen many shrewd politicians to-day, among 
others Gov. Hill, 1 and they, one and all, consider the fact that 
the Convention have chosen the Delegates to Baltimore as 
decidedly iffijurious^ nay ruinous to the prospects of Van 
Buren. It seems that he is afraid to trust the people. Your 
friends in that State will now rally and make choice of dele- 
gates by Districts. We hope the partizans of Van - - will 
try the same thing here, whether successful or not. I have 
heard it whispered that they intend to do so. Van Buren's 
friend Vanderpool was here, a few days since, endeavoring to 
buy up your friends. He was liberal, I am told, in his offers, 
promising to one the post office if he should succeed, and to 
my partner his former post of Naval officer, &c. 

I have just received a letter from our friend Maxcy which 
as it is interesting I will send you a copy next week. I am 
going to [Baltimore?] next week for the purpose of trying an 
important case there. I hope on my return to find a letter 
from you. 

With sincere regard Yr friend

New York 13 th September 1843. 

DEAR SIR: The meeting held here on Monday week, was 
hastily, if not inconsiderately, got up; and neither shows the 
character, nor number of persons friendly to your election, 
since many of the most respectable and influential were not 

1 Presumably Isaac Hill, of "Kitchen Cabinet" fame, governor of New Hampshire

LETTEES TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 879 

apprised of the meeting in time. I was called upon on Sun- 
day, and invited to serve as an Officer of a Meeting to be held 
the next day! without having seen the call, or names of the 
Officers, or order of business and Resolutions; and of course 
declined having long since laid it down as a rule, to under- 
stand before- hand, the principles, and contemplated proceed- 
ings, of political meetings, previous to sanctioning the same 
with my name. 

The Chairman waited upon me the next day, and explained 
the manner of getting it up &c. I encouraged the eifort, and 
suggested, for future operations, the District plan of calling 
meetings in this City. I also urged upon him and now pray 
leave to present to your consideration the necessity and im- 
portance of establishing in this City, a Democratic paper, 
friendly to your Election. It would, as -I observed to him, 
do more good, than forty mass meetings! and recommended 
prompt and strong exertions for its establishment, which I 
think will be made with success. An issue of 2000 daily pa- 
pers at Two Cents each, will be required to defray the expense, 
and sustain such a journal. 1000 can be circulated in this City 
and State, and subscriptions are now being obtained; for the 
balance foreign aid must be solicited, and can unquestionably 
be procured. Perhaps the most ready and easy mode of ac- 
complishing it, is by furnishing the names of one or more 
prominent, influential friends in each State, who should be 
apprised of the importance of the enterprise (by a Central 
Committee of one or more members from each State, to be 
organized for the general purposes of furthering your Elec- 
tion) and invited to aid in its Circulation not only, but also to 
furnish Articles and Communications; and, if it can be so ar- 
ranged, that a given number of papers shall be guaranteed to 
be circulated in each State, there would be little or no delay 
in its publication. The Plebian is the only Democratic morn- 
ing paper published in this City, and speaks for itself! 

A strong Democratic morning paper, denominated the 
"United States Advocate," or some other appropriate name 
conducted by an able Editor, of great respectability, probity, 
and a high order of talent, advocating the union and doctrine 
of Free Trade and sailors rights, is required in this City; and, 
in my opinion, would succeed, and yield a fair profit to the

proprietor; and most assuredly, it would carry a very great 
political influence and weight in your favor. It would un- 
questionably be the most useful and powerful engine, that can 
be brought to bear upon the enemy, if worked adroitly upon 
the high pressure system, and the steam kept up, by editorial 
articles, communications, extracts from other papers, from 
your pamphlet, remarks upon your patriotic conduct towards 
the Van Buren administration, in sacrificing private opinions 
and prejudices of the man and with a single eye for the public 
good, throwing yourself in the gap, and thereby saving his 
administration from dissolution, and preserving the union and 
integrity of the Democratic party, shewing up his ingratitude 
in becoming your Competitor under such circumstances, his 
deception and want of honesty in professing to approve the 
one term doctrine, and, at the same time, offer himself for a 
second term! But, in his case, I am not surprised at any of 
these things; for I have marked his entire political career. 
He, not having had the benefit of a Classical Education, and 
all his time having been occupied in the practice of law, and 
the turmoil of politics, has had little or no time for Reading 
or improvement, which' has always operated much against 
him: but he early acquired the character of an artful, cun- 
ning, selfish politician, which he still retains. And these quali- 
fications, with fugitive political principles, and much good 
luck, has raised him to the high political position he now 
holds, and nothing else! What great or good act, has he ever 
performed for this State, or the United States? If any, I am 
ignorant of it. 

The Irish vote in this City is very large; and a member of 
their fraternity, observed to me a few days ago, that Mr. Van 
Buren would not get 300 of these votes in this City and 
County ! At the Syracuse Convention his friends had a major- 
ity, and as you'll observe have rejected the District plan, and 
adopted the old Anti-republican system of choosing delegates. 
The proceedings of the Convention are irregular; and they, in 
appointing Electors, have exceeded their powers; and many 
members were received without Credentials! Four of our del- 
egates protested, and have called, or will shortly call a Meeting 
of our Citizens friendly to the District System, and lay before 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 881 

them the entire proceedings of the Convention, which will not 
cannot be sanctioned. 

The influence I most fear, is the Anti Slavery Societies; and 
should they act in concert, it will be a powerful vote, and^W? 
to the Candidate who favors their principles. This subject 
requires deep consideration and must be met, and controverted; 
its unjust, improper and dangerous tendency, and thus fatal 
consequences, if carried out, would be a violation of the federal 
Compact, and cause a seperation of the Union ! Let it once be 
understood, that no President shall hereafter come from a 
Slave holding State, and the Rubicon is passed. But relying 
as I do upon the good sense, inteligence, and patriotism, of 
the Citizens of the U. S. I hope for, and expect, a more 
favorable result. Pray excuse the liberty I take in addressing 
you, as above, but I feel a deep interest in the success of your 
Election, and a desire to do what I can to promote it; and 
have thought, that some of the proceeding suggestions, may in 
some slight degree, benefit the cause. With a tender of my 
services, which you may freely command, I remain

Sept r . 19 th [1843]. 

MY DEAR SIR I have just returned from Washington where 
I have been to consult with our friends. M r Rhett I presume 
has advised you of our proceedings there. He inclines to 
Greenhow as an editor and so do I unless we should lose the 
Republican by taking him away. M r Rhett is probably this 
day in Richmond upon that business. He promised me to 
consult Seddon and the Richmond Committee before he saw 
Greenhow and in any event not to destroy the Republican 
which is doing good service. I could not wait to see Maxcy. 
He had then just returned home from the North where he 
published a pamphlet on the Convention said to be very able. 
I have not yet read it but Maxcy writes well. Hatton writes 
me from N Y that our friends are in high spirit. They mean 
to fight the battle in earnest and they will probably raise 
HIST 99 VOL ii 56 



882 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

funds in N York to establish an efficient Calhoun paper in 
that city. I do not know who is to be the editor. Some as- 
sistance can be had from Norton. I advised Rhett therefore 
not to offer funds from Charleston, but when he reached the 
North to urge them to establish the paper in N York with 
their own funds. This I believe can be done. The residue of 
the money raised in Charleston ought to be kept (I think) for 
a document and contingent fund. M r Rhett will endeavour 
to organise a committee in Washington to assist him. Gen 1 
T thinks this will be difficult but I found one man who will 
cooperate efficiently and others doubtless may be had. 

I found that M r Rhett had written you despondingly. I 
am no prophet and of late I distrust my judgment as to future 
occurrences more than ever. But 1 by no means despond. 
We may be beaten but not if we fight with the proper spirit 
and judgment. The Syracuse Convention has given us a great 
advantage if our friends are staunch and know how to use it. 
Our New York friends have taken the right stand and we 
must sustain them. We gp for a district convention and if 
the states known to be favorable to you will take their stand 
upon this, we will beat down the Syracuse plan and elect our 
man. At least there would be fair chances for electing him. 
1 urged Rhett to write to Buchanan at once. If Johnson 
Buchanan and Cass unite with us on this position we must 
either beat Van Buren or there will be no Convention. It is 
very desirable to have their aid but we had no time to wait. 
The Syracuse proceedings must be met at once. I fear how- 
ever that B. J and C will keep up the old game of making 
us contest all matters with V B so as to obtain the second 
place in the affections of his friends. But dispersed as we 
now are we had no time to play the game with them. It is 
very desirable that our friends all over the Union should sec- 
ond the movement of our N York friends. It was made at 
Maxcy's suggestion who informed them that I had been 
endeavoring to prepare such a movement throughout the sum- 
mer. So I have but God knows with little enough of success 
so far as organisation is concerned. But they think that there 
is more of this last than really exists and the idea serves to 
inspirit them. The course of Georgia and probably of Mis- 
sissippi will embarrass us. Early in the last spring I wrote 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 883 

to some of our friends in S C a and I think also to you to urge 
the propriety of districting Georgia as had been done in N 
Hampshire. Unfortunately for us two of our most reliable 
states have the general ticket system and there will be great 
difficulty in getting them to aid us in this movement. Gen 1 . 
T thinks this movement vital to our success. If our friends 
sustain it there will be no Convention and New York will have 
the responsibility of defeating it. Will they aid us? You 
have seen by this Rhetts article in the Spectator on this sub- 
ject. I will write tonight to urge Greenhow to sustain it. I 
have already written to young M c Lane. This last writes me 
that our friends in the middle states are prepared to break up 
the Convention and he asked my opinion of the propriety of 
his advocating the election by the House. 1 replied that to 
advocate an election by the House as good 4 per se ' would do 
us mischief but he might well show that the evils coming 
from it would be less than that of a packed Convention or one 
which like the Syracuse plan would destroy all the influence 
of the smaller states in the Presidential election. 

As I came through Baltimore last Saturday I saw Walter- 
son of Tennessee who has been recently appointed to Buenos 
Ayres by Tyler. He was just from a tour through 8 states. 
He says he thinks there is a growing impression amongst the 
Democrats that their only hope of success is in an election by 
Congress. He says that in Tennessee since the election the 
party are convinced that they will be beaten in Tennessee if 
V B is run. He was at the Hermitage about 4 weeks ago and 
Gen 1 Jackson told him that he would vote for you if nomi- 
nated. He thinks that J still prefers V B but says he is now 
very silent about it. He was told by Polks brother in law 
that you could take Tennessee but V B could not. Turney is, 
now convinced that V B cannot run successfully in Tennessee 
but talks about Cass. Johnson is gaining strength in the 
west and Benton it is said is alarmed. He says in his public 
speeches that it is "no mark of democracy to vote for Col 
Johnson". Allen Medary and that set Waterson thinks are 
immovably for V Buren, but they will be beaten (he thinks) 
in Ohio by the Whigs. In my own State M r Ritchie will have 
more difficulty than he expected. Your friends here do not

London 2<J th Sept. 1843 

MY DEAR SIR I send you the Examiner's Comments on 
your letter. The article was prepared by one of the most 
influential members of Parliament who has at all times taken 
a most prominent lead in the Anti Slavery movement, and I 
value it the more because you cannot fail to see that I have 
done much to remove from his mind the prejudice against the 
south, and especially on the questions of slavery and state 
rights. 

I have also seen Lord Palmerston and several other leading 
Whigs who were most disposed to go astray on that point and 
have done much to pledge them to free trade principles with- 
out reference to the source from where the produce comes in 
exchange. Sir Robert Peel is sound in Principle but it is now 
manifest that he will fold his arms and wait for events. The 
Anti Corn law league are making great progress and have 
enlarged their basis so as to go for free trade and against all 
monopolies. They have just made their report of the pro- 
ceedings of last year, and have expended about $240,000 and 
propose expending 500,000$ more the next year in disseminat- 
ing tracts, delivering lectures and prosecuting all bribery &c 
at Elections. 

The Tories were put into power by the free trade and liberal 
party, because they had no confidence in the Whigs. Hence 
Sir Robert Peel was compelled to do more than the Whigs had 
promised to do. The Whigs are now prepared to go further 
than the tories and hence the free trade and liberal party will 
support the Whigs ag* the tories. What I have labored to do 
is to commit the Whigs in favor of free trade with America 
and of a favorable arrangement of our boundary. The 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 885 

article in the Examiner, which is one of the most influential 
of the Whig papers is one step, and I propose before I leave 
to make arrangements for an active Correspondence, through 
the press, between the free trade party of England and the 
free trade party of the United States; I am to see M r Cobden 
on Tuesday for this purpose. 

As part of my arrangements M r Senior one of the ablest and 
most influential writers for the Edingburg Review has agreed 
to review your life and speeches and Judge Upshur's review 
of Judge Story's book on the Am. Constitution, 1 and M r 
MGregor has promised me that he will adopt and engraft our 
view of the Constitution and of trade in his great work which 
he is preparing under the order of the British Government 
on the Commercial systems of the World. His will be a 
standard work of great merit and altho he is not a lawyer he 
will do much in disabusing the European Public as to our 
character and institutions. 

I have written to Judge Upshur requesting him to forward 
to M r M c Gregor and M r Senior Copies of your Life and 
Speeches and of his review. It is of the first importance 
that these gentlemen shall be furnished with Copies at an 
early day, and hope that the Judge will attend to it. ...

MY DEAR SIR I have just returned from New York whither 
I went to endeavor to establish a new Press there. I am 
assured that it will go into operation next week: but I fear it 
will not have the means to employ such talent as to make it 
very useful. I went also to Richmond, and we have arranged 
that M r . Greenhow is to come here so soon as his place is sup- 
plied in Petersburgh. Neither here nor at New York was 
any thing done before I came. Next week, I propose starting 
the Spectator as a tri-weekly Paper, I being the sole writer in 
it. I suppose you receive it, and see what I have done in it. 

In New York our friends are very firm. If they can get 
up a vigorous press there we will accomplish a great deal. 

1 Petersburg, 1840. 



886 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Last week without an effort we carried 9 out of the 17 wards, 
for nominating Candidates to the Legislature Sh'ff &c. Our 
side is moving I think both in that City and in New England. 
I saw also men from the interior of N. Y. A Press will 
shortly be set up in Utica. One is apt to be deceived from 
hearing only from one side, but I am strongly of opinion that 
we are gaining and M r V. B. is loosing ground. We will 
carry the District system in Connecticut, and may succeed in 
postponing the action of the approaching Convention in that 
State. Watterson was here last Week and had a long con- 
versation with Johnson, and the result is, that he has written 
to Polk that Johnson will take the Vice Presidency on V. B. 
Ticket. The rumour here to Day is also that Webster and 
Clay are again friends and Webster is to run as V. P. on 
Clay's Ticket. The Old Swiss is bought up again by the 
[illegible]. But this is not certain altho' likely. 

If my views of the State of things are correct, it will not 
be wise to scale off from the Democratic or even V. B. Party. 
It appears to me so plain that M r V. B. cannot be elected, 
that a few months must convince stupidity itself. If he per- 
sists in his method of organizing the Convention, it will 
require no great effort to kill him. He will do that himself, 
and if it is necessary for us to do it, it will be time enough to 
take our way of doing it, when the time arrives for doing it. 
It is equally clear, that altho we can destroy him, we cannot 
succeed ourselves without M r V. B. friends. We have not 
yet reached the popular mind with our reasons for opposing 
a Convention, by a Consolidated State Representation. We 
must have their ears: that when we move off we may move 
with power, and have the estimation of all impartial men, 
instead of violent prejudice to battle with. Hence I am for a 
moderate but firm tone. Fair and repeated discussion of prin- 
ciples. Repel attacks but do it in such a way as to show we 
are on the defensive and rather from our tone than from our 
words let them understand where we will be found. Much 
[talk] of our future course in or out of the Convention will be 
wrong. Some of our friends 1 think have gone too fast in 
this respect. It will be time enough when the Convention is 
to meet to determine first whether we will go into it and sec- 
ond what we will do in it. In my opinion, it is by no means 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 887 

improbable that at this time M r . V. B. will be no Candidate 
Cass will then be the most formidable Man. If he would 
consent to take the V. P. it would be the best arrangement. 
1 have rec d . proposals to that effect. What say you to it? 

I am urged to return home to see my new Constituents 
this fall and I am told that if I do not I may be opposed in the 
next election. My answer has been, that it was my design to 
visit my Constituents this fall; but that I am satisfied that I 
am here doing them more service than by going to see them. 
If they will not believe this, they may turn 'me out, if they 
please. I shall stay here and work in their cause and the 
cause of the Country.

From R. B. Rhett. c. c. 

Washington, Oct 16" 1843 

MY DEAR SIR I find I will be compelled to leave this City 
and go home to bring M rs Rhett, and I think I had better do it 
at once, so that I might be able to return the sooner, before 
the meeting of Congress. 

The late Elections have very clearly shown that the Whigs 
are very powerful so powerful as to render it pretty clear 
that Clay will beat Van Buren. Webster it is now well under- 
stood will sink hack into the Whig Party, and they will be 
united. If Van Buren is run, Clay will beat him any how; 
but with the divisions and lukewarmness, (if no worse occurs) 
which must necessarily follow a nomination by a Convention 
constituted as M r V. B's friends propose, it will be desperate 
folly, to attempt to run him. And yet if they persist in their 
method of organisation, and we oppose or seceed from the 
Party, it is clear you cannot be elected; for, there are suffi- 
cient V. B. Men in all the States, with the Whigs, to defeat us. 
Indeed, if you were to get the nomination in the present tern- 



888 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

per of M r V. B.'s friends, it would be useless, for I am satisfied 
they would stand aloof and see us beaten. Van Buren cannot 
succeed without us, and we cannot succeed without his friends. 
Neither in their present mood will allow the other to succeed; 
whilst we are conjointly too weak, to carry the election with 
a nobody like Cass, or even Buchanan. You are the only Man, 
who can beat Clay in the South, and the carrying of the South 
has usually been the Presidency. As things now look, there 
appears to me to be but one method for the Democratic Party 
to succeed, and that is, each portion of the Union running the 
man most popular in each Section. Clay's chance is decidedly 
the best for the next President. 

All this mischief has arisen from M r . V. B. allowing himself 
to be used by others who in flattering his vanity and ambition, 
were only using him to keep you down. He will fail; and 
prove himself to be the heaviest curse of the Party. Had he 
not stepped in the way, the whole [Atlantic ?] board would 
have united on you, and we would have known none of the 
divisions which are the strength of the Whigs. 

I shall not leave here until Friday, and hope before I leave 
here, to hear something definite from M r . Greenhow, who is 
waiting for a fit person to take his place. In the mean time 
I have written to Hunter and Maxcy to aid M r . Hunt until I 
return, but to tell you the truth I calculate but little on either 
of them, to contribute to the Paper. 

The next Congress will be a very agitated one, and will 
doubtless affect powerfully the Presidency. If the Democrats 
would play the free trade policy boldly out, and sustain the 
Texas question and run you; we can succeed. The Zealots 
at the North will oppose Clay because from the South, and in 
the South you would beat him on the Tariff question, espe- 
cially if his friends oppose the modifications which we propose, 
as they will. But I fear there is little hope of such a combi- 
nation of wise results. The probability is, dissension and 
defeat. 

Remember me kindly to M r . Clemson and believe me

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 889 

From 7 y /w//r/.v W. Pickens. c. c. 

Charleston Sunday Morning, Oct. 22, 1843. 
MY DEAR SIR On my arrival here day before yesterday 1 
found your friends in some excitement. I heard that you were 
determined to refuse immediately to go into a convention at all, 
and that you desired the central Com. here to take the stand 
openly unless N. York receeded from the Syracuse Conven- 
tion &c. &c. I saw Elmore, Boyce, Conner, Gadsden, Gour- 
din, Aster &c. &c. but could get nothing very definite or certain, 
except they seemed to be in confusion. Elmore then shewed 
me a letter from Rhett at Washington, in which the first sen- 
tence was, ' ' I entirely disapprove of the course advised by 
M r . Calhoun and M r . Maxcy," and then goes on to give excel- 
lent advice and full of good sense according to my judgment, 
but I could not understand what yours and Maxcy's advice 
was, and Elmore could not tell me, only that he understood it 
was to refuse to go into convention &c. &c. This was all 
strange to me. Rhett is to be here to-day and Elmore is to 
have us all together to-morrow to consult freely. I think 
nothing ought to be done decisive until Congress meets and 
let every friend of ours be on the ground at least 5 days before 
the meeting and let them consult together freely, and give the 
most authentic information as to the true state of things in 
their different States. My own opinion is that we ought to 
give up the Speakership if we can get the Printer in the 
present state of the country it is more important to us. But 
I would give up neither unless they would liberally and cor- 
dially give to us the Printer. It will strike a decided blow 
at the Globe and Enquirer. If they will not agree, then push 
Lewis or I would still rather take a Buchanan Speaker, if 
they will act with us and the Whigs and give us the Printer. 
But I fear Lewis might not like this, as I hear he is eager for 
the Speakership. But of one thing I am sure the most de- 
cided move ought to be made at the opening of Congress. 
And in the consultation tomorrow I shall take decided 
grounds agst. doing anything final at present, but wait the 
meeting of Congress. I think Clay is stronger than he was. 
I have no idea that any portion of the Whigs will ever 
support you as long as there is the slightest chance for him. 



890 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I have just seen Col. Hansen from Milledgeville. He was 
with Berrien day before }^esterday at Savannah, and has re- 
cently been all through Geo. You know he is Whig but 
personally a friend of yours. He says that State will un- 
doubtedly go for Clay, and that the Democratic party are 
split and that a new convention will be called and nominate 
Y. Buren &c. I reed a letter from Col. I. W. Hayne of 
Montgomery and also one from J. M. Calhoun the other day. 
They both say that they think the Democratic party will nomi- 
nate V. B. this Winter at Tuscaloosa. Now this may come 
from their fears and their peculiar position. 

If N. York acts upon what our friends have moved there 
that is to elect Dist. Representatives to the Convention this 
will bring up the Question directly, and we may have a 
separate Dist. Convention, but I hardly think it will ~break the 
organization of the Deinocratic party and will only throw off 
our own State. The consequence may be to give us also N. 
Ca., at least to keep it from Y. B., but this would not take 
you to the house. I think it very probable it might elect 
Clay. 

Do tell M r . Clemson that D r . Geddings tells me there will 
be no vacancy in that Professorship and that he would always 
be pleased to aid him when an opportunity occurs. 
In great haste but Truly 

F. W. PICKENS.

DEAR SIR. As we understand that ^you are a candidate for 
the Presidency at the ensuing Election; and as the Latter Day 
Saints (sometimes called Mormons, who now constitute a nu- 
merous class in the school politic of this vast Republic), have 
been robbed of an immense amount of property, and endured 
nameless sufferings by the State of Missouri, and from her 
borders have been driven by force of arms, contrary to our 
National Covenant, and as, in vain, we have sought redress,

by all constitutional, legal, and honorable means, in her courts, 
her Executive Councils and her Legislative Halls; and as we 
have petitioned Congress to take cognizance of our sufferings 
without effect, we have judged it wisdom to address you this 
communication, and solicit an immediate, specific, and candid 
reply to What will be your rule of action, relative to us, as

Magistracy.

From James Hamilton. c. c. 

Milledgeville Nov 21 st 1843. 

MY DEAR SIR, On my arrival at this place I found a most 
unfortunate state of things in regard to the Democratic Party, 
which is broken routed and disunited. The Old Union Flank 
of the party attribute their defeat to your friends bringing 
forward the nomination at the June Convention and selecting 
Cooke instead of some on& from their own ranks. The truth 
is the old Unionists are deeply tainted with Van Burenism, 
and if some means are not taken to unite the party it can 
never be rallied again by its old Leaders. I think the party 
is panic struck with their overwhelming Defeat here. 1 
can find but one man in the right spirit and that is Howard. 
We have both written for M c Allister who has more influence 
with the Union portion of the party than any Man in Georgia, 
to come here and consult with us what it may be best to do. 

The District System will be engrafted on the Constitution 
of Georgia in the composition of the Senate and H. of R. and 
for the Congressional Representation. The Democrats have 
called a Convention to meet here on the 2 cl Monday in Dec. 
expressly iji reference to the Presidential election. The Van 
Buren Men desire by its means to reconfirm the present Dele- 
gates to the Baltimore Convention but to leave them unfettered 
by instructions to vote for you, but to vote as they deem best 
at the Convention. Howard and your friends will of course if 
they are strong enough come out with an open nomination of 



892 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

yourself or if this cannot be carried Refer the choice of new 
Delegates to the Districts which the Amendment to the Con- 
stitution will lay off. I have advised this latter course most 
strenuously because I know that it is more in conformity with 
your own views Connecticut and N. H. having gone against 
us and M r . Van Buren's triumph in N. Y. have disheartened 
t your friends exceedingly in this State, and with the exception 
of Howard and a few other staunch spirits the opinion seems 
to be gaining ground that you ought to withdraw, which I 
have discountenanced with utter scorn as a pusillanimous 
retreat before even the Battle is commenced. Judge Colquitt 
1 am sorry to say seems to incline to this opinion that he 
doubted if Dick Johnson runs whether you would be one of 
the three highest to go into the House, and if you did go in, 
he thought you could get no other than the States that sent you 
there. In other words that in the House Van Bur en had already 
a majority secured or if not, that Clay would be elected. By 
retiring Colquit thinks in 4 years you would be the Man chosen 
by the people of the IT. S. above all other Candidates if you 
were now to make yourself so acceptable to the Democracy as 
to withdraw from distracting it any further. As I regard 
such a retrograde movement as not tq be entertained which 
would be construed as resulting rather from a source of weak- 
ness than a Magnanimous concession to your opponent M r 
Van B. who has no right to ask or expect it at your hands I 
have set my face resolutely against your backing out as had 
our friend Howard. The truth is My Dear Sir the demo- 
cratic party of Geo composed as it is [is] not worth the paper 
on which its obituary might be written and what is the 
Democracy of the Union to which your friends have linked 
you ? An immense mass of ignorance moved by the necessary 
Momentum of Knavery I never believed the Leaders and 
organs of the party would have the public vertue and dis- 
cernment to select you as their Man. Your friends have com- 
mitted a great and fatal mistake in committing you to the 
Democracy and of bringing you out eo nomine under its ban- 
ner. You should have stood on your own ground as a Wai- 
Republican of 1812. and in your place in the Senate still have 
been at the head of a Great Southern party. I believe this 
Session of Congress would have not passed without you having 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 893 

a Republican party around you which would have given you 
a primary strength not inferior to your Competitors. But 
they have attempted to bind you hand and foot and to throw 
you in the midst of an old subtle and implacable foe, the 
Old Jackson party of the Kitchen and Bed Chamber happily 
uniting the morals of Kendal with those of M rs Eaton. I was 
cursed by your friends for my London Letter. I wrote it I con- 
fess to you to give you a Platform to Stand upon in this coming 
contest which I knew you could only occupy with strength on 
some Middle ground, which your Speech in 1835 on the Cur- 
rency and your last Speech on the Tariff most amply afforded. 
If we had had a distinct party formed between the extreme 
restrictive rigor of M r Van Buren school which means hypoc- 
racy covering licentiousness and the extreme licence of M r 
Clays, I believe the Country might have been carried under 
the lead of your genius and public vertue. But it is too late 
now. Your friends have brought you out as a Democrat and 
under that Flag with a devided Empire you will have to tight. 
I have told our friends here that nothing now remains but 
to agitate and to agitate deeply and extensively. At a Meeting 
of our friends in Charleston it was agreed on my suggestion 
that we should get up a Young's Mans Convention to meet at 
Columbus Geo calling on all young men among your friends 
to hold meetings all over the South and send Delegates early 
in the Spring to that place [to] take into consideration the 
best means of promoting your election. The question was 
from what point the invitation should come for the assembly 
of such a body. It was agreed that it should not come 
from S. C. and the Season of the year forbid all hope of 
its coming from New York as Delegates would not travel 
to N. Y. during the inclement weather of the coming Winter 
and early Spring beyond which the Convention could not be 
postponed. It was agreed that if possible the invitation 
should come from Georgia which our friends will endeavour 
to effect before the adjournment of the Legislature, if it can 
be compassed with harmony and perfect concord, which can 
alone give authority to such a move. It is not to be concealed 
that the old Union part} 7 of Geo desire to repress every token 
'in your favor for fear it may prejudice Van Buren. It is 
still confidently believed in a fair issue before the people 



894 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

of Georgia you could beat any man in the U. States but 
between Clay and Van Buren it will scarcely be a contest 
as I believe the struggle all over the Union will turn out if it 
should happen that Van Buren is the Nominee of the Balti- 
more Convention. From the progress of events, I am more 
reluctant than ever to go into that "Den of Thieves." Let 
me know your own views of our best course, and whether 
you have determined on your own. My advice to you may 
be comprehended in a single sentence Stand firm and wait 
the progress of events. 

I shall leave this next week for the Chattahoochee, there 
will write fully and without reserve to Major Howard as to 
the [appearance ?] of the affairs of our party throughout the 
Union and in this State. 

Address me at Fort Mitchell (Ala) to which place I shall 
return next week prepared to give any impulse in any quarter 
you may desire. 

Having disposed of this public matter let me advert to 
another. 

Do you know that I think that our friend Howard has 
started a Question upon which the highest interests of the 
South may be involved to wit whether Texas as an integral 
part of Louisiana is not de jure now in the Union. If under 
the treaty of 1803 between France and the U. States she was 
comprehended in the Limits of Louisiana and as such was 
admitted into the Union, the Gen 1 Gov'. could not cede any 
portion of the Territory of a State without violating its ter- 
ritorial sovereignty. This was overlooked by you all in M r . 
Monroe's administration when the Florida Treaty was con- 
cluded. But no lapse of time can consecrate a Usurpation on 
the part of the Federal Gov*. If this be a true view of the 
subject, Louisiana according to Howards opinion Lpuisi a has 
nothing to do but to enter her jurisdiction over Texas and she 
is de jure and de facto in the Union. Let me hear from 
you immediately on this point. 
Ever faith' y . 

P. S. Major Howard is at my elbow since closing this Letter 
and begs me to say emphatically to you hold on. He will be 
exceedingly gratified to hear from you. 

Howard may move on the Texas question in a few days.

From Theophilus 



Portsmouth, Va. Nov. 29, 1843. 

SIR, May I dare to presume so much upon your kindness 
as to beg that you will favour me with a letter to any friend 
you may have in Europe, that you may feel at liberty to make 
me acquainted with. Should it meet your convenience and 
approbation to grant this request, you will please add to the 
obligation by addressing it to me at Washington, under cover 
to the Hon. D. H. Lewis. I expect to sail for England or 
France about the middle of December as bearer of despatches 
from our government. 

I take the liberty of forwarding you the proceedings of the 
late meeting of our district Convention, to elect a delegate, or 
delegates, to be held in Baltimore in May next. You will 
perceive that it adjourned without going into an election, in 
consequence of three of the Counties in their district, being 
unrepresented. The motion for adjournment was made and 
carried by your friends, and they have gained great credit for 
their magnanimity, as we outnumbered the Van Buren dele- 
gates more than two to one! And that too with but little 
effort on our part, while they moved earth and sea to pack the 
Convention with their exclusive friends. We shall lose 
nothing by adjourning, as Princess Anne and Surrey Counties 
will elect delegates friendly to yourself, and the other (South- 
ampton) will, it is thought, do the same. The votes of the 
Counties will stand in the Convention: 



Calhoun. 

Norfolk County 2 

Norfolk borough 1 

Isle of Wight 1 

Nansemond 1 

Surrey 1 

Princess Anne . . .1 



Van Buren. 

Sussex 1 

Doubtful. 
Southampton 1 



I very greatly fear that the Convention at Baltimore will 
be anything rather than a true exponent of public opinion. 
Indeed I have feared this from the very first, as M r . Pickens 



Theophilus Fisk was an editor in southeastern Virginia, and a prominent supporter 
of Calhoun in that region. 



896 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

and M r . Lewis can both testify. Knowing the trading poli- 
ticians who draw the wires for M r . Van Buren, as well as I do, 
I could not trust them so far as to meet them in Convention; 
this made me so anxious to unfurl your banner " subject 
only to the decision of the American people." I ventured to 
do this; it met the approbation of all our friends here; but 
other papers devoted to your interest thinking it best to say 
"subject to the Baltimore Convention" I very reluctantly 
yielded my preferences. I hope that your friends will never 
again consent to submit their claims to an}- other body than 
the sovereign people. 

We have gained a very considerable accession to our num- 
bers by the "Tjder meeting" which was held here some six or 
eight weeks ago. The Clay and Van Buren men united and 
established a new paper here in opposition to the "Old Domin- 
ion;" to counteract their base designs, your friends united 
with those who were friendly to M r . Tyler and held a large 
public meeting the proceedings of which have been so basely 
misrepresented by the Whig papers, as being of an unf riendly 
character to yourself. These gentlemen continue to act with 
us in good faith, and will do so at the polls, when they see 
that there is no hope of his re-election. 

Pardon the libert}^ I have taken and believe me 
With the highest respect your ob't sev't

Tulip Hill West River, 3 rd Dec. 1843. 

MY DEAR SIR, I duly received } T our letter of the 14 th Nov. 
some da}-s ago and should have gone over immediately ta con- 
sult with M r . Rhett on the expediency of a congressional con- 
sultation for the purpose of preventing a split in the party, but 
circumstances occurred which prevented my doing so. I have 
concluded therefore to present the conclusions to which my 
mind has been brought by a view of the past. It would not 
be safe to go into any convention, however formed, with the 
Richmond and Albany politicians. And it would not be con- 
sistent with principle to give countenance to an} 7 one, not 
formed on the District System, and as there is no reason to 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 897 

expect that the friends of M r . V. B. will alter their course in 
regard to this, it appears to me that you ought at some 
period what period future events must decide to publish, 
thro' the medium of a letter to a friend written for publica- 
tion or in some other mode, your reasons for determining not 
to produce division by allowing your name to be presented 
before a convention, formed in whole or in part on any other 
plan than a direct representation of the people in Districts. 
Such a course would, place you higher than ever before the 
country, which is getting sick of Caucus or Convention Dicta- 
tion, and preserve your lofty name and character as a rallying 
point in the future, whereas if you went into the convention 
and should be rejected, as you undoubted!}- would be, it would 
lower your character and destroy in a great measure the influ- 
ence of your name in rallying the good men of all parties, 
when a new organization of parties shall take place as it will 
undoubtedly do after M r . Clays term is out. I say after M r . 
Cla} r 's term is out: for such is the dissatisfaction and ill feel- 
ing now produced in the different portions of the Republican 
party by the base fraud which has procured every one of the 
nominations of V. B. that I do not believe that if he should 
be withdrawn even you could be elected. The treachery of 
the V. B. men would produce your defeat, if nothing else. I 
do not think that any consultation of the Republican Members 
of Congress would do any good. A majority of them are for 
Van B. and determined I believe to persevere as they have 
begun. Our friends in New England have greviously misled 
us and painful as it is to say so, yet as I feel it a sacred duty 
of friendship to give my opinions without reserve, it does 
appear to me, that there is nothing left but to decide how you 
should be withdrawn so that you may be preserved for the 
country in future. There is one event and but one, it appears 
to me, that can alter this state of things and that is, the 
immediate calling up of the Texas question, which may pos- 
sibly unite the South and by weakening Clay bring the South- 
ern candidate into the house. Whether this will take place or 
not cannot be known before the meeting of Congress, a day 
or two after which I will go over to Washington and write 
you again. 

Faithfully yours, V. MAXCY.

From E. E. Ehett. c. c. 

[Dec. 8, 1843.] 

MY DEAR SIR I told you in my last written in great haste 
and disgust that I would shortly write to you again. 

For a month before Congress met I was labouring to effect 
an organization of all opposed to M r . Van Buren, and thus 
control the elections in the House of Representatives. I 
thought, if this was accomplished, it would show such a 
decided opposition to him, as to put him out of the question 
for the Presidency. For this purpose I saw M r . Dallas 1 of 
Philadelphia the Brother in Law of Judge Wilkins, 2 and dis- 
closed to him my views. The Judge fell into our policy. 
We were to run him for Speaker, keep out of all caucusses, 
and with the Pennsylvanians and our Southern Men with the 
Johnson Men control events. Johnson who has been for 
some time in Washington fell into our views. Everything 
went on well until Ingersol and Buchanan arrived in Wash- 
ington. The former by an active and the latter by a negative 
influence, scared the Pennsylvania Delegation, and the} 7 
broke ground. Our Southern friends who were trembling 
before at the boldness and hazards of this policy, soon gave 
up also. As soon as this was ascertained on Saturday I 
returned home and wrote to you my last Letter informing 
you of this result and my determination to have nothing to 
do with the Caucus. Near Sun-set however Lewis sent a 
Gentleman with a hook to me, to beg me to return to Wash- 
ington, to consider with our friends some new measures. I 
went, and found the proposition, to force on the Caucus, the 
2/3 principle of nomination, or to seceed. To carry this, I 
was strongly urged to go into the Caucus. I consented at 
last went into the Caucus and carried it. The rest you will 
have learned from the Papers. We were obliged to stand to 
the nominations when made according to our own rule. 3 The 
Georgians tried hard to make one of their Citizens [?] clerk. 
It failed and I was glad of it. 



1 George M. Dallas, Vice- President of the United States from 1845 to 1849. 

2 William Wilkins, Secretary of War 1844-1845. 

3 The Democrats nominated and the House elected John W. Jones, of Virginia, Speaker, 
and Blair and Rives printers. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 899 

The effect of the organization of the House and indeed all 
late events bearing on the Presidency, is undoubtedly, to 
make M r . Van Buren the nominee of the Party. Indeed, if 
you could obtain the nomination, as I stated to you before, it 
would be useless in the present temper of things. The Van 
Buren people would defeat you as they did Cooper in Georgia. 
And unless the revision of the Tariff is properly supported by 
the Party, it is equally impossible for M r . V. B. to be elected. 
Our friends will undoubtedly defeat him. Our policy at 
present is, to keep things as they are. Push on our prin- 
ciples as to the Tariff and the organisation of the Convention 
and take position in future as circumstances render necessary. 
Strive to control events for good, for the present, and as to 
the future to keep you in position to be head of the Party if 
it dissolves by defeat, or should even succeed. Time will 
devellop what we shall do, and when we shall do it. We are 
going to be beaten most disastrously with M r . Van Buren; and 
I trust there will be end of the cursed and cursing influence 
of the old Jackson Clique. On you we must rally and you 
must keep yourself in position, to enable us to do so. The 
Whigs are sanguine and buoyant of success, I think with 
good reason. 

And now My Dear Sir in communicating to [you] once 
more the sad tydings of failure, I know you will appreciate 
the efforts of your friends, whilst you will probably regret 
results so far as you are concerned probably less than any of 
them. Let us cheer up our hearts with the remembrance and 
consolation, that if God regards the interests of indeviduals, 
he must much more regard the movements of Nations and 
that in him we are safe. To labour with energy and cheer- 
fulness, but to submit with humility to his decrees is the 
dictate of the truest philosophy as well as the requisition of 
our peace. You have heard of my mighty affliction in the 
loss of my Brother. In him is gone the chief personal reward 
1 looked to in my public labours lifting up this great and 
virtuous mind to a sphere of usefulness congenial to its 
powers. God has said, "I forbid it" and calls him home 
to himself. I bow 1 trust with a proper submission, and may 
I not hope, that I shall meet you hereafter, if no more on 
earth, with him, in the mansions of rest. Let me implore

you, my aged friend and political Father, seek God in Christ. 
I have found him, and you will find him also if you will seek

your temporal and spiritual welfare. That God will bless and

From Viryil Maxey. c. c. 

Washington 10 th Dec, 1848. 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote the enclosed letter a few days ago, 
but missing the hour of departure of the mail from West 
River, I brought it over here and have concluded to send it to 
you. If I write now under feelings of less discouragement, 
I do it under those of greater mortification from the events 
that have taken place here. You have no doubt received vari- 
ous accounts of them from } 7 our friends here, who partici- 
pated in them. I am glad I did not get here till after the final 
Caucus, in which your flag, tho' not struck down, as repre- 
sented by the correspondent of the Richmond Enquirer, was 
nevertheless not held up by your friends in defiance of the 
violent gale that was blowing, with the unflinching firmness it 
ought to have been, for fear as I could not have changed the 
current of things, my excitement might have led me into 
indiscretions, that might have excited the resentment and ill- 
feelings of some of our friends without doing any good, as 
my private station would have given me neither the right nor 
the opportunity at the suitable moment to interfere or remon- 
strate. 

1 have now been here four days and have been endeavour- 
ing amidst conflicting accounts, (from the desire of those who 
participated in the movements here to cast blame from them- 
selves upon others,) to find out the truth, which I believe is 
as nearly as follows. 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 901 

M r . Rhett, as he, no doubt, has informed you, had taken a 
journey to Philadelphia and New York partly with a view to 
form a coalition among the friends of the Candidates for 
nomination opposed to M r . Van Buren for the purpose of mak- 
ing M r . Wilkins speaker, who I understand without hesitation 
gave the necessary pledges in regard to Committees, the 23 rd 
rule &c. Rhett thought he had succeeded in forming a com- 
bination sufficiently strong, with the aid of the Whigs to elect 
Wilkins and to refuse to go into caucus. Among the allies 
were the Pennsylvania delegation and some of Johnson's 
friends. If all had remained firm, Wilkins would have been 
elected, but it is said that Buchanan after his arrival had not 
firmness enough to keep his friends up to the sticking point. 
Your friends then, I understand, yielded so far as to go into 
the caucus in the expectation of being able to prevent the 
election of the Van Buren Speaker by requiring f rds of the 
number to effect a nomination. The Van Buren men unex- 
pectedly agreed to this proposition and obtained the majority 
required on the first vote: thro' the aid, as Gen. Anderson 
who is here informed me, of three votes from your men, who 
from weakness dreamed of conciliation of the V. B. men to 
the last. Even our friend Lewis is charged with want of firm- 
ness in resisting the torrent, and did not, as he might have 
done, keep one or two of his delegation straight. MX Payne 
is the only name I recollect of the three, except M r . Arring- 
ton, of N Carolina, who are said to have voted for Jones. 
It was now too late to retrieve the false step of going into 
Caucus at all, and all the officers fixed on by the V. B. men 
were elected. 

Some indiscreet remarks by M r . Belser, one of your friends 
from Alabama, to the effect that ' 'constituted as the National 
Convention would be M r . Calhoun's friends had not the slight- 
est expectation of a nomination " have been the ground of the 
false representation by the correspondent of the Richmond 
Enquirer. 

The result of all has been to place you in a false position 
and make the impression on the public that you were given 
up as a Candidate and that }^our friends were disposed to fall 
in with the current in favor of V. B. One or two only, I am 
told, are suspected of a disposition to fall down and worship

Moloch but the rest are deeply mortified at the course of 
events and now would be glad if they had taken a different 
stand in the beginning. You will see from the Spectator the 
turn which Rhett is endeavoring to give of the matter with a 
view to rectify public opinion in regard not only yourself but 
of your friends' disposition to give way to the violence and 
despotism of the Albany politicians. I have given it as my 
opinion, that something more was necessary than newspaper 
declarations, and that some of those known to possess your 
confidence should come out and in their own names and con- 
tradict the false representations of surrender on the part of 
your friends and that there should be a meeting of your 
friends and an expression of opinion given by it, which should 
relieve you from the false position in which they have placed 
you. Whether anything will be done or not I cannot even 
give an opinion, but I am rather disposed to think that some* 
occasion, that may arise in some of the proceedings of Con- 
gress will be taken to set public opinion right. At first I was 
of opinion that you ought to come out in proper person and 
avow your opinions on the subject of a Convention, consti- 
tuted as it evidently will be and the impossibility of. your 
ever permitting your name to be placed before it or giving in 
any way your sanction to the protective doctrines of the 
Syracuse Convention, or their mode of forming a National 
Convention. I now think if this course had been firmly taken 
before the assembling of Congress it would have been best, 
as to do it now immediately would be attributed to the recent 
events. But my opinion now is that it would be best to wait 
until the Administration are prepared to make a communica- 
tion to Congress on the subject of Texas, which M r Upshur 
thinks will be in about three weeks, and then come out on all 
these grounds together. 

With the last Gentleman I have had several free and most 
confidential communications, with permission however to com- 
municate what I please to you. These communications have 
revived my hopes and put me in better spirits than when I 
wrote the enclosed letter. He, as well as all your friends, 
with whom I have conversed are of opinion, that convention 
nomination will still have such force, even in the Southern 
States as to preclude the hope, that a rally can be made 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 903 

against M r V.B. on the Anti-tariff protective principle alone, 
there are so many even of Southern men, who yield to the 
Doctrine of discrimination for incidental protection being 
admitted into a Revenue Tariff. It is necessary therefore to 
have some more exciting topic connected with it and this will 
be the Annexation of Texas. 

In this opinion I concur, and think that your manifesto, 
whenever it shall come out, should embrace the three topics 
of Convention, Tariff and Texas. 

M r Upshur informs me in the strictest confidence how- 
ever except to you that the terms of a treaty between him 
and the Texan Minister have already been agreed on and 
written out, and that the latter only waits for instructions 
from President Houston, which are expected in two or three 
weeks. But some of the suspicions of the treachery of this 
Houston, which you have seen circulated in the newspapers, 
it is feared, have some foundation and instructions may pos- 
sibly be refused in which case M r U. thinks the Texan Min- 
ister, convinced as he is of the almost unanimous desire of the 
people of Texas to come into the Union, may be induced to 
sign a treaty without instructions and go home and throw 
himself on the protection of the People of Texas. The Pres- 
ident is resolved that he will communicate such a treaty to 
the Congress, and if the Minister has not firmness to sign 
he will adopt some other mode of bringing the matter before 
Congress. M r Upshur is of opinion that this is the only 
matter that will take sufficient hold of the feelings of the 
South, to rally it on a southern candidate and weaken Clay 
and Van Buren so much there as to bring the election into the 
House, where the Southern States would not dare to vote for 
M r V. B. and C. This is the result I alluded too as inspiring 
the only hope I now had in the latter part of the enclosed 
letter. The President has some hopes that he may become 
that Southern Candidate. But M r U. considers you as the 
only one that can be taken up and with a view to your avail- 
ing yourself of the first moment, after the Executive com- 
munication to Congress on Texas, to place before the public 
your views on the question, that all, who concur with you, 
may at once rally upon you, you ought at once to write a let- 
ter as if in answer to one from myself making inquiries of 



904 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

you as to your opinions on the subject, in case it should come 
up, which letter I should at once publish after the Communica- 
tion by the Executive should be made, for which purpose 
he would write me as to the time of coming over to Wash- 
ington to have the letter published. 

I beg to say, that I mention my own name as the person to 
be written to, simply because M r Upshur did, tho' I think it 
would be better to choose some more conspicuous person for 
your correspondent. I will only add, that if you choose to 
address it to me, I beg you to believe I shall fear no conse- 
quences of proscription in consequence of my name being 
identified with this subject as well as the others I have above 
suggested to you to join with them as it is possible may be 
the case with some of your more important and more ambi- 
tious friends, who I have heard with grief and mortification 
have yielded to the idea of your running on the ticket with 
Y. B. as Vice President, in order to secure the successor- 
ship ! ! ! The first wish of my heart is to see you President 
but I would rather see you lose a dozen Presidencies, were 
it possible, than to see the high honors of your great and pure 
name brought down so low and tarnished by -such a polluting 
association. No : the more bold and lofty the ground you take 
the better and the better chance you will have [of] forming a 
rallying point in better times for the virtue of the country. 

I bad a number of other things to say, but the time has 
come for my going to the rail road by which I go to Annapolis 
this evening on my way home. General Anderson is here, 
who concurs in all my views and would have written to you but 
from an injury to his hand which disables him from doing it. 

With kindest regards, with those of my daughter M rs Markoe 
to M rs Calhoun and yourself I remain 
faithfully yours

MY DEAR SIR At the instance of a mutual friend I venture 
to drop you a line, not to speak of the chances, calculations,

LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 905 

and chapter of accidents of a presidental election, (for these 
I have very little appetite) , but to remind 3^011 of a conversa- 
tion we had nearly a year since on a subject, which, as I then 
predicted, is beginning to attract general and deserved atten- 
tion. I allude to the annexation of Texas to our Union. I have 
not doubted for some time that this question would soon assume 
a practical shape and that its results would ultimately (if not 
immediately) enure to the peace, perma[ne]nce and prosperity 
of the Union. If the question were free from some prejudices 
(which by the way apply with equal force to a portion of the 
Union as it is) it would not be approached for a moment as 
one of only local importance. It is indeed a great American 
question and involves the first principle of American indepen- 
dence. The efforts of European powers which have been or 
may be made to establish an influence in Texas prejudicial to 
our commercial interests, and republican institutions, will 
probably aid in giving to this question a national aspect some- 
what sooner than could be hoped from its intrinsic merits. 
You remember I asked you last winter to turn your mind to 
this subject in all its bearings and to be read}^ to meet it. As 
a Candidate for public favor, I would not have you or any 
other to be committed on this question in advance. I do not 
therefore approach you as one of those now in the public eye 
as candidates for the chief magistracy, but as an illustrious 
citizen, whose opinions would derive no additional force from 
any station, as I believe they would not be influenced by a 
desire to obtain it. I have no doubt you have bestowed much 
reflection on this particular subject. While I am not at 
liberty (nor am 1 informed) to speak of the precise state of 
this question at present, I will say to you that negotiations 
have been commenced, the object of which is to annex Texas 
to the Union. On a question of such magnitude, it is not 
meet, that a voice, which for more than thirty years has been 
heard with so much interest on all public questions, should be 
silent. I will esteem it a favor, and so will many others, if 
you will give us the benefit of your counsels now. They shall 
be regarded as confidential, if you chuse, or otherwise. You 
are familiar with the negotiations, correspondence, &c 
between our government and Spain from 1805 to 1819, with 
regard to the boundaries of Louisiana under the treaty with 



906 AMEKIOAN HISTOKICAL ASSOCIATION. 

France. The effect of annexation on the interests (domestic 
and foreign) of our country, however, is the point to which 
public attention will be chiefly directed. The test will be 
practically applied, whether the compromises of the constitu- 
tion are to be regarded, or the union to be endangered by 
violating rights secured under the compact of 1787. 

Excuse this liberty, I beg you, and allow me to subscribe 
myself 

with sincere esteem and very high consideration 
Your friend &c 

THOMAS W. GILMER. 



From R. M. T. Hunter. c. c. 

(Private) Loyds Essex Dec r . 19 th 1843 

MY DEAR SIR Since my last to you I have learned from 
Washington from a source entirely reliable, that a treaty for 
the annexation of Texas will probably be submitted to the 
Senate this Winter. Nothing but Houston's refusal can pre- 
vent it (as I am informed) and it is supposed that he dare not 
refuse. He will probably impose the condition upon the 
Texian minister that there shall be a probability of its ratifica- 
tion in our Senate. Van Zandt the present representative of 
Texas in Washington is anxious for the treaty and will proba- 
bly be easy to satisfy that there is a chance for its ratification. 
These things I was requested to communicate to you conceal- 
ing the name of my authority which is entirely unneccessary 
as you will readily guess it. It is thought to be a matter of 
great importance by the administration, as I suppose it is, to 
do all that is possible to secure the Senate. Of the effects of 
such a measure both as to principles and men you will be 
better able to judge than I can be. It will be something if 
we can really make an issue with the antislavery feeling and 
arouse the public mind to its importance. Can this be done? 
will not the Presidential Election absorb it and will not Ritchie 
et id omne genus do all that they can to give the question the 
"go by" and divert public attention from it? If it could be 
made one of the real issues of the day I think I foresee many 
consequences to flow from it which will be interesting to you 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 907 

in more than the public point of view. Would it not force 
you again upon the theatre of public action let the question 
terminate as it might? Could the South look to any other 
man to conduct it through such a crisis ? 

I learn orally that the Ritchie wing of the Democracy affect 
to be anxious for you to be placed on the V B ticket as Vice 
President. Some of their papers hint at the same thing. 
Perhaps I ought not to make any conjectures as to the mean- 
ing of all this. I am too remote from the active theatre of 
public affairs to form reliable opinions, but I suspect that 
there is no friendly design in these intimations. Benton 
and Wright would neither be willing to see you V P and 
Ritchie would not move against their wishes. He would not 
elect you if you really desired it, (which I am far from pre- 
suming to be the case) if he could in any other manner secure 
V B. The danger I fear is to bring down upon you the 
jealousies of the other aspirants Johnson Buchanan Cass Polk 
&c &c and to prevent any combination between their friends 
and yours. The V B men begin to be afraid that they have 
pushed things too far in the recent organisation. Speaker 
printer clerk and even doorkeeper all, all have they grasped 
and now frightened at the prospect of reaction they wish to 
soothe your friends by an act of pretended friendship which 
will at this hour render all the candidates for the V Presi- 
dency and all the expectants of the Presidency after the next 
term more jealous of you than of V B. They have coquetted 
with Polk until they have killed him and now they strike at 
higher game. Perhaps after all these suspicions are too 
refined. It may be that they really desire such a combination 
to secure V B's reelection but I doubt them. 

The course of things in Washington has dispirited our 
friends at a distance very much. 1 have been asked the rea- 
son but having heard nothing from Lewis or Rhett since the 
commencement of the session I have nothing to give but sur- 
mises. I suppose that the friends of Buchanan and Johnson 
being unwilling to oppose the majority of the party in any- 
thing, our friends thought it useless and imprudent to make 
an unavailing contest and thus draw down upon themselves 
the whole odium of the division. 



908 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

And yet as it is I fear their course has driven all the timid 
and wavering of our friends into the arms of Van Buren. 

Unless some explosion should take place in Congress to 
arouse the South I fear that V B will get the nomination from 
a convention constituted on his own terms and I suppose the 
resistance which he will experience in the part}^ will be rather 
passive than active. Such seems to me to be the present tend- 
ency of events. In this view of the case I look to the probabls 
future course of public affairs with deep despondency. I 
have struggled for the South and for what I believed to be 
the true interest of my native state, not long it is true but 
through the best years of my life and I have had an uphill 
time of it even at home. I have not regarded the difficulty 
on my own account but it is a source of the deepest mortifi- 
cation to me to see the hands into which Virginia is about to 
fall. 

I hope that your contemplated book goes bravely on and I 
assure you that I contemplate with the greatest pleasure the 
prospect of such a monument as I hope it will rear to your 
fame. 

Yours, truly 

R M T HUNTER 

The antislavery men in Washington are supposed to be in 
entire ignorance of the move in relation to Texas. Nor are 
there more than two men in Congress informed of the real 
state of the case. I mention these facts to you that you may 
be guarded in your communications to your friends. The 
Administration is anxious (I am informed) that nothing should 
be known of the movement in Washington until the Treaty is 
made.

MY DEAR SIR I have just rec d . yours of the 3 rd . inst for- 
warded to me from Charleston. I have not been to the city 
since I met Lieut. Calhoun. I was taken next day with grippe 

1 The address discussed in this and several subsequent letters is that which is printed 
in Calhoun's Works, VI, 239-254. Upon it and the changes made in it, see, besides the

and prostrated for several days and since then have been here 
much engaged in private affairs, which have harrassed me 
exceedingly and incapacitated me for almost everything. 1, 
as soon as I was able to attend to it, inclosed your address to 
Co 1 . J'on, M r Gourdin and M r Boyce. The two latter only 
were in town. M r . Gourdin writes me that he took out and 
read letters from Gen 1 M C D and M r Rhett to me after reading 
your address which has been submitted to the Delegation. 
They approve your withholding y r name from the Convention 
and think you should publish the address with some modifica- 
tions what he does not say. I have a letter from Lewis of 
the same date as yours begging me earnestly, if your address 
is not published to stay till I hear from you as he had written 
very fully to you giving his views as to an important modifi- 
cation. I had in my letter to the Committee in Charleston 
taken the same view expressed by M r Lewis. I send you as 
he requests his letter, begging you to send it back to me when 
you have read it with your views. The address I expect to 
find in proof when I get down tomorrow. I wrote to M r . G. 
that I hoped the Committee would be in the City by that time 
and we could have a meeting. His letter to me was dated the 
6 th . and mine in reply went next day to him. He told me that 
M r Boyce was the only one of the Committee in the City since 
he rec d . the address. He and M r Boyce seemed to express the 
same opinions that Lewis has stated so strongly. 

It will not I trust be out of place to express to you the 
impression made on my mind in one respect by the address. 
It is liable to be used by M r . V B.'s friends to your disad- 
vantage with the party and to be made the means of holding 
you up as the cause of that defeat which the} r are bringing on 
themselves. You know there are some of their Leaders who 
hate you and who have the control of their presses. No sense 
of justice or fairness will restrain them and the fire you have 
poured out upon their selfish unprincipled conduct and treach- 
ery they will convert into attacks on the Party, and before 
you and your friends can stem the torrent, they will have 
raised up such a current against you, that you will be dis- 
carded by thousands who are honest and who are truly your 
friends. The grounds you have taken in withdrawing your 
name from the Convention are such as your friends will sus- 



910 AMEKICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

tain in all their extent if you decide on them and yet I think 
they would as far as I have the means of ascertaining, be more 
pleased that you should take a course which will not endanger 
you with the mass of the Democratic Party one which will 
give you all the strength of your present course without sub- 
jecting you to any fair or plausible charge of having broken 
them down. The ground Lewis suggests I confess strikes me 
as the best and under my present opinions 1 think it would 
give you a position of great power perhaps the intire Con- 
trol of the matter. 

L*. Calhoun in some sort misapprehended me in one partic- 
ular the Tariff proceedings were only a part of developments 
subsequent to your writing which I thought might have com- 
manded your attention the Abolition and Texas questions 
were also referred to. They are every day assuming so 
important a position in politics, and the Course of certain of 
our professed friends has been such that they or the first of 
them at any rate, I thought should have been treated of in 
your address. 1 intended to have written to you next day, 
but the attack 1 was subjected to was first confined to my head 
and eyes and was so painful and depressing that I was unable 
to do anything and fearing too much delay as soon as I was 
able I inclosed the papers to the Committee for their action. 
This was prevented by the intire absence of the Committee. 

I go down in the morning. A few days more will make no 
great difference and if I don't hear from you in consequence 
of Lewis' letter, (which I suppose you have had before this,) 
when I get down, I will propose to the Committee to wait even 
a few days more, having the address in type to be ready the 
moment we hear from you for any course. 

I write this immediately on receiving yours and M r . Lewis' 
letters to night, after a day of much fatigue and in so desul- 
tory a way as nothing but the urgency of the occasion will 
excuse. 

If M r . Clemsen is with you do say to him I will answer his 
letter from Charleston.

From F. II. Elmore. 

Jany 13, 1844 

MY DEAR SIR I have but a moment to drop you a line. 1 
will endeavor to morrow or next day to do more. 

I was detained a day in Columbia longer than 1 expected 
when 1 wrote you by indisposition. I got down in miserable 
weather. I found no members of the Committee in Town 
except M r . Bailey, Gourdin, Boyce and Frost. Gen 1 Hamilton 
was here and I met M r Bee on the road who told me of it. I 
saw him immediately, and last night we got all we could of 
the Committee with Gen. Hamilton, M r . Furman, Mazyck and 
[Prioleau?] together and read your address. They were told 
of M r . Lewis Letters and there were before them some rec d . 
from other quarters. I send you one from M r . Campbell, 1 and 
one from Gen 1 Green. From MDuffie and Rhett we also 
heard. The substance of their letters was that beyond the So 
Ca Delegation and a very few others, to nominate and run you 
ags*. the Baltimore Convention w d . produce such an irrecon- 
cileable breach with the Democrats that you would lose many 
very many of them who are warmly and truly yours. That 
you would lose in all respects a position which may yet be one 
of controlling power even on the adjustment of the Tariff at 
this Session. They do not say so but from the tenor of their 
letters I think both of them w d . rather that you should post- 
pone the publication of your address until the Course of the 
party shall be more definitely fixed. 

Of your friends here, none will fail to stand up to what- 
ever Course you adopt. If you publish at once or postpone 
as it is or with alterations I believe you may count on their 
standing by you. At the same time, however, they direct me 
to say to you that they feel a great reluctance to your taking 
any position, which is not necessary, that will cut you off 
from the next Canvass. They partake greatly of the feeling 
of M r Campbell. They think if any act of Providence should 
before the election open a way to the Presidency for you, 
that you should not by any step not absolutely called for, put 
a barrier in your way. That if M r V B is defeated, as he in 



1 Presumably John A. Campbell of Georgia. See his letters of November 20 and December 
20, 1847, post. 



912 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

all probability will be, that to you the party will surrender, 
if you have not before hand made that impossible that in 
your hand they may be purified and victorious and that you 
with them may restore the purity of the Government. Under 
these Circumstances, five of the seven present, and Boyce to 
day added his vote, concurred in directing me to say to you 
that if you could reconcile to yourself to decide not to pub- 
lish at present your reasons, but simply to withhold your 
name from the Convention, promising or not your reason 
hereafter, and stating that you would be governed by circum- 
stances hereafter in their conduct as to your support of the 
Party, that it would perhaps be best. But as 1 said before, 
if you say otherwise the paper will be ready for the press the 
moment you say so. 

If it is to be published they also suggest that you allow 
some of those portions which may be considered as bearing 
to strongly on individuals and the party where it will not 
weaken or alter the argument, and may prevent the miscon- 
ceptions that your enemies will endeavor to circulate that 
your feelings have influenced your Course. The instance 
you alluded to as to M r . Tazwells remark is one there is one 
or two which M r . Wright might feel and make the excuse for 
arraying hostility in the ranks of the party ag* you. Will 
you My Dear Sir pardon us for the freedom we take and give 
some discretion to such of your friends here as you may des- 
ignate to do this for you? I know it is a delicate point in us 
to interpose, but you may rest assured that it is only the 
strongest friendship that would venture to ask for such respon- 
sibility, and 1 would far rather that you should blame us than 
the hopes of the whole South and the Countrys welfare should 
be destroyed or even endangered. I must confess that the 
comparisons of opinions last night and the letters we have 
have even made me more fearful of the result and more anx- 
ious that you should think again before it is too late, if this 
movement may not be pretermitted or at least postponed. 
I remain as ever Yours truly 

F. H. ELMORE 

P. S. On one point more I was directed to sa}^ a word. If 
the Treasury Dept. is in a proper way tendered to you, that

you might accept it. By a proper way is understood such a 
way as would put the Gov*. in your control. A year is a short 
lease, but in that time you could do much to give spread to 
your principles, exhibit your policy, see, and give consistency 
to the action of your friends in short prepare a harvest here- 
after without violating any of the rules you have prescribed 
for yourself as a public man.

From Eustis Prescott. 

New Orleans 15 th . Janr y 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR You will undoubtedly ere this have seen the 
proceedings of our State convention, declaring that the first 
choice of the people of this state for President, is M r Van 
Buren; my object in now addressing you is to express my 
firm conviction that such is not the fact, altho it is very diffi- 
cult to ascertain popular feeling in so scattered a population, 
and 1 am confident that conventions are rarely fair exponents 
of the public will. One fact I have ascertained, that you are 
the first choice of a majorit}^ of the Democratic members of 
the Legislature, but I fear they have committed themselves 
by becoming members of this convention. 

I have deprecated its action from the first, but could not 
persuade your friends, many of whom are as warm in their 
attachment to you as myself, from taking part in it. From 
the onset 1 have urged an appeal to the people in the Con- 
gressional Districts to elect delegates for each direct, to the 
National convention, but some of our friends could not be 
induced to deviate from the former practice of the party, 
and a few of them are Delegates, instructed to cast their 
vote first for M r V B and next for you. 

The only good which the Convention has done for us, is an 
unanimous declaration in favor of our principles, and instruct- 
ing the delegation to sustain them in the convention; if they 
do this manfully, as I know some of them will, it may pro- 
duce discord, and change the aspect of affairs. I am satisfied 
that there is no cohesion between Northern and Southern 
Democrats, and that the friends of Free Trade will ultimately 
have to rally under their own flag, when they will receive

important strength from eastern whigs, as well as many, in 
the south and west. 

I have taken some pains to ascertain the feeling in the par- 
ishes; in one, M r V B had a majority of one, in a general 
meeting of the party, in another two, and in a third four, but 
in very few parishes was there even this test.

Loyds Essex Jan y 19 th . 1844 

MY DEAR SIR I was very glad to receive your last letter 
and you were right in your conjecture as to the cause of my 
silence. I had so little that was pleasant to tell you that I had 
not the spirit to write. I did not go on to Washington to see 
your letter because I could not well leave home at that time 
and I supposed that it was in any event to be published as 
written. I am so remote from the scene of action that I 
should scarcely confide in my own opinion upon a subject of 
so much importance as that of your letter. I was not sur- 
prised to learn that you have refused to place your name 
before the Baltimore Convention. In your strictures upon 
its probable organisation I have no doubt but that I should 
concur. The course of the New York Democrats in the 
present congress deserves to be damned by every honest man 
in the country but I fear your motives would be misconstrued 
should you give utterance to such sentiments. Upon this 
matter however I cannot judge without seeing the letter as I 
know language to be the most flexible of human instruments 
as I have often heard you say and I know also that you have 
a mode of delivering truth without offending others which is 
almost peculiar to yourself. But I confess that I think it 
safest and most prudent that in this letter you should not 
give utterance to the idea of running a separate ticket for 
yourself. Under present circumstances 1 fear that as against 
the nominee of the Convention such a ticket would not receive

may err. I am not well informed as to the state of public 
sentiment and your judgment is much better than mine. You 
doubtless have considered the question. But 1 should dislike 
very much to see your name before the people and the state 
of S. Carolina alone voting for 3^011. Your popularity is 
worth preserving not only for your own sake but for that of 
the South. To whom else shall we look for a defender? 

In the Congressional district in which I live we have suc- 
ceeded so far in preventing the party from pledging itself to 
the nominee of the Baltimore Convention. But it is the only 
district in the state in which your friends have made an 
approach to a successful fight. How long they will hold out 
here I cannot tell as the people are fast coming to the conclu- 
sion that M r V B's nomination is inevitable. In this state 
some of the leaders amongst your friends may hold off but 
the mass I think incline to support the nominee, not because 
he is the nominee of the Baltimore Convention but from their 
desire to defeat Clay. At the same time I believe that they 
will hold aloof from the Baltimore Convention. In our state 
Convention in Feb y next the V B men will probably propose 
a pledge to support the nominee of the B Conven". as a test of 
Democratic fellowship. If so there will be a split in the 
party in this state. Most of your friends will refuse any 
such pledge and attack the organisation of that convention. 
In that event a separate ticket will probably be run in this 
state. I was in Richmond ten days since. Some of the first 
young men in the state are warmly your friends undecided 
as yet as to a separate ticket, but determined to refuse a 
pledge to the nominee should an attempt be made to exact it. 
Amongst these are Seddon l Giles (a son of W in B Giles) and 
Corbie. Scott is an older man active able and zealous. Seddon 
I think inclines to a split. He says he would not propose it 
because he fears it would be fatal to your future prospects 
and he thinks it a question for your own decision only. 
Should you be willing to risk it he would not hold back. I 
have promised to attend the state convention. Our course is 
as yet undecided except as to refusing the pledge to sustain 
the Baltimore convention no matter how organised. Gordon

and Taylor I am told will give such a pledge but your friends 
generally will not do it. We hope to have a general consul- 
tation amongst our friends at that time. Should the attempt 
be made to force this pledge from us we shall issue an address 
to the people of Virginia. It will be prepared for this con- 
tingency. M r Ritchie is very angry and very arbitrary 
towards us at least his conduct would . 1 

should be very glad to hear from you before this convention. 
To meet me in time your letter ought to be directed to me 
at Richmond under cover to James A. Seddon who will take 
care of it should it arrive before or after the Convention. 
Our friends in the V a . legislature will move resolutions on 
the subject of the Tariff, the 21 st . rule and the negro petitions 
from the District of Columbia. I advised them to do so at 
once. They will move them without previous consultation 
with the V B democrats in Caucus. So much do they distrust 
them. Queries will probably be sent to M r V B to ascertain 
his opinions upon the course of the N York Democrats in the 
present Congress. 

Yours sincerely 

R M T HUNTER. 



From James Gadsden. c. c. 

Charleston S C Jany 27-1844 

MY DEAR SIR 1 have for the last 4 weeks been absent from 
the City on a visit to Florida. On my return on the 21 inst 
I heard for the first time the position in which you have been 
placed. If not anticipated, it was not unexpected. I have 
been among the few in this state, who have for the last 12 
months looked upon the movements made on the political check 
board with very great distrust. Your resignation from the 
Senate I considered a mistake. To trust Van Buren and his 
corps of political plunderers was a still greater mistake, but 
to consent to go into convention with his division of assumed 
Democrats was a fault. The issue has been, as I expected, 
and how for us advocates of Free Trade to get back to the 
position we occupied some 12 or 18 months since I confess 
is beyond my ken. Prospects then looked encouraging. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 917 

We had a little band united and moving onward. But in an 
evil hour, You retired from the only position in which you 
could then aid our cause and the one you had so long battled 
for and by intimating a willingness to ally with Traitors we 
have or may be made to suffer from their treachery. Indeed 
our Position is delicate. Professing to be Democrats we are 
accused of desertion of party; and that because we cannot 
carry our Candidate. Whatever the enlightened may think, 
the Mass believe that no other motive actuates Carolina but 
to carry her favourite, and that disappointed in securing his 
nomination before the Democratic convention, is the sole 
motive for refusing, if we do, going into that convention. 
You will understand me, I speak of what I hear, and having 
mingled much among the citizens South and West of late, I 
hear the above asserted in all quarters. It would not deter 
me however, any more than I know it will not you, for still 
adhering to our principles let the impugning of motives be what 
they may. But in adhering to we wish to see these principles 
triumph, and having got a check of late, it becomes a question 
of moment how can we recover our lost ground. Again rally 
our little Spartan band and move onward once more for 
victory. 

As things now stand, we have nothing to do with the Presi- 
dential Election. Clay will be successful but he is our open 
opponent. Van we cannot trust, and ought not to contribute 
to his success. Indeed our cause will ultimately be safer in 
his defeat than his election. Success will now secure the 
power to a party, indeed 1 may call it a faction, who have no 
principle to contend for: and who as 3^011 once said are held 
** together by the attractive cohesion of plunder." Alliance 
with them is death, their defeat is necessary to the ultimate 
triumph of our cause. But to succeed even hereafter, we 
must keep our force embodied and in the field, and encouraged 
with the hope yet of victory. To do this we must have a 
rallying point, and it is with no motive to flatter that on you 
and you alone can we rally or depend. You must return then 
to the Senate There to keep before the Community and the 
Government our principles and not permit our forces to be 
distributed between Clay and Vanburen, because they have 
no hope. It has been intimated that sh d Spencers place as 



918 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Sec y of Treas y be vacated, the tender will be made to you. 
Should this be the Case, I hope you will not hesitate in 
accepting. The Sec y of the Treasury is at this time the Gov- 
ernment. It is the place of all others which would enable 
you to bring before our People in bold relief those principles 
of free Trade for which we are contending. The shortness of 
Tylers administration may be an objection not giving time 
for such a report and its circulation as would and'must awaken 
the People of the U S. to their true interests. A People of 
all others most deeply interested in the success of free Trade. 
A Long session however, which now seems inevitable would 
give you an opportunit}^ and as Sec y of the Treasury, with 
the whole government as completely at your disposal, as if 
you were President, you might, ere a new administration 
comes in make Such an impression as to force either who 
may obtain power to come to our principles. I really hope 
you may take the view I do, of this all engrossing subject, 
and will not reject the opportunity and the position, which 
seems to me of all others at this crisis best calculated to 
restore our forces to the place they have lost and to rally us 
with renewed hope and confidence in an ultimate triumph. 
If you do not if you are resolved to remain in retirement, I 
fear nothing that } r ou can do no Manifestos or no communi- 
cation from Pendleton will stir us up, but despairing, many 
like you will go into retirement, while others wanting firmness 
to fit the high places they occupy, will rally under a pretended 
democracy and join the assumed Whigs. We Free Traders 
will literally have no party and no leader, and without an 
army and a General what cause can expect to triumph. I have 
my Dear Sir for 18 months past lookefd] with such distrust on 
events and movements, that I have rather avoided taking any 
part in the political movements: and fearing what now seems 
inevitable, I was unwilling to be committed to a support of a 
Man in whom I never have had any trust, or to a party which 
he professes to represent. Indeed it did seem to me as if 
some of our friends were blindly sacrificing every thing for 
which they professed to battle. If with present prospects 
we must disband and await future times to rally, the cause of 
Free Trade is dead, and I must confess that if we have not 
the Spirit to resist the oppressive exactions on our industry 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 919 

by the selfish restrictionists of the Country, I for one would 
convert these exactions to my benefit by demonstrating to the 
North that we have advantages in manufacturing &c fully 
equal to theirs: and that we may be both producers and man- 
ufacturers and enjoy the protection on both. But to return 
to the subject which has elicited these remarks Let me have 
your views as to the future and say how or by what means 
are the Free Traders to be kept together and encouraged in 
future efforts in their cause if they have no rallying Point 
No incentives to future action. To you we look, and I really 
hope that should M r Tyler acknowledge his inability to 
govern, by virtually resigning the Government, you will not 
decline administering it if it be but for the brief space of 
12 months. It will give you time, at all events, to throw 
before the Public and in an official form, something to think 
on, which must produce action: and will at least prove to the 
nations abroad that there is a party and no inconsiderable one 
who will rally with them in the great cause. You well said 
once " Names are nothing things every thing." The Secre- 
tary of Treasury at this crisis is virtually the President, in 
the hands of one who understands the present condition of 
our Countiy and who comprehending its great interests 
will promote them without regard to sectional and selfish 
influences. 

With a hope of hearing soon from you I remain as ever 
Your friend

From Francis WJiarton. c. c. 

Philadelphia, February 1 st , 1844:. 

MY DEAR SIR, You will receive by the present mail, or at 
all events very soon, the February number of the Democratic 
Review. l I have just glanced over the leading article, about 
which 1 have already spoken to you, but I can scarcely put it 
into your hands without expressing my sense of the inadequacy 
and feebleness of the tribute it bears. It may be of some use, 
however, among the class of politicians who have eyes, and 

1 See Calhoun's letters to Wharton, of February 4 and 22, in Part I, supra. 



920 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

see not, and hearing, but do not understand. It may be that 
a few even of the narrowest of the Albany politicians, may 
be led to read it for the sake of the magazine in which it is 
contained, and may thus be obliged to stare full in the face at 
opinions from which they have always hidden and skulked. 
I hope and trust, and I take it that my trust is not in vain, 
that the day will soon come when hiding and skulking will 
be over. The worst sign I see now, is Mr. Buchanan's 
equivocations, both about the tariff and the presidency. The 
great danger is that a few designing manufacturers in this 
city and in the coal district, will succeed in placing the repub- 
lican party in the state in a false attitude. Such a step would 
be attended with consequences almost fatal to our ultimate 
success, more however, from its reaction on the South, than 
from its local bearings. I am afraid that the friends of free 
trade in the South, the true friends, by which I mean your 
friends, will become disgusted with the vacillations and 
ignorance of many of our northern leaders, and will 
refuse to act in concert with them in matters of general pol- 
icy. Be assured that a severance of the republican party 
will be now fatal. There is not one of our great measures 
which we can carry if we refuse to accept of the qualified 
aid of even the regency politicians. They offer us their 
hand under the proviso that they are not to go beyond a cer- 
tain mark. Let us seize hold of it and see whether when we 
once get them out of their ambush, we may not commit them 
to the whole figure. M r Van Buren himself is susceptible of 
being forced, on a great emergency, to go all lengths, as the 
sub-treasury measure showed. Let us get him out of his hole, 
and then when he is fairly uncovered, he will have to fight 
fairly, or run away. If he runs away, his apostacy will be 
notorious, and he will leave us the possession of the field un- 
disputed, without the incumbrance of the feeble and treacher- 
ous alliance he has lately professed. If he really fights, he 
will fight in our cause, and for our victory . I am most anxious 
to see your expected letter. I trust and believe that nothing 
in it will have the tendency to exasperate the Northern section 
of the party. Withdrawal from the Baltimore convention I 
think is right, but I am most anxious that it should be such a 
withdrawal as will conciliate, and not repel, the aid of the 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 921 

Democratic party in the North for the subsequent campaign. 
M r V. B. is lost already Pennsylvania is tottering, the South 
is gone. If we kick him now, never will the jackalls who are 
awaiting the reorganization of the kitchen cabinet forgive us. 
I look upon the next election as his state funeral, and at such 
a ceremony, our attitude should be such as to avoid unneces- 
sary offence to the mourners who will attend his interment. 
I cannot forbear therefore, repeating my hope, a hope in 
which your friends here, I wish they were as man} r as the}" 
are warm, join to a man, that your position for [the] present 
may be such as to give the venomous and feelings 

of the Albany politicians no f [ield of exerjcise. If we would 
use them, as we hope to do, we [must] avoid ruffling them. 
With great respect, I am Yours &c

From Benjamin F. Porter. l c. c. 

Tuscaloosa 5 Feb. 1844. 

DEAR SIR, I have been wishing for some time to address 
you, but desired, first, to see what course would be taken by 
your friends in this and other states. The tame submission 
of many upon whose firmness I relied much, to the action of 
the Convention, in Alabama, has given a plain indication of 
what may be expected in the course of the Baltimore conven- 
tion. Had I been in this Convention, I would have firmly 
called upon your friends to secede, and led the way. But the 
resolutions of the Van Buren men to coerce, while still pre- 
tending to conciliate, to deceive us with frankness, were too 
well concocted to admit of opposition. You may have per- 
ceived that some of your friends in the convention, from 
different parts of the State, were selected as delegates and 
electors. I could have received this favor if I had chosen to 
connect it with promises of acquiescence in the action of the 
Convention: that is, take a Calhoun appointment with Van 
Buren instructions. I was sorry to see your friends submit- 
ting to this course. I should have indignantly rejected it. 

1 Benjamin F. Porter, born in South Carolina, was a prominent lawyer in Alabama. 



922 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The whole matter has, however, settled down to this, that 
Alabama must vote for M r Van Buren. This proposition 
settles another, to wit, that after M r Van Buren, she is bound 
to the succession of M r Benton. I know the men here so 
well, who have originated and passed this affair, I know so 
perfectly the train of circumstances and motives and opinions 
of those concerned, as to see that this event is arranged. 

Your friends here will take different steps. Some will sup- 
port M r Clay as the only course to secure a healthy action in 
Alabama: Some will remain neutral: Some support M r Van 
Buren. Whatever direction I may give my own efforts, I 
pray you be assured, I shall neither abate a tittle of the gen- 
eral principles upon which I have endeavoured to extend your 
popularity in Alabama, nor cease to admire your public and 
private character. 

The state of things in this state I have more than once 
endeavoured to inform you of; you will understand me when 
I say, the connection of one person with the Van Buren ticket, 
has effected these results. The men who to day reject you 
for M r Van Buren, will to morrow set you aside for M r Benton. 
Self interest is a powerful lever in the actions of men : And 
impels them to do often what conscience condemns. Fore- 
seeing, as I think, the arrangements made here for the future, 
I shall feel it my duty to mingle with any honorable opposition 
to defeat it; looking to the virtue of the people, under the 
direction of Providence for the success of those main princi- 
ples, on which rest the safety of our common Country. 

For the kindness with which you have received my sugges- 
tions, I return my grateful thanks. My communications have 
been governed by motives of patriotism: And I hope the day 
is not distant when my Country will feel the same enthusiasm 
in the prospect of your elevation, that I do. 

I need not say that this letter is considered due to my pre- 
vious professions in your favor; and is written in the same 
confidence with which you have received my others. 
Very respectfully Your Obt Sevt 

BENJ. F. PORTEK 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 923 

From James A. Seddon. 1 c. c. 

Richmond February 5 th 1844 

DEAR SIR Tho' not honored with your personal acquaint- 
ance I am induced to trespass on your indulgence in accord- 
ance with the request of M r R. M. T. Hunter for the purpose 
of giving a brief explanation of the course pursued by your 
friends in the late V a Convention and the motives which 
induced it. This duty I am aware could have been much 
more appropriately and ably discharged by that Gentleman 
himself but that circumstances compelled him to leave the 
city before an opportunity was afforded him of Communi- 
cating with you except by a hasty letter. Premising that 
however unknown, in profound appreciation of your abilities 
and virtues and in sincere devotion to the great principles of 
which you are alike the best exponent and ablest Champion, I 
yield to no friend or adherent you have in this State, I shall 
proceed on my assumed duty in a Spirit of the fullest candor 
and freedom. 

Your late letter reached here only the day before the ses- 
sion of our convention and it was immediately given the grave 
and anxious consideration of all your leading friends who had 
then reached the City. It was immediately perceived that 
the Juncture had arrived, when some decisive line of policy 
must be adopted, for the guidance of our friends in the 
approaching contest for the Presidency, and that on us had 
devolved the grave responsibility of determining it. With 
the noble boldness which has ever characterized your public 
Career, you had struck a heavy blow against the wretched 
system of Party organization and packed Conventions, by 
which public opinion had been so long, at the will of selfish 
cliques of interested partizans, either manufactured or smoth- 
ered, but at the same time with no less generosity, had left to 
your friends the option of taking such course as they might 
deem under the circumstances most advisable. Even before 
the receipt of your letter we had become satisfied, and the 
report of our country friends as they came in confirmed the 

1 James A. Seddon (1815-1880) was subsequently a member of Congress from Virginia, 
1845-47 and 1849-51, a member of the Peace Convention of 1861, and of the Confederate 
Congress, and Secretary of War in the Confederate Government from 1862 to 1865. 



924 AMEKICAN HISTOEICAL ASSOCIATION. 

conviction that for the present the arts and machinery of 
party leaders here as in many other States of the Union had 
proved too strong for the cause of Truth and Merit, and that 
to persist in presenting your name as a Candidate for the 
Presidency at the next Election would almost certainly result 
in present failure and the utter sacrifice of your future pros- 
pects of enlisting the whole Republican Party. It was I 
believe certainly true that your friends held in this State at 
least the balance of power and might had they deemed it wise 
or politic have prevented the vote of V a . from being cast for 
any other Republican Candidate more they could not do, nor 
indeed could they have rallied one half of those who really 
entertained a decided preference for you over all Competitors, 
for such un'der the working of a corrupt System of party organ- 
ization established for many years were the influences of hope 
and fear and the apprehensions of distraction and defeat, art- 
fully induced and pressed on the minds of the people, that in a 
""triangular contest," a large proportion of your friends would 
have been seduced or drawn from your support to that of the 
competitor sanctioned by the corrupt usages of the part} r . 
Such a result, deemed by us inevitable, would have been most 
unfortunate both for your own future prospects, with the pro- 
motion of which the best interests of the Country are identified, 
and the State rights party of which you are the acknowledged 
leader. Ever afterwards, that result would have been con- 
sidered as exhibiting the strength both of yourself and your 
cause, and such conviction however untrue would have been 
productive alike of mortification and of serious mischief in 
the future struggles of parties. It was not to be disguised 
either that notwithstanding the truckling and disgraceful 
course so justly rebuked by you of a portion of the Northern 
Democrats on the questions vital to the South of the Tariff and 
Abolition, a great majority of .your friends in this State 
thought much was to be gained in a contest between M r Cla}^ 
and any Democratic Candidate by the election of the latter, 
and much reluctance was felt to pressing any third Candidate, 
even yourself, to the extent of destroying the ascendancy of 
the Democratic party and ensuring the triumph of the Whigs. 
We all felt likewise that in the event of your being pressed 
as a Candidate and the Democratic party sustaining defeat, the 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 925 

whole odium of the result would be dextrously cast on you 
and your friends and your own weight and efficiency in the 
party as well as the great good to be obtained by the whole 
Country from your future elevation would be utterly lost 
perhaps forever. Neither we your friends, nor the South 
could endanger or sacrifice }^ou, for so long as you remain as 
a rallying point and stand ready as a leader we can inspire 
apprehensions and enforce respect and protection of our 
rights. We also felt that under the stalwart blow you had 
given to the oligarchy of political Intriguers and their infa- 
mous Machinery, they must totter, and that if time were 
given for the inculcation of the views of your letter, sanc- 
tioned by the full weight of your character as one of the 
undoubted leaders of the party, and weakened by no suspi- 
cion of personal ends, and especially if the whole prostituted 
press of the Party (the Richmond Enquirer among them) 
could be muzzled against attack upon them or their author, 
they must be in another contest with 3^ou as a leader, utterly 
subverted. This was an end of immense importance, involv- 
ing restoration of purity in the practical exercise of the 
elective franchise and release from infamous party thraldom 
to the country and ourselves, and to attain it, we were willing 
to make some sacrifice. 

All these considerations, as you will readily perceive my dear 
Sir, inclined most of your friends to acquiesce in the pain- 
ful necessity of relinquishing for the present the cherished 
hopes of elevating you for the Presidency, but opposed to 
such a course were all the predilections of our nature; our 
deep and ardent admiration of your talents, our devotion to 
your principles and Character. In this struggle I for one and 
many others with me were willing to have risked all, cheer- 
fully resigned every personal aspiration and be content to fall 
battling for our principles and our choice, and would have 
done so but that similar considerations themselves forbade 
that we should by abuse of your own generous permission to 
use your name peril the ultimate attainment of the destiny 
for which you were intended and cut off all the immense 
advantages to the South and the union which we believe would 
result from your administration of the government at a future 
day. These latter considerations, I believe I may safely 



926 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. ' 

assure you alone prevailed with the mass of your friends, 
whose feelings might else have proved too strong for the sole 
convictions of Judgment. 

In accordance with the views above were the resolves of a 
meeting of your friends Delegates to the Convention and mem- 
bers of the Legislature, held at my rooms on the night of the 
receipt of your letter. They determined to attend the Con- 
vention and when there to require and obtain the adoption 
and recognition in full of the soundest State rights principles 
upon all the questions in agitation in the Country (including 
the Tariff and abolition questions) as constituting the creed of 
the whole party in the State, and that such principles in all 
their extent should be pressed with all the influence of V a on 
the whole party of the Union. That those principles having 
been fully sanctioned, we should withdraw your name as our 
Candidate and issue an address (separate from that of the Con- 
vention) announcing our solemn convictions against the pro- 
posed constitution and organization of the National Conven- 
tion and assailing it in the ablest manner we could, but at the 
same time consenting not to press the decision of that issue at 
this time in consequence of the danger of division to the party 
and success to our opponents thereupon. In this address, we 
also determined to rest our support of the Candidate of the 
Republican Party not upon the nomination, but treating that 
as an objection, upon its apparent necessity under the peculiar 
circumstances of the time, provided we could feel assured by 
the pledges of the Candidate or the action of those who sup- 
ported and nominated him that by his election we should pro- 
mote the principles expounded in the resolutions of the Con- 
vention. These wishes of your friends were frankly made 
known by a Committee appointed for the purpose to the lead- 
ing adherents of M r . V. Buren, and they were received in a 
spirit of ready acquiescence that disclosed the seriousness of 
their previous apprehensions. An informal understanding was 
then had that our resolutions avowing the principles of the party 
should be adopted fully. That no pledges to sustain the Con- 
vention or vote for the Nominee should be exacted. That our 
address should be issued and opposition to the Convention 
aroused without severance of the party, Exclusion from its 
communion, or censure imputed to the principles of your let- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 927 

ter, Your course or our own. Upon this basis, the proceed- 
ings of the Convention were concluded smoothly and harmoni- 
ousry. Our demands were complied with and in effect we 
controlled tho' we could not command the Convention. At 
the same time the best spirit prevailed, especially toward 
yourself. The merit of your withdrawal and the sacrifice 
made by your friends redounded to your elevation in the con- 
fidence and affections of the whole party. The secret feelings 
of many, heretofore smothered by party influences, burst 
forth in your favor, and with it cooperated the gratitude of 
M r V B's blindest partizans, so that I am thoroughly con- 
vinced at no previous time have you ever been more securely 
fixed in the esteem and confidence of the Republican Party of 
V a . This fortunate state of things must daily be enhanced. 
Your friends, constituting most of the speakers of the party, 
will conduct (as indeed all the Republican speakers from the 
adoption of the resolutions b}^ the Convention will be forced 
to do also) the canvass on your Principles. Your authority, 
your arguments must be duly avouched and familiarized to 
the people, and now that all personal motives of detraction are 
removed, your character will be more highly appreciated and 
3^our services and labors more justly estimated than ever here- 
tofore. From all these causes many just auguries may be 
adduced of the course of future events, and if the firm resolves 
and best exertions of a host of able friends can aid their reali- 
zation, they shall certainly be so wrought out as to fill the 
measure of your honors, which now fall short only of your 
fame. To yourself who have already done enough for gloiy 
to your name and state this may be a matter of comparative 
indifference, but to your friends, it must constitute a matter 
of deep anxiety and lively anticipation, and to none more 
truly than to 

Yours with Sentiments of unfeigned esteem

From R. M. T. Hunter. c. c. 



Lloyds Essex County Feb y 6 

MY DEAR SIR I addressed you a hasty note before leaving 

Richmond to advise you in part of the motives of your friends 



928 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

in the V a Convention. Before this reaches you I hope you 
will have seen our address as it is expected to appear in the 
Kepublican this morning. Your letter reached us the morn- 
ing before the Convention in the Mercury. The same paper 
contained an editorial taking your name from the head of its 
column and announcing the terms upon which the candidate 
of the Dem : party might receive the suffrages of S. C a . So 
at least we understood it. Under the circumstances to have 
nominated you would have been a great injustice as we 
believe to your fame and popularity. Such a ticket would not 
have received near all of those who really prefer you. To have 
assumed a neutral position would have disbanded your friends. 
The mass would have divided, some voting for Clay but more 
voting for V B or whoever is the candidate. The object was to 
take such a course as we believed would most advance your 
popularity and our common principles. We determined to 
issue an address taking our position against the Baltimore Con- 
vention, announcing our intention to support the candidate of 
the party if we could promote the principles of the Dem Rep 
party as announced in the resolutions of our convention which 
you will perceive are good principles and leaving it undeter- 
mined what we would do in the other event. Such seemed to 
be the position of the Mercury, which seemed to us the true 
position. Our object was to drive the friends of M r V B as far 
[as] possible on the right line and to maintain and advance 
your popularit}^ in the party. It was distinctly understood 
with Ritchie that there was to be no attack on you or your 
letter, and I publicly told him that if the issue should be dis- 
astrous to the South the responsibility would rest upon him 
and M r V B\s southern friends who had insisted upon 
him. In the private meeting your friends determined upon 
preserving their organisation and upon presenting your name 
immediately after the next presidential canvass was over 
without 'regard to conventions, unless they would give us 
such organisation as we claimed in justice. In the meantime 
we have determined to use every means to increase your 
strength and extend your popularity. Our object was to bring 
you in next time if you would permit it and to raise up a South- 
ern party upon true and Southern principles. You will see 
the bearing our address has upon this point. When the con 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 929 

vention adjourned many very many of the supporters of 
V B assured us of their determination to support you next 
time. They said our course had strengthened you and that 
the party would be disgraced if it did not take you up on 
the next occasion. M r Ritchie assured me privately and in 
confidence that he had seen lately letters from V B which 
would satisfy me and the South as to his disposition upon 
every point. I did not see those letters and therefore cannot 
vouch for their existence. He pledged himself to use all the 
means short of actually renouncing V B to drive his friends 
to the right line of action and that he thought our course 
would be useful to this end. What he will do I know not. 
But we have a position in the party which will make it a mat- 
ter of political life or death with him to do so. Your friends 
I believe were actuated by a most sincere desire to raise your 
name and popularity and to preserve a position in which they 
could defend your principles and the South. I do believe 
that our movement will make you the strongest man in Vir- 
ginia should it not be disapproved by yourself. We also con- 
sidered its effects upon the South and our principles, to 
have supported Clay would have been utterly inconsistent and 
ruinous, to have remained neutral would have destroyed the 
leaders and disbanded the mass of your friends, nothing was 
left us but to declare our determination to go in with the 
Democrats if we could promote our principles by doing so 
and to throw the responsibility of selecting V B upon those 
men in the North who have forced him upon us. What shall 
we effect by it? We shall put an end to such national conven- 
tions as have heretofore been organised. We have induced 
the whole party in V a to adopt the resolutions which express 
your principles, we have T believe greatly strengthened you 
in Virginia and 1 hope in the union and we have preserved a 
position in the mass which will enable us 1 think to force the 
quondam leaders to go on properly or else break them down. 
If M r Clay had been elected through the neutrality or with 
the active cooperation of your friends it would have been 
destruction to you and them. If he should now be elected 
the Dem party must rally upon you next time, at any 
rate we have a position in which we can better unite the South 
upon your principles. The movements as have [been] taken

in all their attending circumstances have been amongst the 
most painful of my life I need not say why. I never was 
more decided in my life as to the propriety of the course. 
The apprehension has been lest you should disapprove it. I 
most earnestly trust not. Should you do " so, my position 
will be painful indeed. In the meeting of our friends, I told 
them I was governed entirely by your public letter which 
they had seen and my own views of what was proper. 
That I did not even know what course you would desire us to 
pursue, but that I felt to run you under such circumstances 
would have been cruel injustice towards you. That I knew 
you would be perfectly willing to the sacrifice if you thought 
our common principles would be advanced by it. But ought 
we to be willing to ask such a sacrifice ? I think they were 
all of opinion that such an idea was not to be entertained. 
You will perceive that your friends have prominent positions 
on the electoral ticket. I did not advise this course. But as 
every other in the private meeting seemed to think it highly 
important, I did not express my doubts. They offered me 
the post of elector which 1 declined. They then appointed 
me an assistant without my knowledge. I left a letter in 
Richmond declining this also. My doubts were as to the 
chance of our prominent friends becoming real V B men from 
the habit of defending him. But when it was determined to 
be important that they should take their posts I then sug-" 
gested (and it was so understood) that your friends on the 
ticket would take the ground that the resolutions of the con- 
vention (expressing in fact your principles and drawn by your 
friends) should be held up as the party creed, that the Whigs 
and their candidate should be attacked for their opposition to 
this creed and that the Dem Candidate should be defended 
where he approached the creed more nearly than the Whig, 
and that no departure from it in him should [be] justified. 

Before seeing your letter I had prepared an address in the 
event that the V B should present as a test a resolution pledg- 
ing us to the nominee. They offered none such and in some 
respects it was changed. The arguments against the Balti- 
more Convention and on the true position of V a . was from my- 
self, the three first and the three or four last pages in the 
manuscript were from Seddon. After our course was taken 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 931 

and shortly before the convention adjourned a letter reached 
Greenhow from Duff Green urging us to nominate you on a 
separate ticket. Our course had been previously taken, nor 
did we presume that he was acting under your advice as the 
Mercury had taken down your name and as we thought too 
that such an act would be ruinous to you, as it would close 
your political life under appearances which would do the 
greatest injustice to your real popularity and estimation 
amongst the people, and which would be false if taken by pos- 
terity (as they would be) as evidences of your true strength 
and popularity. 

I shall look with great anxiety for a letter from you. if we 
have done wrong let us know it and if the error is of a char- 
acter to be repaired tell us how. If you should disapprove 
our course because you apprehend disastrous consequences to 
ourselves we are willing to meet them and encounter all the 
hasards. Should you disapprove however because you think 
the course may be injurious to you we should be grieved indeed. 
Our position was difficult and painful. The exhibitions of 
feeling on the part of your friends were deep and nothing I 
believe restrained them but the fear of injuring you and the 
settled determination to make you the President next time 
should God spare you to us so long. If our course should be 
approved by yourself and friends elsewhere I believe we can 
do it.

MY DEAR SIR: Our friend Judge Huger, as he will inform 
3 7 ou by a letter which will go by the mail which carries this 3 
has come to a very decided conclusion in his own mind, that 
the political circumstances of the country are such as demand 
your services in the Senate. Prompted, therefore, by that 
perfect self-devotion to South Carolina and the whole coun- 
try, which has so prominently distinguished his course, he 
proposes to resign his seat immediately, if you will consent 
to take his place. He entertains no doubt that the Governor 
would appoint you, as a matter of course, upon being assured 
of your acceptance, and considers it your duty not to with- 
hold your services in the existing emergency, so deeply in- 
volving the interests of all the slave holding states on two 
great and vital questions. At his request I shall write to 
Governor Hammond confidentially on the subject, and shall 
expect an answer from him by the time yours may be re- 
ceived. I will add that I know that Judge Huger would feel 
it a personal gratification to be assured that such an arrange- 
ment would be agreeable to you. Permit me then to suggest 
that you at least go as far as to say, that if Judge Huger is 
determined to resign and the Governor should tender you the 
appointment, it will not be declined. We have a reasona- 
ble prospect of reducing the tariff very nearly to the average

Charleston 3. March 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR I came here and found things in much con- 
fusion. I think your immediate friends in this city managed 
very badly, and the country gentlemen were very much excited 
(many of them being in to the races). I called a meeting or 
caucus to consult together. Elmore introduced resolutions 
which I did not approve, and I moved a substitute and car- 
ried them. The main point of which was that 1 st . we should 
not go to the Bait. Con. and 2 d . that your friends should dis- 
tinctly hold your name in reserve and under control, and that 
it might be our sacred duty to vote for you finally. &c. &c. 
Upon consultation I found that we had to tamper a little at 
present as to the Convention, for fear small meetings would 
be forced up in places to appoint delegates as from the people 
&c. So we called a meeting of the Con. for the 18 March, so 
that we could gain time and the developements in Congress, 
and by then there would be no question as to our course in 
the State. It was suggested by Elmore that we might find it 
politic to go into Convention as to the future &c. but I said 
this was folly and they would laugh at us as their victims, and 
that our keeping out would produce no impression in two 
years time however much they might pretend to be offended 
now. 

The great difficulty was to get your name back again. You 
see the article in the Mercury yesterday (Saturday). It was 
presented to me and was drawn up to meet the general views 
of my resolutions in Caucus. It does so but with more policy,

as they say to prevent a meeting in this city to be called imme- 
diately by Pinckney. They say the meeting is now killed, 
but I tell them if he calls one, let our friends attend and either 
move to lay on the table and adjourn or vote down the reso- 
lutions. I think there has been some bad moves and I hope 
it has been from bad judgement rather than from any thing 
else. M c Duffie has written that every thing will be done for 
us that we desire on the Tariff &c. So writes Rhett and 
Lewis. But Holmes writes differently. I fear M c Duffie has 
been imposed on. 

You see the dreadful accident at Washington and deaths. 1 
I hear some of our members have written today here that I 
am to be offered a place in the Cabinet &c. but of course 
this must be premature, and even if so, I shall refuse. 
In haste, but truly

Washington, 5 th March 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR: I write this merely to say that I have had an 
interview with the President to day, at M r . Wise's request, 
on the subject of your acceptance of the appointment of Sec- 
retary of State. The President is very anxious that you 
should accept and come on immediately, as the Texas nego- 
ciation admits of no delay, and requested me to sa} 7 so to you. 
The moment you communicate your willingness to do so, your 
name will be sent in to the Senate, and I, therefore, wish you 
to write to me immediately. I now repeat the opinion 1 
expressed in my last, that it is my decided opinion and that 
of your friends here that your acceptance would be regarded 
by the country as a magnanimous offering at the shrine of 
patriotism, and that you ought not to hesitate. I mention to 
you in confidence that the Texas question is in such a state, 
that in ten days after your arrival the Treaty of annexation, 
would be signed, and from poor Upshur's count 40 senators 
would vote for it. The President sa} r s he has hopes of the

acquiescence of Mexico. It is a great occasion involving the 
peace of the country and the salvation of the South, and your 
friends here have ventured to say for you, that no party or 
personal considerations would prevent you from meeting the 
crisis. 

Very sincerely yours, 

GEO: M c DuFFiE. 



From, Dixoii H. Lewis. 1 c. c. 

House of Reps, March 6 th 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR 1 have just heard in a manner, which leaves 
no room to doubt its correctness, that your name has been to 
day sent to the Senate, as the Successor of M r . Upshur to the 
Office of Secretary of State, and that the name of John Y. 
Mason of Virginia has also been sent in as the successor of 
M r . Grilmer in the Navy Department. 

In effecting this result, your friends here have had no 
agency, and are in no way responsible. Many of them were 
unconsulted and entirely ignorant in relation to it, untill the 
rumour has this moment reached this House. Others have 
in reply to the general designation of your name to the sta- 
tion, expressed doubts whether you would accept it. So far 
as I know or believe none have solicited the place for you. 
In reply to frequent enquiries addressed to me, as to whether 
you would accept (enquiries in some instances coming from 
those, who I supposed had the ear of M r Tyler) my uniform 
reply has been that if it were a mere question of whether 
you would accept the office of Secretary of State under M r . 
Tyler, I did not believe you would accept of a station, which 
could confer no honour on you, and which would consume 
much of your time at an advanced age, which would not likely 
be requited either by an advancement of your own reputation, 
or the interests of the country, but if by the death of M r . 
Upshur and the State of the Texas and Oregon questions, 
there was an exigency which required your services, I knew 
you too well to doubt that considerations of duty and patriot- 



H. Lewis (1802-1848) represented Alabama in the House of Representatives

936 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

ism would control you in this, as I believed it had on all other 
questions and that at any personal sacrifice you would accept. 
This opinion so often expressed, contains my deliberate view 
not only of what you will but what you ought to do in this 
matter. I am of course ignorant of the true state of both the 
above mentioned questions, but I take it for granted that M r . 
Tyler will disclose to you fully their actual state. If I am 
not mistaken in my conjectures, the Texas question has already 
been reduced to a Treaty, waiting only to be submitted to, and 
receive the confirmation of the Senate. The opinion of all is, 
that the question is imminent, and in the present condition of 
the Country, to confirm a Treaty at all, and to do it under 
circumstances which will not involve us in a double war with 
Mexico [and] Great Britain, will be a most difficult matter. 
If the Treaty be rejected, I consider the Union at an end. It 
may not at once suffer absolute disruption, but the interests 
and sympathies of a large portion of the Union must be 
stronger in favour of an Union with Texas, than with a con- 
federacy, which in the midst of unceasing plunder by Taxa- 
tion, is waging a relentless war against their Institutions, and 
making those Institutions the avowed ground of objection to 
a political Union with those who in every other respect are 
bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh. 

In this view of the question, in the opinion of all, it is 
important that the question should be under the charge of one 
having the confidence of every party, both for intelligence 
and patriotism. I have taken some pains to ascertain the 
state of public feeling, and I am glad to say, that I have never 
seen stronger evidences of complete unanimity on any public 
question, than that you are the man, and as most of them say, 
the only man to meet the crisis. The rumour of your nomi- 
nation at once created here, a great stir. Men neglectful of 
business were talking about in groups. I left my seat to 
gather public opinion. I heard a general expression not only 
of approval but of satisfaction. Many in their anxiety urged 
me to write, and beg you to accept. Payne of Alabama, says 
"Accept by all means, to meet a great crisis, but to base your 
acceptance on that crisis and to limit your acceptance to the 
crisis." I think your acceptance ought to be put on that high 
ground, and that your continuance though not strictly limited 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 937 

by it, ought not to be much beyond the period you are actu- 
ally and necessarily engaged in what all consider, the extraor- 
dinary duties of the Station. I take it for granted Tyler will 
give you a carte blanche as to the two great questions. 

While writing Blair has coine to my seat and asked me good 
naturedly what I was doing. I answered that I was writing 
to you. He said he had come to beg me by all means to ear- 
nestly advise you to accept. He says he goes his death for 
Texas and wants you to manage the matter, that you are the 
man. and that you have the confidence of all parties. He said 
further that by taking this position you would build up a 
reputation with the Democratic Party which would make you 
impregnable at another time. He evidently however betrayed 
a little anxiety that in your position you should do nothing to 
weaken and divide the Party, as he expressed it, but which of 
course meant, to dislodge M r Van Buren. I give you this for 
what it is worth. D r Martin is in ecstacy at your appoint- 
ment, and comes to tell me that Joe Gales 1 has just said to 
him, that the appointment meets his entire approbation. The 
Whigs all say so. 

I have written this to give you a better idea of the state of 
feeling. The Senate have just confirmed your appointment 
unanimously without referring it to a Committee. Everybody 
is delighted and are expressing themselves so. The evidences 
are so strong it is needless for me to write more. 

I must however say that this matter proves the truth of 
what I wrote you before this winter, that you have a strength 
and consideration in the Democratic Party which should pre- 
vent you from doing any act which would separate you from 
that Party. The extent of this feeling was never so obvious 
as now. Men are expressing themselves without reserve and 
it is almost universal even among those whom party machinery 
have unwillingly united to M r Van Buren. The Leaders I 
have no doubt dislike you and dread you and this day has been 
a dark one to them, but of the Van Buren men as they are 
called numbering a majority of this House, I believe that three 
fourths of them are- more friendly to you than to him and if 
left free would rather run you as the Candidate. The other

fourth are however so bitter that I believe that in no event 
could they be brought to support you, and therefore I am for 
not risking your name in a contest in which I fear a majority 
of the voters are already inclined to Clay even if V. Buren's 
friends are wise enough to back out from him. Still I agree 
with the opinion expressed so often to day that in the position 
you are about to occupy, you can place yourself in a position 
which will make you unpregnable in 1848. It may be how- 
ever that a ground swell from the people themselves growing 
out of the Texas question may roll you into the position of a 
Candidate. If so no one would be more delighted than myself, 
but I mean to say that no action in my opinion on the part of 
yourself or your friends ought now to look to that result. Let 
Van run and be beaten as he certainly will and then the Party 
will be purified of him and his clique. Let them be forced to 
withdraw him and run an indifferent man and then his organ- 
ization is destroyed and you must be the man four years hence. 
These are my views given to you to cover every aspect of 
the question as to your acceptance. If the occasion calls to 
your services, accept. If not, decline but in any event look 
to the effect which your course may have on a popularity in the 
Democratic Party, which will at another time prove stronger 
than a corrupt Party organization which manacles your 
friends at present, but which has received its death wound by 
your withdrawing from the Convention, and which will be 
doubly killed and damned by the certain defeat of V. Buren 
Benton &c. in the coming election. 
I am truly your friend,

MY DEAR SIR, After a free and frank conversation with 
our friends, Governor M c Duffie and M r Holmes of South 
Carolina, and in full view of the important negociation now 
pending between us and foreign Governments, I have unhesi- 
tatingly nominated you this day as Secretary of State in place 
of my much lamented friend, Judge Upshur. I have been 
prompted to this course by reference to your great talents

and deservedly high standing with the Country at large. We 
have reached a great crisis in the condition of public affairs, 
which, I trust, will assume the place of a commanding epoch 
in our Country's history. The annexation of Texas to the 
Union, and the settlement of the Oregon question on a satis- 
factory basis, are the great ends to be accomplished: The 
first is in the act of competition and will admit of no delay. 
The last had but barely opened, when death snatched from me 
my lamented friend. Do I expect too much of you when I, 
along with others, anticipate at your hands, a ready acquies- 
cence in meeting my wishes, by coming to the aid of the Coun- 
try at this important period? 

While your name was before the Country, as a prominent 
Candidate for the Presidency, I could not have urged this 
request without committing alike an offence to yourself and 
many others; but now, since your friends have withdrawn 
your name from that exciting canvass, I feel it every way due 
to the Country to seek to avail myself, in the administration 
of public affairs, of your high and exalted talents. 

I hope 'the action of the Senate will be as prompt as my 
own, and that you will immediately be at my side. 

JOHN TYLER.

Philadelphia, March 8 th , 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR, The news of your appointment and confirma- 
tion as Secretary of State has just reached Philadelphia, and 
I am going to take the liberty of telling you that the hope and 
trust of your friends in this section of the country is that you 
should accept the appointment. Independently of the convic- 
tion that no other than a master mind can adjust the Oregon 
negotiation, that such a labour requires the whole of that 
great intellect which can only be found in two men of the 
country of whom you are one, that there is but one man 
who can unite to such an intellect a character which precludes 
the supposition of fear, favour, and affection, and that that 
man is yourself, independently, I say, of such reasons, I 
cannot doubt that your appearance once more in public life, 



940 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

in a catholic attitude, will awaken in the men of the middle 
and northern states, the feelings of pride and attachment with 
which they looked upon you in 1812 and 1816. The paren- 
thesis of nullification, misunderstood as it is by the great 
majority at the North, will be merged, even in minds of the 
most prejudiced, into the whole context of your history. 
Believe me, looking at you once more as the representative of 
the Union as a whole will open the old fountains of affection. 
There was a time when Pennsylvania would have voted for 
you by acclamation, that time may come again. I may be 
sanguine, but who would not be sanguine when so great a 
consummation as the restoration of the North to the true 
republican creed, has become for the first time for twenty 
years probable? The Secretaryship of War made you the 
second man in the affections of the nation: the Secretaryship 
of State will make you the first. 

With great respect I remain yours, 

FRANCIS WHARTON.

MY DEAR SIR The Enclosed you will please hand to M r . 
Calhoun when he arrives in Washington. Should he however 
not accept the appointment of Secretary of State, you will 
please forward the enclosed to him, as a testimony that his 
friends here will support him in any political station he may 
be in, so long as he is an exponent and a Vindicator of those 
principles we cherish, and which lie at the foundation of our 
political fabric. 

You will please read them, i. e. the enclosed proceedings of 
the Calhoun Central Committee of New York. They were 
passed unanimously after some opposition. We have here 
some good and true Calhoun men of the State rights breed. 
Permit me to say that you and some others at Washington 
were rather imposed on by the Scovil tribe. 

We hold it a matter of propriety to advance to the support 
of M r . Calhoun even in anticipation of his acceptance of the 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 941 

premiership. We wish him to know when he arrives in 
Washington that his friends in New York are ready, aye 
ready to stand by him in any department of Government. It 
is something of a proof of our estimation of him that while 
east west and south of us, some have fallen and others have 
bent down before Van Buren yet that we in this city with 
three administrations (United States, State and city) against 
us have stood firm and uncompromising, almost alone defying 
the party organization in its strongest Citadel. 

Never had so strong a man such weak partizans as M r . Cal- 
houn's Southern friends with a few exceptions. I say weak 
because of their want of energy and perseverance in the 
cause. Had they arose with enthusiasm and activit}' and 
spoken with determination to the people of the North East 
and West such confidence would have been given to his 
friends in Maine, Mass. N. H. and Con. as well as in the 
Western States as would have elected other delegates to the 
Baltimore Convention. To no movement of his friends here 
has the South responded. Languor and laziness is doing the 
destiny of the South. She is now compelled to compromise 
her Candidate for the sake of Tariff and twenty first rule. 
Power never shews justice or magnanimity to the opponent 
who is not in a formidable position nor to the rebell who indi- 
cates his weakness by grounding his arms and trusting to the 
fairness of those who have the power in their hands. 

I shall be much pleased at M r . Calhoun's acceptance of the 
premiership provided he shall be able to settle the Oregon 
Question and the annexation of Texas. If he shall acquire 
additional reputation on these subjects, he may yet be presi- 
dent but not otherwise, for the South cant, because it wont 
go through the necessary exertion. 

As regards the tariff that is sure to come right in a few 
years because the agricultural population of the north and 
West are beginning to find it is not profitable to them. As 
to Texas the people who gave twenty millions for Louisiana 
and five millions for Florida will undoubtedly take Texas 
without cost. It is not in the race of Anglo Saxon Land rob- 
bers to refuse that which of all other things is the object of 
the master passion of the race. There may be some talking 
on the subject on the score of Abolition, but American aboli- 



942 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

tion is about equal to British justice always a tremendous 
affaire when it costs nothing but display. The best way to 
argue with these hypocrites is to give them trouble about 
their own institutions. Titles or rights to Slaves are as good 
as titles to lands both are creations of human law. Why 
not have petitions for the abolition of land titles? 

Write me frequently. I am well acquainted with men and

Athens March 23 d , 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR That the destiny of men and nations are under 
the controuling influence of an All-wise Providence, has long 
since been one of the settled Tenets of my faith. And it is 
thus that I account for your being placed in the position 
which you now occupy in connection with the great interests 
of our beloved Country. I know that your present position 
has not been anticipated by you, or your friends. I hope, 
trust and believe, that the recent changes, however deeply 
mingled with calamity, woe and regret, may be overruled for 
the good of our Country. At this particular juncture, your 
post is the most important one under the government. 

Upon an enlarged consideration, of the permanent interest 
of our Confederacy, We have nothing at this time of equal 
importance to that of the great Territorial questions, of Texas 
and Orrigon. Upon these questions I entertain no doubt of 
the correctness of your views, as well as of the views of Pres- 
ident Tyler. And therefore trust you may be the honored 
instruments of bringing these vexed questions to a happy and 
successful issue. As regards the adjustment of the Orrigon 
question, you know and will do what is best to be done on 
that Subject. 

Upon the subject of Texas, allow me to say that country 
must speedily become a part and portion of our great confed- 
eracy or the abolition spirit will destroy our beloved insti- 
tutions. The peaceable acquisition of Texas will go further 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 943 

to ensure and perpetuate the general welfare and permanent 
Union of our Confederacy than any thing which has transpired 
since the acquisition of Louisiana. I have no special knowl- 
edge of the exact relation of things touching this subject at 
present. I have, however, a very accurate knowledge of a 
large number of the leading and most influential men of Texas, 
and of the true character and feelings of the great body of 
the population of that Country. My eldest son emigrated to 
that Country about 10 years ago, and has continued to live 
there ever since. He has a wife and children, is a steady 
sensible, educated man and has several times been a member 
of the Legislature of Texas. 1 am intimately acquainted with 
President Lamar, Gen 1 . Rusk and various other Georgians 
who have become prominent in that Country. Therefore 
through these associations I have continued to know more, 
and feel more in regard to Texas than most men. 

The great body of the people of Texas ardently desire to 
come into our Union. Any opposition which may appear to 
Annexation, whether from President Houston or others, I am 
well assured is altogether selfish and factious. 

Anxious as I am to know the state of our negotiations and 
prospects upon this subject, your present position forbids my 
making many inquiries which might be suggested, if I con- 
sidered you at liberty to confer with a private Citizen upon a 
subject, which may at the present moment require the most 
profound silence, out of the Council Chamber. 

I could easily write an Essay, or Volume, upon the great 
importance of the annexation of Texas, but deem the multi- 
plication of words upon this subject, when addressing you, 
altogether useless because I know you will duly appreciate 
its magnitude in all its bearings. 

I would willingly make any sacrifice of my quiet, ease and 
inclination to aid in furthering and consumating this all 
important object. And if I find the state of things touching 
this subject should in the course of the present year, open a 
door for useful and efficient service, I have it [in] view to 
visit the Country. If Texas should become a part of the U. S. 
It will be a matter of Vital importance to the entire South, 
that all the incipient steps, touching the establishment of the 
local institutions of that Country, should be based and founded

in wisdom, and that far seeing forecast, so necessary to the 
permanent prosperity and harmony of the whole Union. 

Any thing that may be proper for me [to] know, at any 
time, on the subject of Texas will be received with thankful- 
ness. For your health, happiness, and success in your pres- 
ent labors my poor prayers and best wishes await you. 
As Ever Yrs.

DEAR SIR. You have doubtless heard the result of the recent 
election in this state and perhaps, knowing as you did the 
conduct of Mr V Burens friends in our state convention, it 
was such as you anticipated. Our defeat cannot be ascribed 
to the apathy of your more prominent friends in Connecticut, 
for never have they done their duty more faithfully than dur- 
ing the campaign which we have just come out of, but in a 
great measure to the want of that enthusiasm throughout the 
state which the nomination of our Middletown Convention 
failed to inspire. For the past five weeks I have been trav- 
ersing this and the adjoining counties and addressing our 
friends. I had an opportunity of knowing something of the 
feeling which pervaded the state, and I found many a warm 
hearted man supposed by the ' ' wire pullers " to be strong for 
the restoration, actually condemn the nomination of our Con- 
vention, they try however to keep cool and are in fact the 
most radical and determined Democrats we have. The vote 
of the state shows, as any one will perceive who will examine 
it, that where we have proclaimed our choice for President to 
be another than Mr V Buren, the Democracy have done well. 
New Haven County which went nearly unanimous for your- 
self in the Convention shows a good vote, while Hartford Co. 
from whence the order for the Nom n . of M r V Buren went 
forth to our convention, has fallen in the rear. The city of 
N. Haven has increased her Dem. vote about 150 from last 
year, and Hartford where the leaders, whose pet M r V Buren

LETTERS TO JOHN- C. CALHOUN. 945 

is, reside, has not come up to her vote of last year! Another 
circumstance might also be mentioned; notwithstanding the 
Federalists previous to the election had raised the cry 'of 
"Free trade and direct taxation," and appealed to the manu- 
facturing towns to sustain the present tarriff, the result of the 
election shows that the manufacturing towns have done as 
well as the farming towns, and in some instances better. Our 
opponents had the aid of about one half I should think of the 
Abolitionists in the recent election. I never knew them so 
active and unscrupulous in their means before, money was 
poured out like water, and many instances of open bribery 
have come to my knowledge recently. Their victory however 
is not a great one, their Governor probably falls short of an 
election by the people and they have both branches of the 
Legislature who will elect the Governor. Had our friends 
been united we should have secured the Legislature, so small 
are most of the federal majorities, that I have no doubt two 
hundred votes properly distributed would give us the Legis- 
lature and as a consequence state offices and an U. S. Senator. 
With a candidate for the Pres y . who carried with his name a 
degree of popular enthusiasm I think we might carry the 
State at the fall election. With Mr V Burens name we can 
do nothing. I do hope that the Nat 1 Convention will yet look 
to the interests of the people rather than to the interests of 
mere party leaders. 

I have the honor to remain TruJy Yrs.

DEAR SIR. I learn by the newspapers, the sad death of 
Judge Upshur, and your appointment to the State Depart-

position here has given me an insight into the condition of 
Texas, California and Oregon; and as it may be of some im-

portance to you in the anticipated negotiations at Washington, 
I deem it proper to give you all the information I possess. 

That information is chiefly derived from a M r . Hastings, of 
Ohio, 1 who, some two years since, led a party of emigrants 
from the West to Oregon, and past through this city about 
three months ago, in his return to the U. S. 

He describes Oregon as a fine country; but chiefly valuable 
for its fisheries and fur trade. The salmon of Columbia River 
is unrivalled in quality and inexhaustible in number. In an 
agricultural point of view, the country is important, but much 
less so, in comparison with the rich soil and more attractive 
climate of the adjoining Calif ornias. 

The political state of those countries is very interesting to 
us. M r . Hastings told me, in confidence, that California is on 
the point of following the example of Texas, and declaring 
her independence. The whole project has been well digested, 
and reduced to a systematized plan. The province of Cali- 
fornia is far distant from the seat of the Mexican Gov*; which 
has neither soldiers to send there, nor money to support them. 
Michael Torrena, 2 the Mexican Commandante General, has 
but two hundred vagabond soldiers to oppose the movement, 
and has no resources within himself, being destitute both of 
talents and courage. The military strength is in the hands of 
the foreigners, and the natives in their favor. A German, 
named Suter, is at the head of the movement, and the execu- 
tion of their designs is only delayed for the return of M r . 
Hastings, with a reinforcement of settlers. 

The settlers in Oregon have already a legislative council and 
governor: and while M r . Hastings was in Oregon, they were 
debating the propriety of declaring their independence of the 
U. S., and of forming a separate Republic on the Pacific 
Coast, in conjunction with the Calif ornias. They do not wish 
to do so, however, if they can obtain protection and encour- 
agement from home. 

Nor is California the only portion of Mexican territory in 
danger. Sonora has been for two years the theatre of civil 
war, and will probably join in with the movement in Cali- 
fornia. The provinces, bordering on Texas, have long envied

the freedom from forced loans and martial rule, enjoyed by 
their neighbours. New Mexico has been on the eve of a revo- 
lution ever since the Santa Fe trade was closed, and there is 
reason to believe that even Tamaulipas, were it not for her 
exposed condition would at once throw herself into the arms 
of Texas. Santa Anna is trying to provoke a war with 
France. His object is believed to be to take advantage of the 
confusion and excitement of an invasion, to make himself 
Emperor; trusting to the English mediation to pacify France, 
as soon as his object is accomplished. 

If France refuses to be pacified, her Minister here, if he 
advises well, will advise that the attack should be made 
through Texas, and upon the discontented provinces. It is 
by no means improbable that the result will be the annexa- 
tion of those Departments to Texas. With that addition of 
territory, Texas would no longer desire admission to our 
union, but on the contrary would prove a dangerous rival 
both to the cotton interests of the South and the manufactures 
of the North. 

I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your obt sev'

From W. S. Murphy. 1 c. c. 

Legation of the United States. 
Houston Texas, 29 th April 1844 

SIR. Your despatch of the 13 th Inst was delivered to me, on 
the 26 th Inst. at Galveston by R. C. Murphy who was also the 
bearer of the Texan duplicate of a Treaty annexing the Repub- 
lic of Texas to the United States. 

The President of the Rep b . of Texas, (by an arrangement 
between his Excellency and myself,) being in waiting at this 
City, for the Earliest information on this deeply interesting 
subject, I thought it proper to accompany your messenger to 
this place, in order that I might have a personal interview 
with His Excellency after he should have received the dupli- 
cate Treaty. 

1 Gen. W. S. Murphy was charg6 d'affaires of the United States in the Republic of 
Texas from 1843 to June, 1844, and was actively engaged in promotion of the treaty of 
annexation. 



948 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The President was highly gratified, at my having done so, 
and gave to your Messenger an Expression of his approbation. 

After his Excellency had fully examined the duplicate 
Treaty; and in Conjunction with the Attorney General of the 
Republic, fully considered its provisions, in connection with 
all the Private letters, from the Texan Envoys on the same 
Subject he expressed to me his hearty approbation of every 
part thereof, and his high and sanguine hopes at the final suc- 
cess of this important measure. I then took occasion to make 
known to his Excellency, So much of the substance of your 
despatch to me, relating to the defence of Texas pending the 
Treaty of Annexation, as I deemed useful, and proper to Com- 
municate; at which he rose to his feet, and gave utterance to 
his feelings of gratitude towards the President of the United 
States and yourself for this distinguished manifestation of the 
generous and noble policy, which ruled in the Councils of my 
beloved Country. 

His Excellency will remain near this Legation, until the 
final or definate action of my Government, upon this Treaty 
is known. 

His Excellency finally pressed upon me the Momentous Con- 
sideration, of the utter hopelessness of ever effecting thi^ 
great measure of annexation, in case the present Treaty for 
that purpose should be rejected by the Senate of the U. States. 

I have so often and so earnestly labored to impress this 
trut h upon niy government, that I am almost ashamed, to 
repeat it at this time. 

You will have the goodness to excuse the haste with which 
this brief despatch is drawn up. I have barely time to do it. 
Your messenger leaves here immediately for Galveston that 
he may take the Neptune for N. Orleans, tomorrow. 

With great respect and esteem, I have the Honor to be Your 
Obt Sevt 

W. S. MURPHY. 

NOTE. It is almost useless for me to add, that 1 am fully 
impressed with the high responsibility which your last despatch 
casts upon me, and that I shall take care to follow your instruc- 
tions with great caution and precision. 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUIST. 949 

Private Houston 29" April 1844. 

SIR. I have not seen the Treaty, and as the President did 
not offer it for ray perusal, I thought it indelicate to ask for it. 
Yet, I cannot doubt, but that my government has obligated 
the U. States, to assume the payment of the Public debt of 
Texas. And inasmuch as the assumption of that debt, would 
create no greater obligation on the part of the U. States, than 
that under which Texas rests, it may not be unimportant to 
suggest, even now, fhat the Treasury Drafts of Texas now 
outstanding were not issued for the amount which appears 
up[on] their face. Some were issued as equivalent to 50 cents 
on the Dollar, some as equivalent to 25 cents &c &c and some 
as low as 16 cents on the Dollar, and the Gov' of Texas was 
only obligated to redeem them at the price, or value, for which 
they were issued. 

The Gov* Records will shew, when compared with the date 
of the Drafts, for what equivalents they were issued, in great 
Haste, 

Yours Respectfully W. S. MURPHY. 

P. S. I learn from the Auditor of the Treasury, who is here, 
that the Public Debt of Texas, when fairly audited as above 
will not amount to 5.000.000. 



From M. P. Norton. 1 

Houston, Ap. 29, 1844. 

DEAR SIR I write you at this moment because I am sure 
there is no one here will do it, as most of those in the confi- 
dence of the President here are bitterly opposed to annexa- 
tion. It is now certain that we can form such a commercial 
treaty with Great Britain as will insure our immediate inde- 
pendence. Gen Houston had an interview with Capt. Elliot 2 
on the day he left Galveston for New Orleans. Mons r Saligny 
the French minister is now at Galveston. the President is 
strongly urged and importuned to break off from the treaty 
with the U. S. and listen to their propositions. We are all

cian, and afterward a district judge.

950 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

prepared if we are spurned again from the Union to enter 
into a commercial free trade treaty with G. B. and France on 
a guaranty of our Independence which we can now have and 
the advantages it promises us in the cotton trade renders it 
very desirable. The enemies of annexation urge upon the 
President that we can not get as good terms after annexation 
fails and that it is his duty now to receive propositions and I 
can assure you beyond a doubt that when it shall be known here 
that Gen Henderson 1 shall have made his visit of leave at Wash- 
ington that propositions will have been received and agreed 
to by us that will place annexation beyond all hope forever 
without a war with G. B. and that such propositions will be 
gladly accepted by our Government and people. The Presi- 
dent was strongly urged to consent to entertain the proposi- 
tion when it was apprehended here that certain pledges made 
to us by Gen. Murphy were to be disavowed, that apprehen- 
sion is removed by Gen. Henderson's letter of 9th Ap. These 
apprehensions were founded on a certain communication sup- 
posed to have been made by M'. Nelson to Gen. Murphy 
before your arrival. It is very important to the success of 
the measure that all the assurances made to the President by 
Gen. Murphy shall be carried out to the letter not so much from 
immediate fear of danger from Mexico as that the President 
may not be induced to seize upon a breach of them to break 
off the treaty which it is urged here that he may do at any 
moment when he shall have received it without submitting it 
to the Senate. It is therefore of the utmost importance that 
no single assurance of Gen. Murphy be disavowed or left 
unfulfilled. I do not say^ these things because I have any 
want of faith in President Houston but because I know the 
almost overpowering influences that are brought to bear upon 
him. You will doubtless be furnished by this mail through 
Gen Henderson with the evidence that the commission for an 
armistice was at once rejected by Gen. Houston when it 
reached him on the ground that we were treated in it as a 
department of Mexico and that the commissioners had not the 
slightest authority to treat upon that basis. In truth the 
Commissioners who are violently opposed to annexation are 

1 Texan envoy to the United States, 






LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 951 

believed here to have entered into that agreement for the very 
purpose for which it will doubtless be used by Mexico and 
the opponents of annexation to defeat the measure and there 
is great fear here that the disavowal by the President may 
not reach you in season to meet the objection, as a copy of 
the instructions to the commissioners and the action of the 
President on the armistice will not reach here in season to go 
out by the Neptune. Gen. Henderson will have however a 
letter from the President which may have the same effect to a 
certain extent. Allow me to suggest that the commissioners 
to settle claims under the ten million allowance made for that 
purpose in the Treaty be allowed to sit at "Washington in 
Texas," or such other place in Texas as they may themselves 
appoint, as there are very serious objections to that place and 
that if any lesser sum than ten millions shall be likely to 
accelerate the passage of the Treaty that it had better be 
amended in the Senate even down to eight if necessary as 
that change will not prevent its ratification by us. Most of 
these claims are held in the United States. It must certainly 
be desirable if you have a majority in the Senate but not 
two thirds, that you hold the Treaty up and not allow it to 
be rejected untill action shall have been had on the question 
on affirmative resolutions in the House as when these shall 
reach the Senate and the opponents shall see that we may be 
annexed by resolution they may be disposed to favor the 
treaty besides if the Treaty shall be rejected you will no 
longer have any such hold upon the Government of Texas as 
may prevent the President from entering into negotiations 
that must greatly embarass if not entirely defeat the measure 
for I am absolutely certain that this is the only treaty you can 
ever get and that propositions will be crowded upon us the 
moment the Treaty is rejected that will place the subject 
beyond your reach by peacable means; there is no doubt 
entertained here that the English and French ministers at 
your Court have instructions to interpose their protest if they 
think such course may prevent and not accelerate the measure 
and may be the only meam of preventing it; such information 
has been received here from a quarter entirely to be relied 
upon at Paris but the movements of those Governments with 
your own on that question is better known to you than to us. 



952 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I am not willing that this letter should go on to the files of 
your department. I am not certain that you think the facts 
communicated of any importance or that you may not have 
them from other quarters on which you have more right to 
rely or that they may not be too late for any useful purpose, 
if annexation shall fail this letter might prove very injuri- 
ous to me if known here; if the measure succeed I care noth- 
ing about it. I am known to Gen. Henderson and Messrs. 
Evans and Fairfield of the Senate and I refer you to them for 
the faith you can place in my statements. I am among the 
few friends of annexation who are so much in the confidence 
of the Executive as to know what movements are taken to 
favor or defeat the measure and I repeat, if I have said it 
before, that annexation can never occur peaceably unless by 
the present movement, that it is not at all unlikely to be 
broken off from this quarter and that the line between Texas 
and the United States will form the Slave line within five 
years after a commercial treaty shall be formed with G. B. 
and that too by our own free will and still sooner if we are 
left alone to take care of ourselves for we cannot go into 
another war with Mexico and leave our families at home 
exposed to the dangers of a slave population and we never will 
surrender the country to Mexico while one man is left to fight. 
Yrs. Very Truly, M. P. NORTON.

Confidential Charleston 3 May 1844 

MY DEAR SIR Clays and Van Burens letter on Texas have 
created some excitement here: particularly that from the latter. 
The first was expected. But the course of the latter was 
the reverse. It demonstrates most clearly what the influence 
of abolishionism is at the north in spite of declarations to the 
contrary. 

I consider the annexation of Texas now that the views of 
Great Britain and the Northern States are not only disclosed, 
but openly avowed the most vital one which has occured since 
the revolution. On it hinges the very existence of our South- 
ern Institutions, and if one of the south now prove recreant:

we will or must content to be Hewers of wood and Drawers 
of Water for our northern Brethren. There is much excite- 
ment among us: and many ready for immediate action. But 
what should be the action is the question with a very large 
portion of our Friends. Unity of action seems to be the dif- 
ficulty. No inconsiderable portion of the Democrac} r are ripe 
for hoisting the Tyler flag and of rallying under an Adminis- 
tration party to carry out the Presidents policy as explained 
in his message. Others however, and the decided majority 
of the Democrats, do not think Tyler equal to the crisis and 
still turn on and confide in you as our leader. Unwilling to 
have a split at a period when Union is so important we feel 
much at loss untill we can be better instructed from Wash- 
ington. Would you, in confidence communicate your views 
to me. 

Your friends are all ready and anxious to raise a standard 
which should never have been lowered: but they are unwill- 
ing to act precipitately and possibly against your judgement. 
If you think from indications at Washington that we should 
move We will do so but if you think delay preferable: or 
if you concur in bringing out Tyler: wiry we will be prepared 
to act. We all are resolved to hold communion with Van 
Buren no longer for myself, who never did trust him, I feel 
gratified at the course he has pursued

MY DEAR SIR. 1 rec d from you a few days ago a note, and 
a letter addressed by the British Minister to you. From the 
Tenor of your note, and the letter of the Minister I appre- 
hend you have not sent me the paper you intended. In this 
M r . Pakenham merely informs you that he will notify the 
Authorities of Canada that the American minister in London 
will apply to her majesty for a pardon of Robert Marsh trans- 
ported to Van Dieman's Land. As an evidence of his good 
feeling it is equivocal and not to be put in the balance against

his protest if he has made one, against the Treaty with 
Texas, I should like to know what right Great Britain has 
to interfere with the Treaties of Nations on this Continent 
other than her Colonies. Is it intended to endeavour to intro- 
duce here the European System of the Balance of Power 
according to European ideas ? I was delighted with your note 
to M r . Pakenham in reference to Slavery. It is precisely the 
thing that was wanted and I do trust it will be published in 
every European paper. I have not seen the attack on you in 
the Globe and am at a loss to conjecture on what ground you 
can be charged with hostility to the annexation. I should say 
it was flatly impossible to make even a plausible showing, if 
I did not know that with the baseness and malice of the devil 
Ben ton has his power of invention also. I think however it 
is clear that he and Van Buren have both split on this Rock. 
The feeling in favour of annexation the reason and impera- 
tive necessity of the thing cannot be met in the South and S. 
west by humbug or chichanery : and these two masters in this 
art will for once find their magic powers fail them. Benton's 
hatred to you is at the bottom of this movement and I am 
rejoiced that it has at length led him to his ruin. As to Van 
Buren, after this letter and the Virginia election I don't see 
the use of assembling a Convention in his behalf. Is the Demo- 
cratic Party then to make no show of hands even ? It is never 
to be too much lamented that after your letter the Mercury 
and Spectator so hastily withdrew }^our name. It was a great 
error though doubtless done with the best feelings towards 
you. I can make no conjectures that would be wirth offering 
to you who are at head quarters but is it impossible yet to 
rally your friends so as at least to get your name into the 
House? Might not the Democratic Party run its favourites 
ia each secton \ 1 think you could at least carry all south of 
No. Carolina if not of Virginia. No anti-Texas candidate 
could rally the slave states against you or any of them. At 
all events the Texas question should be pushed. If the Union 
is to break there could not be a better pretext. With Texas 
the slave states would form a territory large enough for a 
first rate power and one that under a free trade system would 
flourish beyond any on the Globe immediately and forever. 
I confess I despair of the Union more and more daily. The 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 955 

combat on the floor of the House the violation of the secrecy 
of the Senate almost prove us both incapable and unworthy of 
having a Government as at present organized. The resolute 
adherence to Tariff the sectional hostility to Texas the 
increasing zeal and impertinence of the abolitionists show 
that the North and the South cannot exist united. I have not 
been for any length of time in close contact with my negroes 
until this year since 1839. I am astonished and shocked to 
find that some of them are aware of the opinions of the Presi- 
dental Candidates on the subject of Slavery and doubtless of 
much of what the abolitionists are doing and I am sure they 
know as little of what is done off my place as almost any set 
of negroes in the State. 1 fancy it may be fancy there is 
a growing spirit of insubordination among the Slaves in this 
section. In the lower part of this district they have fired 
several houses recently. This is fearful horrible. A quick 
and potent remedy must be applied. Disunion if needs be. 
It is very dry, but crops, particularly corn promising.

MY DEAR SIR. I send you by this Mail the paper printed at 
this place which contains the proceedings of this County on 
the Texas question. The Article in it addressed to Blair (the 
Editor) is the offspring of the pen of your excellent friend 
M r . Edwd Dixon. A young gentleman of good Talents, fine 
Character, and brave, chivalrous and manly. 

It is obvious to every eye that M r . Van Buren can no longer 
be upheld. Johnson and Muhlenberg have occurred to me as 
strong enough to carry the West and the North. With a 
Strong Man in the South also holding to Muhlenberg for the 
Vice Presidency success would be sure. 

The selection might then devolve on the House of Reps. 
Evil as this is, it is lesser evil than a surrender to the Whigs, 
whose success now is probable Success for twenty years to 
come perhaps to the euthanasia of our System, or the violent 
disruption of the Confederacy.

art, it is idle to think of. Tyler cannot be elected. I have 
not the slightest doubt of your having strength enough in 
Virginia to carry the State. The talent of the State is with 
you, its disinterestedness is with you, its principles with you, 
its virtue and patriotism with you. I will not close my eyes 
to night until I have written Ritchie. I think his character 
is not well understood by you. Gen 1 Bayley of the H. of 
Rep 8 has a fairer and truer appreciation of him than any one 
I know. Ritchie is not selfish he is not base. His char- 
acter combines in it some of the noblest virtues Steadiness 
in friendship, elevation in Morals, Stability of patriotism with 
great simplicity of character and therefore sometimes led 
astray by those to whom he may unwittingly have given his 
heart and his confidence. To these qualities he unites no 
common ability. I told him in 1825 that he was utterly igno- 
rant of you, and last winter he admitted it to me. He is val- 
uable as a friend, from the possession of those virtues, that 
grow in value (like the books of the Sybil,) because their pos- 
sessors have so greatly diminished in numbers. I never had 
his friendship, and have nothing from him to warp my judg- 
ment. I have narrowly watched him for thirty } r ears, and 
the result of my experience is the high estimate I have placed 
on his head and his heart. Talk with Bajdey of him, and do 
not allow Ritchie to do you longer injustice, by injustice in 
your opinion of him. 

I write freely to you for that is the province of friendship. 

I have refused in several instances to give letters to you, 
for persons desiring office. I hope it will not be regarded as 
a departure from the propriety under which I acted in these 
refusals, to bring to your care the claims of Edward Dixon. 

In all haste and with all Respect 
Yrs faithfully and cordially

From Francis Wkarton. 

Philadelphia, May 22 d 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much indebted to you for your good- 
ness in noticing my letter of a few weeks since. In common 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 957 

with most of the members of the bar here, of which though 
a young, I am somewhat an ambitious member, 1 feel a deep 
interest in the nomination to the vacant judgeship. I wish the 
matter were in your hands, I still trust that such matters 
may some day be but as it is, both the bar and the country 
will hope for the best in the tilling of that, and the remaining 
important vacancies. 

I cannot refrain expressing my anxiety at the troubles 
brooding over a northern wing of the Republican party. 
The south may be safe enough, but I see here no prospect of 
a safe reorganization. You will allow me to speak frankly 
on the subject of Mr. Tyler; and I believe I can truly say 
that so great is the distrust felt here towards him, that nomi- 
nated or not nominated, anti-Texas or pro-Texas, he will not 
collect a thousand votes in the state. Were not your own 
great name connected with his, the Texas question would be 
dragged by him into the dust. I am in the habit of occasional 
conversation with the old recognized leaders in this city, and 
I believe that it is the fear of his nomination alone that pre- 
vents them from coming out manfully. As it is, the argu- 
ment for immediate annexation has not come to us fairly. 
M r . Tyler's advocacy is suspicious, M r . Walker's Quixotic. 
Mr. Benton's speech, as I glanced at it in this evening's 
Globe, will produce a strong and abiding effect, unless its 
reasoning be controverted from a source entitled to the 
respect of the community. What Mr. Buchanan may do, I 
know not, and perhaps he may succeed in working a change. 
If such should be the case, and you should be brought forward 
as the annexation candidate, or Mr. Buchanan himself, or per- 
haps General Cass, Pennsylvania, New York, and New Hamp- 
shire might be snatched from Mr. Clay. But with M r . Tyler 
as a candidate, the game is up. The Texas scheme will become 
as rediculous as the Exchequer, and will be almost as easily 
crushed, at least in its present shape. Whatever office-seekers 
or office-keepers may say, I have no doubt that if the issue is 
to [be] made upon M r . Tylers reelection, we will not only be 
miserably but ludicrously defeated. 

If you could find time and opportunity to exhibit the bear- 
ing of the present treaty in such a manner as to recommend 
it to the republicans of the North, a great point would be 



958 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

gained. The published documents, to a Northern eye have 
a baldness which made me for one almost believe that the 
hand which purloined, had garbled them. Our instinct is in 
favour of the scheme, but our reason has not been sufficiently 
courted. The frankness, and I must add, the unexpected 
logicalness of M r . Van Buren's letter, has shaken some of our 
best friends, and I believe that to turn things round suddenly 
enough for the November election would require exertions 
superhuman. 

What then can be done ? I answer, we must bide our time. 
So great and unexpected a change of popular sentiment as 
that called for by the treaty cannot take place in a flash. I 
see no reason for doubting the opinion we held but a short 
time since, that the next election must go by default. Put 
M r . Clay in the Whitehouse, and, with a moderate degree of 
prudence and conciliation on our part, we will have the rever- 
sion to ourselves. If the states-rights party acts wisely, in 
one year, under a Whig president, it will dry up the Albany 
regency, and draw over its subjects. M r . Clay will be elected 
easily enough, and though good faith and policy both require 
we should oppose him, there is no probability that by doing so 
he will be defeated. Would not his election be safer for 
republican principles, with the necessary reaction in our 
favour which would follow, than would the election of any 
pro-Texas, pro-Tariff caucus democrat, such as Mr. Buchanan 
or General Cass? If we could succeed in November with a 
good and true man, we will be doing well, but of that I fear 
there is no hope. Under such circumstances I cannot but 
believe that our true policy is to prepare for the organisation 
of such an opposition as prudence and energy will enable us 
to collect, for the purpose of hampering Mr. Clay for his first 
term, and defeating him for his second. 

I hope to go to Washington in the course of the spring, and 
I believe I would long since have made the visit, in spite of 
the business claims, which, small as they are, I am trying to 
nurse into respectability, had I not been frightened by the 
accounts of the hosts of office hunters by which both you and 
the president are beset. I am still so young, and have still so 
very little political experience and political weight, that I feel 
almost backward, also, to attract a moment of your attention. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 959 

Not being, therefore, -either an office seeker, or a politician, I 
am almost unwilling to intrude upon the occupations of the 
capitol. But if in any manner or way I can be useful to you, 
or our own great cause, even a suggestion from you, will give 
me will to do, and energy in doing. 

Your faithful friend and servant

Baltimore Tuesday 10 O'Clock [May 28, 1844]. 

MY DEAR SIR I would have written before but for constant 
engagements. There are some things I cannot understand. 
1 saw it the moment 1 mingled with members at Washington. 
Your own friends talked of your name as out of the question 
at present &c, whereas I had been thinking that circumstances 
had taken place which made it eminently fit and proper that 
you should be pushed; and had so talked all the way over. 

Well I find hundreds here who all say you ought to be the 
man, but they cannot get at you &c. There has been some- 
thing wrong somewhere but where I cannot tell. Everything 
is uncertain here. Walker 1 have been with much he fights 
nobly, but does not see the end of his own moves. If they 
dispute all points, as they will do I think, it will end in con- 
fusion, and blowing up of the convention. All the members 
begin to see the nomination is in fact the election, and there- 
fore they will contend for every inch. The whole amount is 
that there will be no other conventions, and we have made the 
plat-form upon which they will break them down. 

It seems probable that, if any one is nominated it will be 
Cass and Johnson, but still a slight circumstance may change 
the whole. I never saw such excitement in my life Immense 
crowds every night and addresses in the streets &c. of the 
most vulgar demagoguism. 

As I return 1 will see you and hope to receive a letter from 
home which will be enclosed to you. 1 shall have no time to 
stay in Washington, and as I cannot get an interview with 
Gen 1 Anderson at all, I enclose the within note so that I can

receive the answer when I call to see you. Will you be so 
kind as to make a servant drop it at the Bank for me. 
Very truly 

F. W. PICKENS. 

P. S. My own impression is that the best result for us is 
the nomination of V. B. by a large majority and if it does 
not force rebellion it will bring defeat and odium upon his 
N. York clique and future prostration to Benton Wright &c. 
and the whole Dynasty. Perhaps it is better this than for us 
to be forced to acquiesce in a weak and uncertain ticket. 

8 O'clock night. 

Convention adjourned, last balot Cass 123 V. B. 99, John- 
son 21, Bucchanan 26 Calhoun 1. I begin to doubt any 
nomination being made. The V. B. men desperate great 
excitement. They will not agree to Cass. It is best for us 
to break up without agreeing. V. B. dead forever. They 
begin to see the consequences of things. It does seem to me 
that the South ought to agree to push you. I do not see why 
they don't but all are lifeless.

Legation of the U. S. of A., Mexico 30 th May 1844. 

SIK. I send you (nos 1, 2 3 and 4) two notes, which I ad- 
dressed to the Minister of Foreign Relations upon the subject 
of the Instalment, which fell due on the 30 th ulto; and his 
replies thereto. In addition I need only state that daily appli- 
cation has been made for the payment, but as yet none of the 
money has been paid. The Minister of Foreign Relations, in 
his note of the 6 th , states that the payment would be made on 
the following day, and in that of the 23 d , he says that the 
Minister of Hacienda had two days previous issued an order 
for the pa}^ment. Notwithstanding this, the money has not 
been paid, and the order has not been issued. This needs no 
comment. 

In the present posture of affairs, they do not wish to 
acknowledge their unwillingness or inability to pay; but the 
fact is that at present they have not the money. 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 961 

In relation to the Convention for the liquidation of claims, 
1 have already explained the difficulties in the way of its set- 
tlement. The same posture of affairs continuing, their excuse 
for not entering upon and concluding that Convention now is, 
that they are waiting for some documents of the late Commis- 
sion. This is nothing more than an excuse. 

Col. Thompson arrived in this city on the 22 d inst. After 
consulting with him as directed in your letter of introduction, 
I requested an interview with the Minister of Foreign Rela- 
tions for the following day. In that interview I presented 
the note, of which I send }^ou a copy (no. 5); and requested 
that the Mexican Minister at Washington should be author- 
ized to receive propositions and open negotiations for a bound- 
ary line between the two countries. I also requested that, if 
the Mexican Gov* should think proper to authorize its Minis- 
ter to do so, I might be informed thereof on tuesday, the 28 th . 
This w T as promised; but on tuesday the Mexican Minister 
informed me, that the President requested that M r Thomp- 
son's departure might be postponed, in order that he might 
previously have a conference with me on the subject of the 
proposed negociations. No 6 is a protocol of the conference 
with the President. No 7 is a copy of M r Bocanegra's reply 
to my communication. This reply was promised to me this 
morning; but was not received until nine o'clock tonight; 
and owing to the lateness of the hour, and want of time, I 
must refer you to Col. Thompson, who accompanied me to 
the Conference with the President, and who will be able to 
give you a full account of all that has transpired. 

He will also inform you that the course of the Mexican 
Gov* is entirely owing to the fact that they are under the 
impression that the Treaty for the annexation of Texas will 
be rejected by the Senate, and that they calculate upon our 
internal dissensions, growing out of the question of slavery. 

I send you files of the official paper, and refer you particu- 
larly to the article of the no of the 21 st May, which I have 
marked. 

I have the honor to be Very Respectfully Your obt sev*

From Francis Wharton. c. c. 

Philadelphia, May 31 st , 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR, I thank you most warmly for touching what 
with me, has turned out to be the true key on the Texas ques- 
tion. My "northern" eyes have at last opened, and the eyes 
of the one or two to whom I read your letter, who were 
previously strong opposers of the measure, have opened 
also. It is a duty owed by the North to the South. If I can 
be any way useful, as a writer, on the subject, let me know. 
If in the course of the campaign, a pamphlet is to be written, 
to embrace the Northern view, and if my services would be 
of any value, they are at your command. 1 wish my practice 
was sufficiently extensive to enable me not only to write, but 
to publish. 

I trust you consider Folk's nomination safe, it certainly 
has very much dashed the politicians in this neighbourhood. 
The first feeling was that of delight, not at Folk's nomina- 
tion, but that any nomination was made at all. The second 
feeling is one of wonder and curiosity. The Pennsylvania 
editors I mean, the editors of the Pennsylvania News- 
papers, have started on the hunt after M r . Folk's opinions, 
and have discovered, to their horror, that he is not only pro- 
Texas, but anti-Tariff. So far, so good. I will be very much 
gratified if M r . Pickens and M r . Elmer turn out to represent 
your opinions. As to M r . Dallas^ whom I knew very well 
personally, there is no one who professes for you a greater 
admiration. I met him a short time ago, when he told me he 
had just read my late review in the Democratic Review, and 
agreed with it thoroughly. He went on to say that there was 
one man who was the great man of this country, and that was 
M r . Calhoun. 



From James Hamilton. c. c. 

Oswichee Bend. June 14 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR. Since my last to you the Baltimore Conven- 
tion has met and done its nothingness for I really consider 
the nomination of Polk as nothing. I do not pretend to 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 963 

decide on the policy of your friends dropping you, but there 
is something certainly peculiarly unfortunate in the fate or 
condition of a party which compels it to pass over the first of 
its Men and to rally on those scarcely above mediocrit}^ M r 
Tyler's nomination would in reference to the Question of 
Annexation have been far more just and congruous than that 
of Polk. It must have been made by the Van Buren men 
expressly to be defeated or to illustrate the amiable fable of 
the Dog in the Manger. 

We passed on the 8 th of June Resolutions in this County 
providing for the call of a S Convention with a view to a 
Convention of all the States, to take into consideration the 
Slave Question. An address is ordered which I am to pre- 
pare to appear after the adjournment of Congress that we 
may avail ourselves of the result of its final proceedings on 
Annexation. I will endeavor to combine both moderation 
and prudence in the paper with a proper spirit. We are 
however without advices from our Members of Congress who 
have kept us entirely in the dark as to questions of remedy 
and redress. 

I wish to see whether the South has any pluck left if not 
the sooner we settle down into quiet submission and capitu- 
late with the enemy the better. We have talked and Bullied 
enough. 

I have written to Elmore to request Lewis to stop at Oswi- 
chee to meet me. If anything is to be done I think we may 
put Alabama in the lead if nothing why I will quietly return 
to my Cotton fields and wait with what fortitude I can the 
bursting of the Storm that cannot be a long way off. Come 
what may you have done yourself honor. 

I remain, My Dear Sir With sincere esteem 
Yours faithfully

Saturday, to the Mirth of the people I handled him without 
gloves.

From Friedrich Ludwig von Roenne. c. c. 

private. Berlin July 28 th 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR, I informed you some time ago, that a Board 
of Trade would be erected of which I was to be the President. 
Knowing the great interest you have always kindly taken in 
the affairs of my Country, I beg leave now to inform you, 
that the new Department has since been erected under the 
title of "Handels-Amt" and that the King has appointed me 
the President of the Department. There is to be a Council 
of Trade, besides, but this is to be no Department at all, only 
when I report to the King about commercial matters some of 
the other Ministers ought to be present and we then form the 
Council of Trade in which the King decides upon my report. 
I hope this new institution will prove beneficial to the devel- 
opement of our commerce and industry. I regret that the 
Senate have not ratified our treaty, but hope that our rela- 
tions will nevertheless continue as friendly as they were when 
I resided in the U. S. The new Department will, 1 trust, 
contribute to promote the intercourse between Germany and 
America and 1 hope our joint efforts will place it upon a firmer 
basis. Every body must see at once that two great countries 
with a vast population, the one of which has all sorts of raw 
products while the other has all sorts of cheap manufactures, 
and both of which are unrestricted by any consideration of 
colonial policy, seem to be destined by nature to trade with 
each other. There is one subject which is much in the way 
of the full developement of the commerce of certain provinces 
of Prussia. M r . Wheaton will write to you on the subject and 
I beg leave strongly to recommend it to your consideration. 
The shipping and commercial as well, as the planting interests 
of the U. S. are deeply concerned in the question. . . .

Nashville, July 29, 1844 

SIR, Having seen the letter which Co 1 Gadsden addressed 
to Gen 1 Jackson after conversing with you in relation to the 
difficulties yet in the way of attaching 1 Texas to our Union, 



LETTERS TO JOHN c. CALHOUN. 965 

it was my intention at that time to write to you, mentioning 
that no time had been lost in addressing to Houston a letter 
warning him of the designs of Great Britain but I was 
taken from home by engagements which have occupied me 
until now. 

That you may be fully apprized of what has been done, I 
think it best to send you a copy of the letter to Houston, 
which he will have received by the time you get this. If 
Houston could be induced to rely with any confidence on the 
success of the nominations of Mess 1 ' 8 Polk and Dallas I should 
suppose the advice offered him by the Gen 1 would be con- 
trolling. 

The danger is that he may not be able to stand up before 
his own people if the guarantee promised b}^ England and 
France is accompanied by terms otherwise very favorable to 
Texas. But of this accident w r e must run the risk, relying 
on the justice and force of those views which sustain the 
policy of the measure of annexation, and which we are sure 
must prevail as soon as the people of the United States under- 
stand the magnitude of the mischief which will result from 
the location of British influence on that frontier. 

The Clay party in this state have as perfect an organization 
as they had in 1840, and it will require the union of every 
democratic interest to break it down. The state is becoming 
almost an encampment. My belief is that the Democratic 
party will gain the victory, but that to do so much must be 
done that the lovers of good order must regret. We shall be 
obliged to encourage the association of military companies, 
and adopt all other honorable means of breaking the chain of 
such sway as was adopted by the Whigs in 1840 and as they 
yet maintain. 

I was gratified to hear from Co 1 Gadsden that you felt a 
deep interest in the success of Polk. 

I am very respectfulty y r obt servt

New York August 25 th 1844 

DEAR SIR I am very desirous of obtaining a copy of 
Burke's Report upon the .Rhode Island suffrage movement, 



966 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

which I am informed is now being printed at the Globe 
office. As I know of no better mode of procuring one than 
applying to you, I throw myself upon your kindness with 
the request, that you will forward me a copy, if you can with 
perfect convenience do so. 

I cannot refrain from taking this oppertunity, now that the 
National-Convention-Campaign is ended, to say a few words 
in relation to your political friends in this city. Having 
formed the only Calhoun organization that ever existed in 
this part of the Union, I may assume to have some knowledge 
of its members. In regard to political intelligence and fidelity 
to any cause they espouse, they are not excelled by any body 
of democrats in the Union. It was for your State right and 
constitutional views of our system of Government, that we 
preferred you as our candidate, and such was our fidelity, 
that after your own Southern friends had hauled down the 
Calhoun flag, we still kept it up, untill you became a member 
of the Cabinet. We then rallied to the Tyler Standard and 
have remained true to him untill his withdrawal, for which, 
as well as for his excellent letter, we feel both grateful and 
gratified, if for no other reason than that now we are free to 
go to the support of Polk and Dallas without any dishonor to 
ourselves. We are the last to leave any cause we pledge our- 
selves to support. 

Upon yourself or the President we have no reflections to 
make, but we have been greatly chagrined at the deficiency of 
organization and tact of your Southern friends, as well as at 
the heartlessness of his professing friends. Each of you may 
well say " Save me from my friends! " You for the inefficiency 
of yours, and he for the perfidy of his. 

After all, we have done much there is great reason for 
gratulation. A political Dynasty is broken down, a Texas 
Candidate is nominated and our principles of Revenue tariff, 
District system of representation and strict construction of 
the constitution are on the ascent towards ascendancy. 

I should be much pleased to receive from you, your Views 
of our political prospects as well as some hints as to the course 
to be pursued by your friends here. To what great point 
shall we direct our efforts ?

MY DEAR SIR Since I wrote you last I rec d . yours of the 6

showed it to some of your friends to prevent any misconcep- 
tion of your opinions. Events occurred after I wrote you 
wholly unexpected to me * M r . Stuart the Sen r . Editor of the 
Mercury has not been in Charleston, nor connected in any 
way with politics, so much as even to write a line for his 
paper for 14 months, until he suddenly threw off his inaction 
and without consultation that I can learn with any one out of 
the small circle in Beaufort, wrote that fiery Editorial which 
has caused so much excitement everywhere. I knew he was 
excited himself but I had no idea he would throw himself into 
such a position. M r . Clapp did not agree with him and felt 
fettered and embarrassed, but I fear even now he feels him- 
self called on to stand up to the lead. In Charleston the effect 
was at one moment alarming it produced in the old Union 
men a disposition to renew the old issues. Some of them 
thought it a most favorable opportunit} T to force us from our 
State Rights principles and drive us into a recantation or into 
a minority. They wished to join issue with the Mercury's. 
Leader and M r Rhett and cut them off and so weaken us who 
were left that if at any time hereafter we proposed to put the 
State on her Sovereignty, that we would be unable to move.

in action against the Tariff of 1842 during the whole term of 
the next Legislature. A public meeting was absolutely nec- 
essary, for either, he and those he could influence would take 
steps to bring the public mind to these points, or we must 
anticipate him. We had ascertained his views in a consulta- 
tion of a part of our active men, and as he would not recede 
and we could not concur with him, we took the lead and had 
our meeting and passed the Resolutions you have seen. So 
far I have heard no objections to our Course and am in great 
hope they will be satisfactory to allmost all our friends and 
go far to prevent any further divisions or to render them if 
inevitable less dangerous to the Union and good feeling of our 
Party. We so timed our proceedings as to send them to the 
great Macon Meeting, which the state of my health and pri- 
vate affairs prevented my attending. 

I have rec d . letters from M r . Seddon and from Howard of 
Georgia imploring us to turn aside the movements for State 
action. They said the measures proposed in South Carolina, 
were embarrassing them exceedingly and seemed to be ex- 
ceeding apprehensive that we would cause their defeat in V a 
and G a . I hope they will be relieved by our Resolutions. I 
wrote to both to Seddon particularly and requested him to 
get M r . Ritchie to notice and give our proceedings such an 
interpretation as would place us right before the Party. . . .

Edgewood 9 Sept. '44. 

MY DEAR SIR After great trouble and exhaustion I arrived 
at home yesterday from Tenn: I came across from Athens 
to Pendleton under an expectation I would meet you there. 
But when I got there I found you were not expected and I 
heard one of my children was very ill so I came directly 
through and did not see your family. 

Although I did not get to Nashville in time for the great 
convention l yet I flatter myself I got in time to do some good. 

1 Democratic mass convention, attended by several thousand men, August 15. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOTJN. 969 

I attended other meetings and addressed the people &c. I saw 
delegates from every state in the valley of the Miss: and I can 
assure you that all is right in that quarter. There is deep 
excitement and great activity, and what is best the canvass is 
conducted on our principles. I went over the whole ground 
as to measures and men with Polk (at whose house I spent two 
days) and there are no disguises. Everything is perfectly satis- 
factory. 1 wish I could have seen you. There is no connec- 
tion at all with the N. York managers and no correspondence 
even. Benton is off, and he is denounced everywhere. I was 
at Jackson's a day &c., and he conversed perfectly free with 
me upon all points. He tells me Benton will never be with us 
again and says "thank God! the party can do without him." 
He sent a message to Benton by his particular friend Judge 
Boldin, to the same effect but even stronger. Jackson says he 
is deranged b} 7 the explosion of that game. Polk is entirely 
untramtled and is determined if elected to do all he can to 
reform the Gov: and the 1 st thing is to reduce the Tariff of 
1842 to a revenue measure entirely and upon the principles of 
the compromise act; 2 d to introduce strict economy; 3 d acquire 
Texas at all hazzards. He will plant himself upon these meas- 
ures and look firmly to posterity to do him justice and without 
the slightest reference to temporary power as he has announced 
his determination not to look to re-election. He will look to 
integrity and qualifications solely for office and none will be 
removed except for deficiency in those points. I found him 
exceedingly friendly and we were very free, but of course I 
mention these things to you alone. None of the old leaders

mittees and writes to none but very general letters and in 
particular cases. The information is that every state in the 
valley will certainly go for him exept Kty. and Ohio and the 
probabilities are that the latter will go with us, particularly 
since Tyler's withdrawal.

judgement amongst ourselves to secure the fruits of a complete 
victory, and if we should be defeated, to organize a powerful 
opposition upon sound principles, and with the certainty of 
success. In 1832 we had no hearing with the Rep. party as 
Jackson had led them off and we had none with the National 
Rep. party as they were ags* us on principle, but now we are 
forcing the discussion upon our issues with the whole Demo- 
cratic party and they are just coming up to us. We have 
every prospect of having a combined and powerful union, and 
with the unsound portion of the party thrown off; now under 
these circumstances it is madness and folly, and worse 
unpatriotic, to seperate ourselves and throw off those who 
are with us in feeling and principle. All }^our friends in 
Nashville, Shelbyville and Huntsville Ala. conversed with me 
freely and anxiously. I stopped in Huntsville on my return, 
and the whole population from what I could- learn are deter- 
mined to move for you early after the Election. Judge 
Thompson, Col. M c Clang, Mr. Clements are all your friends 
and they are the leaders about Huntsville. 1 told them when 
they moved to call the people together, and commence by 
setting forth that "we the people are determined to manage 
the next presidential Election for ourselves alone, and there- 
fore nominate you as the people's candidate," &c. They will 
move in all North Ala. exactly where I want the move to 
commence in the heart of the old Jackson ranks. Your friends 
in Nashville say they can get at least 50,000 people to meet 
you in Nashville at any time. From all conversation and 
from what I have seen of the West I am satisfied that you 
ought to visit that country next May. Go early before an}" 
public move is made for you. I know you can do much. I 
never saw men so devoted to our cause than they are there, 
and I had such crowds of Gentlemen to call even on me that 
I talked myself perfectly hoarse every night. I know all they 
want is light. All our ideas are new to them and they seize 
them with the greatest eagerness. They are a shrewd people 
and patriotic. The only thing I had to contend agst was the 
sensativeness, that I feared, might be created in the breast of 
other gent, from distant states, from the excessive desire 
manifested to hear from So. Ca. to the exclusion of attention 
to others. I therefore rather avoided speaking when I could. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 97 1 

I Saw this feeling distinctly shewn in Mr. Melville of N. York. 
But I could utter no sentiment on the Tariff too strong for 
those people, and they are all becoming to understand it 
thoroughly. 

I think we have now every prospect of carrying the election. 
If N. York goes with us of course Polk is elected, but even if 
not and N. Jersey and Tenn. go still he is elected without N. 
Y. If Clay is defeated of course he is done, and will no longer 
be a disturbing force in the South. I think all our prospects 
are better than I have seen them for years. I am sure a calm 
and dignified course in yourself will give you the complete 
command of the future, and you know I have generally spoken 
my candid sentiments to you. I think things have developed 
now clearly who were your sincere friends and those who 
were so merely from selfish considerations. . 

I find this State perfectly calm and united out of Beaufort, 
and the only contrary appearance is exhibited in the Mercury. 

I heard M c Duffie was for Disunion, but I saw him for a few 
moments in Abbeville as I passed and he did not talk that way 
to me. I do not think he has any definite ideas. He seemed 
to deprecate the recent moves in Beaufort and Colleton as 
far as I could understand him, yet I confess he seemed more 
confused than I ever saw him. There were several present, 
amongst them Judge Wardlaw, and I denounced the mad 
schemes of those who were crying for seperate action. I 
afterwards took M C D. one side to talk freely with him and 
told him what I had heard of him he denied it and yet 
seemed indefinite said he preferred cesession to Nulification 
and that was all the idea he suggested. His health is much 
improved. 

I suppose the Oregon question is before 3^011 by this.

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote you a letter some time since, and 
though I do not know whether you are in Washington, I am

going to write you another. I have been for some time con- 
sidering the propriety of establishing a weekly paper in this 
city, based on the plan of the London Examiner or Spectator, 
designed to be both political and literary. M r . Gilpin 1 and 
M r . C. J. Ingersoll, whom I have consulted, both consider the 
plan to be judicious, and likely, if placed in enterprising 
hands, to be of great benefit to the republican party. I am 
half involved as editor, but before taking any step, I am 
anxious to consult with you. If it is got up here, under the 
patronage of the established party leaders, it will be soon 
Van Buranized and Silas Wrighted. There will be no help- 
ing it. They will control the subscription list, and contribute 
the capital. M r . Ingersoll will hand in a tariff article, and in 
it will go, and M r . Gilpin will load us with anti -Texas squibs 
which we will have to fire. We will be prevented from taking 
the republican stand, advocating the States rights party, 
rallying under your name, and what is worse, we will be 
hunker ised and Albany regency -ised till we settle into a 
weekly edition of the Pennsylvanian. 

For such a cause, I have no taste. It is my ambition to 
fall into other ranks, and it would give me the greatest pleas- 
ure to devote, unrepayed, my time to the dissemination of 
your views in the Northern States. I believe it could be done 
with success. I see great need for an organ which would do 
so north of the Potomac. I am fully confident of the ability 
of myself, and those who would be associated with me, to put 
the matter firmly and attractively before the public. If we 
mean to move, however, we must be started; if we do not lean, 
primarily, upon the North for subscribers, we must lean on the 
South. Could not twenty gentlemen be found who will con- 
tribute fifty dollars apiece as shareholders, for the establish- 
ment of such an organ f ( A paper coming out weekly, under 
such auspices, with such declared views, at two dollars and a 
half a year, could, I am sure, run up a large and active list 
of subscribers. I have consulted with the publisher of the

would succeed; and with some government, and more per-

From Memucan ffunt. 1 

Private Galveston, Texas, October 2 nd 1844 

MY DEAR SIR, The present momentous position of this 
country induces me to take the liberty of addressing you this 
note with view of stating our situation and making some sug- 
gestions in relation to what should be our present policy and 
actions and of asking yours in reply. 

It is doubtful from the course he has heretofore pursued 
and from what I can learn whether M r Anson Jones, the Pres* 
elect of Texas, is favorable to our union with the U. S. The 
recent appointments of M r Terrell as Minister to Great Brit- 
ain and Mr. Reily to the U. S., both of .whom are avowed 
opponents of annexation when added to the recent zealous sup- 
port of the British party in Texas of M r Jones for Pres* with 
the declaration, in some instances, on their part, that they 
voted for M r Jones because he was opposed to annexation is 
calculated to increase these doubts. I hope however they are 
unfounded. When I saw him last, which was in February, we 
held frequent conversations on the subject and I can assure 
you that he was at that time an unreserved advocate of the 
measure, yet he may have changed since the defeat of the 
treaty for that object, by the U. S. Senate. Whether he has, 
or has not, I am satisfied that if your congress will pass a law 
providing for the union within the next twelve months, that 
at least two thirds of both houses of the congress of Texas will 
ratify the same. 

There is no guaranty however that this would be the case at 
a later date. The very policy I, as one of the citizens of this 
country, shall recommend to my friends in congress to adopt 
whilst I believe it is calculated to hasten your action in favor of 



1 Memucan Hunt was charge des affaires of the Republic of Texas at Washington in 
1837, and is noted as having at that time made proposals of annexation. 



974 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

the measure will at the same time tend to create a powerful 
party in this country, opposed to it. The recommendation I 
shall offer is a simple reduction by law of our import duties to 
10 per cent, or even 8, or 6, ad valorem on all products and man- 
ufactories of any country which will admit the products and 
manufactories of Texas on the same conditions, and to such 
countries as refuse an acquiescence a requisition of discrimi- 
nating duties of from 25 to 200 per cent. This proposition 
would, doubtless, be exceeded to by Great Britain, France and 
Belgium Texas being exclusively an agricultural country. 
The result of this if it is adopted, will be great, very great, 
injuries to both the manufactures and revinues of the U. S., 
for, as I stated officially to your Gov* in 1837 it will be impos- 
sible to prevent smuggling from one country to the other when 
their tariffs of duties materially differ. The passage of such 
a law, as the one I have refered to, in the event of its being 
met with reciprocal regulations in Great Britain and the other 
powers of Europe with which we have treaties, of which 
there is little doubt, would at once engage capital enough at 
this place to supply the valley of the Mississippi with all the 
goods they need the duties of which exceed 20 per cent. The 
proprietors of the great manufacturing interests in the U. S. 
foreseeing this result, will, it appears to me, become advocates 
of immediate annexation, for, without it, the state of trade 
above depicted will destroy or greatly impair their prosperity 
and they are surely wise enough to foresee that if Texas once 
adopts this, almost free trade system and its citizens derive 
the benefits that will certainly accrue to them from it they will 
become opposed in a very short time to annexation. The ex- 
pences of our government is a mere nothing and 8 or 10 per 
cent duties will pay them. Agriculture would be greatly pro- 
moted by such a system of trade and the wealth of the mer- 
cantile interest in such a state of things would soon greatly 
control all classes of our citizens and I can not say but that in 
twelve months after its adoption a majority of the people of 
Texas would be opposed to annexation, and backed as they 
would be, doubtless, by Great Britain and France it would be 
impossible for the U. S. to force a connexion at an after time. 
As an individual and one who consulted alone his individual 
happiness and prosperity for life I should be opposed to

annexation myself and were it [not] coupled with the para- 
mount security of Republican institutions in the U. S. and the 
prosperity and happiness of so many millions of the human 
family I should now oppose it. 

If you think I am wrong in my views as regards the best 
policy to be adopted by Texas to procure speedy annexation 
be pleased to communicate to me any other policy you may 
think is better. There is no public measure, whatever, the 
result of which causes me half the solicitude. I believe that 
the success of mankind in sustaining republican institutions 
depend upon it. I have the pleasure to forward a slip from 
a newspaper along with this announcing the arrival of Gen 1 
Duff Green as U. S. Consul at this place. No officer of any 
Government, or of any grade has ever been welcomed among 
us with as much cordiality and respect as the Gen 1 was on his 
arrival. It is a matter of surprise here to every person, with 
whom I have conversed upon the subject that Gen 1 Green had 
not been appointed minister to Texas. I assure you the 
appointment could not be confered on a gentleman who would 
be more welcome to the Texian Nation in that capacity. 

I have written in great haste. The Orleans packet that 
bears this has wrang its last bell. I have not time to read 
over what I have written and make the necessary corrections. 
You will be pleased therefore to excuse errors and omissions. 
I have the honor to be With great regard

MY DEAR SIR From Gov Shannon's Official dispatch you 
will learn that he has as yet received no reply to his letter to 
the Mexican Minister on the subject of Texas. I learn that a 
reply is in the course of preparation and that it may be ex- 
pected in the course of a few days. Gov Shannon 1 having 
determined to avail himself of the English Courier which leaves

976 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

to morrow, I will remain a few days longer, that he may for- 
ward the reply by the Brig Lawrence which is now at Vera 
Cruz waiting his orders to convey me to Galveston. 

I am convinced that it is impossible to obtain the consent of 
this Government to the Cession to the United States of Texas, 
California or any part of the public domain of Mexico what- 
ever. I proceed to give you my reasons for thinking so. 

The policy of Santa Anna has been for years since the time 
of M r Poinsett, 1 to foster a prejudice ag*. the United States. 
His purpose has been to occupy the public mind of Mexico 
with the apprehension of an invasion from the United States, 
and make his Countrymen believe that he alone can protect 
them and the interests of Mexico. The Mexicans are ignorant 
and jealous of all foreigners and especially of the North Amer- 
icans, and all the measures which Santa Anna has taken against 
foreigners are popular in Mexico. He excited a national 
sentiment throughout the whole Country, which is strength- 
ened bv the apprehensions of the Priests who fear that the 
whole country will be overrun by us and that the Confiscation 
of the Church property will follow. The fundamental law 
forbids the Executive to alienate any portion of the public 
Domain without the consent of Congress, and such is the state 
of parties that if either Congress or the Executive wished to 
Alienate Texas, it would be opposed by the other and made 
the pretence for a revolution. 

Indeed Santa Anna left here on the 12 th of September for 
Marugo and Clava, under a confident belief that the Army 
would pronounce against Congress and make him Protector 
for life. His partisans were divided, in opinion, many of 
them urging him to assume supreme power at once, but he 
feared that if he overthrew the Congress a counter Revolution 
would ensue, and he might forfeit his life. He has about ten 
thousand soldiers at Jallapa and Vera Cruz, that he might 
throw the responsibility on the congress, he availed himself of 
the occasion of the death of his wife to retire, and Canalizo a 
creature of his will was appointed President ad interim. The 
government press and the partisans of Santa Anna Every 
where denounced Congress for failing to make the necessary 

i U. S. Minister in Mexico, 1825-1829; see p. 190. 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 977 

appropriations for the "War of Texas" and thus endeavored 
to make the failure to vote the means of prosecuting that war 
the pretence for the overthrow of Congress and declaring 
Santa Anna Protector for life. The Arm} 7 is nominally 35,000 
men. Congress had voted 30,000 more and had voted an appro- 
priation of four millions of dollars for that war, to be raised 
by a special tax. Of that tax a very small part had been col- 
lected, and the greater part, more than it is believed can be 
realised, had been anticipated by drafts of the Government in 
favor of favorite contractors. It was with great difficulty 
that funds could be raised from week to week to pay these 
troops on which Santa Anna relies for personal protection, and 
instead of marching men into Texas, they cannot find money 
to send troops into the Districts where their presence is 
required to enforce the Collection of the Taxes. 

When I reached here it was believed that things had reached 
a crisis. A Pronunciamento was daily expected. Santa Anna, 
his old wife not yet one month in the grave, had married a 
young Girl of 16, by proxy, and I met her on the way to Jal- 
lapa, under the charge of her Godfather (Camdo) where she 
was to meet her husband. The plan was for the Army to 
pronounce against Congress and to call Santa Anna from his 
retirement who was to sacrifice his domestic happiness and, 
leaving his young wife, again to take upon himself the cares 
of state to save his Country. In the mean time the opposition 
in Congress and throughout the Country gained strength. 
The Senators and deputies became bolder. They had voted 
four millions for the war of Texas, Santa Anna demanded ten 
millions more. The opposition demanded an exhibit of the 
manner in which the four millions had been applied and de- 
fended themselves upon the ground that the sum voted had 
been absorbed by the ministers and that they would vote no 
more without a change of ministers. Each party professing 
to wish the reconquest of Texas, and both using the Texas 
question as a means of masking their own movements. Both 
relying on the Army, not to reconquer Texas but to revolu- 
tionise the Government. Santa Anna has the advantage of 
being in power, and of having surrounded himself by men 
who are dependant upon him for their Commissions, is with- 
out the means of paying his troops. The exhausted condition

of the treasury and the unwillingness of the people to pay 
direct taxes, must soon bring a crisis. In one district a tax 
collector was killed and in another the people have refused to 
pay and troops left here yesterday to enforce the payment. 
It is well understood that both parties are doing all they can 
to defeat the measures of each other and to throw upon their 
opponents the odium of the Revolution which both declare 
must soon take place. The opposition wish to drive Santa 
Anna to pronounce against and dissolve the Congress, hoping 
that the reaction in favor of the Constitutional Government 
and of Congress will enable them to effect a Counter revolu- 
tion. In which case Santa Anna and his principal advisers 
will in all probability lose their lives. On the other hand 
Santa Anna thinks that as Things are getting worse and worse 
the Country will soon call him to the exercise of absolute 
power, in which case he will shoot his enemies. 

In such a state of things In the midst of a Civil Conflict, 
where each party is seeking pretences to murder and confis- 
cate the property of their opponents, and where the principle 
[is maintained] that it is treason to sell any part of the public 
domain to the United States, it is worse than folly to suppose 
that either party can alienate any part of Texas or California. 

1 have ascertained too that the Mexican bond holders in 
England, hold a mortgage on the Californias to secure the 
pa}^ment of twenty six millions of deferred debt, which mort- 
gage expires in 1847. * 

You will naturally ask, if such is the condition of the 
Country, why is it the Mexican Government will not sell? 
As the Gov*. is so much in debt and unable to raise money but 
by direct taxation why do they not disband the army, econo- 
mise their expenditure and sell a part of their territory which 
they must soon lose by revolution? 

The answer is u that the arguments of the public interest 
and public dut}^, are in vain addressed to both parties. The 
purpose of Santa Anna and his party is to establish a military 
despotism, and hence they find an argument in the discord 
and disorganisation of the government. Both parties look to 
power as a means of enriching the official encumbents. The 

1 So ran the frequent rumor at this time, but Bancroft, California, IV, 298, says there is

embarrassed Condition of the Treasury, enables them to pur- 
chase in demand against the Government at a discount, and 
the command of the Treasury enables them to pay the claims 
thus purchased in preference to all others. It is said a seat 
in the Cabinet with a salary of $6000 per annum enables a 
minister to realise $500,000 per annum. Santa Anna him- 
self, it is said, makes a large sum by the sale of Commissions 
in the Army and in the Customs, and besides he has large 
Haciendas on which he feeds large droves of cattle, which are 
sold to the Army at three times the usual market prices. 

You will see that the war against Texas is the pretence on 
which both parties are seeking office and that the embarrassed 
condition of the Treasury is used as a means of enriching 
those who have possession of the Government. When to this 
you add the fact that the state of public opinion is such that 
any party, being in power, and selling Texas or California to 
the United States, would be driven from office and that the 
chances are as ten to one that their doing so would be used as 
an argument for shooting them and confiscating their property, 
You can then understand why 1 say that it [is] impossible to 
make any new arrangement with Mexico as to Texas or Cali- 
fornia for some time }^et to come, at least. 

I believe that there is one way and but one in which all that 
our Government desire and much more than you ask for can 
be had, but I am not now prepared to submit my Views to 
paper. 1 reserve them for personal explanation, and until 
after I have visited Texas. 

In the mean time permit me to call your attention to the 
Mortgage on the Californias. I am told that it contains a 
condition that if the money is not paid in 1847, the Creditors 
shall take possession of the Country. The British Consul 
Gen 1 , here is the agent of the Creditors. I have endeavored 
to obtain a copy of the Deed, but cannot do it without pay- 
ing fifteen hundred or two thousand dollars for it. Permit 
me to say that it is important that you should obtain this 
through our minister here or in London, as the possession 
of California will necessarily command the settlements on the 
Columbia. 

The Tactics of the opposition is not to assail Santa Anna 
personally, but his ministers. He has been compelled to 



980 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

sacrifice Trigueros, Minister of the Treasury, and others are 
expected to follow. Each removal adds to the list of his 
enemies, and as each new incumbent comes into office to play 
the game of his predecessor, and enrich himself and his asso- 
ciates by plundering the treasury, the same opposition Con- 
tinues. Thus in the face of Governor Shannon's letter and 
the declaration that a war with the United States is inevitable 
the House of Deputies by a vote of 43 to 13 a few days ago, 
refused the loan of ten millions demanded by Santa Anna. 
The* present Government may therefore temporise, but we 
have nothing to hope from Mexico. They cannot reconquer 
Texas but they will not sell Texas. The revolution here may 
be delayed. It ma} r not be a bloody or a protracted Civil War, 
but to me it appears that a revolution is inevitable and that 
nothing but an army can prevent a Civil War. The Army is 
said to be as much divided as the Congress. 

Yours truly DUFF GREEN

I am told Santa Anna, to whom it was sent at Jalapa, has 
directed it to be transmited to Congress and that it will be Sent 
in tomorrow. 1 am also advised that he is not displeased with 
the document as he thinks he can turn it to his advantage by 
forcing Congress to. take the responsibility of abandoning the

renewing the war against Texas so long as it is believed that 
the U. S. will have to be encountered as well as Texas. Con- 
gress will now be compelled to act and provide the means to 
carry on the war or abandon it. The former they will not do 
for various reasons. In the first place they are determined to 
give Santa Anna no more money, and in the second place they 
have no Bourse from which to raise the money without pro- 
ducing a revolution. The five millions appropriation will not 
produce more than two and a half and that is already exhausted 
and more than antisipated by drafts on the treasury. The 
people are now taxed be} r ond indurence and while I am writ- 
ing the Government is sending troops to the South to enforce 
the payment of this tax. Their retched prohibatory system 
has nearly Cutoff all revenue from importations and the inter- 
nal resourses are gone. I See it is predicted in some of the 
papers in the U. S. that Mexico will declare war against the 
U. S. ; there is as much probability that the Emperor of China 
will do so. Gen 1 Green will give you the details of the polit- 
ical rumors and speculations here. 1 did not think it prudent 
to put them in my official Dispatch. His views and opinions 
of things here may, I think, be relied on. The U. S. Brig 
Laurence (Capt Jarvis) is now at Vera Cruz waiting my orders. 
As my Dispatch and Accompanying documents are highly 
important and should be in Washington City before the meet- 
ing of Congress I have transmited them to Capt Jarvis and 
directed him to go direct to Pensacola and to deliver my dis- 
patches at that place to Lieutenant Pennockwho is instructed 
to convey them to Washington by the nearest and quickest 
route. Considering the uncertainty of the mails this season of 
the year, and the possibility of the packages being miscarried 
or not reaching you in time I have thought it would best meet 
with your approbation to pursue the course I have above stated. 
There has been a new minister of finance appointed in the 
place of Mr. Trigueros who has been permited to retire. The 
new minister is about issuing a general order suspending the 
payment of all drafts on the Treasury for the want of money. 
It is said and, I believe truly, that there is not a dollar in the 
Treasury. The next instalment due our Citizens will be pay- 
able in a day or two but I do not think it will be possible for 
the Government to raise the means to make the payment. It

Unofficial Private 

DEAR SIR; It is contended, and I doubt not honestly believed, 
by no inconsiderable number of the citizens of the United 
States, that Great Britain has no designs either immediate 
or ulterior upon Texas. In this is to be found the only 
justification for the rejection by the Senate of the Annexation 
Treaty. Mr. Clay in one of his letters says: "If any Euro- 
pean nations entertains any ambitious designs upon Texas, such 
as that of colonizing her, or in any way subjecting he?*, I should 
consider it as the imperative duty of the government of the 
United States to oppose such designs by the most firm and deter- 
mined resistance, to the extent if necessary by appealing to 
arms." This I am disposed to regard as being a sentiment 
which prevails generally amongst the party of which he is the 
acknowledged leader. Of course it cannot be in favor with 
the nether end of it the Abolitionists and Old Hartford con- 
ventionists. 

Now it is imperative, on everv lover of his country, who is 
under the impression ." that any European nation " "entertains 
any ambitious designs upon Texas," to contribute all in his 
power to the establishment of the fact, and I, therefore, under 
a solemn sense of duty, transmit to you my testimony. About 
eight months ago a Treaty was concluded at Paris between 
the Hanse-towns and Texas by their respective representa- 
tives, Baron von Rompf 2 resident Minister there, and Col. 
Dainger field, accredited to the Hague and the Hanse-towns. 
It was forwarded soon afterwards to Bremen and Hamburgh

for ratification. The " Burgher's Convent*' of the former 
City, before which it was laid for approval, accepted it and 
authorized the Senate to transmit it to the capitol of Texas 
for the action of Congress, which assembles in December, 
which, as I learn from a high source, was accordingly done. 
An Exequator was then granted to the Consul for Texas. At 
Hamburgh the Treaty met with slight opposition, some of its 
stipulations not being altogether satisfactory, and it was post- 
poned for further consideration. But no question, as I under- 
stand, was raised relative to the independence of Texas. Her 
right to negotiate Treaties had been recognized by the Hanseatic 
Minister in his negotiations witli the Texas Charge at Paris. 
It is proper for me to remark, that during the early stage of 
the pendency of this matter at Hamburgh, tidings reached 
Europe that an annexation Treaty had been concluded at 
Washington. British influence now commenced its wily 
operations, successfully but unseen, and final action was pro- 
crastinated and avoided on the Treaty, so long, that about three 
weeks since Col. Dangerfield who was staying at the Hague, 
suspecting that something was wrong, repaired to Hamburgh. 
Immediately after his arrival there the Mexican Consul Gen- 
eral addressed a note to the Senate of Hamburgh, protesting 
against the ratification of the Treaty with Texas; and, as I am 
assured, subsequently refused to certify the papers of the ship 
"Najade," bound to Vera Cruz with merchandize, until he 
received from that body a satisfactory decision. The Treaty 
of "Navigation and commerce" between Mexico and the 
Hanse-towns expired by limitation in August and as the 12 
months notice, required before it can expire, has not been 
given by either of the contracting parties, Mexico now threat- 
ens if Texas is acknowledged by Hamburgh to make reprisals 
upon Hanseatic vessels. I have no positive evidence of the 
truth of this latter statement, but for the last day or two, it 
has been currently rumored. The Senate of Bremen received 
a note, also, from the Mexican Consul at this place, making a 
similar protestation to that at Hamburgh. A question arose 
whether Bremen should recede from the position which it had 
taken and notify the government of Texas of this determina- 
tion, previous to the meeting of Congress, or disregard the 
Protest utterly, with the risk of alienating itself from Ham-

burgh the last of its confederates (Lubeck excepted) of the 
once powerful Hanseatic League ? It was a most momentous 
one, and public opinion as far as it expressed itself, prepon- 
derated in favor of the former policy. Such a trial Bremen 
never experienced. While the excitement was at its heighth, 
I was, unofficially, asked for a frank expression of my senti- 
ments on the subject. As an American citizen (not as U. S. 
Consul) as one who felt as if the unalterable principles of 
justice had been grossly, wantonly outraged by the vile con- 
duct of Mexico, urged on by England I gave them full} 7 , 
unreservedly. It is revolting to the feelings of humanity, to 
the philanthrophy which characterizes the age in which we live, 
that the civilized world should permit Mexico to raise a ques- 
tion touching the right of Texas to enter into treaties at this 
late period. The battle of San Jacinto terminated the strug- 
gle between the two countries and the war waged since by 
Mexico, is merely a quasi one. I am now confidentially ad- 
vised, from a high quarter, that come what may Bremen will 
adhere rigidly to her original purpose. At her head is the 
great Burgliermeister Smidt, not only the master spirit of 
the Hanseatic Republics, but one of the most distinguished 
personages in Germany, renowned all over Europe as one of 
the most talented members of the Congress of Vienna of 1815. 
And here allow me to ask a question, what stand would the 
United States assume, if in consequence of the policy adopted 
by Bremen, one of her ships should be captured by a Mexican 
man-of-war while on a voyage to Galveston? It is known 
that Bremen has no Navy whatever, to protect her commerce. 
Hamburgh is an English city, almost as much under the 
control of the British Ministry, as Washington is under the 
control of the Federal Government. Its merchants derive 
their chief benefits, in Trade, from England. They are in 
realit} 7 English factors and the nation does everything that it 
can to sustain and encourage them. The postage on Letters 
from London to Hamburgh, by the Royal mail, is only about 
one-third of that charged to Altona, when the distance to the 
two places is the same! If Great Britain had said to Hamburgh, 
I have recognized Texas long since; it is your duty to do so, 
it is idle to suppose that the matter would have been unneces- 
sarily delayed for one moment. But unfortunately in her 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 985 

diplomacy and in her general relation to the world savage or 
civilized she is actuated by no higher principle than interest. 
If she can cut off Texas from the German markets, she embar- 
rases in a pecuniary point of view its citizens, and puts them 
in a condition to accept such overtures as she may hereafter 
make. If she can prevent its recognition by other powers 
she creates additional objections in Europe against its annexa- 
tion to the U. States. I have watched her stealthy movements 
so closely for the last two years that I can see through all her 
artificies. Hanover, whose king is one of her subjects, is ready 
to act any part which may be assigned it. Through him she 
has control of the Elbe, and uses it when necessary to tame 
any refractory spirit that may be evinced at Hamburgh. 

The Mexican Consul General is said to be on terms of the 
closest intimacy with the British Consul General, a f unctionery 
who receives a salary four times as large as that given to } r ou, 
in payment of the weighty duties discharged by you, and who 
no doubt uses it freely, in the accomplishment of important 
measures. Moreover I have been kindly permitted to read 
letters from English Merchants in Hamburgh to their corre- 
spondents, expressing the greatest delight at the u bold stand," 
as they termed it, taken by the Mexican Consuls. 

The " Protests" of certain powers in Europe and the mani- 
fest opposition of others against the annexation of Texas, 
should be regarded by our government in the light they are 
intended, as mere scare-crcnvs. No nation dare go to war with 
us. Rothschild holds the purse-strings, and he will never 
untie them for the purposes of war anywhere. His own safety 
forbids such a belief, for let any state become involved in war 
with America and revolution would succeed revolution in 
Europe. But the time may come when Great Britain will be 
immensely formidable to us. In the unsettled condition of 
Spain she may secure a foothold on Cuba, and through her 
machinations Texas, rather than come under the galling yoke 
of Mexico, may throw itself into her arms. Then, then indeed, 
she would no longer feel that dependence on us for our Cotton, 
which now exists, and surrounding us by her armies and her 
fleets, she would humble us to the very dust of the earth. 
Would to Heaven that my countrymen could stand where \

British duplicity. With one voice they would exclaim to

(Private) [Oct. or Nov. 1844] 

MY DEAR SIR M r . Otis, our Consul at Basle, has recently 
been in Paris, to confer with me relative to the affair of Kos- 
ter. I found him to be an intelligent Gentleman, and judg- 
ing from his conduct and efforts to procure Roster's arrest, 
I should say he is a zealous and active agent of the Govern- 
ment. The compensation his consulate affords is insufficient 
for his support. M r . Otis could, without any inconvenience 
to persons engaged in commerce with Switzerland, discharge 
all the duties of Consul for the whole Confederation; this 
would afford to him the means of living as an American Con- 
sul should. The Consul at Zurich is a Swiss permanently set- 
tled there, and extensively engaged in commerce; and the 
Merchants are generally opposed to submitting their Invoices 
to a Consul whose commercial operations conflict with their 
own. The objection seems to be reasonable, and wherever 
our Government can command the services of native citizens 

1 William R. King (1786-1853), who had been senator from Alabama from 1818 to 1844, 
was Minister to France from April 1844 to September, 1846, after which he served again 
in the Senate from 1848 to 1853, and was Vice-President under Pierce, dying early in the 
latter's administration. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 987 

who are not engaged in commerce, it would certainly be desir- 
able to do so. Would it not also be advantageous to reduce 
the number of our consular agents and extend the sphere of 
the duties of those employed ? I make this suggestion from 
a conviction that the character of our Country not unfre- 
quently suffers by the improper conduct of its consuls at 
points where the fees of office are insufficient to afford them a 
support. Their official station gives to them a credit which 
unfortunately they but too often abuse. Would it not be 
well to present to the next Congress a plan for the revision of 
our entire Consular system ? The subject of emancipation in 
the French Colonies engages much attention here, and will 
probably be brought before the Chambers this Winter. The 
Abolitionists of England, commanding imence pecuniary 
resources, are opperating, I fear but too successfully, through 
the medium of the French press: which is altogether venal. 
It is well understood that many of the prominent Journals in 
Paris are in the pay of the society of Exeter Hall; and they 
abound in publications containing the most false and exager- 
ated statements on the subject of slavery. If France influenced 
by the efforts now making, should abolish slavery in her Col- 
onies, Spain and Brazill will be compelled to yield to the 
pressure which will be brought to bear upon them; and the 
United States will be left to stand alone, with the whole civilized 
world against her. Tis here then, that this great question, so 
vitally affecting our interests, should be met. The selfish objects 
of the British Government should be clearly and fully presented 
to the people of France. They should be made to understand 
that under the pretext of humanity towards the Slave, the 
real object is to ingross to herself the entire production of 
Shugar and in a great degree, that of cotton and Rice and 
through the medium of her East India possessions. To effect 
this the Press must be employed, which can only be effected 
with money. The Delegates of the French Colonies are 
doing all they can to enlighten the public mind, and to coun- 
teract the efforts of England; but as I know their means are 
limited, I have thought that a small portion of the secret or 
contingent fund at your disposal could not be more usefully 
employed, than by procuring the insertion in the Paris papers 
(now closed against us) of well written articles, calculated to 



988 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

disabuse the public mind here, as to the actual condition of 
the Slaves of our Country. Indeed I have long thought that 
our Representatives abroad could greatly subserve the public 
interest, could they be allowed access to the press in the 
countries to which they are accredited, as it is, they see our 
Institutions stigmatized and our people calumniated without 
the means of counteracting the false impressions thus made 
to our prejudice. Should you think my suggestions worthy 
of your attention, and that you can with propriety apply a 
part of the fund to the object designated, I would recom- 
mend M r . Walsh our present Consul, 1 as admirably qualified 
to prepare the proper articles for publication, as his long res- 
idence in France has enabled him to form correct opinions, 
not only of its Government and people; but as to the best 
mode of opperating either on their Judgement or feelings. 
He would engage in it with the utmost zeal; for his heart is 
truly American. 

I had the pleasure of seeing M r . and M rs . Clemson often 
during their short stay in Paris; and of presenting M r . Clem- 
son to the King and Royal Family, by whom he was most 
cordially received. I have no doubt they will be pleased with 
Brussels, which I consider a much more agreeable residence 
than Paris. The climate here is execrable, cold and damp. I 
have suffered much from rheumatism, and my hand is so dis- 
abled that it is with difficulty I can hold my pen. I fear the 
Winter will knock me up entirely. The accounts I receive of 
the Presidential Contest are cheering. Polk and Dallas have 
united our distracted Party, and with the aid of the Texas 
question, are carrying all before them. God grant them suc- 
cess; for I should view the election of Clay as a death blow 
to our national prosperity, if not to the Government itself. 
Two children have been born to the Royal Family since my 
arrival here, and the King informed me, that he had with his 
own hand, written two letters to the President informing him 
of the interesting events. No answer to them has as yet been 
received by me. In matters of that kind there should be as 
little delay as possible, as much importance is attached to 
them here. Neither have I received your letter to Governor

Shannon, although those addressed to M r . Irving and M r . 
Wheaton 1 arrived safely and were delivered to them. If there 
is any place where it is of importance that the American 
Minister should be constantly advised of all that relates to 
the movements connected with the Texas question, it cer- 
tainty is here. At present all looks well and I have no reason 
to apprehend any action on the part of this Government to 
which we could reasonably object, still it is of the utmost 
importance that I should be kept ad vised of all that takes place 
on our side of the Water. The King of the French has re- 
turned from his visit to Queen Victoria. He is much elated 
with the reception he met with, which was no doubt natter- 
ing. But all this billing and cooing of the Sovereigns cannot 
change the character of their people, nor eradicate the deep 
rooted hostility which the[y] entertain towards each other. 
Louis Phillippe manifests, I fear, too anxious a desire to 
maintain peace with his haughty Neighbours. Tis certainly 
his true policy, but may be pressed too far. The French are 
a proud and sensitive people; and any manifestation on his 
part of truckling to England, would arouse a spirit in the 
nation, which would probably prove fatal to his dynasty. 1 
regret that he is not as popular as he desires to be, for France 
was never more prosperous than under his wise and pacific 
policy, and I sincerely wish that his reign may be long. He 
is emphatically a man suited to the times; for having been 
taught in the school of adversity he has a just appreciation of 
men and things which peculiarly fits him for the high destiny 
to which he has been called. I converse with him often, and 
freely; and my intercourse with him has been all that I could 
desire. M r . Guizot is able and adroit. He has a strong 
leaning towards England, whose Government is his beau 
ideal. He is also represented by those who profess to know 
him well, to be deceptive and false. Had this character of 
the prime Minister been furnished me on my arrival, I should 
have reduced his conversation relative to Texas to writing, 
and submitted to him for correction; so as to bind him to his 
declarations, beyond the possibility of cavil or denyal. His 
enemies say he will not hesitate to lie, whenever he thinks he

can gain by so doing. He is probably at this very time one 
of the most unpopular men in France, yet sustained by the 
King, he will command a decided majority of the Chambers, 
and for the present is secure in his position. Present me 
respectfully to the President and Lady. Also to my Friends 
Wilkins, Mason, Bibb, and Nelson and Krawley [Cralle].

I am faithfully your Ob*. Serv*.

Senate Chamber [Columbia]. 6 Nov. 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR I enclose back the letter and have only to 
say that I have enquired from all quarters to ascertain as 
near as possible what was the popular vote in this State in 
favour of Polk &c. 

The result is that all agree that the aggregate vote of the 
state is full} r 58,000 and that in no calculation can they give 
Clay more than 6000. So that would leave Polk a majority 
of 52,000. I think this is about right. 

I have not heard a word from you. M c Duffie has written a 
letter to the Speaker Colcock denouncing my resolutions, and 
urging immediate and decided steps. What is his precise 
idea as to the mode of action 1 am not aware as he does not 
state it in his letter to Colcock. But judging from what these 
very few violent men, who seem to feel with him and are 
shewing his letters, sa} r and do I should infer that cecession 
is the remedy. 

I have no idea that such a course will meet with any appro- 
bation. My resolutions will pass the House, I am now 
informed by a large majority. Some of the Union men 
desired me and beged me to agree to withdraw the last reso- 
lution, but I would not consent to the slightest modification, 
and told them if they were to split, they must take the 
Responsibility, and the consequence is that they will now vote 
it. Some extreme men make the House a very combustable 
body. You have no idea how exciteable they are, and how 
little knowledge they have of general politics. . . .

From, Duff Green. 1 c. c. 

Private. Mexico 12 th . Nov r 1844 

MY DEAR SIR I have been detained here much longer than 
I anticipated and refer you to Governor Shannon's dispatches 
for the causes. Benjamin's 2 letters to you will have prepared 
you in some measure, for events here. They are now hasten- 
ing to a crisis. There is great dissatisfaction with Santa Anna, 
persons speak against him openly and without restraint, but 
the press is afraid to speak and hence, as the country is large 
and rumor always magnifies or misrepresents events it is diffi- 
cult for any one to ascertain the truth, and such is the want 
of Confidence and Tendency to change that if we could ascer- 
tain the truth to-day, no one could tell what may come up 
tomorrow. 

This much I believe to be true, that a large majority of 
Congress are opposed to Santa Anna, that the opposition is 
organized, that it extends through all the northern provinces, 
that five or more of the principal northern Commanders are 
pledged to take part, that Parades 3 and the Governor of Jalisco 
have already pronounced against Santa Anna demanding that 
he shall be deposed, that another President shall be installed, 
and that Santa Anna and his ministers shall be held to account 
for the monies they have received, that in the south the Indians 
have cut off the right hands of the tax collectors, and many 
persons refuse to pay the tax for the war ag* Texas. 

Canaliso has issued a proclamation saying that the tax was 
levied to enable the Gov* to reconquer Texas and calling on 
the people to pay it, the Government have requested Santa 
Anna to march against Parades and suppress the revolt in 
Jalisco, and he is now on the way with his Jalappa troops 
amounting to 7.500 infantry and 1500 horse with 20 Cannon. 
In the mean time there is not a Dollar in the treasury, and 
the resources of the country being dried up there is no means 
of obtaining but by forced loans and siezing the church reve- 
nues. There are two ways of doing this, one is the confis-

were printed in Green's Facts and Suggestions, pp. 153, 85.

cation and sale of the property, the other is by forced loans. 
Santa Anna, it is said, argues that if the property is confis- 
cated and sold, it will command but little, that the better way 
is to permit the church to hold the property and tax it, this 
he calls "milking" the church. 

As far as I can learn there is no confidence in those who are 
opposed to Santa Anna. I have asked many, Who is to lead 
the opposition ? No one can answer. I have asked, what is 
the purpose of the opposition ? No one can say, further than 
that it is opposition 'to Santa Anna. When I ask, will you 
better your condition ? The answer is ' ' I dont know. " When 
I ask, will those whom you are to put in office be more capa- 
ble, or more honest,? the answer is more Capable? No. 
More honest? No. When I ask, what are you to gain by 
the overthrow of Santa Anna. ? the answer is I dont know. 

Therefore when you remember that Santa Anna is a man 
of decided talent, that he knows his own people well, that he 
has command of the Government and is at the head of the 
army, that altho Congress refuse to give him money and the 
resources of the treasury are dried up, You must remember 
that he has a body of dependant partisans, that his opponents 
altho organised as to the wish to oust him from office and to 
put themselves in his place, they are not organised on any 
plan which will give them greater resources of men or money 
than he has, or to [the] Country a better Government than he 
gives them, and taking into account the character of the peo- 
ple, it is obvious that the movement may enable him to over- 
throw the Congress and establish himself as Dictator, but I 
see no prospect of his overthrow. 

I take it for granted that you will therefore have- to deal 
with Santa Anna, and You may assume that such is the state 
of public Opinion that any party coming into power on his 
down fall will be compelled to take as strong or stronger 
ground against the United States than he has done. What 
he has done and is prepared to do if he had the power you 
will see in the public dispatches of our minister. 

Indeed I am convinced that Santa Anna's object is to isolate 
Mexico from the rest of the world. His policy is to flatter 
the vanity and national pride of Mexico, and to make his 
people believe that he is indispensable to their protection 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 993 

against the encroachments of foreign powers and especially 
against the United States; that he does not wish for war with 
the United States, may be; but he wishes that our relations 
shall alwa} 7 s be such as to furnish him with a pretence for 
keeping up an army which he finds indispensable to keep 
himself in power. 

You therefore cannot adjust the question of Texas by the 
Consent of Mexico. He would not hav r e that question adjusted 
if he could. If Texas were annexed it might not lead to 
war I doubt much if it would, because Santa Anna Knows 
that he cannot sustain himself in a war with us, and therefore 
he would much prefer angry negotiations which would serve 
his purpose as a pretext for keeping up his army, and levying 
contributions, and for driving all Americans out of Mexico. 
He fears contact with intelligence, as the bigoted Catholic 
fears the bible and from the same instinct. 

You cannot have peace with Mexico without a war. They 
have so long bullied, insulted and plundered us with impunity 
that they have lost all respect for us as a nation, altho they 
fear us as a people. 

Their policy towards France and England has been of much 
the same character, and altho England has done much to aid 
in driving Americans out of the country that the trade may 
be left in the hands of Englishmen, Such has been the war on 
all foreigners that the Englishmen themselves would be glad 
to see them whipped into a proper sense of what is due to 
other nations. 

But upon all these matters I refer you to my Son, who has 
many facts in confirmation of what 1 now say, and to Gov r . 
Shannon's correspondence. It seems to me that the Govern- 
ment of the United States have no alternative, that they can- 
not be content with the annexation of Texas. They must 
demand a withdrawal of the insolent charges and imputations 
contained in M r . Rejon's notes, 1 and an immediate adjustment 
of all our Claims against Mexico. This will not be done and 
;i war must be the consequence. 

Gov 1 '. Shannon was at first resolved to demand his passports, 
indeed he had written his letter demanding them, and he was 

i See Nilcs, LXVII, 260-266.

994 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

only prevented from sending it by a belief that the course 
which he adopted would relieve the Government from the 
charge of wishing to place the United States in a position 
which would necessarily lead to war. 

By suspending his official relations until he can receive 
instructions from you, he enables the President to throw upon 
Congress its just responsibility, and I cannot permit myself 
to believe that Congress will hesitate to sustain what Gov. 
Shannon has done. Indeed the time has come when we have 
no alternative but to punish Mexico and other nations into a 
proper respect for national character. 

I have been told by two of the best informed men in Mexico 
that party spirit ran so high and that we are so much divided 
among ourselves that we cannot go to war, and you will see 
in Rejon's letters that he relies on the opposition to President 
Tyler to take part with Mexico in any question growing out 
of the measures of President Tyler's administration. Such 
is the impression which the British Legation here have endeav- 
ored to make, and I have it from a source that I cannot doubt 
that the British minister has advised and approves the course 
which Mexico has taken in this matter. The policy of Eng- 
land is to bring Mexico and the United [States] into collision, 
because they think that the effect will be to leave the trade of 
Mexico in English hands. The foreign trade of Mexico is 
now almost entirely cut off. It is of little value and that little 
is chiefly monopolised by British Subjects. As it is, the trade 
is lost to us. The treaty is a dead letter and serves as a snare 
to entrap our citizens. We have no means of regaining the 
trade of Mexico but by chastising them into decent behavior 
and the advantage of a war with Mexico will be that we can 
indemnify ourselves while by chastising Mexico, we will show 
other nations what we can and will do and command their 
respect also. If you could go abroad as I have done you 
would feel that we have lost caste and that nothing but a war 
can regain the position we have lost. A war with Mexico 
will cost us nothing, and reinstate us in the estimation of other 
nations. I need not dilate on this subject to you. You know 
that I am for peace and that I would be one of the last to 
advise a war, because I know the influence which it will have 
on the question of duties, but we have gone so far that .1 see

hesitate to give you my opinion. 1 do not express this opin-

MY DEAR SIR: The dispatch which I forward to you by M r . 
Green will inform you of the State of things here. M r . 
Green will give you a full history of all that has transpired 
and of the present State and condition of the Country. The 
insolence of this Government is beyond indurence and if it is 
submited to in one case it will only give incouragement to 
its repitition. I think we should take high ground with 
Mexico and let her distinctly understand that She must re- 
tract her insults and do us justice in all matters of complaint 
which we have against her. I am fully convinced we can do 
nothing with Mexico as to the settlement of any of the difficul- 
ties we have with her until we either whip her, or make her be- 
lieve we will do so. So long as She thinks we will confine our 
complaints to deplomatic notes She will treat them with an 
indifference amounting to insult. I think we ought to pre- 
sent to Mexico an ultimatum. My last note to M r . Rejon 2 
may appear rather severe but I think it was called for and 
that a more mild note would [have] produced no effect, on this 
people. 1 will wait with some solicitude your further

Since writing the enclosed I learn that there is some possibil- 
ity that the Secretary of state may have gone to Galveston by 
the coast route. But there is no doubt of President Houstons 
being now on his way to Washington and that he will reach 
there about the time I will. 

Gen 1 Duff Green was looked for at Galveston when I left. 
The prisoners who have been liberated from the castle of 
Perote report that they saw no preparation for the threatened 
invasion: and they are of opinion that none is seriously con- 
templated by Gen 1 Santa Anna. 

The further I advance into this country the stronger is the 
evidence of the anxiety of the people for incorporation into 
our union. Much is said about the activity of the British and 
French parties to defeat our policy. But I shall not trouble 
you with the probabilities in relation to such overtures until 
I present my i*edentials, and have an interview with the 
President who will doubtless disclose to me all that has passed 
between this and other Governments. 

My attention is directed to the topographical and geograph- 
ical features of the country, and the effect they will have 
upon the population. My object will be to be prepared to 
anticipate the action of the people in the alternative of Co 1 
Polk's defeat, and to judge as correctly as I can of the policy 
which is best for us in that event. Whether it is worth the 
effort to make another trial for annexation in case of M r Clay's 
election will be a grave question. So strong is the attach- 
ment of the great body of the Texans to our Union, that I am 
not sure they might not be induced to stand the hazard of 
another war with Mexico, rather than take independence with 
a condition imposed by Great Britain against annexation at 
any future day. 

President Houston has been on the frontier this fall and 
has concluded Treaties I learn with several of the Indian

supra.

tribes. No one has spoken of difficulties growing out of the 
acts of the Indians within our limits: and I therefore take it 
for granted that the occasion for the requisition authorized 
conditionally by my instructions will not arise, or rather, has 
not arisen. 

You shall hear from me fully and constantly as soon as I 
have an interview with the President. 
y rs truly and respectfully 

A. J DONELSON. 



From John S. Barbour. c. c. 

Caltapa Nov 21 st 1844 

MY DEAR SIR. The election is over and whether for weal 
or woe is yet not entirely certain. 

Should Colo: Polk close up his ears to all evil counsellors, 
reduce the expenditures, bring down the Tariff to those 
expenditures, keep the patronage for principles, and not for 
partizans; hold the appointing power as a Trustee for wise 
and virtuous ends; divorce the Treasury and the Banks, 
divorce the patronage from party, and throw reform chiefly 
on retrenchment, Then his election will be a blessing. If 
however this great effort of patriotic ardour shall end only in 
like results with that of 1829, the publick heart will grow sick 
under disappointment, and will languish into stagnant and 
putrid quiescence, which will render it wholly incapable of 
any future effort of disinterested patriotism. It will have 
spasm and convulsion; but its healthy action is gone forever. 
That you will be in the Administration is the expectation of 
every Manly Spirit of every party. The Whigs as well as 
the Republicans, throw their expiring and their kindling 
hopes on you. I dread the influence of Gen 1 Jackson in this 
particular. Were it a private matter exclusively with you 
and he, the old man w d follow the belter impulses of his wiser 
thoughts. 

But he is impressed with the belief, that persevering injus- 
tice to you is necessary to preserve his place in the page of 
history. Without recollecting that the Historic Muse knows

neither love nor fear, he cannot be disencumbered of the 
thought, that he is to be as puissant when in his grave, as 
when wielding his vast power through his vast popularity. 

M r Polk should know, first that his election is the effect of 
Moral Causes. That personally he has not a feather's weight 
of power in the deliberations of the publick. That to his 
principles mainly is he indebted for his election and to that 
Moral power which S. Carolina and Virginia alone carried to 
his aid. 

Of South Carolina I need not say a word. Without your 
friends in Virginia, the election w d . have gone for Clay almost 
without a struggle. The party was a Caput Mortuum, until 
the Spirit of life was breathed into it by the Calhoun party. 
They fought the battle from the blue ridge to the Capes of 
Virginia; and from the Kentucky and Ohio borders through 
and over the Alleghanies. If the President elect offer you a 
seat in his Cabinet, I am justified in saying that your friends 
wish you to accept it, clearly understanding in advance the 
principles on which the Government is henceforth to be con- 
ducted. Without this preliminary understanding, they think 
you would prefer private life, and with it, they believe that 
your sense of public duty will prevail over private inclina- 
tions. As these are the Views of your sincere and disinter- 
ested friends in every quarter of Virginia that I have heard 
from, I feel myself at leave to write them to you. The fact 
that you have taken lodgings at one of the public Taverns 
(for so the papers announce) leaves a painful suspense just 
now on the minds of many as to the part you will act in the 
new administration. 

With profound Respect and true Regard Yours Sincerely, 

J. S, BARBOUR 

N. B. The only unknown vote of any State, is that of Ten- 
nesee. A patriot might find cogent reasons for the wish that 
it had fallen into the urn of the enemy as we are safe without it.

Paris 29' Nov. 1844 

DEAR SIR You must not think me too much of a scribbler 
if I offer you something like gossip, in addition to mere offi- 
cial communication. As the election of M 1 ' Polk is deemed 
certain, it is presumed that you will continue in the Depart- 
ment of State. You may not, therefore, be loth to receive 
such matter as my various journal-reading and social inter- 
course enable me to furnish. 

The day before yesterday, I was one of a large party at 
dinner, at the* hotel of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I 
went early supposing that M r Guizot would wish to converse 
with me about the result of your elections. This proved to 
be the case. He took me aside and asked several questions 
relating to the characters of men, the probable Composition 
of the Cabinet, and the construction of which the new 
American events were susceptible. I gave him such explana- 
tions and opinions as would naturally be entertained and 
expressed by one -who has confidence in the patriotism and 
capacity of the elect of the American people, and who would 
imbue, if he could, all the foreign world with the same 
sentiment. It occurred to M r . Guizot that your external 
policy would consist chiefly in resistance to foreign Aboli- 
tion schemes, and to British aggrandizement in the Western 
hemisphere so far as this is resistible without war. He 
expected changes in the Tariff more extensive and radical 
than seem to me practicable or advisable. On the subject of 
Texas he expressed roundly his wish and aim that the Repub- 
lic should remain independent. On this head, the entente 
cordiale between M r . Guizot and Lord Aberdeen is, I believe, 
perfect, and I fear that a like understanding exists between 
them with regard to American Negro-slavery. The govern- 
ments, or at least the present cabinets of Great Britain and 
France, require a complete fraternity, for their very exist- 
ence. They know each other's dangers, and the necessity of 
mutual aid: they will not separate, or practically disagree, 

1 Robert Walsh (1784-1859) was an editor of several magazines, and writer of several 
books, of which the most noted was his Appeal from the Judgment of Great Britain respect- 
ing the United States, published in 1819. From 1845 to 1851, he was U. S. Consul in Paris.

about views and measures that affect only foreign countries. 
The dinner was given in honor of Marshal Bugeaud whose 
commanding person, energetic eye, and general carriage cor- 
respond to the scene and nature of his exploits. Mind, body 
and bearing give assurance of his fitness for future various 
public service abroad and at home. He relished my remark 
to him, that I regarded as one of his best achievements, the 
masterly repulse which he gave to the French Abolition 
Society who called on him to abolish the slave trade and 
slavery in the new French African empire. The company at 
the dinner-table consisted of eminent Conservatives, with all 
of whom, as well as with the Minister, he manifested strong 
political sympathies. M r . de Bourqueney, the French Am- 
bassador for Constantinople, with leave of absence, was among 
the guests. This government ranks him with the ablest of 
the diplomatic corps. He chatted with me, apart, for a half 
hour; mentioned the entire accord between him and the Brit- 
ish envoy near the Porte, on all points, and his belief in the 
vitality of the Ottoman power; and signified some regret at 
the comparative backwardness and inaction of the United 
States, at Constantinople, considering the magnitude of Amer- 
ican Commercial interests in the East, and American preten- 
sions with regard to Christianity and the propagation of the 
Gospel. I observed that you could not associate or meddle 
with the politics and proceedings of the Five Powers whose 
concerns and plans are exclusively their own, while, however, 
you might certainly cooperate with them when objects com- 
mon to the great Christian and mercantile nations were to be 
defended or promoted. . . . 

I am, Dear Sir with perfect respect Your faithful Serv*

From Duff Green. c. c. 

Galveston, 29 th Nov. 1844 

MY DEAR SIR. I wrote to You from Mexico. There are a 
few additional facts worthy of your consideration. The con- 
test in Mexico is a struggle on the part of Santa Anna to place 
himself at the head of an absolute despotism. He has labored 
to create a state of things in which the f riend[s] of order would 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1001 

give him absolute power as the only means of escaping the 
consequences of Anarchy. The opposition consist of all the 
elements of disaffection and as far as I can learn are without 
concert or plan. Some want power as the means of enriching 
themselves. Others have a vague notion that if Santa Anna 
is overthrown, things may be better but cannot be worse. 
Some are for a confederation, but all agree that the United 
States are dangerous neighbors and that which ever party 
comes into power must reconquer Texas. 

The British Minister is openly supporting Santa Anna. 
Parades [Paredes] has offered to reduce the duties one half, 
and will no doubt Command the Ports on the Gulf of Cali- 
fornia. M r Bankhead l told me that he had notified the Consul 
Gen 1 , that the British Govt would not recognise any payments 
made to Parades, and offered no protection in case Santa Anna 
enforces a repayment. 

I understood from a M r West, formerly British Consul at 
Vera Cruz and now a large manufacturer at Jalappa that M r . 
Packenham 2 was authorised by his Gov*. to guarantee a loan of 
twelve millions at 5 per cent, on a pledge of one half the addi- 
tional revenue in case three millions was applied to indemnify 
the Mexican Manufactures and the protective tariff was 
repealed. He showed me a copy of a letter addressed to Santa 
Anna by certain influential manufacturers [which] renews the 
proposition and I saw a letter from M r . Bankhead to him, say- 
ing that he had no instructions, but pledging himself to coop- 
erate all in his power to accomplish it. And the British Frig- 
ate Spartan left on the same day that I left Vera Cruz with 
despatches which I have no doubt had reference to this, and 
the present Crisis in Mexico. 

Santa Anna can do nothing until he overthrows Congress 
and gets absolute power, because such is the state of parties 
that Congress will agree to no proposition coming from him 
and he will agree to nothing which Congress proposes. In 
this category it is the interest of those who wish a reduction 
of the tariff (and this proposition comes from the manufac- 
turers and is sustained by the commercial interest,) to favor 

1 Charles Bankhead, British minister in Mexico. 

2 Richard Pakenham, British minister in Mexico from 1835 to 1843, afterward, 1843 to 
1847, in the United States. 



1002 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Santa Anna's projects, as when he has overthrown Congress 
and clothed himself with power he will be the Gov*. , and the 
parties have an interest in securing the guarantee of the British 
Gov*. because they rely on that guarantee to secure the fulfil- 
ment of the arrangement in case of a counter revolution. I 
was told by a M r Young, an Englishman, a partner and the 
business man of the House of Hargous and Co. of Vera Cruz 
that Santa Anna had been consulted in the arrangement and 
that he had pledged himself to carry it into effect in case he 
came into absolute power. This confirms what M r West told 
me at Jalappa. 

I believe that this is Santa Anna's only hope of maintaining 
himself in power. That he will prevail in the present struggle 
with Parades I entertain scarce a doubt. (Nothing but acci- 
dent, I think can prevent it) M r Bankhead told me that the 
trade with England was reduced to 600,000 per An. The 
whole customs duties I learn, from an authentic source are 
less than $4,000,000, the current expences including the army 
and usury exceed 130,000,000. The experiment of the con- 
tribution of 4,000,000$ for the Texas war will admonish Santa 
Anna that he cannot rely on direct taxes to pay the army and 
he knows that he cannot retain power without the means of 
paying his troops. This measure will enlist England more in 
his support and as his war upon foreigners has been the pre- 
tence upon which he has made his way to power, he will 
modify his measures thus far as a means of getting money and 
conciliating England. 

He relies on Vera Cruz: as his Point d' appui. He always 
falls back there, and makes his movements from thence. He 
has erected two powerful batteries in aid of the Castle, and 
manned them with Paixhan Guns, carrying 96 lb balls, and has 
furnished them with a large supply of ball &c. 

I can give you but little news about Texas. I refer you to 
my son for many additional details in relation to Mexico. 
Yours truly 

DUFF GREEN.

Private. 

MY DEAR SIR 1 enclose you a memo., which contains what 
seems to me important facts. It is not for me to advise, but 
I do not believe that you can accomplish any thing with Mexico 
unless you seeze upon Vera Cruz, and my opinion is that the 
best way of taking the fort is to take the town, and that this 
may be done with a very small force if it is done promptly. 
Santa Anna is an able man, and he has resolved to fall back 
on Vera Cruz, and this fort, but he is compelled to call off his 
whole force to meet Parades and cannot supply new troops 
for some two or three months. If we take the town and forfr 
they should not be given up, as they are the keys to the com- 
merce of Mexico. 



From FitzwilUam Byrdmll. c. c. 

New York Dec r 2 d 1844 

DEAR SIR, I am highly gratified at the result of the presi- 
dential election, and my gratification would be without alloy 
if we had gained Tennessee or Maryland, for then James K. 
Polk would be president without the Vote, or over and above 
the Vote of New York. I do not like any president to be 
indebted to any one State for his election, and besides the 
game that has been played in this State ought not to give her 
politicians that influence with the coming administration 
which the fact of her Vote being absolutely necessary to our 
success would seem to deserve; for our success was not their 
work. 

It was proclaimed at an early day by the partizans of M r . 
Van Buren that u justice to the Cause and to the man" 
demanded his nomination, u that a Victory with any other 
chief would be no Victory at all." This was significant to 
the knowing ones, but not so, thank God, to the Democratic 
people. A secret circular was got up professedly in opposi- 
tion to the annexation of Texas, but what was this but a mode 
of collecting and combining the adherents of M r Van Buren 



1004 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

and his letter on the Texas question ? The result of this move 
is the fact that M r . Wright's majority in the State is about 
double the majority of M r . Polk. Upon this point the great: 
personal popularity of M r . Wright is set forth as the cause of 
the difference, together with the State policy as to the public 
debt. But how comes it that the canal commissioners have 
also nearly doubled the majority of M r . Polk? What has M r . 
Wright or the canal commissioners to do with the state policy 
more than M r . Polk? Not a whit the honor belongs to 
Michael Hoffman and the legislature of a former year. 

Whatever claims the democratic people of the state of New 
York have on the regard and consideration of M r . Polk her 
politicians of the Regency regime have none. The enthusiasm 
of the Young Democracy carried the Democratic people along. 
The exertions of M r . Collector Van Ness effected that Union 
here which carried the city and saved the State. The great 
Union meeting was got up by him; all the Calhoun men- 
Tyler men Cass men Johnson men Stewart men cordially 
united on James K. Polk and not a man of them but rallied to 
his support. Not so all the friends of M r . Van Buren. The 
Democrats who voted for Wright and the canal commis- 
sioners, but not for M r . Polk, who were they ? 

And yet there is now scarcely a prominent office that 
friends of M r . Van Buren are not candidates for. It is 
becoming evident every day that they are going for a restora- 
tion of the old set as far as they can get at it. They want the 
removal of Van Ness or his transfer to the bench in order to 
get the controll of the custom house as a lever for 1848. 
There are secret organizations at work for this and the other 
great offices under the general Government in this city. The 
only, and in point of fact, just policy for the appointing 
power to pursue, is to bestow its best considerations on the 
young democracy, in other words the States Rights Democracy. 
By the bye it is rumoured here that Ogden Hoffman will be 
soon an ex. U. S. Attorney. If you have any influence with 
the President, let James T. Brady be his successor. He is 
respectable every way talented capable honest and is more 
than any other Lawyer in this City, the favorite of the Young 
Democracy. I could say much as to what he deserves from 
you but I refrain because I believe you are governed by 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1005 

higher considerations than those of a personal nature. A 
better appointment could not be made for the office in this 
city. 

I confess that I am politically interested and that too in the 
highest degree as to the collectorship Survey orship Naval 
office, U. S. District attorney, Marshall and some others of 
lesser note in this city because I know their important bearing 
upon the contest of 1848. The one of 1844 is only the begin- 
ning of what 1848 must finish. 

1 can always give you correct information of our politicians 
here and you may depend upon it that I shall never suffer my 
private friendships here to induce me to attempt to mislead 
you. Very improper appointments are often made for want 
of that knowledge which should be previously obtained. In 
Jefferson's time, u is he honest is he capable?" might have 
been sufficient, but nowadays will he bring strength to the 
administration and its policy, is equally a necessary question. 

And now my dear Sir you will permit me to express my 
Views in relation to yourself. You will I hope remain in 
Washington the ensueing four years, if not as Secretary of 
State, at least as Senator from your own State. In my opin- 
ion M r . Polk should call you to the office you now hold, and 
you should accept it. Throwing even proper personal con- 
siderations as regards your future life out of the question, the 
true constitutional policy of this government requires your 
presence in Washington for such a policy is absolutely neces- 
sary to the Stability of the Government itself. We want 
Statesmen constitutional Democrats at Washington and not 
truckling politicians. 

I return you thanks for the Rhode Island Report. I should 
be much pleased to know your views with regard to the course 
the liberal democracy should pursue in this city. When, and 
under what form we should rally ourselves I am at a loss to 
determine. Will you drop me a few lines upon the future 
Course and policy of the friends of Constitutional principles? 
Yours with the highest regard

Washington [Texas] 8 th Dec b . 1844 

MY DEAR SIR I have now been here several days and have 
conversed with many of the most influential members of Con- 
gress. 1 find that upon the simple question of Annexation 
there is little or no difference of opinion. On the details there 
are many opposed to the late treaty they insist that the pay- 
ment of the debt was not properly or sufficiently provided 
for, that the boundary was not secured as it should have 
been, that their land titles were not sufficiently protected and 
that proper provision for Education was not made, they say 
that having conquered the country they surrender every 
thing and gain nothing but an equivocal protection. These 
points they believe can be provided for and they believe that 
on the part of Texas there will be no unreasonable demand. 
Gen 1 Houston has had other views. If he were left to him- 
self he would put on foot an offensive war. All his arguments 
go to show that his mind is occupied with the Conquest of 
Mexico and the establishment of a new Republic. He goes 
freely into the comparison of the two propositions, Annexa- 
tion and Conquest. All his remarks are appeals to the pas- 
sions and interests which he desires to enlist in the Conquest 
of Mexico, and when replied to, or when he finds that he has 
made the desired impression he says that nothing shall tempt 
him from his retirement. He is enthusiastic, poetical in the 
description of his domestic happiness and says that notwith- 
standing all that has been said he is for Annexation. It is 
easy to read all this and I can see where it will end if the 
Congress of the United States delay the question beyond the 
next session. To press the question now and to fail would do 
injury. If the press and our public men discuss the question 
properly and the Government keeps the question open, no 
injury will, in my opinion result from the delay until the next 
session of Congress, because they are prepared here to await 
the action of public opinion upon the new Congress. 

In the mean time as the only serious impediment to annexa- 
tion is to be found in the ulterior Aspirations of Gen 1 Hous- 
ton, I deem it fortunate that Major Donaldson came when he 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1007 

did. Armed as he was by letters from Gen 1 Jackson, know- 
ing Houston and his early history, he has used arguments 
and urged considerations which no one else could have done 
with the same effect and neutralised if he has not eradicated 
the purpose of Mexican Conquest. Gen 1 Houston will leave 
here in a few days, 1 and has declared himself in favor of 
annexation, saying that Texas can do nothing, but await the 
action of the United States. 

I therefore consider the question as safe so far as Texas is 
concerned. She will do nothing for the next year at least 
that will prevent Annexation. 

In the mean time I am by no means sure that it will be for 
the interest of the United States or of Texas that the question 
should be closed now. The effort of the opposition will be to 
organise the north against the south. Abolition the tariff, 
and native Republicanism, against South Carolina. If the 
new administration keeps the Texas question as one of the 
measures for the new organisation of parties, it will give the 
administration strength, and the success of the measure will 
be an administration triumph which will go far to establish 
its power. Of this you can judge better than I. I make the 
suggestion, subject to your better judgment. 

The people of Texas will never consent to annexation on 
M r Benton's terms, and his reelection will go far to defeat the 
measure, unless they can be induced to believe that the next 
Congress will favor annexation on the terms I have indicated. 

I repeat that I do not wish my name sent before the Senate, 
until I reach home, which will be in all the month of January. 
Yours truly 

DUFF GREEN 

P. S. Gen 1 Houston has taken occasion to treat me with 
great attention, has invited me to his house and expressed a 
great personal respect and a wish to be on friendly terms.

From JBeverley Tucker. 1 c. c. 

Williamsburg Dec. 12, 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR I beg you to accept my acknowledgements for 
your polite notice of my letter. % It was a courtesy I had no 
right to expect, and which I therefore appreciate the more 
highly. 

I am surprised to learn that there is any doubt of the 
authenticity of the information given to me by Mr White. 2 
In regard to that I cannot be mistaken. The language of the 
Treaty of Cession by France to the U. S. strongly intimates 
the existence of some document denning the limits of the 
Louisiana as ceded by France to Spain, and by Spain back 
again to France. This, and other circumstances put M r . W. 
on the enquiry. His large interest in Spanish Florida grants 
determined him to prosecute it, at the expense of spending a 
great part of his time in Europe. . This was his chief business 
then, he learned that somewhere about 1760 a treaty of a 
secret character had been concluded between France and 
Spain, then governed bythe two branches of the house of 
Bourbon, and that into that treaty an article defining the 
bounds of Louisiana was introduced. He applied to the 
Minister of foreign affairs for a copy which was refused. He 

1 Judge Beverley Tucker (1784-1857), author of the Partisan Leader, was professor of 
law in the College of William and Mary till his death, and an influential writer of polit- 
ical and other essays. 

2 The reference is to a passage in a preceding letter of Judge Tucker dated November 
13, 1844. In that letter, "after speaking of the arguments which he and other inhabitants 
of Mi-souri in 1819 and 1820 used with respect to the extent of the Louisiana Purchase, 
and of the favor with which he found his opinions regarded by the friends of Mr. Clay, 
he said " But it may not be enough that^r. Clay and others of his school had said that 
Texas is part of Louisiana. Is there any other proof? There is, ample and precise proof 
in the French bureau of foreign affairs. About 1762, just before the cession of Louisiana 
by France to Spain the Rio del Norte was established as the boundary by treaty. The 
subsequent cession made that treaty of no consequence, and it was forgotten. But mean, 
time a copy had been furnished to the vice-regal government of Mexico where Branch 
Archer told me, in 1833, it had been seen by many persons of his acquaintance during the 
connexion between Texas and Mexico. But Jos. M. White, about the same time, assured 
me that a copy of the article had been furnished him by the French Minister of foreign 
affairs. 

"Now when France ceded to the U.S. 'by the same boundaries by which Spain had 
ceded to her' (These are the words) Spain having ceded to France 'by the same bound- 
aries by which France had at first ceded to Spain,' France came under an obligation to 
furnish any evidence in her power to show what those boundaries were. She has it. It 
ought to have been demanded then. The very words show the existence of some known 
boundary, and France if properly called upon, is bound to produce and will produce the 
treaty of boundary." 



LETTEKS TO JOITtf C. CALHOUN. 1009 

then went to Talleyrand, then in London, to invoke his in- 
fluence with the Minister, and procured from him a letter 
expressing the opinion that the article in question, tho' in a 
treaty otherwise secret, might be divulged without impro- 
priety. Thereupon a copy was furnished, from which it ap- 
peared that the Rio Bravo and the Mississippi, including the 
Island of New Orleans, were the agreed boundaries. Such 
was his account to me 

A week afterwards I repeated this conversation to Branch 
Archer, who said he had often heard that there was such an 
article among the archives of Mexico, whither it had been 
immediately sent, for the information of the vice-regal gov- 
ernment. The cession taking place immediately after the 
document was no longer of any consequence, and was not 
made notorious by any action upon it. 

M r . W. died at S* Louis on a visit to a brother whose hab- 
its were not such as to cause any suspicion that his papers 
should have fallen into confusion. Millions of ours depended 
on that paper, and they whose interests were to be effected by 
it, may have been quite ready to secure its suppression, and 
M r . W's silence b} 7 a liberal compromise of his claims. The 
Government of the U. S. was interested to suppress it. 
Texas was gone from us, and was independent. Much land 
east of the Mississippi had been sold by the U. S. covered 
by Spanish grants made between 1803 and 1819. These are 
the lands White was claiming. Can we wonder if means 
were taken to silence him? 

In this view of the matter the U. S. did not give up Texas 
gratuitously, for we got all the country east of the Mississippi 
that we call Louisiana. We therefore might be satisfied with 
the bargain. But it is of no consequence to the claim of 
Texas to be admitted into the union, in fulfilment of our 
engagement in that respect, whether we got anything for the 
country or no. We had no authority to barter away the 
rights of the Texans, as they themselves immediately pro- 
tested in an article, an extract from which I find in the 12. 
No. of the Southern Review p. 486. which I have just re- 
ceived. That article expresses what was the universal senti- 
ment of the far West at the time, and on that sentiment most 
of those who migrated to Texas acted in taking that important

step. I remember being present at a meeting of the most 
intelligent gentlemen of St. Louis one night in the Theatre, 
where the matter was discussed, and the Treaty condemned by 
an unanimous vote, on that ground. My memory deceives 
me if Col. Benton was not present. 

In the Treaty of Cession there is a stipulation that France 
shall furnish all evidences of title and boundaries in her pos- 
session. This article inserted in one of the secret treaties of 
the heads of the Catholic party in Europe may have been over- 
looked by the new men into whose hands the government had 
come. Can it do any harm to instruct M r . King to enquire if 
there be any such article and to demand it if there is? The 
disclosure might occasion some loss to the Government in the 
adjustment of Florida titles; but what are a few dollars in 
comparison with a great political measure, and the cove- 
nanted rights of the People of Texas ? 

I have just seen your letter to Mr. Shannon, and an abstract 
of his correspondence with Rejon. The aspect which this gives 
to the Texas question makes it of infinite importance to bring 
in aid of the pretensions of our government every argument 
and every fact which can fortify your position. I think, if 
you will look at the Treaty of cession, you will see in it such 
language as will hardly leave a doubt in your mind that before 
the first Cession by France to Spain the boundary of Loui- 
siana had been definitively settled and was distinctly under- 
stood between those two powers.

Galveston 19 th Dec r . 

MY DEAR SIR, I have the very great gratification to ac- 
knowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23 rd ultimo. All 
your opinions and suggestions are more highly appreciated 
and esteemed by me than those from any other statesman in 
the U. S. So far as my interchanges on the great question of 
annexation occur in relation to our policy on the subject here, 
your views will be particularly recommended. 

If we are annexed by a joint resolution or an act of your 
Congress ought there not to be a provision for submitting 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1011 

such joint resolution or act to a vote of the people of Texas? 
Has our congress the right (it certainly has not authority 
under the constitution) to part with the sovereignty of the 
Texian Nation? There is no doubt of a ratification of a joint 
resolution or act of your congress, annexing us, by the people 
of Texas. The majority would be 4, 5, 6, or 7 to one unless 
something unlocked for, tending to alienate the people trans- 
pires, and it would forever silence those who are opposed to 
annexation, and who, in some instances, for the want of proper 
information on the subject, now declare it as their belief that 
a majority of the citizens of Texas are opposed to the meas- 
ure. . . . 

I have the honor to be your devoted friend 

MEMUCAN HUNT 



From A. J. Donelson. c. c. 

Private New Orleans, Dec r . 26. 1S4A 

MY D R SIR, I have learned since my arrival here, that a 
package with your frank upon it, has passed me in a new 
Steamer, the McKim, that is making an experimental trip to 
Galvezton, I of course knew nothing when I left Galvezton. 
I had taken care to wait for the regular steamer, and of course 
felt no apprehension of there being a despatch behind me, 
when I left. 

Now, however, I do not feel at liberty to wait here for a 
despatch, but shall proceed on in the packet of the 28 : to Gal- 
vezton, where I shall overtake the communication alluded to, 
and go on immediately to the seat of Government. 

If you have any thing of much importance, growing out of 
the question of Annexation, it had better be sent to the col- 
lector with a request to him to send a special messenger with 
it to me, particularly if an answer is desirable before the 
adjournment of Congress. Taking the fate of a letter in the 
mail from here to the seat of Government of Texas, a despatch 
from you might be two or three weeks on the way. 

I discover from the papers that M r . Benton intends to urge 
bis plan of annexation. Anxious if possible to bring him to 
a point on which he may exert less force against the measure 



1012 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I have written to him a private letter telling him that his 
course is injuring his friends and his country, and that I hoped 
he would be willing to modify his position, so far as to leave 
out of view for the present, the question of slavery, and the 
number of states, and take the boundary as described in my 
private letter to you, by M r . Martin. If taken as a. Territory 
with a general clause like that in the Treaty of 1803, incorpo- 
rating Louisiana, and securing to the citizens equal immuni- 
ties and rights with other citizens of the Union; and with the 
provisions suggested as coming from President Houston; I 
would insist on nothing more. 

Let us get annexation on any terms we can, taking care not 
to have any thing in form or substance that would render 
doubtful its ratification by Texas. The battle about slavery, 
boundary east of the Nuesos [Nueces], and the number of 
states, will come up on the Constitution to be hereafter formed 
by the people of Texas, when there will be no danger of loss 
of the Territory from British intrigue, or other causes. 

If you are not able to carry annexation by the vote of the 
present Congress I shall despair of the cause, not seeing a cer- 
tainty of much increase of strength in the next Congress 
unless it can be secured by a judicious arrangement of the 
Cabinet. This should be a paramount object with M r . Polk 
who must of course feel himself instructed to omit nothing 
that can advance the cause of immediate annexation. 

Referring to the recent elections in the United States I 
have said to Texas that the measure was destined to a speedy 
consumation, and she has said in reply that she would throw 
no impediment in the way. This gives us the benefit of a 
trial in Polks administration, and is so understood by Texas, 
but I have endeavored to give the phraseology such a turn as 
to convey the idea also that 1 relied on the present Congress. 
It seemed to me that I ought to risk something to secure the 
measure to M r . Tylers administration. 

I have heard nothing from M r . Polk and have had but one 
letter from Gen 1 Jackson, who insists upon some action by 
the Congress of Texas at its present session. Before its close 
I hope to hear from you. On existing circumstances I should 
fear to ask Texas for a formal renewal of her wish to come 
into the Union, unless our Government were prepared to 



LETTEES TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1013 

take some more energetic measure to give effect to that wish 
than any yet attempted. The extension of the laws over the 
Territory without the advice of Congress, or trusting to 
events to secure their sanction afterwards would be hazardous. 

As I feel obliged to return without attending to my pri- 
vate business, in consequence of the information that a des- 
patch from you to me has gone on to Galvezton; and have 
requested my family to meet me here as soon as they can, I 
hope you will, as soon as you think the public business will 
allow of my absence from Texas a few weeks, give me per- 
mission to this effect. 

The Congress of Texas will adjourn about the 1 st of Febru- 
ary then I would judge there would be nothing urgent, 
unless you wish me to obtain some more, or new manifesta- 
tion of the feeling of the Government here on the question of 
Annexation. 

I had a great desire to see Gen 1 Jackson this winter, and 
talk over the old seminole matter and remove if possible the 
misconception which led to the interruption of the friendly 
relations once existing between yourself and him. His last 
letter was written with his usual firmness, and leads me to 
hope and trust that he may yet live a few years more. I 
therefore feel the less doubt of my being able to see him 
again, and renewing a conversation with him on this subject, 
the purport of which I have never communicated to you, 
because I thought further reflection on his part would induce 
him to place it on a footing equally satisfactory to yourself 
and him. This I wish to see and have so written to Gov 1 
Branch, whose letter to me will be answered more fully in a 
few weeks. 

I am truly and sincerely Y r obt svt

election may prove a blessing to our Country, This however, 
as you justly remark, must entirely depend on the wisdom and 
policy of his administration. Should he draw around him 
able men, and carry out in good faith the principles for which 
we have contended, all will be well, and the Democratic Party 
will be fixed in power not to be shaken. There should be no 
wavering on the subject of the annexation of Texas. The 
growling of the British Lion should only stimulate to immedi- 
ate action. To falter in our course from apprehension of her 
hostility, would disgrace us in the eyes of all Europe. The 
act accomplished, England will complain, perhaps threaten, 
and her news papers will be lavish in their abuse; but that will 
be all; for with all her power, she can but feel, that a war 
with us would be more prejudicial to her interest, than with 
any other nation. She will not risk the consequences. I am 
aware that she is exerting herself to induce France to make 
common cause with her on the subject of Texas, and that M r . 
Guizot is much inclined to do so; but it will not succeed. It 
would shock the French nation, which detests all alliances with 
England; and the King is too wise, and too prudent to place 
himself in a position which would go far towards destroying 
his dynasty. It is however very desirable that we should 
have the means to enable us to command the service of a por- 
tion of the French Press, to enlighten the public mind; and 
thus to counteract the misrepresentations which appear daily, 
in thoSe Journals, which are notoriously in the pay of Eng- 
land. I hope the suggestion I had the honor to make on this 
subject will meet with the approbation of the President. M r . 
Walsh our Consul is an able, and efficient officer, and I trust 
Col. Polk will not be induced to disturb him in his position. 
Permit me also to ask, as a personal favor to myself, as well as 
an act of Justice to a long tried, and faithful public servant, 
that our Consul at Havre my old Friend Beaseley, may not be 
displaced, to gratify any one; for I know him to be one of the 
best of meH and a capital officer. Your letter to Govr. Shan- 
non reached me nearly two weeks after those addressed to 
Messrs. Irving and Wheaton had been received, probably 
Sir James Graham 1 thought proper to give it a perusal. It is

written with your usual ability, and places the conduct of 
Mexico in the odious light in which it deserves to stand before 
the civilized world. A few days past I was presented to the 
King and Queen of Belgium, now on a visit to this Court. 
They took occasion to express themselves in the kindest terms 
of M r . and M rs . Clemson, and from all that I can learn they 
have succeeded in making a most favorable impression, as well 
on the Corps Diplomatic as on the King. The opening of the 
Chambers which took place on the 26 presented a briliant 
spectacle; and the old King read his speech admirably well. 
I enclose it to you. You will perceive nothing in it of any 
importance except that he dwells with rather too much em- 
phasis on the friendship of England to chime in with the feel- 
ings of the French People. A majority of the Papers of Paris 
have attacked it with great severity, and even in the Cham- 
bers itself it was received in dead silence. The President's 
Message is looked for with much interest, particularly in Eng- 
land; as Lord Cowley l said to me a few days past. I laugh- 
ingly replied, I was gratified to find we were of sufficient im- 
portance to excite an interest on this side of the Atlantic. 
Tender my best respects to M rs . Calhoun.

Edgewood 28 Dec r . 1844. 

MY DEAR SIR I rec d yours yesterday and was glad to hear 
you were all well, but regret that things look so gloomy to 
you. I hope yet matters may take a more favorable turn. 

As to your fear about a split in this state I think there is 
no occasion for it at all. The state never has been as united 
as at present since I have been acquainted with- public 
matters. The Mercury being in the hands of a few makes a 
greater shew of division than really exists. There were only 
21 men in the legislature all told that were bitter and opposed 
to the present position of the State, and they made a great 
shew and claimed many more but I assure you that is the

1016 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

amount of their strength. Take Beaufort and Colleton and 
you will find that combining- senators and Rep. both and there 
is a majority of 6 ags* the .course pursued by Mr. Rhett. In 
fact I am assured that in those Dists. in the recent Congres- 
sional election a majority of the votes were actually Blank. 
I merely mention this to shew you that there is in fact no 
division except such as arises in every country agst selfish- 
ness arrogance, and assumption, which must allways be the 
case. I think I can safely say that the state is fully informed 
as to her true situation and responsibilities and is determined 
to do what is right with unanimity at the proper time, if 
need be. 

As to my 2 d . set of resolutions on Abolition &c. , the reasons 
why they were not passed was that immediately after my 
speech on them these 21 men called a caucus to defeat and 
smother them, and they selected Bankatt [1] from this Dist. 
(who was allways an uncertain man) and used him to intro- 
duce counter resolutions to produce distraction the last day 
and confusion, and it was on his motion they were taken from 
the House when the yeas and nays could operate and refered 
to a committee of the whole House and made with all the 
other previous resolutions the order of the day for 10 O'clock 
at night the last night of the session. 1 told him at the time 
the object of his resolutions (which were drawn by Colcock,) 
was to produce distraction and his Motion was to smother all 
in the confusion of the last moments. He would not deny it, 
and will be held to strict account from what I hear. 

If it had not been for this the last night, and they could 
have been brought to a vote they were obliged to pass with the 
exception of the 21, and strange to say the night before I 
introduced them (on Sunday) these very gent, were the most 
violent for the most violent resolutions, and I took the Sen- 
ate Monday immediately after reading the journal, without 
consulting a single person, and they then, after I passed them 
by a unanimous vote immediately turned moderate men. 

As to a report &c. on the Gov. message, I thought of it, but 
the great difficulty was in going into details. The Legislature 
of So. Ca. would not have it. There are but a very few (and 
none from the Low country) who can understand or appre- 
ciate our relations to any general parties out of the State. 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1017 

They are no more a part of the general Democratic party 
than if they were out of the Union: And the consequence 
would have been a great division on any report that would be 
made. Besides it was necessary to act immediately as the 
Gov. message with the Mercury were to have their run and 
produce all the unfavorable impressions that could be before 
a report could be made. And it was understood that M c Duffie 
was to be there the first day of the Session to urge an imme- 
diate call of a convention. He did not go and they were dis- 
appointed and I believe now have unkind feelings towards 
him because he did not fulfill what was supposed to be his 
obligations, as he signed originally the address of M r llhett 
to his constituants and they say agreed to stand by him in the 
State. 

I shall write to Elmore immediately and put him right, but 
you must not mistake Col. Elmore. I think he is a devoted 
friend of yours and he told me that as your friend, and I told 
him then there was some mistake. These 21 gent, are now 
bitter towards him, made the unkindest insinuations about 
his prospects of receiving an office from Polk <&c. 

Elmore acted with me most cordially in everything at Co- 
lumbia and did what he could to check and control others. 

I hope sincerely every thing will yet work right. As far 
as I am concerned I am perfectly satisfied and am agst every 
thing calculated to produce the slightest division in the state. 
We must be united it is due to ourselves, to our liberties, and 
to the country; and as God is the judge of my heart there is 
not an emotion in it at present seperate from the honor the 
rights and the glory of So. Carolina. . . .

Annexation this Winter, but keeping open the Door of hope

Elliot 1 is very active, offering Independence on a pledge 
against Annexation. He can do nothing. Nine tenths of the 
people are for Annexation, and the President 2 assures me that 
he is also. He cannot if he would, defeat it, if Congress pass 
resolutions, next winter, favorable to annexation. These 
people however will not consent to annexation with less than 
the limits they claim, and will reject it if it be clogged with 
either of M r Benton's Conditions.

DEAR SIR ... To your immediate friends, in this city, 
more than to any other cause, except Annexation was owing 
the final abandonment of Van Buren and the nomination of 
Governor Polk. 

We formed a Calhoun, or Congressional District Committee, 
composed of 52 persons, among whom were found representa- 
tives from every ward in the city. We circulated documents 
in favour of the District plan of appointing Delegates to the 
Baltimore Convention, and against the resolutions of the Syra- 
cuse convention, and also against Van Buren and the expedi- 
ency of his nomination. 

These documents were sent into every section of the State; 
aroused powerful and strong opposition, which alarmed the 
Albany regency with the old Hunkers. The brief existence 
of the Gazette, also, had its influence. His chances of receiv- 
ing the nomination, became much weakened, till his Texas 
Letter completed the work so auspiciously commenced and 
prosecuted in this city. . . .

Private and Unofficial 

Galvezton, Jan y . 27, 1845 

MY D r SIR, I met at Houston your very acceptable letter of 
the 9' ins*, at which place I had arrived on the 24 th by slow 
stages from Washington, for the purpose of escaping the 
miasma of the latter place. I was attacked on the 4 th of Jan y 
with the prevailing epidemic and am among the very few 
cases of recovery from it. 

When I reached Washington on the 4 th Jan y , Gen 1 Green's 1 
Exequatur had been revoked, and the worst possible feeling 
existed between him and the President. The See 7 of State, 
M r Allen had prepared a statement of the case to be transmit- 
ted to his agent at Washington city. 1 immediately sought an 
interview with the President, and suggested to him the course 
which was adopted, of stating the circumstances to me, and 
of permitting the explanations to pass through me to you. 
My first object was to remove the impression that Gen 1 
Green was authorized to commit his Government in any man- 
ner; and then to relieve him of the charge that he had sought 
to corrupt and menace the President, for you will perceive 
the statement of M r Allen makes this charge distinctly, and 
thus created a personal issue which under the circumstances 
could not have failed to injure the character of the Gen 1 . 

I considered the Gen 1 , although out of his sphere, and not 
defensible as a Counsul, as not obnoxious to the severe impu- 
tation cast upon him. He was full of zeal in the cause of 
annexation, and mistaking the sense in which the members of 
Congress heard his project for the defence of the Western 
frontier and the invasion of Mexico, approached the President 
too familiarly, but without a doubt of his disposition, if not 
to concur in his views, at least to consider them in a spirit of 
kindness. Whereas in truth his movements were watched 
with suspicion from the beginning, and before he was aware 
of it, he was involved in the responsibility of measures, con- 
templating a serious change in the policy of the Republic, 
employing the Indians of the U. States and Texas in the inva-

sion of Mexico, and revolutionizing the country from the Rio 
Grande to the Pacific under the flag of Texas. 

You will see that in my note to M r Allen of the 6 th ins*, 
whilst I expressed my disapprobation of such projects, I 
treated the affair as not involving the United States, and 
reaching to no higher importance than what was due to.pri- 
vate character and opinion. In this point of view it has been 
settled, and after a full disclaimer on the part of Gen 1 Green 
of all intention to approach the President in the manner 
charged, the personal imputation oh his character has been 
withdrawn to an extent that ought to be satisfactory to him. 

It gives me pleasure to say to you that the best feeling con- 
tinues to prevail with the Congress of Texas on the subject of 
Annexation. Resolutions of various mass meetings on the 
subject have been referred to the committee of Foreign rela- 
tions in the Senate, and have been the subject of a report 
from M r Kaufman, the chairman, which he informed me would 
be unanimously adopted, recommending annexation as the 
true measure of safety for the Republic. The President also 
in my last interview with him, told me, that he would do his 
duty, and hold himself in readiness to call Congress together 
to take whatever steps might be deemed best to submit the 
action of our Congress to the people of Texas for their confir- 
mation and approval. Their Congress win probably adjourn 
tomorrow, having governed their legislature by the principle 
that, in view of annexation, the least that could be done, 
consistently with the administration and preservation of the 
Government, was the best. 

The President called to see me repeatedly during my con- 
finement, and after I became convalesent, stated to me, that 
he was assailed from some quarters as maintaining a posi- 
tion unfriendly to annexation, and that he was somewhat in 
doubt as to the course he ought to pursue to put himself right 
in the estimation of his own citizens. I suggested to him that 
I was satisfied with the course he had pursued in his inter- 
course with me; and that if he thought his position sufficiently 
well defined in the letter he had addressed to me on the 13 th 
ins*, that there would be no impropriety in complying with a 
call from Congress for that correspondence a course fre- 
quently adopted in other Governments for similar purposes. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1021 

He seemed gratified at the suggestion, and there was a call 
accordingly made the next day, as I understood, for those 
papers. I had not considered that there might be something 
in my letter which would make its publication improper in 
the United States: if so, I shall exceedingly regret my impru- 
dence, and must beg you to ascribe the weakness to the state 
of mind under which I was left by my sickness. 

Determined to leave, during my absence, no influence inop- 
erative in confirming the attachment of the people here to the 
measure of annexation, 1 left with a leading member of the 
House a letter of which the following is an extract, and which 
he will publish. 

It gives me pleasure to say also in answer to your allusion to the active 
interest always manifested by Gen 1 Jackson in behalf of Texas, that I had 
a letter from him a short time since in which he still expresses the same 
interest. He still looks upon the reannexation of Texas to the United 
States as a measure of vital importance to the security and happiness of 
both Republics, and one that the people ought not to allow to be defeated. 
He considers that the inhabitants of Texas are entitled to the benefits 
guaranteed to Louisiana by the Treaty with France of 1803, and that rean- 
nexation is but a restoration of former rights, and a fulfilment of obligations 
which the Treaty of 1819 with Spain ought never to have disturbed. 

But independent of, and above these considerations, he regards the will 
of Texas, made free and national by the valor and prowess of her own 
citizens, and declared in favor of annexation, as constituting an appeal to 
the United States which cannot be resisted. This position of Texas reme- 
dies the errors of the Treaty of 1819, reopens the door for the consumma- 
tion of the pledges contained in the Treaty of 1803, and restores to the 
valley of the Mississippi its unity in surface, in population, in Government, 
in defence, and in future security against foreign influence. 

AVith these views the Gen 1 is still sanguine of the success of the measure 
of reannexation, and awaits with confidence the fulfilment of the popular 
wi^h in the United States by those charged with the administration of the 
Government. 

I shall write you again from New Orleans, where I hope to 
meet my wife, and will avail myself of the leave of absence 
the President has been kind enough to grant me. 

There is one point of public interest, however, of which I 
will say a word in this letter before concluding, and that is in 
relation to the unsettled question growing out of the order of 
President Houston to the collector at the mouth of the Sabine. 
The Secretary of State has not answered my communication 
on the subject, but replied verbally that instructions had been

issued to the collector which he was sure would prevent any 
future difficulty that subject being a delicate and difficult 
one, and requiring an examination of documents to which he 
had not now access, he hoped I would not press an answer 
immediately. I told him that all that was desired by me was 
the prevention of trouble, and an assertion of the rights of 
the U States, and if his instructions to the collector had the 
effect attributed to them, that the delay he desired was not 
material.

Paris January 29 th , 1815. 

MY DEAR SIR I was much gratified by your very friendly 
letter of the 13 Dec r . and I surely hope your anticipations 
may be reallised, and this Congress may not adjourn without 
passing M r . M c Duffy's resolutions for the annexation of 
Texas. I deeply regret the course pursued by Co 1 . Benton, 
while I am at a loss to comprehend the motives which in- 
fluence it. His position it seems to me is every way extraor- 
dinary; for while he professes to be desirous to promote the 
annexation of Texas, he cannot fail with his sagacity to see, 
that even should his Bill pass, it will in all human proba- 
bility defeat the measure. All that England requires to per- 
fect her plan of opperations; and to opperate successfully on 
Texas herself, is delay on our part to act definitively on 
the question. I am fully convinced of this from the change 
of ... [torn out] produced on Ashbel Smith 1 . . . 
affairs for France and England; He was the warm and decided 
advocate of annexation; but after making a visit to England 
and having an interview with Lord Abberdeen, be avowed 
himself decidedly hostile to the measure. I entertain little 
doubt that he returned to Texas authorised to make pro- 
posals, or to use his influence to induce his Government to 
accept propositions which will be well calculated to produce 
their effect in Texas. Smith is a cautious man; yet in the

conversations I have held with him he has thrown out 
remarks which convinced me that he will in this matter be a 
willing instrument in the hands of England. On more than 
one occasion he spoke of the time and circumstances being 
propitious for Texas to obtain the acknowledgement of her 
independence by Mexico. To procure the payment of her 
debt by granting certain commercial facilities to England; 
while at the same time the arrangement could be rendered 
greatly beneficial to Texas by a stipulation for the admission 
of her Cotton into British Ports free of duty. He did not 
say that these suggestions came from Lord Abberdeen, yet 
from the whole tenor of his conversations, he left that 
impression on my mind. Smith is the bosom Friend of the 
President elect Jones, and it is said will be his Secretary of 
State. I have thought it was but proper that you should 
understand his feelings and probable course. Would to God 
our Congress could but understand the importance of prompt 
action to put an end to European intrigue, and the ultimate 
loss of that fine country, unless we resort to force to obtain 
it. The act done, we should hear no more of opposition on 
this side of the Atlantic. I shall use prudently the power 
you have given me to expend for certain object $500. It is 
probable that nothing like that sum will be required, par- 
ticularly if the contribution you mentioned should be made 
by the southern States. You do not direct on whom I shall 
draw, either do so or transmit me a Bill for the amount. 
Tender my best respects to M rs . Calhoun. 

Truly and faithfully I am your Ob 1 . Sv*.

D r SIR I reached this place last night and deposited with the 
post master my letters to the Department relating to my 
public business. They will be a day in advance of this letter. 
The British and French Ministers at Galvezton are very 
active in their exertions against annexation, but have been 
deterred bv the great fatality among the inhabitants at the

seat of Government, from visiting that place. They report 
that no measure consummating annexation can get more than 
Twenty votes in our Senate; and that this information is from 
high and responsible sources. I hope they will be disappointed, 
even [if] the measure be limited to the mere extension to Texas 
of the provision contained in the 3 d . article of the Treaty in 
regard to L a . The main point is to get the country, leaving 
for the future as they will be presented by Texas in her Con- 
stitution, the difficulties, respecting slavery, the number of 
states &c &c 

I endeavored to sound Elliott in regard to his views about 
California and the occupation of the country between the 
Nuesos [Nueces] and the Rio Grande. My object was to get 
a clue to the mortgage, said by Gen 1 Green to be held by Great 
Britain on a large portion of that country to secure the debts 
of British subjects. If there be any reality in that Mortgage, 
as understood by Gen 1 Green, Elliott knew how to keep it to 
himself. 

My belief is that Elliott is sick of his position, and feels 
that interference with the annexation question was a false move 
for his Gov*. He is saying boldly that the country is over- 
rated; but affects great concern about the extension of slavery, 
insinuating that it will dissolve our Union, and, if Texas is 
annexed, bring upon her our troubles. He is a shrewd and 
cunning man, and of course is to be understood more by his 
actions than his words. 

Not finding my wife here as I expected I shall proceed 
directly from this place to Nashville. I can go up and back 
again in about three weeks, and be ready to execute }^our 
instructions, should there be any for me on my return. In 
addition to a necessity for attention to my private business, I 
wish to see Gen 1 Jackson whose life hangs on a thread. I 
desire to converse with him particularly on the subject of his 
personal relations to you, which were brought to my notice 
by Governor Branch, and which I hope can be placed on such 
a footing as to take from them all impeachment of the char- 
acter or motives of either of you. 

I am very respectfully y r . obt svt

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1025 

from James Hamilton. c. c. 

New Orleans Feby 18 th 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR. I was greatly rejoiced on my arrival here to 
find from the Papers that your convalescence was so far 
established as to relieve your friends of all anxiety in relation 
to your speedy recovery. 

In the meantime let me beg of you not to regard anything 
that has passed between us as the value of a tobacco stopper 
in regard to the Mission to England if it becomes half as 
desirable to you that you should occupy this Post as it is 
important perhaps to the public interest that you should do 
so. But 1 am probably making generous concessions at a 
very small price as I very much question even if you do not 
take the appointment whether Polk would authorize its being 
tendered to me. It is an old saying in the Kennel, that the 
greedy Dogs are always served first and I have no doubt some 
Mouth is ready to receive this Dotation (as the King of France 
says) more rapacious than my own and I am content. I leave 
the matter in your hands to be managed as you deem most 
conformable to my character and your own sense of delicacy. 
If you do not take the appointment yourself I shall be satis- 
tied whether 1 obtain it or not, if you will only say to Polk 
what you have said to me, that you consider me the best 
qualified for the duties of this office than any other Man you 
know South of the Potomac and that no other individual but 
one on the South Side of this fearful line should occupy it at 
this crisis of anxiety and peril. I confess if I were to go it 
would be without the motive of a single personal gratification 
of pleasure novelty or ostentatious honor, but for the single 
purpose of accomplishing a great object in the smallest possible 
time, and when that object is accomplished to come home. 

If Texas is annexed I shall be relieved of every embarrass- 
ment I have in the world and if I go to England on my return 
I hope to go into Congress immediately and be felt again 
before I die in the cause of the South. I trust in God I may 
yet contribute to placing you where your Country can alone 
reap the full fruition of your vertues and Genius. With this 
view whether you elect to go abroad or stay at home, if your 
health permits do not withdraw from the public eye, for I

cannot but think in the next four Years a Crisis will arise 
which will demand you[r] services in the highest Post known to 
the Constitution to save both it and the Country from destruc- 
tion. Everything but your health must be sacrificed to this 
consideration. As you will have vast power in controlling the 
movement of the Gov* thro the treaty-making power youfr] 
present Post I think would be far more influential than any 
other you could occupy. I shall be delighted if Polk has the 
sensibility to what is due to your character and an apprehen- 
siveness as to what is due to your ability and his own interests 
to invite you cordially into his Cabinet. 

On my arrival here I met Bentons project for annexation 
which I think if it is made definitive as far as fact of annex- 
ation is concerned is far more likely to obtain the concurrence 
of the people of Texas than the joint Resolutions of the House. 
These Resolutions really treat Texas as a conquered Territory. 
They appropriate her revenues for Customs altho these are 
solemnly pledged long since to a certain class of her Creditors 
and remit the whole of the,m of all classes to the (at present] 
utter unavailing and unavailable resource of her public 
Lands. This is not only countenancing but profiting by a 
most disgraceful repudiation. I am satisfied that the most 
influential Men in Texas connected with the Gov* would use the 
unceremonious arrogance and manifest bad faith of these 
Resolutions to defeat annexation forever. And let it be under- 
stood if Congress adjourns without consummating this measure 
I have strong reasons for believing that the British Gov* will 
submit to the people of Texas propositions providing for a 
recognition of the Independance of Texas by Mexico and a 
Peace between the two Countries without requiring any con- 
cessions on the Slave Question or any discrimination in favor 
of her Commerce but simply on the condition of Non Annex- 
ation and that Texas shall reduce her Tariff to 10 per cent ad 
valorem. If I did not believe from the immense number of 
European Emigrants coming into the Country under the 
Empresarios of the Prince 1 St. Johns Fisher and Castro that in 
5 years Texas would abolish Slavery by a popular Vote 1 
would come out at once against annexation under a belief that

a free port at Galveston would be a powerful Engine for free 
Trade in the U. S. but as it is I go for a Union between the

Ever My Dear Sir Yours faithfully 

J. HAMILTON. 

P. S. It has occurred to me that Benton's Bill if it were 
modified and divided into two sections the first to affirm that 
Texas was ipso facto from the passing of the Act a Member 
of the Union and his conditions made matters of detail to be 
arranged afterwards by Commissioners appointed by the 
Governments it would be far preferable for both and be much 
more likely to obtain the assent of Texas than the Resolutions 
of the House. Could not a compromise so as to insure the 
passing of an Act of Union be passed this Session. . . . 

Direct to me at the Oswichee at your earliest convenience. 
I shall drop M r . Polk a Letter tomorrow on the State of things 
at Texas more in detail than this communication. 



From Daniel E. linger -, 1 c. c. 

Charlestown March 24 th 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR The Senate adjourned on Thursday the 20 th 
and I reached this city yesterday the 23 d . 

Nothing occurred at Washington but what was in due 
course. The nominations of the President were confirmed 
generally. He refused to communicate to the Senate anything 
which had been done by M r . Tyler or himself, under the reso- 
lutions for admitting Texas. The Zoll-Verrein treaty was 
postponed until the next session of Cong 8 . M r . Webster 
appeared to understand perfect!} 7 the object of this treaty and 
its policy. Other gentlemen of his Party appeared to regard 
it as simply an attempt to reduce the Tariff, which they said 
ought not to be done but with the concurrence of the House 
of Representatives. 

'Judge Daniel E. Huger (1779-1854), one of the principal Union men of 1832, was for 
nearly fifty years identified with the public service of South Carolina. He served in 
Oalhoun's place in the Senate from*1843 to 1845, and then resigned, shortly after the writ- 
ing of this letter, in order to give an opportunity for Calhoun to return to the Senate. 
(See O'Neall's Bench and Bar of South Carolina, I. 180-184.) 



1028 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I was informed by the Secretary of State that the wish of 
the Presid* was to send a minister to England from the South- 
ern States and if possible from South Carolina. I have no 
doubt your indication of one would be attended to. Hopes 
are yet entertained that you might yet be induced to go. I 
said your friends had pressed you on this subject but that 
you appeared inflexible. 

M r . President and myself had some conversation as to Pro- 
scriptions in S. C a . The result was a declaration on his part, 
that no removals should take place here except /^ cause. 

The death of Senator Bates 1 afforded me an opportunity of 
taking ground which I was happy enough to perceive, was 
regarded as indicative of S. Carolina feeling. 

The course pursued by Gen 1 M c Duffie and myself on the 
Oregon question excited at first, unpleasant feelings, but 
before we parted, I think, even the gentlemen of our Party 
had ceased to indulge even disapprobation of our course. 

M r . Buch n spoke to me of the course the Mercury had pur- 
sued with respect to him. He declared to me he had done 
nothing and even had not a wish, to have }^ou supplanted in 
the State Department. He said you had been generously 
kind to him once for which he felt grateful. He did not 
appear entirely satisfied with his position a post in the Sen- 
ate he thought preferable. Should you ever concur in this 
opinion, I beg you will, without hesitation signify the same 
to me. We want you in the Senate. The Whigs there are 
much stronger than we are and I mistake much if the contest 
between the two parties does not in a very short time shew 
the necessity of some change, particularly in the Cabinet. If 
the Secretary of the Treasury does not turn out much more 
than is expected of him and far superior to his brother Minis- 
ters a change in the Cabinet must take place. M r . Buch n 
may fall on the Bench. No one has been nominated to till 
M r . Justice Baldwin's place. The President said to me he 
was determined to have a first rate man there and that this 
was the cause of his delay. He moreover said that in his 
opinion sufficient attention had not been given to this subject 
even by General Jackson himself.

Charleston 17 April 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR . . . Elmore shewed me Folk's letter offer- 
ing him the Mission to England and his reply. He refuses it 
solely on account of his embarrassments and the time allowed 
him being too short to prepare for leaving. Polk urged an 
immediate departure at the urgent request of Everett. I see 
from Elmore's letter that he has expected it from the "corre- 
spondence of friends at Washington." I take it for granted 
that time will be allowed Elmore and that he will yet go. It 
will be an excellent appointment the best that can be made 
considering the issues. I understand that there will be a 
change in the Cabinet and Buchanan will go on the bench &c. 
Walker is the ruling spirit. Ritchie will certainly go to 
Washington as "the organ," so Elmore informs me. It is 
said here that if Elmore does not accept that he has urged 
Gen. Hammond to go in his place. It is thought he will go. 

I think next to Elmore he will be the ablest man for us 

In haste but truly

Washington Texas April 24: 1845 

MY D r SIR, It gives me pleasure to inform you that upon 
the basis of the first and second sectionfs] of the Joint Reso- 
lution for the annexation of Texas, which you instructed me 






1030 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

to present to this Government, there is now a probability 
amounting to almost certainty that the measure will be con- 
summated before the next session of our Congress. 

Upon my arrival here there was excitement in the public 
mind, growing out of an impression that the President of 
this Republic would not accept the proposals, or refer the sub- 
ject to either Congress or the people. And there was unfor- 
tunately some ground for such an apprehension in the delay 
of the President to issue his Proclamation, yet he never for a 
moment in any interview with me intimated a wish to inter- 
pose an obstacle to the judgement of the people. 

You will be surprised, however, when I inform you that 
Gen 1 Houston brought all his influence to bear against our 
proposals, and in favor of resorting to the negotiation con- 
templated by the Senate amendment to the House bill. Upon 
the latter basis there is no doubt, aided by his influence, this 
Government expected to throw me back for new instructions; 
but my communication was prepared with a full knowledge 
of the temper of the Cabinet, and I presented it the morning 
after my arrival as containing the ultimatum of President 
Polk in which he had the concurrence also of President Tyler. 

Great hesitation and indecision were manifested throughout 
the corps of officeholders, and it was not until Gen 1 Houston 
could be seen, and until there were returns from other points 
in the State, that the President announced the issue of his 
Proclamation to call Congress. 

It is useless, however, to trouble you with the details of 
the various incidents which marked a settled purpose here to 
change the basis selected by my Government, nor will it be 
interesting to you to know the particular steps taken by me 
to defeat such a purpose. It is proper for me, however, to 
say to you that in a long correspondence into which I have 
been drawn by Gen 1 Houston I have been obliged to refer to 
certain statements from him representing the willingness of 
Texas to retain her public domain and pay her own debts. 
In a letter directed to you from New Orleans I urged upon 
you to let go that feature of the Treaty, stating to you that 
Houston thought Texas would be better off retaining than 
ceding her public lands. At the time he made this declara- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1031 

tion our attention was confined to M r M c Duffies bill, and it is 
obvious that when you took out of that bill the provisions 
concerning the public debt and lands of Texas, there was 
nothing left but the general provision admitting Texas as a 
Territory, and securing to her citizens a community of rights 
and privileges as citizens of the United States. In rebutting, 
the objections made by Gen 1 Houston to the House bill objec- 
tions drawn out with care and intended to influence President 
Jones I have maintained that he was committed substantially 
to that bill, and could not oppose it without a change of the 
position occupied by him in December last, when I communi- 
cated to you confidentially the extent to which the provisions 
of the Treaty might be modified without danger to the meas- 
ure, so far as it depended upon the approbation of Texas. As 
that letter may be important to me I wish you to preserve it. 

Without further reference to the progress of the measure 
since my last arrival at this place, I may say to you that 
President Jones in convoking Congress has removed the only 
possible obstacle to its consummation, which was the neces- 
sity of obtaining " the consent of the existing Government" to 
the proposals contained in the House bill. Congress will give 
this consent most cheerfully, and authorise a convention of 
the people at an early day, when a new constitution and a 
Government adapted to the changes made necessary by the 
admission into our Union, will follow in time for the next 
meeting of our Congress. 

The people of Texas are holding public meetings throughout 
the Territory, and are expressing their approbation of the 
terms offered to them by the United States with a unanimity 
which no other debated question has ever received. 

This great measure is therefore consummated unless the 
spirit of faction, appearing again in our Congress, may refuse 
to pass the law redeeming our pledge to Texas when she 
brings forward her Republican form of Government. 

I congratulate you on the possession of an additional guar- 
antee for our safety from internal as well as external foes a 
guarantee which you have sacrificed much to obtain, and for 
which the country can never thank you and President Tyler 
too much.

Richmond April 27 th 1845 

MY DEAR SIR I have postponed writing to you as I promised 
until I could speak with certainty of the result of the Virginia 
elections that result is now known and a glorious one it is. 
We shall have a majority on joint ballot ranging from 15 to 
25 and it may go up to 30. I think this majority will be of 
the right stamp. But more than this Hunter and Seddon are 
elected. The former by nearly 200 majority; and the latter 
by 262, In this heretofore strong Whig population never have 
I seen such a triumph. Old Hanover has come back to us by 
a majority of 32. Hunters own county Essex, returns to the 
Democratic family. Bailey is elected in the accompanying 
district by at least 120 majority. Atkinson, Dromgoole, 
Treadway, Hubbard, Leake (from the Albermarle District) 
Bedinger, Taylor, Hopkins or Grange, Chapman, Johnson, 
Brown and Taylor, are all elected, leaving the Loudon District 
alone to the Federalists, and that has elected a Texas Whig. 
Thus you will see My Dear Sir that our old State has been 
waked up, and that she may now be counted on to lead this 
House in the coming struggle. Could we have done more? 
Your best and strongest friends go to Washington. They will 
with your own State delegation present an array of talent, 
firmness, sound judgment, fidelity, to our principles and ele- 
vation of character above vastly above their adversaries. But 
a new enquiry at once arises. Hunters election removes him 
from the list of those from whom a selection of Senator will be 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1033 

made. Our present Governor goes out next Winter and we 
have to elect another. Who are to fill these high stations? 
The West will expect to have one of these. For years our 
Governors have come from beyond the mountains. Archer 
our Senator lives in Amelia. The West will then probably 
claim the Senator and the East the Governor. But who are 
they to be. Our present Governor l will not do for the Senate. 
But he is young comparatively and talented. Many of the 
Western members will prefer him, but I have no idea he can 
be elected. Judge Pennypacker is the next choice with that 
branch of the party. But he can hardly be elected for reasons 
as strong if not stronger, than those applicable to our Gov- 
ernor. In looking about D r Brockenbrough, who is quasi a 
resident of the West has occurred to some of us. But is he 
sufficiently separated from the old leaven ? If not he would 
be worse than either for his controling influence over the new 
organ at Washington would be fatal. Yet I have strong rea- 
sons for believing that the Doctor is at heart with us. Do 
you know anything on this subject? If you do, fail not at 
once to let some friend here be informed of what you do 
know. If he will go with us, to place him in the Senate 
would be a measure of inestimable value. Your own observa- 
tion will at once picture out the great advantages. I have 
taken measures to procure information on this head, but it 
will be some weeks before I can procure it in a reliable form. 
The selection of our Governor is hardly of less importance 
than the Senator. A sound, able, practical man at the head 
of the State, would give a direction at home to our move- 
ments, such as would rapidly give power, efficiency and cohe- 
sion to our party. We shall have less difficulty as to this 
selection than the other. For in the East we can present 
several names upon which our friends can rally. William O. 
Goode, Richard Kidder Meade &c would give us all we could 
desire. Already are our friends quietly } r et decidedly looking 
to these matters. The last evening brought me several let- 
ters. Dromgoole might have been in our way, but his intem- 
perate habits place him I think out of the chance of further 
elevation. Such is a brief outline of our position as to men. 
But my Dear Sir, old Virginia is now sounder than for 20

years on the great principles which you hold dear. Texas 
and the Tariff have this spring done the work. Texas, because 
that is truly a question connecting itself with the South and 
the Slavery of the South. The tariff because Virginia has 
firmly resolved to abide not by the plundering bill of 1842, 
but resolutely at all hazards to demand its modification. In 
this, the tide water country of Virginia are nearly unanimous. 
And especially, that long populous and rich peninsula between 
the waters of the York and the Rappahannock extending from 
New Point Comfort to the foot of the blue Ridge, and embrac- 
ing the counties of Matthews, Middlesex, Gloucester King 
and Queen, King William, Essex, Hanover, Carolina Spot- 
sylvania, Orange, Madison, and Green, from which not a single 
Whig has been elected to our Legislature. Accomac too, sends 
us both Democrats and Warwick and Elizabeth City elects a 
Democrat, and turns out a Whig. Indeed looked upon in 
every aspect, I do from my very soul, most heartily congrat- 
ulate you upon this victory, as the [presage] of what is to fol- 
low. Our people look now to your State to give us in due 
season the successor of the President. In regard to Mr. 
Ritchie, and his taking charge of the Government organ * at 
Washington, I cannot undertake at this moment to fore- 
shadow what may become of it. But I have but slight fears 
as to the consequences. We here stand now in a position to 
restrain any offensive action. We are too strong to be trifled 
with, much less deceived, even was there a disposition to do 
either, which I by no means suspect. But the possession of 
strength and its wise use is the position of safety. The for- 
mer we have, and the latter I have no doubt will be practiced. 
I am deceived in our men, if this be not proved. Already 
the supporters of the Enquirer in Virginia, are appealing to 
us, to keep up its vigor, and to take measures for preserving 
its future influence and efficiency. As to Mr. Polks dispensa- 
tion of office, we took him for but little. Indeed in my judg- 
ment the less we get the better. None certainly ought to be 
sought or taken, by begging for it, as the medicant seeks his 
daily bread. I have little question the office of Secretary of 
State is alread}^ too hot for the present incumbent. What 
with our Texan negotiations, Mexican troubles, Brazilian

squabbles and the growling of John Bull, I rather suspect 
the Pennsylvanian would be glad to be back in the Senate. 
Or has a longing eye to a quiet seat on the bench of the 
Supreme court. And then among the on dits of the day we 
hear Mr. Stevenson is to become premier, and Mason to retire, 
or go abroad. About all this I know but little, and care less. 
If Mr. Polk and his Cabinet do right, I will approve, if wrong 
I will not spare them the less, but on the contrary condemn 
them the more because I gave my aid to bring them into 
power. But I have wandered from the main purpose of this 
letter, which was to let you know how stood things in Vir- 
ginia, that accomplished 1 design to stop. With my best and 
sincerest wishes for your health and happiness, 

I am with high regard and respect yours truly

Washington. 2 nd May 1845 

MY DEAR SIR I enclose you a copy of a letter to M r Pickens. 1 
It explains itself. I do not see how he can hesitate to adopt the 
course I recommend, and I hope that it will meet your appro- 
bation. By going to England, on a special mission, charged 
with these important negotiations you will, I verily believe be 
able to conclude a favorable treaty. You will find a powerful 
and influential party who believe that it is the interest of 
England that all her colonies should, as soon as they [are] 
capable of self government, become independent Governments 
with friendly commercial treaties with England, and these 
will be glad to surrender Oregon, as part of a commercial 
arrangement with this country 

If you fail you will have discharged your duty, and identi- 
fied your name with the honor and interest of the United 
States so that you can do more than any other man to guide 
future events. A new crisis has arisen since the coming in of 
the new administration, and your acceptance of the Office 
under these circumstances will give you new claims on the

confidence of the Country, and be considered every where as 
an acknowledgment of your merits and superior qualifications. 

If you refuse, it will be charged that you are soured and 
disappointed, and you will be held responsible for .any failure 
in the negotiations which may occur. 

Some of your friends say that if you make a treaty it will 
be assailed, because it is made by you. I admit that the his- 
tory of the Texas negotiation would seem to justify such an 
opinion, but I think it will be otherwise because the new nego- 
tiation will be sustained by M r Polk. Ritchie will be here 
and will be committed in advance. Benton's power to do you 
injury no longer exists and all parties will fear to assail a good 
treaty if it makes an end of the controversy, and if you fail, 
You will have the American feeling to fall back on, which will 
be stronger as the pretensions and objects of England will be 
exposed by you. 

I hope You will place what I have done to the proper motives. 
Believe me as ever your sincere friend

are the vilest of hypocrites if they are not your friends. I 
am old enough to distrust all politicians, for they are the pests 
of every community in which they are members. The loss 
of personal hopes and the consequent lapse of selfishness into 
patriotism make them your friends, as far as they can be 
friends of anybody, in spite of antient predelections. Sev- 
eral little anecdotes were told me to satisfy me of Bancrofts 
admiration of your ability in the despatches to the British 
Minister. And one of these occurring in Cabinet Council.

hausted both their powers and their hopes in wrangles for 
other uses than those of the Country; they may now fall back 
in commendation of you, as the offering which "Vice gives to 
Virtue". The agent I believe is according to the Masters in 
Ethicks, vicious or virtuous according to his intention, but the 
act good or ill according to its tendency. Be this as it may 
these people are professedly at least your friends very lauda- 
tory of you. And I may add that which was my chief pur- 
pose in picking up my pen to write you the President (Colo 
Polk) is so likewise. 

Mr. Polk is b} 7 nature a good man, plain in understanding, 
raised into aspiration by the advent of peculiar combinations 
of powers, parties, and persons; and successful to the highest 
limit in the altitude of aspiration. He may naturally and I 
believe patriotickly wish first that he may be succeeded by 
the most worthy for his own gratification and secondly for the 
Countrys weal. I have the best reason to think that his pres- 
ent hopes and wishes lean to you. It was he who recounted 
to me M r Bancrofts eulogy on reading (or hearing) your let- 
ter to the British Ambassador. I know that Ritchie is decid- 
edly your friend. And I know he is a friend to be valued. 
The young Ritchies 1 know nothing of; but the old man is far 
more sincere and honest than We might expect from a hack- 
nied politician. 

The President asked me why it was that the South Carolina 
Statesmen declined the Mission to England ? I replied that it 
was a matter of which I was wholly uninformed. I thought 
his views correct In this 1 st That the Mission ought to go 
to a Slave State, 2 d , particularly to South Carolina. I was 
alone with Mr. Polk for near two hours and I am greatly 
deceived if he is not sincerely your friend. He spoke of 
Wright as being powerless and in a tone of the feud of Dallas 
and Buchanan which left me with the belief that he regarded 
them both as feeble for ill or injury to others or profit to 
themselves. I may have been deceived in all that I heard. 
Yet I do not think so. When kindness is felt and is sincere 
in its tendency^ and object, it cannot always be repulsed with 
justice or policy. Unsolicited support for political trust, by 
those towards whom we have acted in opposition, and who are

without personal regard to us, is perhaps high commendation 
to the object of support, and moreover commendation to the 
patriotism which offers its aid under such circumstances. To 
repulse it is I think neither wise nor dutiful. The substance 
of my thoughts is this: Those people at Washington wish to 
be your friends whether the motive be good or bad is it wise 
to discard their favour? 

With great Respect and Sincere Regard 

Yr friend J. S. BARBOUR 



From W. A. Harris. 1 c. c. 

Washington 11. July 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR: I have been postponing for three months 
past, the purpose of writing to you; hoping each day, that I 
might have some striking fact to communicate, worthy of 
your special notice. 1 shall, in as few words as possible, 
endeavor to put you in possession of such facts and inferences, 
as I may think will be of some interest to 3 r ou. 

In the first place then, I have seen nothing in the course or 
conduct of M r . Polk, public or private, that changes in the 
least my opinion of him, somewhat warmly expressed to you, 
before you left; but, on the contrary, much to confirm it. In 
a single word, he is not equal to the station; and, it will oper- 
ate forever hereafter, as a caution to us, to compromise on no 
second or third rate man for the presidency. A second rate 
man might indeed do, if he were thoroughly honest and disin- 
terested, free from prejudice and that little ambition which 
attaches itself to small minds in such a situation, of desiring 
to be thought above the reach of even Cabinet influence. 
Such persons most probably at once pass under some other 
influence less worthy to be trusted. These remarks find a 
practical application in the present head of our national 
affairs. 

The policy of the President seems to be to forget his friends 
and buy up his enemies. Hence Benton, Blair, and the New 
York regency can command any thing. I say so, because they

have done it. The Van Buren-Wright men got every thing 
in New York that they wanted, till they came to the Custom 
House. In that case, M r . Van Ness seemed to be in all 
respects so unexceptionable, so fitted for the office by every 
necessary and proper qualification, that every body said let 
him be retained. M r . Polk seemed for a while to appreciate 
this feeling, and to be fully influenced by the common senti- 
ment. But, the spoils-men were not to be put off so. They 
commenced agitating and moving upon the President with 
the most energetic pertinacity. Though their ward meetings 
failed them, still they continued to agitate. The President 
for a time seemed unmoved by their efforts and importunity, 
and less persevering men would have desisted; but they per- 
sisted in their purposes, till they ascertained the assailable 
point they touched it and the work was accomplished. 
They ascertained that the great object of M r . Polk was to 
give the Union the public printing. They at once got the 
members elect from New York, through the commanding 
influence of a few distinguished names, to say, that unless M r . 
Van Ness was removed, they could not vote for Ritchie and 
Heiss as public printers. That hint was enough. M r Van 
Ness was an avowed Calhoun and free trade man, and had to 
share the fate of all others of that way of thinking. 

They recently offered M r . Blair 1 the mission to Spain. He 
growled his refusal, by telling them he " wanted none of their 
Missions." They then beseechingly asked him if his son 
Montgomery Blair of Missouri would not accept a chargeship, 
which was also refused; but, leave was given him to fill all the 
offices in Missouri, which he has availed himself of to the 
fullest extent. 

The Benton -Blair- Van Buren party intend to make war upon 
the Administration and upon the free trade party or in other 
words, upon Polk, yourself and friends. They will have a press, 
it is said, established here in a month from this time. It is 
also asserted, that [at] a recent meeting of Van Buren, Wright, 
and other dignitaries at Coddington's in New York, these 
arrangements, and God know what else, were decided upon. 
The story goes, that M r . Cambreling alone subscribed ten 
thousand dollars to establish the press. They can certainly

make it a formidable engine every way. But, can they get 
the public printing? They are certainly going for it. Pre- 
liminary to this open outbreak, John C. Rives, 1 who had just 
been elected president of the Democratic association, read a 
sort of inaugural address upon taking the chair, in which he 
exhibited to the fullest extent, his hostility to the Adminis- 
tration and to yourself. It was sent, with the Proceedings of 
the meeting, to the Union to be published, and was actually 
set up, but the proof reader called the attention of M r . Ritchie 
to it, and he in consternation ran to the President, and it was 
actually the subject of a Cabinet meeting. They determined 
to suppress it; and thereby showed great shortsightedness and 
bad policy. Heiss showed me a copy of it in confidence, and 
its bitterness may be considered as a fair illustration of the 
general feeling of the Van Buren party. Rives invited the 
President and Cabinet, and the editors of the Democratic 
press here, to be present on the 4 th of July, at the ceremony 
of laying the corner stone of "Jackson Hall." This is to be 
a very large building put up by Blair and Rives for a printing 
office, and to contain a Hall for the meetings of the Demo- 
cratic associations and other democrats of the District. Well, 
the Cabinet and the editors were present, and, with many 
other things, M r . Rives announced that he deposited a copy of 
that speech in the corner stone. I laughingly told them, that 
I thought we had all been made to play a very silly part, in 
coming to see M r Rives lay the corner stone of opposition to 
the present or any future administration, that did not exactly 
please his clique. Chagrin was upon the face of the whole 
party, and they could not conceal it. 

The signs of dissatisfaction with the administration, are 
showing themselves on all bides. It was but the other day, 
that they were about to hold a public meeting in Cincinnati 
to express their dissatisfaction with the administration, and it 
was only by the efforts of Col. Medill, 2 d assistant Postmaster 
General, that it was suppressed. He told me himself, that he 
had made promises on behalf of the administration, which, if 
they did not fulfill, would only make the dissatisfaction the 
greater, and the outbreak when it did come, the stronger. 
The democratic papers in Mississippi are fiercely assailing M r .

Walker. l They make his improperly withholding the Govern- 
or's Commission appointing Thompson 2 a senator, the ground of 
the attack upon him; but, it is palpable that they have lost 
confidence in him. They believed him to be concerned with 
D r . Gwin and Col. M c Lemore in extensive Indian speculations 
of some sort, now in progress, and over which the Treasury 
Department may perhaps exercise some peculiar control. 
They fear that he is unsound upon the Tariff and the Inde- 
pendent Treasury; and, I am sorry to say, not without reason. 
I understand that he and Ritchie are cooking up some sort of 
a league of State Banks, which is to be offered instead of the 
Sub Treasury. And the bill of Gen 1 M c Kay, 3 is to be offered 
as a compromise upon the tariff. I have taken, on the part 
of the friends of free trade, the strongest grounds against all 
compromises upon the subject of the Tariff; consenting to 
nothing but rigid and exact justice in the premises. And, at 
the same time going for the Subtreasury and a total separa- 
tion of the government from the Banks, as declared at the 
Baltimore Convention, before we entered upon the Canvass. 
I know that the people, and especially the great west, are 
entirely and fully with us on these questions. At the same 
time, I have treated the subject as if I did not for a moment 
doubt the intention of M r . Polk and his Cabinet to go for 
these measures. For, whatever ma}^ be my private opinion 
upon the subject, I consider it the best policy to exhibit the 
greatest show of confidence now to hold them to the condi- 
tions of the Baltimore resolutions and the natural expecta- 
tions of the party so that, if they should falter or fail in the 
hour of trial, we may have the fullest justification to denounce 
the treachery and the injury. Hunter, Seddon, and Bedinger, 
who have just been here, fully concur in the propriety of this 
course. 

In regard to the prospects of the Constitution press, it is 
hard to tell whether we shall be able to keep it going till the 
meeting of Congress or not. I have completely exhausted 
my pecuniary means to keep it up, and it has placed me in a 
very unpleasant situation. Unless our friends come to our

aid, in the only way which can be really useful for money is 
the sinew of the press as well as of war we must in the end 
be crushed by the efforts of the administration, who are using 
all the patronage and all the influence which they can com- 
mand, to give the Union, not only the public printing, but the 
control of everything. This is the object and the interest, 
both of M r . Polk and M r . Ritchie. For let me say emphatic- 
ally, that notwithstanding the disclaimers of M r . Ritchie, in 
his own peculiar way, M r . Polk will be a candidate for re-elec- 
tion, if by any means lie can procure a renomination. I have 
seen enough and heard enough to convince me of that. No 
one doubts it here. A communication in the Richmond 
Enquirer (from Selden the Treasurer I think Ritchie's sense 
keeper, as the Indians have it) will convince anyone who may 
doubt. If, then, our free trade friends will stand by and see 
us thrust aside by M r . Polk, and the whole patronage of the 
legislative departments given to a press in which his own 
family is interested, why so be it. We must submit with the 
best grace we can though we should be satisfied with the 
printing of the Senate. 

You probably do not know the partners in the Union. 
Ritchie owns half, Heiss a fourth, J. Knox Walker the Presi- 
dent's nephew and private secretary a fourth, and Senator 
Cameron of Pennsylvania did hold the other fourth, but for 
some reason or other they made him sell out, and it now 
stands in the name of L. S. Coryell of Pennsylvania, who has 
from the first been a very active agent in the business; though 
he assures me that he really has no pecuniary interest in it. 

An idea prevails here, and I think it took its rise in the lati- 
tude of the Union office, that from your interview with M r . 
Ritchie when passing through Richmond on your way home, 
that you had such assurances of his friendly dispositions 
towards you, that you are really desirous that he should suc- 
ceed in his purposes here. I do not even ask to know of you 
whether he made you any of his diplomatic promises; but, this 
I know, that the whole course of his policy now, is against 
your interests and the interests and hopes of your friends. 
And furthermore, in a letter from him to his son-in-law Thomas 
Green, written soon after you had passed through Richmond, 
and which was shown to me for a different object, he there 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 1043 

took credit to himself, for having in no way committed him- 
self to you; and no little credit for his firmness in suppressing 
some manifestations of enthusiasm in your favor. Jlis whole 
mind and energies are bent on uniting the interests of New 
York with the interests of the West. He goes for Davis of 
Indiana as Speaker of the House. The south and southwest, 
they seem to think, as Hunter remarked the other day, 
"already bagged," and of course no further effort is necessary 
in that respect. 

Thus I have, at greater length than I intended, jotted down 
just as they have occurred to me, various facts and circum- 
stances as they appear here. You will draw your own conclu- 
sions from them. If it would not be taxing you too much, I 
should be most happy to hear from you. You might afford 
me important suggestions for my government, in this, I must 
believe, very important crisis in our affairs. I need scarcely 
say, that whatever you may communicate, will be with me, 
under the seal of inviolable confidence. 

Most sincerely and truly, Y r ob. Sevt.

Bancroft is the soundest and best man in the Cabinet. The 
general impression is that the cabinet must dissolve before 
long. M r . Buchanan told me himself, not long since, that he 
was sorry that he ever left the Senate. They have Cabinet 
meetings nearly every day.

SIR On addressing you these few lines not only 1 feel very 
happy by paying you this attention, as a proof of my grati- 
tude for all your kindness, but still I think to be an agreable 
complyence of duty on my part to inform you of the return 
of the U. S. Commissioner John Hogan Esq re . after having 
visited our towns, places and principal counties, and examined 
our organisation, our political and moral Situation, the means

Washington. (See Curtis's Life of James Buchanan, I, 576.)

we actually possess, those to be soon expected by encrease of 
commerce and agriculture, and our capacity of maintening 
our Independence. 

It will be of no use for me to enter into any particulars 
about the prolixes investigations entered to by said Commis- 
sioner in fulfilment of his mission; his report and the docu- 
ments he carryes shall speak more than what I could say to 
you; but allow me, Sir, to submit to your consideration some 
ideas, which, in my opinion, may strongly contribute to 
examine the question of recognition of the Dominican Repub- 
lic in a proper light, and to prompt the U. S. cabinet to give 
their decision with the Shortness of time that such a question 
requires, leaving the making of a Treaty for an Spead period 
of time, say for the month of October. 

I say First: That the two villages on the line of boundaries, 
Caoba8 and Hincha, which were occupied by the haytians 
troops, at the time of the landing of the U. S. Commissioner 
in the City of S to Domingo, have been taken in the month of 
June last by the Dominicans after fighting, and compelling 
the haytians forces to enter their territory, and by these vic- 
tories the Dominican Republic is in full possession of her 
bounderies, and has augumented her forces on the line to 
secure the same. 

Second: That the general feelings and sympaties of the 
whole Dominican people are in favour of the Government and 
Citizens of the U. S. in preference to all forcing European 
Powers, for whom they entertain the greatest repugnancy, 
and dislike to be united, being monarchial governments. 

Third: That with respect to Spain, the ancient holder of 
Hispaniola, by the civil dissensions, by the sectional partis, 
by the exhausted political and financial State under which 
that Nation has been and is still labouring, by her silence 
about the Dominican Republic since the declaration of her 
independance on the night of 27 th february 1844. and by the 
recognition lately made by Spain of the Republic of Vene- 
zuela after being aware of the Dominican revolution, it is to 
be expected that She will be disposed to acknowledge the 
independance of Hispaniola obtained by the Dominicans, 
whose courageous determination has put end to haytian 
usurpations, from which event a real benefit shall arise in 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1045 

favour of the tranquillity of the Islands of Porto Rico and 
Cuba, having- nothing to fear from the Dominican Govern- 
ment, and in joying such good results without any expences 
on the part of Spain. 

Fourth: That in said Two Islands it exist great dispositions 
and desire to become Independants, particularly in Porto 
Rico, where the best informed inhabitants are exalted and cry 
up against the system of Spain and the heavy taxes they are 
obliged to pay for the payment of European officers and army; 
and by the U. S. acknowledging the independance of the 
Dominican Republic They will haste their political change, 
being by that assured That they will obtain the Same without 
any hesitation, and so all the Colonies will consider the U. S. 
as the only Nation to protect them. 

1 hope these ideas will meet your approbation and please to 
communicate them to the Hon. Ex President John Tyler as 
you were the authors of M r . Hogan's mission to this country 
prepossessed of Those feelings that humanity and Cristendom 
commands in favour of opressed people. And although 
neither of you are now to decide on the question I avail 
myself to believe That you both will contribute to bring the 
question of the Dominican Republic to a favourable conclusion, 
for which the Dominicans shall be gratefully indebted to the 
most high gratitude. 

Expecting the honour of hearing soon from you 

I remain Sir with respect and true affection your most ob*.

Silver Bluff 18 Aug 1845 

MY DEAR SIR. It always affords me so much satisfaction to 
concur with you in opinion and it is so unpleasant to differ, 
that in deference to your judgment I chalked out an article 
for the Mercury after receiving your last letter and began to 
take quite an interest in it. But when I came to fill it up I 
became so convinced that it would do far more harm than 



JSee Calhoun's letters of August 2 and 30, 1845, in Part I, supra. 



1046 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

good that I desisted. If I could have written merely a com- 
plimentary notice of D r Bascom['s] book it might have passed, 
and if there had been little or no point in it, would have been 
thought of no more. But everything from S C a in relation 
to the Slave question attracts attention and must have some 
weight. To compliment D r Bascom for this book, without 
noticing its unsound and dangerous doctrines in strong terms 
would have had a bad effect in more ways than one, and to 
notice it in such a manner would have been I think imprudent 
just now. Judging by the difficulty I had in reading his con- 
fused and long spun essay, which I did solely with a view to 
meet your wishes, I am pretty certain you have only looked 
at it here and there and cannot have seen many passages in it. 
Besides saying that the Bible does not sustain Slavery and 
that it is an evil, he declares that it is u on all hands admitted 
to be an evil", that if any way of getting clear of it was 
pointed out and shown to be safe it " would find few opponents 
here ", that to say the Southern methodists are in favour of 
Slavery is a ifc libel and an outrage", that they have been doing 
and will continue to do all they can to get rid of it &c &c. 
Now if his book is noticed in South Ca\ such sentiments as 
these must be peremptorily denied and strongly rebuked, or 
the whole body of sound methodists who are neither abolition- 
ists nor colonizationists, will have a damper thrown over them, 
and may be inclined to yield to the powerful influences at 
work to make Bascom a Bishop, to retain the very gross and 
offensive Chapter on Slavery in the Discipline book, to locate 
the Book concern as well as Missionary Treasury in Kentucky 
and in Short to give these pseudo friends of the Slaveholders 
an overwhelming domination over S Methodism, which would 
soon become as dangerous to us as that of the North. I do 
not mean to say that so insignificant an article as I might 
write would materially aid in bringing about these results, 
but it would tend in that way and coming from S C a might 
have far more influence than it might otherwise have. At 
this moment such an article in the Mercury would probably 
be caught up in Kentucky. There is growing up a powerful 
abolition excitement there. Cassius Clay differing no way 
in principle from D r Bascom and Henry Clay and doubtless 
looking to them for support in an emergency and likely to 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1047 

receive it, is making the most powerful appeal in his new paper 
"The True American" to the nonslaveholders of Kentucky, 
and preaching insurrection to both black and white. He 
could not be tolerated a moment, if Kentucky was sound or 
his friends less powerful. The people however are waking 
up. Abolition entered largely into the canvass between Davis 
and Marshall and will become a leading question in elections 
very soon. I hope and believe in a short time the Clays Bas- 
coms and all of that stamp will be put down completely and 
Kentucky redeemed. It is not then a time for S C a to give 
Bascom a wing. I think also that the true Southern Metho- 
dists are displeased with his Review. They praised it in 
advance, but have received it very coldly. There are reasons 
for this besides his unsound views of Slavery. He has placed 
D r Capers rather in the light of an officious meddler in his 
early attempts in the General Conference to reunite the North 
and South, and has without necessity dwelt upon the fact that 
Bishop Andrew was elected by the North "imposed upon 
the South against her wishes". These flings show no good 
feeling and the D r evidently aims to absorb for himself all the 
glory of the action of the South. Our Methodists see what 
this leads to and have their eyes on the consequences 1 have 
mentioned above. To elevate D r Bascom would be at their 
expense. I think therefore every thing considered that a 
mere complimentary review of his work, slurring over his 
dangerous opinions would in every point of view be impolitic, 
as well as a dereliction of our own duty considering the posi- 
tion South Ca occupies. 

On the other hand to rebuke him severely is not perhaps 
called for now and would be equally impolitic. The Metho- 
dist controversy has by no means ended. The seperation of 
the Church is inevitable, but the great question remains whether 
it will be a Division or a Secession, and that involves a very 
large amount of property. The share of the Southern Con- 
ference in the various Methodist funds is not short of $300.000. 
The North will undoubtedly endeavour to cheat them out of 
it. Their Editors and writers have already taken the ground 
that the South has Seceded. I have little doubt that a great 
Lawsuit will be carried on. Pending that and the whole con- 
troversy, it would be better to let the Southern Church get 



1048 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

on with what harmony it can and sow no seeds of dissension. 
I do not doubt, the Methodists would prefer to be allowed to 
manage the whole matter for themselves. Their S. papers 
have carefully abstained from responding to or noticing an}^ 
expressions of opinion by the politicians. You saw how ready 
and anxious the North was to catch them in this trap by 
charging a correspondence between you and D r Capers. 

On the whole I trust that you will believe that if I have not 
good reasons for declining to comply with your request, I 
have not done it without looking all around the matter with 
what circumspection and judgement I possess, and that my 
convictions are sincere that it better not be done. 

The Northern papers are making a handle of the political 
portion of my Clarkson Letters. 1 In New Hampshire they 
are pushed directly at Woodbury and for effect a much more 
conspicuous position in the Democratic ranks has been assigned 
me than I ever occupied. I am not sure it would not be good 
policy to have me read out of them. I propose to have so 
little to do with politics hereafter have always so disliked 
the name of Democrat and really have so little feeling in 
common with the great body of Democrats out of S Ca, that 
such a black balling would cost me very little. If it would 
do any body any good I would cheerfully submit to it. If I 
were in public life I would of course adhere as far as I could 
to the party whose principles and purposes were nearest my 
own. Being out of it and probably forever, I dont see why 
I should belong to any party and should certainly be sorry to 
embarrass any in the least. Lewis Tappan and I are corre- 
sponding and have been for some time. I never thought of 
such a thing as a publication of the correspondence until he 
suggested it in his last. I declined, but I fear that I may be 
served as Birney served Elmore. 2 To prevent it if possible I 
have taken the matter up^in earnest and with a view to drive 
the notion out of his mind. There are many views of the 
matter not yet fully treated. Among them is to deprive the 
Abolitionists of the Clap-trap of the "Golden Rule of Christ", 
" the laws of nature and natural rights" and to make them

and to trace "Southern decay" to other causes than Slavery

P. S. To prove how sincerely I approve the Division of 
the M. Church and the course of the body of S. methodists 
thus far, I will state, that soon after the Gen 1 . Conference 
broke up last year, I got the Circuit preachers to make a 
Station here, which I support entirely myself. They preach 
in my School House (and at my plantation also) but I am now 
completing a handsome Church for them which will cost me 
$1200. Nor will I fail to contribute my mite to make up 
any pecuniary losses that may accrue to them from this Seces- 
sion if it be so decided. In fact my advice will be not to sue, 
but give up the money if the North refuses to divide tfie 
funds, and to throw themselves on Southern generosity. 



From E. E. Ehett. c. c. 

Sept. 18, 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR I passed through Washington on my way 
home; and took the occasion to seeM r . Walker M r . Buchanan 
and the President on the subject of the Tariff'. My purpose 
was to ascertain what the administration really proposed to 
do, and informed them casually of my object. - The President 
was prepared with no details. He went for a reduction of the 
Tariff', but on no principles that I could understand, unless a 
mere reduction might be supposed to be a relinquishment of 
any reformation of principle in the existing Tariff. M r . 
Buchanan talked fairer. He said he was indifferent to the 
principle, believing that a revenue Tariff would afford all the 
protection required. But still I got from him no details, 
excepting that he thought the Tariff might be reduced to 25 
per Cent. To this however he distinctly declared that Gen 1 . 
M c Kay's Bill of the last Congress ought to be the standard of 



1050 AMERICAN" HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

reduction and reformation. M r . Walker was more explicit. 
He went into details and all his details with one or two excep- 
tions, were precisely Gen 1 . M c Kay's Bill. After hearing all, 
I am satisfied that that Bill substantially is all the administra- 
tion will propose, and that is all we will get, from the Demo- 
cratic Party, if we get that. I do not think we will obtain 
however even that. 

Under these circumstances, connected with the course of 
the administration towards our Wing of the Party, it is nec- 
essary to determine before Congress meets, what course we 
shall pursue. Shall we act out the conviction we expressed 
in the Presidential election, and take it for granted that the 
administration is about to be true to us ? With this line of 
policy we ought to vote for M r . Ritchie as Printer, go into 
Caucus as to who shall be Speaker &c. The Constitution 
must stop without the printing of the Senate; and we have no 
organ, in case the Government proves false. Or shall we 
take the contrary course, take it for granted that the admin- 
istration and the Democratic Partv- are about to be false to 
us, refuse to go into Caucus on the Speakership &c., and run 
in the Senate for the Printing for the Constitution. The two 
Carolina Senators and Colquitt and Lewis 1 are [illegible] it. 
For my part, I shall not be found again as at the opening of 
the last Congress, attempting what our friends have not cour- 
age to execute. I must be sure of my game before I attempt 
it. You know my opinions of the Democratic Party. Cir- 
cumstances since M r . Polk's election has not at all altered 
them, on the contrary every movement at Washington I 
think has tended to prove my estimation true. M r . Reverdy 
Johnson informed me in London that a Senator told him that 
Walker the Secy of the Treasury had boasted to him, that he 
was the real author of the Kane Letter; 2 and his questions 
sent on here, have occasioned great surprise and dissatisfac- 
tion. I have no faith in them, in carrying out correct prin- 
ciples. All we can expect on this Tariff, is a modified Pro- 
tective Tariff Act. And if this proves to be true, what course 
then shall the Delegation pursue in Congress? Shall they 
support it and vote for it ? or shall they act towards it, as the

it, denounce it, and come [home?] to resist it? These are 
questions that we ought to be prepared to meet at the open-

the beginning.

Blue Sulphur Springs Sept r . 23 rd 1845 
MY DEAR SIR: When I received your letter of the 7 th of 
June I was just on the eve of starting to the Salt works in 
Kanawha, and had not time to acknowledge its receipt. In- 
deed I was unwilling to do so before I had seen our friends in 
person and ascertained their opinions on the views contained 
.in it. I saw Judge M c Comas and Thompson, (with some 
others) in the Western part of the State during my stay in 
Kanawha; and, fortunately, on my return to Lynchburg, six 
weeks since, met with Goode who was then on his way to Rich- 
mond. We had a full conversation on all the topics suggested, 
and it was agreed that he should see our friends in Richmond, 
and after obtaining their views communicate with me here. A 
few days since he passed by this place, (having in the mean- 
time been westward as far as Kentucky) and gave me a pretty 
full account of all he had been able to ascertain. 

There is much diversity of opinion in regard to the main 
question as well as to the time. Seddon and Scott, (and Goode 
after he had conversed with them) incline to the opinion it 
would be hazardous to venture a rupture with the old clique 
at this time; believing it better to wait the meeting of the 
Legislature in order more fully to ascertain the views and 
wishes of your friends generally. To move now, and more 
especially in opposition to the cherished system of the Party 
might, they think, give them the vantage ground, and place 
formidable weapons in their hands for future use. The course 

1 Richard K. Crall6, originally a journalist, had been confidential clerk to Mr. Calhoun, 
during the period of the latter's service as Secretary of State. Subsequently, he edited 
the Works of John C. Calhoun, in six volumes, published in 1851. 



1052 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

they recommend is, (for the present) to wait the progress of 
events, to rally the Party during the next Legislature, and 
organize for the Spring Campaign in the State. To affect this 
it is proposed to start a State Rights man in every County 
avowedly to test the strength of the Party, and bring out its 
full force. Goode thinks we can carry the State openly under 
the ' ' Calhoun Flag "and tells me to say to you that he shall 
insist upon the open avowal of our determination to sustain it 
at all hazards. Seddon believes that you are gaining strength 
every day, and fears to hazard the prospects before us by any 
decisive movement at present; while he is fixed as steel to run 
our ticket at all events when the proper time arrives. On this 
point there is no hesitancy, no diversity of opinion whatever. 
M c Comas and Thompson are inclined to the views I expressed 
to you in my last, and are willing to go into the contest at once. 
Such also are the wishes of Judge Wilson, who openly declares 
he will support no other ticket, and I believe Talliaferro, 
though I have had no communication with him. I have remained 
here six weeks, and been able to sound the feelings of a large 
number, not only from the State but from abroad. On the 
whole I see nothing to discourage, much to stimulate us. 
Your friends are firmer than I have yet known them to be; 
and the miserable conduct and weak fetches at reform of the 
Administration have greatly tended to disgust the Country 
and turn the eyes of thinking men towards you. The Whig 
Party, too, is destined to add to our strength, partly from 
ultraism of its Leaders at the North, and partly from having 
lost its most cherished head. It must disband. The change 
of leaders always tends to division, and more especially when 
a favourite is to be supplanted. Clay has been on here no 
doubt for the purpose of rallying his friends and saving him- 
self from being thrown over board. His confidence was 
strong when he went on to the W'hite Sulphur; but he was, 
(as I was fully assured) miserably disappointed. Tired of 
fighting under a leader so often defeated, the managers of the 
Party had resolved to raise the banner of another. His travel- 
ling companion, Maj. Tilford, gave me to understand so much; 
and, indeed, Clay's fallen countenance and sad forebodings of 
the future, told, in very intelligible language, that his hopes 
were gone. He conversed with me in quite a friendly way, 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1053 

and spoke kindly of you, as did also Maj. Tilford, who pub- 
licly declared, as I understand, that he went for you after 
M r . Clay. This feeling will not be confined to him. Many 
disappointed in their first choice, will follow in the same 
course. M c Lean, who is to be the Candidate, will be unable 
to rally the Party. I hear that Stevenson at the White Sul- 
phur, as well as two or three others of the old clique, have 
been speaking quite favourably of you. This, however, may 
be but hollow seeming. On the whole I think, without some 
untoward circumstance, we shall carry the State Rights Flag 
triumphantly in the State. The Tariff question, I fear, may 
be used to prejudice us. Some such arrangement as that of 
M c Lane's bill in 1832, may probably be resorted to more for 
the purpose of acting on your State than of settling the ques- 
tion. Walker will probably push it at you, in order to further 
the views of Dallas, or even Wright or himself. If they can 
drive S. Carolina into Nullification, they will give you, as they 
expect the coup de grace. Such I fear is the scheme. Entre 
nous, I am told that M r . Rhett declared at the Salt Sulphur 
that if the Tariff was not brought down to the Revenue stand- 
ard at once, the State would nullify, and that if } T OU did not 
go to the full with them they would throw }^ou over board. 
Such I was told by some gentleman here was the purport of 
his remarks. 

I am disposed, on a full view of the whole matter, to accede 
to the views of Seddon, and to wait the events of the next 
session; though not clear that the present time is the most 
unfavourable. We shall not lose, however, by the delay, as 
there will be time enough to organize after the Spring. All 
that I desired to guard against was the falling of our friends 
into the [word missing] snare. This I believe may not now 
be apprehended and en passant, allow me to caution you 
against writing on the subject but in the most confidential 
way, and to friends not only true but discreet. Your letter to 
Elmore was forwarded to Seddon and Scott, and seen by both. 
Now Scott is as true and warm a friend as any in the Union, 
but he is not discreet. Ritchie, I am told, can worm anything 
out of him. For this reason I did not allow him to know the 
contents of your letter to me. Seddon is quite the reverse, 
and you can communicate with him freely. I suppose M r . 



1054 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Elmore is not well acquainted with our friend S. This, of 
course, is between us. 

I shall leave this the day after tomorrow for Lynchburg; 
having been detained by surveying a tract of land which I 
have purchased in the neighborhood, and will settle this 
winter. I am sorry to hear that Miss Cornelia was so little 
improved by her Physicians in Philadelphia, tho' I was by no 
means sanguine. To her and to M rs . Calhoun, Bettie joins me 
in offering the kindest regards, as well as to yourself. She is 
somewhat improved tho' still delicate. The next summer will 
be passed at our farm here; and she will natter herself that 
she will have the company of yourself and family. I cannot 
but unite with her in the hope. 

With high regard and affection I am truly yours

From Duff Green. c. c. 

Washington. Sep r . M th . 1845 

MY DEAR SIR I am met at every corner with the enquiry 
of whether you will come to the senate. I do not know that 
my opinion will haA^e any influence and I may be deemed 
impertinent but I venture to give you a few suggestions. 

I believe that M r Polk really feels pledged to exert his influ- 
ence to reduce the tariff to the revenue standard, and to estab- 
lish the Subtreasury and that he intends to fulfil his pledges in 
good faith. But this is more than I can say for all those who 
are about him. 

I believe that Ritchie would sell the democratic party and 
Virginia too for the public printing and I have no doubt that 
he is laboring to get up a coalition with Benton for that pur- 
pose, and that Benton's object is to bring M c Dower into the 
senate, when with Bagby, Allen, Fairfield, and Dix, and the 
chances for the senators from N Hampshire Indiana and Ten- 
nessee he will be disposed to set up for himself and by throw- 
ing himself between you and the administration assume the 
control of the Government. 

My belief is that if you come to the senate you will find 
the President sincerely your friend, and that the fact of your 
coming, especially if you are here at the commencement <** 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1055 

the session, will enable your friends to control the elections 
in Virginia and to give the printing of the Senate to the Con- 
stitution and the House to Ritchie, that the publication of 
M c Kensie's book 1 in which he gives the Confidential Corre- 
spondence -of the Albany Regency will create a crisis that 
will induce the party to rally on you as the only means of 
saving the party, but to do this you must be here. 

I saw Hannegan of Indiana yesterday. He says that the 
West will be united and will demand funds for the improve- 
ments of their harbours, rivers and the Cumberland road, and 
the graduation of the price of the public land, and that if the 
South will give these to the West the West will go with the 
South on the tariff. This is Benton's card. I write that you 
may understand it. 

M c Kensie's book discloses a mass of corrupt intrigues the 
equal to which has not been before disclosed in this country, 
and the contrast with your public life will endear you to the 
country. 

The foolish declaration in the " Union" that the President 
wishes to use your friends to elect his end upon, will react on 
Ritchie and force him into an early declaration that he prefers 
you to all others, if you are here to control your friends. 

I have seen the correspondent of the Charleston Mercury 
and he has promised me that he will be on his guard and 
always bear in mind that Benton's object is to throw himself 
between you and the administration. I have been a looker on 
and gratified to see this controversy, take a turn that will, as 
I hope, defeat the purposes which Benton has in View, and 
can see that if treated with judgment b}^ the Mercury, it will 
prevent the mischief which the coalition with Benton would 
otherwise have done. The coalition with Benton is so infam- 
ous that Ritchie will be compelled to deny it in terms that will 
do Benton injury and the public mind being aroused will see 
and condemn any attempt to execute the purposes which 
Benton had in View. 

We are anxious to hear from M rs Calhoun, as the last 
accounts said she was very ill. M rs Green and Eliza wish to 
be affectionately remembered to M rs Calhoun and Cornelia. 
Your sincere friend DUFF GREEN

From H. W. Conner. c. c. 

Charleston Sept r 281845 

MY DEAR SIR I have just returned from New York where I 
have spent the last month 

The people there, without exception as to party are ex- 
tremely desirous of seeing and communicating with you per- 
sonally and it does seem to me that there are reasons more 
numerous and powerful at the present time to induce you to 
do so than at any former period and with all possible defer- 
ence to your better knowledge and experience I now venture 
to recommend your visiting the city of New York and Boston 
and stopping at Richmond in Virginia on your return you 
will understand my motive better when I state my reasons. 

There is at this time a complete breaking up and disorganiza- 
tion of old combinations and machinery of party. There is 
no principle of cohesion amongst them except the common 
love of plunder and so -corrupt have the politicians of both 
parties become that they dare not confide long enough in each 
other even to commit an act of party pillage The truth is 
both parties are tired of their own leaders and party practices 
and are ripe for a reorganization upon better principles and 
upon better men if they had them. Towards yourself there 
is a feeling of confidence both as regards your personal char- 
acter and political principles that surpasses that of all other 
men and it is not confined to our party alone. It is common 
to both in fact it is nearly universal, your putting yourself 
into easy and familiar personal intercourse with the people 
generally at this particular time would in my opinion lead to 
a reorganization of the democratic party in New York upon 
sounder principles and with more elevated views than has 
heretofore been the case, and which would result in maintain- 
ing and preserving the the ascendancy of the party, without 
which defeat would be the consequence, you would serve as 
a neuclus around which would rally the better and greater 
part of the democratic party with a considerable body of 
the whig party many of whom have been forced into the 
whig ranks from a dread of the disorganizing and levelling 
tendencies of some of the ultra doctrines of the ultras of the 
party. This is one reason requiring you, as I conceive, to 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1057 

visit New York and it has for its object the general good of 
the Country and the party. 

In addition to this I perceived I think a decided change 
coming over the minds of the people upon the subject of the 
Tarriff and abolition questions The free trade principles have 
evidently gained ground from the late movements in England 
as well as from a better understanding of the subject and the 
minds of very many heretofore decidedly Tarriff are a good 
deal unsettled latterly, particularly amongst the manufac- 
turers themselves while as regards abolition, the opinion is 
becoming settled that the two races cannot exist together 
except in subjection, one to the other, and that it is philan- 
thropy misapplied to attempt to interfere with the subject of 
Slavery. The public mind to the North is in a condition now 
to be shaped and directed by your personal intercourse with 
the people there, in such a way I think as to ensure the modi- 
fication of the Tarriff and peace upon the subject of abolition, 
except from the Fanatics alone. The deep and abiding inter- 
est which the South has in these two questions furnishes abun- 
dant reason to recommend your visit to New York, for these 
objects alone. 

There is another reason personal to yourself and on that 
account held by you as very secondary in comparison to the 
other public considerations yet should surely not be without 
its weight. 1 allude to your position before the public in 
reference to the Next Presidency. It appears to me you are 
the only man upon whom all that portion of the party who 
look to the good of the Country can unite. If this be so it 
appears to me it is a duty you owe the people to give them an 
opportunity of seeing and knowing you personally. In New 
York the desire to see and hold communion with you is so 
great that your withholding yourself from them has been 
viewed almost with resentment. They begin to think you 
have no feelings or sympathy in common with the people 
altho all your acts and speeches go to prove the contrary. 
The present condition of things in New York renders it pecu- 
liarly desirable that you should go amongst them talk with 
them hear them talk and explain yourself in your usual free 
happy way to them. The feeling already is strong and pow- 
erful in your favour particularly amongst the young democ- 
HIST 99 VOL ii 67 



1058 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

racy but a personal intercourse with them would ripen the 
feeling into a confidence and enthusiasm that no selfish or 
designing combination of corrupt partizans could ever remove. 

I have spoken of the present time as favourable for the visit. 
I mean before the meeting of Congress after that time cir- 
cumstances may have been changed and the occasion in a great 
measure lost. 

If you preferd to go by invitation the slightest intimation 
from any quarter that you could be induced to go would bring 
instantly the warmest kind of an invitation. My impression 
is that an informal visit is preferable. I should be glad to 
know your views. 

I sent you by fridays mail "The life and correspondence of 
B F Butler and Jesse Hoyt late Collector of New York". It 
is in fact the private history of the politics of N York for the 
last 10 or 20 years. It contains details of a system that you 
have known to be in operation amongst that class of politicians 
for many years

MY DEAR SIR: Your esteemed favor of the 30. August in 
consequence from my absence from home did not reach me 
until last Saturday. ^1 have read D r Caminero's letter 1 which 
is herewith returned, and full} 7 concur with you in the policy 
of recognizing the independence of the Dominican Republic 
should M r Hogan's report satisfactorily establish the fact of 
its perfect ability to maintain itself against the Haytien gov*. 
and people. The experiment which the blacks have made of 
governing themselves has resulted in bloodshed and anarchy, 
and the most fertile Island in the world is almost converted 
into a waste. Apart from the considerations adverted to by 
D r Caminero, this would constitute with me a sufficient reason 
for desiring to see the Dominican Republic free and inde-

pendent. But My D r Sir I do not feel myself warranted as 
the Doctor would seem to desire, in urging upon M r Polk the 
adoption of any particular policy. I must content myself 
with the reflection that we have through the labors of M r 
Hogan placed him in possession of all necessary information 
on the subject. To volunteer to him an opinion might be 
considered as going too far. The Settlement of the Texas 
question fills me, I declare to you, with a pleasure greater 
than I can express not so much from the fact that the finish- 
ing hand was put to it by my administration, as from the 
consequences, incalculably great, which are to flow from it. 
Nor can 1 ever forget the important aid which you afforded 
me in all that related to it after your .accession to my Cabinet. 
I called you from a retirement which it pained you to leave 
to assist me properly to adjust the important matters which 
then occupied me, and in the spirit of a true and lofty patri- 
otism you answered the call satisfactorily, and to say nothing 
of other matters the Country will long have cause to rejoice 
in the great measure which our conjoint labours assisted by 
those of able and patriotic associates enabled us to consummate. 
I never doubted the wisdom of the prompt decision in favour 
of the House-resolution. A mere feeling of courtesy to my 
successor could alone cause a moments hesitation and that was 
easily gotten over. The doubt arising from a new organiza- 
tion of the Cabinet and a knowledge of the extreme solicitude 
of the British gov*., plainly indicated the policy of leaving 
nothing undone that could be done. 

I left the gov*. with but one wish remaining unfulfilled, and 
that related to the Oregon Question. I wished you to termi- 
nate that negociation. I entered upon it with reluctance 
believing that under the convention of joint occupation we 
stood on the most favourable footing. Our population was 
already finding its way to the shores of the Pacific, and a few 
years would see an American Settlement on the Columbia 
sufficiently strong to defend itself and to protect the rights 
of the U. States to the territory. 

Aberdeen however expressed in some despatch a regret that- 
that matter remained open, and the Treaty of Washington 
was assailed by Mr Benton and others upon that ground and 
finally a clamour was raised in relation to the Subject through- 



1060 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

out the country, which was loudest in the west, and nothing 
seemed to remain but that negotiation should be attempted. 
With Prudence and fortitude on the part of the administra- 
tion my hope is that it may result in an amicable termination 
but it requires firmness to do what is right on the part of 
those in power. What their views may be concerning it, I 
have no means of ascertaining. With England a mere point 
of honor is involved which she will go to war upon if urged 
to that extremity, but peace with us is so important to her, 
that she will be ready to make concessions in order to secure 
it. if however it be the intention of M 1 ' Polk to make no 
concessions, he should without delay demand of Mexico an 
explanation of her ultimate intentions, while he procrastinates 
the negociation with Great Britain. But my hope is that wise 
councils will prevail, and that an actual collision with Great 
Britain will be avoided. 

I give my attention but little to public affairs and am devot- 
ing myself to the cultivation of my farm. The turmoil 
through which I have passed serves only the more to render 
acceptable my present repose. Should you ever pass near my 
residence it would give me the truest pleasure to receive you 
within my doors. 

M rs . Tyler desires to be remembered to Mrs Calhoun to 
whom present my best respects, and for yourself accept sin- 
cere assurances of my regard.

MY DEAR SIR I cannot sufficiently express my regret at 
any misconstruction I may have placed on your letter of the 
23 Sept. Your language was "I expect to be on a visit to 
my sons in Alabama at the time, and if I could with propriety, 
I would make it a point to attend." Now any scruples, which 
you may have had of going to such a convention 1 as a Volun- 
teer, it seems to me are removed and with "great propriety" 
by the invitation sent direct by those who made the Call; and

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1061 

by the particular request of this State that you should attend 
to represent her interest on the leading questions which will 
form the Subjects of action at Memphis. Your presence 
would be very important to your Native State, and to all 
those projects in which she has so deep a stake. We are on 
the eve of realizing all the fond hopes and expectations of 
1836: and this is not the time for our strong and leading men 
to falter. I have toiled: as much if not more so on these 
matters. I have very nearly sacrificed myself in the Cause, 
and to be left alone at the time I need most encouragement; 
and the strongest backers is cruel. I do not know of more 
than 6 or 8 of our Delegation that will go from this City. 
We made our appointments from the Class that we thought 
would attend and most of them are begging off. If I go it 
will be at great sacrifice and 1 certainly will not go if you, 
Elmore and King Back out. King is lukewarm cold pre- 
tends he has not been invited &c and so it is. the laboring oar 
is to [be] left on the hands of one who has not the power to 
use it. 

But I come now to the subject which seems to have given 
you some very false scruples on the matter. Whatever may 
be the designs of Friends of .Reform and Free Trade Your 
Name is not at present before the American People, and as 
much as I appreciate the motives of those who abstain from 
seeking high Elevation, yet those who are the Exponents of 
the Great Political Truths we wish to propogate, and the 
Reform we desire to effect, must go and be heard by those on 
whom it is absolutely necessary to operate. So long as the 
People are not reached directly; so long as an intermediate 
power by Organization and false pretences can deceive these 
People, so long will we, the Advocates of Truth and honesty, 
fail. The People must be reached directly. Caucus and 
Conventions, the packed juries of Van Burenism must .be 
exposed and put down. I am not afraid of our Cause if the 
People can hear us. It is the Cause of equal rights, and of 
unrestricted American industry, and if we could only be 
heard, Van Burenism with all its selfishness, and duplicity 
would be swept into nought. But to do so to have this

must put your Shoulder to the Wheel. The Time was never

more propitious for a happy Revolution For the formation 
of new Parties or rather the bringing back of Democracy to 
its simplicity and honesty. To free it from the snears into 
which it has been deluded by Conventions and to make it 
stand erect as speaking the honest and voice of the People 
I have for years yielded to the views of my friends and have 
for years been cooperating with them : with the perfect con- 
viction of defeat. My letters to you have spoken unre- 
servedly my views. I know I am right I have not seen 
a true Democrat North, who has not [felt] what I have long 
preached: that there is no coalescing with the Northern 
Democracy. You must shake them off unless you are dis- 
posed again and again to be reached and to be placed in a false 
position. Now is the time to do it. Now is the time to meet 
our Western friends at Memphis to set the ball in motion 
which must bring the Valley to the South: and make them

interests instead of the Tax gathering and Monopolizing 
interests of the North. I shall expect to see You at Memphis.

Lemishire Springs Oct 10, 1845. 

MY DEAR SIR The last mail brings me a letter from Gov. 
Aikin appointing me one of the Delegates for the State at Large 
to a Rail Road Convention at Memphis to assemble the 12 th 
nov. next. A letter from a friend also informs me that 3 r ou 
are the other. I am not a little rejoiced at this movement in 
all its aspects except as to myself, for it is out of my power 
to ^o. My affairs here will engross me intirely until 1 am 
compelled to go to Charleston to prepare for the Session. It 
would be disastrous to me to leave them as they now are. But 
you I most ardently hope can and will go. In all respects it 
will be most important that you do. You have been too much 
secluded from the people. They have an inexpressible anx- 
iety to see and know you and on such an occasion as this, 
where so much may be done to advance Southern interests, to 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1063 

form and consolidate a right sentiment, to unite our Section 
upon the right policy and principles on which to place their 
destinies, it would be a sad oversight I think to decline, if you 
can possibly go. The work in hand, is itself, aside from these 
considerations, one of the greatest moment. I think more of 
good would result to South Carolina from its accomplishment 
than from any ever yet projected. A Rail Road Communica- 
tion based at Memphis in a slave region and extended direct 
to Charleston, passing through the most Martial portion of 
our people and who have, as at present situated, the least 
interest of all the South in Slavery, would render their rela- 
tions with us at Charleston and Memphis so intimate and 
advantageous, that their interests and ours would be indissol- 
ubly united. They would be to us a source of strength power 
and safety and render the South invulnerable. The influence 
of free intercourse could not be otherwise than happy and use- 
ful. The value of the trade I do not believe could be now 
estimated, and it would make the stocks of our Rail Road like 
the Shares in the Bank of England, almost without price as 
the means of computing values in an enterprize to whose 
gains every moment is adding. 

The call upon you from the public to go and attend to their 
welfare is one too which takes from the occasion all ground 
of imputation. It is a public duty and to be done at the 
instance and for the benefit of your State and the Country at 
large It is fitting that when a scheme of such grandeur and 
importance to the South is to be perfected and brought before 
the Country, that one who has served it so long, so faithfully 
and so ably should participate in the measure which, if guided 
aright, will be the most useful of any ever projected for us. ... 
Very truly

MY DEAR SIR, As it has been stated in the newspapers that 
you would probably resume your seat in the Senate, I beg

law, had represented the United States in Denmark and Prussia since 1827. 



1064 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

leave to call your attention to a subject in which the public 
interests, as well as what is due to yourself and me as public 
servants, are deeply concerned. I have always considered 
that great injustice was done me in taking off the injunction 
of secrecy from the proceedings of the Senate, so far as 
respected the Report of the Committee of Foreign Affairs 
upon the Zollverein treaty, whilst the injunction was continued 
as to my Despatches of the 10 and 25 March, 1844, accompa- 
nying the Treaty, and which would have anticipated and met, 
with more or less conclusiveness, the arguments urged by the 
Committee against the ratification. So long as there were 
any reasons connected with the public good for withholding 
the documents from the People, I should have been perfectly 
willing to have submitted to any personal inconvenience that 
might have followed. But now that the Zollverein States 
have declared that they are not willing to wait any longer the 
deliberations of the Senate upon the Treaty, I see no possible 
inconvenience in publishing the correspondence relating to it. 
I have therefore to request that you will have the goodness to 
call for it in the Senate, and have it printed and published. 

In order to have a complete view of the subject, it is nec- 
essary to go back to the origin of the negotiation in the Con- 
ferences at Stuttgard in 1842, the Despatches relating to 
which, you will perceive are intimately connected with our 
Tariff question. I have therefore prepared the enclosed 
list of the Papers which I conceive to be indispensibly neces- 
sary not extracts merely, but the entire despatches with all 
their Enclosures. I have not omitted even my Despatch of the 
25 March, 1844, although it has alread}^ been communicated 
confidentially to the Senate; as it ought to be printed in con- 
nection with the other Documents especially as I presume few 
copies will be found of the former impression. I have care- 
fully read over all the Papers, and can answer for it that 
there is nothing in them, the publication of which can preju- 
dice the public interests. The unanswerable argument con- 
tained in your Despatch of the 28 June 1844 will amply supply 
any defects in the views I have taken by anticipation of the 
constitutional difficulty raised by the Committee of the Senate. 
The Zollverein States are not disposed, at present, to revive 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 1065 

the negotiation on the basis of the former Treaty, as they 
expect to obtain, in the revision of our Tariff by Congress, 
reductions in favour of their manufactures, without conceding 
any equivalent reductions in favour of our agricultural staples; 
and should this be the result of the deliberations of Congress, 
it will be seen that a golden opportunity has been lost, in not 
obtaining such equivalents for reduction, which we shall have 
been compelled to make gratuitously in order to get rid of an 
exager rated Tariff. 

We have not yet received the President's message at the 
opening of Congress, but I shall look with intense interest 
for the result of your deliberations, on the present state of 
our relations with G. Britain, respecting which I have no 
other information than what is contained in the newspapers. 
But so far as I am able to judge from the means of informa- 
tion which are equally open to the whole world, I still continue 
to think that " the wise and masterly delay" referred to in 
your Speech on the Ashburton treaty, continues still to be 
our true policy in respect to the Oregon question. But as I 
do not know how far the position of that question may have 
been changed by what has passed between the two Govern- 
ments during the negotiations of the two last years, this 
opinion is, of course, subject to such qualifications as may 
result from the Paper, which will doubtless be communicated 
to Congress. 

I am, my dear Sir, ever truly your obliged friend

timents of a very large majority of our business men. We 
feel much alarmed by the illtimed and imprudent course of

Subsequently he was several times mayor of New York and representative in Congress. 
He was preeminently distinguished as a political manipulator.

Cass and Allen. 1 We can see no necessity for forcing the 
country into a position from which there is no retreat and 
which makes war inevitable. We say do us justice on the 
Tariff question and Englands ministry cannot be sustained by 
her people in hostilities on account of Oregon. Her people 
will think that the interests of the Hudson Bay Company are 
not paramount to those of her starving populace. 

I need not add, all eyes are turned on you! Twent % y times 
a day I am asked "What course will the great Calhoun take 
on the Oregon question ? " 

Politicians of all parties look for your sagacity experience 
and far seeing wisdom to stand between the great interests of 
the country, and the Hotspurs who in a spirit of demagogism 
would destroy us as they have themselves. 

We know that even popular sentiment cannot drive you 
from a position which in your heart you deem to be correct 
and we also know that in your estimation the loud declamation 
of adventurers is not to be heeded when the calm, silent 
opinions of the industrious and producing classes is antago- 
nistic to them. 

My dear Sir as a friend allow me to recommend that in 
your course on this great and at present excitable question 
that you let the impetuous patriots who are bidding for the 
war party have "their say" for be assured "they have their 
day" now! 

Moderation silence and caution on your part will in a few 
months, when peaceful relations are restored and public sen- 
timent sees its present folly; place you on higher ground than 
any living man can attain in this country. Excuse me when 
I add that J. C. Calhoun needs but to stand still and as sure as 
the day comes, so sure will '49 see him where his deserts long 
since should have placed him viz the chief magistrate of the 
Confederacy. Your course in 1812 established fully your 
reputation as an advocate for war, when good cause called for 
it. No man can or does doubt your patriotism. It needs 
therefore no endorsement, or reitteration. 

The great speech on this Oregon question in which "mas- 
terly inactivity" was recommended lives in our hearts and is 
our position.

MY DEAR SIR As it appears to me, that in the present 
aspect of our affairs with Great Britain, the only alternatives 
that remain are to maintain our rights by arms or to submit 
them to the decision of some friendly power; and perceiving 
that the latter is repudiated by our friends on the ground 
that the monarchs of Europe are prejudiced against us and 
will not deal fairly with us I have thought it might be in the 
interest of peace to intimate my belief, that the court of 
Russia might be safely trusted with the settlement of this 
question. The Emperor Alexander frequently spoke to me 
on this subject. He advocated our claim to the 54 and pro- 
posed to enter into a treaty of mutual guarantee of the pos- 
sessions of Russia and the United States to that limit. These 
proposals I submitted to M r Madison and M r Munroe but our 
possessions on the north west coast did not excite much inter- 
est at that period. It is true they were made prior to the 
treaties concluded with Russia .by the United States and 
Great Britain which secured those possessions to the former; 
but the policy of that power is unvarying and no doubt the 
views entertained by that government at that time are 
recorded in their college of foreign affairs and would govern 
its' decision. 

I have the honor to remain very respectfully

observations which I have been able to make since my return 
here, respecting the natural resources and elements of pros- 
perity of this Country. After all my detention and troubles 
in Mexico I arrived, here on the 7 th of August and found all 
things in my Establishment to my perfect satisfaction; and 
after making such arrangements as were necesary at this 
place, I proceeded to the Pueblo de los Angeles for the pur- 
pose of instituting an examination respecting the richness of 
the Gold Placer existing near that place. This examination 
occupied me something more than two months, and resulted 
in showing the Gold washing not to be so good and profitable 
as I anticipated. There is gold dust to be found over a large 
tract of country in the vicinity of the Angeles, and also as I 
am informed, in many other parts of the Coast; and in some 
spots of small extent, it has been found very rich; so that 
some of the operatives made great wages for a short time in 
washing and faning out the gold dust, and the statements of 
these few have made a great noise in the Country; while 
many others have worked equally hard for months together 
and found nothing; or, in some cases, barely made a living. 
There can be no doubt however, that there is a immense quan- 
tity of gold and other rich metals in the country; for, in search- 
ing after some spots that might be rich enough in gold to pay 
well for washing; I have found various silver, gold and cop- 
per mines, which appear to be very rich, and are so situated 
as to be easily worked. As I have no means of essaying them 
here, I have sent samples of the ores to the City of Mexico to 
ascertain their value, and am now waiting the results. I have 
found in several places an abundant supply of rich iron Ore, 
which, so far as I can judge appears to contain a large per:- 
Centage of silver, and some of the veins are near the Sea 
Shore. 1 have also discovered a rich antimonial ore, which 
probably also contains plent} r of silver; and the best indica- 
tions of extensive bituminous coal mines exist here in all direc- 
tions. Lead and quicksilver also, undoubtedly exist in the 
Country in abundance. They have already commenced work- 
ing a rich copper mine within a mile of a good ship harbor on 
this Coast, and I have no doubt that many others could be 
found in that vicinity. We only want the Flag of the U. S. 
and a good lot of Yankees, and you would soon see the im- 






LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1069 

mense natural riches of the Country developed and her com- 
merce in a flourishing condition. To see that Flag planted 
here would be most Acceptable to the Sons of Uncle Sam, and 
by no means repugnant to the native population. This, like 
the general government of Mexico is very unstable and the 
property of foreigners cannot by any means be considered 
secure. We hope and trust that on this Account as also to 
protect the trade and th*e interests of our Citizens residing 
here with their property, at least one American Ship of Wai- 
will be kept Cruising on the Coast. 

The soil of the Coast is rich and fertile, and with this Cli- 
mate of almost perpetual summer, it affords immense advan- 
tages for grazing and agriculture. The Cultivation of the 
grape is fast increasing and the this years crop is uncommonly 
tine. The licor and wine manufactured from the grape grown 
here will Soon Compete in quality with the best European, and 
may become an Article of export. A few have Commenced 
the Cotton planting, which has been found to yield uncom- 
monly well. 

From the Accounts from Mexico we have been expecting a 
war between the U. S. and that republic, but from So long 
delay, we now begin to think it will blow over with a paper 
war. 

Since my return to this Country my Steam Mills have gone 
on well and are now in full operation. The emigrants who 
left the U. S. last Spring have arrived on this frontier to the 
number, as is reported of nearly one thousand. 

For the best of reasons, as we are here within the power of 
the Mexican Government, you will please to Consider this 
letter Strictly private and Confidential. 

I have Dear Sir the distinguished honor to remain 
Yours most truly and respectfully.

From Henry Wlieaton. c. c. 

Berlin, 26 Jan. 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, I had the pleasure to write you on the 24 
Dec. suggesting the expediency of your calling for the cor- 
respondence respecting the Zollverein treaty in order that it 



1070 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

may be pvibHshed, and justice may be done us respecting the 
motives and grounds on which that negotiation proceeded. 

I have seen with the greatest satisfaction the manly stand 
taken by you in the Senate in favour of an honorable arrange- 
ment of our disputes with G Britain respecting the Oregon 
territory. If we escape as I trust we shall, the calamities 
of an unnecessary war, the most enlightened and virtuous por- 
tion of your countrymen will cer{ainly attribute it mainly 
to your patriotic exertions. No official station to which you 
could be raised by the suffrages of your fellow citizens would 
give you a higher place in their affections, or enable you to 
render a greater service to the Country. 

I think it due to the friendship with which you have so long 
honored me to state confidentially that having received some 
time since an intimation from M r Buchanan that the President 
had determined to send a new Minister to Berlin in the course 
of the present Session of the Senate, which determination was 
communicated to me in such a way as left me no other alter- 
native but to ask for my recall, I have accordingly done so, 
and expect to receive it in the month of April. I cannot 
help thinking that if I had been supported in the prefer quar- 
ter, the President would not have taken this step. But whether 
it is now too late for him to retrace it, I do not know; or 
whether he would be disposed to do so, if he knew that I was 
a friend of yours. But I thought it right to let you know that 
although I have nothing to complain of as to the manner in 
which this measure was adopted and intimated to me, yet it 
will be attended with very great personal inconvenience, with- 
[out] any adequate correspondent advantage, that I can perceive, 
to the public or the party. M r Buchanan states to me that it 
has been taken in pursuance of a supposed rule limiting all for- 
'eign missions to the term of four years. The best proof that 
no such rule exists, or at least that cases of peculiar aptitude 
for the diplomatic service have been considered as excep- 
tions to it, will be found in the fact of my having been em- 
ployed in this mission more than twice that length of time, 
during which it is admitted that I have performed my duties 
' ; with distinguished zeal and ability" to make use of M r B's 
own words. But what I have to complain of is, that I had 
not sooner been informed that it was meant to apply this 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1071 

asserted rule to my case. Had this been done, as it might 
have been immediately on the formation of the present 
Administration I should have received the appointment of 
Professor of Law in the University of Cambridge vacant by 
the death of Judge Story. But as my friends could not learn 
on enquiry at Washington that there was any intention of 
recalling me, they were not able to answer for my accepting 
the vacant chair at Cambridge, and as there was a necessity 
for filling it almost immediately it was impossible to wait 
until "my determination could be known. 

Under these circumstances I should be very glad to learn 
whether the President may not perhaps still be disposed to avail 
the public of my diplomatic services in some other mission. 
I understand that both the missions to Paris and London will 
be vacated in the course of the present year, in which case an 
opportunity would be afforded for that purpose. I write to 
no other person but you on the subject, because Tknow that 
it is only through your powerful interposition that I can hope 
still to continue in my present line of employment. 

Apologizing for troubling you so often on my personal con- 
cerns, I remain ever, my dear Sir, truly your obliged friend,

From, Henry Wheaton. c. c. 

London, Fet}. 10, 1846 

DEAR SIR, When I last wrote you I did not expect to have 
an occasion to address you from here. But haveing no business 
on hand, I left Berlin a few days since to make a visit to my 
family at Paris, intending to return to my post very soon, 
there to await the arrival of my successor who is expected in 
the latter part of April. 

Since I have been here I have availed myself of frequent 
opportunities of intercourse with leading personages, of all 
parties and in various positions, to ascertain the prevailing 
impressions with regard to our differences with this Country, 
and I have been very happy to find even a more conciliatory 
and pacific spirit prevailing than 1 expected to perceive. I 
believe the subject is beginning to be understood in all its. 



1072 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

bearings, and that neither the Govt nor the People are dis- 
posed to push matters to extremities unless it should be made 
necessary by some provocation on our part, and I do not 
believe that the passage of a joint resolution authorizing the 
President to notify the expiration of the Oregon Convention 
would be considered as a measure of hostility. Indeed it 
appears to be very important to the success of the negotiation 
that we should not appear to be a divided Nation, and in my 
conversations 1 have always let it be distinctly understood 
that we shall all stand upon the parallel of 49 as the boundary 
most just, equitable, and convenient for the partition of the 
country, without admitting to them the possibility even of 
some modification, of this basis of adjustment although some 
such appears to be desired here. Still it is universally 
regretted that M r P m 1 should have so peremptorily rejected 
that proposition, and the difficulty now seems to be how to 
correct this error. Our rejection of their counter-proposition 
for a reference will not, I fear, help us in public opinion here, 
but it will do no harm if the two Governments will set about 
in earnest to treat the question as one of boundary to be set- 
tled between them, so as to divide the territory fairly with a 
view to all the circumstances of forts, navigation, &c and to 
the maintainance of peace on the frontier thus established. 

Much mischief has been produced here by the intemperate 
language used in Congress respecting this Country, which 
even our friends do not consider as warranted b}^ the occasion. 
I believe the Govt may be induced to yield the 49th parallel, 
as the basis of boundary with some modifications, but 1 think 
they will require the temporary navigation of the Columbia 
river. The interests existing north of the river are not con- 
sidered here as important, but it is deemed a point of honour 
to maintain them, and that the navigation of the river for a 
term of years is necessary for that purpose until the fur trade 
ceases to exist. In short this is one of the modifications of 
the President's propositions which I think would be desirable 
in order to render the concession more palatable to the Nation. 
I repeat that there is a sincere desire for peace with us, and no 
exagerrated notion of the value of the Country to them; but

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1073 

a strong determination not to yield to threats, and a strong- 
feeling of their tremendous power of annoying us. Indeed 
they would also be a united nation, if war should be the result 
of a rejection on our part of what the civilized world would 
consider as fair terms of compromise. The great movement 
which is going on here in favour of the principles of free 
trade, it is hoped will have a favorable effect in encouraging 
a pacific feeling with us. It opens the prospect of our being 
hereafter more useful to each other than we have ever yet 
been, and I hope will induce both Nations to reflect how much 
more good they can do each other in peace, than they can 
inflict of evil in war if indeed there were any comparison in 
the choice of these so far as the true interest of nations are 
concerned. I have great pleasure in assuring you that your 
efforts as a mediator are duly appreciated here whilst it is well 
known that you are the last man who would yield anything in 
which the rights and honour of our Country were concerned. 
It is not doubted that Sir R. Peel's propositions will be 
carried in the Commons by such a majority as will render 
their rejection by the Lords utterly impossible. 
Truly yours, 

H. W. 



From Duff Green. c. c. 

Trenton. 22 nd . feby. 1846 

MY DEAR SIR Excuse me for making a few suggestions on 
points personal to yourself and which it is important for you 
to treat of in the debate on the resolutions for notice. 

The partisans of Clay and Cass are laboring to Great an 
impression that you are sectional not national; and that your 
support of the annexation of Texas is inconsistent with your 
present Course as to Oregon and attribute it to a desire to 
keep up a "balance of power" between the slave holding and 
non slaveholding states. 

It is important to show that the idea of such a balance of 

power is preposterous, that the slave holding states are now 

and ever must be in a minority, that the South stands on the 

defensive and that the attacks come from both parties at the 

HIST 99 VOL ii 68 



1074 AMEKICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

north, who, knowing that the south are and ever must be in a 
minority agitate the question because the tendency of that 
agitation is to create a sectional northern party organised on 
the basis of placing the Government in the hands of northern 
men. 

Your course in relation to Oregon is the same now as it has 
been heretofore. It is the only course that can secure to us 
the whole of Oregon. 

You were then for immediate annexation of Texas because 
that was the only course to obtain the whole or any part of 
Texas and because the acquisition of Texas was an important 
step in securing our rights in Oregon. 

You are now for "masterly inactivity" in relation to Ore- 
gon, because that is the only means of obtaining the whole of 
Oregon, and in this connection I would meet and denounce 
in the most solemn and decided manner the imputation that 
you have been influenced by any jealousy of the growth or 
political preponderance of the north as such. 

So far from restricting the territory out of which free 
states are to be made your policy would enlarge that Terri- 
tory. This is now the most important part of the whole 
subject. 

If notice is given now that notice will find the English in 
undisputed possession of all the country north of the Colum- 
bia. How are they to be dispossessed ? By force ? If so it 
is war. By negociation? If so will notice strengthen our 
claim or place the question in a shape more favorable to us ? 
It cannot be denied that so far the negociation and the dis- 
cussion have been so conducted on the part of England as to 
throw upon us the Onus in case of war, and at the same time 
to place England in a position that she cannot well be the first 
to resort to hostile measures. 

If we give notice England will take measures to prevent 
settlement north of the Columbia and thus limit our posses- 
sion to the south, whereas if we do not give the notice we can 
take measures to Colonise as far north as 54 40 if we desire 
it, and in a few years possess the whole country without giv- 
ing cause for war. 

If we give notice we must abandon all north of 49, if not 
all north of the Columbia unless we enforce our claim by 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1075 

War. Whereas without notice we can acquire the whole 
country up to 54*. 

This aspect of the question enables you to meet the impu- 
tation of "punic faith" which much as you may despise the 
charge is now the hope of your political enemies. Silence 
that Charge for Charge it is, and you obtain a triumph for 
yourself and for the country which will have a permanent 
influence for good. You have never occupied a more enviable 
position. The eyes of the world are upon you, the hopes of 
the Country rest on you. Millions are prepared to speak 
your praise meet this slander and you give an argument to 
the friends of the Constitution every where that will for a 
long time silence or overwhelm the Abolition movement for 
this Charge is but the political aspect which that question has 
assumed and should be so treated. 

Again the slave holding influence cannot be increased by 
bringing in new slaveholding states that influence depends 
upon the numerical increase of the slaves themselves and not 
upon the acquisition of new territory. 

Again, If there were but 9 instead of 14 slave holding states 
the Jealousy of the majority would Cease. Now political agi- 
tators assert that the[re] is a minority holding equal political 
influence and they make war on a system which gives an 
equality of power to a minority get rid of this idea of a 
"balance of power" by showing that no such balance exists 
and you take from these agitators the foundation on which 
their agitation rests. 

Not having mingled with the masses as I have done you 
cannot understand or appreciate the effect which the studied 
misrepresentation of your views and position in relation to 
this subject has on the public opinion of the North. 

At this moment the great body of the people sympathise 
with you on the Oregon question and the most important 
results will follow the proper use of the present occasion, for 
your speech will find its way into every news paper and be 
read by almost every man in the country capable of reading 
it. What is more to the point they will be in a state of mind 
to be favorably impressed by what you say. All that has 
been said hy others prepares the way for you to take this 
view of the subject and upon your doing so, in my opinion 



1076 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

very much depends your standing and influence with the 
country. 

I would call your attention to the remarks of the London 
Times which you will find in the Herald of the 21 st (yester- 
day), in which they say that war with the United States will 
be popular in England, and there is much force and truth in 
the statement of the reasons for it. 

It is said that the notice 1 will not be considered by England 
as a cause of war or offence. It is even said that England is 
willing that the notice should be given. 

The notice if given strengthens the position of England. It 
leaves her in possession of all north of the Columbia and com- 
pels us to become the aggressor. If we do become the aggres- 
sor, after what has transpired in Parliament and the offer of 
arbitration, we will be divided and England united. The con- 
sequence will be that we must lose the Country north of the 
Columbia. 

Excuse these suggestions. They may have no merit but it 
is the part of friendship to make them. 

yours truly DUFF GREEN

Louis McLane? c. c. 



London 3 March 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, Although I am too enfeebled from a severe 
illness to go into much detail, I continue my correspondence in 
the same confidence as heretofore. 

1 am afraid the state of the Oregon question is more criti- 
cal. It is unfortunate I think that so much opposition should 
have been made to the notice recommended by the President, 
or that [a] move should have been attempted now while authoriz- 
ing the notice, to recommend an adjustment upon an honorable 
basis. If the notice as recommended had been promptly 
authorized, it could have done no harm. The manner in which 
it has been treated on both sides in Congress only could make 



1 Of termination of the agreement with Great Britain respecting the joint occupation 
of Oregon. 

2 Louis McLane, of Maryland (1786-1857), who had been Secretary of the Treasury and 
of State under Jackson, was (for the second time) minister to Great Britain from June, 
1845, to August, 1846, 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1077 

its effect doubtful. Here it would not have been regarded as 
a hostile measure; and while at home it would have deprived 
those who appear to be bent on an ultra course of much ali- 
ment they will now have to get up an excitement in and out of 
Congress, it would have enabled our Government to have pre- 
sented united Councils and an undivided front abroad. A 
year would remain, after notice, for negotiation, and even a 
longer period might be calculated upon; since if, at the end of 
the year, negotiations should be pending, unless one Govern- 
ment should commit some violent or offensive act, we would 
have been in no worse situation than in 1818. I think there 
is reason to apprehend that divided councils at home if they 
do not encourage more extravagant demands from this gov- 
ernment will at least encourage delay, and lead to a waste of 
time which must be ultimately fatal. I yet hope that these 
consequences may be avoided. 

I am afraid too that this Government has been encouraged 
by advices from the U. S. to believe that although the Presi- 
dent has twice rejected proposals to arbitrate, yet, rather than 
lead to war, that mode of settlement will be ultimately adopted 
by our Government, in some form or other. The immediate 
effect of all this has been to suspend, for the present, any fur- 
ther proposition of compromise; and believing as I do that 
arbitration under any circumstances is utterly hopeless, I 
deepty lament that attempts should have been made to mislead 
this Gov. upon so vital a point. 

I am sure that there is the best ground to apprehend now, 
that this Government will not be brought to propose or assent 
to a better partition than by a line on the 49 th parallel to the 
strait of Fuca, thence down the middle of the Strait to the 
Pacific, with the right of her navigation of the Columbia, and 
some protection of the present agricultural settlements of 
British subjects north of the Columbia and south of the 49 th 
parallel. It is probable that the navigation of the Columbia 
for 10 or 15 years might be acceptable, and I am quite sure 
that if it turn out that the river is not navigable at the inter- 
section of the 49 th parallel, the right of using it for any period 
would not be insisted upon. 

If the article in the Times of the 3 rd . Jan. (which I sent you) 
ever meant anything, there is certainly at present no intention 



1078 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

to renew or assent to Mr. Gallatin's proposition of 1826-7, and 
I have reason to know that this Government will, under no 
circumstances consent to negotiate for the free navigation of 
the St. Lawrence in connection with the Columbia. I have 
apprehensions that the President is absolutely committed in 
his message against the concession of the navigation of the 
Columbia; and if so and he extends his commitment to exclude 
the privilege even for a few years, the case may be regarded 
as well nigh hopeless. 

I am ardently desirous of peace, if it can be honorably pre- 
served, and am not unwilling to make the concessions indicated 
in my former letters; but it is not to be disputed that our cause 
has been weakened abroad by our divisions at home, by the 
public writers, especially in the North American Review and 
some of the newspapers, and by private letter writers depre- 
ciating and attempting to refute our claims, and holding out 
encouragements to believe that the Executive will be deserted, 
and what is called the War Party will ultimately find no coun- 
tenance. 

If there be a determination not to authorize the notice ac- 
cording to the President's recommendation, would it not be 
advisable to declare immediately that the Senate would not 
advise arbitration; and that unless within a year, or a brief 
period, partition upon a reasonable basis (defining it) should be 
agreed to, then notice should be given ? 

It is only to be expected that as long as there is a hope here 
(and I assure you disencouraged from very respectable quar- 
ters) that arbitration will be ultimately assented to, or that 
there will be a division between the Executive and a majority 
of the Senate, there will be no real desire to do any thing, 
and it may encourage demands which it is impossible we 
could agree to. 1 offer these suggestions to your own reflec- 
tion; being very sure however, that having made up our 
minds for the sake of preserving peace to assent to a reason- 
able basis of partition, we will be most apt to effect even that 
by union and spirit. If ground be afforded to calculate upon 
our divisions we shall not only lose what we ought justly to 
have, but instead of preserving peace we will too surely lead 
to war. 

I send you some newspapers containing Sir Robert Peel's

last peace speech; and you will see how the journal views the 
triumph which, upon the recent division of the house, has 
crowned his exertions. The success of the Measure in the 
Lords was very confidently anticipated, without a dissolution. 
There are to be sure many speculations as to the continuance 
of " a Ministry without a party " after it is all over; and many 
think the day is not distant when by a union between the 
"Protectionists" and the Whigs now supporting the present 
measure, it will be overthrown. I do not fully concur in this 
anticipation. Sir R. Peel is a statesman of too much ability 
and has too broad a foundation in public confidence to be 
easily overthrown. He has honors, the cordial support of the 
Crown, and will ever increase his strength by the advance of 
the popular principle. He may be temporarily embarrassed, 
but his ultimate triumph, like that of " free trade" I regard as 
certain. I am afraid I have already wearied you, especially 
as I am compelled by the condition of my health to write so 
carelessly, and in so desultory a manner. 

I bring my letter to a close, therefore, with the assurance 
of my sincere esteem and regard.

MY DEAR SIR; I have two special friends who leave us this 
afternoon for Washington where they intend to pass a few 
days M r . William H. Prescott the historian and M r . Charles 
Sumner of the legal profession. These gentlemen are both 
well known in the literary world, and as such I have felt that 
they should make your acquaintance. Whatever may be the 
differences between you and myself upon political questions, 
I trust we are both too liberal, to allow mere opinions upon 
National questions to sunder the ties of comity due to each 
other, on those with whom we are associated. I begin how- 
ever, to think that we are coming nearer together upon the 
great questions that now agitate the Country, and I assure 
you with entire frankness that I know not the man in the

From Edward Everett? 

Cambridge (Mass) 6 April 1846. 

DEAR SIR, I received this morning a cop}^ of your speech 
on the Oregon question, 2 which you were good enough to 
send me. 1 had already read it in the Intelligencer with 
extreme satisfaction. It is of itself nearly decisive of the 
great question of peace or war; certainly it is so, when taken 
in connection with more recent demonstrations. I assume, 
of course, that England will be willing to compromise on the 
basis of the 49 degree, which I have no doubt she will, if no 
insuperable difficulty arises in reference to the Navigation of 
the Columbia River. As this river is certainly not navigable 
to the Sea from any place north of the forty ninth degree, I 
am in hopes no serious difficulty will arise on this point; 
because if I recollect aright M r . Gallatin in 1826, only offered 
the navigation of the Columbia, in case it was navigable from 
above that degree. As the great objection alleged by Eng- 
land of late years to accepting the 49 th degree has been that 
they could not now accept what they had three times before 
declined, they may possibly, to save the point of honor, 
insist on reserving the navigation of the Columbia "if navi- 
gable"; and the President has so committed himself on this

point, that he may not be able to make this hypothetical con- 
cession, although certain that the river is not navigable. 
But as this on both sides is mere punctilio, it may be hoped 
there will be common sense enough on the part of the two 
governments to get over it. 

Believing that you have really rendered an inestimable 
service to the Country by your course on this question, I 
wish you could see your way clear, to some equitable com- 
promise between the tariff and the anti-tariff parties. If it is 
possible to be effected, it can only be done by you. Next to 
peace abroad, the Country wants quiet on this subject; and 
the person who should give us that blessing would be a pub- 
lic benefactor of the highest order. 

I hope you will excuse the freedom of these remarks. I 
am wholly withdrawn from politics, especially party politics; 
and look only to the public interest: In reference to which, 
if 1 know myself, I desire the prosperity of the South, as 
much as of the North. 

I remain, Dear Sir, with great regard, faithfully Yours, 

EDWARD EVERETT. 



From Louis McLam. c. c. 

London May 18, 1846 

MY DEAR SIR, In the same confidence with which I have 
hitherto written, I send you a short letter by the present 
Steamer. I received my despatches notice and all, on the 15 th 
inst. but as I had previously made an arrangement with Lord 
Aberdeen for reopening the negotiation by new instructions 
to M r P. 1 by this steamer and as my instructions required me 
to ascertain before presenting the notice, "Her Majesty s 
pleasure as to the mode of delivering it ", it was impossible to 
act under the case immediately. Accordingly a new proposi- 
tion for the partition for the Oregon will go to M r . Packen- 
ham to-morrow; but it will not be exactly such, I lament to 
say, as to afford me any great hope that it will be accepted by 
the P. or the Senate. It will propose the 49 th parallel to 
strait of Fuca and thence to the sea giving all- Vancouver's

Island to G. B. It will also confirm to British subjects occu- 
pying land between the Columbia and the 49 th all the land, 
forts and stations of which they are in the actual occupation, 
leaving jurisdiction to U. S; and it will claim the perpetual 
right of freely navigating the Columbia by the Hudson's Bay 
Company. I cannot err in supposing that the belief is enter- 
tained here that the Senate will accept this proposition, and 
that the P. will not take the responsibility of rejecting it 
without consulting the Senate! It is evident that since the 
recent public discussion in the Senate the expectations here 
have risen, and that better terms could I believe have been 
had before. This proposition is encouraged by the reliance I 
have already hinted at upon the Senate; by a calculation that 
the ' ' peace party " as it is called will do as much to preserve 
peace as the "war party" would to make war; by calculation 
founded upon our difficulties with Mexico and upon the sym- 
pathy and support of France and other European Nations; 
and last, and I fear not least, an expectation that the present 
ministry may very soon quit office, and a desire to appear 
while in to have maintained a strong ground in the negotia- 
tion with us, may not be without its influence. 

1 am confident, however, that the offer is not made as an 
ultimatum, and that it is not intended as such. Indeed Lord 
A. was as explicit as he could be upon such a point in such a 
crisis. I believe, moreover, that if he were sure that the Sen- 
ate would require a modification as to the navigation of the 
Columbia by limiting it to a period of years, and that were 
the only point it would be conceded here. Their objection I 
rather think is to offering it with the belief that the present 
offer will be unobjectionable 'to the Senate without it. They 
will accept it I think if offered, i. e. if it come before a change 
of ministry. I have far less confidence in their disposition to 
assent to any modification of the reservation in favor of their 
subjects occupying lands North of the Columbia and South of 
the 49 th . The protection of them they regard as the real and 
substantial point of honor; and yet the present proposition 
concedes to us substantially very little more than the British 
proposition in 1826-7 excepting the lands unoccupied north 
of [the] Columbia and south of 49, and the Jurisdiction of both 
banks of the Columbia and of the country north of the river 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1083 

and south of 49 ! I should not have despaired of a better 
offer, if it had been distinctly understood that better would 
have been demanded by joint and united councils at home. 
I have given no encouragement to the proposition as presented 
in any form, not even that the P will submit it to the Senate 
for their advice. Though I think after the publicity already 
given to the subject, the Senate ought, according to the early 
practice to be consulted at every step of the negotiation; and 
then if they are united and firm he may get better terms not 
otherwise. 

Believe me to be My dear sir, Mo truly Yrs

From James Gregorie. 

Charleston 23 d May 1846. 

MY DEAR SIR In one of the interviews I had the honour of 
holding with you, two years ago, and which are always ren- 
dered so delightful by you, I stated the existence of a combi- 
nation of persons in the western country for the purpose of 
conquering Mexico, the object of which it appeared to me was 
plunder alone. 

This information becomes of importance now as furnishing 
a key to the warlike measures of the party who have urged us 
into collision with that country. If I am correct in believing 
that this conspiracy is wide spread as the Southwest itself; it 
will be found difficult beyond measure to make peace with a 
country in so distracted and helpless a state, if invasion is 
resorted to, and western volunteers compose the army. If 
plunder was the object held out, to tempt the thoughtless, the 
rash and the abandoned to put their seals to such a bond, 
without knowing who was to be their leaders; what disgrace- 
ful consequences may result to our National character, now 
that war is actually going on and these very volunteers are 
selected by the government and crowding to the scene of 
action ? 

I commit the paper to your confidential keeping, knowing 
that it can only be used by you for the benefit of the country.

family emigrated to the state of Mississippi in 1835 and 36. 
Of these two died from diseases of the climate, a third 
returned to yield up his life on a bed of languishing at home; 
at his side I attended thirty days. Towards the close of this 
scene he stated to me that I should find with his papers, the 
inclosed agreement. He assured me it had been extensively 
signed by many of his acquaintance and all through the West 
none of them knew who were at the head of the band, or with 
whom it had commenced. The solemnity of the occasion pre- 
cluded the suspicion of exaggeration, and the confidence placed 
in me arose from painful misgivings of the correctness of his 
conduct. 

I am about to publish a few papers on a subject deeply 
interesting to Carolina and the South. I have long been of 
opinion, that with due precaution health may be kept on our 
low Country plantations equal to that of the Negroes, for all 
useful purposes. Of course equally well throughout the mid- 
dle country also. When they appear I beg your candid 
opinion of them in a few lines; if you can spare a moment of 
your precious time time not only precious to Carolina and 
the Union, but to the world. 

Your decided conduct on the war vote, has met the appro- 
bation of every one, more un[an]imously here, than anything 
I ever knew. Go on My Dear Sir acting on your own ripe 
judgement and be assured that your example will influence 
every correct mind, high and low, at home and abroad, but 
especially among the Ministry and influential men in Eng- 
land. But I cease, being most faithfully

MY DEAR SIR I was in hopes of receiving a copy of your 
Report 1 in advance but the Mercury has it and has com- 
menced this morning the publication. I am compelled to 
leave the City tomorrow and fear I shall be denied the pleas- 
ure of perusing the document before I return. If 1 had one 
to carry with me I could review its grounds in the Cars. 

The passage of the Tariff has pleased, but not satisfied us. 
Perhaps it was the best terms which could at this crisis be 
got and the doing away with the minimums, and the ad 
valorum duty is a point gained. The Valuation is ambigu- 
ous. Whether on the foreign or home we cannot understand. 
The Bill may be construed either way. The Pennsylvanians 
really seem to control you. If Iron and Coal is to enable 
them to tax at will the whole of the U. S. it is as well that 
we seperate from our Pennsylvania false democracy. 

If the 30 per ct is placed on the home valuation of Iron

the duty will not vary much from the percents specific paid. 
There really ought to be something done for Rail Iron and I

you can certainly remove better than I can his Constitutional

Boston July 14 th 1846. 

MY DEAR SIR, I well know your position in regard to the 
Tariff Bill now before the Senate, and write to you impressed 
with the idea that you desire to put at rest a question that has 
so long divided the Country. I have examined the bill as it 
passed the House of Rep' with care, and assure you if it should 
become a Law, that the people will not sit down quietly under 
its operation. As a financial measure it will not answer the 
expectations or purposes of the Government, and as a measure 
adapted to the present condition of our people, you may be 
quite certain that many, and great interests will suffer to an 
extent that will produce discontent and severe embarrassment 
and loss. Now there are several gentlemen in the Senate who 
have advocated advalorem duties, without discrimination, but 
would avoid doing anything that should produce a violent 
revulsion in the business of the Country, and yet desire to 
maintain themselves with their party. To those I would ask 
the favor of an examination of this bill as a financial measure, 
and upon that ground it may be postponed, till we are in a 
better condition to reduce the revenue. There are most glar- 
ing absurdities in the bill, which should be corrected. It 
appears to me that a bill of so much consequence to the 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1087 

Country should be considered and matured by practical men, 
and that there should be an approach to harmony in its 
provisions. 

I am aware of your position before the Country upon this 
and other great questions of National policy, and I am not 
unmindful of the future. In my humble judgement, the pres- 
ent is not the time to try an experiment on the revenues of 
the Country, and that two thirds of the people of the United 
States would be glad to see this bill defeated in the Senate. 
We are quite ready at a proper time to meet this question in 
a spirit of compromise, and settle it upon such a basis, as will 
insure repose for ten years. On your voice I think the fate 
of this bill depends. I have only to ask you to look at it in 
all its phases, and if you agree with me, that the Revenue 
will be reduced from 5 to 8 millions, and that the bill is very 
imperfect in its character, and that the question is to be made 
again a Presidential question, that you may agree in the policy 
at least of postponing the subject. There appears to be a 
particular hostility to the manufactures of Cotton. Why 
should Cotton goods be admitted at less duty than Woollens. 
Iron and Coal too, are to enjoy a duty of 30 per cent, with a 
heavy freight to be charged, while manufactured Cottons with 
less than per cent freight are to come in at 25 per cent. 

Coarse wool is charged with a duty of 30 per cent while it 
is admitted free of duty in Great Britain, and their blankets 
brought here with a duty of 20 per cent. Pig copper 5 per 
cent, and sheathing copper free, and many, many other fea- 
tures of the bill of the same character. Such a bill cannot 
stand, and 1 have taken the freedom to write to you as I would 
speak to you upon the subject. If 28 millions is obtained 
from this bill annually, it is quite certain that the Country 
will be unable to pay for the importations. If yourself and 
others however are resolved on trying an experiment I can 
only say we must take our chance with you in maintaining 
ourselves as well as we can. I think you have another oppor- 
tunity to make yourself a National man, as you have done in 
the settlement of Oregon. 
I remain Dear Sir 

Very truly your friend and Obt Ser.

Savannah Geo Aug* 12 th 1846. 

Last evenings mail My Dear Sir, brought me your kind 
favor of the 8 th inst, written on the ev'e of your departure 
from Washington. 

That our friends are in high spirits I can readily conceive, 
particularly those, who take as deep an interest as I do in 
your fame and future advancement, for you never occupied 
so proud a position as you do at present, whether you are 
destined to wear the purple or not. 

But I must tell you that of the Democracy as a party, I 
think in the utmost peril. They have tendered so many issues 
during the late Session of Congress, that nothing can possibly 
prevent the Whigs from electing their Man, but the possible 
Union of the independent Men of all parties, constituting, if 
left to themselves, the great body of the people, on you, 
because on some of these trying Questions, you occupy middle 
ground. 

With the tariff, two Veto Messages, Sub Treasury and the 
Mexican War, (with its enormous expences), wantonly pro- 
voked as it is charged, by the Democracy, we have too much 
weight to carry. The Sub Treasury alone killed Van Buren 
in 1840. But how vastly has Polk complicated the difficulties 
of his party ? 

I begin to think such are the follies and perverseness of 
Men that hereafter no party will remain in power, more than 
four Years. Ignorance under our Government is gradually 
gaining on knowledge, and profligacy on moral worth, until I 
believe we shall settle down into one of the most corrupt and 
disgusting Anarchies that ever disgraced the civilized World, 
of which Felix Connell and Sam Houston, may be regarded as 
the personal Exponents. These are gloomy portents, but I 
believe they will prove true, for the influence of virtue and 
Genius, in our Democracy, seems daily to be losing its 
authority. 

I should have some hope, indeed of the Country if it had the 
intelligence and discrimination to place you at the head of 
Affairs. And in spite of these omens, I believe our prospect 
of consummating this blessing, is far more auspicious than 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOtTN. 1089 

ever, if we avail ourselves of the favorable conjunction which 
the difficulties of the Country, in the next two years are 
likely to present. But in the long run I fear we must inscribe 
on the White House this Icibel not libel, (except on the ground 
the greater the truth the great the libel) TJie Temple of Dema- 
gog ism inscribed to tJie Genius of Mediocrity dulness Ignorance 
and Deceit. 

I shall stop for a day or two at Washington on my way to 
New York next week, not to seek an office, but to convince 
Polk, that I am [a] free sjjoken Man, at least as far as I can be so, 
within the verge of civility and that due respect, which belongs 
to his high station. If he does not change the mode of carry- 
ing on the Mexican War which in fact is more properly 
speaking a War against the Treasury of the U. S. , waged ~by 
ourselves, his administration in public confidence will not live 
to see the commencement of the next Session of Congress. 

I need not say that in going North 1 shall exchange the 
sign and token of confraternity with your friends where ever 
I meet them and inculcate the Watchwords of Hope Union 
and energy. I now use no reserve, and I am happy to say, 
that I meet wherever I go with few Men at the South, of

Genius experience and virtue you are better qualified than 
any Man in the United States for the Helm. God grant us, I 
say a victory out of which, a new Lease for the Government 
may be constructed. 

If you should have any suggestions to make, pray drop me 
a line directed to Washington, where I shall be there proba-

and a benef ecent intercourse between two such great nations. 
The admission of Maize duty free into England is calculated 
to confer I believe in the end an incalculable blessing on both 
Countries. It will give to the laboring poor of G. B. a cheap 
and nutritious food and to the South probably a source for 
diverting a portion of our Labor from the cultivation of Cot- 
ton. One of the objects of my visit to the North is to make 
myself thoroughly acquainted with the process of kiln drying 
corn preparatory to its being ground and bolted into Meal. I

MY DEAR SIR. A few moments leisure now, enables me to 
fulfil my promise in writing you a line from this place. 

During my stay in New York I had frequent conferences 
with your friends there, and the conclusion at which I arrived 
was, that your latent strength in the confidence and esteem of 
the intelligent Men of all parties, who were exempt from the 
taint of office holding and office seeking, and from the faction 
of party was far greater than that of any one of the other 
Candidates for the Presidency. 

With the regular hacks of Party, and those who are the 
Creatures and Agents of its organisation, you are the weakest 
of all of them, from considerations highly honorable to your- 
self. There is in the City of New York a standing Committee 
of your friends, called the Calhoun Committee, who are pre- 
pared to move the moment your Southern friends deem it 
politick to do so, either by a public Meeting or by an address, 
to the public, which ever may be deemed most politick. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1091

tain no hope of carrying the vote of the S* of New York for

your receiving the Vote of a majority of States in the House 
of Representatives, where if you hold out and refuse to go 
into convention, it is deemed certain that the election must go. 

They likewise informed me that your friends had been in a 
state of suspense, as to their action, from the uncertainty 
whether you would be a Candidate or whether if you were, 
}^our Southern Supporters would not as they had done fre- 
quently before, strike your Flag, at the last Moment. 

I assured them 1 st That under no circumstances would you 
go into Caucus or Convention with the delegated power to 
others of disposing of your claims or pretensions. If any 
body of Men calling themselves a Congressional Caucus or 
National Convention thought proper to support you, it was 
well, but it would be without a pledge, or commitment on 
your part, either preliminary to the election, or subsequent 
to it. 

2 dly That they might be assured that your Southern friends 
would make you a Candidate, and that we would not lower 
your Flag; That it should be kept flying if but S Carolina 
rallied round it. 

This assurance created great confidence and enthusiasm, and 
the question now is when we had better commence moving 
and how. 

We want a great central Press in the City of New York, 
which we could afterwards transfer to Washington in the 
event of your election as the Organ of your Administration. 
There are many opulent Whigs who are free Traders- in the 
City of New York, who I understand favor your support, who 
might be willing to subscribe liberally, to an able and enlight- 
ened Journal devoted to the Cause of free Trade, and to our 
views in relation to the administration of the Affairs of the 
Country. 

For example, I understand that M r . Dudley Selden 1 hitherto 
a Warm Supporter of M r . Clay's, has now a strong tendency 
to sustain your claims to the Presidency. He has recently

inherited a large Sugar Es*. in the Island of Cuba, which may 
have produced a sensible change in his views in regard to the 
tariff. He proposed a scheme for a public press to a friend 
of mine, on a scale of security usefulness and respectability 
which I considered truly admirable, and which we must en- 
deavor to carry out. 

It is to raise by a joint stock Company in shares of $100 a 
hundred thousand Dollars, that after buying all the fixtures 
necessary to such a press, and six months material in advance, 
to have the residue vested in a secure and productive stock, 
the interests of which was to be held as a reserve fund, to 
meet any deficiency in the subscriptions and advertising Lists 
necessar} 7 to defray the expences of the paper. If the Man 
who should be the exponent of the principles [of] this paper 
should be elected to the Presidency then if deemed necessary 
the Press should be transferred to Washington, as the Gov- 
ernment Journal. In fact, that we should have an independ- 
ent press, that should dare on all Questions to speak out and 
speak the truth. 

The plan in regard to the Stock is very much on the Plan 
of the London Times and I believe after doing an infinity of 
good, in the end, ought to be a six per Cent Stock to the 
shareholders. I think we ought to call it the North Ameri- 
can Times, and that it should have the Banner of Free Trade 
at its Masthead. None but a Man of finished Talents and the 
highest character ought to be the Editor in Chief, whilst 
auxiliary Editors in the different departments of Literature 
and politicks ought to be associated with him. Without com- 
ing out openly in the first instance in your support this should 
seem subsequently as the natural result of events flowing from 
a conformity between your principles, and those advocated 
by the Press itself. I shall write M r . Selden fully on this sub- 
ject, and during the next session of Congress, we must move 
in good earnest to accomplish this great object. 

Whilst in Washington I had a long conversation with the 
President, and found no difficulty in convincing him of the 
peril in which the Democracy was placed, from the number 
of issues which had been tendered by his administration, and 
more especially from the hazards of the Mexican War. I told 
him the existence of his administration depended on the most 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1093 

perfect Union of the party in its support, and that we must 
be aware of what was obvious to every one else, tbat our 
Flank of the Democracy headed by yourself, comprised a 
large proportion of its Talent. That from the course of the 
distribution of his offices and patronages I had entertained 
some doubt whether he cherished friendly feelings towards 
\ T ourself . That if he did not, I wished very frankly to know 
it. He assured me, that the reverse was precisely the case. 
That his feelings towards you were cordial and kind. That 
he cherished for your character the most unbounded respect, 
and for your talents the highest admiration. That if he had 
thrown his patronage in other Quarters, it was because he 
knew we looked more to the principles of his administration, 
than to its faculty of dispensing bounties. He then begged 
me to make you these assurances. And went on to remark 
that your course on the War Bill and Notice had produced in 
his mind not the slightest feeling of unkindness, that he regret- 
ted it, only, as the possible occasion of impairing your just 
influence with the party. The warmth of his manner induced 
me really to believe that he was sincere. Whatever may be 
your own belief, it accords with weighty considerations of 
policy, that you should give him, apparently credit for good 
faith, and where you believe his administration to be right, 
to give it a cordial effective support, for I think the chances 
are quite even that if no rupture takes place between you, 
that you will receive the support as against Wright of a ma- 
jority of his Cabinet to wit, of Walker Mason and Marcy, 
together with the adhesion of the President and Vice Presi- 
dent when cured of some delusions in reference to themselves, 
which time will be very apt to effect. That Buchanan will 
form a coalition with Wright I think certain. It doubtless 
constituted the main object of his recent visit to the North. 
The Oregon Negotiation has killed him, and if he exhibits 
any inconvenient symptoms of vitality M c Lane of Delaware 
(who by the way with his Talented Son is among your warmest 
friends,) is prepared to give him the finishing blow. 

Do not therefore break with the administration, give them 
a liberal and cordial support, where you can, for if they break 
down, either by our instrumental^ or without it, it can only 
inure to the benefit of the Whigs who, in a united Mass will 



1094 AMEKICAN H1STOEICAL ASSOCIATION. 

run that Candidate whom they deem the strongest whether it 
be Clay, Crittenden, M c Lean or Gen. Taylor, on whom they 
will rally on in the last resort rather than lose the victory. 
You see therefore [the] vast importance of Union and as little 
wavering in our ranks as possible. Even if you have the 
administration on the hip, let go your grasp, if it is to bring 
in the federal brood of abominations under the incubation of 
Whiggery; 

I stopped in Richmond on my way on where I saw five or 
six of our leading friends among the most prominent of them, 
Mes srs . Seddon and Scott, whilst they expressed the most 
unhesitating belief that you were the strongest among the 
Democratic Candidates named in Virginia yet they doubted 
whether in the face of the organization of party thro a con- 
vention, you could get the vote of the S*. that is if you ran 
against the regular nomination, at least this was M r . Seddon's 
opinion. M r . Scott thought that you would take the State, 
with or without a nomination. Whether they can break up 
the usages of party, by refusing to go into Caucus, with the 
residue of the Democrac}^ to nominate a Senator they will test 
in the effort to elect Mr. Hunter, whom they have resolved 
to run totally irrespective of such nomination. 

Your friends in Richmond are animated and zealous, and 
are quite willing to commence active operations the moment 
your friends in Charleston think it expedient to move. 

I had hoped on my arrival in Charleston, to have obtained 
a meeting of these friends, but in consequence of the absence 
of Elmore and Boyce, and some more of our Leaders, I was 
compelled to postpone it. I shall return on the 18 th with the 
hope but not with any confident expectation of meeting Elmore 
whofse] frequent absences from Charleston is much to be 
regretted, where he has such a just and useful influence. It 
is greatly to be lamented that the two Men at the South cal- 
culated to serve you most (Elmore and myself) should be fet- 
tered by comprehensive engagements and pecuniary enbarrass- 
mcnts which palsy our movements. I shall however go on 
the 18 th and hope to obtain an understanding with our friends 
even if he is absent. I would like to have your views at your 
earliest convenience on the following points. 

1 st Are public movements now to be desired in your behalf? 



LETTEES TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 1095 

Would they not excite the concentrated hostility of the friends 
of all your opponents ? 

2 d Shall those movements be made before or after the 
Meeting or adjournment of Congress? Shall we in the mean 
time confine our operations to effecting private organisations, 
at different influential points in the Union ? In reference to 
these last arrangements, would it be judicious for the Calhoun 
Committee to come out with an elaborate address, presenting 
as strongly as they can your claims to the favorable regards 
of the people? Or would you prefer their writing you a 
Letter and asking you to become a Candidate, which would 
present an auspicious occasion for your writing the address of 
which you spoke in one of your Letters on the public affairs 
of the Country ? Or would it be best to postpone until the 
adjournment of Congress this correspondence when we shall 
know what is to be the issue of the Mexican War? These 
are grave matters which you must assist us to decide. 

As I fear I shall have left Charleston before your answer 
can possibly reach that place, be so kind as to direct it to this 
City, to which I shall return and leave for the Bend on the 
23 or 21 inst. I will remain at the Oswichee Bend until the 
25 Nov. when I shall leave for Texas, via New Orleans. 
Whilst there if the Legislature of Louisianna is in session I 
shall endeavor to compass your nomination. Two thirds of 
the Legislature were in your favor at the last session, in spite 
of the Sugar Duty. It will be necessary to see what changes 
are to be effected or if any have been effected under the New 
Constitution. 

As soon as Peace between Mexico and the U. S. is con- 
cluded I shall repair to Washington and hold on de die and en 
diem, until some thing definitive shall be concluded in refer- 
ence to the Texian Debt, which will afford me constant oppor- 
tunities of intimate communication and intercourse with you. 

I regret I cannot take a seat in Congress, which my old 
friends in Charleston tendered me on my passing thro the 
other day. But circumstances forbid it, even if I could have 
surmounted an insuperable repugnance I should have felt, to 
unhorsing my friend Holmes, 1 to whom the representation of 
Charleston is an idolized hobby.

We have now My Dear Sir however secretly, fairly opened 
the Campaign. The conduct of the War you must mainly 
leave to your friends, beyond the fact of standing firm and 
not permitting the weakest of them to lower your Flag. If 
there is any force in public principles of acknowledged au- 
thority, if there is any moral sense in the people for unim- 
peachable integrity of character any judgment in favor of an 
accurate and profound knowledge of our Government and its 
administration, any sympathy with a zealous and uncompro- 
mising Patriotism, any taste for Genius and its accomplish- 
ments, we must triumph. At least there is enough in all 
these to make your friends proud of supporting such a Man. 
Ever sincerely and faithfully yours

Cincinnati 12 mo 2,. 1816. 

MY DEAK FRIEND I received thy favor of 10 th Ult. two days 
since on returning from a visit to Indiana and Kentucky. 

The War is no longer popular in those states or in this. The 
Whig papers are assailing it more and more the Democrat 
make a feeble and spiritless defence; whilst all intelligent men 
of the party regard it as a blunder which threatens the party 
ruin. The administration is almost unanimously deserted. 
The army also is perhaps still more hostile to a continuance 
of hostilities if we can judge from the report of returning 
volunteers. Maj r Johnson who recently resigned and came 
home, after serving in the battle of Monterey as an aid says 
that the army is decidedly averse to the annexation of either 
Mexican territory or people to ours. All regard the attempt 
to conquer Mexico hopeless and all would prefer being at 
home. Gen 1 Taylor told him at parting that he was sick of the 
war. Johnson who is one of our friends and a man of talent 
went over to P* Isabel with Gen 1 Quitman and says that the 
General expressed the deepest regret on the voyage thither that 
thee had not been heard at length before the declaration. As 
he thinks that the War thereby might have been averted, and

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1097 

ought to have been. Still there is a very cowardly disposition 
here to evade the responsibility of an effort for peace. Many 
of the Democrats who would delight in such a result, would 
be quite ready to sacrifice those by whom it was accomplished 
to the demigogues whose love of fighting is displayed exclu- 
sively in declamation. Even the Whigs would aim to avail 
themselves of any discontent that might result from the con- 
clusion of the War, as they are claiming the benefit of all that 
proceeds from its prosecution. I am however of the opinion 
that opposition to the War must prevail, as the moment its 
burdens are felt they will outweigh the contingent advantages 
of acquiring California and New Mexico, the utmost that can 
be acquired, and probably much more than can be obtained 
or held without great incidental expense. 

There is among the Democrats' of the West a stronger dis- 
position to support the proviso of Wilmot than I expected to 
find, although as thee is aware, I have long insisted that the 
principles of the Abolitionists were making more progress 
than was suspected and were rapidly approaching to ascend- 
ancy in the free states. I have therefore been in favor of the 
policy of meeting the issue at once, and developing the whole 
heresy, rather than of giving it time and opportunity to make 
its way gradually and unresisted. For I have been satisfied 
that if the contest of the Missouri question were again openly 
made, the result would be the same. If the effort is persisted 
in of introducing the question into the Mexican- War it seems 
to me that it will be a blunder on the part of those who are in 
favour of that course. For inasmuch as the consequences 
must be to detach the South from the War all the advocates 
of the War who are sincere would resist such an interference, 
and thus the War party proper as well as the South would be 
against the proviso. If on the other hand the proviso could 
pass both houses, it must put an immediate end to the War, 
for the South being detached, there would not be strength 
enough left in favour of it elsewhere, the Abolitionists them- 
selves not being ready to insist on the continuance of the war 
for the mere purpose of acquiring territory, even for non 
slaveholding states. And in either case the principle of Wil- 
mots proviso must acquire odium, without any chance of 
success. 



1098 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

But ought not the South now to take the initiative in favour 
of peace ? If she did Abolitionism would be utterly deprived 
of the pretence that this is a war of conquest waged for south- 
ern aggrandizement, a pretence which groundless as it is, 
makes a conspicuous figure in the papers of that party and 
even in those of the Whigs. And if the War could be con- 
cluded on terms at all reconcilable with public opinion, through 
Southern influence it would disarm the Whigs of the best 
weapon they wield against us, that of war expenditure. I 
confess however I see nothing in the condition or prospects of 
Mexico to warrant the expectation that she will make any 
concession. And that being the case I am satisfied that the 
most practicable and tenable ground is the one thee advised 
at the close of last session, viz. the mere occupation and 
defence of the northern unsettled provinces until Mexico is 
ready to treat, which would give to the Northern and South- 
ern sections about an equal accession of territory. As for the 
idea recently suggested that the Administration will call for 
40 millions in the message and a large number of troops it is 
too extravagant even for the folly of that concern, and too 
monstrous to be supported even by the madness of the people. 

The Navigation and Land bills will be urgent and critical 
measures at the approaching session. Steam boat disasters 
have been of alarming frequency lately, the losses being 
almost of daily occurrence. I think that as the Presidents 
veto stands in the way of a Western and northern combina- 
tion a union with the South on that subject is entirely practi- 
cable, and the movement cannot be made too soon. I perceive 
that the New York Democracy is giving way to the agrarian 
demand for the donations of public domain to the poor. And 
surprizing as it may seem and derogatory to the sagacity of 
the west, the movement meets with great favour here. The 
time therefore has fullv arrived for land graduation. 

The defeat of Wright 1 in New York has confounded and 
disheartened his friends here: although it has not perhaps 
dispelled all their hopes of his nomination. It has however 
completely bewildered the spoilsmen, who now confine them- 
selves chiefly to a defence of the caucus system through which 
they hope to succeed once more. There is nevertheless a pre-

valent misgiving among them that a caucus will not be again 
available. 

I availed myself of the occasion to write an article of some 
length for the paper here, giving an account of the leading 
incidents of thy political life and discussing briefly the ques- 
tions on which the greatest efforts have been made to create a 
popular prejudice. I intend to follow, it with a direct attack 
on the Caucus system in a short time. 

I expect to be in Washington in about a fortnight, and shall 
be happy to render any aid however little may be in my 
power, in giving a proper direction to opinion. 

Give my regards cordially to thy family

Edgewood 13 Decm r 1846 

MY DEAR SIR After I returned from selling some cotton in 
Hamburg I heard you had passed on down by M r . Clemson's 
place. I am sorry you did not come by. I would have an- 
swered your last only that I was on the River and did not 
receive it for some time after it was written and until near 
the time when you would be going on to Washington. 

As the time is now past when those, who thought proper to 
prejudice you and yours agst me, have done all they could do 
and have effected their purposes, I now take the opportunity 
to say that they gave the most extravagant, exaggerated and 
false account of everything I said and did at the public meet- 
ing held Saleday in June last at Edgefield. 

The truth is that at the first meeting held the Saturday week 
before Saleday I refused to attend upon the ground that I 
would not give any aid to any thing that might appear to con- 
flict at that time with your position. And at the meeting of 
the committee afterwards that was then appointed I expressly 
said in advance that nothing must be suggested calculated to 
reflect on your course. I was appointed Chairman of the 
Committee. M r . Wardlaw, N. L. Griffin, M r . W. Brooks, Col. 

i See Calhoun's letters in Part I, supra, pp. 6%, 698, 705, 708. 



1100 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

P. Brooks and Wm. C. Moraque were all present and will 
recollect this fact. We could hear nothing authentic as to 
your course and the reasons from Washing-ton. You did not 
write a word to me or to any one that we heard of. 

The public meeting for Saleday in June was called and for 
several days previous 1 had been very sick, and on that day 
1 was very unwell, more so than I had been for ten years, and 
had in the morning written in to say 1 would not attend. M r . 
Brooks and M r . Griffin both wrote to me and insisted that I 
should go in if merely to be present and introduce the resolu- 
tions (which made not the slightest reflection on any human 
being) I did so in great pain and suffering. The whole object 
of the meeting was to get up a war feeling and procure vol- 
unteers to sustain the Government. And what remarks I made 
were made entirely with this view. Immediately after I was 
done I was very sick so much so that the D r . had to give me 
laudnum. Col. Banskett was speaking and I left in my car- 
riage without dreaming there was to be any opposition. After 
I left Col. Wigfall introduced the resolutions in relation to 
yourself and they were laid on the table by an almost unani- 
mous vote as I understood. I was not there and never heard 
of what was done or said in reference to yourself until the 
next day, and yet I have been made responsible far all that was 
said and done. 

Mr. Wardlaw was chairman of the meeting, and he and his 
immediate friends were pleased with any thing that might 
injure me. I said the next da} 7 to those gentlemen who called 
to see me, that a full and true statement of the whole pro- 
ceedings ought to be given. It was said that M r . Wardlaw 
Chairman and Wigfall had come to an understanding that the 
rejected resolutions should not be published &c. I said then 
it was wrong and false impressions would be made. But 
after it was done, and the suppressed resolutions were in- 
formally published in a Hamburg paper with comments, I 
waited for Wardlaw to give a true account as chairman. My 
relations to him were such that I could say nothing to him 
about it. The papers in this district being only weekly, in 
the mean time every sort of comment and rumor got out and 
Wardlaw made no statement. I then saw the object and how 
the matter was to be used. It was at the time privately 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1101 



known here to those actively engaged in it that M r . M c 
would resign his seat. After all these occurrences I was too 
proud to come out and appear to explain with a view to ward 
off your powerful name and influence which had been, in the 
mean time, extensively invoked agst. me by letters as well as 
newspaper comments. It was true that I had differed widely 
with you on the course you thought proper to pursue on the 
Mexican war bill &c, and had regreted that course more on 
your own account and proper influence than anything else, 
and this was all. But I was awkwardly situated. It may be 
a weakness, but I have ever despised to appear to court any 
man, and as for seeking popular favour under the wing of 
any man living I scorn to do it. And nothing but strict Jus- 
tice and Truth induce me now to sa}^ any thing of the past. 
Circumstances have now transpired and been fully developed 
which enable me to do so and preserve every manly senti- 
ment which it has been my pride to cherish. 

What proves that, the whole object was to effect local pur- 
poses, is that Col. Elniore two weeks before the meeting at 
Edgefield in June, at a meeting in Columbia uttered precisely 
the same sentiments that I did, and advocated exactly the same 
resolutions in substance, and yet not a word of complaint has 
been suggested agst. him for his course. I have given you 
this full statement of what I did and the circumstances attend- 
ing it freely and candidly, and any thing to the contrary is 
false and was made for political effect by anonymous scribblers. 

I have served a portion of the people of S. Carolina in some 
capacity or other for the last fifteen years, and I have never 
yet approached any man or set of men to seek favour or office. 
In the many trying and exciting scenes through which I have 
passed, as God is my Judge! I have never, for one moment, 
felt a single emotion or aspiration seperate from the honor 
and the interests of South Carolina. 

I could have received the Mission to Austria from Van 
Buren; and you recollect in the Summer of 1843, at your 
house, when Mr. Upshur Secty. of State wrote you on the 
subject of presenting some friend of yours for the Mission to 
France, you urged me to allow you to present my name and 
I refused it. And when M r . Polk offered me the Mission to 
England I can proudly say that I am the only man who ever 



1102 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

refused such an office expressly upon the avowed ground that 
"I could not accept it consistently with the feelings of alle- 
giance I bear my own State." At that time the Tariff was 
not adjusted and I would not have taken any office from the 
Federal Government. 

I have ~been by you when you needed friends, and when to 
stand by you was no gam to any man. You have received 
more flattery from others, but in our past intercourse I have 
nothing to regret. 

As I never expect to have any concern in public affairs 
again I felt it due to you as well as to myself that 1 should 
say what I have in relation to this matter, and to let you know, 
that however seperated our spheres may be hereafter, yet you 
shall, as you have ever done, command my highest regard and 
admiration. 

Very truly, 

F. W. PlCKENS.

Athens Jan y . 6 th . 1847. 

MY DEAR SIR I thank you for your favor of the 29 th ult. 
The mode suggested by you for the further prosecution of the 
War is the one which had not only occurred to me previous 
to the reception of your letter, but I have frequently sug- 
gested it to others, and I have never conversed with an 
intelligent man on the subject, that did not concur on the sub- 
ject. The war would then be defensive on our part, and our 
Citizens generally would be better reconciled to its long con- 
tinuance. It really does appear to me, notwithstanding our 
signal success so far, that we have really not yet advanced 
the first step towards subduing the Mexican people but the 
reverse, they are stronger and more determined than ever. 
The way we have so far prosecuted the war must be changed, 
or it will be interminable. I have seen enough of the course 
of such men as Wilmot of Penn. Gordon of New York and 
various others on the floor of Congress, to satisfy me, that 
both political parties in the non-Slave-holding States, are 
firmly and fully united and resolved to prohibit the introduc- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1103 

tion of any more slave States into the Union, formed of Ter- 
ritory which may be acquired from Mexico. It is true I have 
indulged some hope, that in the event of acquiring- Territory, 
we might be able to form something like a reasonable com- 
promise on the subject. But I begin to doubt now, that the 
time is rapidly approaching, when the great struggle between 
the slave and non-slave-holding States must come up on an 
issue which will shake our glorious confederacy to its very 
Center. My old friend, I love the Union. But I am ready to 
resist unto death, rather than to submit to the schemes, plans 
and policy of the Abolitionists and their friends and supporters 
throughout the non slaveholding States. 

Ardently as I love the Union, I consider it Valueless, when 
it is used for my oppression and destruction. 

From this time forward, we may expect the Slave question 
to be the great and vital one, which will over-ride every other 
question. Our divisions will be sectional. The names of 
Whig and Democrat will lose their charms. My greatest 
apprehension is, that the South may not be as united in the 
day and hour of trial as her Enenty. I fear the lust for power 
and place may have its influence on many of our own people. 
And that portion of the southern population who own no 
slaves generally feel very different on the subject, from the 
slave holder. 

Nothing can preserve our rights in the approaching strug- 
gle but Union in the present Congress amongst Southern men, 
(or perhaps I should say, Union in the next Congress). The 
South united can face a frowning world. Work to the* point 
of uniting the South, regardless of party names. 

I consider the new f angled scheme of Left Geu 1 . * &c. per- 
fectly ridiculous. It is nothing more, nor less Than a self- 
ish and base scheme designed to benefit individuals at the 
expense of the best interest of the Country. 

ff the press and Congress have become so" debased, as to 
unite in keeping light from the people, have we not reason 
to fear, that the days of our Republic are numbered. 

The unofficial people of this country are patriotic. There- 
fore they favor a vigorous prosecution of the War. Believ-

ing as they do, that no other way can be devised to procure a 
speedy and honorable peace. 

From this to the close of the Session, 1 shall look for. pro- 
ceedings in Congress with great interest. 
As Ever Yrs.

From Fitzwilliam Byrdsall. c. c. 

Private New York Feb y . 14 th . 1847 

DEAR SIK. I have long observed an abuse growing up in 
the Senate of the U. S. of Senators arraigning one another 
for the political acts or sentiments of former years. In 
my humble opinion this is not consistent with the dignity of 
the Senate, or the rights of Senators, because personalities 
should not be exhibited in that body, and because that as 
every Senator is the representative of a Sovereign State he 
is only accountable to the State he represents. 

In the recent Tournay in which M r . Turney 1 in the Senate 
tilted himself against You, I am much pleased with the man- 
ner in which his onset was met. It afforded a happy oppor- 
tunity of placing yourself in a just point of view before the 
popular mind of the Country, for you of all public men have 
been misrepresented to and therefore misconceived by the 
people. There is no man who knows you believes that your 
elevation to the presidency would be any personal acquisition 
or elevation to yourself but the friends of Constitutional 
principles desire to see you in a position where these princi- 
ples could be declared and evidenced with greater effect. 
This, as regards you and the presidency is the whole story. 

But your speech on the three millions Bill in its very sever- 
ity of truth and analysis in its strict harmony with the best 
rules of composition and total absence of imaginative or dic- 
tional ornament in its grouping of facts existing and illus- 
trative, has struck a blow which cannot be resisted or returned 
in any other way than in personalities. The mercenaries of 
patronage in this city, many of whom went for Harrison in 
1840, others who went from Van Buren to Polk in 1844 and 

1 Hopkins L. Turney, senator from Tennessee. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1105 

nearly all of whom will go from Polk to any successful can- 
didate in 1848 accost me in the streets "Well what do you 
think of M r . Calhoun now ? " I can assure you however that 
the best and largest portion of tne people do not express them- 
selves as these mercenaries do. 

The Telegraphic news in the Herald reports M r . Westcott as 
having said in the Senate on the 13 th . that u the democracy of 
this administration consisted of nothing more than loaves and 
fishes from the Lieutenant General down to a mere second 
lieutenant. If the people of the U. S. were only aware of the 
corruption which exists at the seat of Government they would 
tumble the President and his departments the Congress and 
the Whigs and Democrats heels over heads together into the 
Potomac, and they would do right." 

This is very strong stronger I suspect than the Senator 
expressed himself, but 1 am forced to believe from what I see 
and feel around me here, and it is painful to myself to see and 
feel it, that there is no difference in the principles of demo- 
crats and whigs but that which governs Ins and Outs. Either 
party will resort to any means right or wrong, true or false, 
holy or wicked, pro or anti that will gain Votes. 

I see that you are averse to the acquisition of territory from 
the populous country of Mexico, or that portion which would 
grow cotton and Sugar. Were you to go in favor of more 
territory in that direction, what an outcry would be raised 
that you wanted the whole of Mexico for slave States. There 
would be a woful howl among those politico philanthropists 
who realty have as little regard for the negro as they have for 
republican institutions or the constitution of the United States. 
A few years ago many of our Barnburning Democratic Aboli- 
tionists were "Northern men with Southern principles." If 
Messrs. Van Buren and Wright had not made a miscalculation 
upon the Texas annexation question, we should not have now 
the Preston and King movement, or the Wilmot proviso. The 
Albany dynasty had calculated that the unpopularity or weak- 
ness of the Tyler administration would quash annexation for 
some time. 

I dont hear a word about nullification in these days. Who 
are the nullifiers now in the worst sense of that term ? There is 
HIST 99 VOL ii TO 



1106 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

a vast difference between the nullifiers of an unconstitutional 
tax law, and the nullifiers of our system of Government. 

An old man once said to his son, that if he wanted revenge 
upon his enemies to pray for long life and if granted, he 
would see enough respecting all of them to satisfy his desire. 
I think that if your life is spared a few years longer, you will 
see all those men overthrown who for nearly a quarter of a 
century have systematically and by corrupt political machin- 
ery operated to pervert the democratic party and the legisla- 
tion of the Union. You were an obstacle in their way 
upward, therefore they injured you in every possible manner, 
and it would seem to be a trait of human nature that the 
injurer never forgives. 

I rejoice to learn by the papers that Senator Lewis is recov- 
ering his health. I have felt much anxiety about him and 
would have written to him but feared that it might be an 
intrusion upon a sick man. 

In conclusion Every day's experience and reflection satis- 
fies me that if the Governmental principles advocated by you 
shall not prevail Our system of Government will not be of 
long duration. 

Yours with profound Respect

MY DEAR SIR 1 feel it to be due to myself to enclose you 
the New York Mirror of the 13 th Inst. and to direct your 
attention to that portion of an article which I have designated 
by ink lines. I do this for the single purpose of declaring 
the entire falsity of the publication, most especially so far as 
it ascribes to me any unfriendly intentions towards you while 
you were a member of my Cabinet, or the knowledge of any 
plot or machination on the part of others of a character inju- 
rious to you. So far from this I do not hesitate to say that 
from the time of your acceptance of the Secretary-ship of 
State to the close of rny Administration, you possessed my 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1107 

entire confidence, and that had it been otherwise you would 
have been informed of it from my own lips. I held no con- 
sultation as to Cabinet appointments and most generally they 
were not announced to others until they were irrevocably 
made. Such was the fact in your own case. My object 
throughout was by calling the highest talents to my Cabinet, 
to secure myself through great public measures an honorable 
mention in history. Whether this object has been accom- 
plished or not the future alone can determine. The assump- 
tion of motive which is made to me by this libellous writer 
for calling you to the Cabinet, you are as well aware as myself 
to be wholly unfounded. 

I have abstained from noticing the numberless attacks which 
have been made upon me as well since as before I left office, 
but in this instance I have deem'd it proper to break my uni- 
form silence. 

With best wishes for your health and happiness 
I am y'rs &c

From Duff Green. c. c. 

Washington 6 th April 1847 

MY DEAR SIR Yours of the 29 th [28] is before me. It is, 
under the peculiar circumstances, most gratifying to me to 
be thus assured of your confidence and regard. If I know 
my own heart, its first wish, connected with public affairs is 
to see you in the position for which your superior qualifica- 
tions, your eminent public services, and public and private 
virtues give you claims greater than any other person. I 
need not say to } r ou, that no one has a higher respect for 
your character, and that no one places a higher estimate on 
your friendship. Knowing that I have at all times suffered 
persecution, because your political adversaries feared that my 
influence would be exerted for your advancement, the sug- 
gestion that those who are recognised as your friends wanted 
confidence in me, was calculated to wound me, in proportion 
to the claims which my fidelity, my services and my sacrifices 
gave me upon them. No one else could so well urge those 



1108 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

claims because no one else so well knows on what they rest, 
as you do. You know that I have never permitted my own 
private interests or personal preferences to control my sense 
of public duty. In the case to which }^ou refer in 1840 you 
know that when I found that Blair and Rives had induced 
both Lewis and Pickens to become candidates for Speaker, 
with an understanding that your friends were to vote for 
them as printers I told you that I would not ask you to aid 
my Election as printer. I saw then and told you that your 
young friends in Congress were making a position for them- 
selves in the dominant party at your expense and at the 
expense of your principles. I have since seen the selfishness 
of others, and I am frank to say that one of the inducements 
with me to publish a paper is to counteract that tendency on 
the part of those who have acted with you, towards being 
absorbed by the majority. I would now, while your influence 
is active create an interest which will control for good the 
future elements of party: 

I have always known that you acted then (1840) as you 
have on all other occasions from a high sense of your duty 
to the country. I appreciate the influence Avhich the bias of 
your political associates had upon your own 'judgment, and 
altho I regretted then and have ever since, your reconciliation 
with Van Buren, 1 have abated nothing of my attachment 
confidence or respect for you, personally and political!} 7 . 

After writing to }^ou I saw Gn 1 Gadsden, and conversed 
with him on the subject of the paper, and he suggested that 
my best plan was to issue a prospectus and call upon the 
south to aid me. He said that the objection had been made 
in Charleston that all was quiet until you came, and that their 
movement had not been responded to in any other place. I 
wrote by him to M r Holmes and have not heard from either 
of them. 1 confess that it does appear to me that the South 
are a doomed people, and I am compelled to ask myself, why 
should I who have so little in common with them take upon 
myself the advocacy of their interests? I confess to you 
further that I cannot close my eyes to the fact that this leth- 
argy in the South indicates a state of indifference which, with 
the fixed opposition to you in influential quarters, greatly 
discourages me. I can see that to avail ourselves of Gen 1 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1109 

Taylor's position and popularity we may by uniting your 
friends and his give a direction to the next Presidential Elec- 
tion greatly to strengthen the position of the South, but I am 
unwilling to take on myself the responsibility of such a-move- 
ment. Taylor is a slave holder, and should the V a Election 
go against them the Whigs will nominate him. This will 
probably be followed by the nomination of an abolition Can- 
didate. It is our interest to commit the Whigs against Abo- 
lition and we should hold a position which will prompt all 
parties to look to us as controlling the future. 

It has been suggested that the people should in primary 
assemblies nominate you and Taylor. If your friends were 
to do this, the Whigs might nominate Taylor and thus com- 
plicate our position. My own view is that as yet we should 
hold the nomination in reserve, put the questions in issue fully 
and forcibly before the people, and select our candidate for 
the South, when public sentiment is more fully developed. 

I have closed a satisfactory arrangement for the sale of a 
part of my mountain property. The parties reside in Phil" 
and are highly respectable and wealthy. They go to see the 
property this week and make the pay fc upon the report of their 
Geologist, which cannot be otherwise than satisfactory. I 
will then be in funds and can publish a paper on my own 
account but, before I act in the matter wish to hear from you 
relative to Gen 1 Taylor's position. 

Yours truly DUFF GREEN

MY DEAR SIR, I trust that you will not feel it as a cruel 
infliction to receive a letter, now and then, from an old and 
constant friend more especially as I shall not write but when 
something connected with your own prospects, or those long 
cherished principles which 1 first learned from you, bears 
heavily on my mind. 

1 Alexander Bowie, a prominent South Carolina lawyer, had emigrated to Alabama in 
1835, and had been chancellor of the northern division of that State from 1839 to 1845. 



1110 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The events of the last winter in Washington, have made a 
deep and lasting impression upon your friends here, and I 
presume every where. Such has been the effect produced 
here, that already we begin to feel that we no longer belong 
to the Democratic party indeed, the party has, substantially, 
ostracised *, as Tom Richey u et id omne genus" have served 
or endeavored to serve you. What shall we do? We can 
never be Whigs, until they repudiate the political doctrines 
which they have heretofore advocated. If we should attempt 
a party organization on our own principles, we should find 
ourselves a third party, weaker than either of the others, and 
an object of bitter hostility, to both. Indeed, our political 
creed would differ but little, if any, from that professedly 
embraced by the Democratic party, it would however as I 
think, be more honestly professed and more faithfully acted 
out. 1 have long been satisfied that the present organization 
of parties in the United States has been an unfortunate one. 
Thousands of those who were a few years ago most excellent 
State rights republicans, are now Federal Whigs. Many, who 
fifteen years ago, were prepared to peril life, property and 
every thing but freedom, in opposition to a protective tariff, 
have since found themselves battling, side by side, with the 
champions of the restrictive policy. Such, however, is the 
unavoidable consequence of party organization. Accident 
often determines the adoption of a measure, when party obliga- 
tions compel us to espouse it, even though it be opposed to 
our preconceived and most cherished principles. In our gov- 
ernment, it seems to me, the only sensible and legitimate divi- 
sion of parties is by the line which separates the State rights 
doctrine from that of consolidation. Upon this base, were 
parties first organized in our country, and I think it is deeply 
to be deplored that that organization was ever broken up. If 
we could have a reorganization of parties, assuming the old 
names, or new names with the old principles, many Whigs 
here (and I doubt not, elsewhere) would join us. In this 
County, you have some strong friends in the Whig ranks; but 
they are old State rights men, who find that they are in a false 
position. It is all important that upon the Slavery question 
the South should be united and it is one of the most melan- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1111 

choly effects of our present party divisions that even a com- 
mon danger will hardly produce a cordial union. If we were 
now, as we once were, either Republicans or Federalists, 
there would be but little division in the South. 

But it is vain, 1 fear, to talk about new-organizing parties 
we have not the power to do it, and I suppose we must submit 
to things as we find them. My object in beginning this letter 
was to assure you of the unabated confidence of your friends 
here.; and to ask you, if it will not be too great a tax on your 
time, to give me your views as to the proper policy to be pur- 
sued, in the present state of things, by those who have been 
heretofore called ' ' Calhoun Democrats ". There is no political 
event we desire more than to see you elevated to the presi- 
dency yet, with your known principles and feelings, we 
scarcely believe such an event to be possible. By the by, I 
have often, of late years, been reminded of a prophecy upon 
that subject uttered to me, by the late Felix Grundy of Ten- 
nessee, some thirty five years ago. He spent a night with us 
at old Mr. Wardlaw's, where 1 boarded. He was on his 
return from Congress during the last war with England. I 
was indulging in a little enthusiastic admiration both of you 
and Mr. Clay, and predicting that you would both fill the 
presidential office. Mr. Grundy, agreeing with my enconiums, 
said, in very nearly these words, "" I think you will find your- 
self mistaken neither Mr. Calhoun nor Mr. Clay will ever 
be President of these United States and I now predict fur- 
ther, that after the last Revolutionary character, who is quali- 
fied for the station, shall have filled the office, a first rate 
statesman will never attain it such a man will never sell him- 
self to a party; and therefore can never be elected." So far 
his prediction has been verified; and although I do not believe 
that the mantle of Elijah fell upon his shoulders; yet I have 
awful fears that he guessed the truth. 

May we not hope to see you at our house next autumn ? 
You promised me you would make your next trip to Alabama 
by this route. Excuse this rambling epistle, and with kind 
regards to Mrs. Calhoun, believe me 
Your sincere friend, 

A. BOWIE.

From R. K Cmlle. c. c. 

Elwah Cottage, April 18 th 1847 

MY DEAR SIR: 1 have delayed answering your favour of 
the 22 nd ult. until I could hear and see more from various 
sections of the State as to the probable course of public 
affairs. Enough is now developed to warrant the conclusion 
drawn in your note of the 6 th inst. which has just reached me. 
Ignoble cowardice and an inordinate love of office have pre- 
vailed over every honorable sense, truth, justice, consistency 
and patriotism. The dread of being in a minority is far more 
powerful than the love of truth; and manly independence 
succumbs to the hope and expectation of plunder. 

Such is the spectacle presented by the State of Virginia. 
Her Politicians, with some few honorable exceptions, have 
been so long under the controul of Ritchie, that abject sub- 
serviency seems to have become a part of their very natures. 
Had your friends maintained firmly the stand they took at 
the meeting in Richmond, I have no doubt the state could 
have been preserved from the fatal tyranny of a National 
Convention; but the time when the meeting was held was 
most unpropitious immediately preceeding an election in 
the result of which many of its members had a direct and 
strong personal interest. Without organization, or the means 
to make their influence to be felt immediately, and uncertain 
of the final result of an open and bold stand, they were 
foolishly led to compromise every thing by yielding that 
which gives to their enemies complete controul now and for 
the future. Harvie and Seddon and Bocock seem alone to 
have maintained themselves. 

This is all most shameful, nay, disgraceful; and is enough 
to make a man forswear politics altogether. But the end is 
not yet. The result of the election next Thursday * will pre- 
sent some reliable data for future calculations. If it go 
against the Hunkers (and I am strongly inclined to this opin- 
ion) it may present hopes favourable to a future and more 
auspicious organization of Parties. The dominant Party will 
perceive its need of our assistance, and may be induced to 
reconsider its stringent and exclusive rules of discipline 

i The Virginia election of April 22. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1113 

principles they have none. But if they carry the State, it 
seems to me that no favourable calculation can be made on 
the State for the future. We must be put down as the serv- 
ile and obedient vassals of the Albany Regency; unless, 
indeed, some new question arise to arouse the public mind 
from the stupor that enthrals it or some popular favourite 
to sever the bonds that bind us. 

As to the former, I had entertained hopes from the great 
issues invojved in the Wilmot Proviso, and presented in your 
Resolutions. But as you well observe in your note of the 
6 th inst. these are virtually surrendered when the election of 
of the Chief Magistrate is given up to the Cabal called a 
National Convention. Their selection determines the person, 
and their imprimateur endorses the principles of the candi- 
date. So that even this tremendous question gives place to 
the engrossing matter of power and plunder. Indeed it is 
much to be doubted, (I speak of course in reference to this 
State alone, as to the other Slave States it may be otherwise) 
whether the naked issues involved in the Wilmot Proviso 
would, of themselves, suffice to overthrow the despotism of 
Party : for a very large portion (the trans- Alleghany) of 
the State is, I fear ripe for the measure, however the fact 
may be concealed from motives of Party prudence. The fear 
of losing the vote of the State in the Presidential Election 
alone, I am inclined to think, prevents both factions in the 
west from showing their hands. As to the Richmond Junto, 
looking as they do solely to the possession of power and the 
plunder it secures, I hesitate not to express the opinion that 
they will side with the majority, even should that threaten 
the safety of our domestic institution as it exists, much less 
its extension to new Territory. Indeed, so completely have 
they stultified the public mind, that you cannot even bring 
intelligent men to look the question fully in the face. They 
are too much engaged about the election of Presidents to 
think or to reason like men. This is true of both factions, 
and if the disease exist to the same extent in other states we 
shall keep easily under the yoke, without even sufficient vir- 
tue to enter a protest; much less to resist as becomes men the 
daring assault on our rights, honour and liberty. 



1114 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

The other alternative presented in the moral weight of some 
popular favourite is hazardous in the extreme, as our own 
past history sufficiently proves; to say nothing of the histories 
of other popular Governments. That favourite must be a 
military Chief. None other, without some great change in 
the temper and spirit of our People, can ever hope again to 
weal sufficient power over the masses. If such a man be taken 
up, and through his influence the vile machinery of the Factions 
that infest the state be deranged or broken up, what security 
have we against the common destiny of all Republics? Jack- 
son might have fixed the Government on a firm basis for a 
century at least had his virtue kept pace with his popularity, 
or his judgment been equal to his energy. But while he over- 
threw the Federal^ Oligarchy, he allowed himself to be used 
as the [word missing} tool of the worst of all factions The 
Spoils Party the very men who had most bitterly denounced 
him, and left us as a legacy ignorance, vice, insolence and 
anarchy. 

It is true, we may all entertain better hopes of Genl. Taylor, 
who, it seems is fast rising into notice and threatening the 
aspirants of the present corrupt and imbecile dynasty. I see 
it stated in the Public Papers that you have retired from the 
contest and advised your friends to rally to his support. Is 
this true ? I shall not attempt to dissuade } r ou or offer counsel ; 
but while I feel it to be absolutely necessary for the safety of 
our institutions that the present infamous dynasty should be 
utterly overthrown and extirpated, I am by no means certain 
that the election of Genl. Taylor will secure it. Should the 
Plunderers find him too strong to be resisted, they will, as in 
the case of Jackson, immediately sheathe their poison poign- 
ards, and salute him with a kiss, though it be that of Judas. 
This they will certainly do; and looking forward still to the 
future, will endeavour at the same time to preserve their vile 
machinery of Conventions and Caucuses for future use. If 
he be of the tone or temper of Jackson, he will, like him, pass 
through the fire to Molech, and leave corruption and despotism 
as our perpetual heritage. 

On the other hand, if they stand out, and the opposing 
faction take him up, as they will do, it will be with aims not 
very dissimilar. Already you see, from the late nomination 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1115 

in Philadelphia when John Sargeant and others of that ilk 
figured most prominently, that a National Convention is to 
pass its final and authoritative judgment. Thus you perceive 
that they too are for preserving, in the first place, the same 
iniquitous machinery, and doubtless for the same iniquitous 
purpose. The fact is, that little and bad men cannot rise 
without the use of this lever; and therefore little and bad 
men, (and who amongst the low and debased leaders of the two 
Factions can be placed out of this category,) will stand by it 
to the last. In fighting for it, they are contending for their 
very existence. 

In no case, therefore, could we, I think, safely or consist- 
ently support Gen. Taylor, but as a Candidate distinctly 
opposed to these infernal machines, which have already cor- 
rupted the public virtue and prostrated the most conservative 
principles of the Constitution. That he will have it in his 
Power as President to reform, to a great extent, the abuses 
and corruptions of the Government, I have no doubt; but the 
sincerity of his purposes should be tested by an open and 
undisguised denunciation of that vile system of President- 
making &c. which, more than all other causes combined, has 
led to these abuses and corruptions. If he will do this, his 
election, with your support, will be certain; and the conse- 
quent benefits to the Country incalculable. Will he do this? 
Will he throw himself upon the People, instead of the ignoble 
knot of political hucksters who have sold and enslaved them? 

If you retire from the contest, however, and under the 
present aspect of affairs, I cannot undertake to dissuade you, 
I, for one, shall have no more to do with public matters; but 
retire forever from the arena, to the calm pursuits of literary 
and agricultural labour. I see the tendency of the public 
feeling is towards Taylor every where. It is eminently so in 
this section. This is what I [word missing] and predicted in 
my letter to you the Session before the last. This Mexican 
war I felt assured was destined to produce a new litter of 
military Heroes and Presidents. The prophecy is in a course 
of fulfilment. For your own reputation I never believed that 
the Presidency was worth the pursuit; or that patronage and 
power could add anything to your fame. Still, for the sake 
of the Country and its Institutions, I desired much to see you 



1116 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

in the Chief Magistracy. Your retirement, if indeed, you 
have retired from the contest, will not deprive me of the hope; 
for with your regular and temperate habits, I do not doubt 
but that your physical and mental energies will remain unim- 
paired for many years to come. I shall, therefore, still live 
under the hope that when I vote for a President, it will still 
be for John C. Calhoun. I shall, most surely, vote for no 
other, though the dead rise to bid me. 

Blackford will publish your remarks next week. They 
would have appeared before but for the pressure of local elec- 
tioneering matter, and military despatches. 

I wish most ardently that you and your family could spend 
the summer or fall months with us in the mountains. 1 have 
had considerable additions made to my House, and, by August, 
could give you very passable accommodations. Such a trip 
would serve much to strengthen and recreate you. Write to 
me as soon as this reaches you, .as I am very anxious to know 
your views and purposes after seeing the Papers last night. 
Mrs. C. joins me in affectionate regard to yourself Mrs. C.

Charleston April 24, 1847. 

MY DEAR SIR. If I have not written you before it has been 
the result of my having been for the last two Months on the 
move in my Journey to Texas and on my return home. Your 
course, the vindictive attacks which have been made on you, 
the admirable ability with which you have sustained the one, 
and tlie firmness and dignity with which you repelled the 
other have commanded my alternate sympathy and augmented 
Regard. 

On my return home, I found with few exceptions the Demo- 
cratic press of Georgia was in full cry against you and among 
the most rabid and clamorous was the Columbus Times edited 
by a Son of the late M r . Forsyth. 

You have some very devoted friends in Columbus who hap- 
pen to comprise the most intelligent and respectable people in 
that place. As soon as they learnt my return from Texas they 
sent for me to come up to Columbus and to consider how these 
attacks were to be repelled. At their suggestion I went to 
the Hotel and sketched an article, which I send you which 
however militant in its tone the Editor was compelled to pub- 
liyh. It is only an introductory Fire vindicating your Motives 
from the unworthy imputations cast upon them. The defence 
of your course and opinion I reserve for a moment of greater 
leisure and a more convenient season under proper provocation. 
I mean when I take it in hand to make it effective if I can. 

I am just from N Orleans the focus of all the Rays which 
are there converging from the Valley of the West to make 
Gen 1 Taylor President. His partisans are almost universally 
your friends and the most intelligent surrender, or rather are 
inclined to surrender your claims rather from necessity than 



1118 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

choice because they believe that the popularity of the old 
Gen 1 will alone enable the Country to relieve itself of the con- 
joint and infamous burdens of Hunkerisrn and abolitionism. 

A Relative of Gen 1 Taylor's came to see me when I was in 
New Orleans and frankly told me that he greatly prefer ed 
you to his kinsman for the Presidency but under your recent 
rupture with the Democrats and the total alienation of the 
Northern Whigs from you on a/c of your position on the 
Wilmot Proviso your election was altogether hopeless altho 
if Gen 1 Taylor was out of the field he had no doubt you would 
get a majority of the Slave States in the Union. 

In these opinions 1 entirely concur. He then went on to say 
that Gen 1 Taylor would not accept he believed a party nomi- 
nation or even the nomination of a National Convention. If 
elected by the spontaneous Voice of the people he might serve. 
This Gentleman moreover remarked with some emphasis If 
without specific guarantees but under a pledge to do his duty to 
the whole Country according to the dictates of his own con- 
science the old Genl. received the support of the highly tal- 
ented party of M r . Calhoun (the most talented and chivalrous 
as he was pleased to say in the Country) he and his friends 
would have a fair share in the Gov* of the Country and in the 
direction of its public measures. My reply to him was that 
next to yourself, I should certainly prefer the election of Gen 1 
Taylor, because I believed he was an honest Man with a kind 
heart and a clear head. But I could give no assurances of 
support without consulting my Carolina friends with whom I 
was resolved to act under all circumstances and contingencies. 

Now My Dear Sir What are we to do? With Gen 1 Taylor 
in the Field you cannot be elected and even if he is withdrawn 
(of which there is not the smallest prospect for his friends will 
force him into the canvass) your election would be doubtful 
and could only be consummated after a tremendous struggle 
in the H. of R. 

The Question then arises shall we stand off and permit the 
Genl. to pass into the hands of the Whigs or by a timely ten 
der of our adhesion endeavor to organise a New National 
Republican party on a broad basis sufficiently broad under 
the adjustment of the tariff, internal improvements, Bank, 
and rejection and negation of the Wilmot provisio to admit of 



LETTEES TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1119 

Crittenden and yourself taking part in the Gov* of the 
Country. 

I shall write to two of Gen 1 Taylor's friends (in immediate 
communication with him) to take the ground that he will 
accept no party nomination Nor will he entertain for one 
moment a consideration whether he will accept the presidency 
until the War with Mexico is closed. This will give us time 
to shape our Measures but the question again presses home 
What shall these measures be? We must not lag too far in 
the rear or we shall lose all influence in controlling public 
measures. Or shall we let this Military tempest rage, stand 
aside and take no part in its power or its agitations ? 

I cannot perceive how a Man of your power whether in or 
out of Congress can take no part in the public affairs of the 
Country. Your influence would be as certain altho as silent 
as the Laws of Gravitation. It is the irresistible destiny of 
Genius, and it remains for you to decide how you will use 
that power in an entirely new State of things. Write imme- 
diately in reply directed to Savannah Geo. 

I remain My Dear Sir with esteem Faithfully and respcy 
yours,

June 21, 1847. 

MY DEAR SIR I have very little communication here with 
the Cabinet Ministers: but I have found by relatives, and con- 
ferences with the President himself, and without giving you 
authority, I will tell you what I suppose to be the present 
probability as to future events. 

In the first place, they are still full of the idea of conquer- 
ing a peace: That will not be dispelled, until the City of 
Mexico is taken, and no peace proceeds or follows its capture. 
Should however, the administration be disappointed, in con- 
quering a peace with the money at their command, I do not 
think they will come to Congress to ask another loan. They 
will adopt a policy consistent with the ordinary [moves?] of 
the Government, and that policy must be, the one you sug- 



1120 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

gested and advised at the last Congress: It will be a bitter 
pill to many of them, but it will be swallowed rather than 
meet worse consequences. Altho' as you suggested there is 
a large Party growing up in the United States, who are for 
taking the whole of Mexico, 1 the President I do not think will 
support it. Old Ritchie would if for no other reason, because 
you are opposed to it. Benton and Silas Wright altho now 
not prepared for it, might rally on this ground, believing it, 
a popular one; and as a good set-off to the Wilmot Proviso 
blunder. Walker Mason and Clifford in the Cabinet, will be 
opposed to it. Cave Johnson will do as Polk does; and he 
will not I am satisfied go for any such policy. I think then, 
matters will stand thus. If we get a peace, then the Wilmot 
Proviso must come up in the Senate, and the treaty be rejected, 
unless the South is false to itself. This will break up the 
Democratic Party, and disgrace the Administration. If on 
the contrary, no peace is obtained, then, the administration is 
compelled to adopt your policy worse to them, so far as their 
desires are concerned, than such a disgrace. In either event, 
the war-makers have little to gain, by the progress of things. 

I enclose you a letter I have rec d from Lewis McLane, to 
show you his opinion as to our supporting Taylor. As soon 
as I hear from Gen 1 . Davis I will communicate with you, but 
Gov. Brown from Mississippi told me a week or so ago, that 
Gen 1 . Davis said that Taylor is as sound on the Tariff Ques- 
tion as you are. He is also said to be opposed to a U. S. 
Bank. We may be driven to support Taylor; but I fear the 
Whigs will render it impossible by nominating him as their 
candidate, by a National Convention. Thinking they can elect 
Taylor anyhow, they will insist on making the election a Whig 
affair. Scott is in furious Dudgeon at Trist's Mission, 2 whilst 
the administration hate both him and Taylor. It is a hard 
case, that after all, as the consummation of their policy, they 
may be compelled to make these men or to make } r ou; per- 
haps both. Some of them may grow grey or crazy, under 
such intolerable retribution. 

You seem to suppose that I am not to be a member of the

only decline a re-election in 1818. By this time I suppose 
the present troubled aspect of public affairs will be settled 
either for our relief, or permanent endurance.

from Fitzwilliam Byrdsall. c. c. 

Private. New York July 19 th 1817 

DEAR SIR, You expressed yourself in the Senate of the 
U. S. to the purport that the Mexican war was the com- 
mencement of a new career in our political history, which 
precluded your View into the future. I was much impressed 
with the force and beauty of the declaration at the time you 
uttered it, and since then, the idea your words conveyed, has 
remained indelibly traced upon my memory. 

This war has given additional excitement to the fanaticism 
of Abolition, and has already divided the republican party of 
the North within itself, as well as almost placed it antagonis- 
tically towards the Southern portion. The battle fields of 
Mexico have also introduced Gen 1 . Taylor to the people of 
the United States, as the most prominent candidate for the 
presidency in 1848, and how many more candidates for that 
high Office are to come from the same source in future times, 
who can tell? It is remarkable too, in this era of anti war 
societies, evangelical unions, anti slavery Conventions, mutual 
guarantee associations and propagandism of philanthropy that 
a war chief should stand high in the estimation of these modern 
crusaders, and that the partizans of every kind of movement, 
are much taken with the notion of a no party candidate, i. e. 
no movement at all. But with all this eclat about a no party, 
or all parties Candidate, it is very evident that Gen 1 . Taylor 
is not the first choice of those who have hitherto controlled 
the action of the two great political parties. There are other 
public men that the politicians would greatly prefer to him, 
but they will yield to the popular will, when they cannot with 
safety to their selfishness do otherwise. Now, although I do 
not consider the elevation of a military commander to the 
highest office in the Republic, as a desirable object as respects 
HIST 99 VOL ii 71 



1122 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

republican Institutions like ours, yet under existing circum- 
stances, with Wilmot provisoes, vicious organizations of politi- 
cal parties &c &c. it may be that Gen 1 . Taylor is the best man 
to break up those long standing corrupt organizations, which 
have exercised more despotism over the citizen than ever ex- 
isted under any other constitutional Government. If Gen 1 . 
Taylor is disposed to exert the influence and patronage of the 
Executive department to this end, he would deserve the grati- 
tude of every friend of freedom of suffrage, and I would pre- 
fer him to all other men that I know of, save one. 

The recent batch of political manifestoes of the great I am 
Thomas H. Ben ton, together with the billing and cooings be- 
tween the Wilmot proviso Democrats and the abolitionists, 
have greatly invigorated the hopes and desires of the Van 
Buren myrmidons as respects a restoration of the Albany Re- 
gency Bourbons in the person of Silas Wright. They speak 
confidently of his being the Candidate of the party in 184:8, 
that with him the State of New York can be carried, and "as 
goes the State goes the Union." They allege that the loss by 
the Argus faction, will be more than made up in other quar- 
ters; and besides, there is some prospect of a reconciliation. 
There is evidently an under current movement on foot amongst 
the managers, and no effort will be left untried to regain 
ascendancy, or to triumph in working a defeat. 

Party Organizations, as managed, are the curse of the 
Union. Their operation is calculated to afford demonstration 
to the world, that the beautiful theory of representative Gov- 
ernment is Utopian. The least Virtuous of our politicians in 
secret cliques and combinations, contrive, by packing the 
Conventions, to controll the nominations, while there is at 
all times, a concert of action amongst them to keep the most 
high minded and capable men in the back ground. For many 
years you, and all your unflinching friends in this part of the 
Union, have been jealously guarded against, for there has 
grown up, nurtured by the partizans of Van Buren, Ben ton, 
Wright and C. a hostile feeling towards you in the minds of 
many otherwise well meaning men, which amounts at this 
day to a fixed prejudice, with which no facts or reasonings 
can prevail. Have you not for years been opposed by the 
organized presses of these politicians ? Has not every meas- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1123 

ure you advocated been resisted to the uttermost, without 
regard to the principles avowed by the party ? How many 
men in the Senate have risked encountering you as a 
means to recommend themselves to favor or popularity, or to 
make themselves great, like as in the fable of the frog and 
the Ox ? Without going f a[r]ther back than the last session 
of Congress, if Benton, Cass, Turney, or any of your antago- 
nists had prevailed against you, the presses of the organiza- 
tion would have fulminated a yell of triumph throughout the 
land, the echoes of which would not have ceased during your 
life time; for in one sentence, you are the object of the 
malignity of three of the worst passions of human nature, 
namely, the selfish ambition of your political foes, the avarice 
of the protectionists and the fanaticism of the abolitionists? 
But it is greatly to your credit that you nobly sustained your- 
self through every trial; it is greatly to the honor of the 
State you represent that she has stood by you while opposed 
by all sorts of organizations of political and selfish interests, 
and which would have probably overwhelmed any other man 
of any other State. Nevertheless, the most wonderful feature 
of your career is, that notwithstanding all the above adverse 
circumstances, and even more, you have fixed upon the Amer- 
ican mind, your views of Constitutional powers, your ideas of 
Republican Government, your principles of political economy, 
more extensively than all your Competitors or Cotemporaries. 
Yet this is not all, there are thousands of politicians who in 
these days are in favor of the constitutional expositions they 
formerly condemned, while they still retain the animosity 
towards the exponent, which his course then excited. For 
myself, I avow the fact that to no man of the dead or the 
living do I feel that I am so much indebted for a proper com- 
prehension of our system of Government, as yourself. 

Your recent speech, which you delivered in Charleston, 1 is 
of timely import to the Southern States. It presents to 
them their true position in the confederacy, and the dangers 
to which they are exposed. No division should be there on 
the old party grounds about the presidency, but all should 
unite for the one great object of placing the Veto power of 

i March 9, 1847, Works, iv, 382-396. 



1124 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

the constitution in the hands of a faithful Southern man. 
Let me tell you here, that the anti southern Democrats in 
this part of the Union, are looking forward to the death of 
the defender of the constitution, and calculating upon their 
future success after that event. "After him" say they, 
"there never will be another John C. Calhoun to stand boldly 
up in the defence of Southern slavery." "The wish is father 
to the thought," and that it exists in high quarters I give 
you proof by naming W m . F. Havemeyer the ex mayor of 
New York, as one of those who has uttered those words. 
There is truth in them too! 

Some time ago, I was in hopes that the Republican party 
would have a majority of States in the next House of Rep. 
but with Florida since lost, Georgia and N. Hampshire 
equally divided, I doubt the policy of sending the election of 
president to that body in 1848. If the Republican party 
should have a majority of States, and were you one of three 
candidates before the House, I cannot doubt the result, for 
with the intelligent members who are friendly to you (no 
other public man Standing so high in the estimation of the 
virtuous and intelligent men of our party,) and the Whigs, 
who certainly prefer you to any of the opposing candidates 
of their party, your success would be almost inevitable. For 
many years you have been my first choice for that office. I 
know of no other man who deserves it so well of the whole 
country, but a crisis has arrived which enjoins us to take no 
step in that direction, unless we have light upon our path, 
unless we have a candidate with the popular prestige of suc- 
cess. It appears to me that the path you have indicated for 
the south, would lead to General Taylor for the next presi- 
dency. I think we can elect him by the popular Vote. In 
that event, God grant for the safety of the Union that he 
may prove to be all that the true hearts of the Republic 
anxiously and patriotically desire. 

The Hon. Dixon H. Lewis of Alabama has had a short 
sojourn in the city of New York. It is not my wont to call 
on public men when they are en route in this section of coun- 
try. I never did so when Jackson, Van Buren, Tyler, Polk 
and others of distinction were here, but M r . Lewis merits 
from me grateful consideration and I visited him twice with 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUK. 1125 

much gratification to myself. I regret that circumstances 
prevented me from evincing those attentions to him which 
would have afforded pleasing recollections to me. His frank- 
ness and kind heartedness are so evident as to ensure him a 
passport to the best feelings of every body. He went about 
our city and its environs considerably. I do not recollect an 
instance of a public man that left more favorable impressions 
upon those who came in contact with him than he has. At a 
meeting of the farmer's club, he descanted upon his own 
agricultural experience and observation, in a way that pleased 
many of the auditors some of whom have since highly com- 
mended the original yet common sense character of the Views 
he expressed. The Tammany Society learning that he was 
not an ordinary minded man, but one attracting popularity 
and notice, not only from the Citizens, but also from its rival 
body the Texas and Oregon association, sent a deputation to 
him with an invitation to become a brother of the Columbian 
order, which he acceded to, and was regularly initiated into 
that Society, the over twenty Sachems of which, are nearly 
all of the Van Buren and Wright Kidney. Strange as it may 
seem, the rival factions united temporarily on him to a cer- 
tain extent, and he became for a time, a sort of Lion to the 
two sets of Democrats; one set in favor of nominating him 
for the Vice presidency with Silas Wright for the presidency, 
the other set for him for the same office with Gen 1 . Cass; both 
sets calculating that a Vice presidential candidate from the 
State of Alabama, would be from the right section of the 
Union to run with their man, especially as M r . Lewis is well 
known as a friend of M r . Calhoun, of course, his nomination 
would draw all the friends of the Carolinian. As to the 
motives of either set, I confess my want of faith in N. Y. 
politicians, and could more readily believe that enmity to M r . 
Calhoun is at the bottom of these matters, that to work upon 
the self love of M r . Lewis, a common feature of all men, is 
not the most difficult method of accomplishing an alienation 
between friends. 

In connection with these remarks, it may be well to exam- 
ine the political characters of those whose names are attached 
to the letter inviting him to a public dinner. The list com- 
prises some of the best names amongst our merchants, but

he attributes to free trade principles, and the mighty results 
they are calculated to produce as regards personal freedom, 
political economy, and general civilization. I have seldom 
seen more sound doctrine, clearer argument, or better philan- 
thropy expressed in a few words, in short, it is a happy com- 
pendium of the whole. It gives great satisfaction and many 
persons have complained to me because I did not put their 
names to the letter of invitation.

The annexation of Texas with its cotton soil and Anglo 
American population was a measure of absolute necessity to 
the United States; not so the annexation of Mexico with the 
population she has. It was our interest to preserve her 
republican nationality equally from ourselves and from 
Europe. But now we must take her, in order to keep her 
from the hands of others, and we will become deteriorated by 
such a junction morally, while politically the Union of the 
States will not be strengthened. However we may want the 
lands, we surely do not need the incorporation with us of such 
a people of inferior mixture as the Mexican. We have started 
upon the course of conquest, we cannot now recede if we 
would, our success will create circumstances to impel us 
onward in that direction, whether we are willing or not. 

With the accession of several millions of Mexicans at one 
swoop with the vast increase of Emigration from all parts 
of Europe, the question presents itself, can this extensive 
territory and people ultimately 'escape the fate all monarchal 
and Republican Empires have fallen under? Namely dis- 
memberment.

Many of my friends and myself have long ago determined 
that if this narrow spirit of fanaticism continues at the North, 
and produces disunion, OUT homes will be found south of the 
Potomac where true freedom, chivalry and honour character-

conduct of many of our immediate citizens on this question.

Charleston August 23. 1847 

DEAR SIR your favour of the 8 th was duly rec d and before 
leaving for the North to day 1 propose to give you an outline 
of what we have done here since my last. 

We have distributed in the Slave states 2000 circulars and 
1000 subscription lists and have sent abroad 5000 copies of the 
Mercury (an Extra) of the 11 th containing an Editorial (writ- 
ten by Elmore) accompanied by the wilmot proviso and the 
resolves of 10 of the northern states in its favour with the 
Virginia and our resolutions on the other side so far as we 
have yet learned these documents have awakened the people 
and been most favourably received. 

a few days since we got together some 15 or 20 gentlemen 
as a sort of preliminary step to a larger meeting They all 
subscribed to a man and brought our subscription up to near 
$13000. 

Tomorrow a larger meeting is to be held (by special invita- 
tion not public) and I have no doubt the am* will be much 
increased a short time hence, a still larger meeting to be 
called in the same way is proposed. In the meantime com- 
mittees of correspondence are being formed to operate on 
the different sections of this state and upon all the Slave states. 
It is the intention also to send round amongst the wealthy 
planters of this state a special agent to Collect. 

while at the north It is proposed that I shall press the 
matter amongst the Southerners on there from all quarters 
and particularly in reference to a Southern Association or 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1129 

other organization which I will endeavour to do to the best of 
my ability. My address will be to the care of L. M. Wiley 
&c New York if you should desire to advise me. From 
what I see I believe we can raise in this state an am* sufficient 
to establish the paper say 30 to $50000. Some talk of 
$100 000. In fact there is but one view in this quarter. I 
do Relieve too that the feeling is becoming deep and widely 
extended all through the South and that with a proper degree 
of tact and energy that it may be embodied into a compact 
form and given the right direction. I believe if Maryland or 
Virginia would begin by establishing an association to be 
called ' 4 an anti-abolition association for the defence of slavery 
and of the rights of the Slave holding States and their Citi- 
zens ", that it would be taken up by the whole South and similar 
associations be every where formed with this organization 
all other parties and influences on the South would sink before 
its power and we could come up to the conflict with our whole 
strength brought to bear 

To my apprehension the two greatest dangers we have to 
encounter is our own apathy and indolence (which it is dis- 
tressing to behold) in the first place, and the danger of Com- 
promise when we have got into the conflict. It is unnecessary 
however for me to fatigue you with subjects you understand 
so much better than we do. 

A reference to the Missouri Compromise in one of our 
articles in the Mercury as the aim of our efforts was thought 
impolitic by some of us, and the force of the remark modified 
some in the original draft but another article contending 
that the violation of the Compromise threw us back upon our 
original Constitutional ground counteracted it in some sort. 

I have heard the name of Jno A Campbell of Mobile; R. W. 
Barn well, N. F Colcock and Yancey * of Montgomery spoken 
of for Editor. Yancey I think would be willing for it. The 
others probably not, tho' I do not know. The time has not 
yet come to discuss it

From Joseph W. Lesesne.^ c. c. 

Mobile Aug 24 th 1847 

MY DEAR SIR Since writing you last some of our friends 
have requested me to obtain your views, in anticipation of 
some action contemplated in our next Legislature, relative to 
the ground which ought to be taken against the "Wilmot 
proviso". There is a growing disposition among our friends 
to come out boldly against the further acquisition of Terri- 
tory as the only practicable mode of saving the south against 
the danger that threatens from this alarming question. It is 
a fact not to be disguised, that at present there is at the 
South a large party in favor of the acquisition of territory. 
An insane thirst after land is the great American disease, and 
divested of other considerations the party that hold out the 
prospect of Territory would unquestionably have the advan- 
tage. Nor would the means of its acquisition, in a moral 
point of view make much difference. To take ground there- 
fore against the acquisition of Territory even among the 
people of the slave holding States successfully, they must be 
convinced that there is no other mode of preventing their 
defeat of the question under consideration. 

Is it certain then, or highly probable that if the war results 
in the increase of our territory, the Wilmot proviso will 
become a law. If so, our people cannot be too soon convinced 
of the fact, nor can we too soon take measures to force the 
president to a course which will save us from ruin. It will 
be too late to act after the territory is acquired and the ques- 
tion of its free or slave character determined by Law. Under 
such circumstances I should not have the least hope that our 
people could or would take measures to deliver themselves 
from the distant ruin that would certainly await them. Indeed 
it is not easy to conceive what mode of effectual redress could 
be adopted. It would be a wrong beyond the reach of State 
interposition joint or separate. We could secede from the 
Union, but would that help us? Would it change or in any 
manner affect the territory over which Federal Laws have 
been already extended with federal officers to enforce within 
the jurisdiction of those laws the opinions and the objects of 
the victorious party. 

1 A prominent supporter of Calhoun in Alabama. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1131 

I regret to see in the Mercury an article, from the pen I 
presume of Col Hayne the tendency of which is to create the 
impression that the interdict of Slavery in the Territory 
would be harmless because unconstitutional and void. The 
writer did not probably intend this. He does not seem to 
have considered that whatever, in an abstract point of view, 
the rights of the Southern States rn&y be, the exercise by 
Congress of jurisdiction over newly acquired territory by the 
enactment of laws and the appointment of Judges Marshalls 
&c would have the effect of releasing every slave carried 
there, on a writ of Habeas Corpus just as much so as in the 
State of Pennsylvania where the Constitution of the U. S. 
has been practically nullified. 

I do not think that even in South Carolina the bearings of 
this alarming subject are fully seen and comprehended. The 
articles in the Mercury are very unequal to the occasion. I 
have seen nothing that approaches it properly since the ad- 
journment of Congress except the article in Bronsons Review 1 , 
which I am endeavoring to get republished in this State with 
the Laws and resolutions of the other States recently repub- 
lished in the Mercury. 1 would like to hear from you before 
this is done. 

I have again met M r Soule, who repeated what fell from him 
in our last interview and added again that "no public man 
ever occupied so high commanding and difficult a position as 
yourself. that if by the meeting of the next Congress the 
war was not terminated the elevation and peculiarity of that 
position would be still further augmented, and that he thought 
that both parties would be compelled to look to you as a coun-

From R. B. Rhett. c. c. 

Sept. 8, 1847. 

MY DEAR SIR You requested me, as soon as I heard from 
Gen 1 . Davis as to Gen 1 . Taylor's opinions, that I would inform 
you. I rec d a few days from Gen 1 Davis a letter marked pri- 
vate, which hinders me of course from sending it to you. It 
is of little consequence however, for it contains nothing dis- 
tinct as to his opinions, very like what you have seen in the 
Papers. 

Things are looking blacker in Mexico. If Scott triumphs 
handsomely however, I am still of opinion, that if no peace is 
obtained by the opening of Congress, the administration will 
fall back substantially to your policy. If there is any reason 
however, which may give such a movement the aspect of com- 
pulsion, they will not do it: In either event, as peace now 
seems out of the question, your warnings and counsil must 
give you a very lofty position. On the subject of the Wil- 
mot Proviso, the administration is doing all it can to settle 
the matter on the Missouri Compromise line. You see in this 
morning's Paper Buchanan's Letter on the subject. A friend 
of Silas Wright, informed me to Day, that he, had he lived, 
would shortly have taken the same ground. If so, it is to be 
lamented that he died so soon. Woodbury is open-mouthed 
against the Wilmot Proviso Cass following suit. I think 
therefore, after all it is not improbable that we will make them 
back out on this great point. At all events it is dividing and 
weakening the North, and if we of the South only act unitedly, 
our triumph is certain. The Anti-Slavery Democrats, Butler 
of New York, Hamlin 1 etc. must be driven off to the Whigs. 
Certainly since the foundation of the Government, there never 
has been in politics so silly a move as that of the Northern 
Democrats on this subject. Their leaders see it, but so many 
are committed, as to render a return to the right policy very 
difficult. 

On the point of closing the war, should it not be closed by 
peace by the Meeting of Congress, nothing will be done by 
the Whigs. Clayton Winthrop and Ingersoll 3 and others, who

soll of Pennsylvania.

look on the war as by no means much of an evil, since it will 
create a Debt, by which high duties will be maintained, in 
support of their Tariff policy, will not with hold the supplies. 
They with the Democrats generally, if the Administration 
determines to go on with the war, will secure the supplies. 
With this conviction I am doing all I can to induce the Admin- 
istration to take the proper course and propose a course 
themselves to close the war and 1 hope not without some 
success. If they do this, and can settle the Wilmot Proviso 
matter, the Democratic Party may carry the next Presidential 
Election. Woodbury will most probably be their candidate. 
Buchanan's course as Secy of State, and Tariff affinities will I 
think put him aside. Cass wants the confidence of the South. 
But if the War, and the Slavery question are not settled dur- 
ing the next Session of Congress, the Democratic Party will 
be defeated, and new organisations of Party will arise.

Mobile Sept r 12 th 1847 

MY DEAR Sra, ... I concur most cordially in every 
word that you say as to the retaliating course the South ought 
to take to bring the* northern states to their senses. Their 
conduct has been most atrocious. No language is strong 
enough to denounce it. The shameless impudence with which 
they have trampled the Constitution under their feet, and their 
mean and despicable contrivances to deprive us of our Slave 
property ought to be held up to the scorn of the whole Union. 
Not half has been said on this subject that ought to be. The 
Pennsylvania Law is bad enough, but most of the other states 
have accomplished the same end only by more cowardly and 
contemptible contrivances. The Laws providing a trial by 
jury for fugitive slaves are the most bare faced invasions of 
the Constitution ever committed. It is none other than a de- 
liberate attempt to manumit our slaves by withholding the 



1134 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

question of property from the jurisdiction of our own courts 
of justice. And a grosser insult could not be offered to a 
friendly State, for it assumes that justice will not be adminis- 
tered in them to a man claiming to be free, to one of its own 
citizens. I consider the South completely absolved from the 
slightest obligation to observe any faith to these people. And 
I do most earnestly wish that we had spirit enough to vindicate 
our dignity and rights in the manner you reccommend. Your 
observations on this point for the first time from any quarter, 
repeat my own sentiments entertained for years past. We are 
at this moment as deeply disgraced as any people can be by 
our tame submission to the wicked and perfideous course of 
legislation to which you allude. I do hope that if the Wilmot 
Proviso is discussed next winter in Congress, this other griev- 
ance will be unfolded and its iniquities printed in its true 
colours. Had any nation in Europe violated the faith of 
treaties in the same manner and as often as the Northern States 
have the even solemn pledges and obligations of the Constitu- 
tion, it would have been spurned from the pale of all Christian 
fellowship with other Communities. 

You speak of the advantages derived by the North from the 
Union. My dear Sir, no man South dreams of the extent of 
those advantages. He who would set down without the detail 
to prove it the annual cost entailed upon us by the Union 
would be pronounced a madman or a fool. Our whole com- 
merce except a small fraction is in the hands of Northern men. 
Take Mobile as an example J of our Bank Stock is owned by 
Northern men as large a portion of the Insurance Stock of 
the Companies chartered by our own Legislature; besides 7 or 
8 foreign Companies who do their business by agencies. Half 
our real estate is owned by non residents of the same section. 
Our wholesale and retail business everything in short worth 
mentioning is in the hands of men who invest their profits at 
the North. The commercial privileges extended by the Con- 
stitution has wholly deprived us of a mercantile class and 
thus deprives us (1 think) of the most certain means for the 
accumulation of wealth. Instead of the condition of Ireland 
being that which we may expect hereafter, it is in fact that 
which we now suffer. This little town pays 2 millions annu- 
ally for the reflected glories of the Union. 1 speak advisedly 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1135 

and from figures. If a swarm of Locusts should every fourth 
year settle upon our fields of Corn Cotton and rice and lay 
them waste we should loose less than we do from the causes I 
have enumerated causes not peculiar to this place, but in 
active operation from N Orleans to the smallest village to the 
South. Financially we are more enslaved than our negroes. 
But I am abusing your patience. When I am on this subject 
I know not when to stop. . . .

From Wilson Lumpkin. c. c. 

Athens Nov. 18 th 1847. 

MY DEAR SIR With feelings of deep interest and sober 
consideration, I have read your paper of the 7 th Inst. Your 
letter presents a correct, but brief view, of the external and 
internal relations of the Country at the present time and you 
are right in your conclusion, That the questions now before 
the Country are pregnant with the most vital and important 
consequences and the result beyond the Ken of mortal man. 
What ought to be done, in regard to our present relations 
with Mexico, I am not prepared to say. I am, however, pre- 
pared to say, that our National character demands an in- 
creased vigor in the prosecution of the War, to that Point 
which may be necessary to humble the pride of the Priest- 
hood and Military Chieftains of Mexico. Then the question 
will arise, what is to be the next step? 

The Annarchal Rulers of Mexico, being prostrated, the 
people will desire peace. But the whole letter and spirit of 
our Government stands opposed to conquering provinces to 
govern, or to that of conquering a country for the purpose of 
annexation to our Union. Circumstances might justify our 
wresting territory from an hostile Enemy, and holding it, 
peopleing it, and annexing it to our Union. But a Territory 
already peopled with materials unfit to enter into the spirit of 
our institutions, and become good Citizens, should never be 
annexed to our Union. 

On the subject of our internal relations, you present the 
case, as I conceive of it, Justly. The long, constant, and in- 
creasing disposition of the people generally, of the Non Slave- 



1136 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

holding States, to intermeddle with, and finally destroy and 
overturn our constitutional rights connected with negroe 
Slavery, must be resisted efficiently and speedily, or our Fed- 
eral Union will be dissolved. 

Our forbearance on this subject, has to my mind, already 
become intolerable. 

The Wilmot proviso is but one of a long list of our griev- 
ances on this subject. And we ought to make one general and 
consolidated issue of the whole subject. Our great and only 
difficulty is to unite and consolidate the action of the Slave 
holding States. Attempts made by States Single-handed must 
fail. If we cannot produce Unity and concert of action on 
this subject Then we may make up our minds to meet the 
most gloomy anticipations which your letter presents. And 
strange as it may appear to you, Yet 1 assure you that the 
people of no one of the Southern States, except South-Caro- 
lina are prepared for such action at this time, as you and 
myself deem to be, not only necessary, but indispensible to 
the security of the Southern States. Upon this subject our 
people have been most wickedly and awfully misled by Office 
holders and office seekers, aided by a Subservient press. One 
party, the Whigs, have deemed it their party interest to 
preserve a calm quiet silence, least a division might spring 
up between them and their Northern Associates, and thereby 
prevent the success of their party at the next Presidential 
election. 

On the other hand, the Democrats have labored long and 
hard, to convince their southern Partizans, That the Van 
Burens, Wrights, Casses &c. &c. was their shield and hiding 
Place from the coming storm. It is true, that daily develop- 
ments are stripping off this flimsy Vail of deception. But the 
minds of the large masses of the people are inveloped in thick 
and gross darkness on this subject. 

I trust I am not wanting in courage or Patriotism to do my 
duty on this subject. I have most faithfully endeavored to 
use the humble means at my Command to sustain those who 
are battling for the Country. We have many difficulties con- 
nected with the Slave question which are rapidly pressing 
upon us. To meet them as we ought, I concur with you, that 
concert of action is the first object to be obtained, and I can 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1137 

see no way of effecting this object, but by a Convention of the 
States interested. And if a plan can be devised and prosecuted 
to success, which will approach to a general feeling on the part 
of the States interested, I should indulge strong faith, that 
the heart burnings and strifes, on this Slave question, would 
ultimately be settled, and the Union preserved. But our Ene- 
mies will never cease in their Warfare upon our Constitutional 
rights so long as we keep up our Party divisions at home, so 
as to manifest to the world that we have more thirst for office 
and selfish Party ascendancy than for the constitutional 
rights of the States, and the true interest and liberty of the 
people. 

As they now stand, I am thoroughly disgusted with both the 
great political Parties of the Country. Both are under the 
influence and controul of a cunning selfish combination of 
Corrupt Office Seekers. 

They are ready to barter the most vital and sacred Consti- 
tutional rights of the people, for place and power. To be sure, 
there are many good men and true, attached to both Parties, 
but the influence of such are paralized by the overwhelming 
numbers of a different character. Nothing short of a thorough 
reorganization of Parties, can save our glorious Republic from 
destruction. 

If the Country is so far depraved That it cannot afford 
material for the leaders of an honest, patriotic party then 
indeed, will our days soon be numbered. And like Greece 
and Rome, It will be written, the United States, W A 8. 

I would not hesitate a moment, but move in the matter which 
you suggest without delay if I could be as sanguine as you 
seem to be, that good would result from the effort. Our State 
elections being over indicates the present as a favorable time 
for such a movement, it is so. Nevertheless, when I look over 
the Material which compose the legislature of Georgia, and 
consider the influences under which they are governed, I assure 
you, they are the last body of men in the State, that I would 
look to for a patriotic movement, at this momentous crisis. 

Look at our Congressmen, of both Parties, from Georgia, 
and you have a good specimen of the leader^, who at this time 
hold the reigns in the State. 
HIST 99 VOL ii 72 



1138 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Our best men in Georgia are now in private life, pretty 
generally disgusted with political life. Those however, who 
concur with ray views are evidently gaining strength rapidly, 
and I entertain no doubt will ere long become the dominant 
party in Georgia. I venture the opinion, that the actings and 
doings of the Present Legislature will greatly tend to strengthen 
the ranks of the Faithful and honest portion of the State. 
And if the Wilmot proviso, (as you anticipate) should receive 
the sanction of Congress, it will strongly tend to favor the 
views which we entertain. Indeed, the passage of the Wil- 
mot resolutions by Congress, I believe will be one of those 
wicked Acts which will be over-ruled for great good. It will 
enlarge the platform on which we stand. 

Should the Wilmot resolutions, or something like them, 
pass both houses of Congress, I suppose as a matter of course, 
the President will Vetoe them. If he does not, few friends as 
he now has, the number will be greatly diminished. 

You are not apprized of all that I have done, for a year 
past, or you would not suspect me of supineness in regard to 
the subjects which now agitate the Country. I am not idle, 
although no aspirant for notoriety. As far as my Circle 
extends, I have been very successful in exercising a salutary 
influence in Georgia. My position in relation to public affairs 
is universally known in this State. When the proper time 
shall arrive, I will shrink from no position which may be 
assigned me, in an attempt to get up a Southern Convention, 
for the Purposes suggested in your letter. The Slave hold- 
ing States have only to unite in Council and proper action on 
the Slave question and our opponents would be crushed at 
once. Union amongst ourselves would give us strength to 
face a frowning world. 

Your views may be sound upon the subject of retaliatory 
measures, as suggested in your letter, but my first impres- 
sions are not favorable in regard to their Expediency, or prac- 
ticability. 

I at this time strongly incline to the Opinion that the high 
ground, imperatively taken That we will no longer submit to 
the Variegated Violations of our rights Connected with our 
Slave property, or domestic institutions, by the Non-Slave 
holding States, would be the most wise and expedient measure 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1139 

for the South. And after due notice, upon the pledge of our 
sacred honor and our lives Maintain the ground assumed. 

No man loves or attaches more importance to the Union of 
these States than he who now holds this pen. But I desire 
the continuance of no Union which degrades me. If a new 
State would be Ejected from the Union On account of recog- 
nizing the institution of Affrican Slavery Then the Slave 
holding States ought no longer Continue in such a Confed- 
eracy of States. The repeated assaults upon our constitu- 
tional compact has greatly marred its beauty and symmetry, 
and to my mind it is most clear, that if the General Govern- 
ment cannot be brought back to the Constitution, this genera- 
tion will not pass away before the glory of our Confederacy 
will have departed. Write soon and write freely. 
As Ever your friend

From John A. Campbell. 1 c. c. 

Mobile 20 Nov r 1847 

DEAR SIR, I have but lately returned from a summer's 
excursion, taken with the view of improving my own health 
and as a part of the education of my daughter. I designed 
writing to you as soon as I could find the necessary time after 
my return but my health and other causes combined have 
prevented. 

In the first place allow me now to express to you how 
warmly and cordialty I sympathised in your opinions and feel- 
ings in all the measures connected with the declaration of War 
upon Mexico. The folly of that proceeding was so stupen- 
dous that one has hardly an opportunity to contemplate its 
wickedness. You must now derive in the approbation of all 
rightminded men in the country a compensation for the scur- 
rilous abuse to which you were subjected. 

It is clear to us, that the difficulties on the subject of Slav- 
ery, in so far as the action of parties and politicians have 
occasioned difficulty, are rapidly approaching the degree, that 

1 John A. Campbell, afterward well-known as a justice of the U. S. Supreme Court and 
as a peace-commissioner in 1865, was at this time a practising lawyer in Alabama. 



1140 AMEBICAN HISTOEICAL ASSOCIATION. 

a settlement will be soon required of them. Things cannot 
remain as they now are. The Wilmot Proviso is that which 
naturally excites most interest. I regard the subject of the 
acquisition of New Territory mainly as it may affect the 
balance of power in the federal government. What will be 
the effect of any large acquisition ? Will it be to preserve 
the balance of power as it now exists? The territory is 
wholly unfit for a negro population. The republic of Mexico 
contains a smaller number of blacks than any of the old colo- 
nies of Spain and tho' this is not conclusive yet it is a persua- 
sive argument that negro labor was not found to be profitable. 

Mr. Buchanan informs his friends in Berks that the terri- 
tory proposed to be acquired will never be used by slave- 
holders and Gen 1 Thompson tells us that the territory is wholly 
unfit for that population. These Gentlemen do not have with 
me a great deal of influence but I suppose in this case that 
they are not far from the truth. If this is the case all acquisi- 
tions of Mexican territory results in an increase of the strength 
of the nonslaveholding states and a corresponding diminution 
of our own. 

I have purposely left out of view the more general question 
whether a further extension of our limits is desirable. I sup- 
pose that if such an extension would result in a serious dis- 
turbance of the present action of the government of the U. S. 
that it is to be deprecated. 

The first consideration then for Southern men to take is, 
could it be used by a slaveholding community or would it be 
filled by a mixed population of Masters and slaves? My im- 
pression is that its population would be in a great measure of 
the free class. 

Let us suppose that I am in error and that the territory 
acquired might be used by a slaveholding community. Still, 
the largest share would fall to the nonslaveholding states. I 
take it that the line of slavery is gradually being removed 
southwardly and that the largest portions of the occupied 
lands above the 35 and below 36 30' of north latitude will be 
cultivated exclusively by a free population; and that the line 
above which slaves cannot be used to advantage will be found 
to be as low as the 34 degree of north latitude. If M r Polk 
should obtain the line that he proposed under the Missouri 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1141 

compromise the nonslaveholding states would be the largest 
beneficiaries. Looking then at the question of the acquire- 
ment of new territory as it affects the balance of power be- 
tween the North and South I cannot see any ground for a 
hope that we should receive an equal share of advantage. 

Regarding the question of acquisition in a more general 
and comprehensive view I still have been adverse to the 
acquisition. 

This war was not brought on by any act and I may say any 
fault of Mexico. Our President invaded a territory claimed 
by that Republic and over which its laws prevailed. Our 
armies met the armies of Mexico and assailed and defeated 
them. Our Congress before any notice of the fact of an en- 
counter and upon the loosest information makes a proclama- 
tion of war. We have maintained a very triumphant contest 
and have seized their capital. 1 confess that I do not find in 
any facts that have been presented a just ground for dismem- 
bering their territories. 

2. I have very great fears that the existing territories of 
the United States will prove too much for our government. 
The wild and turbulent conduct of the western members upon 
the Oregon question and their rapacity and greediness in all 
matters connected with the appropriation of the revenues 
induces great doubt of the propriety of introducing new States 
in the Union so fast as we do. The connexion of the Whig 
party with the Abolitionists has never disturbed me a great 
deal for the reason that the Whig party is governed by its 
leading and reflecting men. The tone of the party is derived 
from men of property and character and they are in a measure 
held to respect property guaranteed by the constitution and 
laws of the country. The union of the democratic party with 
the abolitionists I have regarded as far more dangerous because 
they are held by few restraints and are ready to go farther 
lengths to carry their ends. I have a similar feeling in regard 
to legislators from the Western states. Their notions are 
freer their impulses stronger their wills less restrained. I do 
not wish to increase the number till the New States already 
admitted to the Union become civilized. 

My opinions lead me to refuse territory. Suppose the 
point to be settled that territory shall be admitted. I wish it 



1142 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

received on no other terms than those of strict equality. I 
wish a counter proviso to the Wilmot Proviso to the effect of 
the first of your resolutions and with a definition of property 
viz. what the laws of the state from which a citizen may 
remove may define as property. And that this condition shall 
so remain until the people of the territory shall form a State 
and be admitted to the Union and this I would like to see a 
part of the Treaty of peace. 

The Wilmot Proviso I take it, will not be pressed upon 
Congress at its next session, unless it comes in the shape, of 
instructions to the President in regulating his conduct in 
making a treaty. I do not believe that the President will be 
disposed to encounter that question. He will place upon Con- 
gress the responsibility of determining the war and the 
propositions of Santa Anna will be the basis. The question 
will then be evaded by the Act of the Whig party and the 
Northern democrats. I have always suspected that the 
administration would not ask for a line to the South of the 
36 30' of North latitude and whether he asked it or not, I 
have always supposed that this War would terminate by 
securing no larger portion of Mexican territory than is found 
north of that line. I have done the President injustice by my 
suspicion. I am satisfied that the Northern people would will- 
ingly yield the land between the Nueces and Rio Grande and 
take California at least such would be the inclination of their 
politicians. 

It appears to me viewing all these things together that the 
true course to pursue is to resume as well as we can our posi- 
tions before the war commenced. The matters of boundary 
and of debt have to be adjusted and we must consider the 
expenses of the war and the losses sustained in our armies as 
the penalties the dreadful penalties of having selected an 
incompetent man to be our President. Do you think we will 
be taught anything by it ? 

We shall be asked to vote for Buchanan or Dallas in less 
than 12 months. I have read over with the most earnest care 
your letters to Messr 8 Lessesne and Walker, I agree with 
you that unless we at the- South have made up our minds that 
the solutions of slavery should be controlled by our enemies 
that the agitation on this subject should terminate. It is a 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 1143 

very great error it appears to me, to suppose that we have 
any party at the North, or that we shall ever have one. The 
politicians do not guide public opinion on this subject. They 
follow after in obedience to it. I believe that no where in 
the north would a Candidate maintaining Southern opinions 
on this subject be sustained for any great length of time. 
The sermons of the clergy the prayers of the lay members 
at the church-meetings contain deprecations of Slavery as a 
sin. The literary class now becoming large and influential in 
the. cities fill their writings with tirades against it. The 
Northern Press almost without an exception is opposed to us. 
And above all the colleges and schools are tinctured with the 
stain of abolitionism. I do not use the term in the sense that 
it is applied to Garrison and Phillips, but in a sense that 
embraces a very large proportion of the population. Garrison 
and Phillips say that the Constitution of the U. S. is a pro- 
slavery contract containing powerful and stringent secu- 
rities for the slaveholder. Phillips has written quite an able 
pamphlet 1 to prove this a pamphlet we might circulate to great 
advantage excluding a few paragraphs. They have collected 
all the debates together of those concerned in making or ratify- 
ing the Constitution to prove the same truth. Their remedy is 
to make a revolution. Now all this is better to me than the 
course of those other men who deny your rights or who dis- 
regard them while claiming to be the friends of the Constitu- 
tion. A very interesting statement of the condition, prospects 
philosophy and intentions of the abolitionists you will find in 
the report of the Massachusetts Society at their 15 anniversary. 
I made it a point to go over the different offices of publica- 
tion of the Society and to examine their publications. I should 
say that their Press was not very active. The office in New 
York is a poor affair. Their publications are of a low order 
making appeals to the credulity of the community by tales of 
cruelty and oppression of masters exercised over their slaves. 
There were two books of some pretension one by Dr. Barnes 
and the other by Dr. Bacon and these were the only ones 
worth speaking of in their collection. Their list was com- 
posed of about 15 publications of a low price. The Boston

office contained books of a higher order and in greater num- 
bers. The whole collection however was insignificant. I sup- 
pose That $500 or certainly $1000 would have purchased all 
in the office. You hear but little of this sect. They do not 
enter much into the general movements of society. The 
things which do affect the thoughts of men and consequently 
the movements of society are the various and continual con- 
demnations that this institution receives. The legislatures, 
anniversary orators and poets, ministers of the Gospel, teach- 
ers, all combine in impressing a fixed sentiment in the people, 
that slavery is a sin and a folly that it injures the country 
the master the slave. 

I fully agree with you that we should have no share in a 
convention to make a President tho' 1 find I am almost alone. 
The outbreak of the Barnburners in New York has given our 
people a hope that the party organisation will fall into our 
hands and we can make the President. They wish to profit by 
it. I confess a profound indifference to the election of any 
Democrat north of the Potomac. Mr. Woodbury even if he 
could receive a nomination would have no chance of an election 
and I think Ms election is not so desirable as to make us bend 
a principle to attain it. The Whigs must be infatuated if they 
fail to elect the next President. I shall be passive henceforth 
unless you have some counsel that can move me from that con- 
dition. I have done so much work in the way of disorganisa- 
tion that 1 feel reluctant to enter upon a new one and this one 
is thought to be wholly unjustifiable. I joined a Taylor 
meeting last summer. My object was to put before the public 
the principles that I approved on this subject and to prepare 
for a war on Messr 8 Wright or Buchanan in case of the nomina- 
tion of either. I see no motive for desiring the present organi- 
sation of the party and 1 wish to see the issue of events now 
before us before making a new one. 

I also concur with you in the opinion that we should put an 
end to this constant warfare upon Slavery. Already it has 
impoverished our credit and it daily weakens our moral power. 
Our states are fast losing their respectability. The tide of 
emigration flows past them. They are carefully avoided. 
Our people look to the future without confidence and our 
Slaves are emerging above their condition not in intellect or 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1145 

moral culture but in feeling and temper. They begin to 
understand that society is being moved on their account. The 
abolitionists profess a revolutionary purpose. They openly 
promulgate a design to subvert the Union. The other classes 
of the Northern people perform all the acts of the abolition- 
ists without avowing the same purposes. 

I agree too that a newspaper at Washington City would do 
great good tho' I fear it will ultimately fail for the want of 
subscription. I am willing to aid in the project. 

I have troubled you with a long letter for which please par- 
don me and believe me to be Sincerely

Cincinnati 12 Mo 4. 1847 

DEAR FRIEND ... I was in Louisville a few days ago, 
and Clay was at the same Hotel. 1 had two long conversa- 
tions with him almost without interruption on the leading 
topics of the day. He is thoroughly northern in his notions 
of Slavery; and thinks it will at no distant period be abolished 
even in tropical regions. He is however not well versed, 
either in the facts or principles of the question. He was at 
first impressed with the notion that Slavery would be excluded 
from any territory acquired from Mexico, and this by the law 
of nations until Congress by positive enactment established it 
there. He held that inasmuch as a conquered Territory must 
be governed by its previous laws until new ones were imposed 
by the conqueror, that therefore slavery, not now existing 
there, must remain excluded until Congress instituted it. 
But 1 observed that whenever the acquisition was made, 
Congress must pass laws for its government as a territory, 
and must either define what should constitute property in it, 
and thus positively exclude or admit slavery, or give to a 
territorial Legislature the right generally of passing all laws 
not incompatible with the Constitution and laws of the United 
States, and thus leave the question of slavery to people who 
should settle there. He maintained however that if the latter 



1146 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

course were adopted the South would be sure of exclusion as 
the population already there were Mexican and opposed to 
Slavery. But I asked whether the Mexican population were 
to be allowed to vote. He thought they would be of course. 
I replied that I thought they would not be of course. He 
finally admitted that whether Congress pronounced affirma- 
tively or remained passive on the question depended on the 
manner in which it was presented. 

By the way, what will the Administration do on this ques- 
tion in its policy of armed occupation ? If our army should 
be large enough to repress insurrection or prevent it, and 
our people are tempted to emigrate to Mexico, is the munici- 
pal law of Mexico to prevail, so as to exclude slavery? If 
so many of the Abolitionists and Proviso men will be in favour 
of armed occupation. 

Clays speech has not united his party in this State. Its 
leaders prefer M c Lean, and a large portion would prefer 
Corwin. But I think Clay is now predominant. I think he 
will find it difficult to hold Kentucky if a proper candidate 
is presented against him. His speech has enured largely to 
thy benefit, in that State as well as of course further South 
on the Slavery question, and every where on the War ques- 
tion. I admire the boldness with which he pronounced the 
preamble to the supply bill "a lie," and his rebuke of those 
who voted for it. As for his notion of a vigorous prosecu- 
tion of the War if Mexico won't make peace on his terms, 
many of his warm friends dissent from it and prefer thy 
policy of a defensive line, amongst the rest the Louisville 
Journal. 

I saw General Butler before he started for Mexico and he 
is yet in favour of a defensive line. He would take the west- 
ern base of the Sierra Madre which he thinks could be held by 
the regular army. And he prefers it not because he would 
insist on making it the boundary but because it would afford 
a margin for concession in treating for peace. 

I observe that the Union is attempting to under rate the 
expenses of the War, as if fearful that even all its glory will 
not reconcile the people to the public debt and high taxes fol- 
lowing in its train.

Charleston Dec r 8, 1847 

. MY DEAR SIR I rec d last night the letter of which the in- 
closed is a copy, and I hasten to communicate it to you. The 
M r Peters referred to, you know 1 think. He is a whig of 
the worst Sort being averse to any Movement adverse to the 
wilmot proviso. As he said nothing to my correspondent 
touching Gen 1 Taylors views on that Subject, I infer if any 
thing was said at all, it was not favourable to his (M r Peters) 
views. 

I called up at the Hotel the morning after you left, and 
then only learned you were gone. 

1 have encouraged our friends here to keep quiet for the 
present as to Gen 1 Taylor and all other Candidates for the 
Presidency and have written to Co 1 Hayne at Columbia who 
would see Co 1 Elmore advising them of the information I have 
(which I think is about the earliest) and recommending them 
to keep our friends quiet for the present. The feeling how- 
ever in favour of Gen 1 Taylor I perceive is Very, Very strong 
in his favour even here and it will I think increase rapidly. 
The sooner his position can be made definite with regard to 
us is therefore the better. 

When you write us it were perhaps better you should write 
1 st . with a view to informing our friends here generally as to 
the state of things and the policy to be adopted tofward] them 
and next to give some of us your views and wishes more fully 
in private, your own better judgment will however best 
determine. 

Very Truly Yrs

New Orleans 2 d . Dec r . 1847 

MY DEAR SIR. You are no doubt aware that General Taylor is here, or 
rather at the Barracks, six miles below the City. 

I have just seen M r . Peters, who, in company with several gentlemen, 
committee of arrangements for his reception &c, met him at the Balize 
and accompanied him to his present quarters. To M r . Peters he expressed 
himself openly and frankly, stating unequivocally that he is a candidate for 
the Presidency, and this position he intends to maintain, no matter how many 
Richmonds there be in the field or whatever may be their present political 
position or standing, and that under no circumstances will he withdraw. 

If popular feeling be any test of success, Gen 1 . Taylor is certain to be 
the next President nothing, I apprehend, short of Omnipotent power can 
prevent this result. 

Whatever may be the feeling towards other prominent men, it amounts 
to nothing, compared with the universal sentiment in favor of the General. 

What I now state in regard to the General's determination, is so direct 
that you may rely upon its accuracy, and those who scrutinize the effect 
of change may discover the probable influence such an event may have 
on the future action of the Government and on the prosperity of the 
Country. 

Yours truly

I greatly regret I did not meet you on your way to Wash- 
ington. You stated 3^011 would be in the City on 25 and I 
postponed my visit to the 29 th . My presence was necessary 
in Columbia on that day. 

I was exceedingly anxious of a long and friendly conversa- 
tion and on many matters which escape you on the sheet. 
The Political movements are pregnant with events. The elec- 
tion of Winthrop would argue more harmony in the Whigs 
than was generally supposed. Their Union will stimulate 
union among that wing of Democracy with which Carolina 
does not fraternize. The No Convention Anti Wilmot Pro- 
viso candidate is the man for the South. To you your imme- 
diate friends look with a fidelity which has never been shaken ; 
and in candor I was sanguine that your course on the Mexican 
war, the Oregon Boundary &c &c had placed you in the very 



LETTERS TO JOHN G. CALHOUN. 1149 

position which I have always desired to see you, the Indepen- 
dent Ante Convention Candidate. But Taylor will occupy the 
same ground; and his great military popularity (I dont speak 
merely of its availability) will be a serious impediment I fear 
to any movement for you on the same grounds, with success. 
Many of Taylors most ardent admirers and who are bound to 
him by other ties than military fame or political statesman- 
ship, are likewise your friends. They feel a divided influ- 
ence and these with others, and the People, in many cases will 
create a diversion probabty fatal to both. What are your 
views? What can be done to promote Union. I am individ- 
ually so opposed to the Spoil party ; who have more than once 
deceived us; that I can take no part with any other than an 
Ante Convention Candidate My preferences have always 
[been] and continue for you, above all in the Country but if 
your high claims are to be again postponed: let us know early 
the intentions; that concert of action maybe certain to secure 
the triumph of one who will not court our influence to deceive 
and who will stand by the guarantees of the constitution as 
the Political Bible of the States. I write in confidence, expect- 
ing a response in the same feeling. I have individually been 
drawn into, or reconciled to political movements in the past 
that my judgment did not approve of at the time. I went 
however with others with whom I have always associated 
politically, but they like myself perhaps now see how we have 
been deceived. I desire an early Answer. See Holmes. Our 
views correspond. 
Yours truly,

MY DEAR SIR. I see that the madness which rules the hour 
is increasing and seems literally to grow by what it feeds on. 
I have already spread upon the record my protest from the 
very commencement of this ill advised Mexican war. I have 

1 Gen. Waddy Thompson, a Whig M. C. from South Carolina from 1835 to 1841, who had 
afterwards (1842-1844) been minister to Mexico, on which country he wrote a book of im- 
portance, was now a planter at Greenville. (See Calhoun's letter to him of October 29,

no wish or purpose to publish another line on the subject. 
But if the suggestions which I now make have any weight 
they will be more useful in your hands than any other. Will 
the governments of Europe France and England especially 
consent to our subjugating Mexico? I have very many rea- 
sons for saying they will not some of these reasons not in the 
possession of every one. Can we prosecute the war if those 
countries interpose our supplies and reinforcements must be 
sent by sea. Their combined navies in the gulph of Mexico 
without a single soldier on land would at once put an end to 
the war. Shall we run the risk of such intervention and all 
the consequences of the conflict which will ensue, or the 
equally painful alternative of being forced to abandon the 
war? There will certainly be such an intervention unless we 
assume the debt of Mexico. If we take the foreign we must 
take the domestic debt also. That debt is not less than 100 
millions. Is the country worth this sum to us besides the 
annual cost of keeping in subjection an insubordinate and 
habitually rebellious people, a people indolent vicious and 
producing nothing for foreign Commerce but the precious 
metals, and this their single product costing more than its 
value? The same labor in manufactures or agriculture is 
much more profitable than the average labor in mining opera- 
tions in Mexico. To say nothing of the difficulty of keeping 
in subjection as a province eight millions of people. What 
history firnishes any instance of such a result? 1 know of 
none. To receive them into the Union is impossible. Such 
a measure would ipso facto dissolve the Union. To which 
segment would Mexico belong? And would that fraction 
have power to retain it? Before this war a majority of the 
people of the Northern departments would have been in favor 
of a union with us. I do not believe that one per cent of our 
people would have consented to such a union. How much 
more onerous and less desirable would such a Union be when 
forced upon Mexico. All the incompatibility of language 
race religion education and institutions will occur to every 
one. Is the country desirable per se, even if we could get it 
free from the encumbrance of its heterogeneous vicious and 
hostile population? 1 do not think that it is. I am quite 
sure that there is no portion of our own vacant territory 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1151 

which is not more desirable to such a population as ours. 
We have the authority of Humboldt that in the latitude 
of Mexico sugar and cotton will not grow above the elevation 
of 2000 feet on the whole gulph coast the mountains come 
down almost to the sea shore. I believe that from Mata- 
moras to Alvarado the average distance from the sea at 
which that elevation is attained is not more than fifty miles. 
On the route from Vera Cruz to the city of Mexico, it is not 
twenty miles. This narrow belt is generally sterile and pre- 
cipitous mountains and the worst climate on this continent 
the very home of } T ellow fever. Would any sensible farmer 
abandon the advantages of the "Valley of the Mississippi or of 
Texas for such a country. Beyond this narrow belt the land 
is generally poor and entirely destitute of timber, generally 
more sterile than any equal portion of the United States with 
which I am acquainted. But if it were otherwise, if well- 
timbered and as rich as the Nile, there is the conclusive and 
insuperable objection that there is not and never can be the 
means of transportation. Suppose a farmer having corn and 
wheat (and the grains are all that can be cultivated) one hun- 
dred and fifty miles from the sea coast will the price for which 
he can sell them pay for the transportation? The average 
distance will be more than twice that. If he raises stock what 
can he do with it? if he kills it he cannot cure it even on the 
table lands. The coldest weather even there is very much 
like our warm April weather, and meat can not be well cured. 
But if it could can it be transported by land two or three hun- 
dred miles and compete with the supplies from our inexhausti- 
ble west, which are sent by water from the very doors of the 
farmers. If they drive it to the seaboard and kill it putre- 
faction will begin before it is cut up and salted. These are 
no new opinions advanced novr for the sake of argument. I 
have always believed that Mexico could never become a great 
farming country for the simple reason that it has not and 
never can have the means of transportation to market. The 
climate is delicious and the country just suited to a lazy people 
like the Mexicans, whose highest idea of happiness is the 
"dolce farniente". What earthly good can come of diffusing 
our people over such an extent and sending them to a country 
where their labor will be so much less profitable ? But to us 



1152 AMEKICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

of the South it is positive madness. If it was proposed to 
annex Canada and the British possessions all would see what 
an overwhelming addition would be made to the power of the 
free states. It is not more certain that those states would be 
nonslaveholding than that these Mexican states will. It is 
nakedly a proposition to add fifteen or twenty non slavehold- 
ing states to our union woe to the Southern man who lends 
his aid to doing that. 

This Mexican country is the natural outlet to some extent 
for our negro population. If anything can prevent this it 
will be the erection of dykes to arrest it by planting non slave- 
holding American states on otir Mexican border. 

I do not design this as even a summary of the argument 
upon this vitally important question. All the leading views 
I know have occurred to you. It may be that some of these 
have not and I cannot give you a higher evidence of my con- 
viction of the deep importance of the issues involved nor of 
my respect for your course upon the subject than by suggest- 
ing them to you. 

Respectfully and truly Yours

From J. A. Campbell. c. c. 

Mobile, December 20 1847. 

DEAR SIR You have heard before this of M r . Lewis's x elec- 
tion and Col. King's defeat. As Col. King was bound up 
with the Northern democrats of a very doubtful order, and 
as he was the candidate of the Hunkers here, this was a 
work very well done. M r . Lewis I fear has made pledges 
which will greatly embarrass him and estrange his friends in 
this section. He pledged himself I learn to abide a National 
Convention for the selection of a candidate preferring a north . 
ern man. He pledged himself to sustain M r . Polk further 
than his message calls for support. 

In this he will not be upheld. You know what a rough 
piece of work we have had to perform in this state. 

1 Dixon H. Lewis was reelected to the United States Senate by the Alabama legislature 
on December 13, one of the opposing candidates being William R. King. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1153 

The overthrow of Van Buren and his dynasty has not been 
completed without an effort. With me (and I can say tho. 
same as to the most of our friends) the spoils principle was 
the great and cardinal principal in their party government 10 
which our hostility was directed. That principle had its entire 
force communicated to it by the use they made of the caucus 
system. I thought I observed a decided change among some 
of our friends upon my return in reference to that system. 
They supposed that the party organisation had passed into 
our hands in consequence of the movements in New York. It 
is not so. Even here in Alabama we can not defeat them. I 
tell you and M r . Lewis too that if Silas Wright had lived we 
could not have prevented his nomination except by the use of 
M r . Buchanan's name. 

It was a profound conviction of our inability to meet those 
men successfully with any democrat I could name that induced 
me (of course there were other reasons) to favour the Taylor 
movement. They (Hunkers) at once spoke of Woodbury to 
hush our mouths on the subject of Taylor. The plain reason 
of this is, that the Mountain democracy command the State 
and our politicians defer to their wishes. The whole of the 
talent of the democratic party in this State is with us but, the 
county leaders are not. And our leaders are unwilling to 
combat. They succumb continually to those mountaineers. 

The whole strength of the Hunkers of this State will be 
given to Buchanan. He is the administration candidate in the 
South. He expects the South to aid him against a Wilmot 
Proviso Northern man. How can we get rid of him? There 
is but one mode. It is for some public men to take bold 
decided ground against him. 1 will not vote for him myself. 
I will vote for no man whose foreign policy has been so shame- 
fully defective in sound judgment and whose personal char- 
acter is so equivocal. I refer now to his transactions between 
Gen 1 . eJackson and M r . Clay in 1825 and his assertion that M r . 
Polk was a better friend of a Protective Tariff than M r . Clay. 

What can we do ? Cass has taken so much pains o estrange 
us that it would be a pity if we disappointed him. 

Dallas loses caste from his connections with Polk. He 
seems to want position and character. 
HIST 99 VOL ii 73 



1154 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

M r . Woodbury has reached quite as high a place as Nature 
ever intended he should fill. He has been true to us. He 
can be depended on as a party man. 1 am willing to vote for 
him as a party candidate. Looking above the party can we 
hope any good from his nomination ? It would create a schism 
in every northern State in the democratic party. He has no 
hold on the popular favor. He has no public services to gild 
his pretensions. He was a prominent member of the Senate 
and supported the party creed and that is all we can say. He 
would be nominated as the Southern candidate at the North. 
Has he any popularity at the South? His connection as Vice 
President with a ticket having your name as President upon 
it induces some to think kindly of him. His fidelity in the 
Texas and Tariff struggles endears him to others. 

Has he any popularity with the voters? Could one in ten 
thousand repeat a single word that he has ever spoken. Is he 
identified with anything save the Pet bank S3~stern and Swart- 
wouts failure? If you encourage M r . Woodbury's preten- 
sions you may take my word, that you will only receive in 
return defeat. 1 do not think at the North he can unite the 
Barnburning democrats to him in any of the States and in 
the South he has no popularity. The contest in his absence 
is then between Dallas and Buchanan supposing Cass and Van 
Buren out of the way. In that contest Buchanan has the 
advantage all over the country. The signs point to him 
directly as the future nominee of the party. 

It comes then at last to this, what can we do? The perils 
of a party contest seem to me so imminent the introduction 
at Baltimore of the disgraceful scenes that were witnessed at 
Syracuse appears so probable that for one, I am disposed to 
part with a party organisation. 

At present there is but one principle on which it is sought. 
That principle is deadly to the Constitution and Union. It is 
to give full support to M r . Polk and his administration. To 
carry out the infamous design of destroying the nationality 
of Mexico. 

We cannot support M r Clay nor M c Lean nor Crittenden 
nor Corwin we cannot be transmuted into Whigs. 

We must find a man who will not accept a party nomination. 

General Taylor is that man. 



LETTP:RS TO JOHN c. OALHOUN. 1155 

In reference to the territory question. It appears to me 
that the Southern people will be found in a weak position if 
they insist on the acquisition of territory. 

In reference to that subject it appears to me that the just 
grounds, upon which to place ourselves is that we desire none 
and ask for none for the purpose of strengthening our insti- 
tutions but we will not suffer those institutions to be weak- 
ened by the action of Congress. If territory is acquired we 
insist on our share but we have no wish to make the acquisi- 
tion. I was pleased with M r . Clay's resolution of disavowal. 
It was of the same nature as your own opposition to the war. 
I have continually disavowed for the South and have indig- 
nantly resented the imputation of a purpose on the part of 
our people to spread slavery or any other institutions by 
means of this war. The impression has been industriously 
made upon the Northern people that this was the end for 
which the war was proclaimed. Your opposition to the war 
has been the most ready answer to such aspersions. We 
require vindication. We require a moderate and even a self- 
denying course of conduct in all matters connected with the 
settlement of the terms of the peace. Let us have peace we 
shall not quarrel about the terms. In having a peace with 
Mexico we must not transfer the war so that it shall reach 
our homes. I say we should have the Northern people to settle 
the peace as they like and to arrange the questions of territory 
(within proper bounds) but always with the PROVISO that no 
inequality should result. We should be the Proviso men, on 
that ground we should make our stand. 

I have written to New Orleans for the information you 
desire in regard to Gen 1 Taylor. 
Very Respectfully, Yrs 

J. A. CAMPBELL. 



From Francis 

Columbia S. C. 29 h . December 1847 

DEAR SIR, The class of which your son is a member has 
requested me to resume a certain kind of lectures which I call 

1 Dr. Francis Lieber, the famous jurist, was professor of history and political economy 
in the South Carolina College at Columbia from 1835 to 1856. 



1156 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Newspaper Lectures, and in which it is my endeavour to 
explain all the leading events and transactions as they occur 
around us, and to teach the students how to read the papers 
of the day with profit so as to extract and properly to deposit 
in the mind all that is important in this fleeting and perishable 
species of literature, reminding them continually of the two 
facts that what happens to-day is history to-morrow and that 
no history is more difficult to be got at than that of the 25 or 
30 years immediately preceding us. 

I requested your son to beg you to send us in documents or 
papers whatever you do not want. 1 will turn it to the best 
account according to my poor abilities. I know you will 
approve of my plan, and I beg to repeat here the same request 
which your son may already have communicated to you. 

I can only give the best accounts of your son. He is a gen- 
tleman and a student. 

Will you permit me to beg of you the kindness to send the 
enclosed to the address ? 

Why do so few Southern papers mention your resolutions? 
At least so it seems to me. 

In England I make little doubt but that in [such] a conjunc- 
ture as the present one in the Congress is, an administration 
must resign. Our Constitutional fabric does not admit or, at 
least not require it. 

I am with sentiments of high respect Your very obedt 

F. LIBBER 

P. S. I suppose I hardly need add that in my Newspaper 
Lectures I am constantly mindful that I am paid by the State, 
and have no right to use my chair for propagandism of specific 
and personal views, although I am aware that a professor is 
no abstract being no empty bottle, and that what he considers 
sacred truth he may not only, but is bound to teach; so, for 
instance, Free Trade with me. It is for the trustees to see 
that they appoint the right man as to vital points. I stand in 
this respect upon the same footing, I think, with our professor 
of Christian Evidence. He must not use his chair to preach 
sectarian views, but he can not float in the clouds of indiffer- 
entism above protestantism and Catholicism. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1157 

From Alexander Bowie* c. c. 

Fife, Tal a 19 Jan'y, 1848 

MY DEAR SIR, I am much gratified to learn, through M r . 
Bowdon a few weeks since, that he left you at your post, 
enjoying excellent health, and evincing all the vigor of your 
earlier days. If the anxious wishes of your numerous friends 
(of whom I claim to be one of the earliest, warmest and most 
constant) could perpetuate this condition of health vigor and 
usefulness, you would never be otherwise. I have been long 
desirous of possessing your opinions and views on some mat- 
ters of political interest; which I cannot well obtain other- 
wise than by a free conversation; and therefore, I am more 
than ever anxious to see you at my house. I have your 
promise to come this way on your next visit to Alabama, 
unless you should travel under circumstances which will com- 
pel you to take another route. As next summer will be your 
long vacation, I have great hopes of seeing you then. 

We are looking with intense interest upon the proceedings of 
your present session. What will be the end of the agitation of 
the Slave question? Till now, I have never dreaded it much; 
because I believed we had the power and the will to arrest it 
whenever it became absolutely necessary to act. Now, I 
greatly fear I have miscalculated the energy and spirit of our 
people upon this subject. If the question should, at this 
moment, be made, between submission to the claims of the 
abolitionists and the dissolution of the union, I am by no 
means sure that our people would not give up their unques- 
tionable rights, to preserve a union which would then become 
a curse instead of a blessing. At all events, I am confident 
there would be much division amongst us, even upon that 
question. You and I know, whatever others may believe, 
that the Nullifiers of '32 were the truest friends of the Union, 
although regarded by many, as its worst enemies because 
we sought to perpetuate the Union by preserving the Con- 
stitution. I have long believed that if the Slave states would, 
unitedly and firmly, take the position that they must be let 
alone on this subject, or they would secede in a body, all 
agitation, at least all worth regarding, would instantly cease. 



1158 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

I believe so, because I know that our friends in the free states 
are too much alive to their own interests, and too acute in 
perceiving where they lie, to be willing to surrender the 
advantages they derive from a union with us, for any advan- 
tage they could reasonably hope to obtain by continuing the 
agitation. I should like to have your views upon the prob- 
able result of this question, and particularly your opinion as 
to what will be the proper course for us to pursue, if the 
question shall be pushed to extremes. I can see no remedy 
but secession. I see by the papers that you have written the 
report to be made to the meeting of the Southern members on 
this question, and ask the favor of you, if it is printed in pam- 
phlet, to send me a copy. Please also send rne (or ask Gov. 
Fitzpatrick to send me) a copy of M r . Walker's report on the 
Ware-housing system. 

Shall we have a renewal of Whig measures with the incom- 
ing Whig administration ? If so, you will have to fight over 
again your old battles; and the Democratic party will once more 
learn to speak laudingly of you because they will have use for 
you. Whilst I always feel proud of your position of independ- 
ence, I often feel depressed on account of its difficulties. To 
be a politician and an honest man at the same time, is now 
the most difficult character in the world to maintain. I 
ought not, however, to rank you as a politician your aim is 
to be a statesman, and it is the only virtuous aim. I should 
like, above all things, to talk with you about M r . Folk's 
administration. With one exception (the Mexican War) it 
appears to me to have been about the best we have had for a 
long time. At least, he has come nearer fulfilling the pledges 
with which he went into office, than has been common of late 
days. 

I did not intend when I sat down, to trouble you with so 
long a communication. But I find myself, often now, afflicted 
with the proverbial garrulity of old age, and when I begin to 
write I hardly know when to quit. I know you will excuse 
me for making this draft on your patience, while I assure you 
of the sentiments of sincere regard, with which I am 
Your old and constant friend 

A. BOWIE.

From Henry Gourdin. 1 c. c. 

Charleston Jany 19, 1848. 

MY DEAR SIR, I wrote to you yesterday, and alluded to 
resolutions offered in the Senate by M r . Butler. 2 It seems 
that we had not a correct representation of them this days 
mail gives them to us as they were offered, and they appear 
to me to be right and proper, viz. to increase the Army by 
filling up the rank and file of regiments already in existence. 
This mode of increasing the Army would be in keeping with

Military Organization of the Army. 

In your letter to M r . Conner you seem to be under the 
impression that M r . Dickinson's resolutions 3 have not been 
noticed in the Mercury. They were very ably reviewed some 
days since, and I will endeavour to obtain the paper and send 
it to you. There was a very good article in it this morning 
also on the Wihnot Proviso and Gen 1 . Cass' opinions, to which 
I would call your attention. The two articles referred to are 
indicated by your two letters. If you desire that the papers 
in this State should continue to agitate these questions you 
should I think intimate, as far as you can, what they should 
do, or in other words on what platform they should stand. 
Thus far, all that has been said and done, has been merely to 
object to the various schemes put forward by Wilmot Dickin- 
son Cass &c. No scheme has been offered, or recommended 
by us, and unless something be denned our papers may run 
on beyond the point desired, and you may find them some day 
running counter to your own views and opinions, in anticipa- 
tion. We presume that your opinions are embodied in Mr. 
Yulee's resolutions viz. that neither Congress, or the Legisla- 
tures in the Territories, have, any Constitutional right to 
abolish or prevent Slavery in them. 

I give the substance, not the words. It would be an excel- 
lent thing, and very desirable, that some course should be 
determined on that the whole South would unite upon, and 
then, through particular parties having influence with the

Charleston Feby 4. 1848. 

MY DEAR SIR, 1 have to own rec*. of your favor, but can- 
not refer to its date as M r . Connor has it for perusal. M r . 
Bagby's resolutions 1 , and M r . Yulee's amendments, will be 
noticed in the Mercury in a day or two. 

A report has reached Charleston that Gen 1 . Quitman, 2 and 
M r . Dallas will be the Democratic candidates for President 
and Vice President. From all I can learn, Gen 1 . Quitman 
would be a more desirable candidate for us than any one who 
has yet been named. He was a Nullifier with us in 1832, and 
this is the best guarantee for his Southern feelings, and his 
States rights opinions. M r . Dallas is also the best man we can 
find in the North after M 1 '. Woodbury. The combination is a 
good one, and the party who has named them strongly urges 
their immediate nomination in the State. 1 do not concur in 
this move however, and have discouraged it as far as 1 am 
concerned. The combination is a good one; but can they be 
elected? My impression is that the Nomination, especially 
should it be first made in South Carolina, w d . be regarded as a 
Southern one, and that would be quite sufficient to unite a 
large portion of every partyin the North against it, while in 
the South, so great is the progress which Gen 1 . Taylor has 
made in Louisiana Alabama, and Georgia, that unless he comes 
out with some declarations which the Southern States cannot 
stomach, he will carry the South against any party or ticket 
that can be named. At the same time he would have a much

larger vote in the West than Gen 1 . Quitman. However favour- 
able therefore to the nomination suggested, we may be com- 
pelled ourselves to support Gen 1 . Taylor to overthrow those 
of our opponents, who, on the Slave question, are entirely 
opposed to us, and it would not be wise to place ourselves in 
a hostile position to him. Besides So. Ca. cannot make the 
President, and we have consequently nothing to lose by delay, 
and it would therefore be madness to commit ourselves to any 
nomination or party. Let others nominate; we will select 
and decide afterwards, as they may declare themselves. 

The nomination to which 1 have referred comes from Wash- 
ington. Pray have you heard anything about it? I have 
only heard it from one quarter and thus far regard it more as 
a feeler than any thing else. 

I am very resp y and truly Your ob fc . Sev fc . 

H. GOURDIN. 

There is little chance of any portion of our people or the 
press, committing themselves by any hasty nomination. I 
write the above, but with no apprehension of its being done, 
however anxious some may be to bring it about. M r . Yulee 
opposes, I understand, the Confirmation of the Contract made 
with our Havana Company by the Post Master General. Can 
you not put him right in the Matter '{ The Bill as passed 
required us to go into St. Augustine, which is impossible, 
because there is not water on the bar by three to six feet, and 
if the Post Master had insisted on an impossibility, the enter- 
prize must have been abandoned. Our Florida friend and 
M r . T. B. King of the House of Representatives are most 
unreasonable, and 1 do hope that their selfishness in this Mat- 
ter m&y not be permitted to be exercised to our iniury. and 
the injury of our Port. 

From Albert Gallatin. 1 c. c. 

New York March 3 d 1848. 

MY DEAR SIR The issue, on the subject of peace with 
Mexico, seems to be altogether changed by the contingent 
Project negotiated by M r Trist and submitted by the Presi- 

1 Albert Gallatin (1761-1849) Secretary of the Treasury under Jefferson and Madison,

His pamphlets on Peace with Mexico (1847) and War Expenses (1848) had a very large 
circulation.

dent to the Senate. The annexation of Texas was both 
expedient and natural, indeed ultimately unavoidable; and, 
whether annexed or not, it must necessarily be a slave hold- 
ing State, so long as slavery existed in the United States. I 
differed in opinion with you, as to the time and manner of 
effecting the object, under the strong apprehension that these 
would produce a war with Mexico. But now I am confident 
that we agree on the importance of making the project, the 
foundation of a speedy termination of the war; and of a solid 
and permanent peace. 

One of the great obstacles is the question of slavery; and 
it is highly desirable, that this should not impede the prog- 
ress of the negotiations for peace, and that, if practicable 
without committing either party, the discussion of that sub- 
ject should be postponed for the present and left open for 
subsequent consideration. I will also acknowledge that I 
have the most rooted aversion to the annexation of New 
Mexico to our Union. 

In the next place, without regard to right, and only in 
reference to a solid and permanent peace, I lay under the 
most intimate conviction, that the desert between the Nueces 
and the Rio Norte should be made the boundary between 
Texas and Mexico; and that if the lower part of the Rio 
Norte is adhered to, it will necessarily produce collisions and 
the renewal of a war of conquest. 

I have ventured to commit to paper my view on both 
points, and submit them to your consideration. My sugges- 
tions on the first subject may appear fanciful and appear im- 
practicable: and I hope that some better mode, having the 
same object in view, may be devised. On the subject of the 
Rio Norte boundary, I have no hesitation and feel that it is 
of paramount importance. 

But I pray that, on this occasion, [I] may be altogether 
kept out of view. I send it confidentially only to the six or 
seven Senators with whom I am acquainted (Exaltados ex- 
cepted.) 

Pleased to accept the reiterated assurance of my most dis- 
tinguished consideration and of my most sincere personal 
regard. 

Respectfully your obed*. and faithful Servant 

ALBERT GALLATIN. 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 1163 

From Jno. G. Tod. 1 c. c. 

City of Mexico, April 5 th 1848. 

M r CALHOUN, I have been mortified to find that the letters 
that I sent by the British Courier of the 13 th of Feb. had not 
reached New Orleans by the 9 th of March ! 

I sent you a half sheet by that conveyence, believing that it 
would go forward with dispatch, and that the news with us, 
about the Peace prospect, would interest you. 

The Treaty has arrived, and great difference of opinion pre- 
vails as to its probable fate. Those having the responsibility 
of affairs think we will have Peace in Sixty days, or less time. 
The truth is, that thus far all the efforts of the Executive 
Government to get the Congress together have failed; but the 
prospect is in favor of its assembling in all of this Month. 
Many good Mexicans, however, do not desire Peace, they want 
the Country to be occupied by our Troops, this policy gives 
them an assurance of security for life and property, and 
affords them a prospect of diminishing the power and influ- 
ence of the Church; which doubtless, is a greater Curse upon 
the People, than every thing else put together. The Roman 
Religion here is not what it is with us in the U. States. If it 
was not for some of its forms and ceremonies, and its pro- 
fessions, it might as well be call by any other name. 

The public mind at present here appears absorbed entirely, 
by One of those horrid Murders that that shock a community 
and disgraces humanity. 

Some twelve individuals attempted the other night, to rob, 
in the most thronged part of the City, an extensive Mercan- 
tile house, by going from the top of the adjoining building, 
and letting themselves down by a rope-ladder. The Chief 
Clerk, a gentleman of great worth, was Killed; the robbers 
did not succeed in getting any Money, as the firing of pistols 
attracted different persons and they fled; not however, in 
time for all of them to escape, as one, or two, were appre- 
hended, since then five or six more have been Caught. 
Amongst those already in Custody are two Officers, the 1 st 
and 2 nd Lieutenants of Captain Naylors Company of Penn: 
Volunteers. The Adj: of the 2 nd Regiment of Penn: Vols: is 



1 Apparently an ex-captain of the Texas navy.

also implicated, and they are after him at present. This hor- 
rible and lamentable affair, has done more to degrade the 
American Character in this Country, and will wherever 
known, than any thing that has occurred since the Declara- 
tion of our Independence. If the Texas Rangers had been in 
this City and these scoundrels had not been apprehended, I 
am sure that they would have been suspected, for they had 
been made the 'Scape goats for all acts of barbarity, as the 
Mexicans were ready to believe that they would do every 
thing, no matter how horrible. 

If you were in this City for one day, to see and observe 
the dreadful state of Morals amongst our Troops, you would 
not be surprised at the outrages committed here daily against 
society and humanity. 

I have always, on proper occasions, denounced the 'course 
pursued here hy our authorities, in legalizing Gambling 
houses, and places of resort called "Ball Rooms", which are 
mere receptacles for a profligacy and corruption unknown, 
since the downfall of Venice! Not one decent Mexican Lady 
would dare ever to think of going to a Ball here? And no 
American Gentleman, according to the acceptation of the 
word at home. Yet the rooms are crowded with our Officers 
Night after Night. 

As for the Gambling houses, there is a constant crowd, 
Sabbath as well as week days, around the Tables Colonels, 
Majors, Captains, Lieutenants, Grey Headed Men and beard- 
less Youths, Married and Single: hundred of Whom keep Wo- 
men, and openly appear in public with them. These things, 
with drinking, brings down the standard of our morals to a 
degree, below the conception of Americans at home. Our 
Generals, and superior Officers looking for political prefer- 
ment at a future day, do not possess the firmness and moral 
courage sufficient to discountenance, and rebuke the vicious 
habits, that are degrading the character of our Flag: and that 
is destined in time to roll back a tide of vice and corruption 
upon our Country, that will be felt by many, when the glory 
of this war has departed. 

Bands of desperate Men, Gamblers and vicious Soldiers, 
prowl about, robbing and murdering, extending their out- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1165 

rages to the Neighboring Haciendas All resulting from vices 
that have been winked at and tolerated by those to whom are 
entrusted the honor of our Flag. Many young men, who are 
the pride of their friends, and the hope of their Parents, will 
return home to bring down their grey hairs with sorrow to 
the grave. Like causes produce like results, and nine-tenths 
of the inmates of our Penitentiaries, and Criminals whose 
outrages shock humanity, terminated their career in the path 
that is crowded here to excess by our Officers. I say nothing 
about the common soldier. My desire "to see the world and 
study Mankind" never yet has induced me to visit the "dark 
places of the earth ", or the purlieus and sinks of villany, as 
shadowed forth in this City. Vice does not degrade the Mex- 
ican in his own mind, it is a part of his religion: but with our 
people, it is different. It makes us abandoned to all restraints 
of Society, and many who are now here, that were an honor 
to our country, would doubtless, if they were Sailors turn 
Pirates, when this war is over; but as it is, they will return 
home to add to the number of those who are a curse to any 
community. 

I do not wish you, M r Calhoun, to think that I set myself 
up as a regulator of other Mens' Morals, or profess the spirit 
of the Pharisee, but the outrages here at times, would make 
any Man reflect, who is not drawn within the vortex of dis- 
sipation. What is to be the result of it, God only knows. 
This is a Melancholy subject to write upon, let alone to send 
to a Patriot, and a lover of his Country. Yet it is well that 
the truth should be known at times, however disagreeable. 
Foreign Wars if conducted with results that seem likely to 
accrue from this, would so degrade an army, that they would 
be ready for any thing, that would give them "a lift" without 
the efforts of honest industry. 

I have just had a conversation with an agreeable, intelligent 
Mexican, who is lately from Queretaro. He is an advocate 
for Peace, but fears it would be a long while before it can be 
brought about, the President is doing all in his power to get 
the Members of Congress together, even sending them Money 
to travel upon, as the want of it was their apology for not 
appearing in their Seats. They have written back, that it

was not received! A party there, are for bringing back Santa 
Anna and make him Dictator, but it is thought they will not 
do so, until Peace is ratified.

Charleston April 13 1818 

MY DEAR SIR 1 have rec d your letters of the 4 th and 6 th and 
have lost no time in giving currency to jour views upon going 
into the Convention. The Mercury will in [an] editorial give 
the substance of your remarks in a day or two, but beyond 
this and the circulation of your views through private chan- 
nels we have thought it not advisable to go at present. In 
truth we are afraid to excite discussion or even attention 
to the subject knowing as we do the strong and decided 
repugnance the people have to a passive or neutral line of 
policy. It is not the going into the Convention that they are 
anxious for. On the contrary most people see numerous and 
strong objections to such a course but all concur I think in 
the propriety and necessity of definite and combined action 
of some sort amongst the Southern States and in which S C a 
will play her part and it is with a view to this result that the 
going to the Convention finds so many advocates On the 
receipt of your letter a Conference of a few of 3 r our principal 
friends was held here to talk the matter over and see what 
was best to be done to keep ourselves in position and at the 
same time prevent a division amongst ourselves, and they all 
admitted your arguments to be unanswerable as to a Conven- 
tion both in principle and in practice but they were equally 
unanimous that we ought to do something in common with the 
other Slave holding States who participate in our views and 
principles. This is the whole secret of the desire to move 
upon the Baltimore Convention, not because it is a Convention, 
but that the other Southern States are going there. Some of 
them with the declared intention of resisting any nomination 
and any move adverse to the rights of the South and particu- 
larly because it is thought some combined action of the South 
may then be adopted whose influence will be felt there and 
that may also be brought effectively into play hereafter

be glad to hear from you in reply as early as convenient. The 
paper was sketched off hastily by Co 1 Hayne with no other 
intention than of submitting it as a memorandum of the views 
he himself and others with whom he associated entertained.

If deemed best I think we may evade for the present any- 
movement at all touching a convention in any way; as the 
public mind is sufficiently occupied with subjects nearer home 
to them even this however depends upon accident. If a 
move is attempted l>y any person or persons of influence it 
cant be stopd but admitting that any decided move is evaded 
now it is sure to come at another time unless some definite 
mode of action is given to the people. They will not stand-

MY DEAR SIR, I have taken the liberty to send herewith a 
Eulogy lately spoken by me on M r Adams, 2 that I may ask 
your attention to that part of it which relates to the subject 
of Slavery. From the manner in which I have staled the 
issue of Slavery some of my friends have inferred that I lean 
to the Divine Right of that institution. I confess that leaning. 
But it is consequent upon comparatively recent and necessa- 
rily partial investigation, and I cannot yet fully justify to my

own mind the impressions which are forcing themselves upon 
me. I wish to have a settled judgment. From my position 
in this Institution, particularly as a teacher of Moral and Po- 
litical Philosophy, it is of consequence that I should have 
such a judgment, and that I should be always ready to give 
the reasons of it. 

Therefore I take the liberty, which, though it ordinarily 
becomes not an absolute stranger, I shall rely on your known 
candor and generosity to excuse; namely of asking you to 
refer me to any authorities within your knowledge in which 
the argument for the Divine Right of Slavery in general, or 
Negro Slavery in particular is soundly and learnedly drawn 
out. And, if it be not too presumptuous 1 would also ask the 
favor of any suggestions from yourself which should seem to 
you useful in guiding an honest inquiry into this very difficult 
yet consequential subject. 

If Slavery is of God the moral and religious people of the 
North ought to be convinced of it. Otherwise there will soon 
be no adequate restraint upon that levelling madness which is 
driving all things, the world over, as there is too much reason 
to fear, to a severe catastrophe; and not perhaps the least, 
though we least fear it, the people of our own country. 

I am willing to believe any thing that is true, and, on proper 
occasions to profess any thing which I believe. But I would 
not give out presumptions for convictions, or put the interests 
which I represent in false or doubtful positions. I want light, 
which, at the North, it is difficult to obtain except on the sur- 
face of the whole matter. There is nothing in our Libraries 
or Journals that reaches directly the essential questions. 
There must be minds at the South which have been diligently 
set to work, in this respect; and I should esteem it a high 
favor to be put in the way of obtaining the results of their 
inquiries. 

It has occurred to me that, if not now, yet in the recess of 
Congress, you might find a few moments of leisure, which you 
would willingly afford in giving me the benefit of your advice. 
I seek it only on my own personal account. Yet I have ref- 
erence to those public interests to which your life has been 
ably and honorably devoted. I should not thus venture to 
obtrude myself but for the profound respect with which I

judgment upon questions which effect the most comprehensive 
and vital interests of the country.

N. LORD, Pres* Dart. Coll. 



From R. K. Cralle. c.c. 

Lynchburg, June 3 rd . 1848. 

MY DEAR SIR: I thank you for the copies of your several 
speeches on the California Bill and the Yucatan Message, 1 the 
last of which reached me by the mail of Tuesday last. I had 
read Houston's report of it a day or two previously; and as a 
friend now attending the Superior Court here desired much 
to see it, I handed it to him on yesterday. He had heard 
from a brother lawyer of his acquaintance who had seen 
Houston's Report, that it was the ablest speech he had ever 
read. The questions involved are, indeed, presented with a 
force and clearness which surely must carry conviction to the 
minds of Congress, whatever course their subserviency to the 
Executive may compell them to take. 

I arn very glad that an opportunity has been offered for you 
to explain the true meaning, the intended scope of Mr. Mon- 
roe's famous cautionary protest in regard to European inter- 
ference in the affairs of this Continent. It was high time to 
put the public right on so important a question; for as gener- 
ally understood, as expounded by Mr. Polk, as announced 
every where by demagogues, it certainly was made to assume 
higher grounds than foreign Powers would be disposed to 
grant. I have heard much of it before, and never could fully 
comprehend on what principle so sweeping a claim could be 
dc fended. The wonder is that, being so often and so needlessly 
dragged into notice, in the State papers of the last twenty 
years, England has not, before this, inquired l>y what authority 
we say these things. 1 suppose no fit occasion has occurred to 
ask an explanation. But is it not likely that the recent treaty, 
convention, or manifesto, which I see published to day, in 

i Works, IV, 454-479, 
HIST 99 VOL II 71 



1170 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

which England claims the protectorship of the Mosquito 
Shoals, and, as such, dictates terms to the government of 
Nicuragua, will bring the question more fully before the 
world ? I remember, while you were in the Department of 
State, that some question arose as to the Course the British 
Government had adopted in order to get the control of the 
Country; and that you expressed some dissatisfaction at its 
proceedings. As well as I remember, some Indian of the 
Country, assumed to be of royal descent, was taken to 
Jamaica and educated and then placed in the formal posses- 
sion of the Country; and who, in return for the favour, gave a 
sort of political lien on his territories. The particulars have, 
in some measure, escaped my memory; but these were the 
main points. You can ascertain them more in detail by call- 
ing on the Department, should M r Polk make further demon- 
strations of his beligerent propensities. By the bye, this sub- 
ject seems to me to be of far more importance than that of 
Yucatan; for if the Treaty be in fact, a veritable matter, it 
warrants the inference that England, looking to our future 
acquisitions in the South, is determined to erect a barrier 
across the Isthmus of Darien, extending from the Atlantic to 
the Pacific, and to secure the communication between the two 
by means of the Lake and the River San Juan. This commu- 
nication I believe you thought impracticable on account of the 
extreme unhealthiness of the climate from the Lake to the 
Atlantic. But the movement, if it has been made or sanctioned 
by the Government, would seem to authorize a different con- 
clusion. 

The Baltimore nominations 1 have been received here with a 
good deal of sang froid. No exultation no enthusiam has 
been exhibited. The ticket is, in itself, a weak one; but by 
force of the Party machinery it will carry the State unless the 
Philadelphia convention 2 show some common sense, which I do 
not expect from them. I have published an article in the 
Paper which I enclose herewith, addressed to them, on the sub- 
ject, but which I can hardly expect will have any the least 
influence. Numbers have been forwarded to many influential 
members of the Party; for the Proprietors of the Virginian,

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1171 

as well as the rank and file here would be very glad to see its 
recommendations carried out by the Convention. In my opin- 
ion there is no other prospect of success either in this State or 
the Union. Unless they select some man, without Party 
pledges, they will be signally defeated. Taylor may, but you 
certainly would carry the election. But, as I have observed, 
the Leaders of the Party will demand the previous promise of 
the Spoils, which I know you will not give. But what will 
they do? As to M r . Webster, M r . Crittenden, Mr. Clay or 
Judge M e Lean, I do not see how they can indulge the slight- 
est hope of success. And yet these present the only chances 
for a strictly Party triumph, and if they are forced to surren- 
der that they must be forced to unite either on you or Genl. 
Taylor; and such is the feeling existing between the friends 
of Clay and Taylor, that each, I suspect, would prefer you to 
the other. But a few days will determine. 

I am very curious to know what effect the nominations have 
produced on Messrs. Buchanan, Woodbury and their friends, 
and what part Walker and Dallas are playing. The two last, I 
doubt not, have kept the first pretty well hobbled for the last 
three years. Benton, I imagine, is thoroughly estranged. A 
gentleman lately in his company, informs me that he was 
become outrageous; and that, in speaking of you as likely to 
be brought before the Baltimore Convention, he broke out in 
his ordinary tone, "No-, Sir, no. Calhoun is too great a man- 
he is too pure a man ever to get the support of this miscalled 
Democratic Party." These are strange sentiments, indeed, 
coming from such a quarter. He spoke freely of the Party 
and its Leaders denouncing both vehemently. Verily there 
is nothing new under the Sun if this be not. 

I have not seen a detailed statement of the proceedings of 
the Baltimore Convention, and should be much obliged, if you 
should receive an extra copy, to have one for reference. I 
hear to day that in the latter end of the feast, there had nearly 
been the beginning of a fray, and that some resolutions affect- 
ing the subject of Slavery were very ominously negatived by 
the majority. And in this connection it occurs to me to call 
your attention to a late speech of Gen 1 . Bay ley, which seems to 
me to assert some most dangerous doctrines; and Mr. Rhett or 
some other Southern man ought to answer him at length. Has

he gone over to the enemy? He sent me his Speech, and 1 intend 
at my first leisure to call the attention of the public to it, for

Sherwood Forest Ch s . City C ty . in V a . June 5, 1848 
MY DEAK Sm, I thank you for the National Intelligencer 
containing your speech on the Yucatan question, which I have 
read with all the attention and interest with which 1 invaria- 
bly do whatever proceeds from you. This Yucatan affair is 
quite an awkward one in any aspect in which it can be regarded. 
If that Province is to be looked upon as part and parcel of 
Mexico, then pending the war between that country and this, 
the insurrection which has arisen may be considered as actually 
favorable to us, while to take military possession would not 
only be useless, but would augment the difficulties of a final 
adjustment. If Yucatan claims to be an independent power 
and the U. States upon her solicitation, moves in the matter, 
such movement is equivalent to a recognition of her inde- 
pendance, and furnishes new motive to hatred on the part of 
Mexico. Is that country in a condition to be thus recognized? 
Is the Spaniard or the Indian in the mastery? You will 
remember that a somewhat similar case occurred during our 
time in regard to St Domingo. The Spanish portion of the 
Island claimed to be independant of the black sway, and 
appealed to us to be recognized sovereignty, asking our favor 
and protection. I believe moreover that it was ready to make 
an unconditional transfer of itself to the U. States. Our 
sympathies were strongly enlisted in its behalf, but we did not 
feel ourselves called upon to obey those S3^mpathies or to 
involve ourselves in the quarrell. I think the principle of 
policy which has been observed by the gov* through all time, 
not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, per- 
fectly sound, and I should require a case of commanding 
character to induce its abandonment. I should certainly not 
wish to have G. Britain occupying any new position on this

Continent which would give her any additional controul over 
our trade and commerce, but I apprehend on her part no such 
interference except upon the express request of Mexico. The 
surrender of the countiy so soon as the disturbances should 
be quieted would seem to follow as a necessary consequence. 
Your explanation of M r . Monroe's declaration is exceedingly 
valuable. It was necessary to the truth of history. I confess 
I never before fully understood it. The measures set forth 
in your speech for your advocacy of Texas annexation are 
fully sufficient to justify the adoption of that measure, but I 
confess to the fact that the answer made by Sir Ro. Peel to 
M r . Everetts enquiries as to the propositions made by certain 
persons to G. Britain for pecuniary aid in order to procure 
the emancipation of slaves in Texas, decided me on the ques- 
tion as it did our lamented friend M r . Upshur. While the 
British minister admitted that such proposals had been made, 
and declared that they had not been countenanced, he never- 
theless took occasion \in substance, also to say that the B. gov*. 
would lose no opportunity which might arise, at any time or 
any where, to urge the subject of emancipation and would 
exert its best efforts to accomplish it. Seeing then the 
depressed condition of, not only Texas but Mexico, I could not 
but consider both the one and the other as accessable to her 
intrigues and open to her policy. The considerations urged 
by you in your speech were regarded by M r . Upshur and 
myself as inconceivably augmented in the event that this 
declaration of Sir Ro Peel should with zeal and industry be 
carried into effect, through the instrumentality of a treaty of 
peace between Mexico and Texas. A constant border war 
would have prevailed in the efforts on the one part to arrest 
persons flying from labor from Louisiana to Arkansas, and. 
leading to open resistance on the other. And ultimately to 
war with Texas Mexico and Great Britain on the one side and 
the U. States on the other. Such a treaty as I have alluded 
to would have given to G. Britain an absolute controul over 
the trade of Texas under the stipulations of a commercial 
treaty then easily to be made and in a short time have 
relieved her from all dependance upon us for the supply of 
cotton. Annexation secured us against these contingencies if 
it shall have done no more, and for one whatever of vitupera-

Columbus June 7 th '48 

DEAR SIR We have seen enough of political conventions to 
regard them in almost any other light than safe exponents of 
the public will. Neither of the great parties can justly claim 
for their representatives immaculacy in the announcement in 
the will of the party altho' 1 did not expect much from our 
convention I was still disappointed at the feeble support given 
to M r Woodbury and really chagrined that he should have 
met with so little favor from the South. In this abandon- 
ment of Woodbury I feel certain our delegations from the 
South cannot justify themselves from the feelings of their 
constituents. I will not do injustice to M r Cass if I know it, 
but the estimate 1 have placed upon his political character 
forces me to the conclusion that he is an unsafe man. I fear 
he is a mere party majority man, if his party upon a great 
question should be right, he would be right. And if the 
party should be wrong he might be then expected to be wrong 
also. I dread the influence of the majority of his electors if 
elected at all. We may do better possibly by looking around 
a little before we give way to the alternative of taking him 
on the one hand or submitting to the triumph of the whigs 
on the other. The whig convention will have made their 
nomination before this reaches you. we cant of course sus- 
tain their candidate because if elected by them, he will belong 
to them. If M r Clay, Crittenden, M c Clean [McLean], or 
Scott should be chosen, Gen 1 Taylor being already in the Held 
will be run and though he is unquestionably very deficient in 
qualification, his location connected with the circumstances of 
being rejected by the whigs makes him a safer candidate for 
the South, and the real constitutional party of the country 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1175 

than Gen 1 Cass. I have therefore in such event determined 
to support him. But if the Southern whigs should prevail in 
the convention as I think they will and force Taylor on the 
whig party he will be in such bad hands that no democrat 
ought to trust him. Moreover if he receives the whig nomi- 
nation and no other candidate is presented he will beat M r 
Cass and beat him badly. In this emergency I propose a bold 
and prompt movement the chance of success is remote it is 
true, but not chimerical. It is to announce you as a candidate 
for President and M r Woodbury for vice president. We can 
have the ticket started in Georgia, not with the slightest pros- 
pect of success but for the purpose of saving Carolina and New- 
hampshire from taking the initiative. Our ticket of course would 
command a meagre support very meagre, when both parties 
are pledged to their nominations, but Carolina and perhaps New- 
hampshire too would elect you and may we not from the 
stubborn opposition of all New England to Taylor expect 
some aid in that quarter, if no other in all probability our 
example might bring out Webster, Clay being mortified at 
the choice of Taylor against a decided majority of the North- 
ern whigs would interpose no objection to his defeat and 
might also in this general breaking up of the party (which he 
says has been prophecied in the event that himself was not 
indicated as the head) consider himself justified in bringing 
the election into the house. If Taylor is nominated a large 
body even of Southern whigs who want Clay will consider 
themselves absolved from any obligations, because Gen 1 Tay- 
lor has declared himself a candidate independent of their con- 
vention. The elements of discord will run high, and the true 
constitutional men may profit beyond their expectations by a 
bold and decisive movement. If we move at all we should do 
it promptly, before parties settle down in submission to the 
dictation of their leaders. I remarked we would start the 
ticket in Georgia, but it would be better for your friends in 
Newyork to lead oif, in this crisis; it would have more 
influence, but if they will not act promptly we though few 
in number can do it here. I know nothing of M r Woodburys 
feelings since he has been spoken of for the Presidency, he 
might not now be willing to run where I have placed him, 



1176 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

you I presume though will be able to inform me and if he 
will not then let us take Quitman, Persifer Smith 1 Buckhannan 
if he will accept it or any other prominent man either civil or 
military who could bring proper aid to the ticket. 

I repeat the position which I have laid down, that if Gen 1 
Taylor is nominated by the whigs that he will succeed over 
M r Cass if no other candidate is brought out, and the only 
way the country can escape a whig triumph in the event of 
Taylors nomination is to bring the election into the house, by 
which nry plan can certainly do no harm to the democratic 
party and may result in much good. As I feel great confi- 
dence that if you were returned to the house even by a very 
low vote, that you would there be chosen in preference to 
Cass or Taylor. The free exercise of the elective franchise 
demands that these conventions should be broken down, I 
would greatly prefer seeing twenty candidates for President 
than one nominating convention, and the sound public voice 
of the country will approve of the independence of the man 
who puts his face against their partizan purposes, or more 
properly their purposes of individual and selfish preferment, 
if we break down the power of the convention by supporting 
Taylor if the whigs should lay him aside, or yourself in the 
event Taylor should be nominated we will in either case do 
essential service to the people of this government, by restor- 
ing to them their right of voting. Our preferences under 
the present odious system are smothered and we are not even 
allowed to give them utterance, all to avoid an ultimate choice 
by the house of representatives, which though to be avoided, 
if the will of the people could be as well expressed through 
another channel, still has the advantage of constitutional 
approbation and [is] in no way more objectionable than the 
present swindling system. If we act at all, we must act 
promptly. 

Yours Respectfully and friendly

DEAR SIR: We have at last started. We have consulted 
sufficiently to effect a start. Taylor's position in the late 
Whig convention has thrown into our arms all those Demo- 
crats who were for him heretofore. Reiser resigns his place 
on the Taylor electoral ticket. Campbell of Mobile quits his 
Taylor ground and is with us. Here, Goldthwaite, Elmore, 
Mayo, Semple, Harris, Belser and kindred spirits are with 
us. We are raising funds to establish a press here. In that 
we need aid; but we will publish it at all hazards. We will 
address the people in a manifesto very soon, this week. We 
will call a mass convention here on the 12 July. At that con- 
vention we will nominate the ablest and purest electoral ticket 
ever put into the field in this State. But upon whom shall 
we rally for President? Tazewell and Jeff Davis are sug- 
gested here? Will they do? Will you write to Tazewell for 
us ? and write me fully your opinions ? The skies are bright- 
ening. I was despondent a week ago, I am hopeful now. 
We are all so. We will move in force and effectively.

MY D r . SIR Since I have witnessed the hostile feeling of 
Europe, particularly of England towards the institution of 
slavery, I have looked with much anxiety to the future in my 
own country. Our destiny must abide Public opinion. The 
tide of Public opinion has been setting against us all over 
Europe, and we have never made an effort to check or aid its 
ultimate formation. While the Northern fanatic disseminates 
his falsehoods over the whole world we have not a Journal

that reaches beyond the limits of the United States to contra- 
dict and convict him. I made a slow tour through Europe to 
this place two years ago, and conversed with a great many 
English and French. Since I have been here, my opportu- 
nities have been no less frequent; and 1 have never conversed 
with one individual who had any idea of the relative position 
of master and slave, of their treatment &c; and I have seldom 
left a man whose opinions and feelings were not entirely 
changed, or who was not brought to doubt whether the insti- 
tution of slavery was not a blessing. The subject has been 
invariably introduced, and the information sought after by 
them. 

The deplorable condition of agriculture in the hot climates 
of Europe Asia Africa and America, when black slave labour 
is not employed, illustrates one fact, that no white man can 
labour in tHe hot sun of the South, and the/m? Hack man will 
not. The West Indies, at the present moment, is a lesson to 
the world if they w T ill read it. 

The experience I have had in the cultivation of Cotton in 
Turkey satisfies me that Cotton cannot be made without loss, 
if controlable labour is not used. And that is the extent of 
slavery in America. 

The whole of Europe has ever demonstrated the fact that 
inasmuch as the white labouring population cannot be educated, 
and, even in the most degraded state of ignorance ever sensible 
that they are born equal, and not destined by the Creator to be 
always menial, they are ever on the lookout for change, at any 
hazard. The consequence is easily seen, that in all warm 
climates, where the poor are always indolent, ignorant vicious 
and miserable there has been and will be revolution after revo- 
lution to the end of time. Temporarily they have and can be 
kept down by despotic Governments, but this seems now [to 
have] passed. The Negro knows, acts and feels that God has 
put a mark of inferiority upon him and this of itself secures 
his individual satisfaction and happiness. 

Such facts with the comparative exemption from riot and 
disorder, and the acknowledged superiority of the educated 
class in Slave compared with other Countries, have never failed 
to produce a strong impression on those I have met with, in 
favour of the institution of slavery. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. OALHOUN. 1179 

We have had in Constantinople for some time past M r . C. 
M c farlane of England, 1 of literary reputation, a man alike dis- 
tinguished for his general information, for his good sense, and 
his English politics. He is a thorough Englishman and will 
sustain English institutions in England while he admires Amer- 
ica, and would never wish to see her Government and institu- 
tions changed. He has ever held the same opinions as your- 
self on the subject of slavery. And for the sake of ^drawing 
England and America nearer together, and perpetuating by 
mutual interests and combined power their great and liberal 
institutions, he is determined to wage war against all fanati- 
cism, to oppose abolitionism in the North, as he has ever con- 
demned emancipation in the West Indies. I have , suggested 
to him and my Brother N. H. Davis now here, an enterprise 
certainly of no small importance to our country, and one which 
demands your cordial support viz. to establish an Anglo Ameri- 
can paper in London, which is to be the organ of the South on 
this great subject, as well as of Agriculture, Politics, Com- 
merce and Literature. 

I am well assured a more suitable person than M r M c farlane 
could not be found on the English side. My Brother if he is 
not himself equal to the task will secure equal abilities from 
America: but he is of the Carolina school, and looking upon 
it as a project of great magnitude, he will abide a conference 
of persons entirely cooperating in this enterprise. I therefore 
beg your plan of its organization sent here as soon as possible. 

MCfarlane thinks that when once started by the People of 
the South, Merchants and Planters, and recognized as author- 
ity, it will become a mighty engine in Europe and that a large 
number of persons of influence are now staggered by the con- 
dition of Europe and the West Indies. They consider this 
apprenticeship a "specious pretext" and are willing to listen 
to reason. 

Very respy. yours &c

From Fitzwilliam Byrdsall. c. c. 

New York July 31 st . 1848 

DEAR SIR, I perceive with great mortification that the defeat 
of the Senate Territorial Bill in the house, was accomplished 
by 8 votes from the Slave States. That any 8 members of any 
party from that section of the Union, could be found to Vote 
against a measure so essential at this crisis, not only aston- 
ishes, but shocks all those feelings connected with the preser- 
vation of the co-equality of the States. If those 8 men only 
knew the state of fanatical sentiment in this section of the 
Country, they would rather suffer any odium than have voted 
to give not only a fresh impetus, but an increase to a move- 
ment of the most fearful portent to the Southern States. 
When any of those 8 men meet Phelps of Vermont, or Birdsall 
of this State, they should feel ashamed enough to wish the 
ground to sink and cover them up. Surely, surely they can- 
not be aware of the crusade that is now increasing against the 
institution of Slavery to a most fearful magnitude in the free 
States. Even in the New York Custom house there is a strong 
majority of the Officials, Clerks &c in favor of the Wilmot 
proviso. Among the Citizens too, it is a common objection 
that Slaves enter into the Representative basis of the lower 
house of Congress. This is continually dinned in my ears, 
both by zealots and moderate men. I meet this objection by 
the correct remark that as in the north and free states, men, 
women, aliens, free negroes, and all persons count equally in 
apportionment for members of Congress So in the South 
should all persons whether Slaves or free be equally counted 
in the representative basis, and that the three fifths arrange- 
ment instead of being a Concession to the Slave States, was in 
fact a concession to the north. But what is truth against 
prejudice? 

If the South cannot maintain its equal rights to the terri- 
tory of the United States here then we have the beginning 
of the end. There is no Constitutional right of the Southern 
people clearer than their right to go with their property of 
any kind into the territories of the Union. A man from the 
North, or from the East, the West or the South, carries with 
him through the new territories all the rights of person and 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1181 

of property which he had in the State he left, so far in extent 
as the same rights are not contrary to the Constitution of the 
United States. When the territory becomes sufficiently popu- 
lous to form a State then the people will have the Sovereignty 
of State Rights and not before. In the meantime the General 
Government is bound to protect the settlers from the north or 
the South, in all their rights of person and of property. But 
Congress has no authority to give the right of Voting in Con- 
quered territory to Indians, negroes, or mixed breeds, in 
making constitutions or laws to Govern. This appears to me 
to be common sense View of the Subject. 

If the Southern people cannot maintain their equal rights 
as to their settling in new territory, what other rights under 
the Constitution can they maintain ? If defeated on the Wilmot 
proviso principle, will the crusade began against them stop at 
that point? They are self deluded who imagine an affirmative. 
The ground against the proviso is as strong a fortification as 
they can stand upon. The Statements of those Whigs and 
democrats who are now uniting with the Abolitionists, that 
they mean not to interfere with the Slavery existing in the 
Slave States are all hollow. The only way to make such 
statements prove true is to take a stand untill the proviso is 
defeated. A victory here will preserve all the rest. 
Accept the heartfelt respect of 

F. W. BYRDSALL.

MY DEAR SIR: The recent proceedings at Charleston, and 
the direction thus given to the political action of the State of 
South Carolina, embolden me to execute a purpose previously 
entertained, that of addressing you on the subject of the pres- 
idential election. 

You will see by the speech of which I enclose a copy, and 
especially by the part of it beginning at the place marked by

me, that I am among those at the North who struggle for 
the application of just principles to the common relations of 
the North and South. I mention this in order to justify 
what I am about to say. 

Parties at the North are now assuming distinctness and 
organisation, on the basis of one or the other of the three 
great Conventions of Baltimore, Philadelphia and Buffalo. 
Of the latter it is unnecessary to speak. As between the 
other two I entertain a strong belief that it is for the inter- 
est of the South to support the nomination of the Baltimore 
Convention. The friends of that nomination at the North 
have assumed the grounds of equal justice to the South in 
the action of the Federal Government; and they alone are 
doing this as a party, with frankness and decision. Is it not 
important, then, that they should be assured of the coopera- 
tion of the South? If the Southern Democrats break away 
from the Baltimore nomination, will not the effect be to dis- 
hearten and disperse theii* best friends at the North ? So it 
seems to me; and therefore the decision of the Charleston 
meeting, in favor of Genl. Cass, gave me very great pleasure. 
I can assure you that the Buffalo Convention has quite neu- 
tralized the effects of the Utica Convention. 1 M r Van Buren 
is now regarded as the ally and agent of the Abolitionists. 
That is to say, the Buffalo Convention has opened the eyes of 
men to the true tendency and character of the Utica Conven- 
tion; so that, beyond the State of New York, the democratic 
party is becoming reunited, instead of being further divided, 
by the Buffalo Convention. 

I have the honor to be Very respectfully and truly Your 
friend and svt

I have just returned from the North where I went soon after 
I saw you in Charleston and found your letter of the 25 th inst 
on my arrival. 

1 Of the Barnburners. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1183 

I notice particularly what you say in regard to the paper 
'and will communicate the views to the parties interested as 
opportunity offers. 

A great change has come over the people of the North since 
my last annual visit amongst them. Free Soil is now the 
universal sentiment of the whole North and East and has already 
swallowed up both parties and all orders and classes of peo- 
ple and I can conceive of no sentiment stronger than the deter- 
mination evinced there to eradicate Slavery from the whole 
Continent of North America and they mean to do it and will 
do it regardless of all consequences unless we meet and defeat 
them before our strength is undermined. 

From what I saw I verily believe Van Buren would have 
Tjeen elected upon the free soil movement if both the whig and 
democratic parties had not at once wrested his ground from 
him and occupied it themselves. They both now alike claim 
free soil as being always their true and legitimate ground and 
are endeavouring to force the Van Buren \lllcgll)le\ off upon 
the ultra ground of abolitionism and liberty party. 

The plan as I understand it with the free soil party is to 
exclude us from all Territory henceforward and a large por- 
tion of the democratic party consisting of the masses, now 
largely composed of emigrants, and the politicians, are intent 
upon the absorption of all Mexico Cuba and Canada. The 
South is of course to be excluded from all, while constant 
approaches are to be made upon Slavery in the frontier states 
as Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina 
and Tennessee with the expectation of the people themselves 
being brought to emancipate by their own Legislatures under 
an Amendment of their Constitutions under a Convention of 
the people and they quote Kentucky and point to Virginia in 
confirmation of what they propose. But what gave me most 
concern was to perceive an increasing disregard and disrespect 
of the South. In fact they are fast loosing all fear and all 
respect for us for they see us wasting our energies upon petty 
and pitiful issues when day by day the Factions of the North 
are drawing the Cordon closer and closer around us. Indeed 
I am told over and often that you were not the exponent of 
the feeling and sentiment of the South on the subject of 



1184 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Slavery and that the people were not with you and would not 
sustain you in your defence of the institution. 

I find a good deal of excitement here about Taylor and Cass, 
but not a great deal of acrimony but for the ill temper and 
indiscretion of a few there would be no great bitterness felt 
by any. After the election is over I hope differences may be 
healed. 

1 leave on Saturday for Georgia and as far as Montgomery 
Al a to return in 10 days and thought I might as well give you 
the result of my observations at the North as well as you 
understand the condition of things you would be amazed at 
the state of feeling now existing North.

I wrote you on the 24 th and we have since had our meeting, 
proceedings of which you will see in this mornings papers. 

The 11 th resolution was added at the instance of Co 1 Mem- 
minger and Co 1 Elmore. They saw me the day before the 
meeting and expressed a great desire for unanimity on the 
part of the state. 1 said the first and most effectual means of 
producing it was to abandon both Candidates for president 
and vote unanimously for a third but it was rejected. The}^ 
sketched off then each of them the form of resolution to be 
presented to the Legislature on Monday next. 1 sketched off 
something also not very different. They said if our resolu- 
tions would cover that ground they would form on our plat- 
form. I then said it was exactly the ground our resolutions 
would take except that we had not pledged ourselves to stand 
by the state of S C a tho there was not a man of us but what 
would do so to the death, in the last resort, tho we counted 
any separate or independent action of the state at least for 
the present or until all efforts for a joint action of the Slave 
States had failed, as fatal to the very object we were all driv- 
ing at. I immediately got our committee together and the 
overture was met in a becoming spirit and the 11 th resolution 



LETTEES TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1185 

was the consequence. It embraces all that Co 1 Memminger 
and Elmore required I believe and I hope it may be considered 
as the first and successful step towards a harmony amongst 
us all. 

At the same time I must express my belief that there has 
been and probably still is a design to revive the old Bluffton 
move and with the same motive and end. I do not think that 
Co 1 Memminger or Co 1 Elmore favour it at least not as a 
present mode of action but Rhett and others do. I do not 
think it will obtain favour I should regret it exceedingly if it 
did for I believe the only means efficient and practicable for 
our purpose is a conciliation or cooperation by some joint 
action on the part of all the Slave states and I do feel great 
confidence in the practicability of such a combination if the 
labour and management proper for it is put in play. 

I have with a view of at least giving due energy and indus- 
try to the object taken the place of chairman of the Corre- 
sponding Committee and now have to beg the favour of you to 
give me your views as to how we should proceed. I wish to 
start fair and start right and when I have my chart before me, 
I will put on the sail. Pray write me freely and fully (and 
in private if you please). I think we may do much if we start 
right towards producing concert and union amongst the slave 
states. 

About the 1 Dec I expect to go to Georgia, Alabama, 
Mobile and New Orleans and Apalachicola and 1 inaj 7 do much 
by personal intercourse. 

I will not omit attention to your suggestions as to the paper 
before I go.

ter and the junctures of its delivery and publication, has and 
will produce a profound and general impression on the public 
mind of the South, and neutralize to some extent the injurious 
influences of the past election. These last have done much, 
in that section at least, to rivet upon us party discipline, 
and give us as controlling guides and tests, party ties and pur- 
poses. Nothing can now arrest so well this fatal tendency as 
a concerted effort by the leaders of both parties at the South 
to get up a Southern Convention, in compliance with their 
understanding at Washington and the necessity of the crisis. 
You have no doubt observed that our party here (those who 
preferred Taylor to Cass) have since the election reorganized 
as a "Southern State Rights Republican" party, with a view 
to such effort, and to break down among ourselves those party 
influences which are shackling our free and manly resistance 
as an insulted and injured people. 

I regret that I cannot entirely agree with you as to the elec- 
toral question. The people of this State are certainly not 
represented as among themselves in the election of electors, 
according to their federal relations, and upon the federal basis 
of representation. I have inclined to the opinion also that 
the present mode of appointment in this State or this feature 
of it was not only not contemplated by the Constitution for 
this reason, but because , in view of the representation of 
both the popular numbers and of the State Sovereignties in 
the Presidency, the people should have a direct choice, at least 
in proportion to their direct share in that representation. It 
is in addition a fact that our people now desire and will insist 
upon having the appointment of the electors. Waiving then 
the question of constitutionality dependent upon the words of 
the Constitution, I gave my consent at the last election for 
the above reasons to the proposed change. I did so reluct- 
antly however, as I admire and would cherish the conservative 
working of the present system in our State. But as to the 
time of the change I am uncommitted and feel no urgency. 
If it will at all interfere with our entire concentration of mind 
and purpose upon the great issue as to slavery and our right, 
it should by all means be postponed. I shall certainly not 
urge it immediately, and shall aid in keeping down all excite- 
ment and wrangling as to it. But there will probably be none, 
if urged at each ensuing session of the Legislature. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1187 

The Majority of the House of Representatives is so large 
and fixed in favor of the change, that action will be taken 
without debate. I am informed there is also now a majority 
in the Senate, and that it will take the same course. No 
popular agitation will probably occur under four and at least 
not under two years. A proposition for the change will be 
brought before the next Legislature. I think it will be impos- 
sible to prevent it. Nothing but the danger now threatening 
Southern institutions and a fear of distraction could do it. 
But I am also satisfied that the deep conviction of the necessity 
of Southern action and union, is so strong in our people, that 
nothing can distract them from pursuing with prompt vigor 
any course that may appear to them as proper and effective, 
and of which they are duly advised. The late Congressional 
elections at the North warn us that the Wilmot-Proviso will 
be applied to our entire territory ; and that if we resist suc- 
cessfully we must do so now. 

Floride was confined with a son a fortnight since. Both 
are doing well. She joins me in the kindest regards to your- 
self and family. We hope to see you soon, as you pass on to 
Washington. 

It would give me great gratification and assistance to hear 
from you as to any of the questions, general or local, that 
may agitate the State or Nation. 
Yours most Sincerely 

JOHN CUNINGHAM.

MY DEAR Sin: Your letter of the 6 Nov. covering the 
statement which I forwarded you of our last hours on Texas 
annexation reached me in due season, and I made your sug- 
gestions of change the basis of a new statement to the other 
members of the Cabinet. 1 I feel satisfied that you are mis- 
taken in fixing on Sunday as the day of our first interview 
after my approval of the resolutions. The Cabinet Council 
was held on Sunday, and our interview was on Saturday. 



!The statement in the revised form may be seen in Tyler's Letters and Times of the 
Tylers, II, 364, 365. 



1188 AMEEICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

But in the new statement I have adopted the use of the day 
of the month in place of the day of the week thus "The 
resolutions reached me on the 1. day of March 1845. My 
official term expired on the 4 th day of the same month after 
my approval had been given to the resolutions M r . Calhoun 
the Secretary of State called on me, &c &c" and what follows 
is made to conform throughout. I enclose you the reformed 
statement which you will find to be modified according to 
your suggestions. Bibb, Nelson and Wickliffe substantial^ 
concur. From Mason and Wilkins I remain to hear. By 
the by Wickliffe gives me a fact of which I was ignorant 
viz. that Mr. Polk without loss of time after his inauguration 
wrote Donelson to suspend all action on our instructions until 
he D. should receive further instructions. He says Donelson 
shewed him the letter when he W. was in Texas, and doubts 
not but that it would be found among the Texan archives of 
Legation. He states his belief that the letter was not marked 
confidential, but still does not wish his name to be mentioned 
in connexion with it. Had you any knowledge of this? Yes 
My D r . Sir it was u the midnight messenger" that secured 
annexation. Anson Jones is a potent witness to establish the 
fact. The fact is that that movement controuled two Cabi- 
nets, that of U. S. and that of Texas. 

I perceive that the abolitionists are in the lead among you 
in Congress, and how the matters are to terminate the future 
will disclose. One thing is quite obvious that old parties are 
changing their affinities and that legislation is in future more 
to be contrould by sections than principles. 

Tendering you the congratulations incident to the season 
I am D r Sir Truly Y rs

The Hon'ble JOHN C CALHOUN 

I reached home last night and hasten to give you the result 
of my observations South and West 

The people of Georgia of both parties are up to the mark 
and ready to act, but may not take the lead but they consider 
the issue as inevitable and the sooner it is made the better. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOTJN. 1189 

Savannah and Augusta less true than the Country owing to 
the northern population. Alabama, the Eastern part of it are 
sound and to the point, their Leading men, as Goldthwaite 
Yancey, Elmore Belser and others understand the subject and 
the remedy well. 

The Northern part of Alabama and the West I can speak of 
only from hearsay. The North I think is a good deal gov- 
erned by party. The West are with us so are the South 
except at Mobile where they are divided, the northern popu- 
lation being as they always are against us. The people of 
Alabama as a whole are with us in every thing but the diffi- 
culty is with the politicians and the parties. What one side 
proposes the other opposes. 

I fear for Louisiana. New Orleans is almost Free Soil in 
their opinions. The populations is one half Northern agents 
another i or ^ are Foreigners. The remnant are Creoles who 
cannot be made to comprehend their danger until the negroes 
are being taken out of the fields. They would then fight 
furiously. The theory there too is that by restricting slavery 
to its present bounds the Lands and negroes of Louisiana 
would be enhanced in value. I was told however by some 
persons whose opinions I had great respect for (they were of 
the Senate of that state and planters) that the country was 
sound and altho they would not make any noise by resolutions 
or otherwise, they would be found in line when the time for 
acting came. Louisiana will be the last if at all to strike for 
the defence of the South. 

In Florida I was no where but at Apalachicola. They are 
all Northern agents there but Florida is right. 

The cities all of them are becoming daily more and more 
unsound and uncertain and all for the same reason. The 
infusion of Northerners and Foreigners amongst them and 
their influence is being felt in the interior. The draymen and 
labourers of New Orleans are all White and Foreigners and 
they will not let a negroe drive a dray. He would be mobbed 
or killed. The Steam Boats are all employing white servants 
and their captains are mostly Northerners and the issue of 
the Free labour against Slave labour will soon be made at the 
South. 

Our own people many of them are desponding. They begin 



1190 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION". 

to think that the Institution of Slavery is doomed. That all 
the world is opposed to it and that we ourselves will not or 
cannot do any thing to avert it. As yet it has been all talk 
and no action, and the majority at the North becoming daily 
more and more decided. 

Here to my mind is the only danger of the South, and I have 
heard and seen the feeling of despondency expressed with 
shame and sorrow. I blushed for my countrymen when I 
saw them ready to cower before the storm. Our slaves them- 
selves are becoming arrogant from the knowledge of this feel- 
ing and will soon be troublesome. The feeling is not general 
however but it is on the increase. 

From all I have seen and learned lam more convinced than 
ever of the vital importance of prompt decided and efficient 
action on the part of the South. The mode of action the wise 
and the patriotic must determine on, whatever is done should 
be calmly considerately and wisely considered and the plan of 
execution well arranged but above all on the execution, the 
action should be bold, determined and decisive. This is neces- 
sary to give confidence it is necessary every way for success 
and without it we are lost. We must show ourselves able and 
willing to defend ourselves before we can obtain the support 
of our friends or the respect or fear of our adversaries. 

My whole theory so far as I am concerned is wise and delib- 
erate, but bold and determined action and with the least pos- 
sible delay. 

My movements have been so rapid that I have fallen behind 
the current of events. I see however that the Southern mem- 
bers held a meeting on the 15 th whatever is determined on, 
each member should exert himself to procure a prompt re- 
sponse from his own district a simultaneous movement can 
be obtained in that way. I may write soon again regarding

Tallahasee, Feby 13 th 1849 

MY DEAR [SiR] I was deeply distressed to see announced in 
the public prints the sudden attack, which assailed you in the 

1 William P. Duval, territorial governor of Florida from 1822 to 1834. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1191 

Senate, and I pray to god your health did not materially 
suffer, by its continuance. I believed at the time, (as I now 
do,) the sudden attack resulted from the distressing and alarm- 
ing and perilous condition of the union. The deep anxiety 
and the awful consequences, springing from a settled deter- 
mination of the enemies of the South, to violate the constitu- 
tion to the destruction of our sacred rights no doubt was the 
cause of your illness 

I have just risen from a bed of sickness, and my mind and 
blood are cool and temperate. I would do much to preserve 
the union but cannot submit to the degradation and insult, 
and the violation of Southern rights, to preserve a disgrace- 
ful confederacy. I have read more than once your report 
recently made to the meeting or convention of the Southern 
members of congress. It is all it should be clear, forceable 
and temperate. It is such a report as will stand the scrutiny 
of the wisest heads of the nation. I have given strict atten- 
tion to Mr. Berrian's report, which is in fact yours, with the 
strength and spirit extracted, so as to leave little better than 
stale beer. The time has passed for conciliation, this has too 
long been the mistaken policy of the South 

For one I am ready to meet the worse that can now Occur. 
My native State Virginia has stood forward nobly and under 
her lead the South will rally in spite of the trators that stolen 
into her confidence and now like scorpions are stinging her 
bosom. Virginia has an immense store of arms and she will 
distribute them to sustain the South. When the time shall 
come (and I fear it is near) I will return to my native state, 1 
and leave nothing undone to procure 1200 stand of arms for 
a corps that I will raise and command in this State, and hold 
ready to march to any point where their services may be 
required. 

If our slaves must wrongfullfy] be taken from us, we will 
try and settle them in the North, we will give them freedom 
and let them conquer our enemies, and give them their cities 
and country that they may win by their arms. The coloured 
race will have much to encourage them in this attempt [toward] 
freedom, a country they can call their own, wealth and honor 
the result. 

i Virginia 



1192 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

Able leaders, discipline and arms will carry that destruction 
and ruin to our enemies that they are preparing for us. The 
fancied security of the North may be shattered by a volcano 
over which they little dream they are preparing for them- 
selves. I rejoice to see so many of the Southern members 
uniting on your report, and if further action is determined 
on by our Southern friends, I am ready to act with them at 
all hazzards. 

I see Mr. Clay is elected to your senate, he goes their I 
fear for evil for good, he has never sought for in the last 20 
years. Gen 1 . Cass too is returned I am glad of this, as he 
will now shew whether his professions are as sincere, as I 
believe them to be. I sacrificed my election to congress, to 
sustain him, from the conviction he stood firmly by the con- 
stitutional rights of the South. Could I have sustained Gen 1 . 
Taylor, no man in this state could have defeated my election. 
I have never sacrificed principle for office. I go for my 
Country and her honor and rights, and prefer defeat on princi- 
ples, than honor and office, without them. 

Let me hear of your health, and let me also have your 
opinion of the hope or prospect of any compromise of the all 
engrossing question of slavery. 

I trust providence will preserve your health and enable you 
to bring to a favorable issue the agitating and dangerous con- 
troversy that so seriously threatens the perpetuity of our 
Union

it will have a more Salutary influence among them than it had 
with a portion of their Representatives. Living in the woods 
here and passing a great portion of my time in the heart of 
Swamps I am reclaiming as a forlorn agricultural hope 1 
hear less than almost any one of what is said even among our 
own people and know little more of public sentiment here 
than you do at Washington. But my opinion has long been 
that the discussion of the Abolition question has eased nearly 
every conscience in the South about holding Slaves, and that 
Self-interest will prompt us almost to a man to go through 
any Struggle and risk any change rather than emancipate 
them in any way, much less on our own soil. The few trad- 
ing politicians of the South who have sold themselves and 
would of course without hesitation sell us and our wives and 
children for their own promotion, will therefore have a fear- 
ful reckoning when it becomes apparent to all the people that 
the crisis has actually arrived. Your Address is well calcu- 
lated to awaken them, and the conduct of the Abolitionists in 
Congress is daily giving it powerful aid. I look with perfect 
certainty to see the Storm rise before long and when it does 
rise there can be but one result a dissolution. For the Free 
States can then hardly be brought to give us those stringent 
and humiliating guarantees to keep the peace which we shall 
imperatively and imperiously demand. I know that the value 
of the Union is now calculated hourly in every corner in the 
South, for I rarely get into a coterie even in the Streets of 
Augusta a Yankee town you know but it is discussed. The 
conviction too is growing rapidly, if I may judge from what 
I hear from time to time in these discussions that the union 
has always been and always will be a disadvantage to us and 
that the sooner we can get rid of it the better. I have thought 
this myself for twenty years, but where I met one five years 
ago who agreed with me, I now meet fifty. There are indu- 
bitable signs. I did think that if there could be an Organiza- 
tion of Southern Members of Congress and an agreement to 
act there in concert on the subject, it might alarm the North 
and even arrest abolition movements for a long time to come. 
If this could be done, rather than have a Revolution, 1 would 
be willing to tolerate the Union for my time: and having 
occasion to write to Judge Bayley last summer I vehemently

urged him to attempt such organization. 1 will own that the 
result of your late effort has surprised me. I had been star- 
tled by the treachery of some Southern Members both whigs 
and democrats at the close of the last Session. But I would 
not allow myself to believe, though I feared and sometimes 
said, there was considerable defection among our politicians. 
I knew too that no Southern man could maintain out and out 
the essential Whig principles of Clay and the North, without 
being wholly false to the South. But that the Whigs in a 
body and so many democrats too should desert us on this 
question so palpably and promptly I did not expect. But I 
see through it. The fate of the Union is sealed. It is the 
order the decree of Providence. Looking as for sometime 
past "I have done altogether to generals and not details in 
political affairs, it appears to me that this signal failure to 
adopt the only measure which could give us security in the 
Union reveals the design of God to sever the Union to res- 
cue us from the licentious Sodom of Northern Mobocracy and 
raise us to that position which our vast resources physical and 
moral will enable us to maintain. If this is not the design, 
then the Knell of our fate has tolled, disunited and distracted 
it is we who are to bow our heads to the destroying Angel. 
But I do not believe that such is our destiny. We have not 
merited it. Its consummation would throw civilization back- 
wards a century or more. In the midst of the daily Strife 
and high excitement of your position you will probably smile 
at a semi -superstitious philosophy like this. But I will can- 
didly own that I have come to the solving of all great Moral 
Problems by tracing through them as well as I am able, the 
Designs of a Power far above ourselves. I look calmly there- 
fore at the events in Washington, and do not doubt that they 
will prove the means of working good. Let the Abolitionists 
press forward. It is our duty so far as we can see clearly to 
oppose them at every step. But we must not be disheartened 
by apparent defeats, but address ourselves to the greater and 
daily more obvious duty of preparing to shake them off alto- 
gether. 

Very Sincerel. Yours

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1195 

From Hilliard M. Judged c. c. 

Eutaw, 29 th Ap 1 . 1849. 

DEAR SIR: Your favor of the 15 th . ultimo has just been 
received, and I regret you did not receive the paper I sent 
you. If I can procure another copy, 1 will send it to you, as 
I desire very much that you should see the article alluded to. 

The immediate object of this letter is to inform you of an 
attempt, which is being made, to destroy your influence in 
this state, by secretly circulating an abominable falsehood, 
well calculated to deceive the unwary and produce the most 
injurious efl'ect upon the great Southern question. I have 
it, not directly, but through the most undoubted author- 
ity, that M r . Houston 2 of this State defends himself for not 
signing " the Southern Address," by stating that the Slavery 
question is agitated alone for party purposes and party efl'ect, 
and in evidence of that fact, says, you told M r . Douglass of 
Illinois, during the discussion of the California bill "that it 
would never do to settle this question of slavery that its agi- 
tation was necessary to the success of the Democratic Party 
in the South." He referred his hearer (Judge Wallace of 
Tuscaloosa) to the Hon M r Hilliard of Montgomery, in cor- 
roboration of what he stated. 

The object of this statement is clear those Southern Whigs 
and democrats who betrayed their Constituents, seek to defend 
themselves by assailing you, in whom the whole South, with- 
out distinction of party, have the most unlimited Confidence. 

It is part and parcel of the attack made upon you by that 
base sot and demagogue, Senator Houston, 3 urged on, doubt- 
less, by Senator Benton, whose sympathies are wholly with 
the Abolitionists. 

Those Whig members of Congress who have betrayed their 
Constituents and the South, from love of party and spoils, 
have united in the attack, as evidenced by M r Houston of this 
State referring to M r Hilliard for support and corroboration. 
Whether or not this statement ought to be Contradicted, you 
best know, but I can say to you, it has gained no credence 
from any person of intelligence, with whom I have conversed, 

1 A supporter of Calhoun in Alabama. 

2 George L. Houston, M.C. 

3 General Sam Houston, at this time Senator from Texas. 



1196 AMEEICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

of either party, yet, -at the same time, ignorant persons in the 
other portions of the South may be deluded by it. 

Almost all Counties of South Alabama have responded most 
emphatically "to the Southern Address" without distinction 
of party. North Alabama is much less interested and will be 
slow in her action, yet I think she will follow the lead of the 
Southern portion of the State. A favorable omen of public 
opinion there, is furnished by Houston's refusal to be a Can- 
didate for re-election. Hilliard will be beaten in his District, 
by a Whig or Democrat who is sound, as may seem best cal- 
culated to accomplish this result. 

Judge Goldthwaite of Montgomery is arousing public atten- 
tion to this great question, in the best manner that it can 
possibly be done, viz. by charging the grand- jurys in his Cir- 
cuit, in an able manner upon the subject. 

The effect is most admirable upon the ignorant portion of 
the people, from the Color of authority under which it is 
done. The great difficulty is to make the Masses see beyond 
their noses they do not see and feel that the necessary con- 
sequence of allowing all the outposts of Slavery to be carried, 
involves a certain destruction of the Citadel itself. 

The public mind is rapidly being prepared for what must 
come at last the dissolution of the Union, but we must have 
time. Let the Legislatures speak out in support of Va, as 
they will all do let them all be committed to the principle of 
resistance, and then, when the time does come for action, they 
will be prepared to defend their rights to the last extremity. 

Let South Carolina hold back a little, until her more Sloth- 
ful Sisters can be equally well instructed in their rights and 
duty under the present emergency, the whole South will then 
present an unbroken front, and thus accomplish peacably 
what we desire! This delay is not so necessary for Alabama 
as for the more Western States, for next to South Carolina, 
Alabama is better prepared for resistance than any other 
Southern State. 

Your suggestion, as to the necessity of a Convention of the 
Southern States is perfectly obvious. We cannot get along 
in any other way the North will not be deterred from her 
course of wanton agression by resolutions of the State Legis- 
latures, but let the Legislatures first declare the principle and 



LETTERS TO JOHN 0. CALHOUN. 1197 

the people of the States can give them force and effect in 
Convention. 

Our Corn and Cotton crops were destroyed entirely by a 
frost on the 15 th ultimo, also all the wheat North of this

From HerscJiel V. Johnson. l c. c. 

Milledgeville, Ga. July 20 th , 1849. 

MY DEAR SIR, The perusal of your reply to Col. Benton 
has afforded me the most heartfelt satisfaction. It is so lucid, 
so simple and yet so powerful, and so overwhelming, that it 
will produce a deep impression upon the Country, and con- 
sign your insolvent assailant to that infamy which traitors 
deserve. I have read it, and thrice read it; and there is but 
a solitary remark which I would be willing to see stricken 
from it. That is "If it did not", (i. e. Texas did not extend 
to the Rio Grande) "the war stands without justification. If 
it did not, the march of our army to the Rio Grande was an 
invasion of a neighboring Country unauthorised by the Con- 
stitution or law ". I have always differed with you on this 
subject. I believe the war can be triumphantly vindicated, 
even admitting that Texas did not extend to the Rio Grande. 
Still your remarks on this point, in exposition of Benton's 
inconsistency are strictly true and unanswerable. The only 
reason I have for feeling any regret at the expressions above 
quoted, is, that I fear there may be those so very sensitive of 
Mr. Folk's reputation, that they will seize hold of it, with the 
view, if possible, of arraying the prejudices of that class of 
politicians against you. I feel nothing of this myself, and I 
can fully appreciate the honesty, with which you entertain 
your opinions, in reference to the war. But who can satisfy 
Captious faultfinders? No one need attempt it. Your reply 

1 Herschel V. Johnson, judge of the superior court of Georgia, was afterward governor 
of that state, candidate for Vice-President on the Douglas ticket in 1860, and a Confed- 
erate senator.

will win its way to victory, against all prejudices and silly 
hypercriticism. Truth is might} r and will prevail. The press, 
thus far, has spoken of it in terms of unqualified approbation. 
I trust the South will be awakened from her lethargy. 

Our Democratic State Convention came off, according to 
appointment on the 11 th inst. It was a very large assemblage 
and distinguished for weight of character and intelligence. 
For the sake of harmony, the subject of the Southern Address 
was not touched. It would have torn us to atoms, without 
giving us any strength. We adopted the Virginia Resolu- 
tions unanimously; and I think we went a little further on the 
doctrine of non-interference than any other convention in 
the South (except Carolina) has gone. We not only denied the 
power of Congress to establish or prohibit slavery in the ter- 
ritories, but denied also the power to ratify any act of a terri- 
torial legislature having such an object. There is much 
excitement in the Democratic party of this State upon the 
slavery question. The great mass is obviously with the sign- 
ers; and in order to remove the distrust, which the non-signers 
feel is felt towards them, there was no hesitation in adopting 
the Virginia Resolutions. 

But notwithstanding these demonstrations, I entertain 
gloomy forebodings. I seriously fear that the people of the 
South are not properly awake to the danger, not thoroughly 
nerved to united resistance. 

What do you think will be the course of the next Congress ? 
It is said that Gen. Taylor has sent on a Commissioner to 
California to urge and assist the people to make a Constitu- 
tion preliminary to admission into the Union. If this be true, 
it shadows forth pretty distinctly the policy of the adminis- 
tration. It will be to bring in California and thus avoid the 
Wilmot Proviso. In the Consummation of this policy the 
non-signing Democrats will vigorously cooperate. This is 
but a circuitous mode of cheating the South out of her rights 
and gaining the object of the Provisoists. But how can we 
help ourselves ? Suppose California presents her Constitution 
at the next Session and demands admittance, how can the' 
South object? We admit the right of the people in forming 
a State Constitution to establish or eschew Slavery. Then, 
ought we to oppose And how ? But California being admit- 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1199 

ted, what becomes of New Mexico ? It still leaves the ques- 
tion all open. It seems to me, that before the South Consents 
to the admission of California, we ought to demand a just 
compromise as to New Mexico, and a total abandonment on 
the part of the North, of their aggressions in respect to the 
District and slavery in the States. Now is the time for a set- 
tlement in full. If we yield now, we are gone. Concession 
will invite further insult; and we shall ultimately lose our self 
respect and become worthy of our degraded fate. How dark 
the future looks! If you have time drop me a word on these 
points. I want light and desire to know the views of our sage 
statesmen. 

Very sincerely yours &c.

Lynchburg, July 25 th . 1849. 

MY DEAR SIR: I received last night, and read with great 
pleasure your reply to Benton. 1 An extract from it had pre- 
viously reached us; and expecting the residue, a large number 
of persons gathered around the Post Office on the arrival of 
the mail on yesterday. Curses, deep and bitter were uttered 
against the Traitor; and some who, for years, have been your 
steady enemies, came up to congratulate me on the triumphant 
defence. It seems to me that it must surely overwhelm the 
scoundrel even in Missouri. In this State I am sure he will 
not have an advocate, whatever may be the effect of his deser- 
tion in the Free States. But even there it seems to me his 
piratical cruise will not be rewarded with a single prize. It 
is obvious that neither Cass nor Van Buren are prepared to 
give way, especially in favour of one who, in the effort to 
intrude on their own peculiar Territory, hazards if [he] do[es] 
not sacrifice his title to his own. He has undoubtedly over- 
reached himself; and his fate will be as you predict; tho', 
from present appearances, it is to be feared he will carry his 
own State. What effect your reply will have there remains 
to be seen. It will certainly weaken him no little.

I was at first inclined to think that you should not dignify 
him with a notice; but subsequent reflection convinces me 
you have pursued the right course, placing the reply on the 
grounds you do. In this respect the subject is divested, in a 
great measure, of its mere personal character and bearing, 
and brings up to view more distinctly to the public the true 
issue which lies behind the gauze-work of the scoundrel's 
malignity. I think it will, more than any other Paper the 
public has yet seen, bring the people to consider the true 
question which is pending a question not between Whig and 
Democrat, but between the North and the South. I hope it 
will tend no little to unite and consolidate public sentiment in 
the latter; tho' this, in the present state of Parties, seems 
almost impracticable. As to Virginia, I am almost hopeless. 
The interests of the leaders of both Parties are in dissolubly con- 
nected with the Federal Treasury; and, of course, opposed to 
the assertion of any principles, or the adoption of any course 
of action which, by hazarding what they call "the Union", 
put in jeopardy their hopes of preferment and plunder. It 
is not their patriotism but their love of pelf which would 
prompt them to submit to any and every usurpation and 
outrage, rather than hazard their chances of advancement. 
These, through the machinery of Party, have got the People 
under absolute controul. The course of the last Legislature 
was, I fear, a mere ruse de guerre, a manouvre of Party. 
Neither Party acted in good faith ; and neither I fear will ven- 
ture to come up to the principles avowed in the Resolutions. 
Indeed, had the action on the Resolutions been postponed until 
after the result of the meeting in Washington was known, I 
am sure they would not have received the votes of a dozen 
Whigs. On the other hand the design of the Democrats was 
to force their opponents into a false position, while they 
covered their own past treachery to the South. In short, Sir, 
should the Wilmot Proviso be passed, nay, should Congress 
next proceed to abolish Slavery in the District, and the trade 
between the States, I am compelled to say, with feelings of 
deep mortification, that Virginia, after a few patriotic groans, 
will submit. She is already deeply infected with the spirit of 
abolitionism, much more deeply than most persons think; and 
I have no doubt our Leaders who, for the most part, are 



LETTEKS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1201 

mere Pensioners of the Federal Government in esse or in fieri 
will take advantage of the circumstances to make such com- 
promises hereafter as they have made heretofore. The result 
of the last election affords no fair criterion of popular senti- 
ment, except in some portions east of the mountains. Pendle- 
ton, Butts, and Flournoy m&y show that sentiment in their 
respective districts, but M c Dowell, by far the most unsound 
and dangerous of the whole Delegation, reflects but too faith- 
fully the sentiments of the West generally. 

With these opinions I fear that when the occasion shall call 
for decisive action, South Carolina will have to look to the 
States still further South for support; for, with the lights at 
present before me, she will not be sustained by Virginia; and, 
if not sustained she will be hunted down, as is usual in such 
cases, with the tiger vengeance that alwaj^s characterizes the 
Traitor. At this moment I am sure the leading Editors of 
the two Parties in Virg a . hate the People of S. Carolina with 
a more intense spirit than Garrison, Tappan or Giddings; and 
for the obvious reason that their conduct is a standing re- 
proach on their own venality and treachery. They are, as 
they have always been, only looking to President making. 
Does not the late letter of Cass to Ritchie show that, under 
the rose, the game of delusion is still going on? Is it not 
manifest that ancient political jockey is still rubbing down his 
spavined steed for a second heat? And will he or those whom 
he controuls ever stop to inquire about rights or principles, 
when place and plunder to the amount of millions per. an. 
depend upon the result of a Presidential election ? 

Still, if some State do not act we are irretrievably lost; we 
and our children. There are yet seven thousand men in Vir- 
ginia who have not bowed the knee to Baal, and I am certain 
that in whatever course S Carolina may determine to take, 
in the last resort, she will find a cooperation which will ren- 
der it no easy matter to crush her. Should the Wilmot 
Proviso pass, or any kindred measure, I am clear that a Con- 
vention of the People should be called immediately, and 
recommend a General Convention of the Southern States at 
an early day to take the whole matter into consideration; and 
on failure to procure such concurrence, to take steps for

(Confidential.) Atlanta, Ga. Aug. 24, 1849. 

MY DEAR SIR, Within a period now counting by days and 
no longer by months and weeks, the flag of Cuban Independ- 
ence will be raised. 

The people of the Island are ripe and ready in point of 
opinion and feeling; but, timid and overborne by the military 
despotism under which they have been so long accustomed to 
cower, they will of course need a respectable point d" 1 appui, 
to induce them to dare to come out. With such a point d'* 
appui, moreover, there is little doubt that a large part if not 
the whole of the Spanish troops would fraternize with the 
Revolution. Probably less than 1000 will land under Gen. 
Lopez. 

You are aware of the standing threat of the Spanish Gov't, 
to make a San Domingo of Cuba if necessary to keep it. 

The South ought (according to an expression which Gen. 
Lopez has quoted to me from you) to flock down there in 
"open boats", the moment they hear the tocsin. They will 
hear it very soon. Will they fulfil this expectation ? The 
answer is of supreme importance. They ought not only to 
go, but to go at once. I write to you (being myself deeply 
interested in the movement, and now on my way to New 
Orleans on business connected with) in the hope that you will 
appreciate at once the thousand and powerful reasons which 
seem to me to apply to your position, to cause vou to strain 
every nerve at this moment for the promotion of the object. 
At every considerable point in the South volunteers ought to 
come forward, and go forward in their own modes. It can 
easily be done legalty. They can go as emigrants, California 
adventurers via Cuba, passengers going to Cuba to see for 
themselves, and determine there to which side to offer their

relates to the Cuban enterprise commonly called the Round Island expedition. 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1203 

aid, or to be prepared to act as a neutral police force against 
servile insurrection in case of danger from the convulsed 
state of the Island between the two contending parties. 
Probably the friends of the Revolution can afford them trans- 
portation from New Orleans, Charleston, Norfolk or other 
points, but on this point there can be no practical difficulty. 
Now, my dear sir, can not you write to fifty points and fifty 
proper persons to act and act with the requisite energy, 
promptitude, head and heart, in this matter? Your aid thus 
extended would be a tower of strength. All going may rely 
on generous compensation from opulent Cuba, once liberated. 
But independent of such motives there are considerations 
enough of a different character which I should think ought to 
rouse all the youth and manhood of the Southern States in 
particular to rush down to help the Cuban Revolution. 

I shall be for a week at New Orleans, where I hope to have 
the pleasure of hearing from you. This letter is hastily 
scrawled in the short interval afforded by detention of the 
cars. 

Very Respectfully and Truly, My dear Sir, Your friend and 
servant, 

J. L. O'SlILLIVAN. 

If I, a "New York Free Soiler" am so deeply interested in 
behalf of this movement, what ought not to be the enthusiasm 
of Southern gentlemen?

and a steamer of a thousand ton with 12 or 15 hundred more, 
from New jOrleans simultaneously, well armed and equiped 
composed of picked men, and officers, ready for the perils the 
profits and honours of the venture. We think that all the 
elements of success are with them, as every chance has been 
calculated and every thing which prudence and forethought 
could suggest done to ensure full success. The Government 
here are in the secret and have done no more in the matter of the 
Proclamation than regard for appearances demanded. The 
first fifteen days is the time of trial, and they invite the moral 
aid, of all true hearts, who desire the incorporation of that 
ocean gem, in our sisterhood of States and of all who sym- 
pathize with a people groaning under the yoke of tyranny, 
determined to achieve freedom or die in the struggle. 



From Henry S. Footed c. c. 

Warrenton. September 25 th 1849 

MY DEAR SIR; I am gratified to have it within my power to 
inform you that several leading gentlemen of both the two 
great political parties in Mississippi, have promised me at our 
approaching Convention, to act upon your suggestion relative 
to the recommendation of a Southern Convention. Very 
recently I have received information from all parts of Mis- 
souri touching M r Bentons movements there, and assuring me 
of his certain defeat. Among others, Atcheson writes that 
his overthrow is beyond doubt. Judge Morrow, M r Treat, 
and several prominent men besides, write to the same effect. 
I am invited, as I suppose you are, to the St. Louis Rail-road 
Convention, and am specially urged to attend by friends who 
declare their conviction that M r Benton's plan would be nega- 
tived, and none other adopted. It is also declared to be the 
wish of several that 1 should address the citizens of St. Louis 
in opposition to M r Bentons plan and operations generally. I 
should willingly comply with both invitations, but I am not 
certain, or even confident of any such good effects as seem to 
be anticipated. Were 1 sure of your attending, which I think 
you could do with great advantage to the common cause, I

would contrive to meet you, and encounter all the coarser work 
of the occasion. It would be a great thing to overthrow him, 
at home, and blow up his Humbug project, in presence of his 
own constituents. 

Several movements which you cannot fail to have perceived, 
seemed to indicate that the policy of the Administration is to 
settle the Wilmot Proviso question by admitting California 
and N. Mexico both as states, upon the formal application 
next winter. I confess that my mind inclines favorably to 
the scheme, so far as California is concerned. It appears to 
me though, that N. Mexico would hardly be ready to enter 
the Union so early, as my information is that there are not 
more than five hundred Americans there altogether. I am 
not inclined to move precipitately in the affair at all; and 
after all that has occurred, should deem it highly indiscreet 
to take any important step save in full counsel with yourself 
and others of the South whom I could name. If California 
could be brought into the Union under Southern auspices, 
and provision made for the admission of N. Mexico when a 
sufficient number of persons of American birth shall be ascer- 
tained to have become resident therein; all legislation on the 
subject of slavery, either by Congress or Territorial legisla- 
tures being in the meantime precluded, it seems to me that 
the honor of the South would be saved, and the population of 
both the territories so effectually conciliated as might in time 
lead to most advantageous result. Some such plan as this 
matured at once and announced about the time of the Missouri 
Convention, next month, would blow Bentonism sky-high; 
quiet and save the Republic, and sweep away the demagogu- 
ism of the present house forever. I do not urge these things 
upon you. I only suggest them. Whatever is done hereafter 
in the settlement of this question, I am desirous, for various 
reasons, should be done under your lead; but I am willing to 
perform any subordinate part of the good work which may 
be assigned me. I write in great haste, and under the pres- 
sure both of bodily disease, and of mental anguish from the 
decease of several very dear relatives in the neighborhood 
which has recently taken place. 

I remain most cordially

Jackson Oct 5, 1849. 

Hon. JOHN C CALHOUN. Two of your letters to Gen Foote 
were enclosed to me, to be used according to my discretion on 
the question of the crisis. That suggesting a Southern Con- 
vention was shown by me to our mutual friends Ch. Justice 
Sharkey * and Judge Clifton, who, altho Whigs are well up to 
Southern rights. We adopted the idea with ardor, but all 
concurred in opinion, that if we should proceed on a course 
recommended from S. Carolina, we should fail. The idea of 
a Southern Convention had previously occurred here but 
you may well appreciate how much your opinion strength- 
ened confirmed and animated us. I dropped a note to Gen 
Foote stating that it had occurred in Mississippi that a South- 
ern Convention was the important action required. You will 
understand this. 

In the Mississippian of this date, on its second page, you 
will find the action of one of the Southern States in Conven- 
tion, recommending a Convention of the Fifteen Southern 
States, appointing 12 delegates, with alternates, on the ration 
that we have two Senators and four representatives in Con- 
gress, being six and that both of the two great political parties 
should be equally represented. Sharkey and myself thought 
Washington was the best place of the assemblage; but the 
majority preferred Nashville as more central! All agreed 
that February or March was the time, but here the majority 
believed that it would require until the 1st of June to enable 
the Southern States to act. 

There were four or five resolutions concerning the exclusion 
of California, until organized according to the Constitution; 
but this, not on principle, but as to detail (fact and law) 
became a theme of prolonged debate; and the Convention, 
(impatient to adjourn after three days session,) laid them all 
aside and appointed a committee to prepare an address to the 
South, in which it has been agreed that this subject will be 
submitted to the Southern People and their Convention. 

If the Southern States shall gather around Mississippi and 
support her the Constitution and the Union will be rescued 
from the hands of madmen and traitors.

LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1207 

This is the utmost joint action we could obtain. Virginia 
(my state) I hope will first act, then Alabama, then Louisiana, 
then Tennessee and Kentucky, then Arkansas, then N. Caro- 
lina, then South Carolina, and then the martyred state of 
Georgia and the rest. This however is only my wish, the 
reasons for which I could explain. J I trust that our effort will 
be duly hailed by your nullifying state! Our movement is 
attempted to be maligned as one of nullification! I am now 
encouraged to hope that the coalition of the North will soon 
be compelled to recede and disband. Then politics have too 
long turned on our affairs: too long has denunciation and actual 
war upon our agricultural institutions been their theme and 
agitation. 

I am with the highest esteem

From Reuben Chapman* c. c.

Private 

DEAR SIR; The legislature of this state will meet here in a 
few weeks (2 nd Monday in next Nov) and as my message I 
believe will be the first since the adjournment of Congress 
from any executive of a slave holding state, I am as solicitous 
as it is certainly important for the interest of the South, that 
the question now at issue between the Southern and Northern 
portions of the Confederacy shall be presented as strongly as 
the nature of a message will allow. 

I avail myself therefore of my long acquaintance with you, 
and your own knowledge of my opinion and course in all 
questions of this sort in Congress to ask your views as briefly 
as you may think proper upon the following points. 1 st Is 
not the power of Congress over the territories and public 
lands within the states identically the same in kind and degree ? 

iThe second Washington, at his own table, after his election and before he was con- 
ducted to the Capitol as the most renowned specimen of a nation's humiliation, said to 
his guests, in reference to the extension of the area of slavery, to which he was opposed, 
that "if Mr. C. sneezed S.C. would sneeze." A Southern bishop present told him that 
"Virginia would sneeze first," etc. (Footnote in the original.) 
2 Reuben Chapman was governor of Alabama from 1847 to 1849. 



1208 AMERICAN HISTORICAL ASSOCIATION. 

2 nd Does the power of exercising territorial government result 
from the terms of the 2 nd clause of sec. 3 rd of Article 4 th of the 
Constitution ; or is it incident to the right of acquisition ? 3 rd 
May we not rightfully assume from Gen 1 Rileys proclamation, 
that he is acting under instructions from the War Depart- 
ment? and if so, and the ends should be consummated which 
are in contemplation by that proclamation, would it not be an 
aggravation of the wrong proposed by the Wilmot proviso? 
4 th Under what limitations have the people of a territory a 
right to erect a state government ? 5 th Are the Mexican and 
other foreigners resident in California at the ratification of 
the treaty citizens of the United States within the meaning of 
the treaty ? and if so, has the treaty making power the right 
to alter in any particular the general naturalization law of 
the U. S. ? 

I have thought of recommending that provision be made for 
convening the legislature immediately upon the passage of the 
proviso or any similar measure, or the admission of California 
as a state through the agency above alluded to. Would it be 
politic to make any other or different recommendation at 
present? A state or southern convention having neither of 
them been agitated in this state, I have some fears that the 
suggestion of either might have a bad effect. The people are 
however sound on the subject. 

I would not trouble you sir knowing the multiplicity of 
your engagements but for the vital importance of this subject 
to our country. As my message must be in readiness some 
days before the legislature meets, I must ask your reply as 
early as possibly convenient. 

With high respect Your friend &c

South Carolinian Office, Columbia, Nov r 8, 1849. 
DEAR SIR, 1 take the liberty of addressing you for several 
reasons. Your rumored retirement, you will have noticed 
probably, we have contradicted in the Carolinian, and we 



LETTERS TO JOHN C. CALHOUN. 1209 

trust we may have been correct in so doing, indeed we cannot 
think otherwise. 

From various indications, I feel assured the proposition 
emanating from the Mississippi Convention to hold a Southern 
Convention will eventually be adopted, and though late may 
yet be effective in doing good. When conducting a neigh- 
boring journal I earnestly and repeatedly urged the necessity 
of such a measure through its columns; and had the pleasure 
of knowing that you were convinced. that it was the action for 
the South to adopt. Would that the proposition had then 
received the attention it claimed and deserved. It may not 
be "too late" now, and there is no doubt but party affilia- 
tions have become much weaker since and that there is a 
better chance for a complete union of men of all parties at 
the present time. 

Intimately associated with the movement, will be the con- 
nection of your name with the Presidency, as an independent 
or constitutional nominee, irrespective of the nominations of 
the usual party Conventions. Now ought not the Democratic 
presses at the South, take early and decided ground against 
these Conventions not only the Democratic press of the 
South, but Whig also. But more particularly the democratic 
press, as the late "Coalitions" at the North are sad evidences 
of the fact that we have, or can have but few friends there. 
This can be done without the abandonment of any set of 
political principles, and the mere party associations are not 
worth a thought, at such a time as this. It could not in- 
volve any greater sacrifice none half so great as* the yielding 
of constitutional rights. 

Occupying the position we do, conducting a leading journal, 
with an extensive and rapidly increasing circulation through- 
out the State and adjacent States, it is of great importance to 
us to have [the] benefit of such suggestions as you could give 
us, and thus be enabled to aid as far as possible in bringing 
about a union of the South. 

I would consider it a great favor if you had leisure to write 
me briefly upon these subjects, and any suggestions which you 
might deem of service to me in my present position would be 
gratefully received and acted on premising that any coinmu-

With great respect Yours truly 

W M B. JOHNSTON. 

P. S. I see by the Charleston Courier this evening that 
they say they have understood you approved of the proposi- 
tion to hold a Southern Convention. I will probably briefly 
state in the Carolinian without saying so authoritatively 
that any measure tending to promote union of action will be 
certain of receiving your sanction. 



From J. If. Hammond. 1 

Silver Bluff 5 March 1850 

MY DEAR SIR, I am greatly rejoiced to hear of your im- 
proved health, and by the telegraph that you were in the 
Senate day before yesterday. I trust that as warm weather 
advances you will recover entirely and feel well enough to 
retain your seat through this crisis. If I may judge of your 
particular views by the three or four sentences which the tele- 
graph devotes to an abstract of your speech on Monday, 2 I 
should regard your retirement at this moment as a peculiar 
calamity to the South. Under any circumstances your loss 
would be irreparable, but your ideas as to the precise course 
necessary at this exigency, as I understand them, are so 
clearly in my judgment the only safe and sound ones, that to 
be deprived of your powerful aid in developing and enforcing 
them, would almost make me doubt that Providence was on 
our side. I have no sort of faith with any Constitutional 
Compacts with the North. She never has regarded them and 
never will. On mere Legislative Compromises I look with 
horror. They are the apples of Hippomenes cast behind him 
in the race. Our only safety is in equality of POWER. We 
must divide the territory so as forever to retain that equality 
in the Senate at least, and in doing so we should count Dela- 
ware with the North. She is no Southern or Slave State. I

would infinitely prefer disunion to any thing the least short 
of this and I would rather have it I believe any how for f ear 
of future Clays, Bentons, Houstons and Bells. If the North 
will not consent to this I think we should not have another 
word to say, but kick them out of the Capitol and set it on 
fire. We must act now, and decisively. We will be in a clear 
minority when California comes in and in twenty or thirty 
years, there will be ten more free states West of the Missis- 
sippi and ten more North of the St Lawrence and the Lakes. 
England would gladly surrender Canada to us now, if she had 
a decent pretext that would serve her pride. Long before 
the North gets this vast accession of strength she will ride 
over us rough shod, proclaim freedom or something equiva- 
lent to it to our Slaves and reduce us to the condition of Hayti. 
She would not even do as England did to Jamaica. She would 
do what the Constituent Assembly did to Hayti. If we do not 
act now, we deliberately consign our children, not our pos- 
terity, but our children to the flames. What a holocaust for 
us to place upon the Altar of that Union, for which the 
South and West have had such a bigoted and superstitious 
veneration. 

It seems to me that Congress will leave nothing for the 
Nashville Convention to do. If you make a truce, however 
fatal, we cannot violate it. If you make an impassable breach, 
the powers of the Convention under the Virginia instructions 
will be inadequate to any useful purpose. The only thing to 
be done will be to call a General Congress of the South. The 
Nashville Convention might recommend that, but I presume 
an equally potent impulse would come from Congress. 
Should things remain contrary to every appearance pretty 
much as they are, I think that will be the proper course for 
the Nashville Convention to take. I am decidedly opposed to 
any Address either defiant or remonstrant, or conciliatory to 
the North, and nothing need be said to the South after the 
Southern Address. A very Short Preamble and a couple of 
resolutions would answer every purpose and these I could 
draw in five minutes. In fact I have had them by me for 
some time. The substance of them is in this letter. I am not 
ambitious myself to u Bell the Cat" and will not push to make 
the move, but rather second it. But would make it. I would

send you a copy of this paper, but fear to involve you unnec- 
essarily in its consequences. You must preserve yourself for 
the Convention to frame the New Constitution. You must 
be there with your full powers. In the mean time I am 
extremely anxious to see your Book on Government. I trust 
that you have taken the ground that the fundamental object 
of Government is to secure the fruits of labor and skill that 
is to say property, and that its f orm^ must be moulded upon 
the social organization. Life and liberty will then be secured, 
for these are naturally under the guardianship of Society 
and that civilization which is the fruit of its progress. ''''Free 
Government" and all that sort of thing has been I think a fatal 
delusion and humbug from the time of Moses. Freedom does 
not spring from Government but from the same soil which 
produces Government itself; and all we want from that is a 
guarantee for property fairly acquired. 1 fear it will be 
impossible for me to go to Washington. 1 must endeavour to 
put my affairs in a proper train, to be neglected hereafter if 
circumstances require it, as every man must do his duty when 
the tug comes. In the last eight crops I have sunk four and 
two of these in the last three, and just now a heavy pecuniary 
responsibility has devolved on me. . . . Altho' 1 have 
the strongest hopes that I have my lands now in a condition 
to repay me rapidly all I have sunk in their improvement, I 
must at this time act with exceeding caution and dare not 
leave them to any management but my own until I see my 
crop fairly on the way. Do write me as fully as you can. 
I think the Atlantic and Gulf States are by an immense 
majority ready for any thing, and less patient than their 
leaders. Six months has produced an immense change and it 
is going on rapidly. If the leaders will only lead, neither 
they nor we have any thing to fear. 

Yours sincerely J. H. HAMMOND
