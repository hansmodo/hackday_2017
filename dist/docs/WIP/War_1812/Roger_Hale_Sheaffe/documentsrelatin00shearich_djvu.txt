Documents Relating to the War of 1812 



THE LETTER-BOOK OF 

Gen. Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe 



NOW FIRST PUBLISHED 



NOTE ON THE SHEAFFE PAPERS 



The Buffalo Historical Society publishes this collection of docu- 
ments of the War of 1812 through the courtesy of their owner. Hon. 
James Hilton Manning of Albany. 

As a whole, the letters, orders, etc., relate chiefly to military 
operations on the Niagara, under the officer who succeeded in com- 
mand of the British forces when Gen. Brock fell at Queenston. A 
brief sketch of that officer, drawn largely from the (British) Dic- 
tionary of National Biography, is in place here : 

"Gen. vSir Roger Hale Sheaffe was born in Boston, Mass., July 
*5> 1763, the third son of William Sheaffe, deputy collector of his 
Majesty's customs at Boston. His mother was Susannah, eldest 
daughter of Thomas Child of Boston. Fit is stated in Appleton's 
"Cyclopaedia of American Biography" that after the death of 
Sheaffe's father, "Earl Percy, whose quarters were at his mother's 
house, took charge of his education."] On May I, 1778, through 
the influence of Earl Percy, he received an ensigncy, and on Dec. 27, 
1780, a lieutenancy in the 5th Foot. He served in Ireland from 
January, 1781, to May, 1787, and in Canada from July, 1787, to 
September, 1797. Under the orders of Sir Guy Carleton, first Baron 
Dorchester, instructed by Lt. Gov. John Graves Simcoe, he was 
employed on a public mission in 1794 to protest against certain 
settlements made by the Americans on the south shore of Lake 
Ontario. On May 5, 1795, he obtained his company in the 5th Foot, 
and on March 22, 1798, a lieutenant colonelcy in the 49th. He served 
in Holland from August to November, 1799, in the expedition to 
the Baltic from March to July, iSoi, and in Canada from Septem- 
ber, 1802, to October, iSiT. The rank of brevet colonel was con- 
ferred on him April 25, 1808, and that of major-general, June 4, 
1811. He again served in Canada from July 29, 1812, to November, 
1813. On October 13, 1812, the troops of the United States took 
Queenston on the Niagara, but on the same day Sheaffe, on the 
death of General Sir Isaac Brock, assumed the command of the 
British forces, recaptured the town, the Americans losing heavily 
in killed, wounded and prisoners. In the following year, on 
April 27, he defended the town of York, now Toronto, when the 
losses of the Americans in taking the place, exceeded the total num- 
bers of those opposed to them. Sheaffe continued to command in 
the Upper Province and to administer its government until June, 
1813, and on his retirement received flattering testimonials from 
the Executive Council. For his services he was, on Jan. 16, 1813, 
created a baronet of Great Britain, and further rewarded by the 
colonelcy of the 36th Foot on Dec. 20, 1829, and his nomination as

a general on June 28, 1838. He had a residence at Edswale, County 
Clare, but died in Edinburgh, July 17, 1851, when his title became 
extinct. He married, in 1810, Margaret, daughter of John Coffin 
of Quebec; she died at Bath, May i, 1855." 

The English biographer above quoted omits to show that Sheaffe 
met a serious reverse at York, April 27, 1813. The American attack 
was followed by the explosion of a powder magazine, with con- 
siderable loss of life. The town was surrendered to the Americans, 
but during the capitulation Sheaffe and a portion of his regulars fled 
towards Kingston. Sheaffe was severely censured for the loss of 
York, and was soon after superceded in command in Upper Canada 
by Major General De Rottenburg. He retired to Montreal, and was 
given command of troops there, later retiring to Europe as above 
stated. 

The reader will please bear in mind that the letters, orders and 
other documents that follow are here published, not as narrative 
history, but as source material likely to prove of value to the student 
cf the period. A few of the letters, in part or in substance, have 
had publication; these are indicated in foot-notes. Most of them 
are not known to have been printed. They are here copied from 
the original manuscript, which presents a various handwriting, prob- 
ably the work of successive aids or secretaries to the general, and 
the peculiarities of the original, in spelling, etc., have been followed. 
In most cases, of persons mentioned only by their surname, the 
given name or initials will be found supplied, in the Index. 

It is plain that General Sheaffe kept this letter-book by him, 
from the time of the battle of Queenston, at least until the date of 
the last entry, made in Edinburgh, June 8, 1849, only two years 
before his death.

GEN. SIR ROGER HALE SHEAFFE 



MAJ. GEN. SHEAFFE S ACCOUNT OF THE BATTLE OF 
QUEENSTON. 1 

FORT GEORGE, i3th October, 1812. 

SIR: I have the honor of informing Your Excellency 
that the Enemy made an attack with a considerable force 
this morning before day light on the position of Queenston ; 
on receiving information of it, Major General Brock im- 
mediately proceeded to that post, and I cannot express my 
grief in having to add that he fell whilst gallantly cheering 
his Troops to an exertion for maintaining it with him 
the position was lost, but the Enemy was not allowed to re- 
tain it long. Reinforcements having been sent up from this 
Post, composed of Regular Troops, Militia & Indians, a 
movement was made to turn his left while some field ar- 
tillery under the able direction of Capt'n Holcroft, 2 sup- 
ported by a body of Infantry, engaged his attention in 
front. This operation was soon effected, & its success is 
chiefly to be ascribed to the judicious position taken by 
Norton and the Indians with him, on the woody brow of 
the high ground above Queenston. A communication being 
thus opened with Chippawa, a junction was formed with 
further succours that had been ordered from that Post. 
The Enemy was then attacked, and after a short but spirited

conflict, he was completely defeated. I had the satisfaction 
of receiving the sword of their Commander, Major General 
Wadsworth, on the field of battle ; and many Officers, with 
six or seven hundred men were made Prisoners 1 a stand 
of Colours & a six pounder were taken their loss in 
killed and wounded was considerable. On our side, except 
the loss of one of the most zealous and gallant Officers in 
His Majesty's service, we have little as yet to deplore but 
I fear that his Provincial Aid de Camp, Lieutenant Colonel 
Macdonell, whose gallantry and merit rendered him worthy 
of his chief, is very dangerously wounded. 

I am particularly indebted to Capt'n Holcroft, command- 
ing the Detachment of the Royal Artillery, for his judicious 
and skilful cooperation with the Guns and Howitzer under 
his immediate Superintendence, the well directed fire from 
which contributed materially to the fortunate result of the 
action. Lieutenant Crowther, 41 st Regiment, had the charge 
of two Three pounders that accompanied the movements of 
our little Corps, and they were employed with very good 
effect. Capt's Dennis and Williams, Commanding the Flank 
Companies of the 49th Reg't which were stationed at 
Queenstown were wounded whilst bravely contending at 
the head of their men, against superior numbers; the for- 
mer fortunately for the service, was not obliged to quit the 
field. Captain Williams was wounded in the head, but not 
severely. 

Captain Derenzy of the 41 st Reg't brought up the Re- 
inforcement of that Corps from Fort George, & Captain 
Bullock led that of the same Reg't from Chippawa and 
under their command those detachments acquitted them- 
selves in such a manner as to sustain the reputation which 
this Regiment had already acquired in the vicinity of De- 
troit. 

Captain Glegg Aid de Camp to our lamented friend and 
General, afforded me most essential assistance: and I found 
the services of Lt. Fowler 41 st Reg't, Ass't Dep'y Qr. Ms. 
General and of my Aid de Camp Ensign Coffin, very useful. 
I derived much aid too from the activity and intelligence of 



i. Official reports, and estimates on the losses at Queenston, vary greatly. 
Lossing, drawing from official reports, gives the American lo?s at go killed, 
"about 100 wounded and between 800 and 900 made prisoners." The British 
loss in killed, wounded and prisoners was about 130. The Indian loss appears 
to be nowhere clearly reported, but was probably light.

Lt. Kerr of the Glengary Fencibles, whom I employed in 
conveying Orders to the Indians and other flanking parties. 

Major General Brock, soon after his arrival at Queens- 
ton, had sent orders for battering the American Fort Ni- 
agara. The operations against it were directed by Brigade 
Major Evans, who had been left in charge of Fort George 
this was executed with so much effect as to silence its fire 
and to force the Troops to abandon it. In these services he 
was most effectually aided by Colonel Claus who remained 
at Fort George by my desire : and by Captain Vigoureaux, 
of the Royal Engineers. Brigade Major Evans also com- 
mends highly the conduct of Captains Powell & Cameron 
of the Militia Artillery who assisted at the Batteries. 

Lieu't Colonels Butler & Clark, and Captains Hatt, 
Durand, Applegate, 1 Crooks, Rowe, Cameron, Cooper, R. 
Hamilton & McEwen, & Lts. Richardson & T. Butler, of 
the Lincoln and York Militia, led their men with great spirit. 
Norton was wounded but not badly he and the Indians 
distinguished themselves. 

I shall do myself the honor of transmitting to Your Ex- 
cellency further details, when I shall have received the sev- 
eral Reports of the occurrences of the day that did not pass 
under my observation, with the Returns of casualties, of 
arms and ordnance stores, taken &c; but I cannot now 
deny myself the satisfaction of assuring Your Excellency 
that the spirit and good conduct of His Majesty's Troops, 
of the Militia, and of the other Provincial Corps, were emi- 
nently conspicuous on this occasion. 

To His Ex'y Lt. Geril Sir GEO. PREVOST, Bart. 



ARMISTICE AFTER QUEENSTON.

SIR : I have the honour of acknowledging the receipt of 
Your Communication of this date, 2 and was pleased to learn 
at the same time, that the Officer Command'g at Queenstown

had acceded to Your proposal of sending Surgeons to that 
Post for the aid of wounded prisoners, without incurring 
the delay which would have been occasioned by a reference 
to me; but as our means of affording assistance to these as 
well as to our own wounded may be inadequate, I beg leave 
to propose that the wounded prisoners whose cases may ad- 
mit of removal, should be sent over to You, on condition of 
not serving again until regularly exchanged. 

Though the proposition which I had the honor of making 
to you to-day, did not go to the extent that, by some mis- 
take, you were led to suppose, Yet I readily concur with 
you in agreeing to a cessation of firing for three days, and 
I transmit orders to that effect to the officers commanding 
at the several Posts on this line. 

I have the honor to be &c

OPERATIONS, CIVIL AND MILITARY. 

FORT GEORGE, i3th Oct'r 1812. 

SIR: There is so urgent a necessity for my remaining 
here at present, that it becomes highly expedient that a 
Council should be summoned to assemble at this place to 
administer the necessary oaths to me, prior to my assuming 
the exercise of the Civil Government: if you, Sir, and the 
honourable Members of the Council at York concur with 
me in this opinion, I beg that you will be pleased to direct 
such steps to be taken therein as may be deemed necessary 
for accelerating the execution of the measure. 

The wind opposes the departure of the Moira and 
Simcoe, which I had intended to send over to York, but be- 
ing thus detained I have decided that they shall go direct 
for Kingston as soon as the wind will permit : indeed if it 
continues tomorrow as it is, it will be necessary to tow them 
out of the River, as the Armistice concluded between M. 
General Van Rensselaer and myself will expire at four 
O'Clock tomorrow afternoon and I have reason to believe 
that his successor in the command B. Gen'l Smyth will com-

mence active operations not long after that Period. I ex- 
pect the Prince Regent and intend to send her over to York 
to receive you and the other Members whose presence may 
be necessary here with the Clerk of the Council &c, but 
should an unlocked for change in the state of public affairs 
permit My absence from hence when that A*essel may ar- 
rive I shall embark in her and proceed to York with all 
possible despatch. 

I have the Honor to be, Sir, Your very devoted servant

SHEAFFE TO PREVOST. 

FORT GEORGE, 14 Oct'r, 1812. 

SIR : I have the honor of enclosing herewith some fur- 
ther details which will furnish additional information on 
the operations of yesterday. I now learn that the number 
of prisoners exceed 1 eight hundred, and more may yet be 
expected. I propose sending 150 of the Line over to York 
for the present in the schooner Simcoe, the only vessel here : 
and I have reason to expect the arrival of some vessels 
from York and Kingston, by which I shall send down the 
prisoners (of the line) without loss of time. 

I beg leave to add to my despatch of yesterday, that 
Volunteers Shaw, Thompson and Jarvis, attached to the 
Flank Companies of the 49th Reg't conducted themselves 
with great spirit ; the first was wounded, and the last taken 
prisoner. I beg leave to recommend these young men to 
Your Ex'y's notice. The copies of my letters to Major 
General Van Rensselaer will sufficiently explain the nature 
of his communications to me. I hope that Your Excellency 
will approve of what I have done and proposed. I have not 
been able to ascertain yet the number of our Troops or of 
those of the Enemy engaged. Ourfs] I believe did not ex- 
ceed the number of the Prisoners we have taken, and theirs 
probably amounted to thirteen or fourteen hundred. 

I shall be anxious to receive Your Excellency's instruc- 

i. "They exceeded 900; my number was 740." Note in original MS.

tions. I am sensible that I am placed in an arduous situa- 
tion which will require both your aid and indulgence. 

I have the honor, &c.. 

P. S. Lt. Colonel Macdonell, a young man of distin- 
guished merit, died this morning. 



SHEAFFE TO VAN RENSSELAER. 

FORT GEORGE, i4th October, 1812. 

SIR: Having delayed sending my accompanying Letter, 
to give General Wadsworth and the other officers who are 
prisoners, an opportunity of writing for some necessary 
Articles, I have the honor at the same time to propose an 
Exchange of prisoners, including those who were taken 
some days ago in the two vessels cut out from Fort Erie 
harbour: I have further to propose, Sir, that the Militia 
taken prisoners exceeding the number that may be ex- 
changed, shall be restored to their homes and families under 
an engagement not to serve against Great Britain or her 
allies during the War, or until regularly exchanged. 

I am &c

cated last night to Captain Dox, I send Surgeons for the 
purpose proposed. 

And I have now to request that an officer and detach-

EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. 

HEAD QUARTERS, LEWISTOWN, i5th Oct. 1812. 

SIR : Captn Dox, whom I yesterday sent to Fort George 
to make the necessary arrangement for an Exchange of 
Prisoners, being assigned for other duty this day, I now 
send Col. Winder to complete the business, and I flatter 
myself there will be no objection to this distribution. 

Col. Winder is further instructed to communicate to you 

my wishes upon several subjects; and by any stipulation 

which he may enter into respecting them I shall be governed. 

I have the honor to be, Sir, 

Your most obedt servt,

THE ARMISTICE PROLONGED. 

FORT GEORGE, i6th Octr, 1812. 

SIR : I feel too strongly the generous tribute you propose 
to pay my departed friend and chief, to be able to express 
the sense I entertain of it ; noble-minded as he was, so 
would he have done himself. 

I have directed the prolongation of the armistice until 



282 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

four o'clock in the afternoon of the nineteenth Inst. to be 
communicated along this line. 

I feel a perfect confidence. Sir, that nothing will be 
omitted on your part to assure a strict execution of the 
agreement respecting the Militia Officers and Men as well 
as any others, not yet exchanged who are released from 
their captivity. 

Allow me, Sir, to express a hope that the time is not far 
distant when the restoration of peace and amity between 
our respective countries may afford me an opportunity of 
assuring you personally of the respect and esteem with 
which I have the honour to be, Sir, 

Your Most Obedient and very devoted Servant

VAN RENSSELAER TO SHEAFFE. 

HEAD QUARTERS, LEWISTON, i6th Oct. 1812. 

SIR : I have this moment had the honor to receive your 
two Letters of this date. 

I most cheerfully agree to continue the cessation of hos- 
tilities for a time amply sufficient to discharge all duties of 
Humanity to the brave who are wounded, or prisoners ; and 
the just tribute of respect to the gallant dead. 

For these purposes I agree to the further cessation of 
hostilities until four o'clock in the afternoon of the nine- 
teenth instant. 

I shall order a Salute, for the Funeral of Major General 
Brock, to be fired this afternoon, both here, and at Niagara. 

You will please accept, Sir, of the grateful acknowledg- 
ments of Colonel Van Rensselaer and myself for your kind 
offer of any thing in your power which may contribute to 
his comfort. I do not know that he is at present destitute 
of any thing essential for him. 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 283 

As this, Sir, will probably be the last communication I 
shall have the honor of transmitting you from this station, 
I avail myself of the opportunity to tender you the assur-

THE ARMISTICE PROLONGED. 1 

HEAD QUARTERS, FORT GEORGE, 16 Oct. 1812. 

SIR : As the period assigned to the cessation of hostility 
is drawing to a termination, and the intended exchange of 
Prisoners, and sending over of the wounded and the Militia, 
will require much more time than now remains of it ; 

And as moreover part of this day is to be devoted to 
paying the last offices of humanity to the remains of my 
late brave and lamented friend. Major General Brock, I 
feel it to be my duty to propose a prolongation of the Ar- 
mistice to such a period as may be necessary for the com- 
plete execution of those humane purposes. Lists are pre- 
pared of all the prisoners here, distinguishing those of the 
Line, from the Militia : and Major Evans who has been 
appointed by me to arrange the business with Captain Dox, 
will be ready to proceed on it as soon as that officer comes 
over. I have the honor &c

Your Excellency my reports of the I3th and I4th of this

fair of Queenstown," etc. 



284 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

month, which I sent by land to Kingston, a cessation of hos- 
tilities until the igth Instant at four o'clock in the afternoon, 
has been agreed on between M. General Van Rensselaer 
and myself, for the purpose of affording sufficient time for 
carrying into effect the proposed exchange of Prisoners, the 
removal of those wounded, and for the passing over the 
Militia Prisoners ; some portion of time, too, was necessary 
for preparing and performing the ceremony of paying the 
last tribute of respect to our lamented Chief; in that, M. 
Gen'l Van Rensselaer, with a generosity highly honorable 
to his character, joined, by ordering a Salute to be fired 
both at Niagara and Lewiston, at the time of the funeral. 
The proposition for the prolongation of the armistice was 
mutual. Colonel Winder intimated to me that it was one of 
the points on which he had received instructions, and my 
letter on the subject had been sent off just before his ar- 
rival. 

The Simcoe has returned from York after lodging one 
hundred and fifty Prisoners there, and the Earl of Moira 
having arrived from thence, the remainder of the Prisoners 
will be embarked in her tomorrow morning at daylight, the 
two vessels are then to go back to York to reembark them 
at that place in the Simcoe and will then proceed together 
to Kingston. 

All the Militia Prisoners have been sent across today, 
who are not too severely wounded to be removed. I have 
permitted B. Gen'l Wadsworth to go on his parole, though 
as commander of the whole, he could hardly be considered 
as merely a Militia Officer; but from the insight which I 
have obtained into his sentiments and character I believe 
his going with the Militia will not only tend to ensure a 
strict execution of the agreement in what regards them, but 
will in other respects, produce some benefit in the actual 
state of things. 

B. General Wadsworth having requested of me as a par- 
ticular favor to permit Major I. R. Mullaney and Capt'n 
P. Ogilvie to go back on their parole, there being particular 
circumstances in the state of their families to render it of 
the most essential importance to them, I have assented. I 
trust that Your Excellency will not find anything in the 
measures I have adopted with regard to the Prisoners but 
what both humanity and policy would dictate. The Pris- 
oners that we are to get in exchange are those who were 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 285 

taken in the Detroit and Caledonia, and a few taken early 
on the thirteenth in Queenstown. Your Excellency will see 
by the returns of killed and wounded and Prisoners, that 
the Flank companies of the 49th Reg't have suffered most, 
this was owing to their having borne the brunt of the action 
from its commencement, at times contending with the most 
courageous obstinacy against far superior numbers : After 
Cap't Williams commanding the Light Company was 
wounded, which was rather early in the Day, the charge of 
the company devolved on Ensign E'd Danford, who led it 
in a manner highly creditable to him. Mr. Wilkinson a 
volunteer in the 4ist Reg't was in the action and is reported 
to me to have behaved with great spirit. 

I have requested Captain Glegg of the 49th Reg't to act 
with me as an Extra Aide de Camp, until your pleasure 
respecting him should be known : as there is no officer here 
of the Adjutant General department, may I be permitted 
to suggest that he might be employed with much benefit to 
the service as Acting Deputy Adj't General. 

Conformably with your Excellency commands I have 
issued an order for a Court to assemble at Kingston to en- 
quire into Major Heathcote's conduct in the command of 
an escort of batteaux when attacked on the i6th of Sept'r 
below Prescott. I have named Col. Vincent as Presi'd't and 
directed one Major and one Capt'n to be these members. 

Lieut. King of the Royal Artillery arrived here in the 
Moira. and knowing that it was M. Gen'l Brock's intention 
to employ him under the direction of Capt'n Holcroft and 
that his services as an officer of Artillery are at this time 
indispensably necessary I have for the present placed him 
under Capt'n Holcroft's orders. 

I received a communication yesterday by which I learn 
that M. Gen'l Van Rensselaer has given up the command 
of the Enemy's force on the other side to B. Gen'l Smyth. 

I learn from several sources that the American Militia 
Men belonging to the Corps that attacked Queenstown came 
over with reluctance, and in many instances were forced 
by violence into the boats. I have also heard since writing 
my first despatch, that many of the Enemy were drowned, 
and that a considerable number of killed and wounded were 
conveyed over to their side : but notwithstanding their loss 
on that day, I have received an intimation that they intend 
repeating the attack in a very few days, though at some 



286 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

other point, and it is signified that our left Flank will be 
their object. They received some reinforcements on the 
day of the action, and other troops have since joined them. 
I have called in more of the Militia, and have sent to Grand 
River for an addition to our number of Indians. 

I have the honor of transmitting the Returns of Killed, 
Wounded, and Missing, and of Arms, ordnance, Stores &c 
taken from the Enemy. 

I have the honor to be Your Excellency's most obed't 
hum'le Ser't

P. S. I have the honor of transmitting Captain Dennis's 
interesting report of the early transactions of the I3th in- 
stant at Queenstown. he is silent about his wound: he 
mentions volunteers Shaw and Thompson, only, they being 
attached to his company. Mr. Jarvis was with Captain Wil- 
liams company.

proposition to you that you find it necessary to reject 
especially as it was made at the particular request of 
Brigadier General Wadsworth : As that has failed I pre- 
sume that the prior agreement respecting the Indian in 
Question, which was entered into by Colonel Winder still 
retains its force, and that the Indian will be sent back 
tomorrow. Not having yet heard of the return of the 
prisoners who were to be sent over from Buffalo or Black 
Rock early this morning, according to the assurance given 
by Colonel Winder, and for whom Prisoners have already 
been sent as an exchange, I request if they have been inten-

the cause. 

Mr. Hamilton, who has been some time detained at 
Buffalo, has Brothers and other near relations in this 
vicinity who have heard some accounts of the state of his 
health by which they are much alarmed. I therefore 
permit one of his brothers to go over with a Flag to Buffalo, 
to obtain some information of him ; and I beg leave to 
propose that Mr. Hamilton shall be allowed to return to his 
friends an officer of a Rank that may be deemed equiva- 
lent being released from his parole and given in exchange 
for him.

RELATIVE VALUE OF PRISONERS. 

FORT GEORGE 18 Oct. 1812. 

SIR : I have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of 
Your communication by Captain King, Assistant Inspector 
General. 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 289 

That there was nothing said of the Indian Chief in the 
agreement respecting an Exchange of prisoners, signed by 
Colonel Winder and Major Evans, was owing to a supposi- 
tion on the part of the latter, that the case was already 
provided for by a special agreement between Colonel 
Winder and myself: that an Indian was taken prisoner, 
having been mentioned in conversation, before those two 
Officers began the discussion of the subject on which they 
were to treat. With regard to your proposition to exchange 
the Indian Chief for the men, women, and children taken at 
Chicago, or such of them as may survive: I infinitely 
regret, Sir, that it is not in my power to restore them all 
without any conditions. In the operations against that 
place, neither the British Government, nor the influence of 
its officers, nor a British Force was concerned, or probably 
your present proposition would be needless. I must there- 
fore disclaim any authority to make stipulations regarding 
them ; but whatsoever may be in my power towards obtain-' 
ing the restoration of the survivors to their friends, I shall 
most joyfully do, unconnected with the present subject of 
discussion. 

There are circumstances, perhaps, in Mr. Hamilton's 
case, that I am not qualified to discuss, and as I am anxious 
for his returning into the bosom of a family that has suf- 
fered so much on his account, I am willing to grant more 
than what perhaps ought to be deemed an equivalent for 
him. 

The late Commander of the Detroit, belonging to the 
Provincial Marine, ranks with us only as a Lieu't of 
Regular Troops. Mr. Molloy's rank is inferior to that of a 
Lieu't; but, Sir, I am desirous that the opening of a cor- 
respondence between us should be marked by a spirit of 
liberality, comformably with which I propose that for 

Mr. Hamilton 

Lt. Rolette Comm't

Mr. Molloy 
and the Indian Chief 1 these should be returned to you: 

i. That these prisoners were regarded as of exceptional importance, is 
shown by the terms of the exchange. The present editor has not identified Mr. 
Hamilton or the Indian chief. The former may have been George Hamilton, 
who was living at Newark (now Niagara, Ont.) in 1812; because he deemed 



290 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

Two Captains of Regular Troops, the two Lieu'ts you 
have named, and Lieut. Smith who took the Indian Chief, 
and the Mr. Smith, already offered with him or a Major 
of Militia as originally proposed or if you have any sub- 
stitute to name, I beg, Sir, you will make it known to me. 

As my sentiments perfectly accord with those you 
express in the opening of your proposal for continuing the 
armistice, I assent to its being prolonged indefinitely, each 
party having a right to terminate it, giving thirty hours 
previous notice. 

I am extremely sorry to learn that a British Prisoner 
has been so indiscreet as to render himself liable to punish- 
ment. I hope that he has erred from ignorance, and that 
an inquiry into the case will satisfy you that it was so. 

I have the honor &c

GEN. SHEAFFE TO SIR GEORGE PREVOST. 

FORT GEORGE, iQth Oct'r, 1812. 

SIR: After writing my despatch of yesterday, I re- 
ceived a proposition from Brigadier Gen'l Smyth, com- 
manding on the United States frontier, for prolonging the 

this frontier town an unsafe place of residence he removed to the head of 
Lake Ontario; the city of Hamilton perpetuates his name. However, no record 
is found of his having been made prisoner by the Americans. "Lt. Kerr" was 
Lt. Walter Kerr of the Glengarry Light Infantry Fencibles. James Mo.lloy, 
"conductor of King's stores," was a prisoner in the hands of the Americans at 
this time. The "Lt. Rolette" mentioned was Frederick Rolette, a British sailor 
who had served in the battle of the Nile and at Trafalgar; in 1807 he was 
appointed to the Provincial Marine, and v/hen the war opened in 1812 he was 
made a lieutenant and given comman'd of the brig Hunter. He was in com- 
mand of the brig Detroit, off Fort Erie, when she was captured by Capt. Jesse 
D. Elliott, Oct. 9, 1812. Ensign Kerr (afterwards lieutenant) was with him 
and both were taken prisoners by the Americans. (Canadian Archives, C. 728, 
pp. 151-8.) Rolette is the hero of several exploits on the Lakes. He fought 
under Barclay in the battle of Lake Erie, in which he was wounded and taken 
prisoner, when 1 as he states, in a petition for half pay, Oct. 8, 1816, he "re- 
mained a prisoner of war for near twelve months, a considerable part of which 
time he was held as an hostage by the American Government and kept in close 
confinement." Pie was afterwards presented with a sword by the citizens of 
Quebec, his home city, where he died in 1831. His career calls for a more 
full and satisfactory memoir of him than appears to have been written.

armistice indefinitely, either party having a right to ter- 
minate it, giving thirty hours notice to the other party, to 
which I have acceded, as it corresponds with the system 
adopted on our part, and removes the obstacle of my going 
over to York the wind has not permitted the departure 
of the second (and last) division of the Prisoners but it 
seems now inclined to be favorable for it, and they are 
embarking in the Moira and Simcoe to proceed for 
Kingston. Lt. Colonel Myers reports on the subject to 
Colonel McDonell. 

I am informed that Captain Loring of the iO4th Regi- 
ment (late Lt. of the 49th) has arrived at Montreal: I 
shall feel much obliged to Your Excellency to permit his 
joining me, as he came out with the expectation of being 
appointed my Aide de Camp. If my request cannot be 
granted, I beg leave to recommend him to Your Excellency 
as well qualified for the staff appointment suitable to his 
rank, should there be a vacancy. 

I this moment learn that the Prince Regent is coming in 
I shall embark in her without delay and proceed to York, 
and as I intend sending this despatch from thence by land, 
I shall close it there.

I arrived here last night and found the Moira and

The Executive Council assembled today and I was sworn 
in as a Member of it and afterwards as President, which I 
have communicated to Earl Bathurst in a despatch that 
accompanies. 

The Vessel that was supposed to be the P. R. 1 proved to 
be the Royal George, in which I came over. That ship has 
taken on board the Prisoners that had been sent to this 
place and, with the Moira and Simcoe, has just sailed for

A COMPLAINT FROM FORT NIAGARA. 

FORT NIAGARA, Oct. 2Oth, 1812. 

SIR : It is with great regret I find it necessary that my 
first communication to you since I am in command at this 
place should be that of complaint. 

A Boat was passing down the river under this shore 
from Lewistown to this place for the humane purpose of 
removing by water some wounded Militia Officers who 
had crossed the River on parole. In passing Fort George 
she is pursued by a Boat from that Fort with a British 
Officer on Board, who finally compels the Boat to cross the 
River to that Fort, and after some detention has permitted 
her to proceed. 

I learn from the Officer in charge of our Boat that the

GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 293 

alledged cause of detention was, that it was contrary to the 
stipulations of the armistice to pass up or down the River 
in Boats for either party. I have no knowledge that any 
such stipulation exists, nor can I well conceive either party 
should propose or agree to it. 

I beg you would immediately afford me the necessary 
explanations on this subject. I view it as an infraction of 
the Armistice, and consider it the more serious as it was 
committed at the spot where you reside.

SIR: Major General Sheaffe being just now on another

him; without waiting a reference to him. I lose not an 
instant to assure you, that the detention of the Boat which 
was passing down the River to your Fort, for the wounded 
officers of the Militia of the U. S., as has been agreed on 
by the American Medical Gentleman sent over here to 
ascertain the state of your wounded, and myself, was the 
unauthorized act of an individual, whom I have already 
made sensible of his error: he however states to me that 
the Boat was passing down, much nearer to our shore than 
appeared necessary.

TO STRENGTHEN THE BRITISH FORCE. 

FORT GEORGE, 26 Oct'r, 1812. 

SIR: I have been honored with your Excellency's des- 
patch of the i Qth of this month, with its several enclosures, 
apprising me of the addition of two Companies of the 
Glengary levy and of two Gun Boats, which you have been 
pleased to make to the force employed for the protection 
of the communication of the River, and, also, of the ap- 
pointment of Lieutenant Colonel Pearson to the command 
of the Lower District of this Province. 

As I conceive that Colonel Procter has a claim to re- 
muneration on account of the increase of duty and of 
expense brought upon him by the administration of the 
Government of the Michigan territory, I shall do myself 
the honor of addressing a particular representation on the 
subject to your Excellency. 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 295 

The ascendency of our Marine on the Lakes cannot, in 
my opinion, be maintained, but by the adoption of the 
measure which your Excellency has recommended to His 
Majesty's Ministers. It will be seen from Lieutenant 
Rolette's information that the Enemy is acting on that 
principle. 

An augmentation of the Artillery on this Line is par- 
ticularly desirable, it being necessary to employ too great a 
proportion of Militia men with that description of our 
force : the original selection of them was in many instances 
injudicious, and I am endeavoring to make some beneficial 
changes. 

I am still without intelligence from Colonel Procter. 

I have the honor to be &c

WATCHING THE AMERICANS. 

FORT GEORGE, 31 Oct'r, 1812. 

SIR : I have the honor to inform you that I was ordered 
to this place from Detroit by Colonel Procter on the 24th 
inst. to ascertain whether the Enemy had cut off the com- 
munication between the two places, as from Colonel 
Procter's not having received any official account of an 
action which he heard had been fought at Queenston on the 
1 3th inst., he had reasons to believe it was the case: and as 
I rec'd my information relating to it, on which I could 
depend, I was ordered to transmit it to him. Colonel 
Procter ordered me to inform you that Colonel Elliott was 
going out to the foot of the Miami's Rapids with about 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 297 

three or four hundred Indians, and on their arrival there, 
they were to be joined by more. Their object in going was 
to watch the movements of the Americans (who were 
fortifying themselves about two miles above Fort Defiance 
on the Glaize River) and, if they could do it with advantage, 
to attack them. From their having been so long in their 
present position, Colonel Procter does not imagine that it is 
their intention to advance any further into the country 
this year. Colonel Procter also ordered me to say that he 
was at a large Indian Council at Amherstburg, a few days 
before I left Detroit, and the Indians all seemed unani- 
mously inclined to support us.

EXCHANGE VALUE OF AN INDIAN CHIEF. 

HEAD QUARTERS OF THE ARMY OF THE CENTRE 
CAMP NEAR LEWISTOWN [? i Nov. 1812]. 

SIR: Your Letter dated yesterday I have this Moment 
had the Honor to receive. 

In the agreement respecting an Exchange of Prisoners 
signed by Col. Winder & Major Evans, there is nothing 
said of the Indian Chief, but any verbal agreement entered 
into by Colonel Winder will be fullfiled. 

Colonel Winder addressed a Note to Gen'l Vanrensselaer 
stating that you estimated the Indian Chief as equal to a 
Militia Major, and requesting instructions. 

I propose to Exchange the Indian Chief for the 26 Men, 
7 women, & 6 children taken at Chicago, or such of them as 
were not butchered. 

The Prisoners at Buffalo have not been intentionally 
detained, the transfer of command has prevented the order 
being given. 

The conduct of Mr. Hamilton, particularly in attempt- 
ing to cross to Canada by Night and alone, would justify 
us in treating him as a spy, but willing to proceed in a 
liberal manner I accept your proposals for his Exchange, 
the delicacy of his situation, & the importance of his con- 
nexion, will justify me in estimating him as a Captain of 
Regular Troops. 

For the Master Commandant of the Detroit, alias 
Adams, I expect a Captain of Regulars in Exchange, I 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 299 

think he ranks so by your Regulations, for Mr. Carr [sic: 
Kerr] Lt. of Marines & Mr. Mulroy [sic: Molloy] you will 
please to release Lt. Totten & Randolph. 

I am very sorry that the Moment I am writing this 
Despatch, a British Prisoner is found exploring the camp. 
I have placed him in close confinement. 

As I am averse to taking a single life or occasioning a 
single calamity, without an object, I propose a further con- 
tinuance of the armistice indefinitely, each party having a 
right to terminate it, giving thirty Hours notice to the other 
party, the armistice to extend along the frontier from the 
Lake Erie to Lake Ontario. 

I have &c

SHEAFFE TO PREVOST ATTACK EXPECTED. 1 

FORT GEORGE, 3d Nov'r 1812. 

SIR : I have at last the satisfaction of reporting to your 
Excellency the arrival of intelligence from Detroit, and 
likewise from Michillimackinac. His Majesty's schooner 
Lady Prevost, arrived some days since bringing Mr. Robert 
Dickson and Mr. Crawford. When they left Detroit, no 
other information had been received of the occurrences of 
the 1 3th of October, than that Major General Brock had 
fallen, and Queenstown was in the possession of the 
Enemy. Colonel Procter fearing that the communication 
was cut off, would not send a written communication, either 
by them or by Colonel Caldwell or Lieut. Barnard, who 
have since arrived by land : the substance of what the last 
was directed to say to me is contained in a written state- 
ment herewith enclosed to which I have added Mr. Dick- 
son's intelligence. 

Whilst engaged in writing this despatch, Lieut. Colonel 
Bishop [sic] has arrived by the way of York and has 
brought me your Excellency's despatch of the 2ist of 
October. I beg that your Excellency will accept my very 

i. Printed in Cruikshank, Doc. Hist., iv, 175-6, from the Canadian Archives. 



300 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

grateful thanks for the kind and gracious manner in which 
you have noticed my humble services : fortune and the 
comparative composition of the Corps which I commanded 
were quite adequate to the accomplishment of all that was 
effected on the I3th of October. I am much mortified to 
find that I omitted the names of Captain Chisholm, com- 
manding a flank company of the York Militia and of Lieut. 
Ball, commanding the Militia Artillery attached to the post 
of Queenstown. Captain Dennis's Report since transmit- 
ted, has partly supplied that omission : he commends 
highly both those officers, and in Justice to them, I have 
issued an Order acknowledging my omission and their 
merit. 

I send to the Military Secretary some Documents rela- 
tive to appointments which appear to me to be beneficial 
to His Majesty's service those in the Barrack department 
were authorized by Major General Brock. I transmit also 
Major Heathcote's report of the attack made on the Escort 
under his command, not being certain that a copy of it has 
been before sent down. 

The Enemy appears to be busily employed in preparing 
for another attack, and, I believe, has received reinforce- 
ments and supplies of various kinds. A number of large 
Boats has been conveyed up by land above the Falls, and 
are on the communication between Schlosser and Black 
Rock, where the greater part of their force seems to be 
collected. I have strengthened the Right of our line, and 
I intend detaching to it a portion of the Indians, of whom 
there are about four hundred here; but I shall be cautious 
of making any further diminution of the number on this 
flank. 

I suspect that after their demonstration on the frontier 
of the Lower Province, a large portion of their Troops was 
withdrawn to act against the Upper Province. 

We are yet employed in raising works for the protection 
of the interior of Fort George the Magazine is considered 
secure from the effect of hot shot. 

The Armistice still continues, and I hope will not be 
terminated before the arrival of the vessels with the sup- 
plies for the Militia, many of whom are in a very destitute 
state with respect to clothing and all in what regards bed- 
ding and Barrack Comforts in General these wants cause

discontent and desertion, but the conduct of a great ma- 
jority of them is highly honorable to them, and I have not 
failed to encourage it, by noticing it in Public Orders. 
Their number in this District has been so much increased 
since the nomination of a Paymaster for it, and his busi- 
ness is so much in arrear, that I have been compelled to 
appoint two other Paymasters for the Corps along this 
frontier.

as practicable, two Companies of the 49th Regiment, to 
consist of at least one hundred and ten effective Rank & 
file, with Officers & non-c'd Officers in proportion if the 
average strength of the Companies be greater, the full 
number belonging to them is to be sent up but sick, dis- 
abled &c are to be retained at Kingston. Also three com- 
panies of the Glengary levy, one of which is at present 
intended to be stationed at York. If the Commanding 
Officer and Staff of that Corps be at Kingston, their Head 
Quarters may for the present be established there: but 
their Major is to be with the Companies destined for this 
place. I hope that Major Clark will be in time at Kingston 
to come up with the Companies of the 49th Reg't, and also, 
some other Officers of that Corps, as well as the reinforce- 
ment of Artillery of a second Captain and fourteen men, 
which I learn is on its way to me : Many more will yet be 
wanted, for we are deficient nearly one hundred of the 
number required to complete the Batteries and field Train. 
I take it for granted, that you have a portion of Your 
Militia trained for both.

the service which may be required of them without the

in that as well as every other expense, it should be well

SIR: In justice to the memory of my deceased friend 
and predecessor, as well as to the merit of Captain Glegg, 
his surviving Aide-de-Camp, I cannot refrain from taking 
the liberty of recommending that Officer to Your Excel-

pleased to submit his claim to promotion to the Gracious 
consideration of His Royal Highness the Commander in 
chief. 

I presume to ask this in the name of the gallant and able 
Chief under whom Captain Glegg contributed to the extra- 
ordinary success which was achieved at Detroit, and my 
testimony is already recorded, that he also afforded essen- 
tial aid in the execution of the humble exploit which ter- 
minated the day on which his friend and General so 
gloriously fell in the cause of his King and Country.

and from Colonel Procter a Copy of that to him of the i8th 
with which I had one from him, apprising me of his inten- 
tion to send a further supply of provisions to you, though 
not so much as you had required, not being able to spare 
the whole quantity. I hope however, that you will receive 
enough to supply your wants till the next season if there 
are any resources within your reach, and there be any risk 
of your being in need of the aid they might supply, lose no 
time in securing the benefit of them. I hope that Your 
Boat has returned long ere this its long detention in con- 
sequence of being obliged to wait for aid from York, will, 
I trust, prove the only foundation for alarm. 

The deserter Kelly is here on his way down. The 
case of Parkes, and Magrath is reported to Head Quarters, 
from whence the decision on it must come but I cannot 
refrain from observing that I do not think it probable that 
your detaining them for the purpose of doing duty will be 
approved of, especially after having received an Order to 
send them down. 

I am glad to find that your neighbours of L'Arbre 
acroche l have changed their tone the intelligence which 
you will receive with this of our Successes in Spain, and of 
the recent operations in this vicinity will tend to confirm 
them in their sentiments of good will towards us. For the 
rest I refer you to your friend Capt'n Glegg and to the 
Brigade Major. 

I was sworn in as President on the 2Oth Oct. 

I am, Sir, your very humble Servant

EXTRACTS FROM A LETTER TO COLONEL PROCTER DATED FORT 
GEORGE, 6TH NOVEMBER, l8l2. 

"Your precautions with regard to provisions are highly 
prudent and commendable. I hope that the quantity you 
have sent to Capt'n Roberts (which you do not state) will 
prove sufficient with good management and an early atten- 
tion to securing any supplies in his reach, which I have 
recommended to him in a letter going by York and Matcha- 
dosh. The Dep'y Commissary General will write to Mr. 
Gilmore on the subject of further supplies to Your Dis- 
trict." 

"Two Companies of the Glengary Corps are at Prescott, 
and six more I suppose by this time at Kingston, from 
whence I mean to draw three of them, and two Companies 
of the 4Qth. One of the Glengary is destined for York, the 
other two with those of the 49th are to be distributed on 
this frontier : I am informed that some transports were 
in the River with Officers and men for the Reg'ts in the 
tw r o Provinces I may yet be able to send you a rein- 
forcement : but the Enemy seems to be making formidable 
preparations for another attack." 

"Colonel Nichol and his supplies are not yet arrived here. 
Lt. Col. Bisshopp, I. F. O. M. came up to Kingston with 
him, and, about eight days ago, left him to travel by land 
the wind is now fair. I detain Lt. Barnard to carry any 
further intelligence that our next arrival may bring." 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 305 

"I have represented your case, and propose 2O/ a day 
for you, or such other sum as may be deemed a sufficient 
remuneration." 

"If your wish about your Staff can be accomplished 
without detriment or risk to the service, I shall attend to it." 

"The Armistice still continues here. I confide in your 
vigilance and Activity to obtain intelligence." 



GEN. WADSWORTH S PAROLE. 

YORK, 8th November 1812. 

SIR: I arrived here last night, having come over to 
execute some Provincial business, and I propose returning 
tonight to Fort George. I found Doctor Ridmound 1 here 
and was honored by him with Your Excellency's Dispatch 
of the 27th of October : It mortifies me extremely that my 
conduct with regard to the Prisoners, and in allowing B. 
General Wadsworth to go on his Parole with the rest of the 
Militia is not approved of by Your Excellency, in adopting 
it I was encouraged by motives of Duty, conceiving that it 
would be productive of Public benefit : a similar considera- 
tion influenced me in acceding to the Armistice, which I 
shall terminate as soon as it shall appear to me to cease to 
operate in our favour to such an extent as to justify it. 

The Moira, with Colonel Nichol on Board, and the 
Simcoe arrived yesterday at Fort George with stores of 
various kinds; every exertion was making for landing 
them speedily, and I gave directions for the immediate dis- 
tribution of those Articles which the Militia particularly 
require. 

The moment that an officer of the Artillery arrives at 
Fort George, Lieut. King shall be ordered to this Post, that 
his services may be devoted to the Marine Department. 

I have directed an inquiry to be made into our Naval 
resources, and reports to be made thereon, preparatory to 
such exertions as Your Excellency may think proper to 
authorize in order to counteract the efforts of the Enemy, 

I. So in MS.; probably should read "Redmond." This letter is in Cruik- 
shank, Doc. Hist., iv, 186.

and to preserve the ascendancy of our Marine. Captain 
Earle reports in a Letter of Lt. Colonel Myers, that they 
are building "a large Vessel and several Gun Boats" at 
Sackets' Harbor. elsewhere on this Lake, as well as on 
Lake Erie, similar exertions may be expected on the part 
of the Enemy. 



EXTRACT OF LETTER TO COLONEL BAYNES DATED, YORK, 8TH 
NOVEMBER, l8l2. 

MY DEAR COLONEL : "I came here yesterday to transact 
business of some importance and shall return as speedily 
as possible to Fort George; Some of our supplies ar- 
rived there yesterday morning with Colonel Nichol. 

"As I take for granted that Colonel Vincent reports to 
head Quarters any thing worthy of communication that 
occurs within his command, I do not repeat the intelligence 
he transmits to me. 

"In one of my letters to His Excellency I have recom- 
mended B. Major Evans to be appointed to act as Dep'y 
Adj't General here, and Captain Loring as Brigade Major 
and as B. Major Evans is so soon to be promoted, I would 
beg leave to substitute Capt'n Glegg for him in that depart- 
ment but I find that he is desirous of succeeding him in 
what he holds and not in being recommended for that which 
he has not. 

"Sir George is so good as to say that Captain Loring 
shall come up to me when he arrives I shall try to make 
some arrangement to provide both for him and for Mr. 
Coffin. 

"In ordering up some of the Troops from Kingston on 
the arrival of the Glengary Companies, I gave Colonel 
Vincent a discretionary power to detain a greater portion 
if the intelligence he may have of the Enemy's movements 
or designs should render it prudent to do so. There is a 
very fresh gale now from the Eastward to push those 
Companies on."

EXTRACT FROM A LETTER TO COLONEL VINCENT DATED, YORK, 
8TH NOVEMBER, l8l2. 

"I am glad to learn that your Indians and party of 
Militia, escaped so much better from Grand Island than 
was at first reported discreet and intelligent Officers 
should always be selected for such expeditions, on which 
too much caution and vigilance cannot be used nothing 
can be more disgraceful to a party employed for the pur- 
pose of watching the movements of the Enemy than being 
surprised. 

"Your favorable report of Colonel Ferguson and Mr. 
Anderson will induce me to accede to Colonel Claus's 
recommendation and authorise their being appointed Resi- 
dent Captains and Interpreters at Kingston from the 25th 
October, which will be announced tho' you will find a ref- 
erence to you respecting one if not both in a letter I wrote 
from Fort George. 

"If the movements or designs of the Enemy should be 
ascertained to be such as to justify it, you may use a discre- 
tionary power with regard to the number to be detached 
from Kingston I allude to my order for two Companies 
of the 49th & three of the Glengary levy to be forwarded to 
Fort George : As to a force being sent from Niagara to 
Sackett's harbour in consequence of the armistice, it is not 
to be credited if there were an armistice for a fixed period 
of sufficient duration to allow time for such an operation 
as that you mention it might be effected but it would be 
as readily undertaken without any armistice as during one 
which may be terminated in thirty hours from any given 
moment: they have an advantage over us in their increas- 
ing means whilst ours are diminishing, and they must be 
fools indeed if they have not yet found out that our system 
is defensive, which adds still more to their power of annoy- 
ance. 

"I take for granted that you make a direct report to 
Head Quarters at Montreal of every thing worthy of com- 
munication."

SHEAFFE TO PREVOST MOVEMENT OF FORCES. 

FORT GEORGE, i6th Nov'r, 1812. 

SIR: I was honored on the I4th Instant with your Ex- 
cellency's dispatch of the 3Oth of Oct'r by Capt'n Loring; 
he, also, brought me a report from Co'l Vincent of the 
attack made on the Royal George in the port of Kingston 
by the Enemy's flotilla from Sackets harbour; though it 
retired without having effected much mischief, the attempt 
indicates great confidence in their strength, and, perhaps, 
was made with a view to discovering ours at that point, and 
the position of our batteries: the Moira sailed from York 
on the afternoon of the nth Inst. and on the following day 
there was a fall of snow, with a fresh wind from the north 
west. I have therefore hopes of her having arrived at 
Kingston unmolested by the Enemy, who, probably, had 
thought it prudent to return to his own port: the Moira 
had on board a twenty four pounder captured at Detroit, 
with some ammunition for it. It was intended for Prescot, 
but if it fortunately arrive safe at Kingston, Colonel Vin- 
cent will no doubt think it prudent to detain it there. The 
wind has blown fresh from the North west for many Days, 
and has kept the Prince Regent 'here: a Rifle company is 
going over to York in that vessel, and I send in her the 
necessary aid for preparing a furnace for heating shot. 

I transmit information recently received from the other 
side; the force of the Enemy is variously stated, but I 
believe it to be nearer the smallest than the greatest number 
assigned to it. Doct'r Redmond having completed his in- 
spection of the Hospitals in this district, will proceed to 
York in the Prince Regent, and go down from thence by 
land. The Lady Prevost is reported to have arrived today 
from Detroit, the letters she may have brought are not yet 
come down; it is now late and I shall tomorrow add any 
intelligence I may receive by her 

I have the honor to be Your Excellency's, Most ob't and

SIR: I have the honour of transmitting to your Excel-

supported than it deserves. During the period that he has 
acted with me on this frontier, I have been indebted in an 
eminent degree to his experience and exertions, and I beg 
leave to recommend his pretensions to Your Excellency's 
countenance and protection, feeling assured that the ac-

the highest claim to favour and consideration.

JOY AT CESSATION OF ARMISTICE. 1 

FORT GEORGE, i9th Nov. 1812. 

SIR: I have the honor of acquainting your Excellency 
that about half past eight o'Clock this night, I received a 

i. Printed from Canadian Archives, in Cruikshank, Doc. Hist., iv, 222. 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 311 

Letter from Major Ormsby, Commanding at Fort Erie, 
dated at half past twelve this day, enclosing a Letter 
addressed to him from Brigadier General Smyth, Com- 
manding "The Army of the Centre" as he styles it, in which 
he announces that the Armistice is to terminate at "nine 
o'Clock tomorrow evening the 2oth instant." 

The despatch which this accompanies was intended to 
go by Dr. Redmond in the Prince Regent to York, but the 
arrival from Detroit having given me some intelligence to 
add to it, and there being another vessel at my disposal, and 
the Prince Regent having on board what might be essential 
to the defence of York, the wind being fair, I allowed her 
to sail. Unfortunately the wind soon after shifted and has 
detained the other vessel, but if the wind should not prove 
favorable early in the morning, I shall send off an Express 
by Land. 

Lt. Colonel Bisshopp returned this Evening from a 
second inspection of the Militia. He had heard on his way 
down of the approaching termination of the armistice, and 
imparted the intelligence to some of the Corps stationed on 
his route, who received it with strong marks of joy: but I 
should wish to have had possession first of some essential 
articles for them, that are yet at Kingston. Shoes particu- 
larly, of which, it unfortunately happens, that but a small 
portion has been brought up. I should have been glad too 
to have been joined by the Party of Artillery, before the 
Rupture of the Armistice. As it is, I almost dispair of 
their coming here. Winter seems to have set in. A strong 
North west wind has been blowing nearly a fortnight, with 
the intermission only of the short period, which permitted 
the sailing of the Prince Regent. 

Whatever may be the event of another conflict with the 
Enemy, I feel confident, that the Troops in general that I 
have the honor to command, will perform their Duty. 

I have the honor to be, &c., 

R. H. SIIEAFFE.

312 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

AN EXCHANGE OF SHOT. 

FORT GEORQE, 23rd Nov. 1812. 

SIR : Having formed the resolution of opening a fire on 
Fort Niagara after the expiration of the Armistice, with 
a view to cripple it for a cooperation in any projected early 
attack on this Flank, and to create a diversion in favor of 
the other flank should the designs of the Enemy be directed 
against it, it being reported that his main body was assem- 
bled in front of it, preparations were accordingly made for 
the purpose and the fire was commenced on the morning of 
the 2 ist instant. I had previously set out for the right 
Flank, thinking that my presence might be more required 
there, those able officers Lt. Col. Myers and Captain Hoi- 
croft being here to conduct the operations, assisted by 
Brigade Major Evans, under whose direction they had been 
so successful on the I3th October. The Report which I 
have the honor of transmitting will inform your Excellency 
of the Events of the day; the advantage tho' not so great 
as might reasonably have been expected, is however on our 
side. The old building in front of Fort George, that was 
burnt, intercepted the view of the beach from a commanding 
position. The damage done to the buildings in the Fort 
can be repaired in two or three days, none of the guns or 
works have been injured, and we have only to lament the 
loss of an Inhabitant, an old Half Pay Officer, Cap't Fry 
[Frey], who was killed whilst employed in collecting shot 
(as he said to send back to the Enemy), and one Private of 
the 49th Regiment. Some of the houses of the town were 
damaged, particularly two or three of them, but not one was 
burnt tho' it was found that the Enemy's shot were in gen- 
eral heated. His expenditure in ammunition must have been 
very great, his fire having been very quick, it was, of course, 
ill directed. The number of his shot already collected and 
added to our piles, probably exceeds that which was fired 
by us. The extent of the mischief done by our fire cannot 
be ascertained, but from the observations made, as noticed 
in the accompanying reports, the damage and loss that the 
Enemy suffered must have far exceeded ours. 

In my visit to the other part of the Line, I observed two 
large camps, one at Schlosser, and the other below Black 
Rock ; the Troops appear to have been withdrawn from 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 313 

the former, the other is partly concealed by an Island. I 
did not discover many men near it. Their greatest assembly 
of Troops is said to be near Buffaloe, and is not visible from 
any part of our Line : Indications have been discovered of 
their preparing boats for a movement. I have directed some 
Indians to be sent on Grand Island secretly to watch their 
motions. Lieut. Colonel Bisshopp, whom I find an active 
and intelligent officer, is at present on that Flank; Major 
General Shaw, who commanded there, with the rank of 
Colonel in the Militia, and the pay of Lieut. Colonel, having 
relinquished the command to return to the duties of Adju- 
tant General of Militia, in which his services were much 
wanted. The number of the Militia in the field has consid- 
erably increased since the notice was given of the termina- 
tion of the Armistice, but it is partly in consequence of 
measures that had been previously adopted for calling in 
absentees; they are very alert at their several posts and 
continue generally to evince the best disposition. Some old 
loyalists, who bore arms in the American War, have come 
in, tho' exempt from service in the Militia. I retain them 
for the present as they are still capable of stationary service, 
and their lessons and example will have a happy influence 
on the Youth in the Militia ranks. 
I have the honor to be &c

ACTIVITY OF THE ENEMY. 

FORT GEORGE, 23rd Nov'r, 1812. 

SIR: I have this day received a packet from York, con- 
taining a Letter from Colonel Vincent, apprising me of the 
return of Paymaster Brock, 1 49th Reg't, from Sackett's 
Harbour, and of the intelligence brought from thence by 
him. It fully confirms that which had been previously 
received thro several channels, of the activity of the Enemy 
in preparing the most formidable means for establishing a 
superiority on the Lakes. If the weather at this advanced 
period should counteract their design of employing them

against us this season, and we should be fortunate enough 
to maintain our military Positions in this Province during 
the Winter, it will require exertions of the most energetic 
kind to enable us to contend with them in the Spring for 
the ascendancy on the Lakes, to obtain which engages the 
particular attention of the American Government as being 
necessary to the attainment of what is evidently the main 
object of the War, the possession of the Upper Province 
with an ulterior view to establishing a control of the numer- 
ous Indian Nations. 

I have the honor of transmitting to your Excellency a 
copy of an address which I have received from the Com- 
mittee of the Executive Council of this Province, respect- 
ing the comparative state of its Marine. The subject is 
indeed interesting, and has a special claim on the attention 
of the Guardians of the Public Welfare. 

I am informed by the Deputy Commissary General that 
the sum in the Military Chest will soon be exhausted. I 
therefore hope, if there be not a supply of money on the 
way to us, Your Excellency will be pleased to order one to 
be forwarded without delay.

AN ATTACK OPPOSITE BLACK ROCK. 1 

CHIPPAWA, 3oth Nov'r, 1812. 

SIR : I have the honour of reporting to Your Excellency 
that very early in the morn'g on the 28th an attack was 
made on our batteries opposite to Black rock, they were 
wrested from us for a time by Superior numbers; but 
Major Ormsby of the 49th Reg't with a body of Troops 
from Fort Erie having formed a junction with Lieut. Co'l 
Bisshopp who had moved up with great celerity from Chip- 
pawa with reinforcements; those of the Enemy who had 
not retired to their own shore, amounting to nearly forty, 
were made prisoners, with Capt'n King, who had com- 
manded in the attack. 

i. In Canadian Archives. Cruikshank, Doc. Hist., iv, 252. 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 317 

On receiving information of the attack I went up, hav- 
ing previously ordered a movement of some Troops to 
strengthen those posts, from which reinforcements had been 
detached to the right flank; on my arrival there, I found 
the Enemy in great force of which he seemed to make an 
ostentatious display, some on shore, some in boats, and 
perhaps with the hope of its giving effect to a summons 
which Lieut. Co'l Bisshopp had received to surrender Fort 
Erie. 

When I approached the ground opposite to Black rock 
several large bodies of the Enemy were seen moving down- 
wards ; I suspected their intention to be either to advance 
from the bottom of Squaw Island in aid of a direct attack 
above it in front of Black rock, or that a design against this 
post, or some lower point was in contemplation. I there- 
fore caused some detachments that I had passed on the 
road, to be halted opposite to the foot of Squaw Island, and 
I remained there till night approached, when I set off for 
this post. I continue here as being a central situation, in 
which I can quickly receive intelligence from either ex- 
tremity of the line. 

It appears that in the affair of the 28th the loss on our 
part, if not the early success of the Enemy, was chiefly 
owing to his having been mistaken for friendly succour 
coming from some neighbouring quarter. 

Captain FitzGerald of the 4Qth Reg't was employed to 
carry to Black rock Lieut: Co'l Bisshopp's answer to the 
summons he received ; he saw B : General Smyth who 
desired him to survey his force he counted fifty-six large 
boats with men in them, and there was a great number of 
Troops on shore, in all, he thought, about five thousand, 
and he saw six scows with a field piece in each, and Horses 
with every appurtenance for field movement. 

I have not yet received Lieut : Co'l Bisshopp's official 
report, nor the Returns of the Killed, wounded, and Miss- 
ing. I wait for them to despatch an Express. 

Lieut. Co'l Bisshopp deserves high commendation for 
the spirit and activity he displayed, and great credit is due 
to the officers and men who acted under his orders. It was 
unfortunate for the service that those valuable officers 
Lieut. King of the Royal Artillery, and Lieut. Lamont of 
the 49th Reg't, were so early disabled, otherwise the most

THE OPERATIONS OF NOV. 28TH. 1 

FORT GEORGE, 4th Dec'r, 1812. 

SIR: Some circumstances rendering my presence here 
necessary, I came down yesterday from Chippawa. 

I have the honor of transmitting Lieut. Co'l Bisshopp's 
report of the operations of the 28th of Nov'r, with a return 
of the Killed, wounded and missing which I received yes- 
terday evening. I also inclose sundry other documents, 
among them is a Proclamation by B. General Smyth, its 
character altogether is such as reflects the greatest discredit 
on those who could authorize its publication : it has not yet 
fully answered its purpose. From the information in some 
of the accompanying papers Your Excellency will perceive 
that a want of mutual confidence existed between the Gen- 
eral and his Troops ; this is confirmed by intelligence I 
received this morning from Lieut. Co'l Bisshopp, that 
Assistant Surgeon Steele, who had been taken prisoner on 
the 28th, had returned bringing the information that B. 
General Smyth had been forced to leave Buffaloe because 
he had declined moving his Troops across the River. The 
night before the last I received a dispatch from Co'l Procter, 
the substance of which is herewith transmitted: it was 
brought by Lieut. Merritt of the Provincial Dragoons, who 
was employed to convey the supply of cash and army bills 
to Dep'y Ass't Commis'y Gen'l Gilmore who writes to the 
Dep'y Commissary General that he feels confident of 
being sufficiently supplied with provisions until the opening 
of the navigation without further aid from him, which is 
fortunate, as a considerable quantity destined for Amherst-

burgh has not been forwarded, circumstances having con- 
spired to prevent it. 

Our military chest is so nearly exhausted, and there are 
so many demands on it, that I have given my sanction to 
the Dep'y Comm'y General to issue notes, a transcript of 
the form of which is transmitted to the Comm'y General.

SIR : I am directed by Major General Sheaffe to forward 
to you the inclosed notification of Appointments in the 
Indian Department. 

Colonel Vincent has been ordered to send you a state- 
ment of the period, at which the Gentlemen holding the 
Situations, commenced acting in them, as no information 
on that head has as yet been received by the General. 
I have the honor to be &c

THE SITUATION SURVEYED. 

FORT GEORGE, Qth Dec'r, 1812. 

SIR: I have to apologise to your Excellency for the 
omission of intelligence from Colonel Procter, when I dis- 
patched my letter of the 4th inst. in which it was referred 
to. I now have the honor of transmitting it. Appearances 
on the other side agree with accounts we have lately re- 
ceived. There are few men to be seen. The weather is 
cold for the season, but as yet there is but little snow. 

The desertion of our Militia has increased since the 
beginning of this month, but I expect the voluntary return 



320 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

of many: I hope that the rigor of the season and the state 
of the River will soon permit my authorising at least for a 
time the absence of a large portion of the Militia. When 
a bridge of ice shall be formed between us and the Enemy, 
it will require all the force we can muster to afford a chance 
of maintaining our position, and indeed the whole will prob- 
ably be inadequate to the task of preventing occasional 
predatory incursions. Some days ago a twenty-four 
pounder (from Detroit) that had been remounted on one 
of the Batteries opposite to Black Rock, burst, but for- 
tunately did no other mischief than wounding Capt'n Kerby 
of the Militia Artillery slightly in the hand : The Gun has 
been replaced by an 18 pounder. A vessel having the ap- 
pearance of one of the Enemy's gun boats was seen yester- 
day morning about 10 or 12 miles to the Eastward, near the 
American shore. A bitter north west wind was blowing last 
night and still continued: She had probably run back to 
Sacket's Harbour. 

The weather has not permitted a communication by water 
with York since the 2ist of November, and it is now deemed 
prudent to lay up the Prince Regent there. Colonel Vincent 
has adopted the same opinion respecting the Royal George 
and Moira at Kingston, that it would be attended with too 
much hazard to allow them to sail, he therefore proposes 
laying them up there, in which he does not forsee any disad- 
vantage. There will at least be some inconvenience in their 
being separated from the naval depot, and they run more 
risk of injury from the Enemy at Kingston. I shall impress 
on Colonel Vincent the necessity for taking every precau- 
tion for their security. 

I have the honor to be &c

THE MARINE ESTABLISHMENT. 

FORT GEORGE, i6th Dec'r, 1812. 

SIR: Capt'n Gray arrived here on the I4th and delivered 
to me your Excellency's dispatch of the I5th of November. 
Lt. Colonel Myers will set out as speedily as possible for the 
Lower Province, and will take with him all the information 
that can be collected of the means which this Province can 
furnish for aiding in the execution of the plan which is 
proposed for the improvement of our Marine Establish- 
ment to such an Extent as shall, at least, raise it to an 
equality with the force preparing by the Enemy ; but for 
this important purpose it must be owned, that assistance of 
the most essential kind must be drawn from sources that 
are not even under your Excellency's control besides ship- 
wrights, rigging, guns, and equipment of various sorts which 
the Lower Province may be able to supply officers and 
seamen from the Royal Navy will be required : an addition 
of some heavy guns will be necessary for the defense of 
the ports of Kingston and York : it is desirable, too, to have 
some Gun Boats carrying guns of a large calibre but the 
construction of these must probably be deferred as a 
secondary consideration, as it is not to be expected that we 
shall be able to engage at once in preparing every kind of 
vessel which may be deemed useful : Captain Gray will 
return to York and Kingston to give the necessary direc- 
tions for commencing the work, and for putting in a state of 
active operation all the aids that we can command for con- 



322 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

tributing to its progress. The detail of the proposed plan 
will be taken down by Lt. Colonel Myers : I have the 
honor of enclosing a general sketch of it. It mortifies me 
extremely to have to report to your Excellency that both 
sickness and desertion increased among the Militia after 
the date of my last despatch indeed the desertion was 
chiefly owing, I believe, to the distress in their families from 
sickness, and the want of assistance in various ways, either 
for providing for their comfort or their subsistence during 
the winter: it must be confessed, too, that the Militia 
were but ill prepared for such cold weather as we have 
experienced. The clothing for them came up so late that 
with our defective means we could not get it made for them 
in time and it unfortunately happened that but a small 
part of the shoes provided for them had arrived at Kings- 
ton when Lt. Colonel Nichols sailed from thence with the 
supplies which he brought up ; the aid that we could obtain 
in shoes and leather from the neighbouring parts of the 
Province was too scanty to answer the demand, especially 
as [incomplete] 1 



i. This letter complete is in the Canadian Archives, and continues as fol- 
lows: 

"a considerable number of Indians, too, were to be supplied. The consequence 
was that a deficiency of shoes was rapidly increasing, and some men were disabled 
from doing duty for want of them. Under all these circumstances, it became 
necessary to adopt the means of giving my sanction to the absence of the battalion 
companies and to one flank company of each regiment, in order to prepare the 
way for an arrangement for rendering the militia force on this frontier more 
numerous and efficient at a short distance of time. I hope to have it effected in 
the course of two or three weeks, and that the enemy in the meantime will not be 
in a state to make an attack in such force as to overpower the resistance that can 
be opposed to them. I ought not, however, to conceal from Your Excellency my 
opinion that we must continue to be befriended by good fortune as well as by the 
defective plans and organizations of the enemy to enable us to maintain this posi- 
tion through the winter, even with all the aid that the best exertions of the militia 
may afford us, for it appears probable that the efforts of the enemy will be directed 
to this point, where it must be known that we are weak in number, with but little 
hope of reinforcement. 

"B. General Smyth is reported to have returned to Buffalo. 

"Captain King, who commanded the American troops in the attack on our 
batteries near Fort Erie, and is now a prisoner here, has applied to be liberated 
on his parole, which I have declined granting until it shall be authorized by 
Your Excellency. He is a bold and enterprising spirit, and appears to be held 
in high estimation on the other side. A private of the 4Qth pretends that he 
saw him some years since at Portsmouth under sentence of transportation, that 
he is an Irishman and his true name Mafrey. The soldier is at Fort Erie. I 
have sent for him that I may interrogate him myself on the subject. 

"1 have ordered a General Court Martial to be assembled for the trial of 
three deserters, taken in arms against us: one at Michilimakinac, one at 
Queenston, and one with Captain King."

SHEAFFE TO COL. VINCENT. 

FORT GEORGE, 2oth Dec'r, 1812. 

SIR: I have received your letters of the 7th and i4th 
Dec'r. 
i. I shall send instructions about contingent expenses that 

remain unpaid. 
2. Lt. Col. Pearson is written to by the Adj't General of 

Militia. 

3. It seems proper that Lt. Cobbett should be allowed 
forage for one Horse, it may be charged for accord- 
ingly. 

4. Colonel Ferguson's plan is not practicable. 
5. Colonel McLean's [ ?] letter communicates the success 
of an enterprise, which both in the plan and execution 
reflects great credit on all who had a share in it. Mr. 
Plucknett's arrival affords me great satisfaction and I 
hope that the shipwrights &c are also by this time with 
you. 

Captain Gray will send instructions to Mr. Plucknett 
concerning them as well as himself. Many useful hands 
can be collected to assist in the proposed work, tho' I fear 
that the Ranks of the Militia must furnish a great majority 
of them, if they should be wanted. 

I recommend to you to have boarding pikes always at 
hand for your workmen, indeed if you can manage to have 
longer Pikes, they would be preferable, tho' the longest 
Ship-Pike may answer sufficiently well. I have established 
a Post with York twice a week, but I begin to think it too 
often. Other opportunities are so frequent that it is per- 
haps harrassing the Dragoons unnecessarily. Once a 
week to and from Kingston will probably be quite enough. 
Let me have your opinion thereon, and where it is proposed 
that the Dragoons between Fort George and Kingston shall 
meet to exchange Mails at York or on the other side of it? 
It appears to me necessary that something should be 
done at Gananoqui, if not elsewhere on the route from 
below to afford protection to the communication. 

I cannot find the plan of Colonel Stone's to which you 
allude. It may be at York among my predecessor's Papers. 
Nothing of a defensive nature can be constructed at present, 
except a block House which you may authorize to be built

ment of the end proposed.

GUN BOATS FOR LAKE ERIE. 1 

FORT GEORGE, 22d Dec. 1812. 

SIR : I have had the honor of receiving your Excellency's 
despatches of the 23d of Novem'r and 3d Dec'r. I derive 
the greatest satisfaction from learning that we are to have 
the aid of so many shipwrights &c immediately. With the 
addition of the number of workmen that the country can 
furnish, there will no doubt be sufficient to prepare the 
Hulls, Masts and Iron work, quite as soon as the other 
essential parts will be in readiness : 

I hope that your Excellency will soon have favorable 
intelligence respecting the officers and crews. I have not 
yet heard of the arrival of the Lady Prevost at Amherst- 
burg: If Captain Hall has escaped the tempestuous weather 
that succeeded his departure from Fort Erie, and has 
reached his destined port, he will be directed to proceed to 
Quebec unless it should appear that his presence at Am- 
herstburg can not be dispensed with. 

Besides a vessel similar to the Lady Prevost, it is pro- 
posed to add two Gun boats on Lake Erie, Colonel Procter 
have represented that they would be of great utility. The 
general sketch of the plan proposed for the increase of the 
provincial navy, to which I alluded in my letter of the i6th 
was not enclosed in it, Capt'n Gray having told me that he 
was sending down a full report on it. 

Mr. Deputy Commissary General Couche's representa- 
tion may prove just, tho' I think it improbable that there 
will be, to such an extent, a failure of supplies, as to make 
us dependent on the Lower Province. The peculiar situa- 
tion in which this has been placed for many months, will no 
doubt have the effect of diminishing its resources. 

A restriction on exports will become necessary if the 
War continues, but whether it will provide sufficiently for

the probable increased consumption must be uncertain, as 
it will depend on a variety of contingencies, that may 
baffle the most plausible calculations

FROM COMMODORE CHAUNCEY. 

BLACK ROCK, 25th Dec. 1812. 

SIR: Upon my arrival at this place I was mortified to 
learn that a party of three sailors had crossed the River on 
the 28th ulto and burnt two houses the property of indi- 
viduals. This act I assure you Sir was done without the 
knowledge of the Naval Officers then commanding on this 
Station, and the men have been made sensible of the im- 
propriety of their conduct. 

I will also assure you that as far as in my power to pre- 
vent, no similar act shall be repeated by the men under my 
Command. 

I understand that these Seamen were taken on the 
morning of the 28th ulto in company with some Soldiers, 
and are now Prisoners at Fort George. I trust, Sir, that 
you will not hesitate to let those men return, when I assure 
you that I hold Colonel Vincent's receipt for Captain Brock, 
and the officers and crews of the Mary Hatt and Elizabeth 
taken by the squadron under my command upon Lake 
Ontario in Nov. last, and who were sent to Kingston im- 
mediately after, upon their Parole. Lieut. King is in a way 
of recovery. I will send him over upon his parole the 
moment that he can be removed with convenience to him- 
self. 

I have the honor to be very respectfully your obed & 
humble ser't

A DESERTER EXECUTED. 1 

FORT GEORGE, 2Qth Dec'r [1812] 

SIR: I have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of 
Your Excellency's Letters of I7th & iQth by Mr. Mc- 
Gillivray with a copy of the Treaty for the release of 
Prisoners of War on their Parole, and for their eventual 
exchange. 

Captain Gray has reported his having commenced the 
preparations for building the vessel intended to be con- 
structed at York, and has proceeded to Kingston to give the 
necessary directions for the work to be executed there. He 
will send a Report down from thence, if further assistance 
of artificers should be deemed necessary from the Lower 
Province. An express has been sent to Amherstburg with 
instructions for building a vessel there of the size of the 
Queen Charlotte and it is intended to construct two Gun 
Boats for Lake Erie, or to purchase or hire vessels for the 
purpose, as may be found most advantageous for the 
service. 

I regret exceedingly that I have to communicate the Death 
of D. A. Q. M. G 1 1 Dewar. Colonel Procter in a Letter to 
a Lt. Colonel Myers, recently brought down by a private 
opportunity, reports his having died suddenly in conse- 
quence of the bursting of a blood vessel. Col. Procter has 
appointed Lt. Troughton, R. A. to act in the Q'r M's GenTs 
Department, of which I have approved until your Excel- 
lency's pleasure be known. I hope that Lt. King's services 
will soon be restored. The last report I received of Him 
was favorable. In case of his return a new appointment 
might be unnecessary if that of B't Major Clerk's should 
be confirmed, of which however a doubt has occurred to 
me, founded on there being two Captains of the 49th already 
on the Staff. Lt. Troughton's appoint't I consider merely 
temporary, as his active services as an Artillery officer may 
be required after a short interval. Copies of the proceed- 
ings of the General Court Martial, on the trial of three 
Deserters, are transmitted, with my orders thereon, which 
I hope will meet with your Excellency's approbation.

in the Enemy's Ranks, on the 28th Nov. last was executed 
yesterday. He confessed his guilt, acknowledging that he 
had given to the Enemy all the aid in his power, and had 
probably caused the Death of one or more of his old com- 
rades. For all which he declared his penitence and 
sorrow. 

Lt. Col. Myers has had a violent indisposition from 
which he is not yet sufficiently recovered to go out, and 
there is reason to apprehend that he would be exposed to 
great danger in going down at this rigorous season to such 
a climate as that of the Lower Province. I hope that Your 
Excellency will be pleased to permit his remaining in the 
Upper Province during the Winter, or at least until its 
severity be passed.

FORT GEORGE, ist Jan'r, 1812 [sic: 1813] 

SIR : L. Colonel Myers having made an application to 
me in favour of Capt Chambers of the 41 st Reg't to act in 
the Q'r M's Gen'l dep't and it being strongly supported 
by the active and useful services in which that officer has 
been employed, I request that you will lay before H. E. The 
Commander of the Forces my recommendation that he 
should be attached to the Dep't either as a substitute for 
B. Major C. if his appointment should not be confirmed, or 
otherwise, as an additional aid to it, if His Exc'y should 
deem one to be necessary, in consequence of the death of 
Lieut. Dewar, and the uncertainty of the period at which 
the services of Lieut. King may be restored to the depart- 
ment.

AS TO EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS. 

FORT GEORGE, ist Jany, 1813. 

SIR: Having received from His Excellency the Com- 
mander of the British Forces a copy of the Treaty entered 
into with Major General Dearborn commanding the Forces 
of the United States, for the release of Prisoners of War 
on this parole, and for their eventual exchange; I have 
therefore to request, that conformably with the fourth 
article thereof, you will be pleased to send to me, the names 
of American Prisoners of War now on their Parole, whom 
you wish to have exchanged for the British Prisoners of 
War who have been liberated, and whose names are in 
your possession. 

I have the honor to be &c

SHEAFFE TO CHAUNCEY. 

FORT GEORGE, 4th Jany, 1813. 

SIR : I have the honor of acknowledging the Receipt of 
your Letter of 25th Dec'r. Brigadier General Smyth, soon 
after the burning of the two houses to which you allude, 
thought proper to explain, in a Letter addressed to the 
Commanding Officer at Fort Erie, by what means that act 
had been committed, and to declare his disapprobation of it. 
I receive with great satisfaction the assurance of your par- 
ticipating in his sentiments on the occasion. 

I regret that it is not in my power to accede to your 
Proposal for the release of the American seamen taken on 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 329 

the 28th November. The Treaty for releasing on their 
Parole, and for the eventual exchange of Prisoners, entered 
into between General Dearborn and Sir George Prevost, 
not providing for such a case, I must wait for authority to 
liberate those men. It is not however to be expected that 
more Prisoners will be sent over from hence on their 
Parole, until the Officer Commanding the United States 
Forces on the Niagara Frontier, shall have performed on 
his part, what remains to be done for the completion of the 
exchange of those who have been returned to us, on their 
Parole : For Captain Brock, I have no doubt that a Captain 
of the United States Army has been released. If the officers 
and crews of the Mary Hatt and Elizabeth have not been 
exchanged, it will be necessary that I shall be furnished 
with their names and with authority from His Excellency 
Sir George Prevost, to enter into a negotiation for their 
exchange on which I shall without delay apply for in- 
structions. 

R. H. S. 



To Commodore CHAUNCEY. 

P. S. I beg you will accept of my thanks for your pleas- 
ing account of Lieut. King, and for your assurance of send- 
ing him over on his Parole when he can be removed with 
convenience. The name of the officer of similar rank of 
the U. S. Army, now on Parole, may be sent with him, for 
their mutual exchange.

DETAILS OF THE SERVICE. 

FORT GEORGE, 5th Jan'y, 1813. 

SIR : T have the honor of enclosing herewith to be laid 
before His Excellency the commander of the Forces a 
Memorial which I have received through Colonel Vincent 
from officers of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment who 
served on board His Majesty's vessels on Lake Ontario 
last year. 

I request to be instructed at what rate a charge will be 
admitted for the travelling expenses of officers who are 
ordered to go by land from one post to another in this 
Province: a provincial act directs that a Cart or Carriage 
with two Horses or Oxen shall be furnished on a warrant 
from a Justice of the Peace at the rate of seven Shillings 
and six pence a Day, and two and six pence for the Driver, 
and not to be compelled to go more than thirty Miles a Day. 

Col. Claus Dep'ty Superintendent General of Indian 
affairs has represented to me the necessity of a supply of 
stationary for his Department, none having been received 
by it since the Year 1809. and that the storekeeper and 
clerks have supplied their offices for two years at very 
extravagant prices, for which even it can no longer be 
procured. 

I beg to be informed what allowance is to be granted to 
the Acting Fort Major. 

The duties of the Fort or Garrison sergeant have been 
and continue to be so harrassing, and are attended with so 
much expence for stationary, that I have added six pence 
a day from the 25th last month, to the shilling before

granted to the Sergeant who acts in that capacity, whose 
conduct in it has been highly meritorious.

PROVISIONS, PAY FOR MILITIA, ETC. 

FORT GEORGE, 6th Jan'y, 1813. 

SIR: I have received this day a communication from 
D'y Com'ssry Gen'l Couche of which I have the honor of 
transmitting a Copy. The issues of Provisions have con- 
siderably diminished in this District and will remain some 
time much below their late amount. At York and Kingston 
they will continue to be at least as great as they have for 
some time been, owing to the increase of the Marine estab- 
lishment at those Posts. At Amherstburgh it appears prob- 
able that the consumption will be increased during the 
Winter as many sources of supply that the milder season 
furnished to the Indians will no longer exist. The several 
Corps and Departments in this Province have been com- 
pelled to apply to the Commissariat for pecuniary aid, it 
not being found practicable to obtain money from any 
other source. 

As the pay of the Militia, and other Provincial expenses 
have been furnished by the Commissariat, and it probably 
not being regular that such monies should be finally ac- 
counted for through it, it may be necessary to establish 
some mode, whereby the Province should be made account- 
able for them, through its proper officer, the Receiver Gen- 
eral. I request your Excellency's advice and instructions 



332 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

on this Head, as it appears to be of importance that a plan 
to regulate such matters, should be speedily adopted, for 
the simplifying and facilitating the settlement of the public 
accounts. 

I propose going to York in the course of a few days, the 
passage of the River being impracticable, and likely to 
remain so for some time. 

It has been suggested to me that two or three Battalions 
might be formed in this Province, if encouragement were 
given by a promise of land &c. A proposition has been 
made to me by a Major of the Militia, to raise a Corps of 
2 or 300 Men in York and its vicinity, and to increase it by 
inlistments elsewhere to 5, or 600, not to serve out of the 
Province but in such cases as it may legally be required of 
the Militia. I beg leave to submit this subject to your Ex- 
cellency's consideration, with the hopes of being honoured 
with an early intimation of your opinion thereon, and of 
the principles on which you would recommend and approve 
of the formation of such Corps. It is thought by some that 
the inlistment of a Militia man is prohibited by the 23d 
Article of the Militia Act, passed the 5th of last August, 
but such a construction appears to me to be controvertible. 

I have the honor to be &c

I shall not urge the necessity of a considerable reinforce- 
ment for this Province, convinced of its being obvious to 
your Excellency, that it will be required to resist the aug- 
mented force, which the Enemy will probably direct against 
it, and to aid in protecting our Dock Yards from the early 
attempt which will no doubt be made to defeat our efforts, 
for reestablishing a naval ascendancy.

DETAILS OF THE SERVICE. 

FORT GEORGE, loth Jan'y, 1813. 

SIR: I have received your Letters of the 2Qth Dec'r ist 
& 4th Jan'y. Mr. Couche has written so urgently on the 
subject of money, that I hope your complaint is ere this 
removed. 

I have referred Colonel Stone's proposition to the Adju- 
tant Gen'l's consideration and Reports thereon Lt. B radish 
will [be] attended to. I hope that the Block House is 
finished well planned and wisely placed. Insist on the 
necessity of guarding vigilantly against surprise. I send 
some observations on the Proceedings of the Court of 
Enquiry if it were so intended the order should have 
directed the Court to declare its opinion, but in this case 
perhaps it would have been better to have merely stated the 
information, when its need and in what manner should have 
appeared in the complaint. You may either insert the 
Remarks I enclose, in your Orderly Book, or adopt any 
other mode of making them known, that you may have 
reason to prefer. 

Mr. O'Brien was not forgot. Mr. Wm. Ross is not on 
Mr. Couche's list. He was sent by Commissary General 
Robinson to assist Mr. Ross in making up his accounts. A 
Recommendation from you to the Commissary General 
might be of use to the young man. I hope that you have 
sent with the company of 49th on its way up, arms & 
accoutrements to replace those lost with articles of cloth- 
ing, &c &c. I take it for granted the losses and wants have 
been reported to you by Major Ormsby. 

The shoes are much wanted. If there should be any- 
thing required for the public service, which it may be 
necessary to send for to the Lower Province, and to have 
supplied without delay, with a report to Head Quarters, 
send a duplicate to Major Gen'l De Rottenburg at Montreal.

VALUE OF THE INDIAN FORCE. 

Military Secretary's office, 
QUEBEC, i4th Jan'y, 1813. 

SIR: The Commander of the Forces desires I will im- 
press upon your mind the great advantage which may 
result, in the Defense of Upper Canada, from the timely 
cooperation of an Indian Force; Therefore trust your 
arrangements with Mr. Dickson will be principally directed 
to that most desirable object.

CLAIMS OF THE INDIANS. 

FORT GEORGE, i7th January, 1813. 

SIR: I am directed by Major General Sheaffe to transmit 
to you the accompanying Letter from Colonel Claus, D'y 
Sup't Gen'l of Indian affairs, and to request that it may be 
laid before His Excellency the Governor in Chief. 

It is impracticable to obtain the money in this Province 
to satisfy the claims of the Indians. It has been due to 
them several months and even if cash could be got for Col. 
Claus' bills as Trustee, a loss would be sustained owing to 
the rate of exchange, that Government, it is conceived, would 
not allow to fall on the Indians. Major General Sheaffe 
therefore begs to propose for His Excellency's considera- 
tion that the sum of [blank] be remitted to the D'y Com- 
missary Gen'l about five hundred of which to be in silver, 
and the remainder in the smaller army notes, to be paid in 
to the hands of Colonel Claus, for his Bill for that amount, 
as Trustee for the six Indian Nations. 

I have the honor to be

SUPPLIES FOR THE TROOPS. 

FORT GEORGE, Jan'y 25th, 1813. 

SIR: Major General Sheaffe has directed me, in ref- 
erence to an order for the officers to procure supplies of 
necessaries for their men from the Lower Province, to 
request that you will lay before His Excellency the Com- 
mander of the Forces his suggestion, that supplies of 
clothing and necessaries for the Troops here, may be pro- 
vided and sent up by the Commissariat to be issued. Major 
General Sheaffe is induced to propose this measure from a 
conviction, that the procuring the articles necessary for the 
soldiers comfort from so great a distance, particularly at 
this crisis, would be attended with much more difficulty 
and even risk, than the Individuals commanding companies 
could be enabled to surmount, or bear the heavy responsi- 
bility of. 

Major General Sheaffe requests you will procure from 
His Excellency the Commander of the Forces information 
on the following heads, Viz : Rates of Pay and allowances 
for Q'r M's General, Adjutant General of Militia and 
Assistants, of D'y Paymaster General, and Clerks. Some 
regulations and instructions for the payment of Militia. 
For the D'y P. M. Gen'l and Paymasters. Forms of Esti- 
mates and Pay lists.

SERVICE OF ROBERT DICKSON.

Confidential 

SIR : The Commander of the Forces having been pleased 
to appoint Robert Dickson Esq'r Agent and Superintendent 
for the Indians of the nations to the Westward of Lake 
Huron, I have the honor to acquaint you thereof and to 
[send] you an extract of a Letter received by me from the 
Military Secretary, which' will further point out to you the 
wishes of His Excellency upon this subject. 

Mr. Dickson proceeds to Amherstburg, and he will lay 
before you the instructions he has received from Sir George 
Prevost it therefore only remains for me to call your 
particular attention to affording all possible aid and facility 
in your power, towards promoting the important object in 
view. 

Mr. Dickson will make known to you from time to time 
his progress in calling together the Indian Warriors of the 
Nations alluded to. The application of their services will 
be guided by circumstances, and upon which future instruc- 
tions will be issued. 

As it is essential that a certain and quick mode for the 
conveyance of the Dispatches which Mr. Dickson may have 
occasion to transmit to me, or that I may wish to forward 
to him, should be established, he will point out to you the 
Routes by which it is proposed to make such communica- 
tions. 

Capt'n Norton accompanies Mr. Dickson to Amherst- 
burg, and as soon as he has finished the business on which

PROPOSES A CORPS LIKE BUTLER' S RANGERS. 

FORT GEORGE, 4th Febr'y, 1813. 

SIR : I have the honor to address your Excellency on the 
subject of Colonel Caldwell, who is the bearer of this 
Letter. He is brave, zealous and loyal, and is held in high 
estimation by the Indians. He is connected by marriage 
with the family of Mr. Baby at Quebec, from whom any 
further information which your Excellency might think 
necessary could be obtained. 

The object of his visit below is to make a proposition for 
forming a Corps similar to that in which he served as 
Captain during the last American War, called Butler's 
Rangers. By a letter from Colonel Procter of i3th Jan'y 
to a copy of which forwarded by me to the Military Sec- 
retary, I beg leave to refer your Excellency, it appears that 
the Indians in council have formally, as Colonel Procter 
says, "requested the aid of such a Corps (Butler's Rangers) 
as were attached to and acted with them during the last 
War, and that Captain Caldwell, whom they well know, 
and think highly of may be employed." 

I cannot but approve of Colonel Pfocter's suggestion in 
the Letter referred to, that it would be beneficial to com- 
mence with the formation of one Company. 

I have the honor to be

THE COST OF WAR. 

FORT GEORGE, Febry 8th, 1813. 

SIR : I have the honor to acquaint you that the D'y Com- 
missary General has handed me a statement for the sev- 
eral sums advanced by him to this date, for Provincial 
Services in Upper Canada, amounting to ^25,000 Army 
Pay. I am therefore to request that you will be pleased to 
grant your Warrant to that amount, in favor of the Re- 
ceiver General of the Province. And as a farther sum will 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 339 

be required immediately in aid of the civil chest, I beg you 
will be pleased also to grant another Warrant for 12,000 
Army Pay, and that the Commissary General may be 
directed to forward the amount to the Receiver General. 
The average Provincial expenses arising out of the War 
with the United States, may be stated in ROUND sums, as 
follows : 

Amherstburg and Detroit 2,000 per month 

Long Point 500 - 

Fort George and Dependancies 5,ooo - 

York 800 - 

Kingston 2,000 -

FORT GEORGE, Qth Feby. 1813. 

MY DEAR COLONEL : I send you extracts from a Letter I 
received last night from Colonel Procter. You will see 
that he was very anxious for a reinforcement, which I hope 
arrived very few days after he wrote. From the informa- 
tion of those who met it on the Route, I have reason to 
believe that it reached its destination on the 6th or at the 
latest on the 7th. I sent him all his light Company, and the 
addition of Artillery men will no doubt be highly accept- 
able to him. I feel no doubt of Sir George's approbation 
of the movement. Some Barrack Bedding accompanies 
them with some supplies for the Militia. The Provincial 
Legislature is summoned to assemble on the 25th instant, 
before which time I hope to be quite restored to health, 
tho' my recovery does not keep pace either with my wishes 
or expectations. I am advised to abstain as much as pos-

sible from business, but business, especially at such a time, 
must be done. You may discover my weakness in my 
writing. I cannot yet enter on the task of a long Dispatch 
to Sir George. I am establishing the systems recommended 
for the payment of the Militia. I hope to learn soon how 
these things are done below. 

I propose issuing to the General Staff of the Militia, and 
to officers of the Flank Companies, that were out during 
the last Campaign, 200 days Bat and Forage if Sir George 
approves of it. I understand from a Letter of yours, that 
a similar issue was made below. I have also to request His 
Excellency's authority for forming a corps of Artillery 
drivers, on terms like those on which there is now one 
raising in the Lower Province, and also for the purchase of 
an additional number of Horses. Captain Glegg has already 
written by my directions, on these subjects, and has trans- 
mitted a Return to serve for further explanation. It would 
be highly useful, too, that it should be placed in my power, 
to give some additional encouragement to serving in the 
provincial Artillery. Neither my Head nor my Hand is in 
a State to enter more largely into these subjects. I have 
ordered clothing from Montreal for those two Corps, some 
of which, at least, I hope to get up this winter. Our 
Session will probably be short, but I think it will not be 
unproductive of benefit to our Militia System.

SUNDRY MEMORANDA. 

FORT GEORGE, i2th Feby, 1813. 

SIR: I am directed by Major General Sheaffe to forward 
to you the two accompanying Letters from Colonel Procter 1 
together with a copy of the Resolutions of a Party of the 
Inhabitants of the Territory of Michigan, referred to by 
him. The Papers were brought express by Mr. Mackintosh 
who met Mr. Dickson and Capt'n Norton on their route to 
Amherstburg, and was informed by them that about a hun- 
dred of the grand River Indians were assembled and ready 
to march. He afterwards stopped at the house of Mr. 
Tew [ ?] of the Indian Depart't by whom an express was 
sent for those Indians to proceed immediately to Amherst- 
burg and directions have been sent up for as many more to 
follow them as can be assembled. Orders have been like- 
wise forwarded by Lt. Col. Bostwick of the Oxford Militia, 
who happened to be here for the Middlesex, the Oxford 
and Norfolk Reg'ts of Militia, to march immediately under 
Colonel Talbot to reinforce Colonel Procter. 

Major General Sheaffe desires me to say, that he does 
not deem it prudent to detach any farther portion of the 
Regular force from this line, the Enemy being in great 
force and there being a bridge of ice between us. The 
Militia of this District are called in.

THE SPECIAL CORPS SERVICE. 

YORK, 7th March, 1813. 

MY DEAR GENERAL: Colonel Caldwell set off yesterday 
with a sketch of a plan for forming a Corps to act with 
the Indians &c: it appears to me that a Corps for that 
purpose should have superior pay to one of any other 
description, and I am of opinion that you will hardly be 
able to procure proper subjects for such service on the 
terms proposed. The moment you have ascertained it to be 
so, lose no time in apprising me of it, and of stating to me 
the plan that, in your opinion, would most effectually accom- 
plish the purpose, without exceeding the terms which were 
granted to Butlers Rangers Sir George seemed to think 
them objectionable pay from 2/6 to 4/ N. Y. C. 1 a day, 
according to the degree of merit and ability, I conceived, 
would be but reasonable, in the present time, for service of 
such a nature : A sum for an out-fit would be assented to 
and (as you may think best) you may either recommend 
clothing to be provided for them (describing the kind) or 
that a sum be granted in lieu of it, to be paid quarterly, 
halfyearly, or otherwise the annual amount to be specified. 
I send you some information respecting the terms on which 
some corps are about being raised being the substance of 
three General Orders issued here by Sir George Prevost. 
I have directed printed Copies to be prepared, some of 
which I shall send up with Speeches, Addresses, Answers, 
&c - &c. I expect hourly to hear of a movement from be- 
low when it is announced, I shall order some troops from 
hence to replace your Gren'r Company, and as many more 
of the 41 st as will make your number equal to five comp's: 
those attached to Head Quarters will probably not go up 
until the opening of the navigation.

AN INCORPORATED MILITIA. 

YORK, i3th March, 1813. 

SIR: I have the honour of informing Your Excellency 
that the Session of the Legislature of this Province will 
close this day: there are some amendments to the Militia 
act which promise some benefit, and others of rather a 
doubtful character, the test of experience may however 
decide in their favor. 

I have directed a copy, of the titles of the Bills which 
have been framed to be prepared for Your Excellency to 
accompany this letter, and I shall as early as possible 
transmit a copy of the Acts themselves. An Incorporated 
Militia is to be formed of volunteers to serve during the 
War with the United States with a "Bounty" of Eight 
Dollars this bounty is granted in compliance with my 
suggestion of an "Outfit" : the House was restrained, I 
believe from granting a larger sum by the consciousness of 
its limited means the Speaker told me that he wished they 
could have raised the sum for each man to twenty dollars 
all the unappropriated funds of the Province are, however, 
placed at my disposal, but there will be so many other 
demands on them that I shall not be enabled to add to the 
bounty, which I think too small for the purpose may I

MONTREAL, nth March, 1813. 

"You will adopt every measure within your power for 
securing during the continuance of hostilities the cordial 
cooperation of the Indian Tribes, and you will instruct the 
Officers in that Department acting with them that His 
Majesty's Government entirely concur in the expediency 
of my suggestions of the necessity of securing their Terri- 
tory from encroachments and that in consequence wherever 
negotiations for peace may be entered into, the security of 
the Indian possessions shall not be either compromised or

PAY FOR VOLUNTEER MILITIA. 

YORK, 1 8th March, 1813. 

SIR: After dispatching the Letter which I did myself 
the honor of addressing to Your Excellency on the I3th 
instant, the importance of forming without delay an efficient 
force from the Militia, and of giving effect, at its first pub- 
lication to the new plan adopted for that purpose, struck 
me so forcibly, that I determined to offer in the instructions 
I had prepared, an additional sum of ten dollars to each 
volunteer for the Incorporated Militia. I hope that the 
critical situation in which the Province is placed will justify 
me for having adopted the measure, without waiting for 
an answer from Your Excellency to my application on the 
subject.

GUN DRILL ON SHIPS. 

YORK, 2ist March, 1813. 

SIR: I have received yours of the isth instant with 
Colonel Cartwright's recommendation of Ensign Markland 
as Ass't Quarter Master General for the Midland District, 
but circumstances have come to my knowledge since I 
desired to have a Report on a fit person to fill that office, 
which induce me to decline nominating any other person 
than Donald McDonell until I shall have heard from him, 
that he is unwilling to accept it. 

I recommend to you to establish as frequent a practice 
as circumstances will permit in the exercise of the Guns 
on board Ship, and occasionally to fire them in the course 
of the practice, loaded with small charges. It must be 
ascertained that every Man is acquainted with the manner 
in which the Gun or Carronade is to be secured and that 
they are all instructed generally in what may be required in 
loading, firing &c &c, and not confined to the practice of 
one part only. A few experiments may be made with shot 
charges to discover the range &c the force of the recoil, 
and whether the Gun or Carronade is properly secured. It 
is of particular importance that every man should be ac- 
quainted with the Post and part assigned to him, and that 
previously to real action, he shall be so well instructed as 
to be able to acquit himself well in it. 

I have the honor to be &c

PREFERMENT FOR COL. MYERS. 

YORK, 29th March, 1813 

SIR: I have received your Letter of the 26th instant 
with its several enclosures. You may announce to Lt. Col. 
Claus, & to Lt. Col. Clark that I approve of the officers 
recommended. I hope they will succeed in forming Ten 
companies each. This place and the communication from 
it up and down have increased so much in importance, that 
I think it proper to appoint as Commander of this District 
arid that of New Castle an officer of Rank who is qualified 
for such a situation, and as Colonel Myers appears to me 
on all accounts the most eligible for it, I enclose an order 
nominating him to it, which you will communicate to him 
before it is given to the Deputy Adjutant General for pub- 
lication. It is my wish to see him here, as soon as he has 
finished any business which it may be indispensably neces- 
sary that he should complete before he leaves Fort George. 
I send a Warrant for the transfer of a Sum of money from 
Mr. Couche to the D'y Pay Master General of Militia to 
whom I mean to send also a sum to pay the Provincial 
Bounty for Volunteers. As I have not received any report 
from Mr. McDonell of the amount of his estimate, I have 
left a blank in the Warrant which you will have filled up 
with such sum as may appear to you to be required. The 
leading sleighs of Captain LiddelFs party have arrived I 
mean to send it by Water with the supplies of neces- 
saries &c. 

You will please to give the necessary directions for the 
constructing of huts, and the fitting up of houses which may 
be required as quarters for any of the Troops the Esti- 
mates of which are to be prepared by the Engineer pro- 
visionally approved by you. 

The disbursements for these services are to be made by 
the Commissariat. 

I am very anxious to be at Fort George, but I must 
remain here till the arrival of Colonel Myers. 

The Boats that take the Glengary Company can bring 
the Deserters with an escort, which may return in one 
Boat, if we have not a vessel in Motion by that time. 

There are not any Saddles here. Perhaps there are some 
in the Indian Store. Colonel Claus may be able to lend Lt.

SIR: The increased importance of this place and of the

and also to appoint an officer of suitable rank, and of ex- 
perience and ability, to the Command of these Districts, I 
have directed Colonel Myers to repair to this Post to assume 
the Command in the Home and Newcastle Districts. This 
nomination is moreover recommended by the benefit that 
the Marine Department is likely to derive from his having 
the Dock Yard here immediately under his Eye, and the 
communication with that of Kingston so much shortened. 
I trust that this appointment will meet the approbation of

essentially necessary for the Indians in general in his neigh-

PLANS TO ATTACK FORT NIAGARA. 

SIR: I transmit herewith copies of sentences of General 
Courts Martial assembled at Kingston on some Militia 
Men, and I request that you will be so good as to aid me 
with your advice on their cases : I have thought it proper 
to accompany the notice of them in public orders with the 
implied intention of sending them to Quebec, because it may 
operate beneficially: two others were tried for offenses of 
a similar nature. 

A Document is sent to Mr. Freer which shews the prob- 
able amount of the advances made by the Commissariat on 
account of this Province to 24th March inclusive: The 
Estimate for the Month ending at that period amounted to 
nearly 7,000 and that to 24th April will probably exceed it. 

The last information of the Enemy at Niagara states 
their number much lower than it has been supposed to be. 
Two hundred are said to form the Garrison of Fort 
Niagara: This intelligence has encouraged Brig'r General 



362 GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK. 

Vincent to propose a plan for an attack on it with four 
hundred Men : for which purpose it seems that more boats 
are required, than we can at present command besides it 
was thought a necessary part of the plan to employ the aid

operation, if we possessed the means of effecting it, would 
not accord with the principle adopted by y'r Excellency 
with regard to Sackett's Harbour, as communicated in y'r 
private Letter of the i8th March, which has arrived since 
I began this Letter. 

I enclose a Letter to me from Norton as it seems to

the Militia only) of Captain and allowances. 

I have written to Mr. Couche respecting any vouchers 
for Militia expenses in your District which he may have

been favorably decided on. 

I wish to have a Report from you on the app't of Pay- 
masters in your Districts. A Letter from the D'y Pay M 
Gen'l says : "Mr. McLean informs me that he is no longer 
Pay Master, a Lieut. John Kerr having been appointed 
from 25th Febry." This requires explanation, as I am 
ignorant of any authority having been given for such an 
appointment. I some time ago asked for information on 
the competency of one Paymaster, in your two Districts : I 
will thank you to furnish me with it.

NEWS FROM THE WEST SHEAFFE TO PROCTER. 

YORK, 6th April 

MY DEAR GENERAL : I have this day received a Despatch 
from Head Quarters informing me that half a company of 
Artillery The Kings Regt. 6 comp'ys of iO4th four comp's 
Glengarys, and four companies of Voltigeurs were ordered 
to reinforce me. On the arrival of the Kings & Glengarys 
at Fort George all the 41 st are to be sent up to you and 
part at least with all possible expedition. By the first op- 
portunity you will forward to Captain Roberts the detach't 
of Veterans destined for him last year. There are about 
forty more to be selected from those at Kingston and sent 
up as early as possible. I have lately rec'd Letters from 
him to I9th March. Gen'l Clark with 4000 men was 
ascending the Mississippi, with the intention of gaining 
Lake Michigan by the Quisconsin, 1 from which there is but 
a short distance to Waters that run into that Lake. 

The Sioux and Neighbouring Indian Tribes had declared 
a determination to oppose the Americans, who are encour- 
aged by a belief that they are without ammunition but 
Capt'n Roberts had sent Ten Barrels of Powder to the 
principal War Chief of the Sioux, & directed all that could 
be found in the Traders stores to be taken for their use. 
It has been signified to me in a Letter from the M. S. that 
it is His Excellency's wish that Capt Roberts' demands may 
be complied with as early as the Season will admit and that 
directions would also be given to that end to the Depart- 
ments concerned, at Quebec. Provisions, Ammunition & 
sundry Articles for the Indians are what he will most want, 
supplies of which, or such as you can possibly spare, you 
will cause to be forwarded agreeably to His Excellency's 
Commands. There are Provisions destined for Amherst- 
burg at Long Point (at Charlotteville I understand) for 
which it will be prudent to send as early as possible. There 
is something in the retiring of Norton that seems to dis- 
please Sir George Prevost. Be so good as to explain the 
matter to me. You will not neglect to convey to all the 
Indian Nations our auxiliaries, with the customary cere- 
monies, the assurance rec'd from His Majesty, that in the 

i. One of the early forms of "Wisconsin," more properly "Otiisconsin."

event of a negotiation the security of the Indian Territory 
will not be forgotten. The answer to the Memorial from 
the Western District is transmitted to Mr. Pattinson. 1 I 
am informed by His Excellency that he has appointed Mr. 
R. Dickson D'y Superintendent of Indians in Michigan and 
the conquered Territory and he recommends to me "to vest 
in B'r Gen'l Procter sufficient authority to enable him to 
support Mr. Dickson in his organization of the Indians 
from the Westward, and in his endeavors to check the 
prodigal expenditure of Provisions and to establish strict 
impartiality in the treatment they experience from us; so 
that His Majesty's gracious bounty may flow thro' the chan- 
nel in which it was intended." 

You will therefore act conformably thereto, and it is 
farther required that all practicable means be adopted to 
soften the ferocity of the usual mode of warfare of the 
Indians, and to restrain them in it. 

I send a packet for Capt. Roberts open that you may see 
the plan of Local Fencibles, which was prepared before they 
had learnt below, what had been adopted by this Legisla- 
ture. I of course do not mean to act on these "Conditions" 
tho' Captain Roberts is instructed to do so. They are better 
calculated for him than the Incorporated system : indeed it 
can not be extended to Mackinac, nor can the eight dollars 
be given to Local Fencibles. I hope soon to hear about 
your proposed Corps.

MORE TROOPS FOR THE NIAGARA. 

YORK, 7th April, 1813. 

DEAR SIR : I have caused a statement to be transmitted to 
H'd Quarters of the probable amount of the sum for which 
a warrant will be required to relieve you from the charge of 
the Militia Vouchers. 

I do not think it fair to trouble the D'y P. M's Gen'l of 
Militia about disbursements prior to his app't. I therefore 
mean to have those vouchers to which you allude put into 
the hands of the Inspector Gen'l of Provincial accounts. 

I trust that every exertion is making to add to our num- 
ber of Batteaux. We shall feel the want of more of them 
in the movement of the Troops now on their way to Niagara 
from below. Lt. Col. McDonell Comm'g at Prescott & 
Lower District informs me that Boards of acct's are ordered 
to assemble at Prescott and Cornwall, but that some 
vouchers which have been sent up are wanted to assist the 
Boards in certain cases. If you have any such will you be 
so good as to transmit them to Lt. Col. McDonell. I have 
written to B. Gen'l Procter & recommended him to send as

Provisions collected there for his district. He is also 
directed to forward some to M Mackinack.

with Gen'l orders for movement of Troops &c. Boats sent 
for to Fort George and Head of the Lake, and orders go 
down by Major Bouchette for all that can be found about 
the Lake shore & head of Bay of Quinte, to be assembled 
at carrying place. I some days ago sent down an officer to 
press a Boat or two to bring up some naval stores that have 
been left on the route. We have but few Batteaux at 
present at Fort George & this Post, but some are building 
at both places. B'r Gen'l Vincent is instructed to have the 
companies of 41 st in readiness to move to Amherstburg. 
25 picked Veterans were sent to Amherstburg last year 
with intention of being forwarded to St. Josephs'. Gen'l 
Procter is directed to embark them in the first vessel for 
M Mackinac, and I shall instruct Colonel Pearson to have 
40 selected Men of same corps ready when they can move 
in Boats. 

A copy of the "Conditions" has been forwarded to 
Captain Roberts, with instruction to offer 18 dollars bounty 
according to the spirit of them, as there cannot be any 
Incorporated Militia at Mackinac. I transmit copy of 
Letter from Lt. Col. McLean applying for Capt'n Mc-

MY DEAR GENERAL: There is an error about the War- 
rant, it was sent to be filled up with the sum that the D'y 
Pay M'r Gen. would require for the Month. As for his 
Estimate of 9546: sj\ di 1 /^'. it does not agree with the 
one sent to me which was under 7000. Colonel Pearson 
has been written to about Mr. Shaw and Macauley. Lt. 
Colonel Shortt if he decline the leave he asked for, must of 
course go up with his Regt. The Proposition between the 
officers and Men of the Militia is monstrous. Supernumer- 
aries must be employed in collecting their men. My inten- 
tion respecting the head of the Lake, was, to send 60 men 
from the 2d York & 4th and 5th Lincoln, with Major Hatt, 
Capt'n Wm Crooks to join the Detach't of Regular Troops.

MY DEAR COLONEL: The companies of Captains Mc- 
Pherson and Roxburgh 1 are here with the exception of part- 
of that of the former the boat in which it embarked not 
having been able to keep out on the Lake for two or Three 
Days past, the weather having been too boisterous. It has 
also prevented other boats coming from the head of the 
Lake but it being moderate today I have sent five boats 
down, and I expect some from the westward, which will 
probably enable me to despatch further aid to the Troops 
below : I do not mean to give them the assistance of boats 
further than the head of the lake, as from thence the road 
is much better both for Marching and for waggons. The 
wind & weather have retarded the fitting out a sloop which 
I have caused to be purchased, but I hope to have her ready 
in a day or two to go to Newcastle to bring up some troops, 
baggage & Stores. I propose leaving Capt'n McPherson's 
company here at least for the present, and to place Colonel 
Young here with the command in the Home and Newcastle 
district giving him Two Companies of the Kings. I have 
not yet heard from Fort George since the date of my last 
Letter. I suppose the Ice is in motion there and prevents 
any communication between the two sides. Lt. Col. Hughes 
arrived three days ago, and is employed in establishing

YORK, i Qth April, 1813. 

SIR: I have the honor of transmitting to your Excel- 
lency the copy of a Letter which I have received from Mr. 
Dickson, with extracts of Letters from Brigadiers Generals 
Vincent and Procter, and the Copy of one from Capt'n 
Johnston 49th Regt, respecting Lieut. Dudley, U. S. Navy 
lately taken Prisoner. He and his companions have not 
yet arrived here; they must be detained here, a short time 
as all the Boats I can procure will be employed in bringing 
up Troops Stores & Baggage. One Company of the Kings 
has proceeded to Fort George, a half company arrived last 
night, and goes on to day, and I expect a comp'y (Capt'n 
Goldrick) at noon which will also proceed to day, and 5 
boats go down the Lake to bring up the Militia Clothing 
(which I have just learnt has been left about 70 miles from 
hence.) and also to furnish aid to the Troops on their 
march. I have for some time daily expected the arrival of 
Col. Young, having been informed by Lt. Kerr Glengary's 
that he was to come on without delay, for Fort George but 
I have the mortification of being told today that he is to 
remain at Kingston until his Regt has passed that post. I 
have however consolation for having been so long detained 
here, in the belief that it has proved in some degree bene- 
ficial to the service. I have written to Col. Young to hasten 
his progress towards me. 

Capt'n Norton is here and is so urgent for my assent to 
his going back to Detroit, pleading that he had engaged his 
word to the Indians there for his speedy return that I can- 
not withhold it; he promises not to stay long away from 
me, but I part with him, even for a short time, with great 
reluctance. R R g

Quarters respecting the new Corps. I ordered your 6th

the cause of its detention. I have given positive orders that 
the Companies of the 41 st shall be pushed on in succession 
as those of the Kings arrive. The remainder of the 3d 
Comp'y goes on tomorrow and a number of Boats have gone 
and are going to assist the others. The suggestion of the 
Dorchester Mills [ ?] will be attended to. There is no 
other "Warrant" necessary for the Gen'l Court Martial 
than my order for its assembling &c I have no objection 
to establishing Capt'n Woods as Acting Judge Advocate, 
and Appointing Col. J. Baby President. Indeed it would 
have been more regular that the Complaint should have 
come thro' him. I believe it was made direct to the Adj't 
General by his Brother. Colonel Claus will be consulted on 
the proposed appointments in his Department. I enclose a 
copy of the new mode of paying the Indian Department at 
Amherstburg, which I have proposed in a Letter to Head 
Quarters. I have sent to Sir George a copy of Mr. Dick- 
sons Letter. Norton leaves me at the time that his aid is 
likely to be most essential to me. He is the only leader of 
Indians that I can repose confidence in or expect much 
assistance from, and that I thought more peculiarly my own 
as being attached to the Indians near the Niagara Frontier. 
He promises to stay but a short time but that will be a criti- 
cal one. You will not neglect sending Captain Roberts as 
early as possible all the aid he needs which you can spare 
he complains of ill health.

ton in Upper Canada, on the I3th of October 1812 to recall 
to Y. Ex'y notice their pretensions, entertaining the hope 
that they will be deemed worthy of your support, and that 
you will be pleased to recommend them for a similar dis- 
tinction. 

I have the honour of enclosing herewith the names of 

i. An erroneous spelling. John Chrysler's farm, where the battle of 
Nov. n, 1813, was fought, was on the Canadian shore of the St. Lawrence, 
between present Morrisburg and Cornwall. It is usually called the battle of 
Chrysler's Field, and sometimes the battle of Williamsburg, from a near-by 
village.

TO EARL BATHURST. 

PENZANCE, 7th June, 1815. 

MY LORD: I have the honour of transmitting to Your 
Lordship copies of letters &c which I have addressed to H. 
E. Sir G. Prevost, the purpose of which not being, I trust, 
such as will expose it to Your Lordship's disapprobation, I 
venture to hope that it will be honoured by your fav'ble 
consideration and support. 

I have the honour to be &c 

R. H. SHEAFFE 
The R. Hon'ble Earl BATHURST. 

EDINBURGH, 23rd June, 1819. 

MY LORD : I hope that I shall not be deemed intrusive & 
troublesome in requesting that I may be favoured with a 
copy of the letter which Y[our] L[ordship] so courteously 
promised to address in my behalf to H. R. H. the Comm'r 
in Chief ; but, if the pressure of public business have as yet 
prevented Y. L's attention to a subject comparatively so 
trivial, may I be allowed to entreat that in addition to the 
favour which I already owe to Y. L's goodness, you will be 
pleased to transmit the letter through me, as I have a docu- 
ment to lay before H. R. H. which I am particularly desir- 
ous should have the support which a testimonial from Y. L. 
is so well calculated to afford. 

I have the honour to be &c 

R. H. S. 
The R't Hon'ble The Earl BATHURST. 



AFTER MANY YEARS. 

EDINBURGH, Qth Dec'r, '48 

SIR : I have the honour of forward'g herewith a Memo- 
rial in Duplicate addressed to you by Captain Carmichael 
the Paymaster of my Reg't (the 36th) the state of whose 
health is such as to render him desirous of retiring from the 
service, and should he be permitted to do so I beg leave to 
recommend as his successor in the Office of Paymaster Q'r 



GEN. SHEAFFE'S LETTER BOOK, 381 

M'r Stuart of my Regiment who is in all respects well 
qualified to perform the duties of the Office 

I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most Obedient 
Humble Servant

Geril & Col. 36th Reg't 



IN BEHALF OF QUARTERMASTER STUART. 

EDINB: 8th June, 1849 

SIR : I had the honour of receiving yours of the 4th late 
yesterday, in which you request me to submit for your 
approval the name of an officer not under the rank of Lieut, 
duly qualified to succeed to the Paymastership of the 36th 
Regiment, but not knowing of the claims or pretensions of 
any other person but those of Q'r M'r Stuart, I again 
venture to plead for them: on the score of finance his 
appointment would be a saving to the Public, as he is 
entitled to a much higher rate of half pay than 4/ per 
diem. Dr. Russell, the surgeon of my Reg't being in London 
perhaps you may deem it proper to call upon him for a 
Medical Certificate unless the inclosed opinion from him be 
deemed sufficient. Every officer in my Reg't is so inter- 
ested in Mr. Stuart's welfare on account of his high char- 
acter that I feel justified in stating that the result of my 
exertions in his behalf will be anxiously looked for by the 
whole Regiment. 

I have the honour to be Sir, Your most ob't hble Servant, 

R. H. S.
