The question--'When shall we meet'? is already answered; but I must
now answer it anew, and for a more distant day; perhaps Wednesday,
perhaps Thursday; but you will hear again. Your letters amuse me; your
recovery rejoices me; your determination not to torment yourself is
neither from philosophy nor spleen--it is mere words, and an attempt
to deceive yourself, which may succeed for the moment; 'ergo', no
determination; 'ergo', not founded on philosophy; 'ergo', not on
resentment; 'ergo', neither. I have no doubt but 'chose' is on the
way; the journey cannot at this season be performed in thirty days.
</p><p>
My compliments to A. C. M., and am very much obliged to them. It is
the most fatiguing thing imaginable for such crude tastes as those of
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and A. B. You had better apologize. You are sick and I am
absent. But you have not mentioned the day--neither that of the
beauty's ball, for which I owe you much ill will, and therefore my
next shall be to 'Natalie', to whom all good wishes.

You must be weary of hearing that "I have not yet a line from you, and
that John and Alexis are not arrived," but you must submit to hear
often of what so often employs my thoughts.
</p><p>
Most of all, I amuse and torment myself by fancying your occupations,
your thoughts, your attitudes at different hours in the day and
night--generally I find you reading or studying; sometimes musing; now
and then counting the time of my probable absence. In comes C. C.--a
pleasant interruption, or a note from C. C., and then follows trouble
and embarrassments, and sometimes scolding. They are always answered,
however.
</p><p>
We have agreed that the cause of Le Guen shall come on next Tuesday.
It will last the whole week. The week following I shall hope to leave
this place; but I may be deceived, for the court may take a week to
consider of the business, and I cannot leave the ground till the thing
be determined.

Your letter by this day's mail, dated the 13th, and postmarked the
12th, is one of those hasty and unsatisfactory scraps which neither
improve you nor amuse me. I pray you never to write to me with the
mere motive of getting rid of the task. These performances always lead
me to fear that all other tasks are performed in the same manner; but
adieu to tasks and reproaches. I will endure your haste or your
silence without a murmur. One is not always in the bumour to write,
and one always writes as much as the humour prompts.
</p><p>
I am here sentinel over the interest of Le Guen, and cannot leave the
post until the final decision be had, of which, at present, I form no
conjecture as to the period; but I entertain no doubt of Le Guen's
eventual success.
</p><p>
Among the letters forwarded by you is one recommending to me in very
high terms a Mr. Irving, or Irwin,  from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>; pray inquire who
he is, and where to be found, and be able to inform me, on my return,

Mr. Eacker has offered his services to take a letter. You see that I

This will be handed you by Mr. Brown,  secretary to General
Hamilton. By the two preceding mails I had nothing from you; by that
of this day I am again disappointed. I do indeed receive a very
pleasant little letter, but I expected a volume. Would it be an
intolerable labour, if, precisely at half past nine o'clock every
evening, you should say, "I will now devote an hour to papa?" Or even
half an hour. Your last letter, though not illy written, has evident
marks of haste.
</p><p>
I agree entirely with your eulogium on our amiable friend; but one
point you overlook. Her heart is as cold as marble, And you mistake
the effusions of politeness, mingled with respect, for symptoms of
tender emotions.

The argument of the cause of Le Guen is concluded. I fear that I must

I had taken my passage for this day, and anticipated the pleasure of
dining with you on Saturday. But--but--these buts--how they mar all
the fine theories of life! But our friend Thomas Morris  has
entreated in such terms that I would devote this day and night to
certain subjects of the utmost moment to him, that I could not,
without the appearance of unkindness, refuse. He would, I know, at any
time, devote a week or month, on like occasion, to serve me. How,
then, could I refuse him one day? I could not.
</p><p>
But, again, more buts. 'But' after I had consented to give him a day,
I sent to take passage for to-morrow, and lo! the stage is taken by
the sheriff to transport criminals to the state prison. I should not
be much gratified with this kind of association on the road, and thus
I apprehend that my journey will be (must be) postponed until Friday,
and my engagement to dine with you until Monday.

Your little letter from Alexandria assured me of your safety, and for

I am to be detained here yet a week. Immediately on my return to

I.B. Prevost has been hurrying off Senat and Natalie; but for his
interposition they would have relied wholly on me, and I had already
proposed that they should go with the chancellor some time in the
summer or autumn, which would have been then or never, as I had
pleased; but he (I.B.P.) has advised otherwise, and strongly urged
their immediate departure. I think I shall be able to prevent it.

Would <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> be willing to go as secretary to Chancellor

Your Dumfries letter was received yesterday. To pass a day in Dumfries
is what you could not at any time very much desire; but to pass one
there against your will, and a rainy day too, was indeed enough to try

On Sunday, the 15th, I commence my journey to New York; there I shall

Hymen.

It gives me very great pleasure to hear that Colonel W. Hampton is
become, in some sort, your neighbour, by having purchased a plantation
within fifteen or twenty miles (as is said) of Georgetown. Write me if
this be so.
</p><p>
I have written to Frederick  as you commanded; that I might not err
in expressing your ideas, I enclosed to him your letter. You have no
warmer friend on earth; no one who would so readily hazard his life to
serve you. It always seemed to me that you did not know his value.

On Wednesday, the 18th, I left the great city. At the Susquehannah the
wind was rude; the river, swollen by recent rains, was rapid. The
ferrymen pronounced it to be impossible to pass with horses, and
unsafe to attempt it. By the logic of money and brandy I persuaded
them to attempt it. We embarked; the wind was, indeed, too mighty for
us, and we drove on the rocks; but the boat did not bilge or fill, as
in all reason it ought to have done. I left Alexis and Harry to work
out their way; got my precious carcass transported in a skiff, and
went on in a stage to pass a day with "thee and thou." I was received
by the father with parental affection--but of "thee." How charming,
how enviable is this equanimity, if real. There is one invaluable
attainment in the education of this sect; one which you and I never
thought of: it is 'tacere'." How particularly desirable this in a
wife.
</p><p>
At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I saw many--many, who inquired after you with great
interest-- 'sans doubte'. Among others I saw B., lovely and
interesting; but adieu to that. It cannot, must not, will not be; and
the next time I meet B., which will be in a few days, I will frankly
say so.
</p><p>
I approached home as I would approach the sepulchre of all my friends.
Dreary, solitary, comfortless. It was no longer 'home'. Natalie and ma
bonne amie have been with me most of the time since my return (about
twenty-four hours past). My letters from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> broke up that
cursed plan of J. B. P.; they do not go in the parliamentaire; they do
not know when they go; and, in short, they rely wholly on me, so that
thing is all right.
</p><p>
The elegant and accomplished Mrs. Edward Livingston died about ten
days ago. Mrs. Allen is in town; she is in better health than for
years past. As to my dear self, I am preparing with all imaginable
zeal for a voyage to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,. One obstacle interposes; that you can
conjecture. That removed, and I shall be off in forty-eight hours. I
hope to be at sea by the 20th of April; but, alas! perhaps not. In
eight days you shall know more of this.
</p><p>
Your letters have been received as far as Halifax. We conclude that
you got home on the 16th. It has been snowing here this whole day most
vehemently. You are blessed with "gentler skies." May all other
blessings unite.

Your letters of the 24th and 25th March, received yesterday, give me
the first advice of your safe arrival at Clifton. The cordial and
affectionate reception which you have met consoles me, as far as any
thing can console me, for your absence.
</p><p>
My last will have advised you of the alteration in the plans of
Natalie. Of all this she will write you; but I must say a word of my
own plans. The ship South Carolina is now in port, and will sail on
Monday next. I wish to take passage in her; but a thousand concerns of
business and obstacles of various kinds appear to oppose. I shall
combat them all with the zeal which my ardent wishes for the voyage
inspire; yet I dare hardly hope to succeed. You shall hear again by

Your female friends here complain of your silence; particularly Miss
C., and, I am sure, 'elle a raison'.

Our election commences to-morrow, and will be open for three days. The
republican members of assembly for this city will be carried by a
greater majority than last year, unless some fraud be practised at the
polls. The corporation have bad the indecent hardiness to appoint
known and warm federalists (and no others) to be inspectors of the
election in every ward. Hamilton works day and night with the most
intemperate and outrageous zeal, but I think wholly without effect.
</p><p>
If any reliance may be placed on our information from the country,
Clinton will be elected by a large majority. The best evidence of
dispassionate opinion on this subject is, that bets are two to one in
his favour, and that the friends of Van Rensellaer wager with
reluctance with such odds.

This morning will sail the brig Echo, the only vessel in harbour
destined for South Carolina. I do not go in her. With unspeakable
regret, therefore, the projected visit is abandoned--wholly and
absolutely abandoned. The pain of my own disappointment leaves me no
room for any sympathy with yours. There is one insurmountable
obstacle, which I leave you to conjecture. If that were removed, it

consistently with his views of business, leave the state for five or
six months, as you have proposed, for your Northern tour?
</p><p>
Of the voyage to France I have written to you both about a fortnight
ago. I heartily applaud your judgment, and the motives which have
influenced it. You may by-and-by go in a manner much more
satisfactory.
</p><p>
How very oddly your letters travel. That of the 30th March arrived on
the 15th, instant; and yesterday, those of the 6th and 13th by the
_same' mail. To solve this phenomenon, I am led to believe that they
have moved with a velocity proportioned to the spirit which was
infused in them by the writer. Thus, the first crawled with a torpor
corresponding with its character. It reminded me of the letter of a
French lady, which I have shown you as a model of elegance. 'Mon cher
mari, je vous ecris parceque je n'ai rien a faire: je finis parceque
je n'az rien a dire'." This was, indeed, the substance of yours; but,
being spread over a whole page, the laconic beauty was lost, and the
inanity only remained. The second, a grave, decent performance,
marched with becoming gravity, and performed the Journey in
two-and-twenty days; but the third, replete with sprightliness and
beauty, burst from the thraldom of dulness, and made a transit
unparalleled in the history of the country.
</p><p>
You will find in this theory some incentive to the exertion of genius;
and I entertain no doubt but that, ere long, your letters will be sped
with the rapidity of a ray of light.
</p><p>
We have laughed at your horse negro, and have been very much amused by
the other charming little details. Thus letters should be written.
</p><p>
By this vessel I send two dozen pairs of long coloured kid gloves, and
half a dozen pretty little short ones, 'pour monter a cheval.' They
are directed to your husband. I wish you would often give me orders,
that I may have the pleasure of doing something for you or your
amiable family.
</p><p>
I had like to have forgotten to say a word in reply to your inquiries
of matrimony, which would seem to indicate that I have no plan on the
subject. Such is the fact. You are or were my projector in this line.
If perchance I should have one, it will be executed before you will
hear of the design. Yet I ought not to conceal that I have had a most
amiable overture from a lady "who is always employed in something
useful." She was, you know, a few months past, engaged to another;
that other is suspended, if not quite dismissed. If I should meet her,
and she should challenge me, I should probably strike at once. She is
not of that cast, yet a preference to rank only is not very flattering
to vanity; a remark which may remind you of 'Le moi.'

But, for a reason much more weighty, you must hasten-- 'il faut'. I

it after you. Yet I dare not trust to such hazards the letters which I
have received for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> and you, I persevere, therefore, in the
determination to retain them.
</p><p>
I was so very solicitous that you should see Niagara, that I was
constantly filled with apprehension lest something might prevent it.
Your letter of the 29th of July relieves me. You had actually seen it.
Your determination to visit Brandt gives me great pleasure,
particularly as I have lately received a very friendly letter from
him, in which he recapitulates your hospitality to him in 'ancient
days', and makes very kind inquiries respecting you; all this before
he could have entertained the remotest idea of seeing you in his own
kingdom.

Natalie and M. Senat have been for some weeks past at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=trenton" rel="city">Trenton</a> ; they
are now on their return, and will be here to-morrow. Vanderlyn, of
whom I said something in my last, will immediately set about her
picture. They (Natalie and Senat) are to go with the chancellor about
the last of September.

Wheeler will be here in a few days. Hampton is actually married to a

Mr. Vanderlyn, the young painter from Esopus, who went about six years
ago to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, has recently returned, having improved his time and
talents in a manner that does very great honour to himself, his
friends, and his country; proposing to return to France in the spring,
he wishes to take with him some American views, and for this purpose
be is now on his way through your Country to Niagara. I beg your
advice and protection. He is a perfect stranger to the roads, the
country, and the customs of the people, and, in short, knows nothing
but what immediately concerns painting. From some samples which he has
left here, he is pronounced to be the first painter that now is or
ever has been in America. Your affectionate friend,

</p><p>
On the road I passed half an hour with Mrs. L., late Mary A. She
appeared most sincerely glad to see me. She is still beautiful;
something ennuyed with the monotony of a country life; talked of you
with the warmest affection. It is really a fraud on society to keep
that woman perpetually buried in woods and solitude.
</p><p>
I am extremely solicitous to know how you get on. Pray make easy

It is very kind indeed to write me so often. Your last is from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a>. "Like gods," forsooth; why, you travel like--; that,
however, was a very pretty allusion. I have repeated it a dozen times
and more. Your other letters also contain now and then a spark of
Promethean fire: a 'spark', mind ye; don't be vain.

And so--has returned 'sans femme'; just now arrived. He saw you and
spoke to you, which rendered him doubly welcome to A. B.
</p><p>
You made two, perhaps more conquests on your Northern tour--King
Brandt and the stage-driver; both of whom have been profuse in their
eulogies. Brandt has written me two letters on the subject. It would
have been quite in style if he had scalped your husband and made you
Queen of the Mohawks.
</p><p>
Bartow, &c., are well. Mrs. Allen better. Mrs. Brockbolst Livingston
dead. Mrs. Van Ness has this day a son. Thus, you see, the rotation is
preserved, and the balance kept up.
</p><p>
There are no swaar apples this year; some others you shall have, anda set of cheap chimney ornaments." I have not asked the price, but
not exceeding 'eight hundred dollars!' Did you take away "The man of
Nature?" I proposed to have sent that with some others to L. N., but
you have thus marred the project.
</p><p>
Since I began this letter I am summoned to leave town two hours before
daylight to-morrow morning, to return next day, when I shall know
definitely the result of the sale, which, indeed, is the object of the
journey. On my return I passed a day with M. A. Monsieur is cold,
formal, monotonous, repulsive. Gods! what a mansion is that bosom for
the sensitive heart of poor M. Lovely victim! I wish she would break
her pretty little neck. Yet, on second thought, would it not be better
that he break his? 'He' is often absent days and weeks. 'She' has not
seen the smoke of a city in five years; but this is dull. I had
something more cheerful to say; this, however, came first, and would
have place. And here am I, at midnight, talking such stuff to
bagatelle, and twenty unanswered letters of 'vast importance' before
me! Get to bed, you hussy.

This letter was nicely sealed up and laid on my table; late last night
I returned from the country, and found the letter just where I left
it. Very surprising! This was so like my dear self, that I laughed and
opened it, to add that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill will probably be sold within ten
days for 'one hundred and forty thousand dollars', which, though not

This fine day brings me your two letters from Raleigh and
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, 28th and 30th of October. It is quite consoling to find
that you will have taken the precaution to inquire the state of health
before you venture your precious carcass into <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,. A fever
would certainly mistake you for strangers, and snap at two such plump,
ruddy animals as you were when you left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.
</p><p>
You shall have apples, and nuts, and a cook, and 'lucerne' seed. As to
_femme de chambre', I cannot speak with certainty. I have put in
motion the whole French republic on the occasion. Mrs. Kemble's friend
cannot be found. Most probably Madame S. has tortured into Gamble some
name which has not a letter of Kemble or Gamble in it.
</p><p>
Natalie sailed the Thursday after you left town, and she is probably
_now' in Havre with her mother. A letter received from Madame d'Lage
 since Natalie sailed, advises us that she is there waiting for
her, which is indeed most fortunate, and relieves me from a small
portion of the anxiety which I suffer for that charming girl. Yet,
alas! there is room for too much. I expect to see her here within a
year.
</p><p>
Anna wonders you do not write to her. It never occurred to her that
she had not written to you: so she is now occupied, and you may soon
expect at least twenty pages from her indefatigable pen. I am going to
see Board. There is an ancient story of a man who once gave life and
spirit to marble (you may read it in the form of a drama in Rousseau).
Why may not this be done again? The sale of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill goes on, and
will, I believe, be completed within eight days. The price and the
terms are agreed; some little under works retard the conclusion.

I send the enclosed newspaper merely on account of the proceedings of
the Rhode Island legislature. They are on the second page. That, in
New-England, men should be found hardy enough to oppose, in public
speeches, the recommendation of a thanksgiving sanctioned by the usage
of one hundred and fifty years; that this opposition should prevail,
and the recommendation be rejected by a large majority of a House of
Assembly, are events the most extraordinary which the present
generation hath beheld.
</p><p>
It has been announced in your gazettes that I am to visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,
this month. Nothing is more true than that my warmest wishes have
urged me to verify this expectation; but it is equally certain that I
shall do no such thing. When I expressed the hope of seeing your state
previously to the session of Congress, I did not know that I was
chosen a member of the Convention by the county of Orange, much less
could I foresee that I should be president of that Convention; and no
individual suspected that fifteen days would have been consumed in
accomplishing the business of six hours. These circumstances ought to
redeem my character, in this instance, at least, from the charge of
versatility or caprice, Vale.

exchange. That whom I shall send you is a good, steady-looking animal,
_agée vingt trois'. From appearance, she has been used to count her
beads and work hard, and never thought of love or finery. The enclosed
recommendation of Madame Dupont, the elder, will tell you more. You
are in equal luck with a cook. I have had him on trial a fortnight,
and he is the best I ever had in the house; for cakes, pastry, and
jimcracks, far superior to Anthony. In short, he is too good for you,
and I have a great mind not to send him; you will be for ever giving
good dinners. He has something of the manner and phisiognomy of Wood,
your teacher. 'M'lle la femme de chambre and Monsieur le Cuisinier_

Your letter of the 7th of November, from 'Yaahanee', is received at
this place. Though I am in the house with Mr. and Mrs. Lowndes, and
several other Carolinians, yet we are wholly ignorant of your
position. No one ever heard of Yaahanee. I suspect it to be some
Mohawk word, which T. B. A. has been pleased to retain and apply--a
very pretty name, I acknowledge. Your reception has, indeed, been
charming; it reads more like an extract from some romance than matter
of fact happening in the nineteenth century within the United States.
I will ride fifty miles out of my way to see that lady.
</p><p>
The great business, as you are pleased to call it, has brought me
hither. Not merely to see the statue, nor have I yet seen it; but am

Your interesting letter of the 23d is this day received. It brings me

to your fireside more than any thing you have written. Mrs. Allen is
here. Anna will, to all appearance, be married before spring to a
merchant of the name of Pierpont. Catharine is astonished that she has
not yet an answer to her letter. I have told her that she can by no
possibility have one before Christmas. In your reading, I wish you
would learn to read newspapers; not to become a partisan in politics,
God forbid, but they contain the occurrences of the day, and furnish
the standing topics of conversation. The reading of newspapers is a
knack which you will acquire in six weeks, by reading, during that
time, every thing. With the aid of a gazetteer and atlas, you must

Herewith is enclosed a duplicate of the bill of lading, specifying the
articles shipped for you on board the Protectress--She sailed this
afternoon. The president's message, of which a copy was sent you by
this ship, will have reached you through other channels long before
her arrival.
</p><p>
One idea contained in this message is much applauded by our ladies.
They unite in the opinion that the "energies of the men ought to be
principally employed in the multiplication of the human race," and in
this they promise an ardent and active co-operation. Thus, then, is
established the point of universal coincidence in political opinion,
and thus is verified the prophetic dictum, "we are all republicans, we
are all federalists." I hope the fair of your state will equally
testify their applause of this sentiment; and I enjoin it on you to
manifest your patriotism and your attachment to the administration byexerting your energies" in the manner indicated.

Your letter of the 20th December (the venison letter) is still the

January, of which I am a little jealous. It is quite unlucky that you
have been out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, when your things arrived. How cook and

meek and humble we are grown. You really expect to do the honours of

neglect it. I do entreat you to get a very stout pair of over shoes,
or short boots, to draw on over your shoes. But shoes to come up to
the ankle bone, with one button to keep them on, will be best; thick
enough, however, to turn water. The weather has not yet required this
precaution, but very soon it will, and I pray you to write me that you
are so provided: without them you will not, cannot walk, and without
exercise you will suffer in the month of May. To be at ease on this
subject, you must learn to walk without your husband--alone--or, if
you must be in form, with ten negroes at your heels. Your husband will
often be occupied at the hours you would desire to walk, and you must
not 'gener' him: oh, never. Adieu.

Senate for the repeal of the act of last session establishing a new
judiciary system; and that the bill, when on its third reading, was,
by the casting vote of the vice-president, referred to a select
committee. This day notice has been given that a motion to discharge
that committee will be made to-morrow. It should be noted that the
arrival of Mr. Bradley has given a vote to the republican side; hence
it may be presumed that the committee will be discharged, and that the
bill will pass the Senate to-morrow, and that in the course of three
weeks it will become a law. I state this, however, as mere conjecture.
</p><p>
The constitutional right and power of abolishing one judiciary system
and establishing another cannot be doubted. The 'power' thus to
deprive judges of their offices and salaries must also be admitted;
but whether it would be 'constitutionally moral', if I may use the
expression, and, if so, whether it would be 'politic' and expedient,
are questions on which I could wish to be further advised. Your
opinion on these points would be particularly acceptable.

Still silent. Yet is 20th December the latest date which I have
received from you; hence I infer that you have remained at Georgetown
much longer than was intended. Five weeks without hearing from you!
Intolerable. Now I think to repose myself in sullen silence for five
weeks from this date. I know that the apples and nuts will bring you
out again. Thus children are moved; but I also thought that a pretty
little letter, even without bonbons, would have done the same. I have
a very beautiful elegy on a lady whom you love better than any one in
the world; even better, I suspect, than L. N., and I was about to send
it, but I won't till I hear from you: a nice, handsome letter; none of
your little white ink scrawls. They talk of adjourning. No; I won't
tell you that either. I have nothing to say of myself, nor any thing
to ask of you which has not been often asked. Tell me that Mari is
happy, and I shall know that you are so. Adieu, my dear little
negligent baggage. Yes; one question. Do you leave your cards T. B. A.
or Joseph A.? What are L. N.'s? And one injunction repeated. Do not
suffer a tooth to be drawn, or any operation to be performed on your
teeth.

Your letter of the 10th of January was the first evidence of your
existence which I had received for near a month preceding. I hope your
wife is allowed the use of pen, ink, and paper. Her letter, three days
later, has been also received. The successful "execution of your
energies" is highly grateful to me. It 'seems probable' that I shall
pronounce, in person, on the merit of the workmanship somewhere about
May day.
</p><p>
The repeal of the judicial system of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1801">1801</a> engrosses the attention of
both houses of Congress. The bill is yet before the Senate. You may
have observed that some days ago it was referred to a special
committee by the casting vote of the vice-president. Bradley having
arrived two days ago, and the republicans having thus an additional
vote, the committee was this day discharged, and it is highly probable
that the bill will pass the Senate to-morrow. On this subject I
hesitate, though it is not probable that my vote will be required. Of
the constitutionality of repealing the law I have no doubt, but the
equity and expediency of depriving the twenty-six judges of office and
pay is not quite so obvious. Read the Constitution, and, having
informed yourself of the out-door talk, write me how you view the
thing.
</p><p>
It has for months past been asserted that Spain has ceded Louisiana
and the Floridas to France; and it may, I believe, be assumed as a
fact. How do you account for the apathy of the public on this subject?
To me the arrangement appears to be pregnant with evil to the United
States. I wish you to think of it, and endeavour to excite attention
to it through the newspapers. If you publish any thing, send me the
papers which may contain it.

Truxton is going out to the Mediterranean with three large and one
small frigate. Apprehensions are entertained that our good ally,
George III, does secretly instigate and aid the Barbary powers. We do
not know that Tunis has declared war, but such an event will not
surprise me.
</p><p>
I have not heard a syllable of any changes made or to be made in
offices in your state, and, for reasons well known to you, I shall
neither make an inquiry nor offer advice. C. Pinckney's nomination was
confirmed by one vote. All the other nominations have been confirmed,
mostly without opposition.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> writes me that the mountain plan is wholly abandoned for
Sullivan's Island. I do not, however, as yet abandon it; and, if I can
get hence early in April, I think of going direct to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, there
to establish myself till you shall both condescend to visit me.
</p><p>
When you shall be both settled in your own house, I crave a history of

not like imitation, in your own manner. Vale.

I have just received a pretty little letter from C. C., all on nice,
pretty figured paper, such as you love, and she talks a great deal
about you; the substance of it is, that you are an ugly, little, lazy,
stupid, good-for-nothing knurle, and that she is very sorry she ever
wrote you a line. I can't vouch for the very words, but I think this
is a fair abridgment of that part of her letter which concerns T. B.
A. I wish you would teach half a dozen of your negroes to write; then
you might lay on the sofa, and, if you could submit to the labour of
thinking and dictating, the thing would go on.
</p><p>
We make a pleasant society here, so that one may get through the
winter without ennui. I live at Mr. Law's, not nominally, but in fact.
Mrs. Madison is distant one mile. Anna Payne  is a great belle.
Miss Nicholson  ditto, but more retired; frequently, however, at
Mrs. Law's. But pray, miss (madam), as to busts and statues, all the
B.'s being out of the question, is there nothing in this line to be
found in South Carolina? I suppose it never came into your head to
think or inquire. Pray shake your little noddle, to give the brains,
if any there be, a little action; but who can do two things at once?
That's true. I forgive thee all thy sins, without any further penance
than that which you have imposed on yourself. But write C. and poor
little Anna, to congratulate her. Tell her what a fine fellow I learn
her husband is. Mrs. Anna Constable Pierpont.

We have a perpetual summer here. I am weary of it, though, in truth, I
care nothing about it. With you it must be burning hot.

forty South Carolina Africans, he is very reasonable if he asks only

</p><p>
Your letter of the 31st, accompanied by a note dated 1st February,
came by the mail of yesterday. A few lines from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, received
some days before, advised me of your journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=clifton" rel="city">Clifton</a>,  and of the
distressing occasion. My heart sinks within me when I think of that
lovely and disconsolate woman. Your conduct was worthy of you and of
my daughter. She must be restored to reason and to life, by being
convinced that she has some motive for enduring existence. If no other
can be shown, at least she can be persuaded that she is necessary to
you. But I learn from your letter, though you say nothing of it, that
although she feels with anguish, yet she will not sink into
despondency. This testifies a mind of that dignity and firmness which
you had taught me to expect.
</p><p>
Nothing could have been more fortunate than the revival of the
project. It will divert the attention and summon up the spirits. You
must not condemn; it would be better to cherish it. Enter into all the
details. Transport yourselves to Europe, and there take a nearer view
and more accurate estimate of the dangers and advantages. Let those
who oppose it offer something in lieu. What! is she to wear out her
youth and beauty, dissipate her talents, and exhaust her spirits
without an object in life or a place in society? Without enjoyment,
without distinction? These hints will make you think I may hereafter
say more.
</p><p>
My life has no variety, and, of course, no incident. To my feelings
your letters are the most important occurrence. I am blessed with
three of them in three months. It did not use to be so. It would be no
excessive encroachment on your precious time to give me an hour twice
a week the evening preceding the post days. This I shall expect; 'and
then', and after one more communication, to be presently mentioned, I
will write definitely as to my spring projects.
</p><p>
It is of sculpture: a hint in your last indicates that you have
something in view. Be pleased to give me name and description, in some
mystical, sybillistical way, which, in case of robbery of mail, will
not disclose too much. One letter may contain the name, and another
the comment-- '"Car ou l'arreter?_" is rather too mystical. I can make
nothing of it, having studied it a full hour to no purpose.
</p><p>
I entreat that you will always enclose your letter in a blank sheet,
on which is to be the seal and superscription. Health and blessings.

On the 4th day of March next I propose to write you of certain matters
and things of high import, heretofore touched, but not elucidated to
the entire satisfaction of all the parties concerned, if, in the mean
time, you shall be of good behaviour.
</p><p>
This, however, was not what I sat down to say, nor can I by any
possible means recollect what it was; but, in truth, I had something
to communicate or something to ask. I don't know which. That we have a
great snow storm and cold weather (now) will be no news to you, for
they will undoubtedly both be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, long before this letter.

I project, as you may have understood, a journey southward at some
time, yet nameless, during the current year (or century). Now, if my
evil stars or good ones should, against my will and my judgment, take
me through Norfolk, I am ruined and done; and there my journey will
most infallibly end. That I had better be hanged or drowned, you will
readily agree. The antidote or preventative is in your hands, or, if
you please, head. The bust, slightly referred to in the letter of the
1st of February, has occupied some of my waking and sleeping moments.
Be more particular, and especially the estimated value in dollars and
cents; also, in what year or era manufactured, and the character and
merit of the work, as it strikes your fancy, but with some minuteness.
You know my rage for sculpture has cost me some money and led me into
some bad bargains. Thank God, I have got rid of them 'all.' If you
will have 'Pet' or 'Peet, Peter, Peter Yates, Peter Alston, Petrus
Burr' (or by every other name he may be known) taught to write a good
hand, and make me a present of him, I will subscribe myself your very

Never were orders obeyed with more promptitude and effect. It is not
twelve hours since I desired (directed) you to write, and lo! a letter
dated the 9th of February. And even "enclosed in a blank sheet of
paper." A zealous manifestation of reciprocity is due to such
respectful attention, and thus, in obedience to the high commands of
T. B. A., I do most sincerely and devoutly execrate all the postboys
and the legislatures of the two most noble states the Carolinas.
</p><p>
You women: it is so with you all. If one wishes to exhibit the best
side, one must provoke you. Gratify your wishes and expectations, or,
still worse, anticipate them, and it produces a lethargy. How have I
laboured for three months, working and writing to please a certain
lady: nothing comes but inanity and torpor. I provoke her, and behold
the effusions of spirit and genius. Be assured that I shall not
speedily relapse into the same error. Indeed, I knew all this before;
but I thought it was only one's mistress that was to be thus
managed--it is sex.

For certain reasons of state, neither the name nor the epitaph can yet
be given ; nor can it now be said precisely when. The verses are
allowed to be very beautiful. Those on the anniversary of the wedding
were received (this day) in the presence of two poets and a poetess,
who said handsome things of them. The 'ess' being a maiden of
thirty-five, drew a deep sigh.
</p><p>
Indeed, it is impossible to say, for I never before heard of such a
thing as that any public body should "ajourn." They do commonly
adjourn; and if, perchance, this should be what you mean, and you
shall write me so, I will do my best to give you a categorical answer.

The arrival of your letter of the 14th justifies me in noticing you by
this mail. Your newspapers of the same date, and also of the 15th,
contain particulars of the races; but so technically expressed that I
comprehend nothing of it. Your story is quite intelligible as far
forth as it is legible. I am very glad that Papa Alston has won once.
It is, I am told, the first time in his life. Where is Hampton all
this while, that you say nothing of him? Already I have told you that
on the 4th of March I shall say something of the adjournment, if, in
the mean time, you behave well. I shall not go first to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. Send
back your chairs. General Smith's carriage has just ran away with four
ladies, viz.: Mrs. Smith, Miss Speare, Miss Smith, and Mrs. Law. Miss
Smith was taken up dead, and brought home dead. After twenty-five
minutes she began to show signs of life. In two hours she began to
know those about her, and now (three hours) she is perfectly well; and
having been stripped and thoroughly examined, it cannot be discovered
that she has received the slightest injury, save being frightened to
death, as before mentioned. Miss Speare came off unhurt. Mrs. Smith
and Mrs. Law are much bruised. You will, I hope, understand that the
horses ran off with the carriage, and not that the carriage, of its
own mere motion, ran off with the ladies. Adieu.

You have supposed it to be from malice that I have not written you of

said so, and I had like to have written it to you; but appearances did
not seem to justify the expectation of a short session. The business
is hardly commenced, and I see no prospect of an adjournment until
some time in May. This is a great embarrassment; and your project of
remaining on the coast is another. I could, with pleasure, have passed
the summer with you in the mountains; but the heat and dissipation of
Sullivan's Island is not so inviting. All this, however, is nothing to

go South the instant I can disengage myself from this place; which may
be a very few days before the close of the session. I shall be at
least twenty days on the road. I entreat you, however, not to excite
any expectation on the subject of my visit; not even to mention my
intentions, until we shall see how far it may be in my power to
execute them. The judiciary bill being out of the way, I am in hopes
we shall engage zealously in the despatch of business. Of this matter

From an accurate attention to the dates of your letters, I discover
that you write on Sunday only; that if, by accident or mental
indisposition, to which people in warm climates are liable, the
business should be put off for that day, it lays over to the next
Sunday, and so to a third or fourth, according to exigences, active or
passive. Your letter, dated the 22d, but, in fact, written on Sunday
the 21st, was received by the mail preceding the last, which brought
nothing. This letter is a confirmation of my theory of provocations,
which I have lately enlarged and more accurately defined, deducing it
from philosophical principles, and adapting it to different
_climates'. When this volume shall be ready for publication, I propose
to add, in an appendix, by way of illustration, a series of our

At the moment of closing your letter, this scrap of a newspaper 
caught my eye, and is sent for your amusement. It is aimed at Aaron
Burr, by whom, it is well known, the publication of the book  is
delayed or suppressed. The book consists of five hundred pages,
principally low scurrility and illy-told private anecdotes; with about
thirty pages of high eulogium on A. B. There may, for aught I know,
have been twenty other publications criminating the person by whom the
work has been suppressed. They are so utterly lost on me, that I never
should have seen even this, but that it came enclosed to me from a
friend in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, who is solicitous for 'my honour', &c.
</p><p>
You may judge of the purity and decency of the book when I mention
that some dozen of persons, by name, are charged with being bribed by
British gold, and there is a surmise that General Pinckney is not
reputed very 'honest'. Of all the federal men, General Hamilton alone
is treated with respect, even to flattery. My "solicitous friend" has
given me a curious fact, of which I was ignorant till the receipt of
his letter. Barlas, a Scotchman, the publisher of the book, is private
tutor to the children of General Hamilton. Adieu.

I learn, with a good deal of regret, that the mountain plan is
abandoned; at least, that no measures are taken or meditated for its
execution. I should cheerfully acquiesce in any reasons founded on
motives of economy, convenience, regard to law business, or personal
influence; but the solitary one assigned to me by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> is, that
you and she '"may be near papa and mamma"'. Of this, too, I
acknowledge the force; yet it might be considered that the mountain
residence was intended for certain months only, and that during the
residue (the greater part) of the year, papa and mamma might indulge
their fondness. I had seen, or fancied that I saw in this project the
assurance of health to yourself and wife, and sound constitutions to
your children; profit in the location; amusement and economy in the
residence, and an increase of your influence and connexions. How far
it might comport with professional engagements, if seriously pursued,
was not considered. One personal motive, I confess, might have
influenced my judgment; the pleasure I had promised to myself in
passing the summer with you, and in projecting little schemes of
improvement and occupation. It is, indeed, with some hesitation that I
shall visit your coast after the middle of May, and there is now no
prospect of an adjournment of Congress before that time. Nevertheless,
I shall come, though 'at your hazard', which, you know, would be a

objection, ought, in my mind, to be an additional and strong motive.
With her Northern constitution she will bring you some puny brat that
will never last the summer out; but, in your mountains, one might
expect to see it climb a precipice at three weeks old. Truly, I mean
to be serious, and beg to know whether you have, in fact, resolved,
and whether the resolution has, in good faith, been the result of
reflection or of inertness. You will pardon the surmise. I allow
something for the climate, much for the influence of example; and
then, considering the uncommon warmth of the winter! it must be
fatiguing even to talk of any thing requiring exertion.
</p><p>
The rapidity, however, with which your house has been furnished and
established ought to redeem your wife from any share in this reproach.
On the 22d of February I find her fully occupied in those concerns,
with hopes of accomplishing the object by the time of my arrival. She
was then, however, taking an eight days' repose, that she might renew
her labours with more vigour at the expiration of that time. But,
again, gravely I inquire where I am to find you about the middle or
last of May. I presume, in the place where this will find you.
Locomotion is labour.
</p><p>
I entreat your prompt attention to the enclosed memorandum, from my
good friend Mr. Law. He says that Chisholm has never informed him of
the disposition of the indents mentioned in his letter, of which the
enclosed is a copy. Pray inquire and advise me. The thing is of small
moment; but I should be gratified in the occasion to show an interest
in his concern, for I am daily overwhelmed by the multiplied
kindnesses of himself and wife.
</p><p>
The gazettes will tell you better, I suspect, than I can what is doing
in the House of Representatives. The sloth with which things move is a
daily source of vexation to me, as tending to protract the session. I
dine with the president about once a fortnight, and now and then meet
the ministers in the street. They are all very busy: quite men of
business. The Senate and the vice-president are content with each
other, and move on with courtesy.
</p><p>
Your Rutledge will be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, in the course of this month. I
hope you are on terms of civility with him, for I receive from him the
most marked politeness. He will tell you of many strange things. God
bless you ever.

Your letter of the 1st, postmarked the 3d, was received last evening.
I regret that L. N. did not come to town, believing that you only
could console her; that she would make you an intelligent companion;
and that you could restore the tone of her mind, without diminishing
the firmness of your own.
</p><p>
Papa's present was the most gallant and charming thing that could have
been imagined. By Mr. Rutledge, who goes to-morrow, I send this papa a
little token which has been some weeks waiting for an opportunity. Mr.
Rutledge will tell you how I do, and what I do, and, 'to an hour',
when Congress will adjourn. He sets off to-morrow, and will be in
Chilton about four days after this letter; of course, I do not write
by him.

It is probable that the box went with the ship which took your first

</p><p>
The story of P. is a fable. We are on the best terms, and he calls
very often to see me. The elegy may now be seen in the newspaper,
which, considering how nearly it touched you, I thought the best mode
of communication. Avoid sights. You say nothing of the progress of
housefurnishing and housekeeping.
</p><p>
Your last was sealed, as too often before, on the writing. If your

P. S. Somebody (I believe the Spectator) says that a postscript is
always the most important part of a lady's letter. This, then, will be
feminine.
</p><p>
I have had three letters from Natalie. All full of interest and
amusement. Her remarks are equal to those of Lady Mary W. Montague for
their truth and spirit, and far superior to any of our diplomatic
communications. She is to travel from Nantz to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> (about four
hundred and fifty miles) 'with her maid and postillion only_: an
enterprise which no woman in France under forty hath executed without
shipwreck during the last hundred years. Yet Natalie will do it
without injury and without suspicion. I have taught her to rely on
_herself', and 'I' rely on her pride.
</p><p>
I have said, and truly, that the story of P. is a fable. It may,
however, by remote concatenation, and with the aid of great fancy and
a little malice, have grown out of a trifling and ridiculous incident
which took place at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and which I am sure you have heard. P.
was laughed at, and has behaved better ever since. There are at least
twenty (my neighbour, Mrs. Law, says fifty) such anecdotes now
circulating in this vicinity, 'all equally unfounded'. Without any
appeal, therefore, you may contradict all such as are inconsistent not
only with truth, but with probability. A lady of rank and consequence,
who bad a great curiosity to see the vice-president, after several
plans and great trouble at length was gratified, and she declared that
be was the very ugliest man she had ever seen in her life. His bald
head, pale hatchet visage, and harsh countenance, certainly verify the
lady's conclusion.

The preceding was written the morning of yesterday. I folded, and

prevented my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, jaunt which was planned for this day. The hope
of an early adjournment recedes. In short, all is uncertainty. It will

</p><p>
MA CHERE ENFANTE,
</p><p>
Different accidents and interruptions prevented me from writing by the
two last mails; a very unusual omission, and thus happens what, I
believe, has never before occurred, that I have two of your letters
unanswered, those of the 19th and 22d, both affecting and interesting.
The last of them acknowledges the receipt of a letter from me dated
March 9th. Now, I did not write any letter under that date, it must be
a forgery. On the 8th and 12th I did write to you.
</p><p>
It is, I hope and believe, true that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill is competent to all
purposes; but nothing is done nor can be speedily done. The thing
constantly eludes a conclusion, and matters are, in fact, now as badly
circumstanced as one year ago. When I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, I arranged my
affairs of 'all kinds' for six months' absence, which would extend to
the middle of June, with the determination to go hence to South
Carolina, in which determination I persist; yet you know that 'a
single letter may take me in a contrary direction', and mar all my
plans of pleasure. This, and this only, produces the instability of my
resolutions, and the equivocal tenour of my letters on the subject of
the visit.
</p><p>
Nothing certain can be predicated of the adjournment; but I am quite
resolved not to remain here beyond the 25th, more probable that I may
leave it on the 19th. In either case, it will be vain to address a
letter to me at Washington after the receipt of this, as I shall not
be here to receive it. My route will be through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> and
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, and thence to Georgetown and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=clifton" rel="city">Clifton</a>, 
where I presume I shall find Papa Alston, Ellen, &c. You may address
me a line to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and another to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, merely to say how
you are, and who more are dead. Recollecting, when you write, that it
will be very uncertain whether they will reach me; still, on my
arrival at those places, I shall be quite out of humour if I find no
letter from you, and 'will stay a week' at each place in hopes of
receiving one.
</p><p>
I have ordered Vanderlyn to send you, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, both his and
Stuart's picture of A. Burr; and have told him to ship himself for the
port of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, on the 1st of May.
</p><p>
I have also desired that my beautiful little bust of Bonaparte be sent
to Mr. William Alston.
</p><p>
You may send a letter to meet me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=clifton" rel="city">Clifton</a>,  and two or three to each
place if you find my movements so retarded as to admit a probability
of their being received. Adieu.

Your letter of the 29th came by the last mail, exactly, as heretofore,
on the eighth day after the date of your last preceding. Whether it be
invariably Sunday or not, at least it is always octo-diurnal. Pray get
an eight-day clock, and then all family matters will move on in strict

</p><p>
The instability of all human concerns has been a theme of remark for
the last 4000 years. Lately, very lately, I wrote you of my
determination to leave this city on the 26th. I then thought so, as
you will readily believe; because, why should I deceive my dear little
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>? Now this thing is altered, for reasons too numerous and
mighty to be here enumerated; and, besides, you know our doctrine is
not to give reasons, but to let the facts speak for themselves. On
this occasion, however, even your hard heart would yield to the
motives which govern me. The plan, I say, is all altered. Instead of
leaving this fair region, as was gravely proposed, on the 26th of this
month, the present project is to part from all I here hold dear on the
20th (the 'twentieth_) inst., which piece of caprice I hope you will
pardon. If no letter intervenes before that day, Papa Alston may
expect to see me in some twelve or fifteen days thereafter. I shall
hope to find letters at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, &c. Adieu.

</p><p>
At the moment of my arrival on Friday evening I wrote you from Mr.
Kinlock's. The day following (May 1) I came here, and, being without
horses, sent on Sunday morning to engage the whole stage, which was to
go to-morrow, and, as I understand, reaches <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, in a day.
Unfortunately, the stage was full--not even a seat vacant for the
vice-president. I am, therefore, doomed to remain here one day longer,
and to be two days on the road. My horses not having arrived, Mr.
Alston will, on Wednesday morning, set out with me in his curricle. We
shall dine and stay the night of Wednesday at Mrs. Mott's, and on the
day following, Thursday evening, reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,.
</p><p>
I now send my man George (late Azor Le Guen, now George d'Grasse) to
Georgetown. If he can get a place in the stage, he goes on with my
baggage; if not, he sends this letter, with all affectionate good
wishes. William arrived here this afternoon, and tells us that you are
well, and your husband 'ill'. This is exactly wrong, unless he means
to take the whole trouble off your hands, as some good husbands have
heretofore done; so, at least, Darwin records. God bless thee, my dear

Your letter of the 19th of June, covering two for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, was
received this morning. She, with Lady Nisbett and your boy, sailed
yesterday for Red Hook (120 miles north) on a visit to Mrs. A., who
had solicited this attention in terms and under circumstances which
admitted of no refusal. The boy has grown surprisingly. The mother has
recovered her appetite and spirits. I shall go up to take care of them
in ten or fifteen days.
</p><p>
I desired your father to bring or send a barrel of rough rice (rice
unpounded). The young Scotchman of whom I spoke to him has already
invented a machine which I think will clean ten times as much as your
pounding machine with the same power; that is, ten times as fast. Send
the rice that we may try.
</p><p>
As to the publications of Cheetham and Wood, it is not worth while to
write any thing by way of comment or explanation. It will, in due
time, be known what they are, and what is Dewitt Clinton, their
colleague and instigator. These things will do no harm to me
personally. What effect they may have on the cause is a problem.

</p><p>
Your letter of the 22d of February, announcing your intended marriage,
is this minute received. Nothing could be more grateful to me than
your proposed connexion with Mr. Sumter. I know little of him
personally, but his reputation and standing in society fully justify
your choice, and I pray you to assure him that I shall most cordially
take him to my bosom as a son. With his father I have been long
acquainted, and always greatly respected him. We were fellow-soldiers
during our revolutionary war, in which he acted a most distinguished
part, though we were not then known to each other. We served together
some years in Congress, and laboured in the same party. These
circumstances never fail to generate attachments, and I am truly happy
in being more closely allied to him.
</p><p>
I perceive, and with pleasure, that I shall pass much of my time in
South Carolina, and shall divide it between you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>; but the
mountains are my favourite residence. Which is my favourite daughter I
have not yet been able to decide. We must not, however, abandon
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. I will have you both here, if possible, every year, and at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill you shall renew the recollection of the happy hours of
your childhood.
</p><p>
I have been long impatient, my dear Natalie, to write you on this
subject, but I waited for advice from yourself. I was mortified to
learn from common report 'only' an event so nearly interesting, and
which I had supposed you would have communicated to me the first. Your
letter, however, has been long in America, and has travelled nearly
two thousand miles in pursuit of me, having come in this morning from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,.
</p><p>
I arrived here on the 23d with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, her boy--a most lovely boy,

to embrace you. We had a most charming passage of seven days.
</p><p>
This is a great holyday. We are celebrating, with show and much noise,
the 4th of July. This may appear to you a little ridiculous when you
look at the date of this letter; but, 'madame', please to look at your
almanac, and you will see that yesterday was Sunday. I should not have
attempted to write to you amid so much bustle; but the good Mr.
Arcambal came in just as I received your letter, and informed me that
there was an immediate and safe opportunity to France, and I was
impatient to express to you and your husband my participation in your
joys, and hearty approbation of your union. God bless you, my dear

thousand times, that she is wrong; and that we are not like your
French democrats. Encore, adieu.

On Saturday (17th) Mr. and Mrs. Alston, Lady Nisbett, and Charlotte
took passage for Red Hook. The wind has been so favourable that they
undoubtedly arrived yesterday before dinner. Charlotte had three or
four fits of ague and fever, but had escaped two days before she
sailed, and was again in health.

You will herewith receive the second book. The malice and the motives
are in this so obvious, that it will tend to discredit the whole. The
charges which are of any moment will be shown to be mere fabrications.
But there seems at present to be no medium of communication. The
printers, called republican in this city (Denniston and Cheetham), are
devoted to the Clintons, one of them (Denniston) being nephew of the
governor, and, of course, cousin to Dewitt. Wood, after absconding for
some time, returned to this city, was put in jail, where he lay some
days and until taken out by 'Coleman'. You will shortly receive an

Your letter of the 18th is received. Mr. Williams had before shown me
the pamphlet, and had informed me that it had produced all the effect
that the writer could have wished, which is the best evidence of the
merit of the work. It is evidently a hasty performance, and
incorrectly printed, yet it displays ability as a writer, and
sentiments honourable to him as a man.
</p><p>
Wood's book has surprised us. We all expected a new series of abuse
against A.B. It should be entitled "The Confessions of John Wood, one
of the Conspirators lately associated with James Cheetham and Dewitt
Clinton against the vice-president." It shows pretty clearly the
motives and views of this clan.

postoffice, saying how you are, when you will move, &c. Leave with the
postmaster a written direction to forward to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, all letters for
Mrs. Joseph Alston. I recommend to you to go round by Stockbridge to
see Binney. She is there at the house of Mr. Bidwell. You will also
there see your old great-uncle Edwards. But this is left to your
discretion. If you go through Pittsfield, you should call and see H.
Van Schaack, for whom Dr. Brown has a letter of credence. Make your
journey perfectly at your ease; 'id est', with dignified leisure.
Write me at every post-town, for I shall have a deal of impatience and
anxiety about you and your little nonentity.
</p><p>
All your friends here are well except George's dog and one of his
South Carolina birds. We are all in the bustle of moving. Heighho! for
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill. What a pity you were not here, you do so love a bustle;
and then you, and the brat, and the maid, and thirty trunks would add
so charmingly to the confusion. Adieu.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, September 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1802">1802</a>.
</p><p>
The debility and loss of appetite which your wife has experienced
alarmed me; yet I was totally ignorant of the cause. I was first
informed of it by Dr. Bard, who came accidentally to this city about a
fortnight ago. He, with Hosack and Brown, all of whom I consulted,
joined with me in opinion that she ought immediately to wean her child
or provide a wet nurse. This she peremptorily refused, and the bare
proposition occasioned so many tears and so much distress that I
abandoned it. Within the last three days, however, she has such a loss
of appetite and prostration of strength, that she is satisfied of the
necessity of the measure for the sake of the child, if not for
herself; and I have this day sent off a man to the country to find a
suitable nurse. The complaint continued from the period of her
_confinement' during the whole time that she remained in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,.
</p><p>
It is most unfortunate that she left the Springs. While she was there,
either by means of the air or the water, or perhaps both, she had got
quite rid of the complaint, and there is no doubt but that, had she
remained there a fortnight longer, the cure would have been radical.
The ride to Hudson, only thirty miles, brought on a relapse; and, with
slight variations, the affliction was increased and her strength
diminished. Bard advised the Springs, and was quite angry that she
left them.
</p><p>
There is nothing in this disorder which immediately threatens life;
nor is it, at present, attended with pain; but if it should become
fixed upon her, of which there is danger unless speedily cured, it
will unfit her for every duty and every enjoyment in life. The
medicines, which under the direction of Bard she used at Lebanon, have
hitherto proved ineffectual since her return. I have written fully to
Eustis, and expect his answer within two or three days.
</p><p>
The present state of her health and strength will not, I think, admit
of an attempt to take her to either of the Springs, or I should not
hesitate to go off immediately with her. I have, however, strong and
well-grounded hopes that, when she shall have a nurse, and resume the
use of proper remedies, a cure will be effected.
</p><p>
I have thought that you ought to be informed of these facts, as well
to explain the varied accounts which you may have received of her
health, as to anticipate the vague or exaggerated relations which you
may receive through other channels.
</p><p>
Most affectionately yours,

</p><p>
In my letter of yesterday I said nothing of your son. He is well, and
growing as you could wish. If I can see without prejudice, there never
was a finer boy.
</p><p>
Of yourself I have a good deal to say; more than I can find time to
write, and some things which cannot be written. Except the little
practical knowledge which you may have gained by mingling with your
committee-men, &c., your summer and autumn have, I perceive, been
lost--lost, I mean, as to literary acquirements. From your companions,
I presume, little is to be gained save the pastime of a social hour.
Yet time goes on, and you have much to do.
</p><p>
To the execution of any project, however, health is a sine qua non.
Whether you can ever enjoy it in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or on Sullivan's Island
has become a problem in my mind. I was quite shocked with your wan
appearance when I first met you last spring. How different from that
which you took hence the fall preceding. With every advantage
attainable in your climate, you have scarcely been free from fever
during the season. This cannot fail to debilitate both mind and body.
If these hazards are to be annually encountered with similar effects,
and worse may be apprehended, it is a price far beyond the value of
any benefits which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, can offer. The 'mountains', a more
_Northern latitude', or the 'grave', must be your refuge. Pray think
of these things. If I should not go to South Carolina this fall, nor
you come hither, let us meet in Washington next winter. After the
rising of your legislature, you may find time for that journey. But I
should prefer to see you here immediately after your election, if
there be time for your return before the session of the legislature.
Your health must require this change. 'Here' you may freeze out all
your "miasmata" and surplus bile in ten days, and go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> with
nerves well strung and blood well purified.
</p><p>
My solicitude for your frequent appearance in courts is 'no way_
diminished. The applause which I heard bestowed upon you sunk into my
heart. I could distinguish that which you merited from the fulsome
eulogy which was uttered through politeness. Your talent for writing
is enviable, and, with cultivation, will be unrivalled (nothing
without cultivation, remember). No one wishes so ardently as I do, not
even you, that these advantages should be improved. But these
considerations are unimportant compared with those which regard your
health.
</p><p>
If you should leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, give special orders about your
letters, for I may write what I should wish no one but you to see.
Affectionately adieu.

The cold weather of the last ten days has had a happy effect on
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. She is so far restored that I can with confidence assure
you she will return in health. The boy, too, grows fat and rosy with
the frost. They have taken passage in the brig Enterprise, Captain
Tombs, the same with whom we came last June. She will have the control
of the cabin, and will be perfectly well accommodated. I regret she
will sail so soon (the 12th), as well because I cannot attend her as
that I could have wished her health and that of the boy to have been
still more confirmed. Yet I cannot any longer resist her impatience.
You must not delay your journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> in expectation of her
arrival. It is important that you be on the ground the first day, and
it is to be desired that you could be there two or three days before
the commencement of the session. If you should be gone, she projects
to follow you, of which I advise you, that you may leave your
directions. When you shall see her and son, you will not regret this
five months' separation. I rejoice that you are to meet Major Pinckney
on the floor of your assembly. 'The Citizen_" (Cheetham and
Denniston's), in publishing a list of members chosen in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, and
its vicinity, omitted your name; but took care to add, by way of
extract from a pretended letter, that the Alstons were of no
consideration or influence in South Carolina. There is no bound to the
malice of these people. The conspiracy was formed last winter at
Washington. A little reflection will indicate to you the description
of men, the motives, and the object of this combination.
</p><p>
Apologize for me to Ch. Marshall that I do not fulfil my engagement to
accompany him from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, to Washington. I hope you will bring him
with you.
</p><p>
Would Charles Lee accept the place of secretary of the Senate? It is
worth twenty-three hundred dollars per annum, and not laborious. The
secretary, you know, is chosen by the Senate. Otis, the present
incumbent, will probably decline. If you should think that Lee would
desire it, and the thing should appear to you proper, it should be
suggested to your senators. Of the legislative subjects mentioned in
one of your letters, I hope to find time to say a word on Sunday (7th
inst.). God bless you.

So you arrived on the 24th, after a passage of ten days; you and the
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, packet on the same day. All this I learned last night; not
from you. Vanderlyn and I drank a bottle of Champagne on the occasion.
</p><p>
Though this relieves me from the great anxiety under which I laboured,
still there are many details of your passage, your arrival, &c., on
which nothing but your letter can satisfy me. For some unknown reason,
the mail is now eighteen days on the road.
</p><p>
Vanderlyn has finished your picture in the most beautiful style

</p><p>
Your letter of the 26th November came yesterday, that of the 25th the
day preceding. You see, therefore, that twenty-one days had elapsed
from the time of your arrival to the receipt of your first letter.
This is not by way of reproach, for it is an unpleasant truth that,
for the last six or eight weeks, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, mail has been twenty
days on the way. Had it not been for the intelligence by water of your
safe arrival, we should have concluded that you and Kate  were now
dancing with Amphitrite. How jealous her majesty would have been at
the presence of two such rivals.
</p><p>
The day after you left us, though the weather was mild, not even a
frost, the leaves of the trees about the house began to fall, and in
three days they were as bare as in midwinter, though you may recollect
that you left them in perfect verdure. This, I am sure, was sympathy
and regret. I shall respect these trees for their sensibility. It was
in harmony with my feelings; for, truly, all was dreary.
</p><p>
Yes, I enter into all your little vexations; but while I write, and
long before, they probably have passed away, and are succeeded by new
ones. Kate will help you to laugh them off. Kiss her for me. Not a
word, not a line from your husband since the 30th of October. We
ought, nay, we must, every day add something to our experience, and
usually at some cost.
</p><p>
I expect to leave this in about a week. Henceforth, therefore, address
me at Washington. On my arrival there we will begin to talk of our
spring and summer plans. You did well, very well to give up the
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> project. I really wish you had given the pair of horses in
your own name. In all such cases, that which is most grateful to you
will be so to me. Butter shall be sent. The card plate must be
altered.
</p><p>
_Maybe' I may write you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,; not again from this city,
unless I should receive from you something very pretty. Vanderlyn
projects to visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, but I am sure he will not. He is run
down with applications for portraits, all of which, without
discrimination, he refuses. He is greatly occupied in finishing his
Niagara views, which, --indeed, will do him honour. They will be four
in number, and he thinks of having them engraved in France. You hear
the roaring of the cataract when you look at them. Kiss the dear
little boy. Adieu, ma belle.

Your last letter, and the only one received within a month, is dated
the 14th inst., and written, I suppose, at your plantation. It gives
me the satisfaction of knowing that you and your boy are well, and
nothing more. How long you are to remain there, where next to go, and
every thing leading to a knowledge of your occupations and intentions,
is omitted. One half of the letter is a complaint of my silence, and
the other half (nearly) an apology for yours, You know (or am I now to
tell you) that you and your concerns are the highest, the dearest
interest I have in this world; one in comparison with which all others
are insignificant.
</p><p>
Recollect, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, that in five weeks Congress will adjourn
(3d March); that I shall then go in some direction, but in what is yet
unsettled; that my movements will depend essentially on yours. Tell
me, therefore, where you are to pass the summer, when you are to leave
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, and all the details. If these matters should not yet be
settled, let it be forthwith done. If you are not to go northward, it
is not probable that I shall see you in some time, for I have thoughts
of going on a tour through the western country, which, if executed,
will consume the whole summer. I offer you and your family <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>
Hill for the season, and will meet you there in May or June, or when
you please. Perhaps would come to make the voyage with you, by land or
water. Sullivan's Island will not, I hope, be thought of. How is it
that I have not a line from 'Mari', in answer to several letters which
I wrote him from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,?
</p><p>
I entreat you to answer this letter distinctly, and in all its parts;
for there will not be time for another letter and reply before I shall
be off. My love to Kate. You do not say whether she grows handsome or
ugly, nor is it any matter which while on the plantation.
</p><p>
I can't conceive how you all stow yourselves in that little wreck of a
mansion. Please to write over, in some way, the erased part of your
letter. You must be very destitute of wit and contrivance. No essence
in Washington. I still prefer musk, but not to be had. One would think
you had suffered some injury from perfumes. Your message and
commission to Mrs. Madison will be delivered. My mode of life,
establishment, &c., are the same as last year, except that I bought a
chariot, having some hope of seeing you and your husband here. As I
shall not write again until I hear where you are, I may as well say
now all that occurs to me.
</p><p>
On my way through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I rode out to Lansdown, to see our
beautiful little K. and Mrs. L. They appear to love you with all their
hearts. K. especially talked of you with an interest which could not
be affected. The ladies find fault with her dress, her person, her
manners; in short, with every thing appertaining to her. Mrs. L. has
also her full share of the eulogium. K. is 'toujours belle'. At
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wilmington" rel="city">Wilmington</a>, I did not see friend S. She had gone to church. God bless

I am weary, and so must you be, of this story of Reubon and Celeste.
It is, however, closed, and you will, after this letter, hear no more
of it.
</p><p>
Reubon agreed to comport himself in the manner advised in my last.
Immediately after this determination, Celeste sent a servant to inform
him that she was in town! He called to see her; returned the offensive
letter, and told her that, as he understood that it was the manner and
not the substance of the letter which had induced her to recall it, it
would be quite unnecessary for her to take the trouble of writing
another. They talked of indifferent matters. Reubon, quite at ease,
played the man of the world, and, in my opinion, the man of sense.
Before they parted, her face was flushed like a full-blown rose. She
begged his permission to destroy the letter, which was certainly a
very useless request, considering that the letter was wholly in her
power. During the interview, Celeste, having no roses to occupy her
hands, twisted off two corners of a pocket-handkerchief.
</p><p>
This reference (the law business), of which I informed you something,
has become extremely troublesome and disagreeable. I am apprehensive
that it will detain me here nearly the whole of this week.

Binny looks remarkably well, and talks much about you. Dennis and

I received yesterday your first letter. Pray no more apologies about
your stupidity, &c., because on that subject I am perfectly informed.
Be pleased to recollect that your letters cannot be answered the day
they are received. We are now even. I wrote you on Friday.
</p><p>
I went this morning to see L. and Keene. The former, as usual, polite,
friendly, and cheerful. The latter something improved by a very slight
acquisition of embonpoint; so very slight, however, as not to be
obvious to common optics. They will pass their summer at their present
residence, and I have almost promised that you shall make them a
visit.
</p><p>
But I should have narrated in the order of events according to their
dates or in the order of the importance. Neither hath been observed,
which argues ill of my temper of mind for the principal pursuit. Cette
----- spoils me. From that intercourse I return faintly to the line of
duty. On Friday I saw the inamorata, and it happened as we had feared;
for really I did not know whom I had the honour to address; nor could
I, with certainty, discover during the interview, for I saw but one.
The appearance was pleasing. There was something pensive and
interesting. It exceeded my expectations. It was a visit of ceremony,
and passed off as such. This day I met the whole four at dinner. My
attentions were pointed, and met a cheerful return. There was more
sprightliness than before. Le pere leaves town to-morrow for eight
days, and I am now meditating whether to take the fatal step
to-morrow. I falter and hesitate, which you know is not the way. I
tremble at the success I desire. You will not know my determination

The plot thickens, and I do not find it possible to communicate
faithfully the details, without hazarding too much in case of loss of
the letter. Something, however, may be said.
</p><p>
I called at the house this morning; before I had asked for any one in
particular, the servant bid me in, and in a few minutes Inamorat sole
appeared. This looked like secret understanding or sympathy; perhaps,
however, it was only as head and representative of the family. She
looked well; but, unfortunately, a trifling carelessness in dress had
nearly concluded the farce. Recollecting, however, that they were
packing up for a temporary removal, to take place this very day, an
apology was obvious. Having made to myself the apology, I went
further, and found that there was politeness, 'at least', in receiving
me, and in so prompt an attendance under such circumstances. After ten
minutes le pere came in; conversation became general, and I took
leave.
</p><p>
Returning home, and pondering on the subject most profoundly for full
five minutes, I boldly took up my pen, and wrote le pere that I wished
a few minutes' conversation with him at his own house in the course of
the day. Within an hour he was at 'my room' to receive the
communication. Now paint to yourself a desperate miscreant on the
point of committing self-murder, trembling with anxiety, choking for
want of utterance, &c. Having formed the portrait to your own taste, I
must tell you that there was no such figure. The salutations, on
meeting, passed as usual. An expression or two of sensibility to the
courtesy which anticipated so promptly the intended visit, and then
some unembarrassed direct questions and monosyllabic answers. "Is
----- under any engagement?" 'None'. "Would it be agreeable to you
that ----- should make overtures?" &c. 'Certainly'. A very
complimentary thing, however, was said by le pere. It was agreed that
the suiter should make known his pretensions, he (le pere) declining
to intermeddle. 'End of the first act'.
</p><p>
I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your two letters, both
dated June 4. Evidently they cost you great labour.
</p><p>
June 7.
</p><p>
I left this open that I might acknowledge the receipt of one by this
morning's mail. I am gratified to have it in my power. The accident to
the harp has been very fortunate, inasmuch as it enabled you to make
out a long letter on the subject. However it may be broken, nothing is
so easy to be repaired. Kiss dear little 'bang'.

</p><p>
As you were informed yesterday, my 'Celeste' has gone with the family
(le pere excepted) to pass a fortnight six miles from town. I go
to-morrow morning to recommend myself; and that no time may be wasted,
and these six mile rides may not be too often repeated to no purpose,
I shall not go much round about the subject, but come pretty directly
to the point; of all which you will be duly informed.
</p><p>
Truly, if my head be as confused as my narrative, it will be of little
use to me in the negotiation. I should have begun by relating what
happened this morning. There are, however, two ways of telling a
story. One by beginning with the oldest event, and so travelling down
to the close of the tale, and this is the mode commonly used by
philosophers and historians. The other, is by commencing with the most
recent fact or earliest incident, which is the mode universally
practised by lovers, and, generally, by poets. I could even quote
Homer and Virgil as authorities in support of this latter method.
Further I may add, that this retro-progressive arrangement seems more
congenial with the temper and feelings of the fair sex. Thus, you see,
most ladies turn first to the last chapter of a novel or romance. In
defence of this practice I could dilate to the utmost extent of many
sheets; but, intending soon to publish an essay on the subject, I
leave for the present the residue to your reflections, and return to
the interview of this morning.
</p><p>
I was admitted without hesitation, and was presently joined by
Celeste, though I had not particularized any one as the object of my
visit. For some minutes she led the conversation, and did it with
grace and sprightliness, and with admirable good sense. I made several
attempts to divert it to other subjects--subjects which might have
nearer affinity, again, to others; unsuccessfully, however; yet,
whether I was foiled through art or accident, I could not discover. Be
assured she is much superior to l'ainée.
</p><p>
  "I would be wooed, and, not unsought, be won."
</p><p>
So I conjectured she thought, and she was right.

</p><p>
I told you the negotiation should not be long. It is
finished--concluded--for ever abandoned-- 'liber sum'. Celeste never
means to marry; "firmly resolved." I am very sorry to hear it, madam;
had promised myself great happiness, but cannot blame your
determination. "No, certainly, sir, you cannot; for I recollect to
have heard you express surprise that any woman would marry, &c., and
you gave such reasons, and with so much eloquence, as made an
indelible impression on my mind." Have you any commands to town,
madam? I wish you a good-morning. 'End of the second and last act'.
</p><p>
The interview was about an hour. Celeste was greatly agitated;
behaved, however, with great propriety. The parting was full of
courtesy, and there is reason to hope that there will be no hanging or
drowning.
</p><p>
I dined to-day chez Rush. The two elder daughters are in Canada. The
little Julia, now about ten, is growing up very lovely and 'tres
gentile'. Afterward called to see your friend, Mrs. Stewart, and her
beautiful daughter. She is really beautiful. To-morrow I dine chez la
Raz.
</p><p>
The law business goes on slowly; may be finished about Tuesday next,
after which I shall hasten to those who love me, when I shall
endeavour to rouse them from their lethargy, and give them a little
zest for life. Just now I recollect that I have no letter from you
this morning, at which I was confoundedly vexed. I stop, therefore,
and shall withhold even this for a day, by way of punishment. You will
say that you were not well, that you were engaged in company, that the
servant neglected to take the letter, or some such trite thing. All
nonsense. Bon soir.
</p><p>
Thursday morning.
</p><p>
Your letter of Tuesday, containing the history of the dinner, is
received this morning. Truly, I think that Mr. and Mrs. Moore and Clem
might, with any tolerable aid, have made the dinner gay. Mr. and Mrs.
Moore have both a great deal of wit, and are both well bred. Clem is
by no means deficient. It must, therefore, have been the fault of
yourself and husband. If the harp is not essentially injured, I would
not purchase a new one. Kiss little 'bang'.

Yesterday I dined chez la Raz; a very pleasant party. The farce of
eight days past had been forgotten, or recollected only as a dream.
</p><p>
Just as I sit down to write to you I receive a note from Celeste,
advising me that she is in town for a few hours, and will be happy to
see me. What in the name of love and matrimony can this mean? The
conclusion was definitive, and a mutual promise that neither would
ever renew the subject. I am all impatience, and I go to hear. You
shall know to-morrow.

If this should be received on Friday morning, in season to be answered

If Mr. Kane and his wife (late Miss Clarke) should be in town, pray

Recollect they have many claims to your civilities. His sister, Mrs.

overwhelmed us with good offices on a certain occasion at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, and

forgotten. Be prompt, therefore, and courteous.

It was kind to announce to me, by the earliest opportunity, your safe
arrival at Lebanon. Tell me more precisely the movements and
intentions of the family, as they will in some measure control mine. I
am negotiating for the possession of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill, by exchanging with
Colonel F. for my house in town. It will be interesting indeed to have
you and your boy at the house where you have been once so happy. We
will trace back our childish sports and our more grave amusements. In
the sale of this estate I reserve the house and a due portion of the
ground about it; yet a good price will tempt me to part with it.
</p><p>
Some obscure hints in one of your letters have saddened my heart. From
_son pere' I have merited neither suspicion nor reserve. Is it, then,
criminal that a person of mature age should converse on a subject most
highly interesting with the friend most likely informed? Yet did I not
even give advice; invariably and inflexibly I declared that I would
never interfere in the matter unless son pere concurred. Have you
forgotten the mad project of going to England? the anxiety and misery
it cost us for some days? I should have thanked the man who had thus
treated my child. Indeed, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, such things sink into my
soul. They seem to invade the very sanctuary of happiness. Had I any

I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, two days after you, that is, on Saturday, and had a
pretty little passage of forty-eight hours. We were, on board, a
British custom-house officer, a sensible, pleasant man, who played
chess with me; two ladies, rather pretty, who did not molest us,
_point exigentes', bien amiable; five little children, who neither
cried nor quarrelled the whole way! yet cheerful and playful.
</p><p>
Six days have I passed here very pleasantly. To-morrow I go, whither
is not determined. You may, however, address me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, which
will most probably be my destination.
</p><p>
All those you saw when you were last here inquire about you with great
civility and interest, and say pretty things of you. Don't be vain,
madam, for I take this to be a kind of flattery to me, or to be so
intended. Miss C. talks much of you, and L. N., and Miss A. Can you
imagine what are Miss C.'s occupations and arrangements? Never; so
I'll tell you. Why, she instructs two nieces and a nephew (things of
twelve or thirteen) in astronomy, natural philosophy, and principles
of botany! Her boudoir has globes, several mathematical instruments,
&c. All this I discovered by accident; for she denies it all most
strenuously, and with some pretty, unaffected embarrassment. Be
assured this is an amiable, sensible girl. I don't believe you know
her value: so I pray you to study her. She left town yesterday with
her mother for Lebanon. Mr. C. went on Friday to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. What care
you for all that?
</p><p>
Are you a good girl? Do you drink the waters, and bathe, and ride, and
walk? I hear Mrs. W. is handsomer than during her widowhood, of which
I am very glad. Mr. Russel left this on Thursday, intending to pass
through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ballston" rel="city">Ballston</a> on his way to Niagara. If he should come
into your vicinage, desire <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> to recollect him. His wife is
with him. I never saw her.
</p><p>
Tell me who you see, and what you do, and what are your plans. You had
best return by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Providence if you should have time. Can you
make little 'chose' drink the water? I dare say not. If I were there I
would force some down his little throat. God bless you all.

Your letter of the 20th of July was received from the postoffice on my
arrival last evening. There must be some anachronism in the date, for
you left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, on the 21st. I learn, however, that you arrived,
were well, and had danced. Lord, how I should have liked to see you

I made the journey from Providence by land in four days. Near town,
yesterday, P.M., I met Mr. and Mrs. Harper, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>,. They are to
breakfast with me this morning; so I must make haste, for it is now
eight o'clock. How bad I write to-day. With Mr. and Mrs. Harper was a
pretty-looking, black-eyed lass, whose name I did not hear. I hope she
is coming out to breakfast, for I like her. There was also that
Liverpool merchant, who used to hang on Butler so in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,. I
hope he won't come.
</p><p>
I wrote you from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Providence" rel="city">Providence</a>, on Monday last, all I had to say of it
and its inhabitants. I found the whole country, from Providence to
this place, greatly alarmed about the yellow fever, said to be in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and dreadful stories in circulation, as usual. There have
been some suspicious cases, and some decided instances of yellow
fever. Our practising physicians, however, our mayor and
police-officers deny its existence. There is no alarm in town. The
coffee-house is attended as usual. This length of intolerable heat
has, I fear, prepared an atmosphere for the kind reception, if not for
the generation of the fever. Now I hear the carriage. 'Bon jour'. Be a
good girl. Love to H. 'Twas nothing but a cart.
</p><p>
L. and her little bang are here (_chez nous_); how happy are you
mothers. She will descant on its beauties by the hour; will point them
out to you distinctly, lest they might escape notice. The hair, the
nose, the mouth, and, in short, every feature, limb, and muscle, is
admirable and is admired. To all which I agreed.
</p><p>
Jerome Bonaparte is not here; nor is it certain that he is on the
continent. The French consul, whom I met in the road, told me, with
_une maniere mysterieuse', that he had something to communicate on
that subject. Maybe he is come, maybe he isn't. I conjecture that he
is come or coming.
</p><p>
Here they come, in earnest. I see only one lady in the carriage; so
miss has not come; well, she may stay.

Your amiable letter of the 1st inst. has not yet come to hand, and
therefore cannot yet be acknowledged; perhaps it has not yet been
written.
</p><p>
Indeed, we are about to be scourged with the plague called yellow
fever. John Bard dead; but, to keep the account good, Billy B. has
twins (boys). Catharine Church Cruger (Mrs. Peter C.) has a son. But
of the deaths. We die reasonably fast. Six or eight new cases reported
yesterday. Of those who take the fever three fourths die. The
coffee-house was, nevertheless, pretty well attended. No appearances
of alarm until to-day. Several families have removed from the
neighbourhood of the Tontine Coffee-house, and five times the number
will remove to-morrow. Laight claimed <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>'s promise of
Montalto, and I have admitted his pretensions. He will take possession

Your letter from Chester was received in due time; that from
Washington came only yesterday, having lain there fourteen days before
it was put into the office. By this time you must have received all
those which I have written to you since your departure--not a single
one. This is the first time that I have put pen to paper at you; but I
have been too busy, selling. All is sold, and well sold; not all,
however. The house, outhouses, and some three or four acres remain.
Enough to keep up the appearance, and all the pleasant recollections
of your infantine days, and some of your matronly days also, are
reserved with interest. This weighty business, however, is completed,

Mr. M'Kinnon wrote me, last June, a letter, which I received a few
days ago, and with it came two shawls or cloaks (a kind of worked

cards, and ornamented message paper. Half his letter is to you and of
you. He begs you to accept one of the shawls, and to give Frances the
other. I executed his instructions by giving F. one. Surely it is not
worth while to send the other to the Oaks for the admiration of your
Africans. It is, in my opinion, beautiful; though, at first sight, I
thought so little of it that I was going to give it to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> or Nancy.

(Mr. Astor), for the account of Joseph Alston, Esq., the sum of 'one

parted I have been almost daily surprised by some pleasant occurrence
or discovery of a personal nature. I pray it may continue a little
longer; even till a bust is found and obtained.

Mrs. Law was vexed and mortified beyond measure at missing you. She
has bid me say more things than this sheet would hold. The Misses
Butler are all here. I shall see them to-morrow. Mary Allen, that was,
now Mrs. Livingston; that beautiful little Miss Gray, whom we saw in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a>; she became Mrs. Dobel, then a widow, and now Mrs. Payne.
</p><p>
At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, Mrs. Lenox and K. almost quarrelled with me for your
passing their gate without calling. They had made some preparation,
and, in good faith, desired your visit. Miss Boadley, too, talked of
you with great interest. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wilmington" rel="city">Wilmington</a>, I saw no one of your
acquaintance; nor at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, except Susan Smith, who is there on a
visit from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a>.
</p><p>
To go back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. All things are much as you left them, except
that what regards gamp is a good deal better. Mrs. Laight, and child,
and sisters all in good condition and in high spirits. Have already
been dancing--I believe twice. At Mrs. General G.'s I met by accident
Mrs. Rogers. She is a pleasant, cheerful, comely woman, to appearance
not past thirty-eight or forty. You know we had heard otherwise.
Eustis has sprained his ankle, which puts him, for the present, out of
the gay world. I have not been abroad except to dine with Mrs. L. I am
rejoiced at what you tell me of La Gree.
</p><p>
Pray take immediately in hand some book which requires attention and
study. You will, I fear, lose the habit of study, which would be a
greater misfortune than to lose your head. M'Kinnon has sent me out a
beautiful picture of the celebrated Madame Ricammier. It is a good
deal like your pretty widow, Mrs. Wright. 'Bon soir'.

Since closing a letter to you last evening, I have received two more,
8th and 19th of November. You are a good girl to write so often. Oh,
yes! I knew how much of a child you were when I sent the pretty
things. Just such another child is 'son pere'.

I write from my breakfast-table, having not yet been abroad, and
having denied myself to everybody. I have, therefore, nothing now to
say, and should not so soon have 'troubled' you again, but for that
part of your letter which speaks of the condition of your house. I
hasten to say that, in my opinion, your house will not be a fit or
healthy residence for your boy before the middle of April or 1st of
May. The walls may, to the touch, appear dry in three or four weeks;
but shut up any room for twelve or twenty-four hours, and enter before
it be aired, you will meet an offensive, and, as I believe, a
pernicious effluvia; an air totally unfit for respiration, unelastic,
and which, when inhaled, leaves the lungs unsatisfied. This is the air
you will breathe if you inhabit the house. I could, perhaps, show
chymically how the atmosphere of the closed rooms becomes thus azotic,
but I prefer to submit to the test of your senses.

Perhaps I did not tell you that Kate made breakfast for Bonaparte one

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
The President has hauled out into the stream. Your boys left my house
yesterday and went on board. They have gained very much of my esteem
and attachment by their amiable manners, their modesty, and good
sense; the friendship which I formerly bore them on your account is
now due to them on their own.
</p><p>
The more I reflect on the destination of these young men, the more I
am pleased with it; and if I had but one son, I think I should place
him in the navy.
</p><p>
If the object be ambition, our navy presents the best prospect of
honour and advancement. A young man of merit may be sure of rapid
promotion and opportunities of distinction. If the pursuit be wealth,
still the navy offers the fairest and most honourable means of
acquiring it.
</p><p>
But another reason, perhaps not often attended to nor generally
believed, would weigh very much with me. The young men of our day,
those, I mean, who are deemed to be in the higher ranks of life, are
addicted to gross and vicious habits, which are often ruinous to their
health and constitutions, and always corrupt the morals and enfeeble
the mind. In naval life they are certainly much less exposed to these
vices. The profession calls for the active exertions both of body and
mind; and I have always remarked that sailors, I mean those among them
who are men of education, and are stimulated by motives of honour or
ambition, have a generosity of temper, a frankness and manliness of
character, which is much more seldom seen in other orders of life.
</p><p>
I am, therefore, firmly persuaded that, situated as our country now
is, a young man of activity and talents has the best chance for
health, fortune, and honour by entering the navy. Your sons are under
peculiar advantages, for you may be assured that they will find not
only a friend, but truly a parent in Captain Truxton. We have talked
much about them, and I am happy to find that his dispositions towards
them are such as you could wish.
</p><p>
I am, dear sir,
</p><p>
Your very affectionate friend and servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
</p><p>
Recollect, if you please, the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=trenton" rel="city">Trenton</a> bridge, and find me a copy of
the law--any information with regard to the difficulties--the expense,

they have done any thing.

Last evening I received the answer of Robert Smith, of which a copy is
enclosed. It may be satisfactory to you to know, 'officially', that
James is favourably spoken of, and is in estimation with the
government. A more precise answer could not, perhaps, be expected from

Jerome Bonaparte, wife, maids of honour (Miss Spear 'et al'.), &c.,
&c., will be here to-morrow. There are various opinions about the
expediency, policy, decency, propriety, and future prospects of this
match. I adhere to Mrs. Caton. To be sure the French laws say
something on this subject. As you are a learned lady, I will not say
what; but, if you avow ignorance, you shall have all I know: not in my
next, for Annapolis is yet on hand. Indeed, matters thicken so fast,
that I may possibly leave this within twenty days to go northward,
without saying a word about it. I hope the shawl (or cloak) has
arrived safe, and that it may be so displayed as to add beauty to
grace and grace to beauty.

</p><p>
How could I forget to tell you the very important event of the
marriage of Jerome Bonaparte with Miss Patterson.
</p><p>
It took place on Saturday, the 24th ult. Mrs. Caton approves of this
match, and therefore A. B. does, for he respects greatly the opinions
of Mrs. Caton.
</p><p>
I like much your reasoning about Morris's place and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill. Yet
would not a permanent residence in town for some, for many, for all
reasons, be better? La G. is much better than I had heard-- 'd'un
certaine' age, and well-looking, considering that circumstance.
Cheerful, good-tempered, the best of housewives, and, as it is
thought, 'willing'.
</p><p>
Celeste--(for this I begin a new line) Celeste will be seen on the way
home, but that La R. spoils every thing in that place. La Planche;
that you will never find out. I bet you thirty guineas against M'K.'s
shawl. By-the-by, the shawl is ordered on; at this moment, perhaps, on
the perilous ocean, and unensured. La Planche, I say, was seen on our
way hither. All right and pretty; improved since the last inspection.
Great friend of La R.; 'tant pis'. Lex et ux. ill suited; mischief
brewing. 'Gamp', the mutual friend and confidant.
</p><p>
Now for the trip to Annapolis. No, not now either. It is past two
o'clock in the morning (no matter of what day, for I don't intend to
date this, seeing it will equally suit all dates), and I am (not)
sleepy. Yet I will go to bed, and not be kept up by any such baggage.
So good-morning. Poor little Natalie, I have not written her a line.
What's the matter I don't write to Natalie any more? I say I will go
to bed. The fire is out, and I have no wood.

You may assure the family that I never was in better health; that I
have not been wounded or hurt, and have had no quarrel with anybody. I
received your letter of the 29th this evening. Let nothing hinder you

so that you may be able to keep the accounts of the family. I am very
much obliged to you for teaching Nancy. She will learn more from you
than by going to school.

I shall be at home about the last of this month, when I will make you

I am very sorry for poor Charlotte, and do most sincerely sympathize
with Sally. She must know my great attachment for her brother.

Of my plans for the spring nothing can be said, for nothing is
resolved. It is not probable that I shall be able to visit you; but I
shall expect you very early. If you are to come by land, I will meet
you on the road; perhaps in this place, perhaps in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. I do not
now see that it will be possible for me to visit South Carolina. Now,
what are your plans? The shawl was ordered on the very day I received
your commands; whether it has actually been sent I know not, but most
probably it has.
</p><p>
Of the boy you never say enough. Nothing about his French in your

letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> says that Eleonore's boy was well on the 13th. Your
icehouse and vaults are finished. Of Annapolis I find the newspapers
have anticipated me. They will tell you where I dined, and supped, and
whom I saw.
</p><p>
Madame Bonaparte passed a week here. She is a charming little woman;
just the size and nearly the figure of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> Burr Alston; by some
thought a little like her; perhaps not so well in the shoulders;
dresses with taste and simplicity (by some thought too free); has
sense, and spirit, and sprightliness. A little of the style and manner
of Susan Smith.
</p><p>
Mrs. Merry  is tall, fair, fat-- 'pas trop', however. No more than a
desirable embonpoint. Much of grace and dignity, ease and
sprightliness; full of intelligence. An Englishwoman who has lived
much in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and has all that could be wished of the manners of both
countries. An amiable and interesting companion, with whose
acquaintance you will, next summer, be much gratified. She proposes to
pass some time in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.
</p><p>
I want a French translation of the Constitution of the United States,
and, for the purpose, send you a copy in English. It will, I fear, be
a great labour to you; but I cannot get it done here, and it may not
be useless to you to burnish up your French a little. Do you ever hear
from Natalie? I have not yet written to her. How scandalous.
</p><p>
You do not say whether the boy knows his letters. I am sure he may now
be taught them, and then put a pen into his hand, and set him to
imitate them. He may read and write before he is three years old.
This, with speaking French, would make him a tolerably accomplished
lad of that age, and worthy of his blood.

The papers herewith enclosed will show you our possession of

to limit our west bounds to the Mississippi, with the addition of the
Island of Orleans only; on this consideration that government would
still hold on the west bank of the Mississippi, from the river
Iberville to the 31st degree of latitude, an extent of one hundred
miles.
</p><p>
In attempting to legislate for our newly-acquired territory, it is
doubted whether the Louisianians can be received into the Union
without an amendment to the Constitution. Consider of this. Again, are
they citizens of the United States, or can Congress make them such? A
bill establishing a form of government is now before the Senate; when
it shall have passed that house I will send you a copy. It is at
present in too crude a state to merit your notice.
</p><p>
The newspapers will have informed you that a committee has been
appointed in the House of Representatives to inquire into the official
conduct of Judge Chace. Peters is associated with him, but he is not
the object, and the insertion of his name was accidental. This
inquiry, as is obvious, is with a view to an impeachment. If it result
in an impeachment, and an immediate trial be had, Congress will sit
till May or June. Yours very affectionately,

It is seriously my intention to visit you next week, if I can get

The association of Peters with Chace was, I believe, accidental. It
was moved (I think by one of your members), and, as they sat together
on the bench, it was not, at the time, seen how they could be
separated. I presume it affords him a new subject for wit. On receipt

MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
When I last wrote you (about Thursday, I think), I felt the approaches
of a headache, which I concluded would be, as usual, the torment of
twenty-four hours only. On the contrary, it has pursued me without
intermission. I have undergone cathartic, emetic, and phlebotomy,
operations not experienced by me in twenty years, and all to no
purpose. The pain continues, but to-day has allowed me to leave my bed
for an hour or so at a time. At one of these intervals I now write to
you to say that this incident has rendered my journey doubtful, though
on the day I last wrote you I informed the Senate that I should have
occasion to be absent for two or three weeks.
</p><p>
It is extraordinary that all these medical experiments, and a total
abstinence from food for three days, has produced no diminution of
strength or spirits. At this instant I feel able to start for
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, (the snow eight inches deep) not withstanding. It will,
however, be impossible to move before Thursday, if at all.
</p><p>
January 24.
</p><p>
After writing, last evening, the nonsense on the other page, I
recollected that the mail had closed. This postscript is added to say
that I am much better to-day; but little pain, yet my head too weak to
bear the least motion, and fear it will not allow me to travel for
several days.
</p><p>
I. Brown is again in the chair as president of the Senate. It was a
hard election. Ten or twelve ballotings. The Virginia interest
supported Mr. Franklin. Yours,

mortal or alarming symptoms. On Saturday I take a ride to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>,
where I am to dine with Madame Bonaparte. Then on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,;
thence, perhaps, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and here again by the time your answer
can arrive. Have not yet written to Natalie. How shameful!
</p><p>

more at present of great importance to add I remain yours, &c.,

easier and lighter I feel.

You will be proud, as a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,er, to see that the first attempt to
create a taste for painting and sculpture has been made in our city.
We have about forty busts and groups. Lailson's theatre (west side
Greenwich-street) has been fitted up for their reception. It forms a
circular room of about sixty or seventy feet diameter, lighted by a
dome, and to us, who have seen nothing better, the thing, of course,
looks well. Come and see our infant efforts.
</p><p>
I am just leaving this place for a few days on a visit to

DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
Your letter of the 6th of January is received at the moment that I am
leaving this city on a tour to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for two or three weeks. I
can, therefore, only acknowledge it. The map was a most acceptable
present. I value it greatly as the work of Madame Ellery; a
circumstance which my vanity has not allowed me to conceal.
</p><p>
You may rely on my zeal and my good will. You can estimate their
importance. On my return you will hear again from me.
</p><p>
The bill, or project of law, herewith enclosed, is now under debate in
the Senate. You will, therefore, consider it as a project merely, not
yet a law. In the course of this discussion it may receive important
alterations, and may be finally rejected. Do not, therefore, suffer
any copy to be taken of it, still less to get into newspapers, if any
you have. You may show it to whom you please. If you have any
acquaintance with Mr. Daniel Clarke, pray let him see it. I wish his
and your opinions, though they may, probably, be received too late to
influence the result. Mr. Clarke is not known to me personally, but
very much through our common friend General Dayton. With respectful
compliments and thanks to Mrs. Ellery, I am your friend,

Havre de Grace (Susquehannah), January 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>. In a former letter I
told you we had eight inches snow at Washington. On Saturday last,
28th, fell six or eight inches more, so that we had a foot depth of
snow, cold weather, and, of course, good sleighing. The vice-president
having, with great judgment and science, calculated the gradations of
cold in different latitudes, discovered that for every degree he
should go north he might count on 'four and a half inches' of snow.
Thus he was sure of 'sixteen and a half' inches at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,;
_twenty-one inches' at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and so for all the intermediate
space. Hence he wisely concluded to take off the wheels from his
coachee and to set it on runners. This was no sooner resolved than
done. With his sleigh and four horses he arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, at early
dinner. Passed the evening with Madame Bonaparte; all very charming.
Came off this morning; fine sleighing. A hundred times he applauded
the wisdom of his plan. Within 'six' miles of the Susquehannah the
snow appeared thin; within 'four', the ground was bare. It had not
thawed, but none had fallen. He dragged on to this place, and here he
is in the midst of the most forlorn dilemma. This is palpable fraud in
_monsieur le tems', to hold out such lures merely to draw one into
jeopardy. Having neither wife nor daughter near me on whom to vent my
spleen, renders the case more deplorable. It is downright desperation.
</p><p>
After pacing the floor with a very quick step for about five minutes,
I determined to call for a good dinner and a bottle of wine, and,
after the discussion whereof, I hope to be more able to meet the
exigence. You shall presently know.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, February 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
Just arrived--all well. The dinner and wine mentioned t'other side
operated so happily, that, before the repast was concluded, I ordered
my horses to the door, drove over the Susquehannah on the ice, and
came that night to the head of Elk. Next day to Chester, having seen
friend Dickenson 'en passant' (the daughters not visible, on account
of the loss of their mother, who died 'last summer_), and breakfasted
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, on the morning of the 1st of February. The ebullition
of the 30th January was intended to have been finished at Havre de
Grace and sent to the postoffice. I came off in too much haste, and,
seeing it now in my writing-case, I thought it a pity that so precious
a morceau should be lost to the world.
</p><p>
_Tout le monde' is marrying at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. You will not have a
_single single' (decipher that) acquaintance there on your return.
Yes, La R., La Planche, and La Bin. may remain. I went to a wedding
supper at Mrs. Moore's, whose daughter has married Willing--could any
one suppose she was 'unwilling_? Execrable! Mr. Boadley died a few
days ago. Madame of course was invisible. Ann Stuart will, most
likely, marry P. C.--very well. She is very pretty. Mary Rush just
married Manners, a captain in the British army. She looked quite
melancholy, being on the point of setting off for Niagara, where her
husband is stationed. Binney and Keene look better than I ever saw
them. Keene is learning the harp. They are at lodgings in town, and,
happening to be near my quarters, I saw them two or three times a day.
</p><p>
I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, yesterday, and arrived, as you see, after a very
pleasant journey. Fine, mild winter weather. Roads hard and smooth.
Note. I left my runners and got wheels at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. How could I
omit Celeste and her sisters, whom I saw several times? What of that?
Pray can it be true that she was engaged to a young man whom we knew
and valued, and who lately died in your country? To-morrow I am to see
La G. Pray for me.
</p><p>
To-morrow, February 9th.
</p><p>
A most ugly northeast storm of rain, and hail, and mist. Shall not see
La G. to-day. God bless thee.

I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, on the 16th. The roads
were so very bad that I sent back Sam, George, and the horses from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=trenton" rel="city">Trenton</a>, and came on in the mail stage 'sans valet'. One great
discovery has been made by the experiment, namely, that George is not
only useless on the road, but requires abundance of my care, so that,
in fact, I have less trouble without him.
</p><p>
On the way I saw Celeste, and renewed, with some levity, a certain
subject. It excited an agitation perfectly astonishing. The emotion
was so great as to produce universal tremour, which attracted the
notice of the company (there was a room full); I was exceedingly
alarmed and perplexed, having imagined the denouement of last summer
to have been conclusive, in good faith. Undoubtedly there is some
secret agent, some underwork, perhaps restraint, of which I am
ignorant. I strongly suspect that she has done violence to her
feelings. Shall I or shall I not investigate this point? Humph!
heighho!
</p><p>
I have just been visiting Monsieur Dubourg, president of the French
College. The visit, indeed, was to the institution rather than to the
man. Both please me greatly. It (the college) seems to me to possess
some advantages over any other in the United States; more decorous
subordination. The living languages, French and Spanish, may there be
learned by association and habit. The French, the Spanish, the English
(I mean the learners of those languages) are each in separate
apartments. Not a word is spoken but in the language intended to be
taught. It is even the medium of instruction for every other branch.
The Senats speak Spanish fluently. 'Bon soir'.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, February 27, 1504.
</p><p>
DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
On my return from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, a few days past, I had the pleasure to meet
here your father, and to receive your letter of the 21st of January.
It is not probable that it will be in my power to visit South Carolina
this spring. If, fortunately, I should find leisure for a journey
which I have so much at heart, my first object would be Statesburgh;
but as Mr. and Mrs. Alston will be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, early in the season, I
entertain hopes that this, with other motives, may induce you to pass
the summer and autumn with me. Yet great as is my solicitude to see
your wife and child, to renew my acquaintance with you, to tender you
my friendship and affection, and to claim a return, I would by no
means urge a measure inconsistent with your interest. Of this you only
can judge. I should not, perhaps, have repeated the invitation
expressed in my last letter to Natalie, but that I learn from your
father that her health has suffered materially. Hence I am filled with
apprehension of the effects of your long summer on a northern
constitution already debilitated.
</p><p>
Presuming that you hear from your father as much as you desire to know
of the doings of Congress, I abstain from those subjects. Be assured
of the great consideration and esteem with which I am your friend,

Your letter of the 28th February, covering a newspaper, was received
last evening. It cannot yet be settled whether there will be
commissioners to run the boundary line with Spain; but I will mention
the thing to the Smiths, who still profess friendship for General
Wilkinson. My direct interference otherwise would not probably be
useful to him. Please to put the enclosed, for Truxton, in the
postoffice. One of his friends here (not a man in power, for he has, I
believe, no such friend) thinks he will certainly be called into
service; and he states to me pretty plausible grounds for the opinion.
Yet I doubt, which is perhaps the result only of my ignorance.
</p><p>
I shall be with you the last of next week, or, at farthest, within ten
days, on my way home.

SIR,
</p><p>
Immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 15th of February, I
wrote to Mr. Madison for the information you desired. It affords me
great pleasure to learn that you are engaged in a literary pursuit so
congenial with your taste and your talents. If I can in any way
promote your views in this or in any other instance, I entreat that
you will command me, 'without apology'. I have now the satisfaction to
enclose you Mr. Madison's answer, which I this day received.
</p><p>
You speak of a letter written to me some time ago-on the subject of
Captain Ingraham's voyage. It is impossible, sir, that I can have been
guilty of so gross an inattention as to have permitted a letter from
you to have remained unnoticed. I have no recollection of that which
you mention, and am persuaded that it never came to hand.

Allow me to repeat the assurance of the very great consideration and

Friday last was the day assigned for the appearance of Judge Pickering
on his impeachment. He did not appear; but an 'amicus curiae_
suggested that the judge was insane, and tendered the proof of that
fact.
</p><p>
This has given rise to some troublesome questions, rendered more
embarrassing by the total want of rule or precedent, and still
increased by some dissatisfaction on the part of the managers, which
seems to have also infected the House of Representatives. In this
dilemma it would be improper that I should leave the Senate.
Considerations, however, of a nature which you will more readily
approve, have had an influence in detaining me. A decision is hoped
this day on the points now under discussion. I take my leave as soon
as this business is disposed of, and will be with you in the course of

</p><p>
Your letter, dated early in this month--I don't recollect the very
day, having left the letter in town; but you write so seldom that a
reference to the month is sufficiently descriptive; your letter, then,
of March, announcing your removal to the Oaks, the pretty description
of your house and establishment, 'and all that', were very amusing. I
had really begun to doubt whether you were not all dead or something
worse.
</p><p>
I shall get the speech, no thanks to you; there is a copy in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for which I have written, and it will come endorsed by
the fair hand of Celeste: truly her hand and arm are handsome. I did
not see her on my way through-- 'tant mieux'; for I took great affront;
thence ensued explanations, &c. Nothing like a quarrel to advance
love. La Planche I did see twice in one day; the last a long, very
long visit. Lovely in weeds. La G., of whom you inquire, is of the
grave age of forty-six; about the age of the vice-president.
</p><p>
They are very busy here about an election between Morgan Lewis and A.
Burr. The former supported by the Livingstons and Clintons, the latter
_per se'. I would send you some new and amusing libels against the
vice-president, but, as you did not send the speech, nor did even
acknowledge the receipt of one of the many public documents which I
took the trouble of forwarding, it may be presumed that this sort of
intercourse is not desired.
</p><p>
Ph. Church and Miss Stewart, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, it is said, are to be
married; Duer (which Duer I don't know) and Miss M. Denning reported

part avowed, on hers not denied.

The Earl of Selkirk is here: a frank, unassuming, sensible man of

dines with me on Monday.

If you had one particle of invention or genius, you would have taught

</p><p>
The History of Frederic II. will amuse you. You will read Montesquieu
with interest and instruction. Yet he has a character--I mean that his
'Esprit des Loix_" has a character above its merit. His historical
facts are, nevertheless, collected and arranged with judgment, and his
reasoning is ingenuous. The political dogmas are not, however, to be
received as axioms. They are neither founded on experience nor on a
knowledge of human nature.
</p><p>
You improve greatly in your style and manner of writing. A little more
pains and a little more reading, and you will exceed Lady Mary W.
Montague. Practice, however, is indispensable. The art of writing is
an acquirement, as much as music or dancing.

What nice, pretty paper. I verily believe that it would not have
entered into my head to write to you; but 'Peet' or 'Peter' just
brought in a ream of paper so handsome looking, that it tempted me to
write, and 'chose' being generally uppermost in my mind, of course it
will be addressed to 'chose', though, for aught that yet appears, it
will suit as well 'quelque autre chose'.
</p><p>
I, too, write in a storm; an election storm, of the like you have once
been a witness. The thing began yesterday, and will terminate
to-morrow. My headquarters are in Johnstreet, and I have, since
beginning this letter, been already three times interrupted.
</p><p>
A very modest and amiable proposition! that I should ride sixteen
hundred miles to see a couple of 'varmins'. As to your system of
economy, I should rejoice at it if I believed it; but I well know that
you will spend double at the Mills that you would here. Now for my

You take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill; bring no horse nor carriage. I have got a
nice, new, beautiful little chariot, made purposely to please you. I
have also a new coachee, very light, on an entire new construction,
invented by the vice-president. Now these two machines are severally
adapted to two horses, and you may take your choice of them. Of horses
I have five; three always and wholly at your devotion, and the whole
five occasionally. Harry and Sam are both good coachmen, either at
your orders. Of servants there are enough for family purposes.
Eleonore, however, must attend you, for the sake of the heir apparent.
You will want no others, as there are at my house <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a>, Nancy, and a
small girl of about eleven. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> may bring a footman. Any thing
further will be useless; he may, however, bring six or eight of them,
if he like. The cellars and garrets are well stocked with wine, having
had a great supply last fall. I shall take rooms (a house, &c.) in
town, but will live with you as much or as little as you may please
and as we can agree; but my establishment at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill must
remain, whether you come or not. Great part of the summer I shall be
off eight or ten days at a time, but no long journeys. You will have
to ride every day or two to Montalto to direct the laying out of the
grounds, &c.
</p><p>
In this way you cannot, without wanton extravagance, expend more than
four hundred dollars. If you insist on bringing your horses, there is
now room for them, and plenty of provender. You ought to come by
water, but not to be swindled again by taking a cabin. Bring your Ada,
if you please, to finish her education.
</p><p>
Tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> that I ordered my booksellers to open a correspondence
with him, and to send out, by way of sample, and under the advice of
M'Kinnon, not to exceed the value of fifty guineas. M'Kinnon writes me
that the articles will be here by the first or before the middle of
June, shipped for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.
</p><p>
I forgot to speak of the election. 
</p><p>
Both parties claim majorities, and there never was, in my opinion, an
election, of the result of which so little judgment could be formed.
A. B. will have a small majority in this city 'if to-morrow should be
a fair day', and not else.
</p><p>
You may wonder how I live and mean to live in town. Peter and Alexis
are all my attendants. My breakfast is made 'a la garcon_: dinners,
&c., from a neighbouring eatinghouse. Adieu.

Your letter of the 16th of April had better luck than that other of
the 1st.; on the road, I mean, for the reception of both was equally
kind. The last arrived yesterday. I do not remember exactly what it is
about, and it is on my table in the library up stairs, and I am
writing in the dining-room beside a good fire on this evening of the
first of May. Now 'madame pour quelque chose tres interessante'.
</p><p>
How limited is human foresight! How truly are we the sport of
accident. To-morrow I had proposed to visit Celeste, and now, alas!
_cetera desunt'.
</p><p>
La G. may be forty-one. Something of the style and manners of 'la
tante de La' R. Is about as silly; talks as much, and as much
nonsense; is certainly good-tempered and cheerful; rather comely,
abating a flat chest; about two inches taller than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. Things
are not gone to extremities; but there is danger--poor gampy.
</p><p>
The election is lost by a great majority: 'tant mieux'. It does not
appear possible that I should make you a visit; even if La G. should
not prevent it, which ought to be hoped, some other thing of like kind
will.
</p><p>
Tell Natalie that I have just now received her letter, which she
acknowledges to be in answer to 'four of mine'. Of the boy you have
been remarkably reserved in your two last letters. I conclude,
however, that he cannot be dead, as you would, probably, have thought
that a circumstance worthy of being mentioned, at least in a
postscript. Now Natalie has written me a whole page about her girl,
for which I am very grateful.
</p><p>
What would you bet that La G. is not in a kind of quandary just now?
Gods! what a pathetic love-scene it will make if it shall go on.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, May 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>. I send you a sample of that species of
philosophy which I have thought particularly suited to your cast of
mind and the delicacy of your taste. You are to read from the 66th
page to the 125th. What precedes and follows will fatigue, without
interesting or amusing you. Indeed, some of it will not be very
intelligible, and you must not be disgusted in the outset.
</p><p>
The author has not noticed those advantages which personal beauty
derives from intellectual improvement, or expansion of the mind
tempered by commerce with the world, nor how grace and expression may
be thus heightened and improved. I wish some one would write a volume
on this subject. Indeed, I have had thoughts of doing it myself, and
holding you up as the example to verify my theory. To this some
thoughtless ones may object, that, where nature had done so much,
nothing was left for the work of art. There cannot be a greater error.
The essential difference between the silly and the wise consists in
their different capacity for improvement. Bestow what pains, offer
what advantages you may to a dull subject, and she will remain
stationary. One of taste and talents, on the contrary, extracts
improvement from every thing, and approaches perfection in proportion
as the means of advancement are afforded.
</p><p>
What grave nonsense, you will say, or at least think, if this should
find you, as is probable, surrounded by admirers uniting to persuade
you that you are already perfect; and in such company how stupid a
compliment will it seem to tell you that you may still improve; that
there are no limits to the improvement and approaches which you may
make towards perfection. Such, however ungallant, will be the language
of your admirer and friend,

I think I have answered, or at least have noticed, your letter of the
17th, being the last which has been received, and, as usual,
postmarked nine days after its date.
</p><p>
The affair of La G. is becoming serious. After due reflection, this
does appear to me to be the most discreet thing--prudence,
cheerfulness, and good-temper are ingredients of importance. I will
offer homage. Are you content? Answer quickly.
</p><p>
Madame Bonaparte and husband are here. I have just seen them and no
more. For reasons unknown to me (doubtless some state policy), we are
suddenly become strangers.
</p><p>
Of all earthly things I most want to see your boy. Does he yet know
his letters? If not, you surely must want skill, for, most certain, he
can't want genius. You must tell me of all his acquirements.

It ought to have been mentioned that I have not seen my inamorata

I think I will never again be so long without writing to you. It has
been a daily and nightly reproach to me since the 8th of May, the date
of the preceding part of this letter. The matter there spoken of
seemed to be in so precarious a state, that I did not like to send you
that page alone, and, in fact, knew not what to add to it. It is just
so now; but from that day to this I have not seen La G., owing partly
to accident and partly to apathy.
</p><p>
Your long and interesting letter of the 5th and 6th inst has been
received. It shall be answered anon. In the mean time I repeat the
injunction that you read, and in sequence. Study philosophy, if
nothing should more allure you. Darwin and Harris you have; others I
will send. Read over Shakspeare critically, marking the passages which
are beautiful, absurd, or obscure. I will do the same, and one of
these days we will compare. To improve your style and language is,
however, the most interesting point. In this you will be aided by
regaining your Latin. Gods! how much you might accomplish this year.

Your letter of the 14th of May is the last, and, I believe,
unanswered, which is rather scandalous on both sides; but the letter
of A.B.A., at the foot of yours, was far the most interesting. I have
studied every pothook and trammel of his first literary performance,
to see what rays of genius could be discovered. You remember our
friend Schweitzer, nephew and pupil of Lavater. He used to insist that
as much was to be inferred from the handwriting as from the face. I
showed him a letter from a man of great fame, and he saw genius in
every stroke. I then produced a letter from an arrant blockhead and
great knave, but so like the other as not to be distinguished, at
least by my unphysiognomical discernment. He acknowledged that there
was resemblance to an ignorant eye; but, said he, triumphantly, this
(latter) could never have made that scratch, which sybilistic scratch
was the mere prolongation of the last letter of the last word in a
sentence. Now it occurs to me that one of A.B.A.'s scratches is
exactly in the line of genius according to Schweitzer; and surely more
may be presumed from the instinctive effort of untutored infancy than
from the laboured essay of scientific cultivation. To aid your
observations in this line, I pray you to read Martinus Scriblerius.
Mr. and Mrs. Hayward are happily living with the mother.
</p><p>
I am stationary (_not paper, wax, and quills_), but, adjectively
speaking, unlocomotive. The affair of La G. has also been perfectly
stationary since my last, the parties not having met; but hearing that
La G. has expressed a sort of surprise, approaching to vexation, at
this apathy, the other party has 'kindly' promised an interview
to-morrow. If it should take place, you will, in due time, know the
result. Your permission or dissent is impatiently expected by

Another interview yesterday with La G. One more would be fatal and

</p><p>To-morrow, did I say? 'Tis nowhere to be found but in the fool's
calendar;" and yet I said "to-morrow." The morrow brought me an ague
in the face, which I have been nursing from that day to this, in great
ill-humour. 'Till yesterday I could not dispense with my mufflings,
and yesterday we kept Theo.'s birthday. The Laights and half a dozen
others laughed an hour, and danced an hour, and drank her health at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill. We had your picture in the dining-room; but, as it is a
profile, and would not look at us, we hung it up, and placed Natalie's
at table, which laughs and talks with us.
</p><p>
I do not like the boy looking pale so early in the season. It argues
ill; but I like much his heroism and his gallantry. You can't think
how much these little details amuse and interest me. If you were quite
mistress of natural philosophy, he would now be hourly acquiring a
knowledge of various branches, particularly natural history, botany,
and chymistry. Pursue these studies, and also that of language. For
fifty dollars you may get, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, a chymical apparatus, put
up in a small box, with which more than one hundred experiments may be
made.
</p><p>
Your idea of dressing up pieces of ancient mythology in the form of
amusing tales for children is very good. You 'yourself' must write
them. Send your performances to me, and, within three weeks after they
are received, you shall have them again in print. This will be not
only an amusing occupation, but a very useful one to yourself. It will
improve your style and your language, give you habits of accuracy, and
add a little to your stock of knowledge. Natalie, too, must work at
it, and I'll bet that she makes the best tale. I will be your editor
and your critic.

You laugh at me so much and so impudently, that I will not say a word

Pray, madam, give your orders to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> yourself. She writes a better

Having been shivering with cold all day, though in perfect health, I
have now, just at sunset, had a fire in my library, and am sitting
near it and enjoying it, if that word be applicable to any thing done
in solitude. Some very wise man, however, has exclaimed,
</p><p>
  "Oh! fools, who think it solitude to be alone."
</p><p>
This is but poetry. Let us, therefore, drop the subject, lest it lead
to another on which I have imposed silence on myself.
</p><p>
You may recollect, and, if you do not, your husband will, that he has
several times requested me to open a correspondence between him and my
bookseller in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. To introduce the thing, I desired Mr. White to
send with my next parcel of books a parcel for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, not
exceeding the value of fifty guineas, and referred him to Mr. M'Kinnon
for instructions. The books came out accordingly, and, with respect to
my box, all was smooth and fair; but it was alleged by the owners of
the ship and by the captain, that the box for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, having been
irregularly shipped, occasioned the seizure and detention of the ship,
and the owners refused to deliver the box unless I would pay thirty
guineas damages. This I declined, and the box was taken to the
custom-house, where it has lain these six weeks unopened. After the
expiration of nine months it will be opened, and the contents sold at
auction by order of the officers of the customs. I shall write to the
bookseller, Mr. White, to employ his own agent here to look to the box
as his property. This trifling tale would not have been told but to
show <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> that I really have made an attempt to establish a
correspondence for him.
</p><p>
You ought to be collecting a few books for your own use. One way of
forming a small library, and which I recommend to you, is to note down
the title of every book which, either from its reputation or from
perusal, you may wish to possess. Make you a small memorandum book for
this purpose. If they be written on loose scraps, by the time you get
a dozen eleven of them will be lost. I recommend to you a new
publication called the Edinburgh Review. One number is issued every
three months. The plan of the editors differs from that of similar
works in that they give more copious extracts, and notice only books
of merit or 'reputation'.
</p><p>
I wait impatiently for some of your tales. No hasty scrawls, madam,
for I will correct nothing. We have now here three shiploads of South
Carolinians, who all find the weather intolerably hot, though I have
slept under a blanket every night except one in all June.

Jerome Bonaparte has taken Belvidere for the season. The two French

</p><p>
SIR,
</p><p>
Your letter of the 20th inst. has been this day received. Having
considered it attentively, I regret to find in it nothing of that
sincerity and delicacy which you profess to value.
</p><p>
Political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of
a rigid adherence to the laws of honour and the rules of decorum. I
neither claim such privilege nor indulge it in others.
</p><p>
The common sense of mankind affixes to the epithet adopted by Doctor
Cooper the idea of dishonour. It has been publicly applied to me under
the sanction of your name. The question is not whether he has
understood the meaning of the word, or has used it according to syntax
and with grammatical accuracy, but whether you have authorized this
application, either directly or by uttering expressions or opinions
derogatory to my honour. The time "when" is in your own knowledge, but
no way material to me, as the calumny has now first been disclosed so
as to become the subject of my notice, and as the effect is present
and palpable.

Your letter has furnished me with new reasons for requiring a definite
reply.

Having lately written my will, and given my private letters and papers
in charge to you, I have no other direction to give you on the subject
but to request you to burn all such as, if by accident made public,
would injure any person. This is more particularly applicable to the
letters of my female correspondents. All my letters, and copies of
letters, of which I have retained copies, are in the six blue boxes.
If your husband or any one else (no one, however, could do it so well
as he) should think it worth while to write a sketch of my life, some
materials will be found among these letters.
</p><p>
Tell my dear Natalie that I have not left her any thing, for the very
good reason that I had nothing to leave to any one. My estate will
just about pay my debts and no more--I mean, if I should die this
year. If I live a few years, it is probable things may be better. Give
Natalie one of the pictures of me. There are three in this house; that
of Stewart, and two by Vanderlyn. Give her any other little tokens she
may desire. One of those pictures, also, I pray you to give to Doctor
Eustis. To Bartow something--what you please.
</p><p>
I pray you and your husband to convey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> the small lot, not
numbered, which is the fourth article mentioned in my list of
property. It is worth about two hundred and fifty dollars. Give her
also fifty dollars in cash as a reward for her fidelity. Dispose of
Nancy as you please. She is honest, robust, and good-tempered. Peter
is the most intelligent and best-disposed black I have ever known. (I
mean the black boy I bought last fall from Mr. Turnbull.) I advise
you, by all means, to keep him as the valet of your son. Persuade
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> to live with you if you can.
</p><p>
I have desired that my wearing apparel be given to Frederic. Give him
also a sword or pair of pistols.
</p><p>
Burn immediately a small bundle, tied with a red string, which you
will find in the little flat writing-case--that which we used with the
curricle. The bundle is marked '"Put.'
</p><p>
The letters of 'Clara' (the greater part of them) are tied up in a
white handkerchief, which you will find in the blue box No. 5. You may
hand them to Mari, if you please. My letters to Clara are in the same
bundle. You, and by-and-by Aaron Burr Alston, may laugh at 'gamp' when
you look over this nonsense.
</p><p>
Many of the letters of 'Clara' will be found among my ordinary
letters, filed and marked, sometimes '"Clara"', sometimes "L."
</p><p>
I am indebted to you, my dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, for a very great portion
of the happiness which I have enjoyed in this life. You have
completely satisfied all that my heart and affections had hoped or
even wished. With a little more perseverance, determination, and
industry, you will obtain all that my ambition or vanity had fondly
imagined. Let your son have occasion to be proud that he had a mother.
Adieu. Adieu.

</p><p>
I have directed that the flat writing-case and the blue box No. 5,
both in the library, be opened only by you. There are six of these
blue boxes, which contain my letters and copies of letters, except
those two clumsy quarto volumes, in which letter-press copies are
pasted. They are somewhere in the library. The keys of the other five
boxes are in No. 5.
</p><p>
It just now occurs to me to give poor dear Frederic my watch. I have
already directed my executors here to give him my wearing apparel.
When you come hither you must send for Frederic, and open your whole
heart to him. He loves 'me' almost as much as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> does; and he
does love 'you' to adoration.
</p><p>
I have just now found four packets of letters between 'Clara and
Mentor' besides those in the handkerchief. I have thrown them loose
into box No. 5. What a medley you will find in that box!
</p><p>
The seal of the late General <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, which you will find in the
blue box No. 5, was given to me by Mr. and Mrs. Law. You may keep it
for your son, or give it to whom you please.

Assure Mrs. Law of my latest recollection. Adieu. Adieu.

</p><p>
MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
You will find enclosed a statement of my affairs. Swartwout and Van
Ness are joint executors with you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. It was indispensable
that there should be an executor on the spot. I have directed them to
sell immediately my horses, and to sell nothing else until your
pleasure shall be known. I pray that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> may be consulted and
gratified in this particular.
</p><p>
Explanations of every concern of my property is given in two sheets of
paper which accompany my will. The enclosed is an abstract.
</p><p>
It would have been a great satisfaction to me to have had your
assurance that you would assume my debts, and take and dispose of the
property at discretion. It may be done in a way which you would find a
convenience. My creditors would take your assumption at such time as
you might judge convenient. The property will, undoubtedly, produce
more than the amount of my debts. What you may not incline to keep may
be forthwith turned into cash.
</p><p>
The library, maps, pictures, and wine are articles which you will
need, and which you cannot procure without great trouble and more
money. I think, too, you would do well to retain <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill, as a
more convenient residence than Montalto, particularly as no expense
will be necessary for buildings or improvements.
</p><p>
My private letters I have directed to be put in the hands of
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, that she may select from them her own, those of her mother,
and some others. Among them and my copies you will find much of
trifling, something of amusement, and a little of interest.
</p><p>
Get from Mr. Taylor (the younger), of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> or Camden, my letters
to his brother-in-law, the late J.E. Hunt, who was one of your
chancellors.
</p><p>
Messrs. R. Bunner, William Duer, John Duer, and J.W. Smith, of this
city, and John Van Ness Yates, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, all lawyers and young men of
talents, have manifested great and disinterested zeal in my favour on
some recent occasions. 
</p><p>
I pray you to take some notice of them, and give to each of them, and
to William T. Broome, now in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, some small token of remembrance of
me. William T. Broome, with great defects of temper, unites very
considerable literary talents and acquirements. A little attention
would attach them all to you.
</p><p>
My very worthy friend, Charles Biddle, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, has six or
seven sons--three of them grown up. With different characters and
various degrees of intelligence, they will all be men of eminence and
of influence. Call to see the father when you pass through
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and receive the sons kindly.
</p><p>
I have taught my friends in every quarter to look to you as my
representative. There are many of them, your discernment will
distinguish which, on whose loyalty and firmness you may rely through
all changes.
</p><p>
I have called out General Hamilton, and we meet tomorrow morning. Van
Ness will give you the particulars. The preceding has been written in
contemplation of this event. If it should be my lot to fall, * * * * *
* * * yet I shall live in you and your son. I commit to you all that
is most dear to me--my reputation and my daughter. Your talents and
your attachment will be the guardian of the one--your kindness and
your generosity of the other. Let me entreat you to stimulate and aid
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> in the cultivation of her mind. It is indispensable to her
happiness and essential to yours. It is also of the utmost importance
to your son. She would presently acquire a critical knowledge of
Latin, English, and all branches of natural philosophy. All this would
be poured into your son. If you should differ with me as to the
importance of this measure, suffer me to ask it of you as a last
favour. She will richly compensate your trouble.
</p><p>
Most affectionately adieu,

The elder Prevost,  Augustine James Frederic Prevost, is a most
amiable and honourable man. Under the garb of coarse rusticity you
will find, if you know him, refinement, wit, a delicate sense of
propriety, the most inflexible intrepidity, incorruptible integrity,
and disinterestedness. I wish you could know him; but it would be
difficult, by reason of his diffidence and great reluctance to mingle
with the world. It has been a source of extreme regret and
mortification to me that he should be lost to society and to his
friends. The case seems almost remediless, for, alas! 'he is married!_

recollection. She is now with her husband at St. Jago of Cuba.

GENERAL HAMILTON died yesterday. The malignant federalists or tories,
and the imbittered Clintonians, unite in endeavouring to excite public
sympathy in his favour and indignation against his antagonist.
Thousands of absurd falsehoods are circulated with industry. The most
illiberal means are practised in order to produce excitement, and, for
the moment, with effect.
</p><p>
I propose leaving town for a few days, and meditate also a journey for
some weeks, but whither is not resolved. Perhaps to Statesburgh. You
will hear from me again in about eight days.

</p><p>
The event of which you have been advised has driven me into a sort of
exile, and may terminate in an actual and permanent ostracism. Our
most unprincipled Jacobins are the loudest in their lamentations for
the death of General Hamilton, whom, for many years, they have
uniformly represented as the most detestable and unprincipled of
men--the motives are obvious. Every sort of persecution is to be
exercised against me. A coroner's jury will sit this evening, being
the 'fourth' time. The object of this unexampled measure is to obtain
an inquest of murder. Upon this a warrant will issue to apprehend me,
and, if I should be taken, no bail would probably be allowed. You know
enough of the temper and principles of the generality of the officers
of our state government to form a judgment of my position.
</p><p>
The statement  in the Morning Chronicle was not submitted to my
perusal, I being absent at the time of the publication. Several
circumstances not very favourable to the deceased are suppressed; I
presume, from holy reverence for the dead. I am waiting the report of
this jury; when that is known, you shall be advised of my movements.
At present I have decided on nothing. Write under cover to Charles
Biddle, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,.

La G. has, on a recent occasion, manifested a degree of sensibility
and attachment which have their influence on 'gamp'. Her conduct is
also highly honourable to the independence of her mind, for all her
associations and connexions would lead to a different result. An
interview is expected this evening, which, if it take place, will
terminate in something definitive.
</p><p>
It was, indeed, a pretty ludicrous description which you received. On
the other side you may add, real good-temper and cheerfulness; a good
education, according to the estimation of the world. I shall journey
somewhere within a few days, but whither is not yet decided. My heart
will travel southward, and repose on the hills of Santee.

The coroner's jury continued to the 26th (my last <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, date) to
sit and adjourn. Upon suspicion that my friends had some knowledge of
the subject, derived either from Van Ness or me, 'warrants' have
issued to bring them in to testify. Matthew L. Davis was apprehended,
and, refusing to answer, was committed to prison, where he now lies;
probably Colonel Willett is now also in jail on the same account.
Swartwout, Van Ness, and others are secreted. How long this sort of
persecution may endure cannot be conjectured.
</p><p>
The ferment, which was with so much industry excited, has subsided,
and public opinion begins to take its proper course.

The preceding is a summary of the intelligence by this day's mail. The
purport of the inquest is confirmed by a letter from J.B.P. I am
further advised that an application has been made to Governor Lewis,
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, requiring him to demand me of the governor of this state,
with which Lewis will most probably be obliged to comply. I shall,
nevertheless, remain here some days (from 8 to 20), that I may the

Your letters of the 8th and 18th of July are received; the latter

even to write. Don't let me have the idea that you are dissatisfied
with me a moment. I can't just now endure it. At another time you may
play the Juno if you please. Your letters amuse and console me.
Continue to write with this reliance, and without the expectation of
pay in kind. I owe you no thanks for a letter if you demand prompt
payment to the full amount.
</p><p>
All you write of the boy represents him such as I would have him. His
refusal of the peaches reminded me of his mother. Just so she has done
fifty times, and just so I kissed her; but then I did not give her
peaches.
</p><p>
Nothing can be done with Celeste. There is a strange indecision and
timidity which I cannot fathom. The thing, however, is abandoned; and,
for a few months, I believe, all such things.
</p><p>
I shall be here for some days. How many cannot now be resolved. I am
very well, and not without occupation or amusement. Nothing would give

usefully employed.

filled with all manner of nonsense and lies. Among other things,
accounts of attempts to assassinate me. These, I assure you, are mere

Your letter of the 25th July finds me in a moment of great occupation,
being on the point of embarking for St. Simons. Write to me on receipt
of this, and enclose to the postmaster at Darien, Georgia. The letter
to me to be addressed to A. B., at Hampton, St. Simons; and pray write
over again all you have written since the 25th, for the letters now on
the way will not be received for some time. I shall lay a plan for
meeting you somewhere, but whether I may have it in my power to visit
the high hills of Santee is doubtful; I fear improbable. They say
there is no going through the flat country at this season without
hazard of life. Consult your husband about this, and write me as above
directed. You shall hear from me the moment of my arrival anywhere;
that is, I shall write, and you may read as soon as you can get the

My plan is to visit the Floridas for five or six weeks. I have desired

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> fat and the boy pale are bad omens. For God's sake, or

We arrived on Saturday evening, all well. The mail, which arrives but
once a week, had just gone. An accidental opportunity enables me to
forward this to Savannah.
</p><p>
I am at the house of Major Butler, comfortably settled. A very
agreeable family within half a mile. My project is to go next week to
Florida, which may take up a fortnight or ten days, and soon after my
return to go northward, by Augusta and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, if I can find ways
and means to get on; but I have no horse, nor does this country
furnish one. In my letter to your husband, written at the moment of
leaving <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I desired him to name some place (healthy place)
at which he could meet me. Enclose to "Mr. R. King, Hampton, St.

St. Simon's, August 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
I am now quite settled. My establishment consists of a housekeeper,
cook, and chambermaid, seamstress, and two footmen. There are,
besides, two fishermen and four bargemen always at command. The
department of laundress is done abroad. The plantation affords plenty
of milk, cream, and butter; turkeys, fowls, kids, pigs, geese, and
mutton; fish, of course, in abundance. Of figs, peaches, and melons
there are yet a few. Oranges and pomegranates just begin to be
eatable. The house affords Madeira wine, brandy, and porter. Yesterday
my neighbour, Mr. Couper, sent me an assortment of French wines,
consisting of Claret, Sauterne, and Champagne, all excellent; and at
least a twelve months' supply of orange shrub, which makes a most
delicious punch. Madame Couper added sweetmeats and pickles. The
plantations of Butler and Couper are divided by a small creek, and the
houses within one quarter of a mile of each other; accessible,
however, only by water. We have not a fly, moscheto, or bug. I can sit
a whole evening, with open windows and lighted candles, without the
least annoyance from insects; a circumstance which I have never beheld
in any other place. I have not even seen a cockroach.
</p><p>
At Mr. Couper's, besides his family, there are three young ladies,
visitors. One of them arrived about three months ago from France, to
join a brother who had been shipwrecked on this coast, liked the
country so much that he resolved to settle here, and sent for this
sister and a younger brother. About the time of their arrival, the
elder brother was accidentally drowned; the younger went with views to
make an establishment some miles inland, where he now lies dangerously
ill. Both circumstances are concealed from the knowledge of
Mademoiselle Nicholson. In any event, she will find refuge and
protection in the benevolent house of Mr. Couper.
</p><p>
The cotton in this neighbourhood, on the coast southward to the
extremity of Florida, and northward as far as we have heard, has been
totally destroyed. The crop of Mr. C. was supposed to be worth one
hundred thousand dollars, and not an extravagant estimate, for he has
eight hundred slaves. He will not get enough to pay half the expenses
of the plantation. Yet he laughs about it with good humour and without
affectation. Butler suffers about half this loss. Part of his force
had been turned to rice. My travelling companion, secretary, and
aid-de-camp is Samuel Swartwout, the youngest brother of John, a very
amiable young man of twenty or twenty-one.
</p><p>
Now, verily, were it not for the intervention of one hundred miles of
low, swampy, pestiferous country, I would insist on your coming to see
me, all, all! Little 'gamp', and Mademoiselle Sum_tare', and their
appendages; for they are the principals.
</p><p>
I still propose to visit Florida. To set off in three or four days,
and to return hither about the 16th of September; beyond this I have
at present no plan. It is my wish, God knows how ardently I wish, to
return by land, and pass a week with you; but, being without horses,
and there being no possibility of hiring or buying, the thing seems
scarcely practicable. Two modes only offer themselves--either to
embark in the kind of mail stage which goes from Darien through
Savannah, Augusta, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, to Camden, or to take a water passage
either to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or Georgetown. Either of these being
accomplished, new difficulties will occur in getting from Statesburgh
northward. I must be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, the first week in November. Consult
your husband, and write me of these matters. Enclose to Mr. Roswell
King, which I repeat, lest my former letters should not have been
received. Our mail has just arrived, but has brought me no letter.
</p><p>
I erred a little in my history of the family of Mademoiselle N. There
are still two brothers here. One a man d'une certaine age. Though not
wealthy, they are not destitute of property.
</p><p>
Mr. C. has just now gone with his boat for the dashers who live about
thirty miles southwest on the main. He has requested me to escort
Madame C. on Sunday to his plantation on the south end of this island,
where we are to meet him and his party on Monday, and bring them home
in our coach. Madame C. is still young, tall, comely, and well bred.
</p><p>
I have been studying all the maps and gazetteers to discover the best
access to Statesburgh. Georgetown seems to be the nearest port; but
whether there be thence a direct road, I cannot discover. Does our
friend Doctor Blythe still reside at Georgetown? If so, I should
repose on him for the means of transportation. Desire Mari to write to
him to aid me in case I should take that route. If I should go to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, meaning to Sullivan's Island, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, I shall at
this season most certainly avoid, I should put myself on General
M'Pherson, who, I hear, is now living there with his family; thence up
the Cooper river, about four miles above the town, is a ferryhouse and
tavern on the north side, and thence by Strawberry, where is the best
tavern in the state, is a very direct and beautiful road, and thence,
according to the maps, a very straight road to the high hills of
Santee. But how to get from that ferryhouse is a question I cannot
resolve. All these circumstances are mentioned that I may have your
advice, meaning that of your husband. And, after all, it is possible
that I may not be able to find a passage either to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or
Georgetown, and so be obliged to sail for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. Will close this
letter, for to-morrow it must go to the postoffice at Darien, which is
only about twenty-two miles distant.
</p><p>
September 1.
</p><p>
In one of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>'s letters he spoke of taking you and A. B. A. to
the mountains; and, in a letter which I wrote him from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I
proposed to meet you in the mountains. Now, for aught which I as yet
know, it will be as easy for me to get to the mountains, or to the
Alps, or the Andes, as to Statesburgh, and therefore, as before, I

Do yon recollect the second daughter of Mr. Barclay, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,
the sister of Nelly? She has grown up the very image of her sister. I
saw her very often while I was last in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. She talked
perpetually of you, and made me promise that I would tell you so.
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. Remember that I have not received a letter
from you since that of the 22d or 25th of July. I forget which was the
date. I have no faith in the climate of your high hills, surrounded as
they are by noxious swamps. God bless and preserve thee.

St. Simon's, September 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
You see me returned from Gaston's Bluff, now called 'Hamilton's
Bluff', a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a> merchant, partner of Mr. Couper. We were four in the
carriage; the three ladies and myself.
</p><p>
Mr. Morse informs you that this island is forty-five miles long, and
that it lies north of the mouth Altamaha, commonly spelled Alatamaha.
It is, in fact, twelve and a half miles in length, and lies southeast
of that river. Its width is about two and a half miles. There are now
residing on the island about twenty-five white families. Frederica,
now known only by the name of 'Old Town', is on the west side of the
island, and about midway between its northern and southern
extremities. It was first settled by Governor Oglethorpe, and was,
about fifty years ago, a very gay place, consisting of perhaps
twenty-five or thirty houses. The walls of several of them still
remain. Three or four families only now reside here. In the vicinity
of the town several ruins were pointed out to me, as having been,
formerly, country seats of the governor, and officers of the garrison,
and gentlemen of the town. At present, nothing can be more gloomy than
what was once called Frederica. The few families now remaining, or
rather residing there, for they are all new-comers, have a sickly,
melancholy appearance, well assorted with the ruins which surround
them. The southern part of this island abounds with fetid swamps,
which must render it very unhealthy. On the northern half I have seen
no stagnant water.
</p><p>
Mr. Couper, with his escort of ladies, was to have met us this
afternoon, but he has sent us word that he is taken ill on the way;
that, owing to illness in the family of the ladies who were to have
accompanied him, they have been obliged to renounce the visit. We
therefore returned as we went. At Frederica and Gaston's Bluff we were
convinced that insects can subsist on this island. Moschetoes, flies,
and cockroaches abounded.
</p><p>
Thursday, September 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>
</p><p>
Just returned from Darien. And what took you to Darien? To see the
plantation of Mr. Butler on an island opposite that town, and to meet
a day sooner the letters which I expected from you. In the last object
I have been again disappointed, which I ascribe wholly to the
irregularity of the mails. It is most mortifying and vexatious to be
seven weeks without hearing of you or from you, and now a whole week
must elapse before I can expect it.
</p><p>
You are probably ignorant that Darien is a settlement (called a town)
on the north bank of the Alatamaha, about eight miles from its mouth.
Major Butler's Island in this river is one mile below the town. It
must become a fine rice country, for the water is fresh four miles
below Major Butler's, and the tide rises from four to five feet, and
the flats or swamps are from five to seven miles in width for a
considerable distance up the river. The country, of course, presents
no scenes for a painter. I visited Little St. Simon's and several
other islands; frightened the crocodiles, shot some rice-birds, and
caught some trout. Honey of fine flavour is found in great abundance
in the woods about the mouth of the river, and, for aught I know, in
every part of the country. You perceive that I am constantly
discovering new luxuries for my table. Not having been able to kill a
crocodile (alligator), I have offered a reward for one, which I mean
to eat, dressed in soup, fricassees, and steaks. Oh! how you long to
partake of this repast.
</p><p>
Wednesday, September 12, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
On Friday last, hearing that Mr. Couper had returned and was very
seriously ill, I took a small canoe with two boys, and went to see
him. He lay in a high fever. When about to return in the evening, the
wind had risen so that, after an ineffectual attempt, I was obliged to
give it up, and remain at Mr. C.'s. In the morning the wind was still
higher. It continued to rise, and by noon blew a gale from the north,
which, together with the swelling of the water, became alarming. From
twelve to three, several of the out-houses had been destroyed; most of
the trees about the house were blown down. The house in which we were
shook and rocked so much that Mr. C. began to express his
apprehensions for our safety. Before three, part of the piazza was
carried away; two or three of the windows bursted in. The house was
inundated with water, and presently one of the chimneys fell. Mr. C.
then commanded a retreat to a storehouse about fifty yards off, and we
decamped, men, women, and children. You may imagine, in this scene of
confusion and dismay, a good many incidents to amuse one if one had
dared to be amused in a moment of much anxiety. The house, however,
did not blow down. The storm continued till four, and then very
suddenly abated, and in ten minutes it was almost a calm. I seized the
moment to return home. Before I had got quite over, the gale rose from
the southeast and threatened new destruction. It lasted great part of
the night, but did not attain the violence of that from the north; yet
it contributed to raise still higher the water, which was the
principal instrument of devastation. The flood was about seven feet
above the height of an ordinary high tide. This has been sufficient to
inundate great part of the coast; to destroy all the rice; to carry
off most of the buildings which were on low lands, and to destroy the
lives of many blacks. The roads are rendered impassable, and scarcely
a boat has been preserved. Thus all intercourse is suspended. The
mail-boat, which ought to have passed northward last Saturday, and by
which it was intended to forward this letter, has not been heard of.
This will go by a man who will attempt to get from Darien to Savannah
on foot, being sent express by the manager of Major Butler; but how,
or whether it will go on from Savannah, is not imagined.
</p><p>
Major Butler has lost nineteen negroes (drowned), and I fear his whole
crop of rice, being about two hundred and sixty acres. Mr. Brailsford,
of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, who cultivates in rice an island at the mouth of the
Alatamaha, has lost, reports say, seventy-four blacks. The banks and
the buildings on the low lands are greatly injured. We have heard
nothing from the southward, nor farther than from Darien northward. I
greatly fear that this hurricane, so it is here called, has extended
to the Waccama.
</p><p>
The illness of Mr. C., which still continues, and the effects of the
storm, have defeated all my plans. To get to Florida seems now
impracticable; nor do any present means occur of getting from this
island in any direction. Young Swartwout, who went ten days ago to
Savannah, has not returned, nor is it possible that he should very
speedily return. I have not received a letter since my arrival from
any person north of Savannah (yes, one from C. Biddle, of 19th
August), nor do I expect one for many days to come.
</p><p>
I had taken up another sheet to say something more, I know not what;
but the appearance of a fine sheep's-head smoking on the table has
attractions not to be resisted. 'Laissez moi diner', "and then," &c.
</p><p>
_Madame j'ais bien diner', and 'j'ai fait mettre mon' writing-desk
_sur le table a diner'. What a scandalous thing to sit here all alone
drinking Champagne--and yet--(_madame je bois a votre santé et a celle
de monsieur' votre fils)--and yet, I say, if Champagne be that
exhilarating cordial which (_je bois a la santé de Madame Sumtare_)
songs and rumour ascribe to it (_a la santé de Mademoiselle Sumtare_),
can there be ever an occasion in which its application could be more
appropriate, or its virtues more (_mais buvons a la santé de mon hôte
et bon ami', Major Butler). By-the-by, you have no idea--how should
you have, seeing that you never heard a word about it?--you have no
idea, I was going to say, of the zeal and animation, of the
intrepidity and frankness with which he avowed and maintained--but I
forget that this letter goes to Savannah by a negro, who has to swim
half a dozen creeks, in one of which, 'at least', it is probable he
may drown, and that, if he escape drowning, various other accidents
may bring it to you through the newspapers, and then how many enemies
might my indiscretion create for a man who had the sensibility and the
honour to feel and to judge, and the firmness to avow (_a la santé de
Celeste un' bumper toast). 'La pauvre Celeste'. Adieu.

</p><p>
Having very unexpectedly procured a boat, I left my house yesterday
afternoon, came hither by land, and proceed in a few minutes for St.
Mary's. It is possible that I may extend my tour to St. John's, and
even to St. Augustine's; but, if so, it will be very rapid; a mere
flight, for I propose to be at home (Hampton, St. Simon's) again in
eight days.
</p><p>
On the 12th I sent by a special messenger, who was to go from Darien
to Savannah on foot, my journal for the ten or fifteen days preceding,
with some account of the hurricane; but a man this day from Darien
says that our express can by no possibility reach Savannah; for that
every bridge and causeway is destroyed, and the road so filled with
fallen trees as to be utterly impassable. I apprehend that the roads
on the whole coast as far north, at least, as Cape Hatteras, are in
the same condition. If on my return I should receive intelligence
confirming those apprehensions, it will compel me to abandon the hope
of seeing you until the last of February. On this, as on all other
occasions, let me find that you exhibit the firmness which I have been
proud to ascribe to you. Let me hear that you are seriously engaged in
some useful pursuit. Let me see the progressive improvement of your
mind, and it will console me for all the evils of life.
</p><p>
My young friend Swartwout is still absent, and I suppose at Savannah.
It is not probable that I shall see him again before my return to

write you. I promise myself much gratification in this little trip. If
an opportunity should offer for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, by water, I shall venture a
letter to you. This will be forwarded before my return; if not, it
will lay here. I am writing to you before sunrise, and am now summoned

</p><p>
I returned yesterday from my Florida excursion, about which I wrote
you on the 15th inst. The weather prevented me from going farther than
the river St. John's, about thirty miles from St. Augustine. I have
been making out for you a journal of my tour, but I still entertain a
slight hope of seeing you somewhere within a fortnight; if at all, it
will be by the 10th of October. Pray keep yourselves in readiness to
meet me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, or still more southward if I should require it.
</p><p>
Not a line from you or your husband since those of the 25th of July.
Your letters have either been lost in the hurricane or are now in the
mail-boat, which, by some mistake, has brought down the Darien mail
and carried it on more southward, so that it will not reach Darien
till I am off; yet I entertain a hope of finding letters at Savannah.
</p><p>
A boat has at length been found to take me to Savannah, and thither I
go to-morrow, or rather set out, for I shall not reach it till the
30th instant. What course I shall take thence will be determined by
what I may hear at that city. You will have a line from me as soon as
I arrive there; meaning always that the line will be written, and sent
on by the first mail, to get to you as soon as it can.
</p><p>
It is a fact that the Spanish ladies smoke segars. They say that a
young lady will take a few puffs and hand it to her favoured lover as
a mark of great kindness. This rumour, however, I cannot verify from
personal observation, much less have I to boast of any such favour.
But we will talk of these things if we should meet; if not, we will
write about them.

I was treated with great kindness and respect at St. Mary's, and have
everywhere experienced the utmost hospitality. My health has been

Savannah, October 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>. Ten o'clock A.M., arrived in a storm
(northeast). They had last evening a minor hurricane here, for the
special use of this city. It overset some canoes, drowned a few
negroes, unroofed some houses, and forced in a few windows. It was the
affair of a few minutes, confined to a small space, and did no other
mischief that I learn.
</p><p>
My last letter to you was from St. Simon's, about the 27th ult., the
day previous to my departure. My voyage hither was full of variety,
and not of the most pleasant kind, but no accident to affect health.
My first reflection on landing was that I was one hundred miles nearer
to you; but my inquiries since my arrival afford no prospect of
getting on by land, except by the purchase of horses, to which there
is one insuperable objection. The condition of the roads has not yet
admitted of travelling northward or westward in a carriage. The mail
goes on horseback.
</p><p>
Not a line from any creature north of this place since I left
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. I hear, however, that the Darien mail, which I passed at
Frederica, as mentioned with vexation in my last, had letters for me,
doubtless from you.
</p><p>
I was kindly interrupted in these idle regrets by visitors, who
continued in succession till dinner was announced. At the
lodging-house, where rooms were provided for me, were the governor, a
Scotch merchant, and a sea captain. In the evening a band of music
came under the window, which I supposed to be a compliment to the
governor, till one of the gentlemen who accompanied it came in and
said that a number of citizens at the door wished to see the
vice-president. Interrupted again.
</p><p>
Tuesday, October 2.
</p><p>
Firstly, your pardon is craved for this torn sheet; it was entire when
I commenced, but one half went last night to answer a note, there
being no paper in the house, and Peter abroad with my key. You have
not, I think, been introduced to Peter, my 'now' valet. It is a black
boy purchased last fall. An intelligent, good-tempered, willing
fellow, about fifteen; a dirty, careless dog, who, with the best
intentions, is always in trouble by sins of omission or commission.
The latter through inadvertence, and often through excess of zeal.
About three times a day, sometimes oftener, I get angry enough to
choke him, but his honesty and good-nature prevail. In my will, made
about the 10th of July, I recommend him to you as valet to A.B.A.
</p><p>
I have been this morning scouring the town and the docks in quest of
ways and means to get on. There is a packet which will sail for
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, on Saturday; a great way off to one so impatient as the
writer of this. No stage nor a horse to be hired. Finding that the
mail does not close till seven this evening, this letter shall be kept
open till the last moment, and shall not be closed till I have settled
some plan of getting forward, either to Statesburgh or <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. It
will, I think, be Statesburgh. Six hours hence you shall know. Have
patience, my dear child, for six hours.
</p><p>
Lest I should forget it, let me now tell you that I am received with
the warmest hospitality. Notwithstanding the desolation occasioned by
the hurricane (and it is truly distressing), I have invitations which
it would require weeks to satisfy. These attentions are almost
exclusively from republicans.
</p><p>
Four o'clock P. M.
</p><p>
_Io triumphe!' A letter; two, three letters. Two from you and one from
your husband. Since writing I have had other good luck; 'viz'., two
gentlemen have offered me each an excellent horse to go as far as
Statesburgh by any route I may please. Another horse, and I am made.
Note, my young friend Swartwout is with me, and I cannot well part
with him. If another horse shall be found, I shall take the route
through Orangeburgh, as being the most direct to Statesburgh. If the
land route shall for any reason be found impracticable, I shall take
possession of a <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, packet, and perhaps take it on to
Georgetown. By one way or the other you shall see me within ten or
twelve days. Tell Mari that his letter being received this afternoon,
and the postmaster having just now sent me word that the mail is about
to close, I can only answer him thus.
</p><p>
You are now to keep your ground and expect me at the hills. Pray let
A.B.A. know that 'gamp' is a black man, otherwise he may be shocked at
the appearance of A.B., who is now about the colour of Peter Yates.
Not brown, but a true quadroon yellow; whether from the effects of
climate, or travelling four hundred miles in a canoe, is no matter.

show you how such books could be made without facts or ideas. My first
four days, to wit, from Statesburgh to this place, would, I find, from

</p><p>
We parted at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>. The morning following I started one hour
before day, the moon showing us the way, and, at about seven or eight
in the evening, was at Raleigh, being full fifty miles. It was a hard
day's journey, and greater than will be made again on this trip. The
fatigues of the day were in some measure compensated by the very
hospitable reception which I met from the 'negroes' of the capital of
North Carolina. I reposed till nine the next morning, and came the
next day only to Louisburgh (twenty-nine miles), where I slept in the
little up-stairs room which you once occupied; but there is a new
landlord. The Jew is broke up. The wind had been two days strong at
northeast, threatening a storm, and raining a little from time to
time. Last night it came on in earnest, raining and blowing
vehemently. So I lay abed again till nine, and, after breakfasting for
two hours, set off at eleven in all the storm. At twelve it began to
snow, and continued to snow most plentifully till night. The ground
looked like the depth of winter in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>. Poor Andrew was almost
perished; and 'gamp's' hands were nearly frozen; still we kept on, and
got here about five, being twenty-five miles. It will take me full
three days more to reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and perhaps longer, for the roads
are so gullied as to be barely passable. This afternoon, stopping at a
tavern and calling for the hostler, the man told me that, 'foreseeing_
the storm, he had sent him for a load of wood.
</p><p>
A gentleman who passed here yesterday says he left Major Butler on the
way, going to Georgia by land. When I sat down to write my head was
full of totally different matters; but, having gone on so far with
road incidents, the other concerns must be omitted.
</p><p>
My landlord has just been telling me that Swartwout passed here eight
days ago. They were three in the stage, all very apprehensive of being
overset, as they were to start at two in the morning. In the excess of
caution, they desired the landlord to give no rum to the driver. The
landlord promised, and gave orders to the barkeeper. When the driver
arrived, he called for a dram; was refused, and told the reason.
Resenting this indignity, he swore he would get drunk; went to a
store, bought rum, and got drunk. Set out at two, and overset the
stage the first hour. The passengers were bruised, but not very
seriously injured.

I came here on the morning of the 29th, intending to stay two hours.
The hospitalities of the place have detained me three days. A party
was prepared for me on the evening of my arrival. There were present
between fifty and sixty, all pure republican. An invitation from the
republican citizens, communicated through the mayor, to a public
dinner, was made in terms and in a manner which could not be declined.
We had the dinner yesterday at the hotel. In the evening I was
attended by some fifteen or twenty to the theatre, where I was greatly
amused, particularly by Mrs. West, whom I think the best female
actress in America, not excepting Mrs. Merry.

I send you a collection of Curran's speeches, compiled, however, only

been very pleasant; but why and wherefore cannot now be told, because

To think of meeting with such an actress as Mrs. West in such a place.
Her voice is as sweet as Mrs. Merry's (the actress, not the other Mrs.
Merry), her manners superior. In comedy she is unequalled. They say
she excites equally in tragedy. I have no doubt but she is good at
every thing. I could make you laugh at a ridiculous embarrassment, but
I won't; nay, I dare not, for who knows but you may first see this in
the newspaper. Madam, this is Colonel B., V.P.U.S., all out loud. Sir,
this is Mrs.-----. Miss, this is, &c., &c. The players stand, and the

I arrived last evening. You will have received my two letters of the
30th ult. and 1st instant, communicating, among other things, some
information which I received on the road respecting the feelings in
Bergen county, New-Jersey. Since that a grand jury has been
_empannelled', who have found an indictment of murder. The witness,
Parson Mason. The presiding judge, Boudinot, one of the most vehement
of vehement federalists. The particulars shall be communicated as soon
as I can find time to write them; they will furnish you with new
materials for reflection. They talk of making a demand here.
</p><p>
My house and furniture have been sold for about twenty-five thousand
dollars. Seven or eight thousand dollars of debts remain unpaid. My
agents have not collected any of my debts, nor sold any of the
detached lots. The library and the wine remain. They will, I think,
become your property.

Shall I write to her to-night, or omit it till to-morrow? Oh!
to-night, dear pappy. Well, then, to-night it shall be--'Je vous
ecris parceque je n'ai rien a faire'," &c. That's not true; fifty
unanswered letters on my table pronounce it false.
</p><p>
But when I deliberated about writing, it was with a view to write you
sense--grave sense. What a dull thing is sense. How it mars half the
pleasure of life, and yet how contemptible is all that has it not. Too
much sense, by which I mean only a great deal, is very troublesome to
the possessor and to the world. It is like one carrying a huge pack
through a crowd. He is constantly hitting and annoying somebody, and
is, in turn, annoyed and jostled by every one, and he must be a very
powerful man indeed if he can keep upright and force his way. Now
there appears to me to be but two modes of carrying this pack with any
tolerable comfort to the owner.
</p><p>
Interrupted. A very extraordinary visit; you shall hear as soon as
they go.
</p><p>
The visitors were a middle-aged gentleman; a man of fortune, of
family; has travelled, and been received in the first circles on both
continents; intelligent and well-informed; prompt, rapid, and
decisive. A high federalist, yet a warm and open friend of 'gamp' on
all occasions. Reputed to be insane, of which this attachment may be
deemed an evidence. Such is Mr. Y. The other, Mr. S., a very handsome,
genteel young man, who never carried a pack. They sat two hours, and
Mr. Y. was not only rational, but amusing. The only evidence of
insanity which I have heard is that he quarrels with his dear 'rib';
and if this be deemed evidence, I fear our madhouses will soon be
filled with married men. I ought to have excepted one incident, which
has been related to me as follows:----
</p><p>
Mr. R., a young lawyer of reputable connexions, but who had committed
some follies, called to visit Mr. Y. After sitting some time, "Mr.
R.," says Y., "it has been reported that you are a little deranged in
mind (there had, in fact, been such a report), and I have heard that
whipping has been found a sovereign remedy; indeed, in the case of the
King of England, its benefit was manifest. Now as I have a very great
regard for you, and doubt whether your friends will take the trouble
of administering this discipline, I will take it on myself to do it."
</p><p>
Two stout negroes were called in. The astonished R. was seized,
stripped, and tied, and most unmercifully whipped. All, however, with
the utmost composure on the part of Y., and mingled with expressions
of kindness. When R. was taken down, bloody, lacerated, and
exhausted--"Pray, sir, walk in and take a dish of tea." "No; d---n
you." "But, as you must be somewhat fatigued with the exercise,
perhaps you would prefer some brandy and water." R. walked sullenly
off, and, as soon as he had recovered, left the neighbourhood, and has
not since been heard of.
</p><p>
But by this digression we have lost sight of the pack. The further
discussion of that subject must be reserved for the "Book of Travels."
The "grave sense" is still further off, and must wait a more fit
occasion. As you are skilled in ancient mythology, I pray you to
inform me whether there was ever a goddess of nonsense. A god won't
serve my purpose. Momus, for instance, is a loud, boisterous, rude,
coarse fellow.
</p><p>
Leave off the 'vice-president', &c., in the direction of your letters.
Let it be simply A.B. or Colonel B. Tell Mari so.

You have doubtless heard that there has subsisted for some time a
contention of a very singular nature between the states of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,
and New-Jersey. To what lengths it may go, or how it may terminate,
cannot be predicted; but, as you will take some interest in the
question, I will state it for your satisfaction and consideration.
</p><p>
The subject in dispute is which shall have the honour of hanging the
vice-president. I have not now the leisure to state the various
pretensions of the parties, with the arguments on either side; nor is
it yet known that the vice-president has made his election, though a
paper received this morning asserts, but without authority, that he
had determined in favour of the <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, tribunals. You shall have due
notice of the time and place. Whenever it may be, you may rely on a
great concourse of company, much gayety, and many rare sights; such as
the lion, the elephant, &c.
</p><p>
On the subject of books, since I shall write to you only by this mail,
tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> to order out from his bookseller the British Critic
and the Edinburgh Review from their commencement, and to be continued
as they shall come out. To form a library is the work of time, and by
having these books you may select and give orders without danger of
imposition; for though I disclaim much reliance on the judgments of
the editors, yet from their extracts and remarks a pretty correct
opinion may be formed. I recommend also that you prohibit the sending
out of any folio or quarto, unless particularly ordered. Octavo is at
about half the price, and much more convenient.
</p><p>
I hope you read Quintilian in the original, and not in translation;
and let me entreat you not to pass a word or sentence without
understanding it. If I hear a very good account of you, Stuart shall
make a picture to please you. God bless thee.

The trial of Judge Chace will not come on before the middle of
January. He is summoned to appear the 2d January. I regret extremely
that you cannot be present.
</p><p>
Biddle and Dallas have written a joint letter to Governor Bloomfield,
of New-Jersey, urging a nol. pros. in the case of the vice-president.
Dallas has, throughout this business, behaved with an independence,
and open, active zeal which I could not have expected, and to which I
had no personal claim.
</p><p>
The leading republican members of the United States Senate have
addressed a similar joint letter to the governor. Many individuals of
the same 'sect' co-operate in the measure, and have expressed their
opinions by letter and in conversation. Nothing final and favourable
will promptly be done. On the other hand, nothing hostile will be
attempted. I enclose you the articles of impeachment against Judge
Chace, as agreed upon.

Being the last time I shall write <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>. Now, how much wiser or better
are we than this time last year? Have our enjoyments for that period
been worth the trouble of living? These are inquiries not wholly

You would laugh to know the occupation of my New Year's eve. It cannot

</p><p>
I propose to move my quarters to-morrow, and the confusion has already
commenced, and even pervades this letter. Mrs. Merry arrived a few
days ago, and looks extremely well. Madame Turreau is supposed to be
lost or captured. Mr. Chace's trial will not come on till after the
middle of January. Peter Van Ness, the father of General John P., died
on the 23d instant. He has left his sons about forty thousand dollars
apiece.
</p><p>
Madame, when I enclose you a book or paper, be pleased, at least, to
let me know that you or your husband have read it. Pretty business,
indeed, for me to be spending hours in cutting and folding pamphlets
and papers for people who, perhaps, never open them. Heaven mend you.

mean Celeste. That matter shall receive its final decision. Now, to
confess the truth, which, however, I have but just discovered, but for

truth suspected by the hundreds who are at this moment 'ascribing to

So greatly do I differ from the author, that I have desired a friend
to buy them up and burn them. I shall return to this city on the 29th.

Your letter of the 1st of January found me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and at the
moment of leaving it. Your kind wishes came so warm from the heart,
that, in a journey of eight hundred miles, at this inclement season,
they had not yet cooled.
</p><p>
You treat with too much gravity the New-Jersey affair. It should be
considered as a farce, and you will yet see it terminated so as to
leave only ridicule and contempt to its abettors. The affair of
Celeste is for ever closed, so there is one trouble off hand.
</p><p>
After you get through the book you are now reading, which I think is
Anacharsis, or is it Gibbon? you better suspend history till you have
gone through B. You do wrong to read so slow the first reading of B. I
had rather you went through it like a novel, to get fixed in your mind
a kind of map of the whole; after which, when you come to read
_scientifically', you would better see the relations and bearings of
one part to another. In all journeys, whether on foot or on horseback,
it is a relief to know not only where you start from, but where you
are going to, and all the intermediate stages. I beg that in every
letter you will give me one line about B., and ask me questions if you
please.

I regret the unprofitable employment of your time, and sincerely hope

know that without it you will become unfit for the duties, as well as
the enjoyments of life. Perhaps, also, my vanity may be something
concerned.
</p><p>
Your last letters are written with more correctness, and apparently
with more attention than is your habit. They have amused and pleased
me much. By pleased, I mean gratified my pride. Your critical remarks
are quite interesting. I advise you, as soon as you have finished a
play, novel, pamphlet, or book, immediately to write an account and
criticism of it. You can form no idea how much such a work will amuse
you on perusal a few years hence. When A.B.A. has got so far as to
read stories of the most simple kind, the least pleasing part of his
intellectual education is finished. I might, perhaps, have added with
truth, the most laborious part.

Still lingering here, being detained by some trifling, important
concerns of business, for trifles are important in matters of finance;
nothing vexatious, however. That, I hope and believe, is past.
</p><p>
Your anxieties about me evince a sort of sickly sensibility, which
indicates that you are not well. I fear that you are suffering a
debility, arising from climate or other cause, which affects both mind
and body. When you are in health you have no sort of solicitude or
apprehension about me; you confide that, under any circumstances, I am
able to fulfil your expectations and your wishes. Resume, I pray you,
this confidence, so flattering to me, so consoling to yourself, may I
add, so justly founded?
</p><p>
On the 13th I shall leave this for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. There is no reason to
think that I shall this season visit either <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, or New-Jersey.
The plan of summer operations is to go from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, to Fort Pitt
(<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>,), thence through the states on each side of the Ohio. To
visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, and the mouth of the Missouri; thence through
Tennessee (where pass a month) to Orleans; and thence, either by water
or land, to the Atlantic coast, not far from Yarnaco or the mouth of
the Waccama. Thus you see that you are the end of all plans, and,
wherever they may begin, the termination is the same. This tour has
other objects than mere curiosity. An operation of business, which
promises to render the tour both useful and agreeable. I may be at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, long enough to receive your answer to this, after which
you must 'surcease' from writing till further advice. You will hear of
me occasionally on my route. Write now, therefore, all you have to
say.
</p><p>
Just at the moment of writing the last word I receive a message from
the president informing me that Dr. Browne may have the office of
secretary of the government of Louisiana (which means the upper
district, whereof <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, is the capital). General Wilkinson is
appointed governor of that territory. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, is on the banks of the
Mississippi, about twenty miles below the mouth of the Missouri. It
contains about two hundred houses, and some very wealthy people. The
inhabitants are French; retain the French manners of the last century;
are said to be hospitable; gay to dissipation; the society polished
and fashionable. All accounts represent the country as remarkably
healthy, fertile, and beautiful. The salary of secretary is, I think,
but eight hundred dollars per annum. Certain contingences, however,
will make it worth about double that sum. Wilkinson and Browne will
suit most admirably as eaters and laughers, and, I believe, in all
other particulars.

Charles Williamson has not returned from Europe, but is hourly

The enclosed newspaper is just now put into my hands. It is true, as
is there said, that I made a talk, as was decent and proper, to the
Senate on leaving them formally. There was nothing written or
prepared, except that it had been some days on my mind to say
something. It was the solemnity, the anxiety, the expectation, and the
interest which I saw strongly painted in the countenances of the
auditors, that inspired whatever was said. I neither shed tears nor
assumed tenderness; but tears did flow abundantly. The story in this
newspaper is rather awkwardly and pompously told. It has been gathered
up, I presume, from different relations of the facts. This newspaper
(_The Washington Federalist_) has been for months past, and, for aught
I know (for I read none of them), still is, one of the most abusive
against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>. I am told that several papers lately make some

The enclosed paper will show you what is doing here. The subject of

I am not wholly free from apprehension that you take no interest in
any thing but a rice-field. Fame says that you are about to degenerate

Though in my former letters I did not, in express terms, inform you
that I was under ostracism, yet it must have been inferred. Such is
the fact. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, I am to be disfranchised, and in New-Jersey
hanged. Having substantial objections to both, I shall not, for the

not go; but one younger than Susan, whose name I forget. Miss Dallas

to the bar: no fortune, but said to possess talents. Poor La R. quite
pale and emaciated; the fruit of dissipation. Celeste as heretofore,
abating the influence of time, which is a little too visible;

People who are occupied are never dull, never melancholy. I learn,
then, from your letter of the 10th, that you have been a little lazy.
To be sure, if that letter was written for publication, it would do
credit to the author; but to me, 'en particulier', other reflections
might have occurred. The story, however, is prettily told, and I kiss
your hand for some other pretty things. But let me see more of the
effects of those precepts and that example.
</p><p>
I am apprehensive that your milk diet will not carry you through the
summer. You will want stimulus of some kind. For this purpose
something is used in all warm countries. In the West Indies they drink
rum and they die. In the East Indies and China, ginseng is the
panacea. Try ginseng. Some decoction or (bitter) infusion. When my
stomach is out of order or wants tone, nothing serves so effectually
as a cup of chamomile tea, without sugar or milk. I think this would
give you an appetite. Make the experiment. Bathing in seawater is a
grand preservative. If your bath be in the house, the best time is an
hour or two before dinner. Tepid bath; none of your cold baths for
such a machine as yours. If you have no convenience for a warm bath in
the house, set a mason to work to-morrow and make one in each of your
country houses. It is a high evidence of the barbarism of our Southern
states that, in an extent of three hundred miles, filled with wealthy
people, and in a hot climate, there should not be, in any one private
family, a convenient bathing-room. Perhaps, indeed, some ruined French
refugee may have expended fifty dollars to furnish himself and family
this luxury, as essential to comfort and cleanliness as to health.
</p><p>
In ten or twelve days I shall be on my way westward. My address, till
further orders, is at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, to the care of the Hon. John
Smith. As the objects of this journey, not mere curiosity, or 'pour
passer le tems', may lead me to Orleans, and perhaps farther. I
contemplate the tour with gayety and cheerfulness. The most weighty
solicitude on my mind is your health and that of your boy. My letters
have given you some advice as to yourself. You will have a letter from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, and from other points as opportunities may offer, though I

I rejoice that your nerves are in better tone, for truly, in some of
your letters, I could scarcely recognise my daughter. As to the boy, I
beseech you not to undertake to teach him the various sounds of the
letters abstractedly from the words in which those sounds are found.
This must be learned arbitrarily. Go on with his a, b, &c.; and when
he shall have learned the language, and not till then, can you teach
him (or ought it to be attempted) the principles of the construction
of that language.

My ostracism is enlivened by a constant succession of visitors from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and New-Jersey. Swartwout and Bunner have just now come in,
and I have not been a day without some 'one, two', or more. They stay
generally two or three days with me, and I am privileged to take them
with me wherever I dine. Major Powell, the friend of Miss Keene, and
the lover of her mother, returned lately from Europe and died here
last week. He has left an estate of ten or twelve thousand guineas per
annum.
</p><p>
I met Miss Sumter (overtook meaning) at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wilmington" rel="city">Wilmington</a>, last winter, and
thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, we rode together in the stage. She is a frank,
sensible, amiable girl. May make a very interesting companion. I was
so much pleased with her, that I went several times to see her (two
miles), though I visited no lady. I took her to General Van Ness's,
where I made her at home. She plays on the piano in a style which may
be called superior, and has a most uncommon fine voice, which has been
neglected.

Arrived in good order yesterday. Find my boat and hands ready. The
water high and weather fine. Shall set off in two hours. Have
therefore no time to give any account of my journey hither. My boat
is, properly speaking, a floating house, sixty feet by fourteen,
containing dining-room, kitchen with fireplace, and two bedrooms;
roofed from stem to stern; steps to go up, and a walk on the top the
whole length; glass windows, &c. This edifice costs one hundred and
thirty-three dollars, and how it can be made for that sum passes my

</p><p>
My journal has grown too big to be sent by mail. I have, therefore,
only to assure you of my health and safety, without entering into any
of those details which you will see anon. Shaw is with me. To-morrow
we pursue our journey by land to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, in Tennessee, and thence
down the Cumberland to Eddyville, where we expect to find our boat,
and intend to go from that place to Orleans in ten days.
</p><p>
Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, on the 29th of May. "One is astonished at the
number of sensible, well-informed, and well behaved people which is
found here. I have been received with much hospitality and kindness,
and could stay a month with pleasure; but General <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Andrew Jackson</a>.
having provided us a boat, we shall set off on Sunday, the 2d of June,
to navigate down the Cumberland, either to Smithland at its mouth, or
to Eddyville, sixty or eighty miles above, at one of which places we
expect to find our boat, with which we intend to make a rapid voyage
down the Mississippi to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and Orleans.
</p><p>Left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, on the 3d of June in an open boat. Came down the
Cumberland to its mouth, about 220 miles, in an open boat, where our
ark was in waiting. Reached Massac, on the Ohio, sixteen miles below,
on the 6th. Here found General Wilkinson on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>,. The
general and his officers fitted me out with an elegant barge, sails,
colours, and ten oars, with a sergeant, and ten able, faithful hands.
Thus equipped, I left Massac on the 10th of June, Shaw in company.
</p><p>On the 17th arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, being by water, as estimated, nearly
eight hundred miles from Massac. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, is a town of three or four
hundred houses; the inhabitants traders and mechanics, but surrounded
by wealthy planters, among whom I have been entertained with great
hospitality and taste. These planters are, many of them, men of
education and refinement; live as well as yours, and have generally
better houses. We are now going through a settled country, and, during
the residue of my voyage to Orleans, about three hundred miles, I
shall take breakfast and dinner each day at the house of some
gentleman on shore. I take no letters of introduction; but, whenever I
hear of any gentleman whose acquaintance or hospitalities I should
desire, I send word that I am coming to see him, and have always met a
most cordial reception.
</p><p>Edward Livingston was married about a fortnight ago to Madame Moreau,
_veuve', lately from St. Domingo, rich in beauty and accomplishments.
I hear so many pleasant things of Orleans, that I should certainly (if
one half of them are verified on inspection) settle down there were it
not for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and her boy; but these will control my fate.
</p><p>On the 25th of June reached New-Orleans. The lady of your laughing
friend is a charming woman. She was a widow from St. Domingo; 'sans
argent et sans enfants'. Without a single good feature, she is very
agreeable. She is nearly the size and figure of Lady Nesbet. Fair,
pale, with jet black hair and eyes--little, sparkling black eyes,
which seem to be made for far other purposes than those of mere
vision. Ph. Jones is to be married in a few days to a pretty little
American, Miss Brown. The inhabitants of the United States are here
called Americans. I have been received with distinction.
</p><p>The mark of attention with which I have been most flattered is a
letter from the holy sisters, the Ursuline nuns, congratulating me on
my arrival. Having returned a polite answer to this letter, it was
intimated to me that the saints had a desire to see me. The bishop
conducted me to the cloister. We conversed at first through the
grates; but presently I was admitted within, and I passed an hour with
them greatly to my satisfaction. None of that calm monotony which I
expected. All was gayety, 'wit', and sprightliness. Saint A. is a very
accomplished lady. In manners and appearance a good deal like Mrs.
Merry. All, except two, appear to be past thirty. They were dressed
with perfect neatness; their veils thrown back. We had a repast of
wine, fruit, and cakes. I was conducted to every part of the building.
All is neatness, simplicity, and order. At parting, I asked them to
remember me in their prayers, which they all promised with great
promptness and courtesy--Saint A. with earnestness.
</p><p>This city is larger than I expected, and there are found many more
than would be supposed living in handsome style. They are cheerful,
gay, and easy. I have promised to return here next fall. I go on the
10th instant (July) by land to Kentucky, and thence, probably, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>,. 'A la santé Madame' Alston, is generally the first toast at
every table I have been. Then we say some evil things of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>.
_Encore', adieu. I will ask Saint A. to pray for thee too. I believe
much in the efficacy of her prayers. 'Le pauvre' A.B.A., I can find
nothing here to send him.
</p><p>Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, on the 6th August. You now see me safe through
the wilderness, though I doubt (hussey) whether you knew that I had a
wilderness to pass in order to get here. Yes, about four hundred and
fifty miles of wilderness. The hospitality of these people will keep
me here till the 12th instant, when I shall partake of a public
dinner, given not to the vice-president, but to A.B. I shall be at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, on the 19th. I have directed Bradley's new map of the United
States to be sent to you; this will enable you to trace my route, and
I pray you to study the map attentively.
</p><p>I am still at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, (August 13th). For a week I have been
lounging at the house of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">General Jackson</a>., once a lawyer, after a
judge, now a planter; a man of intelligence, and one of those prompt,
frank, ardent souls whom I love to meet. The general has no children,
but two lovely nieces made a visit of some days, contributed greatly
to my amusement, and have cured me of all the evils of my wilderness
jaunt. If I had time I would describe to you these two girls, for they
deserve it. To-morrow I move on towards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>,.
</p><p>I ought to tell you how I came hither. It was thus: I embarked in a
little schooner at the mouth of the Bayou St. Jean on Lake
Ponchartrain, and landed on the opposite side of the lake about ten
miles below the mouth of the Chefonti, a traverse of about twenty-five
miles, which I made in six hours. Took a guide, and went on next
morning in a footpath; crossed the Chefonti about four miles above its
mouth, and then turned northerly; crossed the 31st degree of latitude
at forty-two miles from the Mississippi. Note; this line has been
actually run, and marked with great accuracy by commissioners on the
part of the United States and of Spain, as the north bound of the
Floridas and the south bound of the United States, till it strikes the
St. Mary's. You will see on the map. Continued on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>,. From the
mouth of the Chefonti to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, by this route is about one hundred
and forty miles. I was four days from New-Orleans to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>,. Passed
near a week in the vicinity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and saw some tears of regret
when I left it; but I am 'now' to give you the route; my journal will
give you the incidents.
</p><p>The path from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, going northward, keeps east of the Yazoo, and,
I think, nearly on the dividing ridge between the waters of the Yazoo
and those of the Tombigbee or Tambeckbee; a vile country, destitute of
springs and of running water--think of drinking the nasty
puddle-water, covered with green scum, and full of animalculae--bah! I
crossed the Tennessee; how glad I was to get on the waters of the
Tennessee; all fine, transparent, lively streams, and itself a clear,
beautiful, magnificent river. I crossed it, I say, forty miles below
the muscle shoals, and three hundred and sixty above its mouth,
reckoning by the meanders of the river. Thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, through
the town of Franklin. On the map you will see laid down a road from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, as having been cut by the order of the minister
of war. This is imaginary; there is no such road.
</p><p>Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, on the 20th August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>. Left it for Frankfort,
distant twenty-two miles, on the 31st. I am magnificently lodged at
the house of John Brown, who married your old friend and neighbour
Miss Mason, who is, you know, the sister of 'my friend', the priest
(John Mason). She has two fine boys; the youngest, now four, I find
something like A.B.A., and, of course, amuse myself with him a great
deal. Mrs. Brown is still handsome, and speaks of you with attachment
and respect.
</p><p>My plans for the two next months are now made up, or rather imposed
on me by letters received since I last wrote you, and by my previous
engagements. On the 1st of September I leave this for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>,. My
route is to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, 55 miles; Vincennes, on the Wabash, 150 miles;
Kaskaskias, on the Mississippi, 150 miles; <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, 75 miles. These
distances are probably inaccurate, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, is called 450 miles
from this. I propose to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, on the 1st of October; at
Chilicothe and Marietta from the 7th to the 15th; at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, about
the 20th, and at Bedford till the 1st of November. If by that time I
should hear nothing from you, shall take measures for going by land or
water to Theoville, so that you see it must be late in November before
I can see you.
</p><p>Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, (Falls of the Ohio) on the 2d of September,
being sixty miles on my way to the Missouri. I have now again one
hundred and fifty miles of wilderness to encounter. I will be at
Berkeley Springs by the 20th of October, where I hope to meet you and
Mari. Address to me at the city of Washington."

</p><p>
I came to Berkeley as was proposed. You were not there; no letter from
you. I sent a messenger to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a> for intelligence, and
waited his return in unpleasant suspense. At the termination of six
days my messenger returned with letters advising that you would be at
Hillsborough, whither I resolved immediately to go, but thought it
best to take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> in my way, in the hope of other letters. You
were all at the Oaks, and no movement spoken of. You were to go alone
to the legislature. Wife and child to be left at the Oaks.
</p><p>
Though oppressed with important engagements, I would nevertheless set
off with the stage of this day for Georgetown and the Oaks if I could
have been assured of finding preparations ready made for the
contemplated journey of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and the boy; but as you may have
left home without attending to this point, it seemed probable that I
might make a fruitless journey of nine hundred miles; fruitless,
except the pleasure of passing one day at the Oaks, and even this with
the alloy of your absence. My course will, therefore, be now to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where I have made appointments, and either at that place
or this shall wait your reply, and we must endeavour to arrange our
plans with precision. Address me at this place.
</p><p>
My solicitude about the health of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> is no way relieved by the
sort of recovery of which she advises me. The boy, too, has a relapse
of the ague, a disease of all others the most fatal to the infant
constitution. Great God! what sacrifices do you make, and to what end?
These solicitudes poison all my enjoyments, and often unfit me for
business. Being apprized from recollection of our personal
communications last autumn, and of our correspondence last winter, of
the engagements and ties which will prevent you, at least for some
months, from leaving South Carolina, I determine, at any sacrifice, to
rescue <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and son.
</p><p>
There will be no war with Spain unless we shall declare it, which is
not expected. England continues a course of malevolence, which will
still continue and be borne. France, more courteous in words, under
the pressure of her own affairs. Affectionately,

</p><p>My military escort having arrived at Fredericksburgh on our way to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, there met a special messenger, with orders to convey me to
this place. Hither we came forthwith, and arrived last evening. It
seems that here the business is to be tried and concluded. I am to be
surrendered to the civil authority to-morrow, when the question of
bail will be determined. In the mean time I remain at the Eagle
tavern."
</p><p>April 26, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>Your letters of the 10th and those preceding seemed to indicate a
sort of stupor; but now you rise into phrensy. Another ten days will,
it is hoped, have brought you back to reason. It ought not, however,
to be forgotten that the letter of the 15th was written under a
paroxysm of the toothache.
</p><p>You have read to very little purpose if you have not remarked that
such things happen in all democratic governments. Was there in Greece
or Rome a man of virtue and independence, and supposed to possess
great talents, who was not the object of vindictive and unrelenting
persecution? Now, madame, I pray you to amuse yourself by collecting
and collating all the instances to be found in ancient history, which
you may connect together, if you please, in an essay, with
reflections, comments, and applications. This I may hope to receive
about the 22d of May. I promise myself great pleasure in the perusal,
and I promise you great satisfaction and consolation in the
composition."
</p><p>May 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>Respecting the approaching investigation, I can communicate nothing
new. The grand jury is composed of twenty democrats and four
federalists. Among the former is W. C. Nicholas, my vindictive and
avowed personal enemy--the most so that could be found in this state
(Virginia).
</p><p>
The most indefatigable industry is used by the agents of government,
and they have money at command without stint. If I were possessed of
the same means, I could not only foil the prosecutors, but render them
ridiculous and infamous. The democratic papers teem with abuse against
me and my counsel, and even against the chief justice. Nothing is left
undone or unsaid which can tend to prejudice the public mind, and
produce a conviction without evidence. The machinations of this
description which were used against Moreau in France were treated in
this country with indignation. They are practised against me in a
still more impudent degree, not only with impunity, but with applause;
and the authors and abettors suppose, with reason, that they are
acquiring favour with the administration."
</p><p>June 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>Still waiting for Wilkinson, and no certain accounts of his approach.
The grand jury, the witnesses, and the country grow impatient. It is
an ungracious thing, and so deemed, after having for six months been
branded as a traitor; after directing that Burr and his followers
should be attacked, put to death, and their property seized; after all
the violations of law and constitution which have been practised, that
government should now say it has not proof!
</p><p>Busy, busy, busy from morning till night--from night till morning,
yet there are daily amusing incidents; things at which you will laugh,
also things at which you will pout and scold."
</p><p>June 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>On Saturday morning General Wilkinson, with ten or eleven witnesses
from New Orleans, arrived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. Four bills were immediately
delivered to the grand jury against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend colleague">Blennerhassett</a> and Burr; one for
treason and one for misdemeanour against each. The examination of the
witnesses was immediately commenced. They had gone through thirty-two
last evening. There are about forty-six. General Eaton has been
already examined. He came out of the jury-room in such rage and
agitation that he shed tears, and complained bitterly that he had been
questioned as if he were a villain. How else could he have been
questioned with any propriety?
</p><p>Poor Bollman is placed in a most awkward predicament. Some days ago
Mr. Hay, the district attorney, in open court tendered him a pardon
under the great seal and with the sign manual of '<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="met colleague">Thomas Jefferson</a>'.
Bollman refused to receive it. Hay urged it upon him. Bollman said
that no man could force on him such a badge of infamy. Hay insisted
that he was a pardoned man, whether he would or not; and this question
will, probably, also come before the court in argument to-day or
to-morrow."
</p><p>June 22, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>
On Friday Mr. Hay complained that Burr had so constantly occupied the
court for the four weeks past with his extraordinary motions, that he
(Mr. Hay) could not get an opportunity of making one on his part; he
therefore gave notice that he should, at the first interval, move for
leave to send to the grand jury interrogatories for their instruction,
to be put to the witnesses, in order that the 'whole truth' might come
out.
</p><p>Burr said it was a thing without example, and which the court could
not permit without his assent; but he thought there was reason in the
proposal of Mr. Hay, and that he should cheerfully assent, with the
condition only that he (Burr) should also send interrogatories, to be
put to the same witnesses, the better to extract the ''whole truth.'_
</p><p>The court said that it certainly could not be permitted to Mr. Hay to
send interrogatories, being against usage and reason; but as Mr. Burr
had assented, there seemed to be no objection that both parties should
send in interrogatories; and such permission was granted, whereupon
Mr. Hay withdrew his motion."
</p><p>June 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>While we were engaged to-day in the argument of the question for an
attachment against Wilkinson, the grand jury came into court with
bills against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend colleague">Blennerhassett</a> and myself for treason and misdemeanour.
Two bills against each of us. These indictments for treason are
founded on the following allegations: that Colonel Tyler, with twenty
or thirty men, stopped at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend colleague">Blennerhassett's</a> Island on their way down
the Ohio; that though these men were not armed, and had no military
array or organization, and though they did neither use force nor
threaten it, yet, having set out with a view of taking temporary
possession of New-Orleans on their way to Mexico, that such intent was
treasonable, and therefore a war was levied on <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend colleague">Blennerhassett's</a> Island
by 'construction'; and that, though Colonel Burr was then at Frankfort
on his way to Tennessee, yet, having advised the measure, he was, 'by
construction of law', present at the island, and levied war there. In
fact, the indictment charges that Aaron Burr was on that day present
at the island, though not a man of the jury supposed this to be true.
</p><p>This idea of 'constructive war' is, by this jury, carried far beyond
the dictum advanced by Judge Chace in the case of Fries; for Chace
laid down that the actual exertion of force, in a hostile or
traitorous manner, was indispensable to establish treason. Yet the
opinions of Chace in this case were complained of by the whole
republican party, and condemned by all the lawyers of all parties in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, as tending to introduce the odious and unconstitutional
doctrine of 'constructive treason'.
</p><p>Out of fifty witnesses who have been examined before the grand jury,
it may be safely alleged that thirty at least have been perjured.
</p><p>I beg and expect it of you that you will conduct yourself as becomes
my daughter, and that you manifest no signs of weakness or alarm."
</p><p>
June 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>Of myself you could expect to hear nothing new; yet something new and
unexpected was moved yesterday. The counsel for the prosecution
proposed to the court that Aaron Burr should be sent to the
penitentiary for safe keeping, and stated that the governor and
council had offered to provide me with an apartment in the third story
of that building. This is extremely kind and obliging in the governor
and his council. The distance, however, would render it so
inconvenient to my counsel to visit me, that I should prefer to remain
where I am; yet the rooms proposed are said to be airy and healthy."
</p><p>
July 3, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>I have three rooms in the third story of the penitentiary, making an
extent of one hundred feet. My jailer is quite a polite and civil
man--altogether unlike the idea one would form of a jailer. You would
have laughed to have heard our compliments the first evening.
</p><p>
'Jailer'. I hope, sir, it would not be disagreeable to you if I
should lock this door after dark.
</p><p>
'Burr'. By no means, sir; I should prefer it, to keep out intruders.
</p><p>
'Jailer'. It is our custom, sir, to extinguish all lights at nine
o'clock; I hope, sir, you will have no objection to conform to that.
</p><p>
'Burr'. That, Sir, I am sorry to say, is impossible; for I never go
to bed till twelve, and always burn two candles.
</p><p>
'Jailer'. Very well, sir, just as you please. I should have been glad
if it had been otherwise; but, as you please, sir.
</p><p>While I have been writing different servants have arrived with
messages, notes, and inquiries, bringing oranges, lemons, pineapples,
raspberries, apricots, cream, butter, ice, and some ordinary
articles."
</p><p>July 6, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>My friends and acquaintance of both sexes are permitted to visit me
without interruption, without inquiring their business, and without
the 'presence of a spy'. It is well that I have an antechamber, or I
should often be gênê with visitors.
</p><p>If you come I can give you a bedroom and parlour on this floor. The
bedroom has three large closets, and it is a much more commodious one
than you ever had in your life. Remember, no agitations, no
complaints, no fears or anxieties on the road, or I renounce thee."
</p><p>July 24, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>I want an independent and discerning witness to my conduct and to
that of the government. The scenes which have passed and those about
to be transacted will exceed all reasonable credibility, and will
hereafter be deemed fables, unless attested by very high authority.
</p><p>I repeat what has heretofore been written, that I should never invite
any one, much less those so dear to me, to witness my disgrace. I may
be immured in dungeons, chained, murdered in legal form, but I cannot
be humiliated or disgraced. If absent, you will suffer great
solicitude. In my presence you will feel none, whatever may be the
_malice' or the 'power' of my enemies, and in both they abound."
</p><p>July 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>I am informed that some good-natured people here have provided you a
house, and furnished it, a few steps from my 'townhouse'. I had also
made a temporary provision for you in my townhouse, whither I shall
remove on Sunday; but I will not, if I can possibly avoid it, move
before your arrival, having a great desire to 'receive you all in this
mansion'. Pray, therefore, drive directly out here. You may get
admission at any time from four in the morning till ten at night.
Write me by the mail from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a>, that I may know of your
approach."
</p><p>
[On this letter is endorsed, in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>'s handwriting, 'Received on
our approach to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. How happy it made me!_"]
</p><p>
The following was written after <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> had left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> and
returned to South Carolina.
</p><p><a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, September 28, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>It is impossible to predict when this business may terminate, as the
chief justice has gradually relaxed from former rules of evidence, and
will now hear any thing, without regard to distance of time or place.
Wilkinson has been examined, and had partly gone through the
cross-examination when we closed on Saturday. 'He acknowledged, very
modestly, that he had made certain alterations in the letter received
from me, by erasures, &c., and then swore it to be a true copy.' He
has not yet acknowledged the substitution of names."
</p><p>October 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>Major Bruff, who was produced as a witness on my behalf, deposed
that, in a conversation with Dearborn and Rodney, the
attorney-general, in March last, he accused Wilkinson of several
crimes, and gave the names of witnesses who would establish the
charges. Those gentlemen replied that General Wilkinson 'had' stood
very low in the estimation of the President, but that his energetic
conduct at New-Orleans had raised him in estimation; that he now stood
very high, and that the president would support him; that if the
government should now prosecute Wilkinson, or do any thing to impair
his credit, Burr would escape, and that was just what the federalists
and the enemies to the administration wished."
</p><p>October 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1807">1807</a>.
</p><p>After all, this is a sort of drawn battle. The chief justice gave his
opinion on Tuesday. After declaring that there were no grounds of
suspicion as to the treason, he directed that Burr and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=hnb" rel="met friend colleague">Blennerhassett</a>
should give bail in three thousand dollars for further trial in Ohio.
This opinion was matter of regret and surprise to the friends of the
chief justice, and of ridicule to his enemies--all believing that it
was a sacrifice of principle to conciliate 'Jack Cade'. Mr. Hay
immediately said that he should advise the government to 'desist from
further prosecution'. That he has actually so advised there is no
doubt.

I have found it so difficult to answer that part of your letter which
regards myself and my concerns, that it has been deferred, though
often in my mind. At some other time I may give you, in detail, a
sketch of the sad period which has elapsed since my return. For the
present, it will suffice to say that my business affords me a decent
support. If I had not been interrupted in the career which I began, I
should, before this, have paid all my debts and been at ease.
</p><p>
My old creditors (principally the holders of the Mexican debts) came
upon me last winter with vindictive fury. I was held to bail in large
sums, and saw no probability of keeping out of prison for six months.
This danger is still menacing, but not quite so imminent. I shall
neither borrow nor receive from any one, not even from you. I have
determined not to begin to pay unless I see a prospect of paying all.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, November 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a>.
</p><p>
A congressional caucus will, in the course of the ensuing month,
nominate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="met colleague">James Monroe</a> for President of the United States, and will
call on all good republicans to support the nomination.
</p><p>
Whether we consider the measure itself, the character and talents of
the man, or the state whence he comes, this nomination is equally
exceptionable and odious.
</p><p>
I have often heard your opinion of these congressional nominations.
They are hostile to all freedom and independence of suffrage. A
certain junto of actual and factitious Virginians, having had
possession of the government for twenty-four years, consider the
United States as their property, and, by bawling "Support the
Administration," have so long succeeded in duping the republican
public. One of their principal arts, and which has been systematically
taught by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="met colleague">Jefferson</a>, is that of promoting state dissensions, not
between republican and federal--that would do them no good--but
schisms in the republican party. By looking round you will see how the
attention of leading men in the different states has thus been turned
from general and 'state' politics. Let not this disgraceful domination
continue.
</p><p>
Independently of the manner of the nomination and the location of the
candidate, the man himself is one of the most improper and incompetent
that could be selected. Naturally dull and stupid; extremely
illiterate; indecisive to a degree that would be incredible to one who
did not know him; pusillanimous, and, of course, hypocritical; has no
opinion on any subject, and will be always under the government of the
worst men; pretends, as I am told, to some knowledge of military
matters, but never commanded a platoon, nor was ever fit to command
one. 'He served in the Revolutionary War!'--that is, he acted a
short time as aid-de-camp to Lord Stirling, who was regularly
********. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="met colleague">Monroe's</a> whole duty was to fill his lordship's tankard, and
hear, with indications of admiration, his lordship's long stories
about himself. Such is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="met colleague">Monroe's</a> military experience. I was with my
regiment in the same division at the time. As a lawyer, Monroe was far
below mediocrity.
</p><p>
He never rose to the honour of trying a cause of the value of a
hundred pounds. This is a character exactly suited to the views of the
Virginia junto.
</p><p>
To this junto you have twice sacrificed yourself, and what have you
got by it? Their hatred and abhorrence. Did you ever know them to
countenance a man of talents and independence? Never--nor ever will.
</p><p>
It is time that you manifested that you had some individual character;
some opinion of your own; some influence to support that opinion. Make
them fear you, and they will be at your feet. Thus far they have
reason to believe that you fear them.
</p><p>
The moment is extremely auspicious for breaking down this degrading
system. The best citizens of our country acknowledge the feebleness of
our administration. They acknowledge that offices are bestowed merely
to preserve power, and without the smallest regard to fitness. If,
then, there be a man in the United States of firmness and decision,
and having standing enough to afford even a hope of success, it is
your duty to hold him up to public view: that man is '<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met acquaintance colleague">Andrew Jackson</a>.'.
Nothing is wanting but a respectable nomination, made before the
proclamation of the Virginia caucus, and Jackson's success is
inevitable.
</p><p>
If this project should accord with your views, I could wish to see
'you' prominent in the execution of it. It must be known to be 'your'
work. Whether a formal and open nomination should now be made, or
whether you should, for the present, content yourself with barely
denouncing, by a joint resolution of both houses of your legislature,
congressional caucuses and nominations, you only can judge. One
consideration inclines me to hesitate about the policy of a present
nomination. It is this--that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a> ought first to be admonished to
be passive: for, the moment he shall be announced as a candidate, he
will be assailed by the Virginia junto with menaces, and with
insidious promises of boons and favours. 'There is danger that Jackson
might be wrought upon by such practices'. If an open nomination be
made, an express should be instantly sent to him.
</p><p>
This suggestion has not arisen from any exclusive attachment to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a>. The object is to break down this vile combination which rules
and degrades the United States. If you should think that any other man
could be held up with better prospect of success, name that man. I
know of no such. But the business must be accomplished, and on this
occasion, and by you. So long as the present system prevails, you will
be struggling against wind and tide to preserve a precarious
influence. You will never be forgiven for the crime of having talents
and independence.
</p><p>
Exhibit yourself, then, and emerge from this state of nullity. You owe
it to yourself, you owe it to me, you owe it to your country, you owe
it to the memory of the dead.
</p><p>
I have talked of this matter to your late secretary, but he has not
seen this letter.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
</p><p>
Your secretary was to have delivered this personally, but has changed
his course on hearing that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a> is on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. If you
should have any confidential friend among the members of Congress from
your state, charge him to caution Jackson against the perfidious
caresses with which he will be overwhelmed at Washington.

</p><p>
A copy of the preceding went under cover to Dr. Wragg. Since that date
things are wonderfully advanced, as your secretary will write or tell
you. These will require a written message (letter) from yourself and
others (or yourself alone, but three names would look more formal),
advising <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a> what is doing; that communications have been had with
the Northern states, requiring him only to be passive, and asking from
him a list of persons in the Western states to whom you may address
your letters.
