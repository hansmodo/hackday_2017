Thus far have we advanced on this 'terrible' journey, from which you
predicted so many evils, Without meeting even with inconvenience. How
strange that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met spouse">Mr. Alston</a> should be wrong. Do not, however, pray for
misfortunes to befall us that your character may be retrieved; it were
useless, I assure you; although I am very sensible how anxious you
must now be to inspire me with all due respect and reverence, I should
prefer to feel it in any other way.
</p><p>
We shall go from hence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> in a sleigh, and hope to arrive on
Sunday evening, that we may be 'settled' on Thursday. Adieu. Health
and happiness.
