Thank Heaven, my dear father, I am at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lumberton" rel="city">Lumberton</a>, and within a few days
of rest. I am sick, fatigued, out of patience, and on the very brink
of being out of temper. Judge, therefore, if I am not in great need of
repose. What conduces to render the journey unpleasant is, that it
frets the boy, who has acquired two jaw teeth since he left you, and
still talks of 'gampy'. We travel in company with the two Alstons.
Pray teach me how to write two A's without producing something like an
'Ass'.

We expect to reach Georgetown on the 1st of November. There we shall
remain three or four days, and then proceed to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,. Adieu.
'Mille baises'.
