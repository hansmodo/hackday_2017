<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, January 13th, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1801">1801</a>.
</p><p>
I have already written to you by the post to tell you that I shall be
happy to see you whenever you choose; that I suppose is equivalent
to very soon; and that you may no longer feel doubts or suspicions
on my account, I repeat the invitation by a packet as less dilatory
than the mail; but for all these doubts and suspicions I will take
ample revenge when we meet.
</p><p>
I yesterday received your letter of the 26th of December, and am
expecting your defence of early marriages to-day. My <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="met parent">father<a/> laughs at
my impatience to hear from you, and says I am in love; but I do not
believe that to be a fair deduction, for the post is really very
irregular and slow--enough so to provoke anybody.
</p><p>
We leave this for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> on the 26th inst., and shall remain there
till the 10th February. My movements will after that depend upon my
father and you. I had intended not to marry this twelvemonth, and in
that case thought it wrong to divert you from your present engagements	
in Carolina; but to your solicitations I yield my judgment. Adieu. I
wish you many returns of the century.
</p><p>
14th January.
</p><p>
I have not yet received your promised letter; but I hope it may be
long in proportion to the time I have been expecting it. The packet
has been delayed by head-winds, but now that they are fair she will
have a quick passage; at least such I wish it. Adieu, encore.
