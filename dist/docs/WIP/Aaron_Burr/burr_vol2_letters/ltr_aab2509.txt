</p><p>
Your letter, dated early in this month--I don't recollect the very
day, having left the letter in town; but you write so seldom that a
reference to the month is sufficiently descriptive; your letter, then,
of March, announcing your removal to the Oaks, the pretty description
of your house and establishment, 'and all that', were very amusing. I
had really begun to doubt whether you were not all dead or something
worse.

I shall get the speech, no thanks to you; there is a copy in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for which I have written, and it will come endorsed by
the fair hand of Celeste: truly her hand and arm are handsome. I did
not see her on my way through-- 'tant mieux'; for I took great affront;
thence ensued explanations, &c. Nothing like a quarrel to advance
love. La Planche I did see twice in one day; the last a long, very
long visit. Lovely in weeds. La G., of whom you inquire, is of the
grave age of forty-six; about the age of the vice-president.

They are very busy here about an election between Morgan Lewis and A.
Burr. The former supported by the Livingstons and Clintons, the latter
_per se'. I would send you some new and amusing libels against the
vice-president, but, as you did not send the speech, nor did even
acknowledge the receipt of one of the many public documents which I
took the trouble of forwarding, it may be presumed that this sort of
intercourse is not desired.

Ph. Church and Miss Stewart, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, it is said, are to be
married; Duer (which Duer I don't know) and Miss M. Denning reported
as engaged; Bunner and Miss Church said to be mutually in love; on his
part avowed, on hers not denied.
</p><p>
The Earl of Selkirk is here: a frank, unassuming, sensible man of
about thirty. Whether he thinks of La R. is unknown to the writer. He
dines with me on Monday.
</p><p>
If you had one particle of invention or genius, you would have taught
A. B. A. his 'a, b, c' before this. God mend you. His fibbing is an
inheritance, which pride, an inheritance, will cure. His mother went
through that process. Adieu.
