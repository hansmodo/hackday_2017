Your letter of the 20th December (the venison letter) is still the
last, though the Carolinians here have so late as the 3d and 4th of
January, of which I am a little jealous. It is quite unlucky that you
have been out of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, when your things arrived. How cook and
maid will dispose of themselves for the interim, I know not. Mighty
meek and humble we are grown. You really expect to do the honours of
your house 'equal' to, &c. I know better. It will be one of the most
cheerful and amiable houses in the United States. I am gratified that
you do not start with splendour; to descend with dignity is rare.

Pray make no definitive arrangements against the mountains. My heart
is set on running over them with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> in the spring. Why may not
Papa Alston be weaned as well as Papa Burr? My movements must depend
on the adjournment of Congress. Some say we shall adjourn the middle
of April, and some the middle of June. As yet, I know nothing of the
matter; for, during the few days I have been here, I have been
enveloped in ceremonies. I am pleasantly lodged near the capitol.
Eustis opposite to me. Law and Iruko my nearest neighbours.

Good venison is not to be had at this season, and to send indifferent
any thing (except a wife) from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, would be treason. Yet, on this
important subject, venison meaning, I have written to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. You
need not expect it, for I repeat that the best cannot now be had.
</p><p>
You must walk a great deal. It is the only exercise you can take with
safety and advantage, and, being in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, I fear you will
neglect it. I do entreat you to get a very stout pair of over shoes,
or short boots, to draw on over your shoes. But shoes to come up to
the ankle bone, with one button to keep them on, will be best; thick
enough, however, to turn water. The weather has not yet required this
precaution, but very soon it will, and I pray you to write me that you
are so provided: without them you will not, cannot walk, and without
exercise you will suffer in the month of May. To be at ease on this
subject, you must learn to walk without your husband--alone--or, if
you must be in form, with ten negroes at your heels. Your husband will
often be occupied at the hours you would desire to walk, and you must
not 'gener' him: oh, never. Adieu.
