<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, November 29, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
I came to Berkeley as was proposed. You were not there; no letter from
you. I sent a messenger to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington City</a> for intelligence, and
waited his return in unpleasant suspense. At the termination of six
days my messenger returned with letters advising that you would be at
Hillsborough, whither I resolved immediately to go, but thought it
best to take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> in my way, in the hope of other letters. You
were all at the Oaks, and no movement spoken of. You were to go alone
to the legislature. Wife and child to be left at the Oaks.
</p><p>
Though oppressed with important engagements, I would nevertheless set
off with the stage of this day for Georgetown and the Oaks if I could
have been assured of finding preparations ready made for the
contemplated journey of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and the boy; but as you may have
left home without attending to this point, it seemed probable that I
might make a fruitless journey of nine hundred miles; fruitless,
except the pleasure of passing one day at the Oaks, and even this with
the alloy of your absence. My course will, therefore, be now to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, where I have made appointments, and either at that place
or this shall wait your reply, and we must endeavour to arrange our
plans with precision. Address me at this place.
</p><p>
My solicitude about the health of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> is no way relieved by the
sort of recovery of which she advises me. The boy, too, has a relapse
of the ague, a disease of all others the most fatal to the infant
constitution. Great God! what sacrifices do you make, and to what end?
These solicitudes poison all my enjoyments, and often unfit me for
business. Being apprized from recollection of our personal
communications last autumn, and of our correspondence last winter, of
the engagements and ties which will prevent you, at least for some
months, from leaving South Carolina, I determine, at any sacrifice, to
rescue <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and son.
</p><p>
There will be no war with Spain unless we shall declare it, which is
not expected. England continues a course of malevolence, which will
still continue and be borne. France, more courteous in words, under
the pressure of her own affairs. Affectionately,
