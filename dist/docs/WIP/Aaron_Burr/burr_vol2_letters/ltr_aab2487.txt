Indeed, indeed, my dear little <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, I will write to you very
soon. Don't scold and pout so, and I will tell you 'how' I visited
Annapolis, and 'how' I returned about an hour ago. All that, however,
may be told in half a line. I went and returned in my own little
coachee. But what I did and who I saw are other matters. Something,
too, about Celeste, and something about Madame G., whom you are
pleased to term the rich widow. This, I think, will keep you quiet a
week.

Your letter, written on your return from seeing Natalie, is received.
You are a dear good little girl to write me so; and of dear little
'gampy', too, so much, yet never enough. God bless thee.
