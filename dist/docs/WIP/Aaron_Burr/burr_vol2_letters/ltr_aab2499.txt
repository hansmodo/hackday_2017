<p>
TO NATALIE DELAGE SUMTER.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 27, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
The 'brochure', containing proclamations and manifestoes regarding
Louisiana, was intended to accompany those which I lately transmitted
to you for Mr. Sumter.
</p><p>
You will be proud, as a New-Yorker, to see that the first attempt to
create a taste for painting and sculpture has been made in our city.
We have about forty busts and groups. Lailson's theatre (west side
Greenwich-street) has been fitted up for their reception. It forms a
circular room of about sixty or seventy feet diameter, lighted by a
dome, and to us, who have seen nothing better, the thing, of course,
looks well. Come and see our infant efforts.
</p><p>
I am just leaving this place for a few days on a visit to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,; a visit, however, of business only. On my return you
will hear again from me. In the mean time, pray write me when I may
expect you at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.
</p><p>
A. BURR,
