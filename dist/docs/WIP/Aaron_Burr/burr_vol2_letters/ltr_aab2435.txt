By the ship Protectress you will receive all your things, together
with cook and maid. To sail on the 14th. On the day of sailing I will
write to you, enclosing the bills of lading.
</p><p>
Your interesting letter of the 23d is this day received. It brings me
to the familiar acquaintance with your amiable circle, and admits me
to your fireside more than any thing you have written. Mrs. Allen is
here. Anna will, to all appearance, be married before spring to a
merchant of the name of Pierpont. Catharine is astonished that she has
not yet an answer to her letter. I have told her that she can by no
possibility have one before Christmas. In your reading, I wish you
would learn to read newspapers; not to become a partisan in politics,
God forbid, but they contain the occurrences of the day, and furnish
the standing topics of conversation. The reading of newspapers is a
knack which you will acquire in six weeks, by reading, during that
time, every thing. With the aid of a gazetteer and atlas, you must
find every place that is spoken of. Pray, madam, do you know of what
consist the "Republic of the Seven Islands?" Do you know the present
boundaries of the French republic? Neither, in all probability. Then
hunt them.

Now, one word of self. I came here on the 6th, and shall remain in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, till near the 20th. Then to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. The business is in a
prosperous way. My great love for the fine arts, especially sculpture,
may detain me a week in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. Adieu, ma belle.
