Just arrived at the city of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, this 12th day of January, A.
D. 18O2. I have only time, before closing of the mail, "to send you
these few lines, hoping they may find you in good health, as I am at
this present time," &c.
</p><p>
A form of salutation to be found in a public letter of Julius Cesar,
and in one of Cicero's familiar epistles.
</p><p>
Your letters which greet me here are of the 2d and 20th of December
only; only two. Why, I expected to find a dozen, and some of them down
to within three or four days of this date. Having a hundred letters
before me unread, I must defer writing to you for the present. Adieu.
