Your little letter from Alexandria assured me of your safety, and for
a moment consoled me for your absence. The only solid consolation is
the belief that you will be happy, and the certainty that we shall
often meet.

I am to be detained here yet a week. Immediately on my return to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, I shall prepare for a tour to Georgetown or to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,;
probably a water passage.

I.B. Prevost has been hurrying off Senat and Natalie; but for his
interposition they would have relied wholly on me, and I had already
proposed that they should go with the chancellor some time in the
summer or autumn, which would have been then or never, as I had
pleased; but he (I.B.P.) has advised otherwise, and strongly urged
their immediate departure. I think I shall be able to prevent it.

Would <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> be willing to go as secretary to Chancellor
Livingston? I beg his immediate answer.

Adieu, ma chere amie.
