Havre de Grace (Susquehannah), January 30, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>. In a former letter I
told you we had eight inches snow at Washington. On Saturday last,
28th, fell six or eight inches more, so that we had a foot depth of
snow, cold weather, and, of course, good sleighing. The vice-president
having, with great judgment and science, calculated the gradations of
cold in different latitudes, discovered that for every degree he
should go north he might count on 'four and a half inches' of snow.
Thus he was sure of 'sixteen and a half' inches at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,;
_twenty-one inches' at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and so for all the intermediate
space. Hence he wisely concluded to take off the wheels from his
coachee and to set it on runners. This was no sooner resolved than
done. With his sleigh and four horses he arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, at early
dinner. Passed the evening with Madame Bonaparte; all very charming.
Came off this morning; fine sleighing. A hundred times he applauded
the wisdom of his plan. Within 'six' miles of the Susquehannah the
snow appeared thin; within 'four', the ground was bare. It had not
thawed, but none had fallen. He dragged on to this place, and here he
is in the midst of the most forlorn dilemma. This is palpable fraud in
_monsieur le tems', to hold out such lures merely to draw one into
jeopardy. Having neither wife nor daughter near me on whom to vent my
spleen, renders the case more deplorable. It is downright desperation.
</p><p>
After pacing the floor with a very quick step for about five minutes,
I determined to call for a good dinner and a bottle of wine, and,
after the discussion whereof, I hope to be more able to meet the
exigence. You shall presently know.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, February 8, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
Just arrived--all well. The dinner and wine mentioned t'other side
operated so happily, that, before the repast was concluded, I ordered
my horses to the door, drove over the Susquehannah on the ice, and
came that night to the head of Elk. Next day to Chester, having seen
friend Dickenson 'en passant' (the daughters not visible, on account
of the loss of their mother, who died 'last summer_), and breakfasted
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, on the morning of the 1st of February. The ebullition
of the 30th January was intended to have been finished at Havre de
Grace and sent to the postoffice. I came off in too much haste, and,
seeing it now in my writing-case, I thought it a pity that so precious
a morceau should be lost to the world.

_Tout le monde' is marrying at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. You will not have a
_single single' (decipher that) acquaintance there on your return.
Yes, La R., La Planche, and La Bin. may remain. I went to a wedding
supper at Mrs. Moore's, whose daughter has married Willing--could any
one suppose she was 'unwilling_? Execrable! Mr. Boadley died a few
days ago. Madame of course was invisible. Ann Stuart will, most
likely, marry P. C.--very well. She is very pretty. Mary Rush just
married Manners, a captain in the British army. She looked quite
melancholy, being on the point of setting off for Niagara, where her
husband is stationed. Binney and Keene look better than I ever saw
them. Keene is learning the harp. They are at lodgings in town, and,
happening to be near my quarters, I saw them two or three times a day.
</p><p>
I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, yesterday, and arrived, as you see, after a very
pleasant journey. Fine, mild winter weather. Roads hard and smooth.
Note. I left my runners and got wheels at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. How could I
omit Celeste and her sisters, whom I saw several times? What of that?
Pray can it be true that she was engaged to a young man whom we knew
and valued, and who lately died in your country? To-morrow I am to see
La G. Pray for me.
</p><p>
To-morrow, February 9th.
</p><p>
A most ugly northeast storm of rain, and hail, and mist. Shall not see
La G. to-day. God bless thee.
