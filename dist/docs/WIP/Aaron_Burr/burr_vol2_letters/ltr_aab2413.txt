The question--'When shall we meet'? is already answered; but I must
now answer it anew, and for a more distant day; perhaps Wednesday,
perhaps Thursday; but you will hear again. Your letters amuse me; your
recovery rejoices me; your determination not to torment yourself is
neither from philosophy nor spleen--it is mere words, and an attempt
to deceive yourself, which may succeed for the moment; 'ergo', no
determination; 'ergo', not founded on philosophy; 'ergo', not on
resentment; 'ergo', neither. I have no doubt but 'chose' is on the
way; the journey cannot at this season be performed in thirty days.

My compliments to A. C. M., and am very much obliged to them. It is
the most fatiguing thing imaginable for such crude tastes as those of
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and A. B. You had better apologize. You are sick and I am
absent. But you have not mentioned the day--neither that of the
beauty's ball, for which I owe you much ill will, and therefore my
next shall be to 'Natalie', to whom all good wishes.
