<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, April 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1802">1802</a>.
</p><p>
MA CHERE ENFANTE,
</p><p>
Different accidents and interruptions prevented me from writing by the
two last mails; a very unusual omission, and thus happens what, I
believe, has never before occurred, that I have two of your letters
unanswered, those of the 19th and 22d, both affecting and interesting.
The last of them acknowledges the receipt of a letter from me dated
March 9th. Now, I did not write any letter under that date, it must be
a forgery. On the 8th and 12th I did write to you.
</p><p>
It is, I hope and believe, true that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill is competent to all
purposes; but nothing is done nor can be speedily done. The thing
constantly eludes a conclusion, and matters are, in fact, now as badly
circumstanced as one year ago. When I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, I arranged my
affairs of 'all kinds' for six months' absence, which would extend to
the middle of June, with the determination to go hence to South
Carolina, in which determination I persist; yet you know that 'a
single letter may take me in a contrary direction', and mar all my
plans of pleasure. This, and this only, produces the instability of my
resolutions, and the equivocal tenour of my letters on the subject of
the visit.
</p><p>
Nothing certain can be predicated of the adjournment; but I am quite
resolved not to remain here beyond the 25th, more probable that I may
leave it on the 19th. In either case, it will be vain to address a
letter to me at Washington after the receipt of this, as I shall not
be here to receive it. My route will be through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> and
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a> to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, and thence to Georgetown and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=clifton" rel="city">Clifton</a>, 
where I presume I shall find Papa Alston, Ellen, &c. You may address
me a line to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>, and another to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, merely to say how
you are, and who more are dead. Recollecting, when you write, that it
will be very uncertain whether they will reach me; still, on my
arrival at those places, I shall be quite out of humour if I find no
letter from you, and 'will stay a week' at each place in hopes of
receiving one.
</p><p>
I have ordered Vanderlyn to send you, from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, both his and
Stuart's picture of A. Burr; and have told him to ship himself for the
port of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, on the 1st of May.
</p><p>
I have also desired that my beautiful little bust of Bonaparte be sent
to Mr. William Alston.
</p><p>
You may send a letter to meet me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=clifton" rel="city">Clifton</a>,  and two or three to each
place if you find my movements so retarded as to admit a probability
of their being received. Adieu.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
