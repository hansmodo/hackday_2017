<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, November 20, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1815">1815</a>.
</p><p>
A congressional caucus will, in the course of the ensuing month,
nominate <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="met colleague">James Monroe</a> for President of the United States, and will
call on all good republicans to support the nomination.
</p><p>
Whether we consider the measure itself, the character and talents of
the man, or the state whence he comes, this nomination is equally
exceptionable and odious.
</p><p>
I have often heard your opinion of these congressional nominations.
They are hostile to all freedom and independence of suffrage. A
certain junto of actual and factitious Virginians, having had
possession of the government for twenty-four years, consider the
United States as their property, and, by bawling "Support the
Administration," have so long succeeded in duping the republican
public. One of their principal arts, and which has been systematically
taught by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=thj" rel="met colleague">Jefferson</a>, is that of promoting state dissensions, not
between republican and federal--that would do them no good--but
schisms in the republican party. By looking round you will see how the
attention of leading men in the different states has thus been turned
from general and 'state' politics. Let not this disgraceful domination
continue.
</p><p>
Independently of the manner of the nomination and the location of the
candidate, the man himself is one of the most improper and incompetent
that could be selected. Naturally dull and stupid; extremely
illiterate; indecisive to a degree that would be incredible to one who
did not know him; pusillanimous, and, of course, hypocritical; has no
opinion on any subject, and will be always under the government of the
worst men; pretends, as I am told, to some knowledge of military
matters, but never commanded a platoon, nor was ever fit to command
one. 'He served in the Revolutionary War!'--that is, he acted a
short time as aid-de-camp to Lord Stirling, who was regularly
********. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="met colleague">Monroe's</a> whole duty was to fill his lordship's tankard, and
hear, with indications of admiration, his lordship's long stories
about himself. Such is <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=jam" rel="met colleague">Monroe's</a> military experience. I was with my
regiment in the same division at the time. As a lawyer, Monroe was far
below mediocrity.
</p><p>
He never rose to the honour of trying a cause of the value of a
hundred pounds. This is a character exactly suited to the views of the
Virginia junto.
</p><p>
To this junto you have twice sacrificed yourself, and what have you
got by it? Their hatred and abhorrence. Did you ever know them to
countenance a man of talents and independence? Never--nor ever will.
</p><p>
It is time that you manifested that you had some individual character;
some opinion of your own; some influence to support that opinion. Make
them fear you, and they will be at your feet. Thus far they have
reason to believe that you fear them.
</p><p>
The moment is extremely auspicious for breaking down this degrading
system. The best citizens of our country acknowledge the feebleness of
our administration. They acknowledge that offices are bestowed merely
to preserve power, and without the smallest regard to fitness. If,
then, there be a man in the United States of firmness and decision,
and having standing enough to afford even a hope of success, it is
your duty to hold him up to public view: that man is '<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met acquaintance colleague">Andrew Jackson</a>.'.
Nothing is wanting but a respectable nomination, made before the
proclamation of the Virginia caucus, and Jackson's success is
inevitable.
</p><p>
If this project should accord with your views, I could wish to see
'you' prominent in the execution of it. It must be known to be 'your'
work. Whether a formal and open nomination should now be made, or
whether you should, for the present, content yourself with barely
denouncing, by a joint resolution of both houses of your legislature,
congressional caucuses and nominations, you only can judge. One
consideration inclines me to hesitate about the policy of a present
nomination. It is this--that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a> ought first to be admonished to
be passive: for, the moment he shall be announced as a candidate, he
will be assailed by the Virginia junto with menaces, and with
insidious promises of boons and favours. 'There is danger that Jackson
might be wrought upon by such practices'. If an open nomination be
made, an express should be instantly sent to him.
</p><p>
This suggestion has not arisen from any exclusive attachment to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a>. The object is to break down this vile combination which rules
and degrades the United States. If you should think that any other man
could be held up with better prospect of success, name that man. I
know of no such. But the business must be accomplished, and on this
occasion, and by you. So long as the present system prevails, you will
be struggling against wind and tide to preserve a precarious
influence. You will never be forgiven for the crime of having talents
and independence.
</p><p>
Exhibit yourself, then, and emerge from this state of nullity. You owe
it to yourself, you owe it to me, you owe it to your country, you owe
it to the memory of the dead.
</p><p>
I have talked of this matter to your late secretary, but he has not
seen this letter.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
</p><p>
Your secretary was to have delivered this personally, but has changed
his course on hearing that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a> is on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>. If you
should have any confidential friend among the members of Congress from
your state, charge him to caution Jackson against the perfidious
caresses with which he will be overwhelmed at Washington.

</p><p>
A copy of the preceding went under cover to Dr. Wragg. Since that date
things are wonderfully advanced, as your secretary will write or tell
you. These will require a written message (letter) from yourself and
others (or yourself alone, but three names would look more formal),
advising <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Jackson</a> what is doing; that communications have been had with
the Northern states, requiring him only to be passive, and asking from
him a list of persons in the Western states to whom you may address
your letters.
