I have heard that you reached Fishkill on Sunday, and thence conclude
that you got home on Monday night. When in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, send a note
to Charles Biddle, inquiring, &c., and to inform him that you are
going South. He will call and see you, being one of your great
admirers. Desire Doctor Edwards to give <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> a line to Cesar
Rodney, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wilmington" rel="city">Wilmington</a>, a very respectable young man. He will introduce
you to the venerable Dickenson, who, knowing my great respect for him
(which you will also take care to let him know), will be pleased to
see <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> and you on that footing. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, either call
immediately on Mrs. Smith, or let her know of your arrival. You are to
wait in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, until I overtake you, which will be on the 28th at
the latest. Adieu.
