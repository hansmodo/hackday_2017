</p><p>
The coroner's jury continued to the 26th (my last <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, date) to
sit and adjourn. Upon suspicion that my friends had some knowledge of
the subject, derived either from Van Ness or me, 'warrants' have
issued to bring them in to testify. Matthew L. Davis was apprehended,
and, refusing to answer, was committed to prison, where he now lies;
probably Colonel Willett is now also in jail on the same account.
Swartwout, Van Ness, and others are secreted. How long this sort of
persecution may endure cannot be conjectured.

The ferment, which was with so much industry excited, has subsided,
and public opinion begins to take its proper course.
