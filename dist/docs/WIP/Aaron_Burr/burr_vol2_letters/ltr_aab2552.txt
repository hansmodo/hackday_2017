The enclosed newspaper is just now put into my hands. It is true, as
is there said, that I made a talk, as was decent and proper, to the
Senate on leaving them formally. There was nothing written or
prepared, except that it had been some days on my mind to say
something. It was the solemnity, the anxiety, the expectation, and the
interest which I saw strongly painted in the countenances of the
auditors, that inspired whatever was said. I neither shed tears nor
assumed tenderness; but tears did flow abundantly. The story in this
newspaper is rather awkwardly and pompously told. It has been gathered
up, I presume, from different relations of the facts. This newspaper
(_The Washington Federalist_) has been for months past, and, for aught
I know (for I read none of them), still is, one of the most abusive
against <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>. I am told that several papers lately make some
qualified compliments; thus, for instance, referring to Judge Chace's
trial--"He conducted with the dignity and impartiality of an angel,
but with the rigour of a devil." May God have you in his holy keeping
