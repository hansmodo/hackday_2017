By the time the enclosed shall reach <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, it will have
travelled about three thousand miles. It will certainly deserve a kind
reception. I leave mine open for your perusal; the other appears to be
from 'Miss Burr'.
</p><p>
Your Dumfries letter was received yesterday. To pass a day in Dumfries
is what you could not at any time very much desire; but to pass one
there against your will, and a rainy day too, was indeed enough to try
your tempers.
</p><p>
On Sunday, the 15th, I commence my journey to New York; there I shall
not arrive till the 25th. Nothing but 'matrimony' will prevent my
voyage to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, and Georgetown; and even so great an event shall
only postpone, but not defeat the project I am sorry, however, to add
that I have no expectations or decided views on this subject. I mean
Hymen.
</p><p>
It gives me very great pleasure to hear that Colonel W. Hampton is
become, in some sort, your neighbour, by having purchased a plantation
within fifteen or twenty miles (as is said) of Georgetown. Write me if
this be so.
</p><p>
I have written to Frederick  as you commanded; that I might not err
in expressing your ideas, I enclosed to him your letter. You have no
warmer friend on earth; no one who would so readily hazard his life to
serve you. It always seemed to me that you did not know his value.
</p><p>
Certain parts of your letter I cannot answer. Let us think of the
expected meeting, and not of the present separation. God bless thee
ever.
