My last went by water, in care of young Gibbs, the baker's son, with
the curricle box, and some other articles which I have forgotten. The
letter contained some samples of M'Kinnon's present. The shawl is
still retained as being too precious to be sent by sea or land. Is
this right?

Mr. Astor left with me some days ago for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> a very beautiful
map of Lower Canada, price 'ten' dollars, and two views of Montreal
and its vicinity, 'two guineas'. I am particularly charged by Mr.
Astor to inform <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> that his landlord at Montreal paid to him
(Mr. Astor), for the account of Joseph Alston, Esq., the sum of 'one
half guinea'; the said landlord having discovered, after the departure
of the said Joseph Alston 'et ux'., that they had not taken with them
two bottles of Madeira wine which the said landlord had charged in the
bill of the said Joseph Alston, and for which he had received payment.
Thus I have discharged myself of a commission which has been enjoined
upon me at least ten times.

Roger Morris's place, the large handsome house on the height beyond
Mrs. Watkins, is for sale. I can get it for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill with 'four_
acres. Shall I exchange? R. M.'s has one hundred and thirty acres. If
I leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill, however, had I not better buy in town, that you
may have a resting-place there ? Dear little 'gampy'; tell me a great
deal about him, or I shall not value your letters. Indeed, I will
return them unopened. Is not that good Irish?

Mr. Law has arrived. Miss Wheeler  is also at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, and A. B.
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,-_tant mieux'. Would you think it? I have been coquetted by
a rich widow, and really I had some thoughts of yielding.

Jerome Bonaparte is here, and he will keep me three days to dine him.
We have exchanged visits, but have not yet met. I think I have mixed
up here every thing I have to say to T. B. A. or J. A. No one word of
politics; but, on further reflection, Mari will be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> when
this arrives.
