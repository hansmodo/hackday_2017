You may assure the family that I never was in better health; that I
have not been wounded or hurt, and have had no quarrel with anybody. I
received your letter of the 29th this evening. Let nothing hinder you
from going to school punctually. Make the master teach you arithmetic,
so that you may be able to keep the accounts of the family. I am very
much obliged to you for teaching Nancy. She will learn more from you
than by going to school.

I shall be at home about the last of this month, when I will make you
all New Year's presents. Tell Harry that I shall expect to find a good
road up to the house. Tell me what Harry is about, and what is doing
at Montalto. Sam and George are well.

You must write to Mrs. Alston about Leonora's child. Enclose your
letter to me. I hope little Peter is doing well.
