MY DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
You will find enclosed a statement of my affairs. Swartwout and Van
Ness are joint executors with you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. It was indispensable
that there should be an executor on the spot. I have directed them to
sell immediately my horses, and to sell nothing else until your
pleasure shall be known. I pray that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> may be consulted and
gratified in this particular.
</p><p>
Explanations of every concern of my property is given in two sheets of
paper which accompany my will. The enclosed is an abstract.
</p><p>
It would have been a great satisfaction to me to have had your
assurance that you would assume my debts, and take and dispose of the
property at discretion. It may be done in a way which you would find a
convenience. My creditors would take your assumption at such time as
you might judge convenient. The property will, undoubtedly, produce
more than the amount of my debts. What you may not incline to keep may
be forthwith turned into cash.
</p><p>
The library, maps, pictures, and wine are articles which you will
need, and which you cannot procure without great trouble and more
money. I think, too, you would do well to retain <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill, as a
more convenient residence than Montalto, particularly as no expense
will be necessary for buildings or improvements.
</p><p>
My private letters I have directed to be put in the hands of
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, that she may select from them her own, those of her mother,
and some others. Among them and my copies you will find much of
trifling, something of amusement, and a little of interest.
</p><p>
Get from Mr. Taylor (the younger), of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> or Camden, my letters
to his brother-in-law, the late J.E. Hunt, who was one of your
chancellors.
</p><p>
Messrs. R. Bunner, William Duer, John Duer, and J.W. Smith, of this
city, and John Van Ness Yates, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>, all lawyers and young men of
talents, have manifested great and disinterested zeal in my favour on
some recent occasions. 
</p><p>
I pray you to take some notice of them, and give to each of them, and
to William T. Broome, now in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, some small token of remembrance of
me. William T. Broome, with great defects of temper, unites very
considerable literary talents and acquirements. A little attention
would attach them all to you.
</p><p>
My very worthy friend, Charles Biddle, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, has six or
seven sons--three of them grown up. With different characters and
various degrees of intelligence, they will all be men of eminence and
of influence. Call to see the father when you pass through
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, and receive the sons kindly.
</p><p>
I have taught my friends in every quarter to look to you as my
representative. There are many of them, your discernment will
distinguish which, on whose loyalty and firmness you may rely through
all changes.
</p><p>
I have called out General Hamilton, and we meet tomorrow morning. Van
Ness will give you the particulars. The preceding has been written in
contemplation of this event. If it should be my lot to fall, * * * * *
* * * yet I shall live in you and your son. I commit to you all that
is most dear to me--my reputation and my daughter. Your talents and
your attachment will be the guardian of the one--your kindness and
your generosity of the other. Let me entreat you to stimulate and aid
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> in the cultivation of her mind. It is indispensable to her
happiness and essential to yours. It is also of the utmost importance
to your son. She would presently acquire a critical knowledge of
Latin, English, and all branches of natural philosophy. All this would
be poured into your son. If you should differ with me as to the
importance of this measure, suffer me to ask it of you as a last
favour. She will richly compensate your trouble.
</p><p>
Most affectionately adieu,
</p><p>

The elder Prevost,  Augustine James Frederic Prevost, is a most
amiable and honourable man. Under the garb of coarse rusticity you
will find, if you know him, refinement, wit, a delicate sense of
propriety, the most inflexible intrepidity, incorruptible integrity,
and disinterestedness. I wish you could know him; but it would be
difficult, by reason of his diffidence and great reluctance to mingle
with the world. It has been a source of extreme regret and
mortification to me that he should be lost to society and to his
friends. The case seems almost remediless, for, alas! 'he is married!_

If you can pardon and indulge a folly, I would suggest that Madame
Sansay, too well known under the name of Leonora, has claims on my
recollection. She is now with her husband at St. Jago of Cuba.
