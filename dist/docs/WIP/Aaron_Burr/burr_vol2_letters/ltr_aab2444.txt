</p><p>
Your letter of the 31st, accompanied by a note dated 1st February,
came by the mail of yesterday. A few lines from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, received
some days before, advised me of your journey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=clifton" rel="city">Clifton</a>,  and of the
distressing occasion. My heart sinks within me when I think of that
lovely and disconsolate woman. Your conduct was worthy of you and of
my daughter. She must be restored to reason and to life, by being
convinced that she has some motive for enduring existence. If no other
can be shown, at least she can be persuaded that she is necessary to
you. But I learn from your letter, though you say nothing of it, that
although she feels with anguish, yet she will not sink into
despondency. This testifies a mind of that dignity and firmness which
you had taught me to expect.
</p><p>
Nothing could have been more fortunate than the revival of the
project. It will divert the attention and summon up the spirits. You
must not condemn; it would be better to cherish it. Enter into all the
details. Transport yourselves to Europe, and there take a nearer view
and more accurate estimate of the dangers and advantages. Let those
who oppose it offer something in lieu. What! is she to wear out her
youth and beauty, dissipate her talents, and exhaust her spirits
without an object in life or a place in society? Without enjoyment,
without distinction? These hints will make you think I may hereafter
say more.
</p><p>
My life has no variety, and, of course, no incident. To my feelings
your letters are the most important occurrence. I am blessed with
three of them in three months. It did not use to be so. It would be no
excessive encroachment on your precious time to give me an hour twice
a week the evening preceding the post days. This I shall expect; 'and
then', and after one more communication, to be presently mentioned, I
will write definitely as to my spring projects.
</p><p>
It is of sculpture: a hint in your last indicates that you have
something in view. Be pleased to give me name and description, in some
mystical, sybillistical way, which, in case of robbery of mail, will
not disclose too much. One letter may contain the name, and another
the comment-- '"Car ou l'arreter?_" is rather too mystical. I can make
nothing of it, having studied it a full hour to no purpose.
</p><p>
I entreat that you will always enclose your letter in a blank sheet,
on which is to be the seal and superscription. Health and blessings.
