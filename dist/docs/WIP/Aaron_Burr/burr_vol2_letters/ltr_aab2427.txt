Mr. Astor, if he should not meet you to deliver this letter, will send
it after you. Yet I dare not trust to such hazards the letters which I
have received for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> and you, I persevere, therefore, in the
determination to retain them.

I was so very solicitous that you should see Niagara, that I was
constantly filled with apprehension lest something might prevent it.
Your letter of the 29th of July relieves me. You had actually seen it.
Your determination to visit Brandt gives me great pleasure,
particularly as I have lately received a very friendly letter from
him, in which he recapitulates your hospitality to him in 'ancient
days', and makes very kind inquiries respecting you; all this before
he could have entertained the remotest idea of seeing you in his own
kingdom.

Natalie and M. Senat have been for some weeks past at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=trenton" rel="city">Trenton</a> ; they
are now on their return, and will be here to-morrow. Vanderlyn, of
whom I said something in my last, will immediately set about her
picture. They (Natalie and Senat) are to go with the chancellor about
the last of September.

Wheeler will be here in a few days. Hampton is actually married to a
charming young girl--so General M'Pherson tells me. I forget her name.
Mr. Ewing is appointed consul to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>, and has sailed. Mrs. Allen is
still at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=elizabethtown" rel="city">Elizabethtown</a>. Adieu.
