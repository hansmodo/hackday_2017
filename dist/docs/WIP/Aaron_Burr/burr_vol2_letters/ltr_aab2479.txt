<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Providence" rel="city">Providence</a>, R. I., August 1, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1803">1803</a>.
</p><p>
I left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, two days after you, that is, on Saturday, and had a
pretty little passage of forty-eight hours. We were, on board, a
British custom-house officer, a sensible, pleasant man, who played
chess with me; two ladies, rather pretty, who did not molest us,
_point exigentes', bien amiable; five little children, who neither
cried nor quarrelled the whole way! yet cheerful and playful.
</p><p>
Six days have I passed here very pleasantly. To-morrow I go, whither
is not determined. You may, however, address me at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, which
will most probably be my destination.
</p><p>
All those you saw when you were last here inquire about you with great
civility and interest, and say pretty things of you. Don't be vain,
madam, for I take this to be a kind of flattery to me, or to be so
intended. Miss C. talks much of you, and L. N., and Miss A. Can you
imagine what are Miss C.'s occupations and arrangements? Never; so
I'll tell you. Why, she instructs two nieces and a nephew (things of
twelve or thirteen) in astronomy, natural philosophy, and principles
of botany! Her boudoir has globes, several mathematical instruments,
&c. All this I discovered by accident; for she denies it all most
strenuously, and with some pretty, unaffected embarrassment. Be
assured this is an amiable, sensible girl. I don't believe you know
her value: so I pray you to study her. She left town yesterday with
her mother for Lebanon. Mr. C. went on Friday to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. What care
you for all that?
</p><p>
Are you a good girl? Do you drink the waters, and bathe, and ride, and
walk? I hear Mrs. W. is handsomer than during her widowhood, of which
I am very glad. Mr. Russel left this on Thursday, intending to pass
through <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a> and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=ballston" rel="city">Ballston</a> on his way to Niagara. If he should come
into your vicinage, desire <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> to recollect him. His wife is
with him. I never saw her.
</p><p>
Tell me who you see, and what you do, and what are your plans. You had
best return by <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a> and Providence if you should have time. Can you
make little 'chose' drink the water? I dare say not. If I were there I
would force some down his little throat. God bless you all.
