I rejoice that your nerves are in better tone, for truly, in some of
your letters, I could scarcely recognise my daughter. As to the boy, I
beseech you not to undertake to teach him the various sounds of the
letters abstractedly from the words in which those sounds are found.
This must be learned arbitrarily. Go on with his a, b, &c.; and when
he shall have learned the language, and not till then, can you teach
him (or ought it to be attempted) the principles of the construction
of that language.

My ostracism is enlivened by a constant succession of visitors from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and New-Jersey. Swartwout and Bunner have just now come in,
and I have not been a day without some 'one, two', or more. They stay
generally two or three days with me, and I am privileged to take them
with me wherever I dine. Major Powell, the friend of Miss Keene, and
the lover of her mother, returned lately from Europe and died here
last week. He has left an estate of ten or twelve thousand guineas per
annum.

I met Miss Sumter (overtook meaning) at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wilmington" rel="city">Wilmington</a>, last winter, and
thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, we rode together in the stage. She is a frank,
sensible, amiable girl. May make a very interesting companion. I was
so much pleased with her, that I went several times to see her (two
miles), though I visited no lady. I took her to General Van Ness's,
where I made her at home. She plays on the piano in a style which may
be called superior, and has a most uncommon fine voice, which has been
neglected.
