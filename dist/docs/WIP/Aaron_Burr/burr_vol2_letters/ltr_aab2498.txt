<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 25, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.

A letter from Mari, without a line from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, is novel. If the
compliment should be returned, I should bring an old house about my
ears. But no apologies or explanations.
</p><p>
I hate them, and the matter will be forgotten before they can reach
me.
</p><p>
I have been a week confined to my room by a headache, but there are no
mortal or alarming symptoms. On Saturday I take a ride to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>,
where I am to dine with Madame Bonaparte. Then on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,;
thence, perhaps, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, and here again by the time your answer
can arrive. Have not yet written to Natalie. How shameful!
</p><p>
Fine sleighing here. Eight inches snow; clear and cold. Having nothing
more at present of great importance to add I remain yours, &c.,

P. S. Since the conclusion of this performance I have set down in a
rage, and written a 'pretty' little letter to Natalie. Lord, how much
easier and lighter I feel.
