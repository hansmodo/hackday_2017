It is very kind indeed to write me so often. Your last is from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a>. "Like gods," forsooth; why, you travel like--; that,
however, was a very pretty allusion. I have repeated it a dozen times
and more. Your other letters also contain now and then a spark of
Promethean fire: a 'spark', mind ye; don't be vain.

And so--has returned 'sans femme'; just now arrived. He saw you and
spoke to you, which rendered him doubly welcome to A. B.
</p><p>
You made two, perhaps more conquests on your Northern tour--King
Brandt and the stage-driver; both of whom have been profuse in their
eulogies. Brandt has written me two letters on the subject. It would
have been quite in style if he had scalped your husband and made you
Queen of the Mohawks.

Bartow, &c., are well. Mrs. Allen better. Mrs. Brockbolst Livingston
dead. Mrs. Van Ness has this day a son. Thus, you see, the rotation is
preserved, and the balance kept up.

There are no swaar apples this year; some others you shall have, anda set of cheap chimney ornaments." I have not asked the price, but
not exceeding 'eight hundred dollars!' Did you take away "The man of
Nature?" I proposed to have sent that with some others to L. N., but
you have thus marred the project.

Since I began this letter I am summoned to leave town two hours before
daylight to-morrow morning, to return next day, when I shall know
definitely the result of the sale, which, indeed, is the object of the
journey. On my return I passed a day with M. A. Monsieur is cold,
formal, monotonous, repulsive. Gods! what a mansion is that bosom for
the sensitive heart of poor M. Lovely victim! I wish she would break
her pretty little neck. Yet, on second thought, would it not be better
that he break his? 'He' is often absent days and weeks. 'She' has not
seen the smoke of a city in five years; but this is dull. I had
something more cheerful to say; this, however, came first, and would
have place. And here am I, at midnight, talking such stuff to
bagatelle, and twenty unanswered letters of 'vast importance' before
me! Get to bed, you hussy.

This letter was nicely sealed up and laid on my table; late last night
I returned from the country, and found the letter just where I left
it. Very surprising! This was so like my dear self, that I laughed and
opened it, to add that <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill will probably be sold within ten
days for 'one hundred and forty thousand dollars', which, though not
half the worth, is enough and more.
