Arrived in good order yesterday. Find my boat and hands ready. The
water high and weather fine. Shall set off in two hours. Have
therefore no time to give any account of my journey hither. My boat
is, properly speaking, a floating house, sixty feet by fourteen,
containing dining-room, kitchen with fireplace, and two bedrooms;
roofed from stem to stern; steps to go up, and a walk on the top the
whole length; glass windows, &c. This edifice costs one hundred and
thirty-three dollars, and how it can be made for that sum passes my
comprehension.

I find that Frankfort will be better than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>,; so address to
me, Frankfort, Kentucky, to the care of the Honourable John Brown.
