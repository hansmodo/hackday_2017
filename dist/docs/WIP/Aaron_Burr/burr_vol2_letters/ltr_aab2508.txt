<p>
TO WILLIAM P. VAN NESS.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, March 7, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.

Friday last was the day assigned for the appearance of Judge Pickering
on his impeachment. He did not appear; but an 'amicus curiae_
suggested that the judge was insane, and tendered the proof of that
fact.
</p><p>
This has given rise to some troublesome questions, rendered more
embarrassing by the total want of rule or precedent, and still
increased by some dissatisfaction on the part of the managers, which
seems to have also infected the House of Representatives. In this
dilemma it would be improper that I should leave the Senate.
Considerations, however, of a nature which you will more readily
approve, have had an influence in detaining me. A decision is hoped
this day on the points now under discussion. I take my leave as soon
as this business is disposed of, and will be with you in the course of
mail-stage.
