TO A. R. ELLERY.

</p><p>
DEAR SIR,
</p><p>
Your letter of the 6th of January is received at the moment that I am
leaving this city on a tour to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, for two or three weeks. I
can, therefore, only acknowledge it. The map was a most acceptable
present. I value it greatly as the work of Madame Ellery; a
circumstance which my vanity has not allowed me to conceal.
</p><p>
You may rely on my zeal and my good will. You can estimate their
importance. On my return you will hear again from me.
</p><p>
The bill, or project of law, herewith enclosed, is now under debate in
the Senate. You will, therefore, consider it as a project merely, not
yet a law. In the course of this discussion it may receive important
alterations, and may be finally rejected. Do not, therefore, suffer
any copy to be taken of it, still less to get into newspapers, if any
you have. You may show it to whom you please. If you have any
acquaintance with Mr. Daniel Clarke, pray let him see it. I wish his
and your opinions, though they may, probably, be received too late to
influence the result. Mr. Clarke is not known to me personally, but
very much through our common friend General Dayton. With respectful
compliments and thanks to Mrs. Ellery, I am your friend,
</p><p>
