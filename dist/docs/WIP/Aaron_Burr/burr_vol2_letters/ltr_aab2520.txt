SIR,
</p><p>
I send for your perusal a letter signed Charles D. Cooper, which,
though apparently published some time ago, has but very recently come
to my knowledge. Mr. Van Ness, who does me the favour to deliver this,
will point out to you that clause of the letter to which I
particularly request your attention.
</p><p>
You must perceive, sir, the necessity of a prompt and unqualified
acknowledgment or denial of the use of any expressions which would
warrant the assertions of Mr. Cooper.
</p><p>
I have the honour to be
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
</p><p>
General HAMILTON.
