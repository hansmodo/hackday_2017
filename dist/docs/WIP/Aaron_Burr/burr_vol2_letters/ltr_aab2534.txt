St. Simon's, August 31, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
I am now quite settled. My establishment consists of a housekeeper,
cook, and chambermaid, seamstress, and two footmen. There are,
besides, two fishermen and four bargemen always at command. The
department of laundress is done abroad. The plantation affords plenty
of milk, cream, and butter; turkeys, fowls, kids, pigs, geese, and
mutton; fish, of course, in abundance. Of figs, peaches, and melons
there are yet a few. Oranges and pomegranates just begin to be
eatable. The house affords Madeira wine, brandy, and porter. Yesterday
my neighbour, Mr. Couper, sent me an assortment of French wines,
consisting of Claret, Sauterne, and Champagne, all excellent; and at
least a twelve months' supply of orange shrub, which makes a most
delicious punch. Madame Couper added sweetmeats and pickles. The
plantations of Butler and Couper are divided by a small creek, and the
houses within one quarter of a mile of each other; accessible,
however, only by water. We have not a fly, moscheto, or bug. I can sit
a whole evening, with open windows and lighted candles, without the
least annoyance from insects; a circumstance which I have never beheld
in any other place. I have not even seen a cockroach.
</p><p>
At Mr. Couper's, besides his family, there are three young ladies,
visitors. One of them arrived about three months ago from France, to
join a brother who had been shipwrecked on this coast, liked the
country so much that he resolved to settle here, and sent for this
sister and a younger brother. About the time of their arrival, the
elder brother was accidentally drowned; the younger went with views to
make an establishment some miles inland, where he now lies dangerously
ill. Both circumstances are concealed from the knowledge of
Mademoiselle Nicholson. In any event, she will find refuge and
protection in the benevolent house of Mr. Couper.
</p><p>
The cotton in this neighbourhood, on the coast southward to the
extremity of Florida, and northward as far as we have heard, has been
totally destroyed. The crop of Mr. C. was supposed to be worth one
hundred thousand dollars, and not an extravagant estimate, for he has
eight hundred slaves. He will not get enough to pay half the expenses
of the plantation. Yet he laughs about it with good humour and without
affectation. Butler suffers about half this loss. Part of his force
had been turned to rice. My travelling companion, secretary, and
aid-de-camp is Samuel Swartwout, the youngest brother of John, a very
amiable young man of twenty or twenty-one.
</p><p>
Now, verily, were it not for the intervention of one hundred miles of
low, swampy, pestiferous country, I would insist on your coming to see
me, all, all! Little 'gamp', and Mademoiselle Sum_tare', and their
appendages; for they are the principals.
</p><p>
I still propose to visit Florida. To set off in three or four days,
and to return hither about the 16th of September; beyond this I have
at present no plan. It is my wish, God knows how ardently I wish, to
return by land, and pass a week with you; but, being without horses,
and there being no possibility of hiring or buying, the thing seems
scarcely practicable. Two modes only offer themselves--either to
embark in the kind of mail stage which goes from Darien through
Savannah, Augusta, and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>, to Camden, or to take a water passage
either to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or Georgetown. Either of these being
accomplished, new difficulties will occur in getting from Statesburgh
northward. I must be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, the first week in November. Consult
your husband, and write me of these matters. Enclose to Mr. Roswell
King, which I repeat, lest my former letters should not have been
received. Our mail has just arrived, but has brought me no letter.
</p><p>
I erred a little in my history of the family of Mademoiselle N. There
are still two brothers here. One a man d'une certaine age. Though not
wealthy, they are not destitute of property.
</p><p>
Mr. C. has just now gone with his boat for the dashers who live about
thirty miles southwest on the main. He has requested me to escort
Madame C. on Sunday to his plantation on the south end of this island,
where we are to meet him and his party on Monday, and bring them home
in our coach. Madame C. is still young, tall, comely, and well bred.
</p><p>
I have been studying all the maps and gazetteers to discover the best
access to Statesburgh. Georgetown seems to be the nearest port; but
whether there be thence a direct road, I cannot discover. Does our
friend Doctor Blythe still reside at Georgetown? If so, I should
repose on him for the means of transportation. Desire Mari to write to
him to aid me in case I should take that route. If I should go to
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, meaning to Sullivan's Island, for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, I shall at
this season most certainly avoid, I should put myself on General
M'Pherson, who, I hear, is now living there with his family; thence up
the Cooper river, about four miles above the town, is a ferryhouse and
tavern on the north side, and thence by Strawberry, where is the best
tavern in the state, is a very direct and beautiful road, and thence,
according to the maps, a very straight road to the high hills of
Santee. But how to get from that ferryhouse is a question I cannot
resolve. All these circumstances are mentioned that I may have your
advice, meaning that of your husband. And, after all, it is possible
that I may not be able to find a passage either to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or
Georgetown, and so be obliged to sail for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. Will close this
letter, for to-morrow it must go to the postoffice at Darien, which is
only about twenty-two miles distant.
</p><p>
September 1.
</p><p>
In one of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>'s letters he spoke of taking you and A. B. A. to
the mountains; and, in a letter which I wrote him from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, I
proposed to meet you in the mountains. Now, for aught which I as yet
know, it will be as easy for me to get to the mountains, or to the
Alps, or the Andes, as to Statesburgh, and therefore, as before, I
crave counsel.
</p><p>
Do yon recollect the second daughter of Mr. Barclay, of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,
the sister of Nelly? She has grown up the very image of her sister. I
saw her very often while I was last in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. She talked
perpetually of you, and made me promise that I would tell you so.
</p><p>
Adieu, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. Remember that I have not received a letter
from you since that of the 22d or 25th of July. I forget which was the
date. I have no faith in the climate of your high hills, surrounded as
they are by noxious swamps. God bless and preserve thee.
