Your vanity, if in any degree concerned, will be fully satisfied by
the assurance that my heart, my wishes, and my thoughts will be with
you. The mortal part of me is indispensably otherwise engaged. As you
cannot fail to have admirers, you cannot fail to be amused. Knowing
that you are happy, I shall be so by sympathy, though in a less
degree, as reflected light is less potent than direct.
