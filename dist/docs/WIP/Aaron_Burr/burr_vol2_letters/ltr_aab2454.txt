From your letter of the 6th, received last evening, I infer that you
are in some sort settled in your own house; that you pleased yourself
on that day is very grateful; that, too, I should have inferred from
the spirit of your letter. By the "attack on Sullivan's Island" was
intended an attack on the plan of residence.
</p><p>
I am just going on an errand to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, 'de retour' on Tuesday; so
that by the next mail you will have nothing from me. Where will you be
from the 10th to 15th May? In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, Sullivan's Island, or
Clifton? Is L. N. coming to live with you? I am quite charmed with
John and Sally. Preparations for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, occupy me so entirely that
I cannot even think of you by this mail. Adieu.

The preceding was written the morning of yesterday. I folded, and
directed, and took it to Senate, thinking there to add a word. At ten
last night I found it lying in my pocket. The weather (rain) has
prevented my <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, jaunt which was planned for this day. The hope
of an early adjournment recedes. In short, all is uncertainty. It will
depend more on the thermometer than on the progress of business. When
the heat shall be intolerable here, shall I set my face towards the
sun? I think I will. If you had been in the mountains! but that is not
so.

Natalie arrived in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a> the 31st December; her mother not there; but
numerous friends, who fatigue her with civilities. Her heart is in the
United States.
</p><p>
This will remain in the postoffice till the 23d. If, in the mean time,
I receive a letter from you, a supplement will accompany this. Adieu.
