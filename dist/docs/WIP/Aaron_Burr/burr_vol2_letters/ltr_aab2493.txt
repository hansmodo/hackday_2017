<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 17, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
Your kind wishes on the new year are received this evening in your
letter dated 3d January, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1803">1803</a>. No matter what date, such things are
always welcome. I don't believe it came into my head to say Happy New
Year! my heart is so full of good wishes for you every day in the
calendar. Yet I like to see attention paid to all 'les jours de fÃªte'.
I am very sorry for poor Charlotte, and do most sincerely sympathize
with Sally. She must know my great attachment for her brother.

Of my plans for the spring nothing can be said, for nothing is
resolved. It is not probable that I shall be able to visit you; but I
shall expect you very early. If you are to come by land, I will meet
you on the road; perhaps in this place, perhaps in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a>. I do not
now see that it will be possible for me to visit South Carolina. Now,
what are your plans? The shawl was ordered on the very day I received
your commands; whether it has actually been sent I know not, but most
probably it has.

Of the boy you never say enough. Nothing about his French in your
last. I hope you talk to him much in French, and Eleonore always. A
letter from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> says that Eleonore's boy was well on the 13th. Your
icehouse and vaults are finished. Of Annapolis I find the newspapers
have anticipated me. They will tell you where I dined, and supped, and
whom I saw.

Madame Bonaparte passed a week here. She is a charming little woman;
just the size and nearly the figure of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> Burr Alston; by some
thought a little like her; perhaps not so well in the shoulders;
dresses with taste and simplicity (by some thought too free); has
sense, and spirit, and sprightliness. A little of the style and manner
of Susan Smith.
</p><p>
Mrs. Merry  is tall, fair, fat-- 'pas trop', however. No more than a
desirable embonpoint. Much of grace and dignity, ease and
sprightliness; full of intelligence. An Englishwoman who has lived
much in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, and has all that could be wished of the manners of both
countries. An amiable and interesting companion, with whose
acquaintance you will, next summer, be much gratified. She proposes to
pass some time in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.

I want a French translation of the Constitution of the United States,
and, for the purpose, send you a copy in English. It will, I fear, be
a great labour to you; but I cannot get it done here, and it may not
be useless to you to burnish up your French a little. Do you ever hear
from Natalie? I have not yet written to her. How scandalous.
</p><p>
You do not say whether the boy knows his letters. I am sure he may now
be taught them, and then put a pen into his hand, and set him to
imitate them. He may read and write before he is three years old.
This, with speaking French, would make him a tolerably accomplished
lad of that age, and worthy of his blood.
</p><p>
A most bitter cold day. 'Bon jour'.
