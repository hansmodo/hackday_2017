It is several days since I wrote to you, and many more since I
received a letter from you. That from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a> is still the last.
</p><p>Gamble's" protegée could not be found. You will probably gain by the
exchange. That whom I shall send you is a good, steady-looking animal,
_agée vingt trois'. From appearance, she has been used to count her
beads and work hard, and never thought of love or finery. The enclosed
recommendation of Madame Dupont, the elder, will tell you more. You
are in equal luck with a cook. I have had him on trial a fortnight,
and he is the best I ever had in the house; for cakes, pastry, and
jimcracks, far superior to Anthony. In short, he is too good for you,
and I have a great mind not to send him; you will be for ever giving
good dinners. He has something of the manner and phisiognomy of Wood,
your teacher. 'M'lle la femme de chambre and Monsieur le Cuisinier_
are both pure French (not creole), and speak well the language. He
will take with him a quantity of casseroles and other implements of
his etat. They will be shipped off next week.

The sale of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill is all off; blown up at the moment of
counting the money, partly by whim and partly by accident; something
else will be done to produce the effect. I go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, in two
or three days; but shall return, and not set off for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a> till
near Christmas. Mrs. A.'s health is much improved. God bless thee.
