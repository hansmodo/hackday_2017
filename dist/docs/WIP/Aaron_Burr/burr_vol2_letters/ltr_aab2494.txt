</p><p>
I have been greatly flattered by the applauses bestowed on your speech
at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a>. Send me half a dozen copies. Why have you not already
done it?
</p><p>
The papers herewith enclosed will show you our possession of
Louisiana, and the manner of it. The Spanish government will endeavour
to limit our west bounds to the Mississippi, with the addition of the
Island of Orleans only; on this consideration that government would
still hold on the west bank of the Mississippi, from the river
Iberville to the 31st degree of latitude, an extent of one hundred
miles.
</p><p>
In attempting to legislate for our newly-acquired territory, it is
doubted whether the Louisianians can be received into the Union
without an amendment to the Constitution. Consider of this. Again, are
they citizens of the United States, or can Congress make them such? A
bill establishing a form of government is now before the Senate; when
it shall have passed that house I will send you a copy. It is at
present in too crude a state to merit your notice.
</p><p>
The newspapers will have informed you that a committee has been
appointed in the House of Representatives to inquire into the official
conduct of Judge Chace. Peters is associated with him, but he is not
the object, and the insertion of his name was accidental. This
inquiry, as is obvious, is with a view to an impeachment. If it result
in an impeachment, and an immediate trial be had, Congress will sit
till May or June. Yours very affectionately,
