Still lingering here, being detained by some trifling, important
concerns of business, for trifles are important in matters of finance;
nothing vexatious, however. That, I hope and believe, is past.
</p><p>
Your anxieties about me evince a sort of sickly sensibility, which
indicates that you are not well. I fear that you are suffering a
debility, arising from climate or other cause, which affects both mind
and body. When you are in health you have no sort of solicitude or
apprehension about me; you confide that, under any circumstances, I am
able to fulfil your expectations and your wishes. Resume, I pray you,
this confidence, so flattering to me, so consoling to yourself, may I
add, so justly founded?
</p><p>
On the 13th I shall leave this for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. There is no reason to
think that I shall this season visit either <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, or New-Jersey.
The plan of summer operations is to go from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, to Fort Pitt
(<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>,), thence through the states on each side of the Ohio. To
visit <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, and the mouth of the Missouri; thence through
Tennessee (where pass a month) to Orleans; and thence, either by water
or land, to the Atlantic coast, not far from Yarnaco or the mouth of
the Waccama. Thus you see that you are the end of all plans, and,
wherever they may begin, the termination is the same. This tour has
other objects than mere curiosity. An operation of business, which
promises to render the tour both useful and agreeable. I may be at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, long enough to receive your answer to this, after which
you must 'surcease' from writing till further advice. You will hear of
me occasionally on my route. Write now, therefore, all you have to
say.

Just at the moment of writing the last word I receive a message from
the president informing me that Dr. Browne may have the office of
secretary of the government of Louisiana (which means the upper
district, whereof <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, is the capital). General Wilkinson is
appointed governor of that territory. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, is on the banks of the
Mississippi, about twenty miles below the mouth of the Missouri. It
contains about two hundred houses, and some very wealthy people. The
inhabitants are French; retain the French manners of the last century;
are said to be hospitable; gay to dissipation; the society polished
and fashionable. All accounts represent the country as remarkably
healthy, fertile, and beautiful. The salary of secretary is, I think,
but eight hundred dollars per annum. Certain contingences, however,
will make it worth about double that sum. Wilkinson and Browne will
suit most admirably as eaters and laughers, and, I believe, in all
other particulars.

Charles Williamson has not returned from Europe, but is hourly
expected. My right of franking letters will cease on the 23d of this
month, so that you are not to expect pamphlets, &c., by the mail. God
bless thee.
