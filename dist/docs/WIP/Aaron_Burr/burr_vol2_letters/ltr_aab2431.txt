<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, November 9, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1801">1801</a>.

This fine day brings me your two letters from Raleigh and
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=fayetteville" rel="city">Fayetteville</a>, 28th and 30th of October. It is quite consoling to find
that you will have taken the precaution to inquire the state of health
before you venture your precious carcass into <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,. A fever
would certainly mistake you for strangers, and snap at two such plump,
ruddy animals as you were when you left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.

You shall have apples, and nuts, and a cook, and 'lucerne' seed. As to
_femme de chambre', I cannot speak with certainty. I have put in
motion the whole French republic on the occasion. Mrs. Kemble's friend
cannot be found. Most probably Madame S. has tortured into Gamble some
name which has not a letter of Kemble or Gamble in it.
</p><p>
Natalie sailed the Thursday after you left town, and she is probably
_now' in Havre with her mother. A letter received from Madame d'Lage
 since Natalie sailed, advises us that she is there waiting for
her, which is indeed most fortunate, and relieves me from a small
portion of the anxiety which I suffer for that charming girl. Yet,
alas! there is room for too much. I expect to see her here within a
year.

Anna wonders you do not write to her. It never occurred to her that
she had not written to you: so she is now occupied, and you may soon
expect at least twenty pages from her indefatigable pen. I am going to
see Board. There is an ancient story of a man who once gave life and
spirit to marble (you may read it in the form of a drama in Rousseau).
Why may not this be done again? The sale of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill goes on, and
will, I believe, be completed within eight days. The price and the
terms are agreed; some little under works retard the conclusion.

Adieu, my dear <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>.
