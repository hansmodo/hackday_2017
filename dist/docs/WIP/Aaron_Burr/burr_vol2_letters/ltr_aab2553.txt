The enclosed paper will show you what is doing here. The subject of
convention is about to divide this state into new and inveterate
parties. The old names and the old animosities of federal and
republican will be lost, but the passions will have full scope in the
new.

I am not wholly free from apprehension that you take no interest in
any thing but a rice-field. Fame says that you are about to degenerate
into a mere planter. If so, it is to be lamented that you have any
thing above common sense, and that you have learned any thing more
than to read and write, for all above common sense and school
education spoils the planter.

Though in my former letters I did not, in express terms, inform you
that I was under ostracism, yet it must have been inferred. Such is
the fact. In <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, I am to be disfranchised, and in New-Jersey
hanged. Having substantial objections to both, I shall not, for the
present, hazard either, but shall seek another country. You will not,
from this, conclude that I have become passive, or disposed to submit
tamely to the machinations of a banditti. If you should you would
greatly err.----and his clan affect to deplore, but secretly rejoice
at and stimulate the villanies of all sorts which are practised
against me. Their alarm and anxiety, however, are palpable to a degree
perfectly ridiculous. Their awkward attempts to propitiate reminds one
of the Indian worship of the evil spirit. God bless you ever.
