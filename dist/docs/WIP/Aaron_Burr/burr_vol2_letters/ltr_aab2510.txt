I hasten to acknowledge your long, interesting, and beautiful letter
of the 14th. It is received this morning, and finds me in the midst of
occupations connected with the approaching election: of course, every
moment interruptions.

The History of Frederic II. will amuse you. You will read Montesquieu
with interest and instruction. Yet he has a character--I mean that his
'Esprit des Loix_" has a character above its merit. His historical
facts are, nevertheless, collected and arranged with judgment, and his
reasoning is ingenuous. The political dogmas are not, however, to be
received as axioms. They are neither founded on experience nor on a
knowledge of human nature.
</p><p>
You improve greatly in your style and manner of writing. A little more
pains and a little more reading, and you will exceed Lady Mary W.
Montague. Practice, however, is indispensable. The art of writing is
an acquirement, as much as music or dancing.

Since the 3d I have vainly endeavoured to get a minute to write to
you. It will not, I fear, be possible before the 30th inst., when, or
soon after, I hope to be in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, whence you will hear from
me. As you have a great taste for mischief, I send you a new paper 
established in this city, by whom edited unknown. Some of the numbers
are allowed to have wit. Whether these have any I know not. God bless
thee.
