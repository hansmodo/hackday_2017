TO THOMAS MORRIS.

<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, September 18, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1801">1801</a>.

Mr. Vanderlyn, the young painter from Esopus, who went about six years
ago to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=paris" rel="city">Paris</a>, has recently returned, having improved his time and
talents in a manner that does very great honour to himself, his
friends, and his country; proposing to return to France in the spring,
he wishes to take with him some American views, and for this purpose
be is now on his way through your Country to Niagara. I beg your
advice and protection. He is a perfect stranger to the roads, the
country, and the customs of the people, and, in short, knows nothing
but what immediately concerns painting. From some samples which he has
left here, he is pronounced to be the first painter that now is or
ever has been in America. Your affectionate friend,
</p><p>
