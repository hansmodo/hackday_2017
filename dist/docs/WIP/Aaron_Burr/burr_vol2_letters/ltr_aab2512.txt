What nice, pretty paper. I verily believe that it would not have
entered into my head to write to you; but 'Peet' or 'Peter' just
brought in a ream of paper so handsome looking, that it tempted me to
write, and 'chose' being generally uppermost in my mind, of course it
will be addressed to 'chose', though, for aught that yet appears, it
will suit as well 'quelque autre chose'.
</p><p>
I, too, write in a storm; an election storm, of the like you have once
been a witness. The thing began yesterday, and will terminate
to-morrow. My headquarters are in Johnstreet, and I have, since
beginning this letter, been already three times interrupted.
</p><p>
A very modest and amiable proposition! that I should ride sixteen
hundred miles to see a couple of 'varmins'. As to your system of
economy, I should rejoice at it if I believed it; but I well know that
you will spend double at the Mills that you would here. Now for my
plan, which is to be submitted to the judgment and the 'feelings' of
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>.
</p><p>
You take <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill; bring no horse nor carriage. I have got a
nice, new, beautiful little chariot, made purposely to please you. I
have also a new coachee, very light, on an entire new construction,
invented by the vice-president. Now these two machines are severally
adapted to two horses, and you may take your choice of them. Of horses
I have five; three always and wholly at your devotion, and the whole
five occasionally. Harry and Sam are both good coachmen, either at
your orders. Of servants there are enough for family purposes.
Eleonore, however, must attend you, for the sake of the heir apparent.
You will want no others, as there are at my house <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a>, Nancy, and a
small girl of about eleven. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> may bring a footman. Any thing
further will be useless; he may, however, bring six or eight of them,
if he like. The cellars and garrets are well stocked with wine, having
had a great supply last fall. I shall take rooms (a house, &c.) in
town, but will live with you as much or as little as you may please
and as we can agree; but my establishment at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill must
remain, whether you come or not. Great part of the summer I shall be
off eight or ten days at a time, but no long journeys. You will have
to ride every day or two to Montalto to direct the laying out of the
grounds, &c.
</p><p>
In this way you cannot, without wanton extravagance, expend more than
four hundred dollars. If you insist on bringing your horses, there is
now room for them, and plenty of provender. You ought to come by
water, but not to be swindled again by taking a cabin. Bring your Ada,
if you please, to finish her education.
</p><p>
Tell <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> that I ordered my booksellers to open a correspondence
with him, and to send out, by way of sample, and under the advice of
M'Kinnon, not to exceed the value of fifty guineas. M'Kinnon writes me
that the articles will be here by the first or before the middle of
June, shipped for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,.
</p><p>
I forgot to speak of the election. 
</p><p>
Both parties claim majorities, and there never was, in my opinion, an
election, of the result of which so little judgment could be formed.
A. B. will have a small majority in this city 'if to-morrow should be
a fair day', and not else.
</p><p>
You may wonder how I live and mean to live in town. Peter and Alexis
are all my attendants. My breakfast is made 'a la garcon_: dinners,
&c., from a neighbouring eatinghouse. Adieu.
