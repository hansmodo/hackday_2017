<p>
TO NATALIE.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, July 5, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1802">1802</a>.
</p><p>
Your letter of the 22d of February, announcing your intended marriage,
is this minute received. Nothing could be more grateful to me than
your proposed connexion with Mr. Sumter. I know little of him
personally, but his reputation and standing in society fully justify
your choice, and I pray you to assure him that I shall most cordially
take him to my bosom as a son. With his father I have been long
acquainted, and always greatly respected him. We were fellow-soldiers
during our revolutionary war, in which he acted a most distinguished
part, though we were not then known to each other. We served together
some years in Congress, and laboured in the same party. These
circumstances never fail to generate attachments, and I am truly happy
in being more closely allied to him.
</p><p>
I perceive, and with pleasure, that I shall pass much of my time in
South Carolina, and shall divide it between you and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>; but the
mountains are my favourite residence. Which is my favourite daughter I
have not yet been able to decide. We must not, however, abandon
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. I will have you both here, if possible, every year, and at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill you shall renew the recollection of the happy hours of
your childhood.
</p><p>
I have been long impatient, my dear Natalie, to write you on this
subject, but I waited for advice from yourself. I was mortified to
learn from common report 'only' an event so nearly interesting, and
which I had supposed you would have communicated to me the first. Your
letter, however, has been long in America, and has travelled nearly
two thousand miles in pursuit of me, having come in this morning from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,.
</p><p>
I arrived here on the 23d with <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, her boy--a most lovely boy,
and her sister, Lady Nisbett, who salutes you as a sister, and longs
to embrace you. We had a most charming passage of seven days.
</p><p>
This is a great holyday. We are celebrating, with show and much noise,
the 4th of July. This may appear to you a little ridiculous when you
look at the date of this letter; but, 'madame', please to look at your
almanac, and you will see that yesterday was Sunday. I should not have
attempted to write to you amid so much bustle; but the good Mr.
Arcambal came in just as I received your letter, and informed me that
there was an immediate and safe opportunity to France, and I was
impatient to express to you and your husband my participation in your
joys, and hearty approbation of your union. God bless you, my dear
child.

</p><p>
P.S. I have not received a line from your mamma in some years. I am
not at all surprised at her repugnance to your marriage with a
democrat, the son of a rebel. She must hate, above all things,
democrats and rebels. But tell her, as doubtless you have told her a
thousand times, that she is wrong; and that we are not like your
French democrats. Encore, adieu.
