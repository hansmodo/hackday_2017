Your letter of the 16th of April had better luck than that other of
the 1st.; on the road, I mean, for the reception of both was equally
kind. The last arrived yesterday. I do not remember exactly what it is
about, and it is on my table in the library up stairs, and I am
writing in the dining-room beside a good fire on this evening of the
first of May. Now 'madame pour quelque chose tres interessante'.
</p><p>
How limited is human foresight! How truly are we the sport of
accident. To-morrow I had proposed to visit Celeste, and now, alas!
_cetera desunt'.
</p><p>
La G. may be forty-one. Something of the style and manners of 'la
tante de La' R. Is about as silly; talks as much, and as much
nonsense; is certainly good-tempered and cheerful; rather comely,
abating a flat chest; about two inches taller than <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>. Things
are not gone to extremities; but there is danger--poor gampy.
</p><p>
The election is lost by a great majority: 'tant mieux'. It does not
appear possible that I should make you a visit; even if La G. should
not prevent it, which ought to be hoped, some other thing of like kind
will.

Tell Natalie that I have just now received her letter, which she
acknowledges to be in answer to 'four of mine'. Of the boy you have
been remarkably reserved in your two last letters. I conclude,
however, that he cannot be dead, as you would, probably, have thought
that a circumstance worthy of being mentioned, at least in a
postscript. Now Natalie has written me a whole page about her girl,
for which I am very grateful.
</p><p>
What would you bet that La G. is not in a kind of quandary just now?
Gods! what a pathetic love-scene it will make if it shall go on.
Adieu.
