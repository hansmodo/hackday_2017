Another parlementaire is preparing in this port, and 'ma bonne amie'
and Natalie are again preparing to sail; but you may rest assured that
they will not go. Their preparations are evidently mere form, and they
are ready to yield to gentle persuasion. Yet you must not delay your
voyage hither, to aid, if necessary.
</p><p>
But, for a reason much more weighty, you must hasten-- 'il faut'. I
want your counsel and your exertions in an important negotiation,
actually commenced, but not advancing, and which will probably be
stationary until your arrival; more probably it may, however, in the
mean time, retrograde. Quite a new subject.
</p><p>
Who should present himself a few days ago but A. Burr Reeve. He has
come, with the consent of his father, to pass some weeks with me--more
astonishment. I have put him in the hands of Natalie. She will find it
a hard job, but she has entered on the duty with great zeal and
confident hopes of complete success.
</p><p>
By the time this can reach you, you will be ready to embark for
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. You will find me in Broadway. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill will remain
vacant till your arrival. Adieu.
