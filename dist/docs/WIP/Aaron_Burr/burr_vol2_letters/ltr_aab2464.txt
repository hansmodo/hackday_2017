<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, October 15, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1802">1802</a>.
</p><p>
In my letter of yesterday I said nothing of your son. He is well, and
growing as you could wish. If I can see without prejudice, there never
was a finer boy.
</p><p>
Of yourself I have a good deal to say; more than I can find time to
write, and some things which cannot be written. Except the little
practical knowledge which you may have gained by mingling with your
committee-men, &c., your summer and autumn have, I perceive, been
lost--lost, I mean, as to literary acquirements. From your companions,
I presume, little is to be gained save the pastime of a social hour.
Yet time goes on, and you have much to do.
</p><p>
To the execution of any project, however, health is a sine qua non.
Whether you can ever enjoy it in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, or on Sullivan's Island
has become a problem in my mind. I was quite shocked with your wan
appearance when I first met you last spring. How different from that
which you took hence the fall preceding. With every advantage
attainable in your climate, you have scarcely been free from fever
during the season. This cannot fail to debilitate both mind and body.
If these hazards are to be annually encountered with similar effects,
and worse may be apprehended, it is a price far beyond the value of
any benefits which <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, can offer. The 'mountains', a more
_Northern latitude', or the 'grave', must be your refuge. Pray think
of these things. If I should not go to South Carolina this fall, nor
you come hither, let us meet in Washington next winter. After the
rising of your legislature, you may find time for that journey. But I
should prefer to see you here immediately after your election, if
there be time for your return before the session of the legislature.
Your health must require this change. 'Here' you may freeze out all
your "miasmata" and surplus bile in ten days, and go to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=columbia" rel="city">Columbia</a> with
nerves well strung and blood well purified.
</p><p>
My solicitude for your frequent appearance in courts is 'no way_
diminished. The applause which I heard bestowed upon you sunk into my
heart. I could distinguish that which you merited from the fulsome
eulogy which was uttered through politeness. Your talent for writing
is enviable, and, with cultivation, will be unrivalled (nothing
without cultivation, remember). No one wishes so ardently as I do, not
even you, that these advantages should be improved. But these
considerations are unimportant compared with those which regard your
health.
</p><p>
If you should leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, give special orders about your
letters, for I may write what I should wish no one but you to see.
Affectionately adieu.
