This is only to assure you that I am in perfect health. That <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">General Jackson</a> is my good friend; that I have had no duel nor quarrel with
anybody, and have not been wounded or hurt.

Jerome Bonaparte, wife, maids of honour (Miss Spear 'et al'.), &c.,
&c., will be here to-morrow. There are various opinions about the
expediency, policy, decency, propriety, and future prospects of this
match. I adhere to Mrs. Caton. To be sure the French laws say
something on this subject. As you are a learned lady, I will not say
what; but, if you avow ignorance, you shall have all I know: not in my
next, for Annapolis is yet on hand. Indeed, matters thicken so fast,
that I may possibly leave this within twenty days to go northward,
without saying a word about it. I hope the shawl (or cloak) has
arrived safe, and that it may be so displayed as to add beauty to
grace and grace to beauty.
