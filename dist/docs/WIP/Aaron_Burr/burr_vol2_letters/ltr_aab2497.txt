<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, January 25,<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1804">1804</a>.
</p><p>
Your safe arrival, my dear Natalie, gave me the greatest joy.
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> has given me a detailed account of yourself and your lovely
little girl. All as I could wish. I could never realize that you were
not lost to me till I heard that you were actually on American ground.
Your letter relieved my anxieties and fulfilled my hopes, by assuring
me of your unabated affection. But when or where, I pray, are we to
meet? Engage Mr. Sumter to come and pass the summer with me at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,; by the summer I mean from the 1st of May till the middle of
November. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> has told you that I am wholly at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=richmond" rel="city">Richmond</a> Hill,
and that her house is only five miles off. You will review with
pleasure the scenes of your sportive childhood, and you will gratify
the fondest wishes of your affectionate friend and father,

</p><p>
P. S. I enclose some papers for the amusement of your husband. Pray
present them to him with the assurance of my respectful and
affectionate regard. You, too, my dear Natalie, will read with
instruction and amusement the account of Louisiana.
