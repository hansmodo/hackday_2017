Having been shivering with cold all day, though in perfect health, I
have now, just at sunset, had a fire in my library, and am sitting
near it and enjoying it, if that word be applicable to any thing done
in solitude. Some very wise man, however, has exclaimed,
</p><p>
  "Oh! fools, who think it solitude to be alone."
</p><p>
This is but poetry. Let us, therefore, drop the subject, lest it lead
to another on which I have imposed silence on myself.

You may recollect, and, if you do not, your husband will, that he has
several times requested me to open a correspondence between him and my
bookseller in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=london" rel="city">London</a>. To introduce the thing, I desired Mr. White to
send with my next parcel of books a parcel for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, not
exceeding the value of fifty guineas, and referred him to Mr. M'Kinnon
for instructions. The books came out accordingly, and, with respect to
my box, all was smooth and fair; but it was alleged by the owners of
the ship and by the captain, that the box for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>, having been
irregularly shipped, occasioned the seizure and detention of the ship,
and the owners refused to deliver the box unless I would pay thirty
guineas damages. This I declined, and the box was taken to the
custom-house, where it has lain these six weeks unopened. After the
expiration of nine months it will be opened, and the contents sold at
auction by order of the officers of the customs. I shall write to the
bookseller, Mr. White, to employ his own agent here to look to the box
as his property. This trifling tale would not have been told but to
show <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> that I really have made an attempt to establish a
correspondence for him.

You ought to be collecting a few books for your own use. One way of
forming a small library, and which I recommend to you, is to note down
the title of every book which, either from its reputation or from
perusal, you may wish to possess. Make you a small memorandum book for
this purpose. If they be written on loose scraps, by the time you get
a dozen eleven of them will be lost. I recommend to you a new
publication called the Edinburgh Review. One number is issued every
three months. The plan of the editors differs from that of similar
works in that they give more copious extracts, and notice only books
of merit or 'reputation'.

I wait impatiently for some of your tales. No hasty scrawls, madam,
for I will correct nothing. We have now here three shiploads of South
Carolinians, who all find the weather intolerably hot, though I have
slept under a blanket every night except one in all June.

Jerome Bonaparte has taken Belvidere for the season. The two French
frigates remain here blockaded. C. C. says you are a good-for-nothing,
lazy ****** (I really cannot write her words; they are too dreadful,
and must be left to your imagination to supply), because you never
write to her, nor even answer her letters. I assented to all this.
</p><p>
All strangers go to see Montalto as one of the curiosities or beauties
of the island. Your last letter is dated the 31st of May, whence I
conclude that you submit to the labour of writing to me once a
fortnight only.
