Your letters of the 21st and 25th July are just now received, and I
have barely time to read them and transmit your orders to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,
about Montalto.
</p><p>
My plan is to visit the Floridas for five or six weeks. I have desired
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> to consult you whether there be any healthy point within a
hundred miles or so of St. Simons at which we might meet. Might I
safely travel through your low country at this season?
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> fat and the boy pale are bad omens. For God's sake, or
rather for theirs, your own, and mine, hurry them off to the
mountains. I could, perhaps, as easily find you there as elsewhere.
Warrants have been issued in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>, against all those charged with
an agency in the death of General Hamilton, but no requisition or
demand has been made by the governor of that state on this or any
other, nor does it seem very probable that such demand will be
immediately made.

I am negotiating to get an assurance from authority that I shall be
bailed, on receipt of which I shall surrender.

The eastern republicans take part against the calumniators in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. Swartwout is now here. He thinks the tide has already turned
in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. You had better open a correspondence with him.
