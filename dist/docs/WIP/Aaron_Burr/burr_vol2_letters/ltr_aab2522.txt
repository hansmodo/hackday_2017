Having lately written my will, and given my private letters and papers
in charge to you, I have no other direction to give you on the subject
but to request you to burn all such as, if by accident made public,
would injure any person. This is more particularly applicable to the
letters of my female correspondents. All my letters, and copies of
letters, of which I have retained copies, are in the six blue boxes.
If your husband or any one else (no one, however, could do it so well
as he) should think it worth while to write a sketch of my life, some
materials will be found among these letters.
</p><p>
Tell my dear Natalie that I have not left her any thing, for the very
good reason that I had nothing to leave to any one. My estate will
just about pay my debts and no more--I mean, if I should die this
year. If I live a few years, it is probable things may be better. Give
Natalie one of the pictures of me. There are three in this house; that
of Stewart, and two by Vanderlyn. Give her any other little tokens she
may desire. One of those pictures, also, I pray you to give to Doctor
Eustis. To Bartow something--what you please.
</p><p>
I pray you and your husband to convey to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> the small lot, not
numbered, which is the fourth article mentioned in my list of
property. It is worth about two hundred and fifty dollars. Give her
also fifty dollars in cash as a reward for her fidelity. Dispose of
Nancy as you please. She is honest, robust, and good-tempered. Peter
is the most intelligent and best-disposed black I have ever known. (I
mean the black boy I bought last fall from Mr. Turnbull.) I advise
you, by all means, to keep him as the valet of your son. Persuade
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> to live with you if you can.
</p><p>
I have desired that my wearing apparel be given to Frederic. Give him
also a sword or pair of pistols.
</p><p>
Burn immediately a small bundle, tied with a red string, which you
will find in the little flat writing-case--that which we used with the
curricle. The bundle is marked '"Put.'
</p><p>
The letters of 'Clara' (the greater part of them) are tied up in a
white handkerchief, which you will find in the blue box No. 5. You may
hand them to Mari, if you please. My letters to Clara are in the same
bundle. You, and by-and-by Aaron Burr Alston, may laugh at 'gamp' when
you look over this nonsense.
</p><p>
Many of the letters of 'Clara' will be found among my ordinary
letters, filed and marked, sometimes '"Clara"', sometimes "L."
</p><p>
I am indebted to you, my dearest <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a>, for a very great portion
of the happiness which I have enjoyed in this life. You have
completely satisfied all that my heart and affections had hoped or
even wished. With a little more perseverance, determination, and
industry, you will obtain all that my ambition or vanity had fondly
imagined. Let your son have occasion to be proud that he had a mother.
Adieu. Adieu.

I have directed that the flat writing-case and the blue box No. 5,
both in the library, be opened only by you. There are six of these
blue boxes, which contain my letters and copies of letters, except
those two clumsy quarto volumes, in which letter-press copies are
pasted. They are somewhere in the library. The keys of the other five
boxes are in No. 5.
</p><p>
It just now occurs to me to give poor dear Frederic my watch. I have
already directed my executors here to give him my wearing apparel.
When you come hither you must send for Frederic, and open your whole
heart to him. He loves 'me' almost as much as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> does; and he
does love 'you' to adoration.
</p><p>
I have just now found four packets of letters between 'Clara and
Mentor' besides those in the handkerchief. I have thrown them loose
into box No. 5. What a medley you will find in that box!
</p><p>
The seal of the late General <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, which you will find in the
blue box No. 5, was given to me by Mr. and Mrs. Law. You may keep it
for your son, or give it to whom you please.
</p><p>
Assure Mrs. Law of my latest recollection. Adieu. Adieu.
