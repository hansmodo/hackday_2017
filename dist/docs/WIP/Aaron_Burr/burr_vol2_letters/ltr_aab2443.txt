I have just received a pretty little letter from C. C., all on nice,
pretty figured paper, such as you love, and she talks a great deal
about you; the substance of it is, that you are an ugly, little, lazy,
stupid, good-for-nothing knurle, and that she is very sorry she ever
wrote you a line. I can't vouch for the very words, but I think this
is a fair abridgment of that part of her letter which concerns T. B.
A. I wish you would teach half a dozen of your negroes to write; then
you might lay on the sofa, and, if you could submit to the labour of
thinking and dictating, the thing would go on.

We make a pleasant society here, so that one may get through the
winter without ennui. I live at Mr. Law's, not nominally, but in fact.
Mrs. Madison is distant one mile. Anna Payne  is a great belle.
Miss Nicholson  ditto, but more retired; frequently, however, at
Mrs. Law's. But pray, miss (madam), as to busts and statues, all the
B.'s being out of the question, is there nothing in this line to be
found in South Carolina? I suppose it never came into your head to
think or inquire. Pray shake your little noddle, to give the brains,
if any there be, a little action; but who can do two things at once?
That's true. I forgive thee all thy sins, without any further penance
than that which you have imposed on yourself. But write C. and poor
little Anna, to congratulate her. Tell her what a fine fellow I learn
her husband is. Mrs. Anna Constable Pierpont.

We have a perpetual summer here. I am weary of it, though, in truth, I
care nothing about it. With you it must be burning hot.

The cook had only <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> to aid him; but as <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=peg" rel="met">Peggy</a> is equal to about
forty South Carolina Africans, he is very reasonable if he asks only
thirty-five, and ought to be indulged. Your maid will make a miserable
housekeeper, and be spoiled as femme de chambre, which last character
is, I take it, the more important one. The poem or elegy is not sent,
and is not forgotten. I am now going to smoke a segar and pray for
you.
