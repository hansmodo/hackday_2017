SIR,
</p><p>
Immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 15th of February, I
wrote to Mr. Madison for the information you desired. It affords me
great pleasure to learn that you are engaged in a literary pursuit so
congenial with your taste and your talents. If I can in any way
promote your views in this or in any other instance, I entreat that
you will command me, 'without apology'. I have now the satisfaction to
enclose you Mr. Madison's answer, which I this day received.
</p><p>
You speak of a letter written to me some time ago-on the subject of
Captain Ingraham's voyage. It is impossible, sir, that I can have been
guilty of so gross an inattention as to have permitted a letter from
you to have remained unnoticed. I have no recollection of that which
you mention, and am persuaded that it never came to hand.
</p><p>
Allow me to repeat the assurance of the very great consideration and
respect with which I am
</p><p>
Your obedient servant,
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=aab" rel="me">A. BURR</a>.
