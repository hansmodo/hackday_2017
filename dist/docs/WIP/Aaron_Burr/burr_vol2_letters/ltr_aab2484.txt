<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=washington" rel="city">Washington</a>, December 4, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1803">1803</a>.
</p><p>
I arrived this afternoon, and found here your three letters from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a>, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lumberton" rel="city">Lumberton</a>, and Georgetown. The last is dated the 2d of
November. How very long ago. These letters are very satisfactory,
except on the article of your health; of that you must speak a little
more plainly. How long are you to stay in <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>,? Without knowing
this, I am at a loss where to address you. I shall conclude that you
will remain there till the return of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a> from the legislature.
</p><p>
The manner of your letters pleases me "prodigiously." There is ease,
good sense, and sprightliness. That from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=petersburgh" rel="city">Petersburgh</a> merits still
higher encomium. Tell dear little 'gampy' that I have read over his
letter a great many times, and with great admiration. Mrs. Law, to
whom I showed it, thinks it a production of genius.
</p><p>
That good and ill fortune never come in single strokes, but in
sequences, you have heard since you were four years old. Since we
parted I have been almost daily surprised by some pleasant occurrence
or discovery of a personal nature. I pray it may continue a little
longer; even till a bust is found and obtained.
</p><p>
Mrs. Law was vexed and mortified beyond measure at missing you. She
has bid me say more things than this sheet would hold. The Misses
Butler are all here. I shall see them to-morrow. Mary Allen, that was,
now Mrs. Livingston; that beautiful little Miss Gray, whom we saw in
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=Boston" rel="city">Boston</a>; she became Mrs. Dobel, then a widow, and now Mrs. Payne.
</p><p>
At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>, Mrs. Lenox and K. almost quarrelled with me for your
passing their gate without calling. They had made some preparation,
and, in good faith, desired your visit. Miss Boadley, too, talked of
you with great interest. At <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=wilmington" rel="city">Wilmington</a>, I saw no one of your
acquaintance; nor at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=baltimore" rel="city">Baltimore</a>, except Susan Smith, who is there on a
visit from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=princeton" rel="city">Princeton</a>.
</p><p>
To go back to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=new york" rel="city">New-York</a>,. All things are much as you left them, except
that what regards gamp is a good deal better. Mrs. Laight, and child,
and sisters all in good condition and in high spirits. Have already
been dancing--I believe twice. At Mrs. General G.'s I met by accident
Mrs. Rogers. She is a pleasant, cheerful, comely woman, to appearance
not past thirty-eight or forty. You know we had heard otherwise.
Eustis has sprained his ankle, which puts him, for the present, out of
the gay world. I have not been abroad except to dine with Mrs. L. I am
rejoiced at what you tell me of La Gree.
</p><p>
Pray take immediately in hand some book which requires attention and
study. You will, I fear, lose the habit of study, which would be a
greater misfortune than to lose your head. M'Kinnon has sent me out a
beautiful picture of the celebrated Madame Ricammier. It is a good
deal like your pretty widow, Mrs. Wright. 'Bon soir'.
