</p><p>
So you arrived on the 24th, after a passage of ten days; you and the
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=charleston" rel="city">Charleston</a>, packet on the same day. All this I learned last night; not
from you. Vanderlyn and I drank a bottle of Champagne on the occasion.
</p><p>
Though this relieves me from the great anxiety under which I laboured,
still there are many details of your passage, your arrival, &c., on
which nothing but your letter can satisfy me. For some unknown reason,
the mail is now eighteen days on the road.
</p><p>
Vanderlyn has finished your picture in the most beautiful style
imaginable. When it was done, he exclaimed with enthusiasm, "There is
the best work I have ever done in America."
</p><p>
Your letter must be addressed to Washington. The dear little boy, I
hope, made a good sailor. Adieu.
