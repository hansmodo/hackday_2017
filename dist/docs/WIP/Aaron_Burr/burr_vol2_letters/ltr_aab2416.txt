This will be handed you by Mr. Brown,  secretary to General
Hamilton. By the two preceding mails I had nothing from you; by that
of this day I am again disappointed. I do indeed receive a very
pleasant little letter, but I expected a volume. Would it be an
intolerable labour, if, precisely at half past nine o'clock every
evening, you should say, "I will now devote an hour to papa?" Or even
half an hour. Your last letter, though not illy written, has evident
marks of haste.

I agree entirely with your eulogium on our amiable friend; but one
point you overlook. Her heart is as cold as marble, And you mistake
the effusions of politeness, mingled with respect, for symptoms of
tender emotions.

The argument of the cause of Le Guen is concluded. I fear that I must
wait for the final decision of the court before I can leave <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=albany" rel="city">Albany</a>.
To-morrow I go with John to Schenectady. I am more impatient to return
than I can express.
