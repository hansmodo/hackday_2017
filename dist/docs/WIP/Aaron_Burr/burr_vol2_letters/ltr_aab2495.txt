Dear Sir,
</p><p>
I thank you for the letter and the newspaper; for a short letter too,
written on your return from Lancaster, which has not yet been
answered.
</p><p>
It is seriously my intention to visit you next week, if I can get
away, which will depend a little on the state of business in Senate.
The association of Peters with Chace was, I believe, accidental. It
was moved (I think by one of your members), and, as they sat together
on the bench, it was not, at the time, seen how they could be
separated. I presume it affords him a new subject for wit. On receipt
of this, write me one line, saying when Mr. R. will leave
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=philadelphia" rel="city">Philadelphia</a>,. God bless you.
