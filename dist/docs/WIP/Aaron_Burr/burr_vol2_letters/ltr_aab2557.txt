<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, (Kentucky), May 23, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>.
</p><p>
My journal has grown too big to be sent by mail. I have, therefore,
only to assure you of my health and safety, without entering into any
of those details which you will see anon. Shaw is with me. To-morrow
we pursue our journey by land to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, in Tennessee, and thence
down the Cumberland to Eddyville, where we expect to find our boat,
and intend to go from that place to Orleans in ten days.
</p><p>
Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, on the 29th of May. "One is astonished at the
number of sensible, well-informed, and well behaved people which is
found here. I have been received with much hospitality and kindness,
and could stay a month with pleasure; but General <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">Andrew Jackson</a>.
having provided us a boat, we shall set off on Sunday, the 2d of June,
to navigate down the Cumberland, either to Smithland at its mouth, or
to Eddyville, sixty or eighty miles above, at one of which places we
expect to find our boat, with which we intend to make a rapid voyage
down the Mississippi to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and Orleans.
</p><p>Left <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, on the 3d of June in an open boat. Came down the
Cumberland to its mouth, about 220 miles, in an open boat, where our
ark was in waiting. Reached Massac, on the Ohio, sixteen miles below,
on the 6th. Here found General Wilkinson on his way to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>,. The
general and his officers fitted me out with an elegant barge, sails,
colours, and ten oars, with a sergeant, and ten able, faithful hands.
Thus equipped, I left Massac on the 10th of June, Shaw in company.
</p><p>On the 17th arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, being by water, as estimated, nearly
eight hundred miles from Massac. <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, is a town of three or four
hundred houses; the inhabitants traders and mechanics, but surrounded
by wealthy planters, among whom I have been entertained with great
hospitality and taste. These planters are, many of them, men of
education and refinement; live as well as yours, and have generally
better houses. We are now going through a settled country, and, during
the residue of my voyage to Orleans, about three hundred miles, I
shall take breakfast and dinner each day at the house of some
gentleman on shore. I take no letters of introduction; but, whenever I
hear of any gentleman whose acquaintance or hospitalities I should
desire, I send word that I am coming to see him, and have always met a
most cordial reception.
</p><p>Edward Livingston was married about a fortnight ago to Madame Moreau,
_veuve', lately from St. Domingo, rich in beauty and accomplishments.
I hear so many pleasant things of Orleans, that I should certainly (if
one half of them are verified on inspection) settle down there were it
not for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> and her boy; but these will control my fate.
</p><p>On the 25th of June reached New-Orleans. The lady of your laughing
friend is a charming woman. She was a widow from St. Domingo; 'sans
argent et sans enfants'. Without a single good feature, she is very
agreeable. She is nearly the size and figure of Lady Nesbet. Fair,
pale, with jet black hair and eyes--little, sparkling black eyes,
which seem to be made for far other purposes than those of mere
vision. Ph. Jones is to be married in a few days to a pretty little
American, Miss Brown. The inhabitants of the United States are here
called Americans. I have been received with distinction.
</p><p>The mark of attention with which I have been most flattered is a
letter from the holy sisters, the Ursuline nuns, congratulating me on
my arrival. Having returned a polite answer to this letter, it was
intimated to me that the saints had a desire to see me. The bishop
conducted me to the cloister. We conversed at first through the
grates; but presently I was admitted within, and I passed an hour with
them greatly to my satisfaction. None of that calm monotony which I
expected. All was gayety, 'wit', and sprightliness. Saint A. is a very
accomplished lady. In manners and appearance a good deal like Mrs.
Merry. All, except two, appear to be past thirty. They were dressed
with perfect neatness; their veils thrown back. We had a repast of
wine, fruit, and cakes. I was conducted to every part of the building.
All is neatness, simplicity, and order. At parting, I asked them to
remember me in their prayers, which they all promised with great
promptness and courtesy--Saint A. with earnestness.
</p><p>This city is larger than I expected, and there are found many more
than would be supposed living in handsome style. They are cheerful,
gay, and easy. I have promised to return here next fall. I go on the
10th instant (July) by land to Kentucky, and thence, probably, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>,. 'A la sant√© Madame' Alston, is generally the first toast at
every table I have been. Then we say some evil things of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=joa" rel="met kin colleague">Mr. Alston</a>.
_Encore', adieu. I will ask Saint A. to pray for thee too. I believe
much in the efficacy of her prayers. 'Le pauvre' A.B.A., I can find
nothing here to send him.
</p><p>Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, on the 6th August. You now see me safe through
the wilderness, though I doubt (hussey) whether you knew that I had a
wilderness to pass in order to get here. Yes, about four hundred and
fifty miles of wilderness. The hospitality of these people will keep
me here till the 12th instant, when I shall partake of a public
dinner, given not to the vice-president, but to A.B. I shall be at
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, on the 19th. I have directed Bradley's new map of the United
States to be sent to you; this will enable you to trace my route, and
I pray you to study the map attentively.
</p><p>I am still at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, (August 13th). For a week I have been
lounging at the house of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=anj" rel="met friend colleague">General Jackson</a>., once a lawyer, after a
judge, now a planter; a man of intelligence, and one of those prompt,
frank, ardent souls whom I love to meet. The general has no children,
but two lovely nieces made a visit of some days, contributed greatly
to my amusement, and have cured me of all the evils of my wilderness
jaunt. If I had time I would describe to you these two girls, for they
deserve it. To-morrow I move on towards <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>,.
</p><p>I ought to tell you how I came hither. It was thus: I embarked in a
little schooner at the mouth of the Bayou St. Jean on Lake
Ponchartrain, and landed on the opposite side of the lake about ten
miles below the mouth of the Chefonti, a traverse of about twenty-five
miles, which I made in six hours. Took a guide, and went on next
morning in a footpath; crossed the Chefonti about four miles above its
mouth, and then turned northerly; crossed the 31st degree of latitude
at forty-two miles from the Mississippi. Note; this line has been
actually run, and marked with great accuracy by commissioners on the
part of the United States and of Spain, as the north bound of the
Floridas and the south bound of the United States, till it strikes the
St. Mary's. You will see on the map. Continued on to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>,. From the
mouth of the Chefonti to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, by this route is about one hundred
and forty miles. I was four days from New-Orleans to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>,. Passed
near a week in the vicinity of <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, and saw some tears of regret
when I left it; but I am 'now' to give you the route; my journal will
give you the incidents.
</p><p>The path from <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, going northward, keeps east of the Yazoo, and,
I think, nearly on the dividing ridge between the waters of the Yazoo
and those of the Tombigbee or Tambeckbee; a vile country, destitute of
springs and of running water--think of drinking the nasty
puddle-water, covered with green scum, and full of animalculae--bah! I
crossed the Tennessee; how glad I was to get on the waters of the
Tennessee; all fine, transparent, lively streams, and itself a clear,
beautiful, magnificent river. I crossed it, I say, forty miles below
the muscle shoals, and three hundred and sixty above its mouth,
reckoning by the meanders of the river. Thence to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, through
the town of Franklin. On the map you will see laid down a road from
<a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=nashville" rel="city">Nashville</a>, to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=natchez" rel="city">Natchez</a>, as having been cut by the order of the minister
of war. This is imaginary; there is no such road.
</p><p>Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=lexington" rel="city">Lexington</a>, on the 20th August, <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?year=1805">1805</a>. Left it for Frankfort,
distant twenty-two miles, on the 31st. I am magnificently lodged at
the house of John Brown, who married your old friend and neighbour
Miss Mason, who is, you know, the sister of 'my friend', the priest
(John Mason). She has two fine boys; the youngest, now four, I find
something like A.B.A., and, of course, amuse myself with him a great
deal. Mrs. Brown is still handsome, and speaks of you with attachment
and respect.
</p><p>My plans for the two next months are now made up, or rather imposed
on me by letters received since I last wrote you, and by my previous
engagements. On the 1st of September I leave this for <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>,. My
route is to <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, 55 miles; Vincennes, on the Wabash, 150 miles;
Kaskaskias, on the Mississippi, 150 miles; <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, 75 miles. These
distances are probably inaccurate, but <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=st. louis" rel="city">St. Louis</a>, is called 450 miles
from this. I propose to be at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=cincinnati" rel="city">Cincinnati</a>, on the 1st of October; at
Chilicothe and Marietta from the 7th to the 15th; at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=pittsburg" rel="city">Pittsburg</a>, about
the 20th, and at Bedford till the 1st of November. If by that time I
should hear nothing from you, shall take measures for going by land or
water to Theoville, so that you see it must be late in November before
I can see you.
</p><p>Arrived at <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?city=louisville" rel="city">Louisville</a>, (Falls of the Ohio) on the 2d of September,
being sixty miles on my way to the Missouri. I have now again one
hundred and fifty miles of wilderness to encounter. I will be at
Berkeley Springs by the 20th of October, where I hope to meet you and
Mari. Address to me at the city of Washington."
