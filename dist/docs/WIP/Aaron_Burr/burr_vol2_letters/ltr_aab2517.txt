The joint and several letter of Natalie and <a href="http://www.familytales.org/results.php?tla=tba" rel="met child">Theodosia</a> was received
yesterday, and will be answered to-morrow or next day. It seems that
you write once a fortnight. Two such idle sluts might find half an
hour daily to give a sort of journal to papa.

Another interview yesterday with La G. One more would be fatal and
final. I shall seek it to-day; 'after which' I will read Moore's
fables, you impudence. My time, till near closing the mail, has been
occupied in writing to your husband. At present I can only thank you
both.
