PREFACE 



THIS biography was written many years ago, 
at the request of the editor's venerable friend, the 
father of Spencer Kellogg Brown. 

Only recently, through interruption of other work, 
has opportunity been found to revise and abridge it 
for publication. 

The editor believes that the letters and journals 
embodied in the book have rare value as sketches 
illustrative of the early history of Kansas and of the 
conduct of part of the war for the suppression of 
the rebellion ; and that they also exhibit many curious, 
amusing, and pathetic phases of American life. 

There are passages in Spencer's journal which will 
seem to some readers of this story not merely boyish 
but trivial. The editor regards these as lines indis- 
pensable to the etching of the boy's character, the 
revelation of which, in its gradual formation, is a 
study as profitable as it is interesting. 

Very reluctantly, of the materials placed at the 
editor's disposal by the friends of the subject of this 
memoir, much the greater part has been omitted from 
the work.

CHAPTER I 

TO INTRODUCE THE BROWNS 

IN Belleville, a hamlet of Jefferson County, New 
York, on the bank of North Sandy Creek, stands an 
attractive stone dwelling-house, the little porch of 
which is shaded by a vigorous climbing plant. Be- 
tween the house and the street are apple-trees, shrub- 
bery, and a small lawn. In the year 1842 this house 
was the home of Mr. Orville Chester Brown, and here, 
on the 17th of August, his eldest son, Spencer Kellogg, 
the subject of this true story, was born. 

Spencer's ancestors were among the original set- 
tlers of Oneida County, New York. His great-grand- 
father removed from Concord, Massachusetts, in the 
year 1792, and, deeming the land which is now the 
site of the city of Utica too low and marshy to be 
healthful, made his home in Litchfield, Herkimer 
County, about eight miles south of that city. He was 
the father of thirteen children. His descendants, in 
1862, numbered more than three hundred. All were 
thrifty and reputable. Even in the days when hard 
cider and whisky were in common use among respecta- 

1 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

ble people in the State of New York, no Brown of this 
stock became a degraded drunkard, or was ever arrest- 
ed for crime. On the other hand, many came to the 
dignity of deacons and ruling elders in Congregational 
and Presbyterian churches, and some were ministers 
of the gospel. 

About the time when the Browns established them- 
selves in Litchfield, the Goulds settled near Utica. 
Philomela Allen Gould married Spencer's grand- 
father, Ephraim Brown. The high character and 
lovely disposition of this Christian woman won for 
her the esteem and affection of all classes of people. 

Orville Chester Brown, son of Ephraim and Philo- 
mela Brown, married, in 1837, Mary Anne, daughter 
of Levi Cozzens. Her mother, daughter of Ezra 
Hovey, was the first white child born in New Hart- 
ford, Oneida County so recently had the red-man 
yielded that neighbourhood to the white settler. The 
Cozzens family had come from Providence, Rhode 
Island. Its descendants are well known in commercial 
circles in central New York. Spencer Kellogg Brown 
was the first son of this marriage. 

It was soon perceived that the child had an ear for 
music. Before he could speak the words, while yet 
he lay in his cradle, he hummed correctly tunes with 
which his mother had been accustomed to sing him to 
sleep. His passion for music increased with his years 
and noticeably affected his life, often determining his 

2 



TO INTRODUCE THE BROWNS 

choice of companions. The singing of hymns at fam- 
ily worship fostered in Spencer's elder sister and in 
himself the taste for music of which so early in child- 
hood they gave evidence. 

In Belleville, on one of the corners where the roads 
most travelled crossed, his father kept a store. Into 
this the little fellow ran, one day, pursued by rough, 
pugnacious boys who had set upon him in the street. 
His father upbraided him for his fear, and charged 
him never again to run, but to face his foes like a 
man. No second lesson to this effect was needed. 

The period of Spencer's childhood followed that 
of the great religious awakening which gave to thou- 
sands of the inhabitants of central and western New 
York a character very earnest and beneficent. ' * Fre- 
quent religious meetings were the attractions of those 
times." Employers willingly closed stores and work- 
shops to allow their helpers to attend week-day ser- 
vices in church or school-house. 

To Belleville, when Spencer was a boy, there came 
agents of the Bible Society, or Tract Society; clerical 
lecturers who advocated the new-born notions as to 
total abstinence from the use of intoxicating drink; 
expounders of theories for the abolition of slavery; 
representatives of missionary societies, and of various 
phases of Christian philanthropy ; and these, all, were 
cordially welcomed to the hospitality of the stone 
house. These men usually brought with them into the 

3 




SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

homes they visited much of the cheerfulness of a buoy- 
ant faith which had been nurtured by good lives and 
clarified by manly exercise on horseback. There was 
a halo about them that seemed, like the rainbow, to 
have come of shower and sunshine. Their conversa- 
tion included stories of interesting adventures, and 
they knew how to speak, on occasion, wise words of 
counsel and comfort. Affable, sympathizing, brave, 
sturdy men most of them were. Any household is the 
better for entertaining such as these. 

Other angels visited the Browns in their Belleville 
home. These came between midnight and morning 
and stayed all day. Through the village lay one of the 
roads travelled by fugitive slaves who were fleeing 
towards refuge in Canada. Mr. Brown's compassion 
for the bondman was well known, and he had the con- 
fidence of those who guided the steps of the runaway. 
Slaves were sheltered by him and forwarded to a place 
of safety. 

The boy's sister, but a little older than himself, 
was his constant companion. Her society was always 
sweet to him. She, too, was devoted to music, was 
imaginative, and dwelt with him in a world created by 
Fancy. Whatever the two read or heard was woven 
as a brilliant pattern into the tapestries by which their 
fairy-land was curtained off from the commonplace 
world of the generality of mankind. 

In the autumn of 1848 Mr. Brown removed to 
4 



Utica, and the next year to New York city. A little 
later he bought a house in Brooklyn, where the family 
lived until 1854. In all these cities the children at- 
tended the public schools. The Bible, Shakespeare, 
and various historical works occupied much of Spen- 
cer's time in the hours when he was not in school. At 
the suggestion of his father he read the whole of the 
Old Testament, and then of the New, and was re- 
warded by the gift of a large and beautiful copy of 
the Scriptures. He could repeat great portions of the 
plays of Shakespeare. 

In the spring of 1854 Mr. Brown took Spencer, one 
of his brothers, and their elder sister to Professor 
Flack's boarding-school in Charlotteville, Schoharie 
County, New York. Their stay here was brief. The 
dormitory in which Spencer had his room was burnt 
to the ground, and his clothing and books, including 
the cherished Bible, were all destroyed. He was 
among strangers. Stripped of everything necessary 
to his comfort, much depressed in spirit, overlooked 
because he was only one among a great number in like 
circumstances, he wandered to the woods. There, 
alone, giving vent to his distress, he was found by Mr. 
"William Britton, an older student. The mature man 
became the boy's good Samaritan. From that hour 
Spencer loved and honoured his benefactor with a sin- 
cerity and constancy of regard that any worthy friend 
would consider a rich reward.

CHAPTER II 

KANSAS AND OSAWATOMIE 

IN October, 1854, Mr. O. C. Brown removed from 
New York to eastern Kansas, which is within the 
bounds of the " Louisiana Purchase," the centennial 
of which the world is about to celebrate at St. Louis. 

By the " Missouri Compromise," adopted in 1820, 
Missouri was admitted to the Union of States with a 
Constitution which permitted slavery, but slavery 
was forever to be barred out of all other States which 
should be formed north of the line 36 30' the lat- 
itude ot the southern boundary of Missouri. 

Notwithstanding this decision, which had stood for 
thirty years, when it became apparent that the free 
States were rapidly increasing in number, power, and 
influence in the Government, while the institution of 
slavery was operating to keep away from the South- 
ern States the great majority of foreign immigrants 
(for poor white men are held in light esteem where 
slavery prevails) ; when it had become clear that only 
a multiplication of the number of slave-labour States 
could prevent the free-labour States from becoming su- 
preme in the government of national affairs ; when it 

6 



KANSAS AND OSAWATOMIE 

had come to be the belief of the statesmen of the South 
that the compact of 1820 interfered with the expan- 
sion of slavery and that even the acquisition of Texas, 
and other territory south of the above-mentioned line, 
including that obtained from Mexico, would not pre- 
serve the balance between the slave-holding and the 
free-labour States ; they set themselves to bring about 
the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. They accom- 
plished their purpose by the passage, in 1854, of the 
" Kansas-Nebraska Bill," which " cut Nebraska in 
halves, styling the southern section Kansas and the 
northern Nebraska, and declared the doctrine that 
' citizens of the United States peopling the Territories 
have plenary jurisdiction over all their domestic insti- 
tutions. ' ' This legislation was adopted for no other 
reason than to make possible the introduction of 
slavery in even such States as thereafter should be or- 
ganized north of latitude 36 30'. Whether such Ter- 
ritories should become slave States or free States was 
to depend upon the vote of the majority within their 
bounds at the time of their admission to the Union. I 
shall not quarrel with the principle here announced 
further than to say that it annulled the covenant to 
which the South had agreed in 1820. 

To make sure that at least one slave-labour State 
should come out of the Territory called Nebraska, 
Kansas was formed from that part adjacent to Mis- 
souri and not distant from Arkansas two slave States. 

7 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

It was presumed that the new Territory would be 
possessed by colonists from these commonwealths. 

On the contrary, men from all parts of the country 
thronged to Kansas and began there that conflict of 
arms soon to be waged in more terrific form on a wider 
field. 

Mr. 0. C. Brown, with many other Northern citi- 
zens of the United States, saw, in 1854, or thought he 
saw, opportunity to better his own estate and at the 
same time help to enlarge the bounds of freedom by 
removing to Kansas. He went, in the first place, with- 
out his family. Concerning his passage to Kansas City 
he wrote : ' ' My first trip from St. Louis was in Octo- 
ber, on the ' Muddy Missouri,' on the steamer Sam 
Cloon. 'A right smart chance ' 1 of emigration from 
all the New England, Middle, and Southern States was 
on the move for the new broad field so recently opened 
for settlement. By distinctive marks the sections of 
the country from which the different members of the 
motley crowd came could readily be identified. The 
Southerners looked upon the Northern people with 
jealous suspicion and listened intently to their frank 
talk about making Kansas a free State ; but no hostility 
was shown but little courtesy. The water was low 
and our trip was tedious. Among the lower deck emi- 
grants the cholera appeared. I worked several hours 
over a Kentuckian with a large family, but he died 
1 Dialect of illiterate class in the Southern States.

and was laid upon the banks of the river in the dark- 
ness of the night. The boat grounded, and I went 
ashore, and for the first time saw negro slaves upon a 
tobacco plantation. I was greatly shocked to see the 
kennels where the poor fellows slept. Each kennel had 
a hole, or opening, two or three feet high, through 
which entrance was gained upon hands and knees. ' ' 

" On the way up the river I became acquainted 
with Colonel Kersey Coates, of Philadelphia, now of 
Kansas City, Missouri, and with Martin F. Conway, of 
Baltimore, who took a prominent part in the early 
struggle. I also met Gaius Jenkins, of Lawrence, 
whom James H. Lane killed in a land-claim contest. 
He was a good and true Kansas man. ' ' 

From Kansas City, Missouri, Mr. Brown, Mr. Will- 
iam Chestnut, and other men from New York and Con- 
necticut, entered the Territory of Kansas and went 
forty-five miles to a tongue of land that lies between 
the Pottawatomie Creek and the Marais des Cygnes 
River, 1 just above their junction. Here they arrived 
October 20, 1854, and here, under the auspices of the 
New England Emigrant Aid Society, Mr. Brown laid 
out the town of Osawatomie. This became the head- 
quarters for the free-State men of the County of Ly- 
kins, organized the next year. In 1861 the name of 
the county was changed to Miami very properly, for 
the district it included was long the land of the Miami

Indians. The vicinity is desirable and beautiful. 
Along the streams are belts of woods half a mile in 
average width. Here grow the hackberry, pin-oak, 
cotton-wood, black-walnut, hickory, and sugar-maple 
trees. A fifth of the area of the country is fertile bot- 
tom-land, through which wind rivers and brooks. The 
upland is undulating. Good water is obtained by 
sinking wells. The geology of the county shows a poor 
quality of coal, in limestone and shale, in the southern 
part, and the upper carboniferous formation farther 
north. Here used to roam the mastodon and the ele- 
phant. From a stream near Osawatomie was taken 
part of a mastodon's jaw, including three great teeth. 
The elephant of that region must have weighed, when 
alive, twice as much as any that now roves in Asia or 
Africa. 

A letter written from Kansas, by an emigrant, in 
May, 1855, mentions Osawatomie. " This place, a 
little over six months since, was the rendezvous of the 
deer and the wolf. Not a house was to be seen, not a 
living soul dwelt here. The settlers came. The treach- 
ery of one, the timidity and fears of others, the jeal- 
ousy and misrepresentations of outsiders, and finally 
the disbanding of a whole party, broke not the spirit 
or purpose of one man 1 who had made up his mind 
to live between the two rivers. This pioneer, after the 
party had disbanded and gone, seven miles from the

nearest Indian stopping-place, . . . with no team, 
having only an axe, cut the first log, and made a claim, 
at dark, October 26, 1854. Thus commenced the his- 
tory of Osawatomie. . . . Now how changed! The 
river banks are cut down to a good crossing ; a regular, 
weekly, four-horse stage [coach] leaves here on Mon- 
days for Kansas City, returning on Thursdays with 
the mail. A good store has been in operation for two 
months. A hotel and boarding-house have been 
opened, a blacksmith 's shop built, a steam-mill is to be 
put up, two good frame-houses have been built and an- 
other one is in process of erection; several lots are 
fenced in with palings ; people are coming and going 
by scores. ' ' 

The name Osawatomie was given to the place by 
Spencer 's father. He composed it from elements found 
in the names of the streams which there flow together. 

" The town is on the south bank of the Osage 
River, forty miles south of the Kansas River, and six- 
teen from the west boundary of Missouri. On the 
south is Pottawatomie Creek, a considerable stream, 
some twenty miles in length, which receives tributaries 
that drain the high prairie in the southwest and 
empties the gathered waters into the Osage one mile 
below the town." " For three miles," adds Mr. 
Brown, " the Osage and Pottawatomie pursue their 
brotherly way on the different sides of the tongue of 
land already mentioned, in the close proximity of 

11 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

about one mile. At one point they are so near as to 
shake hands by means of a belt of the scrub oak that 
skirts both streams. Beyond this the high prairie 
stretches towards the fork below the town. In a prairie 
country timber and water are a first necessity. ' ' These 
streams and their banks furnished an abundant supply 
of both. ' ' For picturesque beauty the country about 
Osawatomie is not excelled by any part of Kansas." 
" The bottom-lands were broad, and rich in timber, 
affording shelter and food for the stock of the early 
settlers. In the streams were fish, and along the banks 
were ducks, turkeys, quail, and an occasional swan. 
The woods were alive with rabbits, and the upland 
was literally swarming with prairie-chickens. 1 Several 
deer gazed at our immigrants when first we crossed 
the Osage. South of the Pottawatomie the prairie 
rises gradually to high table-land skirted by a timbered 
cover."

CHAPTER III 

STRUGGLE AND TRIUMPH IN KANSAS 

IN 1854 the question which most profoundly in- 
terested students of political history in the United 
States concerned the issue of the struggle between 
the Free-Soil and Pro-Slavery parties in Kansas. East 
of that Territory lay Missouri, in the western part of 
which were fifty thousand slaves, worth, at a moderate 
valuation, twenty-five millions of dollars. The South 
bestirred itself to plant colonies in Kansas and Ne- 
braska, and efforts were made to induce slave-holders 
to remove their human chattels, with their other per- 
sonal property, to the new Territories. B. F. String- 
fellow urged upon men prominent in the Government 
at Washington his opinion that two thousand slaves 
ought to be lodged in Kansas in order to make it, 
de facto, a slave State. Few owners of slaves, how- 
ever, were willing to expose them to the hazards of such 
a venture. 

In the free States, societies were formed to en- 
courage anti-slavery men to emigrate to Kansas. The 
settlers were counselled to establish themselves perma- 

13 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

nently in their new homes, and, if married, to take 
their families with them. 

Had the rivalry of parties been limited to honest 
efforts to outnumber and outvote one another, all had 
been well ; but Pro-Slavery men had no idea of accept- 
ing a decision to be reached in this way. Early in July, 
1854, at a meeting held in West Port, Missouri,, it was 
resolved, " That this association will, whenever called 
upon, hold itself in readiness to arrest and remove 
any and all emigrants who go there x under the au- 
spices of the Northern Emigrant Aid Societies. ' ' 

The struggle in Kansas began at the polls on No- 
vember 3, 1854. Missourians invaded the Territory in 
great numbers, overpowered the colonists from the 
North, who had come in good faith to make permanent 
homes on the soil, and, having elected to the Terri- 
torial Legislature by illegal votes a majority of men 
subservient to the will of the Pro-Slavery party, re- 
turned to Missouri in triumph. 

Mr. Brown, recording the incidents of this election, 
mentions that he set out from Osawatomie with a 
number of other settlers. ' ' We met one hundred and 
fifty men," he writes, " mounted, armed, and officered, 
who had voted at ' Dutch Henry's Crossing ' early in 
the morning, and were now on their way back to Mis- 
souri, via Paola, where they voted in the afternoon ! ' ' 
That is to say, three hundred votes for members of the 

1 Into Kansas. 

14 



Legislature of Kansas were cast by one hundred and 
fifty men who, having their residence and citizenship 
in Missouri, had no legal right to vote in Kansas at 
all. 

" The next day," continues Mr. Brown's testi- 
mony, ' ' a protest signed by the legal voters was borne 
over the prairies forty-five miles, by the writer, to 
Governor Reeder the first that reached him. The 
soft breezes were burdened with the Pro-Slavery men 's 
curses against the Governor should he dare to with- 
hold certificates from the members fraudulently elect- 
ed to the Legislature." " These threats had reached 
him. At the Shawnee Mission he sat alone, calm, reso- 
lute, silent, with the knowledge that the Secretary of 
the Territory was in full sympathy with his sworn 
enemies." The Governor " received the protest with 
dignified reserve, which put me on my guard. He ex- 
pressed doubts as to the regularity of its form, but 
assured the bearer that it should receive due considera- 
tion." 

Mr. Brown hurried to Kansas City. Some of the 
" bolder and more experienced leaders " of the Free- 
State party had arrived there from Lawrence. These 
hastened to the Shawnee Mission to defend the person 
of the Governor a Governor appointed, as was the 
Secretary, by the Administration at Washington; 
which, as dependent upon the votes of Southerners 
for continuance in power, was plastic to the will of the 

15 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

South. So it came to pass that one governor after 
another who was expected to pursue in Kansas such 
a policy as would conciliate Pro-Slavery men, took, on 
the contrary, in fidelity to his oath and his duty, a 
course so manly as to give offence to the class of South- 
erners that in those days murdered Abolitionists, and 
burns negroes at the stake in our day. Courtly and 
chivalrous as the best people of the South were and 
are, slavery made the mass of the inhabitants of that 
part of our country less than humane. It was inevitable 
that this should be the case. Women, hardly less than 
men, were biased, as to their judgment of moral ques- 
tions involved in the relations of the races to each 
other. Summary vengeance was to be wreaked upon 
offending black men. White men who openly showed 
their pity for the slave and their disapprobation of 
slavery were beyond the pale of mercy. 

"Already," writes Mr. Brown, " sagacious guards 
were secreted at convenient stations near the Gov- 
ernor's room. A ruffian entered his office, but was 
promptly repulsed by the exhibition of a revolver 
which had lain under a newspaper on the office table. ' ' 

" In the election, twice as many votes were cast 
as there were legal voters domiciled in the Territory. ' ' 
The Legislature constituted by this fraudulent elec- 
tion met at Lecompton and framed a Pro-Slavery Con- 
stitution. Representatives of the Free-State party 
convened at Topeka and prepared a Constitution hos- 

16 



STRUGGLE AND TRIUMPH 

tile to slavery. The latter was acceptable to a majority 
of the legal voters of Kansas. These commonly spoke 
of the Lecompton Assembly as the " Bogus Legisla- 
ture, ' ' and of its enactments as ' ' Bogus Laws. ' ' The 
Constitution devised at Lecompton was disowned 
by the Free-State citizens of the Territory and the 
statutes adopted there were set at defiance. But the 
Administration at Washington threw the weight of its 
influence in Kansas on the side of the Pro-Slavery 
party. United States marshals and the army en- 
forced the iniquitous laws of the illegally chosen Leg- 
islature. 

Lawrence, a town originally settled by a colony 
from New England and named in honour of Amos A. 
Lawrence, of Boston, was pre-eminent as the centre of 
Free-State influence. Early in its history, when only 
one hundred emigrants were settled on the town site, 
living in tents and busily engaged in building houses 
for their families, " Lawrence was visited by two 
hundred and fifty Missourians who camped near the 
canvas village and sent formal notification that the 
' Abolitionists must leave the Territory, never more to 
return to it! ' Time to leave was extended from 10 
o'clock A.M. to 1 P.M. In the meantime the ' Yankees ' 
organized themselves for defence. The ruffians, seeing 
this, stole back, in the night, to Missouri. ' ' 

The Lecompton Assembly adopted an "Act " 
which forbade any one to entice slaves to run away 

17 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

from their masters, affixing the penalty of death for 
transgression. Imprisonment for two years was to be 
the punishment for writing, printing, or publishing 
any denial of the right of persons to hold slaves in 
Kansas ! This law was to take effect on the 15th day 
of September, 1855. On that day the Kansas Tribune, 
edited and published at Lawrence by John Speer, 
printed, on a full page of the newspaper, a challenge 
remarkable for the courageous expression of the spirit 
of freedom. 

On the 21st of November, 1855, Charles W. Dow, 
" a peaceable Free-State man," was murdered by 
Franklin N. Coleman. Jacob Branson was rescued 
from a Sheriff Jones (who was carrying into execution 
the offensive statutes of the contemned Legislature) 
by a band of Free-State men " about equal in number 
to the Sheriff's posse." " Twelve hundred Pro-Sla- 
very" men," writes Mr. Brown, " most of them from 
Missouri, besieged Lawrence. Six hundred Free-State 
men, commanded by Governor Charles Robinson and 
James H. Lane, defended the place. Earthworks were 
thrown up and all preparations were made for a vigor- 
ous resistance. However, a truce was called and the 
Missourians returned to their homes." This was but 
the beginning of what was called ' ' The Border Ruffian 
War." 

It is not my purpose to review here the course of 
events, but only to convey a clear idea of the condition 

18 



STRUGGLE AND TRIUMPH 

of things in Kansas in the years during which that 
Territory was Spencer's home. The period was char- 
acterized by strife, midnight pillage and murder, and 
the burning and sacking of towns. Blood was shed 
on more than one field where battle was waged between 
hostile factions. 

The Free-State party was not always in the right ; 
but Pro-Slavery men began the war when they invaded 
the polls in Kansas, and they were responsible for 
shifting the contest from peaceful competition of 
ballots to bloody battles with bullets. Then, as after- 
ward in the " Great Rebellion," they " sowed the 
wind and reaped the whirlwind." 

To Kansas came bad men from all parts of the 
country to seize the opportunity to ravage and rob. 
Their attachment to one party or the other could not 
sanctify them or justify their crimes. In the end the 
fierce exertions to make Kansas a slave State failed. 
Overwhelming numbers of Northern men poured into 
the field and secured the triumph of Free-State princi- 
ples. Admitted to the Union in 1861, Kansas has be- 
come one of the brightest stars in the American con- 
stellation. Her significant seal bears the appropriate 
memento 

" AD ASTRA PER ASPERA." 1 
1 " To the stars through difficulties."

CHAPTER IV 

REMOVAL. OF MR. BROWN *S FAMILY TO OSAWATOMIE 

IN the spring of 1855 the family of Mr. Brown 
joined him in the new home. Spencer kept a journal 
which was written in a cipher of his own invention. 
Concerning the journey from Utica, New York, to 
Kansas, he writes : 

" Early in April, Mother, myself, Rockwell, Fanny 
and Freddy started for our Western home. In about 
ten days we all landed safely at Kansas City, in Mis- 
souri, where Father met us on the levee and took us to 
the house of Mrs. G , upon the river bank, her hus- 
band being a merchant and the house being over the 
store. After seeing us well settled, Father and Rocky 
started, in a few days, for Osawatomie. I went about a 
week later. We all boarded at Mr. Cronkhite 's. ' ' 

In a letter written in January, 1863, Mr. C. H. 
Crane thus describes Osawatomie and the surrounding 
country as these appeared in March, 1855, a month be- 
fore Spencer's arrival there: " Osawatomie was not 
excepting as a paper town." There were " a few 
hewn logs piled one upon another, inclosing a load of 
groceries, covered with ' duck,' without door, floor,

REMOVAL OF BROWN'S FAMILY 

window, roof, or ' chinking. ' * From that point not a 
human habitation could be seen. John Surpel had a 
' shanty ' on the Pottawatomie, three-fourths of a mile 
away. ' ' 

" Mr. W. Chestnut had a cabin over the swell of 
the prairie, southwest one-half a mile. Morgan Cronk- 
hite had an unfinished cabin one and one-half miles 
southwest in the Pottawatomie timber, 2 where Mr. 
Bishop now lives. Still, he entertained travelers in the 
attic, and stayed there himself. The first floor was 
ground) and was occupied by a horse. Mr. John Carr 
was in a cabin on the next quarter 3 west, with his wife 
and two children. . . . Mr. Adair was where he 
now lives. 0. C. Brown had a cabin on the hill. This 
constituted the suburbs of Osawatomie. On that day, 
the 18th of March, 1855, all else was wild as the native 
Indian. ' ' 

I presume that the boarding- and lodging-place of 
Mr. O. C. Brown and his sons, in May, 1855, was that 
same unfinished cabin of Morgan Cronkhite. Perhaps 
opportunity had been found to make room for the 
horse elsewhere, and to put a puncheon floor above 
the earth. An interesting fragment a romance writ-

ten by Spencer after he had lived a few years in 
Kansas begins with paragraphs that must have been 
suggested by his own experience. The hero of his 
story, a young man, says : 

" I never had a friend except my father. We 
moved out to Kansas and settled upon one hundred 
and sixty acres of land. All the fall and winter we 
laboured hard fencing a part of it, and in the spring 
broke and planted a few acres. We raised enough 
that year to support us through the winter and to get 
more land broken in the spring. All winter we were 
employed in building a log-house (using ' shakes ' for 
the roof, which was held on, without nails, by long 
logs) and in splitting puncheons for the floor." 

I return to Spencer's journal. " Mother remained 
in Kansas City until after the birth of my youngest 

sister, in May, at the house of Mrs. W , a very 

kind-hearted lady whose husband was a merchant. 
Such was the rush of emigrants to Kansas, even at that 
early time, that all who had room had to open their 
doors to the crowds landing from every incoming boat. 
At this time Kansas City had less than one thousand 
inhabitants. ' ' 

" While at the house of Mrs. Cronkhite, Rocky and 
I caught fish from the Osage, for which she gave us 
six cents a pound, by which we earned two dollars. ' ' 

' ' While we were living here a man by the name of 

E got possession of Father's house on his claim,

giving him a great deal of trouble ; but by aid of the 
settlers (who, en masse, gathered, and set the would-be 
' jumper ' off the premises, carrying his wife out in 
her chair, while persistently she held to it, she being 
the moving spirit of the act) the house was regained 
about midsummer, and, Mother coming, we all gath- 
ered together in our log-cabin home." 



23 



CHAPTER V 

THE YOUNG IMMIGRANT 

WHEN Spencer arrived in Osawatomie he was be- 
tween twelve and thirteen years of age. He was tall, 
for his years, and slender, but well-formed. His hair 
was then light brown, and curled gracefully at the 
ends. He had fair complexion that showed immedi- 
ately the flush of fatigue or emotion. His eyes were 
blue. In disposition he was affectionate. If " we re- 
fer to the heart the power of loving and the power of 
imagining, ' ' 1 then we may say that Spencer had a 
large heart. We shall often observe, as we read his 
journal, that the boy was perpetually craving com- 
panionship and affection. His imagination was afflu- 
ent. I have in my keeping hundreds of pages of fiction 
composed by him in Kansas. The form is fiction ; the 
spirit is of the essence of truth such truth as may be 
clearly discerned and luminously exhibited only by the 
light of a lively imagination. Adequate instruction 
and criticism would have qualified him to do brilliant 
work as an author for he possessed original endow- 
ments which if so schooled would have fitted him for 
i Rey. F. W. Robertson. 

24 



THE YOUNG IMMIGRANT 

literary pursuits. He delighted in all things beauti- 
ful. The glories of the heavens and the earth en- 
tranced him. Although he was very sensitive, I do not 
think he was unusually vain, or self-conscious. He 
was observant and reticent. His sister " Kitty " 
(whom he sometimes addresses, in his correspondence, 
as Cornelia, sometimes as Cora) was at that time his 
chief confidant. His thirst for knowledge was insatia- 
ble. He liked play as well as other boys like it, but 
his best-loved recreation was to read. While he was in 
Kansas he made a list of books he had studied, which 
justifies the conclusion that his mind was unusually 
active and his literary appetite omnivorous. 

He was not fit for life on a farm. More moral ear- 
nestness, clearer recognition of moral obligation than 
he then had, might have reconciled him to such a life ; 
but his bent was towards literature. His occupations in 
Kansas were irksome to him. He was irritated not by 
the hardships but by the privations of his lot espe- 
cially by the forfeiture of opportunity to obtain a 
liberal education. In reflecting upon the vicissitudes 
of Mr. O. C. Brown's family at Osawatomie, I have 
been reminded of William Penn 's Apostrophe to Penn- 
sylvania : 

" O Pennsylvania, what hast thou not cost me! 
About thirty thousand pounds more than I ever got 
for it, two hazardous and most fatiguing voyages, and 
my son's soul, almost! " 

25 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

But the soul of Spencer Brown was not sacrificed. 
The lad's history illustrates the truth that it is good 
to bear the yoke in one's youth but the wearer should 
not be allowed to feel that the yoke is galling him. 
Had Spencer been bound to a ranchman's life but a 
little longer, nothing but the loftiest Christian prin- 
ciple could have saved him from desperation. He was 
not tried above that which he was able to bear. He 
endured, perhaps not quite as submissively and gra- 
ciously as he ought, until a way of escape was open 
to him. 



26 



CHAPTER VI 

OLD JOHN BROWN 

ABOUT the time of the coming of the family of Mr. 
O. C. Brown to Osawatomie, went, also, to that part of 
Kansas, Owen, Frederick, and Salmon Brown, sons 
of that John Brown of whom the soldiers of the armies 
of the Union used to sing, in the war against the re- 
bellion, 

John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave ; 
His soul is marching on ! 

These immigrants had the best teams and equip- 
ments that had reached the new settlement. " They 
came to stay, ' ' wrote Spencer 's father, ' ' and without 
unnecessary delay established their families on lands 
claimed under the pre-emption laws enacted by Con- 
gress. Their houses were eight miles above Osawa- 
tomie, on the Osage River. The men were surveyors, 
and laid out roads and made improvements with a 
view to permanent occupation. They were tall, intelli- 
gent, fine-looking men, much superior to even the bet- 
ter class of emigrants from the East. ... As Osa- 

27 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

watomie was the nearest point where there was mail 
delivery, and where a store could be found at which 
to trade, the new settlers were occasionally in the vil- 
lage." In May they were joined by their brothers, 
John and Jason, who ' ' brought with them fruit-trees 
and blooded stock." In November of that year came 
' ' Old John Brown ' ' himself, with another son, Oliver, 
and a son-in-law, a Mr. Thompson, the husband of 
Ruth Brown, the eldest daughter. " The old man 
travelled, under the guise of a surveyor, by ox-team. 
He went through Missouri, having with him a tent 
and a supply of arms. When he was questioned by 
Missourians he told them he was going into Kansas 
to survey lands for them and the Abolitionists to quar- 
rel over." 

The life of the ' ' Hero of Harper 's Ferry, ' ' as por- 
trayed by Redpath, or by F. B. Sanborn, is familiar to 
many persons who will read these pages. 

Brown was a descendant of the Puritans. Philoso- 
phers whose subject of study is the material universe 
accept the doctrine of the " Conservation of Energy." 
The forms in which the energy resides may change, 
must change. The energy itself is constant. There is 
a moral energy, too, which is conserved from genera- 
tion to generation. John Brown and his ancestry 
illustrate the theory of the propagation of moral 
forces. 

The author of a history of The Harper 's Ferry In- 
28 



OLD JOHN BROWN 

surrection says of him: " He was a decided anti- 
slavery man, a religious enthusiast, a rigid Presby- 
terian, correct and conscientious in all his relations 
and conduct, and modest and unassuming in his man- 
ners. At the same time he was a man of iron will, of 
untiring energy, and of ... nerve. All who 
knew him are impressed with the belief that he never 
knew fear, and that no man ever lived who excelled 
him in cool and daring intrepidity. . . . He was 
made the object of the most active persecutions of the 
Missourians. . . . One of his sons (Frederick) 
was met alone on the road by a large party of invading 
Missourians and brutally murdered without a cause. 
Another son (John) was, for no cause but his political 
opinions, loaded with chains and driven on foot before 
the horses of his captors from Osawatomie to Tecum- 
seh. . . . The women of the family were grossly 
insulted. . . . His friends and neighbours were 
murdered around him. He w T as forced into a war of 
self-defence, and finally a price was publicly set on 
his head. The effect of these things, in connection 
with all the other outrage, oppression, and murder 
perpetrated around him, upon a man of Brown's tem- 
perament may be conceived. He became a fighting 
man and developed qualities that excited the admira- 
tion and surprise of his friends and made him the 
terror of his enemies. Though remorseless and relent- 
less as death itself, he did everythin&flpdfjr a sense of 

29 




Qtatasit, 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

duty and high religious excitement. The more fervent 
his prayers, the harder fell his blows. ' ' 

The above extract from the writings of one who 
knew John Brown personally, and who was familiar 
with the events which developed that side of his nature 
which is here described as remorseless, gives, I pre- 
sume, a fair idea of the man. 

Much has been said about his sanction of what has 
been called the " Pottawatomie Massacre." I shall 
not attempt to justify the killing of Wilkinson, Sher- 
man, and the Doyles. The case is one that we who sit 
in our peaceful homes, hundreds or thousands of miles 
from the strife, or who are separated more than forty 
years from the time of the conflict, are entirely unable 
to judge fairly. Nevertheless I must allude to this 
tragedy. Nobody who says anything about John 
Brown can lightly set it aside. 

Sometimes the character of an act is to be dis- 
cerned only when we approach it in chronological 
progress. Jason, a son of Old John Brown, reminds 
us that Dow, Barber, Johnston, Stuart, and R. P. 
Brown, Free- State men, were murdered by the Pro- 
Slavery party before the stroke fell upon the Doyles 
and others on the Pottawatomie. He also mentions 
a speech delivered in St. Joseph, Missouri, in 1854 
a year before any of John Brown's family had entered 
Kansas a speech of the notorious Pro-Slavery leader, 
B. F. Stringf ellow, who is reported to have said : " I 

30 



OLD JOHN BROWN 

tell you to mark every scoundrel among you who is in 
the least tainted with Abolitionism, or Free-Soilism, 
and exterminate him. Neither give nor take quar- 
ter from the rascals. ... I advise you, one 

and all, to enter every election district in Kansas, in 
defiance of Reeder and his myrmidons, and vote at 
the point of the bowie-knife and the revolver. . . . 
It is enough that the slave-holding interest wills it 
from which there is no appeal." Jason Brown then 
quotes from Phillip's Conquest of Kansas, to show 
the youth of our country that " there is more than 
one side to be heard from." I record, as he gives 
it, nearly the whole passage. 

" On the 15th of January, 1856, an election was 
held for State officers and legislators, under the To- 
peka Constitution, 1 throughout the Territory. The 
Pro-Slavery Mayor of Leavenworth forbade an elec- 
tion being held there. But there was one man, . . . 
R. P. Brown, who determined to resist this tyranny, 
and on an adjournment of the polls to a neighbouring 
town went out there with a few friends to defend the 
rights of the freemen. The Kickapoo Rangers, a 
gang of Pro-Slavery men, marched out there also. A 
skirmish ensued, they were successfully resisted and 
driven back ; but Captain R. P. Brown, on the follow- 
ing day, on returning home, was surrounded by an 

1 Drawn and adopted by Representatives of the Free-State vo- 
ters, who really were a majority of the citizens of Kansas. 

31 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

overwhelming force, and, at the earnest entreaty of 
his companions, although against his own judgment, 
surrendered, under a promise that their persons should 
be safe. The terms were violated. One young man 
was knocked down and a ruffian was going to strike him 
with his hatchet (the Kickapoo Rangers carried 
hatchets), but was prevented by the captain of the 
company. The prisoners were taken back to Eaton, 
but Brown was separated from them and put in an 
adjoining building. ' ' 

"A rope was purchased at the store and was shown 
to the prisoners, with the intimation that they should 
be hanged with it. It was fiercely discussed for hours 
what should be done with them. Meanwhile, liquor 
was drunk freely, and they who were brutal without 
anything to make them more so became ungovernably 
fierce. Unwilling that all these men should be mur- 
dered, the captain allowed the other prisoners to es- 
cape. One of them hastened to Fort Leavenworth, in 
hopes of getting troops to go and rescue Brown ; but 
it was a vain attempt. Protection was refused. Then 
followed a scene of atrocity and horror. Captain 
Brown had surrendered his arms and was helpless. 
His enemies, who dared not to face him the night be- 
fore though they had a superior force, now crowded 
around him. When they began to strike him he arose 
to his feet and asked to be permitted to fight any one 
of them. He challenged them to pit him against 

32 



OLD JOHN BROWN 

their best man; he would fight for his life. But 
not one of the cowards dared to give the prisoner a 
chance. ' ' 

' ' Then he volunteered to fight two, and then three ; 
but it was in vain. These men, or, rather, demons, 
rushed around Brown and literally hacked him to 
death with their hatchets. One of the Rangers . . . 
inflicted the fatal blow. A large hatchet-gash in the 
side of the head penetrated the skull. . . . The 
gallant Brown fell, and his remorseless enemies 
jumped on him, while he was thus prostrated, and 
kicked him. . . . As they kicked him he said, 
' Don't abuse me; it is useless; I am dying.' . . . 
A few of their number, whom a little spark of con- 
science, or fear of punishment, had animated, raised 
the dying man, still groaning, and placing him on a 
wagon, his gaping wounds but poorly sheltered from 
the bitter cold of that winter day, drove him to the 
grocery, where they went through the farce of dressing 
his wounds; but, seeing the hopelessness of his case, 
took him home to his wife. The pulse of life was 
ebbing. She asked him what was the matter. . . . 
' I have been murdered by a gang of cowards, in cold 
blood, without any cause,' he said; and as the poor 
wife stooped over the body of her gallant husband 
he expired." 

After making this quotation, Jason Brown adds: 
' ' No notice was ever taken of these atrocious murders, 

33 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

by the powers that were never once did they interfere 
to preserve the purity of the ballot-box or the right 
of free speech. No attempt was ever made to bring 
these murderers to justice. . . . We were all 
marked (as well as many others) for the bullet and the 
dagger, and there was no alternative but to fight for 
our homes and lives, and for others." 

It must be remembered that the disgraceful "Ad- 
ministration " of President Pierce was to such a de- 
gree controlled by the South that when Governor 
Reeder, himself an appointee of the President, ve- 
toed acts of the Legislature elected in Kansas by 
fraud and violence, he was summarily removed from 
office. 

" The one purpose of subjugating Kansas," said 
Mr. O. C. Brown, " was never lost sight of by the 
dominant party in the nation, the United States Gov- 
ernment, with its military force, being the handy sup- 
port of the leaders ' ' in Kansas. 

Mr. O. C. Brown, the founder of Osawatomie, was 
acquainted with all the men concerned in these feuds. 
His testimony is thoroughly credible and trustworthy. 
A part of it, which relates to the tragedy on the Pot- 
tawatomie, I give. 

" Later came from St. Louis a German by the 
name of Wiener, who made a claim and opened a store 
between the Browns' and ' Dutch Henry's Crossing,' 
where lived Allen Wilkinson, the Doyles, and ' Dutch 

34 



OLD JOHN BROWN 

Bill,' the drunken bully of the region. 1 . . . . 
' Dutch Bill ' visited Mr. Wiener (who had peaceably 
pursued his own business) and sought a quarrel, which 
resulted in his being severely flogged. From this time 
' Dutch Bill ' swore vengeance against the St. Louis 
German. This feud was talked of and well under- 
stood by the settlers for miles around, but no one could 
have believed it would result in such a tragic ending. ' ' 

' ' In May the Missouri border was crossed by Sher- 
iff Jones, of Westport, for another general raid upon 
Lawrence. Being in Kansas City, Missouri, I was 
urged to return to Osawatomie to send a protecting 
force to Lawrence. The city was full of men who were 
outfitting for the coming contest." 

"A small company, including the Browns, hastened 
to the beleaguered city. . . . During the absence 
of the Osawatomie company a meeting of Pro-Slavery 
men was held at the ' Dutch Henry Crossing, ' when a 
vote of expulsion was taken against Mr. Wiener, and 
the Brown families, and Mr. Thompson, son-in-law of 
Old John Brown. Allen Wilkinson, the three Doyles, 
and ' Dutch Bill ' were appointed to carry out the 
threat. The message was delivered to Mr. Wiener, 
who, with the utmost despatch, bore it to the Free- 
State camp. It warned Wiener and all the Brown 

1 This " Dutch Bill " was the man commonly called " Sherman " 
in reports of the " Pottawatomie Massacre " why, I cannot im- 
agine. 

35 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

families ' to leave the Territory by Sunday night, or 
die.' " 

" The five men who had outlawed themselves by 
serving such a notice had no opportunity to carry out 
their threat. The Rev. Mr. Utter calls the men ' inno- 
cent citizens.' Of that let the reader judge." 

' ' Now, as to the question who did the killing, it is 
generally asserted and believed that John Brown 
did not do it, but knew of it, approved it. 
In view of the facts, who had the greatest provo- 
cation to do such a deed? All of the parties sus- 
pected remained in the Territory except Mr. Wiener. 
The following spring I saw Mr. Wiener in St. Louis. 
He talked freely, but guardedly, of that event, assert- 
ing his participation in the killing, and said he was 
going into the Territory on business, but should not 
remain. He kept himself aloof from the crowd which 
his personal safety required him to do." 

Having given what I believe to be a true outline 
of events which shed some light upon the mystery of 
the " Pottawatomie Massacre," I leave the reader to 
form his own conclusions. 



36 



CHAPTER VII 

THE LATER CAREER OF JOHN BROWN 

OF John Brown's courage and soldierly efficiency 
no doubt has been expressed by friend or foe. In 1856 
a force from Missouri invaded Kansas, determined to 
destroy several towns inhabited chiefly by Northern 
families, and to exterminate Free-Soil voters and war- 
riors. This force was variously estimated at from two 
thousand to twenty-seven hundred men. In the Free- 
State force assembled to meet the enemy there were 
only about five hundred men. Governor Geary, with 
great difficulty, persuaded the Missourians to return 
to their homes. Because of the disparity of the two 
forces there was much rejoicing in the Northern States 
over Mr. Geary's success. 

John Brown, on the other hand, was greatly vexed. 
The odds of five to one he counted as nothing. ' ' What 
are five to one," said he, " when our men would be 
fighting for their wives, their children, their homes, 
and their liberties, against a party one-half of whom 
were mercenary vagabonds, and enlisted for a mere 
frolic, lured on by the whisky and the bacon, and a 
large portion of the others had gone under compulsion 
4 37 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

of public opinion and proscription, and because they 
feared being denounced as Abolitionists if they re- 
fused. ' ' 1 He believed that the Free-State men had 
lost the opportunity to put an end to the struggle by 
one decisive stroke. On one occasion, when three hun- 
dred of the enemy rode from Franklin and made a 
demonstration against Lawrence, " Brown eagerly 
hurried out, with one hundred men, to give them fight 
on the open prairie; but the enemy retired, and de- 
clined the contest "to the old man's disappointment 
and disgust. 

The later history of John Brown is known to nearly 
all intelligent Americans. The family of a poor negro 
was about to be separated, part of it to be sold to 
planters in the distant South. The man fled from 
Missouri to Brown, by night, imploring assistance. 
John Brown determined to make a bold stroke that 
should at the same time rescue these slaves from their 
dreaded fate, free others, and teach Missourians that 
their continuance of war upon Kansas would imperil 
their ownership of slaves in all western Missouri. Di- 
viding his followers into two parties, he crossed 
the border, and by that night's work liberated thir- 
teen slaves and captured several white men. Re- 
turning then to Kansas, he released the captured 
Missourians. 

Three weeks later he set out, with a detachment of 
1 From The Harper's Ferry Insurrection. 

38 



CAREER OF JOHN BROWN 

his company, to escort the f reedmen and their families 
to Canada. ' ' The retreat from southern Kansas, and 
particularly the first stage of his journey from Osawa- 
tomie to Lawrence, was one of the boldest adventures 
of Brown. 1 With a price on his head; with but one 
white companion, himself an outcast ; with twelve fugi- 
tives who had been advertised the world over; and 
with their property loaded into an odd-looking wagon 
drawn by the cattle taken from the slave-owner in Mis- 
souri, Brown pushed forward, in the dead of winter, 
regardless of warnings and threats, but relying on the 
mercy of God and on his own stout heart. His next and 
most dangerous stage was from Holton, in Jackson 
County, thirty miles north of Topeka, to the Nebraska 
border. At Holton he occupied the cabin of Albert 
Fuller, and went forth from there, with his Topeka re- 
enforcements, to win the ' Battle of the Spurs. ' ' In 
this encounter he made that capture of his pursuers 
concerning which Brown's biographers have romanced 
a little ; saying, among other things, that he forced his 
prisoners to pray or be shot. As to this the truth, I 
presume, is given by Mr. Sanborn in this interesting 
and amusing story : 

" One of the party captured was Dr. Hereford, a 

< young physician from Atchison a wild, rattling, 

devil-may-care kind of fellow, always ready for an 

adventure, but who really had nothing very bad in his

composition. Brown took him under his special care. 
One evening he called upon the Doctor to offer prayer. 

" ' By ! ' said the Doctor, ' I can't pray.' 

' ' ' Did your mother ever teach you to pray ? ' 
' ' ' Oh, yes ; but that was a long time ago. ' 
" ' But you still remember the prayer she taught 
you/ said Brown. 
" ' Yes.' 

' ' ' Well, for lack of a better one say that ; ' and the 
Doctor repeated, before black and white comrades of 
the camp, that night, the rhyme 

' ' ' Now I lay me down to sleep, ' etc., to the amuse- 
ment of his fellow-prisoners and others. ' ' 

" On his return home he related this, and said, with 
an oath, that John Brown was the best man he had ever 
met, and knew more about religion than any man. 
When asked whether Brown had ever treated them 
badly, or used harsh language while they were with 
him, he said ' No ' that they were all treated like 
gentlemen, had the same fare as the others ; but it did 
go a little against the grain to eat with and be guarded 

by ' niggers. ' ' 

John Brown continued this work of emancipating 
slaves in Missouri until he engaged in a greater enter- 
prise with similar purpose. To execute this he made 
the attack on Harper's Ferry, in Virginia. He was 
captured, tried for " Insurrection, Treason, and Mur- 
der," and was convicted and executed. He and his 

40 



CAREER OF JOHN BROWN 

few followers, bent on what seems to have been an in- 
sanely reckless invasion of Virginia, to free the slaves, 
were driven into the engine-house of the United States 
Armory, which, the next day, was stormed by United 
States marines. Of the seventeen white men engaged 
in this foray, ten were killed at Harper's Ferry, John 
Brown and one other were severely wounded and cap- 
tured, four escaped (of whom three were sent away 
before the fight), and one was captured unhurt. Two 
of the killed were sons of John Brown. 

Concerning his motives in the course he pursued 
in Kansas, Missouri, and Virginia, we have his own 
declaration, made while he was a wounded captive. 

" How long have you been engaged in this busi- 
ness? " asked Mr. Vallandigham, a member of Con- 
gress. 

" From the breaking out of the difficulties in 
Kansas," answered he. 

" What was your object in coming? " inquired Mr. 
Mason. 

' ' We came to free the slaves, and only that. ' ' 

To the question, ' ' How do you justify your acts ? ' ' 
Mr. Brown replied, " I think, my friend, you are 
guilty of a great wrong against God and humanity I 
say it without wishing to be offensive and it would 
be perfectly right in any one to interfere with you so 
far as to free those you wilfully and wickedly hold in 
bondage. I do not say this insultingly." 

41 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

' ' I understand that, ' ' said Mr. Mason. 

" I think I did right," continued John Brown, 
" and that others will do right who interfere with 
you, at any time, and at all times. I hold that the 
Golden Rule, ' Do unto others as you would that others 
should do unto you,' applies to all who would help 
others to gain their liberty. ' ' 

" But you don't believe in the Bible! " broke in 
Lieutenant Stuart. 

" Certainly I do," answered John Brown. 

Later in this interview he said to the men of Vir- 
ginia, " You had better all you people at the South- 
prepare yourselves for a settlement of that question 
that must come up for settlement sooner than you are 
prepared for. The sooner you are prepared the better. 
You may dispose of me very easily ; I am nearly dis- 
posed of now ; but this question is still to be settled 
this negro question, I mean the end of that is not 
yet." 

To a kinsman who was a minister of the gospel he 
wrote, from the jail in which he lay awaiting execu- 
tion, a very remarkable letter, in which he expressed 
his firm conviction that God would make his defeat 
and death the means of forwarding the work he had so 
much at heart. After declaring his belief that his dis- 
aster at Harper's Ferry resulted from his own mistake 
in yielding to his feelings of humanity, and leaving his 
proper place to mingle with his prisoners and quiet 

42 



CAREER OF JOHN BROWN 

their fears, he asserts, " I firmly believe that God 
reigns and that he overrules all things in the best possi- 
ble manner ; and in that view of the subject I try to be 
in some degree reconciled to my own weaknesses and 
follies even. If you were here on the spot and could 
be with me by day and by night, and know the facts and 
how my time is spent here, I think you would find much 
to reconcile your own mind to the ignominious death 
I am about to suffer, and to mitigate your sorrow. ' ' 

' ' I am, to say the least, quite cheeerf ul. ' He shall 
begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philis- 
tines. ' This was said of a poor erring servant, many 
years ago; and for many years I have felt that God 
had given me powers and faculties, unworthy as I was, 
that he intended to use for a similar purpose. This 
most unmerited honour he has seen fit to bestow, and 
whether, like the same poor frail man to whom I al- 
lude, my death may not be of vastly more value than my 
life, is, I think, quite beyond all human foresight. I 
really have strong hopes that, notwithstanding all my 
many sins, I, too, may yet die in faith. If you do not 
believe I had a murderous intention (while I know I 
had not) why grieve so terribly on my account? The 
scaffold has but few terrors for me. God has often 
covered my head in the day of battle, and granted me, 
many times, deliverances that were almost so miracu- 
lous that I can scarce realize their truth, and now, when 
it seems quite certain that he intends to use me in a 

43 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

different way, shall I not most cheerfully go ? I may 
be deceived, but I humbly trust that he will not for- 
sake me till ' I have showed his favour to this genera- 
tion and his strength to every one that is to come. ' ' 

His execution took place at Charlestown, Jefferson 
County, Virginia, December 2, 1859. 

A man who was acquainted with John Brown gives 
this estimate of his character : ' ' Wherever he lived 
he soon acquired the reputation of a man of the stern- 
est integrity of character. In Kansas he was the great, 
living test of principle in our politicians. The more 
corrupt the man, the more he denounced ' Old Brown. ' 
It was a true compliment to be praised or to be recog- 
nised by him as a friend ; for even in his social dealings 
he would have no connection with any man of unprin- 
cipled or unworthy character." 

' ' In his camp he permitted no profanity. No man 
of loose morals was suffered to stay there unless, in- 
deed, as prisoner of war. ' I would rather have the 
small-pox, yellow-fever, and cholera, all together, in my 
camp, than a man without principle. ' This he said to 
the present writer when speaking of some ruffianly 
recruits whom a well-known leader had recently intro- 
duced. ' It's a mistake, sir, . . . that our people 
make when they think that bullies are the best fighters, 
or that they are the fit men to oppose these demagogues. 
Give me men of good principles, God-fearing men, men 
who respect themselves, and with a dozen of them I will 

44 



CAREER OF JOHN BROWN 

oppose any hundred such men as these Buford ruf- 
fians.' " 

' ' His whole character is portrayed in these words. 
He was a Puritan in the Cromwellian sense of the word. 
He trusted in God and kept his powder dry. ' ' 

' ' Prayers were offered up in his camp every morn- 
ing and evening. His manner, though conveying the 
idea of a stern and self-sustaining man, was yet gentle 
and courteous, and marked by frequent and decided 
manifestations of kindness; and by his friends it is 
said of him that, amid all his provocations, he never 
perpetrated an act of wanton or unnecessary cruelty. 
He was scrupulously honest, moral, and temperate, 
and never gave utterance to a boast. ' ' 

Mr. 0. C. Brown, who knew him well, adds his 
testimony, first describing John Brown's personal ap- 
pearance. It " was that of a gentleman of the old 
school. He was tall, erect, not portly, not slim; had 
broad shoulders, a well-proportioned, good-sized head ; 
heavy hair, iron-gray silvering to white, stiff, and brist- 
ling back from the forehead, and of good length be- 
hind ; long, graceful, well-formed ears, which were set 
close to the head ; a model face, adorned with Roman 
nose; gray eyes, with piercing vision, but very mild 
and gentle in expression, and canopied by heavy, dark 
brows ; a long, clean, white beard which embellished 
as fine a head, I think, as ever crowned the shoulders 
of a man. As to dress, it is enough to say I cannot re- 

45 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

member anything about it. In address and manners 
he was courteous, listening to you patiently and reply- 
ing in a pleasant but brief and decided manner. He 
never minced matters in giving expression to unpopu- 
lar truth, God's word and the Declaration of Inde- 
pendence being sufficient authority with him. He let 
the results take care of themselves. He believed it al- 
ways safe to do right. All wrongful legislation, all 
oppressive laws, must be resisted. Under the ' Bogus 
Laws ' the tax-collector came. A public meeting was 
called in Osawatomie, and the stern old man showed 
his mettle, proposing resolutions similar to those of the 
fathers of the Revolution against the tea-tax." 

"After a full advocacy (Brown leading a very 
earnest discussion) the resolutions were passed. For 
this, he, the writer, and several others were indicted, 
arrested and imprisoned. By those who acted with 
him he was held in reverence for his strict religious 
life, good common sense, general kindliness, and hu- 
manity to his enemies. He would allow no needless 
destruction of property of even his worst foes. In 
doing what he regarded as his duty he knew no fear. 
I saw him frequently, at my own house, in the public 
meeting, recruiting and leading men for the defence 
of Lawrence, and in battle at Lawrence, and was much 
impressed by his courage and his trust in men and in 
God." 

This man was Spencer's most distinguished Kansas 
46 



neighbour and acquaintance. No doubt his character 
and history helped to mould the principles of the boy, 
who, in his turn, died for that great nation the very ex- 
istence of which God made to depend upon its procla- 
mation of liberty throughout all the land. The citi- 
zens of the United States of this generation need to 
give heed to the lessons taught by convulsions and war- 
fare that only the old men of the country can remem- 
ber. As God is God and truth is truth, there will be 
another reckoning-day for the land if, in theory and 
practice, it aims at becoming only " a white man's 
country." 

Aready, while he was in Kansas, John Brown 
seemed to hear the trumpet of destiny calling him to 
his death for the cause of the bondmen, and to believe 
that his surrender of his own life would bear some pe- 
culiar relation to the disenthralment of millions. 

Could he have heard, prophetically, the great and 
conquering armies of the Republic in the very heart 
of the Southern Confederacy singing in mighty chorus 
that stirring battle-song which seemed to bring down 
every citadel of slavery, the old hero would have re- 
joiced with unspeakable joy, and would have gone to 
his death just as he did go believing that the Lord 
God omnipotent reigneth, and doeth all things well. 

On Sunday, April 2, 1865, the capital of the re- 
bellious Confederacy was wrapped in flames that made 
the heavens, as I looked upon them at midnight, red as 

47 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

the blood drawn by the slave-holders' lash. The 
next morning as the hosts of the Federal Union poured 
through the streets of Petersburg and Richmond they 
sang with resounding emphasis 

John Brown's body lies mouldering in the grave, 
But his soul is marching on. 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! 
His soul is marching on ! 

At Osawatomie the reader may see a costly monu- 
ment which was erected in 1877 to the memory of Old 
John Brown.

CHAPTER VIII 

TOIL AND TURMOIL 

THERE was no school in Osawatomie when Spencer 
arrived there. Boys would be occupied, part of the 
time, breaking the soil and putting in the seed. Days 
would be given to splitting rails and hewing logs for, 
cabins. This employment would take the workers into 
the timber that fringed the meadow-lands along the 
rivers. There Spencer's ear would be thrilled, occa- 
sionally, by the versatile powers of the mocking-bird. 
In the hot days of August the Texas cardinal, or his 
kinsman, the red-bird of Virginia, the Louisiana tan- 
ager, and the indigo-bird would flash like brilliants 
from thicket to thicket. The humming-bird, minute 
and rainbow tinted, would dart from flower to flower. 
In May the wild grape would perfume the air, and the 
voice of the turtle-dove was heard in the land. East- 
ern Kansas is so related both to the cooler North and 
to the great forests of Missouri and Arkansas as to 
encourage the birds in a migration as heterogeneous 
as that of the human beings who seek homes within 
her borders. 

In autumn the boys would find recreation shooting 
49 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

prairie-chickens or wild turkeys, or would be seen an- 
gling for jack-salmon, perch, and catfish of different 
species. Tradition is positive that a blue catfish 
(Ictalurus furcatus), caught in Kansas in 1856, 
weighed two hundred and fifty pounds, and that the 
aid of a steamboat tow-line and a yoke of oxen was 
required to land it. But that catch was not made in 
the Osage River. However, there were plenty of black 
bass in that stream, and Spencer and his brother had 
rare sport capturing this king of the finny tribes of 
fresh water. 

At home the children did not forget the simple and 
refining recreations of their earlier years. In 1856 a 
piano lent accompaniment to the music of sweet voices. 
The perils through which it passed on its journey, 
the scrutiny it underwent, its safe arrival in Osawat- 
omie, and, finally, its destruction, will be mentioned 
in due order. For a time it added its charm to the love- 
song, and led the hymns of the morning and evening 
family worship and of the ' ' cottage prayer-meeting. ' ' 
Books were imported from the East to this dwelling 
on the prairie, and time was found to read and study 
them. 

Young people would get together and enjoy the 
various parlour games and amusements known in the 
distant and diverse parts of the United States and of 
Europe from which they had emigrated. It is even 
rumoured that, as a lady of Lancaster could become 

50 



TOIL AND TURMOIL 

enamoured of a gallant of the house of York, so Mis- 
sourians and New Englanders could together measure 
love-tape, play Copenhagen, or prove the fascination 
of the cushion dance. 

However, life in Osawatomie was not a holiday. 
The men and women of that day had more than enough 
both of work and of anxiety. Adversity soon cast its 
shadow over the whole Territory. Violence and war 
soon dispersed families and disappointed the hopes 
that had lured so many thousands to the fertile West. 
The children had to share the sorrows and privations of 
their parents. Very early they had bitter experience 
of misfortune. I will try to let those who were actors 
in the history of the epoch tell their own tale. 

Osawatomie was growing rapidly. General S. C. 
Pomeroy was agent of the New England Emigrant 
Aid Society, under the auspices of which the village 
was founded. To him and to Mr. 0. C. Brown it ap- 
peared desirable to have a steam saw-mill there, to 
provide lumber for the houses of settlers. In Novem- 
ber, 1855, Mr. Brown went to St. Louis to procure a 
boiler for this mill. He prolonged his eastward jour- 
ney to Boston. 

" My . . . trip," he writes, " was down the 
Missouri River. . . . The water was low. . . . 
Being sick I was put ashore at Hill's Landing. Here 
I saw, as at other places also, mounted men, armed, 
and organizing for the invasion of Kansas and the at- 

51 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

tack upon Lawrence which followed. In the hotels and 
stores the excitement ran high, Kansas being the com- 
mon theme ; and Abolitionists were declared the fit ob- 
jects of Southerners' shot-guns. The prisons were 
drawn upon for recruits." 

" ... Having spent the winter in Boston, 
New York city, and towns in New York State, 1 I re- 
turned by the first boat, March 4, 1856. In the East 
the country had been thoroughly aroused by the 
Southern methods of carrying out Douglas's Bill for 
the settlement of the question of Freedom or Slavery. 
Plainly the intent of the South was to carry slavery 
into the Territory at all hazards. Large numbers from 
North and South rushed to the theatre of action from 
the North, mainly good and true men, singly and with 
families, to make permanent homes; from the South, 
chiefly desperadoes, armed and under orders, the first 
companies of which, under Buford, landing in Kansas 
City in large numbers (a desperate-looking set of men) 
were so poor as to require help for subsistence. A 
large number of these afterward camped on the other 
side of the Pottawatomie, near Osawatomie. Other 
companies from the South followed. A steady stream 
of emigration flowed to Kansas this spring and sum- 
mer from the Eastern and Middle States, intent on 
making Kansas the ' Home of the Free. ' ' 

While Mr. Brown was making New York city his 
1 Endeavouring to recruit the ranks of Free-State men in Kansas. 

52 



TOIL AND TURMOIL 

headquarters he went with Mr. Eli Thayer, of the Emi- 
grant Aid Society, to attend a meeting held in the lec- 
ture-room of Mr. Beecher 's church in behalf of Kansas. 
Of this he says : 

"A good audience of substantial citizens was ad- 
dressed by Mr. Beecher, who, in the boldest manner, 
advised the use of Sharpe 's rifles. The South had be- 
come very pious, counselling the Free-State people to 
use only their Bibles. This was hardly in keeping 
with the open murders committed in Kansas under the 
hypocritical rallying cry of ' Law and Order ' which 
was in every rascal's mouth. We had come to know 
the true value of Southern ideas of right and wrong. 
Beecher was considered sound on the subject of per- 
sonal rights. How to put the guns into Kansas that 
was the question." 

' ' It seems that a Mr. Hoyt, with more courage than 
wisdom, undertook personal attendance upon two 
boxes of Sharpe 's rifles. He told me, in St. Louis, that 
he had this mission. Dressed in a way to simulate a 
United States soldier, he shipped the guns to Kansas 
City, Missouri the natural landing-place of freight 
destined for the Territory; but Fort Leavenworth, 
thirty miles farther up the river, was the military sta- 
tion of the Government. He left a letter on his table, 
in his state-room, written to Eastern friends, in which 
he more than hinted at the object of his trip to Kansas. 
The ' fire-eaters,' in his absence, stole the letter, and 
5 53 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

a fearful scene followed. To the whole crowd of pas- 
sengers in the saloon of the steamboat the letter was 
read. Hoyt was confronted, denounced, condemned, 
outlawed, and but for his bold front he would, doubt- 
less, have been despatched on the spot. Silent, not a 
muscle or nerve quivering, with heavy revolvers in his 
belt and a huge knife pending, resolved to die game 
(as the leaders on the other side well understood), he 
looked his foes squarely in the eye. No one dared draw 
an iron. His courage stood him well. He was equal to 
the occasion. His back to the casements, he was enough 
for the crowd. The guns were confiscated. The 
roughs at the next landing-place would be enough for 
Hoyt. The telegraph had notified Lexington of the 
affair. In the meantime the captain referred the ques- 
tion of the steamboat's liability for the guns to a 
Kansas Pro-Slavery lawyer, who gave it as his opinion 
that the boat could be held for the value of the guns 
the law of Missouri being that any boat could be tied 
up at any landing for indebtedness. ' ' 

" This legal opinion raised the wrath of the ' fire- 
eaters. ' Hoyt had raised a one-sided storm, the lawyer 
a two-sided tornado. He was arraigned, condemned, 
read out of the party, and his name was to be published 
in all the leading newspapers of Kansas and Missouri 
as unworthy of the confidence of Southern people. The 
short calm that followed the reading of these resolu- 
tions gave the lawyer an opportunity to speak in self- 

54 



TOIL AND TURMOIL 

defence. Protesting that he had been unjustly assailed 
for giving a legal opinion, as an attorney, to a man 
who was entitled to a true and candid answer, he went 
on in a masterly manner to let them know who he was 
and what he had done ; said he was the son of a slave- 
holder in Baltimore; came to Kansas, as a Demo- 
crat true to the interests of the South (in proof of 
which he mentioned that, as a member of the Legisla- 
ture, he had helped enact the Kansas Code, and was 
now returning from Baltimore, where he had spent 
the winter getting the code printed). ' And now,' he 
asked, rising to a pitch of intense scorn and indigna- 
tion, pointing his finger contemptuously at a Doctor 
Porter, of Independence, Missouri (who had been the 
most boisterous and furious in the attack) , and speak- 
ing with the bitterest sarcasm, ' on what meat hath 
this, our Caesar, fed, that he hath grown so great ? ' 

" ' Do you mean me, sir? ' 

" ' If the coat fits you, put it on.' ' 

' ' Like two furies they fought ; Porter, tall and 
agile; the lawyer, rather short, and weighted by his 
overcoat. He was too much for the doctor, but the by- 
standers would trip him up as fast as he worsted Por- 
ter, who, getting desperate, called for his weapons, 
which had dropped from his belt. Then the captain 
came and pulled the lawyer off from the ' Great 
Caesar.' Him others seized, and soon all was still. 
The lookers-on, excepting one, were silent. A touch 

55 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

of humour caused him to whisper to a Chicago man 
' Kilkenny cats ! ' The Chicago man (whom I met 
in Washington afterward, and who told me he was 
a detective) withdrew to the other side of the saloon, 
and I went into my state-room and read Fox's Book 
of Martyrs, which I chanced to have along." 

' ' Now, there were two great offenders of the slave- 
demon on the boat, and Lexington was near at hand. 
The son of General Kearney, a prominent Westport 
merchant, was on board. He was a Southerner in prin- 
ciples, but manly and respectable. Having opportunity 
to speak a few words to him, outside, when he was 
alone, I set forth the peril of the situation ; the excite- 
ment that would follow Hoyt's death, should he be 
killed on this the first boat; the damage to business, 
etc., etc. Promptly he said, ' I '11 stop it ! ' Soon he 
mounted upon a chair in the saloon and made a speech, 
giving several strong reasons why they, as ' Law and 
Order men, ' should see to it that nothing violent should 
be done on the first boat. ' Now, I move you that we 
rescind all those resolutions, pledge our word and 
honour that every passenger be protected and safely 
landed at his place of destination, and that we give 
bonds for the guns, to indemnify the boat. ' This was 
carried unanimously. A general hand-shaking love- 
feast and free treats followed. Suffice it to say, the 
breech-slides of the guns had been sent overland. The 
guns were paid for. ' ' 

56 



TOIL AND TURMOIL 

" As we approached Lexington, I stole an oppor- 
tunity to speak a word to Kearney. 

' ' ' How are you to get past that landing ? ' 

" ' When the boat is nearing the dock, and the 
passengers rush to that side, the captain will slip Hoyt 
out of the back-door of his state-room and run him up 
into the texas ' the extreme upper part of the pilot- 
house, the captain's quarters, where no one dared in- 
trude without orders. ' ' 

' ' The crowd of roughs came on board, pouring into 
every nook and corner of the boat ; but with all possible 
despatch the boat swung off, and proceeded up the 
river. Hoyt and the other Kansas men were landed 
at Kansas City, without further trouble then; but 
Hoyt was murdered by Georgians, who encamped 
on the Wakarusa River, about four miles from Law- 
rence, in the latter part of August. 

' ' Few men escaped who were doomed by the ' De- 
mon of Slavery. ' ' ' 



57 



CHAPTER IX 

AN EVENTFUL YEAK 

EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY-SIX was a year of 
great excitement in Kansas. The destruction of Law- 
rence; the burning of Osawatomie; the putting into 
the field of the Free-State force of one thousand men 
(headquarters of Lawrence) ; the plundering and mur- 
dering of defenceless settlers by roving bands of free- 
booters; the closing of the rivers against Free-State 
men; the cutting off of supplies of food and aid of 
friends; the robbing of the United States mails (one 
with more than three hundred letters for Osawatomie 
being captured) ; the disarming of part of the people; 
the flight of families from their insecure or desolate 
homes ; the aggravation of all these distresses by fever 
and ague, which laid in their beds at least some mem- 
bers of nearly every family; the poverty of the peo- 
pleall these events and circumstances spread misery 
and desolation on every hand. 

While Mr. 0. C. Brown was spending the winter 
in the East, doing what he could to arouse the people 
to more earnest and adequate exertions to secure the 

58 



AN EVENTFUL YEAR 

triumph of freedom in Kansas, Mrs. Brown and their 
children in the new home in that Territory were often 
disturbed by alarming rumours and happenings. On 
December 16, 1855, she wrote to her husband a letter 
which will give some idea of the condition of things 
in her own household at Osawatomie and in the neigh- 
bourhood of Lawrence. 

' ' I had nearly come to the conclusion that we were 
to have no further communication during your long 
absence, as it seemed to be prophesied here that any 
letter directed to you would be prevented. Mr. Oliver 
goes to New York to-morrow, and that gives me an op- 
portunity to send directly and safely to you. I suppose 
you have received a letter I wrote you, directed to 
Utica. I sent it by Mr. S , who said he would en- 
deavour to see you. 

" He came here a week ago last Friday. That day 
and Saturday were two of the most trying I ever 
passed. About nine o 'clock little Holbrook called and 
said he was going, with some others, to Lawrence. In 
a short time a gentleman knocked at the door. He was 
admitted, and complained of being sick, 1 and took some 
peppermint; said he was from Leavenworth, had rid- 
den all night, was very cold and much afraid. He said 
he met the young men and they told him we were from 

1 In America the word sick retains the meaning it had when the 
King James translation of the Bible was made. In England the 
significance has been changed and limited.

New York. Consequently he called here to rest him- 
self. After satisfying himself that we were all right 
he said he had deceived us ; that he had just come from 
Lawrence, and had escaped through the guards sur- 
rounding that town, riding all night in fear of pursuit, 
with two men as guides, who were to take back his 
horse. He said his coat was loaded with important 
papers. (We have since learned that he was one of 
the fifteen proscribed men sent out of Lawrence for 
safety.) He said he was brother to Mrs. P. K., and 
wished, if he should be taken, that I would inform her 
of his being here. He was very much alarmed and 
excited. 

' ' The children spoke, and said some armed Indians 

were coming up on horseback. Mr. S flew into our 

room, telling us to hide his overcoat, which he threw 
off, and, pulling out his revolver, said he was sick, and 
asked to get into the empty bed in our room. So, while 

Mr. S and his revolver were going to bed, I went 

to the door, all trembling, to attend the newcomers. 
They looked very hard, and seemed half Indian and 
but half human. They asked me, ' Is the man here 
that came on that horse ? ' pointing to a horse tied at 
the corner of the house. As I had not seen the horse 
before, I hesitated a little, but looked earnestly, then 
replied, ' Oh ! I have not seen that horse before. He 
must be somewhere about. Have you looked round, 
back of the house, or towards the woods ? '

' ' They were going to see, when Mr. S , looking 

from the window, hailed them as his guides and 
friends. They all went down to Mr. Geer's to dinner, 

and (I suppose seeing black Henry) Mr. S began 

to fear, and so carried the idea to the people there that 
he was Pro-Slavery (not much to his credit). So, 
more frightened than ever, he came back here and 
wanted us to get him to Colonel Moore 's, 1 about eight 
miles, saying we should be handsomely recompensed. 
Brennan 2 came home about this time and I asked him 

to drive Mr. S to Colonel Moore 's, and return that 

evening or in the morning. He said he had just con- 
cluded to go to Lawrence with some other volunteers. 

Mr. S said, ' Then he must go to Lawrence, ' and 

asked, ' Why cannot Spencer go? ' I said he was 

sick. K was up and dressed, and he invited her to 

go along. It was a pleasant afternoon, and, after some 
hesitation, thinking it a favorable opportunity for the 
children to make a valuable acquaintance, and that 
perhaps the ride would be beneficial to K , I con- 
sented to their going, to return next morning. 

" The next day was a terrible, windy day, and it 
was tea-time before they returned. Judge how I felt ! 
And judge of the rejoicing in this house on their safe 
return !

Administration, at Miami.

" Not knowing the short route, they travelled 
twenty miles to get there and twenty back again. 

" They had a very pleasant time at Colonel Moore's 
(his son and daughter being now at home) , but a hard 
ride. It did them much good, upon the whole, divert- 
ing their minds. Mr. S procured a guide to take 

him to some starting point, and was bound to "Wash- 
ington with his papers. For two or three days the 
children seemed to have recovered from their chills 
but that was all. They now continue to have them, 

three or four chills a day. C , Spencer, Fanny, 

and Freddy have them. I have had a very hard cold, 
with chills, hoarseness, and so forth. Between sickness 
and apprehension, I am not much to be envied. Yes- 
terday was the election for the Constitution. Cranston 
and Barker go to Lawrence as delegates, and to elect 
State officers. 

" Did you hear of Mr. Pomeroy being taken pris- 
oner, and being detained in the enemy's camp five days, 
three miles from Lawrence? I was in great fear for 
some days, and felt greatly relieved when that Law- 
rence affair was settled." 

Having returned to Osawatomie, Mr. Brown, in 
March, 1856, wrote in better spirits than he would 
have indulged could he have foreseen the history of the 
next six months. 

" Our cause daily brightens. Let them curse! God 
reigns, and right will rule. Let the ' Border Ruffians ' 

62 



AN EVENTFUL YEAR 

rage, and the Missourians imagine a vain thing ! The 
' Yankees ' are not the pusillanimous creatures they 
had supposed from seeing the poor white men of the 
slave States. Let us have more men (settlers and 
their families), and money to aid in paying expenses 
of our Free-State movements, and mills to cut lumber 
for houses, and in two years we will defy Missouri and 
F. Pierce in the bargain. But to do this the North 
must stand up for us and never flinch, always holding 
herself ready to avenge wrongs and aid in fighting 
our battles. Let the North know that the Southerners, 
accustomed to ride rough-shod over humanity's dear- 
est rights, care no more for law, and for personal and 
property rights, than so many Arabs do. If their 
course is continued they must be flogged into better 
behaviour. Their position over a few poor blacks makes 
them really believe that they are the only portion of 
mankind worthy of consideration, and that all others 
are mere hirelings, fit only to do their bidding. ' ' 

About the same time he wrote, ' ' The piano arrived, 
22d inst., at Kansas City, on the Genoa, and the in- 
closed letter will show you what the ' Border Ruffians ' 
are ' up to ' just now. Each boat gets overhauled 
by the * Law and Order ' Committee of Lexing- 
ton." This was an allusion to an incident as annoy- 
ing at the time as it was amusing to the Browns after- 
ward. " The great box which contained the piano 
for Spencer's sister awakened, as it went by steamboat 

63 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

up the Missouri River, the suspicions of Southerners. 
' More Sharpe 's rifles ! ' The box must be opened. It 
was landed on the levee at Kansas City. A great crowd 
looked on in breathless silence. The top of the box 
was violently removed. The men surged towards the 
centre to get a peep. A piano ! Nothing more ! The 
lid of the instrument was raised. Only the keys and 
wires of harmony appeared. No rifles, no pistols, no 
cutlasses, or bowie-knives. The voice of one of the 
leaders broke the silence' Music hath charms to 
soothe the savage breast. ' The piano was allowed to go 
forward to its destination. Because of its history the 
famous John Brown said that if it belonged to him 
one thousand dollars should not buy it. ' ' 

Mr. Brown refers, in a letter, to the determination 
of the Free-State men to resist the execution of laws 
enacted by the so-called ' ' Legislature ' ' elected by the 
votes of Missourian invaders. 

" We have a call out for a mass-meeting here on 
Wednesday, to unite in open defiance and resistance 
to the attempt now making to assess and collect taxes 
under the ' Border Ruffian Laws.' We are a unit. 
This is the first gentle breeze put in motion in central 
Kansas towards subjecting us to the yoke. May the 
earthquake swallow us after the tornado hath blasted 
us if we submit to this fiendish enactment ! ' ' 

The Pro-Slavery leaders were striking with a 
sledge-hammer the cap of a percussion bomb-shell!

They struck, and struck again. When the explosion 
came those who wielded the hammer were entirely de- 
stroyed. 

Kansas was much disturbed throughout this year 
by incursions of banditti and by camps of Southerners. 
Some magnanimous and really chivalrous gentlemen 
allowed themselves to be so influenced by the prevail- 
ing sentiment of the communities in which they lived 
that they joined the invading forces and crossed the 
border with bodies of armed men who were bent on 
lawless and murderous work. The soil was open to all 
the world for settlement. No one disputed the right 
of Southern men to immigrate to Kansas. Only their 
attempts to rule the elections by arms and violence, or 
through importation of illegal voters, are to be con- 
demned. As we have seen, men who were in no sense 
citizens of Kansas took possession of the polls and 
elected a legislature which, having no constitutional 
or legal existence, must have been disowned whatever 
laws it had passed. It enacted some statutes that were 
oppressive, others that took away from the citizens of 
the Territory privileges guaranteed to them by the Con- 
stitution of the United States. The settlers would 
tolerate no such tyranny. Their battle for their rights 
was long, and finally victorious; but much hardship, 
much injury, they had yet to endure after Mr. Brown 
wrote those defiant sentences. 

On June 6, 1856, Osawatomie was sacked at mid- 
65 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

day. Much valuable property was carried off. The 
town was the third in size in Kansas, so rapidly had 
it grown. The invaders approached Mr. Brown's 
house. He was sick in bed. Spencer ran to his father 's 
room with the tidings. Fortunately a few settlers had 
armed themselves for the defence of their property. 
Their gleaming guns warned the enemy of danger, and 
the house of Mr. Brown was left unentered ; but every 
other house in the neighbourhood was plundered. The 
stores were robbed. A printing-press, with a copy of 
the Osawatomie Herald just " set up," was demol- 
ished. 

After this raid all was alarm. Men stood guard at 
night. " Weapons were kept conveniently near the 
sleeper. ' ' Horses, saddled and bridled, were hitched to 
doors and windows, for the double purpose of being out 
of the way of prowling thieves and of standing ready 
"to be mounted by their owners in case of surprise 
or attack. Surmises of outrage, reports of invasion, 
the discharge of musketry, the shouts of threatening 
men, and the barking and howling of dogs, filled the 
night with excitement and forebodings of evil. ' '

CHAPTER X 

LEAVES FROM SPENCER 's JOURNAL 

BOYS, or young men, soon become habituated to 
the excitements and dangers of such a life as Spencer 
and his brother must have led that summer. In the 
war to subdue the great rebellion (1861-65) it was 
observed that those whose faces blanched at the first 
sight of but one man slain in battle would soon walk 
among thousands of the killed and wounded with ap- 
parent insensibility. Their feelings were not seared; 
they were only under control. Soldiers cannot afford 
to expend emotion and vital force in mourning for 
every fallen companion. The will represses the feel- 
ings, or absolutely controls them. To suffer on each 
occasion as keenly as at first, in sympathy for the 
wounded or sorrow for the dead, would unfit a man for 
military service. He must employ the anaesthetic pow- 
er of a strong will. It behooves him, as a soldier, to 
deny indulgence to thoughts and emotions which just 
then have no useful office to fulfil. To allow them full 
exercise would interfere with rigorous performance 
of the duty of the hour. He does not accustom him- 
self to the thought of carnage; he simply refuses to 

67 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

admit that thought. He cannot afford the wear and 
tear of its unseasonable obtrusion. My knowledge of 
these truths comes through experience. No doubt 
multitudes of soldiers would attest its accuracy. 

No historian could register events that took place 
thousands of years ago more calmly than Spencer 
writes about tragedies that fell under his own eye. 
Let no one imagine that the boy's sensibilities were 
blunted; they were only wisely schooled. 

" Then came the war in Kansas, so well known to 
every one, ' ' runs the ' ' journal. " "In May the ' Pot- 
tawatomie Massacre ' took place. The attack on Law- 
rence, and the sacking of Osawatomie on the 6th of 
June followed. On the morning of August 30th, 
Rocky, Brennan, and I were getting breakfast. Father 
was in Lawrence. Mother and the other children had 
gone to the East 1 because of the war. Our house was 
occupied by some young men set for the defence of 
the town. I was setting the table, Rock was cutting 
the beefsteak, and Brennan was attending to the fire 
and coffee, when, hearing a shot and looking out, he 
hollowed' Spencer, the Missourians are coming! ' 

" I immediately ran to the door, and seeing them I 

called to Rock. Brennan began to search for his arms, 

and I, seizing my hat, started for town. My first plan 

was to go down and look at the safe in Father's office 

and then go over the river. I ran as fast as I could,

and met, or rather overtook, Holmes at the foot of the 
hill. My desire was to inform the people. The first 
house I came to was Lake's. They were eating break- 
fast. Hearing the news his wife began to cry. I then 
met Mr. Merritt, who said the enemy were forming on 
the hill and numbered about two hundred but I after- 
ward learned there were nearly four hundred. Find- 
ing the office locked, I got into the window and saw 
the safe was all right. Got a rifle belonging to my 
cousin, W., and hid it in a cornfield. Just then the 
battle commenced and I jumped upon a pile of logs to 
see the fight. I did not look long, but soon went to the 
' Block-House ' and asked if they wanted a gun. They 
told me to bring it along, which I did, running as fast 
as possible, as I had to go very close to the Missourians. 
When I got back to the ' Block-House ' all the men left 
it and went down to the woods, and I with them. I 
separated from them and went to the house of Mr. 
Sears, who was in the fight. 

" Finding a horse tied near the house, I brought 
it and helped his wife to go over the river out of the 
dangers of the battle. After getting her trunks out, 
into the bushes, I went back to where they were fight- 
ing. I mixed freely among the Missourians, talking, 
until a man named Taggart, who knew me, took me 
prisoner. I will acknowledge my blood grew cold when 
he told me to follow him. I did not say anything, 
however. He took me to a house where they had f our- 
6 69 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

teen other prisoners. They afterward took four others, 
Dutch Charley, Fuller, Reynolds, and Thomas. Soon 
they began to question me wanted to know how many 
Free-State men there were, and if I was ' Old John 
Brown's son.' I told them I did not know how many 
Free-State men there were thought about fifty at the 
most, but doubted if there were as many. They told 
me that I lied that there were two hundred and fifty. 
I said that I was not Captain Brown's son. Then I 
heard the word given to burn the town, which made 
a very hot fire. 

" After that they loaded the wagon with the goods 
plundered from the houses. One of them ordered me 
to put the chairs on the wagon, which I did not do, 
whereupon he came running at me with his bayonet, 
cursing, and threatening to ' stick ' me if I did not do 
it. I remember that two of the prisoners had chills, 
so they asked and got permission to stand on the sunny 
side of the house. Several of the Missourians were 
very badly wounded. On their retreat from the town 
they stopped at our house, which they plundered and 
then burnt. . . . They attempted to get out the 
piano, but in the excitement, and the heat of the rap- 
idly spreading flames, they were compelled to drop it 
in the doorway. Two partly burnt legs and the iron 
frame, only, remained to tell the story of its end. 
Here I noticed one of the wounded enemy shot in the 
mouth, and another had been shot through the lungs. 

70 



FROM SPENCER'S JOURNAL 

The few Free-State men, under the cover of the tim- 
ber, led by Captain Brown, had an excellent chance to 
use their Sharpe's rifles upon the enemy, who came 
down the hill in half -moon shape and closed in upon 
the boys in their hidden position. 

"All this time I was without shoes or stock- 
ings. They allowed me, before the burning, to get 
from the house some things. I met a man with my 
violin, which I got from him, but not without some 
trouble. I found two or three suits of clothes and 
underwear, as they had just come from the washer- 
woman, and I got a pair of moccasins. One man gave 
me my fish-hook and line, another my saddle, which I 
could not take. I walked out to the road, where I saw 
a man take our horse. They made me ride her a little 
way. There was a fire raging in one of the chambers 
when I first reached home, and soon all was in a blaze. 
After I had ridden a little way, they put me in a 
wagon, but I soon gave it up to a sick man for the 
horse, which I continued to ride the rest of the way 
nearly forty miles. I had nothing to eat that day until 
late in the afternoon, when we stopped and got a little 
dinner. All this time I had been in charge of a 
man named John Hancock, from Howard County, Mis- 
souri. 

"After that, we left the road and cut across the 
prairie. Between there and camp, Martin White and 
his brother overtook us. I heard the old man tell how 

71 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

he murdered poor Fred Brown, 1 whose dead body I 
saw lying alongside of the road. Poor Fred! His 
grave is only marked by a plain board. William Gar- 
rison was murdered at the same time. When we got 
within four or five miles of the camp, a man came to 
hurry us up, as General Lane had drawn up his men 
to fight, near the camp; so after that we rode at full 
speed. Once, when very tired, and out of breath by 
riding so hard, I poked my hat so that it sat lightly on 
my head, and the wind blew it off; so my guard had 
to stop and get it, and I got a chance to breathe. When 
we got close to camp he said I could get off and stop 
there if I would promise not to run away ; but I pre- 
ferred to go on. When we got to camp he went out to 
fight, and I got a piece of bread which was very 
tough. That night I slept, or tried to sleep, in a tent 
with ten or twelve men. 

' ' I said that Lane had drawn up his men to fight. 
So when I got to camp all was commotion. The Mis- 
sourians had formed their men, in number twelve hun- 
dred, under the command of General McLean, with 
six cannon to resist two hundred and fifty Free-State 
men. There was no fighting, however, on account, 
probably, of each waiting for the other to commence. 
The Missouri picket-guards were troubled very 
much by the Free-State men shooting them in the 
night.

72 



" The next morning, which was Sunday, August 
31st, I was arrested, by daylight, and taken to the tent 
where the rest of the prisoners were, and put under 
the charge of twelve armed men, with the observation, 
' Look out for him : he 's sharp as a thorn ! ' So much 
of a reputation had I acquired. Seated in a tent, on 
the ground, trying to keep warm, I had my first op- 
portunity for reflection. No room to stand up or lie 
down nothing to do but to sit, and hardly room for 
that, my feet soaking wet for I had nothing but moc- 
casins on. After the sun had risen a little, the guard 
marched the prisoners in single file to headquarters. 
While in the tent we were continually teased by the 
Missourians with such expressions as ' Abo- 
litionists! ' and the like. When we were before the 

officers' tent, Colonel A , of Lexington, came to 

us, and spoke to me. He said I was very young to be 
in such a place, and then asked my name. I told him, 
and he said, ' Spencer, if you will be a good boy and 
obey your father and mother, and obey the laws, I will 
let you go home. ' I said nothing. He again repeated 
it. Still I said nothing. He then took me to 
the officers' tent and told General McLean to make 
me out a passport. While he was writing it somebody 

came and spoke to Colonel A , who then spoke to 

General McLean, and then came and spoke to me and 
said there were men who did not like my being set free 
and were waiting to shoot me when I left camp, 

73 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

and that I had better wait and go with him to West 
Port. 

11 When Colonel A had told me I could go 

home I turned to the prisoners and asked if they had 
any word to send home. Those were the last words 
I had a chance to speak to them, and I was obliged to 
bear the disappointment as best I could. Then came 
breakfast, I eating with the officers in their tent, while 
the rest of the prisoners ate after the negroes, who 
were slaves belonging to Majors and Russell, the great 
Western freighters. 

"After breakfast, while I was sitting in the officers' 

tent, Joseph A , the colonel's son and member of 

the Kansas Bogus Legislature, brought a knife-basket 
of Mother's, which had two sets of knives in it when 
taken away from our house, but only one now ; and a 
music-book belonging to my Aunt Mary Crane. But 
for some reason I could never bring myself to think 

much of A , in spite of all he did for me. While 

we were sitting in the officers' tent that Sunday morn- 
ing, one of the officers wanted me to play on the violin, 
and pressed me to, very much. However, I did not 
choose to gratify him, because, first, I could not play 
very well ; besides which I did not feel much like grati- 
fying him then. However, he excused me himself, by 
saying that he knew it was Sunday. I am ashamed to 
say I had totally forgotten that it was Sunday. 

"After an early dinner the whole camp was in mo- 
74 



FROM SPENCER'S JOURNAL 

tion, preparatory to breaking up for Missouri. I was 
placed in a wagon with a wounded man by the name 
of Cline, and my business was to support his leg, which 
was broken in the shin by a Sharpe's rifle-ball. You 
may be sure that it was no pleasant job. I had to carry 
a man 's wounded leg fifteen miles. I should not like to 
do it again. On the way, we were followed by Lane, 
who burned a house near to where the camp was be- 
fore, at the head of Bull Creek, on the Santa Fe road. 
The Missourians camped that night on Cedar Creek, 
which they said was fifteen miles from Bull Creek. 
They butchered some of John Brown's cattle, and part 
of them at the other camp. 

" Early the next morning ' Dutch Charley ' l was 
murdered by Coleman, the murderer of Dow. From 
the first, after being taken prisoner at the battle, at 
Osawatomie, he felt a conviction that they would kill 
him. He told one of his fellow-prisoners that he knew 
Coleman was determined to take his life. It was a 
cold-blooded and premeditated murder. The officers, 
especially General McLean, exculpated the savage from 
any blame in the matter. That morning, while I was 
sitting in the surgeons' tent (I had been placed in their 

care) , Doctor K asked me if I would go down with 

him to his farm and stay with him for twelve months 
and study either law or medicine. I passed that off, 
and joked, and made no answer. Some of the surgeons

afterward advised me to go, and said the Doctor was 
rich and had some pretty daughters. A little 
while afterward he again made the same offer, and I, 
remembering the fate of ' Dutch Charley, ' and seeing 
that the Doctor was serious, accepted it, with the con- 
dition that any time Father wrote for me to come home 
I should be allowed to go. 

" That day they broke up camp and moved to In- 
dian Creek thirteen miles. Crowds deserted daily, 
whole companies of one hundred and more leaving at 
once. Doctor K said he should leave in the morn- 
ing. That day General McLean said he had an oppor- 
tunity to send a letter to Lawrence and I could write 
if I wished, on condition that I should say nothing 
about their numbers, etc. which I promised. I am 

not sure whether it was McLean or A that said 

this. I wrote the following note, insisting, however, 
that he should read it, because, if anything should 
happen, no blame could then be laid to that letter 
all of which he thought to be right and proper. 

' ' ' DEAR FATHER : I write this to ease your mind of 
any apprehension you might have on my account. I 
was taken in town. As I passed by our house I saw it 
burned, and the piano in it. I was allowed to take 
what I wanted in the shape of clothing. I am as well 
treated as I should be under your own care. There is 

76 



FROM SPENCER'S JOURNAL 

nothing to fear on my account. Brennan, Whit, 1 and 
Rock are safe. So is Uncle Charley and his family. 
" ' No more until I write again. 

" ' Your affectionate son, 

" ' SPENCER.' 

" ' September 2d, 1856.' 

" Early in the morning Doctor K put my 

things in the wagon of a man named P . My things 

consisted of my violin; half of a double harness, ex- 
cepting the collar ; a music-book belonging to my Aunt 
Mary Crane ; one set of knives and forks, and basket, 

of Mother's; and a few clothes. That P totally 

disgusted me with tobacco and bad whisky before I 

arrived at West Port. Doctor K , in the meantime, 

went to Little Santa Fe. When we arrived at West 

Port, A was making a speech on the subject of 

Brown's taking McKinney's train. At the conclusion 
of this speech he named the ninth day of the month 
for another gathering. 

" There I was taunted by the boys in the street 

with ' Yankee! ' and the like. At this time all 

West Port was apprehending an attack from ' Jim 
Lane, ' who sent word to the people of West Port and 
Kansas City that he would come and take breakfast 
with them some fine morning.

77 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" This alarmed them very much, and so they set 
guards and pickets to watch out for the enemy, who 
was busy in other directions and wished those in West 
Port and Kansas City to stay at home while he pun- 
ished Lecompton. 

' ' ' The wicked flee when no man pursueth ! ' 

" Here P had a horse that wanted shoeing, so 

he took him to the blacksmith's shop, ordering me to 
follow. When we got there, it being a very warm day, 
he stood and brushed the flies from the horse, and made 
me do the same ; which thing will fix my remembrance 

of him. Doctor K always calls him my friend 

P . While I sat in the wagon at West Port, I, 

having no stockings, asked a man to get me a couple 
of pairs, and gave him the money. I had nearly six 
dollars. He soon brought me the stockings, and gave 
me back the money; neither would he take any pay. 
I afterward learned that it was Lieutenant Bledsoe, 
of Lexington, Missouri. After remaining some time, 

P started on for Missouri. On the way he was 

continually drinking whisky and chewing tobacco, 
until he became positively disgusting. He would make 
me drive, and tried to make me sing. 

' ' When about two miles out, we met Doctor K , 

and P turned back with him to West Port, of 

course taking me with him. While there Doctor K , 

finding my dislike of P so great, offered me a horse 

to ride with him if I chose, which offer I gladly accept-

FROM SPENCER'S JOURNAL 

ed. So we dragged out an old saddle from the recesses 
of that wagon and put it on the old white mare called 
' Puss, ' and I gladly mounted. That night we stopped 
about six miles from West Port and sixteen miles from 

Doctor K 's. In this house (of one of Doctor 

K 's friends) we had comfortable lodging, I sleep- 
ing with Doctor K . 

' * In the morning we started in good season. On the 
way, speaking of the ' Fugitive Slave Law ' I said it 
was contrary to the Bible. He asserted that I was mis- 
takenneither had I the means of proving it to him 
then. Afterward, while I was in Utica, I wrote, and 
sent him the following : 

" * Deuteronomy xxiii. 15. " Thou shalt not de- 
liver unto his master the servant which is escaped from 
his master unto thee; he shall dwell with thee, even 
among you, in that place which he shall choose in one 
of thy gates where it liketh him best ; thou shalt not 
oppress him. ' ' 

' ' I remember, on the way, coming to a melon field. 

Doctor K stopped, and dismounting we got all the 

melons we could eat. We passed through Chapel Hill, 
where a man wanted me to go into the grocery and 
provision business with him, I to act in the capacity of 
clerk which I declined. Here, at my solicitation, 

Doctor K bought me a pair of very good shoes. 

Chapel Hill was but a few miles from his house. 

" We arrived at Hazel Glen, the Doctor's place, 
79 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

about twilight, or dusk. Mrs. K came out to meet 

him, crying, but I never could find out why. ' ' 

Of the Doctor, Spencer elsewhere tells us that ' ' He 
was short in stature and quiet, yet loving his joke and 
blessed with a keen-thinking mind ; and withal a good 
lawyer and physician. ' ' 

With what naivete the boy's comments are put 
down! 

Such reflections as he condescends to whisper to his 
cipher journal give great significance to the words of 
the sagacious guard " Look out for him. He's sharp 
as a thorn." His silence means more than another 
boy's speech. How curious and wise was his man- 
ner of receiving Colonel A 's overtures! " I 

said nothing. He again repeated it. Still I said 
nothing." No words could have been as golden as 
that discreet and strong silence. Of his conduct on the 
journey, his father tells us that " The little fourteen- 
year-old captive excited much interest among the bet- 
ter class of Missourians, and, very naturally, they en- 
gaged him in conversation, plying him with questions 
which he disposed of so readily and wisely as to cause 
them chagrin and mortification; when some of them 
were rude to him. Afterward he would say to such 
as wished to talk, ' If I am to talk as a boy you will 
say, later in the argument, Shut up, boy ! So if you 
want me to talk it must be as a man.' After this he 
was better treated."

FROM SPENCER'S JOURNAL 

But wise as the boy was, he could not tell why that 
lady was in tears. O Spencer, if you had returned to 
your home in safety, after the anxiety and suspense 
endured by your wife and mother and sister in 1863, 
you would not have wondered to see tears raining from 
the eyes of all the women that loved you. 

Spencer could not comprehend, in 1856, the emo- 
tions of the devoted wife of a man whose life had been 
exposed to the risks of battle.

CHAPTER XI 

CAPTIVITY SWEETENED 

ALL that I have to impart as to this portion of 
Spencer's life the reader shall learn as I learned it 
from the boy 's journal. 

He is writing now about Doctor K 's home in 

the country. Hazel Glen was in Lafayette County, 
Missouri. " The house," the journal tells us, " was 
in the midst of a lawn of blue-grass so thick and soft 
as to feel like feathers under your feet. This lawn 
was thick with honey-locust and thorn-trees, which 
had been set out, and with hickory-trees growing wild, 
with nuts nearly ripe. It seemed like an ideal dreamy 
home which I have so often wished for. Hazel Glen, 
I often think of you! How I wandered round the 
house into the garden, like one in a dream ! Ah ! no one 
knows the emotions I felt in being led a prisoner to 
Missouri, and the pleasant surprise of such a charming 
resting-place and home after the weary days of sus- 
pense, privation, and loneliness to say nothing of the 
insults of the unthinking crowd. But these are no 
longer thought of not even that I was a prisoner, car- 
ried by the destroyer of my home more than a hundred

miles into a hostile country for a single glance of a 
dear girl, whose name fills my heart with a thousand 
tender memories, more than compensates for all. Dear 
Mary! 

' ' We sat down to supper alone, the Doctor and I, 
all the others having had their tea. We were served 
by two little negro boys, Harry and Oliver, little imps, 
not only of darkness but of mischief. I also saw two 
long brushes l made of peacock-feathers hanging 
against the wall. I certainly ought not to forget to 
mention the cook, Avina. She was very black and fat, 
and her flesh fairly quivered all over her when she 
laughed, which happened neither few times nor far 
between. Friday, September 7th, Colonel Boone, of 
West Port, sent the letter I wrote Father from camp, 
accompanied by the following of his own : 

" 'MR. 0. C. BROWN SIR: 

" ' I inclose the letter from your son. I saw and 
conversed with him in camp. He is very well, and is 
now at Lexington with Colonel 0. A , who will take 
good care of him. I asked the staff to let me have him, 
but they thought he would be safer from insult there 
than here. I saw an Indian, to-day, from Paola, who 
said your other son, perhaps the younger one, was 
much distressed about you and his brother. I sent him 
word that his brother was safe and well, and for the

citizens to send him to me and I would take good care 
of him and send him to his mother, or keep him until 
I had orders from you. As a number of persons, I 
understand, will leave there next week for the East, 
it is possible they may bring him in. If so, I will write 
you immediately, as I am sure you will be uneasy 
about him. Should he come, I will do all I can to make 
him happy, and so will my father. Your son saved 
the likeness of his grandfather, which General Mc- 
Lean found in the things of one of the soldiers. 
' ' ' Be pleased to hear from you. ' 
" ' Respectfully, 

11 'A. G. BOONE.'" 

I must here break in upon Spencer's journal to call 
attention to the expression this letter gives to the spirit 
of that large class of gentlemen, who, however attached 
to the horrible institution of slavery, and in some ways 
perverted by it, were, morally and socially, at the other 
extreme from that ruffianly element of Southern peo- 
ple which we have had too much occasion to observe in 
our review of the history of Kansas. I have myself 
seen too many Southerners of this noble kind, have re- 
ceived from them too much kindness, enjoyed too often 
their generous hospitality, witnessed in too many cases 
the fruits of Christian faith and charity in their lives, 
to miss this fitting opportunity to discriminate between 
them and the vulgar horde which simply carries to 

84 



CAPTIVITY SWEETENED 

logical conclusions the false premises on which alone 
slavery can stand. Those premises lead to contempt 
for the African ; to denial of his rights, social and polit- 
ical ; to theories which contradict all republican prin- 
ciples ; and to the lawlessness and violence which have 
ever been a manifestation of the malice engendered by 
false adjustments of the races. 

All over the South there have always been great 
numbers of men and women whose principles and char- 
acters were formed under the instruction of the Divine 
Teacher. If their interpretation of the Scriptures, on 
points that bore upon the " Peculiar Institution " of 
their part of the United States, was wrested, to accord 
with their social and commercial interests, we need 
not wonder. Illustrations of this kind of juggling 
with the Bible are not wanting in the history of the 
Northern States may be found, also, I presume to 
suggest, in many pages of the proceedings of the 
British Parliament, and even in the records of rudi- 
mentary work of Scotch and English missionary socie- 
ties. Human nature has in it so much of evil that any 
institution which denies that "A man's a man, for a' 
that " (as caste did in India, as slavery did in Amer- 
ica) , is sure to prove a hot-house for the rapid germina- 
tion and growth of every noxious seed of selfishness 
and cruelty. 

It is a joy to turn from the spectacle of wild beasts 
and gladiators in Kansas to come face to face with the 
7 85 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

gentleman who wrote that letter to Spencer's father, 
and to allow one's thoughts to share the sweet and 

simple pleasures of Doctor K 's family at Hazel 

Glen. 

The journal includes, next, a copy of a letter writ- 
ten by the boy to his mother. Part of this I omit. 

Describing the position of Doctor K 's home, 

Spencer says it is " in Lafayette County, within fifteen 
miles of Lexington, on the Missouri River. ' ' He then 
writes, ' ' As I said before, I have no desire to leave now. 
Any time I wish, a good horse is at my service, to go 

anywhere I choose to ride; and Doctor K (for 

that is my host's name) says he would trust me with 
the best horse he has, to go even to Lexington. This 
he told a person, a friend of his, who came to see him, 
and said there would be a fuss made about keeping me, 
by my father in particular and the rest of the anti- 
slavery world in general. 

" You can imagine the rest of my treatment, as I 
tell you a part. I sit at the table, two out of three 
meals, to the exclusion of the Doctor's children. I 
have no lack of employments, as there are plenty of 
books in the house which I have always wanted but 
never had the opportunity to read. Besides, when 
these fail, there is either a shot-gun or a rifle and 
plenty of ammunition, besides my violin, and plenty 
of nuts and apples ; and a young lady to court ! This, 
however, I should not do except as a last resort ! 

86 



' ' The Doctor has a fine, brick, two-story house, and 
a large farm of over two thousand acres, worked by 
about twenty negroes. You must direct your letters 

to me to the care of Doctor James K , Lexington 

Missouri. 

' ' Rocky and Aunt Mary were not taken prisoners, 
or harmed. Pa is safe in Lawrence. . . . You 
must have no thought of coming back to the Territory. 
I am, at present, as safe as I possibly could be. Give 
yourself no anxiety about me. Then, ' to wind up de 
conclusion wid de end, ' * read the Third Epistle of 
John, 13th and 14th verses. I will give you a fuller 
account of what has happened next time. Write 
nothing in your letters now that will not bear reading 
by others.

" S. K. B. 

' ' This letter was published in Buffalo. I received 
the following from my mother in reply: 

" < Buffalo, September 18, 1856. 
' ' ' MY DARLING CHILD :

friends wherever you are. Cornelia is at Miss Kelly's 
school, in Utica, and I very much wish you were with 
me here. Can you not come to Chicago, and, finding 
your Uncle Horton, at 124 La Salle Street, remain 
there until you can inform me? Will you tell your 
friend, the Doctor, that I very much desire this 1 

' ' ' I have not heard from Rockwell, and am feeling 
very anxious about him. 

' ' ' We are much amused with your description of 
the manner of passing your time. You must find some 
choice books to interest you so much. . . . They 
all send love to you. If you remain where you are, 
long, write to me often, and believe me, you are not 
forgotten. To God I commend you, my dear child. 

" ' YOUR MOTHER.' 

" Some two weeks after this I wrote another and 
longer letter home. The first three weeks I passed in 
reading several select novels such as 'Rienzi, the Last 
of the Romans,' ' The Last Days of Pompeii,' etc. 
During the day, I was with Bella K , in the morn- 
ing, and reading in the afternoon. Occasionally I 
would play checkers or backgammon with Mollie in 
the evening. The first three weeks, Mollie, Perry, and 
two others of the children went to Mr. Taylor's school 
so then I was almost alone in the house. Doctor 

K gave me permission to use either his rifle or 

shot-gun ; but, although I travelled through the woods 

88 



CAPTIVITY SWEETENED 

a great deal, I never even got a shot. Of course no 
game. Time passed slowly until, at last, vacation 
came, and Mollie and Perry were at home and had some 
company. 

' ' 'Twas then I became interested in that girl, and 
began to appreciate her good qualities. The more I 
think of her the more I love her. When I first en- 
tered the house, I have said how I felt when Mollie 
was the first to say, ' Do, Ma, send Perry out to ask 
him to come in; he looks so sad.' 

" Checkers and backgammon were only an excuse 
to look at and speak with her. I remember one night 
I got a ' wish-bone ' and broke it with her, I getting 
the longest part. When she had gone out of the room, 
I got up and put it over the door, black ' Vina ' watch- 
ing me all the time. I soon called Mollie in, and she 
came, perfectly unconscious of any joke. ' Vina ' be- 
gan to laugh, and we both began to tease Mollie, and 
she was much vexed. In a few minutes I went up- 
stairs and began to read, and she commenced helping 
* Vina ' to wash dishes. ' Vina ' was joking Mollie, 
when I heard her suddenly say, ' If he comes down 
stairs I will box his ears! ' Therewith I was seized 
with a desire to know whether she would be as good 
as her word; so I dropped my book and went down- 
stairs, through the room where they were, and into 
the kitchen. I stayed there a few minutes, and then 
opened the door to go into the dining-room, when Mol- 

89 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

lie suddenly hit me a slap in the face that fairly 
blinded me. I did not say a word, but went right up- 
stairs and then to bed. The next morning she inquired 
if I was hurt. I thought the more of her for that 
blow. 

' ' We used to go out and gather walnuts simply to 
talk together. One afternoon we picked evergreens and 
had great fun in staining each other's faces and hands. 

I remember, in a letter, even Mrs. K joked me 

about it. 

" The first Sunday I went to ' meeting ' I saw 

Mary T , and asked to be introduced to her. 

I was not deceived in my opinion of her at first 
sight. 

" Early in October I received my first and only 
letter from Father, accompanied by a note from Colo- 
nel A giving his permission to my return home, 

and asking me to visit him at his place in Lexington. 
This was the time of the great ' Fair ' in Lexington ; 
so I put what few things I had into one part of Doctor 

K 's saddle-bags, and was soon ready. Perry went 

with me on horseback, and Mollie and Belle in the 
buggy with Doctor K . It was a raw, cold morn- 
ing, and horseback riding did not seem very pleasant. 

When we went, Mrs. K came out to the gate and 

shook hands with me and kissed me. Why should I 

blush to say it ? Mrs. K was a good woman and 

one that I could have chosen to be my mother. 

90 



"And now for my experience at Lexington. The 
day being raw and cold, we were glad to reach town 
in the afternoon. Having reached the Fair Grounds, 

we stopped on the south side, and Doctor K gave 

Perry and myself some money to get us some dinner. 
I sat with Mollie most of the afternoon. That evening, 
the hotel being crowded, Perry and myself took lodg- 
ings at Colonel A 's. The next morning I went to 

the Fair again, where I met Mary T and her 

friend, Miss A . In the evening, at the Colonel's, 

Miss Kate played the piano, which so reminded me of 
home as to sadden my heart. ... I concluded to 
go up-town and see Mollie. I excused myself and 
started off, and stopped at Walton's Hotel, where the 

K s were. Mrs. K asked me to go with Mollie 

and Perry to the ' Baptist Tea Party, ' giving six shil- 
lings to pay our fare and to spend. Everybody went 
promenading, so I followed suit; spent the evening 
rather pleasantly, and went to the hotel, where I 
stayed a little while and talked with Mollie, and went 

back to Colonel A 's deeper in love than ever. 

The remembrance of those hours is very pleasant to 
me now. 

" The next day, at the Fair, as usual; but spent 
the afternoon shopping. Bought a penknife and pock- 
et-book for Mollie. At the hotel again in the evening, 
with Mollie. Heard some very fine music, the guitar, 
violin, and piano, together. In the course of the even- 

91 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

ing Mollie said they (the K s) were going home 

the next day. I then presented her with the pocket- 
book and knife. She said nothing, but her eyes looked 
thanks. That look was something more than thanks. 
It was love glorious, soul-thrilling love. 

" 'Twas late when I went home that evening. The 

next day I went to the Fair in a hack with the A s. 

Sat with Mollie all the morning. Oh! those looks 
she gave me ! I shall always remember them. I took 
the pocket-book and wrote words on a piece of paper, 
which I put in the pocket-book and gave it to her. Can 
you guess what they were ? ' I love you. ' I told her 
to read what I had written when she was alone, and 
think of me. Another look ! She said nothing. 

" Doctor K left at noon and I said good-bye 

to all. I kissed my hand to Mollie as we were going out 
of the gate, and I saw them no more. 

" October 5th, that evening, I spent at the hotel 

with Mary T , and heard some music. The next 

day I got things to go home, or, rather, to Utica. I 

spent the afternoon at the hotel with Mary T , who 

endeared herself to me very much in those few days 
as a friend, I mean. At that time she made me a 
present of a book called ' Young Man 's Sunday Book, ' 
which I still have. Sunday I went to meeting with 
Mary. I asked her to write to me and tell me about 
Mollie, which she promised to do. 

"At one o'clock that night I went on board the 
92 



CAPTIVITY SWEETENED 

William Campbell, a steamer bound for St. Louis. I 
went to bed on board the boat, kissed the ring that 
Mollie gave me, and went to sleep. 

' ' I arrived in St. Louis in the evening of the four- 
teenth. I went to Barnum's Hotel, registered my 
name, took a room, and went to bed. Rose early, 
. . . and bought a ticket for Chicago by the Illi- 
nois Central Railroad. Got some breakfast and took 
a boat for Alton, and reached Chicago late that night. 
When within a few miles of town I made the acquaint- 
ance of a gentleman who kindly, on our arrival, went 
with me to Uncle Horton's house otherwise I should 
have been obliged to go to a hotel. The next day 
Uncle Crane came. He had been lecturing, out in the 
country, on Kansas. I was very kindly received here, 
and made many valuable acquaintances of persons who 
knew Father and took a deep interest in questions 
relating to Kansas. In the afternoon I went with my 
uncles to the ' Great Northwest Democratic Rally. ' 1 
The spirit of the meeting seemed to be that Democracy 
and Slavery were twin brothers and Liberty a poor 
relation. In the evening I went to a Fremont meeting 
[Republican party] and heard some splendid singing. 
Heard Senator John P. Hale, Theodore Parker, and 
others, speak. With them equal rights for all was the 
great idea. Sunday afternoon I heard Fred Douglas, 

A meeting of men of the so-called Democratic party, the can- 
didate of which for the Presidency was James Buchanan.

started for Utica by the Lake Shore route, arriving 
early Tuesday morning. ' ' 

The remainder of this year Spencer passed among 
friends and relatives in the State of New York.

CHAPTER XII 

MR. BROWN'S COMMENTS ON CONDITIONS IN KANSAS 

ON September 2, 1856, Mr. 0. C. Brown wrote from 
Lawrence to his mother and sister, who were in Utica, 
New York, all he had been able to learn about the sack- 
ing of Osawatomie and the captivity of Spencer. 

" Our worst fears are being realized. Kansas is 
the scene of bloody strife. Murder, house-burning, 
and pillage are the order of the day. Missouri has 
poured into our border two thousand armed men whose 
purpose is to starve out Free-State settlers and de- 
stroy their homes and utterly rout us from the soil. 
Our people are in arms, fighting as best they can, and 
fully determined to conquer or die. Indeed no other 
alternative is left us. It is fight or starve for adhe- 
sion to the * Bogus Laws ' never will be given. Many 
of our people are prisoners, and some, we have reason 
to believe, have been cruelly murdered. Several of the 
fortified posts of the Georgians, who were stealing and 
murdering, were broken up by our people. . . . 
Routed from their strongholds, . . . they broke 
for Missouri, . . . and then, with Atchison and 
Stringfellow, they make the seventh invasion of this 

95 



fair land in less than two years. . . . Leaven- 
worth is shut out from us, the United States mails 
stopped, several of our people are held as prisoners. 

" Five hundred [of the enemy] go on to Leeomp- 
ton and are now burning houses and crops of Free- 
State men about that place. Several were burned last 
night, others the night before. From West Port 
twelve x hundred march out upon the Santa Fe road, 
and so down to Osawatomie, and burn and pillage 
that town, after a heroic resistance by a few noble 
fellows who killed and wounded thirty-seven of the 
invaders. Another band of seventy-five go on to Ot- 
tawa Jones's (an educated Indian, with a white wife) 
and burn his house, he barely getting away in his 
night-clothes. Escaping their bullets, he ran four miles 
to a neighbour's for protection. His wife left the 
house, with their treasure, five hundred dollars in 
gold. Of this they robbed her, when she sat down and 
saw her house burn while the cowards galloped off. 
Jones is a peaceable man, but has the sin of being Free 
State. They took a sick man from the house, beat him 
to death, as they supposed, and threw him into the 
creek; but he was found and saved. This party next 
appeared at Prairie City. 

' ' Here some ten or fifteen men routed them, when 
they joined the main force at Bull Creek. Learning 

1 Less than four hundred of these went to Osawatomie. See 
Spencer's journal, p. 50. 

96 



MR. BROWN'S COMMENTS 

all this, the Free-State forces, two hundred and fifty 
strong, left town at about nine or ten Saturday morn- 
ing, and, by forced march of thirty-five miles, the 
cavalry approached the enemy just at dark. Finding 
them in so large numbers, our cavalry fell back for the 
infantry to come up. The next day they gave the foe 
a chance to fight, but he had taken a hasty leave. Get- 
ting some provisions, the force returned and are now 
preparing for another branch of the ' chivalry.' If 
they stand fight there will be a good chance for them 
to be flogged. 

" Friday. Our forces surround Lecompton, having 
charged the invaders from near Clark's into the town. 
When all is ready to whip them the United States 
troops step in and another treaty is made, and Wood- 
son 1 gives up fourteen prisoners. . . . 

"At Osawatomie the ' Ruffians ' took a lad, Spencer 
Brown, and, it is said, have sent him down the river. 
Shall not write his mother about it by this mail. 
. . . I am to-day utterly stripped of everything but 
the clothes on my back. And not the first dollar ! But 
I do not despair. God and Free Kansas! My all is 
burned and stolen but my claim. ' ' 2 

To Mrs. Brown he wrote : 

1 Pro-Slavery Secretary of Kansas, appointed by President 
Pierce. 

* " Claim." The quarter section of lands he had taken, upon 
which his house had stood. 

97 



" MY DEAR WIFE: 

' ' Osawatomie is all in ashes. The boys are safe, but 
our house is burned and the safe broken and robbed. 
Three Free-State men were killed, and there were three 
wagon-loads of killed and wounded among the Pro- 
Slavery men. It was a desperate fight between thirty 
or forty Free-State men and three hundred Missouri- 
ans. The whole country is now one scene of fighting, 
plunder, robbery, and murder. Nearly one thousand 
Free-State men are in the field and giving the ' Border 
Ruffians ' fight where they can find them. ... A 
company of cavalry go down to Osawatomie in the 
morning, to bring up the families still there. . . . 
I have been sick, but am better. I have not a dollar in 
money. I shall stay here now. The United States 
troops will all be here to-morrow with the prisoners. 
No man can get out of the Territory now. It is fight 
or die, with many of us. . . . A nobler set of fel- 
lows never graced a cause, never were gathered in an 
army. You see boys of sixteen and men of eighty 
carrying guns, camping upon the prairie, and living 
upon melons and green corn, making forced marches 
by day and night. One hundred and fifty have left 
this evening to make a forced march to save Topeka. 
They will, probably, have a fight on the way, as the 
Lecompton Pro-Slavery forces, five hundred strong, 
are camped near the road. But they fear nothing 
their cause is just, their wrongs unnumbered. But 

98 



MR. BROWN'S COMMENTS 

enough! I am glad you are away from these scenes 
of strife and blood. I hope to see the boys in a day or 
two. . . . Love to all. When Hoyt left his 
friends, just before he was murdered, he remarked (it 
was in the prospect of a shower) , ' The thunder meets 
my ear.' A sad farewell. 

"YOUR HUSBAND." 

A week later he wrote to his wife, " Yesterday a 
grand battle was to have been fought. Some six hun- 
dred ' Border Ruffians ' were encamped four miles out 
of Lecompton. Our army, with General Lane at its 
head, marched for them at 8 A.M. They fled, as usual, 
going to Lecompton, around which place were four 
hundred United States troops. Our army surrounded 
the town, cannon were all planted could have 
knocked them all to ' kingdom come 'when Wood- 
son * sends up a white flag, gets the troops to interfere. 
So another ' treaty ' is made. Colonel Cook agrees to 
disperse the whole invading army, force open the road 
to Leavenworth, and give up all our prisoners. 2 We 
give nothing. Dayton, Gardner, Doctor Avery, 
. . . and lots of others, are there, taken at Leaven- 
worth. At Leavenworth they are driving the Free- 
State settlers all out, pressing some of the men into 
their service, and the women are fleeing to the woods,

to the fort, and down the river in boats. Several men 
have been shot this week. One came in at five this 
morning who was shot twenty miles from here. They 
supposed him dead ; but he crawled away, and in two 
nights and two and a half days he found his way here, 
through the woods. Jlis face was black with powder 
and his jaw was broken. 

' ' The power of the enemy in the Territory is broken 
for the present. And yet nothing secures us perma- 
nent peace but to break the power of the Missourians. 
If the States do not do that, we might as well leave. 

' * West Port is expecting an attack, and will, prob- 
ably, be demolished before the thing is settled. 1 . . . 
Several hundred more of our friends from the North 
are expected here in a day or two. "... 

It was inexpedient to build again while the country 
was in the disturbed state described in these letters. 
As soon as it was possible to get away, Mr. Brown 
visited the ruins of his home at Osawatomie, found his 
son Rockwell and took him to Lawrence, and then set 
out to join his family in the State of New York. 
Leavenworth was the only point at which it was safe 
to embark for the East. " The boat bore a sad com- 
pany." Many " were leaving their earthly all be- 
hind," and " some had lost near relatives who had

fallen in defence of the cause of freedom." It was 
the " Silent Passage," the refugees remaining in their 
rooms most of the time. " We were in the enemy's 
country," wrote Mr. Brown, " and dared not speak 
the name of Kansas." 



101 






CHAPTER XIII 

FREEDOM'S RISING TIDE 

" THE election for President," writes Mr. Brown, 
" was coming on, and Kansas affairs agitated the 
country. Buchanan was elected, so the winter was 
spent in getting recruits to renew the contest." Of 
his own efforts to enlist the sympathies of Eastern men, 
and to induce stalwart mechanics and workmen of all 
descriptions to go to Kansas, he gives an interesting 
account. In the winter of 1856- '57 he delivered lec- 
tures in Jefferson, Oswego, Oneida, Herkimer, Otsego, 
and Delaware Counties, in the State of New York. 
Those who were acquainted with him can imagine the 
effect of his vivid descriptions, and graphic narratives 
of events reported in the preceding chapter. In the 
city of Utica he addressed a large audience in Mechan- 
ics ' Hall, Mr. Henry J. Raymond and other men prom- 
inent in public life being on the platform. He spoke, 
also, in Rome, Clyde, and Syracuse. Going to New 
York city, he made the Astor House his headquarters, 
and advertised in the Tribune, inviting all persons who 
were interested in Kansas, or willing to emigrate to 
that Territory, to call upon him and obtain useful in- 

102 



FREEDOM'S RISING TIDE 

formation. He was startled and confounded by the 
effect of the advertisement. A heterogeneous multi- 
tude invaded the Astor House and pressed upstairs to 
Mr. Brown's room. Men of all nationalities, of all 
occupations and without occupation, professional men, 
tradesmen, hair-brained adventurers, gentlemen and 
beggars, men clean and dirty men, strong men and in- 
valids, came in a surging tide. Mr. Brown found it 
necessary to fly from his room, lock the door, and ask 
the clerk of the hotel to adopt some expedient to give 
him respite. 

In the spring of 1857 hundreds of persons met him 
at Buffalo to arrange for removal to the West. Among 
' ' the first out-going boats on the Missouri River, ' ' he 
writes, " about March 1st, I counted seven heavily 
loaded with emigrants for Kansas. It was a great har- 
vest for the owners of the boats, and they could afford 
to be very civil, and were so. As these emigrants en- 
tered the Territory and were rushing into the different 
places of destination it seemed that the question was 
settled. The ' Border Ruffians ' were amazed, alarmed, 
and for the first time civil. But every calm precedes 
the storm. 

" Many a hard battle was yet to be fought. Every 
election raised questions that involved the people in 
disputes, and resulted in violence and bloodshed. 
. . . We were indicted, arrested, charged with 
treason, fined and imprisoned. These intimidations 

103 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

not being enough to drive us out, robbery, burning, 
and assassination were resorted to, as in former years. 
Under Governor Medary an 'Amnesty Bill ' had to be 
hastily passed to save from a general uprising. This 
bill, I think, under God, was brought about by myself. 
. . . Governor Walker had tried his hand and 
failed. He made speeches promising us justice. I 
heard him at the Miami land sales. He seemed in 
earnest, and believed, I have no doubt, he could do as 
he said. He was answered by one of our Osawatomie 
men. The ' Border Ruffians ' took exception. A gen- 
eral fight seemed certain, but H. H. Williams, one of 
our villagers, stood boldly up and said, ' Go on, 
Charlie. Free speech here ! > He did go on, reciting 
facts that no doubt surprised the Governor, who made 
no more public speeches. 

" Soon after this, he rejected sixteen hundred votes 
cast by the Missourians at Little Santa Fe. He was 
recalled by President Buchanan. 1 An attempt to en- 
force the ' Bogus Laws,' " after the Free-State men 
had an overwhelming majority in the Territory, ' ' was 
made by a dare-devil Marshal named Fane, recently 
appointed from Arkansas. The court of trial was sit- 
ting at Lawrence also the Legislature, a few members 

1 The Administrations of Presidents Pierce and Buchanan were 
shamefully subservient to the demands of the slave-holders. A 
number of just and brave governors of their own appointment 
these weak Presidents recalled from Kansas to please the South, or 
appease its wrath. 

104 



FREEDOM'S RISING TIDE 

of which were Free-State men. He commenced arrest- 
ing men at Fort Scott, and moved thence northward, 
having one hundred United States dragoons to back 
him. In terror and wrath the fighting element rushed 
to Osawatomie, determined to make a stand and fight 
the troops. They came to me and asked me to go to 
Lawrence, see the Governor, and say to him they would 
surrender to him, but would not be taken alive by the 
Marshal. At my request they came to Lawrence and 
saw the Governor. 

" The next day the Marshal came into town with 
wagon-loads of settlers in irons. The populace at- 
tacked him and the United States troops, hooting, ston- 
ing, and clubbing them, pulling the soldiers from their 
horses, and seizing their guns. The Marshal, unhorsed, 
fled into a drug store in the Eldridge House, and was 
secreted by some of the citizens, and thus his life was 
saved. There was a crowd of over one thousand in- 
furiated men in front of the hotel. Jim Lane, mounted 
on a box, addressed the mob as only a true patriot, who 
yet was a demagogue of the first water, could. He 
was a natural ' stump orator,' and could move and 
sway the masses at will. He lashed the Government, 
the officials in power, and the Pro-Slavery party in 
general. After more than an hour of such harangue 
he quieted the crowd to a better state of feeling, saying 
we were there to do away wrong by doing right. 

' ' This prepared the way for Governor Medary, who 
105 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

now appeared upon the balcony of the second story 
to address the people. As on a similar occasion when 
Governor Shannon was there, pistols and guns were 
raised ; but seeing me by the Governor 's side the men 
dropped their guns, and listened to his speech re- 
spectfully. He gave assurances that all in his power 
would be done to give the people justice. The next 
day the 'Amnesty Bill ' was promptly passed by the 
Legislature, and the Governor as promptly signed it. 
The shackles fell, the prison doors opened, and a gen- 
eral jubilee followed. Fane was fain to be seen no 
more. I doubt whether he stopped long enough in 
Kansas to draw pay for his infamous work. ' ' In the 
Territory, the tide turned in 1857. From that time the 
Free-State men were in the ascendency. 

Early in the spring of that year, Mr. Brown 's fam- 
ily all returned to Osawatomie. Greater numbers of 
immigrants than ever before poured into Kansas. The 
people of the North were thoroughly aroused, and de- 
termined to " hold the fort " for freedom. The towns 
that had been sacked and burned were rebuilt with 
better and more enduring structures. But a new, sud- 
den, and crushing calamity came upon Mr. Brown's 
home. He tells us about this in a few graphic sentences. 
" Seeing a fearful storm approaching, I sent Spencer 
to secure a ferryboat on the Osage. As he made his 
way back the tornado, now raging, came crashing 
through the timber, trees falling, meanwhile, before 

106 



FREEDOM'S RISING TIDE 

and behind him and across his way, he leaping one in 
presence of another that was falling in front of him. 
The limbs of trees were flying in the air as he ran the 
gauntlet of death. He reached the house in safety. 
The trees in a heavy forest through which he had 
passed had all been levelled to the ground in a belt some 
fifteen rods wide. The roof of the family house was 
carried away and torrents of rain poured in. ' ' 

Spencer's personal danger, of which his father 
speaks, the boy, in his journal, does not even mention. 
" In June," he says, " a big storm, a perfect hurri- 
cane, swept the town, blowing over Father's house, 
nearly completed on the hill, and demolishing Greer's 
hotel and store, as well as several other buildings."

CHAPTER XIV 

LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

SPENCER'S interest in the friends he had made in 
Missouri did not soon wane. He inserted in his cipher 
journal letters received from them in the latter part of 
1857. Many that had come in the earlier part of the 
year he burned, before it had occurred to him to sub- 
mit them to the process which would at the same time 
preserve and conceal them. The first letter that ap- 
pears in the journal is one from Mary T : 

" FAIB VIEW, October 9, 1857. 

" DEAR SPENCER: I was much pleased to receive 
your letter this evening. My long silence was caused 
by sickness in the family. 

' ' Mollie K comes up three times a week to take 

music lessons, and is getting along very well. Belle 
also takes lessons weekly. A few weeks ago I spent 
some time in Lexington visting friends and attending 
our annual Fair. It brought to my mind a little friend 
that I found there the year before. I said a friend, for 
I feel that he will long continue to be a fast friend- 
will he not ? 

108 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

" Belle and her father are the only ones that at- 
tended from Hazel Glen this year. 

' ' Belle and Mrs. K have both been over, and 

expressed a desire to see you. They send love. " 

Mrs. K , the wife of the physician and lawyer at 

whose house Spencer spent such happy days while sup- 
posed to be in captivity, wrote to him, in December, 
1857, expressing great pleasure at receiving a letter 
from him, and giving him cordial invitation to Hazel 
Glen, mentioning the winter parties which he might 
attend with her own children, and declaring that no- 
body would be more glad to see him than she herself 
would be. Perhaps the lines that interested Spencer 
most were these : ' ' Mollie laughed when she read your 
letter and said she knew the children would tease her 
about it. ' ' 

Miss Mary T , daughter of the principal of a 

school, herself sometimes a teacher, seems to have been 
a young lady of the type exemplified (without ex- 
aggeration, let it be said) in tens of thousands of in- 
stances in the common schools of the United States. 
Such teachers exert a religious influence over their 
pupils, and in all their social life, not in order to fulfil 
conditions imposed by school boards or clerical patrons, 
but because their hearts are full of faith in God's Word 
and of love for Christ and the souls he came to save. 
Of the heart's abundance the lips and the life must 
speak. Living waters must flow from the clear, gush- 

109 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

ing spring. Of the schools under the instruction and 
influence of such teachers denominational bigots are 
accustomed to speak in disparagement, sometimes even 
calling them ' ' Godless, ' ' because no church catechism 
is taught in them. All the creeds and catechisms in 
existence cannot faithfully and efficiently convey the 
Spirit of Christ to the children in our schools if the 
teacher is not under the control of that Spirit. There 
is nothing molluscous, indefinite, or flabby, in a re- 
ligion which accepts, as the divine and only Saviour, 
him who died for our offences, rose for our justifica- 
tion, and lives and reigns evermore, to reign and live 
in us, our holy and loving Lord. The teacher who su- 
premely values this Lord and his salvation is necessa- 
rily a better teacher of religion than any one can be 
who is merely a frigid channel for the communication 
of a frozen formula, however orthodox and even Scrip- 
tural the creed may be. 

Spencer's letters to Miss Mary T had laid open 

to her a spirit of restless discontent. Answering, she 
counsels him to " Go to the foot of the Cross. "... 
" Only there," writes she, " can you be relieved of 
your burdens : there only can you have that peace of 
mind you so much desire. ' ' She cautions him, loving- 
ly, against grieving God's Spirit and hardening his 
heart. 

I have said that Spencer's journal was written in 
characters to which he alone had the key. What he 

110 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

recorded there was meant for no eye but his own. 
Keeping this in mind, we shall feel the simplicity and 
sacredness of the last entry made that year. 

"It is Sunday night the last day of 1857. 
. . . Yesterday afternoon I read Neighbour Jack- 
wood. It is a very interesting book. I have also read, 
within a little while, Love's Labour Won. Oh! that I 
had some one to love ! My heart pants and struggles 
for love. Oh! if I could love God, love Jesus, then 
would I be indeed happy ! God help me to love Him 
first! 

" February 9, 1858. I went to singing- school in 

the evening with K . I am learning to sing by 

note very well. I have a few favourites from the opera 
of the Bohemian Girl. 

" ' I dreamed that I dwelt in marble halls. ' 

' ' Ah ! my soul yearns for music. Kitty is now sing- 
ing me one of my favourites Alice, Ben Bolt. 

" Saturday the 17th. The things have come from 
Lawrence to-day. There is a flutina, flute, and fife 
(which I have taken a fancy to), and a flageolet, be- 
sides the engravings and some books. There is also a 
fine large set of chessmen. 

" February 25th was observed as Father's birth- 
day, and was honoured by a gathering of the old set- 
tlers. . . . The folks have gone to bed, and left 
me here, alone, to write. 

" These words of Moore come to my mind : 
111 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Oft in the stilly night ; 

Ere slumber's chains have bound me, 
Fond memory brings the light 

Of other days around me. 

" Saturday morning, about two o'clock, we were 
visited by a band of serenaders, eight in number, ac- 
companied by Holbrook, who sang two pieces. Father 

and K got up and asked them in, and gave them 

some cake and apples. They stayed about an hour. 
. . . They played and sang two pieces, one of which 
was Rosalie the Prairie Flower. They brought a guitar 
and two violins. . . . 

" Friday, March 15th. I have been very busy to- 
day, getting saw-logs out of the river. There is danger 
of losing them. 

" I have been thinking, to-day, ' Cannot I be a 
Christian ? ' How long I have wanted to be one ! 

" March 30th. I answered Mary T 's letter. 

I have another tune added to my favourites: ' Cast 
thy burden on the Lord. ' 

" I am trying to go to West Point have great 
hopes of going. My reasons, as I told them to Mary : 
(1st) To get straightened up. (2d) The course of 
study that I can get nowhere else without great ex- 
pense. (3d) To fit myself for the navy, which I design 
to enter, if I can." 

This is Spencer's first mention of a plan to secure 
a good education. Many later entries express strong 

112 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

desire to go to college. It is painful to see how one 
disappointment after another shut him out from the 
object of his ambition. 

Seeking an appointment to the Military Academy 
of the United States, he had mistaken the way and 
means to enter the navy. He should have tried to get 
to the Naval Academy at Annapolis. 

" I am learning to play very well on my fife. Sold 
my half share of town stock to Rock for eighty-five 
dollars and ten per cent interest until paid. Father 
sold the little bulls for eighty-five dollars. 

' ' My verse for to-night is, ' And be ye kind one to 
another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even 
as God, for Christ 's sake, hath forgiven you. ' ' 

To Mrs. K he wrote about this time : ' ' As to 

Mollie, give my respects to her. I shall never hear the 
last of the teasing on her account, and I believe I will 
lay it up against her. We are setting out an orchard, 
Father and myself having put out forty trees. Flow- 
ers have here ceased to be a rarity. I am afraid the 
Doctor is forgetting me. I can 't help it. He owes me 
the last letter. I have my room all alone, where my 
things can be in confusion without worrying any one. 
That is very handy, I assure you! " 

" April 21st. Rode horseback with Kittie this 
afternoon. . . . Father went to Missouri to-day. 
I sent my letter to Mrs. K yesterday. 

"April 22d. To-day Cook and myself went to the 
113 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

river and found the cow. I put up two new boxes for 
the martens. They have been here all day. Rode down- 
town this evening. 

"April 24th. Rocky caught his first cat-fish this 
evening. 

' ' Weight, six pounds. 

" Sunday, April 25th. I had a dream last night 
truly a dream. I dreamed that I loved and was 
loved again. . . . The contrast has made me 
gloomy this morning. Went after the cow this after- 
noon. Swam the river with my clothes on. Bad con- 
sequences. . . . To-night I am cheered with hope. 

" April 26th. Rather tired this morning. After 
the cow all day. Got her at last. Worked in the gar- 
den. Another to my list of favourite tunes Sweet 
Alice, Ben Bolt. 

" To-night I have obtained a picture of Mollie! 
It is an engraving of a bust of Spring, by Palmer, the 
Albany sculptor. I never knew how I thought of her 
before. That picture entranced me! I could gaze at 
it for hours together. God bless my dear Mollie ! Oh, 
Mollie ! My soul literally goes out after you. I long 
again to see you. How much more, then, do I long to 
have you tell me how you love me. Oh ! how much do 
I want your love to cheer me, and steady me in a 
good and noble purpose ! Hope is left. God keep you, 
Mollie! Good-night! " 

Evidently, Spencer was very impressible. His soul 
114 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

was open to all pleasure and all pain. In his child- 
hood, his older sister had been his dearest friend and 
confidant. We have seen that his mild captivity in 
Missouri had thrown him into the society of a girl 
whose face, spirit, and character enamoured him. She 
was the object of this susceptible boy's first warm af- 
fection. But he was separated from her. Love he 
must have. She was the moon of his little world, but 
there were also stars. When the moon was invisible, he 
did not deny himself the light of lesser luminaries. 
His youthful fancies were at once so natural and so in- 
nocent, that his straightforward account of little love 
passages, and his admiring mention of numerous mai- 
dens, enlist our sympathies. 

" May 14, 1858. Kitty and myself down-town at 

B 's. Had a fine time. Sarah played unusually 

well. Both of the girls appeared better than usual- 
Mary in particular. It is strange how much interest 
I take in that girl ! But I cannot help it. I fairly may 
say, ' God bless her ! ' Kitty played on the melodeon a 
great deal and very well. . . . Holbrook at home, 
on our arrival. Stayed some time. Why does not 
Mary write? " 

On May 19th occurred the " Marais des Cygnes 
Massacre," an event so prominent in the history of 
Kansas that I wonder to find no mention of it in Spen- 
cer 's journal. The boy 's wise caution may have warned 
him to leave it unrecorded, even in his cipher pages. 

115 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

His father writes: " Later the ' Marais des Cygnes 
Massacre, ' under the leadership of the notorious Ham- 
ilton, occurred, south of Osawatomie. A large com- 
pany of armed men went from house to house calling 
out the Free-State settlers to the number of twelve. 
These they marched out upon the prairie, where they 
were drawn up in line and shot down. Two not fatally 
wounded, though feigning death, were found after the 
ruffians had left. A Baptist clergyman by the 
name of Reid, one of the survivors, now lives in Osa- 
watomie. ' ' 

Spencer 's journal continues : 

" May 22d. Considerable excitement in town to- 
day on account of some of Montgomery 's men robbing 
L. D. Williams of two horses and some four hundred 
dollars in money. H. H. Williams, the Sheriff, went 
after them this morning with five men. Yesterday 
thirty Missourians killed five or six Free-State men. 
Rumours of parties of Pro-Slavery men around the 
country reached our ears. The town is preparing for 
fight, and setting a watch, or guard. We made some 
little preparations, concealing the guns, etc. 

" May 24th. Heard Mr. Adair preach this morn- 
ing." 

Here mutilation of a page of the journal has robbed 
us of the date of an entry. 

" I have finished Kane's Arctic Exploring Expedi- 
tion. It is very interesting. 

116 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

' ' June 9th. We have been singing, but it does not 
comfort me only saddens. Oh ! how I long for love ! 
A little word, but comprehending how much ! I have 
one all-absorbing want love. How much good one of 
Mary's kind letters would do me to-night! I have a 
great mind to write and tell her all. Still, I am afraid. 
If I could only see her ! I hear nothing from my dear 
Mollie. I wonder if she loves me as I love her. I 
cannot tell. I can only hope. 

" Father is going to Lawrence, to-morrow. 

" Monday, July 5th. The Fourth is celebrated to- 
day. In the evening, at seven o'clock, Mary B was 

married to Mr. T . I was happy to see the wed- 
ding. Kitty, myself, and Mary C were out riding. 

Enjoyed ourselves much. 

" July 14th. Received a letter from Mary T 

day before yesterday, which I copy." 

He does copy it. A sensible letter it is. His fair 
mentor expresses her satisfaction at the effect of a 
scolding she had given Spencer, and acknowledges a 
letter she had lately received from him. 

" I got your letter out of the office myself," she 
writes, ' ' and was amused when I saw the three large 
seals on it. I can assure you it had not been opened. 
The postmaster said there must be some great secret 
in it. I am glad to hear you are making yourself useful 
when you are not going to school. It is right for us 
to work. God has commanded it. ... I am very 
9 117 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

sorry you think you will not be able to visit us in the 
fall. ... As to West Point, I think there are 
many other places where you could get as good an edu- 
cation and where the influences around you would be 
far better. I hear that the young men that attend 
that school are generally very wild. I do think a life 
on the sea would be the very last. I never knew any 
who traversed the ocean but such as had the character 
of being worthless. Do not understand me to say that 
such a one could not be a Christian, for all things arc 
possible with God. I only have to say that I would 
regret very much to hear that you were following the 
seas. There are very good schools in our State, if you 
are not too strong Free-Soil to patronize them. I sup- 
pose the Eastern schools are much less expensive 
which is something that should be thought of." 

After giving, in full, the household news of 

her father's home and Doctor K 's, Miss T 

writes : 

' ' Mollie has been to see me twice lately. The more 
I see of her the better I like her. Have you given her 
up yet ? I think she will be set up as a young lady in 
about a year. She is larger than I am, now. We are 
going to have a picnic next Saturday (the third of 
July) about a mile from here. I anticipate a merry 
time. Now, do not neglect writing, as I have done. 
Remember the Golden Rule. 

' ' Write freely to me, for your letters are not seen 
118 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

by any one else. Remember me kindly to your family, 
and believe me to be, Your true friend, 

" MARY T . 

" P. S. Spencer, are you ashamed of Christ? You 
are surprised at the question, but why is it that you 
wish no one to know that you have a hope in Him? 
Tell me, do your parents know anything about your 
feelings? If you were not ashamed of Christ, you 
would not be ashamed to profess Him before the world.. 
My prayers daily ascend in your behalf, and I trust 
you will be found at last at God 's right hand. Would 
that I could see that you were doing something for His 
cause! You are young, and I would love to see that 
you were fitting yourself for a more useful life than 
one in the navy. . . . 

" Remember, He is a Friend more interested in 
your spiritual welfare than any other. 

11 MARY." 

After her signature, Spencer has written, in his 
cipher, ' ' Loved name ! ' ' The boy who liked to re- 
ceive such letters as the one I have just given could not 
wilfully go far astray. There is reason to believe, how- 
ever, that his own religious experience and principles, 
at that time, fell far short of being as satisfactory and 

fixed as were Mary T 's. The next words in his 

journal show how he sought comfort and impulse in 
human love. 

119 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" July 20, 1858. I have worked very hard to-day. 
. . . I had such a nice dream last night. I dreamed 
that I was loved. It fairly made me work harder all 
day ! Still, I wake to a sad reality. 

' ' July 30th. Mother went to New York this morn- 
ing. Mary and W C came down and visited 

us this afternoon. Was well pleased. W went 

home in the evening, but Mary stayed over night. 

C came in the evening, but was very silent. Made 

a little hay to-day. I worked hard. Rode horseback 
with Kitty a little while this evening. My verse to- 
night is, ' Look Thou upon me, and be merciful unto 
me, as Thou usedst to do unto those that love Thy 
name.' ( Ps. cxix. 132.) 

" August 1st. Have done much work to-day, and 
have been singing this evening. But it was only a sort 
of show. Oh ! how I long for love and confidence ! I 
fear I am growing cross and crabbed. And yet I can- 
not help it. To-night Kitty said, for the third time, 
she would tell me something, only she feared I would 
tell. I think I do not deserve this. Now, I long for 
Kitty's sympathy and love. Still, I have done all that 
I could to invite it, and would willingly repay it. I 
do hope she will not think so of me long ! I do not for- 
get Mollie. How can I ? She is my main hope. God 
bless her! " 

Under the date of August 16th he writes concern- 
ing one of his sisters and himself : ' ' Nor do I think 

120 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

either of them would make a suitable husband for her. 
She should have one who lives by music, as she does ; 
otherwise I fear she will not be happy. 'Tis the same 
with me. Music masters me, or makes me uncontrolla- 
ble. If I ever marry, may I marry a girl who can sing 
and play ! If I am tired, music rests me ; if I am angry, 
it tames me in a minute. The Marseillaise Hymn makes 
me uncontrollable at times. The sweeter the music, 
the sadder I am. But enough of this, though never 
enough of music. Mollie the question is, Can I be 
happy with her ? I think, yes ; but not so happy as if 
she had a soul for music. I think I will go and 
see. But if I go, I cannot resist her silent power 
over me. 

" To-morrow will be my birthday, and I shall be 
sixteen years old. I am glad of this glad to be grow- 
ing older, and for this reason: as I grow older I 
progress toward that time when I shall be my own 
master, free to go, free to come, and free to love. And 
love puts me in mind of Mollie. Do I love her ? The 
point is this Can I love, to the full extent of my 
nature, one who has no such love for music as I have ? 
This is my hesitation about going to Missouri. If I 
go I shall get yet more deeply in love with Mollie. 

' ' No answer yet to either of my letters to Missouri. 
I am anxious to hear from both of them from Mary 

T especially. At times I am sorry I wrote that 

letter." 

121 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

He speaks on the next page of a " band " he had 
organized. What it was, I can only guess. His fond- 
ness for music led me at first to think he had got to- 
gether a number of boys to practise on musical instru- 
ments; but he wanted strong and mettlesome boys. 
I infer that the company had some military char- 
acter. 

' ' August 25th. Things are progressing finely as far 
as my band is concerned. I added one member two or 
three days ago, and one to-night. There are ten now, 
and we shall soon have more. Our members are all good 
strong boys, and I think all are good pluck. I am yet 
conducting all the business think of sharing it with 
Potts, a new and good member. I shall soon have every 
good, right kind of boy, in town. 

" Rocky and I have been busy to-day making 
elderberry wine. We have some two gallons of clear 
juice, and shall have as much more." 

It could not have been long after this time that his 
father wrote of Spencer as " disapproving both of 
liquor-drinking and liquor-selling. At a public dis- 
cussion of the license question, he assumed the nega- 
tive, and advanced arguments against license that his 
father, on the side of license, could answer only by 
reasons of public policy. Spencer took the ground 
that legislators had no right to license an evil. ' '

sert it here. ' ' Of which, however, only a few extracts 
need be given. " I am very glad," writes his corre- 
spondent, ' ' to hear you speak of visiting your friends 
here, and hope you will not disappoint us. What time 
do you expect to come? Come prepared to make a 
good long visit. . . . By the way, when I am 
married your request shall be gratified ; but, Spencer, 
I am telling the truth when I say that I think I will 
never marry. As long as I have a happy home I shall 
be content. But should I ever change my mind it will 
be to marry one that I can have all confidence in as a 
Christian. I think I have given you quite a chapter 
of my sentiments on the subject of matrimony. 

" I am glad to hear that you enjoyed the Fourth 
so much. We celebrated the third with a picnic, and 
a pleasant little party it was. You would have en- 
joyed it much, for Mollie was there, looking as sweet 
as ever. She and I are great friends. I have seen her 
twice since the reception of your letter. She seems to 
feel very kindly towards you, and wished to be remem- 
bered to you. She is loved by all who know her. ' ' 

The next pages of the diary contain a copy of a 
later letter from the same good and loved friend. 

" MY DEAR SPENCER: I this morning received 
your letter, which gave me a sad pleasure sad, be- 
cause of your many troubles. I was pleased because of 
your confidence in me, and, above all, your confidence

in a higher Power. I truly sympathize with you, and 
can only say that God doeth all things well, and often 
afflicts us to draw us closer to Him. When you feel 
your angry passion rising, offer up a silent prayer to 
God that He may keep you continually. There is much 
I could say, but I think it best to wait until I shall see 
you, as I hope to, soon. Your situation is a peculiar 
one. I know not how to advise, but would encourage 
you to ask directions from your Heavenly Father. He 
loveth His children, and as they come in faith to Him 
He will hear and answer. You are often remembered 
in my prayers, and I hope that you sometimes remem- 
ber me." 

Spencer comments upon these letters. " I like to 
hear and read such letters as those. They show me how 
good and unselfish some persons can be without know- 
ing it. Who would have thought that I should find in 
Missouri a friend who, in God's providence, would be 
the happy instrument of bringing my soul, as I humbly 
hope, to Him ? God be with her, and bless her for this, 
and save me to praise with her a good God to all 
eternity." 

' ' September 5th. I went to a lecture by a woman, 
last night. Bather funny, but didn't amount to 
much. ' ' 

His reply to Miss Mary T 's letter is dated :

LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

"ONE THOUSAND MILES FROM ANT PLACE, 
September 2, 1858. 

' ' DEAR MARY : I received your letter last Monday, 
and it was indeed most welcome. If you only knew 
how welcome your letters were, and. how much good 
they did me, you would write oftener. 

" Yours came on the anniversary of the battle of 
Osawatomie, and of my departure for Missouri as a 
poor and almost desolate prisoner. 'Twas thus I found 
what I wanted and needed so much a friend, and per- 
haps something else, too. However, we will let all this 
drop, and I will go to telling you the news. 

" Since my last letter Father went to New York, 
on business, and Mother, hearing of her Mother's being 
ill, went soon after. Now they are both gone, and Kitty 
does the housekeeping, and I have the care of the farm. 
I shall come and see you all, probably, as soon as 
Father comes back. 

" I don't know what to make of your chapter on 
matrimony, but one thing I dislike, exceedingly, and 

that is . You ought to see the way I stamped when 

I read that part of your letter. If you were married 
to him, I would feel like going seventy-five miles 
farther off instead of so much nearer. But I am apt to 
say too much on disagreeable subjects, and we will 
drop this." 

On September 21st he writes : ' ' Father and Mother

came to-night. Of course there is a great deal of 
bustle and hurry. They have brought us all some- 
thing to me a pair of gold sleeve-buttons and a piece 
of the Atlantic telegraph cable. It would be needless 
for me to say, I am thankful. 

' ' In looking over some old magazines to-day I saw 
something bearing on my favourite idea metempsy- 
chosis. . . . Last night I had a beautiful dream. 
I dreamed that I was about to be married yes, and 
was on the way to the altar. I remember that I was 
walking with my intended, and I thought that I was 
still a boy and she a little girl. Yet I remember how, 
ever and anon, I caressed her and kissed her, Ah! 
would that it were verily so, even now! Oh! how I 
long for some one on whom to bestow my love ! I feel 
a mine of it in me. ... 

" I heard some sweet singing lately which I must 
not forget to mention. It was by my new friends, Mrs. 

L and her daughter Lizzie. ... I am a great 

friend of Mrs. L , or, rather, I think a great deal 

of her. Lizzie goes to the same school with me, . . . 
and I like to look at her, but she is only a little child 
yet. She is so neat, and gentle, and mild. ... I 
do not think I like her nearly as well as I do my Mollie. 
But I should not write so. I do not know whether I 
shall ever see her again. Still, I will think of her with 
silent, lasting love. . . . All I can say is, ' God 
bless her! ' At times when I was with her I could 

126 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

scarce refrain from casting my arms about her and 
telling her how much I loved her. 

' ' October llth. ... I still go to school nearly 
every day. . . . Steadily progressing in geom- 
etry. Father begins to talk about my teaching school, 
or some other such nonsense, to get a living, or, in 
other words, to be earning something. I do not know 
whether I would like teaching school or not. When I 
think of the troubles one so young as myself would 
have to meet, I do think it would be unwise ; but when 
I think of the advantages I should gain, I still think it 
possible. 

" Still no letter from Missouri, from Mary, Mrs. 

K , or Mollie. Now that I am writing about this 

I will say I do not know what to think of myself. When 
I am with that girl I forget everything. I forget my- 
self, I follow her around like a baby. I am then a per- 
fect fool. When I am away, such complete fascination 
is gone. Even now, I go to school every day. What 

for? To look at Lizzie L . Sometimes she smiles, 

sometimes she frowns, sometimes she tries to stare me 
out of countenance. Whence comes this power of hers ? 
All I can think of is that she can sing. Yet why am 

I such a fool when with Mollie K , who does not 

sing? Who knows? 

" Now for something else. I play a piece on the 
accordion, a schottische, which I am almost sure I 
never heard before. Yet it seems perfectly familiar to 

127 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Kitty and myself. When I think of it, it seems to be 
connected with grand chandeliers of gaslight, with 
myriads whirling to the beautiful schottische. Yet I 
know I never heard that tune in any such place. 
Metempsychosis ? 

" October 12th. I have an idea in my head to- 
night. I will write the life of him whose soul I now 
have ; or the life of the man whose soul went into me 
when I was born, and who, consequently, died then. 
This is my theory. I will believe in the pre-existence of 
the soul. 

" Now, to commence with, I will find some person 
who died on my birthday, August 17, 1842, and then I 
will set myself to finding out that person's life; but 
chiefly find some one whose life corresponds with my 
own, who has uttered those words, beheld those scenes, 
and done those actions the doing, speaking, and acting 
of which come over me like a flash of light, so that I 
seem to have done, spoken, or seen those same things. I 
will always carry a book and pencil, and write such 
things whenever they come on me. In the first place, 
the piece of music I mentioned yesterday I set 
this down as fact first, that I have heard that music 
in such a place or way that it instantly brings 
to my mind visions of numbers of persons, in a 
large room brilliantly lighted with chandeliers, all 
dancing in the whirls of the schottische. Then, 
hearing words spoken as I know I never heard them, 

128 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL . 

either as to the words themselves or the manner and 
set circumstances in which they are spoken. I say, 
then, if I hear such words, which I know I have never 
heard spoken in such a way, yet find them familiar to 
me, then will I put that down as material to work on. 
Next, as I see a place, or a picture, or anything which 
I know I have never seen before, and which, yet, is 
familiar to me, I will set it down. Or as I am placed in 
any situation or circumstances which cause the flash 
which always comes (seeming like a sudden increase 
of knowledge), I will set it down. The first 
instance that I can remember now was when I 
first saw Adele, at Kansas City, dressed in sailor-boy's 
clothes. . . . 

" October 16th. I was at Mrs. L 's day before 

yesterday evening, and we sang about an hour and a 
half. Their singing always pleased me much. We 
have arranged to sing regularly, once a week this 
week, on Tuesday. 

" October 17th. Yesterday was the anniversary of 
the day that Father first came to Osawatomie, with 
others, who celebrate it regularly. 

' ' Sunday, November 28th. Yesterday I received a 
letter from Mary T , dated November 23d." 

Part of the letter I copy from Spencer's journal. 

" Last week we had protracted meetings. . . . 
Nine persons connected themselves with the church, 
among whom was our dear Mollie. Oh ! how happy I 

129 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

was to see her come forward and proclaim herself to be 
on the Lord's side! ... I have promised to go 
to the Doctor's this evening, and shall have to put this 
up till I come back. You say your sister Kitty wishes 
to know what I look like. I am afraid to describe my- 
self ; she might be disappointed if she ever saw me. 
But she need not be afraid of my being sister to her, as 
I am in my twenty-third year though I have several 
brothers, and will give her a choice! She can have 
Gussie, if he doesn 't cut you out of Mollie. Give her 
my love, and tell her I would very much like to see her. 
. . . I have been at the Doctor's and enjoyed my- 
self while there, as I always do. He has a teacher in 

his family whom I like very much Miss G S , 

from Cape Girardeau. . . . Mrs. K has an- 
other little daughter." 

Answering this letter, Spencer writes : "And Mol- 
lie is now a Christian. Aside from the interest which 
I feel in her personally, I can rejoice at the conversion 
of one sinner much more at hers. I cannot say all I 
think about this, Mary; but do not imagine, on that 
account, that I think the less. ... I am hoping 
that God will not reject me from among His children 
hoping, and trusting in Jesus. God bless you for your 
instrumentality in this, Mary ; and may you never lack 
that grace which you so much desire others to have. 

" There are incomprehensible things in the last 
part of your letter which I would like you to explain. 

130 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

You say, ' She need not be afraid of my ever being sis- 
ter to her. ' The other thing is that which you are all 
the time writing about Gussie cutting me out which 
I do not understand. Do you want to plague me, or 
what ? Perhaps it is really so. If so, tell me, without 

jesting. About Mrs. K 's little daughter I want 

you to tell her for me that I should like to name it, and 
that I would like to have it called Elizabeth. 1 I know 
I ask a great favour, but perhaps she won't object to 
the name." 

To those who remember the destruction of the 
former instrument, one item of Spencer's letter will 
be not without interest. ' ' I forgot to inform you, our 
piano is come. ' ' 

On December 23d Spencer received a letter from 
Mrs. K . It gives evidence of the kind and friend- 
ly regard for him which that lady and her husband 
seem constantly to have cherished. " The Doctor," 
writes she, " is in bad health. He speaks often of 
you, and of writing to you. I want you to write to 
him, for he is quite dejected in spirits. You recollect 
A K . 2 He was returning home from Lexing- 
ton. Night overtook him, it was snowing, and quite 
stormy, and he lost his way, and lay out all night. 
When he was found next day he was cold and stiff. 
. . . A little life remained in him for two days,

but he was never conscious of anything. He has left 
us to mourn his loss. Oh ! you don 't know what a shock 
it was and how sad we all feel. It looks as if the Doctor 
would never recover from the shock. ... I hope 
you will come and see us soon. I would be so happy 
to see you again. . . . Perry will be home to spend 
Christmas. He is going to school to Rev. Mr. Clarke, 
of Saline County. The Doctor has employed a lady 
to come and teach the children. She has been here 
eight weeks. She gives lessons on the piano, also. 
Mary and Bettie are taking lessons. . . . We have 
a Bible class established in our church. Mr. Coulter 
still preaches for us. 

' ' There has been a small revival among the blacks. 
Ten have joined our church lately. The Doctor in- 
structs them, every other Sabbath, at home. 

' ' I hope you will write often and not wait for me. 
If I fail to write, you may know there is something the 
matter. In me you will always find a true friend. 
Mollie is quite large. She weighs one hundred and 
eight pounds. The Doctor 's only sister is staying with 
us for a short time. . . . Come and spend Christ- 
mas with us. Also, your sister might come, and see 
how she likes our country and people. . . . There 
is snow on the ground now, and it is good sleighing. 
You must write to me often, and write long letters. 
All join in love to you. Your affectionate friend, 

11 LIZZIE K ." 

132 



LETTERS AND JOURNAL 

Before the end of the year Spencer had received 

from Miss Mary T tidings that made his heart 

sink. There were reasons to believe that, while Mollie 
had very kind and friendly regard for him, she did 
not understand or reciprocate the ardency of his affec- 
tion. She was about to enter society as a young lady : 

she remembered him as but a boy. Mary T dared 

not encourage him to an assurance that circumstances 
did not justify.

CHAPTER XV 

JOURNAL FOR 1859 

" TO-DAY is January 1st. . . . Christmas 
passed with very little notice. Hard times press hard 
on Father. 

" There was a large ball at Mr. C 's last night. 

I stayed until five this morning, and consequently came 
home not very wide-awake, or lively. 

' ' Miss R was there. She was, in my opinion, 

the best-looking person in the room, and, I suppose, 
was the belle of the ball, with one exception. 1 I had 
never before met a person whose looks I admired so 
much. All that long night it was my best pleasure to 
look at her. 

" I do not know what I think about Lizzie. She 
is not in my thoughts as much as she was. When I love 
a person it cannot last long with me if not returned. 
When I found that she liked Will better than myself 
it caused me many troubles, for some days, to be re- 
conciled. Still, I always take pleasure in being near 
her, and in receiving a kind word from her. I am

134 



sometimes sorry that I ever thought so much of her. 
Yet, perhaps it was better so. 

' ' I came very near going to Missouri a day or two 
before Christmas. Nothing but high water prevented 
me. I was much disappointed. I would be much 
pleased to see my two Mollies. ' ' 

On the next page of the journal he inserts a copy 

of his answer to Mrs. K 's letter, which was given 

in his journal for December 23d. It speaks volumes 
as to his confidence in that kind lady's friendship for 
him, and her youthfulness of heart. He had suffered 
pangs of jealousy- on Gussie's account. Should he 
suffer alone? Not he! The boyish audacity of the 
letter almost takes one's breath away! 

" DEAR FRIEND: I received your welcome letter 
some time since, and, in answer to your kind request, 
came very near visiting you. Nothing but the Osage 
being so high as to prevent crossing kept me from 
coming. 

11 You said nothing about when Belle was to be 
married, and to whom. . . . You may tell Mollie 
that I wish she could find something to write, once, or 
twice, or more frequently, in the course of the year; 
and, if she cannot find anything else to write, to tell 
me about Gussie. I think I should be very especially 
pleased to hear more about him, and I guess she can 
tell as well as anybody. 

135 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

' ' There is a girl here with whom I am hard struck, 
and who certainly does beat all the girls I ever did see. 
She isn't so much of a beauty (although she has hazel 
eyes and brown hair), but then she's such a bouncing 
fat girl just my ideal of beauty. But tell Mollie that, 
as I never kissed her (I should like to try the ex- 
periment), I cannot tell how good it would be; 
but when I kissed this girl (none of your hastily 
snatched picnic kisses!) it was almost the nicest 
feeling I ever did have! She used to think a 
great deal of me, but thought, lately, that she 
would plague me; so she pretended to think so 
much of some one else, and to hate me so much, and 
even went so far as to call me ' Mr.,' which, I assure 
you, is a very disagreeable title, especially when one 
has such a nice name of his own. However, she doesn 't 
succeed in plaguing me much. In fact, I get along 
better at that game than she does. Oh ! she is such a 
nice ' gal ! ' And such a splendid singer ! But I must 
stop. I am always carried away with this subject. 
But, as I was saying before, I wish Mollie would write 
soon. 

" I am going to school now, and studying as 
hard as I can. ... I inclose this letter to 
Mollie. Give my love to all, in general, and to Mollie, 
in particular, and remember me as, 

' ' Ever your friend, 

11 SPENCER K. BROWN."

JOURNAL FOR 1859 

On January 20th, his journal records, " Father, 
Kitty, and myself started for Lawrence. Passed 
through Stanton and Peoria, and when we got to Wolf 
Creek it was too high to be forded. Stopped on the 
banks about an hour. This gave us an opportunity to 
get something to eat, which we needed, as we were very 
hungry. Forded the creek and came on to Ottawa 
Creek, where the water was so high we could not cross. 
We all went over on a log. The stage-driver stopped 
on this side over night. Peterson, who had started on 
foot the day before, overtook us here. We stopped 
at Heck's over night, getting a very good sup- 
per and breakfast. The stage came over, on the 
bridge, early, and we started again for Lawrence. 
Passed through Prairie City, over the Wakarusa 
bridge, and through about two miles of an awful 
slough called the ' Wakarusa Bottom.' Stopped 
at Mr. Reynolds 's place, when he took the reins 
and drove us on, slowly enough, towards Law- 
rence. Arrived, almost frozen, about two o 'clock, and 
stopped at the Eldridge House, a splendid hotel that 
would do credit to any place. I could not give a com- 
plete description of all that passed there, even if I 
should try ; but that visit will probably have an effect 
on me for life. The preparatory course of the uni- 
versity commences either in May or April, and 
Mr. Reynolds, the rector of the Episcopal church 
there, gave me a scholarship for the entire course, 

137 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

and I shall commence that which I have wanted so 
long. 

' ' There were many pleasant things connected with 
my visit to Lawrence which I shall always remember. 
Many friends made, many pleasant games of chess, 
and what I needed most of all an intercourse with 
the world. I must not forget Colonel E 1 's daugh- 
ters, J and A ; nor must I forget my friend 

Hattersheidt (I believe I have spelt his name correctly) 
a good-hearted German a traveller. However, that is 
all over now. ' Home again.' ' 

To a letter in which Miss Mary T had ex- 
plained that " Gussy " did really think a good deal 

of Mollie K , who, however, did not seem " to care 

particularly for any one, ' ' Spencer replied : 

" DEAR MARY: Some days ago I received your let- 
ter, which I think was only an apology for a letter, 
and ... a long time in coming. ... I will 
not say I was not glad to get it, for I am always glad 
to hear from you, and you explained some matters very 
much to my satisfaction. However, do not let this keep 
you from writing sooner, next time, and a much longer 
letter. I expect you will have to address your next 
letter to Lawrence, as I am going there to college, 
which opens on the 22d of April. The Episcopalian 
minister there presented me with a scholarship for the 
entire course, for which he has my thanks. I will send 

138 



JOURNAL FOR 1859 

you a circular, which you will be good enough to let 

Mr. K see ; and let him know, for me, that I should 

like very much to see Perry there to graduate with 
me that he can commence with me the studies of the 
second year of the preparatory department. You can- 
not tell how pleased I am with the prospect before me 
something that I had long hoped for but not ex- 
pected. 

' ' But, to return to your letter, . . . since you 
tell me that Mollie does not care particularly for any 
one, I am without any loadstone in the shape of a 
little girl. Still, I do not love her the less for not loving 
me. Do you think she has outgrown me? Try my 
height (five feet five inches) on the wall, and see if 
I am not three inches taller than I was when I was last 
there." 

Spencer had now come to a very trying period of 
his life. Young as he was, he had begun to feel that 
mind and heart were unsatisfied. He had literary 
tastes which he could not gratify. He had read enough 
to feel keenly his ignorance of many things that he 
wanted to know. He had caught a glimpse of an Eden 
in which the fruit of the tree of knowledge was good, 
accessible, and unforbidden. He might pluck and eat, 
if not to his soul 's satisfaction, yet to its content. As 
he was about to enter this paradise, the door closed and 
shut him out. 

The misfortunes which had overtaken his father 
139 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

had left him in circumstances which seemed to make it 
absolutely impossible to spare Spencer the means to 
go to college. The next extract from the journal refers 
to this overwhelming disappointment. 

" Father, who has been, for some time, trying to 
dishearten me, has decided that he cannot pay board, 
and I cannot go to college, as there cannot be found 
some place where I can earn my board outside of school 
hours. I have hardly any more hope of going. It 
seems as if I had to drag out a weary life of dead work 
until twenty-one, and then come out on the world, 
penniless and ignorant, to live for nothing but to 
drag through. I cannot write how I feel at this pros- 
pect." 

In May he made a new acquaintance. ' ' This morn- 
ing I was introduced to Mr. N. L. P , son of the 

sculptor P - 1 I was very much pleased with him. 

He is a short man, about five feet six, with a large and 
very round head and a full sandy beard, and always 
wears spectacles. I never saw a more pleasant man's 
face to look into. It sends a thrill of pleasure through 
me when he looks me in the eyes. I played chess with 
him to-day. About an even matter. He will write 
to me from Leavenworth. 

' ' Mr. Leonard and Mr. Ewing were here this even- 
ing; also Mr. "Ward, of New York. Horace Greeley, 
of New York, spoke yesterday. I was well pleased. 
1 Powers, famous as the creator of The Greek Slave. 

140 



JOURNAL FOR 1859 

' ' I have been shooting revolver with P to-day. 

He is much the best shot. ' ' 

Chess is mentioned, more than once, in Spencer's 
journal. In that game he excelled. While he was in 
Lawrence, with his father, he became ' ' the wonder of 
the public men assembled there, by his superiority in 
this recreation. He easily mastered legislators, law- 
yers, and judges, and seldom met any person who was 
his equal. ' ' 

On May 26, 1859, Spencer began to write his journal 
in characters different from those in which he kept it 
before. 

" On account of my having found a person who 
was able to read my cipher, I have adopted another, 
which I think is more difficult. I like the old feeling 
of security too well to write my thoughts in any other 
way. ' ' 

" June. I have been waiting to go to Missouri. 
. . . But Father has put it off from time to time, 
until, the other day, he proposed that I wait un- 
til September. I agreed to wait until the 30th of 
August, provided he would certainly let me go 
then." 

Urged by Spencer so to do, Miss Mary T at 

last wrote very clearly to him as to the nature of 

Mollie K 's regard for him. " I appreciate your 

friendship, your regard for me, very highly, and will 
now talk to you more freely, . . . about Mollie. 

141 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

In the first place I thought it was a child's love you 
had for each other, that would soon be forgotten by you 
both. But time showed me that on your side it was 
different, and I thought it not right to encourage you 
to hope when I did not think she loved you more that 
as a friend. . . . Mollie is young yet, and I think 
has not truly loved any one. Her Pa discourages any 
thought of the kind, and wants to send her to school 
several years yet." 

As the hope of winning Mollie 's love diminished, 
memories of the friend whose kindness won Spencer's 
affection at Charlottesville revived in strength. 

" July 26th. Last Sunday I wrote two letters to 
Mr. Britton * one to Newark, New Jersey, and the 
other to Louisville, Kentucky, simply asking him to 
write to me and give me his address. ' ' 

On July 26th he wrote to Miss Mary T : 

" Kitty is going to Kansas City. We shall miss 
her very much. I think I shall as much as any. The 
piano goes too. As I have been trying to learn, I shall 
miss that also. 

" Father has secured awards to the amount of 
$6,111 for property lost in 1856, and will, probably, 
be awarded some $8,000 more. Our troubles here 
in Kansas have left us comparatively poor. Father 
has refused to sell his farm. ... I regret losing

of a family found in the United States spell their name JBrittcvin.

the best part of my life out of school, but there is no 
help for this. 

' ' I feel more than ever alone since I received your 
letter, although I might have known that even did 
Mollie love me once she would have forgotten in so long 
a time. ... I know not how she may look or think 
now, but when I was there she was all to me." 

During this summer Spencer tried hard to find 
suitable employment in Kansas City, St. Louis, or 
Utica, but the applicants for such work as he could 
do were too numerous in each of these places to allow 
him any chance. On September 19th he records the 
failure of his endeavours, and closes with this sentence : 
" No news yet from Mr. Britton." 

On October 5th he writes : ' ' Grandpapa and Kitty 

came this evening. K going back, Tuesday. 

Grandpapa will stay some time longer, I expect. He 
has set my mind at ease on some things that I did not 
understand before. " Rock and I are working-up 
sugar-cane on shares, but it is not paying very well. 

11 October 10th. Grandpapa is still with us and 
last night he proceeded to give us a great many desira- 
ble remarks. 

' ' I feel very lonely. The old feeling comes on me 
after a hard day's work, as I have no one to turn to. 
If I could only see Mr. Britton again, it seems I could 
be happy. I cannot see my friends in Missouri, Father 
declaring it to be impossible to obtain the money.

" October 16th. I have read Bulwer's Eugene 
Aram. It is a fine novel especially the part of 
Aram. ' ' 

In November he renewed his correspondence with 

Miss Mary T , and the letters that passed between 

the two tell a sweet story of the boy's trust in the 
friendship and wisdom of that young lady. I do not 
know whether she is living on earth or has gone to 
heaven, or whether she ever heard of Spencer's later 
history and tragic death ; but I earnestly hope she sur- 
vives, to read these records, and learn from them that 
her loving interest in him is gratefully remembered by 
his friends.

CHAPTER XVI 

SPENCER REVISITS MISSOURI 

" TO-DAY is the 28th of February, [1860] and 
is Tuesday, ' ' wrote Spencer, ' ' and on Thursday I go 

to Missouri, to Doctor K 's folks. I have had a 

letter from Doctor K which I have answered. 

" March 15th. I got home, last night, from Mis- 
souri, and will try to write here a short account of my 
trip and its consequences. 

' ' I arrived at the Doctor 's about four in the after- 
noon, and found him very busy with a fire in his fence. 
After helping him about an hour, I went into the house 

and saw the rest. Mrs. K was still the same. In 

a few minutes Mollie came in from school seven miles 
away. I should not have known her. She was between 
three and four inches taller than when I left and pro- 
portionately larger. Her face is deeply marked with 
two dimples near the mouth ; the face round oval, eyes 
blue, cheeks red, hair dark brown almost black. 
Hands and feet medium size, if not large. She wore a 
sun-bonnet and a long riding-skirt. She held out her 
hand and said ' Spencer. ' I took her hand. There was 
no shake, hardly a clasp, and I said nothing." 

145 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Concerning this meeting with the young lady in 
whom, four years earlier, and ever since that time, 
Spencer had felt such deep interest, he wrote to his 
sister Kitty : ' ' Last of all came Mary. Grown ? 
. . . A very little taller than yourself! . . . 
She held out her hand. There wasn't much shaking 
done. Curious, wasn't it? Without many words she 
started for the upper regions, shoes creaking, and 
riding-skirt trailing. Heavy steps above then light 
ones. Change of shoes, probably. Silence. Active 
use of brush and comb is the inference. Reappear- 
ance. Different dress, smooth hair, lighter shoes, be- 
sides having shed the sun-bonnet, riding-skirt, -and 
shawl. Good-sized hoops not large. Hair combed 
smooth back over the ears, and large knot behind. 
Came and sat down near the fireplace, very straight. 
Says ' Yes, ma'am,' and ' No, sir,' to father and 
mother. ' ' 

Elsewhere Spencer tells us how common the use 
of the sun-bonnet was among the girls of Missouri, as 
they rode through the country to church or school. 
The pretty face was hidden, far back in the bonnet, 
as a train in a tunnel, if the wearer did but slightly 
turn her head from the observer. ' ' You could not see 
their faces," he shrewdly remarks, " unless they 
choose to let you." 

11 Next day," continues his journal, " we went 
over to see Belle " Mollie's sister, who had been 
married since Spencer had last seen her. 

146 



SPENCER REVISITS MISSOURI 

On Sunday, at church, he met his good correspond- 
ent, Miss Mary T . 

' ' Monday. The . boys and Mollie went back to 
school. The house seems very lonely. To-day Mrs. 

K and myself visited Mary T . I only saw 

her alone for a few minutes. She said I had better 
drop all thoughts of Mollie, if I could. She did not 
know that Mollie thought a great deal of any one in 

particular, but, if any one, a certain Johnnie P . 

At any rate Mollie and his sister were intimate friends. 
I simply said that as long as there was any room I 
would hope. Tuesday, Belle had a daughter born. 

Doctor and Mrs. K away all day. Wednesday 

Mary T stopped in at the Doctor's. Played, as 

she also did at her own house. I walked part way 
home with her, and bade her good-bye, as I expected to 
go home in the morning. I also told her that I was 
going to learn my fate in the evening, if possible. I 
went home. Mollie rode up, shortly after. In the 
evening, after she had played some time, I asked her 
if she remembered that first letter I sent her. She 
said ' Yes. ' I apologized for the awkward manner in 
which she had received it. 1 Said that I had no inten- 
tion of concealing the matter from her parents ; that I 
had told her mother so the day before. I asked her if 
she loved me. No answer. Would she not give me 
hope ? No answer and we left the parlour. She did

accidentally inclosed Mollie's letter in the wrong envelope.

not go back to school next day. Eyes were so sore that 
she could not study. 

" As she objected to going herself, knowing that I 
was going to stay longer, I argued favourably. She 
went back to school Friday morning, and came home 
again at night. Saturday evening I asked her how I 
was to know if she loved me, as I could not judge by 
her actions, and she would not tell me. Wednesday, 

Mrs. K had given me a book and a ring, making 

me promise not to tell who gave it to me; but I 
bought a dispensation to tell Mollie, as she had an idea 
that Mary T gave it to me. 

' ' The same day Mary T told me that she had 

shown my last letter to Mollie. 

" Sunday, rode to meeting together. Saw John 
P , also Miss P . 

" How did I like Mr. P ? was her question 

as we rode off together. 

" I said I was disappointed. 

" How was I disappointed? 

" I hardly knew. I couldn't say how only that 
I was disappointed. 

' ' I said I thought he was self -conceited. 

" I was the only person that ever said he was 
conceited, she replied. 

' ' It shows itself in ways not easily noticed, that I 
could see, having been conceited in those ways before, 
myself. 

148 



SPENCER REVISITS MISSOURI 

"At any rate, hadn't he the smallest hands and 
feet that I ever saw a man have? 

" I said that I had not noticed his hands, but that 
his feet, like those of all men who always wear tight 
boots, took up more room perpendicularly than hori- 
zontally words that I was ashamed of the minute 
I said them. I could not help glancing at my own 
heavy cow-hide boots, two sizes larger than my feet. 
I thought that perhaps she admired that which she 
had not herself. 

" Well, how did I like Miss Ewie? 

" ' I did not see her to know her,' I said; ' did 
she have on a red dress? ' 

" ' Yes.' 

" ' With black spots? ' 

" ' Yes.' 

'"She looked pretty fat,' I said. 'We call the 
colour of her dress " Devil's mourning." 

" ' You'd better hush,' she said, half laughing. 

" I laughed, and said, ' I beg your pardon, but 
you asked me ' and we dismounted. 

' ' Her mother had gone over to Belle 's, and I asked 
Mollie to take a walk. On a second invitation she con- 
sented ; but two of the young ones went with us, and 
I could say nothing. 

' ' The next day she went to school. I, determined 
on ' Yes ' or ' No, ' went with her. It was so cold and 
windy that I said nothing on the road, and we went 
ll 149 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

into school together. I was introduced to Miss Jennie 

H by Mollie, and seated myself. I had ample time 

for a little look around me, and my observations were 
these: The school consisted of about fifty scholars. 
The school-room was a log-house divided into two 
rooms, one of them warmed by a large fire-place, the 
other by a coal stove. In the other room was a piano, 
and I could hear some one practising. Several classes 
were called up, until finally Miss Jennie said she was 
sorry it was not Friday, as there would be more then 
to interest me, and asked me if I was fond of music. 
Forthwith the door into the other room was opened, 
showing the piano moved into the middle of the room. 
Several of the young ladies played, and among them 

Miss Ewie P . Then came recess, during which I 

asked Miss Jennie herself to play. She played two or 
three times, and ended by urging me to play or sing. 
I said I knew but one tune and I would sing that 
and I sang, 

'I am not myself, at all.' 

" From the effect I had a right to feel flattered. 
At noon Miss Jennie asked Mollie to show me up to 
dinner. As we sat in the parlour 1 alone, before dinner, 
I felt that it might be my last chance, but I could not 
speak. On the way back to the school-house, almost

from that in which was the school-room.

there, I said, ' I shall not see you again for years, Mol- 
lie; will you say " Yes " or " No "? ' 

" ' No ' quietly, firmly, and with no trembling 
in the voice. 

' ' We walked on three or four steps. 

" ' Give my compliments to Miss Jennie,' I said, 
* and ask her to excuse me. ' 

' ' ' Good-bye, ' I said, and held out my hand. 

" She gave hers with a steady clasp, and said, 
' Good-bye.' 

' ' I bent over to kiss her hand, but she put it down, 
with a strong effort, but I bent still lower and touched 
it, with my face almost to the ground. 

" ' I touched it! ' I said wildly, exultingly, yet 
not knowing what I said or why I said it. 

' ' I record these facts without any departure from 
truth, though they are to my shame, my sorrow, and 
to my great pain, and I would willingly omit them. 

' ' I got upon the mule, and I have not seen Mollie 
since. 

" ' No.' There was no pain then. Though I had 
long expected it, it came like a stunning blow. My 
mind was numb frozen to feel too soon the pain of 
thawing out. 

" ' No.' She whom I had loved above all others, 
above father and mother, she had said ' No.' 

' ' Oh ! that she may never feel the loneliness that I 
felt then. I, that had said I would hope while I had

life, I had lost hope. This was, this is my visit to Mis- 
souri. Farewell, sweet memories of departed days! 
" Home again to feel the dull p.ain grow sharp. 
Home again, now doubt, now despondency, then hope, 
bright hope! May our Father grant that if I am to 
go through the world poor, sick, despised, forsaken, 
at least I may have a friend. ' ' 



152 



CHAPTER XVII 

DROUGHT IN KANSAS 

" MAY God make me humble and contented with 
His will," wrote Spencer, soon after his return from 

Missouri. " I wrote to Mrs. K on Monday," he 

records on May llth. " For about a month back I have 
been amusing myself by writing stories. They are 
sources of real pleasure to me, and perhaps it is better 
than writing bad feelings in this journal. ' ' 

As to these literary recreations of his son, Mr. 0. C. 
Brown told me that the lad wrote at a table or desk 
in the same room in which Mr. Brown slept. ' ' Often 
I would awake about midnight to find Spencer still 
writing. I would say to him, ' Come, Spencer, it is 
time to stop that and go to bed. ' He would put away 
his papers without a word, and get ready for bed. 
This happened over and over again." Many frag- 
ments and some complete stories that he wrote at 
that time are extant. Whatever may be their defects 
or blemishes, they are all interesting, and all pure 
as snow. The plot is usually strong and well- 
wrought. ' ' 

But little more remains of Spencer's journal 
153 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

written in Kansas. His close and intelligent observa- 
tion of the love affairs of a young lady whom he fre- 
quently met will amuse her fair sisters who read the 
entertaining comments. 

' ' K has given her a splendid gold ring and a 

guitar, and sends her ' goodies ' almost every day. 
They go out riding two or three times a week. She is 
all the time receiving presents, not all of them from 

K . He sent her a dozen or more oranges last 

night. Besides, she received a large packet of maga- 
zines and papers from some one else." 

The next extract is very pleasing. His mother and 
his eldest and youngest sisters were away from home, 
visiting friends in the State of New York. A bache- 
lor 's hall is not at any time a paradise. To a boy who 
is not well, a motherless home is most depressing. 
Spencer writes: " I have been very sick. . . . 
Day before yesterday I went over to Aunt Mary's in 
the afternoon, and stayed all the next day until night. 
I had a very good time at my aunt's, and we had talk 
such as we never had before. I was more than usually 
disgusted with the life we are leading, and spoke very 
plainly to her about it. I have always had a restraint 
about going to see my aunt, I think because I love her 
so much that I don't like to make her trouble. I 
made some light remarks ' She would like to get rid 
of me before the afternoon was out. ' 

" This, in connection with one or two others, she 
154 



DROUGHT IN KANSAS 

answered in this wise : ' I don't like to have you sulk 
so. I love to have you come and see me, and it isn't 
any trouble at all to auntie.' 

1 ' ' I believe you, ' I said, and going across the room 
to her I kissed her face, held up for me. I have loved 
my aunt, for a little while lately, better than any other 
of my relations. ' ' 

I have not attempted to give, side by side with 
Spencer 's journal, the contemporary history of Kansas 
from 1856 to 1860. It is enough to say that private 
and partisan zeal and malice were busy, staining the 
map of the Territory with blood and charring it with 
incendiary fires. The boy wisely refrained from 
writing about these things, even in cipher. Moreover, 
he was used to them. They were too common to merit 
mention unless they touched his own town or people. 
He only wrote about that which, on account of its per- 
sonal or relative bearing, was engrossing his thoughts 
at the time. 

The drought of 1860, disappointing all hopes of in- 
come from sales of crops, involved Mr. Brown 's family 
in distresses that finally dispersed the different mem- 
bers of it. He gives some idea of the condition of 
things at Osawatomie, and throughout Kansas, in a 
letter written on July 16th. 

" Cornelia left us, in company of Uncle Ed and 
his wife, one week ago, for Utica, by way of Leaven- 
worth, St. Joe, Chicago, and Buffalo. We all leave 

155 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Osawatomie for somewhere, soon. We have not had six 
hours of good rain in ten months. Winter and spring 
wheat will yield less than the seed. Vegetables there 
are none. Some corn 1 may seed. The heat is 114 in 
the shade (Fahrenheit), the simoom drying and crisp- 
ing vegetation in an hour. The springs and streams 
are all dry; but, thank God, we have plenty of good 
water from wells, in town. I have nothing in my gar- 
den but a few small onions. Early corn, potatoes, peas, 
and everything else, blasted, dried up. There can be 
no hay cut, as my hill will burn like tinder. Money 
there is none. The biggest oxen in Kansas, worth 
formerly one hundred and forty dollars, now find no 
buyers at fifty to sixty dollars. I have a wagon and 
oxen. Shall ' roll out,' and, with the boys, get work 
where we can get something to eat. Sha'n't leave 
under four to six weeks. All well as usual. My own 
health, as usual, bad." 

A circular issued early in 1861 to the citizens of 
Oneida County, New York, more fully exhibits the 
pitiable plight to which the inhabitants of Kansas had 
come in consequence of the drought. 

" At a meeting of ward committees, appointed by 
the citizens of Utica, to solicit relief for the starving 
and destitute people of Kansas, the undersigned were 
requested to issue a circular to you. 

1 Corn, in the United States, means only Indian corn, or maize. 

156 



DROUGHT IN KANSAS 

' ' We believe a knowledge of facts is alone wanting 
to induce you to contribute of your abundance to re- 
lieve the destitution of others. It is undisputed that 
for thirteen months immediately preceding last Octo- 
ber there was a drought in a large part of Kansas back 
from the Missouri River. Fields of winter wheat 
yielded nothing. Corn planted in spring came up but 
never matured, and vegetables planted in gardens 
withered. In some instances three or four crops were 
planted, in the vain hope that rain might fall sufficient 
to secure at least one of these. And thus these people 
entered this winter, which has proved to be one of un- 
usual severity and depth of snow. Then commenced 
the selling of stock, furniture, and every available 
thing for the American people do not beg until it 
is that or starvation. The people of Kansas have not 
only no crops for immediate use, but no seed for the 
coming year, and no cattle to work their land. The 
people are not political adventurers ; they are chiefly 
bona fide settlers, women, and children. But even if 
they were not, we should feed a dog if he was starving. 

' ' Below we give you the evidence which we find in 
the hands of our own citizens, and from other authentic 
sources. We will only add this ... for your con- 
sideration: A drought in Oneida County of twelve 
months would produce beggary and incalculable suffer- 
ing among farmers, merchants, and mechanics, notwith- 
standing all our wealth. How much more disastrous 

157 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

must such a drought prove in a State so sparsely set- 
tled as Kansas, among a people most of whom are just 
breaking the soil, and whose all is invested in their land. 
' ' Such contributions, in money or clothing, as you 
feel disposed to give, after an examination of the facts 
submitted to you, you will please send to Mr. J. S. 
Peckham, of this place. 

' ' A. HUBBELL, Chairman. 
" J. F. SEYMOUR, Secretary. ' ' 

Part of the evidence given is a letter written by 
Mr. 0. C. Brown. 

Mr. W. F. M. Arny published a petition from the 
Legislature of Kansas .to the Legislature of New York, 
setting forth the story of the suffering and destitu- 
tion of the people of Kansas, acknowledging the liber- 
ality of citizens of New York, who had supplied food 
and clothing for the needy, and appending certain 
startling statistics taken from reports of township com- 
mittees that had applied for relief at Atchison. These 
showed that in two hundred and twenty-two townships 
there were forty-seven thousand destitute persons. 
Mr. Arny then called attention to the great need of 
suitable horses to draw the wagons engaged in trans- 
porting the provisions and goods contributed for the 
aid of the impoverished people. " In my trip of ten 
days in the interior of Kansas," wrote he, "I found 
over seventy teamsters with frozen feet or hands. 

158 



DROUGHT IN KANSAS 

. . . Teams reduced to skin and bone are too weak 
for long journeys. . . . Unless legislative aid is 
furnished hundreds will perish for want of food." 

The conclusion of the appeal consists of the narra- 
tive copied below. 

"ATCHISON, KANSAS, Feb. 21st {1861}. 
"A deputation from the Pottawatomies, 1 consisting 

of three chiefs, came in yesterday and applied for re- 
lief for their tribe. After sitting a few moments in 
General Pomeroy's office, Lassonibane, a venerable 
chief, arose and addressed the General as follows: 

" ' We have heard that you are the great father 
of the whites. Will you become father to my starving 
people 1 Two of my tribe have died already, and many 
are in danger of starvation if not immediately sup- 
plied. Our wives and children were crying about us 
when we left. They said, ' If you come back empty 
we shall starve. The annuities have been cut off; 
the traders will not sell us food, for we have no money ; 
our horses and cattle are dying ; and we have no seed. 
We left our home on Lake Michigan. My wigwam 
stood where now is the great city of Chicago. We were 
removed from Council Bluffs. Never in my life have 
I seen such suffering among my people. If you will 
help us, we shall live ; if not, we shall die. ' 

" Lassonibane is a fine-looking Indian, and spoke 
fluently and with great emotion. He represented two

hundred and fifty of his tribe to be in the most desti- 
tute condition, which account was corroborated by 
statements from that part of the country. 

" General Pomeroy loaded for them ten wagons 
with provisions, which will last them till spring. ' ' 

In that dreadful year of dearth and famine the 
family of Mr. Brown was broken up, for a time. Only 
the father and three children stayed in Kansas. Spen- 
cer, when not engaged in duties on the farm, or in 
helping his father to write the records of the town (of 
which Mr. Brown was agent) , employed his hours in 
study. " He read many standard works of history, 
poetry, or general literature. ' ' He kept notes of what 
he read, and wrote hundreds of pages in which he gave 
his views upon the subjects of his reading. When there 
was no longer any field that had not been parched and 
destroyed by the drought, when there was no remuner- 
ative business to induce him to stay longer in Osawat- 
omie, the days passed wearily enough, and Spencer 
could not contentedly apply himself to study or compo- 
sition. He resolved to quit home, to find elsewhere, if 
possible, profitable employment. He wrote to Colonel 
Boone, who had taken such a kind interest in him, 
when he was a captive: "You will perhaps remem- 
ber my name ... as that of the little prisoner 
you had in the Bull Creek camp in 1856. I am young 
and am willing to do any honest labour by which to 
make a living. ... I would prefer, however, a 

160 



DROUGHT IN KANSAS 

situation in which by remaining permanently I could 
rise in the business, whatever it might be. ' ' 

The minds of his father and mother had been much 
exercised to find suitable place and work for him. On 
November 5th Mrs. Brown wrote to her husband from 
Buffalo, New York, on the subject: " I am pleased 
that you see an opportunity for Rockwell, and con- 
clude you must be the best judge of matters there, 
though it occurred to us all here that that was just 
the opportunity for Spencer. Mr. Kingsley thinks 
Spencer has a decided literary taste and was, years 
ago, a good writer for one of his age. He thought such 
an opportunity would open the way to literary ad- 
vancement. I hope something as good J will soon open 
for him. I think his talents have been buried long 
enough. . . . Spencer will die, mentally and mor- 
ally, if he does not soon have some incentive for 
living. ' ' Then, contrasting the dearth in Kansas with 
the plentiful provisions in New York State, she writes : 
"Apples are so abundant and cheap that they are a 
drug. Potatoes have been very cheap. I never saw 
finer grapes and pears. The only drawback in the en- 
joyment of them is that you are not here to share them 
with us. ... Tell Spencer to keep up good cour- 
age, and I trust there will soon be just the right open- 
ing for him." 

1 Employment had been found for Rockwell in a newspaper 
office. 

161 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

To Rockwell she wrote : " I trust Spencer is able to 
get that situation in the Journal of Commerce office, 
Kansas City, which your father spoke of. We feel, 
Kitty and I, as if that would be the best for Spencer. ' ' 

A few days later she wrote to Spencer. Speaking 
of her journey and voyage from Kansas to New York, 
she said : " It was considered very hazardous to come 
by the lakes at this season of the year, and some won- 
dered that I should do so; but you know it was the 
only way I could come. 1 I came on the propeller 
Mohawk, Captain Pheatt. We were wind-bound at 
Milwaukee one day and night, and it was very rough 
when we left there. It was very rough all down Lake 
Huron, and we were so sick, Lily and I, that we kept 
our beds till noon of the next day. We were five days 
from Milwaukee. We had a good boat. 

" The captain's wife and one other lady, with a 
Methodist minister, a Mr. Millard, and the captain, 
made a pleasant company. The very next trip this 
same steamboat burst her boiler, and five men were 
killed and the boat immediately sank. It was a mer- 
ciful Providence that brought us safe. ... I hope 
and trust some way will soon open for you. Kitty and 
I talk and think and study to devise some way for you. 
. . . When I think of you all 2 so far from me, it 
is hard to be reconciled to such a stern necessity, and

if I could not, as nightly I lay my head upon my pillow, 
commit you to the care of One who is all-powerful 
and all-gracious to aid, protect, and cherish and com- 
fort you, I could not sleep. Spencer, my dear boy, 
can you not look to Him for comfort, as when, once 
before, you sought, and, I believe, found Him ? If so, 
He is your Father still. Then look to Him again, with 
a penitent, believing heart, and He will not turn you 
away. If you have loved Him once, He will surely 
perfect the good work He has begun with you. Write 
to me, and tell me all that interests and concerns you. 
I can hardly suppose your father is still with you. If 
he is, tell him and Rockwell I wait for answers to my 
letters. . . . Give my love to Fanny and Freddy ; 
and Lily sends hers to you all. She gets a little home- 
sick sometimes. Kitty expects to go to Utica this week.

On November 1st Spencer wrote to young Mr. 

P , a son of H. P / the celebrated sculptor. 

Although he mentioned the drought and scarcity of 
breadstuffs, so characteristically sprightly was the let- 
ter that his correspondent would little suspect the ex- 
tremity to which his friend had come the dire neces- 
sity, the desperation, which would drive him into exile 
on the morrow.

SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

On November 2, 1860, he bade good-bye to his 
father, brother, and sister, taking his way towards Mis- 
souri, where he had often been urged by Doctor K 

to teach a school. He had gone from home before his 
mother wrote the loving letter given above. For a few 
days he taught the school obtained for him through 
the influence of his good friend. Then he was warned 
to be gone from that neighbourhood within forty-eight 
hours. His name was Brown, and he was from Kansas. 
Having no means of support, taking with him only the 
clothes that were on his back, to save his life he fled 
towards St. Louis, stopping here and there to earn by 
manual labour enough to supply his daily need.

CHAPTER XVIII 

THE IMPENDING CRISIS 

THAT certain Missourians banished Spencer from 
their school and neighbourhood was no occasion for 
wonder. His name and origin were enough to excite 
suspicion. The memory of Old John Brown's slave- 
freeing incursions into their State alarmed these peo- 
ple. Spencer went to Missouri at the wrong time. The 
Republican party that very month elected Abraham 
Lincoln President of the United States. To the oli- 
garchy of the slave-labour States Mr. Lincoln seemed 
to incarnate enmity to slavery and the South. 

It had been declared by the Republican party that 
there was " an irrepressible conflict between freedom 
and slavery ' ' ; that ' ' the Republic cannot exist half 
slave and half free ' ' ; and that ' ' freedom is the nor- 
mal condition of all territory. ' ' On the other hand, it 
had been declared by that wing of the Democratic 
party which nominated John C. Breckenridge for the 
Presidency " that no power existed that might law- 
fully control slavery in the Territories ' ' ; that slavery 
existed in any Territory, in full force, whenever a 
slave-holder and his slaves entered it ; and that it was 
12 165 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

the duty of the National Government to protect slave- 
holders who should practically assert this doctrine. 
The men who conspired against the life of the nation 
were in this faction. Their aim was to annul the 
principle of popular sovereignty maintained by the 
regular Democratic party, which had nominated Doug- 
las for the Presidency. 

For this principle all Pro-Slavery Southerners had 
rigorously contended only six years before. They had 
found it to work against them in Kansas. To enact 
positive laws that would allow them " to call the roll 
of their slaves even under the shadow of Bunker Hill 
monument," if they should choose so to do, became 
their new purpose. Their bolder leaders counselled 
the slave-labour States to see to it, in case their ex- 
treme requirements should be refused by the country, 
that concerted action be taken to precipitate the South 
into revolution. These men had struck down their 
great political party merely because it had declined to 
go with them to the length of their preposterous de- 
mands. They had thus made possible the election of 
Abraham Lincoln. They had sowed the wind, and 
were yet to reap the whirlwind. 

Probably Spencer was but just installed teacher of 
a school in Missouri when tidings of the election of 
Lincoln filled the State with fury. Perhaps we should 
praise the moderation that at such a time, in such a 
place, allowed a Free-Soil man from Kansas to escape 

166 



THE IMPENDING CRISIS 

with his life. I cannot think that anything else than 

the friendship of Doctor K preserved him from 

death. Already the politicians of the South were busy 
preparing to bring about the secession of the slave- 
labour States from the Union. Although they had 
clamoured so loudly for " popular sovereignty " in 
1854, believing then that they coul'd depend upon the 
ingress to Kansas of overwhelming numbers of South- 
ern men, these astute politicians knew better than to 
appeal at once to the masses in the South for a mandate 
to dissolve the Union of States. The conventions that 
declared the independence of the several Southern 
States had no faith in ' ' popular sovereignty. ' ' They 
were made up of political demagogues not of chosen 
representatives of the people. Arrogantly they took 
things in their own hands, and declared their respect- 
ive States out of the Union. From the date of the 
triumph of the Republican party the decree went forth 
to organize a separate " Confederacy." They hoped 
to carry their plans by a coup d'etat. Their temple 
should rise as did the house of the Lord in Solomon's 
time. The stones should be made ready before they 
were brought upon the ground where the building 
should stand. 

" Suddenly, while no sound of hammer, or axe, or 
any tool of iron, should be heard by the millions of the 
North, the mighty minster should be reared. The 
North should awake some fine morning to be confronted 

167

and confounded by the completed structure. African 
mothers, as bowed caryatides, should support the mag- 
nificent pile. From its lofty dome Southern chivalry, 
on horseback, should look down, with stony gaze, upon 
fields tilled under the crack of the overseer's lash. 
This was the Midsummer's Dream of the conspirators 
in 1860. They had forgotten that God planned Solo- 
mon's temple, whereas the designs for theirs had very 
different origin. 

The men that quarried made too much noise. Their 
blasts roused the nation. As the appointed time to 
rear the edifice drew near, opposing hosts began to 
muster in the North. 



168 



CHAPTER XIX 

A SOLDIER 

IN his flight towards St. Louis, Spencer stopped 
long enough to write a brief memorandum, which he 
sent to his sister, then in Utica, New York. Mrs. 
Brown forwarded the note to Kansas. It gave her hus- 
band the first tidings of his son's safety. The short 
and stained original lies before me. 

" INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI, Nov. 23d." 
1 ' Prospects a little better. 

" SPENSE." 

" Independence, Missouri, December 12th. Times 
improving ' slightually.' Send me a letter immedi- 
ately if you want me to get it, and be sure to address 
it to Spencer Kellogg, Independence, Missouri. Don't 
write the word Brown, inside or out. I do not expect 
to be here long. Send this home, and write immedi- 
ately on receipt. I shall not write home until making 
something. 

" SPENSE." 

Sad as the boy's plight is, his drollness must ex- 
press itself in one word of slang. 

" Henceforth," wrote his father, " the name of 
169 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Brown was dropped, and Kansas was not to be men- 
tioned in any letters from his friends. Nor did he 
dare write to his father in Kansas, but sent his letters 
to his mother and sisters, then in Utica, whither they 
had gone because of the drought. ' ' 

In a letter to her husband, Spencer's mother ex- 
presses her anxiety for the safety of the fugitive. She 
found comfort in faith. " I hope I am learning to 
trust my heavenly Father, or, as Fred Williams x says, 
' to take Him at His word. ' ' 

To his mother's letter Spencer's reply came from 
Kentucky. 

" NEWPORT BARRACKS, KENTUCKY, Jan. 27, '61. 

11 DEAR MOTHER: I was much pleased to hear 
from you, for the first time since leaving home. I 
should have answered your letter before, only I had 
a little attack of dumb-ague on top of the most clinging 
cold of nearly three weeks' duration. But there's no 
great loss without some small gain, and my gain is 
that I am thus enabled to give you the required in- 
formation on the subject of the care I get when sick. 

" If you look up the sheet a little way you may 
read, ' Newport Barracks, ' and at this place about two 
hundred and fifty men, myself included, are wearing 
Uncle Sam's livery, and awaiting orders.

ing done my best to get work, that the alternative was 
to enlist or go back, and so I enlisted. 

" But we are getting away from our subject. After 
feeling as mean as the ague can make a man feel, for 
a day and a half, I went to the hospital (at the ap- 
pointed hour) and the doctor gave me a strong dose of 
ipecac, into which was stirred a cathartic (calomel). 
Both together weakened me so much that I could hard- 
ly leave my bed five minutes, and at night I did not 
get to sleep until, after one o 'clock, I heard the guard 
relieved. But it was all right, and to-day, by the doc- 
tor's order, the steward gave me quinine three times 
at nine, eleven, and twelve and I begin to feel quite 
convalescent. So much for being sick. 

" And now, as I am still very weak, I know you 
will excuse the brevity of this, and when I feel a little 
more ' prosy ' I'll tell you about the barracks and 
much more that you will be interested in. 

' ' I have only one favour to ask. Send me a Trib- 
une once in a while, if you can, for I am in a great 
dearth of news. 

' ' Let me hear from you often. 

" SPENCER. 

' ' Did Sister K receive a letter from me dated 

from Independence, Missouri ? ' ' 

A month after his enlistment Spencer wrote to his 
father from Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, explaining 

171 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

that he had enlisted because he was unwilling to go 
back to be a burden to his parents while times were 
so hard in Kansas ; declared himself contented in his 
new lot, but alert to seize the first opportunity to im- 
prove it; and asked his father to consider what the 
political state of the country foreboded for the army. 
He thought it probable that the company to which he 
had been assigned and other troops would be ordered 
to Washington to help " keep everything straight at 
the inauguration ' ' of President Lincoln, but expected 
to be sent, first, to the arsenal at St. Louis, to repel 
attacks threatened by the faction that favoured the 
movement to organize a Southern Confederacy. 

Indeed, nothing but wise and prompt action kept 
the " Secessionists " from seizing that arsenal, with 
all the ordnance stored there. To supply the South 
with muskets, sabres, and all equipments, and also with 
artillery, the conspirators tried to get possession of 
forts and arsenals within the bounds of the Slave- 
labour States, and endeavoured to remove such stores 
from United States arsenals on Northern soil, to 
ship them to military posts in the Cotton States. Per- 
jured traitors who were members of President Buchan- 
an 's Cabinet actually issued orders to effect such re- 
movals. At Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, by command of 
the Secretary of War, heavy artillery was taken from 
the Allegheny Arsenal to the wharf on the Mononga- 
hela River, to be shipped down the Ohio and Missis- 

172 



A SOLDIER 

sippi Rivers. The intensely loyal citizens would not 
allow the orders of the Secretary to be carried out. 
The guns were taken back to the arsenal. 

Spencer thought it a good joke when he was de- 
tailed one of four cooks for the company to which he 
was attached ! No doubt his experience in Kansas had 
taught him all the rudiments of his culinary calling. 

' ' It would do you good to see me writing now. I 
am perched upon a bunk about twelve feet from the 
floor and on the third tier, with my feet hanging over 
the edge, the paper resting on a piece of pasteboard 
on my knees. . . . This is my second letter, not- 
withstanding my busy cooking duties, which are some- 
thing besides nominal, as you can imagine. 

" (Next day.) It is about ten o'clock now, and we 
were obliged to have everything done up for ' inspec- 
tion ' an hour since, and I have a few minutes before 
getting ready for dinner. I don't object to the cook- 
ing, much, as it has its privileges, such as unstinted 
rations, no roll-calls to answer, and no drill. . . . 
There is a good allowance for clothes $45.97 the first 
year, and, successively, $33.43, $38.86, $33.43, and 
$36.25 and, as the things are almost all furnished at 
cost prices, the money covers a great deal. Our pay 
is $11.00 a month. . . . Yesterday made just a 
month since I enlisted, and I have only spent one dol- 
lar and forty cents. To-day (Saturday) our privileges 
stick out a little, for it is ' general police,' and the 

173 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

whole company (except eight for chopping and carry- 
ing wood) are scrubbing floors, dry, with brick and 
sand, washing windows, scrubbing the mess-table and 
benches and the brick floors, and chopping extra wood 
for Sunday. 

"As for us, the cooks, we stand and look on. 
. . . Of course, on ' general police ' there is no 
drill, and, as there are twice as many men as are needed 
to do the work, there is not much growling, but very 
often a good deal of fun. To-morrow (Sunday) is 
' general inspection, ' when the whole garrison turn out 
with their arms. Every button must be in the highest 
state of polish, every shoe shining, and all clothes well 
brushed. The arms are all examined closely, and gen- 
erally are in the highest polish. The iron ramrods are 
rung in the bottom to see if the guns are clean inside. 
If any man's hair is too long he gets orders to cut it. 
. . . Immediately after parade all go into their 
rooms, the knapsacks are spread out on the floor, with 
the overcoats neatly folded on one side and all the 
clothes on the other, and the men stand behind them 
and in front of their bunks while the major and lieu- 
tenant make the tour of the rooms. ... In the 
kitchen, every knife, fork, and spoon is shining, the 
cups are stacked up in bright order, and the tin plates 
are ranged in neat order in the cupboards. 

" Of course the tables and floors are clean, after 
Saturday's scouring. The men stand behind their open 

174 



A SOLDIER 

knapsacks, and the head cook is responsible for any- 
thing that is wrong. Two men are detailed every night 
as room-orderlies (on Sundays there are two assist- 
ants), and they are obliged to see that the room is 
clean, that no one spits on the floors, that nothing is 
stolen (if anything is stolen they are responsible), and 
they must stay in the rooms while the company is ab- 
sent, on drill, at meals, or otherwise. They must also 
see that good fires are kept, if needed ; that every man 's 
things are in order, fit for the morning inspection; 
and that all lights, fires excepted, are put out at 
'taps.' . . . 

" Tell Aunt Mary that I should like to see her. 
Tell Uncle Charley that he will ' never see his darling 
(overcoat *) any more.' ' 

The strain upon the affections, and the anxieties 
that tried the separated members of many a Kansan 
family in those days, are apparent in the next letters. 

Mrs. Brown wrote to her husband, on February 
15th, from Utica, New York : ' ' The world seems dark 
to me, so long without you. When shall we meet? 
. . . What do you conclude? I little thought of 
such a long separation when I left you. If I had one 
hundred dollars I would go back in April unless you

home, but which the boy had been obliged to leave when he was

conclude it is best to come here. ... I am feeling 
so distressed about Spencer that it takes the spirit all 
out of me, but I do try to commit him to my Saviour 
and trust that He will take care of him. If you come, 
if we can learn whether he is still at Newport, Ken- 
tucky, would it not be well for you to come by way of 
Cincinnati x and get a proper situation for him, and 
take him, he being under age ? ' ' 

Appended to the letter given above is one to Mr. 
Brown from his eldest daughter. 

' ' MY DEAR FATHER : . . . I presume you have 
about made up your mind to come this way as soon as 
possible. I want to see you very much, and a change 
will perhaps do you good ; but I hope you will not take 
final leave of Kansas, because a roof there, though 
humble, is better than no roof at all to say nothing 
of a farm. . . . With a friendly President, who 
knows but brighter days are dawning for us ? After 
living in the West, the East does not seem so pleasant, 
unless one is very rich. 

" What do you think about Spencer? It seems 
dreadful to me. 

" Monday morning, February 18, 1861. We re- 
ceived your letter Friday evening, and a portion of it 
was published in this morning's paper. . . . There 
also came a letter from Spencer, from Newport Bar- 

1 Which was not far from Newport, Kentucky.

racks, Kentucky. He has been sick. Grandpa seems to 
feel very bad about him, and says he thinks you could 
claim him, as he is under age. . . . Could you not 
write and claim him ? 

" Your loving daughter, 

11 KITTY." 



In the letter to his father, Spencer mentioned the 
recent removal of the command to which he belonged 
from Kentucky to Missouri. These were both border 
States of great importance, and the protection on the 
one hand of St. Louis, and of Cincinnati and Louisville 
on the other, required such shifting of troops as per- 
plexed all observers who did not appreciate the entire 
inadequacy of the small regular army of the United 
States to the exigencies occasioned by the threatening 
attitude of the South. Military organizations were 
forming and drilling in all the Slave-labour States. 
As a black cloud, surcharged with tempest, hangs above 
the western horizon on a summer eve, fringed with 
fiery light, so the gloomy portent of rebellion wherever 
it hovered over our Southern States was outlined by 
gleaming bayonets. The brilliancy of the spectacle 
could not cause the country to forget that soon must 
come the night of war, the lightning and thunder of 
battle. 

However, Spencer does not seem to have indulged 
177 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

gloomy apprehensions of the future. There is de- 
lightful union of gaiety and affection in the opening 
of his next letter, written on February 20th, from ' ' St. 
Louis Arsenal, Missouri. ' ' 

" MY MOTHER: I salute you! That's soldier- 
fashion, isn 't it ? You see I write in spirits, being well, 
and hearty, although a little tired, having just come 
off guard. 

" I wrote to you and Kitty from Jefferson Bar- 
racks, and, as I expected, was soon after (some ten 
days) ordered, with two hundred others, to this place. 
There are now collected here five hundred men, or 
nearly so many the Government evidently fearing 
some attack upon the large amount of stores, arms, 
ammunition, etc., collected here. We are confined as 
closely as convicts in a penitentiary, and a large num- 
ber of guards continually on post, with the strictest 
orders. Monday we threw up several earthen breast- 
works, and yesterday some unfinished ones were com- 
pleted. Yesterday morning I mounted guard at nine, 
and, being on the third relief, I was not on post until 
one P. M. There are three reliefs on every post, each 
standing guard two hours, and consequently it is two 
hours on and four off ; so, being on from one to three 
p. M., I came on again from seven until nine, and again 
four hours after, at one, and, the last, from seven 
until nine this morning ; when there was a new guard, 

178 



A SOLDIER 

and we were marched off to the shooting-grounds, to 
fire off the loads in our guns at a target one hundred 
yards distant. 

' ' We were then marched towards the quarters and 
ordered to ' Break ranks March! ' upon which 
every one started for home (quarters) as fast as he 
could run. Thus, you see, in the twenty-four hours we 
are eight hours ' walking post. ' But, then, on guard 
one has his little privileges, such as no drill on the day 
that he comes off, and no ' fatigue duty. ' For instance 
a few moments before I commenced writing there 
were orders given to parade the company, and we were 
all turned out ; but on the parade-ground the ones that 
came off guard were ordered to fall out, and while we 
returned to our quarters the remainder of the company 
marched away for some fatigue, probably placing the 
artillery behind the breastworks lately thrown up all 
of which are pierced for cannon. 

' ' There is strong probability that the arsenal may 
be attacked, but it will be a most desperate job taking 
it, on account of the great facilities for defence, and 
the desperate determination of both officers and men. 

" I wrote to father about twelve days since and 
have yet received no answer. I saw, in the Missouri 
Republican, that Conway had presented a bill for in- 
demnity to the losers in the political troubles in Kan- 
sas. Please tell me of its progress if you see any re- 
port in the papers. 

179 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

' ' Tell Kitty that I should be glad to hear from her, 
and that I will write to her. 

' ' In case of an attack I will write to you immedi- 
ately afterwards ; and if I should be injured, a friend, 
if he lives, will write to you, I doing the same for him 
if he should be harmed. 

" SPENCER. 
" Don't write until you hear from me. S." 

His mother, fearing that Spencer would be ordered 
to Washington, wrote to her husband urging him to 
seek their son in St. Louis. Doubtless she expected 
Mr. Brown to take some steps to obtain the young 
soldier's discharge. She, and the boy's grandfather, 
could not be reconciled to the thought of the degrading 
associations which they supposed must be his lot as an 
enlisted man in the regular army. 

In truth, little else than the scum of immigration 
from foreign lands found its way into the American 
Army in times of peace until just before the opening 
of the Civil War. Already, when Spencer enlisted, 
the character of the recruits was beginning to change. 
Some of his new companionships were not pleasing, but 
he contrived, on the whole, to accommodate himself to 
the necessities of the case. On March 8, 1861, he wrote 
from the St. Louis Arsenal to his sister Kitty : 

" I have ' raised ' five cents, the first ' show ' I 
180 



A SOLDIER 

have had for paying the postage on a letter since I fin- 
ished the stamps that you and Mother sent ; and after 
due deliberation I have concluded to use the money to 
send a letter to Mother and yourself in preference to 
Father and Rock, from both of whom I have lately 
heard. Money is very scarce, or I should have written 
to you before; but most of the men are in daily ex- 
pectation of a pay-day, which will give me fifteen dol- 
lars, or thereabouts, clear money, and, after paying 
Newman, I shall have ten dollars to lay away towards 
my stock-money. That means that I am trying to save 
two hundred and fifty dollars to buy stock, to go into 
stock-raising in Kansas with Rock, if he is able by 
myself, if I must. 

" You see, I get eleven dollars a month, of which 
one dollar is kept back until the end of my five years. 
I also get one hundred and ninety-eight dollars, lack- 
ing four cents, in clothing, during my five years ' term. 
That may look very little to you, but everything is of 
the best, and furnished at cost prices. Very many men 
save as much as seventy-five dollars in clothing money, 
which is paid to them at the end of their term; so I 
hope for at least fifty dollars clothing money. 

" So you see that a man need have very little 
trouble in saving a hundred dollars a year which is 
my mark more if I can. I am sorry to say that I 
fear my bright prospects, before spoken of, are likely 
to be disappointed. 

13 181 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" Tell Mother she need not fear that I will hurt 
myself romancing, as I have entirely quit it since I 
left home. This enlisting one is apt to find a most 
sober reality, and I am getting over some of my fool- 
ishness, at least. Still, I cannot help wanting to see 
loved ones again, when I lie down after a good ' sing ' 
in company with two or three gifted ones. But I com- 
fort myself with the prospect of better times even 
with five years' probation. I should be glad if Rock 
is able to have money to put with mine for the business 
I spoke of, for we should then have quite a good cap- 
ital. I have not given up my old idea of going South 
to live, and I hope, having good success, to be able to 
retire, at the age of thirty-five, to a pleasant seaport, 
either in the South or in South America. That may 
look a long way ahead to you, but soldiers get into the 
habit of considering a five years' enlistment as but a 
short thing ; nor is it to be wondered at, judging by the 
way the days slip by. 

"As I stay away from home I begin, slowly, but I 
think surely, to find out where I am weak, and where 
strong. I do not think a few years in the service will 
do any harm. I would like to introduce you to a little 
of my company. 

' ' There 's C , not a very prepossessing face, but 

full of mischief, and as full of music what else he 
is I do not know, but he's a good singer. I sold him 
a shirt and pair of drawers (Government) a dollar

and a half in all; but it was not a business trans- 
action, though I shouldn't be surprised if I got 
my pay. 

" Then there's K , from Canada not very 

strongly English wears a Masonic breastpin, has 
taken five degrees wears a beard half an inch long. 
He is a little tall, but straight pleasant-looking 
plays whist with me not a bad companion anywhere 
knows a few songs, correctly. 

" There's O'C , my little Irish ' bunky ' (that 

is, we sleep together) short, stubby, red-faced, drinks 
whisky, but does not get ' tight ' ; smokes, but is try- 
ing to quit ; gets mad in a flash, and over it as quickly ; 
and has, in all probability, seen better days. There 
is one thing he speaks good English and grammat- 
ically, although sometimes with a little emphasis. 

" Then, there's G , our corporal. Knows all 

the German operas and is all the time singing or whist- 
ling them I try to help him once in a while. Without 
bragging, I think I am developing a very good voice. 
We succeed in having some first-rate music perhaps 
the more pleasing to me that much of it is new. There's 
much, after all, that takes in a soldier's life for if 
we see but little pleasure, there is under the average 
of care and trouble although some hardship. 

" Never mind, K , when I get to living on the 

coast of South America I will try if I cannot find 
comfort, even if happiness is denied. . . .

" Please let me hear from yourself and Mother 
often, and do not wait for me, as I may not always 
find a stamp." 

" ST. Louis ARSENAL, MISSOURI, March 25, 1861. 

' ' DEAR SISTER : I came off guard the day after I 
received your letter, and, getting a pass to go into 
town, I only had time to write part of a letter to Matie, 
which letter I inclose for you to give her, giving her the 
preference because I felt more like writing to her than 
to you you understand ? You may read it, or not, as 
you please. If you see her, give it to her ; if not, please 
inclose and send it. You cannot understand what an 
intense longing some of us poor sinners have for some 
ladies' society; and next to that will be receiving a 
letter occasionally from a girl such as I believe Matie 
to be. 

" Pay-day has come and gone, making life here, 
to me, but so much harder. While I had no money I 
was contented ; now I begin to have longings. I shall 
go to South America, first you know ! 

" I have spent five dollars since pay-day, and in 
its place I have now gloves, chess-men, stamps, cap- 
cover, pocket-inkstand, writing-paper, pocket-knife, 
and porte-monnaie ; besides some other things that I 
did have but haven 't now in one sense at least. It is 
impossible to keep stamps only look: I bought six 
stamped envelopes (twenty-five cents) three or four 

184 



A SOLDIER 

days since, and you sent me one ; well, one friend has 
the stamp, and three or four of the envelopes my chum, 

'C , must have. It 's np use to talk of refusing 

'twould be cutting my own throat. There, one whom 

1 would oblige as a friend ; here, one who lent me paper. 

O'C would not refuse me anything that he has. 

Comically enough, and unusually, too, he likes me bet- 
ter than I like him. I record the thing because it does 
not happen every day. So, if you want to hear from 
me regularly, you must send me a stamp. Keep ac- 
count of them, and next pay-day I '11 send them back. 

" You ought to have seen how miserable I was last 
night. I had just come off guard, and, getting a pass, 
rambled round St. Louis a good share of the after- 
noon. Well, I was pretty tired, and when my friend

was a good deal pent up, you see. Well, I have par- 
tially recovered this morning enough at least to 
clean out my gun (I just now am interrupted by an 
application for a postage-stamp, and 'twon 't do to re-

if he liked), and finish my letter to Matie, besides 
writing you one.

' ' Tell Mother that I will write to her once a week,

" ST. Louis ARSENAL, MISSOURI, April 2, 1861. 

1 ' DEAR K : . . . I want to tell you about 

I n, our second sergeant. I n and myself 

struck up an acquaintance at Newport, Kentucky ; but 
at Jefferson, from circumstances, this acquaintance 
was necessarily interrupted, and when we came to the 
arsenal I succeeded in doing something that angered 
him. So, the acquaintance hasn't progressed much 
here. But during the last two weeks, or thereabouts, 
we have been on somewhat better terms, and I am now 
in the squad of men under his charge. I n is a fine- 
looking fellow, somewhere between twenty-five and 
thirty years of age, with a most peculiar turn of mind, 
generous, and so just that having power he does not 
abuse it. He has also a most reserved manner, making 
no friends, admitting but few acquaintances. At New- 
port I used frequently to sit upon the side of his bunk, 
while, most curiously, he would speculate upon the 
small amount it would take to set up a small farm 
upon which one could earn a nice living, sojourning 
betimes in the neatest of little white cottages, with the 
prettiest of graceful little women. ' What is the mat- 

186 



A SOLDIER 

ter with I n? ' thought I. ' What is his main 

point? ' ' What has made him so misanthropic, 
and so reserved? ' But last week I think I found 
out the reason. I will not tell you what I think it 
was, but only the incident which made me think I 
knew. 

' ' I happened to speak of wanting to be transferred 
to the artillery, and he inquired my reasons. I told 
him that I liked the service better, and that I had a 
friend he interrupted me with a violent exclamation, 
at the same time striking the bench upon which we 
were sitting with his clinched fist. ' There is no such 
thing as a friend, ' he said. The reason of the remark 
struck me in a moment, and I could not help saying, 
' You didn't always think so.' In less than a minute 
after he went away, with some half-spoken excuse. 
But since then he has been very much more cordial and 
pleasant, and a day or so afterward we were divided 
into squads, and when I fell to his squad I had to leave 
my old abiding-place and take up my sojourn in a 
strange land, which happened to be the next bed but 

one to where I n slept. ' Why don't you take 

this place? ' said he, pointing to a place still nearer 
to his bed than where I was. ' The bed was my 
bunky 's,' I began, ' and I ' He cut me rather short : 
* Oh, it doesn 't make any difference to me, but I 

thought you wouldn 't like to sleep so near that B . ' 

I smiled inwardly. I think I was pleased. What dif- 

187 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

ference was it to him whether I slept near B or 

not, and why so much anxiety to excuse a little ap- 
parent interest ? We '11 see by-and-bye. So ends this 
little episode for the present."

CHAPTER XX 

IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

DURING the dreary winter of 1860-61 loyal Amer- 
icans held their breath and asked, " What next? " 
Mr. Buchanan 's embarrassed Administration at Wash- 
ington accepted for its guidance the counsel of At- 
torney-General Black, whose opinion it was that the 
Government had no right to ' ' coerce ' ' States or peo- 
ple. They might secede from the Union at pleasure, 
and set up within the territorial bounds of what had 
been the United States a new nation or nations, and 
the President must make no armed resistance to the 
revolt ! This monstrous decision was acknowledgment 
of State Sovereignty with a vengeance ! Because the 
consent of the States was necessary to form the Union, 
the States were Sovereign supremely and exclusively 
and might withdraw at pleasure ! Apply the prin- 
ciple to marriage : at once its falsity is apparent. 

The traitorous Secretary of the Navy had sent war- 
ships of the Government to the other side of the globe. 
A traitor at the head of the War Department had 
robbed the arsenals in the North to supply the South 
with ordnance, proportionately impoverishing the na- 

189 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

tion. A vessel sent to provision Fort Sumter, in the 
harbour of Charleston, South Carolina, and to re- 
enforce the garrison there, was fired upon by rebels. 
Traitors in Congress were busy all winter devising 
ways and means to dismember the Federal Union. Mill- 
ions of Northern men clinched their fists and ground 
their teeth, waiting impatiently for the inauguration 
of Abraham Lincoln. His inaugural address had the 
right ring. It threw out no foolish boasts, or threats. 
" He expressed the most kindly regard for the people 
of every portion of the Republic, and his determination 
to administer the Government impartially, for the pro- 
tection of every citizen and every interest. At the 
same time he announced his resolution to enforce the 
laws, protect the public property, and repossess that 
which had already been seized by the insurgents. ' ' He 
reminded the conspirators that he had taken a solemn 
oath to protect the Constitution and the Union. 

Early in April the Government informed the au- 
thorities of South Carolina that supplies would be 
sent to Fort Sumter, " peaceably, or forcibly." On 
April 12th the insurgents, under General Beauregard, 
opened fire, with " full thirty heavy guns," on Fort 
Sumter and the flag of the United States. Thus be- 
gan the Civil War. Immediately the loyal multitudes 
of the North ran up the Stars and Stripes on tall 
liberty-poles in every city, town, and village; decked 
almost every public building, including churches and 

190 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

school-houses, with bunting ; filled the land with flags ; 
and made ready to vindicate the supremacy of the Na- 
tional Government, at any cost of treasure and of 
blood. The struggle was about over when the gallant 
officer 1 who had defended Fort Sumter until only its 
ruins remained, and, evacuating the post, had borne 
away with him the insulted but not dishonoured flag, 
was delegated to raise again, in triumph, that self- 
same flag above the shapeless and blackened pile that 
had been Fort Sumter a mass of debris now, which 
fitly symbolized the doom of the " Southern Confed- 
eracy. ' ' 

In April, 1861, Mr. O. C. Brown, taking his little 
daughter Fanny with him, set out from Osawatomie 
to join that part of his family which was in the East. 
As he went down the Missouri River, his wife ascended 
it on her way to join him in Kansas. Thus they missed 
one another. Eager to see Spencer, despairing of Mr. 
Brown's being able to join her in New York, the de- 
voted wife and mother borrowed money to return to 
Osawatomie. On the way she stopped in St. Louis to 
see her soldier-son. 

"OSAWATOMIE, April 22, 1861. 

" MY DEAR HUSBAND: Ascertaining at St. Louis 
that you had not been there, and, through Mr. Bailey, 
that you had not been in Chicago, I flattered myself 

i Anderson. 

191 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

that I should get here before you left. I was greatly 
disappointed when told at Kansas City that we had 
missed each other on the river. I wished very much 
to see you before you left, yet I am rejoiced that you 
could get away ; also that you have taken Fanny. She 
ought to go to school. I had reasons for wishing to 
come back which I did not wish to commit to paper, 
but I would gladly have conferred with you. I be- 
lieve I am acting judiciously. 

" . . . I came sooner than I intended, and 
without delay on the way, as I wished to see Spencer. 
I did see him daily while I was in St. Louis, 
and it was a great satisfaction to me. I hope you 
saw him. I had not sent you his last letters, 
because I was expecting soon to bring them to you. 
If you called on Mr. Cozzens you heard from Spense 
in St. Louis. I was there nearly a week, and had a 
very pleasant visit. . . . The weather is very 
warm, but windy, as usual. We had a thunder-shower 
this morning not very much rain, however. The gar- 
den looks beautiful, and I hope we shall soon be able 
to get along and make it comfortable for you when you 
come back. I heard there was to be an effort to raise 
a Secession flag in Kansas City, yesterday. . . . 
Will you forward this letter to Utica, when you have 
read it, as I cannot write any more to-day, and they 
will wish to hear from me ? ... Send these flow- 
ers to Grandpa; Lily has just picked them." 

192 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

From Utica, on April 23, 1861, " Kitty " wrote : 

' ' DEAR FATHER : Grandpa received your letter, 
saying that you were in Chicago, a day or two since. 
We think that Mother and Lily must be in Osawat- 
omie by this time but we can only conjecture, as we 
have heard from her but once since she left. She was 
then at St. Louis. She stayed at William Cozzens's 
that is, when he found that she was in the city he came 
to the hotel where she was and insisted upon her ac- 
companying him home. He then went for Spencer, 
who got leave of absence, with some difficulty making 
Mother a call of an hour or two in length. When he 
left, Mother wrote a note to the officer, requesting per- 
mission for him to spend the next day, which was Sun- 
day, with her. 

' ' This was granted, and she thought that the visit 
did him much good the change of diet, society, and 
scenery and it appeared as if he would devour Lily. 
I felt so disappointed that you did not see him at St. 
Louis. I am exceedingly anxious to hear from Mother. 
I cannot imagine what she will do. Grandpa is quite 
distressed about her going, and in these critical times, 
too : but she was so anxious to see the children, and she 
supposed they would remain there. 

" What a mistake that was about Spencer's being 
at Litchfield ! That was Uncle Spencer. Dear child ! 
I only wish it had been so. Grandpa wishes you had 

193 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

stopped to see William Cozzens in St. Louis, even if 
Spencer had not been in that place, for you would have 
enjoyed the visit, he says, as that gentleman has a beau- 
tiful place, and he would have been very glad to see 
you. He took a great fancy to Spencer. There is a 
great state of excitement here about the war. I was 
out, for the first time in several days, this morning, 
with some friends, to see the 'Utica Citizens' Corps,' 
and our brave volunteers who are among the first 
young men in the city some of them mere boys. 
Many companies were in zouave costume, and although 
an imposing and interesting spectacle it was a very 
sad one. . . . 

' ' Your affectionate daughter, 

"K." 

Mr. Brown wrote from Chicago, May 2d : 
" MY DEAR WIFE: I am in receipt of yours from 
Osawatomie of the 22d ultimo. I did hope to see you 
ere you went West, but missed you on the river ; also 
failed to see Spencer, supposing him to be in Utica, 
and having only money enough to bring us here, Fanny 
at half-fare. ... If the war goes on, in the Vol- 
unteer service Spencer might get some promotion, but 
where he is perhaps it is doubtful. As I am so entirely 
in the dark, I am not prepared to act, or judge of what 
is best, and must wait until I hear from you again. 
Here all is bustle and busy preparation for a vigorous 

194 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

and protracted war. The whole nation can now see 
something of the Kansas struggle with Pro-Slavery 
power. This move is looked upon as leading to the 
final overthrow of slavery. ... I cannot say 
when I leave here. May go down to see Spencer, when 
I hear from you. I am pleased that he is now occupy- 
ing so important a position in the defence of the Gov- 
ernment property at St. Louis. I should be quite will- 
ing to have him volunteer if he were not now in the 
service. I am very anxious to hear from him, but don't 
wish to put him in a false position by writing before I 
can learn something of the facts. ... I can see no 
good reason for leaving off his surname, 1 as he is now 
safe from ' Border Ruffian ' violence. Spencer has 
committed no crime, and now is safe, and no longer 
needs to disown a name which is immortalized by the 
heroism of John Brown. ' ' 

Mrs. Brown replied from Osawatomie, on May 9th : 
' ' I received yours of May 2d this morning. I regret 
that you did not see Spencer. You were misled by 
Abigail 's letter, where she mentions Kitty and Spencer 
coming. She meant Ambrose Spencer, who went out 
with Kitty. . . . 

" Spencer seemed sad, and we thought he wished 
to get away. I had written you to go to him, and you 
thought you could not ; so I resolved to go myself, and 

1 He had enlisted as " Spencer Kellogg," dropping the Brown. 

195 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

came away a month earlier, at least, than I should have 
done, to be sure and see him and do what I could for 
him. As for his name, I certainly am not pleased with 
his course about that; but, as he has enlisted as 
Spencer Kellogg, he does not, probably, find a con- 
venient time to make it right. My friends in St. Louis 
understand about it and call him Spencer Brown. 
Spencer has no intimacy or interchange whatever with 
officers, to explain or recommend himself. Mr. Coz- 
zens has acquaintance and influence with them, and 
you can do nothing, very well, except through him. 
You would enjoy his acquaintance much. . . . He 
had the impression that I was Captain Brown 's * wife 
(the only Osawatomie Brown he had any knowledge 
of) until father went there. . . . 

' ' He did not relish the idea of my marrying Cap- 
tain Brown. ... I wrote you a letter from St. 
Louis to Osawatomie, which you did not receive, tell- 
ing you all about Spencer and my visit there. . . . 
He felt very bad about some things. He felt so much 
the want of education, and said that he had neither 
trade nor education. He would have thought best to 
leave there if anything else were in view. I do not 
know about his being a volunteer, but I never was 
pleased with his enlisting. . . . They were very 
much interested in him and about him at Mr. Coz- 
zens's, and would be glad to do anything for him."

IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

Missouri was soon to suffer from war even worse 
things than she had inflicted upon Kansas. The Gov- 
ernor, Jackson, was disloyal to his country, but he and 
his clan were outnumbered in his State by the loyalists. 
In February, at Jefferson City, a convention was held 
in which no " openly avowed disunionist appeared." 
It reassembled at St. Louis, March 4th, when Sterling 
Price, a secret enemy to the United States Government, 
presided. " The loyal men gave the right tone to the 
proceedings, and the Governor, despairing of using 
that body for his treasonable purposes, turned to the 
more disloyal Legislature for aid. The latter yielded 
to his wishes, and, under the inspiration of Daniel M. 
Frost, a native of New York, and a graduate of the 
Military Academy at West Point, they made arrange- 
ments for enrolling the militia of the State and placing 
in the hands of the Governor a strong military force to 
be used against the power of the National Government. 
Arrangements were also made for seizing the National 
Arsenal at St. Louis and holding possession of that 
chief city of the Mississippi Valley. For this purpose, 
and with the pretext of disciplining the militia of that 
district, Frost, commissioned a brigadier-general by 
the Governor, formed a camp near the city. But the 
plan was frustrated by the vigilant loyalists of St. 
Louis and Captain Nathaniel Lyon, of the United 
States Army, commanding the military post there. 

When it became evident that Frost was about to 
!4 197 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

seize the arsenal, Lyon took the summary action of 
which the next letter gives a report. 

" ST. Louis ARSENAL, MISSOURI, May 11, 1861. 

1 ' DEAR CORA : l I just a few minutes since finished 
reading your letter, and have immediately sat down to 
answer it; for you will undoubtedly get the news of 
our raid upon the Secessionists, and hear that men 
are killed; so I will relieve your anxiety as soon as 
possible. 

" The interval between reading your letter and 
commencing this has been employed in cleaning my 
gun, for we have not long been back. 

" I suppose you will learn all about it in the pa- 
pers, but perhaps my account may be interesting. 

"Yesterday (Friday), about 9.30 A.M., we got 
orders from our captain to ' fall in, ' and we then re- 
ceived a close inspection, both of arms and ammuni- 
tion, to see if they were in serviceable order. Mean- 
while the rumour amongst the men was that we were 
to attack the Secessionists gathered in a body at Lin- 
dell's Grove, passing under the name of the regular 
annual State encampment. At 1.30 p. M. we marched 
out at the main gate of the arsenal, Company B, Sec- 
ond Infantry, in the van, an attached recruit company 
following, and our own, the second company G. S. re- 
cruitsall commanded by our own company com- 
1 Usually addressed as " Kitty." 

198 



mander, Captain T. W. Sweeney, second in command 
only to Captain Lyon. A little distance from the gate 
we halted while the volunteers came on with the artil- 
lery, most of which were twelve-pound howitzers, fine 
brass pieces, with the men working them by their side, 
each armed with a sword bayonet. 

" Then came the volunteers, variously estimated 
from three thousand to five thousand men; also an 
artillery company (Fourth Regiment Regulars) and F 
Company, Second Artillery. We had to march six 
miles to reach the grove, in the vicinity of which a 
strong secession feeling became manifest, venting itself 
in frequent insulting remarks, of which, however, the 
volunteers (nearly all Dutch *) received the great por- 
tion. When we were within fair gunshot of the en- 
campment the command was halted (Captain Swee- 
ney's being on the right), and almost immediately the 
volunteer regiments, under the command of Boern- 
steen and Shiitner, surrounded the place from the left. 
But, quickly as the manoeuvre was made, it was not 
complete before Captain Lyon had demanded the sur- 
render of the encampment. There was no chance for 
refusal. The light field-pieces had already been plant- 
ed on three neighbouring heights, on as many different 
sides, loaded with grape and canister, with their round, 
black throats pointing so directly towards the Seces- 
sionists that they could see nothing but the muzzles. 

1 Germans he should have written. 

199 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

The demand to surrender was complied with. A com- 
pany of cavalry rode within pistol-shot of our men, 
sheathed their sabres, turned and rode away. 

"At this time a most unfortunate accident hap- 
pened to Captain Lyon, but happily without fatal con- 
sequences. He had dismounted from his horse for a 
few minutes when a major in one of the volunteer regi- 
ments rode up for some order, and, turning to go, his 
horse kicked the captain full in the stomach. As soon 
as he recovered his breath, he walked to a neighbouring 
booth, supported by a doctor and one of his lieutenants, 
and lay down. Almost immediately after this Captain 
Sweeney gave us the command, and we marched into 
the encampment, surrounded by crowds of citizens who 
were screaming and yelling the most abusive language 
they could invent. We marched through them with 
easy gait and smiling faces, quiet as on parade, for 
the order was most strictly given ' No cheering, ' and 
not a word was allowed to be spoken by those in 
ranks. 

" Not so with the enthusiastic volunteers. Cheer 
after cheer went up from the assembled crowds, each 
intent upon screaming the loudest. So we took posses- 
sion. B Company was immediately, with part of our 
men, posted around the grove. Sentinels from our 
company were placed over the officers' and sutler's 
private property, and the first company recruits were 
marched off with the prisoners, some six or seven hun- 

200

dred, who had previously stacked arms. Part of two 
regiments of volunteers, a few regulars, and a brass 
band guarded our fallen foes back towards the arsenal. 
Meanwhile, those of our company not on duty scattered 
over the camp, into the lower end of which General 
SigePs regiment of volunteers had already entered. 
Along the road back to town could be seen, drawn up, 
the prisoners of war, on each side of which were files 
of volunteers, behind them regulars, and in advance 
the band. 

" We could hear the infuriated mob on each side 
of the road cursing and reviling, at many places trying 
to break the ranks of the prisoners' guards by pressing 
against them; but it was useless, and soon ended at 
the command ' Charge bayonets, ' quickly obeyed. The 
band was playing Yankee Doodle. In a few seconds 
the mob became bolder, pressing still closer, and throw- 
ing sticks and stones taken from the macadamized 
road. But at last one man bolder than the rest fired 
two shots from a pistol into the ranks, and, turning the 
horse upon which he rode, galloped away. Too late ! 
The abused soldiers, like one man, fired into the close- 
pressed mob. Those on the right of the road, as one 
looks down, were by far the greater portion, and break- 
ing through the frail fence of the grove, frightened 
men, boys, and horses ran wildly, at full speed, away 
from the fire of the volunteers. 

' ' Suddenly, the men stationed at the lower end of 
201 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

the grounds opened upon them another fire, and be- 
tween the two, dozens fell. But the last-opened fire 
injured many of General Sigel's command, and per- 
haps killed some. I cannot tell. In three minutes it 
was commenced and ended. As the last shot was fired 
our company had ' fallen in, ' but only to stack arms 
and find quarters for the night. 

" General Frost's fine tent was taken possession of 
by Captain Sweeney, and from all parts of the camp 
were supplied ice-water, wash-water, a table, blankets 
and robes, wash-basin, towels, candles, and lanterns; 
and the captain and myself (his orderly) spent a dry 
night in the tent, notwithstanding the heavy rain out- 
side. In the morning everything was packed inta 
wagons and sent away, with five or six battalions, back 
to the arsenal. We waited until the wagons returned, 
put everything upon them, and moved homeward, ar- 
riving, without any trouble, early in the afternoon. 
There was much spoil with which many of the volun- 
teers loaded themselves, but for myself I only threw 
out two dirty handkerchiefs and took two clean ones ; 
but, the two blankets and a splendid robe I had used 
for my bed being thrown into the wagon and brought 
to the arsenal, the captain said I might keep them. So 
here you have my history of an expedition of which it 
is likely you will see many accounts. . . . Give 
yourself no fear about my desertion. I would never 
take a discharge, even, in a time like this. More an-

other time, my sister Cora. Let my using that name 
tell you my love. Of course you will send this to 
Mother." 

Mr. Brown wrote to Spencer, from Chicago, on the 
22d of May: 

' ' MY DEAR SON : I was in St. Louis, on the 15th 
ult., with Fanny, en route, missing your Mother on the 
river. Your Aunt Mary received a letter informing 
us, we supposed, of your arrival at Litchfield. I am 

very sorry, as I could have seen you, and learned your 


views and desires much better than by letter. . . . 

Five acres in spring wheat I left looking well. Rock- 
well has planted garden, potatoes, carrots, and corn, 

Mr. A doing the ploughing for him. They have 

a cow and calf, two pigs, and fowls. There were no 
late frosts, and fruits look well. Have had plenty of 
rain. Cistern is full. ... I have delayed writing to 
you, as I did not know how to address you, supposing 
you had taken on your full name again. Why longer 
leave off the Brown ? . . . Write me news of your 
captain, etc., etc. . . . Lane went to Kansas to 
raise several regiments of cavalry, under the auspices 
of Government, by State authority. Eleven regiments 
are raised, or to be raised. We read with great inter- 
est Captain Lyon's capture of Frost's band of rebels, 
and feel not a little gratified that my son should be

allowed to participate in so bold and important a move 
for disarming and disbanding State treason. 

" Write me the particulars, and how things look 
to you from that standpoint. The Government is 
making very formidable preparations to put down the 
rebellion. . . . Missouri will be held to her alle- 
giance, and her loyal citizens will be protected. . . . 
Large numbers of volunteers, more than could be re- 
ceived, have been offered. The regulars will fare much 
better than the volunteers, and, if you remain in the 
service, it is far better to be in the regular army in that 
particular. Of your standing truly and faithfully by 
your country's flag in this its hour of greatest peril I 
cannot doubt for a moment ; and that God will protect 
your life and health is my daily prayer. ' ' 

" ST. Louis, MISSOURI, May 27, 1861. 

1 ' DEAR FATHER : I heard from you Saturday, and, 
hearing there was to be a payment to-day, put off 
writing so as to have the means to repay you the debt 
you paid Newman. 

' ' I am well, and prospects are continually bright- 
ening for me. I think enlisting will prove one of the 
most fortunate things that I could have done. I expect 
to call for a furlough in a week or two, which my cap- 
tain (T. W. Sweeney) has signified his willingness to 
give me. Let me here acknowledge the receipt of three 
papers from Chicago, for which I am obliged. 

204 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

' ' I have just returned from the United States Ex- 
press office, where I sent you six dollars, which you can 
get by calling for it. Charges paid. 

" You will hear all about the Camp Jackson ex- 
pedition in the papers, but if you wish my account 
you must apply to Kitty. I have a good situation now, 
company clerk, and mean to hold it, if possible. There 
is not much to do, and very easy times. If I do not 
get a furlough I shall send the balance of my pay to 
Rock, to buy a heifer with at least, I think so now. 
If I get the furlough I am going South, and will prob- 
ably return married to age and money. I contem- 
plated, at first, very seriously, getting a discharge, but, 
on account of the fine prospect offered me to stay, I 
concluded I should only want a furlough. For the 
present, therefore, I shall not trouble about my dis- 
charge, and I have no doubt will eventually spend 
much of my life in the service. Of course my pros- 
pects are something better than those of a common 
soldier, although we are now leading a most particu- 
larly lazy life. 

' ' My friends here are very kind, and seem to find 
it difficult to do enough for me. I can only repay them 
with gratitude. 

" If you wish me to get your answer, it must come 
by return mail, or thereabouts. Please acknowledge 
receipt of package. 

" P. S. Adding the Brown to my name now would

result in considerable inconvenience and some shame : 
so it's no use." 

Spencer's experience in the service seemed to in- 
spire hopefulness. No officer of the old regular army 
will be surprised at this. Before the rebellion the men 
who enlisted as common soldiers were nearly all from 
the refuse of society. 

Exceptional cases, such as Spencer's, were marked, 
and private soldiers of intelligence, in many instances, 
were helped forward by their officers. A prospect of 
advancement of some kind soon opened to them. 

What he meant by the threat to go South and ' ' get 
married to age and money, " I do not know. Probably 
he was jesting. 

On June 14th he wrote to his sister : ' ' Just now 
we are quartered in the city of St. Louis have been 
for nearly a month but we have new business on 
hand, and are under marching orders, expecting to be 
sent to Jefferson City 1 this morning. Governor Jack- 
son, of this State, has called out fifty thousand militia 
to defend the State, 2 and General Lyon has already 
sent several thousand men to attack him. Jackson 
has burned two or three large bridges between here 
and the capital, and, I have no doubt, will give us a 
' spirited reception.' "

IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

Important military changes were taking place in 
Missouri. Captain Lyon's capture of General Frost's 
camp of conspirators was .soon followed by exposure 
of the plans of the Governor and other enemies of the 
National Government, who began openly to range 
themselves in line with the forces of the Southern re- 
bellion. On June 12, 1861, Governor Jackson's call 
for the service of the militia was issued ' ' for the pur- 
pose of repelling invasion." He raised the standard 
of revolt, and appointed General Sterling Price to the 
command of the army he was bringing into the field. 
On the side of the United States, Captain Lyon was 
promoted to be a major-general in command of the 
Department of Missouri. About the middle of June 
he moved to attack the insurgents, who retired as he 
approached Jefferson City. He pursued, and over- 
took and defeated them at Booneville. Lyon held, for 
a time, military control of the most important points 
in the State. This was the beginning of earnest war- 
fare on the part of the Federal Government. Spencer 
was detached part of the time from his company and 
sent on special duty as a scout. He was constantly 
in the saddle, with a number of men under his com- 
mand, and had " a general roving commission," and 
" authority to take the best Government horses, or 
anything else that he needed." He must have been 
in this service when he wrote to his brother the fol- 
lowing letter.

" SPRINGFIELD, GREEN COUNTY, MISSOURI, 
" July 3, 1861. 

' ' DEAR ROCK : Please send me news in Osawat- 
omie, particularly where Montgomery is, and how 
many men he has. Be very careful to send as correct 
news as possible, something that can be relied upon, 
as it will be of great importance to me if correct. 

" Please address me as dear brother, and do not 
speak of Father in your letter. Do not express any 
wonder at what I ask. 

" To set your mind at rest about my safety, I am 
doing well, but can do still better if you can send me 
this information that I ask. If you know where Lane 
is, and how many men he has, it will be useful. Ad- 
dress ' Spencer Kellogg,' Springfield, Green County, 
Missouri, and write, sure, by return mail. 

" Love to Mother. SPENCER." 

That month, while the arms of the nation and its 
enemies were clashing in Kansas and Missouri, " the 
new stone Congregational Church in Osawatomie was 
dedicated, the Rev. Mr. Adair, the pastor, preaching 
the sermon on the occasion, and the Rev. Mr. Copeland 
offering the dedicatory prayer. The communion ser- 
vice was celebrated in the afternoon. ' ' 

Spencer's life soon came to an end; the rebellion 
waxed, waned, and was extinguished. The Congrega- 

208 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

tional Church in Osawatomie still worships in the 
building which was reared and dedicated in the time 
of the people's trial and distress. 

' ' Oh, where are kings and empires now, 

Of old that went and came ? 
But, Lord, thy Church is praying yet, 
A thousand years the same. 

" Unshaken as eternal hills, 
Immovable she stands," 

and shall stand not the outward structure ; not, neces- 
sarily, the same ecclesiastical organization; but the 
everlasting, invincible body of God's believing, pray- 
ing people. 

On July 22d Mrs. Brown wrote from Osawatomie 
to her eldest daughter : ' ' To-day we hear there are 
eight hundred Secessionists at Squiresville, coming on 
to burn Paola and Osawatomie. Mr. Adair told 
Charley and Rock it would do no harm to have some 
bullets ready. . . . We have to expect danger, for 
we are threatened. . . . Poor Spencer ! I tremble 
for him. . . . He is in General Lyon's army, at 
Springfield, Missouri, where they are waiting for ac- 
cessions, to have, I suppose, the greatest battle they 
have had yet. If his life is only spared, let us be 
thankful for that ; but I think he was never before so 
exposed. ' ' 

209 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Spencer began to think he could do better for his 
country and for himself as a commissioned officer. Ac- 
cordingly he wrote about the matter, on July 31, 1861, 
to his father. 

" The time has come at last to apply for my dis- 
charge. . . . Once having my discharge from the 
regular army I could obtain, without much difficulty, 
a commission in one of the companies rising like mush- 
rooms everywhere around, and my drill and experience 
in the regular army would fit me for it. ' ' 

Before Mr. Brown could act upon this letter news 
was received of the battle of Springfield, in which Gen- 
eral Lyon was killed. 

After the battle at Booneville the insurgents re- 
treated through southwestern Missouri towards Ar- 
kansas. A force of federal troops commanded by Col- 
onel Franz Sigel advanced from St. Louis, through 
Eolla, and came upon the main body of the enemy, 
much superior to itself, near Carthage, the county seat 
of Jasper County. After a sharp engagement, Sigel 
fell back to Springfield. There Lyon, with his troops, 
joined him, and took command of the whole force. By 
the end of July the army of Jackson and Price had 
been re-enforced by troops from the South, and is said 
to have numbered about twenty thousand men. Mc- 
Cullough and Rains, of the Confederate Army, were 
among the officers. Lyon had but six thousand troops, 
four hundred of whom were cavalry. Nevertheless he 

210 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

fought McCullough and Bains, at Dug Springs, nine- 
teen miles from Springfield, and defeated them. On 
August 4th he returned to Springfield. . . . On 
the 10th, before dawn, he attacked the combined force 
of the rebels, commanded by McCullough. At nine 

'clock in the morning he was mortally wounded. He 
had won a most enviable reputation for courage and 
military skill. He was succeeded by Major Sturgis. 
Although the Federal Army seemed to be victorious, 
it was withdrawn the next day, by Sigel, to Holla. It 
was not deemed safe to risk another encounter with a 
force numerically so superior, or to attempt to hold the 
field in the face of such a foe. 

When Spencer's friends next heard of him he had 
returned to the banks of the Mississippi. From St. 
Louis he wrote, on August 20th : 

' ' DEAR MOTHER : You have undoubtedly heard of 
our battle at Springfield, . . . and as you knew 

1 was there I supposed you would be anxious to hear 
from me. Immediately after the fight we returned to 
Holla, from which place I was sent on here, by General 
Sweeney, to make out some papers. ... I was not 
in the fight, as I belonged to the commissary depart- 
ment and could not obtain permission from Major 
Mudd, my commanding officer. 

' ' The fight was very severe, and we must have lost 
nearly a thousand men. 

211 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" Since my last I have been seeing much better 
times, have been made an acting sergeant in the com- 
missary department, getting about eight dollars a 
month more than before. But better times are coming 
still, if all works well. I have been promised a cap- 
taincy in a new regiment, and I expect to get my com- 
pany in a few days. 

' ' Inclosed you will find my picture, taken since the 
battle. I have had no opportunity of ' fixing up ' yet. 
Government owes me over forty dollars. I hope to get 
it in a few days; also some new clothes. 

" Give one of the pictures to Aunt Mary. Take 
your choice. 

' ' Tell Rock I would like to hear from him. ' ' 

Spencer had now been in the regular army between 
eight and nine months, and much of that time had been 
passed in garrison, where he had been carefully in- 
structed and drilled in military tactics. He had seen 
service in the field and had taken some part in actual 
warfare. As a scout he had ridden a distance estimated 
at nine hundred miles. In all this experience he had 
so conducted himself as to merit the approval of his 
officers and comrades. On September 16, 1861, Gen- 
eral Fremont gave him an honourable discharge, and 
appointed him first lieutenant to recruit the " Lyon 
Legion " a body of scouts which would be attached 
to the Twelfth Regiment of Missouri Volunteers. 

212 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

To his sister Kitty, Spencer wrote from St. Louis, 
on September 21st, rejoicing in anticipation of in- 
creased pay, and ability to help the loved ones of his 
father's family. 

' ' The war is fairly beginning, ' ' said he. ' ' Lucky 
for me was the apparently untoward circumstance of 
my enlistment in the ' regulars,' for it fits me to fill 
the position I occupy, and, perhaps, for future ad- 
vancement. Ah! your little, unpractical, theoretical 
brother has had many of the sharp, uncompromising 
corners rubbed from him, and is getting, more than 
ever he thought, a man of the world. I am sorry! 
almost ashamed ! When I look back it seems that if I 
had married happily, with the old notions and green- 
ness, and retired to some out-of-the-way town, life had 
been full of much keener enjoyment than can ever 
come to me as worldly as I have got to be. Yet I have 
friends that is, acquaintances now, that I had not 
then, and money, too better, you see, in every worldly 
view ; yet I am sorry for the exchange. 

" And how fares my sister? Is life gliding away 
quietly and happily, or are the rubs frequent ? Please 
tell me, Kitty, when you write, and let me know. I 
should be happy if I could only do something for you. 
Let me make you an offer! After I get my first 
month's salary, how would you like to live with me? 
that is, make your home in St. Louis, and keep house, 
so that your brother, when he was in town, could have 
is 213 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

some one to be proud of. Do you like the notion ? Is 
the salary enough ? I should need seventy-five dollars 
a month, or nearly so much. Would the rest be suffi- 
cient for you? That last looks selfish, but I fear I 
could not get along with less. Let me know. Let me 
hear from you soon. . . ." 

On October 6th, to the same beloved sister, he 
wrote : 

' ' DEAR KITTY : You do not know with what pleas- 
ure I have heard from you at last for I have written 
to you more than once. I get up from reading yours 
and Father's letters to answer immediately. 

' ' How selfish I have been, darling ! I deserve more 
humbling yet. I never knew how poor Father suffered ; 
and, Kitty, much as I love you, I must help him first. 
You will wait will you not, Kitty? and let me do 
what I can for him first. You are young and brave yet, 
and I can help but one at a time. I know how much I 
am asking, Kitty, but do not think it is a loss to you 
only. But I leave it to you. My plan is this : Rock 
must take care of the folks in Kansas." He then 
elaborates a plan for the help of his invalid father, pro- 
posing to bring him to St. Louis, where all attention, 
medical and other, that he might need, could be be- 
stowed upon him while he was ill and without money. 
He goes on to say : ' ' So, at least he can live comfort- 
ably ; and I can willingly make the sacrifice for either 

214 



IN THE ARMY IN TIME OF WAR 

him or you. ... It will be much of a sacrifice, 
for I shall have to go without money in my pocket, and 
live like a common soldier .instead of an officer ; nor do 
I wish him to know, Kitty only you so that you can 
see how it is. 

" Next month, and after, with good fortune, I can 
do for you. ... If you approve of all this, Kitty, 
and like it, send the inclosed letter to Father, and en- 
deavour to get him to consent. Dear, dear Kitty, I 
know how much this will disappoint your bright 
hopes; but can I do differently? 

" I have no money now, Kitty, and am living on 
credit, so I cannot send now, but am hoping before 
Father's answer comes to have it to send. I had an- 
other plan, before you told me of Father, that would 
have given me much pleasure ; but I am fortunate in 
having a pleasing duty. Let me hear from you imme- 
diately on receipt of this. . . . Remember me, 
with love, to the friends. Imagine my arms around 
your own neck. SPENSE. 

" Do not tell Father of anything but the favour- 
able parts of my plan nothing about me." 

Spencer was nineteen years of age when he penned 
that letter. Could anything have been at the same 
time more boyish, more beautiful, more dutiful? 

To his father he sent, inclosed to his sister, the 
following letter. 

215 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" ST. Louis, MISSOURI, October 6, 1861. 

1 ' DEAR FATHER : I was much pleased to hear from 
you at last for I had written and received no answer. 
But let me get through with business. 

' ' I have been very selfish this long time : now let 
me make amends. Let me ask careful attention to my 
plan following, and if you think you can live happily 
and comfortably in the manner I speak of, let nothing 
prevent you from accepting the offer I am about to 
make. Kemember how much you have done for me 
as / remember. Remember, and reflect upon your 
present situation (forgive me for speaking of it), and 
let me do for you what I can, not reluctantly, but with 
joy and love. . . ." 

Here he unfolds his plan, and then proceeds to say : 
" When I look at it, this is very little, dear Father, 
but it is the best I can offer ; and I am happy in being 
able to offer so much. I shall await your answer with 
much impatience. I would like to hear from you im- 
mediately." 

All Spencer's plans were frustrated by the re- 
moval of General Fremont. It became impossible to 
recruit a company of scouts. He therefore either 
threw up his commission or it failed of confirmation. 
After his letters of October 6th his friends knew 
nothing of his movements until, six months later, they 
received tidings of his reappearance in St. Louis.

CHAPTER XXI 

THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER 

THE upper Mississippi, when not roiled by freshets, 
is a clear and placid stream. Not far from its source 
its volume of water becomes considerable. Below the 
Falls of St. Anthony the river has a width of about 
half a mile. After it receives the St. Croix it expands 
into beautiful Lake Pepin, a sheet of water more than 
twenty miles long and from two to four in width. The 
Mississippi in its upper course flows among hills that 
rival in their beauty those of the Ohio River. There 
are many islands in the Mississippi, some of which are 
of considerable size, and some are clothed with trees 
and vegetation of inferior growth so luxuriant as to 
remind one of the banks and islands of rivers in trop- 
ical lands. The shores and sand-bars are frequented 
by countless birds cranes, flamingoes, ducks, geese, 
swans, and other wading and swimming fowl. 

For a great distance above the mouth of the Mis- 
souri River the Mississippi broadens gradually as it 
flows southward, until, at the confluence, it is fully one 
mile and a half wide. After receiving the Missouri 

217 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

the Mississippi changes much, both in colour and in 
depth. It also loses the placid dignity and beauty that 
characterize the upper river ; and its tide, majestic al- 
though turbid, rolls onward troubled in many places 
near the shores by boiling and dangerous eddies and 
whirlpools. Between the confluence with the Missouri 
and the mouth of the Ohio the river has an average 
width of only three-quarters of a mile ; and for the re- 
mainder of its course to the Gulf of Mexico its average 
width is said not to exceed a mile. The influx of all 
its great tributaries only deepens its channel. Four 
hundred miles from its mouth the river has a depth 
of about one hundred and fifty feet. Between New 
Orleans and the Delta, at places far distant from each 
other, a large anchor was dropped three times by a 
vessel descending with the current, and it did not 
reach bottom in any case with less than three hundred 
and sixty feet of cable. 1 I remember to have put into 
one of the mouths of the Mississippi in June, 1865, to 
get a supply of fresh water, which we were able to do 
as soon as we had entered the " Pass." The river re- 
pels the salt water and is fresh until it pours itself into 
the Gulf. The muddy current of the Mississippi is 
said to be distinguishable at sea when the mariner has 
not yet come within sight of land. 

Because of the directness of its flow from north to 
south this river differs from nearly all others in respect

THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER 

of the diverse climates through which it passes, and 
the very numerous and various productions of the 
regions it waters. 

As the warm season advances slowly from south 
to north, unfettering the ice-bound waters and melting 
the snows of the northern part of our land gradually, 
the great river is seldom subject to destructive and 
dangerous floods. Sometimes, however, they do occur, 
inundating vast areas in Louisiana, where the embank- 
ments, called " levees," which commonly protect the 
lowlands along the river, are broken through, in places, 
and great damage to adjacent plantations, the drown- 
ing of horses and cattle, the wrecking of houses, and 
even dreadful loss of human life occasionally result. 
Such a breach of the protecting dyke is called a 
" crevasse." The embankments are made of stiff 
earth and sods, strengthened with cypress logs. They 
are from five to fifteen feet in height and from ten to 
thirty in width. When the river flowing between these 
embankments is full, to the stranger, viewing the scene 
from the deck of a passing steamboat, the prospect of 
rich fields, teeming with luxuriant crops and studded 
with villas and villages full of life and animation, lying 
below the level of the river, is novel and startling to the 
last degree. 1 

Below the mouth of the Ohio the islands in the 
Mississippi have all been numbered, but the numbers 
1 Mitchell's General Geography. 

219 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

have become very irregular, owing to the washing 
away of many islands and the formation of new ones 
by the force of the moving waters. 

The volume of water carried to the sea by the Mis- 
sissippi is immense. 

The courses navigable by steamboats on the Missis- 
sippi, its tributaries and their affluents, were estimated, 
many years ago, at seventeen thousand miles, but are 
really much more; for some of the branches which 
were not then supposed to be navigable have been 
opened to traffic by steamboats. 

To possess the mouths and the control of the Mis- 
sissippi was the great motive for the Louisiana Pur- 
chase, made by the United States in 1803. 

When the Civil War began, in 1861, the people of 
the northern part of the Mississippi Valley (which 
comprises hundreds of valleys) soon felt the incon- 
venience that resulted from the obstruction of the 
navigation of the great river. They believed that the 
Almighty meant the Mississippi to be a lasting and 
effectual protest against any separation of the South 
of the United States from the North; and they were 
resolved never to tolerate any political arrangement 
that would resign the control of any part of the river 
to a foreign power. The proposal to divide the own- 
ership of the Mississippi not only touched the patriotic 
pride of these people, but threatened the arteries of 
their commercial life. They determined that " the 

220 



THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER 

Father of Waters should go unvexed to the sea, ' ' and 
that his whole course should lie within the United 
States. ^ 

The river soon became the scene of extraordinary 
naval and military activity and prowess. 



221 



CHAPTER XXII 

THE WESTERN FLOTILLA 

ON the breaking out of the war in 1861 it was im- 
mediately seen by the Government at Washington, and 
also by the leaders of ' ' The Rebellion, ' ' that the con- 
trol of the Mississippi River by either side would, in 
the end, give to that side victory. 

Before General Fremont had been appointed to the 
command of the Western Department, the Secretary 
of the Navy began to arrange with James B. Eads for 
the construction of gun-boats, which, according to the 
contract proposed, were to draw six feet of water, 
carry thirteen heavy guns each, be plated with iron 
two and a half inches thick, and be capable of a speed 
of nine miles an hour. Notwithstanding this prior 
consideration of the matter, it strangely came to pass 
that " Mr. Eads signed a contract, in August, 1861, 
with Quartermaster-General Meigs, of the Army, to 
construct seven vessels, and to have them ready for 
their crews and armaments in sixty-five days. The en- 
gines that were to drive this, our first iron-clad fleet, 
were yet to be constructed. " The timber for their 
hulls was uncut in the forest." The machinery and 

222 



THE WESTERN FLOTILLA 

the huge rollers that were to make the iron armour were 
not yet in existence. The short time allowed for the 
doing of the work made it necessary to engage, for the 
undertaking, many of the greatest iron-mills and boat- 
building yards in St. Louis, Cincinnati, and Pittsburg. 
Instantly, when this extraordinary contract had 
been entered into, great tirms, and individual " mas- 
ters of industry," were employed, by telegraph, to 
push forward, with tremendous energy, different parts 
of the work. Special agents were despatched in every 
direction ; saw-mills were set to cutting the timber re- 
quired for the construction of the vessels, simulta- 
neously in Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Indiana, 
Ohio, Minnesota, and Missouri; and railroads, steam- 
boats, and barges were engaged for its immediate 
transportation. Nearly all the largest machine-shops 
and foundries in St. Louis, and many smaller ones, 
were at once set to work day and night, and the tele- 
graph lines between St. Louis and Pittsburg and Cin- 
cinnati were occupied frequently for hours together 
in transmitting instructions to similar establishments 
in those cities for the construction of the twenty-one 
steam-engines and the five-and-thirty steam-boilers 
that were to propel the fleet. ' ' Within two weeks not 
less than four thousand men were engaged in the va- 
rious details of its construction. " ' * Neither the sanc- 
tity of the Sabbath nor the darkness of night was per- 
mitted to interrupt " the work. To the workmen on 

223 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

the hulls a handsome bonus in money was promised 
if they should steadfastly keep to their task till the 
work should be completed. " Many thousands of 
dollars were thus gratuitously paid by Mr. Eads. ' ' 

" On the 12th of October, 1861, the first United 
States iron-clad, with her boilers and engines on board, 
was launched at Carondelet, Missouri, in forty-five 
days from the laying of her keel. ' ' * This vessel was 
called the St. Louis, but when the gun-boats were 
transferred from the War Department to the Navy her 
name was changed to De Kalb, ' ' in consequence of the 
fact that there was already a man-of-war known as 
the St. Louis." Ten days later the Carondelet was 
launched, ' ' and then, in rapid succession, the Cincin- 
nati, Louisville, Mound City, Cairo, and Pittsburg. 
The construction of an eighth vessel, larger and more 
powerful, to be called the Benton, was undertaken be- 
fore the hulls of the first seven had fairly assumed 
shape." And so Mr. Eads began and finished, within 
one hundred days, the construction of a powerful flo- 
tilla of eight boats capable of steaming at nine knots 
an hour, " each heavily armoured, fully equipped," 
and ready for their armament in all one hundred and 
seven large guns. " That such work was done is no- 
bler praise than any that can be bestowed in words. ' ' 

There was another vessel not mentioned hitherto. 
With that Spencer's career was to be connected. 
1 Century Magazine for January, 1885. 

224 



THE WESTERN FLOTILLA 

Two sons of Commodore David Porter, ' ' the hero 
of the Pacific " officers of high rank in the United 
States Navy fought in the war for the suppression of 
the Rebellion. William D. Porter was ordered, Sep- 
tember 27, 1861, to take command of one of the gun- 
boats of the " Western flotilla." When this vessel 
was bought by the Government she was a St. Louis 
ferry-boat. Her metamorphosis made her a gun-boat 
of enormous power for resistance or attack. 

" Porter was allowed by Commodore A. A. Foote 
only eighteen days to get her together. Within that 
time he had her off the docks, and in three days more 
she was steaming down the Mississippi River. Of 
course there was still much to be done and no place 
to do it. Porter therefore seized three large coal- 
scows and converted them into a movable navy-yard. 
Of one scow he made a blacksmith's shop and iron- 
working establishment; another was a boat-shed and 
carpenter 's department, while the third became a coal 
depot. When the gun-boat moved up stream she 
towed the scows with her. When she went down 
stream they followed her. Sometimes she went into 
action, fighting at one end while carpenters, calkers, 
blacksmiths, and painters were working at the other. 
The crew was divided into gangs wood-choppers, 
coal-heavers, carpenters, calkers, etc. constituting a 
complete workshop in themselves." 

This gun-boat, in memory of the frigate lost near 
225 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Valparaiso in March, 1813, was named the Essex. She 
was of about five hundred tons burden. She fought, 
at Lucas's Bend, the first naval battle that took place 
on the Mississippi in the Civil War, whipping three 
hostile gun-boats that were on their way to attack 
Cairo, and driving them beneath the protection of the 
rebel batteries at Columbus. At that time her bow 
only was iron-clad, but all hands on board were making 
the boat stronger hour by hour. 

Her armament consisted of three nine-inch Dahl- 
gren shell-guns, one ten-inch Dahlgren shell-gun, two 
fifty-pound rifled Dahlgrens, one large thirty-two 
pounder, and one twenty-four-pound boat-howitzer. 

In due time the Western Flotilla was transferred 
by the Department of War to the Navy Department. 



226 






CHAPTER XXIII 






IN the autumn of 1861 the Confederates' line of 
military defences in Kentucky and Tennessee was al- 
ready drawn. Zollicoffer, strongly posted at the Pass 
of Cumberland Gap, in East Tennessee, held the right 
of the line; Polk held the left, at Columbus, on the 
Mississippi River, in Kentucky; Bowling Green, Fort 
Donelson and Fort Henry were the most important 
points between these extremes. Here, then, were three 
fortified positions, believed by the insurgents to be 
impregnable, -against which the Navy of the United 
States and the Army could co-operate. 

Indeed, a naval force was indispensable, and the 
utility of the gun-boats was soon manifest. 

When General Fremont was removed from com- 
mand of the Western Department there was great dis- 
content among those who had been under him. In 
some places meetings were held by civilians to express 
their indignation. Many of the General's officers 
threatened to resign. 

227 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Although Spencer 's disappointment fairly stunned 
him, he wasted no time in vain regrets. He was to 
have received a captain's commission from Fremont. 
After that general's removal the " Lyon Legion " 
could not be recruited, and Spencer felt himself to be 
without a calling. He enlisted in the Navy as a com- 
mon sailor, and was assigned to the Essex. 

Blake declared, in Cromwell's time, "It is our 
duty to serve our country, no matter into whose hands 
the Government may fall." So believed Spencer 
Kellogg. Still passing under this abridged name, he 
entered the new service. 

He must have believed that the disappointment of 
all his plans and hopes for himself and his parents 
would prove a blow no less severe to them than it had 
been to him. 

For a long time they heard nothing from him. 
At last they read, with poignant suffering and deep 
humiliation, that Spencer Kellogg had deserted, one 
night in January, 1862, from the gun-boat Essex, and 
was believed to have gone over to the enemy. Such 
was the report published, by authority, in the St. 
Louis newspapers. The agony of mind endured by his 
relatives for the next three months may be conceived 
by those who, intensely loyal themselves, were af- 
flicted in that dreadful war by the disloyalty, or re- 
ported treachery, of sons or brothers. 

Their first relief came in the subjoined letter : 
228 






ENLISTMENT IN THE NAVY 

" ST. Louis, April 11, 1862. 

' ' DEAR COUSIN : I have this moment seen Spen- 
cer. Although he had only a moment's time to spend 
with me, he assured me (and of course I have the ut- 
most confidence in his assertion) that he was just on 
his return from a secret expedition to Dixie, 1 and that 
when he left it was understood with his officers that 
he was to be reported as a deserter. 

" I am so rejoiced to learn this fact that I am 
quite too nervous to write ; so I will close by sending 
the kind regards of myself and my family. 
" Yours truly, 

" WM. F. COZZENS." 

This kind note from Mrs. Brown 's cousin was soon 
followed by a few lines from Spencer himself to his 
eldest sister. 

"Si. Louis, MISSOURI, April 12, 1862. 

1 1 DEAR KITTY : Just returning to St. Louis yester- 
day, I found for the first time the anxiety on my 
account, and the reports about me, which I never 
dreamed of your hearing. You see I am very nervous, 
so I will not be prolix. 

" I have been South on scout service, examining 
the rebel fortifications of the Mississippi River for over 
two months, and have just returned and reported, 

i A name for the South the " Seceded States."

with maps and plans, to the Secretary of War, day 
before yesterday. 

" But Kitty, how came you so far to lose confi- 
dence in me as to believe such stories, simply because 
something was unexplained ? I would never have done 
it of you, Kitty, though the whole world spoke against 
you. 

" Address Spencer Kellogg, care of William F. 
Cozzens, firm Cozzens and Hull, St. Louis, Missouri. 

" I await your immediate answer. 

" SPENCER."

CHAPTER XXIV 

SECRET SERVICE 

To Mr. Levi Cozzens, of Utica, New York, Spencer 
wrote this account of his dangerous exploits in the 
South : 

" ST. Louis, MISSOURI, May 6, '62. 

" GRANDFATHER COZZENS. 

' ' DEAR SIR : I received your letter yesterday, and 
hasten to answer it with pleasure. 

" I sent Kitty something of an account of my ex- 
perience in ' Secessia,' but perhaps a more detailed 
one will not be uninteresting. Here goes ! 

" During the last of January there was, you will 
remember, the calm in military and naval movements 
that usually precedes a storm. At that time . . . 
Columbus, then still held by the rebels, was the point 
upon which much anxiety centred from both North and 
South. 

" At the time I speak of I belonged to the gun- 
boat Essex, Porter commander. To say the least, I 
was uneasy, and, after deliberating on the matter, I 
spoke first to a comrade, whom I knew well, and on the 
evening of the 29th of January asked raiimjgion of 

231 




SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

the executive officer, Captain Riley, to have an inter- 
view with Captain Porter. Granted, and I stood at 
the door. ' Come in, young man. Speak quick! ' 

' ' It confused even me somewhat, and I have some 
brass. 

" ' I would like a few words in private,' I said, 
but so confusedly that I had to repeat. Ejecting his 
secretary by some verbal violence he bade me enter 
and sit down. I volunteered my services for an ex- 
ploration of the river batteries at Columbus, meeting 
his approbation of my plans for action, as I unfolded 
them, and retired as much relieved as if I was return- 
ing instead of being on the point of setting out upon 
a dangerous expedition. 

' ' The time allotted for our absence was ten days. 
In my pocket I had a leave of absence for my comrade 
and myself : also a pass through the pickets. The next 
day the tug attending upon the Essex took us up to 
Cairo to make some little preparations, and I had with 
me nearly a hundred dollars, given me for purchases, 
deposits, etc., by the men. At noon, having satisfac- 
torily acquitted all our business, we had a good din- 
ner of fried oysters, etc., and we spent the afternoon 
at billiards, getting back to the boat about dark. So 
far, all good. I had taken a pair of irons with me to 
Cairo, getting them twisted apart, although the work 
was done most awkwardly. 

" In the afternoon Captain Porter had caused a 
232 



SECRET SERVICE 

small skiff that was lying near us to be put in perfect 
order and attached to the stern of the gun-boat, with 
oars handy. I then went up to the purser, depositing 
seven dollars and a half, and keeping three dollars in 
specie, and taking a receipt, which I gave to a friend 
to keep. We also left word with him to wake my com- 
rade and myself at half past two. 

" We woke late, however, but got on an extra 
amount of clothing (for it was extremely cold), and, 
dropping into the skiff, succeeded in making good our 
escape the bell noting three o'clock as we left the 
vessel in the distance. 

" After half an hour, spent with frequent inter- 
ruptions of warming ourselves by some little exercise, 
we succeeded in getting the irons upon my wrists, 
soon to remove them, however, on account of the in- 
tense cold ; nor were they replaced until we were with- 
in sight of Columbus. 

" We searched ourselves carefully for letters and 
papers, destroying, among others, our leave of absence 
and pass, only keeping one for effect. Meanwhile, we 
muffled the oars with handkerchiefs, which were soon 
rendered useless by the water freezing upon them as 
hard as rock. We also, at first, secreted, each, a fine 
saw and file, to cut steel, but afterwards threw them 
over as useless, and, if found, criminating. 

' ' On the passage down the cold told upon us with 
fearful effect, benumbing us in spite of our most se- 

233 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

vere exertions. My comrade, who had been injured in 
one arm, suffered very severely. A little before dawn 
we passed the Grampus (a notorious craft) at anchor 
in the river, unnoticed and without hailing. At last, 
as the dawn was beginning to make things show a lit- 
tle, we passed the town, and finally effected a land- 
ing on the steamer Charm, our repeated hails having 
failed to bring any answer. 

' ' Here, once fairly on board, we succeeded in rais- 
ing somebody, and, telling him we were deserters from 
the North, got him to take us up to the floating bat- 
tery. Here we reported to Captain Guthrie as desert- 
ers, got kind treatment, and I was released from my 
irons. But still the suspicion was very great, and 
Captain Guthrie refused to allow us to leave the ship 
(we did not ask him), while he went up to Major- 
General Polk, then commanding at Columbus, and 
consulted about us. He asked us many questions, 
which we answered in a way that seemed remarkably 
like prevarication to each other. 

" However, after he came back from General 
Folk's we were put aboard the ' Floating Battery/ 
where we spent three days of idleness and anxiety 
under a cheerful countenance. On the fourth of Feb- 
ruary we were sent aboard the Confederate gun-boat 
General Polk, and were immediately sent below and 
put under guard. The day before, Captain Guthrie 
said that as we wanted to join the army he 

234 



SECRET SERVICE 

would send us to Island Number Ten, to Captain 
Gray's company, and so we were finally on the way. 
The gun-boat got under way in about two hours, after 
which we were brought up from the hold and sent for- 
ward among the men. They were very kind, giving 
and offering everything but clothes, of which the de- 
ficiency was everywhere apparent. 

" At noon they made us drink grog with them, 
and gave us a dinner which seemed excellent. Indeed, 
I may say we were in no place so trying during the 
whole trip as to take away our appetites. 

" Meantime we walked about, improving the op- 
portunity for seeing, among other things, the pecu- 
liar construction of the boat, her four rifled Parrott 
guns, mounted on a carriage and slide of Southern in- 
vention, and apparently, by a unanimous verdict of 
two, superior to anything we had seen in the North. 

" After a while we were had up to a very severe 
cross-examination separately; but we had previously 
compared notes, and came through all right. 

" On the way down to Island Number Ten we 
passed a little place on the river shore where we saw a 
severe bite-and-gouge fight. We arrived the same 
evening at Number Ten, but did not leave the boat, 
the men giving us a good bed. 

" The next day the gun-boat steamed down to 
Madrid, giving us a good opportunity to see the fort 
and town ; but we did not try to go ashore. I shouldn 't 

235 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

omit a laughable remark of the second master of the 
gun-boat at the time of our examination of the day be- 
fore. He said we were a couple of sharp-looking 

fellows, just such as they would send on such business ; 
upon which I made laugh, remarking that he compli- 
mented us. 

" We did not stop at Madrid over two hours, and 
on going back to Number Ten we still stayed aboard. 
They used every effort to induce us to ship on their 
gun-boat, but the excuse (if we should be taken by our 
boat we should certainly hang) seemed so plausible 
that they could not insist. After spending the second 
night on the gun-boat, on the sixth of February we 
were finally sent ashore, and hired ourselves very read- 
ily to Captain Gray, of the Engineer Corps, as men of 
all work. Gray immediately set us to work building 
a house, leaving us the first opportunity to speak in 
perfect security and leave when we wished. We 
worked hard that day with the carpenters, and the 
next also on the house. Afterwards we were put 
to work cleaning a sixty-eight-pound gun that had 
just been mounted, which we put in perfect order. 
Later, having charge of the magazine, we moved 
it a couple of miles on a boat, and guarded it 
until we were relieved by soldiers. Then we did 
sailors' work with needle and palm, and all sorts 
of job-work, never hard nor very constant, but 
a little vexatious. I did not know how long this 

236 



SECRET SERVICE 

would last, and begged Trussel, my comrade, to re- 
turn with me ; l but he insisted upon our staying a 
while longer, and we finally agreed to do so. About 
this time Trussel went with Captain Gray to Colum- 
bus, where Gray stayed about four days, and, getting 
drunk, returned without him. Trussel stayed nearly 
a week longer in Columbus, getting complete informa- 
tion in regard to fortifications, guns, and torpedoes, 
and finally returned with an assistant engineer, Mr. 
Pattison, who proved to be our future ' boss.' But a 
rumour had already begun to circulate that Columbus 
was to be evacuated, and he thought he saw evidence 
of this while there, and so refused to return North 
with his information. He was in much better repute 
with the officers than I was, and his facilities for get- 
ting information were large. He demurred to the idea 
of returning until the matter of evacuation was per- 
manently settled ; and he was right. 

" One bright day, while we were at work survey- 
ing, with Mr. Pattison, boat-load after boat-load be- 
gan to come in sight, land, and encamp ; while ammu- 
nition and commissary stores poured in in enormous 
quantities. Of course there was immense waste in 
both. At this time (of the evacuation) there were 
only seven guns mounted at Island Number Ten, and 
if our gun-boats had attacked 'twould have been ' a 
take ' worth having. 

1 The time allotted for their absence was only ten days. 

237 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" Our work now was with Pattison, surveying, 
sometimes on the opposite shore, sometimes on the 
Island, and mostly on the mainland, where we lived. 
I managed to get all the important distances by steal- 
ing a glimpse at a map. We were then waiting impa- 
tiently for Madrid to be taken, to make our escape by 
floating down the river to that place. 

11 Meanwhile our course of life began to improve 
under Pattison, Trussel being flag-man, while I walked 
alongside two lusty negroes who carried the chain, 
noting the distances. At first I was tempted to give 
them inaccurately, but upon reflection acted differ- 
ently, and with success, as the ground was afterward 
rechained and my chaining found correct. 

" On the day of the capture of Madrid we were 
nearly eleven miles from the island, surveying at the 
foot of Reelfoot Lake, to see if there was any passage 
by which Yankee soldiers could enter. Found none, 
but on our return found that Madrid was evacuated 
and the troops at Tiptonville. 

" During the whole of the preceding trip, and for 
some time before, I had suffered with diarrhoea; but 
upon that trip I was feeling pretty well, but my com- 
rade suffered terribly. He being mounted and I afoot 
(because he was not well), Pattison took him on a 
cross survey with a prismatic compass, and sent me 
home, so that I arrived and heard the news first. 

" On arriving at Number Ten, I found a number 
238 



SECRET SERVICE 

of gun-boats (five), transports, and a few mortar- 
vessels, which began to shell the place soon. I could 
easily have escaped that night, but Trussel not being 
there I dared not leave him. On Sunday he returned, 
but altered much, suffering fearfully with his com- 
plaint, and almost unable to move. So I did nothing 
else but take care of him and watch our shells as they 
exploded all around. I went out frequently upon the 
bank of the river for that purpose, and must say they 
were of but little account there. 

' ' During Sunday night I made every arrangement 
for escape and return, but was again obliged to defer 
the attempt, as I dared not leave my comrade, although 
he begged me to do so. On Monday morning, while 
about to prepare some tea for him, being outside the 
house, I was suddenly arrested by an Irish lieutenant 
of the Sappers, and strictly kept from giving Trussel * 
the least hint of what had happened, or sending for 
my clothes, or even sending the medicine to my com- 
rade. 

" Being taken before the commanding officer, Gen- 
eral Me (I forget his name 2 ), and informed upon

spy, and about to give information to the enemy ' I 
was by him immediately put in charge of Colonel 
Scott, Twelfth Louisiana Volunteers, who moved soon 
afterwards to Tiptonville. Marching, one of the men 
being overloaded I helped him carry his ' traps,' 
gaining thereby much goodwill and a pair of blankets 
to sleep under for the rest of the time that I was under 
guard. At Tiptonville we camped in the mud, where 
I sat all day under guard upon two rails, and slept 
about half of the night upon four rails. 

" Although five miles distant the mortar-shells 
could be distinctly seen bursting in the air all through 
the day. 

' ' About midnight the regiment moved, taking me 
with them aboard a boat that soon afterward started 
for Fort Pillow. 

" Here I stood all night under guard before the 
furnace door, trying to warm myself but freezing all 
the time. I was neglected in the morning, and did 
not get any breakfast until, meeting one of the officers, 
I gave him a good blowing up, and got him to send 
the Colonel (Scott) to me. I asked him if he had or- 
ders to starve me, and he, repenting, took me upstairs 
and gave me a good breakfast. Immediately after, 
feeling better, I began to use my eyes, taking a good 
and comprehensive view of the fort, breastworks, cali- 
bre of the guns, etc. I was taken up the hill and placed 
upon the side of a bank, upon which a little grass had 

240 



SECRET SERVICE 

begun to grow (March 18th), and, the sun being 
pleasantly warm, slept nearly all day. I got a bite of 
dinner from some of the men, the officers neglecting me 
altogether until night, when one of them gave me some 
supper after dark, and I went to sleep on a borrowed 
blanket. It commenced raining soon, and with ex- 
treme difficulty I got the guard to take me under the 
shelter of the porch of the commissary store-house near 
by. Once there, I slept like a top. 

' ' I must not forget to mention that having an in- 
sult from one of the regiment the day before, I told 
him he would not dare give it if I had not been a pris- 
oner, upon which I challenged him to fight with either 
sword or bayonet which the guard would not allow ; 

whereupon the fellow threatened to give me as 

soon as I was released. I know something about a 
bayonet, and during the two months previous to my 
undertaking the trip I had nearly three hours a day of 
practice with cutlass and small sword. 

" The next day a guard-tent was assigned, under 
which a little incident occurred. I was lying on the 
blanket under the tent when a sergeant of the regiment 
(Twelfth Louisiana Volunteers), Dan Hickman, came 
up pretty ' tight,' but in a good-natured way, with a 
full canteen of whisky by his side. 

" Coming into the tent in spite of all the guard 
could do, he sat down by my side, and in a drunken, 
affectionate manner, began to brush my hair back. 

241 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

' You're a pretty good-1'king fel'r. What's yo* 
name? ' ' Kellogg,' said I, ' Spencer Kellogg, all the 
world over, and in the Southern Confederacy to boot. ' 
' Well, Kellogg,' he said, still fumbling round my 
head, ' they say y'r a spy, but I reck'n it's all right. 

You've got a good for'ed, 'n' a fine open count- 

'nance (hie).' Suddenly, ' Will y'r have a drink? ' 
You ought to have seen the air of eagerness with which 
I seized that canteen, and the length of time I gurgled 
at it. He went out soon, being alarmed for the safety 
of its contents ; but he afterwards proved friendly to 
me. 

' ' It was not the only whisky-drinking that I did in 
the South. While going down the river to Island Num- 
ber Ten I drank grog every day on the gun-boat Gen- 
eral Polk, and when at the Island frequently went 
aboard to promote good fellowship by drinking with 
the sailors. 

" One day the one after Madrid was evacuated 
while going back to Number Ten from a surveying ex- 
pedition at Reelfoot Lake, the General Polk was lying 
at Tiptonville (Obionville), and I went aboard, being 
invited by the sailors. While on board, grog being 
offered me, I was about to take the ' tot ' when the ex- 
ecutive officer, from the deck above, a man of gold but- 
tons and blue broadcloth (brass-mounted, the sailors 
call it) , called out : 

" ' Who gave you permission to drink that grog? ' 
242 



SECRET SERVICE 

" ' No one gave me permission,' I replied; ' the 
men asked me to drink.' 

" ' We don't give away. grog on this ship,' said he, 
with a tartaric-acid aspect but a moment after I set 
down the cup he said, ' You have permission to drink. ' 
I replied that I did not wish it, upon which he told me, 
sharply, that I might leave that ship which I did. It 
made me bitter, but when I told Trussel he laughed. 

" At Fort Pillow I remained under guard two 
weeks to a day, receiving, in the main, most kind treat- 
ment, winning the confidence in my innocence of most 
of the officers and men, teaching the officers sword 
practice and the men bayonet exercise, and playing 
many a game of whist and ball. The weather was fine, 
and I enjoyed myself famously, without any appre- 
hensions for the future. Finally I induced an officer 
(he made me promise to join his company) to speak 
to General Villipique, then commanding at the place, 
in my favour. He immediately sent for me, asking 
only a few questions, what I was going to do, etc., and 
upon my statement that I was going to Corinth to en- 
list, he released me, and before I left, gave me a pass, 
transportation, and five days' provisions. I did not 
leave for three days, during which time I assure you 
I saw all there was to see about Fort Pillow. 

" Started for Corinth, via Memphis, landing at the 
latter place next day in the morning. Got my pass 
' vised ' at the provost marshal's office, and, seeing 

243 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Memphis industriously until five o'clock p. M., started 
for Corinth. General Trudeau and his aide were in 
the cars, and, securing a seat near them, I obtained 
much valuable information from their conversation. 
Spent the night at Grand Junction. The next day, 
when about to leave, found a man belonging to the 
First Louisiana Cavalry Volunteers, who, much to his 
own satisfaction, picked me up as a recruit to his com- 
pany. He was at all the expense upon our arrival at 
Corinth, where I stayed that day and night, leaving 
the next day for luka, twenty-five miles farther on, 
where his regiment was expected that night. I arrived 
at luka, and his regiment came in during the evening, 
upon which I domiciled myself with his company (be- 
ing acceptable, as it was small) , but would not be sworn 
in until he gave me the bounty-money, fifty dollars, 
which not being on hand, I commenced serving with- 
out being sworn in at all. Managed to pass the night 
in a semi-freezing condition near a small fire, and in 
the morning sponged some breakfast off one of the 
messes. 

' ' The sound of the fight at Pittsburg Landing * 

1 " Shiloh," the Confederates called this battle. The Federal 
troops, coming to the field from the river through a hamlet of that 
name, called it the "Battle of Pittsburg Landing." This was one 
of the great battles of the year 1862. Beauregard reported his loss 
at 1,728 killed, 8,012 wounded, 957 missing 10,697 in all. Grant 
reported 1,735 killed, 7,882 wounded, 3,956 prisoners a total loss 
of 13,573. Later statements showed that on each side the loss was 
about 15,000. 

244 



SECRET SERVICE 

began to reach our ears early in the morning, and con- 
tinued with but little interruption during the entire 
day. About eleven o 'clock A. M. all the available men 
in the regiment were ordered to be reported for ser- 
vice, and after some trouble I managed to get my 
name among them, getting an old double-barrelled 
shot-gun and ten rounds of cartridges for arms, and 
an ambitious but extremely emaciated horse to ride 
one that was never out of a perpetual jiggle. We left 
camp soon after for the Tennessee River, passing 
many pretty houses, from which came ladies of va- 
rious degrees of comeliness, wearing innumerable 
white and bandana handkerchiefs. From luka the 
Tennessee is distant nearly eight miles, but it was over 
mountains for a good part of the way, and the weather 
was intensely warm. The sound of the battle in prog- 
ress, raging with a continual roar, caused anxiety to 
us all ; but to me of a peculiar kind. I expected every 
moment to be brought into a fight against my friends, 
and you may imagine it caused me trouble. 

" However, we rode quietly along on a jog-trot, 
sweltering in the heat of the sun and in clouds of dust, 
until the road came at last to run along the side of a 
beautiful valley, in the midst of which flowed a bab- 
bling rivulet, which we crossed repeatedly in our 
course onward. Few knew where they were destined, 
yet jokes were current, and merriment and good-hu- 
mour pervaded all. When we were within about a 
17 245 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

mile of the river a halt was ordered ( I wished fervent- 
ly that it might be to camp ) , and the colonel and a de- 
tachment went forward to reconnoitre. From the re- 
sult a retrograde movement was ordered, and we began 
to retrace our line of march, leaving pickets at favour- 
able places, and at last, striking a cross-road, moved 
down the river towards the scene of action. It had got 
to be quite dark by this time, and the roar of the small- 
er cannon had ceased, but occasionally there came, 
wafted on the breeze, a sullen boom which I knew full 
well to be the guns of our boats. Still we travelled on 
by moonlight until hardier men than I, overcome by 
weariness, slept in their saddles ; while I, whose every 
nerve seemed pounded to a jelly, and whose eyelids 
seemed glued fast, was only kept awake by the hope of 
escape. 

" Meanwhile, in the distance it began to storm 
dreadfully, and every moment the sky grew darker 
above us, while still we followed the downward course 
of the river, until at last, long after midnight, we 
camped in some cow-lot; when, getting a few ears of 
corn and a little water for my jaded but still ambitious 
horse, I lay down on my blanket, without any meal 
since morning, and fell quietly and quickly into a 
sound sleep. In the morning, by questioning some 
boys, the sons of the owner of the aforesaid cow- 
lot, I found that the Tennessee Eiver was about one 



246 



SECRET SERVICE 

and a half miles distant, and I made up my mind to 
cross it and ' break ' for ' home. ' 

" So, going back to camp, I fed and watered my 
horse carefully, and, inquiring, found that no camp 
guard had been posted. Leaving my coat hanging on 
the fence, I strolled off naturally into the brush, but, 
once out of sight of the camp, I quickened my step, 
and in about fifteen minutes made the Tennessee 
River. 

" 'Twas the first time I had ever seen it, and I 
gazed a moment with a natural curiosity ; but that did 
not last long; everything was now at stake, and, al- 
though in a streaming perspiration with my rapid 
walk, I went to the water's edge, and, tearing off my 
shoes, trousers, and over-shirt, plunged in. The inten- 
sity of the cold nearly took away my breath, but I 
soon found I could not succeed in that manner, and I 
returned to the shore. This time I stripped complete- 
ly naked, with the exception of my cap (a ' Secesh ' 
cap, from Fort Pillow), and, after some trouble and 
much cold, made an island in the middle of the river. 
Here, after a long search, I found an old, split dug- 
out, 1 which carried me, up to my hips in water, across, 
about a mile below. Once out, you ought to have seen 
me travel ! After about two miles I saw a man plough- 
ing. He was terribly scared; thought I was a wild

SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

man, but managed, in a trembling voice, to give me 
some false information. Travelling about five miles 
farther, I met a man who gave me some wretched 
clothes and a piece of bread and bacon, the first mouth- 
ful since the breakfast of the morning before. During 
the walk of the next three miles, which was over a rocky 
road, my feet were terribly lacerated by flints, and I 
bled from many scratches on my legs. At last, how- 
ever, I found a Union man, 1 who put me upon his 
mule and took me thirteen miles farther on to Savan- 
nah, where, among Union soldiers, I was at last 
' home. ' I sought General Grant 's headquarters, and 
immediately reported myself only to be immediately 
put under guard. The battle was still raging, and the 
result was plainly against us. Almost every house in 
town was filled with wounded men, while hundreds lay 
upon the ground, and others were arriving constantly. 

11 I was taken, soon after, up the river to Pitts- 
burg Landing, and stood in the rain shivering about 
two hours; then, at last, was taken before General 
Grant. My reception was good. 

" My story is finished. SPENCER." 

From Mr. 0. C. Brown I learned that his son had

and that not the least useful of his services was his 
taking to General Grant's headquarters, on the morn- 
ing of the second day of the battle of Pittsburg Land- 
ing, assurance that no re-enforcement of the Confeder- 
ate force engaged in the battle was possible. As Spen- 
cer had been in the rear of that army for days, closely 
observing all that could be seen, and had listened to 
conversations that revealed much more, his positive 
testimony was of great importance. With renewed 
confidence and energy Grant continued the fight and 
achieved victory. 

Mr. Brown also mentioned that Spencer had en- 
tered General Pillow's guarded tent and taken from 
his trunk plans, instructions, etc., and forwarded 
them 1 to Captain Porter long before his own return 
in April. 

I was assured on the same authority that, although 
Spencer was charged by the rebels with being a de- 
serter, the boy never had allowed himself to be mus- 
tered into the Confederate service, having been ad- 
monished by Porter to avoid, by all means, such a 
snare ; and that when officers of the United States Navy 
discussed the question whether Spencer could safely 
enter the gun-boat service again, they decided that if 
he should be captured he could be treated only as a 
prisoner of war. 

1 Probably by negro messengers, who were almost invariably 
trustworthy.

CHAPTER XXV 

FORT HENRY 

WHILE Spencer was absent on his perilous under- 
taking the gun-boats were not idle. On the morning 
of February 2 Flag-Officer Foote set out from Cairo 
with four armoured vessels, the Essex, Captain Will- 
iam D. Porter; the Cincinnati, Commander Stemble; 
the Carondelet, Commander Walke, and the St. Louis, 
Lieutenant-Commander Paulding; and three wooden 
gun-boats, the Tyler, the Lexington, and the Conesto- 
ga. That evening the fleet reached the Tennessee 
River. On February 4th it anchored six miles 
below Fort Henry, which was situated on the east- 
ern bank of that river, a short distance south of 
the boundary between Kentucky and Tennessee. On 
the 5th, " Flag-Officer Foote inspected officers and 
crew at quarters, addressed them, and offered prayer. 
On the 6th, at 11.35 o'clock, the armoured vessels 
formed in line, the Essex on the right, and moved up 
the river, until, about noon, they suddenly caught view 
of the fort and the Confederate flag, the barracks, the 
new earthworks, and the great guns, well manned. 
The flag-steamer, the Cincinnati, fired the first shot as 

250 



FORT HENRY 

the signal for the others to begin. The fort responded 
from eleven heavy guns, and was ablaze with the flame 
of cannon. 

" The wild whistle of rifled shells was heard on 
every * side. ' ' Rear- Admiral Henry Walke has given 
a most interesting narrative of this battle. Of the 
part taken in it by Porter 's vessel he says : 

' ' After nearly an hour 's hard fighting the captain 
of the Essex, going below, addressed the officers and 
crew, complimented the first division for their splen- 
did execution, and asked them if they did not want to 
rest and give three cheers, which were given with a 
will. But the feelings of joy and the bright antici- 
pations of victory on board the Essex were suddenly 
changed by a terrible calamity, which I cannot better 
describe than by quoting from a letter from James 
Laning, second master of the Essex. He says: ' A 
shot from the enemy pierced the casemate just above 
the port-hole on the port side, then through the middle 
boiler, killing, in its flight, Acting Master's Mate S. B. 
Brittain, Jr., and opening a chasm for the escape of 
the scalding steam and water.' 

' ' ' The scene which followed was almost indescrib- 
able. The writer, who had gone aft, in obedience to 
orders, only a few moments before (and was thus prov- 
identially saved), was met by Fourth Master Walker, 
followed by a crowd of men rushing aft. Walker

251 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

called to me to go back; that a shot from the enemy 
had carried away the steam-pipe. I at once ran to the 
stern of the vessel, and, looking out of the stern port, 
saw a number of our brave fellows struggling in the 
water. The steam and hot water in the forward gun- 
deck had driven all who were able to get out of the 
ports overboard except a few who were fortunate 
enough to cling to the casemate outside. When the ex- 
plosion took place Captain Porter was standing di- 
rectly in front of the boilers, with his aide, Mr. Brit- 
tain, at his side. He at once rushed for the port-hole 
on the starboard side and threw himself out, expecting 
to go into the river. A seaman, John Walker, seeing 
his danger, caught him around the waist, and support- 
ing him with one hand, clung to the vessel with the 
other, until, with the assistance of another seaman 
who came to the rescue, he succeeded in getting the 
captain upon a narrow-guard or projection which ran 
around the vessel, and thus enabled him to make his 
way outside to the after port, where I met him. 

" ' Upon my speaking to him, he told me he was 
badly hurt, and that I must hunt for Mr. Riley, the 
first master, and if he was disabled I must take com- 
mand of the vessel and man the battery again. Mr. 
Riley was unharmed and already in the discharge of 
his duty as Captain Porter 's successor. In a very few 
minutes after the explosion our gallant ship (which, 
in the language of Flag-Officer Foote, had fought most 

252 



FORT HENRY 

effectively through two-thirds of the engagement), 
was drifting slowly away from the scene of action, 
her commander badly wounded, a number of her offi- 
cers and crew dead at their posts, while many others 
were writhing in their last agony. As soon as the 
scalding steam would admit, the forward gun-deck was 
explored. The pilots, who were both in the pilot-house, 
were scalded to death. Marshall Ford, who was steer- 
ing when the explosion took place, was found at his 
post at the wheel, standing erect, his left hand holding 
the spoke and his right hand grasping the signal bell- 
rope. A seaman named James Coffey, who was shot- 
man to No. 2 gun, was on his knees in the act of taking 
a shell from the box to be passed to the loader. The 
escaping steam and hot water had struck him square 
in the face, and he met death in that position. When 
I told Captain Porter that we were victorious, he im- 
mediately rallied, and, raising himself on his elbow, 
called for three cheers, and gave two himself, falling 
exhausted on the mattress in his effort to give the 
third. 

" ' A seaman named Jasper P. Breas, who was 
badly scalded, sprang to his feet, exclaiming, " Sur- 
rendered ! I must see that with my own eyes before I 
die." Before any one could interfere he clambered 
up two short flights of stairs to the spar deck. He 
shouted ' ' Glory to God ! ' ' and sank exhausted on the 
deck. Poor Jasper died that night. ' 

253 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" The Essex, before the accident, had fired seventy 
shots from her two nine-inch guns. A powder-boy, 
Job Phillips, fourteen years of age, coolly marked 
down upon the casemate every shot his gun had fired, 
and his account was confirmed by the gunner in the 
magazine. The loss of the vessel in killed, wounded, 
and missing was thirty-two." 

The injuries the Essex received were such that she 
was obliged to return to Cairo and St. Louis for re- 
pairs.

CHAPTER XXVI 

CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES 

SOON after Spencer 's return to St. Louis his moth- 
er received the letter given below : 

" BELLEVILLE, May 9, 1862. 

1 ' MY DEAR WIFE : I wrote you some days since in 
reply to yours of the 18th of April. Since then Kitty 
has received a letter from Spencer, of which I send a 
copy. 

" ' DEAR SISTER: I received your welcome letter 
and photograph a few days since. You cannot tell 
how pleased I was to hear from you. I have not 
heard a word from you all for so long a time. When 
I wrote you that last short note I was so tired and 
nervous that I could scarcely hold a pen. Nor, Kitty, 
shall I write you a long letter now, as my prospects 
are not settled yet, though very promising. I have only 
received fourteen dollars since last September, al- 
though constantly in the most difficult and dangerous 
service. . . .

lasting from the last of January to the 8th of April ? 
Where was I ? First in Columbus, before it was evac-

uated ; next, Island Number Ten, before it was taken, 
and during the first three days' bombardment; next, 
two weeks under guard at Fort Pillow, before which 
our gun-boats and mortars are now stopped; after- 
wards three days at liberty in same place ; then, ob- 
taining a pass and transportation to Corinth, by way 
of Memphis, from the rebel general Villipique on 
the 4th of April I was in Memphis, on the 5th and 6th 
at Grand Junction and Corinth; on the 7th, 1 having 
joined the First Louisiana Cavalry, Colonel Scott, I 
rode about thirty-five miles on a rebel scouting party, 
starting in the morning, and camping at night, about 
twelve o'clock, within a mile and a half of the Ten- 
nessee River ; and the next morning, getting up early 
and feeding my horse, I started for the river in 
my shirt-sleeves, and swam it, leaving all my clothes 
but my Secesh cap, and forcing myself to walk naked 
five miles before I came into a friendly country, when 
I got some slight clothing and a friend to take me to 
Savannah, thirteen miles farther. 

' ' ' So, you see, the first day of the celebrated battle 
of Pittsburg Landing I was in ' Secessia,' the second 
day, at home again but in such a condition! The 
bottoms of my feet were all stone bruises, my legs 
above my knees were torn by thorns and poisoned by 
noxious weeds, and I was a subject for care generally. 
Imagine, then, my feelings, upon having reported at

possible trousers and shirt,. charged with being a ' Se-

hours, shivering with cold and nearly famished with 
hunger, tardy justice came, and I was conducted to 
General Grant. You see I had had but one meal since 
the day before in the morning lacking, you see, five 
meals in two days, which was considerable under the 
circumstances. Fortunately things changed here, for 
my information was important, and sleeping in a 
warm bed for the first night in so long a time, as well 
as the possession of an awkwardly large but warm suit 
of clothes, made me regard the past as a dream. Wait, 
Kitty ! Wait, all ! My future looks bright ! But I will 
not anticipate. For reasons which I shall give you I 
will not carry out my original intentions of going to see 
you on a furlough. Wait, I ask (resting sure once 
more of your love), and never again (you, Kitty, I 
am talking to), never again doubt your brother.

at all. 

" I have been just a wee bit sick, and yesterday, 
Sunday, I went up to Uncle 's and got out his big buf- 
falo robe and lay on the grass all day. 'Twas a fortu- 
nate thing I had somewhere to go to, as I should not 
have got better very fast without a little care. I owe 
them gratitude. . . . 

' ' I drew one hundred and fifty-eight dollars. Per- 
haps a list of what I bought would amuse you. Uni-

ty-one dollars and sixty cents ; two caps, seven dollars 
and fifty cents ; fine wool shirts, eleven dollars ; hand- 
kerchiefs, one dollar and twenty-five cents; socks, 
seventy-five cents; writing-school, five dollars (bad 
investment). There was considerably more trunks, 
neckties, pocket-knife, etc., besides board-bill. 

' ' You ask what I do. I get up at eight ; eat break- 
fast ; go to the post-office ; go to my captain with the 
mail (office hours from 9 A. M. to 3 P. M.) ; do all his 
writing, etc. ; spend the rest of the day sometimes by 
going up to Uncle 's, sometimes otherwise. 

" In the evening go to see the young lady. I've 
got such a good one, Kitty go to see her about four 
nights in the seven ; or to the theatre or varieties con-

sipated,' for I don't go to houses of bad repute, or 
drink anything stronger than Catawba wine. My dis- 
sipation consists of eating oysters and ice-creams, go- 
ing to the theatre, and late hours. 

" Your giving the money to Father was at your 
own discretion, Kitty. I certainly could not blame 
you for it. But the next that I send you you must 
keep. 

' ' So, you see I have given you a real picture of my 
life, Kitty, without any reservations. Don 't think less 
of me for it. I was afraid when I came home again you 
would be horrified ; so I tell you now. I think it only 
needs better company to make me better. My time is 
almost all leisure. I am captain's aide, or clerk, with 
the rank of master's mate very different from mas- 
ters' mates in general, and I have precious little 
to do.

" Mother passed through town last week, and, if 
not already there, will soon be with you. Since she 
was here (during which time I enjoyed her company 
much) I have had some good news, and hasten to com- 
municate it to you. I heard from my Fremont papers 
(which have been in the hands of the lawyers for some 
time) yesterday, receiving a semi-decision upon them 
a favourable one from the Adjutant-General at 
Washington, and also here. They are, however, re- 
ferred to some commissioners who are expected here 
soon, and you shall know more anon. 

' ' Day before yesterday I received promotion, from 
my captain, to the position of Fourth Master of the 
Essex, which doubles my salary and gives me more 
to do.

and, from all appearances, the positions of the kind 
are probably good for several years.

to take the support of Fred x upon myself, and have 
devoted ten dollars a month for the purpose, giving

own special benefit. It was taken immediately after 
my return to this city, when I wore borrowed clothes 
and spent my time in resting. I owe much comfort 
and care, since my return, to a young girl here, who, 
I believe, would just suit you. I talk about getting 
married don't know yet, but we are having quite a 
flirtation. 

" Give Grandpa my regards, and tell him to expect

Before Spencer's departure from St. Louis he and 
Miss Mary Manahan, the young woman mentioned to 
his father in the letter of June 12th, were married.

Spencer bade his wife farewell, to see her no more on 
earth. The voyage he was about to begin in the Essex 
was to bear him within hearing of the subdued and 
solemn murmur of those billows to which the soul gives

tude the pulsations of the deep of eternity.

CHAPTER XXVII 

THE NEW ESSEX 

ON the 5th day of July the Essex received orders 
to join the fleet of Flag-Officer Davis, above Vicksburg. 
The gun-boat had been made over. In form and power 
she was new. When she fought at Fort Henry she was 
only partially iron-clad. 

Captain Porter was with the Essex at St. Louis. 
He was blind, from the effects of the escapement of 
steam when the thirty-two-pound shot from Fort 
Henry pierced one of the boat's boilers. Nevertheless, 
he remained on board while she was reconstructed. 
He wished to direct her preparation for combats more 
terrible than any in which she had yet taken part. Her 
executive officer, First Master R. K. Riley, carried out 
Porter's plans, and energetically pushed the repairs to 
completion. The vessel was lengthened forty feet, her 
boilers and machinery were placed below the water- 
line, and her casemates were raised eleven feet, to a 
height of seventeen feet six inches. Her forward case- 
mate was of wood thirty inches thick, plated with In- 
dia-rubber an inch thick, and clad with iron one inch 
and three-fourths in thickness. The side casemates 

264 



THE NEW ESSEX 

were not quite so strong. The roof was bomb-proof. 
The pilot-house was of wood eighteen inches thick, pro- 
tected by India-rubber and iron as thick as the plating 
of the forward casemate. She had false sides, such 
that no steam-ram could attack her successfully, and 
forty-two water-tight compartments were supposed to 
make it impossible to sink her. Her length was two 
hundred and five feet, her width sixty. 

Her officers and crew, all told, comprised one hun- 
dred and forty-six persons. Her commander was Cap- 
tain William D. Porter. Robert K. Riley was first 
master and executive officer, and D. P. Rosenmiller, J. 
Harry Wyatt, Matt. Snyder, and Spencer Kellogg 
were the acting masters. The other officers were 
Joseph H. Lewis, paymaster; Thomas Rice, surgeon; 
Joseph Heep, chief engineer ; J. Sterns, first assistant 
engineer; J. Wetzell, second assistant engineer; 
Thomas Fletcher, third assistant engineer ; and C. W. 
Long was gunner. 

A few days before Spencer's departure on the voy- 
age down the Mississippi he wrote the letter given 
below : 

"Si. Louis, MISSOURI, July 2, 1862. 

' ' DEAR MOTHER : I send you monthly instalment 
of ten dollars for Fred, of which you will please ac- 
knowledge receipt as soon as convenient. You will 
please send me an account of everything bought for 
him, and the prices, as well as board, etc., so that I 

265 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

may see what becomes of the money. Upon receiving 
a new instalment, if any of the old should be on hand 
you are to devote that to the use of the family. . . . 
I do not wish him stinted in what boys of his age should 
have, nor do I wish him to live better than the rest of 
the family. Please keep the account, and send it to 
me monthly. I shall expect last month's account. 

" Please tell Father I have received a letter from 
him. 

" Why does not Kitty write* 

" I send you a newspaper with an account of the 
trial-trip of the Essex." 



266 



CHAPTER XXVIII 

NAVAL OPERATIONS ON THE MISSISSIPPI 

THE course of military and naval operations in the 
West, while the Essex was undergoing repairs at St. 
Louis, was rapid and important. 

Fort Henry, with its armament, was taken on the 
6th of February. This victory proved the efficiency 
of the gun-boats, gave a formidable post of the Con- 
federate military line into the possession of the United 
States, and allowed national troops to establish them- 
selves in force in the rear of Columbus. On the 12th 
of February, McClernand's and Smith's divisions of 
Grant's army invested Fort Donelson, a strongly forti- 
fied Confederate position on the Cumberland Eiver, 
among the hills of Stewart County, Tennessee. If this 
could be captured, the left centre of the insurgents' 
military line west of the Cumberland Mountains would 
be completely broken. On the 13th of February, that 
part of the Federal force which had reached the scene 
of action was repulsed. On the 14th, Foote's flotilla 
of gun-boats and Wallace '& division of the army came 
up, and on the afternoon of that day the gun-boats 
fought the batteries of the fort. Seventeen heavy guns 

267 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

were trained upon the little squadron, " those from 
the hillsides, on which the main works of the fort lay, 
hurling plunging shot with awful precision and 
effect." From the boats, only twelve guns could re- 
ply. The vessels were much injured, and after a very 
gallant fight were obliged to withdraw. On the 15th a 
great battle was fought between Grant's army and 
the garrison of the fort. In the forenoon the ad- 
vantage was with the enemy, which seemed likely to 
cut a way of escape through the right of our army; 
but in the afternoon, in a fight in which General Lew 
Wallace * distinguished himself, the rebels were de- 
cisively defeated by Grant and driven into their works. 
On February 16th, Floyd, 2 who was in command of 
the fort, and Pillow, the next in authority, shame- 
fully deserted their post and fled away before day- 
light. The gallant General Buckner, third in rank, 
surrendered the fort to General Grant. There were 
delivered into the hands of the victors thirteen thou- 
sand five hundred men, three thousand horses, forty- 
eight field-pieces, seventeen heavy guns, twenty thou- 
sand muskets, and a great quantity of military stores. 
The fall of Fort Donelson made necessary the evac- 
uation by the Confederates of Bowling Green and 
Columbus, and gave into the hands of the National 
Government complete control of Kentucky, Missouri,

and northern Tennessee. Federal troops occupied 
Nashville on the 26th of February. A scouting party 
of Illinois troops went to Columbus on March 3d, 
found it had been evacuated by Polk, and raised the 
United States flag over the abandoned works. The 
next day Foote's flotilla, and some transports which 
bore General W. T. Sherman and the military force, 
reached the place and garrisoned it with national 
troops. The rebels had seized and fortified new and 
strong positions at New Madrid and Island Number 
Ten one thousand miles, by the course of the Missis- 
sippi, above New Orleans. 

General Folk's sound military judgment guided 
him to the choice of New Madrid on the Missouri side 
of the Mississippi River, together with Island Number 
Ten, as strong and mutually supporting defensive po- 
sitions where the Union forces on land and water might 
be held in check after the abandonment of Columbus 
by the Confederates. General McClown, of the Con- 
federate Army, was placed in command at New Mad- 
rid, and Beauregard, who outranked Polk, assumed 
command, in person, at Island Number Ten. The 
Union General Pope, with Illinois and Ohio troops, 
had set out from St. Louis on February 22d to seize 
these very positions, the strategic value of which had 
been discerned by General Halleck. Pope appeared 
before New Madrid on the 3d of March, and found it 
occupied by McClown, who was supported by a flotilla 

269 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

of Confederate gun-boats. That night the Confeder- 
ates evacuated New Madrid and retired to Island Num- 
ber Ten, which is a few miles above. 

Foote's flotilla reached the vicinity of Island Num- 
ber Ten on March 15th. This is what they saw : ' ' On 
the bluffs, a chain of forts (on the Kentucky and Ten- 
nessee side of the river) extending for four miles along 
the crescent-formed shore, with the white tents of the 
enemy in the rear. And there lay the island, in the 
lower corner of the crescent, with the side fronting the 
Missouri shore lined with heavy ordnance, so trained 
that, with the artillery on the opposite shore, almost 
every point on the river between the island and the 
Missouri bank could be reached at once by all the ene- 
my 's batteries. ' ' x 

Behind the position of the rebels on the eastern 
shore of the Mississippi Eiver were impassable 
swamps. ' ' The only way open for them to obtain sup- 
plies, or to effect a retreat, was by the river south 
of Island Number Ten. General Pope, with an 
army of twenty thousand men, was on the west- 
ern side of the river below the island. Perceiv- 
ing the defect in the enemy's position, he pro- 
ceeded, with great promptness and ability, to take ad- 
vantage of it. It was his intention to cross the river 
and attack the enemy from below ; but he could not do 
this without the aid of a gun-boat to silence the ene-

my 's batteries opposite Point Pleasant and protect his 
army in crossing. He wrote repeatedly to Flag-Officer 
Foote urging him to send down a gun-boat past the 
enemy 's batteries on Island Number Ten, and in one of 
his letters expressed the belief that a boat could pass 
down at night under cover of the darkness. But the 
flag-officer invariably declined, saying in one of his 
letters to General Pope that the attempt ' would result 
in the sacrifice of the boat, her officers, and men, which 
sacrifice I would not be justified in making. ' " * 

Commander Walke " believed with General Pope 
that, under the cover of darkness and other favourable 
circumstances, a gun-boat might run past the enemy's 
batteries formidable as they were with nearly fifty 
guns. ... It was well known that the Confeder- 
ates had a number of small gun-boats below, and were 
engaged in building several large and powerful vessels, 
of which the renowned Arkansas was one, and there 
was good reason to apprehend that these gun-boats 
would ascend the river and pass or silence Pope 's bat- 
teries, and relieve the Confederate forces on Island 
Number Ten and the eastern shore of the Missis- 
sippi." 

" Pope was charged with impatience. ... At 

length he caused the execution of the plan suggested 

by General Schuyler Hamilton for flanking the island. 

This was the cutting of a canal, through a swamp, 

i Rear- Admiral Walke in Century Magazine for January, 1885. 

271 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

from the river above the island to a bayou that flows 
into the Mississippi at New Madrid, below the island. ' ' 
" This canal was twelve miles in length, and was 
cut in the space of nineteen days, half the distance 
through a, growth of heavy timber. ' ' 

" The width of the canal was fifty feet." 
' ' On the night before its completion Pope 's wishes 
concerning the aid of gun-boats were partially grati- 
fied." 

Commander Walke gallantly volunteered to make 
the attempt to run past the batteries with his boat, the 
Carondelet. " The decks were covered with a loose 
material to protect them against plunging shot. Haw- 
sers and chain-cables were placed around the pilot- 
house and other vulnerable parts of the vessel. . . . 
A coal-barge laden with hay and coal was lashed to the 
part of the port side on which there was no iron 
plating, to protect the magazine, ' ' and other necessary 
preparations were made. On the night of April 4th, 
as Admiral Walke graphically relates, ' ' at ten o 'clock 
the moon had gone down, and the sky, the earth, and 
the river were alike hidden in the black shadow of a 
thunder-storm which had now spread itself over all 
the heavens. As the time seemed favourable I ordered 
the first master to cast off. Dark clouds now rose rap- 
idly over us and enveloped us in almost total darkness, 
except when the sky was lighted up by the welcome 
flashes of vivid lightning, to show us the perilous way 

272 



NAVAL OPERATIONS 

we were to take. With our bow pointing to the island, 
we passed the lowest point of land without being ob- 
served, it appears, by the enemy. All speed was given 
to the vessel to drive her through the tempest." 

Twice the smoke-stacks blazed up. The second time 
this occurred the boat was observed by the foe. ' ' Now 
the roar of the enemy 's guns began, and from batteries 
numbers two, three, and four came, almost incessantly, 
the sharp crack and screaming sound of their rifle- 
shells, which seemed to unite with the electric batteries 
of the clouds to annihilate us. ... We almost 
grazed the island, and, it appears, were not observed 
through the storm until we were close in, and the ene- 
my, having no time to point his guns, fired at random. 
In fact, we ran so near that the enemy did not, prob- 
ably could not, depress his guns sufficiently. . . . 
Nearly all the shot went over us. ... We arrived 
at New Madrid about midnight, with no one hurt, and 
were most joyfully received by our army. ' ' 1 

Other steamers came through the canal a few days 
later. The communications of the enemy were inter- 
rupted. Island Number Ten could no longer be held. 
The Confederates attempted to escape. They were 
intercepted and captured by Pope's troops. " The 
number of prisoners taken by Foote and Pope together 
was seven thousand two hundred and seventy-three, 
including three generals and two hundred and sev-

enty-three field and company officers. The spoils of 
victory were nearly twenty batteries, with one hundred 
and twenty-three cannon and mortars, the former 
ranging from thirty-two to one-hundred pounders; 
seven thousand small arms ; many hundred horses and 
mules; an immense amount of ammunition, and four 
steamers afloat. ' ' * 

Other steamers the Confederates had sunk, to ob- 
struct the passage of our fleet. 

On the 6th and 7th of April, as we have already 
seen, occurred the great battle of Pittsburg Landing, 
or Shiloh, 2 in which the national arms suffered disaster 
on the former day, but on the latter decisively de- 
feated Beauregard, the successor of General Albert 
Sidney Johnston. After the capture of Island Num- 
ber Ten, Foote's flotilla and Pope's army went 
down the Mississippi to capture Fort Pillow a 
stronghold eighty miles above Memphis, on the 
first of the Chickasaw Bluffs. Here, General M. Jeff. 
Thompson, with three thousand Confederate troops, 
was supported by a Confederate flotilla under Hollins. 
On the 9th of May Flag-Officer Foote, much enfeebled 
by disease and by the wounds he had received at Fort 
Donelson, was, at his own request, relieved of the com- 
mand of our flotilla, and was succeeded by Flag- Officer

they gave to the battle.

Davis. Immediately after Foote's retirement Holliiis 
boldly attacked our squadron with his gun-boats and 
rams. In this fight the enemy severely damaged two 
of Davis 's gun-boats, but was obliged, after a hot fight, 
to retreat rapidly in great confusion. On the 4th of 
June the Confederates, having learned of the retreat 
of Beauregard from Corinth, abandoned Fort Pillow 
and its vicinity and rapidly retreated to the defences 
of Memphis. A few days before this event (on the 
25th of May) our flotilla was re-enforced by four pow- 
erful rams constructed by Colonel Ellet. At dawn on 
the 5th of June Flag-Officer Davis took possession of 
Fort Pillow, and on that day the fleet pursued the foe 
to Memphis. On the morning of the 6th a decisive 
battle was fought between the hostile flotillas. I must 
allow Rear-Admiral Walke to tell the story of this 
tremendous combat, which lasted only one hour and 
ten minutes: 

" It was begun by the enemy (whose vessels were 
in double line of battle opposite the city) firing upon 
our fleet, then at a distance of a mile and a half or two 
miles above the city. Their fire continued for a quar- 
ter of an hour, when the attack was promptly met by 
two of our ram squadron, the Queen of the West (Colo- 
nel Charles Ellet) leading, and the Monarch (Lieu- 
tenant-Colonel Ellet, younger brother of the leader). 
These vessels fearlessly dashed ahead of our gun-boats, 
ran for the enemy's fleet, and at the first plunge suc- 

275 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

ceeded in sinking one and disabling another. The as- 
tonished Confederates received them gallantly and 
effectively. The Queen of the West and the Monarch 
were followed in line of battle by the gun-boats, under 
the lead of Flag-Officer Davis, and all of them opened 
fire, which was continued from the time we got within 
good range until the end of the battle two or three 
tugs keeping all the while safe distance astern. Queen 
of the West was a quarter of a mile in advance of the 
Monarch, and after having rammed one of the enemy's 
fleet, she was badly rammed by the Beauregard, which 
then, in company with the General Price, made a dash 
at the Monarch as she approached them. The Beaure- 
gard, however, missed the Monarch and struck the 
General Price in her port side, cutting her down to the 
water-line, tearing off her wheel instantly, and placing 
her hors de combat. The Monarch then ran into the 
Beauregard, which had been several times raked fore 
and aft by the shot and shell of our iron-clads, and 
she quickly sank in the river opposite Memphis. The 
General Lovell, after having been badly rammed by 
the Queen of the West (or the Monarch, as it is 
claimed), was struck by our shot and shell, and, at 
about the same time and place as the Beauregard, sank 
to the bottom so suddenly as to take a considerable 
number of her officers and crew down with her, the 
remainder being saved by small boats and our tugs. 
" The General Price, Little Rebel (with a shot-hole 
276 



NAVAL OPERATIONS 

through her steam-chest), and our Queen of the West, 
all disabled, were run on the Arkansas shore opposite 
Memphis; and the Monarch afterward ran into the 
Little Rebel just as our fleet were passing her in pur- 
suit of the remainder of the enemy's fleet, then retreat- 
ing rapidly down the river. The Jeff. Thompson, be- 
low the point and opposite President's Island, was the 
next boat disabled by our shot. She was run ashore, 
burned, and blown up. The Confederate ram Sumter 
was also disabled by our shell and captured. The 
Bragg soon after fared the same fate, and was run 
ashore, where her officers abandoned her and disap- 
peared in the forests of Arkansas. All the Confed- 
erate rams which had been run on the Arkansas shore 
were captured. The Van Dorn, having a start, alone 
escaped down the river. The Monarch and Switzer- 
land were despatched in pursuit of her and a few 
transports, but returned without overtaking them, al- 
though they captured another steamer. 

" The scene at this battle was rendered most sub- 
lime by the desperate nature of the engagement and 
the momentous consequences that followed very speed- 
ily after the first attack. Thousands of people crowded 
the high bluffs overlooking the river. The roar of the 
cannon and shell shook the houses on shore on either 
side for many miles. First wild yells, shrieks, and 
clamours, then loud, despairing murmurs, filled the 
affrighted city. The screaming, plunging shell crashed 
19 277 



into the boats, blowing some of them and their crews 
into fragments, and the rams rushed upon each other 
like wild beasts in deadly conflict. Blinding smoke 
hovered about the scene of all this confusion and hor- 
ror : and as the battle progressed and the Confederate 
fleet was destroyed, all the cheering voices on shore 
were silenced. With each disaster a sympathizing wail 
went up from the multitude. When the last hope of 
the Confederates gave way, the lamentations which 
went up from the spectators were like cries of anguish. 
. . . Chief of all results of the work of the flotilla 
was the opening of the Mississippi River once for all 
from Cairo to Memphis." Meanwhile, Commodore 
Farragut, with his frigates and gun-boats, aided by 
Commander David D. Porter with his mortar fleet, 
had entered the Mississippi from the Gulf of Mexico, 
had passed Forts Jackson and St. Philip, had fought a 
terrific naval battle and destroyed nearly the whole 
fleet of Confederate vessels that defended New Or- 
leans, and had gone up to that city. Soon afterwards, 
General Benjamin F. Butler, with a strong military 
force, assumed control of that chief commercial port 
of the South. Between the flotilla commanded by 
Flag-Officer Davis and Commodore Farragut 's squad- 
ron were Vicksburg and Port Hudson. There, too, was 
the leviathan Arkansas.

CHAPTER XXIX 

DARING EXPLOITS CAPTIVITY 

ON the 27th of June the Essex made the successful 
trial trip mentioned by Spencer in his letter of July 
2d to his mother. On the 6th of July the gun-boat 
departed from St. Louis, arrived at Cairo on the 7th, 
lay there two more days taking in ammunition and 
stores, set out from that port on the evening of the 
9th, and, having steamed down the Mississippi, joined 
Commodore Davis 's fleet at the anchorage above Vicks- 
burg on the 13th. On her passage down the river her 
port boiler burned out, and the fires had to be put out 
to repair it. At that time the question of absorbing 
interest to our fleet was, " Where is the Arkansas? " 
The Arkansas was an armoured Confederate ram 
' ' more powerful and destructive than any other naval 
vessel ever launched." " When Memphis fell into our 
hands it was ascertained that she had . . . been 
towed down the Mississippi, ' ' and it was supposed she 
was in the Yazoo a narrow, deep stream that empties 
its waters into the Mississippi from the east, a few 
miles above Vicksburg. Between that stronghold and 
the mouth of the Yazoo lay Commodore Davis 's fleet, 

279 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

including several of Farragut 's ships, which had come 
up from New Orleans, and Colonel Ellet's steam-rams. 
On the evening of the 14th of July, Captain Porter, 
having taken two of the enemy prisoners, learned from 
them that the Arkansas was lying in the Yazoo and 
intended to come out and attack our fleet the next day. 
The prisoners were sent to the flag-ship Benton, and in 
consequence of their story Flag-Officer Davis sent the 
gun-boats Carondelet and Tyler up the Yazoo at dawn 
on the 15th. Soon heavy firing was heard by the fleet. 
Half an hour later the Tyler hove in sight. She was 
closely followed by the Arkansas. The Carondelet, 
grounded in the Yazoo, had been disabled by the ene- 
my. The Arkansas took a leisurely course among the 
Federal ships, apparently impenetrable to their shot. 
She selected for the fire of her heavy armament the 
ram Lancaster, one of Colonel Ellet's vessels, and in 
a few minutes disabled her, exploding her boiler. The 
Benton and several other vessels of our fleet were much 
damaged by her assault. The Tyler and Carondelet 
were so crippled as to be obliged to return to Cairo 
for repairs. The Arkansas passed down the river to 
the wharf at Vicksburg unscathed by our gun-boats 
or by the broadsides of Farragut 's fleet withstand- 
ing the fire of more than twenty vessels. Rifled shot 
which she sent at the Essex had little effect. The com- 
pliment was returned by a " thirty-two-pounder steel 
plug ' ' and a ten-inch shell which was supposed to have 

280 



DARING EXPLOITS 

done some injury; but the boiler of the Essex being 
then under repairs that vessel could not get up steam 
to attack the monster. 

On the night of the 15th that part of Farragut 's 
squadron which was lying above Vicksburg repassed 
the batteries of that city and returned to their anchor- 
age below the city, where lay the rest of his fleet, in- 
cluding the mortar-boats of Commodore David D. Por- 
ter, a brother of W. D. Porter. On July 21st, Captain 
Porter, of the Essex, in consultation with Flag-Officers 
Farragut and Davis, ' ' offered to attack the Arkansas 
at close quarters." They assented, and it was ar- 
ranged that Commodore Davis 's fleet should attack the 
upper and Farragut 's the lower forts of the city, to 
divert their fire from the Essex. 

On the morning of July 22d, at four o 'clock, Por- 
ter weighed anchor and steamed slowly down the river. 
When he rounded the point above Vicksburg he was 
within twelve hundred yards of the enemy 's upper bat- 
teries, which at once concentrated upon the Essex a 
fire which it is said would have sunk, in ten minutes, 
any other gun-boat on the Western waters. One of 
Spencer's letters to his grandfather gives us a vivid 
conception of this terrific encounter. 

" The Essex, unassisted, ran the blockade within 
musket-shot of batteries mounting seventy-two guns 
and an almost impregnable gun-boat of heavier bat- 

281 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

tery than our own, carrying ten guns. We got up 
anchor at four A. M. 22d of July, . . . steaming 
down towards the point above Vicksburg, off which lay 
the Western flotilla, Flag- Officer Davis. The rebel 
boat (the Arkansas) lay under the upper batteries, 
and, together with them, opened fire upon us as soon as 
we came in range. Our ship, meanwhile, had been 
thoroughly prepared for action, every port being 
closed, every man and officer at his station, all ready. 
. . . The forward guns were loaded and run out 
the holes in the port-covers, and, replying to all that 
tremendous fire with a single gun, the Essex rapidly 
approached the rebel boat. The intention of Com- 
mander Porter to strike her fairly with our bow was 
frustrated by her letting go her head-line so that her 
head swung out into the stream, and she received only 
a grazing blow which threw us hard on shore. Pre- 
vious to our striking her she had been firing rapidly, 
but as we delivered the three round shot from our nine- 
inch guns in the bow, her men could be seen leaving 
her and getting ashore, and she no longer returned any 
fire. 

" Meanwhile, as we lay hard on shore midway be- 
tween the upper and lower batteries, they pounded us 
most unmercifully, shell after shell striking the case- 
mates and exploding so near the ports as to throw a 
continual lurid glare upon the darkened decks. Pieces 
of shell of all sizes, as well as numbers of splinters, lay 
upon the deck, and the ricochet shot covered her with 

282 



DARING EXPLOITS 

one continual foam of water. Yet, notwithstanding all 
the pounding we received, such was the strength of our 
casemates that but one shot penetrated, though several 
are still buried in them, and one shell exploded in the 
wood, a piece of which killed one man, and the splinters 
caused by it wounded three others our total loss. 
Succeeding at last in getting off the bank, Captain 
Porter looked in vain for the promised aid. The fleet 
below was nowhere to be seen, while that above, out 
of range of all but the long rifled guns, looked mere 
specks in the distance. He reluctantly abandoned his 
prey. Still we were but half through the danger. Ly- 
ing down on the decks by his order, we received an- 
other half -hour's pounding. 

"At last, coming in sight of the fleet below, we 
found them lying quietly at anchor, tranquil spectators 
of the fiery gauntlet we had run. We arrived in safety, 
and all hands were ordered on deck to reply to the 
hearty cheers with which the ships' crews greeted us. 
Here for the first time we saw how we had been 
pounded. Along the entire length of the vessel, on 
both sides, the frequent marks and indentations showed 
where our iron had protected us, while an occasional 
hole showed the entering of the iron into the solid 
casemates, fortunately so solid. The chimneys, ven- 
tilators, and awnings were riddled with shot and 
pieces of shell, and many more had made their mark in 
various places upon our rail and through the wheel- 
house, within which several wheel-arms were broken. 

283 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" By night we were again ready for action. The 
spectators on the fleet below described the water around 
us as in one continual foam from the plunging shot 
and shell. . . . Notwithstanding the shots we gave 
the ram Arkansas, she got up steam on the next day 
and ran up, threatening the upper fleet, drawing their 
fire and again returning under her batteries appar- 
ently as vigorous as ever. Let me not forget to say 
that the ram which was to support us from above came 
down, although late, and ran with tremendous velocity 
into the Arkansas, and succeeded in returning through 
the heavy fire of the batteries without losing a man. 
Though built for the business, such was the force of 
her blow that she stove in her butts and was soon after 
in a sinking condition. All honour to the ram ! 

' ' Though escaping safely, she was punched full of 
holes. The Arkansas did not seem to suffer from the 
blow. . . . It is said that our shots broke a large 
hole in her casemates and almost swept the decks. On 
the 24th we got under way with the ships of Farragut's 
squadron for New Orleans, bringing up the rear as the 
best qualified to repel the assaults of the rebel ram. 
All letters for me must be addressed by way of New 
York and New Orleans to the ' Essex, Mississippi 
Kiver.' Do not worry about me, as I am doing well 
and keeping extraordinary health. . . . 

" SPENCER. 

284 



DARING EXPLOITS 

" P. S. It has since been ascertained that the rebel 
batteries threw over five thousand shot and shell at 
the Essex during the two and one-half hours that she 
was under their fire." 

In the fall of 1863 Commodore Porter spoke to 
Mr. 0. C. Brown, with enthusiasm, of an instance of 
Spencer 's indifference to danger, telling him that while 
the Essex was lying under the Vicksburg batteries, ex- 
posed to a terrific fire and receiving no support from 
the fleet above, Spencer, wishing to know where the 
squadron was, volunteered to go on deck and learn. 
By Porter's permission he went, stood in the midst of 
that tempest of death, took a calm survey of the river, 
saw that no succour was promised, and returned to his 
commander with such a report as decided him to close 
the unequal combat in time to save his own vessel. 

The work of the Essex after this, as long as Spencer 
was on active duty with her, was on the lower Missis- 
sippi. The Confederates had not yet entirely given 
up the idea of recovering New Orleans. To the end of 
regaining that city the Arkansas was to co-operate 
with an army commanded by General Breckenridge. 
The ram was to ' ' drive the Federal gun-boats into the 
Gulf," and Breckenridge was to do the rest. 

On August 5th the Confederate troops attacked the 
Union General Williams, near Baton Rouge. This 



285 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

gallant officer was killed, but his army repulsed the 
enemy. In this battle Captain Porter placed the Es- 
sex in position to help our land forces with her heavy 
guns. The next day the gun-boat had need to fight on 
her own account as will appear from a letter written 
by Spencer. 

"U. S. GUN-BOAT ESSEX, 
" OFF BATON KOUGB, LOUISIANA, Aug. 7, 1862. 

11 GRANDFATHER COZZENS. 

" DEAR SIR: I seize the opportunity to send you 
a few lines, inclosing the monthly allowance for Fred, 
which if you will hand to his mother you will oblige 
me. 

' ' We are in exciting times. All of day before yes- 
terday the two armies were actually fightingj or skirm- 
ishing, behind the town, and for over three hours in the 
morning the gun-boats were busy shelling the enemy. 
All this time we were expecting an attack from the 
rebel boat the Arkansas, the smoke of which was visi- 
ble within long range of our rifle guns. Yesterday, 
however, we moved up and attacked her, the second 
shell we fired causing her crew to desert her, and a mo- 
ment after she commenced burning. 

" Giving three hearty cheers, the men poured the 
shell into her until we were compelled to withdraw for 
fear of the explosion of her magazine. The Arkansas 
is destroyed, and the Essex has the credit, singly and 
alone, of that which seemed so difficult that Commo- 

286

dore Farragut said, ' The man that did it should be 
made an admiral. ' 

" To Captain Porter and the Essex belongs the 
tribute of praise. I commanded my division during 
the engagement, fresh from a sick bed ; and, the action 
over, the fever came to me again. Still I am better 
to-day. 

" I send you, inclosed, a little cotton from the in- 
side bulwarks of the Arkansas also a fine splinter. 
You may rely upon their being genuine I ought to 
know. 

" The Essex was struck but once during the en- 
gagement of twenty minutes." 

Spencer makes no allusion in this letter to a des- 
perate enterprise in which he begged permission to 
embark. His father gave me the particulars, com- 
municated to him, no doubt, by Captain Porter him- 
self. Spencer volunteered to make the attempt alone, 
to blow up the Arkansas by a torpedo. His com- 
mander told him that it would, in all human proba- 
bility, cost him his life. This did not change Spencer's 
mind. He assured Captain Porter that he was willing 
to lose his life in the endeavour. He had formed his 
plans and felt sure of success. So great was his com- 
mander's confidence in him and his plans that he pre- 
pared the necessary means, and Spencer was ready 
to start on the perilous enterprise was only waiting 

287 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

for the small hours of the night to come when the 
order was received by Porter to move up with the 
Essex and attack the monster in the morning. 

Flag-Officer Farragut reported to the Navy De- 
partment on August 7th : 

" SIR: It is one of the happiest moments of my 
life that I am enabled to inform the department of the 
destruction of the ram Arkansas. . . . 

" Commodore Porter says he took advantage of her 
presenting a weak point towards him, and loaded with 
incendiary shells. After his first discharge with this 
projectile a gust of fire came from her sides, and from 
that moment it was discovered she was on fire, which 
he continued his exertions to prevent being extin- 
guished. They backed her ashore and made a line fast, 
which soon burnt, and she swung off into the river, 
where she continued to burn until she blew up with a 
tremendous explosion thus ending the career of the 
last iron-clad ram 1 of the Mississippi. There were 
many persons on the bank of the river witnessing the 
fight, in which they anticipated the triumph of Seces- 
sion ; but on the return of the Essex not a vessel was to 
be seen." 

Lossing says that the Arkansas was attacked, 
driven ashore, set on fire by her commander, and by 

1 Rebel ram he means. 

288 



DARING EXPLOITS 

the explosion of her magazine was blown into frag- 
ments. 

In The Gulf and Island Waters, Commander A. T. 
Mahan, after relating the incidents of the grounding 
of the ram, goes on to say : ' ' While in this position 
the Essex came in sight below. Powerless to move, re- 
sistance was useless, and her commander, Lieutenant 
Stevens, set her on fire as soon as the Essex opened, 
the crew escaping unhurt to the shore. Shortly after, 
she blew up. Though destroyed by her own officers, 
the act was due to the presence of the vessel that had 
gallantly attacked her under the guns of Vicksburg 
and lain in wait for her ever since. ' ' 

For a month more Porter patrolled the Mississippi 
between Baton Rouge and Vicksburg. At Bayou Sara 
a boat's crew from the Essex was attacked with mus- 
ketry by guerrillas sheltered in the heart of the town ; 
and at Natchez one man of a detachment sent on shore 
to obtain ice for the sick was killed, and five other sea- 
men and an officer wounded, by what is declared to 
have been an unprovoked assault made by about two 
hundred citizens. In retaliation, Bayou Sara was 
shelled and burned by Porter, and Natchez was bom- 
barded for an hour and twenty minutes. After many 
engagements with guerrillas, and several with the lower 
batteries of the enemy at Vicksburg, and with those at 
Port Hudson, the Essex having been much damaged, 
and having lost in two months, by sickness, captivity, 

289 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

wounds, scalding, and death, one hundred and twelve 
men and officers out of a total of one hundred and 
forty-six, ran down to New Orleans, seeking rest and 
recruits for the exhausted company, now reduced to 
thirty-four reported for duty. 

On his arrival at New Orleans, Porter learned that 
President Lincoln had ordered him to be promoted, 
for distinguished services, to the rank of commo- 
dore. 

One who would have rejoiced in his good fortune 
was no longer with the Essex. 

About a week after the destruction of the Arkansas 
Spencer went to Captain Porter to obtain permission 
to attempt the sinking of a ferry-boat which, plying 
across the Mississippi, furnished supplies to the Con- 
federate garrison at Port Hudson. His commander 
objected to the enterprise, fearing that it would in- 
volve too much loss of life. Spencer's reply, in sub- 
stance, was this : ' ' You know, Captain, I have been in 
many a tight place and yet have always got away. Let 
me try. ' ' Consent was finally given, and a transport 
was sent with forty armed men to do the work. On 
August 15th Spencer found the rebel boat and sank 
her. Having the transport close at hand with so strong 
an armed force for his protection, the young officer 
perhaps did not charge himself with rashness when, his 
work completed, he landed in a small boat and stepped 
a few paces from the shore. Two who professed to be 

290 



DARING EXPLOITS 

Union men called him aside. Suddenly, while they 
talked with him, a company of guerrillas rushed from 
their hiding-place, and seizing Spencer and four of 
his men carried them into captivity. 



291 



CHAPTER XXX 

SUSPENSE 

I KNOW not how long a time had gone after the 
disappearance of Spencer before his mother wrote this 
undated letter to his commander : 

" CAPTAIN PORTER. 

" DEAR SIR: Information is desired of Spencer 
Kellogg, fourth master of the Essex. We have not 
heard from him since the 9th of August. If anything 
has befallen him will you please direct information to 
his grandfather, L. Cozzens, Esq., Utica, New York? 
and greatly oblige his anxious mother and friends." 

When news came, it but increased the mother's 
anxiety. He had been missing more than four months 
when the next letter was written. 

" UTICA, January 7, 1863. 

1 ' MY DEAR HUSBAND : I have news from Spencer, 
dated September 25th, that he was then a prisoner, as 
a spy, in Jackson, Mississippi, with no gleam of hope 
for his life. You may expect me at Pierrepont Manor, 
with what information I have, Saturday evening. I 
cannot write more.

SUSPENSE 

Not long after this Mr. Brown wrote to his wife : 

" I fear for Spencer, but not without hope. I feel 
the more encouraged that Commodore Porter is so good 
a friend, and must have done all in his power, by 
menace, to save him. We should have heard if they 
had dared to execute him. 

' ' Let us not despair of our noble boy. ' ' 

The fluctuations of fear, the heart-sickness from 
hope deferred, the long suspense, will be conveyed 
most vividly by the correspondence which sprang up 
concerning him. 

" WASHINGTON CITY, Jan. 20, 1S63. 
' ' DEAR SIR : Your letter of the llth instant is at 
hand. I feel a deep interest in the case, and will pre- 
sent it to the President immediately, and urge action. 
' ' Very respectfully, 

" S..C. POMEROY. 

" To Mr. 0. C. BROWN." 

" ST. Louis, Feb. 12, 1863. 

" DEAR COUSIN MARY: Your letter of the 31st of 
January has just come to hand, and I hasten to reply. 

" Oh that I could give you some comfort in your 
affliction ! I heard the same report that you did. Com- 
modore Porter sent me word immediately, and I com- 
menced making diligent inquiry concerning Spencer, 
but my efforts were all fruitless, although I have

waited ever since, thinking that I might get some tid- 
ings of him before I wrote to you. As I once caused 
you unnecessary anxiety, it taught me a lesson not 
soon forgotten. 

" The last information I received was from one of 
his comrades who saw the men that were taken with 
him. They said that the jailer in Jackson, Mississippi, 
told them before their parole that Spencer was hanged 
as a spy. This, I fear, is too true. I have long since 
given up all hope of his safety. I can truly sympathize 
with you in this sad affliction, and need not assure you 
of our anxiety on his account since we heard of his 
capture. I shall see Commodore Porter, if he comes to 
the city, personally, and will give you any additional 
information I may get. 

' ' Affectionately yours, 

" W. F. COZZENS." 

His friends now believed him dead. His father 
wrote, on the 21st of February, to Commodore Porter : 

' ' DEAR SIR : By a recent letter from Mr. Cozzens, 
of St. Louis, I have confirmed to me the death of my 
noble boy, Spencer Kellogg Brown, known in the ser- 
vice as Spencer Kellogg. ... I have written Gen- 
eral Banks and the President. ... I had no in- 
timation of the cause of his long absence until the 1st 
of January, when a letter in pencil reached us from

him in his prison, dated September 25th-7th October, 
saying he had been a prisoner over a month, and, with- 
out any one to aid him, he had not a ray of hope of 
escape from the usual verdict of a court-martial 
1 Guilty.' " 

Mr. Brown's family, fully convinced of Spencer's 
death, put on mourning, and expected nothing more 
favourable or comforting than the particulars of his 
trial and execution. 

In April, 1863, through Mr. Snyder, who had been 
gunner of the Essex, fresh hopes were awakened in the 
minds of Spencer's friends. Mr. Brown at once wrote 
to Commodore Porter, who was then in New York, and 
received from him no encouragement to believe his son 
alive. 

" NEW YORK, May 18, 1863. 

4 'Mr. O. C. BROWN. 

' ' DEAR SIR : I will forward your letter to General 
Halleck. 

" Mr. Kellogg was a most excellent officer and a 
brave man. I was assured on the word of honour of 
ex-Governor Wy cliff e, of Louisiana, that he would be 
exchanged, but I have no doubt he has been most 
cruelly murdered by the rebels. I am now urging an 
investigation of the matter. 

" Respectfully, 

" W. D. PORTER." 
295 



However, the commodore wrote, a week later, to 
Mr. Wyatt, who had been an acting master of the 

Essex : 

" NEW YORK, May 23, 1863. 

' ' J. HARRY WYATT. * 

' ' DEAR SIR : I herewith inclose papers relating to 
Mr. Kellogg. As you know all the matter, please take 
it in hand, and see what you can do for Mr. Brown. 
" Yours truly, 

" W. D. PORTER." 

Mr. "Wyatt gave the matter prompt attention. This 
gentleman is mentioned in Harper's Magazine for 
February, 1863 (page 406) as a " complete officer 
. . . an Englishman . . . who, with his heart 
in our cause, has generously given, as a volunteer, 
nearly two of the best years of his life to sustain the 
supremacy of our Republic." The letter given below 
is additional evidence of the nobility of his character. 

"WASHINGTON CITY, D.C., May 26, 1863. 
1 ' DEAR SIR : The inclosed letter from Commodore 
W. D. Porter will explain the reason of my intruding 
on you this letter, though I am sure you will not look 
upon my writing in the light of an intrusion when I

cer, and am partly acquainted with his history not 
wholly. When I first met him in southwestern Mis- 
souri he related to me a part of his life history, and 
subsequently he told me his real name, but he did not 
give me the address of his friends, or you should long 
since have been made acquainted with all that has oc- 
curred that I had knowledge of. 

' ' Your letter to the Commodore, dated the 22d of 
last February, from some unknown reason did not 
reach him till lately, or I am sure it would have re- 
ceived instant attention. He does not tell me whether 
he has replied or not, so I reply. 

" On the 15th of August last Spencer was cap- 
tured at Port Hudson by the rebels. An hour after 
the Commodore heard of it which was at midnight 
the 15th he despatched a gun-boat from Baton Rouge 
to secure, if possible, his release ; and the Essex, a few 
hours later, also left Baton Rouge on the same mission. 
On the 17th of that month he (Porter) wrote from 
Bayou Sara to General Ruggles, commanding the rebel 
army then in that neighbourhood, asking his (Spen- 
cer's) exchange, and did all that was possible . . . 
to effect it. On our arrival at New Orleans, on the 7th 
of September, General Butler was communicated with 
on the same subject. I was present then and at an 
after interview, and know how earnestly this was 
urged. On the 9th of September, ex-Governor Wyc- 
liffe, under a flag of truce, had an interview with 

297 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

General Butler relative to exchange of prisoners, and 
again the matter was urged by the Commodore. I was 
then also present. Wycliffe then promised that his 
person was sacred and that he should receive all the 
consideration afforded to the most favoured prisoners 
of war. He told us then he (Spencer) was at Camp 
Moore. 

' ' On the 13th the Commodore left the Essex, and 
on arrival in New York city, on the 20th, immediately 
put the Secretary of the Navy (as the Secretary of 
War also) in possession of all facts, asking their im- 
mediate exertions to effect his exchange. Since then, 
and up to the present time, every effort has been used 
to get knowledge of him, but without result. About 
two months since I heard from a brother officer the re- 
port made by those men who were captured with him, 
but there was no positiveness in their information, al- 
though the Secretary of the Navy was made acquaint- 
ed with their report, as also General Halleck, who is 
personally interested in him. The department have 
had full and explicit information of his services and 
noble character. 

" I would not like to raise false hopes, yet I have 
Still the conviction, from the inquiry made by the 
heads of the departments, that had he been sentenced 
by a court-martial the Confederate Government would 
have at once communicated the fact to our Govern- 
ment in reply to their interrogatories. 

298 



SUSPENSE 

" Rest assured all that human effort can do shall 
be done to gain every particular that you may desire 
to know. Although it may be some weeks, or even 
longer, before I can get from General Halleck infor- 
mation which has already been set on foot, yet you 
may rest satisfied were you on the spot to inquire, for 
your own self, no more earnestness could be used than 
shall be. Although I cannot write his history, as you 
wish, yet there is much of it I am acquainted with, and 
soon will send it you. The outline I have written 
and laid before General Halleck long since, and the 
Secretary of the Navy too. . . . 

" His effects left on the boat are quite safe, 1 I 
know, and would have been forwarded had any ad- 
dress of his friends been known. 

" There are some other suggestions in your note 
to the Commodore which I will communicate with him 
upon, and then you shall have a more definite reply 
than this hasty note. I was desirous, however, you 
should no+ ^o kept waiting even for the little this com- 
munication gives. 

" If I do not touch on the painful separation in 
tone of sympathy or condolence, do not think it is the 
less sorrowful to me. Spencer was my friend almost 
the only one I had in the land of my adoption, and 
personally he was very dear to me. I would willingly

to order it. I am alone in the world ; he had all that 
was bright in prospect in his profession, and also in 
the love and regard of his family and friends. To 
you all, I need not say, he was perfectly devoted. But 
our lives and our all are in far wiser hands than our 
own, and if He who guides all our actions sees fit in 
His wisdom to call us from this glorious though sor- 
rowful world, no doubt it is right, and it is Infinite 
Love that guides the blow we are so prone to murmur 
at. I need not say again, pray use me in any way I 
can be of service to you.

This letter and the next inspired unspeakable joy 
and gratitude. 

" WASHINGTON, May 27, 1863.

last evening I met with one of the officers of the In- 
dianola, just returned from the Confederate States. 
Your son Spencer is not dead, or was not on the 15th 
of March so that your report, as well as that I heard, 
was not correct. There is still hope a little, I would

turned to you. All that can be done here will be done

A little later came this reply to a letter written 
by Spencer's grandfather to the commanding officer 
of the " Mississippi Squadron " David D. Porter, a 
brother of William D. Porter, of the Essex:

Jackson, Mississippi, just previous to General Grant 's

wife in or near Utica. 1 . . . 

" There are not many chances of his escape,

wife, sending to the care of 0. C. Brown, an attorney, 1

" I have written to the paymaster of the Essex,

Inclosing Mr. Storrs's letter to Mr. Brown, Spen- 
cer's grandfather wrote: 

" June 5, 1863.

heard from him before this time. They were probably 
removed to some place of safety. If to Vicksburg, the 
last news was that the prisoners were sent across the 
river and the jail burnt by a shell. At all events, the 
chances are that, in all the movements, he may yet be 
liberated and his life spared. 

" For this let us ever pray. . . . 
" Yours truly,

" To Mr. 0. C. BROWN." 

In August, 1863, a package of papers, written by 
Spencer himself, found its way to St. Louis. It was 
transmitted by officers of our army who had been in 
Jackson, Mississippi, and comprised letters for Mr. 
William F. Cozzens and for Spencer's wife. There 
were also sixteen pages of foolscap covered with his 
meditations written in prison at Jackson in the form 
of a diary. Before these were received, however, 
there came to Mr. Cozzens other tidings of Spencer's 
safety. These he communicated to Mr. Brown. 

" ST. Louis, August 4, 1863. 

" 0. C. BROWN, Esq.: I had some intelligence 
yesterday direct from Spencer, and, although I am 
just recovering from a severe illness and scarcely am 
able to write, I hasten to give you the welcome news. 

303 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

My informant, who has been on secret service in the 
South, saw Spencer and had a long talk with him at 
Selma, Alabama. When Grant made his first attack 
on Jackson, he, Spencer, was taken to Montgomery. 
He also sent a letter by this man, which the man was 
compelled to destroy, as he got into a tight place and 
had to destroy all his papers. He says Spencer looked 
well, although in close confinement. He had not yet 
had a trial, although he had frequently asked for one. 
He says the only evidence against him is a man who, 
the citizens say, cannot be believed under oath. There 
is an Episcopal minister who, . . . although a 
rebel, has taken such an interest in Spencer that he 
has furnished him everything he has wanted, even to 
clothing, and through his influence I hope he will get 
away. I have received a package of papers for Mrs. 
Mary Kellogg. All join in kind regards to yourself 
and your family. 

" Yours, 

" W. F. COZZENS."

package I give below :

to have come from Richmond, and to have inspired in 
Mr. C.'s mind hopes of the success of some plan for 
Spencer's escape from Castle Thunder, where he was 
then confined. The wisdom of Mr. Cozzens will be 
approved by any one who comprehends the peril of 
Spencer's circumstances at the time. 

" ST. Louis, August 11, 1863. 

" 0. C. BROWN, Esq. 

" SIR: I have just received some glad tidings 
from Spencer, who is still in prison. He requests me 
to send the letter to his friends, but there are some 
important secrets in it which, if divulged, would not 
only destroy his prospects but implicate others who 
have befriended him. I know that you would not act 
injudiciously in the matter, but I fear that some of 
his many friends might write to him and say some- 
thing that would injure him. So I think best to retain 
the secrets and give you all the news. 

" He is not treated as a prisoner of war, but is 
called by the newspapers one of the ' Yankee Hos- 
tages.' He has everything to make him comfortable, 
with plenty of books, etc. He wishes you to send for

Although I do not give you his address (I hope for 
reasons that you will approve), I will say that he is 
much more comfortably situated and nearer home 
than when I last wrote to you ; and I have now strong

hopes of his speedy release provided we act very cau-

he is well. Please inform her. He seems quite re- 
signed to his fate, whatever that may be. The party 
who saw him and conversed with the minister who be- 
friended him, says he is a devoted Christian if there 
is one on the earth. He * was in the habit, when near 
him, of visiting him three times a week, and talking 
with him two or three hours at a time. The minister's 
wife also visited him frequently. . . .

Then came a letter, inclosed in one from Commo-

though, properly interpreted, it really contained only 
premonitions of evil.

and I have the honour to inform you that he is confined 
in Castle Thunder under charges of being a spy and a 
deserter. Assurances are given that he shall have the 
speediest possible trial, and if the charges are not sus- 
tained he will be delivered up. He has already been 
exchanged. 

11 I am, very respectfully, 

" Your obedient servant, 

" W. HOFFMAN, 

" Colonel of the Third Infantry, Com. -Gen. Prisoners." 

Writing that Spencer had been exchanged, Colonel 
Hoffman meant only that the cartel for the delivery 
of prisoners made arrangements for the young man's 
release should he be acquitted of the charges laid 
against him. The wording misled the prisoner's rela- 
tives, as we see by this letter from his grandfather : 

" DEAR COMMODORE: We have not yet heard of 
the liberation of our Spencer Kellogg. In a letter you 
forwarded to me, it is said that he is to be speedily 
brought to trial, and then it says, ' he has already been 
exchanged.' We are still in doubt whether it meant 
that he was still held for trial or had been released or 
exchanged. I wrote to the commissary-general of pris- 
oners for an explanation, but he has not answered my 
inquiry. Would you be good enough to ascertain, 
from the department, whether he is still held for trial, 

308

and write me at Utica, and any other information you 
may have in relation to him ? By so doing you will con- 
fer a special favour on his friends and greatly oblige 
' ' Your friend, 

" LEVI COZZENS." 

" P. S. I think we should have heard from him 
if liberated." 

On the blank page of this letter Commodore Por- 
ter replied that he had just written to the Navy De- 
partment urging as strongly as he could that most 
strenuous efforts be made to obtain the release of 
Spencer. 

Commodore Porter, Spencer's commanding officer, 
was at this time off duty. He died May 1, 1864, 
without having been again called into active service. 

Some time in August or September a letter from 
Castle Thunder reached Spencer's sister Kitty a 
fond letter, penned in the handwriting so familiar to 
all his family. He had often written, he said, but had 
never received any reply. His relatives had tried in 
every way known to them to communicate with him. 
They were long ignorant of the fact that all their let- 
ters were cruelly kept from him. To this day it is not 
known by what hand of escaped or exchanged prison- 
er, or Northern spy, Spencer 's letter of July 20th was 
brought to his sister. It was couched in cautious terms 
and addressed to Miss K. C. 
21 309 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

At that time the young officer had strong hopes of 
release from prison, and his letter naturally cheered 
his friends with new and brighter expectations. 

A little later the despatch given below was received 
from an exchanged member of the Sanitary Commit- 
tee a kind and sympathizing gentleman, whose mem- 
ory is cherished by all of Spencer 's friends : 

(Telegram from Mr. Scandlin) 

"WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 24, 1863. 
" To LEVI COZZENS: Spencer Kellogg has been 
tried in Richmond. He has no hopes of escaping the 
penalty of death. He is anxious to hear from you im- 
mediately. He is well, and prepared for any result. 

V W. G. SCANDLIN, 

" Sanitary Committee." 

This was followed by a letter : 

" SANITARY COMMITTEE,

" WASHINGTON, D. C., Sept. 25, 1863. 

" Mr. LEVI COZZENS. 

" DEAR SIR: The painful intelligence I was 
obliged to telegraph troubled me exceedingly, but I 
could fulfil my promise to your grandson no other 
way. 

" This morning I saw Major-General Hitchcock, 
who has the entire charge of all matters pertaining to

prisoners. His ( Kellogg 's) case was well known to 
him, and he promised, when I gave him the intelligence 
I brought, to do all he could. General Meredith, our 
Commissioner of Exchange, promised me the same, at 
Fortress Monroe. 

" Inclosed you will find some of his handiwork, 
made while he was in prison. The gold ring was given 
him by his wife, and if you know where she is he 
would like her to have it ; if you do not, it is for his 
sister. 

" He was quite cheerful, and assured me, in lan- 
guage I could not doubt, that he was fully prepared 
for any and every result. 

' ' He had no hope of escape ; and, to be truthful 
to the full extent, I can see little for him. He is 
charged with desertion and as a spy. Two men swear 
positively upon one or the other of these, and the es- 
tablishment of either would be serious indeed. 

" Let me commend you, in the hour of your great 
trial, to the highest source of human comfort and con- 
solation to the God who treasures the sacrifices that 
are now being made for the cause of Liberty and 
Truth. 

" My address will be, for the present, Graf ton,

Before Mr. Scandlin's letter had been received in 
Utica both Mr. Levi Cozzens and Mr. Brown, appalled 

311 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

by the purport of the telegram, had departed from 
the city, nerved to make one more desperate effort to 
have the Government at Washington bestir itself ef- 
fectually, if possible, to save Spencer. 

Mr. Brown was armed with a letter from the Hon- 
ourable Roscoe Conkling, United States Senator from 
New York, addressed to the Secretary of War. Mr. 
Cozzens had received the telegram promptly and had 
forwarded it to Mr. Brown, who was living at Hender- 
son, in Jefferson County. Mr. Cozzens also took such 
immediate and energetic action as this letter reports: 

" UTICA, Sept. 25, 1863.

" DEAR SIR : I last evening received the telegraphic 
message inclosed herewith, with the sad news it con- 
tained. I immediately telegraphed to Commodore 
Porter to try to save him. I also telegraphed him to 
see General Halleck and the Secretary of the Navy 
and try to get an effort by hostage or some other 
way, to save him. I also wrote a letter to the Commis- 
sary-General for Prisoners to get him to make an ef- 
fort; and, if he was sacrificed, to obtain his body if 
possible, and have it preserved and sent to me, and 
I would pay all necessary expense. I also wrote a let- 
ter to Spencer, trying to comfort him, and gave him 
news about the family, and sent it, with extra stamps, 
to Mr. Scandlin, with the request to forward it leav- 

312 



ing the letter opened for examination, saying if there 
was anything in it that would prejudice the Confeder- 
ates not to send it. I wrote with caution, saying noth- 
ing about his guilt or innocence, saying only that I 
had made every effort to save him, which I hoped 
would prove successful. 

' ' My first thought was to go directly to Washing- 
ton, and try to reach him, but on consulting Roberts 
and others, who thought it extremely doubtful whether 
it could be done, I gave it up. 

" You will, of course, do as you think best. If he 
is executed you might be able, if in Washington, to 
obtain his body possibly, if not too late, yet be the 
means of saving him. 

' ' You will use your discretion about letting M. A. 1 
know all.

This letter was received at 9 p. M., September 
the 25th. At 9.30 Mr. Brown was on his way towards 
Washington. In Utica he consulted Mr. Cozzens and 
wrote a few lines to Mrs. Brown, who remained in

go, by all means. He hopes that if Spencer is alive 
Government will save him. He is very earnest in his 
behalf and has been doing all in his power. Wyatt 
has disappeared for some months, and may be in the 
South now working for him. He said he would ' save 
Kellogg if it cost him his life. ' The Commodore could 
get no trace of Wyatt for a long time. Commodore 
Porter will put the matter of Spencer before the Presi- 
dent and General Halleck in a very strong manner. 
. . . So do not despair. I still have faith, and trust 
that God will give us our noble boy alive. 

' ' Porter regards him as a most valuable man, and 
will set forth to the Government the immense value of 
his services to the Federal cause. Hope to be detained 
but one day in Washington. 

" YOUR HUSBAND."

SUSPENSE 

Parts of memoranda of this journey, jotted down 
by Spencer's father, are given below: 

' ' Arrived at New York Sabbath morning, Septem- 
ber 27th. Commodore Porter willingly accompanied 
me to Washington, where we arrived Monday morn- 
ing, the 28th. 

' ' The Department believed him alive, and that the 
rebels would not dare execute him. General Halleck's 
language was : ' Mr. Brown, your son is safe. All the 
power of this Government will be employed to protect 
him.' I therefore telegraphed home that he was safe 
little thinking of the import of that word. . . . 

" Before leaving Washington I visited Colonel 
Hoffman 's office and made several attempts to write a 
few lines to be forwarded to my son; but it was im- 
possible for me to write one word. After repeated 
efforts I gave it up. . . . 

" Having done all we could in Washington, and 
having been strongly reassured by the Government, 
with hopes renewed we took the early train for New 
York, arriving at eight P. M. 

" On our way, and at supper in New York, the 
Commodore was planning for Spencer's promotion. 
Pointing to his naval cap he said: * That was your 
son's cap. Before he left me I proposed to exchange 
with him because his cap had a nice oil-cloth cover; 
so the insignia of rank were changed and I took his 
cap and he mine.' 

315 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

' ' After supper we parted, the Commodore to go to 

the Hoffman House and I to call upon Uncle B , 

where Spencer 's grandfather had been stopping. 

" I was asked, ' What news from Washington? 
Have you seen the Evening Post ? '

CHAPTER XXXI 
SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT AT JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 

SOON after Spencer's seizure at Fort Hudson, he 
was taken to the penitentiary at Jackson, the capital 
of the State of Mississippi, where many prisoners of 
war were held by the enemy. He was soon released on 
parole as an officer, but was rearrested and ordered 
into close confinement as a spy, having been recognised 
by a Confederate officer of engineers under whom he 
had served, chaining distances probably, as his own 
report of his ' ' secret service ' ' relates, in the vicinity 
of Island Number Ten. 

Frequently there is lively commerce of opinion and 
argument as to whether any circumstances can justify 
the telling of a lie. The military and naval officers of 
nominally Christian nations are supposed to be men 
of the highest honour men who scorn falsehood. Nev- 
ertheless, deceit and falsehood are practised on the 
widest scale in war. The proposition that falsehoods 
and deceptions are necessary, and therefore right, in 
war, has been accepted, practically, by all belligerents. 

No long course of reasoning is needful to convince 
an honest man that falsehood is never right ; that death 

317 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

itself is preferable to the moral disorder and degrada- 
tion that result from untruthfulness. To do evil 
never can be right. A thoroughly sound, pure soul 
would require no argument to be convinced that false- 
hood is evil. When we do wrong we get into a false 
position (and all sin is a low, false thing), and we are 
strongly tempted to lie by word or act ; to deny or pal- 
liate our offence in order to escape its consequences. 

There is something radically wrong in the accepted 
system of " secret service." Espionage, when it in- 
volves deceit and falsehood, as it almost invariably 
does, is an unmixed evil. A Christian may say confi- 
dently and boldly that it is sinful. Cobwebs foul with 
the dust of disintegrated empires are clinging to this 
subject to obscure it. Good men are imposed upon by 
the illusive aspects of the question and by traditions 
of the ages. Church members and doctors of divinity 
are duped, as are others. It is not strange that the ser- 
vice of the scout or spy in time of war has been gener- 
ally acknowledged to be honourable and necessary. 
Brave and patriotic men like to serve their country in 
scenes of perilous adventure. However, from the 
highest point of view, nothing which is wrong is really 
for the good of the cause we serve if the cause is a good 
one. Nothing which is wrong is a worthy expression 
of patriotism. Eighteousness that exalts the individ- 
ual character proportionately exalts the nation. I 
leave to others the discovery of some way better than 

318 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

that pursued in the past to obtain knowledge of the 
strength and plans of the enemy. The reconnaissance 
is legitimate. In a just war harder fighting and less 
resort to intrigue would promote in the same degree 
the nobility of the individual warrior and the power 
and virtue of the nation. An army of men too brave 
to tell a falsehood would be almost invincible. Hero- 
ism may find more appropriate service and reward 
than that which is sought in the mask of a spy. 

Spencer, in the solitude of his prison cell, reviewed 
his course and believed that part of it had been 
crooked. I shall not call it straight. It is well to see 
things as they are. Under certain influences our brave 
and pure young patriot deviated from the path he 
ought to have chosen. The rectitude of his character 
was fully vindicated by his earlier and later behaviour. 

He had pondered well his past and his present 
when he wrote this letter, so serious and so loving : 

JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, Sept. 25, 1862. 

' ' DEAR WIPE : Through the kindness of Mr. 
Wheat, a minister, I am enabled to send you word 
where I am, and explain the meaning of my long 
silence. 

" I could not write to you before, for I have been 
a prisoner over a month, and I am yet one, and, dar- 
ling, may never see you again. Charged with being a 
spy, and without aid of any kind (except from God), 

319 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

it is not likely that I can escape a court-martial 's usual 
sentence ' Guilty.' 

" Yet, darling, hope for the best, and remember, 
' He doeth all things well, ' and if I die here you may 
meet me in heaven. I have often gone to meet you, 
pet ; could you not try to meet me there ? 

" When you see Jack, tell him where I am, 
and ask him, for me, to tell my uncle also. Tell him 
he can get the Masonic jewels from my aunt, with 
whom I left them for safe-keeping. Give him my kind 
remembrances, and tell Mr. Cozzens that I recollect 
his kindness in days past. 

' ' My uncle must write to my Father for me. And 
now, dear one, what can I say to comfort you 1 I long 
to see you so much, and think of you and pray for you 
very often. But our Father in heaven bless and care 
for and comfort you, since He leaves me no longer 
with you. He is both able and willing and has prom- 
ised. Do not mourn for me too much ; and remember, 
if we do not meet here we may in heaven. . . . 

" If I die here I will leave the disposition of my 
little all to Mr. O. C. Brown, Utica, New York, who will 
carry into effect the directions I will leave on the sub- 
ject : and you must write to him about it, giving your 
address. He will not fail to do as I wish. I would 
send him your present address, but I am afraid it may 
be changed. This will save you the trouble and ex-

pense of a lawyer, besides putting your affairs in the 
hands of a man in whom I trust. October 7th. Still 
waiting patiently, dear wife, and, by the kindness of 
my heavenly Father, in good health and quite com- 
fortable. I think of you often, praying God always, 
according to His promise, to comfort and care for you. 
Do not grieve after me, but remember I am under the 
care of One who died for me, and that all things will 
work together for good to those that love Him. Neither 
be cast down nor dismayed because 1 . . .

fort you ! 

" SPENCER." 

The Reverend William Cloes Crane, a clergyman 
of the Protestant Episcopal Church, was rector of the 
Parish of St. Andrews, in Jackson, Mississippi, dur- 
ing the time of Spencer's confinement in the peniten- 
tiary there. This good man took a deep interest in 
the welfare of the prisoners, and was so genuinely 
Christ-like in his ministrations as to win him the fa- 
vour and affection of the young man who was charged 
with being a spy. He gave Spencer a Prayer-Book, 
which lies before me now. It is of moderate size, is 
bound in black muslin, and seems to have met with 
some accident that has stained many of its leaves, but 
is valued beyond price for its associations and con-

tents. On its imprinted pages is part of a diary writ- 
ten by Spencer in prison. 

' ' He who satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the 
hungry soul with goodness hath prepared a table be- 
fore me in the presence of mine enemies. 

" Bless the Lord, my soul, and forget not all 
His benefits. (October 26, 1862. Sabbath.) 

' ' God has this morning shown me how much there 
is warm and loving in His Church Service. (October 
.27th.) 

" October 28th. In close confinement eight weeks 
to-day. How well God has taught me what it means 
to ' glory in tribulation! ' 

" I cannot express in words how infinitely trifling 
appear the mere temporary things of my life when 
compared with the things of God. He has indeed pre- 
pared a table before me, and I have owned with many 
thankful tears the gift of the Bread of Life. 

' ' October 29th. 'Tis a cheering thought that after- 
death there will be no more any fear of temptation and 
sin. That will indeed be rest ! I know now what war- 
fare is, and begin to know how much the word vigilant 
means. Oh, for help ! 

' ' October 30th. Let me write it now whether, at 
some future time, when free, 7 live to read it, or for 
some loved one that through Christ's love there is no 
more fear in death, but an earnest hope that, if it 

322 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

please God, I may soon be free from this terrible war- 
fare; and that in death, being made free, I can say 
' Thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory.' If I 
have longed to see you again, dear ones, God knows 
how willing I am now that it should be in heaven. 

" October 31st. Have this day finished reading 
the lectures of Rev. Henry Blunt upon the Seven 

Churches, loaned me by Mr. C . My knowledge of 

Scripture and of the Church has been much improved 
by them. ... I am able to read many parts of 
the Bible more understandingly, and, I hope, profit- 
ably, than before. Let me also add that I believe they 
have been a benefit and a comfort. Have been reading 
another of the works so kindly lent me by Mr. Crane 
reading of our Saviour's love for us. If there is one 
doubtful * thing in our religion it is that God has loved 
us so much. 

" November 1, 1862. I have been reading, this 
morning, about the witness of the Spirit. If it be ' the 
full assurance of faith, ' and ' joy and peace in believ- 
ing,' then, thank God, that witness is mine. Indeed, 
my life here has, many days since, but chiefly since 
the last Sabbath, ceased to seem like trial, but rather 
seems like mercy. Through the kindness of my God 
and the assurance of hope, I trust that nothing hence- 
forth will seem trial except temptation ; and if God be 
with us who or what shall be against us ? He has prom- 
1 I presume he means that such love is almost incredible. 

323 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

ised grace for every need. Though many days my 
comfort is not bright, yet lately it always seems sure. 
At this, the close of the present week, let me record 
how good and merciful my heavenly Father has been 
to me a week passed in perfect health and freedom 
from bodily pain, ushered in, continued, and closed, 
with spiritual blessings ; a week of bright anticipations 
of the happy future; a week none the less profitable 
for being spent in the valley of humiliation; a week 
marred by nothing but my own sin, yet even that open- 
ing up more love of my Saviour. 'Tis closed by the 
commencement of a new month where I did not think 
to see as many weeks. Oh ! let me thank my God who 
hath crowned me with loving-kindness and tender 
mercy. 

" November 3d, Sabbath. I cannot refrain from 
writing, this morning, how good my Saviour has been 
to me. Surrounded with comforts that make my pris- 
on seem a palace warm raiment, good food and 
plenty, and shelter all that any man need want in 
this life. But I have more than these God's word 
preached every Sabbath (this morning I have heard 
it) ; plenty of good books, with promise of more ; and 
full liberty to devote my time to them. . . . But 
I have more than this, the conscious smile of my Sa- 
viour, the full assurance of faith in a happy future 
come life, come death, I can trust in His love. How 
grateful I should be to that Saviour, who bought it all 

324 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

with His blood. . . . How few with me say, ' Lead 
me not into temptation, ' feeling that God has in mercy 
given them almost total exemption from most of the 
outward temptations of the world. 

" November 3d. Let me remark how much my 
memory has been strengthened and increased since the 
commencement of my confinement probably from al- 
most always having read aloud, and often marking 
noticeable passages. Who shall say it is not a blessing, 
and a great one ? Let me be thankful. 

" Have been visited by an Episcopal clergyman 
since, 1 who brought me an algebra, kindly lent by Mr. 
Crane. The end is near, he says. I can but recognise 
the hand of my kind Father in thus reminding me of 
my death, which no doubt will soon come. I can only 
strive still more faithfully, asking my Saviour's aid, 
for preparation. That death has lost its bitterness, 
thanks be to God! Nor does the warning seem else 
than a mercy. May He do with me as seemeth good in 
His sight. 

" Afternoon. Let me own God's mercy, and 
(strange!) feeling kindness from a daughter of Mr. 
Crane 's to an unknown prisoner. More than all to one 
called a spy. A kindness so strange that it is no won- 
der I should turn my eyes, filled with tears, to God, to 
give thanks and recognise His mercy. Losing faith 
for a moment, cast down, I remembered a slip of paper 
1 Probably he means, since he wrote what precedes this. 

22 325 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

which I had received by the person before spoken of 
this morning. Reading it for the first time, I found 
my wants supplied. I was directed to my Saviour. 
How could I help shedding tears at kindness and mercy 
so opportune ? To my Saviour be the praise, and may 
His choicest blessings rest upon her ! How rarely is 
any one in my condition thought of but with con- 
tempt. How Christian the act, and how especial the 
Divine favour that sent those lines ! Need I add, God 
sent His blessing with them. 

" November 4th. Lord, ' abide with [me], for it 
is toward evening and the day is far spent.' (Luke 
xxiv, 29.) I prayed it, and then came words of com- 
fort and cheer even as I rose from my knees. Oh, let 
me have faith and thank God. I have just read God's 
promise that He ' will not suffer the soul of the right- 
eous to famish.' (Proverbs x, 3.) . . . 

' ' Let me remark, gratefully, that it is a promise pe- 
culiarly fulfilled in me, for I have always had a suf- 
ficiency of good books since I have been here, and 
. . . this day He has added me another, John 
Bunyan's Complete Works. 

"November 5th. How thankful should I be! 
God has provided me ' a spring of water for a guide ' 
(Isaiah xlix, 10), to use Bunyan's words in speaking 
of his book. 

" For some cause, I know not what, unless it is my 
weakness and the power of sin, I seemed to lose faith, 

326 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

and drifted out in a terrible, wretched period of un- 
belief. Judgment said all was right, but my heart felt 
lost. Nor was I enabled to see clear again until after 
nearly the whole afternoon spent in prayer and 
wretched suspense. But God at last had mercy upon 
me and restored my feet to the way, and I was enabled 
again to see faintly that light for which I had looked. 
How thankful I was then ! 

" November 6th. I think, through the night and 
this morning, I have had a deeper view of my own en- 
tire vileness and God's wonderful ' electing love ' in 
choosing me (I have felt how unworthy) from among 
companions still left, ... to give me repentance 
and faith ; ( I yesterday learned by experience that it 
was His gift), and when I think that He has com- 
menced and done it all, it gives me faith to believe 
He will finish." 

Of the entries made in the Prayer-Book I have 
omitted very little excepting an incomplete letter. 
The next of his writings in point of time is given below. 

"PENITENTIARY, JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, 
January 24, 1863. 

' ' DEAR FATHER : And I write for all. After be- 
ing confined here since last September (2d) without 
any knowledge of the result, I am to-day told by an 
aide-de-camp of the post commander that my trial is 
ordered and will probably occur within ten days. He 

327 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

was also accompanied by two men who will probably 
appear against me. 

" It has never been my experience to undergo a 
court-martial; yet, from what I know of them, and 
from being placed beyond (as well as denied) all 
means of defence, my hope of seeing you on earth 
again is gone. 

" Yet God, in kindness to you, and in great and 
unmerited mercy to me, will not, I hope and trust, sep- 
arate us for ever ; for He has been pleased to visit me 
here (long with only His Word for my guide), with a 
mercy which came not to me in the world, and I have 
trust and hope in my Saviour. "Tis with a lowly 
thankfulness that I can thus bid you rejoice, and with 
the feeling of the great value of His kind gift ; for it 
is all that has cheered my weary hours that are past, 
making many of them hours of joy ; and it is that which 
sustains me now. 

" Surely if my Saviour gives me hope, you need 
not fear; but thank Him, as I have often done, for 
your labour of love in His cause during my hours of 
childhood. 

" The long imprisonment has been, by His bless- 
ing, of great good to me. His ministers have visited 
me (chiefly Mr. Crane, the Episcopal clergyman 
here), lending me books which He was pleased to bless 
unto me and speaking kind words which seem very 
pleasant here. Several others have been thus very 

328 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

kind to me also, so that I have been enabled to improve 
the time. 

" Forgive me if too much of my paper tells only of 
myself, for it will, no doubt, be my last, and I must 
try to improve it. Have written before, but, fearing 
you have not received my letter, must rewrite much 
that you should know. 

' ' Monday, 26th. I take the opportunity to tell you, 
in as few words and as briefly as I can, about my af- 
fairs, which, from their very poverty, will not trouble 
you very much. Will yourself or Mother be kind enough 
to write to my wife ? Address Mrs. Mary Kellogg, 128 
South Sixth Street, corner of Elm Street, St. Louis, 
Missouri, telling her of, or sending her also, my letter 
to you ? Will you also please to procure for her what- 
ever the law allows, pension, bounty, etc.? If it 
amount to anything, you will keep what pay is com- 
ing to me (from August 1, 1862), and if you do not 
want it, draw it for her. I wrote to you about this be- 
fore, but fear you have not received the letter; but 
should you have done so, please follow the directions 
in this. When you write to my wife, please inclose 
the letter under cover to Mr. William F. Cozzens (my 
uncle *), firm of Hull and Cozzens, St. Louis, and ask 
him to go, if he will, to the house and inquire for her. 
Should she have left (as she may have heard that I 

1 His mother's cousin, I believe. Uncle was an honorary title, 
conferred because of Mr. C.'s age. 

329 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

was dead), she may have gone to Wisconsin, her home ; 
but I do not remember the address there, but think 
Milwaukee. Will uncle please do what he can to find 
her? 

" My old claim against the Government I left, 
with power of attorney to collect, etc., in the hands of 
a lawyer, Mr. Henry, whose office was then on Chest- 
nut Street, near Planter 's Saloon, near Fourth Street, 
St. Louis. Will uncle please inquire for me, but do 
not trouble yourselves overmuch. The amount of 
claim $175. 

" But please do what you can for my poor wife, 
and take all the necessary expense from the pay. 

" Anticipating death or capture, I left a letter 
with a friend, J. Harry Wyatt, master 's mate, direct- 
ing my account and trunk to be sent to the address of 
Levi Cozzens; but difficulty of transportation, uncer- 
tainty, etc., may have delayed it. Either he, or you in 
his name, or attorney, will find all by writing, address- 
ing my friend as above, and J. Lewis, paymaster, 
'United States Gun-boat Essex, Mississippi River, via 
New Orleans. You might, if you see best, delay send- 
ing for anything but accounts and copy of my appoint- 
ment (left original papers in my room). Please pay 
(on board Essex) Dr. Rice $7; the gunner, Mr. Long, 
$1; third assistant engineer, Mr. Fletcher, $3, and 
possibly $5 or so in my (the ward-room) mess." 

The diary, or journal, parts of which follow this, 
330 



was written on foolscap paper. That it was not easy 
to obtain all the paper he wanted is plain from the 
use Spencer made of these five half-sheets. In some 
cases he has written from top to bottom; then from 
bottom to top, between the lines ; and has then crossed 
the pages by lines of writing that reach from end to 
end. Probably these papers form part of the package 
sent by Adjutant Sprague from the headquarters of 
the Second Brigade, Third Division, Fifteenth Army 
Corps, on July 18th, 1863. 

" March 3d, 1863. Choose, will you take spiritual 
comfort, manner of living, self-denial in this life, and 
obey God, trust Him, follow His teachings in your 
heart, and diligently search for them in His word, 
and by prayer? 

" Will you rest content to be whatever God makes 
you with that He gives you, and that He commands 
you to do? 

" If you will, decide for this day, and call Him 
to witness and help. 

' ' But if, at any time, you feel indisposed so to do ; 
dissatisfied with His comforts, rewards, or laws, break 
off from all at once and enjoy this life. Your eter- 
nity will be passed in hell. 

" But do not fail to remember you are already 
bound by numberless solemn oaths to continue in His 
service forever. So flinch not. Decide, and act as 
you decide. 

331 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" Remember, God has given help this day by spe- 
cial Providence. When the poorer book was taken 
away unread, the seeming loss was instantly supplied 
by a better. 

" March 4th. I do humbly, and with thanks to 
God, acknowledge grace this morning inclining my 
heart to love His ways, and also to wish that I may 
love them from better, purer motives. 

' ' I do humbly pray that God will this day enable 
me to choose His way from pure motives and a sincere 
heart; also that He will give me strength to do His 
holy will and be patient and contented in my prison ; 
and that He will give me a disposition to love and 
honour Him, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. 

' ' March 5th. May my Saviour look with pity and 
compassion upon him who, choosing His ways and ser- 
vice in feebleness of heart, asks help, that he may be 
enabled to love the duty as well as the end : and asks 
that He would enable him to seek no other happiness 
than that of God 's smile upon a clear conscience. 

" March 8th. On this beautiful spring morning, 
in humble thankfulness for comfort in the supply of 
every want of nature and for God's peace and a con- 
tented heart, I yield Hun all again in love and grati- 
tude, desiring such happiness only as it shall please 
Him to give, which, by His blessing, does not fail to 
come in simple trust in Him. I thank God through our 
Lord Jesus Christ that I can say ' Accept me, Lord,

a prisoner in sin and iron, ' with unfaltering confidence 
in His mercy. . . . 

" March 9th. Weary with my own ignorance and 
weakness, and humbly praying my Father that He 
would teach me my neediness and depravity and give 
me true repentance, I would fain renounce striving by 
other than prayer, and leave myself in the hands of 
my Great Master, trusting the Saviour and His merits, 
and longing that He will enable me to trust in Him 
alone. 

" March llth. Have been at once taught and 
pleased by the reading of the works sent me by Mr. 
Crane. ... In such a place as this it is peculiar- 
ly difficult to know the state of the affections, and I am 
enabled with strongest efforts only, and by great help 
from above, I trust, to keep up any interest in spiritual 
things. No wonder then I count as a great mercy new 
thoughts in books, but, especially, reviving grace 
through them. But He who gives rain to the just and 
unjust has not placed me where I cannot grow in 
grace, and I can at least try to be patient and content- 
ed, and pray ' may God keep alive His own work for 
Christ's sake.' 

" March 12th. How thankful I am (and I never 
before understood how great a blessing it is) that so 
much of the time, with me more than a third, is passed 
in sleep. Daylight fades in my little cell at 6 p. M., nor 
am I (after the great weariness, combined of solitude 

333 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

and constant mental exertion, with so little variety) 
able to refrain from rest at or before eight. 

" In the morning light enough to see by must be 
the signal to recommence. I am too often weary by 
the feverish dreams of the past night. Last night, I 
thank God, He gave me rest, and this morning I en- 
tered fresh upon the duties of the day. Perhaps it is 
not altogether right (or maybe so but in some way 
I do not understand), but faith seems to come again, 
renewed by rest of mind, whereas my days of greatest 
darkness (when I have not known other causes) al- 
most always follow feverish nights. My mind, dwell- 
ing so long thus upon the needful and best of Christian 
thoughts, seems literally to exhaust itself upon those 
subjects, so that, when I think upon them during the 
day following, my thoughts and feelings are as stiff- 
ened muscles, and unable to give comfort or utility. 
Then there is a reaction, almost blankness of despair 
(yet heaven seeming to stand secure in the distance), 
inability for present duty pressing sore upon the mind ; 
for, hope and love, and almost faith, alike exhausted, 
surely it is God's mercy that allows duty to maintain 
its ground. 

' ' March 13th. ... I am praying God to send 
His servant, His minister, with the words of Christ. 
. . . I am convinced that a better life may be led 
under a certain degree of temptation than here (in 
subduing sin because here it is not so easily seen).

SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

Still, I know that it must be grace that saves any- 
where ; so I thank God for all that it is as it is and 
implore Him to accept and keep me, through Jesus 
Christ, our Lord. 

' ' March 15th, Sunday. I think, when a man is in 
prison and a minister of God comes and preaches, un- 
sought and unexpected, such a kind and encouraging 
sermon as the one I have just heard, he may justly re- 
cord it as a special Providence from a kind Master. 
. . . I have been much strengthened and cheered 
by God 's blessing upon the good word. . . . Dur- 
ing most of last week I was praying that he would 
visit me with teaching this day (though I expected it 
from another source), which He has done. . . . 
Later. My Father in heaven, in His manifold mercy 
and goodness, was pleased to hear my prayers, and 
sent Mr. Crane, the clergyman, to see me. Although I 
could only pray for him to be sent, and was not able 
to send him word, yet God sent him. Is it not truly 
a special Providence? When I remember his good 
teachings and how troubled I have been the past week 
without them (especially as to repentance and pre- 
sumption), . . . and how greatly I longed for 
comfort and a kind word from a fellow-Christian, I 
see yet more cause to thank God and love Him more. 

" So, by His blessing, it has been an exceedingly 
pleasant Sabbath to me. . . . 

" Monday, March 16th. A day of peace and com-

fort, thus far, by God's goodness. May He continue 
His kindness unto His servant, and keep him from 
pride, and make him watchful, humble of heart, and 
holy, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, for Christ's 
sake. 

" March 17th. In peace, in God's way. . . . 

" March 20th. Feverish night annoyed by ver- 
min, poor rest, consequently somewhat disposed to 
weariness and dejection. But I thank God that, after 
a few words from His good Book and prayer, telling 
Him how poor and weary I was, He was pleased to for- 
give the despondency, and, by His grace, give me bet- 
ter strength than even comes from rest in sleep 
namely : He let me lean upon Him and comforted me 
by instruction from His good Word. I have read the 
passage many times before, but never before found 
comfort from it. Thanks be unto God. 

' ' March 21st. Much refreshed this morning by a 
good rest during the night. . . . 

" March 22d. God's minister gave us poor pris- 
oners a very good sermon this morning from the words, 
' Take heed how ye hear, ' of which his remarks upon 
hearing with prejudice, and hearing for our neigh- 
bours, were applicable to myself. May God correct 
these faults in me. 

' ' Evening. God has been pleased to hear my pray- 
ers this time also, and, although I hardly thought to 
see him, sent His minister. I trust, with my Lord's 

336 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

blessing, his visit has done me good, besides greatly 
comforting me. . . . 

" March 24th. God is very good, and I grow but 
little better notwithstanding His mercy. May He for- 
give my weariness of soul for it is hard to help long- 
ing for a sight of a human face and the sound of a 
human voice. Mr. Crane is the only one, except the 
men about the prison, that ever is allowed to come near 
me (excepting military men at long intervals) ; and 
my soul longs, beyond utterance, for society; yet I 
know that God is my friend, and my Saviour near, and 
so may God make me not only patient and contented 
but grateful, for Jesus' sake. . . . 

" March 28th. ... There is a man here sen- 
tenced to be shot next Tuesday. It is said he curses 
fearfully. . . . The chaplain visited me for a few 
moments this afternoon. As before, God taught me, 
by intercourse with my fellow-man, of my great wick- 
edness at heart this time in the matter of pride. May 
it please Him to give me a more humble heart, like my 
Saviour's, for His sake. 

" March 29th, Sunday. Preaching this morning 
by the chaplain, from Philippians iv, 13. May it please 
the Lord Jesus Christ to strengthen me, for I have been 
cast down all day with an unutterable sense of loneli- 
ness and weariness ; and to help me that I murmur not. 
If God ever sets me free to live in the world I hope and 
pray He will make me remember, every Sunday after- 

337 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

noon at least, to visit those in prison. If Christians 
but knew, as Paul did, the feelings of those shut up in 
prison, they would remember more often those ' in 
bonds.' There is no such commentary upon those 
words as the actual bitterness of confinement. If God 
gives me liberty may He make me remember 
it. . . . 

" March 31st. The poor man spoken of above, to 
be shot this day, was accordingly executed this morn- 
ing. I know not how soon that, or a worse fate, may 
be my own ; yet God has mercifully given me seven 
months' respite. Oh ! that, by the blessing of His spir- 
it, His goodness may lead me into an unfeigned re- 
pentance, for Christ's sake. 

" April 1st. ... I am thankful that to want 
to be saved, from the fear of hell alone, is not wrong 
but I have hardly thought of that, having earnestly 
desired admittance into heaven. I want to bear the 
yoke am not only willing but anxious to bear and 
by God's grace will make strong trial to do so. . . . 
Was visited this morning for an hour or more by the 
chaplains of the post and this place. Our talk was 
much controversial, but so by choice, and was, I trust, 
by God 's blessing, both cheering and instructive to me. 
They promised to come again. 

" April 2d. Last evening my mind was much 
elevated by meditation upon God 's word, and I found 
his promises and teachings brought to mind and ap- 

338 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

plied in a most unusual manner as indeed was the 
case all day yesterday. I feel that all the seven months 
(to-day) passed in this place have really been em- 
ployed as Mr. Crane says, by God's beginning a good 
work in me. May He grant it be so, and carry it on 
until He finish it, for Christ's sake! 

" Evening. God has taught me, more and more, 
so that I cannot express my thankfulness. In rest, in 
peace, with no fear of death before my eyes, I have 
been taught this afternoon as never before, taught to 
see the self-righteousness in my scruples and fears 
taught to see that God will accept me, in Christ, as one 
that never had sinned; and so, afterwards, sanctify 
me. Truth I have found of which I would not be 
robbed even by liberty ! Happy prison ! Used by God 
to turn my feet into ways of peace. I have tried to 
read, as one who feels, the 103d Psalm of David for 
a thanksgiving. 

" April 3d. ... I do not have ten minutes' 
conversation (scarcely ever) in a whole day, yet I am 
not able to keep my foolish tongue. . . . May it 
please God to reform me. 

" April 4th. Being quite unwell and weak yester- 
day, I acknowledge, with thankfulness, God's mercy 
in grateful, restoring sleep and rest. I understand 
that the chaplain of the prison has been inquiring into 
my case, and that there will (or may) be an investiga- 
tion in a week or so. I did not ask him to do so, but 

339 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

he inferred it would be a favour from my language. 
It was a foolish, complaining word, and by it God may 
bring soon my condemnation or my release. I have 
prayed, and trust He will forgive me, for the Saviour's 
sake. . . . 

" April 5th. There was preaching this morning, 
but the delivery was so poor that prejudice almost, if 
not entirely, spoiled all but the text, part of which was, 
' And whosoever will, let him take the water of life 
freely.' I do not know what to do, but to pray and 
strive against the continual besetting of this sin. May 
God help me, for my Saviour's sake. 

' ' God looked upon me in pity this afternoon, and 
sent Mr. Crane, whose kindness and comforting words 
greatly helped me. 

" I have been much desponding, and the news he 
brought me, that my trial is not far off, does not dis- 
courage but rather comforts me. I feel almost as if 
I could choose death. 

" He also brought me two volumes to read. One 
was Beza's Latin Testament. Have been studying 
Latin some little time. . . . 

" April 6ih, Monday. Awoke this morning, by 
God's blessing, refreshed for study. One of the pris- 
oners, upon the opening of my cell for breakfast, 
lent me a book greatly to my mind Sacred History 
of the World, by Turner. Have heard of it, and longed 
for it, but little thought to get it in such a place. 

340 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

. . . This is the second book lent me by this man 
a convict. ... I pray God to repay him with 
the knowledge of my Saviour, for that Saviour's 
sake. 

" April 7th. The prison-keeper took my bed out 
and aired it thoroughly. It needed this very much, 
being very damp and mouldy. I have rarely been 
blessed with such health, and try to do what I can to 
preserve it. I have heard an encouraging rumour of 
my own case, but know nothing certain. . . . 

". . . April 8th. My attention was much taken 
by the first three verses of the Forty-first Psalm. 
Those two men who have most ' considered ' me in my 
trouble have both been near to death. Yet ' the Lord 
hath preserved them and kept them alive. ' And truly 
God heard my prayers for them, for I could do naught 
but pray. May He yet reward them, and richly, with 
mercy from on high, for His sake who was kind unto 
us all. 

"April 9th. I surely should acknowledge how God, 
during these seven months in which I have been a close 
prisoner, has provided for my temporal wants. Some 
two months since, when my boots were worn out by the 
constant walking in my little cell, one of the prisoners 
gave me, for their remains the legs a pair of shoes. 
It was unasked and unsought, and I could but remem- 
ber how, when before I had asked what I should do, 
faith said, ' The Lord will provide.' And with the 
23 341 



shoes, when the want was made for socks, He sent, by 
the kindness of the prison-keeper and Mr. Crane, two 
pairs. And now, after these many months of wear, 
my clothes beginning to fail, by the kindness of these 
same men He has sent two shirts and two pairs of 
drawers. Surely, since I have been here, God's com- 
ments upon His own word are wonderful; and this 
time the text is, Matthew vi, 33, 34. ... 

" The days, passed in hard and constant study 
with a few minutes ' exercise each hour, go very swiftly 
and pleasantly. . . . 

" April 12th. The past week, by continual appli- 
cation to study and God 's blessing of a cheerful and 
contented mind, has gone swiftly, and, I trust, profit- 
ably. . . . 

" The chaplain of the prison preached this morn- 
ing from James i, 12. It was very plain and pointed, 
and well suited to the place. . . . Mr. Crane 
promised to visit me last week, but as he did not come 
I am looking for him to-day. May God send him. 
. . . Evening. Have passed a day of rest, and, I 
trust, by God's blessing, of profit. Have not been vis- 
ited by any one, and have spent the time mostly in 
self-examination, meditation, prayer, and reading 
God's Word and the good books He has sent me suit- 
able for Sabbath reading. 

" Have commenced studying the Scriptures by fol- 
lowing out copious references of Scott's Commenta- 

342 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

ries, and by thus having a good means of occupation, 
have, by God's blessing, been kept from despond- 
ency. . . . 

" April 15th. Captured eight months ago to-day. 
It has been, by God's mercy, a glad captivity to me. 
He has put into my hands a way (I trust and pray He 
may bless it) to send unto my friends, which at least 
I shall try to do. . . . 

" April 19th, Sunday. Another week has gone, 
and (let it be written unto God's praise) with such 
cheerful content and happiness as I have rarely, if 
ever, had. . . . Evening. Mr. Crane made me a 
very cheering and pleasant visit this afternoon of an 
hour or more, comforting me greatly, and, I trust, 
teaching me. His kindness has greatly cheered me, in 
my whole confinement. May God be as good to him ! 
He made me many cheering offers of little comforts so 
pleasant to think of here, and has promised some more 
books, among others a Greek grammar, for I want to 
read the Testament in the original. . . . 

" April 20th. Was visited this afternoon by the 
chaplain of the prison, and we had an animating and 
pleasant conversation, or discussion, for an hour and 
a half. I was much entertained and cheered by his 
visit; but in our discussion ' too often forgot sober- 
ness. ' I want to try, by God 's help, to avoid discussion 
and argument with older Christians, and pray that 
God will forgive mine intemperance in speech, and help 

343 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

me to seek teaching, and not discussion. I do humbly 
thank Him for sending me the comfort of a Christian 
friend in my prison, through the Lord Jesus. ' 

" April 21st. Received to-day, from Mr. Crane, 
the loan of a Greek grammar, a large work on our 
Lord's parables, and another on the Passion of Christ. 
His wife also sent a very fine, large bouquet of flow- 
ers, which fill my eyes with pleasure for I have not 
seen any green plants for nearly eight months not 
even a blade of grass and they fill my cell with per- 
fume. . . . 

" April 26th. ... On Friday, by permission 
of the superintendent, I was allowed to pass nearly 
two hours outside of my cell, although not at liberty 
to walk around. I found myself greatly weakened by 
imprisonment. The chaplain of the prison preached 
this morning on ' Repentance.' I am expecting, or 
rather hoping for, a visit from Mr. Crane longing 
greatly for the cheer of his kind words. . . . 

" April 29th. Mr. Crane did not come, as I ex- 
pected, but I lack not kindness from God. Since Sun- 
day the weather has been very cool, which is peculiar- 
ly a mercy in a close cell like mine. I had another op- 
portunity afforded me to-day of sending news home, 
which I thankfully used. But none of them is in any 
way sure only probable or possible. I have the loan 
of a magazine with some very instructive articles, 
which I hope to have both pleasure and profit in read- 

344 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

ing. Time since Sunday passed in diligent study of 
Latin, Greek, and the Scriptures, in cheerfulness and 
content. . . . 

" May 3d. Another week gone with nothing out 
of the usual prison routine but the excitement of out- 
side news and the cheerful prospect of getting a letter 
from home gone mostly in patient content, waiting 
upon God and studying diligently Latin, Greek, and 
the Good Book. Received a momentary visit from a 
gentlemanly appearing doctor this morning, who gave 
me some diarrhoea medicine, or, rather, approved some 
already given by the prison-keeper. Expect to-mor- 
row a change of cell, for the better, I hope, which I 
asked for about a week since. On account of interest 
in the study of the Greek, was much annoyed by its 
obtruding upon my worship, so that my conscience 
told me it was wrong such inordinate affection and 
for one or two days it troubled me much ; but I thank 
God, through the Lord Jesus, I got help partially to 
overcome it. ... To-day the chaplain preached a 
sermon from I John iii, 9, from the first clause of the 
verse to establish the doctrine that Christians may 
become sinless or wholly sanctified (as I understood 
him) ; as, also, that he who is born of God may yet per- 
ish in sin. We held a very pleasant argument, in good 
will, about both subjects, some two weeks since and 
the sermon to-day bore much on my objections. I cer- 
tainly thought the passage was strong for the other 

345 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

side of both questions, nor was I at all con- 
vinced. . . . 

" Evening. The day is gone by without any visit 
from Mr. Crane, 1 as I had hoped. . . . Have just 
received a present of a beautiful, fragrant bouquet, 
for which I do humbly thank God, through my Sa- 
viour. ' ' 

Here Spencer's journal written at Jackson abrupt- 
ly ends. On May 1st General Grant gained a decisive 
victory over the Confederates near Port Gibson. On 
the 8th of May the junction of Sherman's forces with 
the main army that was operating against Vicksburg 
was effected near the Big Black River, and the whole 
of Grant's army rapidly marched toward Jackson, 
where Joseph E. Johnston, one of the ablest of the 
Confederate generals, was in command. On the 12th, 
the Confederates were again defeated at Raymond, 
south of west from Jackson; and on the 14th, after 
another severe defeat, the rebels were driven from the 
capital, which was seized by our army. After destroy- 
ing much public property there, Grant turned toward 
Vicksburg, which lies almost directly west of Jackson, 
fought in rapid succession, on the 16th and 17th, re- 
spectively, battles at Champion Hills and Big Black 

i After the war, in 1865, this faithful servant of Christ visited 
Spencer's parents, at Oswego, New York. At last his life was 
offered a sacrifice to brave ministrations to patients stricken with 
yellow fever. 

346 



SPENCER'S IMPRISONMENT 

River, and on the 19th of May his army, which had 
for two weeks depended upon the enemy's country for 
subsistence, gaining within that time at least five im- 
portant victories, thoroughly invested Vicksburg, and 
put itself into communication with the new base of 
supplies established by Admiral David D. Porter on 
the Yazoo River. Doubtless rumours of Grant's ap- 
proach reached the weary and worn prisoners confined 
in the penitentiary. Some inklings of the defeat suf- 
fered by the rebels on the first of May perhaps had 
come to Spencer. Hence the significance of the first 
sentence of the last entry made in the journal that of 
May 3d : ' ' Another week gone with nothing out of 
the usual prison routine but the excitement of outside 
news and the cheerful prospect of getting a letter from 
home." 

Poor Spencer ! Our army was having everything 
its own way, but he was not to share in its triumphs. 
Before the Federal general captured Jackson our gal- 
lant soldiers and sailors who had been imprisoned 
there were removed to Selma, Montgomery, and Rich- 
mond. 

Spencer had written, in April, to his " uncle," 
who lived in St. Louis. How the letter was sent, or 
when it was received (unless it be the one transmitted, 
with the foolscap pages of the Jackson journal, by 
officers of the Federal army, and received by Mr. 
Cozzens in August, 1863 ) , I am not able to say.

" A prisoner, JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, April 15, 1863. 
" DEAR UNCLE: I take the means God gives, 
thankfully (praying that He will bless them), to write 
to you and beg that you will please to let my friends 
know my situation. Tell them that I am in good 
health, by God's mercy, body and soul. Whether I 
shall see them or not again He knows ; but He does all 
things well. So tell them to be cheerful and to look 
unto Him. Let them know that I do not suffer for 
food, or clothing, or other necessaries of life and, 
whatsoever the result be, that God is good unto me. 
I have no prospects am scarcely sure of a day, but 
know nothing as to the termination of my imprison- 
ment. Tell them to look unto God for the result. Will 
you please visit 128 South Sixth Street, corner of Elm, 
and inquire after Mrs. Kellogg my wife? Give her 
this, my authorization to draw such of my pay as she 
needs. But please inquire if she wishes so to do ; and 
if so, will you direct her to some trustworthy lawyer ; 
but if she does not need the pay, send this as an au- 
thorization for the same to my Father. Tell my wife 
I would gladly have written to her, but thought surest 
to send thus. Speak kind words to her for me. My 
love unto my parents and friends. Tell all to pray to 
God for me, and to hope from Him only. . . .

authenticate the claim. S." 

There also remain to his friends copies, in his 
own handwriting, of what he calls ' ' Penitentiary Lit- 
erature ' ' verses some of which are no doubt original ; 
others, the composition of prisoners of war who had 
been there before Spencer's capture; and still others 
that were selected from various sources. I copy but 
one fragment, written by a convict : 

On Memory's sacred altar lies 

Each relic of my trust, 
But oh ! the idols that I loved 

Have crumbled into dust. 
And as I sit, with folded hands, 

Sad heart, and troubled brow, 
I think of what my life has been, 

And what that life is now.

CHAPTER XXXII 

CASTLE THUNDER 

FROM Jackson, just before the capture of that city 
by General Grant 's forces, Spencer and other captured 
Federal sailors and soldiers were taken, by way of 
Selma and Montgomery, to Richmond, Virginia. 

Captain James H. Sherman, of General L. C. 
Baker's " detective force," had been taken prisoner, 
and was confined in the " Hostage Room," in Castle 
Thunder, at the time of Spencer's commitment to the 
same gloomy abode. 

" It was the last of May, or the first of June," 
writes Captain Sherman, ' ' that four young men were 
put into the room where I was confined. ... I 
immediately noticed one a pale, care-worn, reserved 
man, heavily ironed, who enlisted my sympathy. 

' ' We soon removed his irons, learned his previous 
history in part, and welcomed them all to share in our 
misery. 

' ' Spencer and myself were soon fast friends. We 
were both held as spies, or such were the charges 
against us. The room was a large one, with eighty or 
ninety prisoners, so we had chance for a little exercise. 

350 



CASTLE THUNDER 

He enjoyed it very much, and soon regained spirits, 
flesh, and strength, and with these the hope of being 
delivered. . . . He also became partner in the 
manufacture of bone rings, buttons, tooth-picks, slides, 
and breastpins, and coarse and fine combs of horn. 
Being an expert at such work, he was able to live and 
to get many articles of needed food. Our prison fare 
was hardly sufficient to keep soul and body together. 

"At all proper times he was exhorting the prison- 
ers to be of good cheer, as our cause was that of right, 
and must triumph ; and also to look to, love, serve, and 
obey God, in whose hands our lives were. He was a 
Christian in every sense of the word, by precept and 
example, and had the most thorough knowledge of the 
Scriptures of any peison I ever saw. 

' ' He entered heartily into all our games and sports 
for exercise and recreation, and excelled in most." 

The letter given below, from Spencer to his sister, 
was the first one from Castle Thunder that found its 
way to his friends. Some unknown hand conveyed it 
through the lines, and it reached its destination only a 
few weeks before Spencer's final departure from the 
prison. Its discretion and reticence are heavy with 
the air of the valley of the shadow of death, through 
the bordering thickets of which Spencer was beating 
his way with cautious steps.

" "Pis a long time, dear Kitty, since I had an op- 
portunity of writing to you, or hearing from you. 
Over a year has passed since I have heard from any 
friends in the North, and in that time many great 
changes must have taken place at home, and wonderful 
ones to me. Over eleven months are gone since my 
capture, and yet no prospect of escape; and still, by 
God's goodness, I have profited much by the long 
confinement. I trust to His mercy, and have hope of a 
better life. Is not that great gain ? Is not that pleas- 
ant news ? God has blessed me with enough of clothes, 
good books, and many comforts, during my imprison- 
ment, through the kindness of the friends He has 
raised up for me. Thank Him, dear Kitty, for me, as I 
do thank Him. I cannot conceive what great changes 
may have taken place at home. How are Father and 
Mother ? Is Grandfather alive ? Are you well ? How 
is Rock ? Tell me in whose care to write when address- 
ing you or Father. 

" I want you to write to me, addressing S. K, pris- 
oner at Castle Thunder, Richmond, Virginia, mention- 
ing no titles, and but little besides the straight answer 
of the questions I ask, mentioning no surnames, neither 
anything relating to my capture or release, except- 
ing to let me know when and how you heard of it. 
I sent you some money home about a year since (in 

352 



CASTLE THUNDER 

August or July). Did you receive it? You mustn't 
mention amount. Your letter to me must be inclosed 
in one to H. B. Todd, Provost Marshal, Washington, 
District of Columbia. Mention all the notes you have 
received from me for a month, or a year dates, but 
not places. You must send this, as all my other letters 
when you all have read them, to my wife, to whom I 
have written, but fear she may have changed her ad- 
dress, since so long a time has passed. Address Mrs. 

Mary K , No. 128 South Sixth Street, corner 

Elm Street, St. Louis, Missouri. I wish she would 
write to me, and then send the letters, to be inclosed 
as above, to me. Of course you know the letter to me 
must be open, and nothing very private need be writ- 
ten. And now, be all of you of good cheer. I am in 
our Father's hands, and He doeth all things well. 

" I send love and fondest wishes to my wife, and 
to you all. I long to see you ; if God be willing, I yet 
may. Pray for me, dear ones, that God may deal ten- 
derly with us, and that body and soul we may be His. 
Speak to all for me kindly. I shall write to you all as 
often as I can. If you can, send me a few United 
States stamps, as they are very difficult to obtain here. 
Write always on large sheets, leaving half empty. 
Write very often, for many of the letters may fail.

" CASTLE THUNDER PRISON, 
" RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, Aug. 4, 1863. 

' ' DEAR PARENTS : I have often tried to write to 
you, but do not know with what success, but I mean to 
write often, and wish you to do the same with me, and 
I hope often to cheer you. I have been well, by God's 
blessing, both in body and mind, and, although it is a 
hard place to live a Christian life, I can but pray the 
more often and strive the harder. God blesses me 
with good health and sufficient to eat and wear, but 
still it is a weary life at the best, and I have spent 
nearly a year at it. What the result will be I cannot 
tell. It is safe in God's hands, and I do not fear. 
There is no evidence against me, the officers say, nor 
do I think they can get any. I have a sufficiency of 
good books, and am pretty comfortable. I gave you 
some directions how to write, both in a letter to Kitty 

and in one to Uncle C , at St. Louis. But you will 

find better ones in print in the Northern papers. I 
wrote once or twice to Washington, last month, about 
my own case, and have been writing to the New York 
Herald about us all; you may see it. Be contented 
about me do not worry, but pray for me. God is 
good, and has saved my life, as by a miracle, thus far. 
Take courage. Thank Him for me that He has given 
me a knowledge of a better life ; may He grant us grace 
to continue in it. I know not what to think about my 
poor wife about you all, for it is over a year since I

have heard a word about you. May God take care of 
you and her, and be kind to you all. Write often, for 
many may fail to come. Love to all. Send this to my 
wife. God bless you.

The above letter (of August 4th, 10th, 15th, 1863) 
did not reach his parents until February, 1864. 

"CASTLE THUNDER, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, Sept. 18, 1863. 
" DEAR KITTY, MY SISTER: After lying in prison 
over a year, my time has come at last. To-day I went 
out for trial, but got it deferred until to-morrow. The 
witnesses are there, and there can be but one result, 
death. So I have written to you for all, to bid you a 
last good-bye. God bless you. I have tried to write 
often to cheer all, and it seemed very hopeful for a 
while, but within a few days all hope has left me. But 
don't mourn, Kitty, as for one without hope. These 
only take away the mortal life, but God, I trust, has 
given me one that is immortal. Dear Kitty, I hope 
there is a ' shining shore ' for us all, and another world 

355 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

where, free from guilt, we'll no more sorrow, or part. 
I do not look forward with fear to death not nearly 
as much as when it was farther off. God has been very 
kind to me, and for the past twelve months I have tried 
earnestly to please Him. I fear the embarrassment of 
the trial, to-morrow, the worst, but He will help me, 
I trust. 

' ' I have some little trinkets ; you must divide them. 
The ring is for my wife ; if she be not found, for your- 
self. Take comfort now, dear ones, God is good, and 
naught shall separate us from Him. I have hoped and 
longed, indeed, to see you all ; but I know His wisdom 
chooses better ; let us be content. Thank Him that all 
this time He has given me life and health and a heart 
to love Him, and to trust in Christ. Much as I long to 
see you all, I know 'tis best as it is, for He doeth all 
things well. So do not mourn, but hope and think 
of heaven, where I hope, by God's mercy, to await 
you all. 

' ' I would ask Father, or, if he cannot attend to it, 
Uncle Cozzens, at St. Louis, to act as lawyer for my 
wife, and draw my pay. Tell him to invest in United 
States six per cent bonds, 1 of which the principal is 
to remain untouched, the interest, only, being drawn. 

1 This indicated, clearly, his confidence in his country, his 
assurance that the rebellion would be quelled. He had heard, we 
must believe, of the great National victories at Gettysburg and 
Vicksburg, and had seen something of the interior of the " Con- 
federacy " that " empty shell." 

356 



CASTLE THUNDER 

This he will please attend to for my wife. At her 
death the principal will be Fred's. I hope I have only 
to ask this, and that you will do as I have asked, for 
my sake, when I am gone. My clothes are my Father's 
or Freddy's. Whoever acts as I have asked, for my 
wife, will pay himself for the trouble from the money. 
All my papers at Osawatomie destroy without reading, 
except the cipher manuscript, which, if you can de- 
cipher, you may find interesting. So now, I suppose, 
I am through with business. I want you all, my dear 
sister, not to mourn for me as one lost. Do not grieve 
God by immoderate grief for me, but look forward, all 
of you, to heaven, where I hope to go, and think of 
your brother there the brother that you loved and 
let it draw out many longings for that ' holy land.' 
Watch always against grieving Him, who is so kind 
and good, by any sin ; but try by pleasing and by lov- 
ing Him to be always in sunshine. Think often of me 
and of God's mercy and kindness to me, and never for- 
get ' He loved us, and gave Himself for us. ' Oh ! love 
God, Kitty, love God, dear ones, for He has been very 
good to me ; and may He grant we may meet in heaven, 
for Christ's sake. Good-bye! 

" SPENCER KELLOGG." 

" IN PRISON, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, Sept. 19, 1863. 
" DEAR WIFE : I do earnestly long to see you once 
before I die, but we must not complain, for God has 
24 357 



done it, and this good Book says, ' He doeth all things 
well.' My dear, dear love, if you would please him 
whom you once loved so dearly, and if his last and 
dying wish is sacred to you, read this good Book; 1 read 
it every day ; think about it ; pray God to teach you, 
by it, the way to heaven. Oh ! dear pet, if you would 
meet me in that beautiful and happy land, remember 
what I tell you, for I hope soon to go there. My heart 
has often longed to be with you, as I have read this 
Book, and I have wanted to tell you how good and kind 
our heavenly Father is ; but he has seen best I should 
not go to see you any more here ; so I will hope to meet 
you in heaven. Oh I my darling, do not grieve for me 
as one that is lost, but think often of me, and try to 
meet me above. We had happy hours together, dar- 
ling ; God grant they be not the last. I do so long that 
I might once more see you ; but it may be our Father in 
heaven will let them take my life here, where I could 
not see you, so that you would more often think of me 
in the better world, and try to come there to me. Oh ! 
darling, do not fret against God, nor murmur, but re- 
member His goodness, and hope. 

' ' I have asked my Father or my uncle to see to the 
money that I left for you. I hope you will be pleased.

your time well : do not forget the better world ; and, 
darling, do not forget I was every day praying for 
you. God bless you, my wife, and take care of you. 
I pray for you that He will give you every good thing 
that you may need, and that He will comfort you, and 
give you a heart to love Him, and make you His child. 
It is a happy thing to love God, darling, for He com- 
forts and loves His children. He will always take care 
of you, if you trust in Him, and you will never feel so 
lonely and desolate but that you can have a Friend and 
kind Father. I sorrow for you, pet, for I know that 
you will be very lonely and sad. I know how bad 
how hard will be your grief ; 1 but, darling, remem- 
ber what I tell you; when your heart seems bowed 
down and broken, when you have not a friend left 
in the world, then pray to Christ, who is a kind 
and good Friend, always near do not forget, but re- 
member and love Him better than ever you loved me. 
I hope to go to Him, dear wife, and will ask Him for 
you to give you a holy and loving heart toward Him. 
But don't trust in me, but in Him. Good-bye, darling ! 
What shall I say more? How shall I comfort you? 
I always loved you, dear one, and love you to the 
last; let it comfort you. I love you; and now, dear 
wife, if you love me do not forget my last wish, but 
read this good Book, especially the New Testament, 

1 His wife was disconsolate, inconsolable, during all the months 
of his imprisonment.

very often, and may God teach you. Let no one, or 
anything, make you forget it, or put it off. If you 
love me, darling, try to come to me. Good-bye ! God 
bless you ! 

" YOUR HUSBAND." 

Spencer now believed that his time was short. In 
this season of trial his Christian faith, courage, tender- 
ness, and unselfishness, shone with peerless lustre. His 
words and conduct give evidence of the surpassing 
sweetness of his spirit, the victory of his faith. Here, 
on my table, lies a dilapidated copy of the Christian 
Review, No. XCII, April, 1858. Spencer had it 
in Castle Thunder. He pored over it many an hour. 
Its articles are such as these : Character and Literary 
Influence of Erasmus; Religious Persecutions in Vir- 
ginia; James Montgomery; Qualifications for the 
Lord's Supper. 

Beginning on the margin of the first page of the 
article on Religious Persecutions in Virginia, running 
through that and the article on Montgomery, and end- 
ing upon the first page of a paper on Congregational 
Singing, is this letter : 

' ' DEAR FATHER : I must write to you, to comfort 
you all ; and, although I have written to my wife and 
Kitty, which letters you can read, still this I will send 
to Mother and yourself. Yesterday (Monday, 21st 

360 



CASTLE THUNDER 

September, 1863) was one week since I received inti- 
mation of my trial, which, I was well aware from the 
commencement, could only result in one way. Since 
that time I have been making my little preparations 
for death. The greater one, that of my soul, I trust 
was long since made, through the mercy of God my 
Saviour. I am a very different one, my Father, now, 
from the lad that left you in 1860, to work on a farm 
near by. Since that day, your son has borne many 
a hardship, and been blessed by God with many a bless- 
ing. After a month or more of wandering, on the 7th 
of January, 1861, I regularly enlisted in the United 
States Army. From there 1 I went to Newport Bar- 
racks. Here, after a sickness in which I was much re- 
duced, and after restoration to health by a merciful 
God, who was not willing that I should die * without 
hope and without God in the world,' I was sent to 
Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, via St. Louis. I was at 
Newport Barracks about three weeks. My stay at the 
last place was short, some ten days or two weeks, and 
unmarked by much of notice except my acquaintance 
being formed with a fellow-soldier, an Irishman named 
'Connell, with whom I associated most of the time as 
an intimate companion during my service as a soldier. 
' ' We were next sent to St. Louis Arsenal, at a time 
when the Government was making most strenuous 
efforts to save that place from the Secessionists of Mis- 
1 St. Louis, I presume. 

361 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

souri. Although most of the time was passed in idle- 
ness, yet it was somewhat interspersed with most 
fatiguing labour at the sand-bag fortifications and 
earthworks. While there I was present at the attack 
and capture of Camp Jackson. Here, also, Mother 
visited me, and I saw Lily. 1 Soon after, we were 
moved from the arsenal to the lower city, to guard 
against outbreaks ; and here I made the acquaintance, 
first, of my wife. However, at this time I had hardly 
ever conversed with her. It was in June, I think, that 
our company was ordered to Springfield, and I took 
leave of a sweetheart (not my wife), promising to 
marry her on my return. During that campaign the 
company endured many hardships, from most of 
which, as well as from the monotony of a life under 
guard in time past, at St. Louis, I escaped by a posi- 
tion half-servant, half-clerk to Captain Sweeney. At 
Springfield I was made commissary-sergeant to Major 
Mudd, division commissary, and by this means I did 
not take part in the battle of Wilson's Creek, where 
Lyon was killed. After the retreat to Rolla, I lost my 
occupation, but the major retained me some three or 
four weeks longer, and I was eventually left in his care 
by my captain, who went East on a sick leave from St. 
Louis, to recover from a wound received in the late 
battle. 

"At St. Louis, after my return, I was paid in gold

CASTLE THUNDER 

for four months' service, very little of which, I am 
sorry to say, was not spent in dissipation' my first 
dissipation. Here I first made the intimate acquaint- 
ance of my wife, who loved me with an affection I but 
poorly repaid. Nothing she could do for me seemed 
to her too much if I would only love her. Sensitive, 
deeply affectionate, too proud to tell a trouble to any, 
she never had a confidante that I know of ; and, after 
becoming acquainted with me, seemed to have no pleas- 
ure but in my society. I did not repay that love then, 
although I loved her deeply ; but, since, I have learned 
to think upon it, and to see its value. I came back 
from Holla to St. Louis at, or before, my birthday, 
August 17, 1861 ; for on that day I visited my uncle 
at his house in the environs of the city. On the 14th 
of September I was discharged from the regular ser- 
vice of the United States for the purpose of accepting 
the appointment of a first lieutenant of volunteers, 
and (although mustered again into service in this ca- 
pacity) because of some informality, and for other 
reasons, I was not able to hold the position, or obtain 
the pay. 

* ' Upon this, in the last days of October, I shipped 
in the gun-boat service, and was soon after transferred 
to the Essex, December 14th. After the expedition 
south, with the details of which you are well ac- 
quainted, I returned to St. Louis, and was there made 
master's mate, and afterwards fourth master of the 

363 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

Essex, which was then refitting. On the 14th of June, 
last year, after much debate in my own mind, shortly 
after I was promoted the second time, I married my 
wife, and for the few days we remained together I saw 
pleasure indeed, and learned much more than ever to 
respect her. I should not forget to say that a little 
while before this Mother passed through town, when I 
saw her a few days with Lily and Freddy. And let 
me here say to my Mother : Dear Mother, forgive, that 
I valued your company so little as I did; for I am 
ashamed to think of it. I have often thought, since, 
if God permitted me to see you again, how I would try 
to honour you, my parents ! But God has seen good 
that it should not be so ; so I can only ask, Forgive me, 
dear parents ; it may be, by God's mercy, I can honour 
you in heaven. 

" Before leaving St. Louis the last time (July 7, 
1862) I heard from Kitty, and a week after leaving, 
while at Cairo, I heard my last from my wife. Soon 
after, we ran the fiery gauntlet of the batteries at 
Vicksburg, where, with many other places, I must 
acknowledge God's mercy in sparing my life. After 
doing duty on the river below for some time, during 
which our boat had the engagement with the Arkansas, 
in which the latter was destroyed, I was taken, with 
a detached party of four seamen, at Port Hudson, and 
after being free on parole, as an officer, for some two 
or three weeks, was rearrested on these charges upon 

364 



CASTLE THUNDER 

which, last Saturday, I was tried. All the proceedings 
of the trial, I think, you can learn upon application to 
the United States Secretary of War, to whom, I am 
told, they will be sent. 

" So I have given you, dear Father, some brief ac- 
count of the vicissitudes and ventures of your son since 
he left home, a lad, in 1860. 

' ' Last month brought the anniversary of my birth- 
day, announcing me of age. I wrote you a long letter 
then, which I hope you have received. Since the day 
of my trial I have not yet heard my sentence, but I 
know my time on earth is short. I try to await with 
patience the result, hoping in the mercy of my Sa- 
viour. 

" On Sunday I spoke a few words to my fellow- 
prisoners, who were gathered together to worship God. 
It seemed to move them much as I first made known 
then the death I was expecting, and many besides my- 
self were in tears. May God bless it for good. On 
Saturday, before trial, I wrote to my wife, in my Bible 
(which I wish to go to her my Prayer-Book Kitty will 
keep), and to Kitty. Both will be brought to you by 
Mr. J. H. Sherman, a fellow-prisoner, as soon as he 
can do it. Yesterday (Monday) I saw a minister, Mr. 
Scandlin, who is going this morning North, on a flag- 
of -truce boat, and by him sent you a telegram to write 
immediately perhaps I may be able to hear from you. 

"Also, I sent by him some word to you, by a letter 
365 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

he will write you ; and some trinkets ; and a ring my 
wife gave me, to go to her again ; if she be not found, 
for Kitty or Mother to keep. Mr. Sherman will bring 
other trinkets made in prison. Also, the disposition I 
wish to be made of my pay I will say, shortly, it is to 
be drawn, and invested for my wife in United States 
bonds, of which the principal, during her life, is to 
remain untouched ; the interest will be turned over to 
her. After her death the principal will revert to Fred- 
dy. 1 I have given Mr. Sherman both written and 
verbal directions about it. I would be much pleased 
if they might be followed as nearly as practicable. 
You can also hear, by writing to him, any particulars 
concerning myself or trial. 

" Later. Sunday passed in comfort and hope in 
the mercy of God; in prayer, and such meditation as 
one could enjoy in a room where there were more than 
sixty persons; and religious conversation with some 
of the many good brethren confined with me. I look 
past the gloom of the dark valley, and find cheer in 
the hope of the better world. I thank God often that 
He has put me in prison, for here He has been pleased 
to teach me of Himself, as I do trust. 

' ' While I remember, I will tell you of a certain Dr. 
Wm. C. Crane, Episcopal clergyman of Jackson, Mis- 
sissippi, with whom I left a letter and some consider- 
able papers for you. I made mention of certain debts 
1 He never knew that a son was born to him in March, 1863. 

366 



CASTLE THUNDER 

owing to some of the officers of the Essex some ten 
or fifteen dollars, in all. Settle them, if you can, when 
the pay is drawn. 

" But I come back again. To-day (Tuesday) I am 
in expectation of hearing the sentence of death read to 
me, and of closer confinement, in a cell. But my Father 
in heaven, by His great mercy, inspires me with con- 
tinued peace of mind, and I rest in His mercy. Yester- 
day evening was an hour of great depression to me. 
I had heard some one of my fellow-prisoners describe 
the interest shown in his case by the United States 
Commissioner of Exchange, and I could not help feel- 
ing, ' How far are my friends from comforting me 
now ! ' All were interested in his story, and I walked 
by myself up and down the room, which we cannot 
leave, and thought of my loneliness. Oh ! my Father, 
' God's loving-kindness is better than life, ' and I would 
rather die here by this ignominious death, than be 
that man outside as yet of the mercy of God. I thank 
Him often, dear Father, that I have been brought to 
prison to learn Him and His mercy. 

"And now, Father, I know no better way of cheer- 
ing you than Christ took ' In my Father's house are 
many mansions ' let us hope to meet there. I would 
say to you as I did to Kitty : think of me as living, and 
waiting for you. Hoping ever in God's mercy, love 
Him better for His kindness unto me. Think of the 
many dangers in which He has preserved me safely, 

367 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

and at the last taught me the better way ; then hope 
for the rest of the children. It should greatly cheer 
and comfort you that God has taught, we trust, Kitty 
and myself, the two oldest ones, of Himself, and you 
should be the more trustful in Him, and the more com- 
forted in your troubles, by this. One thing remember, 
dear Father : ' Precious in the sight of the Lord is the 
death of his saints.' So do not forget it was infinite 
wisdom, guided by infinite mercy, that took me from 
the world so early. I had hoped, indeed, to live to 
comfort and help you; but God will choose His own 
means of supporting those whose bread and water He 
has promised ' shall be sure.' Do not, then, at any 
time, let your mind dwell upon the f earf ulness of the 
manner of my death ; but turn from it to the wonder- 
ful goodness of the Lord, who, when in the bitterness 
of my agony, more than a year since, I called upon 
Him to spare me until I could know that I was a 
Christian, was pleased to hear me, and granted me 
the whole year that is past wonderful instance of His 
goodness in answering prayer. 

" Cheer your souls then, my parents, with the 



thought of the marvellous goodness of God, and think 
often of paradise, where your son hopes to wait for 
you. Remember that ' the mercy of the Lord endureth 
for ever. ' So keep on praying for Rocky and the rest. 
"And now, dear Father, I pray God will bless you, 
and take care of you, and provide for you in your old 

368 



CASTLE THUNDER 

age. I had hoped to do it ; but now ' the Lord will 
provide.' God has everywhere raised up friends for 
me in prison ; surely for you, in a less difficult place, 
He can do the same. At Jackson, when I was in the 
deepest confinement, He caused me to be continually 
visited by His ministers, and comforted, cheered, and 
strengthened, very often. While I was travelling in 
irons, helpless, He remembered me, and I wanted 
neither help in my helplessness nor comfort in my 
heart. At Atlanta He raised me up friends in a won- 
derful manner. Travelling from there here very 
heavily ironed, He provided for me constant care. 
Since, I have had books in abundance, preaching al- 
most every Sabbath, and kind brethren always near. 

"Although the rations are small, I have rarely gone 
hungry, and most of the time, as now, have had money 
with me. Have always had plenty of clothes am 
one of the best provided for in the room. Yet when I 
was taken I had but one suit. So good has God been 
to me, and I have learned to trust in Him, and can say 
from experience, ' His promises are sure. ' Remember 
all this was where I could scarcely help myself at all, 
and you will see how great has been His goodness. 

" Wednesday. This morning, by some mistake, I 
was called out and sent up town, under care of a cor- 
poral, to attend some trial at the ' Hustings Court,' 
as a witness. Of course the errand was fruitless, but 
it gave me an opportunity, by God's mercy, to see the 

369 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

town and some of its sights, and I much enjoyed the 
walk in the fresh air." 

Thus abruptly ended this unsigned letter. Four 
years passed before his friends received it. The money 
of which Spencer speaks was generously given to him 
by Captain Sherman, who had received it from the 
Secretary of War. To the same friend he was in- 
debted, under God, for blankets and a warm cavalry 
overcoat. 

How near the end must have seemed to him when 
he wrote to his father and to his wife the letters, parts 
of which are given below : 

" CASTLB THUNDER, KICHMOND, VIRGINIA, Sept. 23, 1863. 

' ' DEAR FATHER : By permission, and through the 
courtesy of Captain Alexander, I am enabled to write 
you a few lines. 

' ' You, who have already heard from me in regard 
to my situation here, can, I trust, bear it when I tell 
you that my days on earth are soon to be ended. Last 
Saturday I was court-martialled, and this evening, a 
short time since, I received notice of my sentence by 
Captain Alexander, who has since shown me every 
kindness consistent with his duty. 

" Writing to my dear parents, I feel there can be 
no more comfort after such tidings than to tell you 
that I trust, by the mercy of our heavenly Father, to 
die the death of a Christian. . . . I do not fear to 

370 



CASTLE THUNDER 

go unto Him. I would love to see you all again. God 
saw best not. Why should we mourn ? Comfort your 
hearts, my dear parents, by thoughts of God's mercy 
unto your son, and bow with reverence beneath the 
hand of Him who ' doeth all things well.' ... I 
sent a ring to my wife by a clergyman on Monday last. 
I also sent a telegram to yourself, which will arrive too 
late, as the time of my execution is set for day after 
to-morrow Friday, September 25th. 

" Captain Alexander, commandant of the prison, 
deserves your respect and grateful remembrance for 
his kindness to your son in his last hours dear pa- 
rents, there are but few more left me. I will try to 
think of you. God bless and comfort you. Remember 
me kindly and respectfully to all my dear friends and 
relations. Tell Kitty I hope to meet her again. Take 
care of Freddy for me. Put him often in remembrance 
of me. 

" Dear Mother, good-bye! God comfort you, my 
Mother, and bless you with the love of happy children. 

' ' Farewell, my Father ! We meet again by God 's 
mercy. 

" SPENCER KELLOGG." 

' ' DEAR WIFE : ... It would please me much, 
and I think it might comfort you, if you would main- 
tain a correspondence with my sister. With a mutual 
sorrow, I wish you could love with a mutual love. 

371 



SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

' ' God bless you, my wife, and be with you to cheer 
you, for I feel that yours is a great sorrow. . . . 

" May God, who made us one, dear wife, not sep- 
arate us for ever, but grant that we may meet in His 
presence. Farewell, dear one ! God bless you. 
" Yours affectionately, 

" SPENCER KELLOGG."

CHAPTER XXXIII 

AD ASTEA PER ASPEBA 

" HAVE you seen the Evening Post? " Mr. Brown's 
friend in New York had gently asked him on the night 
of Mr. Brown's return from Washington. 

The newspaper contained a report of the execution 
of Spencer Kellogg. 

That night Commodore Porter and Spencer's 
father occupied the same room. There was little sleep 
for either. " Noble boy! " exclaimed Mr. Brown. 
" He was safe, not on earth, but in heaven. He died 
the day I left home. ' ' 

On September 30th Mr. Brown wrote: 

" KITTY: Our dear, noble boy is safe in heaven. 
. . . Go to Mother and stay till I come. May God 
sustain you ! YOUR FATHER. " 

The Reverend Mr. Carpenter, chaplain of Castle 
Thunder, whom Captain Sherman described as a 
" very kind and good young man," wrote to Spen- 
cer's grandfather the day after the execution, a letter 
valuable as the testimony of a Southerner. I am not 
surprised to learn from it that Spencer did not, in his 
last days, regard with approbation anything in his 
* ' secret service ' ' that savoured of deceit.

SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

" RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, Sept. 26, 1863. 

" DEAR SIR: As it would afford you comfort, and 
because it was the request of Mr. Spencer Kellogg, I 
write you a statement of his treatment, etc., after his 
condemnation. He was found guilty as a spy by court- 
martial on Friday, 18th of September, and was exe- 
cuted on Friday, the 25th of September. He frankly 
confessed that he was a spy. 1 While he was at Castle 
Thunder he, with the others in his room, was allowed 
many privileges by Captain Alexander. They were 
placed in a spacious room, and were permitted to have 
the daily papers, books, and tracts, etc. Besides, they 
had a large number of tools, and manufactured combs, 
rings, and many other little valuables, which they were 
permitted to sell. . . .

him. . . . On the day before, and on the day of his 
execution, I was with him most of the time. He had the 
Bible and Baxter's Saints' Rest in the room with him," 
and read them when alone. He was much pleased with 
Saints' Best. His conversation the day previous to 
his execution was very interesting. He delighted to 
dwell on heavenly things, on the goodness of God dis- 
played in His providence and works. He spoke of the 
evidences of Christianity as being approved from the

was furnished with light.

of the deceptions he used (in his secret service), and 
would not do the same again, if he had his time to go

gave the Rev. Dr. Burrows a ring on his way to the 
scaffold, and also sent some money to one of his com-

SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

The Eev. Mr. Scandlin furnished Mr. Brown with 
an account of a service he held in Castle Thunder a few 
days before the execution of Spencer. 

" My access to the ' Hostage Boom,' which may 
seem strange to some, was owing to Masonic influence 
and to the great stir being made by the Sanitary Com- 
mission for our release. I pressed the point upon Cap- 
tain Alexander. 

" I never shall forget that Sabbath morning, or 
the thirsting souls that drank in the words of sym- 
pathy. Imagine the scene: the attic room of Castle 
Thunder perhaps seventy-five feet long by twenty 
wide containing about one hundred prisoners, men 
who had been literally shut out from God's world, 
many of them for more than twelve months ; knowing 
nothing of home or loved ones; guilty of no crime; 
suffering all things for love of country. It was there 
that I beheld the gems of patriotism, the silent and 
unknown martyr heroes of the nation. I felt this as I 
spoke to them of the deep consolation of our Christian 
faith its sufficiency for every conceivable condition 
* aye, for the suffering and sorrow of this day and this 
place.' Something in the marked attention of your 
son led me to single him out as a person of peculiar 
interest. 

' ' On the conclusion of the service they all flocked 
around to urge me to repeat it whenever opportunity 
occurred. A word from your son soon absorbed my 



AD ASTRA PER ASPERA 

attention. The others, knowing his condition, yielded 
him the whole time and shielded him from observation. 
The. facts communicated in the telegram and letter 
were given, the mementoes since transferred to your 
care were handed to me. Thought of himself was lost 
in all-absorbing interest for the dear ones at home. 
* Oh ! for one word from them before I die ! ' He was 
certain that the death penalty would be executed, and 
his fears of its speed were more than confirmed by 
hasty action. For himself , he said, * My peace is made 
with God. I yield my life a willing, cheerful sacrifice 
upon the altar of the nation. The risk I knew ; the re- 
sponsibility I took ; I will not shrink from the result. ' 
. . . I felt bound to him as a brother. His gen- 
tlemanly bearing, general intelligence, and unfalter- 
ing confidence in God made a lasting impression upon 
my mind." 

I give part of a full account of the execution, con- 
tained in the Richmond Whig of September 26, 1863, 
omitting only a few of the most painful particulars. 

" At eleven o'clock yesterday forenoon a detail 
of one hundred men under Captain Potts, from the 
City Battalion, marched from Castle Thunder with 
Spencer Kellogg, the recently condemned spy, in cus- 
tody. The cortege moved up Main Street in the fol- 
lowing order : 

" Drum corps on the right, followed by two com- 
panies of militia; hack containing the condemned 

377 



man, his spiritual adviser, Dr. Burrows, and Detective 
Capehart and another officer. The hack was closely 
guarded by mounted men, followed by two companies 
of infantry. The cavalcade reached the scene of exe- 
cution about half past twelve o'clock, where, as usual, 
a vast crowd of people, of both sexes and all ages, was 
congregated. . . . 

" Arrived under the gallows, Captain Alexander 
read the charges preferred against the accused and 
the sentence of the court-martial ' that he be hanged 
by the neck until dead.' 

' ' A short but impressive prayer was offered ; at the 
conclusion of which the condemned man, unaccompa- 
nied, mounted the scaffold. In a few moments Detect- 
ive Capehart followed and commenced to adjust the 
rope over the neck, ... in which he 1 assisted, all 
the while talking with the officer. Taking off his hat, 
to admit the noose over his head, he threw it 
to one side, and, falling off the scaffold, it struck a 
gentleman beneath, when the prisoner turned quickly, 
and, bowing, said, ' Excuse me, sir. ' After getting the 
rope on his neck arranged . . . Detective Cape- 
hart commenced to pinion the arms of the condemned, 
to which he submitted composedly, simply remarking, 
' Isn't this hard, captain ? ' His ankles were then tied 
together and his hat given to him. Capehart then 
shook hands and left him. A negro came on the scaf-

fold with a ladder and proceeded to fasten the rope 
to the upper beam, the prisoner meanwhile regarding 
him with the greatest composure. The rope being 
fastened, the negro was in the act of coming down, 
when the prisoner looked up at the rope and remarked, 
* This won't break my neck. 'Tisn't more than a foot 
fall. Doctor, I wish you would come up and ar- 
range this thing. I don't want to have a botched job 
of it. ' The rope was then rearranged to his satisfac- 
tion, and the cap placed over his head. The con- 
demned man then bowed his head and engaged a few 
seconds in prayer, at the conclusion of which he raised 
himself, and, standing perfectly erect, pronounced in 
clear voice, ' All ready! ' 

He was ready who, having his letters and jour- 
nals in mind, can doubt it? 

At the time of his death the Richmond newspapers 
described him as " prepossessing " in appearance, 
" five feet eight or nine inches high," " with spark- 
ling, bright blue eyes." 

So far the description was accurate ; but his hair, 
which they call sandy, was rich brown, and curled at 
the tips. 

His skin, from long confinement, had become as fair 
as a woman 's. The reporter conjectured that he was 
" about thirty-three years of age." He died on the 
25th of September, 1863, having attained his twenty- 
first year on the 17th of the preceding month.

SPENCER KELLOGG BROWN 

There was mourning for him in many parts of the 
land he was so loving and lovable. 

I need not speak of his mistakes and wanderings. 
The Good Shepherd knew how to bring him back to the 
shelter of His fold. 

Among the Confederates even were many who re- 
garded his execution as inexpedient and unjust. 

It is sad to reflect that his last letters to his pa- 
rents and his wife, and those written in the Bible and 
in the Christian Review, were not delivered into the 
hands of his relatives until his wife had lain more 
than two years in the grave. 

She never read those exquisitely tender adieus.

A Virginia Girl in the Civil War. 

Being the Authentic Experiences of a Confederate 
Major's Wife who followed her Husband into Camp at 
the Outbreak of the War, Dined and Supped with General 
J. E. B. Stuart, ran the Blockade to Baltimore, and was 
in Richmond when it was Evacuated. Collected and 
edited by MYRTA LOCKETT AVARY. izmo. Cloth, $1.25 
net ; postage additional. 

" The people described are gentlefolk to the back-bone, and the reader 
must be a hard-hearted cynic if he does not fall in love with the ingenuous 
and delightful girl who tells the story." Neva York Sun. 

" The narrative is one that both interests and charms. The beginning of 
the" end of the long and desperate struggle is unusually well told, and how 
the survivors lived during the last days of the fading Confederacy forms a 
vivid picture of those distressful times." Baltimore Herald. 

"The style of the narrative is attractively informal and chatty. Its 
pathos is that of simplicity. It throws upon a cruel period of our national 
career a side-light, bringing out tender and softening interests too little visi- 
ble in the pages of formal history." New York World. 

" This is a tale that will appeal to every Southern man and woman, and 
can not fail to be of interest to every reader. It is as fresh and vivacious, 
even in dealing with dark days, as the young soul that underwent the hard- 
ships of a most cruel war." Louisville Courier- Journal. 

" The narrative is not formal, is often fragmentary, and is always warmly 
human. . . . There are scenes among the dead and wounded, but as one 
winks back a tear the next page presents a negro commanded to mount a 
strange mule in midstream, at the injustice of which he strongly protests." 
New York Telegram. 

41 Taken at this time, when the years have buried all resentment, dulled 
all sorrows, and brought new generations to the scenes, a work of this kind 
can not fail of value just as it can not fail in interest. Official history moves 
with two great strides to permit of the smaller, more intimate events ; fiction 
lacks the realistic, powerful appeal of actuality ; such works as this must be 
depended upon to fill in the unoccupied interstices, to show us just what 
were the lives of those who were in this conflict or who lived in the midst of 
it without being able actively to participate in it. And of this type ' A Vir- 
ginia Girl in the Civil War' is a truly admirable example." Philadelphia 
Record.

sion enabled him to record what he saw in a series of pen pictures that are little 
less than instantaneous photographs. The feature far excellence of these 
reminiscences is their interesting character. ... He tells you briefly but 
graphically what he saw, beard, or did himself. One gains a very real and 
personal knowledge of the war from these 'Recollections.' " Chicago Times-

A PICTURESQUE BOOK OF THE SEA, 

A Sailor's Log. 

Recollections of Forty Tears of Naval Life. By Rear- 
Admiral ROBLEY D. EVANS, U. S. N. Illustrated. 
Large i2mo. Cloth, $2.00. 

"It is essentially a book for men, young and old ; and the 
man who does not enjoy it is lacking in healthy red blood." 
Chicago Bookseller. 

*' A profoundly interesting book. There is not a line of bra- 
vado in its chapters, nor a carping criticism. It is a book which 
will increase the esteem and high honor which the American feels 
and willingly awards our naval heroes."- Chicago Inter-Ocean. 

"It would be difficult to find an autobiography possessing 
more interest than this narrative of forty years of active naval serv- 
ice. It equals the most fascinating novel for interest ; it contains 
a great deal of material that has a distinct historical value. . . . 
Altogether it is a most delightful book." Brooklyn Eagle. 

** His is a picturesque personality, and he stands the supreme 
test by being as popular with his officers and men as he is with 
the public generally. His life has been one of action and adven- 
ture since he was a boy, and the record of it which he has pre- 
pared in his book 'A Sailor's Log' has not a dull line in it from 
cover to cover. It is all action, action, and again action from the 
first page to the last, and makes one want to go and ' do things ' 
himself. Any boy between fifteen and nineteen who reads this 
book and does not want to go to sea must be a sluggish youth. 
. . . The book is really an interesting record of an interesting 
man." New Tork Press.

THE AUTHENTIC LIFE OF LINCOLN. 

Abraham Lincoln: The True Story of a Great 
Life. 

By WILLIAM H. HERNDON and JESSE W. WEIK. With 
numerous Illustrations. New and revised edition, with 
an Introduction by Horace White. In two volumes, 
izmo. Cloth, $3.00. 

This is probably the most intimate life of Lincoln ever written. The 
book, by Lincoln's law-partner, William H. Herndon, and his friend Jesse 
W. Weik, shows us Lincoln the man. It is a true picture of his surround- 
ings and influences and acts. It is not an attempt to construct a political 
history, with Lincoln often in the background, nor is it an effort to apotheo- 
size the American who stands first in our history next to Washington. The 
writers knew Lincoln intimately. Their book is the result of unreserved 
association ; hence, it has taken rank as the best and most illuminating study 
of Lincoln's character and personality. 

" Truly, they who wish to know Lincoln as he really was must read the biog- 
raphy by his friend and law-partner, W. H. Herndon. This book was imperatively 
needed to brush aside the rank growth of myth and legend which was threatening 
to hide the real lineaments of Lincoln from the eyes of posterity. . . . There is no 
doubt about the faithfulness of Mr. Herndon's delineation. The marks of unflinch- 
ing veracity are patent in every line." New York Sun. 

"The three portraits of Lincoln are the best that exist ; and not the least char- 
acteristic of these, the Lincoln of the Douglas debates, has never before been 
engraved. . . . Herndon's narrative gives, as nothing else is likely to give, the 
material from which we may form a true picture of the man from infancy to matu- 
rity." The Nation. 

" Mr. Herndon is naturally a very direct writer, and he has been industrious in 
gathering material. Whether an incident happened before or behind the scenes, is 
all the same to him. He gives it without artifice or apology. He describes the life 
of his friend Lincoln just as he saw it." Cincinnati Commercial Gazette. 

"A remarkable piece of literary achievement remarkable alike for its fidelity 
to facts, its fulness of details, its constructive skill, and its literary charm." Newt 
York Timet. 

" It will always remain the authentic life of Abraham Lincoln." Chicago Herald.

grow tired." Boston Transcript.

"The Most Remarkable Autobiography/' 

My Life in Many States and in Foreign Lands. 

Written in the Mills Hotel, in my Seventy-fourth Year. 
By GEORGE FRANCIS TRAIN. Illustrated, izrno. Cloth, 
$1.25 net ; postage, 12 cents additional. 

" Positively fascinating. His life has been one of stupendous 
commercial and important financial undertakings." Boston 
Times. 

" One of the most picturesque figures ever known in the his- 
tory of America, and Americans are the most picturesque of all 
modern peoples." New York Herald. 

" If his career were published as fiction, every one would con- 
sider it so improbable as to be ridiculous." Chicago Inter-Ocean. 

" The strangest man in the world has written his autobiography 
probably the most remarkable autobiography ever written." 
New York World. 

" A tale that transcends in interest all the remarkable tales that 
were ever woven out of the silver threads of fiction or the golden 
threads of truth, putting to the blush most of the novels and all 
the books of personal narrative that have ever been written." 
Philadelphia Item. 

" A remarkable story of a remarkable life, the amazing facts 
of a career without a parallel for daring and eccentricity." 
Tacoma Ledger. 

" This book would be a severe test of the reader's credulity 
were the things related not all matters of actual history." Ameri~ 
can Review of Reviews. 

" It reads like a whole bunch of romances and melodrama and 
comedies and tragedies rolled into one. A human document of 
a rare kind." Providence News. 

" It is the story of a man absolutely fearless of consequences, 
of high ideals, and a genius for taking hazards of new fortunes." 
New York Christian Work. 

D. APPLETON AND COMPANY, NEW YORK. 



A NOVEL OF REAL IMPORTANCE. 

The Law of Life. 

By ANNA McCLURE SHOLL. izmo. Cloth, $1.50. 

This remarkable novel presents an entirely new and a very enter- 
taining feature of American national and social development. Miss 
Sholl has sought her inspiration in the life and interests of a large 
University, as that life is felt and known from the faculty and post- 
graduate standpoints. The author has brought to this fascinating and 
unfamiliar subject a close personal knowledge and an enthusiastic 
appreciation of its possibilities for literary purposes. 

" The book is exceptionally interesting. ... A genuine touch 
of dramatic power." Harry Thurston Peck. 

" An impassioned romance, told with admirable balance ; absorb- 
ingly interesting and one of the most vital novels of the day." Lillian 
Whiting in the Chicago Inter-Ocean. 

" The writer unfolds an every-day tragedy with that touch of inevi- 
tableness that we usually associate with the work of the masters." New 
York Evening Telegram. 

" A remarkable story in many respects ; it makes one think, as well 
as sympathize, and gives pleasure as a tale as well as stimulates as a 
problem." Chicago Record-Herald. 

" The book has not only a literary grace and distinction, but a 
sympathetic understanding of conditions, a sense of their artistic values; 
and a strong feeling for that law of life from which the book takes its 
title." Louisville Evening Post. 

"Miss Sholl has handled her subject with admirable sureness 
of touch, with dignity and proper restraint. Her lovers are be- 
ings of flesh and blood, not puppets ; she faces the problem fully, 
fearlessly ; hence the compelling strength of the story, its excep- 
tional merit as the product of an American pen." New York 
Mail and Express. 

D. APPLETON AND COMPANY, NEW YORK. 



The Captain's Toil-Gate. 

A Complete Posthumous Novel by FRANK R. STOCK- 
TON, Author of "Kate Bonnet," ''The Lady or the 
Tiger," etc. With a Memoir by Mrs. Stockton, an Etched 
Portrait, Views of Mr. Stockton's Home, and a Bibli- 
ography. i2mo. Cloth, $1.50. 

The scene is partly laid in Washington but mainly in 
that part of West Virginia where the author spent the 
last three years of his life. Incidents centering about 
the f< Toll-Gate " and a fashionable country home in the 
neighborhood are related with the author's peculiar 
humor and charm of diction which have endeared him 
to a host of readers. 

The heroine who is an embodiment of the healthy 
vigorous girl of to-day, and her several suitors, together 
with the mistress of the country house and a meddlesome 
unmarried woman of the village, combine to . present a 
fascinating and varied picture of social life to the present 
day. 

"In the story we have the real Stockton at his best and brightest. 
The fun, the whimsicality, the queer doings, the very delightful people 
are such as his readers have been entertained with for so many years. 
The fertility of invention and higenuity is as fresh as in the early 
stories, and perhaps Mr. Stockton never came nearer to success in 
trying to keep a long story together to the end without digressions or 
a break in the plot. The heroine is a charming girl, her married 
hostess still more charming, and there are plenty of others the reader 
will be glad to meet. 

" Mrs. Stockton's sketch of her husband gives us a glimpse of a 
lovable and delightful personality and shows the author at work just 
as the readers must have imagined him. Swinging in a hammock 
under the fir trees, or when winter came, in an easy chair before a big 
log fire, he dreamed his fancies and dictated them, bit by bit, as they 
came, to his secretary." New York Sun.
