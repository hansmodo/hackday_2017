<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

January 6, 1836. 

Well, my dear G., about half an hour more and your 
old friend, companion, schoolmate, sister, etc., will cease 
to be Hatty Beecher and change to nobody knows who. 
My dear, you are engaged, and pledged in a year or two 
to encounter a similar fate, and do you wish to know 
how you shall feel ? Well, my dear, I have been dreading and dreading the time, and lying awake all last 
week wondering how I should live through this overwhelming crisis, and lo ! it has come and I feel nothing 
at all. 

The wedding is to be altogether domestic ; nobody 
present but my own brothers and sisters, and my old 
colleague, Mary Button ; and as there is a sufficiency 
of the ministry in our family we have not even to call 
in the foreign aid of a minister. Sister Katy is not 
here, so she will not witness my departure from her care 
and guidance to that of another. None of my numerous friends and acquaintances who have taken such a 
deep interest in making the connection for me even 
know the dav, and it will be all done and over before 
they know anything about it. 

Well, it is really a mercy to have this entire stupidity 
come over one at such a time. I should be crazy to feel 
as I did yesterday, or indeed to feel anything at all. 
But I inwardly vowed that my last feelings and reflections on this subject should be yours, and as I have not 
got any, it is just as well to tell you that. Well, here 
comes Mr. S., so farewell, and for the last time I subscribe Your own

June 16, 1845. 

My Dear Husband, — It is a dark, sloppy, rainy, 
muddy, disagreeable day, and I have been working hard 
(for me) all day in the kitchen, washing dishes, looking 
into closets, and seeing a great deal o£ that dark side 
of domestic life which a housekeeper may who will 
investigate too curiously into minutiae in warm, damp 
weather, especially after a girl ayIio keej3s all clean on 
the outside of cup and platter, and is very apt to make 
good the rest of the text in the inside of things. 

I am sick of the smell of sour milk, and sour meat, 
and sour everything, and then the clothes icill not dry, 
and no wet thing does, and everything smells mouldy ; 
and altogether 1 feel as if I never wanted to eat again. 

Your letter, which was neither sour nor mouldy, 
formed a very agreeable contrast to all these things; 
the more so for being unexpected. I am much obliged 
to you for it. As to my health, it gives me very little 
solicitude, although I am bad enough and daily growing worse. I feel no life, no energy, no appetite, or 
rather a growing distaste for food ; in fact, I am becoming quite ethereal. Upon reflection I perceive that 
it pleases my Father to keep me in the fire, for my whole 
situation is excessively harassing and painful. I suffer 
with sensible distress in the brain, as I have done more 
or less since my sickness last winter, a distress which 
some days takes from me all power of planning or executing anything ; and you know that, except this poor 
head, my unfortunate household has no mainspring, for 
nobody feels any kind of responsibihty to do a thing 
in time, place, or manner, except as I oversee it. 

Georgiana is so excessively weak, nervous, cross, and 
fretful, night and day, that she takes all Anna's strength 
and time mth her ; and then the children are, hke other 
little sons and daughters of Adam, full of all kinds of 
absurdity and folly. 

When the brain gives out, as mine often does, and 
one cannot think or remember anything, then what is 
to be done ? All common fatigue, sickness, and exhaustion is nothing to this distress. Yet do I rejoice 
in my God and know in whom I believe, and only pray 
that the fire may consume the dross ; as to the gold, 
that is imperishable. No real evil can happen to me, 
so I fear nothing for the future, and only suffer in the 
present tense. 

God, the mighty God, is mine, of that I am sure, and 
I know He knows that though flesh and heart fail, I am 
all the whUe desiring and trying for his will alone. As 
to a journey, I need not ask a physician to see that it 
is needful to me as far as health is concerned, that is to 
say, all human appearances are that way, but I feel no 
particular choice about it. If God wills I go. He can 
easily find means. Money, I suppose, is as plenty with 
Kim now as it always has been, and if He sees it is 
reaUy best He will doubtless help me.

[June 29, 1849, Brattleboro]

My dear Husband, — This week has been unusually fatal. The disease in the city has been malignant and vkulent. Hearse drivers have scarce been 
allowed to unharness their horses, wliile f ui-niture carts 
and common vehicles are often employed for the removal of the dead. The sable trains which pass our 
windows, the frequent indications of crowding haste, 
and the absence of reverent decency have, in many 
cases, been most painful. Of course all these things, 
whether we will or no, bring very doleful images to the 
mind. 

On Tuesday one hundred and sixteen deaths from 
cholera were reported, and that night the air was of 
that peculiarly oppressive, deatlily kind that seems to 
he like lead on the brain and soul. 

As regards your commg home, I am decidedly opposed to it. First, because the chance of your being 
taken ill is just as great as the chance of your beilig 
able to render us any help. To exchange the salubrious air of Brattleboro' for the pestilent atmosphere 
of this place with your system rendered sensitive by 
water-cure treatment would be extremely dangerous. 
It is a source of constant gratitude to me that neither 
you nor father are exposed to the dangers here. 

Second, none of us are sick, and it is very uncertain 
whether we shaU be. 

Third, if we were sick tliere are so many of us that 
it is not at all likely we shall all be taken at once. 

July 1. Yesterday Mr. Stagg went to the city and 
found all gloomy and discouraged, while a universal 
panic seemed to be drawing nearer than ever before. 
Large piles of coal were burning on the cross walks 
and in the public squares, while those who had talked 
confidently of the cholera being confined to the lower 
classes and those who were imprudent began to feel as 
did the magicians of old, " This is the finger of God." 

Yesterday, upon the recommendation of all the clergymen of the city, the mayor issued a proclamation for 
a day of general fasting, humiliation, and prayer, to be 
observed on Tuesday next. 

Juhj 3. We are all in good health and try to maintain a calm and cheerful frame of mind. The doctors 
are nearly used up. Dr. Bowen and Dr. Peck are sick 
in bed. Dr. Potter and Dr. Pulte ought, I suppose, to 
be there also. The younger physicians have no rest 
night or day. Mr. Fisher is laid up from his incessant 
visitations with the sick and dying. Our own Dr. 
Brown is likewise prostrated, but we are all resolute to 
stand by each other, and there are so many of us that 
it is not likely we can all be taken sick together. 

July 4. All well. The meeting yesterday was very 
solemn and interestinjr. Tliere is more or less sickness 
about us, but no very dangerous cases. One hundred 
and twenty burials from cholera alone yesterday, yet 
to-day we see parties bent on pleasure or senseless carousing, while to-morrow and next day will witness a 
fresh harvest of death from them. How we can become 
accustomed to anything ! Awhile ago ten a day dying 

of cholera struck terror to all hearts ; but now the tide 
has surged up gradually until the deaths average over 
a hundred daily, and everybody is getting accustomed 
to it. Gentlemen make themselves agreeable to ladies 
by reciting the number of deaths in this house or that. 
This together with talk of funerals, cholera medicines, 
cholera dietetics, and chloride of lime form the oi'dinary 
staple of conversation. Serious persons of course throw 
in moral reflections to their taste. 

July 10. Yesterday little Charley was taken ill, 
not seriously, and at any other season I should not be 
alarmed. Now, however, a slight illness seems like a 
death sentence, and I will not dissemble that I feel 
from the outset very little hope. I still think it best 
that you should not return. By so doing you might 
lose all you have gained. You might expose yourself 
to a fatal incursion of disease. It is decidedly not 
your duty to do so. 

July 12. Yesterday I carried Charley to Dr. Pulte, 
who spoke in such a manner as discouraged and frightened me. He mentioned dropsy on the brain as a possible result. I came home with a heavy heart, sorrowing, desolate, and wishing my husband and father were 
here. 

About one o'clock this morninof Miss Stewart suddenly opened my door crying, " Mrs. Stowe, Henry is 
vomiting." I was on my feet in an instant, and lifted 
up my heart for help. He was, however, in a few minutes relieved. Then I turned my attention to Charley, 
who was also suffering, put him into a wet sheet, and 
kept him there until he was in a profuse perspiration. 
He is evidently getting better, and is auspiciously cross. 

Never was crossness in a baby more admired. Anna 
and I have said to each other exultingly a score of 
times, " How cross the Httle fellow is ! How he does 
scold ! " 

Juhj 15. Since I last wrote our house has been a 
perfect hospital. Charley apparently recovering, but 
still weak and feeble, unable to walk or play, and so 
miserably fretful and unhappy. Sunday Anna and I 
were fauly stricken down, as many others are, with no 
particular illness, but with such miserable prostration. 
I lay on the bed all day reading my hymn-book and 
thinking over passages of Scripture. 

July 17. To-day we have been attending poor old 
Aunt Frankie's ^ funeral. She died yesterday morning, 
taken sick the day before while washing. Good, honest, trustful old soul ! She was truly one who hungered and thirsted for righteousness. 

Yesterday morning our poor little dog, Daisy, who 
had been ailing the day before, was suddenly seized 
with frightful spasms and died in half an hour. Poor 
little affectionate thing ! If I were half as good for my 
nature as she for hers I should l)e much better than I 
am. While we were all mourning over her the news 
came that Aunt Frankie was breathing her last. Hatty, 
Eliza, Anna, and I made her shroud yesterday, and 
this morning I made her cap. We have just come 
from her grave. 

July 23. At last, my dear, the hand of the Lord 
hath touched us. We have been watching all day by 
the dying bed of little Charley, who is gradually sinking. After a partial recovery from the attack 1 described in my last letter he continued for some days 
very feeble, but still we hoped for recovery. About 
four days ago he was taken with decided cholera, and 
now there is no hope of his surviving this night. 

Every kindness is shown us by the neighbors. Do 
not return. All will be over before you could possibly get here, and the epidemic is now said by the physicians to prove fatal to every new case. Bear up. 
Let us not faint when we are rebuked of Him. I dare 
not trust myself to say more but shall write again soon. 

July 26. 

My dear Husband, — At last it is over and our 
dear little one is gone from us. He is now among 
the blessed. My Charley — my beautiful, loving, gladsome baby, so loving, so sweet, so full of life and hope 
and strength — now lies shrouded, pale and cold, in the 
room below. Never was he anything to me but a comfort. He has been my pride and joy. Many a heartache has he cured for me. Many an anxious night 
have I held him to my bosom and felt the sorrow and 
loneliness pass out of me with the touch of his little 
warm hands. Yet I have just seen him in his death 
agony, looked on his imploring face when I could not 
help nor soothe nor do one tiling, not one, to mitigate 
his cruel suffering, do nothing but pray in my anguish 
that he might die soon. I write as though there were 
no sorrow like my sorrow, yet there has been in this 
city, as in the land of Egypt, scarce a house without its 
dead. This heart-break, this anguish, has been everywhere, and when it will end God alone knows.

The events of the first summer in Brunswick are 
graphically described by Mrs. Stowe in a letter written 
to her sister-in-law, Mrs. George Beecher, December 17, 
1850. 

My dear Sister, — Is it really true that snow is on 
the ground and Christmas coming, and I have not 
written unto thee, most dear sister? No, I don't 
believe it ! I have n't been so naughty — it 's all a 
mistake — yes, written I must have — and written I 
have, too — in tlie night-watches as I lay on my bed — 
such beautiful letters — I wish you had only gotten 
them ; but by day it has been hurry, hurry, hurry, and 
drive, drive, drive ! or else the calm of a sick-room, 
ever since last spring. 

^ Wife of Professor Upham of Bowdoin College. 



134 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 

I put off writing when your letter first came because 
I meant to write you a long letter — a full and complete one, and so days slid by, — and became weeks, 
— and my little Charlie came . . . etc. and etc. ! ! ! 
Sarah, when I look back, I wonder at myself, not that 
I forget any one thing that I should remember, but 
that I have remembered anything. From the time that 
I left Cincinnati with my children to come forth to a 
country that I knew not of almost to the present time, 
it has seemed as if I could scarcely breathe, I was so 
pressed with care. My head dizzy with the whirl of 
railroads and steamboats ; then ten days' sojourn in Boston, and a constant toil and hurry in buying my furniture and equipments ; and then landing in Brunswick 
in the midst of a drizzly, inexorable northeast storm, 
and beginning the work of getting in order a deserted, 
dreary, damp old house. All day long running from 
one thing to another, as for example, thus : — 

Mrs. Stowe, how shall I make this lounge, and what 
shall I cover the back with first ? 

3Irs. Stowe. With the coarse cotton in the closet. 

Woman. Mrs. Stowe, there is n't any more soap to 
clean the windows. 

Mrs. Stowe. Where shall I get soap ? 

Here H., run up to the store and get two bars. 

There is a man below wants to see Mrs. Stowe about 
the cistern. Before you go down, Mrs. Stowe, just 
show me how to cover this round end of the lounge. 

There 's a man up from the depot, and he says that 
a box has come for Mrs. Stowe, and it 's coming up to 
the house ; will you come down and see about it ? 

Mrs. Stowe, don't go till you have shown the man 



''MID SCENES OF CONFUSION." 135 

how to nail that carpet in the corner. He 's nailed it 
all crooked ; what shall he do ? The black thread is 
all used up, and what shall I do about putting gimp on 
the back of that sofa? Mrs. Stowe, there is a man 
come with a lot of pails and tinware from Furbish ; will 
you settle the bill now ? 

Mrs. Stowe, here is a letter just come from Boston 
inclosing that bill of lading ; the man wants to know 
what he shall do with the goods. If you will tell me 
what to say I will answer the letter for you. 

Mrs. Stowe, the meat-man is at the door. Had n't 
we better get a little beefsteak, or something, for dinner ? 

Shall Hatty go to Boardman's for some more black 
thread ? 

Mrs. Stowe, this cushion is an inch too wide for the 
frame. What shall we do now? 

Mrs. Stowe, where are the screws of the black walnut 
bedstead ? 

Here 's a man has brought in these bills for freight. 
Will you settle them now ? 

Mrs. Stowe, I don't understand using this great 
needle. I can't make it go through the cushion ; it 
sticks in the cotton. 

Then comes a letter from my husband saying he is 
sick abed, and all but dead ; don't ever expect to see 
his family again ; wants to know how I shall manage, 
in case I am left a widow ; knows we shall get in debt 
and never get out ; wonders at my courage ; thinks I 
am very sanguine ; warns me to be prudent, as there 
won't be much to live on in case of his death, etc., etc., 
etc. I read the letter and poke it into the stove, and 
proceed. . . . 



136 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 

Some of my adventures were quite funny ; as for 
example : I had in my kitchen elect no sink, cistern, or 
any other water privileges, so I bought at the cotton 
factory two of the great hogsheads they bring oil in, 
which here in Brunswick are often used for cisterns, 
and had them brought up in triumph to my yard, and 
was congratulating myself on my energy, when lo and 
behold ! it was discovered that there was no cellar door 
except one in the kitchen, which was truly a strait and 
narrow way, down a long pair of stairs. Hereupon, as 
saith John Bunyan, I fell into a muse, — how to get 
my cisterns into my cellar. In days of chivalry I 
might have got a knight to make me a breach through 
the foundation walls, but that was not to be thought of 
now, and my oil hogsheads standing disconsolately in 
the yard seemed to reflect no great credit on my foresight. In this strait I fell upon a real honest Yankee 
cooper, whom I besought, for the reputation of his 
craft and mine, to take my hogsheads to pieces, carry 
them down in staves, and set them up again, which the 
worthy man actually accomplished one fair summer 
forenoon, to the great astonishment of " us Yankees." 
When my man came to put up the pump, he stared 
very hard to see my hogsheads thus translated and 
standing as innocent and quiet as could be in the cellar, and then I told him, in a very mild, quiet way, that 
I got 'em taken to pieces and put together — just as if 
I had been always in the habit of doing such things. 
Professor Smith came down and looked very hard at 
them and then said, " Well, nothing can beat a willful 
woman." Then followed divers negfotiations with a 
very clever, but (with reverence) somewhat lazy gentle


JOHN TIT COMB. 137 

man of jobs, who occiipieth a carpenter's shop opposite 
to mine. This same John Titcomb, my very good 
friend, is a character pecuUar to Yankeedom. He is 
part owner and landlord of the house I rent, and connected by birth with all the best families in town ; a 
man of real intelhgence, and good education, a great 
reader, and qidte a thinker. Being of an ingenious 
turn he does painting, gilding, staining, upholstery 
jobs, varnishing, all in addition to his prunary trade of 
carpentry. But he is a man studious of ease, and fully 
possessed with the idea that man wants but Httle here 
below ; so he boards himself in his workshop on crackers and herring, washed down with cold water, and 
spends his tune working, musing, reading new publications, and taking his comfort. In his shop you shall 
see a joiner's bench, hammers, planes, saws, gimlets, 
varnish, paint, picture frames, fence posts, rare old 
china, one or two fine portraits of his ancestry, a bookcase full of books, the tooth of a whale, an old spinning-wheel and spindle, a lady's parasol frame, a church 
lamp to be mended, in short, Henry says Mr. Titcomb's 
shop is like the ocean ; there is no end to the curiosities 
in it. 

In all my moving and fussing Mr. Titcomb has been 
my right-hand man. Whenever a screw was loose, a 
nail to be driven, a lock mended, a pane of glass set, 
and these cases were manifold, he was always on hand. 
But my sink was no fancy job, and I believe nothing 
but a very particular friendship would have moved him 
to undertake it. So this same sink lingered in a precarious state for some weeks, and wlien I had noildnf/ 
else to do, I used to call and do what I could in the 



138 REMOVAL TO BRUNSWICK. 

way of enlisting tlie good man's s^Tnpatliies in its behalf. 

How many times I have been in and seated myself 
in one of the old rocking-chairs, and talked first of the 
news of the day, the raiboad, the last proceedings in 
Congress, the probabiHties about the millennium, and 
thus brought the conversation by httle and Httle round 
to my sink ! . . . because, till the sink was done, the 
pump could not be put up, and we could n't have any 
rain-water. Sometimes my courage would quite fail me 
to introduce the subject, and I would talk of everything else, turn and get out of the shop, and then turn 
back as if a thought had just struck my mind, and 
say : — 

" Oh, Mr. Titcomb ! about that sink?" 

" Yes, ma'am, I was thinking about going down 
street this afternoon to look out stuff for it." 

" Yes, sir, if you would be good enough to get it 
done as soon as possible ; we are in great need of it." 

" I think there 's no hurry. I beUeve we are going 
to have a dry time now, so that you could not catch 
any water, and you won't need a pump at present." 

These negotiations extended from the first of June 
to the first of July, and at last my sink was completed, 
and so also was a new house spout, concerning which I 
had had divers communings with Deacon Dunning of 
the Baptist church. Also during this time good Mrs. 
Mitchell and myself made two sofas, or lounges, a barrel chair, divers bedspreads, pillow cases, pillows, bolsters, mattresses ; we painted rooms ; we revarnished 
furniture; we — what didnH we do? 

Then came on Mr. Stowe j and then came the eighth 



BIRTH OF SEVENTH CHILD. 139 

of July and my little Charley. I was really glad for 
an excuse to lie in bed, for I was full tiied, I can assure 
you. Well, I was what folks call very comfortable for 
two weeks, when my nurse had to leave me. . . . 

During- this tune I have employed my leisiu'e hours 
in making up my engagements with newspaper editors. 
I have written more than anybody, or I myself, would 
have thought. I have taught an hour a day in ouischool, and I have read two hours every evening to the 
children. The children study EngHsh history in school, 
and I am reading Scott's historic novels in their order. 
To-night I finish the " Abbot ; " shall begin " Kenilworth " next week; yet I am constantly pursued and 
haunted by the idea that I don't do anything. Since I 
began this note I have been called off at least a dozen 
times ; once for the fish-man, to buy a codfish ; once to 
see a man Avho had brought me some barrels of apples ; 
once to see a book-man ; then to Mrs. Upham, to see 
about a drawing I promised to make for her ; then to 
nurse the baby ; then into the kitchen to make a chowder for dinner ; and now I am at it again, for nothing 
but deadly determination enables me ever to write ; it 
is rowing against wind and tide. 

I suppose you think now I have begun, I am never 
going to stop, and in truth it looks like it; but the 
spirit moves now and I must obey. 

Christmas is coming, and our little household is all 
aUve with preparations ; every one collecting their Httle gifts with wonderful mystery and secrecy. . . . 

To tell the truth, dear, I am getting tired ; my neck 
and back ache, and I must come to a close. 

Your ready kindness to me in the spring I felt very much ; and laliy I did not have the sense to have sent 
you one hne just by way of acknowledgment, I 'm 
sure I don't know ; I felt just as if I had, till I awoke, 
and behold ! I had not. But, my dear, if my wits are 
somewhat wool-gathering and unsettled, my heart is as 
true as a star. I love you, and have thought of you 
often. 

This fall I have felt often sad, lonesome, both very 
unusual feelings with me in these busy days ; but the 
breaking away from my old home, and leaving father 
and mother, and coming to a strange place affected me 
naturally. In those sad hours my thoughts have often 
timied to George ; I have thought with encouragement of his blessed state, and hoped that I should soon 
be there too. I have many warm and kind friends 
here, and have been treated with great attention and 
kindness. Brunswick is a delightful residence, and if 
you come East next summer you must come to my new 
home. George^ would delight to go a-fishing with the 
children, and see the ships, and sail in the sailboats, 
and all that. 

Give Aunt Harriet's love to him, and tell him when 
he gets to be a painter to send me a picture. 

Affectionately yours, H. Stowe. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Bkunswick, July 9, 1851. 

Frederick Douglass, Esq. : 

Sir, — You may perhaps have noticed in your editorial readinofs a series of articles that I am furnishinof for the " Era " under the title of " Uncle Tom's 
Cabin, or Life among the Lowly." 

In the course of my story the scene will fall upon a 
cotton plantation. I am very desiious, therefore, to gain information from one who has been an actual 
laborer on one, and it occurred to me that in the circle 
of your acquaintance there might be one who would 
be able to communicate to me some such mformation 
as I desire. I have before me an able paper written 
by a Southern planter, in which the details and modus 
02:&gt;erandi are given from his point of sight. I am 
anxious to have something more from another standpoint. I wish to be able to make a picture that shall 
be graphic and true to nature in its details. Such a 
person as Henry Bibb, if in the country, might give 
me just the kind of information I desire. You may 
possibly know of some other person. I will subjoin 
to this letter a list of questions, which in that case you 
will do me a favor by inclosing to the individual, with 
the request that he will at earliest convenience answer 
them. 

For some few weeks past I have received your paper 
through the mail, and have read it with great interest, 
and desire to return my acknowledgments for it. It 
will be a pleasure to me at some time when less occupied to contribute something to its columns. I have 
noticed with regret your sentiments on two subjects — 
the church and African colonization, . . . with the 
more regret because I think you have a considerable 
share of reason for your feehngs on both these subjects ; but I would willingly, if I could, modify your 
views on both points. 

In the first place you say the church is " pro-slavery." There is a sense in which this may be true. 
The American church of all denominations, taken as 
a body, comprises the best and most conscientious people in the country. I do not say it comprises none but 
these, or that none such are found out of it, but 
only if a census were taken of the purest and most high 
principled men and women of the country, the majority 
of them would be found to be professors of religion in 
some of the various Christian denominations. This 
fact has given to the church great weight in this country — the general and predominant spirit of intelligence and probity and piety of its majority has given 
it that degree of weight that it has the power to decide the great moral questions of the day. Whatever 
it unitedly and decidedly sets itself against as moral 
evil it can put down. In this sense the church is responsible for the sin of slavery. Dr. Barnes has beautifully and briefly expressed this on the last page of 
his work on slavery, when he says : ^' Not all the force 
out of the church could sustain slavery an hour if it 
were not sustained in it." It then appears that the 
church has the power to put an end to this evil and 
does not do it. In this sense she may be said to be 
pro-slavery. But the church has the same power over 
intemperance, and Sabbath-breaking, and sin of all 
kinds. There is not a doubt that if the moral power 
of the church were brought up to the New Testament 
standpoint it is sufficient to put an end to all these as 
well as to slavery. But I would ask you, Would you 
consider it a fair representation of the Christian church 
in this country to say that it is pro-intemperance, proSabbath-breaking, and pro everything that it might put 
down if it were in a hijifher state of moral feelino- ? If 
you should make a list of all the abolitionists of the 
country, I think that you would find a majority of them in the church — certainly some of the most influential and efficient ones are ministers. 

I am a minister's daughter, and a minister's wife, 
and I have had six brothers in the ministry (one is in 
heaven) ; I certainly ought to know something of the 
feelings of ministers on this subject. I was a child in 
1820 when the Missouri question was agitated, and one 
of the strongest and deepest impressions on my mind 
was that made by my father's sermons and prayers, and 
the anguish of his soul for the poor slave at that time. 
I remember his preaching drawing tears down the 
hardest faces of the old farmers in his congregation. 

I well remember his prayers morning and evening in 
the family for "^ poor, oppressed, bleeding Africa," that 
the time of her dehverance might come ; prayers offered 
with strong crying and tears, and which indelibly impressed my heart and made me what I am from my 
very soul, the enemy of all slavery. Every brother I 
have has been in his sphere a leading anti-slavery man. 
One of them was to the last the bosom friend and 
counselor of Lovejoy. As for myself and husband, we 
have for the last seventeen years lived on the border of 
a slave State, and we have never shrunk from the fugitives, and we have helped them with all we had to give. 
I have received the children of liberated slaves into a 
family school, and taught them with my own children, 
and it has been the influence that we found in the 
church and by the altar that has made us do all this. 
Gather up all the sermons that have been published on 
this offensive and unchristian Fugitive Slave Law, and 
you will find that those against it are numerically more 
than those in its favor, and yet some of the strongest opponents have not published their sermons. Out of 
thirteen ministers who meet with my husband weekly 
for discussion of moral subjects, only three are found 
who W'ill acknowledge or obey this law in any shape. 

After all, my brother, the strength and hope of your 
oppressed race does lie in the church — in hearts united 
to Him of whom it is said, " He shall spare the souls 
of the needy, and precious shall their blood be in his 
sight." Everything is against you, but Jesus Christ is 
for you, and He has not forgotten his church, misguided and erring though it be. I have looked all the 
field over with despairing eyes ; I see no hope but in 
Him. This movement must and will become a purely 
religious one. The light will spread in churches, the 
tone of feeling will rise. Christians North and South 
will give up all connection with, and take up their testimony against, slavery, and thus the work will be 
done.

I congratulate you most cordially upon the immense success and influence of " Uncle Tom's Cabin." It is 
one of the greatest triumphs recorded in literary history to say nothing of the higher triumph of its moral effect. 

With great regard, and friendly remembrance to Mr. Stowe, I remain. 

Yours most truly, 

Henry W. Longfellow.

In December the Earl of Shaftesbury wrote to Mrs. 
Stowe : — 

Madam, — It is very possible that the writer of this 
letter may be w^holly unknown to you. But whether 
my name be familiar to your ears, or whether you now 
read it for the first time, I cannot refrain from expressing to you the deep gratitude that I feel to Almighty 
God who has inspired both your heart and your head 
in the composition of " Uncle Tom's Cabin." None 
but a Christian beHever could have produced such a 
book as yours, which has absolutely startled the whole 
world, and impressed many thousands by revelations of 
cruelty and sin that give us an idea of what would be 
the uncontrolled dominion of Satan on tliis fallen earth. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

To this letter Mrs. Stowe replied as follows : — 

Andover, January 6, 1853. 

To THE Earl of Shaftesbury : 

My Lord, — The few lines I have received from you 
are a comfort and an encouragement to me, feeble as 
I now am in health, and pressed oftentimes with sorrowful thoughts. 

It is a comfort to know that in other lands there 
are those who feel as we feel, and who are looking with 
simplicity to the gospel of Jesus, and prayerfully hoping- his final comino". 

My lord, before you wrote me I read with deep 
emotion your letter to the ladies of England, and subsequently the noble address of the Duchess of Sutherland, and I could not but feel that such movements, originating in such a quarter, prompted by a spirit so 
devout and benevolent, were truly of God, and must 
result in a blessing to the world. 

I o;rieve to see that both in Eno-land and this country there are those who are entirely incapable of appreciating the Christian and truly friendly feeling that 
prompted this movement, and that there are even those 
who meet it with coarse personahties such as I had not 
thought possible in an EngUsh or American paper. 

When I wrote my work it was in simplicity and in 
the love of Christ, and if I felt anything that seemed 
to me like a call to undertake it, it was this, that I had 
a true heart of love for the Southern people, a feeling 
appreciation of then* trials, and a sincere admiration of 
then' many excellent traits, and that I thus felt, I 
think, must appear to every impartial reader of the 
work. 

It was my hope that a book so kindly intended, so 
favorable in many respects, might be permitted free 
circulation among them, and that the gentle voice of 
Eva and the manly generosity of St. Clare might be 
allowed to say those things of the system which would 
be invidious in any other form. 

At first the book seemed to go by acclamation ; the 
South did not condemn, and the North was loud and 
unanimous in praise ; not a dissenting voice was raised ; 
to my astonishment everybody praised. But when the 
book circulated so widely and began to penetrate the 
Southern States, when it began to be perceived how 
powerfully it affected every mind that read it, there 
came on a reaction. 

Answers, pamphlets, newspaper attacks came thick 



172 UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. 

and fast, and certain Northern papers, religious, — so 
called, — turned and began to denounce the work as unchristian, heretical, etc. The reason of all this is that 
it has been seen that the book has a direct tendency 
to do what it was written for, — to awaken conscience 
in the slaveholding States and lead to emancipation. 

Now there is nothing that Southern political leaders 
and capitahsts so dread as anti-slavery feehng among 
themselves. All the force of lynch law is employed to 
smother discussion and blind conscience on this question. The question is not allowed to be discussed, and 
he who sells a book or pubhshes a tract makes himself 
Hable to fine and imprisonment. 

My book is, therefore, as much under an interdict 
in some parts of the South as the Bible is in Italy. It 
is not allowed in the bookstores, and the greater part 
of the people hear of it and me only through grossly 
caricatured representations in the papers, with garbled 
extracts from the book. 

A cousin residing in Georgia this winter says that 
the prejudice against my name is so strong that she 
dares not have it appear on the outside of her letters, 
and that very amiable and excellent people have asked 
her if such as I could be received into reputable society 
at the North. 

Under these circumstances, it is a matter of particular regret that the " New York Observer," an old and 
long-established religious paper in the United States, 
extensively read at the South, should have come out 
in such a bitter and unscrupulous style of attack as 
even to induce some Southern papers, with a generosity 
one often finds at the South, to protest against it. 



3IBS. STOWE'S REPLY. 173 

That they should use their Christian character and 
the sacred name of Christ still further to blind the 
minds and strengthen the prejudices of their Southern 
brethren is to me a matter of deepest sorrow. All 
those things, of course, cannot touch me in my private 
capacity, sheltered as I am by a happy home and very 
warm friends. I only grieve for it as a dishonor to 
Christ and a real injustice to many noble-minded people at the South, who, if they were allowed quietly and 
dispassionately to hear and judge, might be led to the 
best results. 

But, my lord, all this only shows us how strong is 
the interest we touch. All the loealth of America 
may be said to be interested in it. And, if I may judge 
from the furious and bitter tone of some English papers, 
they also have some sensitive connection with the evil. 

I trust that those noble and jjentle ladies of Eng-land who have in so good a spirit expressed their views 
of the question will not be discouraged by the strong 
abuse that will follow. Eng-land is doin&lt;r us ofood. We 
need the vitality of a disinterested country to warm our 
torpid and benumbed public sentiment. 

Nay, the storm of feeling which the book raises in 
Italy, Germany, and France is all good, though truly 
't is painful for us Americans to bear. The fact is, we 
have become used to this frightful evil, and we need 
the public sentiment of the world to help us. 

I am now writing a work to be called " Key to Uncle 
Tom's Cabin." It contains, in an undeniable form, the 
facts which corroborate all that I have said. One third 
of it is taken up with judicial records of trials and 
decisions, and with statute law. It is a most fearful 



174 UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, 

story, my lord, — I can truly say that I write with lifeblood, but as called of God. I give in my evidence, 
and I hope that England may so fix the attention of the 
world on the facts of which I am the unwilling publisher, that the Southern States may be compelled to 
notice what hitherto they have denied and ignored. If 
they call the fiction dreadful, what will they say of the 
fact, where I cannot deny, suppress, or color ? But it 
is God's will that it must be told, and I am the unwilling agent. 

This coming month of April, my husband and myseK expect to sail for England on the invitation of the 
Anti-Slavery Society of the Ladies and Gentlemen of 
Glasgow, to confer with friends there. 

There are points where English people can do much 
good ; there are also points where what they seek to do 
may be made more efficient by a little communion with 
those who know the feelings and habits of our countrymen : but I am persuaded that England can do much 
for us. 

My lord, they greatly mistake who see, in this movement of English Christians for the abolition of slavery, 
signs of disunion between the nations. It is the purest 
and best proof of friendship England has ever shown 
us, and will, I am confident, be so received. I earnestly 
trust that all who have begun to take in hand the cause 
will be in nothing daunted, but persevere to the end ; 
for though everything else be against us, Christ is certainly on our side and He must at last prevail, and it 
will be done, " not by might, nor by power, but by His 
Spirit." Yours in Christian sincerity, 

H. B. Stowe.

Mr. Arthur Helps : 

My dear Sir, — I cannot but say I am greatly 
obliged to you for the kind opinions exjiressed in your 
letter. On one point, however, it appears that my book 
has not faithfully represented to you the feelings of my 
heart. I mean in relation to the English nation as a 
nation. You will notice that the remarks on that subject occur in the dramatic part of the book, in the 
mouth of an intellioent Southerner. As a fair-minded 
person, bound to state for both sides all that could be 
said in the person of St. Clare, the best that could be 
said on that point, and what I know is in fact constantly reiterated, namely, that the laboring class of 
the South are in many respects, as to physical comfort, 
in a better condition than the poor of England. 

This is the slaveholder's stereotyped apology, — a 
defense it cannot be, unless two wrong's make one riirht. 

It is generally supposed among us that this estimate 
of the relative condition of the slaves and the poor of 
England is correct, and we base our ideas on reports 
made in Parliament and various documentary evidence ; 
also such sketches as " London Labor and London Poor," 
which liave been widely circulated among us. The in
^ Author of Spanish Conquest in America. — Ed. 



176 UNCLE TOM'S CABIN. 

ference, however, Avhicli loe of the freedom party draw 
from it, is not that tlie slave is, on the whole, in the 
best condition because of this striking difference ; that 
in America the slave has not a recoo^nized liuman character 171 law, has not even an existence, whereas in England the law recognizes and protects the meanest subject, in theory alvjays, and mfact to a certain extent. 
A prince of the blood could not strike the meanest 
laborer without a liability to prosecution, in theory at 
least, and that is something. In America any man 
may strike any slave he meets, and if the master does 
not choose to notice it, he has no redress. 

I do not suppose human nature to be widely different 
in England and America. In both countries, when any 
class holds power and wealth by institutions which in 
the long run bring misery on lower classes, they are 
very unwilling still to part with that wealth and power. 
They are unwilling to be convinced that it is their duty, 
and unwilling to do it if they are. It is always so 
everywhere ; it is not English nature or American nature, 
but liuman nature. We have seen in England the battle for popular rights fought step by step with as determined a resistance from parties in possession as the 
slaveholder offers in America. 

There was the same kind of resistance in certain quarters there to the laws restricting the employing of young 
children eighteen hours a day in factories, as there is 
here to the anti-slavery effort. 

Again, in England as in America, there are, in those 
very classes whose interests are most invaded by Avhat 
are called popular rights, some of the most determined 
supporters of them, and here I think that the balance 



ENGLAND AND AMERICA. 177 

preponderates in favor of England. I think there are 
more of the high nobility of England who are friends 
of the common people and willing to help the cause of 
human progress, iirespective of its influence on their own 
interests, than there are those of a similar class among" 
slaveholding aristocracy, though even that class is not 
without such men. But I am far from having any of 
that senseless prejudice against the English nation as a 
nation which, greatly to my regret, I observe sometimes 
in America. It is a relic of barbarism for two such 
nations as England and America to cherish any such 
unworthy prejudice. 

For my own part, I am proud to be of English blood ; 
and thouo'h I do not think England's national course 
faultless, and though I think many of her institutions 
and arrangements capable of much revision and improvement, yet my heart warms to her as, on the whole, 
the strongest, greatest, and best nation on earth. Have 
not England and America one blood, one language, 
one literature, and a glorious literature it is ! Are not 
Milton and Shakespeare, and all the Avise and brave 
and good of old, common to us both, and should there 
be anything but cordiality between countries that have 
so glorious an inheritance in common ? If there is, it 
will be elsewhere than in hearts like mine. 

Sincerely yours, 

H. B. Stowe.

You must feel and know what a deep impression 
" Uncle Tom's Cabin " has made upon every heart that

Forgive me, my dear madam : it is a great liberty I

Andover, February 16, 1853. 

My dear Madam, — I hasten to reply to your letter, 

to me the more interestinof that I have lonof been aces c? 

quainted with you, and during all the nursery part of 
my life made daily use of your poems for children. 

I used to think sometimes in those days that I would 
write to you, and tell you how much I was obUged to 
you for the pleasure which they gave us all. 

So you want to know something about what sort of 
a woman I am ! Well, if this is any object, you shall 
have statistics free of charge. To begin, then, I am a 
little bit of a woman, — somewhat more than forty, about as thin and dry as a pinch of snuff ; never very 
much to look at in my best days, and looking like a 
used-up article now. 

I was married when I was twenty-five years old to a 
man rich in Greek and Hebrew, Latin and Arabic, and, 
alas ! rich in nothing else. When I went to housekeeping, my entire stock of china for parlor and kitchen 
was bought for eleven dollars. That lasted very well 
for two years, till my brother was married and brought 
his bride to visit me. I then found, on review, that I 
had neither plates nor teacups to set a table for my 
father's family ; wherefore I thought it best to reinforce 
the establishment by getting me a tea-set that cost ten 
dollars more, and this, I believe, formed my whole stock 
in trade for some years. 

But then I was abundantly enriched with wealth of 
another sort. 

I had two little, curly-headed twin daughters to begin 
with, and my stock in this line has gradually increased, 
till I have been the mother of seven children, the most 
beautiful and the most loved of whom lies buried near 
my Cincinnati residence. It was at his dying bed and 
at his grave that I learned what a poor slave mother 
may feel when her child is torn away from her. In 
those depths of sorrow which seemed to me immeasurable, it was my only prayer to God that such anguish 
miofht not be suffered in vain. There were circumstances about his death of such pecuHar bitterness, of 
what seemed almost cruel suffering, that I felt that I 
could never be consoled for it, unless this crushing of 
my own heart might enable me to work out some great 
good to others. . . . 

I allude to this here because I have often felt that 
much that is in that book (" Uncle Tom ") had its root 
in the awful scenes and bitter sorrows of that summer. 
It has left now, I trust, no trace on my mind, except a 
deep compassion for the sorrowful, especially for mothers who are separated from their children. 

During long years of strugghng with poverty and 
sickness, and a hot, debilitating climate, my children 
grew up around me. The nursery and the kitchen were 
my principal fields of labor. Some of my friends, pitying my trials, copied and sent a number of little sketches 
from my pen to certain liberally paying " Annuals " 
with my name. With the first money that I earned in 
this way I bought a feather-bed ! for as I had married 
into poverty and without a dowry, and as my husband 
had only a large library of books and a great deal of 
learning, the bed and pillows were thought the most 
profitable investment. After this I thought that I had 
discovered the philosopher's stone. So when a new carpet or mattress was going to be needed, or when, at the 
close of the year, it began to be evident that my family 
accounts, hke poor Dora's, " would n't add up," then I 
used to say to my faithful friend and factotum Anna, 
who shared all my joys and sorrows, " Now, if you will 
keep the babies and attend to the things in the house 
for one day, I '11 write a piece, and then we shall be out 
of the scrape." So I became an author, — very modest 
at first, I do assure you, and remonstrating very seriously with the friends who had thought it best to put 
my name to the pieces by way of getting up a reputation ; and if you ever see a woodcut of me, with an 
immoderately long nose, on the cover of all the U. S. Almanacs, I wish you to take notice, that I have been 
forced into it contrary to my natural modesty by the 
imjjerative sohcitations of my dear five thousand friends 
and the pubHc generally. One thing I must say with 
regard to my life at the West, which you will understand better than many EngUsh women could. 

I hved two miles from the city of Cincinnati, in the 
country, and domestic service, not always you know to 
be found in the city, is next to an impossibihty to obtain in the country, even by those who are willing to 
give the highest wages ; so what was to be expected for 
poor me, who had very Uttle of this world's goods to 
offer ? 

Had it not been for my inseparable friend Anna, a 
noble-hearted English ghl, who landed on our shores 
in destitution and sorrow, and clave to me as Ruth to 
Naomi, I had never hved through all the trials which 
this uncertainty and want of domestic service imposed 
on both : you may imagine, therefore, how glad I was 
when, our seminary property being divided out into 
small lots which were rented at a low price, a number 
of poor famihes settled in our vicinity, from whom we 
could occasionally obtain domestic service. About a 
dozen families of hberated slaves were among- the number, and they became my favorite resort in cases of 
emergency. If anybody wishes to have a black face 
look handsome, let them be left, as I have been, in feeble 
health in oppressive hot weather, with a sick baby in 
arms, and two or three other little ones in the nursery, 
and not a servant in the whole house to do a singfle turn. 
Then, if they could see my good old Aunt Frankie coming with her honest, bluff, black face, her long, strong arms, her chest as big and stout as a barrel, and her 
hilarious, hearty laugh, perfectly delighted to take one's 
washing and do it at a fan* price, they would appreciate 
the beauty of black people. 

My cook, poor Eliza Buck, — how she would stare to 
think of her name going- to England ! — was a regular 
epitome of slave life in herself ; fat, gentle, easy, loving and lovable, always calling my very modest house 
and door-yard " The Place," as if it had been a plantation with seven hundred hands on it. She had hved 
through the whole sad story of a Virginia-raised slave's 
life. In her youth she must have been a very handsome mulatto girl. Her voice was sweet, and her manners refined and agreeable. She was raised in a good 
family as a nurse and seamstress. When the family 
became embarrassed, she was suddenly sold on to a 
plantation in Louisiana. She has often told me how, 
without any warning, she was suddenly forced into a 
carriage, and saw her little mistress screaming and 
stretchino- her arms from the window towards her as 
she was driven away. She has told me of scenes on 
the Louisiana plantation, and she has often been out at 
night by stealth ministering to poor slaves who had 
been mangled and lacerated by the lash. Hence she 
was sold into Kentucky, and her last master was the 
father of all her childien. On this point she ever 
maintained a delicacy and reserve that always appeared 
to me remarkable. She always called him her husband ; 
and it was not till after she had lived with me some 
years that I discovered the real nature of the connection. I shall never forget how sorry I felt for her, nor 
my feehngs at her humble apology, " You know, Mrs. Stowe, slave women cannot help themselves." She had 
two very pretty quadroon daughters, with her beautiful 
hair and eyes, interesting children, whom I had instructed in the family school with my children. Time 
would fail to tell you all that I learned incidentally of 
the slave system in the history of various slaves who 
came into my family, and of the underground railroad 
which, I may say, ran through our house. But the 
letter is already too long. 

You ask with reo^ard to the remuneration which I 
have received for my work here in America. Having 
been poor all my hfe and expecting to be poor the rest 
of it, the idea of making money by a book which I 
wrote just because I could not help it, never occurred 
to me. It was therefore an agreeable surprise to receive ten thousand dollars as the first-fruits of three 
months' sale. I presume as much more is now due. 
Mr. Bosworth in England, the firm of Clarke &amp; Co., 
and Mr. Bentley, have all offered me an interest in the 
sales of their editions in London. I am very glad of 
it, both on account of the value of what they offer, 
and the value of the example they set in this matter, 
wherein I think that justice has been too little regarded. 

I have been invited to visit Scotland, and shall probably spend the summer there and in England. 

I have very much at heart a design to erect in some 
of the Northern States a normal school, for the education of colored teachers in the United States and in 
Canada. I have very much wished that some permanent memorial of good to the colored race might be 
created out of the proceeds of a work Avhich promises 
to have so unprecedented a sale. My own share of the profits will be less than that of the publishers', either 
English or American ; but I am willing to give largely 
for this purpose, and I have no doubt that the publishers, both American and English, will unite with me ; 
for nothing tends more inmiediately to the emancipation of the slave than the education and elevation of 
the free. 

I am now writing a work which will contain, perhaps, 
an equal amount of matter with " Uncle Tom's Cabin." 
It will contain all the facts and documents on which 
that story was founded, and an umnense body of facts, 
reports of trials, legal documents, and testimony of 
people now living South, which will more than confirm 
every statement in " Uncle Tom's Cabin." 

I must confess that till I be&lt;&gt;:an the examination of 
facts in order to write this book, much as I thought I 
knew before, I had not begun to measure the depth of 
the abyss. The law records of courts and judicial proceedino's are so incredible as to fill me with amazement 
whenever I think of them. It seems to me that the 
book cannot but be felt, and, coming upon the sensibility awaked by the other, do something. 

I suffer exquisitely in writing these things. It may 
be truly said that I write with my heart's blood. Many 
times in writing " Uncle Tom's Cabin " I thought my 
health would fail utterly ; but I prayed earnestly that 
God would help me till I got through, and still I am 
pressed beyond measure and above strength. 

This horror, this nightmare abomination ! can it be 
in my country ! It lies like lead on my heart, it 
shadows my life with sorrow ; the more so that I feel, 
as for my own brothers, for the South, and am pained by every horror I am obliged to write, as one who is 
forced by some awful oath to disclose in court some 
family disgrace. Many times I have thought that I 
must die, and yet I pray God that I may Hve to see 
something done. I shall in all probabihty be m London in May : shall I see you ? 

It seems to me so odd and dream-like that so many 
persons desire to see me, and now I cannot help thinking that they will think, when they do, that God hath 
chosen " the weak thinofs of this world." 

If I Hve till spring I shall hope to see Shakespeare's 
grave, and Milton's mulberry-tree, and the good land of 
my fathers, — old, old England ! May that day come ! 

Yours affectionately, 

H. B. Stowe.

Liverpool, ApiHl 11, 1853. 

My dear Children, — You wish, first of all, to 
hear of the voyage. Let me assure you, my dears, in 
the very commencement of the matter, that going to 
sea is not at all the thing that we have taken it to be. 

Let me warn you, if you ever go to sea, to omit all preparations for amusement on shipboard. Don't leave 
so much as the unlocking of a trunk to be done after 
saihng. In the few precious minutes when the ship 
stands still, before she weighs her anchor, set your 
house, that is to say your stateroom, as much in order 
as if you were going to be hanged ; place everything 
in the most convenient position to be seized without 
trouble at a moment's notice ; for be sure that in half 
an hour after sailing, an infinite desperation will seize 
you, in which the grasshopper will be a burden. If 
anything is in your trunk, it might almost as well be 
m the sea, for any practical probability of your getting 
to it. 

Our voyage out was called " a good run." It was 
voted unanimously to be " an extraordinary good passage," " a pleasant voyage ; " yet the ship rocked the 
whole time from side to side with a steady, dizzy, continuous motion, like a great cradle. I had a new sympathy for babies, poor little things, who are rocked 
hours at a time without so much as a " by your leave " 
in the case. No wonder there are so many stupid people in the world ! 

We arrived on Sunday morning : the custom-house 
officers, very gentlemanly men, came on board ; our 
luggage was all set out, and passed through a rapid 
examination, which in many cases amounted only to 
opening the trunk and shutting it, and all was over. 
The whole ceremony did not occupy two hours. 

We were inquiring of some friends for the most convenient hotel, when we found the son of Mr. Cropper, 
of Dingle Bank, waiting in the cabin to take us with 
him to their hospitable abode. In a few moments after the baggage had been examined, we all bade adieu to 
the old ship, and went on board the Httle steam tender 
which carries passengers up to the city. 

This Mersey River would be a very beautiful one, if 
it were not so dingy and muddy. As we are sailing 
up in the tender towards Liverpool, I deplore the circumstance feehngly. 

" What does make this river so muddy ? " 

" Oh, says a by-stander, " don't you know that 

" ' The quality of mercy is not strained ' ? " 

I had an early opportunity of making acquaintance 
with my English brethren ; for, much to my astonishment, I found quite a crowd on the wharf, and we 
walked up to our carriage through a long lane of people, bowing, and looking very glad to see us. 

When I came to get into the hack it was surrounded 
by more faces than I could count. They stood very 
quietly, and looked very kindly, though evidently very 
much determined to look. Something prevented the 
hack from moving on ; so the interview was prolonged 
for some time. 

Our carriage at last drove on, taking us through 
Liverpool and a mile or two out, and at length wound 
its way along the gravel paths of a beautiful little retreat, on the banks of the Mersey, called the " Dingle." 
It opened to my eyes Hke a paradise, all wearied as I 
was with the tossino; of the sea. I have since become 
familiar with these beautiful little spots, w^hich are so 
common in England ; but now all was entirely new to me. 

After a short season allotted to changing our sliip 
garments and for rest, we found ourselves seated at the 



208 SUNNY MEMORIES. 

dinner table. While dining, the sister-in-law of our 
friends came in from the next door, to exchange a word 
or two of welcome, and invite us to breakfast with 
them the following morning. 

The next morning we slept late and hurried to dress, 
remembering our engagement to breakfast with the 
brother of our host, whose cottage stands on the same 
ground, within a few steps of our own. I had not the 
slightest idea of what the English mean by a breakfast, 
and therefore went in all innocence, supposing I should 
see nobody but the family circle of my acquaintances. 
Quite to my astonishment, I found a party of between 
thirty and forty people ; ladies sitting with their 
bonnets on, as in a morning call. It was impossible, 
however, to feel more than a momentary embarrassment in the friendly warmth and cordiality of the circle 
by whom we were surrounded. 

In the evening I went into Liverpool to attend a 
party of friends of the anti-slavery cause. When I 
was going away, the lady of the house said that the 
servants were anxious to see me ; so I came into the 
dressing-room to give them an opportunity. 

The next day was appointed to leave Liverpool. A 
great number of friends accompanied us to the cars, 
and a beautiful bouquet of flowers was sent with a very 
affecting message from a sick gentleman, who, from the 
retirement of his chamber, felt a desire to testify his 
sympathy. We left Liverpool mth hearts a little tremulous and excited by the vibration of an atmosphere of 
universal sympathy and kindness, and found ourselves, 
at length, shut from the warm adieu of our friends, in 
a snug compartment of the railroad car. 



FIRST GLIMPSES OF SCOTLAND. 209 

" Dear me ! " said Mr. S. ; " six Yankees sliut up in 
a car together ! Not one Englishman to tell us anything about the country ! Just like the six old ladies 
that made their living by taking tea at each other's 
houses ! " 

What a bright lookout we kept for ruins and old 
houses ! Mr. S., whose eyes are always in every place, 
allowed none of us to slumber, but looking out, first on 
his own side and then on ours, called our attention to 
every visible thing. If he had been appointed on a 
mission of inquiry, he could not have been more zealous 
and faithful, and I began to think that our desire for 
an English cicerone was quite superfluous. 

Well, we are in Scotland at last, and now our pulse 
rises as the sun declines in the west. We catch glimpses 
of Solway Frith and talk about Redgauntlet. The sun 
went down and night drew on ; still we were in Scotland. Scotch ballads, Scotch tunes, and Scotch literature were in the ascendant. We sanof " Auld Lang" 
Syne," "Scots wha hae," and "Bonnie Doon," and 
then, changing the key, sang " Dundee," " Elgin," and 
" Martyr." 

" Take care," said Mr. S. ; " don't get too much excited." 

" Ah," said I, " this is a thing that comes only once 
in a lifetime ; do let us have the comfort of it. We 
shall never come into Scotland for the^^rs^ time again." 

While we were thus at the fusion point of enthusiasm, the cars stopped at Lockerbie. All was dim and 
dark outside, but we soon became conscious that there 
was quite a numl)er of people collected, peering into 
the window ; and with a strange kind of thrill, I heard 



210 SUNNY MEMORIES. 

my name inquired for in the Scottish accent. I went 
to the window ; there were men, women, and children 
gathered, and hand after hand was presented, with the 
words, " Ye 're welcome to Scotland ! " 

Then they inquired for and shook hands with all 
the party, having in some mysterious manner got the 
knowledge of who they were, even down to little G., 
whom they took to be my son. Was it not pleasant, 
when I had a heart so warm for this old country ? I 
shall never forget the thrill of those words, " Ye 're 
welcome to Scotland," nor the " Gude night." 

After that we found similar welcomes in many succeeding stopping - places ; and though I did wave a 
towel out of the window, instead of a pocket handkerchief, and commit other awkwardnesses, from not knoAving how to play my part, yet I fancied, after all, that 
Scotland and we were coming on well together. Who 
the good souls were that were thus watching for us 
through the night, I am sure I do not know ; but that 
they were of the " one blood " which unites all the 
families of the earth, I felt. 

At Glasor-ow, friends were waiting^ in the stationhouse. Earnest, eager, friendly faces, ever so many. 
Warm greetings, kindly words. A crowd parting in 
the middle, through which we were conducted into a 
carriage, and loud cheers of welcome, sent a throb, as 
the voice of living Scotland. 

I looked out of the carriage, as we drove on, and 
saw, by the light of a lantern, Argyll Street. It was 
past twelve o'clock when I found myself in a warm, 
cosy parlor, with friends whom I have ever since been 
glad to remember. In a little time we were all safely 



PUBLIC RECEPTIONS. 211 

housed in our hospitable apartments, and sleep fell on 
me for the first time in Scotland. 

The next morning I awoke worn and weary, and 
scarce could the charms of the social Scotch breakfast 
restore me. 

Our friend and host was Mr. Bailie Paton. I believe 
that it is to his suggestion in a public meeting that we 
owe the invitation which brought us to Scotland. 

After breakfast the visiting began. First, a friend 
of the family, with three beautiful children, the youngest of whom was the bearer of a handsomely bound album, containing a pressed collection of the sea-mosses 
of the Scottish coast, very \dvid and beautiful. 

All this day is a confused di-eam to me of a dizzy 
and overwhelming kind. So many letters that it took 
brother Charles from nine in the morning till two in 
the afternoon to read and answer them in the shortest 
manner ; letters from all classes of people, high and 
low, rich and poor, in all shades and styles of composition, poetry and prose ; some mere outbursts of feeling ; some invitations ; some advice and suggestions ; 
some requests and inquiries ; some presenting books, or 
flowers, or fruit. 

Then came, in their turn, deputations from Paisley, 
Greenock, Dundee, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, and Belfast 
in Ireland ; calls of friendship, invitations of all descriptions to go everywhere, and to see everything, and 
to stay in so many places. One kind, venerable minister, with his lovely daughter, offered me a retreat in 
his quiet manse on the beautiful shores of the Clyde. 

For all these kindnesses, what could 1 give in return ? 
There was scarce time for even a grateful thought on each. People liave often said to me that it must have 
been an exceeding bore. For my part, I could not 
think of regarding it so. It only oppressed me with an 
unutterable sadness. 

In the afternoon I rode out with the lord provost to 
see the cathedraL The lord provost answers to the 
lord mayor in England. His title and office in both 
countries continue only a year, except in case of reelection. ^ 

As I saw the way to the cathedral blocked up by a 
throng of people who had come out to see me, I could 
not help saying, " What went ye out for to see ? a 
reed shaken with the wind ? " In fact I was so worn 
out that I could hardly walk through the building. 
The next morning I was so ill as to need a physician, 
unable to see any one that called, or to hear any of the 
letters. I passed most of the day in bed, but in the 
evening I had to get up, as I had engaged to drink tea 
with two thousand people. Our land friends. Dr. and 
Mrs. Wardlaw, came after us, and Mr. S. and I went in 
the carriage with them. Our carriage stopped at last 
at the place. I have a dim remembrance of a way being made for us through a great crowd all round the 
house, and of going with Mrs. Wardlaw up into a 
dressing-room where I met and shook hands with many 
friendly people. Then we passed into a gallery, where 
a seat was reserved for our party, directly in front of 
the audience. Our friend Bailie Paton presided. Mrs. 
Wardlaw and I sat together, and around us many 
friends, chiefly ministers of the different churches, the 
ladies and gentlemen of the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society and others. I told you it was a tea-party ; but the arrangements were altogether different from any I 
had ever seen. There were narrow tahles stretched up 
and down the whole extent of the great hall, and everj 
person had an appointed seat. These tahles were set 
out with cups and saucers, cakes, hiscuit, etc., and when 
the proper time came, attendants passed along serving 
tea. The arrangements were so accurate and methodical that the whole multitude actually took tea together, 
without the least apparent inconvenience or disturhance. 

There was a gentle, suhdued murmur of conversation 
all over the house, the sociahle clinking of teacups and 
teaspoons, while the entertainment was going on. It 
seemed to me such an odd idea, I could not help wondering what sort of a teapot that must be in which all 
this tea for two thousand people was made. Truly, as 
Hadji Baba says, I think they must have had the 
" father of all the tea-kettles " to boil it in. I could 
not help wondering if old mother Scotland had put two 
thousand teaspoonfuls of tea for the company, and one 
for the teapot, as is our good Yankee custom. 

We had quite a sociable time up in our gallery. Our 
tea-table stretched quite across, and we drank tea in 
sight of all the people. By we, I mean a great number of ministers and their wives, and ladies of the AntiSlavery Society, besides our party, and the friends 
whom I have mentioned before. All seemed to be enjoying themselves. 

After tea they sang a few verses of the seventy-second psalm in the old Scotch version. 

April 17. To-day a large party of us started on a 
small steamer to go down the Clyde. It was a trip full 
of pleasure and incident. Now we were shown the remains of old Cardross Castle, where it was said Robert 
Bruce breathed his last. And now we came near the 
beautiful gi-ounds of Roseneath, a green, velvet-like peninsula, stretching out into the widening waters. 

Somewhere about here I was presented, by his own 
request, to a broad-shouldered Scotch farmer, who stood 
some six feet two, and who paid me the compliment to 
say that he had read my book, and that he would walk 
six miles to see me any day. Such a, flattering evidence 
of discrmiinating taste, of course, disposed my heart 
towards him ; but when I went up and put my hand 
into his great prairie of a palm, I was as a grasshoj)per 
in my own eyes. I inquired who he was and was told 
he was one of the Duke of Argyll's farmers. I thought 
to myself if all the duke's farmers were of this pattern, 
that he might be able to speak to the enemy in the 
gates to some purpose. 

It was concluded after we left Roseneath that, instead 
of returning by the boat, we shoidd take carriage and 
ride home along- the banks of the river. In our carriage were Mr. S. and myself, Dr. Robson, and Lady 
Anderson. About this time I commenced my first essay towards giving titles, and made, as you may suppose, rather an odd piece of work of it, generally saying " Mrs." first, and " Lady " afterwards, and then 
begging pardon. Lady Anderson laughed and said 
she would give me a general absolution. She is a truly 
genial, hearty Scotchwoman, and seemed to enter happily into the spirit of the hour. 

As we rode on, we found that the news of our coming had spread through the village. People came and 
stood in their doors, beckoning, bowing, smihng, and waving their handkerchiefs, and the carriage was several times stopped by persons who came to offer flowers. 
I remember, in particular, a group of young gii'ls bringin ir to the carriaij-e two of the most beautiful children 
I ever saw, whose little hands hterally deluged us with 
flowers. 

At the village of Helensburgh we stopped a little 
while to call upon Mrs. Bell, the wife of Mr. Bell, the 
inventor of the steamboat. His invention in this country was at about the same time as that of Fulton in 
America. Mrs. Bell came to the carriage to speak to 
us. She is a venerable woman, far advanced in years. 
They had prepared a lunch for us, and quite a number 
of people had come together to meet us, but our friends 
said there was not time for us to stop. 

We rode through several villages after this, and met 
everywhere a warm welcome. What pleased me was, 
that it was not mainly from the literary, nor the rich, 
nor the great, but the plain, common people. The 
butcher came out of his stall and the baker from his 
shop, the miller dusty with flour, the blooming, comely 
young mother, with her baby in her arms, all smiling 
and bowing, with that hearty, intelligent, friendly look, 
as if they knew we should be glad to see them. 

Once, while we stopped to change horses, I, for the 
sake of seeing something more of the country, walked 
on. It seems the honest landlord and his wife were 
gTeatly disappointed at this ; however, they got into 
the carriage and rode on to see me, and I shook hands 
with them with a right good will. 

We saw several of the clergymen, who came out to 
meet usj and I remember stopping just to be introduced, one by one, to a most delightful family, a grayheaded father and mother, with eom-elv brothers and 
fau' sisters, all looldng so kindly and homelilie, that I 
should have been glad to accept the mvitation they 
gave me to their dwelhng* 

This day has been a strange phenomenon to me. In 
the first place, I have seen in all these villages how 
universally the people read. I have seen how capable 
they are of a generous excitement and enthusiasm, and 
how much may be done by a work of fiction so written as to enlist those sympathies which are common to 
all classes. Certamly a great deal may be effected in 
this way, if God gives to any one the power, as I hope 
he will to many. The power of fictitious writing, for 
good as well as evil, is a thing which ought most seriously to be reflected on. No one can fail to see that 
in our day it is becomhig a very great agency. 

We came home quite tired, as you may well suppose. 
You will not be surprised that the next day I found 
myself more disposed to keep my bed than go out. 

Two days later : We bade farewell to Glasgow, overwhelmed with kindness to the last, and only oj)pressed 
by the thought of how little that was satisfactory we 
were able to give in return. Again we were in the railroad car on our way to Edinburgh. A pleasant two 
hours' trip is this from Glasgow to Edinburgh. When 
the cars stopped at Linlithgow station, the name started 
us as out of a dream. 

In Edinburgh the ears stopped amid a crowd of people who had assembled to meet us. The lord provost 
met us at the door of the car, and presented us to the 
magistracy of the city and the committees of the Edinburgh Anti-Slavery Societies. The drab dresses and 
pure white bonnets of many Friends were conspicuous 
among the dense moving- crowd, as white doves seen 
against a dark cloud. Mr. S. and myself, and our 
future hostess, Mrs. Wigham, entered the carriage with 
the lord provost, and away we drove, the crowd following with tlieii" shouts and cheers. I was inexpressibly 
touched and affected by this. While we were passing 
the monument of Scott, I felt an oppressive melancholy. What a moment life seems in the presence of 
the noble dead ! What a momentary thing is art, in 
all its beauty ! Where are all those great souls that 
have created such an atmosphere of light about Edinburgh ? and how little a space was given them to l^ve 
and enjoy ! 

We drove all over Edinburgh, up to the castle, to the 
university, to Holp-ood, to the hospitals, and through 
many of the principal streets, amid shouts, and smiles, 
and greetings. Some boys amused me very much by 
their pertinacious attempts to keep up with the carriage. 

" Heck," says one of them, " that 's her ; see the 
coiirls ! " 

The various engravers who have amused themselves 
by diversifying my face for the public having all, with 
great unanimity, agreed in giving prominence to this 
point, I suppose the urchins thought they were on safe 
ground there. I certainly think I answered one good 
purpose that day, and that is of giving the much-oppressed and calumniated class called boys an opportunity to develop all the noise that was in them, — a thing 
for which I think they must bless me in their remembrances. 

At last the carriage drove into a deep-graveled yard, 
and we alighted at a porch covered with green ivy, and 
found ourselves once more at home. 

You may spare your anxieties about me, for I do assure you that if I were an old Sevres china jar I could 
not have more careful handluig than I do. Everybody 
is considerate ; a great deal to say when there appears 
to be so much excitement. Everybody seems to understand how good-for-nothing I am ; and yet, with all 
this consideration, I have been obliged to keep my room 
and bed for a good part of the time. Of the multitudes who have called, I have seen scarcely any. 

To-morrow evening is to be the great tea-party here. 
How in the world I am ever to live throuoh it I don't 
know. 

The amount of letters we found waitino- for us here 
in Edinburgh was, if possible, more appalling than in 
Glasgow. Among those from persons whom you would 
be interested in hearing of, I may mention a very kind 
and beautiful one from the Duchess of Sutherland, and 
one also from the Earl of Carlisle, both desiring to 
make appointments for meeting us as soon as we come 
to London. Also a very kind and interesting note from 
the Rev. Mr. Kingsley and lady. I look forward with 
a great deal of interest to passing a httle time with 
them in their rectory. 

As to all engagements, I am in a state of happy acquiescence, having resigned myself, as a very tame lion, 
into the hands of my keepers. Whenever the time 
comes for me to do anything, I try to behave as well as 
I can, which, as Dr. Young says, is all that an angel 
could do under the same chcumstances. 

Ajyr'd 26. Last night came off the soiree. The 
hall was handsomely decorated with flags in front. 
We went with the lord provost in his carriage. We 
went up as before into a dressing-room, where I was 
presented to many gentlemen and ladies. When we go 
in, the cheering, clapping, and stamping at first strikes 
one with a strange sensation ; but then everybody looks 
so heartily pleased and delighted, and there is such an 
all-pervading atmosphere of geniality and sympathy, as 
makes me in a few moments feel quite at home. After 
all, I consider that these cheers and applauses are Scotland's voice to America, a recognition of the brotherhood of the countries. 

The national penny offering, consisting of a thousand golden sovereigns on a magnificent silver salver, 
stood conspicuously in view of the audience. It has 
been an unsolicited offering, given in the smallest sums, 
often from the extreme poverty of the giver. The 
committee who collected it in Edinburgh and Glasgow 
bore witness to the willingness with which the very 
poorest contributed the offering of their sympathy. In 
one cottage they found a blind woman, and said, 
" Here, at least, is one who will feel no interest, as she 
cannot have read the book." 

" Indeed," said the old lady, " if I cannot read, my 
son has read it to me, and I 've got my penny saved to 
ofive. 

It is to my mind extremely touching to see how the 
poor, in their poverty, can be moved to a generosity 
surpassing that of the rich. Nor do I mourn that they 
took it from their slender store, because I know that a 
penny given from a kindly impulse is a gi-eater comfort and blessing to the poorest giver than even a penny received. 

As in the case of the other meeting, we came out 
long before the speeches were ended. Well, of course 
I did not sleep all night, and the next day I felt quite 
miserable. 

From Edinburgh we took cars for Aberdeen. I enjoyed this ride more than anything we had seen yet, the 
country was so wild and singular. In the afternoon we 
came in sight of the German Ocean. The free, bracing air from the sea, and the thought that it actually 
was the German Ocean, and that over the other side 
was Norway, within a day's sail of us, gave it a strange, 
romantic charm. It was towards the close of the afternoon that we found ourselves crossing the Dee, in view 
of Aberdeen. My spirits were wonderfully elated : the 
grand scenery and fine, bracing air ; the noble, distant 
view of the city, rising with its harbor and shipping, — ■ 
aU filled me with delight. In this propitious state, disposed to be pleased with everything, our hearts responded warmly to the greetings of the many friends 
who were waitino- for us at the station-house. 

The lord provost received us into his carriage, and 
as we drove along pointed out to us the various objects 
of interest in the beautiful town. Among other things, 
a fine old bridge across the Dee attracted our particular 
attention. We were conducted to the house of Mr. 
Cruikshank, a Friend, and found waiting for us there 
the thoughtful hospitality which we had ever experienced in all our stopping-places. A snug little quiet 
supper was laid out upon the table, of Avhicli we partook in haste, as we were informed that the assembly at 
the hall were waiting to receive us. 

There arrived, we found the hall crowded, and with 
difficulty made our way to the platform. Whether 
owino' to the stimulatino; effect of the air from the 
ocean, or to the comparatively social aspect of the scene, 
or perhaps to both, certain it is that we enjoyed the 
meetino' with oreat zest. I Avas surrounded on the stase 
with blooming young ladies, one of whom put into my 
hands a beautiful bouquet, some flowers of which I 
have now, dried, in my album. The refreshment tables 
were adorned with some exquisite wax flowers, the work, 
as I was afterwards told, of a young- lady in the place. 
One of these designs especially interested me. It was 
a group of water-lilies resting on a mirror, which gave 
them the appearance of growing in the water. 

We had some very animated speaking, in which the 
speakers contrived to blend enthusiastic admiration and 
love for America with detestation of slavery. 

They presented an offering in a beautiful embroidered purse, and after much shaking of hands we went 
home, and sat down to the supper-table for a little more 
chat before jjoins: to bed. The next morninir — as we 
had only till noon to stay in Aberdeen — our friends, 
the lord provost and Mr. Leslie, the architect, came immediately after brealifast to show us the place. 

About two o'clock we started from Aberdeen, among 
crowds of friends, to whom we bade farewell with real 
reo-ret. 

At Stonehaven station, Avhere we stopped a few minutes, there was quite a gathering of the inhabitants to 
exchange greetings, and afterwards, at successive stations along the road, many a kindly face and voice made 
our journey a pleasant one. 

When we got into Dundee it seemed all alive with 
welcome. We went in the carriage with the lord provost, Mr. Thoms, to his residence, where a party had 
been waiting dinner for us for some time. 

The meeting in the evening was in a large church, 
densely crowded, and conducted much as the others 
had been. When they came to sing the closing hymn, 
I hoped they would sing Dundee ; but they did not, 
and I fear in Scotland, as elsewhere, the characteristic 
national melodies are giving way before more modern 
ones. 

We left Dundee at two o'clock, by cars, for Edinburgh again, and in the evening attended another soiree 
of the workingmen of Edinburgh. We have received 
letters from the workingmen, both in Dundee and 
Glasgow, desiring our return to attend soirees in those 
cities. Nothing could give us greater pleasure, had we 
time or strength. The next day we had a few calls to 
make, and an invitation from Lady Drummond to visit 
classic Hawthornden, which, however, we had not time 
to accept. In the forenoon, Mr. S. and I called on 
Lord and Lady Gainsborough. Though she is one of 
the queen's household, she is staying here at Edinburgh 
while the queen is at Osborne. I infer, therefore, that 
the appointment includes no very onerous duties. The 
Earl of Gainsboroug-h is the eldest brother of the Rev. 
Baptist W. Noel. 

It was a rainy, misty morning when I left my kind 
retreat and friends in Edinburgh. Considerate as everybody had been about imposing on my time or strength, 
still you may well beheve that I was much exhausted. 
We left Edinburgh, therefore, with the determination to plunge at once into some liulden and unknown spot, 
where we might spend two or three days quietly by ourselves ; and remembering your Sunday at Stratf ord-onAvon, I proposed that we should go there. As Stratford, hoAvever, is off the railroad line, we determined to 
accept the invitation, which was lying by us, from our 
friend, Joseph Sturge, of Birmingham, and take sanctuary with him. So we wrote on, intrusting him with the 
secret, and charging him on no account to let any one 
know of our arrival. 

About night our cars whizzed into the depot at Birmingham ; but just before we came in a difficulty was 
started in the company. " Mr. Sturge is to be there 
waiting for us, but he does not know us and we don't 
know him ; what is to be done ? " C. insisted that 
he should know him by instinct ; and so, after we 
reached the de})ot, we told him to sally out and try. 
Sure enough, in a few moments he pitched upon a 
cheerful, middle-aged gentleman, with a moderate but 
not decisive broad brim to his hat, and challenged him 
as Mr. Sturofe. The result verified the truth that " instinct is a jrreat matter." In a few moments our new 
friend and ourselves were snugly encased in a fly, trotting off as briskly as ever we could to his place at 
Edgbaston, nobody a whit the wiser. You do not 
know how pleased we felt to think we had done it so 
nicely. 

As we were drinking tea that evening, Elihu Burritt 
came in. It Avas the first time I had ever seen him, 
though I had heard a great deal of him from our 
friends in Edinburgh. He is a man in middle life, tall 
and slender, with fair complexion, blue eyes, an air of delicacy and refinement, and manners of great gentleness. My ideas of the " learned blacksmith " had been 
of something altogether more ponderous and peremptory. Elihu has been for some years operating, in England and on the Continent, in a movement which many 
in our half-Christianized times regcard with as much 
increduhty as the grim, old warhke barons did the suspicious imbecilities of reading and writing. The sword 
now, as then, seems so much more direct a way to terminate controversies, that many Christian men, even, cannot conceive how the world is to 2"et alonsf without it. 

We spent the evening in talking over various topics 
relating to the anti-slavery movement. Mr. Sturge was 
very confident that something more was to be done than 
had ever been done yet, by combinations for the encouragement of free in the place of slave grown 
produce ; a question which has, ever since the days of 
Clarkson, more or less deeply occupied the minds of 
abolitionists in England. I should say that Mr. Sturge 
in his family has for many years conscientiously forborne the use of any article produced by slave labor. I 
could scarcely believe it possible that there could be 
such an abundance and variety of all that is comfortable 
and desirable in the various departments of household 
living within these limits. Mr. Sturge presents the 
subject with very great force, the more so from the 
consistency of his example. 

The next morning, as we were sitting down to breakfast, our friends sent in to me a plate of the largest, 
finest strawberries I have ever seen, which, considering 
that it was only the latter part of April, seemed to me 
quite an astonishing luxury. 

Before we left, we had agreed to meet a circle of 
friends from Birmingham, consisting of the Abolition 
Society there, which is of long standing, extending back 
in its memories to the very commencement of the agitation under Clarkson and Wilberforce. The windows 
of the parlor were opened to the ground ; and the company invited filled not only the room, but stood in a 
crowd on the grass around the window. Among the 
peaceable company present was an admiral in the navy, 
a fine, cheerful old gentleman, who entered with hearty 
interest into the scene. 

A throng of friends accompanied us to the depot, 
while from Birmingham we had the pleasure of the 
company of Elihu Burritt, and enjoyed a delightful run 
to London, where we arrived towards evening. 

At the station-house in London we found the Rev. 
Messrs. Binney and Sherman waiting for us with carriages. C. went with Mr. Sherman, and Mr. S. and 
I soon found ourselves in a charming retreat called 
Rose Cottage, in Walworth, about which I will tell 
you more anon. Mrs. B. received us with every attention which the most thoughtful hospitality could suggest. One of the first things she said to me after we 
got into our room was, " Oh, we are so glad you have 
come ! for we are all going to the lord mayor's dinner 
to-night, and you are invited." So, though I was tired, 
I hurried to dress in all the glee of meeting an adventure. As soon as Mr. and Mrs. B. and the rest of the 
party were ready, crack went the whip, round went the 
wheels, and away we drove. 

We found a considerable throng, and I was glad to 
accept a seat which was offered me in the agreeable vicinity of the lady mayoress, so that I might see what 
would be interesting to me of the ceremonial. 

A very dignified gentleman, dressed in black velvet, 
with a fine head, made his way through the throng, 
and sat down by me, introducing himself as Lord Chief 
Baron Pollock. He told me he had just been reading 
the legal part of the " Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin," 
and remarked especially on the opinion of Judge 
Ruffin, in the case of State v. Mann, as havmg made 
a deep impression on his mind. 

Dinner was announced between nine and ten o'clock, 
and we were conducted into a splendid hall, where the 
tables were laid. 

Directly opposite me was Mr. Dickens, whom I now 
beheld for the first time, and was surprised to see looking so young. Mr. Justice Talfourd, known as the 
author of " Ion," was also there with his lady. She 
had a beautiful, antique cast of head. The lord mayor 
was simply dressed in black, without any other adornment than a massive gold chain. We rose from table 
between eleven and twelve o'clock — that is, we ladies 
— and went into the drawing-room, where I was presented to Mrs. Dickens and several other ladies. Mrs. 
Dickens is a good specimen of a truly English woman ; 
tall, large, and well developed, with fine, healthy color, 
and an air of frankness, cheerfulness, and reliabihty. 
A friend whispered to me that she was as observing 
and fond of humor as her husband. 

After a while the gentlemen came back to the drawing-room, and I had a few moments of very pleasant, 
friendly conversation with Mr. Dickens. They are both 
people that one could not know a little of without desiring to know more. 

After a little we began to talk of separating ; the 
lord mayor to take his seat in the House of Commons, 
and the rest of the party to any other engagement that 
might he upon their list. 

" Come, let us go to the House of Commons," said 
one of my friends, " and make a night of it." " With 
all my heart," replied I, " if I only had another body 
to go into to-morrow." 

What a convenience in sioht-seeinof it would be if 
one coidd have a relay of bodies as of clothes, and shp 
from one into the other ! But we, not used to the London style of turning night into day, are full weary 
already. So good-night to you all.

Rose Cottage, Walworth, London, May 2, 1856. 

My DEAR, — This morning Mrs. Follen called and 
we had quite a chat. We are separated by the whole 
city. She hves at the West End, while I am down here 
in Walworth, which is one of the postscripts of London, for this place has as many postscripts as a lady's 
letter. This evening we dined with the Earl of Carlisle. 
There was no company but ourselves, for he, with great 
consideration, said in his note that he thought a little 
quiet would be the best thing he could offer. 

Lord CarHsle is a great friend to America, and so is 
his sister, the Duchess of Sutherland. He is the only 
English traveler who ever wrote notes on our country 
m a real spirit of appreciation. 

We went about seven o'clock, the dinner hour being 
here somewhere between eight and nine. We were 
shown into an ante-room adjoining the entrance hall, 
and from that into an adjacent apartment, where we 
met Lord Carhsle. The room had a pleasant, social air, warmed and enlivened by the blaze of a coal fire and wax candles. 

We had never, any of us, met Lord Carlisle before ; 
but the considerateness and cordiality of our reception 
obviated whatever embarrassment there mioht have 
been in this circumstance. In a few moments after we 
were all seated, a servant announced the Duchess of 
Sutherland, and Lord Carhsle presented me. She is tall 
and stately, with a most noble bearing. Her fair complexion, blonde hair, and full lips speak of Saxon blood. 

The only person present not of the family connection was my quondam correspondent in America, Arthur 
Helps. Somehow or other I had formed the impression from his writings that he was a venerable sage of 
very advanced years, who contemplated life as an aged 
hermit from the door of his cell. Conceive my surprise to find a genial young gentleman of about twentyfive, Avho looked as if he might enjoy a joke as well as 
another man. 

After the ladies left the table, the conversation 
turned on the Maine law, which seems to be considered 
over here as a phenomenon in legislation, and many of 
the gentlemen present inquired about it with great 
curiosity. 

After the gentlemen rejoined us, the Duke and 
Duchess of Argyll came in, and Lord and Lady Blantyre. These ladies are the dau"fhters of the Duchess 
of Sutherland. The Duchess of Argyll is of slight 
and fairy-like figure, Math flaxen hair and blue eyes, 
answering well enough to the description of Annot 
Lyle in the Legend of Montrose. Lady Blantyre was 
somewhat taller, of fuller figure, with a very brilHant bloom. Lord Blantyre is of the Stuart blood, a tall 
and slender young man with very graceful manners. 

As to the Duke of Argyll, we found that the picture 
draAvn of him by his countrymen in Scotland was in 
every way correct. Though slight of figure, with fair 
complexion and blue eyes, his whole appearance is indicative of energy and vivacity. His talents and efficiency have made him a member of the British Cabinet 
at a much earher age than is usual ; and he has distinguished himself not only in political life, but as a 
writer, having given to the world a work on Presbyterianism, embracing an analysis of the ecclesiastical 
history of Scotland since the Reformation, which is 
spoken of as written with great abihty, and in a most 
liberal spirit. He made many inquiries about our distinguished men, particularly of Emerson, Longfellow, 
and Hawthorne ; also of Prescott, who appears to be a 
general favorite here. I felt at the moment that we 
never value our own literary men so much as when we 
are placed in a circle of intelligent foreigners. 

The following evening we went to dine with our old 
friends of the Dingle, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Cropper, 
who are now spending a little time in London. We 
were deliofhted to meet them once more and to hear 
from our Liverpool friends. Mrs. Cropper's father. 
Lord Denman, has returned to England, though with 
no sensible improvement in his health. 

At dinner we were inti*oduced to Lord and Lady 
Hatherton. Lady Hatherton is a person of great cultivation and intelHgence, warmly interested in all the 
progressive movements of the day ; and I gained much 
information in her society. There were also present Sir Charles and Lady Trevelyan ; the former holds an 
appointment at the treasury, and Lady Trevelyan is a 
sister of Macaulay. 

In the evening quite a circle came in, among others 
Lady Emma Campbell, sister of the Duke of Argyll ; 
the daughters of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who 
very kindly invited me to visit them at Lambeth ; and 
Mr. Arthur Helps, besides many others whose names I 
need not mention. 

3Iaij 7. This evening our house was opened in a 
general way for callers, who were coming and going all 
the evening:. I think there must have been over two 
hundred people, among them Martin Farquhar Tupper, 
a little man with fresh, rosy complexion and cheery, 
joyous manners ; and Mary Howitt, just such a cheerful, sensible, fireside companion as we find her in her 
books, — winning love and trust the very first moment 
of the interview. 

The general topic of remark on meeting me seems to 
be, that I am not so bad-looking as they were afraid I 
was ; and I do assure you that when I have seen the 
things that are put up in the shop windows here with 
my name under them, I have been in wondering admiration at the boundless loving-kindness of my English 
and Scottish friends in keeping up such a warm heart 
for such a Gorgon. I shoidd think that the Sphinx in 
the London Museum mi&lt;*:lit have sat for most of them. 
I am going to make a collection of these portraits to 
bring home to you. There is a great variety of them, 
and they will be useful, like the Irishman's guide-board, 
which showed where the road did not go. 

Before the evening: was throuoh I was talked out and worn out ; there was hardly a chip of me left. 
To-morrow at eleven o'clock comes the meetino- at Stafford House. What it will amount to I do not know ; 
but I take no thought for the morrow. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

May 8. 

My dear C, — In fulfillment of my agreement I 
will tell you, as nearly as I can remember, all the details of the meeting at Stafford House. At about 
eleven o'clock we drove under the arched carriage-way 
of a mansion externally not very showy in appearance. 

When the duchess appeared, I thought she looked 
handsomer by daylight than in the evening. She received us with the same warm and simple kindness 
which she had shown before. We were presented to 
the Duke of Sutherland. He is a tall, slender man, 
with rather a thin face, light-brown hair, and a mild 
blue eye, with an air of gentleness and dignity. 

Among the first that entered were the members of 
the family, the Duke and Duchess of Argyll, Lord and 
Lady Blantyre, the Marquis and Marchioness of Stafford, and Lady Emma Campbell. Then followed Lord 
Shaftesbury with his beautiful lady, and her father and 
mother, Lord and Lady Palmerston. Lord Palmerston 
is of middle height, with a keen dark eye and black 
hair streaked Avith gray. There is something peculiarly 
alert and vivacious about all his movements ; in short, 
his appearance perfectly answers to what we know of 
him from his public life. One has a strange, mythological feeling about the existence of people of whom 
one hears for many years without ever seeing them. 
While talking- with Lord Palmerston I could but remember how often I had heard father and Mr. S. exult


STAFFORD HOUSE. 233 

ing over his foreign dispatches by our own fireside. 
There were present, also, Lord John Russell, Mr. Gladstone, and Lord Granville. The latter we all thought 
very strikingly resembled in his appearance the poet 
Longfellow. 

After lunch the whole party ascended to the picturegallery, passing on our way the grand staircase and 
hall, said to be the most magnificent in Europe. The 
company now began to assemble and throng the gallery, 
and very soon the vast room was crowded. Among 
the throng I remember many presentations, but of 
course must have forgotten many more. Archbishop 
Whateley was there, with Mrs. and Miss Whateley ; 
Macaulay, with two of his sisters ; Milman, the poet 
and historian ; the Bishop of Oxford, Chevalier Bunsen 
and lady, and many more. 

When all the company were together, Lord Shaftesbury read a very short, kind, and considerate address 
in behalf of the ladies of England, expressive of their 
cordial welcome. 

This Stafford House meeting, in any view of it, is a 
most remarkable fact. Kind and gratifying as its 
arrangements have been to me, I am far from appropriating it to myself individually as a personal honor. 
I rather regard it as the most public expression possible 
of the feelinofs of the women of Enjjland on one of 
the most important questions of our day, that of individual liberty considered in its religious bearings.

Continuing her interesting journal, Mrs. Stowe writes, 

May 9th : — 

Dear E., — This letter I consecrate to you, because I 
know that the persons and things to be introduced into 
it will most particularly be appreciated by you. 

In your evening reading circles, Macaulay, Sydney 
Smith, and Milman have long been such famihar names 
that you will be glad to go with me over all the scenes 
of my morning breakfast at Sir Charles Trevelyan's 
yesterday. Lady Trevelyan, I believe I have said before, is a sister of Macaulay. 

We were set down at Westbourne Terrace somewhere, I believe, about eleven o'clock, and found quite 
a niunber already in the drawing-room. I had met 
Macaulay before, but being seated between him and 
Dean Milman, I must confess I was a little embarrassed 
at times, because I wanted to hear what they were both 
saying at the same time. However, by the use of the 
faculty by which you play a piano with both hands, I 
got on very comfortably. 

There were several other persons of note present at 
this breakfast, whose conversation I had not an opportunity of hearing, as they sat at a distance from me. 
There was Lord Glenelg, brother of Sir Robert Grant, governor of Bombay, whose beautiful hymns have rendered him famihar in America. The favorite one, commencing 

<q>When gathering clouds around I view</q>,

was from his pen. 

The historian Hallam was also present, and I think 
it very Hkely there may have been other celebrities 
whom I did not know. I am always finding out, a day 
or two after, that I have been ^\dth somebody very 
remarkable and did not know it at the time.

Under date of May 18th she writes to her sister 
Mary : — 

Dear M., — I can compare the embarrassment of 
our London life, with its multipHed solicitations and 
infinite stimulants to curiosity and desire, only to that 
annual perplexity which used to beset us in our childhood on Thanksgiving Day. Like Miss Edgeworth's 
philosophic httle Frank, we are obliged to make out a 
Hst of what man must want, and of what he 'may want ; 
and in our list of the former we set down, in large and 
decisive characters, one quiet day for the exploration 
and enjoyment of Windsor. 

The ride was done all too soon. About eleven 
o clock we found ourselves going up the old stone steps 
to the castle. We went first through the state apartments. The principal thing that interested me was the 
ball-room, which was a perfect gallery of Vandyke's 
paintings. After leaving the ball-room we filed off to 
the proper quarter to show our orders for the private 
rooms. The state apartments, which we had been looking at, are open at all times, but the private apartments 
can only be seen in the Queen's absence and by a special 
permission, which had been procured for us on that 
occasion by the kindness of the Duchess of Sutherland. 

One of the first objects that attracted my attention 
upon entering the vestibule was a baby's wicker wagon, 
standing in one corner. It was much such a carriage 
as all mothers are famiHar with ; such as figures largely 
in the history of almost every family. It had neat cui-tains and cushions of green merino, and was not royal, 
only maternal. I mused over the Httle thing with a 
good deal of interest. 

We went for our dinner to the White Hart, the very 
inn which Shakespeare celebrates in his " Merry Wives," 
and had a most overflowing merry time of it. After 
dinner we had a beautiful drive. 

We were bent upon looking up the church which 
gave rise to Gray's " Elegy in a Country Churchyard," 
intending when we got there to have a little scene over 
it ; Mr. S., in all the conscious importance of having 
been there before, assuring us that he knew exactly 
where it was. So, after some difficulty with our coachman, and being stopped at one church which would not 
answer our purpose in any respect, we were at last set 
down by one which looked authentic ; embowered in 
mossy elms, with a most ancient and goblin yew-tree, 
an ivy-mantled tower, all perfect as could be. Here, 
leaning on the old fence, we repeated the Elegy, which 
certainly applies here as beautifully as language could 
apply. 

Imagine our chagrin, on returning to London, at 
being informed that we had not been to the genuine churchyard after all. The gentleman who wept over 
the scenes of his early days on the WTong doorstep:) was 
not more grievously disappointed. However, he and 
we could both console om-selves with the reflection that 
the emotion was admirable, and wanted only the right 
place to make it the most appropriate in the world. 

The evenino" after our retiu-n from Windsor was 
spent with our kind friends, Mr. and Mrs. Gurney. 
After breakfast the next day, Mr. S., C, and I drove 
out to call upon Kossuth. We found him in an obscure lodoing; on the outskirts of London. I would 
that some of the editors in America, who have thrown 
out insinuations about his Hving in luxury, could have 
seen the utter bareness and plainness of the reception 
room, which had nothing in it beyond the simplest 
necessaries. He entered into conversation with us with 
cheerfulness, speaking EngHsh well, though with the 
idioms of foreign languages. When we parted he took 
my hand kindly and said, " God bless you, my child ! " 

I have been quite amused with something Avhich has 
happened lately. This week the " Times " has informed the United Kingdom that Mrs. Stowe is getting 
a new cbess made ! It wants to know if Mrs. Stowe is 
aware what sort of a place her dress is being made in ; 
and there is a letter from a dressmaker's apprentice 
stating that it is being made up piecemeal, in the most 
shockingly distressed dens of London, by poor, miserable white slaves, worse treated than the plantation 
slaves of America ! 

Now Mrs. Stowe did not know anvthino^ of this, but 
simply gave the silk into the hands of a friend, and 
was in due time waited on in her own apartment by a very respectable-appearing woman, who offered to make 
the di'ess, and lo, this is the result ! Since the publication of this piece, I have received earnest missives, from 
various parts of the country, begging me to interfere, 
hoping that I was not going to patronize the white 
slavery of England, and that I would employ my talents 
equally against oppression in every form. Could these 
people only know in what sweet simplicity I had been 
living in the State of Maine, where the only dressmaker 
of our cu'cle was an intelligent, refined, well-educated 
woman who was considered as the* equal^f us all, and 
whose spring and fall ministrations to our wardrobe 
were regarded a double pleasure, — a friendly visit as 
well as a domestic assistance, — I say, could they know 
all this, they would see how guiltless I was in the matter. I verily never thought but that the nice, pleasant 
person who came to measure me for my silk dress was 
going to take it home and make it herself ; it never 
occurred to me that she was the head of an estabhshment.

In addition to these letters the following extracts 
from a subsequent letter to Mr. Garrison are given to 
show in what respect their fields of labor differed, and 
to present an idea of what Mrs. Stowe was doing for 
the cause of freedom besides writing against slavery : — 


Andover, Mass., February 18, 1854. 

Dear Friend, — I see and sincerely rejoice in the 
result of your lecture in New York. I am increasingly 
anxious tliat all who hate slavery be united, if not in 
form, at least in fact, — a unity in difference. Our 
field lies in the church, and as yet I differ from you as 
to what may be done and hoped there. Brother Edward (Beecher) has written a sermon that goes to the 
very root of the decline of moral feeling in the church. 
As soon as it can be got ready for the press I shall 
have it printed, and shall send a copy to every minister 
in the country. 

Our lectures have been somewhat embarrassed by a 
pressure of new business brought upon us by the 
urgency of the Kansas-Nebraska question. Since we 
be&lt;»an, however, brother Edward has devoted his whole 
time to visiting, consultation, and efforts the result of 
which will shortly be given to the public. We are trying to secure a universal arousing of the pulpit. 

Dr. Bacon's letter is noble. You must think so. It 
has been sent to every member of Congress. Dr. 
Ku-k's sermon is an advance, and his congregation 
warmly seconded it. Now, my good friend, be willing 
to see that the church is better than you have thought 
it. Be not unwilling to see some good symptoms, andhope that even those who see not at all at first will 
gain as they go on. I am acting on the conviction 
that you love the cause better than self. If anything 
can be done now advantageously by the aid of money, 
let me know. God has given me some power in this 
way, though I am too feeble to do much otherwise. 
Y^ours for the cause, H. B. Stowe.

Of this new story Charles Summer wrote from the 
senate chamber : — 

My dear Mrs. Stowe, — I am rejoiced to learn, 
from your excellent sister here, that you are occupied 
with another tale exposing slavery. I feel that it will 
act directly upon pending questions, and help us in our 
struggle for Kansas, and also to overthrow the slaveoligarchy in the coming Presidential election. AVe 
need your help at once in our struggle. 

Ever sincerely yours, Charles Sumner.

Just before saiHng she received the following touching letter from her life-long friend, Georgiana May. 
It is the last one of a series that extended without 
interruption over a period of thirty years, and as such 
has been carefully cherished : — 

Ocean House, Groton Point, July 26, 1856. 

Dear Hattie, — Very likely it is too late for me to 
come with my modest knock to your study door, and 
ask to be taken in for a moment, but I do so want to 
hless you before you go, and I have not been well 
enough to write until to-day. It seems just as if I could not let you go till I have seen once more your 
face in the flesh, for great uncertainties hang over my 
future. One thing, however, is certain : whichever of 
us two srets first to the farther shore of the o-reat ocean 
between us and the unseen will be pxetty sure to be at 
hand to welcome the other. It is not poetry, but solemn verity between us that we shall meet again. 

But there is nothing morbid or morhijic going into 
these few lines. I have made "Old Tiff's" accjuaintance.' He is a verity, — will stand up with Uncle Tom 
and Topsy, pieces of negro property you wdll be guilty 
of holding after you are dead. Very likely your children may be selling them. 

Hattie, I rejoice over this completed work. Another 
work for God and your generation. I am glad that 
you have come out of it alive, that you have pleasure 
in prospect, that you " w^alk at liberty " and have done 
with '' fits of languishing." Perhaps some day I shall 
be set fi-ee, but the prospect does not look promising, 
except as I have full faith that " the Good Man above 
is looking on, and will bring it all round right." Still 
" heart and flesh " both " fail me." He will be the 
" strength of my heart," and I never seem to doubt 
" my portion forever." 

If I never speak to you again, this is the farewell 
utterance. Yours truly, 

Georgiana.

Inverary Castle, September 6, 1856. 

My dear Husband, — We have been now a week 
in this delicious place, enjoying the finest skies and 
scenery, the utmost of kind hospitality. From Loch 
Goil we took the coach for Inverary, a beautiful drive of about two hours. We had seats on the outside, and 
the driver John, hke some of the White Mountain guides, 
was full of song and story, and local tradition. He 
spoke Scotch and Gaelic, recited ballads, and simg songs 
with great gusto. Mary and the girls stopped in a little 
inn at St. Catherine's, on the shores of Loch Fine, while 
Henry and I took steamboat for Inverary, where we 
found the duchess waiting in a carriage for us, with 
Lady Emma Campbell. . . . 

The common routine of the day here is as follows : 
We rise about half past eight. About haK past nine 
we all meet m the dining-hall, where the servants are 
standing in a Hne down one side, and a row of chairs 
for guests and visitors occupies the other. The duchess 
with her nine children, a perfectly beautiful little flock, 
sit together. The duke reads the Bible and a prayer, 
and pronounces the benediction. After that, breakfast 
is served, — a very hearty, informal, cheerful meal, — 
and after that come walks, or drives, or fishing parties, 
till lunch time, and then more drives, or anything else : 
everybody, in short, doing what he likes till half past 
seven, which is the dinner hour. After that we have 
coffee and tea in the evening. 

The first morning, the duke took me to see his mine 
of nickel silver. We had a long and beautiful drive, 
and talked about everything in Hterature, religion, 
morals, and the temperance movement, about which last 
he is in some state of doubt and uncertainty, not incHning, I think, to have it pressed yet, though feeling 
there is need of doing something. 

If " Dred " has as good a sale in America as it is 
likely to have in England, we shall do well. There is such a demand that they had to placard the shop windows in Glasgow with, — 

" To prevent disappointment, 

« Dred ' 

Not to be had till," etc. 

Everybody is after it, and the prospect is of an enormous sale. 

God, to whom I prayed night and day while I w^as 
writing the book, has heard me, and given us of worldly 
goods more than I asked. I feel, therefore, a desire to 
" walk softly," and inquire, for what has He so trusted 
us ? 

Every day I am more charmed with the duke and 
duchess ; they are simple-hearted, frank, natural, full 
of feeling, of piety, and good sense. They certainly 
are, apart from any considerations of rank or position, 
most interesting and noble people. The duke laughed 
heartily at many things I told him of our Andover 
theological tactics, of your preaching, etc. ; but I think 
he is a sincere, earnest Christian. 

Our American poHtics form the daily topic of interest. The late movements in Congress are discussed 
witli great warmth, and every morning the papers are 
watched for new details. 

I must stop now, as it is late and we are to leave 
here early to-morrow morning. We are going to Staffa, 
lona, the Pass of Glencoe, and finally througli the Caledonian Canal up to Dun robin Castle, wdiere a large 
party of all sorts of interesting people are gathered 
around the Duchess of Sutherland. 

Affectionately yours, Harriet.

DuxROBiN Castle, September 15, 1856. 

My dear Husband, — Everything here is like a 
fairy story. The place is beautiful ! It is the most 
perfect combination of architectural and poetic romance, 
with home comfort. The people, too, are charming. A¥e 
have here Mr. Labouchere, a cabinet minister, and Lady 
Mary his wdfe, — I like him very much, and her, too, — 
Kingsley's brother, a very entertaining man, and tomorrow Lord Ellsmere is expected. I wish you could 
be here, for I am sure you would hke it. Life is so 
quiet and sincere and friendly, that you would feel more 
as if you had come at the hearts of these people than 
in London. 

The Sutherland estate looks like a garden. We 
stopped at the town of Frain, four miles before we reached Sutlierlandsliire, where a crowd o£ well-to-do, 
nice-looking people gathered around the carriage, and 
as we drove off gave three cheers. This was better 
than I expected, and looks well for their opinion of my 
views. 

" Dred " is selling over here wonderfully. Low says, 
with all the means at his command, he has not been able 
to meet the demand. He sold fifty thousand in two 
weeks, and probably will sell as many more. 

I am showered with letters, private and printed, in 
which the only difficulty is to know what the writers 
would be at. I see evidently happiness and pros23erity 
all through the line of this estate. I see the duke 
giving his thought and time, and spending the whole 
income of this estate in improvements upon it. I see 
the duke and duchess evidently beloved wherever they 
move. I see them most amiable, most Christian, most 
considerate to evei-ybody. The writers of the letters 
admit the goodness of the duke, but denounce the system, and beg me to observe its effects for myself. I do 
observe that, compared with any other part of the Highlands, Sutherland is a garden. I observe well-clothed 
people, thriving lands, healthy children, fine schoolhouses, and all that. 

Henry was invited to the tenants' dinner, where he 
excited much amusement by pledging every toast in 
fair water, as he has done invariably on all occasions 
since he has been here. 

The duchess, last night, showed me her coj3y of 
" Dred," in which she has marked what most struck or 
pleased her. I begged it, and am going to send it to 
you. She said to me this morning at breakfast, " The Queen says that she began ' Died ' the very minute she got it, and is deeply interested in it." 

She bought a copy of Lowell's poems, and begged 
me to mark the best ones for her ; so if you see him, 
tell him that we have been readino; him toc^ether. She 
is, taking her all in all, one of the noblest-appointed 
women I ever saw ; real old, genuine English, such as 
one reads of in history ; full of nobility, courage, tenderness, and zeal. It does me good to hear her read 
prayers daily, as she does, in the midst of her servants 
and guests, with a manner full of grand and noble feel
Thursday Morning, Sej^temher 25. We were 
obliged to get up at half past five the morning we 
left Dunrobin, an effort when one does n't go to bed 
till one o'clock. We found breakfast laid for us in the 
library, and before we had quite finished the duchess 
came in. Our starting off was quite an imposing sight. 
First came the duke's landau, in which were Marv, the 
duke, and myself ; then a carriage in which were Eliza 
and Hatty, and finally the carriage which we had hired, 
with Henry, our baggage, and Mr. Jackson (the duke's 
secretary). The gardener sent a fresh bou(piet for 
each of us, and there was such a leave-taking, as if we 
were old and dear friends. We did really love them, and 
had no doubt of their love for us. 

The duke rode with us as far as Dornach, where he 
showed us the cathedral beneath which his ancestors 
are buried, and where is a statue of his father, similar 
to one the tenants have erected on top of the highest 
hill in the neioliborhood. 

We also saw the prison, which had but two inmates, and the old castle.. Here the duke took leave o£ us, 
and taking our own carriage we crossed the ferry and 
continued on our way. After a very bad night's rest 
at Inverness, in consequence of the town's being so full 
of people attending some Highland games that we 
could have no places at the hotel, and after a weary 
ride in the rain, we came into Aberdeen Friday night. 

To-morrow we go on to Edinburgh, where I hope to 
meet a letter from you. The last I heard from Low, 
he had sold sixty thousand of " Dred," and it was still 
selHng well. I have not yet heard from America how 
it goes. The critics scold, and whiffle, and dispute 
about it, but on the whole it is a success, so the 
" Times " says, with much coughing, hemming, and 
standing first on one foot and then on the other. If 
the " Times " were sure we should beat in the next 
election, " Dred " would go up in the scale ; but as long 
as there is that uncertainty, it has first one line of 
praise, and then one of blame.

City of York, October 10, 1856. 

Dear Husband, — Henry will tell you all about our 
journey, and at present I have but little time for details. I received your first letter with great joy, relief, 
and gratitude, first to God for restoring your health 
and strength, and then to you for so good, long, and 
refreshing a letter. 

Henry, I hope, comes home with a serious determination to do well and be a comfort. . Seldom has a young 
man seen what he has in this journey, or made more valuable friends. 

Since we left Aberdeen, from which place my last 
was mailed, we have visited in Edinburgh with abounding dehght ; thence yesterday to Newcastle. Last 
night attended service in Durham Cathedral, and after 
that came to York, whence we send Henry to Liverpool. 

I send you letters, etc., by him. One hundred thousand copies of "Dred" sold in four weeks ! After that 
who cares what critics say? Its success in England 
has been complete, so far as sale is concerned. It is 
very bitterly attacked, both from a literary and a religious point of view. The " Record " is down upon it 
with a cartload of solemnity ; the " Athenaeum " with 
waspish spite ; the " Edinburgh " goes out of its way 
to say that the author knows nothing of the society she 
describes ; but yet it goes everywhere, is read everywhere, and Mr. Low says that he puts the hundred and 
twenty-fifth thousand to press confidently. The fact 
that so many good judges like it better than " Uncle 
Tom " is success enough. 

In my journal to Henry, which you may look for 
next week, you will learn how I have been very near 
the Queen, and formed acquaintance with divers of 
her lords and ladies, and heard all she has said about 
" Dred ; " how she prefers it to " Uncle Tom," how she 
inquired for you, and other matters. 

Till then, I am, as ever, your affectionate wife, 

H. B. Stowe.

Oxford House, October 15, 1856. 

Dear Mrs. Stowe, — The newspapers represent 
you as returning to London, but I cannot wait for the 
chance, slender I fear, of seeing you there, for I wish 
to consult you on a point admitting but of little delay. 
Feeling that the sufferers in Kansas have a claim not 
only to sympathy, but to the expression of it, I wish to 
send them a donation. It is, however, necessary to 
know what is the best a])plication of money and what 
the safest channel. Presuming that you will approve 
the object, I ask you to tell me. Perhaps you would 
undertake the transmission of my £50. My present 
residence, two miles beyond Richmond, is opposite. I 
have watched for instructions of your course with warm interest. The sale of your book will go on increasing. 
Tt is beo'inuinor- to be understood. 

Believe me, with kind regards to your daughters, 
Youi' faithful and affectionate 

A. T. Noel Bykon.

Grove Terrace, Kentish Town, October 16, 1856. 

Dear Lady Byron, — How glad I was to see your 
handwriting once more ! how more than glad I should 
be to see you ! I do long to see you. I have so much 
to say, — so much to ask, and need to be refreshed with 
a sense of a congenial and sympathetic soul. 

Thank you, my dear friend, for your sympathy with 
our poor sufferers in Kansas. May God bless you for 
it ! By doing this you will step to my side ; perhaps 
you may share something of that abuse which they 
who " know not what they do " heap upon all who so 
feel for the right. I asssure you, dear friend, I am 
not insensible to the fiery darts which thus fly around 
me. . . . 

Direct as usual to my publishers, and believe me, as ever, with all my heart, 

Affectionately yours, H. B. S.

Paris, November 7, 1856. 

My dear Husband, — On the 28th, when your last 
was written, I was at Charles Kingsley's. It seemed 
odd enough to Mary and me to find ourselves, long 
after dark, alone in a hack, driving towards the house 
of a man whom we never had seen (nor his wife either). 

My heart fluttered as, after rumbling a long way through the dark, we tiu'iied into a yard. We knocked 
at a door and were met in the hall by a man who stammers a little in his speech, and whose inquiry, " Is 
this Mrs. Stowe?" was our first positive introduction. 
Ushered into a large, pleasant parlor lighted by a coal 
fire, which flickered on comfortable chairs, lounges, 
pictures, statuettes, and book-cases, we took a good view 
of him. He is tall, slender, with blue eyes, brown hair, 
and a hale, well - browned face, and somewhat loosejointed withal. His wife is a real Spanish beauty. 

How we did talk and go on for three days ! I guess 
he is tired. I 'm sure we were. He is a nervous, excitable being, and talks Avith head, shoulders, arms, and 
hands, while his hesitance makes it the harder. Of his 
theology I will say more some other time. He, also, 
has been through the great distress, the " Conflict of 
Affes," but has come out at a different end from Edward, and stands with John Foster, though with more 
positiveness than he. 

He laughed a good deal at many stories I told him 
of father, and seemed delighted to hear about him. 
But he is, what 1 did not expect, a zealous Churchman ; 
insists that the Church of England is the finest and 
broadest platform a man can stand on, and that the 
thirty-nine articles are the only ones he could subscribe 
to. I told him you thought them the best sunmiary 
(of doctrine) you knew, which pleased him greatly. 

AVell, I got your letter to-night in Paris, at No. 19 
Rue de Clichy, where you may as well direct your 
future letters. 

We reached Paris about eleven o'clock last night 
and took a carriage for 17 Rue de Clichy, but when we got there, no ring-iiig or pounding could rouse anybody. Finally, in despair, we remembered a card that 
had been handed into the cars by some hotel-runner, 
and finding it was of an EngHsh and French hotel, we 
drove there, and secured very comfortable accommodations. We did not get to bed until after two o'clock. 
The next morning I sent a messenger to find Mme. 
Borione, and discovered that we had mistaken the number, and should have gone to No. 19, which was the 
next door ; so we took a carriage and soon found ourselves established here, where we have a nice j)arlor 
and two bedrooms. 

There are twenty-one in the family, mostly Americans, like ourselves, come to learn to speak French. 
One of them is a tall, handsome, young English lady. 
Miss Durant, who is a sculptress, studying with Baron 
de Triqueti. She took me to his studio, and he immediately remarked that she ought to get me to sit. I 
said I would, " only my French lessons." " Oh," said 
he, smiling, " we will give you French lessons while 
you sit." So I go to-morrow morning. 

As usual, my horrid pictures do me a service, and 
people seem relieved when they see me ; think me even 
handsome " in a manner." Kingsley, in his reUef, expressed as much to his wife, and as beauty has never 
been one of my strong points I am open to flattery 
upon it. 

We had a most agreeable call from Arthur Helps 
before we left London. He, Kingsley, and all the 
good people are full of the deepest anxiety for our 
American affairs. They really do feel very deeply, 
seeing the peril so much plainer than we do in America. 

Sunday nicjlit. I fear I have delayed your letter too 
long. The fact is, that of the ten days I have been 
here I have been laid up three with severe neuralg-ia, 
viz., toothache in the backbone, and since then have 
sat all day to be modeled for my bust. 

We spent the other evening with Baron de Tri(jueti, 
the sculptor. He has an English wife, and a charming 
dauo'hter about the ao-e of our girls. Life in Paris is 
altogether more simple and natural than in England. 
They give you a plate of cake and a cup of tea in the 
most informal, social Avay, — the tea-kettle sings at the 
fire, and the son and daughter busy themselves gayly 
together making and handing tea. When tea was over, 
M. de Triqueti showed us a manuscri^jt copy of the Gospels, written by his mother, to console herself in a season 
of great ill-health, and which he had illustrated all along 
with exquisite pen-drawings, resembling the most perfect line engravings. I can't describe the beauty, grace, 
dehcacy, and fullness of devotional feeling in these 
people. He is one of the loveliest men I ever saw. 

We have already three evenings in the week in wdiich 
we can visit and meet friends if we choose, namely, at 
Madame Mohl's, Madame Lanziel's, and Madame Belloc's. All these salons are informal, social gatherings, 
with no fuss of refreshments, no nonsense of any kind. 
Just the cheeriest, heartiest, kindest little receptions you 
ever saw. 

A kiss to dear little Charley. K he could see all the 
things that I see every day in the Tuileries and Champs 
Elysees, he would go wild. All Paris is a general 
whirligig out of doors, but indoors people seem steady, 
quiet, and sober as anybody. 

JVovemher 30. This is Sunday evening-, and a Sunday in Paris always puts me in mind of your story 
about somebody who said, " Bless you ! they make such 
a noise that the Devil could n't meditate." All the extra 
work and odd jobs of life are put into Sunday. Your 
washerwoman comes Sunday, with her innocent, goodhumored face, and would be infinitely at a loss to know 
why she should n't. Your bonnet, cloak, shoes, and 
everything are sent home Sunday morning, and all the 
way to church there is such whirligiging and pirouetting 
along the boulevards as almost takes one's breath away. 
Today we went to the Oratoire to hear M. Grand Pierre. 
I could not understand much ; my French ear is not 
quick enough to follow. I could only perceive that the 
subject was " La Charite," and that the speaker was 
fluent, graceful, and earnest, the audience serious and attentive. 

Last night we were at Baron de Triqueti's again, 
with a party invited to celebrate the birthday of their 
eldest daughter, Blanche, a lovely girl of nineteen. 
There were some good ladies there who had come 
eighty leagues to meet me, and who were so dehghted 
with my miserable French that it was quite encouraging. 
I believe I am getting over the sandbar at last, and conversation is beginning to come easy to me. 

There were three French gentlemen who had just 
been reading " Dred " in English, and who were as excited and full of it as could be, and I talked with them 
to a degree that astonished myself. There is a review 
of " Dred " in the " Revue des Deux Mondes " which 
has long extracts from the book, and is written in a 
very appreciative and favorable spirit. Generally speaking, French critics seem to have a finer appreciation of 
my subtle shades of meaning than English. I am curious to hear what Professor Park has to say about it. 
There has been another review in " La Presse " equally 
favorable. All seem to see the truth about American 
slavery much plainer than people can who are in it. If 
American ministers and Christians could see through 
their sophistical spider-webs, with what wonder, pity, 
and contempt they would regard their own vacillating 
condition ! 

We visit once a week at Madame Mohl's, where we 
meet all sorts of agreeable people. Lady Elgin does n't 
go into society now, having been struck with paralysis, 
but sits at home and receives her friends as usual. This 
notion of sitting always in the open air is one of her 
peculiarities. 

I must say, life in Paris is arranged more sensibly 
than with us. Visiting involves no trouble in the feeding line. People don't go to eat. A cup of tea and 
plate of biscuit is all, — just enough to break up the 
stiffness. 

It is wonderful that the people here do not seem to 
have got over " Uncle Tom " a bit. The impression 
seems fresh as if just published. How often have they 
said. That book has revived the Gospel among the 
poor of France ; it has done more than all the books 
we have published put together. It has gone among 
the les ouvriers, among the poor of Faubourg St. 
Antoine, and nobody knows how many have been led 
to Christ by it. Is not this blessed, my dear husband ? 
Is it not worth all the suffering of writing it ? 

I went the other evening to M. Grand Pierre's, where there were tliree rooms full of people, all as eager and 
loving as ever we met in England or Scotland. Oh, if 
Christians in Boston could only see the earnestness of 
feeling with which Christians here regard slavery, and 
their surprise and horror at the lukewarmness, to say 
the least, of our American church ! About eleven 
o'clock we all joined in singing a hymn, then M. Grand 
Pierre made an address, in which I was named in the 
most affectionate and cordial manner. Then followed 
a beautiful prayer for our country, for America, on 
which hang so many of the hopes of Protestantism. 
One and all then came up, and there was great shaking 
of hands and much effusion. 

Under date of December 28, Mrs. Perkins writes : 
" On Sunday we went with Mr. and Mrs. (Jacob) Abbott 
to the Hotel des Invalides, and I think I was never 
more interested and affected. Three or four thousand 
old and disabled soldiers have here a beautiful and comfortable home. We went to the mornino- service. The 
church is very large, and the colors taken in battle are 
huno;- on the walls. Some of them are so old as to be 
moth-eaten. The service is performed, as near as possible, in imitation of the service before a battle. The 
drum beats the call to assemble, and the common soldiers march up and station themselves in the centre of 
the church, under the commander. All the services are 
regulated by the beat of the drum. Only one priest 
officiates, and soldiers are stationed around to protect 
him. The music is from a brass band, and is very magnificent. 

" In the afternoon I went to vespers in the Madeleine, where the music was exquisite. They have two fine 
organs at opposite ends of the church. The ' Acleste 
Fidelis ' was sung by a single voice, accompanied by 
the organ, and after every verse it was taken up by male 
voices and the other organ and repeated. The effect 
was wonderfully fine. I have always found in our 
small churches at home that the organ was too powerful and pained my head, but in these large cathedrals 
the effect is different. The volume of sound rolls over, 
full but soft, and I feel as though it must come from 
another sphere. 

" In the evening Mr. and Mrs. Bunsen called. He is 
a son of Chevalier Bunsen, and she a niece of Ehzabeth 
Fry, — very intelligent and agreeable people." 

Under date of January 25, Mrs. Stowe writes from 
Paris : — 

" Here is a story for Charley. The boys in the Faubourg St. Antoine are the children of ouvriers, and 
every day their mothers give them two sous to buy a 
dinner. When they heard I was coming to the school, 
of their own accord they subscribed haK their dinner 
money to give to me for the poor slaves. This fivefranc piece I have now ; I have bought it of the cause 
for five dollars, and am going to make a hole in it and 
hang it round Charley's neck as a medal. 

" I have just completed arrangements for leaving 
the girls at a Protestant boarding-school while I go to 
Rome. 

" We expect to start the 1st of February, and my direction will be, E. Barthohmeu, 108 Via Margaretta."

March 1. 

My dear Husband, — Every day is opening to me 
a new world of wonders here in Italy. I have been in 
the Catacombs, where I was shown many memorials of 
the primitive Christians, and to-day we are going to the 
Vatican. The weather is sunny and beautiful beyond 
measure, and flowers are springing in the fields on 
every side. Oh, my dear, how I do long to have you 
here to enjoy what you are so much better fitted to appreciate than I, — this wonderful combination of the 
past and the present, of what has been and what is ! 

Think of strolling leisurely through the Forum, of 
seeing the very stones that were laid in the time of the 
Republic, of rambling over the ruined Palace of the 
Csesars, of walking under the Arch of Titus, of seeing 
the Dying Gladiator, and whole ranges of rooms filled 
with wonders of art, all in one morning ! All this I 
did on Saturday, and only wanted you. You know so 
much more and could appreciate so much better. At 
the Palace of the Caesars, where the very dust is a 
melmuje of exquisite marbles, I saw for the first time 
an acanthus growing, and picked my first leaf. 

Our little menage moves on prosperously ; the doctor 
takes excellent care of us and we of him. One sees 
everybody here at Rome, John Bright, Mrs. Hemans' 
son, Mrs. Gaskell, etc., etc. Over five thousand English 
travelers are said to be here. Jacob Abbot and wife are 
commg. Rome is a world ! Rome is an astonishment ! 
Papal Rome is an enchantress ! Old as she is, she is 
Hke Ninon d'Enclos, — the young- fall in love with her. 
You will hear next from us at Naples. 

Affectionately yours, H. B. S.

Having established her daughters in a Protestant 
boarding-school in Paris, Mrs. Stowe proceeded to London. While there she received the followinsf letter 
from Harriet Martineau : — 

Amhleside, June 1. 

Dear Mrs. Stowe, — I have been at my wits' end 
to learn how to reach you, as your note bore no direction but " London." Arnolds, Croppers, and others could give no light, and the newspapers tell only where 
you had been. So I commit this to your publishers, 
trusting that it will find you somewhere, and in time, 
perhaps, bring you here. Cant you come ? You are 
aware that we shall never meet if you don't come soon. 
I see no strangers at all, but I hope to have breath and 
strength enough for a little talk with you, if you could 
come. You could have perfect freedom at the times 
when I am laid up, and we could seize my " capability 
seasons " for our talk. 

The weather and scenery are usually splendid just 
now. Did I see you (in white frock and black silk 
apron) when I was in Ohio in 1835 ? Your sister I 
knew well, and I have a clear recollection of your 
father. I believe and hope you were the young lady in 
the black silk apron. 

Do you know I rather dreaded reading your book ! 
Sick people are weak : and one of my chief weaknesses 
is dislike of novels, — (except some old ones which I 
almost know by heart). I knew that with you I should 
be safe from the cobweb-spinning of our modern subjective novelists and the jaunty vulgarity of our " funny 
philosophers" — the Dickens sort, who have tired us 
out. But I dreaded the alternative, — the too strong 
interest. But oh ! the delight I have had in " Dred ! " 
The genius carries all before it, and drowns everything 
in glorious pleasure. So marked a work of genius 
claims exemption from every sort of comparison ; but, 
as you ask for my opinion of the hook, you may like 
to know that I think it far superior to " Uncle Tom." 
I have no doubt that a multitude of people will say it 
is a faUing off, because they made up their minds that any new book of yours must be inferior to tbat, and 
because it is so rare a thing for a prodigious fame to 
be sustained by a second book ; but, in my own mind 
I am entirely convinced that the second book is by far 
the best. Such faults as you have are in the artistic 
department, and there is less defect in " Dred " than in 
" Uncle Tom," and the whole material and treatment 
seem to me richer and more substantial. I have had 
critiques of " Dred " from the two very wisest people I 
know — perfectly unhke each other (the critics, I mean), 
and they delight me by thinking exactly like each other 
and like me. They distinctly prefer it to " Uncle Tom." 
To say the plain truth, it seems to me so splendid 
a work of genius that nothing that I can say can give 
you an idea of the intensity of admiration with which 
I read it. It seemed to me, as I told my nieces, that 
our English fiction writers had better shut up altogether and have done with it, for one will have no patience with any but didactic writing after yours. My 
nieces (and you may have heard that Maria, my nurse, 
is very, very clever) are thoroughly possessed with the 
book, and Maria says she feels as if a fresh department 
of human life had been opened to her since this day 
week. I feel the freshness no less, while, from my 
travels, I can be even more assured of the truthfulness 
of your wonderful representation. I see no limit to the 
good it may do by suddenly splitting open Southern 
life, for everybody to look into. It is precisely the 
thing that is most wanted, — just as " Uncle Tom " was 
wantel, three years since, to show what negro slavery 
in your republic was like. It is })lantation-life, particularly in the present case, that I mean. As for your exposure o£ the weakness and helplessness ot the 
churches, I deeply honor you for the courage with 
which you have made the exposure ; but I don't suppose that any amendment is to be looked for in that 
direction. You have unburdened your own soul in 
that matter, and if they had been corrigible, you would 
have helped a good many more. But I don't expect 
that result. The Southern railing at you will be something unequaled, I suppose. I hear that three of us 
have the honor of being abused from day to day already, as most portentous and shocking women, you, 
Mrs. Chapman, and myself as (the traveler of twenty 
years ago). Not only newspapers, but pamplilets of 
such denunciation are circulated, I 'm told. I 'm afraid 
now I, and even Mrs. Chapman, must lose our fame, 
and all the railing will be engrossed by you. My little 
function is to keep English people tolerably right, by 
means of a London daily paper, while the danger of 
misinformation and misreading from the " Times " continues. I can't conceive how such a paper as the 
" Times " can fail to be better informed than it is. At 
times it seems as if its New York correspondent was 
makino" srame of it. The able and excellent editor of 
the " Daily News " gives me complete liberty on American subjects, and Mrs. Chapman's and other friends' 
constant supply of information enables me to use this 
liberty for making the cause better understood. I 
hope I shall hear that you are coming. It is hke a 
great impertinence — my having written so freely about 
your book : but you asked my opinion, — that is all I 
can say. Thank you much for sending the book to 
me. If you come you will write our names in it, and this will make it a valuable legacy to a nephew or 

niece. 

Believe me gratefully and affectionately yours, 

Harriet Martineau.

Pepperell, October 4, 1856. 

My dear Mrs. Stowe, — I am much obliged to you 
for the copy of " Dred " which Mr. Phillips put into 
my hands. It has furnished us our evening's amusement since Ave have been in the country, where we 
spend the brilhant month of October. 

The African race are much indebted to you for showing up the good sides of their characters, their cheerfulness, and especially their powers of humor, which are 
admirably set off by their peculiar patois, in the same 
manner as the expression of the Scottish sentiment is 
by the peculiar Scottish dialect. People differ ; but I 
was most struck among your characters with Uncle 
Tiff' and Nina. The former a variation of good old 
Uncle Tom, though conceived in a merrier vein than 
belonged to that sedate personage ; the difference of 
their tempers in this respect being well suited to the 
difference of the circumstances in which they were 
placed. But Nina, to my mind, is the true hero of the 
book, Avhich I sliould have named after her instead of 
" Dred." She is indeed a charming conception, full of 
what is called character, and what is masculine in he nature is toned down by such a delightful sweetness 
and kindness of disposition as makes her perfectly fascinating". I cannot forgive you for smothering her so 
prematurely. No dramatis personce could afford the 
loss of such a character. But I will not bore you with 
criticism, of which you have had quite enough. I must 
thank you, however, for giving Tom Gordon a guttapercha cane to perform his flagellations with. 

I congratulate you on the brilliant success of the 
work, unexampled even in this age of authorship ; and, 
as Mr. Phillips informs me, greater even in the old 
country than in ours. I am glad you are likely to settle the question and show that a Yankee writer can get 
a copyright in England — little thanks to our own government, which compels him to go there in order to 
get it. 

With sincere regard, believe me, dear Mrs. Stowe, 
Very truly yours, Wm. H. Prescott.

Her last letter written before sailing was to Lady 
Byron, and serves to show how warm an intimacy had, 
sprung up between them. It was as foUows : — 

June 5, 1857. 

Dear Friend, — I left you with a strange sort of 
yearning, throbbing feeling — you make me feel quite 
as I did years ago, a sort of girlishness quite odd for 
me. I have felt a strange longing to send you something. Don't smile when you see what it turns out to 
be. I have a weakness for your pretty Parian things ; 
it is one of my own home peculiarities to have strong 
passions for pretty tea-cups and other little matters 
for my own quiet meals, when, as often happens, I am 
too unwell to join the family. So I send you a cup 
made of primroses, a funny little pitcher, quite large 
enousfh for cream, and a little vase for violets and 
primroses — which will be lovely together — and when you use it think of me and that I love you more than I can say. 

I often think how strange it is that I should know 
you — you who were a sort of legend of my early days 
— that I should love you is only a natural result. You 
seem to me to stand on the confines of that land where 
the poor formalities which separate hearts here pass hke 
mist before the sun, and therefore it is that I feel the 
language of love must not startle you as strange or unfamiliar. You are so nearly there in spirit that I fear 
with every adieu that it may be the last ; yet did you 
pass within the veil I should not feel you lost. 

I have got past the time when I feel that my heavenly friends are lost by going there. I feel them 
nearer, rather than farther off. 

So good-by, dear, dear friend, and if you see morning in our Father's house before I do, carry my love to 
those that wait for me, and if I pass first, you will find 
me there, and we shall love each ot]iev forever. 

Ever yours, H. B. Stowe.

Dear Friend, — Before this reaches you you will 
have perhaps learned from other sources of the sad 
blow which has fallen upon us, — our darling, our g'ood, 
beautiful boy, snatched away in the moment of health 
and happiness. Alas ! could I know that when I parted 
from my Henry on English shores that I should never 
see him more ? I returned to my home, and, amid the 
jubilee of meeting the rest, was fain to be satisfied with 
only a letter from him, saying that his college examinations were coming on, and he must defer seeing me a 
week or two till they were over. I thought then of 
taking his younger brother and going up to visit him ; 
but the health of the latter seeming unfavorably affected by the seacoast air, I turned back with him to 
a water-cure establishment. Before I had been two 
weeks absent a fatal telegram hurried me home, and 
when I arrived there it was to find the house filled with 
his weeping classmates, who had just come bringing 
his remains. There he lay so calm, so placid, so peaceful, that I could not believe that he would not smile 
upon me, and that my voice which always had such 
power over him could not recall him. There had always been such a peculiar union, such a tenderness 
between us. I had had such power always to call up 
answering feelings to my own, that it seemed impossible 
that he could be silent and unmoved at my grief. But 
yet, dear friend, I am sensible that in this last sad scene 
I had an alleviation that was not granted to you. I 
recollect, in the mournful letter you wrote me about 
that time, you said that you mourned that you had 
never told your own dear one how much you loved him. 
That sentence touched me at the time. I laid it to 
heart, and from that time lost no occasion of expressing to my children those feelings that we too often defer 
to express to our dearest friends till it is forever too 
late. 

He did fully know how I loved him, and some of the 
last loving words he spoke were of me. The very day 
that he was taken from us, and when he was just rising 
from the table of his boarcllng'-house to gfo whence he 
never returned, some one noticed the seal ring, which 
you may remember to have seen on his finger, and said, 
How beautiful that ring- is ! Yes, he said, and best of 
all, it was my mother's gift to me. That ring, taken 
from the lifeless hand a few hours later, was sent to 
me. Singularly enough, it is broken right across the 
name from a fall a little time previous. . . . 

It is a great comfort to me, dear friend, that I took 
Henry with me to Dunrobin. I hesitated about keepin o; him so lone: from his studies, but still I thouoht a 
mind so observing and appreciative might learn from 
such a tour more than through books, and so it was. 
He returned from England full of high resolves and 
manly purposes. " I may not be what the world calls 
a Christian," he wrote, " but I will live such a life as a 
Christian ought to live, such a life as every true man 
ouMit to live." Henceforth he became remarkable for 
a strict order and energy, and a vigilant temperance and 
care of his bodily health, docility and deference to his 
parents and teachers, and perseverance in every duty. 
. . . Well, from the hard battle of this life he is excused, 
and the will is taken for the deed, and whatever comes 
his heart will not be pierced as mine is. But I am glad 
that I can connect him with all my choicest remembrances of the Old World. 

Dunrobin will always be dearer to me now, and I 
have felt towards you and the duke a turning of spirit, 
because I remember how kindly you always looked on 
and spoke to him. I knew then it was the angel of your 
lost one that stirred your hearts with tenderness when 
you looked on another so near his age. The plaid that 
the duke gave him, and which he valued as one of the 
chief of his boyish treasures, will hang in his room — 
for still we have a room that we call his. 

You will understand, you will feel, this sorrow with 
us as few can. My poor husband is much prostrated. 
I need not say more : you know what this must be to a 
father's heart. But still I repeat what I said when I 
saw you last. Our dead are ministering angels ; they 
teach us to love, they fill us with tenderness for all that 
can suffer. These weary hours when sorrow makes us 
for the time blind and deaf and dumb, have their 
promise. These hours come in answer to our prayers 
for nearness to God It is always our treasure that the 
lightning strikes. ... I have poured out my heart to 
you because you can understand. While I was visiting 
in Hanover, where Henry died, a poor, deaf old slave 
woman, who has still five children in bondage, came to 
comfort me. " Bear up, dear soul, she said ; you must 
bear it, for the Lord loves ye." She said further, 
" Sunday is a heavy day to me, 'cause I can't work, and 
can't hear preaching, and can't read, so I can't keep my 
mind off my poor children. Some on 'em the blessed 
Master 's got, and they 's safe ; but, oh, there are five 
that I don't know where they are." 

What are our mother sorrows to this ! I shall try 
to search out and redeem these children, though, from 
the ill success of efforts already made, I fear it will be 
hopeless. Every sorrow I have, every lesson on the 
sacredness of family love, makes me the more determined to resist to the last this dreadful evil that makes 
so many mothers so much deeper mourners than I ever 
can be. . . . 

Affectionately yours, H. B. Stowe.

Cambridge, Fehruary 4, 1859. 

My dear Mrs. Stowe, — I certainly did mean to 
write you about your story, but only to cry hravissima ! 
with the rest of the world. I intended no kind o£ 
criticism ; deeming- it wholly out of place, and in the 
nature of a wet-blanket, so long- as a story is unfinished. 
When I got the first number in MS., I said to JNIr. Phillips that I thought it would be the best thing you had 
done, and what followed has only confirmed my first 
judgment. From long habit, and from the tendency 
of my studies, I cannot help looking at things purely 
from an sesthetic point of view, and what I valued in 
" Uncle Tom " was the genius, and not the moral. 
That is saying a good deal, for I never use the word 
genius at haphazard, and always (perhaps, too) sparingly. I am going to be as frank as I ought to be 
with one whom I value so highly. What especially 
charmed me in the new story was, that you had taken 
your stand on New England ground. You are one of 
the few persons lucky enough to be born with eyes in 
your head, — that is, with something behind the eyes 
which makes them of value. To most people the seeing apparatus is as useless as the great telescope at the 
observatory is to me, — something to stare through with 
no intelligent result. Nothing could be better than 
the conception of your plot (so far as I divine it), and 
the painting-in of your figures. As for " theology," 
it is as much a part of daily life in New England as in 
Scotland, and all I should have to say about it is this : 
let it crop out when it naturally comes to the surface, 
only don't dig down to it. A moral aim is a fine thing, 
but in making a story an artist is a traitor who does not sacrifice everything to art. Remember the lesson 
that Christ gave us twice over. First, he preferred the 
useless Mary to the dish-washing Martha, and next, 
when that exemj)lary moralist and friend of humanity, 
Judas, objected to the sinful waste of the Magdalen's 
ointment, the great Teacher would rather it should be 
wasted in an act of simple beauty than utilized for the 
benefit of the poor. Cleoj)atra was an artist when she 
dissolved her biggest pearl to captivate her Antonypublic. May I, a critic by profession, say the whole 
truth to a woman of o-enius ? Yes ? And never be 
forgiven ? I shall try, and try to be forgiven, too. In 
the first place, pay no regard to the advice of anybody. 
In the second place, pay a great deal to mine ! A Kilkenny-cattish style of advice? Not at all. My advice is 
to follow your own instincts, — to stick to nature, and 
to avoid what people commonly call the " Ideal ; " for 
that, and beauty, and pathos, and success, all lie in the 
simply natural. We all preach it, from Wordsworth 
down, and we all, from Wordsworth down, don't practice it. Don't I feel it every day in this weary editorial 
mill of mine, that there are ten thousand people who 
can write " ideal " things for one who can see, and feel, 
and reproduce nature and character ? Ten thousand, 
did I say ? Nay, ten million. What made Shakespeare so great ? Nothing but eyes and — faith in 
them. The same is true of Thackeray. I see nowhere 
more often than in authors the truth that men love 
their opposites. Dickens insists on being tragic and 
makes shipwreck. 

I always thought (forgive me) that the Hebrew parts 
of " Dred " were a mistake. Do not think me impertineiit ; I am only honestly anxious that what I consider a very remarkable g'enius should have faith in 
itself. Let your moral take care of itself, and remember that an author's writing-desk is something- infinitely 
higher than a pulpit. What I call " care of itself " is 
shown in that noble passage in the February number 
about the ladder up to heaven. That is grand preaching and in the right way. I am sure that " The Minister's Wooing " is going to be the best of your products 
hitherto, and I am sure of it because you show so 
thorough a mastery of your material, so true a perception of reahties, without which the ideality is impossible. 

As for " orthodoxv," be at ease. Whatever is well 
done the world finds orthodox at last, in spite of all 
the Fakir journals, whose only notion of orthodoxy 
seems to be the power of standing in one position till 
you lose all the use of your limbs. If, with your heart 
and brain, yozi are not orthodox, in Heaven's name who 
is ? If you mean " Calvinistic," no woman could ever 
be such, for Calvinism is logic, and no woman worth 
the name could ever live, by syllogisms. Woman 
charms a higher faculty in us than reason, God be 
praised, and nothing has delighted me more in your new 
story than the happy instinct w ith which you develop 
this incapacity of the lovers' logic in your female characters. Go on just as you have begun, and make it 
appear in as many ways as you like, — tliat, whatever 
creed may be true, it is not true and never will be that 
man can be saved by machinery. I can speak with 
some chance of being right, for I confess a strong 
sympathy with many parts of Calvinistic theology, and, for one thing, believe in hell with all my might, and in 
the o^oodness of God for all that. 

I have not said anything. What could I say ? One 
might almost as well advise a mother about the child 
she still bears under her heart, and say, give it these 
and those qualities, as an author about a work yet in 
the brain. 

Only this I will say, that I am honestly dehghted 
with " The Minister's Wooing ; " that reading it has 
been one of my few editorial pleasures ; that no one 
appreciates your genius more highly than I, or hopes 
more fervently that you will let yourself go without regard to this, that, or t'other. Don't read any criticisms 
on your story : believe that you know better than any 
of us, and be sure that everybody likes it. That I 
know. There is not, and never was, anybody so competent to write a true New England poem as yourself, 
and have no doubt that you are doing it. The native 
sod sends up the best inspiration to the brain, and you 
are as sure of immortality as we all are of dying, — if 
you only go on with entu^e faith in yourself. 

Faithfully and admiringly yours, 

J. R. Lowell.

Andover, June 30, 1858. 

My dear Friend, — I did long to hear from you 
at a time when few knew how to speak, because I knew 
that you did know everything that sorrow can teach, 
— you whose whole life has been a crucifixion, a long 
ordeal. But I believe that the " Lamb," who stands 
forever in the midst of the throne " as it had been 
slain," has everywhere his followers, those who are sent 
into the world, as he was, to suffer for the redemption 
of others, and like him they must look to the joy set 
before them of redeeming others. 

I often think that God called you to this beautiful 
and terrible ministry when He suffered you to link 
your destiny with one so strangely gifted, so fearfully 
tempted, and that the reward which is to meet you, 
when you enter within the veil, where you must soon 
pass, will be to see the angel, once chained and defiled 
within him, set free from sin and glorified, and so know 
that to you it has been given, by your life of love and 
faith, to accomplish this glorious change. 

I think very much on the subject on which you conversed with me once, — the future state of retribution. 
It is evident to me that the spirit of Christianity has 
produced in the human spirit a tenderness of love which 
wholly revolts from the old doctrine on the subject, and 
I observe the more Christ-like any one becomes, the 
more impossible it seems for him to accept it ; and yet. 



340 THE MINISTERS WOOING. 

on the contrary, it was Christ who said, " Fear Him 
that is able to destroy soul and body in hell," and the 
most appalling language on this subject is that of Christ 
himself. Certain ideas once prevalent certainly must 
be thrown off. An endless infliction for past sins was 
once the doctrine that we now generally reject. The 
doctrine as now taught is that of an eternal persistence 
in evil necessitating eternal punishment, since evil induces misery by an eternal nature of things, and this, 
I fear, is inferable from the analogies of nature, and 
confirmed by the whole implication of the Bible. 

Is there any fair way of disposing of the current of 
assertion, and the still deeper undercurrent of implication, on this subject, without one which loosens all faith 
in revelation, and throws us on pure naturalism? But 
of one thing I am sure, — probation does not end with 
this life, and the number of the redeemed may therefore be infinitely greater than the world's history leads 
us to suppose.

February 12, 1859. 

My dear Georgie, — Why have n't I written ? Because, dear Georgie, I am hke the dry, dead, leafless 
tree, and have only cold, dead, slumbering buds of hope 
on the end of stiff, hard, frozen twigs of thought, but 
no leaves, no blossoms ; nothing to send to a little girl who doesn't know what to do with herself any more 
than a kitten. I am cold, weary, dead ; everything is a burden to me. 

I let my plants die by inches before my eyes, and do 
not water them, and I dread everything I do, and wish 
it was not to be done, and so when I get a letter from 
my little girl I smile and say, " Dear little puss, I will 
answer it ; " and I sit hour after hour with folded hands, 
looking at the inkstand and dreading to begin. The 
fact is, pussy, mamma is tired. Life to you is gay and 
joyous, but to mamma it has been a battle in which the 
spirit is willing but the flesh weak, and she would be 
glad, like the woman in the St. Bernard, to lie down 
with her arms around the wayside cross, and sleep away 
into a brighter scene. Henry's fair, sweet face looks 
down upon me now and then from out a cloud, and I 
feel airain all the bitterness of the eternal " No " which 
says I must never, never, in this life, see that face, lean 
on that arm, hear that voice. Not that my faith in God 
in the lei^st fails, and that I do not believe that all this 
is for good. I do, and though not happy, I am blessed. 
Weak, weary as I am, I rest on Jesus in the innermost 
depth of my soul, and am quite sure that there is coming an inconceivable hour of beauty and glory when I 
shall regain Jesus, and he will give me back my beloved 
one, whom he is educating in a far higher sphere than 
I proposed. So do not mistake me, — only know that 
mamma is sitting weary by the wayside, feeling weak 
and worn, but in no sense discouraged. 

Your affectionate mother, 

H. B. S.

London, May 31, 1859. 

Dear Friend, — I have found, particularly as to 
yourself, that if I did not answer from the first impulse, 
all had evaporated. Your letter came by the Niagara, 
which brought Fanny Kemble, to learn the loss of her 
best friend, that Miss Fitzhugh whom you saw at my 
house. 

I have an intense interest in your new novel. More 
power in these few niunbers than in any of your former 
writing's, relatively, at least to my own mind. More 
power than in " Adam Bede," Avhich is the book of the 
season, and well deserves a high place. Whether Mrs. 
Scudder will rival Mrs. Poyser, we shall see. 

It would amuse you to hear my granddaughter and 
myself attempting to foresee the future of the " love 
story," being quite persuaded for the moment that James 
is at sea, and the minister about to ruin himself. We 
think that she will labor to be in love with the selfdevoting man, under her mother's influence, and from 
that hyper-conscientiousness so common with good girls, 
— but we don't wish her to succeed. Then what is to 
become of her older lover ? He — Time will show. I 
have just missed Dale Owen, with whom I wished to 
have conversed about the " Spiritualism." Harris is 
lecturing here on religion. I do not hear him praised. 
People are looking for helps to believe everywhere but 
in life, — in music, in architecture, in antiquity, in ceremony, — and upon all is wi-itten, " Thou shalt not 
beheve." At least, if this be faith, happier the unbeliever. I am willing to see through that materialism, 
but if I am to rest there, I would rend the veil. 

June 1. The day of the packet's sailing. I shall 
hope to be visited by you here. The best flowers sent 
me have been placed in your little vases, g'iving life, as 
it were, to the remembrance of you, though not to pass 
away like them. 

Ever yours, 

A. T. Noel Byron.

Castle Chillon, Switzerland, September 1, 1859. 

Dear little Charley, — We are all here except 
Fred, and all well. We have had a most interesting 
journey, of which I must give a brief account. 

We sailed from New York in the steamer Asia, on 
the 3d of August [1859], a very hot day, and for ten 
days it was the hottest weather I ever knew at sea. 
We had a splendid ship's company, mostly foreigners, 
Italians, Spaniards, with a sprinkling of Scotch and 
Irish. We passed one big iceberg in the night close to, 
and as the iceberg would n't turn out for us we turned 
out for the iceberg, and were very glad to come off so. 
This was the night of the 9tli of August, and after 
that we had cooler weather, and on the morning of the 
13th the wind blew like all possessed, and so continued till afternoon. Sunday morning, the 14th, we got safe into Liverpool, landed, and went to the Adelphi Hotel. Mamma and Georgie were only a little 
sick on the way over, and that was the morning of the 
13th. 

As it was court time, the high sheriff of Lancashire, 
Sir Robert Gerauld, a fine, stout, old, gray-haired John 
Bull, came thundering up to the hotel at noon in his 
grand coach with six beautiful horses with outriders, 
and two trumpeters, and twelve men with javelins for a 
guard, all dressed in the gayest manner, and rushing 
along hke Time in the primer, the trumpeters too-ti-toottooing hke a house a-fire, and how I wished my little 
Charley had been there to see it ! 

Monday we wanted to go and see the court, so we 
went over to St. George's Hall, a most magnificent 
structure, that beats the Boston State House all hollow, 
and Sir Robert Gerauld himself met us, and said he 
would get us a good place. So he took us away round 
a narrow, crooked passage, and opened a little door, 
where we saw nothing but a great, crimson curtain, 
which he told us to put aside and go straight on ; and 
where do you think we all found ourselves ? 

Right on the platform with the judges in their big 
wigs and long robes, and facing the whole crowded 
court ! It was enough to frighten a body into fits, but 
we took it quietly as we could, and your mamma looked 
as meek as Moses in her httle, battered straw hat and 
gray cloak, seeming to say, " I did n't come here o' 
purpose." 

That same night we arrived in London, and Tuesday 
(August 16th), riding over the city, we called at Stafford 
House, and inquired if the Duchess of Sutherland was there. A servant came out and said the duchess was 
in and would be very glad to see us ; so your mamma, 
Georg'ie, and I went walking up the magnificent stau-case in the entrance hall, and the great, noble, brilhant duchess came sailing down the stairs to meet 
us, in her white morning dress (for it was only four 
o'clock in the afternoon, and she was not yet dressed 
for dinner), took your mamma into her great bosom, 
and folded her up till the little Yankee woman looked 
like a small gray kitten half covered in a snowbank, 
and kissed and kissed her, and then she took up little 
Georgie and kissed her, and then she took my hand, 
and did n't kiss me. 

Next day we went to the duchess's villa, near Windsor Castle, and had a grand time riding round the park, 
sailing on the Thames, and eating the very best dinner 
that was ever set on a table. 

We stayed in London till the 25th of August, and 
then went to Paris and found H. and E. and H. B. 
all well and happy ; and on the 30th of August we all 
went to Geneva together, and to-day, the 1st of September, we all took a sail up the beautiful Lake Leman 
here in the midst of the Alps, close by the old castle 
of Chillon, about which Lord Byron has written a poem. 
In a day or two we shall go to Chamouni, and then 
Georgie and I will go back to Paris and London, and 
so home at the time appointed. Until then I remain 
as ever. Your loving father, 

C. E. Stowe.

[October 9th, 18??, Lausanne] 

My dear Husband, — Here we are at Lausanne, in 
the Hotel Gibbon, occupying the very parlor that the 
Ruskins had when we were here before. The day I 
left you I progressed prosperously to Paris. Reached 
there about one o'clock at nio-ht : could o;et no carriag-e, 
and finally had to turn in at a little hotel close by the 
station, where I slept till morning. I could not but 
think what if anything should hajjpen to me there ? Nobody knew me or where I was, but the bed was clean, 
the room respectable ; so I locked my door and slept, 
then took a carriage in the morning, and found Madame 
Borione at breakfast. I write to-night, that you may 
get a letter fi-om me at the earhest possible date after 
your return. 

Instead of coming to Geneva in one day, I stopped 
over one night at Macon, got to Geneva the next day 
about four o'clock, and to Lausanne at eight. Coming 
up-stairs and opening the door, I found the whole party 
seated with their books and embroidery about a centretable, and looking as homelike and cosy as possible. 
You may imagine the greetings, the kissing, laughing, 
and good times generally.

Florence, Christmas Day, 1859. 

My dear Husband, — I wish you all a Merry Christmas, hoping to spend the next one with you. 

For us, we are expecting to spend this evening with 
quite a circle of American friends. With Scoville and 
Fred came L. Bacon (son of Dr. Bacon) ; a Mr. Porter, 
who is to study theology at Andover, and is now making the tour of Europe ; Mr. Clarke, formerly minister at 
Cornwall ; Mr. Jenkyns, of Lowell ; Mr. and Mrs. Howard, John and Annie Howard, who came in most unexpectedly upon us last night. So we shall have quite a 
New England party, and shall sing Millais' Christmas 
hymn in great force. Hope you will all do the same in 
the old stone cabin. 

Our parlor is all trimmed with laurel and myrtle, looking like a great bower, and our mantel and table are 
redolent with bouquets of orange blossoms and pinks. 

January 16, 18G0. 

My dear Husband, — Your letter received to-day 
has raised quite a weight from my mind, for it shows 
that at last you have received all mine, and that thus 
the chain of communication between us is unbroken. 
What you said about your spiritual experiences in feeling the presence of dear Henry with you, and, above 
all, the vibration of that mysterious guitar, was very 
pleasant to me. Since I have been in Florence, I have 
been distressed by inexpressible yearnings after him, — 
such sighings and outreachings, with a sense of utter 
darkness and separation, not only from him but from 
aU spiritual communion with my God. But I have become acquainted with a friend through whom I receive 
consoling impressions of these things, — a Mrs. E., of 
Boston, a very pious, accompHshed, and interesting 
woman, who has had a history much like yours in relation to spiritual manifestations. 

Without doubt she is what the spiritualists would 
regard as a very powerful medium, but being a very 
earnest Christian, and afraid of getting led astray, she 
has kept carefully aloof from all circles and things of 
that nature. She came and opened her mind to me in 
the first place, to ask my advice as to what she had better do ; relating experiences very similar to many of 
yours. 

My advice was substantially to try the spirits whether 
they were of God, — to keep close to the Bible and 
prayer, and then accept whatever came. But I have 
found that when I am with her I receive very strong 
impressions from the spiritual world, so that I feel often 
sustained and comforted, as if I had been near to my 
Henry and other departed friends. This has been at 
times so strong as greatly to soothe and support me. I 
told her your experiences, in which she was greatly interested. She said it was so rare to hear of Christian 
and reliable people with such peculiarities. 

I cannot, however, think that Henry strikes the guitar, — that must be Eliza. Her spirit has ever seemed to 
chno' to that mode of manifestation, and if you would 
keep it in your sleeping-room, no doubt you would hear 
from it oftener. I have been reading lately a curious 
work from an old German in Paris who has been making experiments in spirit-writing. He purports to describe a series of meetings held in the presence of fifty 
witnesses, whose names he gives, in Avhich writing has 
come on paper, without the apparition of hands or any 
pen or pencil, from various historical people. 

He seems a devout believer in inspiration, and the 
book is curious for its mixture of all the phenomena, 
Pagan and Christian, going over Hindoo, Chinese, 
Greek, and Italian literature for examples, and then 
brinoinof similar ones from the Bible. 

One thing I am convinced of, — that spiritualism is a 
reaction from the intense materialism of the present age. 
Luther, when he recognized a personal devil, was much 
nearer right. We ought to enter fully, at least, into 
the spiritualism of the Bible. Circles and spiritual jugglery I regard as the lying signs and wonders, with all 
deceivableness of unrighteousness ; but there is a real 
scriptural spiritualism which has fallen into disuse, and 
must be revived, and there are, doubtless, people who, 
from some constitutional formation, can more readily 
receive the impressions of the surrounding spiritual 
world. Such were apostles, prophets, and workers of 
miracles. 

Sunday evening. To-day I went down to sit with 
Mrs. E. in her quiet parlor. We read in Revelation 
together, and talked of the saints and spirits of the just 
made perfect, till it seemed, as it always does when with 
her, as if Henry were close by me. Then a curious 
thing happened. She has a Httle Florentine guitar 
which hangs in her parlor, quite out of reach. She and 
I were talking, and her sister, a very matter-of-fact, 
practical body, who attends to temporals for her, was 
arranging a little lunch for us, when suddenly the bass 
string of the guitar was struck loudly and distinctly. 

" Who struck that guitar ? " said the sister. We 
both looked up and saw that no body or thing was on 
that side of the room. After the sister had gone out, 
Mrs. E. said, " Now, that is strange ! I asked last night 
that if any spirit was present with us after you came 
to-day, that it would try to touch that guitar." A little 
while after her husband came in, and as we were talking 
we were all stopped by a peculiar sound, as if somebody 
had drawn a hand across all the strings at once. We 
marveled, and I remembered the guitar at home. 

What think you ? Have you had any more manifestations, any truths from the spirit world ?

Geneva, June 18, 1800. 

Dear Mrs. Stowe, — It takes a great deal, when I 
am at Geneva, to make me wish myself anywhere else, 
and, of all places else, in London ; nevertheless, I very 
heartily wish at this moment that I were looking out 
on the Norwood Hills, and were expecting you and the 
children to breakfast to-morrow. 

I had very serious thoughts, when I received your 
note, of running home ; but I expected that very day 
an American friend, Mr. S., who I thought would miss 
me more here than you would in London ; so I stayed. 

What a dreadful thing it is that people should have 
to go to America again, after coming to Europe ! It 
seems to me an inversion of the order of nature. I 
think America is a sort of " United " States of Probation, out of which all wise people, being once delivered, 
and having obtained entrance into this better world, 
should never be expected to return (sentence irremediably ungrammatical), particularly when they have 
been making themselves cruelly pleasant to friends here. 
My friend Norton, whom I met first on this very blue 
lake water, had no business to go back to Boston again, 
any more than you. 

I was waiting^ for S. at the railroad station on Thursday, and thinking of you, naturally enough, — it seemed 
so short a while since we were there together. I managed to get hold of Georgie as she was crossing the 
rails, and packed her in opposite my mother and beside 
me, and was thinking myself so clever, Avhen you sent 
that rascally courier for her ! I never forgave him 
any of his behavior after his imperativeness on that 
occasion. 

And so she is getting nice and strong? Ask her, 
please, Avhen you write, with my love, whether, when 
she stands now behind the great stick, one can see much 
of her on each side ? 

So you have been seeing the Pope and all his Easter 
performances ? I congratulate you, for I suppose it is 
something like " Positively the last appearance on any 
staofe." What was the use of thinkin(r about Aim ? You 
should have had your own thoughts about what was to 
come after him. I don't mean that Roman Catholicism 
will die out so quickly. It will last pretty nearly as long' as Protestantism, which keeps it up ; but I wonder 
what is to come next. That is the main question just 
now for everybody. 

So you are coming round to Venice, after all ? We 
shall all have to come to it, depend upon it, some way 
or another. There never has been anything in any 
other part of the world like Venetian strength well 
developed. 

I 've no heart to write about anything in Europe to 
you now. When are you coming back again ? Please 
send me a line as soon as you get safe over, to say you 
are all — wrong, but not lost in the Atlantic. 

I don't know if you will ever get this letter, but I 
hope you will think it worth while to glance again at 
the Denmark Hill pictures ; so I send this to my father, 
who, I hope, will be able to give it you. 

I really am very sorry you are going, — you and 
yours ; and that is absolute fact, and I shall not enjoy 
my Swiss journey at all so much as I might. It was a 
shame of you not to give me warning before. I could 
have stopped at Paris so easily for you ! All good be 
with you ! Remember me devotedly to the young 
ladies, and beheve me ever affectionately yours, 

J. RUSKIN.

Rome, 126 Via Felice, 14 March, 1861. 

My dear Mrs. Stowe, — Let me say one word 
first. Your letter, which would have given me pleasure if I had been in the midst of pleasures, came to me 
when little beside could have pleased. Dear friend, 
let me say it, I had had a great blow and loss in England, and you wrote things in that letter which seemed 
meant for me, meant to do me good, and which did me 
good, — the first good any letter or any talk did me ; 
and it struck me as strange, as more than a coincidence, that your first word since we parted in Rome 
last spring should come to me in Rome, and bear so 
directly on an experience which you did not know of. 
I thank you very much. 

The earnest stanzas I sent to England for one who 
wanted them even more than I. I don't know how 
people can keep up their prejudices against spiritualism 
with tears in their eyes, — how they are not, at least, 
thrown on the " ^ash that it misfht be true," and the 
investigation of the phenomena, by that abrupt shutting in their faces of the door of death, which shuts 
them out from the sight of their beloved. My tendency is to beat up against it like a crying child. Not 
that this emotional impulse is the best for turning the 
key and obtaining safe conclusions, — no. I did not 
write before because I always do shrink from touching 
my own griefs, one feels at first so sore that nothing 
but stillness is borne. It is only after, when one is 
better, that one can express one's self at all. This is so 
with me, at least, though perhaps it ought not to be so 
with a poet. 

If you saw my " De Profundis " you must understand that it was written nearly twenty years ago, and 
referred to what went before. Mr. Howard's affliction 
made me think of the MS. (in reference to a sermon of 
Dr. Beecher's in the " Independent "), and I pulled it 
out of a secret place and sent it to America, not thinking that the publication would fall in so nearly with a 
new grief of mine as to lead to misconceptions. In 
fact the poem would have been an exaggeration in that 
case, and unsiutable in other respects. 

It refers to the greatest affliction of my life, — the 
only time when I felt despair, — written a year after or 
more. Forgive all these reticences. My husband calls 
me "peculiar" in some things, — peculiarly laclie, perhaps. I can't articulate some names, or speak of certain afflictions ; — no, not to Mm, — not after all these 
years ! It 's a sort of dumbness of the soul. Blessed 
are those who can speak, I say. But don't you see 
from this how I must want " spiritualism " above most 
persons ? 

Now let me be ashamed of this egotism, together 
with the rest of the weakness obtruded on you here, 
when I should rather have congratulated you, my dear 
friend, on the gi-eat crisis you are passing through in 
America. If the North is found noble enough to stand 
fast on the moral question, whatever the loss or diminution of territory, God and just men will see you greater 
and more g-lorious as a nation. 

I had much anxiety for you after the Seward and 
Adams speeches, but the danger seems averted by that 
fine madness of the Soutli which seems judicial. The 
tariff movement we should regret deeply (and do, some 
of us), only I am told it was wanted in order to j^ersuade those who were less accessible to moral argument. 
It 's eking out the holy water with ditch water. If the 
Devil flees before it, even so, let us be content. How 
you must feel, you who have done so much to set this 
accursed slavery in the glare of the world, convicting it 
of hideousness ! They should raise a statue to you in 
America and elsewhere. 

Meanwhile I am reading you in the " Independent," 
sent to me by Mr. Tilton, with the greatest interest. 
Your new novel opens beautifully.^ 

Do write to me and teU me of yourself and the subjects which interest us both. It seems to me that our 
Roman affairs may hnger a little (while the Papacy 
bleeds slowly to death in its finances) on account of 
this violent clerical opposition in France. Otherwise 
we were prepared for the fall of the house any morning. Prince Napoleon's sjDeech represents, with whatever slight discrepancy, the inner mind of the emperor. 
It occupied seventeen columns of the " Moniteur " and 
was mag-nificent. Victor Emmanuel wrote to thank him 
for it in the name of Italy, and even the English papers 
praised it as " a masterly exposition of the policy of 
France." It is settled that we shall wait for Venice. 
It will not be for long. Hungary is only waiting, and 
even in the ashes of Poland there are flickering sparks. 
Is it the beo-inninof of the restitution of all thinor-s ? 

Here in Rome there are fewer English than usual, 
and more empty houses. There is a new story every 
morning, and nobody to cut off the head of the Scheherazade. Yesterday the Pope was going to Venice 
directly, and, the day before, fixed the hour for Victor 

1 The Pearl of Orr's Island. 



LETTER TO DR. HOLMES. 359 

Emmanuel's coming, and the day before that brought 
a letter from Cavour to Antonelli about sweeping- the 
streets clean for the feet of the king. The poor Romans live on these stories, while the Holy Father and 
king of Naples meet holding one another's hands, and 
cannot speak for sobs. The little queen, however, is a 
heroine in her way and from her point of view, and 
when she drives about in a common fiacre, looking very 
pretty under her only crown left of golden hair, one 
nmst feel sorry that she was not born and married 
nearer to holy ground. My husband prays you to 
remember him, and I ask your daughters to remember 
both of us. Our boy rides his pony and studies under 
his abbe, and keeps a pair of red cheeks, thank God. 

I ought to send you more about the society in Rome, 
but I have lived much alone this winter, and have Httle 
to tell you. Dr. Manning and Mr. DeVere stay aw^ay, 
not bearing, perhaps, to see the Pope in his agony. 
Your ever affectionate friend, 

Elizabeth B. Browning.

Andover, September 9, 1860. 

Dear Dr. Holmes, — I have had an impulse upon 
me for a long time to write you a line of recognition 
and sympathy, in response to those that reached me 
monthly in your late story in the " Atlantic " (" Elsie 
Venner"). 

I know not what others may think of it, smce I have 
seen nobody since my return ; but to me it is of deeper 
and broader interest than anything you have done yet, 
and I feel an intense curiosity concerning that underwork! of thought from which like bubbles your incidents and remarks often seem to burst up. The foundations of moral responsibihty, the interlacing laws of 
nature and spirit, and their relations to us here and 
hereafter, are topics which I ponder more and more, 
and on which only one medically educated can write 
well. I think a course of medical study ought to be 
required of all ministers. How I should like to talk 
with you upon the strange list of topics suggested in 
the schoolmaster's letter ! They are bound to agitate 
the pubHc mind more and more, and it is of the cliiefest 
importance to learn, if we can, to thuik soundly and 
wisely of them. Nobody can be a sound theologian 
who has not had his mind drawn to think with reverential fear on these topics. 

AUow me to hint that the monthly numbers are not 
Ions: enouofh. Get us along- a little faster. You must 
work this well out. Elaborate and give us all the particulars. Old Sophie is a jewel ; give us more of her. 
I have seen her. Could you ever come out and spend 
a day with us ? The professor and I would so lilie to 
have a talk on some of these matters Avith you ! 

Very truly yours, H. B. Stowe. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Andover, February 18, 18G1. 

Dear Doctor, — I was quite indignant to hear 
yesterday of the very unjust and stupid attack upon 
you in the . Mr. Stowe has written to them a remonstrance which I hope they will allow to appear 
as he wrote it, and over his name. He was well acquainted Avith your father and feels the impropriety of 
the tliino'. 

But, my dear friend, in being shocked, surprised, or 
displeased personally with such things, we must consider other people's natures. A man or woman may 
wound us to the quick without knowing it, or meaning 
to do so, simply through difference of fibre. As Cowper hath somewhere happily said : — 

" Oh, why are farmers made so coarse, 
Or clergy made so fine ? 
A kick that scarce might move a horse 
Might kill a sound diviue." 

When once people get ticketed, and it is known that 
one is a hammer, another a saw, and so on, if we happen 
to get a taste of their quality we cannot help being 
hurt, to be sure, but w^e shall not take it ill of them. 
There be pious, well-intending beetles, wedges, hammers, saws, and all other kinds of implements, good — 
except where they come in the Avay of our fingers — 
and from a beetle you can have only a beetle's gospel. 

I have suffered in my day from this sort of handling, 
which is worse for us women, who must never answer, 
and once when I wrote to Lady Byron, feeling just as 
you do about some very stupid and unkind things that 
had invaded my personality, she answered me, " Words 
do not kill, my dear, or I should have been dead long 

ago-" 

There is much true relisfion and kindness in the 

world, after all, and as a general thing he who has 

struck a nerve would be very sorry for it if he only 

knew what he. had done. 

I would say nothing, if I were you. There is eternal 
vii'tue in silence. 

I must express my pleasure with the closing chapters 
of " Elsie." They are nobly and beautifully done, and 
quite come up to what I wanted to complete my idea of 
her character. I am quite satisfied with it now. It is 
an artistic creation, original and beautiful. 
BeHeve me to be your true friend, 

H. B. Stowe.

the Duchess of Argyll : — 

Andover, July 31, 1863. 

My dear Friend, — Your lovely, generous letter 
was a real comfort to me, and reminded me that a year 
— and, alas ! a whole year — had passed since I wrote 
to your dear mother, of whom I think so often as one 
of God's noblest creatures, and one whom it comforts 
me to think is still in our world. 

So many, good and noble, have passed away whose 
friendship was such a pride, such a comfort to me ! 
Your noble father. Lady Byron, Mrs. BroAvning, — 
their spirits are as perfect as ever passed to the world of 
light. I grieve about your dear mother's eyes. I have 
thought about you all, many a sad, long, quiet hour, as 
I have lain on my bed and looked at the pictures on 
my wall ; one, in particular, of the moment before the 
Crucifixion, Avhich is the first thing I look at when I 
wake in the morning. I think how suffering is, and 
must be, the portion of noble spirits, and no lot so 
brilliant that must not first or last dip into the shadow 
of that eclij^se. Prince Albert, too, the ideal knight, 
the Prince Arthur of our times, the good, wise, steady 
head and heart we — that is, our world, we Anglo-Saxons — need so much. And the Queen ! yes, I have 
thought of and prayed for her, too. But could a 
woman hope to have always such a heart, and yet ever 
be weaned from earth " all this and heaven, too " ? 

Under my picture I have inscribed, " Forasmuch as 
Christ also hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same mind." 

This year has been one long sigh, one smothering 
sob, to me. And I thank God that we have as yet one 
or two orenerous friends in England who understand 
and feel for our cause. 

The utter failure of Christian, anti-slavery England, 
in those Instincts of a right heart which always can see 
where the cause of liberty lies, has been as bitter a 
grief to me as was the similar prostration of all our 
American religious people in the day of the Fugitive 
Slave Law. Exeter Hall is a humbug, a pious humbug, like the rest. Lord Shaftesbury. Well, let him 
go ; he is a Tory, and has, after all, the instincts of his 
class. But I saw your duke's speech to his tenants ! 
That was grand ! If he can see these things, they are 
to be seen, and why cannot Exeter Hall see them ? It 
is simply the want of the honest heart. 

Why do the horrible barbarities of Southern soldiers 
cause no comment? Why is the sympathy of the British Parliament reserved for the poor women of New 
Orleans, deprived of their elegant amusement of throwing vitriol into soldiers' faces, and practicing indecencies inconceivable in any other state of society ? Why 
is fill expression of sympathy on the Southern side ? 
There is a class of women in New Orleans whom Butler 
protects from horrible barbarities, that up to his day 
have been practiced on them by these so-called New Orleans ladies, but British sympathy has ceased to notice 
them. You see I am bitter. I am. You wonder at 
my brother. He is a man, and feels a thousand times 
more than I can, and deeper than all he ever has expressed, the spirit of these things. You must not wonder, therefore. Remember it is the moment when every nerve is vital ; it is our agony ; we tread the winepress 
alone, and they whose cheap rhetoric has been for years 
pushing us into it now desert en ynasse. I thank my 
God I always loved and trusted most those who now do 
stand true, — your family, your duke, yourself, your 
noble mother. I have lost Lady Byron. Her great 
heart, her eloquent letters, would have been such a joy 
to me ! And Mrs. Browning, oh such a heroic woman ! 
None of her poems can express what she was, — so 
grand, so comprehending, so strong, with such inspired 
insight ! She stood by Italy through its crisis. Her 
heart was with all gfood throug^h the world. Your 
prophecy that we shall come out better, truer,- stronger, 
will, I am confident, be true, and it was worthy of yourself and your good lineage. 

Slavery will be sent out by this agony. We are only 
in the throes and ravings of the exorcism. The roots 
of the cancer have gone everywhere, but they must die 
— will. Already the Confiscation Bill is its natural 
destruction. Lincoln has been too slow. He should 
have done it sooner, and with an impulse, but come it 
must, come it will. Your mother will live to see slavery abolished, unless England forms an alliance to hold 
it up. England is the great reliance of the slave-power 
to-day, and next to England the faltering weakness of 
the North, which palters and dare not fire the great 
broadside for fear of hittino'' friends. These tliino['s 
must be done, and sudden, sharp remedies are mei^cy. 
Just now we are in a dark hour ; but whether God be 
with us or not, I know He is with the slave, and with 
his redemption Avill come the solution of our question. 
I have long known lohat and who we had to deal with in this, for when I wrote " Uncle Tom's Cabin " I had 
letters addressed to me showing a state of society perr 
fectly inconceivable. That they violate graves, make 
drinking-cups of skulls, that ladles wear cameos cut 
from bones, and treasure scalps, is no surprise to me. 
If I had written what I knew of the obscenity, brutality, and cruelty of that society clown there, society 
would have cast out the books ; and it is for their interest, the interest of the whole race in the South, that we 
should succeed. I wish them no ill, feel no bitterness ; 
they have had a Dahomian education which makes them 
savage. We don't expect any more of them, but if 
slavery is destroyed, one generation of education and 
liberty will efface these stains. They will come to 
themselves, these States, and be glad it is over. 

I am using up my paper to little purpose. Please 
give my best love to your dear mother. I am going to 
write to her. If I only could have written the things 
I have often thought ! I am going to put on her bracelet, witli the other dates, that of the abolition of slavery 
in the District of Columbia. Remember me to the 
duke and to your dear children. My husband desires 
his best regards, my daughters also. 

I am lovingly ever yours, 

H. B. Stowe.

Mrs. H. B. Stowe : 

Dear Madam, — Among the thousands of wounded and dying men on tliis war-scarred field, I have just 
met with your son, Captain Stowe. If you have not ah-eady heard from him, it may cheer your heart to 
know that he is in the hands of good, kind friends. He was struck by a fragment of a shell, which entered 
his right ear. He is quiet and cheerful, longs to see some member of his family, and is, above all, anxious that they should hear from him as soon as possible. I assured him I would write at once, and thoug^h I am 
wearied by a week's labor here among scenes of terrible suffering, I know that, to a mother's anxious heart, even 
a hasty scrawl about her boy will be more tlian welcome. 

May God bless and sustain you in this troubled time ! 
Yours with sincere sympathy, 

J. M. Crowell.

Rochdale, March 9, 1863. 

Dear Mrs. Stowe, — I received your kind note with real pleasure, and felt it very good of you to send 
me a copy of the " Atlantic Monthly " with your noble 
letter to the women of England. I read every word of 
it with an intense interest, and I am quite sure that its 
effect upon opinion here has been marked and beneficial. It has covered some with shame, and it has 
compelled many to think, and it has stimulated not a 
few to act. Before this reaches you, you will have 
seen what large and earnest meetings have been held in 
all our towns in favor of abolition and the North. No town has a building large enough to contain those who 
come to listen, to applaud, and to vote in favor of freedom and the Union. The effect of this is evident on 
our newspapers and on the tone of Parliament, where 
now nobody says a word in favor of recognition, or 
mediation, or any such tiling. 

The need and duty of England is admitted to be a 
strict neutrality, but the feeling of the millions of her 
people is one of friendliness to the United States and 
its government. It would cause universal rejoicing, 
among all but a limited circle of aristocracy and commercially rich and corrupt, to hear that the Northern 
forces had taken Vicksburg on the great river, and 
Charleston on the Atlantic, and that the neck of the 
conspiracy was utterly broken. 

I hope your people may have strength and virtue to 
win the great cause intrusted to them, but it is fearful 
to contemplate the amount of the depravity in the 
North engendered by the long power of slavery. New 
England is far ahead of the States as a whole, — too 
instructed and too moral ; but still I will hope that 
she will bear the nation through this appalling danger. 

I well remember the evening at Rome and our conversation. You lamented the election of Buchanan. 
You judged him with a more unfriendly but a more 
correct eye than mine. He turned out more incapable 
and less honest than I hoped for. And I think I was 
right in saying that your party was not then sufficiently 
consolidated to enable it to maintain its poHcy in the 
execution, even had Fremont been elected. As it is 
now, six years later, the North but falteringly supports 
the policy of the government, though impelled by the force of events which then you did not dream of. 
President Lincohi lias lived half his troubled reisfn. In 
the coming half I hope he may see land ; surely slavery 
will be so broken up that nothing can restore and 
renew it ; and, slavery once fairly gone, I know not 
how all your States can long be kept asunder. 
Beheve me very sincerely yours, 

John Bright. 

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Palace, Dublin, January, 1863. 

Dear Madam, — In acknowledging your letter and 
pamphlet, I take the opportunity of laying before you 
what I collect to be the prevailing sentiments here on 
American affairs. Of course there is a great variety 
of opinion, as may be expected in a country like ours. 
Some few sympathize with the Northerns, and some few 
with the Southerns, but far the greater portion sympathize with neither completely, but lament that each 
party should be making so much greater an expenditure 
of life and property than can be compensated for by 
any advantage they can dream of obtaining. 

Those who are the least favorable to the Northerns 
are not so from any approbation of slavery, but from 
not understanding that the war is waged in the cause 
of abolition. " It was waged," they say, " ostensibly 
for the restoration of the Union," and in attestation of 
this, they refer to the proclamation which announced 
the confiscation of slaves that were the property of 
secessionists, while those who adhered to the Federal 
cause should be exempt from such confiscation, which they say, did not savor much of zeal for abolition. 
And if the other object — the restoration of the Union 
— could be accomplished, which they all reo-ard as 
hoijeless, they do not understand how it will tend to 
the abolition of slavery. On the contrary, "if," say 
they, " the separation had been allowed to take place 
peaceably, the Northerns might, as we do, have proclaimed freedom to every slave who set foot on theii- territory ; which would have been a great check to slavery, 
and especially to any cruel treatment of slaves." Many 
who have a great disHke to slavery yet hold that the 
Southerns had at least as much right to secede as the 
Americans had originally to revolt from Great Britain. 
And there are many who think that, considering the 
dreadful distress we have suffered from the cotton famine, we have shown great forbearance in withstanding 
the temptation of recognizing the Southern States and 
to break the blockade. 

Then, again, there are some who are provoked at the 
incessant railing at England, and threats of an invasion 
of Canada, which are poured forth in some of the 
American papers. 

There are many, also, who consider that the present 
state of things cannot continue much longer if the Confederates continue to hold their own, as they have done 
hitherto ; and that a people who shall have maintained 
their independence for two or three years will be recognized by the principal European powers. Such 
appears to have been the procedure of the European 
powers in all similar cases, such as the revolt of the 
Anglo-American and Spanish-American colonies, of the 
Haytians and the Belgians. In these and other like 
cases, the rule practically adopted seems to have been to recognize the revolters, not at once, but after a reasonable time had been allowed to see whether they 
could maintain their independence ; and this without 
being understood to have pronounced any decision 
either way as to the justice of the cause. 

Moreover, there are many who say that the negroes 
and people of color are far from being kindly or justly 
treated in the Northern States. An emancipated slave, 
at any rate, has not received good training for earning 
his bread by the wages of labor ; and if, in addition to 
this and his being treated as an outcast, he is excluded, 
as it is said, from many employments, by the refusal of 
white laborers to work along wdth him, he will have 
gained little by taking refuge in the Northern States. 

I have now laid before you the views which I conceive to be most prevalent among us, and for which I 
am not myself responsible. 

For the safe and effectual emancipation of slaves, I 
myself consider there is no plan so good as the gradual 
one which was long ago suggested by Bishop Hinds. 
What he recommended was an ad valorem tax upon 
slaves, — the value to be fixed by the owner, witli an 
option to government to purchase at that price. Thus 
the slaves would be a burden to the master, and those 
the most so who should be the most valuable, as being 
the most intelligent and steady, and therefore the best 
qualified for freedom ; and it would be his interest to 
train his slaves to be free laborers, and to emancipate 
them, one by one, as speedily as he could with safety. 
I fear, however, that the time is gone by for trying this 
experiment in America. 

With best w ishes for the new year, believe me 

Yours faithfully, Rd. Whately.

I read with great pleasure your article in the last

I should think it might be that ; but he is a hardened

vantage-ground on which to parade his own virtue and 
sneer at our iniquity.

Hartford, February 19, 1866. 

My dear Frieistd, — Your letter was a real spring of comfort to me, bringing refreshingly the pleasant 
hbrary at Inverary and the lovely days I spent there. 

I am grieved at what you say of your dear mother's 
health. I showed your letter to Mrs. Perkins, and we 
both agreed in saying that V)e should like for a time to 
hll the place of maid to her, as doubtless you all feel, 
too. I should so love to be with her, to read to her, 
and talk to her ! and oh, there is so much that would 
cheer and comfort a noble heart like hers that we could 
talk about. Oh, my friend, when I think of what has 
been done these last few years, and of what is now 
doing, I am lost in amazement. I have just, by way 
of realizing it to myself, been reading " Uncle Tom's Cabin " again, and when I read that book, scarred and 
seared and burned into with the memories of an anguish and horror that can never be forgotten, and think 
it is all over now, all past, and that now the questions 
debated are simply of more or less time before granting 
legal suffrage to those who so lately were held only as 
articles of merchandise, — when this comes over me I 
think no private or individual sorrow can ever make me 
wholly without comfort. If my faith in God's presence 
and real, living power in the aifairs of men ever grows 
dim, this makes it impossible to doubt. 

I have just had a sweet and lovely Christian letter 
from Garrison, whose beautiful comj)osure and thankfulness in his hour of victory are as remarkable as his 
wonderful courage in the day of moral battle. His 
note ends with the words, " And who but God is to be 
glorified ? " Garrison's attitude is far more exalted 
than that of Wendell PhilHps. He acknowledges the 
great deed done. He suspends his " Liberator " with 
words of devout thanksgiving, and devotes himself 
unobtrusively to the work yet to be accomplished for 
the freedmen ; while Pliillips seems resolved to ignore 
the mighty work that has been done, because of the 
inevitable shortcomings and imperfections that beset it 
still. We have a Congress of splendid men, — men of 
stalwart principle and determination. We have a President ^ honestly seeking to do right ; and if he fails in 
knowing just what right is, it is because he is a man 
born and reared in a slave State, and acted on by many 
influences which we cannot rightly estimate unless we 
were in his place. My brother Henry has talked with him earnestly and confidentially, and has faith in him 
as an earnest, good man seeking to do right. Henry 
takes the ground that it is unwise and impolitic to 
endeavor to force negro suffrage on the South at the 
point of the bayonet. His poUcy would be, to hold 
over the negro the protection of our Freedman's Bureau 
until the gieat laws of free labor shall begin to draw 
the master and servant together ; to endeavor to soothe 
and conciliate, and win to act with us, a party composed of the really good men at the South. 

For this reason he has always advocated lenity of 
measures towards them. He wants to get them into a 
state in which the moral influence of the North can act 
upon them beneficially, and to get such a state of 
things that there will be a party at the South to protect the negro. 

Charles Sumner is looking simply at the abstract 
right of the thing. Henry looks at actual probabiHties. 
We all know that the state of society at the South is 
such that laws are a very inadequate protection even to 
white men. Southern elections always have been scenes 
of mob violence ichen only white men voted. 

Multitudes of lives have been lost at the polls in this 
way, and if against their will negro suffrage was forced 
upon them, I do not see how any one in their senses can 
expect anything less than an immediate war of races. 

H negro suffrage were required as a condition of 
acquiring political position, there is no doubt the slave 
States Avould grant it ; grant it nominally, because they 
would know that the grant never could or would become an actual realization. And what would then be 
jrained for the neo:ro ? 

I am sorry that people cannot differ on such great 
and perplexing public questions without impugning 
each other's motives. Henry has been called a backslider because of the lenity of his counsels, but I cannot but think it is the Spirit of Christ that influences 
him. Garrison has been in the same way spoken of as 
a deserter, because he says that a work that is done 
shall be called done, and because he would not keep up 
an anti-slavery society when slavery is abolished ; and I 
think our President is much injured by the abuse that 
is heaped on him, and the selfish and unworthy motives 
that are ascribed to him by those who seem determined 
to allow to nobody an honest, unselfish difference in 
judgment from their own. 

Henry has often spoken of you and your duke as 
pleasant memories in a scene of almost superhmnan 
labor and excitement. He often said to me : " AVhen 
this is all over, — when we have won the victory, — then 
I will write to the duchess." But when it was over 
and the flag" raised agrain at Sumter his arm was smitten down with the news of our President's death ! We 
all appreciate your noble and true sympathy through 
the dark hour of our national trial. You and yours 
are almost the only friends we now have left in England. You cannot know what it was, unless you could 
imagine your own country to be in danger of death, 
extinction of nationality. Thaty dear friend, is an experience which shows us what we are and what we can 
feel. I am glad to hear that we may hope to see your 
son in this coimtry. I fear so many pleasant calls will 
beset his path that we cannot hope for a moment, but 
it would give us all the greatest pleasure to see him here. Our dull, prosy, commonplace, though good old 
Hartford could offer few attractions compared with 
Boston or New York, and yet I hope he will not leave 
us out altogether if he comes among us. God bless 
him ! You are very happy indeed in being permitted 
to keep all your dear ones and see them growing up. 

I want to ask a favor. Do you have, as we do, 
cartes de vislte f If you have, and could send me one 
of yourself and the duke and of Lady Edith and your 
eldest son, I should be so very glad to see how you are 
looking now ; and the dear mother, too, I should so like 
to see how she looks. It seems almost like a dream to 
look back to those J3leasant days. I am glad to see 
you still keep some memories of our goings on. Georgie's marriage is a very happy one to us. They live in 
Stockbridge, the loveliest part of Massachusetts, and 
her husband is a most devoted pastor, and gives all his 
time and property to the great work which he has embraced, purely for the love of it. My other daughters 
are with me, and my son. Captain Stowe, who has come 
with weakened health through our struggle, suffering 
constantly from the effects of a wound in his head 
received at Gettysburg, which makes his returning to 
his studies a hard struggle. My husband is in better 
health since he resigned his professorship, and desires 
his most sincere regards to yourself and the duke, and 
his profound veneration to your mother. Sister Mary 
also desires to be remembered to you, as do also my 
daughters. Please tell me a little in your next of Lady 
Edith ; she must be very lovely now. 

I am, with sincerest affection, ever yours, 

H. B. Stowe.

to her brother Charles Beecher, in 1866, she says : — 

" My plan of going to Florida, as it hes in my mind, 
is not in any sense a mere worldly enterprise. I have 
for many years had a longing to be more immediately 
doing Christ's work on earth. My heart is with that 
poor people whose cause in words I have tried to plead, 
and who now, ignorant and docile, are just in that formative stagfe in which whoever seizes has them. 

" Corrupt poHticians are already beginning to speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes, and 
to fill their poor heads with all sorts of vagaries. Florida is the State into which they have, more than anywhere else, been pouring. Emigration is positively 
and decidedly setting that way ; but as yet it is mere 
worldly emigration, with the hope of making money, 
nothings more. 

The Episcopal Church is, however, undertaking, 
under direction of the future Bishop of Florida, a wideembracing scheme of Christian activity for the whole 
State. In tliis work I desire to be associated, and my 
plan is to locate at some salient point on the St. John's 
River, where I can form the nucleus of a Christian neigliborliood, whose influence shall be felt far beyond its own limits. 

Duiing this year Mrs. Stowe partially carried her 
plan into execution by hiring- an old plantation called 
" Laurel Grove," on the west side of the St. John's 
River, near the present village of Orange Park. Here 
she established her son Frederick as a cotton planter, 
and here he remained for two years. This location did 
not, however, prove entirely satisfactory, nor did the 
raising of cotton prove to be, under the circumstances, 
a profitable business. After visiting Florida during 
the winter of 1866-67, at which time her attention was 
drawn to the beauties and superior advantages of 
Mandarin on the east side of the river, Mrs. Stowe 
writes from Hartford, May 29, 1867, to Rev. Charles 
Beecher : — 

My dear Brother, — We are now thinking seriously of a place in Mandarin much more beautiful than 
any other in the vicinity. It has on it five large date 
palms, an olive tree in full bearing, besides a fine 
orange grove which this year Avill yield about seventyfive thousand oranges. If we get that, then I want 
you to consider the expediency of buying the one next 
to it. It contains about two hundred acres of land, on 
which is a fine orange grove, the fruit from which last 
year brought in two thousand dollars as sold at the 
wharf. It is right on the river, and four steamboats 
pass it each week, on their way to Savannah and 
Charleston. There is on the place a very comfortable 
cottage, as houses go out there, where they do not need 
to be built as substantially as with us. 

I am now in correspondence with the Bishop of 
Florida, with a view to estabhshing a Hne of churches 
along the St. John's River, and if I settle at Mandarin, 
it will be one of my stations. Will you consent to enter 
the Ejiiscopal Church and be our clergyman ? You are 
just the man we want. If my tasks and feelings did 
not inchne me toward the Church, I should still choose 
it as the best system for training immature minds such 
as those of our negroes. The system was composed 
with reference to the wants of the laborinsr class of 
England, at a tune when they were as ignorant as our 
negroes now are. 

I long to be at this work, and cannot think of it 
without my heart burning within me. Still I leave all 
■with my God, and only hope He will open the way for 
me to do all that I want to for this poor people. 

Affectionately yours, H. B. Stowe.

Dr. 
Oliver Wendell Holmes, called forth by the sending to 
the latter of a volume of Mrs. Stowe's latest stories : — 

Boston, January 8, 1876. 

My dear Mrs. Stowe, — I would not wTite to 
thank you for your most welcome '' Christmas Box," 

" A box whose sweets compacted lie," 

before I had read it, and every word of it. I have been very much taken up with antics of one kind and 
another, and have only finished it this afternoon. The 
last of the papers was of less comparative value to me 
than to a great fraction of your immense parish of 
readers, because I am so familiar with every movement 
of the Pilgrims in their own chronicles. 

" Deacon Pitkin's Farm " is full of those thoroughly 
truthful touches of New England in which, if you are 
not unrivaled, I do not know who your rival may be. 
I wiped the tears from one eye in reading " Deacon 
Pitldn's Farm." 

I wiped the tears, and plenty of them, from both 
eyes, in reading " Betty's Bright Idea." It is a most 
charming and touching story, and nobody can read who 
has not a heart Hke a pebble, mthout being melted into 
tenderness. 

How much you have done and are doing to make 
our New England Kfe wholesome and happy ! If there 
is any one who can look back over a literary life which 
has pictured our old and helped our new civilization, 
it is yourself. Of course your later books have harder 
work cut out for them than those of any other writer. 
They have had " Uncle Tom's Cabin " for a rival. The 
brightest torch casts a shadow in the blaze of a light, 
and any transcendent success affords the easiest handle 
for that class of critics whose method is the one that 
Dogberry held to be " odious." 

I think it grows pleasanter to us to be remembered 
by the friends we still have, as with each year they 
grow fewer. We have lost Agassiz and Sumner from 
our circle, and I found Motley stricken with threatening 
illness (which I hope is gradually yielding to treatment), in the profoiindest grief at the loss of his Avife, another 
old and dear friend of mine. So you may be assured 
that I feel most sensibly your kind attention, and send 
you my heartfelt thanks for remembering me. 

Always, dear Mrs. Stowe, faithfully yours, 

0. W. Holmes.

Mandarin, February 23, 1876. 

Dear Doctor, — How kind it was of you to write 
me that very beautiful note ! and how I wish you were 
just where I am, to see the trees laden at the same time 
with golden oranges and white blossoms ! I should so 
like to cut off a golden cluster, leaves and all, for you. 
Well, Boston seems very far away and dreamy, like 
some previous state of existence, as I sit on the veranda 
and gaze on the receding shores of the St. John's, which 
at this point is five miles wide. 

" Dear doctor, how time slips by ! I remember when Sumner seemed to me a young man, and now he has 
gone. And Wilson has gone, and Chase, whom I knew as a young man in society in Cincinnati, has gone, and 
Stanton has gone, and Seward has gone, and yet how lively the world races on ! A few air-bubbles of praise 
or lamentation, and away sails the great ship of hfe, no matter over whose grave ! 

Well, one cannot but feel it ! To me, also, a whole generation of friends has gone from the other side of 
the water since I was there and broke kindly bread with them. The Duchess of Sutherland, the good old duke, 
Lansdowne, Ellesmere, Lady Byron, Lord and Lady Amberly, Charles Kingsley, tlie good Quaker, Joseph 
Stiirge, all are with the shadowy train that has moved 
on. Among them were as dear and true friends as I 
ever had, and as pure and noble specimens of human 
beings as God ever made. They are Hving somewhere 
in intense vitality, I must believe, and you, dear doctor, 
must not doubt. 

I think about your writings a great deal, and one 
element in them always attracts me. It is their pitiful 
and sympathetic vein, the pity for poor, struggling human nature. In this I feel that you must be very near 
and dear to Him whose name is Love. 

You wrote some verses once that have got into the 
hymn-books, and have often occurred to me in my most 
sacred hours as descriptive of the feelings with which 
I bear the sorrows and carry the cares of life. They 
begin, -^ 

" Love Divine, that stooped to share." 

I have not all your books down here, and am haunted 
by gaps in the verses that memory cannot make good ; 
but it is that " Love Divine " which is my stay and comfort and hojie, as one friend after another passes beyond sight and hearing. Please let me have it in your 
handwriting. 

I remember a remark you once made on spiritualism. 
I cannot recall the words, but you spoke of it as modifying the sharp angles of Calvinistic belief, as a fog 
does those of a landscape. I woidd like to talk with 
you some time on spiritualism, and show you a collection of very curious facts that I have acquired through 
mediums not professional. Mr. Stowe has just been 
wading through eight volumes of " La Mystique," by Goerres, professor for forty years past in the University 
of Munich, first of physiology and latterly of philosophy. He examines the whole cycle of abnormal 
psychic, spiritual facts, trances, ecstasy, clairvoyance, 
witchcraft, spiritualism, etc., etc., as shown in the Romish miracles and the history of Europe. 

I have long: since come to the conclusion that the 
marvels of spirituaHsm are natural, and not supernatural, phenomena, — an uncommon working of natui*al 
laws. I believe that the door between those in the 
body and those out has never in any age been entirely 
closed, and that occasional perceptions within the veil 
are a part of the course of nature, and therefore not 
miraculous. Of course such a phase of human experience is very substantial ground for every kind of imposture and superstition, and I have no faith whatever 
in mediums who practice for money. In their case I 
think the law of Moses, that forbade consulting those 
who dealt with " familiar spirits," a very wise one. 

Do write some more, dear doctor. You are too well 
off in your palace down there on the new land. Your 
Centennial Ballad was a charming little peep ; now 
give us a full-fledged story. Mr. Stowe ' sends his best 
regards, and wishes you would read " Goerres." ^ It is 
in French also, and he thinks the French translation 
better than the German. 

Yours ever truly, H. B. Stowe.

In January, 1879, she wrote from Mandarin to Dr. 
Holmes : — 

Dear Doctor, — I wish I could give to you and 
Mrs. Holmes the exquisite charm of this morning. My 
window is wide open ; it is a lovely, fresh, sunny day, 
and a great orange tree hung with golden balls closes 
the prospect from my window. The tree is about thirty 
feet high, and its leaves fairly glisten in the sunshine. 

I sent " Poganuc People " to you and Mrs. Holmes 
as being among the few Avho know those old days. It 
is an extremely quiet story for these sensational days, 
when heaven and earth seem to be racked for a thrill ; 
but as I get old I do love to think of those quiet, simple 
times when there was not a poor person in the parish, 
and the changing glories of the year were the only spectacle. We, that is the professor and myself, have 
been reading with much interest Motley's Memoir. 
That was a man to be proud of, a beauty, too (by your 
eng-raving). I never had the pleasure of a personal 
acquaintance. 

I feel with you that we have come into the land of 
leave-takmg. Hardly a paper but records the death 
of some of Mr. Stowe's associates. But the river is not 
so black as it seems, and there are clear days when the 
opposite shore is plainly visible, and now and then we 
catch a strain of music, perhaps even a gesture of 
recognition. They are thinking of us, without doubt, 
on the other side. My daughters and I have been 
reading "Elsie Venner " again. Elsie is one of my 
especial friends, — poor, dear child ! — and all your 
theology in that book I subscribe to with both hands. 

Does not the Bible plainly tell us of a time when 
there shall be no more pain ? That is to be the end 
and crown of the Messiah's mission, when God shall 
wipe all tears away. My face is set that way, and yours, 
too, I trust and believe. 

Mr. Stowe sends hearty and affectionate remembrance both to you and Mrs. Holmes, and I am, as ever, 
truly yours, H. B. Stowe.

March 26, 1882, Professor Stowe wrote the following characteristic letter to Mrs. Lewes : — 

Mrs. Lewes, — I fully sympathize with you in your 
disgust with Hume and the professing mediums generally. 

Hume spent his boyhood in my father's native town, 
among my relatives and acquaintances, and he was a disagreeable, nasty boy. But he certainly lias qualities 
which science has not yet explained, and some of his 
doings are as real as they are strange. My interest 
in the subject of spiritualism arises from the fact of my 
own experience, more than sixty years ago, in my early 
childhood. I then never thought of questioning the 
objective reaHty of all I saw, and supposed that everybody else had the same experience. Of what this experience was you may gain some idea from certain passages in " Oldtown Folks." 

The same experiences continue yet, but with serious 
doubts as to the objectivity of the scenes exhibited. 
I have noticed that people who have remarkable and 
minute answers to prayer, such as Stilling, Franke, 
Lavater, are for the most part of this peculiar temperament. Is it absurd to suppose that some peculiarity in 
the nervous system, in the connecting link between soul 
and body, may bring some, more than others, into an 
almost abnormal contact with the spirit - world (for 
example, Jacob Boehme and Swedenborg), and that, 
too, without correcting their faults, or making them 
morally better than others ? Allow me to say that I 
have always admired the working of your mind, there 
is about it such a perfect uprig-htness and uncalculating 
honesty. I think you are a better Christian without 
church or theology than most people are with both, 
though I am, and always have been in the main, a Calvinist of the Jonathan Edwards school. God bless 
you ! I have a warm side for Mr. Lewes on account of 
his Goethe labors. 

Goethe has been my admiration for more than forty 
years. In 1830 I got hold of his " Faust," and for two gloomy, dreary November days, while riding through 
the woods of New Hampshire in an old-fashioned stagecoach, to enter upon a professorship in Dartmouth College, I was perfectly dissolved by it. 

Sincerely yours, C. E. Stowe.

Paris, December 17, 1856. 

Dear Lady Byron, — The Kansas Committee have written me a letter desiring me to express to Miss their gratitude for the five pounds she sent them. I 
am not personally acquainted with her, and must return 
these acknowledgments through you. 

I wrote you a day or two since, inclosing the reply 
of the Kansas Conunittee to you. 

On that subject on which you spoke to me the last 
time we were together, I have thought often and 
deeply. I have changed my mind somewhat. Considering the peculiar circumstances of the case, I could 
wish that the sacred veil of silence, so bravely thrown 
over the past, should never be withdrawn during the 
time that you remain with us. I would say then, leave 
all with some discreet friends, who, after both have 
passed from earth, shall say what was due to justice. 
I am led to think this by seeing how low, how unworthy, the judgments of this world are ; and I Avould 
not that what I so much respect, love, and revere should 
be placed within reach of its harpy claw, which pollutes 
what it touches. The day will yet come which will 
bring to light every hidden thing. " There is nothing 
covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that 
shall not be known ; " and so justice will not fail. 

Such, my dear friend, are my thoughts ; different 
from what they were since first I heard that strange, 
sad history. Meanwhile I love you forever, whether 
we meet again on earth or not. 

Affectionately yours, H. B. S.

Hartford, June 26, i869. 

Dear Doctor, — I am going to ask help of you, 
and I feel that confidence in your friendship that leads 
me to be glad that I have a friend like you to ask 
advice of. In order that you may understand fully 
what it is, I must go back some years and tell you 
about it. 

When I went to England the first time, I formed a 
friendship with Lady Byron which led to a somewhat 
interesting correspondence. When there the second 
time, after the pubhcation of " Dred " in 1856, Lady 
Byron wrote to me that she wished to have some private confidential conversation with me, and invited me 
to come spend a day with her at her country-seat near 
London. I went, met her alone, and spent an afternoon with her. The object of the visit she then 
explained to me. She was in such a state of health 
that she considered she had very little time to live, and 
was engaged in those duties and reviews which every 
thoughtful person finds who is coming deliberately, and 
with their eyes open, to the boundaries of this mortal 
life. 

Lady Bjron, as you must perceive, has all her life 
lived under a weight of slanders and false imputations 
laid upon her by her husband. Her own side of the 
story has been told only to that small circle of confidential friends who needed to know it in order to assist 
her in meeting the exigencies which it imposed on her. 
Of course it has thrown the sympathy mostly on his 
side, since the world generally has more sympathy with 
impulsive incorrectness than with strict justice. 

At that time there was a cheap edition of Byron's works in contemplation, meant to bring them into circulation among- the masses, and the pathos arising from 
the story of his domestic misfortunes was one great 
means relied on for giving it currency. 

Under these circumstances some of Lady Byron's 
friends had proposed the question to her whether she 
had not a resjjonsibility to society for the truth j 
whether she did right to allow these persons to gain 
influence over the popular mind by a silent consent to 
an utter falsehood. As her whole life had been passed 
in the most heroic self-abnegation and self sacrifice, the 
question was now proposed to her whether one more 
act of self-denial was not required of her, namely, to 
declare the truth, no matter at what expense to her 
own feehngs. 

For this purpose she told me she wished to recount 
the whole story to a person in whom she had confidence, — a person of another country, and out of the 
whole sphere of personal and local feelings which 
might be supposed to influence those in the country 
and station in life where the events really happened, — 
in order that I might judge whether anything more was 
required of her in relation to this history. 

The interview had almost the solemnity of a deathbed confession, and Lady Byron told me the history 
which I have embodied in an article to appear in the 
" Atlantic INIonthly." I have been induced to prepare it by the run which the Guiccioli book is having, 
which is from first to last an unsparing attack on 
Lady Byron's memory by Lord Byron's mistress. 

When you have read my article, I want, not your 
advice as to whether the main facts shall be told, for on this point I am so resolved that I frankly say advice 
would do me no good. But you might help me, with 
your deUcacy and insight, to make the tnanner of telling more perfect, and I want to do it as wisely and 
well as such story can be told. 

My post-office address after July 1st will be Westport Point, Bristol Co., Mass., care of Mrs. I. M. 
Soule. The proof-sheets will be sent you by the publisher. Very truly yours, 

H. B. Stowe.

Dear Doctor, — . . . In writing this book, which I 
now take the liberty of sending to you, I have been in 
. . . a " critical place." It has been a strange, weird sort 
of experience, and I have had not a word to say to 
anybody, though often thinking of you and wishing I 
could have a little of your help and sympathy in getting out what I saw. I think of you very much, and 
rejoice to see the hold your works get on England as

<!--BEGIN_LETTER-->

Boston, September 25, 18G9. 

My dear Mrs. Stowe, — I have been meaning to 
write to you for some time, but in the midst of all the 
wild and virulent talk about the article in the " Atlantic," I felt as if there was little to say until the first 
fury of the storm had blown over. 

I think that we all perceive now that the battle is 
not to be foug-ht here, but in En^rland. I have listened 
to a good deal of talk, always taking your side in a 
quiet way, backed very heartily on one occasion by one of my most intellectual friends, reading all that came 
in my way, and watching the course of opinion. And 
first, it was to be expected that the Guiccioli fanciers 
would resent any attack on Lord Byron, and would 
highly relish the opportunity of abusing one who, like 
yoiu'self, had been identified with all those moral enterprises which elevate the standard of humanity at large, 
and of womanhood in particular. After tliis scimi had 
worked itself off, there must necessarily follow a controversy, none the less sharp and bitter, but not depending essentially on abuse. The first point the recusants 
got hold of was the error of the two years which contrived to run the gauntlet of so many pairs of eyes. 
Some of them were made happy by mouthing and 
shaking this between their teeth, as a poodle tears 
round with a glove. This did not last long. No sensible person could believe for a moment you were mistaken in the essential character of a statement every 
word of which would fall on the ear of a listening 
friend like a drop of melted lead, and burn its scar deep 
into the memory. That Lady Byron believed and told 
you the story will not be questioned by any but fools 
and malig-nants. Whether her belief was well founded 
there may be positive evidence in existence to show 
affirmatively. The fact that her statement is not peremptorily contradicted by those most likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case, is the one result 
so far which is forcmg itself into unwilling recognition. I have seen nothing, in the various hypotheses 
brought forward, which did not to me involve a greater 
improbability than the presumption of guilt. Take 
that, for witness, that Byron accused himself, through a sj^iiit of perverse vanity, of crimes he had not committed. How preposterous ! He would stain the name 
of a sister, whom, on the supposition of his innocence, 
he loved with angehc ardor as well as jDurity, by associating it with such an infamous accusation. Suppose 
there are some anomalies hard to explain in Lady 
Byron's conduct. Could a young and guileless woman, 
in the hands of such a man, be expected to act in any 
given way, or would she not be Hkely to waver, to 
doubt, to hope, to contradict herself, in the anomalous 
position in which, without experience, she found herself ? 

As to the intrinsic evidence contained in the poems, 
I think it confirms rather than contradicts the hypothesis of guilt. I do not think that Butler's argument, 
and all the other attempts at invalidation of the story, 
avail much in the face of the acknowledo-ed fact that it 
was told to various competent and honest witnesses, and 
remains without a satisfactory answer from those most 
interested. 

I know your firm self-reliance, and your courage to 
proclaim the truth when any good end is to be served 
by it. It is to be expected that public opinion will be 
more or less divided as to the expediency of this revelation. . . . 

Hoping that you have recovered from your indisposition, I am Faithfully yours, 

0. W. Holmes.

The Priory, 21 North Bank, December 10, 1869. 

My dear Friend, — ... In the midst of your 
trouble I Avas often thinking of you, for I feared that 
you were undergoing a considerable trial from the harsh 
and unfair judgments, partly the fruit of hostility glad 
to find an opportunity for venting itself, and partly of 
that unthinking cruelty which belongs to hasty anonymous journalism. For my own part, I should have preferred that the Byron question should never have been 
brought before the pubhc, because I think the discussion of such subjects is injurious socially. But mth 
regard to yourself, dear friend, I feel sure that, in acting on a different basis of impressions, you were impelled by pure, generous feehng. Do not think that I 
would have written to you of this point to express a 
judgment. I am anxious only to convey to you a sense 
of my sympathy and confidence, such as a kiss and a 
pressure of the hand could give if I were near you. 

I trust that I shall hear a good account of Professor 
Stowe's health, as well as your own, whenever you have 
time to write me a word or two. I shall not be so unreasonable as to expect a long letter, for the hours of 
needful rest from writing become more and more precious as the years go on, but some brief news of you 
and yours will be especially welcome just now. Mr. 
Lewes unites with me in high regards to your husband 
and yourself, but in addition to that I have the sister 
woman's privilege of saying that I am always

The Priory, 21 North Bank, May 8, 1869. 

My dear Friend, — I value very highly the warrant 
to call you friend which your letter has given me. It 
lay awaiting me on our return the other night from a 
nine weeks' absence in Italy, and it made me almost 
wish that you could have a momentary vision of the discouragement, — nay, paralyzing despondency — in which 
many days of my writing life have been passed, in order 
that you might fully understand the good I find in 
such sympathy as yours, in such an assurance as you 
give me that my work has been worth doing. But I 
will not dwell on any mental sickness of mine. The 
best joy your words give me is the sense of that sweet, 
generous feeling in you which dictated them. I shall 
always be the richer because you have in this way made 
me know you better. I must tell you that my first 
glimpse of you as a woman came through a letter of 
yours, and charmed me very much. The letter was addressed to Mrs. FoUen, and one morning I called on 
her in London (how many years ago !) ; she was kind 
enough to read it to me, because it contained a little histor}' of your life, and a sketch of your domestic 
circumstances. I remember thinking that it was very 
kind of you to write that long- letter, in reply to inquiries of one who was personally unknown to you ; 
and, looking back with my present experience, I think 
it was kinder than it then appeared, for at that time 
you must have been much opj)ressed with the inunediate 
results of your fame. I remember, too, that you wrote 
of your husband as one who was richer in Hebrew and 
Greek than in pounds or shillings ; and as an ardent 
scholar has always been a character of peculiar interest 
to me, I have rarely had your image in my mind without the accompanying image (more or less erroneous) of 
such a scholar by your side. I shall welcome the fruit 
of his Goethe studies, whenever it comes. 

I have good hopes that your fears are groundless as 
to the obstacles your new book (" Oldtown Folks ") may 
find here from its thorouofh American character. Most 
readers who are likely to be really influenced by writing 
above the common order will find that special aspect 
an added reason for interest and study ; and I dare say 
you have long seen, as I am beginning to see with new 
clearness, that if a book which has any sort of exquisiteness happens also to be a popular, widely circidated 
book, the power over the social mind for any good is, 
after all, due to its reception by a few appreciative natures, and is the slow result of radiation from that narrow circle. I mean that you can affect a few souls, and 
that each of these in turn may affect a few more, but 
that no extpiisite book tells properly and directly on a 
multitude, however largely it may be spread by type and 
paper. Witness the things the multitude will say about it, if one is so imliappy as to be obliged to hear their 
sayings. I do not write this cynically, but in pure sadness and pity. Both traveling abroad and staying at 
home among our Enghsh sights and sports, one must 
continually feel how slowly the centuries work toward 
the moral good of men, and that thought lies very close 
to what you say as to your wonder or conjecture concerning my religious point of view. I believe that 
religion, too, has to be modified according to the dominant phases ; that a religion more perfect than any yet 
prevalent must express less care of personal consolation, 
and the more deeply awing sense of responsibility to 
man springing from sympathy with that which of all 
things is most certainly known to us, — the difficulty 
of the human lot. Letters are necessarily narrow and 
fragmentary, and when one writes on wide subjects, are 
likely to create more misunderstanding than illumination. But I have little anxiety in writing to you, dear 
friend and fellow-laborer ; for you have had longer 
experience than I as a writer, and fuller experience as 
a woman, since you have borne children and known a 
mother's history from the beginning. I trust your 
quick and long-taught mind as an interpreter little 
liable to mistake me. 

When you say, " We live in an orange grove, and are 
planting many more," and when I think you must have 
abundant family love to cheer you, it seems to me that 
you must have a paradise about you. But no list of 
circumstances will make a paradise. Nevertheless, I 
must believe that the joyous, tender humor of your 
books clings about your more immediate life, and 
makes some of that sunshine for yourself which you have iiiven to us. I see the advertisement of " Oldtown Folks," and shall eagerly expect it. That and 
every other new hiik between us will be reverentially 
valued. With great devotion and regard, 

Yours always, M. L. Lewies.

Mandarin, February 8, 1872. 

Dear Friend, — It is two years nearly since I had 
your last very kind letter, and I have never answered, 
because two years of constant and severe work have 
made it impossible to give a drop to anything beyond 
the needs of the hour. Yet I have always thought of 
you, loved you, trusted you all the same, and read 
every little scrap from your writing that came to hand. 

One thing brings you back to me. I am now in 
Florida in my little hut in the orange orchard, with the 
broad expanse of the blue St. John's in front, and the 
waving of the hve-oaks, with their long, gray mosses, 
overhead, and the bright gold of oranges looking 
through dusky leaves around. It is like Sorrento, — so 
like that I can quite dream of being there. And when 
I get here I enter another life. The world recedes ; I 
am out of it ; it ceases to influence ; its bustle and noise 
die away in the far distance ; and here is no winter, an 
open-air life, — a quaint, rude, wild wilderness sort of 
Hfe, both rude and ricli ; but when I am here I write 
more letters to friends than ever I do elsewhere. The 
mail comes only t^^dce a week, and then is the event of 
the day. My old rabbi and I here set up our tent, he 
with German, and Greek, and Hebrew, devouring all sorts o£ black-letter books, and I spinning ideal webs 
out of bits that lie lets fall here and there. 

I have long thought that I would write you again 
when I got here, and so I do. I have sent North to 
have them send me the " Harper's Weekly," in which 
your new story is appearing, and have promised myself 
leisurely to devour and absorb every word of it. 

While I think of it I want to introduce to you a 
friend of mine, a most noble man, Mr. Owen, for some 
years our ambassador at Naples, now living a literary 
and scholar Hfe in America. His father was Robert 
Dale Owen, the theorist and communist you may have 
heard of in England some years since. 

Years ago, in Naples, I visited Mr. Owen for the 
first time, and found him directing his attention to the 
phenomena of spiritism. He had stumbled upon some 
singular instances of it accidentally, and he had forthwith instituted a series of researches and experiments 
on the subject, some of which he showed me. It was 
the first time I had ever seriously thought of the matter, and he invited my sister and myself to see some of 
the phenomena as exhibited by a medium friend of 
theirs who resided in their family. The result at the 
time was sufficiently curious, but I was interested in his 
account of the manner in which he proceeded, keeping 
records of every experiment with its results, in classified 
orders. As the result of his studies and observations, 
he has published two books, one " Footfalls on the 
Boundary of Another World," published in 1860, and 
latterly, " The Debatable Land Between this World and 
the Next." I reg-ard Mr. Owen as one of the few men 
who are capable of entering into an inquiry of this kind without an utter drowning o£ common sense, and 
his books are both of them worth a fair readino-. To 
me they present a great deal that is intensely curious and 
interesting, although I do not admit, of course, all his 
deductions, and think he often takes too much for 
granted. Still, with every abatement there remains a 
residuum of fact, which I think both curious and useful. 
In a late letter to me he says : — 

" There is no writer of the present day whom I 
more esteem than Mrs. Lewes, nor any one whose opinion of my work I should more highly value." 

I beHeve he intends sending them to you, and I hope 
you will read them. Lest some of the narratives should 
strike you, as such narratives did me once, as being a 
perfect Arabian Nights' Entertainment, I want to say 
that I have accidentally been in the way of confirming 
some of tlie most remarkable by personal observation. 
... In regard to all this class of subjects, I am of the 
opinion of Goethe, that " it is just as absurd to deny 
the facts of spiritualism now as it was in the Middle 
Ages to ascribe them to the Devil." I think Mr. 
Owen attributes too much value to his facts. I do not 
think the things contributed from the ultra-mundane 
sphere are particularly valuable, apart from the evidence they give of continued existence after death. 

I do not think there is yet any evidence to warrant 
the idea that they are a supplement or continuation of 
the revelations of Christianity, but I do regard them as 
an interesting and curious study in psychology, and every 
careful observer like Mr. Owen ou";ht to be welcomed 
to bring in his facts. With this I shall send you my 
observations on Mr. Owen's books, from the " Christian Union." I am perfectly aware of the frivolity and 
wortlilessness of much of the revealings purporting to 
come from spirits. In my view, the worth or worthlessness of them has nothing to do with the question of 
fact. 

Do invisible spirits speak in any wise, — wise or foolish ? — is the question a j^riori. I do not know of any 
reason why there shoidd not be as many foolish virgins 
in the future state as in this. As I am a believer in 
the Bible and Christianity, I don't need these things as 
confirmations, and they are not Kkely to be a rehgion 
to me. I regard them simply as I do the phenomena 
of the Aurora Borealis, or Darwin's studies on natural 
selection, as curious studies into nature. Besides, I 
think some day we shall find a law by which aU these 
facts will fall into their places. 

I hope now this subject does not bore you : it certainly is one that seems increasingly to insist on getting 
itself heard. It is going on and on, making converts, 
who are many more than dare avow themselves, and 
for my part I wish it were all brought into the daylight 
of inquiry. 

Let me hear from you if ever you feel like it. I know 
too well the possibilities and impossibilities of a nature 
like yours to ask more, but it can do you no harm to 
know that I still think of you and love you as ever. 
Faithfully yours, H. B. Stowe.

The Priory, 21 North Bank, Regent's Park, March 4, 1872. 

Dear Friend, — I can understand very easily that 
the two last years have been full for you of other and 
more imperative work than the writing of letters not absolutely demanded either by charity or business. 
The proof that you still think of me affectionately is 
very welcome now it has come, and more cheering because it enables me to think of you as enjoying your 
retreat in your orange orchard, — your western Sorrento 
— the beloved rabbi still beside you. I am sure it 
must be a great blessing to you to bathe in that quietude, as it always is to us when we go out of reach of 
London influences and have the large space of country 
days to study, walk, and talk in. . . . 

When I am more at hberty I will certainly read Mr. 
Owen's books, if he is good enough to send them to 
me. I desh'e on all subjects to keep an open mind, but 
hitherto the various phenomena, reported or attested in 
connection with ideas of spirit intercourse and so on, 
have come before me here in the painful form of the 
lowest charlatanerie. . . . 

But apart from personal contact with people who get 
money by public exliibitions as mediums, or with semiidiots such as those who make a court for a Mrs. -----, 

or other feminine personages of that kind, I would not 
willingly place any barriers between my mind and any 
possible channel of truth affecting the human lot. The 
spirit in which you have written in the paper you kindly 
sent me is likely to touch others, and arouse them at 
least to attention in a case where you have been deeply 
impressed. . . . 

Yours with sincere affection, 

M. L. Lewes.

(Begnn April 4th.) 

Mandarin, Florida, May 11, 1872. 

My dear Friend^ — I was very glad to get your 
dear little note, — sorry to see by it that you are not in 
your full physical force. Owing to the awkwardness 
and misunderstanding of publishers, I am not reading 
" Middlemarch," as I expected to be, here in these 
orange shades: they don't send it, and I am too far 
out of the world to get it. I felt, when I read your 
letters, how glad I should be to have you here in our 
Florida cottage, in the wholly new, wild, woodland life. 
Though resembling Italy in climate, it is wholly different in the appearance of nature, — the plants, the 
birds, the animals, all different. The green tidiness 
and culture of England here gives way to a wild and 
rugged savageness of beauty. Every tree bursts forth 
with flowers ; wild vines and creepers execute delirious 
gambols, and weave and interweave in intermmable 
labyrinths. Yet here, in the great sandy plains back 
of our house, there is a constant wondering sense of 
beauty in the wild, wonderful growths of nature. First 
of all, the pines — high as the stone pines of Italy — 
with long leaves, eighteen inches long, through which 
there is a constant dreamy sound, as if of dashing 
waters. Then the live-oaks and the water-oaks, narrow-leaved evergreens, which grow to enormous size, 
and whose branches are draped with long festoons of 
the gray moss. There is a great, wild park of these 
trees back of us, which, with the dazzling, varnished 
green of the new spring leaves and the swaying drapery 
of moss, looks like a sort of enchanted grotto. Underneath grow up hollies and ornamental flowering shrubs, and the yellow jessamine climbs into and over 
everything with fragrant golden bells and buds, so that 
sometimes the fohage of a tree is wholly hidden in its 
embrace. 

This wild, wonderful, bright and vivid growth, that 
is aU new, strange, and unknown by name to me, has 
a charm for me. It is the place to forget the outside 
world, and Hve in one's self. And if you were here, 
we would go together and gather azaleas, and white 
lihes, and silver bells, and blue ii'is. These flowers keep 
me painting in a sort of madness. I have just finished 
a picture of white lilies that grow in the moist land by 
the watercourses. I am lonoino* to beain on blue iris. 
Artist, poet, as you are by nature, you ought to see all 
these things, and if you would come here 1 would take 
you in heart and house, and you should have a little 
room in our cottage. The history of the cottage is this : 
I found a hut built close to a great live-oak twentyfive feet in girth, and with overarching boughs eighty 
feet up in the air, sin-eading like a firmament, and all 
swaying with mossy festoons. We began to live here, 
and gradually we improved the hut by lath, plaster, and 
paper. Then we threw out a wide veranda all round, 
for in these regions the veranda is the living-room of 
the house. Ours had to be built around the trunk of 
the tree, so that our cottage has a peculiar and original 
air, and seems as if it were half tree, or a something that 
had grown out of the tree. We added on parts, and 
have thrown out gables and chambers, as a tree throws 
out new branches, till our cottage is Hke nobody else's, 
and yet we settle into it with real enjoyment. There 
are all sorts of queer httle rooms in it, and we are accommodating at tliis present a family of seventeen 
souls. In front, the beautiful, grand St. John's stretches 
five miles from shore to shore, and we watch the steamboats plying back and forth to the great world we are 
out of. On all sides, large orange trees, with their 
dense shade and ever-vivid green, shut out the sun so 
that we can sit, and walk, and live in the open air. 
Our winter here is only cool, bracing out-door weather, 
without snow. No month without flowers blooming in 
the open air, and lettuce and peas in the garden. The 
summer range is about 90°, but the sea-breezes keep 
the air dehghtfuUy fresh. Generally we go North, 
however, for three months of summer. Well, I did not 
mean to run on about Florida, but the subject runs 
away with me, and I want you to visit us m spii'it if 
not personally. 

My poor rabbi ! — he sends you some Arabic, which 
I fear you cannot read : on diablerie he is up to his 
ears in knowledge, having read all things in all tongues, 
from the Talmud down. . . . 

Ever lovingly yours, H. B. Stowe.

Boston, September 26, 1872. 

My dear Friend, — I think when you see my name 
again so soon, you will think it rains, hails, and snows 
notes from tliis quarter. Just now, however, I am in 
this lovely, little nest in Boston, where dear Mrs. Field, 
like a dove, " sits brooding on the charmed wave." We 
are both wishing we had you here with us, and she has 
not received any answer from you as yet in reply to 
the invitation you spoke of in your last lettef to me. 
It seems as if you must have written, and the letter someliow gone astray, because I know, of course, you 
would write. Yesterday we were both out of our senses 
with mingled pity and indignation at that dreadful 
stick of a Casaubon, — and think of poor Dorothea 
dashing like a warm, sunny wave against so cold and 
repulsive a rock ! He is a httle too dreadful for anything : there does not seem to be a drop of warm blood 
in him, and so, as it is his misfortune and not his fault, 
to be cold-blooded, one must not get angry with him. 
It is the scene in the garden, after the interview with 
the doctor, that rests on our mind at this present. 
There was such a man as he over in Boston, high in 
literary circles, but I fancy his wife was n't Hke Dorothea, and a vastly proper time they had of it, treating 
each other with mutual reverence, like two Chinese 
mandarins. 

My love, what I miss in this story is just what we 
would have if you would come to our tumble-down, 
jolly, improper, but joyous country, — namely, " joUitude." You write and live on so high a plane ! ' It is 
all self-abnegation. We want to get you over here, 
and into this house, where, with closed doors, we sometimes make the rafters ring with fun, and say anything 
and everything, no matter what, and won't be any 
properer than we 's a mind to be. I am wishing every 
day you could see our America, — travel, as I have been 
doing, from one bright, tliriving, pretty, flowery town 
to another, and see so much wealth, ease, progress, culture, and all sorts of nice things. This dovecot where 
I now am is the sweetest little nest imaginable ; fronting on a city street, with back windows opening on a 
sea view, with still, quiet rooms filled with books, pictures, and all sorts of things, such as you and Mr. Lewes 
would enjoy. Don't be afraid of the ocean, now ! I 've 
crossed it six times, and assure you it is an overrated 
item. Froude is coming here — why not you ? Besides, we have the fountain of eternal youth here, that 
is, in Florida, where I live, and if you should come you 
would both of you take a new lease of Hfe, and what 
glorious poems, and philosophies, and whatnot, we 
should have 1 My rabbi writes, in the seventh heaven, 
an account of your note to him. To think of his setting-off on his own account when I was away! 

Come now, since your answer to dear Mrs. Fields is 
yet to come ; let it be a glad yes, and we will clasp you 
to our heart of hearts. 

Your ever loving, H. B. S.

Orange-blossom time, Mandarin, March 18, 187G. 

My dear Friend, — I always think of you when 
the orange trees are in blossom ; just now they are 
fuller than ever, and so many bees are filling the 
branches that the air is full of a sort of still murmur. 
And now I am beginning to hear from you every 
month in Harper's. It is as good as a letter. " Daniel 
Deronda " has succeeded in awaking in my somewhat 
w^orn-out mind an interest. So many stories are tramping over one's mind in every modern mag-azine nowadays that one is macadamized, so to speak. It takes 
something unusual to make a sensation. This does excite and interest me, as I wait for each number with 
eagerness. I wish I could endow you with our long 
winter weather, — not winter, except such as you find 
in Sicily. We Hve here from November to June, and 
my husband sits outdoors on the veranda and reads 
all day. We emigrate in solid family : my two dear 
daughters, husband, self, and servants come together 
to spend the winter here, and so together to our Northern home in summer. My twin daughters relieve me 
from all domestic care ; they are lively, vivacious, with a 
real genius for practical life. We have around us a little settlement of neighbors, who like ourselves have a 
winter home here, and live an easy, undress, picnic kind 
of life, far from the world and its cares. Mr. Stowe 
has been busy on eight volumes of Gorres on the mysticism of the Middle Ages.^ This Gorres was Professor 
of Philosophy at Munich, and he reviews the whole 
ground of the shadow-land between the natural and 
the supernatural, — ecstacy, trance, prophecy, miracles, 
spiritualism, the stigmata, etc. He was a devout Roman 
Catholic, and the so-called facts that he reasons on 
seem to me quite amazing ; and yet the possibilities that 
lie between inert matter and man's living, all-powerful, « 
immortal soul may make almost anything credible. 
The soul at times can do anything with matter. I 
have been busying myself with Sainte-Beuve's seven 
volumes on the Port Royal development. I like him 
(Sainte-Beuve). His capacity of seeing, doing justice to 
all kinds of natures and sentiments, is wonderful. I am 
sorry he is no longer our side the veil. 

There is a redbird (cardinal grosbeak) singing in the orange trees fronting* my window, so sweetly and 
insistently as to almost stop my writing. I hope, dear 
friend, you are well — better than when you wrote last. 

It was very sweet and kind of you to write what you 
did last. I suppose it is so long ago you may have forgotten, but it was a word of tenderness and sympathy 
about my brother's trial ; it was womanly, tender, and 
sweet, such as at heart you are. After all, my love of 
you is greater than my admiration, for I think it more 
and better to be really a woman worth loving than to 
have read Greek and German and written books. And 
in this last book I read, I feel more with you in some 
little, fine points, — they stare at me as making an 
anuising exhibition. For, my dear, I feel myself at 
last as one who has been playing and picnicking on the 
shores of life, and waked from a dream late in the 
afternoon to find that everybody almost has gone over 
to the beyond. And the rest are sorting their things 
and packing their trunks, and waiting for the boat to 
come and take them. 

It seems now but a little time since my brother 
Henry and I were two young people together. He 
was my two years junior, and nearest companion out of 
seven brothers and three sisters. I taught him drawing and heard his Latin lessons, for you know a girl 
becomes mature and womanly long before a boy. I 
saw him through college, and helped him through the 
difficult love affair that gave him his wife ; and then he 
and my husband had a real German, enthusiastic love 
for each other, which ended in making me a wife. 
Ah ! in those days we never dreamed that he, or I, or 
any of us, were to be known in the world. All he seemed then was a boy full of fun, full of love, full of 
enthusiasm for protecting abused and righting wronged 
people, which made him in those early days write editorials, and wear arms and swear himself a special 
policeman to 'protect the poor negroes in Cincinnati, 
where we then Hved, when there were mobs instigated 
by the slaveholders of Kentucky. 

Then he married, and lived a missionary life in the 
new West, all with a joyousness, an enthusiasm, a chivalry, which made life bright and vigorous to us both. 
Then in time he was called to Brooklyn, just as the 
crisis of the great anti-slavery battle came on, and the 
Fugitive Slave Law was passed. I was then in Maine, 
and I well remember one snowy night his riding till 
midnight to see me, and then our talking, till near 
morning, what we could do to make headway against 
the horrid cruelties that were being practiced against 
the defenseless blacks. My husband was then away 
lecturing, and my heart was burning itself out in indignation and anguish. Henry told me then that he 
meant to fight that battle in New York ; that he would 
have a church that would stand by him to resist the 
tyrannic dictation of Southern slaveholders. I said : " I, 
too, have begun to do something ; I have begun a story, 
trying to set forth the sufferings and wrongs of the 
slaves." " That 's right, Hattie," he said ; " finish it, 
and I will scatter it thick as the leaves of Vallambrosa," 
and so came " Uncle Tom," and Plymouth Church became a stronghold where the slave always found refuge 
and a strong helper. One morning my brother found 
sitting on his doorstep poor old Paul Edmonson, weeping ; his two daughters, of sixteen and eighteen, had passed into the slave warehouse of Bruin &amp; Hill, and 
were to be sold. My brother took the man by the 
hand to a public meeting, told his story for him, and in 
an hour raised the two thousand dollars to redeem his 
children. Over and over again, afterwards, slaves were 
redeemed at Plymouth Church, and Henry and Plymouth Church became words of hatred and fear through 
half the Union. From that time until we talked together about the Fugitive Slave Law, there was not a 
pause or stop in the battle till we had been through the 
war and slavery had been wiped out in blood. Through 
all he has been pouring himself out, wrestling, burning, 
laboring everywhere, making stump speeches when 
elections turned on the slave question, and ever maintaining: that the cause of Christ was the cause of the 
slave. And when all was over, it was he and Lloyd 
Garrison who were sent by government once more to 
raise our national flag on Fort Sumter. You must 
see that a man does not so energize without making 
many enemies. Half of our Union has been defeated, 
a property of millions annihilated by emancipation, a 
proud and powerful slave aristocracy reduced to beggary, and there are those who never saw our faces that, 
to this hour, hate him and me. Then he has been a 
progressive in theology. He has been a student of 
Huxley, and Spencer, and Darwin, — enough to alarm 
the old school, — and yet remained so ardent a supernaturalist as equally to repel the radical destructionists in 
religion. He and I are Christ- worshippers, adoring 
Him as the Ima&lt;re of the Livisible God and all that 
comes from believinj]: this. Then he has been a reformer, an advocate of universal suffrage and woman's rig-hts, yet not radical enough to please that reform 
party who stand where the Socialists of France do, and 
are for tearing up all creation generally. Lastly, 
he has had the misfortune of a popularity which is perfectly phenomenal. I cannot give you any idea of the 
love, worship, idolatry, with which he has been overwhelmed. He has something magnetic about him that 
makes everybody crave his society, — that makes men 
follow and worship him. I remember being at his 
house one evening in the time of early flowers, and in 
that one evening came a box of flowers from Maine, 
another from New Jersey, another from Connecticut, — 
all from people with whom he had no personal acquaintance, who had read something of his and wanted to 
send him some token. I said, " One would think you 
were a prima donna. What does make people go on so 
about you? " 

My brother is hopelessly generous and confiding. 
His inability to believe evil is something incredible, 
and so has come all this suffering. You said you 
hoped I should be at rest when the first investigating 
committee and Plymouth Church cleared my brother 
almost by acclamation. Not so. The enemy have so 
committed themselves that either they or he must die, 
and there has followed two years of the most dreadful 
struggle. First, a legal trial of six months, the expenses of which on his side were one hundred and 
eighteen thousand dollars, and in which he and his 
brave wife sat side by side in the court-room, and heard 
all that these plotters, who had been weaving their webs 
for three years, could bring. The foreman of the jury 
was offered a bribe of ten thousand dollars to decide against my brother. He sent the letter containing the 
proposition to the judge. But with all their plotting, 
three fourths of the jury decided against them, and 
their case was lost. It was accepted as a triumph by 
my brother's friends ; a large number of the most influential clergy of all denominations so expressed themselves in a public letter, and it was hoped the thing 
was so far over that it miolit be lived down and overgi-own with better things. 

But the enemy, intriguing secretly Avith all those parties in the community who wdsh to put down a public 
and too successful man, have been struo-o'linof- to 
bring the thing up again for an ecclesiastical trial. The 
cry has been raised in various religious papers that 
Plymouth Church was in complicity with crime, — that 
they were so captivated with eloquence and genius 
that they refused to make competent investigation. 
The six months' lesfal investiiration was insufficient ; a 
new trial was needed. Plymouth Church immediately 
called a council of ministers and laymen, in number 
representing thirty - seven thousand Congregational 
Christians, to whom Plymouth Church surrendered her 
records, — her conduct, — all the facts of the case, and 
this great council unanimously supported the church 
and ratified her decision ; recognizing the fact that, in 
all the investigations hitherto, nothing had been proved 
against my brother. They at his request, and that of 
Plymouth Church, appointed a committee of five to 
Avliom within sixty days any one should bring any facts 
that they could prove, or else forever after hold their 
peace. It is thought now by my brother's friends that 
this thing must finally reach a close. But you see why I have not written. This has drawn on my life — my 
heart's blood. He is myself ; I know you are the 
kind of woman to understand me when I say that I 
felt a blow at him more than at myself. I, who know 
his purity, honor, delicacy, know that he has been 
from cliildhood of an ideal purity, — who reverenced 
his conscience as his king, whose glory was redressing 
human wrong, who spake no slander, no, nor listened 
to it. 

Never have I known a nature of such strength, and 
such almost childlike innocence. He is of a nature so 
sweet and perfect that, though I have seen him thunderously indignant at moments, I never saw him fretful 
or irritable, — a man who continuously, in every Httle 
act of hfe, is thinking of others, a man that all the children on the street run after, and that every sorrowful, 
weak, or distressed person looks to as a natural lielj)er. 
In all this long history there has been no circumstance 
of his relation to any woman that has not been worthy 
of himself, — pure, delicate, and proper ; and I know all 
sides of it, and certainly should not say this if there 
were even a misgiving. Thank God, there is none, and 
I can read my New Testament and feel that by all the 
beatitudes my brother is blessed. 

His calmness, serenity, and cheerfulness through all 
this time has uplifted us all. Where he was, there was 
no anxiety, no sorrow. My brother's power to console 
is something peculiar and wonderful. I have seen him 
at death-beds and funerals, where it would seem as if 
hope herself must be dumb, bring down the very peace 
of Heaven and change despair to trust. He has not 
had less power in his own adversity. You cannot conceive how he is beloved, by those even who never saw 
hyn, — old, paralytic, distressed, neglected people, poor 
seamstresses, black people, who have felt these arrows 
shot against their benefactor as against themselves, and 
most touching have been their letters of sympathy. 
From the first, he has met this in the spirit of Francis 
de Sales, who met a similar plot, — by silence, prayer, 
and work, and when urged to defend himself said " God 
would do it in his time." God was the best judge how 
much reputation he needed to serve Him with. 

In your portrait of Deronda, you speak of him as 
one of those rare natures in whom a private wrong 
bred no bitterness. " The sense of injury breeds, not the 
will to inflict injuries, but a hatred of all injury ; " and 
I must say, through all this conflict my brother has been 
always in the spirit of Him who touched and healed 
the ear of Malchus when he himself was attacked. 
His friends and lawyers have sometimes been aroused 
and sometimes indignant with his habitual caring for 
others, and his habit of vindicating and extending even 
to his enemies every scrap and shred of justice that 
might belong to them. From first to last of this trial, 
he has never for a day intermitted his regular work. 
Preaching to crowded houses, preaching even in his 
short vacations at watering places, carrying on his missions which have resfenerated two once wretched districts of the city, editing a paper, and in short giving 
himself up to work. He cautioned his church not to 
become absorbed in him and his trials, to prove their 
devotion by more faithful church work and a wider 
charity ; and never have the Plymouth missions among 
the poor been so energetic and effective. He said recently, " The worst that can befall a man is to stop 
thmking of God and begin to think of himself ; if 
trials make us self-absorbed, they hurt us." Well, dear, 
pardon me for this outpour. I loved you — I love you 
— and therefore wanted you to know just what I felt. 
Now, dear, tliis is over, don't think you must reply to it 
or me. I know how much you have to do, — yes, I 
know all about an aching head and an overtaxed brain. 
This last work of yours is to be your best, I tliink, and 
I hope it will bring you enough to buy an orange grove 
in Sicily, or somewhere else, and so have lovely weather 
such as we have. 

Your ancient admirer,^ who usually goes to bed at 
eight o'clock, was convicted by me of sitting up after 
eleven over the last installment of "Daniel Deronda," and 
he is full of it. We think well of Guendoline, and that 
she is n't much more than young ladies in general so far. 

Next year, if I can possibly do it, I will send you 
some of our oranges. I perfectly long to have you 
enjoy them. 

Your very loving H. B. Stowe. 

P. S. I am afraid I shall write you again when I am 
reading your writings, they are so provokingiy suggestive of things one wants to say. H. B. S.

The Priory, 21 North Bank, April 10, 1879. 

My dear Friend, — I have been long -without sending you any sign (unless you have received a message 
from me through Mrs. Fields), but my heart has been 
going out to you and your husband continually as 
among the chief of the many kind beings who have 
given me their tender fellow-feeling in my last earthly 
sorrow. . . . When your fii-st letter came, with the beautiful gift of yoiu- book,^ I was unable to read any letters, 
and did not for a long time see what you had sent me. 
But when I did know, and had read your words of 
thankfulness at the great good you have seen wrought 
by your help, I felt glad, for your sake first, and then 
for the sake of the great nation to which you belong. 
The hopes of the world are taking refuge westward, 
under the calamitous conditions, moral and physical, in 
wdiifh we of the elder world are getting involved. . . . 

Thank you for telling me that you have the comfort 
of seeing your son in a path that satisfies your best 
wishes for him. I like to think of your having family 
joys. One of the prettiest photographs of a child that 
I possess is one of your sending to me. . . . 

Please offer my reverential, affectionate regards to 
your husband, and believe me, dear friend. 

Yours always gratefully, 

M. L. Lewes.

From Fitchburg, Mass., under date of October 29th, 
she writes : — 

" In the cars, near Palmer, who should I discover 
but Mr. and Mrs. J. T. Fields, returning from a Western trip, as gay as a troubadour. I took an empty 
seat next to them, and we had a jolly ride to Boston. 
I drove to Mr. Williams's house, where I met the Chelsea 
agent, who informed me that there was no hotel in 
Chelsea, but that they were expecting to send over for 
me. So I turned at once toward 148 Charles Street, 
where I tumbled in on the Fields before they had got 
their things off. We had a good laugh, and I received 
a hearty welcome. I was quickly installed in my room, 
where, after a nice dinner, I curled up for my afternoon nap. At half -past seven the carriage came for 
me, and I was informed that I should not have a hard 
reading, as they had engaged singers to take part. So, 
when I got into the carriage, who should I find, beshawled, and beflowered, and betoggled in blue satin and white lace, but our old friend of Andover 

concert memory, now become Madame Thingumbob, of 
European celebrity. She had studied in Italy, come 
out in Milan, simg there in opera for a whole winter, 
and also in Paris and London. 

" Well, she sings very sweetly and looks very nice 
and pretty. Then we had a little rosebud of a Chelsea 
girl who sang, and a pianist. I read ' Minister's Housekeeper ' and Topsy, and the audience was very jolly 
and appreciative. Then we all jogged home."

The next letter finds Mrs. Stowe in JNIaine, and writing in the cars between Bangor and Portland. She 
says : — 

My dear Husband, — Well, Portland and Bangor 
are over, and the latter, which I had dreaded as lonesome and far off, turned out the pleasantest of any place 
I have visited yet. I stayed at the Fays ; he was one 
of the Andover students, you remember ; and found a 
warm, cosy, social home. In the evening I met an 
appreciative audience, and had a delightful reading. 
I read Captain Kittridge, apparently to the great satisfaction of the people, who laughed heartily at his sea 
stories, and the " Minister's Housekeeper " with the 
usual success, also Eva and Topsy. 

One woman, totally deaf, came to me afterwards and 
said : " Bless you. I come jlst to see you. I 'd rather 
see you than the Queen." Another introduced her little girl named Harriet Beecher Stowe, and another, 
older, named Eva. She said they had traveled fifty 
miles to hear me read. An incident like that appeals 
to one's heart, does it not ? 

The people of Bangor were greatly embarrassed by 
the horse disease ; but the mayor and his wife walked 
over from their house, a long distance off, to bring me 
flowers, and at the reading he introduced me. I had an 
excellent audience notwithstanding that it rained tremendously, and everybody had to walk because there 
were no horses. The professors called on me, also 
Ne^^^nan Smith, now a settled minister here. 

Everybody is so anxious about you, and Mr. Fay 
made me promise that you and I should come and 
spend a week with them next summer. Mr. Howard, 
in Portland, called upon me to inquire for you, and 
everybody was so delighted to hear that you were getting better. 

It stormed all the time I was in Portland and Bangor, so I saw nothing of them. Now I am in a palace 
car riding alongside the Kennebec, and recalling the 
incidents of my trip. I certainly had very satisfactory 
houses ; and these pleasant little visits, and meetings 
with old acquaintance, would be well worth having, 
even though I had made nothing in a pecuniary sense. 
On the whole it is as easy a way of making money as 
I have ever tried, though no way of making money is 
perfectly easy, — there must be some disagreeables. 
The lonesomeness of being at a hotel in dull weather is 
one, and in Portland it seems there is nobody now to 
invite us to their homes. Our old friends there are 
among the past. They have gone on over the river. 
I send you a bit of poetry that pleases me. The love 
of the old for each other has its poetry. It is something sacred and full of riches. I long to be with you, 
and to have some more of our good long talks. 

The scenery along this river is very fine. The oaks 
still keep their leaves, though the other trees are bare ; 
but oaks and pines make a pleasant contrast. We 
shall stop twenty minutes at Brunswick, so I shall get 
a glimpse of the old place. 

Now we are passing through Hallowell, and the 
Kennebec changes sides. What a beautiful river ! It 
is now full of logs and rafts. Well, I must bring this 
to a close. Good-by, dear, with unchanging love. Ever 
your wife.

From South Framingham, Mass., she writes on November 7th : — 

Well, my dear, here I am in E.'s pretty little house. 
He has a pretty wife, a pretty sister, a pretty baby, two 
nice Kttle boys, and a lovely white cat. The last is a 
perfect beauty ! a Persian, from a stock brought over 
by Dr. Parker, as white as snow, with the softest fur, a 
perfect bunch of loving-kindness, all purr and felicity. 
I had a good audience last evening, and enjoyed it. 
My audiences, considering the horse disease and the 
rains, are amazing. And how they do laugh ! We get 
mto regular gales. 

E. has the real country minister turn-out : horse and 
buggy, and such a nice horse too. The baby is a 
beauty, and giggles, and goos, and shouts inquiries 
with the rising inflection, in the most inspiring manner. 

November 13. Wakefield. I read in Haverhill 
last night. It was as usual stormy. I had a good 
audience, but not springy and inspiriting like that at 
Waltham. Some audiences seem to put spring into one, and some to take it out. This one seemed good 
but heavy. I had to lift them, while in Framingham 
and Waltham they lifted me. 

The Lord bless and keep you. It grieves me to think 
you are dull and I not with you. By and by we will 
be together and stay together. Good-by dear. Your 
ever loving wife, H. B. S.

JSfovemher 24. "I had a very pleasant reading in 
Peabody. While there visited the library and saw the 
picture of the Queen that she had painted expressly 
for George Peabody. It was about six inches square, 
enameled on gold, and set in a massive frame of solid 
gold and velvet. The effect is like pamting on ivory. 
At night the picture rolls back into a safe, and great 
doors, closed with a combination lock, defend it. It 
reminded me of some of the foreign wonders we have 
seen. 

" Well, my course is almost done, and if I get 
through without any sickness, cold, or accident, how 
wonderful it will seem. I have never felt the near, 
kind presence of our Heavenly Father so much as in 
this. ^ He giveth strength to the faint, and to them of 
no might He increaseth strength.' I have found this 
true all my life."

From Newport she writes on November 26th : — 

" It was a hard, tiring, disagreeable piece of business 
to read in New London. Had to wait three mortal 
hours in Palmer. Then a slow, weary train, that did 
not reach New London until after dark. There was 
then no time to rest, and I was so tired that it did seem 
as though I could not dress. I really trembled with fatigue. The hall was long and dimly lighted, and 
the people were not seated compactly, but around in 
patches. The light was dim, except for a great flaring 
gas jet arranged right under my eyes on the reading 
desk, and I did not see a creature whom I knew. I 
was only too glad when it was over and I was back 
again at my hotel. There I found that I must be up 
at five o'clock to catch the Newport train. 

" I started for this place in the dusk of a dreary, 
foggy morning. Traveled first on a ferry, then in 
cars, and then in a Uttle cold steamboat. Found no 
one to meet me, in spite of all my w^riting, and so took 
a carriage and came to the hotel. The landlord was 
very pohte to me, said he knew me by my trunk, had 
been to our place in Mandarin, etc. All 1 wanted was 
a warm room, a good bed, and unlimited time to sleep. 
Now I have had a three hours' nap, and here I am, sitting by myself in the great, lonely hotel parlor. 

" Well, dear old man, I think lots of you, and only 
want to end all this in a quiet home where we can sing 
^ John Anderson, my Jo ' together. I check off place 
after place as the captive the days of his imprisonment. Only two more after to-night. Ever your loving wife."

Mrs. Stowe made one more readinjT tour the following year, and this time it was in the West. On October 28, 1873, she writes from Zanesville, Ohio, to her 
son at Harvard : — 

You have been very good to write as often as you 
have, and your letters, meeting me at different j)oints, 
have been most cheering. I have been tired, almost to the last desfree. Read two successive evenin2"s in 
Chicago, and traveled the following day for thirteen 
hours, a distance of about three hundred miles, to Cincinnati. We were compelled to go in the most uncomfortable cars I ever saw, crowded to overflowing, a 
fiend of a stove at each end burning up all the air, and 
without a chance to even lay my head down. This is 
the grand route between Chicago and Cincinnati, and 
we were on it from eight in the morning until nearly 
ten at night. 

Arrived at Cincinnati we found that George Beecher 
had not received our telegram, was not expecting us, 
had no rooms engaged for us, and that we could not 
get rooms at his boarding-place. After finding all this 
out we had to go to the hotel, where, about eleven 
o'clock, I crept into bed with every nerve aching from 
fatigue. The next day was dark and rainy, and I lay 
in bed most of it ; but when I got up to go and read 
I felt only half rested, and was still so tired that it 
seemed as though I could not get through. 

Those who planned my engagements failed to take 
into account the fearful distances and wretched trains 
out here. On none of these great Western routes is 
there a drawing-room car. Mr. Saunders tried in every 
way to get them to put one on for us, but in vain. 
They are all reserved for the night trains ; so that there 
is no choice except to travel by night in sleeping cars, 
or take such trains as I have described in the daytime. 

I had a most sympathetic audience in Cincinnati ; 
they all seemed delighted and begged me to come 
again. The next day George took us for a drive out 
to Walnut Hills, where we saw the seminary buildings, the house where your sisters were born, and the house 
in which we afterwards lived. In the afternoon we had 
to leave and hui-ry away to a reading- in Dayton. The 
next evening another in Columbus, where we spent 
Sunday with an old friend. 

By this time I am somewhat rested from the strain 
of that awful joiu-ney ; but I shall never again undertake such another. It was one of those thincfs that 
have to be done once, to learn not to do it again. My 
only reading between Columbus and Pittsburgh is to be 
here in Zanesville, a town as black as Acheron, and 
where one might expect to see the river Styx. 

Later. I had a nice audience and a pleasant reading here, and to-day we go on to Pittsburgh, where I 
read to-morrow niaht. 

I met the other day at Dayton a woman who now 
has grandchildren ; but who, when I first came West, 
was a gay rattling girl. She was one of the first converts of brother George's seemingly obscure ministry 
in the little new town of Chillicothe. Now she has one 
son who is a judge of the supreme court, and another 
in business. Both she and they are not only Christians, but Christians of the primitive sort, whose religion is their all ; who triumph and glory in tribulation, knowing that it worketh patience. She told me, 
with a bright sweet calm, of her husband killed in battle the first year of the war, of her only daughter and 
two grandchildren dying in the faith, and of her own 
happy waiting on God's will, with bright hopes of a 
joyful reunion. Iler sons are leading members of the 
Presbyterian Church, and most active in stirring uj) 
others to make their profession a reality, not an empty name. When I thought that all this came from the 
conversion of one giddy girl, when George seemed to 
be doing so little, I said, " Who can measure the work 
of a faithful minister ? " It is such living witnesses 
that maintain Christianity on earth. 

Good-by. We shall soon be home now, and preparing for Florida. Always your own loving mother, 

H. B. S.

September 30, 1880. 

My dear Charley, — My mind has been with you 
a great deal lately. I have been looking over and 
arranging my papers with a view to sifting out those 
that are not worth keeping, and so filing and arranging 
those that are to be kept, that my heirs and assigns 
may with the less trouble know where and what they 
are. I cannot describe (to you) the peculiar feelings 
which this review occasions. Reading old letters — 
when so many of the writers are gone from earth, 
seems to me like going into the world of spirits — letters full of the warm, eager, anxious, busy life, that 
is forever past. My own letters, too, full of by-gone 
scenes in my early life and the childish days of my 
children. It is affecting: to me to recall thinirs that 
strongly moved me years ago, that filled my thoughts 
and made me anxious when the occasion and emotion 
have wholly vanished from my mind. But I thank 
God there is one thing running through all of them 
from the time I was thirteen years old, and that is the 
intense unwavering sense of Christ's educating, guiding presence and care. It is all that remains now. 

The romance of my youth is faded, it looks to me now, from my years, so very young- — those days when my 
mind only lived in emotion, and when my letters never were dated, because they were only histories of the inte7'nal, but now that I am no more and never can be young in this world, now that the friends of those 
days are almost all in eternity, what remains ? 

Through life and through death, through sorrowiug, through siuning, Christ shall suffice me as he hath sufficed. 
Christ is the end and Christ the beginning, The beginning and end of all is Christ. 

I was passionate in my attachments in those far back years, and as I have looked over files of old letters, 
they are all gone (except one, C. Van Rensselaer), Georgiana May, Delia Bacon, Clarissa Treat, Elisabeth 
Lyman, Sarah Colt, Elisabeth Phenix, Frances Strong, Elisabeth Foster. I have letters from them all, but 
they have been long in spirit land and know more about how it is there than I do. It gives me a sort of dizzy 
feeling of the shortness of life and nearness of eternity when I see how many that I have traveled with are 
gone within the veil. Then there are all my own letters, written in the first two years of marriage, when 
Mr. Stowe was in Europe and I was looking forward to motherhood and preparing for it — my letters when 
my whole life v/as within the four walls of my nursery, my thoughts absorbed by the developing character of 
children who have now lived their earthly life and gone to the eternal one, — my two little boys, each in their 
way good and lovely, whom Christ has taken in youth, and my little one, my first Charley, whom He took 
away before he knew sin or sorrow, — then my brother George and sister Catherine, the one a companion of 
my youth, the other the mother who assumed the care 
of me after I left home in my twelfth year — and they 
are gone. Then my blessed father, for many years so 
true an image of the Heavenly Father, — in all my 
afflictions he was afflicted, in all my perplexities he was 
a sure and safe counselor, and he too is gone upward to 
join the angelic mother whom I scarcely knew in this 
world, who has been to me only a spiritual presence 
throuo'h life.

49 Forest Street, Hartford, Conn., October 11, 1887. 

Dear Brother, — I was delighted to receive your 
kind letter. You were my earliest religious teacher ; 
your letters to me while a school-girl in Hartford gave 
me a high Christian aim and standard which I hope 
I have never lost. Not only did they do me good, but 
also my intimate friends, Georgiana May and Catherine Cogswell, to whom I read them. The simpHcity, 
warmth, and childlike earnestness of those school days 
I love to recall. I am the only one living of that circle 
of early friends. Not one of my early schoolmates is 
li\'ing, — and now Henry, younger by a year or two 
than I, has gone — my husband also.^ I often think. 
Why am I spared ? Is there yet anything for me to 
do ? I am thinldng with my son Charles's help of writing a review of my life, under the title, " Pebbles from 
the Shores of a Past Life." 

Charlie told me that he has got all written up to my 
twelfth or thirteenth year, when I came to be under sister Catherine's care in Hartford. I am writing daily my 
remembrances from that tune. You were then, I think, 
teacher of the Grammar School in Hartford. . . . 

So, my dear brother, let us keep good heart ; no evil 
can befall us. Sin alone is evil, and from that Christ 
will keep us. Our journey is so short ! 

I feel about all things now as I do about the things 
that happen in a hotel, after my trunk is packed to go 
home. I may be vexed and annoyed . . . but what of 
it ! I am going home soon. 

Your affectionate sister, Hattie.
